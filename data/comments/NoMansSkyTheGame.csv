NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,Jrodan,81,Tue Jul 21 09:28:18 2015 UTC,"People were speaking of the ""island problem"" in the sense that any planet THAT HAS WATER ON IT seems to lack large, cohesive landmass and is heavily fragmented.  I believe people are aware that there are large bodies of land but those seem to be no-liquid planets."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,Curratum,11,Tue Jul 21 09:59:55 2015 UTC,I honestly made this post because my instant reaction from looking at the post was that all planets would be patchy. After I read the comments (before I posted this) I agreed with what was said. I posted this for anyone who might look at just the images and would have the same reaction I did from them.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,Curratum,14,Tue Jul 21 11:28:24 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I didn't mean to be a dick, just hoping to narrow it down a bit."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,root88,3,Tue Jul 21 11:30:15 2015 UTC,"All your images show is that the field of view / distance view is too small to see if you are on an island or not. Pretty much anything that isn't a shot of the planet from space is worthless. The one shot from space that you did show only lets us know that there are waterless planets, which we already knew."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,DoctorWett,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:58 2015 UTC,If you don't see water in the field of view than it must mean that water is a long walk away and that you aren't on a tiny island
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,root88,3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"You probably aren't seeing more than a mile away. These are planet sized planets, even islands are kind of big.

We have seen land based planets with small inland waterways or ponds but we haven't seen planets with truly distinct continents accompanied by  substantial oceans. However I feel like HG would have considered that as a factor judging by detailed work they've shown in other areas of planet/world creation.  Reading the previous post though It seemed some people were concerned that these patchy planets were going to be the nature of all planets, which is what I'm mainly responding too.   Edit: The dinosaur planet I thought had waterways may just be another waterworld."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,blueExcess,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:47 2015 UTC,The post answers my concern about islands which I assumed whatever number of others might have too. It's a reasonable leap to think that HG would have considered continents and oceans in the time they've been developing planets.   Either they exist or HG has decided the game's better without them in their opinion. It's all speculation and not worth getting bitter about at the end of the day though.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,akjoltoy,-13,Tue Jul 21 11:13:12 2015 UTC,Nobody thought all planets were going to be patchy. That was a stupid interpretation on your part.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1xnu,defeattheenemy,0,Tue Jul 21 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"""Some of the greatest philosophers and scientists in human history spent a lot of their downtime on reddit"" - Reddit has only been around since 2005, which is actually longer than I thought, but still a short enough amount of time to invalidate your point. ;) In all seriousness though, you're not going to see (the majority of) great philosophers needlessly putting people down simply because they disagree with them. Any philosopher worth the title knows that the most valuable comments/opinions are the ones contrary to their own beliefs.   It seems as though you believe I should have posted something to the effect of, ""U R DUM"", but that's not the message I was trying to convey, nor is it entertaining in the least. But I suppose that is definitely less ""wordy"" and strictly speaking, would be the ""stupid"" way of putting it. Unfortunately, brevity has never been my strongest quality.  Regarding intelligence, if you can make an argument for how spending one's time telling people that their differing opinion is ""stupid"" and ""worthless"" yet contributing nothing to the conversation yourself is somehow an intellectual exercise of one kind or another, I will concede the point.   Besides, I didn't actually say specifically what I thought of anyone's intelligence."

I was saying the opposite. I was pointing out that you judging his intelligence based on his comment was idiotic. And that using the phrase ""intellectual prowess"" showed that you were in fact a pseudointellectual. The type that uses way more words to communicate the exact same meaning than necessary. It showed how utterly stupid you really are.  -i never said his behavior was an intellectual exercise. i said that his behavior wasn't something you could judge his intelligence based on. seriously do you have brain damage?  -yes you did. you made a comment about his ""intellectual prowess""  You are a child."

Nevertheless it seems that in the aforementioned pictures there are indicators there should be lots of water somewhere, and yet is is nowhere to be seen (#4 has a small pond, but no ocean), which could mean the footage was taken on a landmass at least bigger than the one featured in the latest ign video.  My theory is that HG tweaked their code for E3 to only generate homogeneous planets with a little of everything (50/50 land/water), so that no matter where you land your ship the demo would be interesting and contain different elements."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3b8w,Renegade_Meister,-5,Tue Jul 21 20:57:15 2015 UTC,Strange to have it free while live but charging for replay...
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3b8w,Scepticer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"I cant see any uploads of this lasting for very long. if it requires payment, it might be considered stealing."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,AesopSquaresoft,11,Tue Jul 21 16:18:17 2015 UTC,"These were taken from the VGX video.  I love the idea of exploring and seeing/finding a cool looking ship that you MUST have.  I must say, that fighter in the first shot is sexxyyyy.  Also, most of those planets in the backrounds seem to not have that island problem that everyone is talking about. :D"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,tigress666,3,Tue Jul 21 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love those ships. But probably because they look like x-wings (I always loved x-wings when I was a kid). I'm going to have a hard time picking any other ship that doesn't look x-wingish int he game (which might be a problem if they aren't the type that fit how I want to play it best)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,CoreyGoodine14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:30 2015 UTC,the x-wing looking ships are the fighters so those will specialize in weapons
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,tigress666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"Which I kinda gathered so I'm hoping I can get by on them cause what I think I'll want is a jack of all trades ship. Something that has some fighting capability but also some trading capability. I plan on using Outlaw Star (an anime I liked in college) as my inspiration to my character's motivation. She's going to be some one who has heard of some famous treasure in the middle of the universe and is going to try to avoid taking sides in combat unless the pirates are threatening to take something she needs (but she's not going to pirate herself either, she'll prefer to try to stay out of it but will need some fighting capability).  (Yes, I tend to lean towards RPGs in general but with this game I see no reason I can't introduce roleplaying in it. What I see the entire potential is the ability to pretend I'm exploring the world and giving myself a backstory that fits in teh world as i've heard it explained so far just makes it a little more fun)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,handstobattlestation,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:29 2015 UTC,Just do whatever makes you happy =)
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,tigress666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:04 2015 UTC,"That's what is great about this game. So many ways to play it. I don't get the people who ask, ""What do you do?"" The game seems like it has a lot of options for what you do."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,handstobattlestation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"I had to reevaluate my expectations for the game, but I'm nonetheless excited for it on the exploration level (even if I can't make space stations and the like, which I would love to)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,tigress666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Oh god, that would be awesome. Unfortunately I think the dev wants something more simple that more people can get into. I am thinking he is seeing this as a game more that you can relax to vs. trying to make it complicated/challenging. Which is fine. But yeah, i'd love to be able to build stuff on planets or make your own space station. Hell, I'd just be happy to be able to craft my own weapons or make my own space ship modifications (it sounds like you just gather stuff and take it to a station who has that option to buy if you have the right stuff).  I think I'll like the game as is though. I just wish we could get a release date. I'm not sure which is more torture to me right now, the wait for Fallout 4 or wanting a release date for NMS (especially as the time I'd like NMS to come out before I have other games I want to play is shortening for this year. I kinda was hoping to use Sept-Oct for Mad Max though I am not sure how long Mad Max will last me and as much as I'm so hyped for NMS, I'm pretty sure it will lose to Fallout if it comes out November or December so that means for me waiting until next year to play it if it comes out that late). Heh, I'm having the opposite problem this year of last year, too many games coming out at once that I want to play (last year was a really suck year for gaming for me. But I did get a lot of backlog taken care of)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,handstobattlestation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"I have an absurd number of games in my Steam backlog; some, like Dark Souls, are only held off because they're buggy to start (in the case of DS, it takes 5-10 minutes to start. Not because my PC is slow, but because something is bizarre with the port).  I'm hesitant to buy more, but NMS is pretty appealing."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,tigress666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to get myself to stop buying games until I'm ready to play them. I'm kinda poor so I have to limit what I buy. And for ones I want to play later if I wait they'll be cheaper. Plus there are a few games on my I want to try out list that I just couldn't justify new price for (Handsome Jack collection, Dying Light). Persona 5 and wasteland 2 is probably going to be a victim of that (I want to play it but I definitely prioritize NMS, Fallout, and Max Max before it so it'll probably wait til sometime next year or later. Though it sounds like maybe they aren't going to make the 2015 date localization that they claim they want to release it in the US).  Though if Wasteland 2 comes out soon I might buy it day one (I'm going to need something between Witcher 3 and Mad Max as I'm almost done with Witcher. But I also have some games on backlog so if I'm smart I'll just play those). Well unless a miracle happens and NMS is released August (I would so love that but at this point I think that would take a miracle)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,blueExcess,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"I was always the maladjusted kid who cheered for Darth Vader ;) No, but I definitely preferred the Tie-Fighters, likely because of the colors is my suspicion, but who knows why we latch onto the things we did as children. This is me saying I really hope there's a ship like that so I can hunt down your X-Wing and shout about rebel scum :D"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,tigress666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"Heh, I loved x-wings but I did have a crush on Darth Vader as a kid. X-wings just looked way cooler than tie fighters. But my favorite part of a plane is the wings and tie fighters just look dorky to me while x-wings actually had wings (I know, space you don't need them but I have always loved planes so I'm going to gravitate more towards ships that look like planes)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,MHasho,6,Tue Jul 21 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"Notice how the 2 bottom pictures are both on ""Quidar II"" (in the upper left corner) even though they're 2 opposite environments.  Weird... but it might be something to do with different builds of the game, or generating specific environments/scenes just for the trailer.  I always loved these clips though."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,MHasho,3,Tue Jul 21 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"Good catch.   Brings up another question actually, do planets in NMS have polar ice caps? I have yet to see any with some."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,blueExcess,4,Tue Jul 21 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"oooooo you just opened up a whole can of space-worms.  Polar ice caps would be very interesting, but it's been pretty much confirmed that polar/arctic zones may not exist, since a planet will be one consistent environment all around.   That being said, there will be arctic/snowy planets, so polar ice caps are plausible!  This opens up the possibility for ice bergs, ice floes, glaciers, etc."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,blueExcess,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, but now we do know (as of a few days ago) that Pluto has ice caps! It's always been a planet in my book, and I'm going to name the shit out of planets in NMS to make my point. Pluto, Pluto One, Pluto the Great, Planet Pluto, Pluto Pluto..."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,MHasho,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"One is the mountains - I vaguely remember HG talking about how one of their ""rules of the universe"" was that snow would exist above x level, depending on distance from the sun and a bunch of other ""maths"" and whatnot. So they are likely from the same build, which is awesome."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,blueExcess,2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting!  I love seeing big features like those mountains, like, rather than a hill just being an isolated lump you can run past, or a mountain range being a line of rocks you can jetpack over in less than a minute. I'm hoping things like mountains will be so tall and wide that you could spend a while just jetpacking up onto overhangs, scaling up until you reach snow - snow that generates because you're literally that high off the ground!  I'd really like to hope some natural features will be life-sized.   I'm just afraid mountains that size can't generate since the peaks would end up in outer space due to the thinner sky.   We'll have to wait until the first ""highest mountain discovery contest"" on this subreddit once the game is out to make sure of it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,kalaster189,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've actually been wondering about that. I'm assuming that this E3 build that all the videos so far have been based on has smaller planets than the retail version. I assume that because Sean has said many, many times that the planets will be planet-sized - He even started to say that in one of the recent IGN videos before Ryan cut him off with some pointless and random comment.   But you're absolutely right - if, for some reason, the majority of planets are about the same size that we've been seeing (I really hope not), then the mountains couldn't be very tall at all or they would be well out of the atmosphere. Actually.... I suppose that technically that's entirely possible lol. It doesn't happen on earth but I can't think of a reason that our laws of physics wouldn't allow that to exist as long as it's well within the Roche limit (lol, how absurd would that be to come even close to that?)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,lwg21,4,Tue Jul 21 19:40:10 2015 UTC,That last ship looks like the cobra ship from Elite Dangerous :D
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,Dizman7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:49 2015 UTC,It does!  Maybe it will be multipurpose too in NMS.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,Dizman7,4,Tue Jul 21 16:26:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for compiling those. I have to say that discovering and improving your ship is one of the aspects of the game I'm most excited about! It's nice to see that designs can be very different.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,Kiggsworthy,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Really like the first ship, and the last one.  I don't care much for the 2nd one, which a lot of them we've seen are so far it seems.  Looks kinda like a dorky version of an X-wing, if that makes any sense. Â  I agree I look forward to finding more!  The 2nd one is a Fighter class, not sure about the 1st and 3rd, maybe Explorer class?  Haven't really seen any of those yet.  The trader class ones are the VTOL looking ones (not pictured)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e33yn,Scepticer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the first picture is a specialized fighter  Big guns, low jump range  2nd pic, like you said we've seen a couple times already seems like a starter ship.  Small guns, decent jump range just to get out of the spawn system.  3rd, Im hoping is more of a jack of all trades   Decent guns/jump/cargo but doesnt excel in one profession.  Anyway. Too excited."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,IIHURRlCANEII,11,Tue Jul 21 17:27:04 2015 UTC,Nice. That's probably the best evidence yet that the E3 build is not indicative of the final game
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,Demos42,4,Tue Jul 21 12:40:09 2015 UTC,Awesome these elements were set to make the planet habitable. Meaning the game will be much different.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,odusanyaka,3,Tue Jul 21 11:15:53 2015 UTC,"This is actually really cool, nice find!  What's cooler is HG has talked about how the chemicals and the atmospheric makeup will have an impact on what types of life generates on the planet, and how the chemicals in the atmosphere go beyond just ""whether the planet is toxic or not""  This could be a solid reasoning for why most live clips shown since E3 take place on similar looking planets, with similar looking creatures. It could explain the ""island problem"" as well.   Seems like proof that the E3 build is deliberately constrained, probably to not spoil too many creatures/environments before the game is released.   Anyone who is having doubts should check out some of the older trailers made by Hello Games and take note of all the different environments and creatures."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,MHasho,3,Tue Jul 21 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"I guess you're assuming that the E3's builds weren't procedural? The thing is, after seeing the video where they show kind of how the world procedurally generates around you, and hearing that the universe isn't saved in the disc/installation folder which makes sense too, plus he picked a planet at random, makes it hard to believe that the E3 builds weren't procedural.  Also: they have been intentionally showing all(if not most) content from the farther areas from the center of the galaxy which means things are way more normal compared to being more and more closer to the center, so oxygen to whatever-that-other-thing-is ratio might be the same at the corners-ish of the galaxy which were mostly shown so far, just so we don't need to get any crazy suit upgrades and stuff at the very beginning.  It could also be a part of the procedural maths that they just didn't quite finish yet, or they modified the builds they showed us in a way that they don't suddenly die in the game because there isn't enough oxygen or if there is a lot of toxic atmosphere(this sounds the most passable option to me)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,JohnSmith5782,27,Tue Jul 21 11:03:18 2015 UTC,"They are definitely procedural, but most likely with a lot of the variables tightly constrained.  Things that come to mind, which you might want to dial back to make a safer demo:   Planet size Solar system size Landmass type Atmosphere composition Animal variations NPC strength   Any of those sound familiar?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,posthamster,2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some things are probably under constraints, but my guess is that some things simply are still in development. In the release video they used to have actual element/compounds for atmosphere with much more realistic combinations. They're probably still figuring out where to go with the atmosphere mechanic since its likely a higher level function that the core design isn't heavily reliant on.    I think we need to remember this is a small dev team with a coder as their ""pr"" person, and they're probably not intricately fabricating hype-content."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,dysp_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:39 2015 UTC,"Sean specifically said that the variables were rigged for E3. It's just too risky to leave to chance. If they just happened to hit a boring spot in the universe, the whole game looks boring. He mentioned that everyone that showed dinosaurs intentionally because it would make impressive footage."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,root88,0,Tue Jul 21 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"He also said he made it so he would always spawn in at a beacon.  And looking at the E3 footage where you can see the trader fleet when it zooms out after he ""uploads"" at that beacon. I'm guessing he also made it so a fleet would show up a little while after you arrive. I'm also guessing pirates will show up and a fight will commence (sounds familiar? It should. It's the start of the demo.)  In effect. They can tweak a lot for a demo."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,MuchStache,0,Tue Jul 21 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think the animal variation was constrained. I actually hope the finished game has increased variety. Some things look too similar. Planet size has been said to be real earth size more or less so I don't think that was changed either. Solar system size; this is interesting, I'd hope that it will be more varied in the final game. NPC strength, maybe. Atmosphere, which I already touched on, maybe."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,JohnSmith5782,3,Tue Jul 21 11:28:43 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not assuming the E3 build wasn't procedural. And I actually have to agree with what posthamster said about this build having tightly constrained variables.  You could see where ever they land, The amount of atmosphere components on that planet was controlled so that there would always be some sort of life in there (Assuming that's one of the ways they define how the wild life generates on planets)."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,papi_chulo83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:54:10 2015 UTC,remember... the more crazy planets requires special suits and upgrades so they are more or less showing us the starting areas and not where we will be spending the most of our game time.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,RBedlam,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:25 2015 UTC,"We've not seen 2% of the variety that NMS has to offer, I guarantee it. These numbers mean nothing."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,handstobattlestation,2,Tue Jul 21 12:19:48 2015 UTC,"Technically we've seen < 100 planets. Let's round it up to 100.  We've (hypothetically) seen the fraction 100/(18 Quintillion) of the universe.  18 Quintillion = 18,000,000,000,000,000,000  So that's:  1/18,000,000,000,000,000,000  So that's.... 5.5555556e-20% of the universe? Someone correct my math?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,root88,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:03 2015 UTC,"Well, the numbers may be correct, your math really doesn't matter. The majority of those planets will look very similar. If there are 200 planet types, we may have seen 2% of them. I don't need to visit 800 billion lifeless planets to get the idea."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,tjallingt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:48 2015 UTC,Well... if you want to get technical:  /u/RBedlam is talking about the variety. Saying we've only seen 100/(18 Quintillion) planets might be correct but that doesn't exactly mean that we have only seen 5.5555556e-20% of the variety because not all those 18 Quintillion are going to be incredibly distinct.  (Similar to the difference between 1 and 2 being larger than the difference between 101 and 102 even if the step between them is the same size)  Factually speaking we have seen anywhere between 5.5555556e-20% and 2% of the variety the final game will have to offer (although the 2% is not exactly factual but one can hope we have seen less than two percent :P).
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,handstobattlestation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:25 2015 UTC,1 and 2 being larger than the difference between 101 and 102   I'm afraid I don't understand your meaning by this?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,tjallingt,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"the difference between 1 and 2 is which is pretty big (0,5) when you compare it to the difference between 101 and 102 (approximately 0.01).  The same way: if you have only seen 2 planets the difference between them might seem pretty big but when you have seen a 102 the difference between them might be very small.  I think this illustrates that with 18 quintillion planets it probably wont mean every planet is completely unique (which means we definately have seen more than 5e-20% of the variety in the game)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,RBedlam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:19 2015 UTC,"I was using 2% symbolically, insofar as we've seen a very small amount, not literally 2%."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1yk2,Strongpillow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:08 2015 UTC,Look at all those cockpit iterations! I was always wondering how they'd go about that since the cockpit will be the second most viewed content next to planets.  Glad to see they change up abit.

If you want a (probably) similar experience I'd google ""Noctis""   It runs on DOS, it's restricted to criminally low res (no, it's worse than you are thinking.), it has an awful control scheme (it is so bad in a genius way that it inspires awe.) It has no combat and no direct ship control. Sometimes, navigation actually requires use of a command prompt your ship has.  it barely runs on DOSBOX, less than barely runs on 32-bit win, it won't run at all on 64-bit win.   It's also utterly enthralling. A Billion worlds in a single MB.  The first time I saw a quartz tower forest, or the time I found a life bearing world 400au from the star, Or the Brown dwarf with 6 life bearing worlds around it... unbeatable. And somehow the graphics just enhance the atmosphere of isolation, of you being a member of an ancient and dying race, dying because they have given up on every activity save exploring.  If no mans sky is just Noctis with a better interface and updated graphics, it will eat lives."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,anlumo,4,Tue Jul 21 14:05:22 2015 UTC,"It also was the one with the most questions after the talk so far, at least for the ones Iâve been to (there are two or sometimes three parallel tracks)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,DurMan667,4,Tue Jul 21 14:17:54 2015 UTC,Was so impressed how to the point and coolly she handled the you-never-know-what-you'll-get audience questions. And actually said something substantial in reply more often than others manage.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,DurMan667,4,Tue Jul 21 14:21:14 2015 UTC,"The nice things about conferences like this is that lots of the people there actually have a clue what you're talking about. This means that the questions can be more pointed to specific things, and when you're a programmer with your face buried in code and someone asked a pointed question about that very code, you know the answer.  The hardest part about this sort of thing is just the public speaking aspect. As long as you can keep your brain ticking over in front of hundreds of people you're good to go."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,DurMan667,3,Tue Jul 21 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"That's the best case.  But audience questions remain audience questions. I'm not saying Hazel didn't receive good ones, just that reacting put on the spot, not putting your foot in your mouth and all that while still delivering a substantial reply does command my respects.   I suppose we've all seen this same situation go south in other talks, with other people, and audiences going off on a tangent."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,DurMan667,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:09 2015 UTC,"Like I said it's a matter of keeping your wits about you while speaking publicly. Lots of people tend to lock up when doing a presentation like this, only being able to answer what they are prepared to answer. Though I didn't actually see the talk, I get the feeling from the reactions here that Hazel is comfortable enough on stage to improvise."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,WormholeMaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yep. I hope there'll be more of her in the future, if that's something she's at all willing to do: Maybe Sean just drew the short straw at HG, though indeed every one of them is a very capable public speaker.   Very fluent, content rich, organized talk. Maybe it'll turn up later."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,carminejr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"Sean presented at previous shows because not only is he one of the co-founders of the company, the game itself is more or less his brain child. If Grant, Ryan, or David had built that first chunk of code, it might very well be them on the stage."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,tomothy37,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"While this goes off on a tangent, I doubt HG are oblivious to the effect selection of representation will have on public perception and sales. They are pretty thoughtful in this.  You could argue everyone is equally qualified, but I doubt that. They'll send who's up to the task (skill, scheduling, and willing), because it's the best for HG as a group.  And I'd argue you can see this, in Hazel doing a tech talk and panel, Grant in art, and Sean shouldering a demanding task confronting press and ignorance at E3."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,SuperGodman234,4,Tue Jul 21 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely second that. At least, single piece of information."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,anlumo,7,Tue Jul 21 14:31:05 2015 UTC,Anyone have an on-demand link?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,anlumo,5,Tue Jul 21 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"I personally am amazed how just how intricate and complex procedural generation really is, from the way the voxels are saved and generated to how textures overlap to create new textures. I knew it was crazy stuff, but it was awesome to learn more about it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,SuperGodman234,4,Tue Jul 21 14:05:46 2015 UTC,Me too. But I have one question. What exactly are voxels and what are they used for?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,Linkdead404,6,Tue Jul 21 14:08:23 2015 UTC,"Voxels are a 3-dimensions volume equivalent of what's commenly know as a 'pixel', so to say."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,icyflamez96,3,Tue Jul 21 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"So, just to be sure, a voxel is a 3D version of a pixel, right?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,DurMan667,4,Tue Jul 21 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"Where a pixel has area, a voxel has volume, yes."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,icyflamez96,4,Tue Jul 21 15:29:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, got it. Just wanted to make sure. Thanks."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,grgisme,5,Tue Jul 21 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"Minecraft calls them blocks. Games that use them usually donât show them as actual blocks, though."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,icyflamez96,5,Tue Jul 21 14:19:33 2015 UTC,"And, like pixels, you can have varying resolutions!   Polygonization will turn it into, well, polygons you usually see these days in voxel games. But the underlying data is the voxels and... stuff (lol, I now don't recall what HG had in them besides sharpness, anyone remember?)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,ShawnManX,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"And, like pixels, you can have varying resolutions!    Yes, thatâs the octtrees she was talking about."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,Wolverine78,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:07 2015 UTC,Intresting. Thanks.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,TheScorpionGR,4,Tue Jul 21 14:23:01 2015 UTC,"They really layered on top, and on top. I suppose, while many have done something like this before, HG is actually pushing the boundaries here, not so much of what was thought possible, but the craft of actually doing it.   What works, what doesn't. And how computationally intensive will it be. And how can we have our artist(s) play off of it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,SpaceShipRat,8,Tue Jul 21 14:17:15 2015 UTC,"I love, love, love that she talked about the draw distances.  How they actually draw really far out, and that most of the fade-out at a distance is actually atmospheric interference - fog etc - and not the draw distance being fudged. :D"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,SpaceShipRat,6,Tue Jul 21 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"Picture that... HG has been hard at work on atmospheres and fog, and all they get in return are worries about draw distance and idle PC hardware. Poor HG.   But that should finally be laid to rest now.   HG, we love your fog, too! :)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,marian1,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"Now they're just going to turn into complaints about why the fog is on every planet that's not allowing us to see far out... That's definitely my thoughts on the matter now...  http://imgur.com/a/pmJUD It'd be nice to be able to see really far, and it'd help the environments you're in feel huge and massive. If it can achive this kind of draw distance   http://i.imgur.com/ArrVaTq.jpg  Then that'd be awesome, but i'm not getting my hopes up on that front."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,handstobattlestation,5,Tue Jul 21 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"Would be very surprised if we wouldn't have one AND the other. More variation in the box.   Coincidentally, lush jungle swamp worlds will profit from fog through reduced view, while fog-free barren sand planets might have less geometry to shoulder  to begin with... Just a thought. There certainly are intelligent ways to play with fog."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,marian1,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"You mean this kind of draw distance? (center of image, between the two rocky outcrops)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,anlumo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"I wish I could get a more clear view of that vista, but as it is now the picture kinda of gives a bit of hope while at the same time not doing much."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,Fractal_Curve,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"Horizons will differ with planet sizes too. If a planet is the size of our moon, the ""draw distance"" would seem surprisingly short."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,grbolivar,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:22 2015 UTC,Good point! Now I must see bigger planets o_o

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,DoctorWett,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:31 2015 UTC,"Thing to note, in three of those NMS screenshots there is another celestial body in the sky, the draw distance goes at least that far.  Remember it's not just painted onto the sky, it's actually there and you can visit it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,anlumo,3,Tue Jul 21 19:34:23 2015 UTC,Were can i see it please ?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,StrangeYoungMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"It was a live stream. Not sure they'll put it online on demand for free later.   It probably WILL be available for sale, but that's aimed at A.I. programmers, and companies/research employing those, so pricing is accordingly. Not aimed at enthusiasts so much."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2lc1,kotor610,3,Tue Jul 21 20:20:02 2015 UTC,link to the talk?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,BikerBeast,5,Tue Jul 21 18:09:48 2015 UTC,"There's at least a decent chance it will be released on August 4th, though their lack of attendance at Gamescom is probably unrelated.  We'll just have to wait until the end of the month for IGN to (hopefully) drop the release date."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,ElHayseus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:25 2015 UTC,What's on August 4th?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,mogi67,3,Tue Jul 21 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"Some of us have been speculating August 4th because it's the first Tuesday after IGN's month-long coverage, the end of which we expect will leave us with a release date.  We're guessing they'll release the game sooner rather than later, and the Playstation Store updates on Tuesdays, so that's why we're guessing that date.  Just as likely I think, though, would be August 11th."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,ElHayseus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I think that's placing more importance on IGN's coverage than warranted though. To Hello Games, IGN is just another press outlet. I don't think the IGN First thing is a teamup between IGN, Sony and Hello Games to launch the game, I think IGN asked Hello Games during E3 if they wanted some coverage for the month of July, it would only take a couple hours, and they said ""sure why not, the game is coming out before long"".  I honestly will not be surprised if there's not only no release date come July 31st, but if the game is still months away."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,charliebucket-,3,Tue Jul 21 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"I would be tempted to believe this is the case if HG hadn't already said they wanted to announce a release date at E3 but were told not to.  I think (but of course, can't be certain) that Sony told them to wait until after IGN's coverage to drop the release date, which is why it would make sense that the release date might be announced on the 31st.  The reason I'm placing so much importance on IGN's coverage is because I see it as Sony's way of marketing this indie game without having to pay to run TV ads, effectively making for an efficient marketing campaign right before release.  But of course, that's all speculation on my part, so take it with a grain of salt."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,ElHayseus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"I hope it's the 11th.  Then I have two weeks to prepare.  I get paid on the 14th, and will request the 13th and 14th off (my boss will be pissed - cause I'm payroll - but probably let me go, since all the checks get printed on 12th. :P) for vacation...and possibly the 17th and 18th as well.  Though I expect my girlfriend will hate me no matter what day it comes out. :P"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,Linkdead404,-4,Tue Jul 21 19:44:56 2015 UTC,"lol, it's not coming out that early. Sony will want to do a fully fledged marketing campaign. Expect christmas."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,TomatoKarate,6,Tue Jul 21 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"Chirstmas would be a bad decision, considering all the AAA titles launching at that time.  August is the best month to launch in ATM, very little competition and the hype is high."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,CannabisPrime2,4,Tue Jul 21 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, I find that hard to believe.  At the end of the day, this is an indie game, and though Sony is giving it the royal treatment as far as indie games go, they probably aren't going to run the same kind of marketing campaign as they would for their AAA titles.  Based on what we know and have been told so far, the game is almost if not completely done at this point.  I'd be shocked if it's not out by September, honestly."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,ElHayseus,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:44:13 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Dec. 25 will be the announced release date.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,bcGrimm,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:22 2015 UTC,Sony isn't attending Gamescom which is probably why it's not on the list.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,charliebucket-,4,Tue Jul 21 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's impossible to say either way. Hello Games have been known to do little to no press. The only event I can think of other than E3 they've done for NMS was PSX, and that was probably as a favour to Sony.   I don't think them not being there points to any outcome."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,ahref,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:06 2015 UTC,"Gamescom is expensive, E3 is expensive. HG only got in because Sony asked them.  There's also limited floor space etc.  I'm quite sure you could make a chart of all games released before/after/during gamescom that were not at gamescom."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,PSN-Honestly,4,Tue Jul 21 18:19:48 2015 UTC,It's actually the other way around. Hello Games asked Sony for E3 time in lieu of financial assistance after the flood.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,_therealchin,3,Tue Jul 21 19:10:40 2015 UTC,"That flood was in 2013, and the E3 space they asked for was for 2014.  Pretty sure since it received so much good press and reception that it was Sony's decision to put them on stage and make them one of the center attractions this year.  I don't think Hello Games had to ask for a spot this year around."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,PSN-Honestly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and after 'owning E3' in 2014, you think either party really had to make a decision? Seems like a forgone conclusion they'd be a centerpiece for 2015's E3."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,ahref,3,Tue Jul 21 19:35:44 2015 UTC,I'd love a source for that. Like really love a source.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,teaminus,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"From The New Yorker 05/18/15:   Two weeks later, on Christmas Eve, a tributary of the Thames overflowed in Guildford, flooding the Hello Games studio. Murray rushed over and found laptops floating in waist-deep water; tens of thousands of dollarsâ worth of equipment was destroyed. Sonyâs offer of assistance remained, but Murray told me that he did not ask for funding. Unlike Hollywood, the video-game industry is marked by a vast chasm between big-budget productions and independent ones, and he had learned with Joe Danger that a small studio could easily become beholden to a distributor. Instead, he requested Sonyâs help in securing a place for No Manâs Sky at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the largest gaming trade show in America. No independently produced title had ever been featured on the main stage, but, as he recalled, âI saidâand this was really cockyââWe want to own E3.â They were, like, âThatâs not going to happen,â but we pushed for it. We traded working for them for being onstage.â (Ahmad told me that the hesitation was largely logistical: âE3 takes time to plan.â)"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3kbp,chrissystardust,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:13 2015 UTC,Wishful thinking. Not attending Gamescom probably means they're too busy working on the game/not interested in doing more press.

So even if the do give a date at the end of IGN first, which gives them till the 31st, that is only 4 days. What game has come out with their release date that gives only a 4 day notice? You usually hear of store getting the game 4 days before the release.   So my guess is that they give an early October release date...maybe even a mid September date at the earliest. This gives them 4-8 weeks before all the big AAA games come out in mid November."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,superpositionquantum,9,Tue Jul 21 01:29:04 2015 UTC,"Could be done simply with a large-scale perlin (or wavelet, I tend to prefer wavelet) with a threshold function and a weathering function to generate plains and stuff. Further smaller scale passes would add smaller scale features, like mountains, etc.  Considering everything we've seen about the procedural generation in this game, I can't really believe what we've seen isn't intentional."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,Demos42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:44:05 2015 UTC,It is a huge deal to me though. I seriously hope we won't see any of those planets in the final build. Not from a design or artistic impression are they giving any sensational exploration purposes. I'm going to be very disappointed whenever I run into them.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,Kantham,12,Tue Jul 21 14:40:02 2015 UTC,"I also really hope they have some bigger continents as well, not just a hundred Icelands on every planet"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,DawnBlue,9,Mon Jul 20 23:48:55 2015 UTC,not just a hundred Icelands on every planet   Although...that would make satisfying your frozen food needs a breeze.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,Gutterflame,22,Tue Jul 21 06:01:36 2015 UTC,"Just to preempt some comments:   -I'm aware some of the bits of terrain touch slightly, so they aren't technically islands. But you know what I mean, that the landscape is very fragmented.  -Only watery planets look like this: we've seen ice planets and desert planets with no water, as they don't have oceans, they just have smooth terrain.  -This is not gonna make me hate the game or think it's ""all the same planet"", terrain features at ground level are extremely varied: we've seen arches, spikes, cliffs and small water pools.  It's just a tiny a letdown, because I imagined ...walking for a long time on a mesa, then flying and landing again on a mountain, or exiting a forest and finally beholding the gleaming ocean shore!   Currently you seem to be able to reach plains, mountains and ocean in a few steps from every possible landing spot, which doesn't encourage lengthy exploration."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,toasterweasel,10,Mon Jul 20 23:38:42 2015 UTC,Nice job on this.  It brings up what I believe to one of the possible failings of this game.  Millions of different planets sounds great but if they end up all looking the same but with different colors then it will be a huge let down.  I'm trying to set my expectations lower but it's hard.  A lot of it comes down to what I'm willing to pay for a game experience.  At $60 if it's like that I would pass but at $30 or less I would feel I got a return on my investment.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,grgisme,11,Mon Jul 20 23:52:34 2015 UTC,"terrain features at ground level are extremely varied: we've seen arches, spikes, cliffs and small water pools.   We've seen different terrain ""decor"" on pretty much every single planet, I'm not worried about variety, just the lasting power of every planet. I wanted to spend a couple hours exploring, not 10 minutes going from shore to shore, then might as well leave."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,Peaceful_Gamer,7,Tue Jul 21 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Well said. Planets themselves should have staying power, otherwise each ""planet"" might as well just be a small room for as long as it would hold a person's interest."

All I'm saying is, apart from the ""weird"" flora and fauna of planets and their increasingly complex features in landscape as you near the centre, increased land masses will also have more complex shapes to them. I think these ""island worlds"" could be the simpler variety on the outter edges. They could very well be moons and not necessarily planets as we would think of them."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,posthamster,11,Mon Jul 20 23:48:50 2015 UTC,its the thing i most worried about the game. i want to see planets like this: http://orig10.deviantart.net/d9e4/f/2009/353/d/a/planet_release_7_by_nvseal.jpg and this: http://ltheory.com/blog/planet2.png  http://meta.filesmelt.com/downloader.php?file=scr00006.png  planets with land masses like these.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,Wild_Loose_Comma,14,Tue Jul 21 08:44:51 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying, and I won't dispute it for what it is. But looking at all of the planets visited from E3 onwards, combined with journalist descriptions of their hands on time with the game, it seems that HG created this build with very few base models and textures to draw upon.  Every planet shown or described has really been a variation on a particular theme. I believe this was done to exert a certain amount of control on the content seen pre-release. They appear to have made sure that certain things never seen nor talked about before weren't ""let out of the bag"" too early. They included some new elements, like upgrades and the loot cubes, but since every journalist basically had a very similar experience, I am positive this build was created to ensure a certain homogenous quality.  You could argue that this approach was flawed, as those that were on the fence will now claim that the planets are too ""samey"", and the game lacks variety. But we all know that Sean would rather die than have certain elements of the game leak before release, so it appears to me they took precautions to ensure they controlled what appeared on screen, no matter what random system was selected.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but I like to believe this was a conscious choice on HG's part to trickle out content, and continue to maintain the more Earth-like creatures and planetary environments, without spoiling the truly weird or bizarre."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,windsorwork,7,Tue Jul 21 01:15:23 2015 UTC,"I hope so. But at the same time, if it truly isn't very repetitive, and there truly is tons of variety, then what difference does it make if you show brand new and very different things every time? There's 18 Quintillion planets, and if they're all worth visiting and are all unique and different, then they could easily show us thousands without it  ""spoiling"" the entire discovery of the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,jarlrmai2,3,Tue Jul 21 01:29:33 2015 UTC,Because doing that would raise people's expectations even more.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,DurMan667,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:09:15 2015 UTC,"I think theres a few reasons. For starters, there are going to be boring planets. When doing a presser like this, people are going to get first impressions and you want them to be good, you don't want to show them a boring planet.   Also, HG wants to give people a relateable planet, they don't want to show them the weird alien planet for their first planet because it's hard to relate to immediately as a presser. They also don't want to spoil that surprise for the players if they can help it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,eliascelis1,2,Tue Jul 21 09:30:05 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, and before the game releases, they will have a final pre-release trailer showing off the final build, and we will all climax."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,DurMan667,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:24:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I think they limited the seed or the generator to limit the variety for this build.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,arkiula,12,Tue Jul 21 09:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue is that a lot of these planets may not be meant to have water. My reasoning is this:   The build they showed at E3 this year was more or less certainly made to have 100% of planets have complex life in order to look good whenever someone visited any planet. This was probably done by setting them all to ""perfectly habitable,"" which means water, oxygen, plants, animals, etc. That means that planets being generated, no matter their geographical make-up or orbit, would have water and be all pretty.  For Joe Shmoe Planet, the dead space rock, simple noise is all well and good. I have a feeling that planets that are MEANT to be all pretty and habitable will probably be more pretty and habitable."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,Show_Me_Your_Rocket,3,Tue Jul 21 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"When they showed the game in e3 the only thing they tweaked from the game was that there was always a beacon near where you landed, they didn't adjust any of the conditions of the planets; Sean got lucky with that planet, but he said in later interviews that the planet was picked at random and if he had gotten a lifeless rock then he would've done the demo with that, soo yeah just clarifying that."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,SLH1989,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:54 2015 UTC,Have a source for that? Just because they didn't say they upped the life in the galaxy it doesn't mean they didn't anyway.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,Dussck,2,Tue Jul 21 07:59:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, this would be my bet. It's a result of the E3 build imo, especially since we keep seeing similar small mammals and pink crystals as well. In fact, this planet looks similar to the one visited in the previous video."

However I agree that the frequency is.... worrying? It's hard to describe it as it's obviously not game breaking or anything yet is a bit annoying. Perhaps we shall see more connected/continent like landmasses upon release and I do believe Sean has stated that continents are a feature, but we shall see.  Perhaps they were aiming for the ""early earth"" style with more biologically sparse but still temperate zone planets displaying separated landmasses and more developed planets displaying large continental areas."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,DoctorWett,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:03 2015 UTC,"Murray mentioned before that they're having problem with geologically realistic terrain.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,EveryReplyProcedural,2,Tue Jul 21 08:01:30 2015 UTC,"I think its an artefact. They changed the ""superformula"" for this demos to force all planets having live on them. While it's something i really hate because i would really love to see everything about the game - even rock-planets - i think the result of this change is this.   To force every planet having life you don't only say ""there shall be life"". You need to also force the biomes for this life. Since all planets look the same i think that was the only way."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,Demos42,2,Tue Jul 21 08:25:39 2015 UTC,"My guess is the routines are not optimized enough to allow such a large amount of (perlin) noises to be stacked at realtime.  Oh, and excellent job putting this image together btw."

I want planets to have a scifi look from space.  Check.  As long as there are land masses that you can run across for 5-10 min that's fine by me.  Do you really want to spend your time in a game running, just to say you ran across a huge land mass?  Where I'm with you is I want to be surprised, now planets in systems or areas in space may share rules/ laws and be similar, but I also want that moments where I'm like ""fuck, these smart fuckers just procedually generated this buckwild place"".   It's funny because I don't really give two shits if they have ""continets"", it just doesn't matter to me.  I actually hope there is a lot of repition in the game.  If you are stuck in a shity system like the Dagobah system that would encourage you to upgrade some shit and get the he'll out of there.  My dream planet would be all water with one small land mass at the equator.  Am I going to get that, probably not but this is Sean game...not mine.  Lucky for me, my ideals of what scifi are sorta line up with seans.  So if he is happy with his product in the end I'm sure I will be too."

Feels like they purposefully scaled it like that, like they want people to explore quickly and not find giant monotonous oceans or plains.

Big reason why I'm trying (and failing) to think and read as little as possible about my two most anticipated games (FO4 and NMS). I want to be surprised by the games, not disappointed by features I've imagined but aren't in the final game.   I've actually taken this to the extreme with highly anticipated movies. There's a movie coming out soonish. And I have not watched a single trailer or read a single article about the movie. I don't know whose in it. I don't know the plot.

Here's some more shitty complaints to save you the trouble.  OMG why is all the liquid water, don't they know other liquids exist?  OMG why are all of the animals pretty much the same size, don't they know other sizes exist?  OMG most of the animals I've seen are green or brown, don't they know other colors exist?  OMG why are all the planets around the same size, don't they know other planet sizes exist?  OMG why are there no gas planets, don't they know that rocky planets are not the only natural objects in space too?

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,wazzas,2,Tue Jul 21 10:55:57 2015 UTC,"The game is procedurally made. So yes, builds can look vastly different from one another simply by inputting a different set of data.   We've seen Sean ,with one change, in mere seconds, take a well designed, interesting, topographically variant planet, and turn it into endless waves of peaks and valleys with zero differentiation to them. (The gameinformer video I believe)  So it is really no stretch at all that before e3 , Sean decided to tweak parts of the algorithm, which we know he did to some degree, that drastically changed the layout and design of every planet in the whole game. Maybe even excluded vast numbers of flora and fauna models from the algorithm, so as not to accidentally show something too alien.   All he has to do to revert back, is just plug the original numbers back in. So bam, game 100% different in seconds.   This is not a game that requires vast effort or time to change, and any changes affect every single planet in the game. It's impossible in my mind that Sean would unconsciously allow every planet to be an archipelago, or even a majority of them. I have no doubt he purposely tweaked it to be more interesting for small gameplay chunks. So anyone who gets their hands on the game for 10minutes, will for sure see creatures, for sure be near a beacon, for sure have water to check out etc."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,blakeathey,2,Tue Jul 21 03:04:24 2015 UTC,"Sean mentioned a number of factors that were changed for the E3 build, but the planets' terrain was not something he said was changed.  It's entirely possible that he did, sure, but we're worried that what we've seen is what we're getting as far as the shapes of land masses."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,3rd-wheel,3,Mon Jul 20 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"True. People keep thinking that the version of the game that is being showcased in the IGN First is some sort of final build. It is not, it is exclusively the E3 demo build. This was intentionally created to include a few planets only that they could make sure looked nice, were close together, and functioned because they needed to show it off.  We'll have to wait for the release or further, non-IGNF/E3 build footage before we can speak of anything."

Well, I mean theres nothing wrong with mentioning that it's a relevant factor, but this....    E3 build. E3 build. E3 build. E3 build. E3 build. E3 build. E3 build. E3 build. E3 build. E3 build.

These planets are hand picked and modded to show case all that the game could potentially have.  In the release planets too far from the star or close will be barren and have no water.  Not all planets will have a liquid and some could even be ice or poisonous planets.  We're getting a glimpse of what won't be common planets to find.  This is why many are clamoring for a demo/vid of the barren planets, or the planets we'll be seeing most of the time while exploring.   Edit: I forgot some words."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0a1d,BesideG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, it looks a little ""generated"" on the grand scale. On the same time, quite possible. We don't know how hard that bedrock is or if the liquid is water only.   If this planet earlier in its life was close to its sun or another large body, the liquid would have been pulled around and around the planet, much like that waterplanet in interstellar. That would wear down the surface and could very well produce something like it.  A planet with large star-shapes all over it would be much harder (for me) to explain. Since it is sci-fi I could handle a few of them though. :-)  As long as there's a good amount of variation I don't mind if some perlin noise shine through. Might be the case in real life too."

If you blow a single hole in the dirt and it's only saved locally (I assume that means only you can see the hole), what happens if you and a ""friend"" occupy this same spot?

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3ybm,devinup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"That all makes sense.  But, Sean also mentioned the fact that you could technically deplete a planet's resources, which are rocks, trees, etc.  So if you are slowly depleting a planet's resources, are those resources becoming less and less for everyone else in the universe as well?  They would have to right?  Which brings me back to my first question, how are they displaying this?  If an area of a planet has 100 rocks, all of which I've blown up and taken resources from, then are all those rocks gone for other players, since they presumably will encounter a planet with less resources now that I took a bunch?  (given, 100 rocks on a planet-sized planet is not a lot, I know this)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e3ybm,devinup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"There's some kind of threshold level of activity that makes your changes universal. I don't think anyone other than the developers knows exactly what that is. At first, some small mining won't affect everyone. Then at some point (not sure when exactly) your mining of resources or other activity becomes so large that it is saved globally. I just don't know if that's 10 nodes or 100 nodes or 18.4 quintillion nodes. Although it's probably not that high. ;)"

Either way, chances are that not too many people are going to step foot on the same planet so it may end up not mattering all that much in the long run."

Maybe by sending out signals which may or may not reach anyone else...but if they did, you could link up in conversation with them (which may take weeks or months in real time.  In which we could then relay coordinates as to our where-abouts.  Not sure what the Coordinates would consist of, it could be legitimate numbers based on where you are in the galaxy, or it could be something the player has to figure out on their own as far as the best way to relay where they are in the galaxy, be it by informing the other player what systems they're closest too or what not."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1lx6,Curratum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:25 2015 UTC,"I really love the effort it apparently takes to dock and use the hyperspace jump (I don't know what it's called in-fiction) and would love to use similar mechanisms, but the rest of the universe just seems bland. Even only being able to own one ship is bleh.  At least in NMS you're continuously upgrading your ship, so there's an intuitive and integrated goal to owning it as opposed to being a generic tool. (I feel the NMS upgrade system is superior in its originality, I would be surprised if E:D didn't allow some kind of modularization)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1lx6,handstobattlestation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"Most of what you just said about E:D is already in the game (unless I misunderstood you).  You can own multiple ships. You can upgrade a great many aspects of each ship.  I bought the game because I was waiting for NMS to come out and I wanted to scratch an itch.  Personally, I'm not that into E:D.  The missions are repetitive, Fight this, Get that, Trade this, Deliver that.    Not being able to land on planets takes the fun out of exploring for me. And the in-system flying is really quite boring, although, I do understand that it is a space flight simulator.. so I guess that's par for the course."

As I recall after release you could only own one at a time, but I could be completely mistaken.  Yeah, it seemed a little shallow (unfortunately) though I loved the idea of it. I just wish there was more content. The fact that they're already trying to spread to multiple platforms pushes me further away simply because those resources could be used to continue fleshing out the game."

There will be more space games, and plenty of them will be simulator-y!"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1lx6,handstobattlestation,3,Tue Jul 21 16:49:15 2015 UTC,I never thought of immersion being about realism. To me at least its about consistency and a kind of logic to the world (not necessarily the logic of OUR world).  I don't really have problems with what we've seen so far though. Edit: Except maybe the fact that you can see outer space before even passing the clouds and the patchy island planets thing but seriously this games offers too much for me to pay too much attention to that!

I can, in a small way, fulfill my dream of being a legendary bounty hunter like Boba Fett or be a badass smuggler like Han Solo. It may not be perfect, but my imagination will make it so.  To pass the time, I also started picking up a few classic sci-fi, fantasy books to dig into. It really helps with the release date woes. hah  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJk8ZiaUwAE3MJD.jpg  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJk8Zn2UYAAFDVA.jpg  It will be so cool seeing what other adventurers encounter on their travels.

Unless there was an actual indication that he tried to but failed?   But like you said, if it doesn't go very high, then there would be a lot of places we could get stuck, which is supposed to be a bug. So I'm guessing the jetpack will allow us to go further than we've seen so far.  And I have also thought about how Sean said about the jetpack being an upgrade, but that was a long time ago, back when the ship calling feature was in. That feature would have helped stop us getting stranded, but now that they've removed it, I'm wondering if they're going to give the player the jetpack from the beginning. It would certainly make sense, because otherwise I can see people getting stranded before they get the jetpack."

I don't see any way that you'd be able to get back up without the jetpack, which in theory should be a bug according to Sean... unless they would just class that as being stupid or something. In theory you could kill yourself, but I wonder how hard that might be on planets without anything that might attack you. Or maybe there will be an option to respawn back at the ship and lose your progress. I'm curious about this now."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyni0,vyper248,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, you are correct.  He has mentioned when you die you respawn at your ship before.  BUT he has said in at least one interview that there is no fall damage. Â  So I guess if you fall off one of those floating islands and can't get back up there, you have to cause a ruckus and get sententials to kill you to get back to your ship! Â  We figured it out! ;)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyni0,Dizman7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"Lol, yeah that's certainly one way to do it, but what if it's a planet with no sentinels or life? There could actually be no way to kill yourself. I'm still hopeful that the jetpack will be powerful enough though. Imagine if we get stuck somewhere and have to start again!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyni0,vyper248,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:18:59 2015 UTC,This brings up another question. Will each planet have a different mass (affects gravity?

Sorry, that's just how it seems to me.   Doesn't mean I'm not really excited about the game, I'm just realistic about my reaction.

But also because even though I'll have seen a great variety of planets on my way to the centre, I'm still sure that there'll be some amazing planets that have yet to be discovered. Or I might see if anyone else has found something really cool and start a new journey there.  That being said, I may not play it as frequently at that point, depending what other games I want to start playing, so it may just be a game I play when I feel like doing some exploring, when I just want to pick up and play something that doesn't require much time or effort."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1s0s,NickJosue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:30:49 2015 UTC,"Infinite exploration is honestly not that great.  Look at minecraft, now granted it's nowhere near as big as NMS, but that's not the point.  MC can generate a billion worlds for you to explore, and yet after playing through a dozen of them you would have already seen everything.  That's why people play it for the crafting and multiplayer instead of exploration.  NMS will probably be the same way.  There may be different planets and creatures, but you will have seen all the ""parts"" after a few hours of playing.  Just like with any electronics nowadays, you can create a billion different combinations, but in the end it's still a phone that you have seen, understand, and probably are familiar with."

Having said that - Impressive presentation by Hazel!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2fvl,ahref,6,Tue Jul 21 13:38:21 2015 UTC,"Unfourtunately presentations and the sharing of knowledge is a good thing.  By this logic i assume you expect these guys to not sleep, not take breaks and not have a social life.  Hazel might of taken time off to go to this talk.  Regardless its a development TEAM when members are absent the team still functions."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2fvl,John_Spamos,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see the correlation between these kind of presentations and not eating or sleeping.  My only point is that this excellent presentation would have made more sense to me if it pertained to a complete product, celebrating an achievement we could all gauge ourselves. I guess this is part of information age ""creep"" factor - Everything gets out there quicker these days, including celebratory presentations before products are even released."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2fvl,ahref,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:09 2015 UTC,The functional parts she presented are finished.  The game release is irrelevant to the talk. They could of done that talk with the Tech Demo last year.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2fvl,Linkdead404,4,Tue Jul 21 13:51:54 2015 UTC,"They've said the game is basically finished... and if they're doing press passes, press tours...that's big, and needed."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,ElHayseus,4,Tue Jul 21 15:24:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. Don't forget about the GI interview where Sean thinks we'll be expecting things that aren't actually in the game.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,jayytea,4,Tue Jul 21 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"What??? no jump puzzleS?? but super mario 3 had that come on HG get with the times. Where's my joe danger minigame? Why can't i jump on a ship and capture it? Wait, there's no galactic diplomacy? How will this be any fun if I can't build a space station. I hope the DLC has raid parties and private lobbies. Which button to melee? There MUST be some way to craft a star destroyer. Will suit upgrade to Force push and Force lightning? There should be an option to start in the center of the galaxy and work you way out. There should be a way to start missions and bounties. I'd like to see a whole planet that's a big dungeon and there's a dragon in the center you have to fight. Can't find the graveyard planet where you get the hookshot. This game is too easy. This game is too hard. This game is too long. This game is too boring. This game doesn't have anything other than planets with many tiny islands. The release date should be on my birthday."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,derfloh205,0,Tue Jul 21 16:12:32 2015 UTC,Point taken.. Though I challenge you to show me a sci-fi game without some element of problem solving. I may have overstated what I expect.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,formlessfish,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:19 2015 UTC,Does mass effect have any puzzles? Problem solving can be a broad term. Just deciding whether a planet is worth your time to land on and discover is technically problem solving.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,DoctorLovejuice,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say puzzles, but it does have the mini-mini-games for hacking into electronic modules, doors, safes etc."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,darkautumnhour,2,Tue Jul 21 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"I was just joking around. I think what excites most people about this game is that there is not another sci fi game like it. Puzzles in this game are going to be implicit: where do i find the resources, tech, etc, to upgrade my suit/ship/tool to do what I need it to do. explicit puzzles cater more to linear game play: Find the thing, take it to the place, flip the switch, unlock the door, navigate the maze, fight the boss, get the loot. These have to be designed, dare i say, scripted.   The whole draw for NMS is no scripting. If you want puzzles you'll have to make them for yourself. The whole game is generated with noise functions and maths. There are some amazing puzzle solving games out there, why would the one game that promises a non-linear experience waste time scripting a few turn key puzzles to pepper around unfathomably massive procedural galaxy?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,AyAyRon_R,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I should take care to not expect too much. Though I think he was more referring to ""can I have a zoo and battle animals that I find?"" more than the somewhat common idea of barriers to your rewards in video games."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,NekoMadeOfWaifus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"That's because what has been shown so far has been very vague. He gives us these little tidbits but then claims that there is more, so people speculate wildly. If he doesn't want over hype like Destiny, he needs to tell IGN to make it more clear."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:59 2015 UTC,"Low expectations, and you win in life."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,Avohaj,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I'll definitely enjoy the game regardless, it's just that Sean has mentioned multiple times that there are themes scattered throughout the game that he thinks most people will pick up on. He's also stressed that this wasn't meant to be a ""procedural game"", it's meant to be a sci-fi game first and foremost. I don't think it's very sci-fi to stumble upon valuables in an alien ruin or in a smoking freighter without some difficulty."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,carminejr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:22 2015 UTC,"I think I actually do agree with that sentiment; finding ancient relics, buildings and crashed ships should be a bit more difficult to access beyond ""press UP to interact"" - but this is because I love and play a lot of sci fi games. If it is a ""press X to open"" then that's fine aswell, we shouldn't really apply other sci-fi tropes to this game as it really is its own beast and should be approached as such."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,DandiestSquid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:11 2015 UTC,I'm so glad to see more people being (open) cautiously optimistic about the game instead of all hype.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,Avohaj,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Long ago, I read/heard in a video that each star system will have some kind of underlying challenge to complete. No objectives, no missions, but one big thing to accomplish. Who knows what it is? Could be a discovery (ruins, crashed ship, rare animal, etc.), could be defeating a pirate party, could be something completely different (especially deeper into the galaxy). There could be somewhat puzzle-like things, but not in a traditional sense."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,DurMan667,4,Tue Jul 21 15:33:20 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna agree with this, because I want to."

That sort of thing will more than satisfy the itch I'm trying and failing to describe here. Especially if these goals don't hold your hand and pop up on your HUD, I think that would be a wonderful surprise."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,wydraz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:19 2015 UTC,"At least some technologies will be in those ""chests"" we've seen mostly underwater in several videos/screenshots. That's based on one of the recent IGN First videos (not sure if it was the 404'd one) where the guy playing finally interacted with one of those boxes.  This also fits in with them never talking about them and at least once actively ignoring them - as they don't want (future) players to know too much before they get to play themself."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,Keegman_99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"There won't be any puzzles in the game at launch. I don't have a source on that, but I'm certain of it. They've spent all their time making the game mechanics work and getting the galaxy to look good instead of focusing efforts on minigames.  That said, they're planning to keep on developing NMS after release, as long as the game's popular, and keep adding gameplay features. Who knows what those new things might be?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2v4a,MHasho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:21 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for puzzle I think/hope that finding a way to the center of the galaxy might be one. Finding resources to upgrade your ship/suits, finding a path etc."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Nicholost,30,Mon Jul 20 16:26:39 2015 UTC,They were not finished when these videos were created.  I highly doubt they were filmed recently.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Pb_and_Jamerson,22,Mon Jul 20 16:55:44 2015 UTC,These were filmed at E3 I believe. Roughly a month ago.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Murrdogg,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"And there has been at least one article basically stating that the ""life variable"" or however it's phrased was turned up for those builds"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:35 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Murrdogg said, one of the articles (I can't think of which) did indeed say that the E3 build had some changes which effectively squeezed a lot more stuff into a smaller space, so lush worlds were far, far more common to be found than they normally would - they did this in order to actually show the public something."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,bendman,3,Mon Jul 20 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"This video sounded as if someone was playing Spore in the background, and I found the sounds in Spore were a big part of what killed the game. The continuous squeaky drone of every animal made the ambiance annoying."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,sepen_,6,Mon Jul 20 23:13:15 2015 UTC,"Also how his mind jumped from hearing ""That's a terrible sound!"" on IGN slaughtering the animal to ""sound system critique/will be better in the final game"". Always on the job!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,simonk83,13,Mon Jul 20 19:48:05 2015 UTC,"They weren't saying the sound was bad, just that the noise the poor creature made when he slaughtered it was terrible (like heartbreaking)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,sepen_,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:16 2015 UTC,"Nobody said any different.   Just Sean's mind was in developer mode, and his later sound systems comment was very likely triggered by the aforementioned."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,legna20v,10,Tue Jul 21 13:58:17 2015 UTC,if you notes his face .. Sean is freaking out about everything the stupid reporter is doing   analyzing every frame.  to think everything we saw was procedural generated .. is a shame he didnt shot in the water or try to see what was that building ... Dan would have try   why didnt  Dan Stapleton or  Brad Shoemaker from GB do this interview ?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,symon_says,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, very weird to give this interview to someone who is not even good at trying the game in front of him. The same thing happened on one of the interviews for The Witness. There are people out there who wouldn't look like a total dope just because this is an unconventional game. The line ""most people don't really look around or think about where they're going when they start"" is so telling of this guy's experience taking this game around. He puts it a lot nicer than I would."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,volca02,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:13 2015 UTC,They are probably playing a build specifically prepared for the event. Code repository will often contain potentially unstable changes. This one may be a bit older but is tested to work well.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,grgisme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"Actually re-listening to the video, he doesn't say they'll be ""better"". He says they'll be ""more varied"". Big difference there. Hopefully this will equal ""better"" though."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,hilightnotes,31,Tue Jul 21 00:19:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah just to be clear, IGN posted two, different videos today (one of which from what I understand is the leaked video - that would be the 'hands on' one, while the 'exploration' one is entirely new). It is slightly misleading because both videos posted today start and end the same way, but the gameplay content in between is entirely different."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,voltronranger,4,Mon Jul 20 16:23:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for clearing that up. I had no idea they released a second one!
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,hilightnotes,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:20 2015 UTC,links?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,voltronranger,7,Mon Jul 20 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"My post is outdated. IGN apparently did not intend to release two videos, and deleted the first one. The one that they left up is the video that was not previously leaked, and the link is accessed by clicking the title of this Reddit post.  I suspect that they had originally planned for - what became - the leaked video to release today. But due to it's leak chopped together a different video instead (which they perhaps were planning to release wednesday and instead we'll get a written fluff piece then). But they probably didn't properly cancel the automatic posting of the initial leaked video, resulting in both videos popping onto their site today, until they fixed the error.  That's just my guess. Maybe totally off."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,hilightnotes,3,Mon Jul 20 18:20:16 2015 UTC,gotcha. Now i'm hoping someone snagged the leaked video before they removed it.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Steve_the_Scout,4,Mon Jul 20 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"The leaked video I mentioned is the one that was leaked a week or two ago. It was snagged then. I'm not sure if you can still find it, but it didn't have anything new really so I wouldn't worry about it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,grgisme,3,Mon Jul 20 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"The start and end were probably scripted, and they probably did a re-recording because the first didn't show much."

Â  I liked that Ryan was able to amaze the creator of the game ( a game that has millions of planets) with something he'd never seen before.....""landing"" the ship on a structure, ha ha. Â  Nice of them to release TWO videos, since the one had been leaked several times already.  They should probably change the name of one of them as they are worded VERY similar. Â  They both start similar, so they must have done a couple of takes, maybe they too felt the leaked one wasn't as interesting so they did a reshoot or something. Â  The jetpack seems like a MUST, I can't imagine navigating that planet without one, all those cliff/sharp edges.   Also good to see that grenade launcher can just tear up regular ground too, I thought maybe it could only destroy specific materials based on the previous video where he only shoots an area highlighted by the scanner. Â  Note that Sean mentions that the animal voices are different in the final build, so this is NOT the final build we are seeing in these videos."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,ahref,23,Mon Jul 20 16:36:36 2015 UTC,"He's mentioned in a couple of interviews that basically each dev on the team has their own version/build of the game, and then there is a master build.  So they work on their own parts, test, and tweak, then put them into the master when they feel they are good enough. Â  This seems to be one of the dev buids, as we see no signs of drowning for how long he was underwater.  But studios do this all the time, 99% of the demos you see at E3 or other events are usually 4+ months behind where the actual game development is at usually."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Dizman7,4,Mon Jul 20 16:44:59 2015 UTC,If you are wearing a space suit on the planet you wouldn't be drowning when you walk into the water in your spacesuit.  We don't yet know what gasses the player breathes so he will always be wearing a suit.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,squat251,5,Mon Jul 20 17:16:17 2015 UTC,"Ummm,.....Sean has mentioned in several interviews that you have to upgrade your suit to survive longer underwater.  And even told a story of how he drown trying to go deep underwater. Â  So it IS a gameplay mechanic, you can't swim infinitely in the final game, you have to upgrade your suit to survive longer underwater, so this is CLEARLY a dev build.  sheeesh"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,sciencebasedlife,8,Mon Jul 20 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"True, but it wasn't implied whether or not he drowned because he ran out of ""air"" or not. Perhaps you need to upgrade the suit to not get crushed by the pressure, or to survive the coldness.   We shouldn't assume that it's because it runs out of air."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,TheSaint3328,2,Mon Jul 20 17:50:51 2015 UTC,That kind of dynamic survival system would be so cool if it was implemented.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,nomansblade,5,Tue Jul 21 07:59:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe the need to upgrade your suit underwater has to do with pressure, not air supply. If there is a limited air supply, I hope the limit is generous, a modern rebreather can last several hours."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Dizman7,2,Mon Jul 20 17:41:17 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt this is a dev build, you wouldn't want to bring that to a huge presentation. This is most likely to me a special presentation build, all the features that are working and maybe a few changes to make it easier to play, Sean's talked before about how the build they present being different to how the game actually plays so as to show it off in the short time they're given. I'm very sceptical about it being a dev build."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,nomansblade,3,Mon Jul 20 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure in those same interviews he says it's a ""special dev build"".  Technically though any build that isn't release is a dev build though."

When you say this i think it is best if we keep this a accurate as possible, and although I don't know if this is the case(not at all!). This is not to be negative, because I hope the game came out yesterday. BUT, most times when teams make demo builds they focus on some key functions and make them as polished as possible for the demo builds. I know they picked a random planet but a developer could easily make a build where they would only have 10-20 different really polished planet/wild life/terrain types, and just alot of them. I hope they are really close to release, but in reality we can't really tell from these demos.  I know alot of people thinks the release date will come at the end of IGN First. But I put my money on Gamescom. This is just 6 days after IGN first, so not a really big deal.  EDIT: Oh, by the way. It could also be the other way around, the game could be miles away from this demo, this is just the demo they always use because they know it is ""stable""."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,agnl,2,Mon Jul 20 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see people talk about how they can't imagine it being released late this year or sometime next year I feel bad for Sean. From the interviews I think it's pretty obvious that they still have a bit of work to do, and he's mentioned not wanting to disappoint the gamers with a release date several times but people tend to ignore or spin it to fit their wanting the game right this second. They're probably over there killing themselves trying to meet the communities ridiculous amount of hype for having the game immediately trying to get it out as soon as possible. I say let them have fun making it and make the best game they can"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,beastman77paul,7,Mon Jul 20 18:47:47 2015 UTC,"While I agree with your sentiment of no pressure, I would say it's be stupid to generate the amount of hype they've generated via tons of interviews, features in magazines, IGN first, etc if the release date wasn't soon. They've generated this much hype very intentionally."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,4cdbast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:00 2015 UTC,Maybe it's because of the Sony partnership
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,TrumpeterSwann,2,Tue Jul 21 06:01:02 2015 UTC,"Sean also mentioned that he wouldn't announce a release until the game was finished and we know he wanted to announce the release date a month ago, and then said we would have one soon. That's not something someone who's avoided commenting on it before without a finished product says. People aren't just wishfully thinking, it's based on things like he has said and the sheer amount of press they are getting for free, because they don't have actually have a marketing budget. If the sheer amount of press it's getting doesn't come followed by the actual games quickly enough they'll totally lose momentum. I think the IGN thing literally was offered at e3 hence the 'it's out of their hands'. Does anyone else not find it a bit weird they filmed the first bit of IGN first at midnight the first night of e3? Seems a bit last minute to me"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,thefixer9,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"I just find it weird that something like the animal noises would change a huge deal if the game's going to be released soon.   Know that sound design, music, and sound effects are usually one of the last things to be set in stone. It is extremely common to use placeholder sounds or a small subset of the planned media set during development. I can't say anything about the state of the game, but it seems like the game is in the ""polishing"" phase, if sound is a concern."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,ShiraCheshire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:42 2015 UTC,"I am a programmer and I can tell you that the order of tasks don't always follow a logical pattern to an outsider.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Kantham,4,Mon Jul 20 16:37:12 2015 UTC,It was also cool to see some new geography. The crater type thing with water in it that was in the middle of the first land mass he landed on was pretty cool.   I'm so ready to explore this game for myself.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,root88,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:20 2015 UTC,it's obviously a scrapped take that they uploaded to make up for the fact we all had seen the leaked one.  It just proves videos are a lot better without some idiot yammering about nothing in the background.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Dizman7,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:35 2015 UTC,I really hope there is a ship upgrade that autopilots it back to you. Walking a mile out and then having to retrace your steps over things you have already seen doesn't seem very fun.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,EveryReplyProcedural,2,Mon Jul 20 19:51:08 2015 UTC,"Apparently early builds of the game had a feature where you'd press a button and whistle, which would call your ship over to you.

Personally, I'm glad they did. I loved how he talked about people being forced to use skills that they don't typically use in video games and think of the terrain as one would in real life.   It's worth pointing out that there's no requirement you need to re-trace your steps. The IGN player is absolutely terrible at playing this game. Just make a circle. Since the game creates a waypoint where your ship is, you can wander all you want and still get back to your ship. Or - just upload everything to the Atlas and then commit suicide.

Both videos are probably from one play session. The video above was probably him getting a feel for the game and Sean explaining how the game worked. The other video was probably for him to actually film the segment. Those reactions were probably from the video above that they edited into the other video. They probably weren't planning on releasing this one, but the other one got leaked, so whatever. Probably.    How did he lose the wanted level?   By hiding from the sentinels (robots), probably while he was under water.    What hit him before he buried the dead animal?    Probably a sentinel (robot) for accumulating a wanted level from killing those animals.    What was the building for (and why the hell didn't he inspect it?)   No idea because he didn't inspect it and he didn't inspect it because Ryan is a chump. (No probably here)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,solethprime,2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"By hiding from the sentinels   Could be. My suspicion is he escaped with the power of video editing. Rewatched it. You are correct!   By hiding from the sentinels (robots), probably while he was under water.    If it was a sentinel I'd be surprised how fast the sentinel lost interest.   No idea because he didn't inspect it and he didn't inspect it because Ryan is a chump. (No probably here)   Agreed."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,redditratman,5,Mon Jul 20 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"*I'm not really sure. It seems they're reusing past footage of the guys.   *Sean has stated before that you can evade the Sentinels after a while. It was probably because he didn't resist.  *Pretty sure that was a Sentinel attacking him. Could have been another animal.  *Sean may have said something to them before like, ""If you see anything super interesting, ignore it."" Probably to keep some mystery to the game. That may also explain the downed ship he ignored in the leaked vid."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,bodavid,4,Mon Jul 20 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"1- Wanted level was lost by hiding underwater from the sentinels (as in GTA style)  2- The hit markers were from a sentinel shooting at Ryan, if you listen closely you can hear it hovering and shooting.  3- No clue. Maybe Peter Molyneux hides inside"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,redditratman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"At 3:51 the wanted level just disappears. I think he lost it by not shooting anything, like maybe the sentinels aren't shooting to kill every time, unlike the LSPD in GTA V. That would be nice."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,ahref,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"That's very possible! Maybe when you do not commit any more ""crimes"", the sentinels leave you be."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,_therealchin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:36 2015 UTC,He lost it by evasion. Same as you would in GTA.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,DoctorLovejuice,9,Mon Jul 20 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"Better than the leaked video.    If a lot of people find this boring, I imagine for most it's like if you were sitting behind a caution tape watching someone exploring an ancient ruin or cave or something.  Unless you're the one actually exploring it, you're probably going to get bored."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Malevolent_Force,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"I think people crave a hearty ""success!"" Moment, and when all they do is discover and explore, there is little room for the ""wow"" factor. Thus, people get bored.  But yes, if it's not them playing, they will undoubtedly find it boring, which is a shame, I thought the video was cool regardless. 20 days into July and I'm not sure what people were really expecting after seeing multiple videos from IGN already"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,EEKman,16,Mon Jul 20 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"Never wanted to rip the controller from someone's hands soooooo very badly as this   I bet it would be hard though, you get a set amount of time with NMS, you've been planning this  aaaaaaaaand when you get there, it's so exciting the plans fall out of your head and you act like a puppy on its first walk   trying to sniff everything at once   .  Some day you or I will be captain of the NMS Controller, then shit will get done"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,thetruth1998,3,Mon Jul 20 19:52:18 2015 UTC,My thoughts too. It was really tight and playing on pc with that fov won't be the most pleasant.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Koneesha,5,Tue Jul 21 04:46:49 2015 UTC,"Loved the video, a few comments and ""bugs""   Heavy breathing - does that indicate fatigue or toxicity? Either way nice touch.  What's up with the planet behind at 0:52 it seems to be rendered incorrectly - half in colour, half in grey (dark side) with a very abrupt change at the point its dark. The planet he looks at at 1:10 appears to have clouds on the sunny side and none on the dark side. But! Our water planet has no clouds from orbit... :( at 1:51 when he lands we see clouds in the sky from below. The change in island shape from 1:41 to 1:44 seems pretty drastic, fade/pop-in ofc but still its showing terrain at one level and none at the next LOD. Not a single crystal structure or animal visible when in the ship at 1:48, shame because the view distance on the crystals while on the ground is pretty far. His Lazeus ""count"" goes from 3 to 2 when he blasts the terrain at 2:22 But jumps from 2 to 0 at 3:02 when he blasts again, shame about the floating rock, wonder why it jumped down 2 points? He then has to reload his tool and it goes back up to 6 at 3:12. He shoots the terrain and it drops to 5. Love the ground textures, would be cool if they had more ""bump mapping"" to them. The animal shadows are cool but don't seem strong enough where their feet touch the floor? Same with vegetation clutter. Something doesn't look right with the lighting there around 3:37 Crystals hanging from the overhang at 5:35... nice   Loved the underwater sequence though, they have done a great job there. The lighting on the scales of the fish, very nice."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,agentnico,3,Mon Jul 20 20:02:10 2015 UTC,I'd say this was probably like an hour of game play edited down to six minutes and it could explain a lot of your issues if it is
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Werebaer,4,Tue Jul 21 03:45:52 2015 UTC,These videos have got me anticipating the release even more... so I don't have to endure IGN.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,TheNoyZ1,4,Mon Jul 20 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"""So much more all month long"" month is almost done, and they haven't shown much. :("
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,teaminus,4,Mon Jul 20 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who absolutely LOVED those formations? The water caves and the over-arching terrain features over covered pools of water that lead to the bigger ocean? Wow. I'm so excited for this game, I can't even describe it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,devinup,2,Mon Jul 20 20:30:11 2015 UTC,That feature was particularly cool. First time we have seen anything like it.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,odusanyaka,3,Mon Jul 20 21:48:55 2015 UTC,Okay that video was pretty cool. That landing. The water. Collecting cubes.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,RBedlam,3,Mon Jul 20 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks Hipolipolopigus for the links to a decent video player!  So it's great to have a new video, but seriously, how is this IGN guy so bad at playing?! ""Hey! There's an awesome building right there, how about I murder these animals instead of looking at it?"" Ugh. I was glad to see some swimming though and it was mildly interesting to see him pick up those cubes. Mostly though I just kept hoping he would spontaneously combust so Sean could take the controller and show us some decent gameplay...   I was surprised by how enormous the craters he was creating were. I didn't expect it to be quite so easy to dig around. Seriously, I'm dying to know about that building! I'm pretty sure it had a waypoint on it too. But scanning those fish twice was definitely a better idea...."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,ConnerVonHerd,3,Mon Jul 20 21:46:31 2015 UTC,"Loved looking at another slice of gameplay, and examining the graphics up close. I'm happy with the way things look. Slightly blocky, but very sharp and pretty. Exactly what I expect from an indie game of the nature.  It's just a shame they let this guy demo it. Surely a seasoned gamer would have picked up the controls a little faster? He seems totally lost with his direction and control."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,HaleMorne,2,Mon Jul 20 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"I love it how the people over at r/ps4 are complaining about the graphics and saying its ""pure indie"" while mean while over at r/nomanskythegame our heads are exploding from 6 minutes of footage. :)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Blue_Blazer_NZ,3,Mon Jul 20 23:13:08 2015 UTC,"This IGN guy apparently can only find Oceanic planets with goat-like lifeforms. Cool video though, I've been wanting to see what's in those ""loot crates"" you see lying around. I did wish he'd taken a closer look at that structure in the beginning."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Flaming-Driptray,3,Tue Jul 21 00:38:38 2015 UTC,"I really wish it was just raw gameplay footage with Sean at the controls, showing and telling us interesting stuff...that's all I'm asking for."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,southern-oracle,3,Tue Jul 21 02:01:00 2015 UTC,So glad they didn't just run over the same footage in the leaked video.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Whats_upchuck,9,Tue Jul 21 03:16:15 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or do almost all of the planets just look like spheres with spots all over them when viewed from space?  Seems like there should be more varied landmass sizes instead of just little islands spread over the entire planet.  When you look at the planets and moons we've actually visited with probes and compare them to the NMS planets we've seen you really start to see how artificial things look.   Don't get me wrong I'm incredibly excited for the game, but I am just a bit disappointed in the repeating patterns seen on the planets shown so far.  Hopefully that will improve by release."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,JiffyPants,3,Mon Jul 20 16:38:26 2015 UTC,I was/am a little concerned about this.  BUT I'm thinking that this is for the E3/press build so that we don't get a full sense of what could be out there and ruin the surprise before release.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,_swamp,7,Mon Jul 20 20:01:10 2015 UTC,"We've only seen what Hello Games has wanted us to see. I'm sure there will be TONS of variety in the game, they just want us to discover it for ourselves.   EDIT: I realize that Hello Games could show us some more weird, interesting planets, but they don't want to. Sean Murray is all about letting the player have an amazing experience in the game, discovering things for themselves, and it will be so breathtaking when we finally see those varied and amazing planets in game, rather than on a gameplay video of someone else playing."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,shiny_dunsparce,6,Mon Jul 20 17:33:16 2015 UTC,Surely if there's tons of variety then they could show us one or two planets that aren't essentially the same as we've already been shown. I don't see how that would take away any of the fun we'd have exploring.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,tigress666,2,Tue Jul 21 00:41:07 2015 UTC,"when theres literally quintillions of planets, i think they can afford to show something a little different"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,bantamsam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:15:25 2015 UTC,That's what I've noticed of the planets they showed us recently since E3. The footage I've seen before didn't have that so much (but it's also much older). I'm hoping not cause I find a lot of islands type planets/maps kinda boring. I want a big landmass.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,glitternarwhal,2,Mon Jul 20 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Can't see it on the IGN site, is this a second video?"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,_swamp,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:42 2015 UTC,fairly certain they aren't allowed to do anything cool to keep the suspense up.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Travis358,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:43:38 2015 UTC,"Well, he's said a few times that modern games give too much away, so any semblance of suspense is gone by the time you buy the game, and that he doesn't want to do that. So I'd assume that carries over to these game play videos, and all the other media they've shown us."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,ahref,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"This video seems like it wasn't edited as much, like they kind of just used a old video they scrapped because of the leak.  Also there is noticeably more popping in and out of objects, the planets almost looked pixilated.  There are way more artifacts compared to the other gameplay"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,blindfire40,3,Mon Jul 20 16:40:36 2015 UTC,Are those technology components something you sell to purchase an upgrade? Or are they upgrades themselves?  Plus any idea what the function of the technology he found is; the plasma core casing.  Is it a ship upgrade?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,ahref,5,Mon Jul 20 16:41:58 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/uHfJkJr.jpg Should give you an idea. Its from one of the other videos.  It looks like the upgrades have numbers. The screenshot i posted is Plasma Core V  The screenshots ingame show VI.  Perhaps the UI screenshot one was VI too its cut off.  Confusingly though in the UI it shows the upgrade requiring 100 of Cb and then in the Video they collect 100 components :S
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,NMS1,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"I believe that the ""components"" they collect in today's video go towards unlocking the upgrade, whereas the 100 Cb would build the upgrade. That's what it seems like to me, and that would be consistent with what's already known."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,Northdistortion,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, so it's pretty obvious that this is the actual continuation of the 18 minute video but they also recorded another one for whatever reason which turned out to be both boring and leaked :)   They probably never intended to show that one (as it was so nothing) but IGN Italy or whoever it was stuffed up.  Looks like they've taken the end of that video and edited it on to the end of this one (you can be a trader, a space.....pirate, etc etc).  That's fine, pretty normal for this stuff.  Good anyway, this was much more interesting (though still frustrating watching that guy not know how to play video games)."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,windsorwork,4,Tue Jul 21 00:41:09 2015 UTC,I made this to illustrate what I meant.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,crossfire024,3,Tue Jul 21 00:52:10 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there'll be planets with actual continents, or if every one is going to consist of isles spread around, or land only.  Interesting nonetheless. Really hope they'll put in some really difficult challenges for the high-end gear, because so far it seems like a pretty easy game throughout."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,BeegFish,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they'll have a much larger variety of planets than what we've been seeing. It seems like that's how they've been handling everything with the recent videos.  People complain that all the creatures look the same, the reason for that is probably because they're only showing 15-20 of the base models, where the game is supposed to have ""hundreds."" Same goes for ship variety. Even the grass/flora in the more recent builds seems downgraded, I'm especially talking about the ""flowers"" which are just like red silhouettes of plants, with no texture. I'm sure those are just in for debugging purposes, and will eventually just be a far LOD version of grass.  Planet variety will probably see a similar expansion in scope. So far we've seen just a few types of planets:  *Large landmass with no water.  *Large landmass with many lakes.  *Large ocean with many islands.  In the final version we'll probably see these plus:  *Giant ocean with several continents, and small islands.  *Single landmass with one to several large lakes, and some small ones.  *Giant ocean along the equator.  We will see those and many other things I couldn't think of."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyika,marian1,4,Mon Jul 20 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"Just keep in mind that we shouldn't necessarily expect more complex formations like that if there's no evidence the procedural generation can do that.

A two stage wanted level but no sentinels around so it was able to wear off after a minute or two.  Breathing sounds, both in and out of the water.  Shooting the ground at your feet didn't seem to do any damage to you.  Actually liked the 6 minutes of exploration over the leaked 6 minutes, felt like a bit more happened, not a ton, but little things."

Fuck all of these people behind me, I'm not going to introduce them at all, they're not humans."" Watch some of their faces when he only introduces Sean .... You can tell they're uncomfortable. He could have at least been like, ""Hi everyone, I'm sitting here with Sean and the some of these humans (who I think work for IGN?), here to play some NMS."" Or something like that...

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e2f0d,Linkdead404,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:09 2015 UTC,The discoveries have to be logged onto a beacon (this doesn't count the main planet discovery). The beacons upload discoveries to the greater community and gives you money to boot.   If you choose not to share it to the larger community then no one will know about what's there or the fact that you may have discovered it.

It's part of why I'm so excited for the game. It's not too often you get to see a creator of a game be so excited to have others get their hands on it. At least not in such a genuine way.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzrl8,agnoristos,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:30 2015 UTC,Seems kind of pointless for them to do this off the e3 build of the game.  The seed will likely change
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzrl8,blueExcess,2,Tue Jul 21 00:38:23 2015 UTC,"So I have a question that I didn't see answered before... Why is IGN is doing planet previews (from 17 Jul. video) and putting planets in a database if this is a preliminary build?  Wouldn't these planets potentially change drastically in the final ""locked in"" universe?  Didn't Sean say in one video that everyone at Hello Games has a different version of the universe on their computers?    I think IGN knows the release date, has played the final version, and I think the reason Sean couldn't say at E3 is because of a deal inked with IGN for the scoop."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzrl8,eltsoldier,5,Tue Jul 21 00:39:56 2015 UTC,"That's why this is so mind-boggling. The E3 build (like their other demo builds) was tuned with certain variables turned way up, like the probability -- and probably density -- of life on a given planet. The E3 build will not be the eventual game seed. Period.  IGN should know this seeing as it's kind of their jobs to research and report on games. Swing and a miss, strike 3 412."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzrl8,JeffreyArts,5,Mon Jul 20 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"You're mistaken. All of the information that IGN is trying to catalog is procedurally generated, then automatically saved locally and uploaded to their servers (this upload probably being miniscule, only containing a planet tag, the given name, and your ID).  IGN, however, wants to imput all of that manually for no adequately explored reason.  You can't spell ""IGNorant"" without IGN."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e05lu,pykaswitz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:53 2015 UTC,"Given how huge this universe is, I can't picture them being able to show case everything.  We already know that HG isn't wanting to steal that moment of discovery and awe from us.  I believe this sameness everyone is speaking about is just HG keeping the reins held back.  In short, we're only getting the slightest peak behind the curtain.  We are being shown only a tiny fraction of what this game will produce.  And I highly doubt they've kicked in the procedural math into full swing for these demos.  We already know they have tweaked the code to make sure what is shown won't be a wasteland and are designed to show off some eye-candy of sorts."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e05lu,Ledpoizn445,2,Tue Jul 21 05:18:11 2015 UTC,"While I totally agree that they're trying to keep things under the curtain, they are showing some of the best stuff of what they do what us to see. They've shown us planets with stations, but not what we actually do at the stations. He said, in the interview with GI in that build, they use that planet because ""it looks nice"". The chances of us finding a planet like that are relatively low. If I find one similar to that in my first ten systems I would be surprised."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e05lu,pykaswitz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  We are being shown the sweet spots and only a fraction of what the procedural math and rules can churn out.  What many people fail to realize is that with the size of this game it is near impossible to showcase every detail that could be seen.  That's part of why they say let's plays after release couldn't spoil the game for everyone...the universe is so massive that one person's experience will never be 100% duplicated thus spoiled by another player.    The other side of the coin is that we only see the ""cool"" stuff.  And so far have only see a small glimpse of a barren world (see IGN'S 5 plants video) and maybe some from screenshots. Because of this I think it is time demo less staged planets and more of what could be found regularly during normal game play."

If you're so tired and/or bored that you can't keep your eyes open, why the fuck would you sit on camera?  Secondly, how could the guy playing the game be so clueless?  That little horned thing was following and hurting him the ENTIRE time he was there and he didn't realize it until the very end.  Also, ""So that thing we could go up to?""

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,JohnSmith5782,8,Mon Jul 20 16:19:20 2015 UTC,Either that or maybe because he doesn't want IGN to spoil stuff.  Like exploring a crashed ship etc.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,Bynnh0j,3,Mon Jul 20 16:33:02 2015 UTC,As far as I know there are certain things they would like to see you do. They essentially give you a list of dos and don'ts then you go about and play the game. I think its a matter of that they want to show off gameplay and the procedural world but they don't want to show a ton because they still want things to be brand new to us. Some of these things people are saying they wish the player would go look at and explore I'm more excited to do it myself than have IGN spoil all my fun.

Ryan's voice is like something from a commercial trailer and you can just tell he's out of his depth with anything other than Call of Duty, he walks around in circles..literally. Does anyone know who the people at the back are? They don't seem to do anything other than fill up space.  Edit: quick few questions: did the grass look funny to anyone else? It seemed to have a lower graphical quality compared to everything else. Secondly, did anyone else notice the water moving when he was walking along the shore? I can't decide if that's a graphical glitch or waves. Overall the planet looks really impressive,just wish we could have seen some more of it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,flyinjahwaiian,7,Mon Jul 20 16:05:17 2015 UTC,It was so painful watching him cock up a landing and just start to kill things. Didn't even talk about the tech caches at the bottom of the lake.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,Griffin880,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Obviously, but it would be at least nice for the player to acknowledge that he's stumbled on something interesting. Could almost guarantee those drops will get more valuable the more isolated and difficult to reach they are."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,kotor610,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:19:21 2015 UTC,For sure. The new video shows him interact with the boxes though. Pretty neat.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,Kantham,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"Although I agree with you, I  think they may have removed some audio of them commenting while playing. That's the only reason I can think they wouldn't even MENTION the caches when he found them.  after thought: I liked seeing the bad landing. My mind compared it to the ""small"" bugs found in a lot of Bethesda games. Gave it a sense of still being rough around the edges and hopefully that means that they are still polishing up the final build."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,DeadeyeDuncan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"The water was most likely moving in waves. Or maybe it was changing its tide, I think Sean mentioned that in the video."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,thinkadrian,3,Mon Jul 20 16:01:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The same thing happens in EVE. If you're warping towards something and there are planets in your way, you'll warp straight through them, albeit a sort of hole or bubble is created through the planet from the warp pocket."

It would take light 300 years to travel that distance, and NMS does it in a matter of seconds. I'd say, we're already suspending the laws of physics a bit for that element of better gameplay.   space is pretty sparse   Real space is sparse, NMS we know is living in a far more rich and active environment.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,Valmorian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:13 2015 UTC,not that far being relative to space as a whole dumbass
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,ModdingCrash,-3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:17 2015 UTC,"So? How big is a meteor in width? How big is a planet? They are infinitesimally small compared to even half a light year. Your character and ship are even more tiny. It is a big distance, and just because you are for some reason relating it to the total size of space, doesn't diminish the fact that when we comprehend distances we view them in relation to distances we know. And comparably, 300 light years is a far distance to the distance it takes to travel a planet. My point is, in that 300 light years do we really expect to never pass through a solid object? 300ly was just a random number I pulled out for examples sake. Lets say it's 150,000,000,000 light years...Still think we should be complaining about warping through a planet? Will we never run the risk of warping through a physical object in that amount of space? Which, after all, is what this whole comment string is about.  Finally, I really fail to see why you immediately needed to start flaming me, as nothing in my previous post was intended to be hostile in the slightest."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,Valmorian,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"you're probably not even in the same dimension when you're warping. it's sci-fi, I'm sure they'll find a way. and btw, you could easily go 10,000 light years in space and not hit a single thing. space is really big.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyidk,FeralFizgig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"Space is really big, agreed, but again, this is NMS space, which is definitely more populated and dense for gameplay reasons. You could go 10,000ly and not hit anything, without a doubt, but we could also go 5ly and hit something, right? It makes sense, for gameplay and debugging purposes, that you enter a wormhole-like situation to warp, thus the going through a planet and/or not getting wrecked by something you'd normally collide with during the warp.  Honestly, what was 'dumbass' adding to the conversation? I guess I'm more just baffled by why someone's immediate reaction is to start calling people names instead of sticking to a rational, courteous discussion.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyiu8,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, the date hasn't been pushed back yet so for everyone who is excited for this game and has read those interviews, confirmed is confirmed and they probably find it annoying when the question is asked.   Sean's statement at E3 this year suggests that the game was close to release. He was going to announce a date. Something else jeopardized that announcement. So now we wait.   So, there's no point in speculating on the date because you have people saying it's confirmed 2015, the rules state not to post threads in the subject, and there's not enough info to suggest when they might release it, this year or otherwise.   That being said, maybe the negative responses people receive in asking the question is a bit unnecessary. However, we're all exasperated at the wait, and no one really knows when it's coming out. So it's pointless to ask."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyiu8,SenatorPikachu,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"I guess I've only watched interviews with Sean and I haven't heard him say 2015 when he's been asked. so thats why I asked for a source so I can read all about it or hear all about it.   So again, source? If it's common knowledge there should be lots of sources you can easily provide."

I don't want my opinion to be influenced at all while I'm playing just like when I was a kid I just want to play and form my own opinon and just enjoy.

I didn't preach it online that much (I have done a bit of that over the year it's been out but I wasn't bitching all over the forums right from the start, I was too busy playing)  Â   It didn't make the game feel any less fun though. I guess your experience was different because of how you initially didn't see all the things, then after you read about it online you suddenly noticed the flaws yourself and maybe that was worse."

I played the first two expansions in earnest but was already pretty burned out that by the time the whole Luke smith fiasco started I was completely burned out. All my clan mates were gone, lfg was getting to be slim pickings. It just all added up. I've had my fun, got my money out of this game, but it's not going to be the way I spend my time anymore."

NMS isn't, actually, trying to tell us anything. We are all hyping it, but all we know is that it's a giant universe where you will explore massive generated planets and finding aliens and plants. Well we also know there will be arcady space battles and trading.  We don't know anything more! If we believe this mechanic won't make us bored, then we won't be disappointed by the real game when it comes out!"

I miss the suspense and wonder in learning all about a game. I  will do my damnedest not to come back for 30 days after release.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0pgf,arnezami,5,Tue Jul 21 01:40:46 2015 UTC,"I saw this earlier and it made me wonder how the survival elements in NMS will work. Sean has said that survival is a part of this game, but from the videos we've seen it doesn't seem like the typical survival game where you have to eat and drink and gather resources every day to keep from dying. Obviously no need for shelter either, since you can't build anything."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0pgf,CurseHawking,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Everything so far seems like dying would be difficult to do (at least at the outer rim). Yet in his various interviews and speeches, he talks about how games are too easy these days and how he admires Dark Souls, etc., leading me to believe any game he has a hand in would be more slanted towards ""difficult""."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0pgf,grgisme,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"Hard doesn't have to equal die often IMO. Part of the challenge with this game will be how in do I progress, and what does that mean?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0pgf,darkautumnhour,2,Tue Jul 21 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"I agree -- I mentioned ""dying often"", because Sean specifically says in the Insomniac video that he found himself halfway through a recent COD storyline and realized he had just died for the first time, and he related to this as being too easy."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0pgf,grgisme,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:44 2015 UTC,"From what I got he refers mostly to how games usually hold your hand through the whole thing, not allowing you to figure out things by yourself."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0pgf,MuchStache,2,Tue Jul 21 05:56:37 2015 UTC,Possibly toxic resistant and radioactivity resistant suit upgrades dont give total immunity but instead give you a time limit away from your ship before you start taking damage. This would force you to be very careful to keep track of how quickly you can get back to your ship.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,jackjas02,26,Mon Jul 20 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"Personally I think they just spread the coverage too thin. I disagree with the notion they are trying to ""introduce"" more people to NMS. They could have done that with one article about most anticipated releases, and just linked to the e3 stage demo or one of the many trailers.  It's actually quite the opposite. IGN is trying to drive new traffic to their site. they're taking advantage of the massive wave of hype this game has generated to increase clicks on their page, thus ad revenue. They are farmin NMS fan clicks. Plain and simple. Right now, for the 22k people on this sub, IGN is using NMS to advertise IGN, not the otherway around.  Because honestly, if this was your first time hearing about NMS, how would you react to the video?   I can tell you my reaction ""Wow, okay, so this is this experimental, fluffly and cute, but utterly unplayable concept game of the year."" None of the game play footage has been compelling. If this were your first time hearing about NMS, I would turn you 180 degrees away from IGN and point you to the e3 stage demo. Why? Becayse the IGN sells the game short. It makes it look buggy, it doesn't give you a feel for the potential and instead, makes it feel like a fundamentally limiting experience.  TL;DR The coverage is simply spread too thin, I'll say it again. A month of coverage for this game would have been better excuted in four weekly features, with real editorial copy, with a variety of planets and mechanics in each video, would have introduced more players to the game. It just makes sense: One plate of fries is more satisfying then one fry, every day, for a month.  The micro vids they are shoveling out are designed to make current fans of NMS spend more time on IGN's site, plain and simple. This isn't coverage we're entitled to, but since it is fundamentally designed for us, future players, we are within our rights to be critical in a public forum."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,DoctorLovejuice,5,Mon Jul 20 19:25:10 2015 UTC,They're taking what could be a 15 minute long video and drawing it out over the course of a month while talking up their coverage and future coverage of it.  There's no new information because there is no significant information.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,SpaceShipRat,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"So? Are they not allowed to do that?  Stretching a story out over a month has ALWAYS been what IGN First is. They even say that when they first started over a year ago   Once you realise that the IGN First featurettes were always going to be half-baked and a bit hollow, then there is nothing to be too disappointed about, it's purely validated from your expectations alone.  This is more-or-less why I wasn't really particularly hyped about the IGN First being announced, purely because I had huge expectations for other features they had done and was slightly let down by them.  I'm not being nasty here, just realistic.   http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/05/30/presenting-ign-first-a-new-way-weare-covering-the-biggest-games  In simplest terms, think of IGN First as a story that lasts all month long.   What are you expecting?  Edit: The down votes have spoken and I removed my previous comments, and will do so for this one if it reaches the threshold as well, it's only fair,"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:19 2015 UTC,I was expecting something like Gameinformers' awesome coverage.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"Why?   It obviously comes down to the possibility that you haven't followed an IGN First before, right? I could be totally wrong in saying that, but logic would dictate, basically because this is what IGN first has done for many games (Destiny, Evolve, Rockband.) they all effectively followed the same thinly-spread formula that No Man's Sky has.   It's just surprising that anyone would expect any different if they knew how the IGN First features worked, that's all."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,mogi67,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's my first First, and it's taught me that IGN features are bad, I suppose now I know."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,mogi67,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:01 2015 UTC,Sure it doesn't matter. But having an opinion =/= entitlement
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,DoctorLovejuice,2,Tue Jul 21 06:46:25 2015 UTC,I'm not interested in semantics. Nowhere did I say I deserved anything from IGN. I could throw your reasoning back at you and say that you have a sense of entitlement because you expect people to be positive and jovial regardless of what IGN shows. I don't really get that line of thinking at all.  People are allowed to express themselves on this subreddit. That is the whole point of having a forum where people can discuss the game.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,Hofood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:53:41 2015 UTC,"I don't expect people to be jovial and positive, I expect people to know what the IGN First feature always has and always will be, which is effectively one story spread horrendously thin over a whole month, in order to prevent high expectations.   Pattern recognition - look back to what IGN First did with Destiny, Witcher 3, Evolve, and others. It was exactly the same."

Accept the facts that these videos are going to be light on information.  That's pre-launch hype in general, and we're still a long way from launch.  I think people like to complain in general and there isn't much new to talk about."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,Silvio257,5,Tue Jul 21 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I can't stand 99% of the 'gaming community'.   Generally the younger ones act like spoilt brats, the older one's act like pathetic tweenagers. And the IGN lot generally take computer games far too seriously and acerbate both extremes. Its a hobby, not a 'way of life'. The number of pro-gamers is morbidly low.  So whilst I agree that people do act immature, I also can agree that IGN coverage is woefully uninspiring. Granted, its free marketing for Hello Games which is, one would suspect, why they are doing this excruciatingly slow release coverage through them."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,SpaceShipRat,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:53 2015 UTC,I don't care. I will play the game. I will have fun.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,BananaHD910,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe if something sucks and we say it sucks, they'll make an effort to suck less next time.  Or maybe not, but at least we've had a chance to vent.  We don't have to ""appreciate"" something that sucks, what are we, beggars?  Besides, Seems to me people were pretty enthusiastic and thankful to have that backup video after the first got leaked. So it's not like we're just bashing and not recognizing the good stuff."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,nomansblade,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:34 2015 UTC,Those people that get disappointed by new info should just ignore it and avoid the videos. I just want a release date. So I don't watch the videos and I don't poop on ign.   Last I checked the ign coverage led to at least 7k more subs here I don't see how the coverage can be anything but a positive thing for this sub.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,Orion159,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:55 2015 UTC,"They're journalists, no they don't owe me anything but I should be able to expect them to do a good job otherwise people will take their interest in gaming elsewhere. No one's telling them to stop, what they are saying is that IGN needs to improve, I'm not going to pat them on the back for a terrible job. Walking around in circles doesn't exactly show off the game to it's full potential either if they're looking for new fans.   By the way saying ""Let this community continue to be a decent and friendly place"" having previously told people to ""stop crying"" and that they ""look like a immature spoiled person"" is a bit strange.  Personal Opinion on IGN coverage: It's been alright but Ryan seems completely baffled and some of the articles have had quality as low as some of kopstarz articles. At the moment it's about 60% awesome stuff and 40% rubbish stuff that doesn't get new people interested or hold anything for people knowledgable about the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,AstroLord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:11:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.  I agree with your first paragraph except that I was referring to people that just post things hating on IGN and doesn't seem to have a logical argument, think they 'deserve' better and because of that they can be rude. I like this game so much that I wasn't looking the coverage with very critical eyes, I was just happy by seeing new videos of the game and by the new people that saw the game on IGN and liked it subscribing to the sub.  I thought no one would be offended by my 'stop crying', I used this because it was the closer expression of what I was trying to say. (English is not my first language). Also, about the second, It's not that I told people looked that way, It's that by making the previous statements without logical arguments makes someone looks immature. Anyway thanks for the tip.  I disagree with your opinion especially because of the increasing number of members of the sub that indicates that the ign coverage in fact got new people interested."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,Dizman7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:02 2015 UTC,I'm just personally angry at IGN first because it's probably the reason that we didn't get a release date at E3.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz148,MelissaJuice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:38 2015 UTC,I'm still curious if they are not showing so much because they were not allowed to. Maybe they are only allowed to explore certain things and do certain things based off of what the development team wants. I'm sure they want us to discover many things on our own and not show too much. I could be wrong obviously but I feel like their hands are tied and they're not allowed to show many things we'd want to see.   It also seems like this footage was something they hurried. Like they didn't have much time and they threw it together late at night. I just want to give them the benefit of the doubt. I want to trust they're doing their best with what they have.

When you look at HG and NMS, what  you're seeing is a group of people who've already spent years, if not decades, shoveling other people's shit to get where they are. Nobody ever walks in and heads a creative department, but literally everyone expects to. That's not to say it's a bad idea, or you shouldn't do it, but you should anticipate several years of other people taking credit for your hard work and best ideas before you make it anywhere."

Select a simple goal (Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, 2048, Pong, Flappy Bird, Tetris,...) and try to program it. The language doesn't matter. Python, Java, Javascript, C# are all fine. https://www.codecademy.com/ is a good start.  Once you are fairly comfortable with coding, look at graphics stuff such as 2D canvas and the start using Unity."

If you want to be a level designer, artist, gameplay scripter, etc you don't even need a degree.  Most of what is looked at for those positions is portfolio.  Download Unreal Engine 4, start playing around, make some levels, and see if you like it.  If so learn as much as you can and become a part of the dev community and you might have a chance."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzk2w,charliebucket-,10,Mon Jul 20 20:23:03 2015 UTC,I honestly do not believe that NMS is being held back for a Morpheus release. It would be cool to have it work on Morpheus whenever the VR device comes out.   I think No Man's Sky will be released well before we get Morpheus.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzk2w,thinkadrian,2,Mon Jul 20 22:58:19 2015 UTC,Vr + jetpacks means your gonna have a bad time. Just saying.   VR in its current form works best for small scale and cockpit situations not traversing large areas on foot.   Would love to explore a world in vr or fly my ship in vr but to actually play the game would be.... a bit disorienting.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzk2w,daymanelite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:56 2015 UTC,Or you can just deal with it. Just because some people get sick doesn't mean everyone will.  Little bit of practice and I'm sure most will get over the nausea.  My biggest problem with VR currently is them trying to cater to the people that can't use it.  As a wheelchair user I love VR. It allows me to experience things I couldn't normally.  Pressing forward on a joystick to move forward is as natural as moving forward in the real world. That's literally walk forward for me. So it's totally something that you can adjust too.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzk2w,NoUpVotesForMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:41 2015 UTC,"Have you actually experienced being rift sick before? It is not something you should push through and ""deal with it"". You need to be careful with how you expose yourself and people as some peoples brains get scarred by the experience which causes them to feel sick by simply putting on a rift. It really really sucks. Its not about catering to people who can't use vr, its about making sure vr actually takes off and is not hucked into the same bin as motion controls. Too many sick users will do that.  Pressing forward on a stick is not as natural as walking for most I would say but that doesn't matter. I will say even people who say they don't feel anything exibit telltale signs of getting rift sick when I put them in something like alien isolation or minecrift.  Turning with a stick? Here is where the issues really start. There is a reason ""comfort mode"" exists in a lot of rift fps. Next on the menu.... jumping. Ever try Quake 2 vr? The amount of strafe jumping in that game will get to you.  As the movement becomes more unnatural the effect worsens. Jetpacks I imagine much worse.  Honestly after having my dk2 since september I can say that I can't wait for them to hijack my brain stem so I don't need to feel all this stupid feedback from my flesh bag. It seriously hinders my vr experience, moving my body around to look at stuff.  Slightly off-topic but I bet you hate this emphasis on ""room-scale"" vr and the motion controls to go with it that seems to be infecting vr. Like why waste research on that just go full SAO lmao."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzk2w,zfarrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:26 2015 UTC,Yea. And vr takes a lot of resources. I think it'll be too demanding for the ps4 to run NMS and morpheus at the same time.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzk2w,tinybadger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"NMS will not be a killer app for Morpheus because Sony knows that in order to sell Morpheus they need to provide someone with a familiar experience improved.  For a lot of people NMS will be something completely new.  Space sims and space games don't often come to consoles, and this game will be a totally new type of experience for many playing on the PS4.  Microsoft knows what they are doing with Hololens.  They have chosen Minecraft as the launch title for that device because tons of people are already comfortable and familiar with it.  Sony will most likely pick a FPS as a killer app for Morpheus.  Also Sony has stated that Morpheus is coming early 2016 and all evidence is that NMS is coming this year so...."

When the Oculus CV1 is released, you can be damn sure I'll be there to buy one and this game seems like it has MIND BOGGLING potential for the feelings you might feel when exploring virtual realms.  I plan to do whatever hacking and modding is necessary to experience NMS in stereoscopic VR.  I can't say I feel the same enthusiasm for Morpheus... I mean I hope it works out well and I hope it's successful but for the time being, PC is going to be light years ahead of consoles in VR capabilities.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0gur,Demos42,12,Tue Jul 21 00:30:01 2015 UTC,"Here's something interesting.   Notice how almost every planet ever shown since E3 (including the E3 planet) had water on it? And notice how they all had alien life that looked similar (the small dog/quadruped aliens or goats)   Even the planet from the 18 minute gameplay video had creatures and water very similar to all the rest, and both planets Ryan from IGN visited were the same, with similar creatures.  It's widely rumored and agreed on this subreddit that the E3 build is different, it's been confirmed that demo builds have the ""life cranked up"" so that they seem interesting during the demo so it's not like Sean will land on a rocky empty planet with nothing to talk about.   Check some older trailers and you'll see wayyy more variation, look at every clip (especially the short ones that flash by) and take note of the different terrain, environments, etc.   And those are the old trailers.  Ever wonder why we haven't had a gameplay demo of an icy planet? I almost forgot they existed. What about jungles? Or volcanic formations? Or rocky planets like Soleth Prime? What about planets with red water like we've seen? Orange water? Small lakes? Waterfalls? Floating islands in the sky?  The planets that we've seen lately are being seen for a reason. This isn't just randomly flying to 3 similar looking planets; in the new IGN video from today you can see 3 planets from outer space which all seem to have the same dotted-island, spotty environment.   Sean has confirmed so many different times that life will not be common, and that he wants to show as little as possible before the game is released.   I think we're being shown a very special build of the game, for a very specific purpose."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0gur,MHasho,5,Tue Jul 21 01:09:27 2015 UTC,"Haha this is almost conspiratorial in nature but I think this must be true. I was really struck by the sameness of all the planets from the video released today. All of your points make a lot of sense though so I'm guessing you're probably correct in this.   I did notice that the animals did all look more or less the same. I noticed it with the fish in particular. I had totally forgotten that we've seen a desert planet.   If this is the true, I'm actually totally fine with it. I have very little self control when it comes to spoiling details of a game so I'm fine with HG concealing so much from us."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0gur,MHasho,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"yep, both the animals and fish looked strangely the same.   I can see how many people would see these past few videos and be discouraged or skeptical of the game.  Just be confident, and remember those cool clips; the desert planet with sand worms, the planet with floating islands, the barren alien planet with portals and a crashed ship.  Those are all in the game, somewhere, and I bet there's way more than what we've seen."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0gur,TemptedDreamer,5,Tue Jul 21 02:45:14 2015 UTC,Haha awhh gee thanks man. What a great community you guys are. I've been kinda lurking since E3.   Thanks for the pep talk. haha

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0gur,Shoninjv,4,Tue Jul 21 00:58:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some of the planets look almost like they were originally barren and then just had water dumped on them and it filled all the dips in the land."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0gur,TemptedDreamer,3,Tue Jul 21 04:35:22 2015 UTC,"they don't seem realistic to me.

I  strongly  suspect that these  are  completely  ""unrealistic"" -  that  nothing like these  really exists  anywhere in the iuniverse.  But they make for a good  game."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0ooq,JPSRose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:22:24 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed seeing the game again, but watching that guy play it was infuriating. For a seasoned gamer he handled it terribly. It was like watching my dad trying to play a computer game, or a five year old."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0ooq,Linkdead404,5,Tue Jul 21 04:27:40 2015 UTC,"I think it was more so he could spend less time flying and more time showing, he didn't seem too phased when he started wandering off."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0ooq,theearthgarden,3,Tue Jul 21 04:54:04 2015 UTC,"All the planets will be as ""finished"" as each other. There might be bugs affecting them but it's not like they have to fix up each one, or we'd have a really long wait for the game."

I'm sure they fiddled with numbers so that they were near a planet that had certain qualities.  I understand the nature of the game being procedural, but this is NOT the full game in this build."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0ooq,Linkdead404,-6,Tue Jul 21 12:44:57 2015 UTC,He probably just found out that the game has been delayed to late 2016!!!
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,t-rexclub76,18,Mon Jul 20 16:39:38 2015 UTC,This IGN guy playing is hurting the game. Has he ever played a video game?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,extreme_fluffiness,43,Mon Jul 20 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree entirely. IGN has exposed a huge amount of new people to the game, just look at how many more subscribers this subreddit has now. From what I've seen, the comment section is actually getting a little kinder as well. The comments were really nasty on the first video they put out, but the newer ones include some actual discussion not based around hating the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,ShiraCheshire,6,Mon Jul 20 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you and some of the new people in the sub are so whiney. People, there have been nay-sayers for so long saying the same argument. IGN is not creating those people. Since IGN first we've grown from what, 16k to 22k? That's amazing. IGN first has exposed this game to a ton of people and definitely helped the game with its future sales."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,agnl,6,Mon Jul 20 18:47:34 2015 UTC,I also disagree.  I thought both videos were great.  In both he landed on new planets and there's a huge amount of new things to discover.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,xevioso,3,Mon Jul 20 17:22:47 2015 UTC,Like nasty comments about the guy playing the game.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,ShiraCheshire,4,Mon Jul 20 19:25:44 2015 UTC,You are right It has generated alot of new followers. This No Mans Sky subreddit has about the same amount of subscribers now as the Starwars Battlefront subreddit. An indie game has as many subscribers as a AAA Starwars title? That seems like good marketing to me
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Paulbo83,-9,Mon Jul 20 20:18:20 2015 UTC,New subs could be coming from anywhere. The game is getting coverage all over the place.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,ShiraCheshire,4,Mon Jul 20 16:49:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's true that the coverage this game is getting elsewhere probably has resulted in some new subscribers. However, directly after the first IGN video or two we got a huge jump in subscribers. I don't think the vast majority of those could have come from anywhere but IGN, considering the timing."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,ghostspectrum,10,Mon Jul 20 17:01:35 2015 UTC,"Judging from the influx of new users to this sub... Idk.  I'm still excited for it. And I've been following it for ""years"" (this is no Last Guardian, lets be honest)  The only people who think it's hurting it are the people who are following it and expecting too much."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Congzilla,-14,Mon Jul 20 16:45:08 2015 UTC,That's fair.  I'm still excited for this game. I just think it's messed up to put out videos and act like it's going to be some big deal when it's nothing.  Look at the ign comments. Nobody has a positive thing to say about this video.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Congzilla,13,Mon Jul 20 16:48:39 2015 UTC,Stop acting like comments to a message board matter at all.

To that extent, it served its purpose.  I really don't mind the downvotes. I don't think I'll be getting rich off my karma.  The fiesty comments are a bit much. I could easily not respond but i do try to let people know when they've gone too far. And, if you don't hold your own they just do whatever they want.  So it goes. I appreciate the support."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,DoctorLovejuice,8,Mon Jul 20 18:46:21 2015 UTC,"I think some others have already put this idea out there, but let's dispense with the name calling.   HG doesn't owe you or anyone else here anything at this point. Even a game (though they would stand to lose a ton of support, obvi). We haven't contributed anything but hype to this game. While that counts for something, you haven't invested anything in them besides time freely given. While I'm sure they appreciate you interest and dedication, they don't work for you in any sense other than eventually delivering a product that you will buy.    As an investor, you would be entitled to project updates, development status, release dates, etc. But you aren't, so you're not.   Ign promised gameplay and features which is what they have been delivering (some of it has been new; we're learning things weekly). To some people here who have been mining media for the last year or so, it probably isn't much new, but keep in mind just how few people are more than even marginally aware of this game. They are broadening the audience base prior to release.   On top of that, IGN has an entire month of coverage to do within the preexisting format of IGN first, while also catering to Sean's vision of releasing as few spoilers as possible, so obviously data will be thin.   tl;dr chill, be patient, enjoy the drip feed of data, and wait. It will arrive when it's ready."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,TheSceneYouHate,17,Mon Jul 20 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"Gotta admit ign are hugely incompetent with this monthly feature though, but we all knew they have been for years.. If i was Sony or HG i'd be hugely pissed off with their professionalism"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Leopawed,3,Mon Jul 20 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe a 2-minute clip about the animals in the game  (featuring animals we have already seen, inane comments like ""they can look like dinosaurs"" and leaving out cool information like the voice boxes)"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,TemptedDreamer,4,Mon Jul 20 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the two most interesting things are when they first showed the gameplay, and then the showcasing of the 5 planets. They were generally interesting, and it gave you a sense of ""Oh, wow! Look at what we can expect in the game, some cool environments and the interfaces, etc."" But now, we're getting Ryan McCaffrey running around in circles after a 2-3 day wait. Oh. Everything else has... kind of been a bit of a letdown in terms of ""hands on"" and ""first experience"", honestly."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,User1485,5,Mon Jul 20 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"It's important yo remember that these videos are not for us, it's for the rubes that go to IGN for their game news. The comments on IGN are always toxic and full of people that give the COD franchise it's success. You know... morons. I know I am getting frustrated that we don't know the release date but I'd bet the release date has been set for some time so it really doesn't matter if we know the release date now or 2 days before the game comes out. Also it doesn't matter if the readers/viewers of IGN don't like the game, it won't stop it's release."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,TemptedDreamer,3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"I posted something in another thread that I think relates to this:  Personally I think they just spread the coverage too thin. I disagree with the notion they are trying to ""introduce"" more people to NMS. They could have done that with one article about most anticipated releases, and just linked to the e3 stage demo or one of the many trailers. It's actually quite the opposite. IGN is trying to drive new traffic to their site. they're taking advantage of the massive wave of hype this game has generated to increase clicks on their page, thus ad revenue. They are farmin NMS fan clicks. Plain and simple. Right now, for the 22k people on this sub, IGN is using NMS to advertise IGN, not the otherway around. Because honestly, if this was your first time hearing about NMS, how would you react to the video? I can tell you my reaction ""Wow, okay, so this is this experimental, fluffly and cute, but utterly unplayable concept game of the year."" None of the game play footage has been compelling. If this were your first time hearing about NMS, I would turn you 180 degrees away from IGN and point you to the e3 stage demo. Why? Becayse the IGN sells the game short. It makes it look buggy, it doesn't give you a feel for the potential and instead, makes it feel like a fundamentally limiting experience. TL;DR The coverage is simply spread too thin, I'll say it again. A month of coverage for this game would have been better excuted in four weekly features, with real editorial copy, with a variety of planets and mechanics in each video, would have introduced more players to the game. It just makes sense: One plate of fries is more satisfying then one fry, every day, for a month. The micro vids they are shoveling out are designed to make current fans of NMS spend more time on IGN's site, plain and simple. This isn't coverage we're entitled to, but since it is fundamentally designed for us, future players, we are within our rights to be critical in a public forum."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,kokin33,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:44 2015 UTC,That may be true. I wouldn't have minded MW; MWF; W; MF; release date Monday. (With an article on the 3 wed and vids on the other days)

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,MrTwentyThree,-8,Mon Jul 20 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"Respect does have to do with fear. But also much more than that. You brought up that people need to earn respect.   If we haven't gotten respect out of love or appreciation yet. We at least deserve it from the fact that the game's success ultimately depends upon our purchase.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Renegade_Meister,4,Mon Jul 20 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  And Ryan wasn't a COMPLETE derp in this one, unlike the older leaked one.  At least he moved around and stuff...lol."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,thinkadrian,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:40 2015 UTC,I mean he did land his ship on a structure so idk if he wasn't a complete derp but at least he was a more amusing one lol

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,TemptedDreamer,3,Mon Jul 20 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're aware of this, but every human being is an individual with their own set of thoughts and emotions.  Not everyone who knows about No Man's Sky know as much as those who've digested it for over a year now. Most people are either finding out about it, or know very little, consider IGN First an introduction, and not a showcase of everything the game has to offer.  I'd mention entitlement and whatever but I think you've got your hands full with everyone else."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:13 2015 UTC,To be fair aside from the e3 presentation this is the first time we have seen people play it in real time. Its a real load of my mind just to know this game is real.   ps. and shut up my roommate who said the trailers were cgi videos and sean murray was a lying scoundrel and cheat who eats dingle-berries. So yeah I really appreciate the coverage and am glad they aren't giving TOO much away.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,MHasho,2,Mon Jul 20 17:28:11 2015 UTC,I feel like Sean let them do whatever they wanted and that Ryan thought the current way they're handling it was best. He's not the brightest guy. Does anyone remember how he destroyed the online community for Halo Wars?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,TemptedDreamer,0,Mon Jul 20 17:49:47 2015 UTC,what did he do?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:01 2015 UTC,Told everyone that if you play as the Covenant you can use your hero to rush the opposing players and harass them while you start your army. Then go on to show how each of the 3 different heros do it best.  This would be fine except the Humans have no heros at all to defend against this. Nor did the release a video on how to counter these rushes. Nobody really used that as a tactic until he put out that video and from then the community spiraled as that was all anyone did. Once the better players started to do it as well for the lulz it was GG for Halo Wars.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Dizman7,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"So I guess you are no longer planning to buy No Man's Sky! No ? Thought so.. Naa, all is good."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,catteni,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"I love the fact that the game is getting this massive coverage on IGN, but seeing the 8th video of IGN playthroughs just slowly walking around terrain and ignoring EVERY POSSIBLE INTERESTING THING is really boring. I get that they want the game to remain mysterious, but damn. If I get one more slow walk video I'm just not even gonna pay attention to the coverage anymore."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Show_Me_Your_Rocket,2,Mon Jul 20 18:02:03 2015 UTC,Yes! I agree. I think some people who don't know that there will be more are seeing this and will think that the game is lame and repetitive. They need to show off some depth.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:43 2015 UTC,"Agree so much! I couldn't believe it when the IGN guy actually investigated the glowing cubes - he did something!... after ignoring the building he landed near, shooting the ground several times, shooting several animals (again), ignoring the sentinel that was shooting him, and just generally playing like he was half awake. Not to mention the silence - good grief! Your a journalist, supposedly - ask some questions or make some comments at least (which I direct at everyone in that room, not just the guy who was playing, save for Sean).  Edit: I don't feel we 'deserve' anything really, but the coverage is pretty much garbage regardless"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,obippo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:43 2015 UTC,I bet if I did a NMS vid and landed on a planet and walked around slowly in a circle everyone would stay asleep. Then if I say: oh look! A building! Let's see what it's about shall we? Everyone will pop up wanting to see it ;)
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,4cdbast,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:22 2015 UTC,"They did this with XCOM 2 as well. Did a damn good job of tempering my hype which was, before, boundless."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,obippo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:20:52 2015 UTC,What happened? Did it make the game a better experience?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,4cdbast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:05 2015 UTC,I think you're misreading. What I meant was that I got a good deal less hype for XCOM 2 after their second or third week or so of coverage.

We haven't paid a dime (unless some of us are foolish enough to preorder). They don't ""owe"" us anything.  What they are trying to do is finish the game and release it when it's ready. Not rush a half-baked steaming pile of shit like so many AAA devs these days. Paying customers shouldn't be used as beta testers. I respect HG's stance on that."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Hofood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:16 2015 UTC,"It's good for introducing new people to the game... To an extent.   I feel like at this point with how little information they've included, it's just getting old and stale. We know there's exploring. We know there's planet sized planets, life, a ""living breathing world"" et all. I think after the month long Game Informer content this is just getting redundant. Especially with three videos/ articles a week. What exactly are they going to be posting at the end of the month??   As someone who couldn't be more excited for this game and has been scouring for news since VGX, I'm getting so impatient. I feel like the end is in sight but is being held back by corporate, bureaucratic Bs. Please give me this masterpiece of a game. :("
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,formlessfish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:20 2015 UTC,Probably a TBABSS release date.   In other words. No Man's Sky will be on PS4 and PC. To Be Announced By Sean Soon!
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,Congzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that compared to Game Informer, IGN is far worst of a watch.   I do appreciate the actual gameplay (however short it is) that's something I couldn't get from GameInformer. I just wish IGN could tell the tale better."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,DoctorWett,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:07:19 2015 UTC,"Objectively, these videos are bad.   Whatever IGN is trying to achieve with a video like this is beyond me.  Like look at the most recent gameplay video, we thought it was funny and pretty cool, we saw him interact with the cubes, some small questions were answered, but... They start the video off showing a bug/glitch and laughing about it, then proceed to incompetently blow craters in the ground and shoot 2 creatures.   They don't ask questions, they don't talk. They honestly look like they don't care. The peanut gallery is falling asleep, and Sean looks like he hasn't slept for 4 days and is near his breaking point.   The purpose of the video becomes irrelevant when it's of such poor quality as this. It's also strange that they do a fairly good job with their previous videos and accurately convey important information and nice visuals, but when it comes to the gameplay videos (which are a true representation of the game) they barely half-ass it.   To someone who's never seen NMS before, videos like this won't make you want to buy the game.   I don't mind if it turns some people off to the game or kills some hype, maybe that's what they want. It's just weird. It's almost click-baitey."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyo9h,blueExcess,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:05:25 2015 UTC,Maybe they released the wrong one a 4th time? ;)  Actually I think Sean was attempting to show that anyone can play the game. Along with attempting to show nothing new.  It's hard to do a vid on nothing new
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e02qq,ocofan,9,Mon Jul 20 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"Did anyone else get flashbacks to the 2014 E3 trailer on YouTube when reading the title?  I'm not too bothered while in space but I really hope when I go to the night side of a planet that the sky is dark, it'd really kill the mood if it was pink."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e02qq,nomansblade,6,Mon Jul 20 22:55:13 2015 UTC,"Given that I grew up on the same scifi covers that inspired the look, I'm thrilled with it."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e02qq,chrissystardust,2,Mon Jul 20 22:45:25 2015 UTC,Perhaps systems in NMS have a colored Heliosphere. We have one but as far as i can tell it has no colors.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e02qq,ahref,3,Tue Jul 21 00:13:24 2015 UTC,"I like the colours in the sky. It adds character to the area around you. Gives that system something different from, say, their neighbour."

I've never read a book with ""colored space"" or saw any old sci-fi movie with it, so it's not my kind of setting. I'm interested in realism and real space exploration, so I'd like to have it more realistic and less ""old sci-fi style"". I wouldn't like to fly a ship that looks like old Flash Gordon's one either."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e02qq,thinkadrian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:07:03 2015 UTC,"Rumours say that the colours indicate what kind of minerals are in the majority in the system.  I for one like the colours. It's one of the main reasons I took a liking in No Man's Sky and makes it set itself apart from the competitors.  I might give EVE Online a go when I want more ""real space"" - or just wait for the next Mass Effect for the eerie sci-fi feel."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e02qq,devinup,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:53:41 2015 UTC,Colored space is a separate space from empty space but it's equally as good.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e02qq,CurseHawking,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:04:27 2015 UTC,"There's a good chance that the player character isn't human. So, maybe they're capable of seeing a wider range in the electromagnetic spectrum compared to humans?  I've always had this idea in my mind after i saw the first trailer, since some images of space are taken in infrared to show things that people can't normally see with the naked eye, and NMS looks very similar to some of those pictures.  Here are some examples: http://willgater.com/2010/02/19/10-incredible-infrared-space-images/  Here's an incredible video made with infrared pictures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BHDUhX68hs"

In stellar systems such gas clouds couln't exist because every star is producing so called ""stellar wind"", constant stream of particles escaping the star. It would blow away all gas in star's vincinity."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3e02qq,CurseHawking,0,Mon Jul 20 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"I know i used infrared as an example, but i meant a wider range in general.  In certain wavelengths, the atmosphere of a star would be more visible. That's how they take pictures of solar flares and whatnot.  I know it doesn't make perfect sense in the real-world, but neither do a lot of other things in this game."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz31r,nomansblade,0,Mon Jul 20 21:05:35 2015 UTC,Umm you do realise that doesn't change anything? No one even knew about No Man's Sky two years ago so I'm not sure how it being first is at all relevant.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz31r,DarthGrabass,0,Mon Jul 20 21:08:32 2015 UTC,"NMS was first shown on December 7, 2013, and the reaction was huge. I guarantee that dozens of game developers began planning similar games hours later.  The Empyrion devs say that they started two years ago, but there's no public mention of the game until October 2014, almost a year after NMS was announced and shown.  It's not a crime or anything, but the inspiration is pretty transparent."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz31r,nomansblade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:18 2015 UTC,"Hardly. Space Engineers and Evechron Mercenary both have planets (or will have them in the future),that doesn't mean they copied NMS. The main similarities between NMS and Empryion are planets and terrain deformation (which is pretty standard in a lot of these games anyway). Personally I'd say it's copying space engineer, it's not even like No Man's Sky."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz31r,Ammonitida,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:08:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not following your logic. Obviously Space Engineers and Evechron Mercenary weren't inspired by NMS, and I never said they were. That would be impossible, since they came out before NMS was even announced."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dz31r,Ammonitida,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry should have made myself clearer, I'm saying is that both Space Engineers and Evechron Mercenary are very similar to No Man's Sky, that doesn't mean we accuse No Man's Sky of copying them or vice versa.  The developers say they've been working on it for two years, I'm willing to believe them. There are many other games Empyrion could have copied that were around two years ago, I'm sure they took inspiration from Space Engineers,Evechron Mercenary,Spaceway and Elite but I don't think they've been copying NMS."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1brd,icyflamez96,16,Tue Jul 21 04:57:10 2015 UTC,I believe IGN's wiki has an exhaustive list of the hundreds (if not thousands!) of planets in the game

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e1brd,Ozaga,2,Tue Jul 21 11:29:13 2015 UTC,Yes and no. Every planet seen before E3 2015 essentially is not in the final game since they were using one of 10 universes.   The E3 2015 build planets may be in the final game provided the game is done and the E3 2015 planets are somewhere in the final build.   Otherwise. Just a safe bet to wait till after launch day

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dx02i,EternalCanadian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think it's more likely they announce it at Gamescom the following week. Microsoft was already saving some of their big guns (I'm looking at you, Crackdown 3) for that conference, so it doesn't seem out of the question to expect Sony to have planned to do the same.   Especially because I don't think MS announced that plan until days before E3; which could explain why NMS was suddenly unable to mention the release date during their part of Sony's conference."

Sean told us on E3 that he wanted to give us a release date, but he couldn't. And the reason was out of his hands, meaning that some other party forbid HG to give a release date.  Also, HG said that they only would communicate a release date when the game was as goof as finished, meaning this was the case a couple of weeks before E3.  I think IGN promised a full month's coverage in exchange for having the release date scoop.   This was procedurally generated speculation."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dy17k,marian1,3,Mon Jul 20 14:32:50 2015 UTC,They haven't talked too much about this but (this is just speculation mind you) based on the vague answers we have received it sounded like you get a random looking multitool that changes with the ungrades you add onto it. I don't know if you can swap this out at a space station/trading post or not but would be cool if that is the case. Worst case scenario is we all get the same looking multitool that changes it's look somewhat with each upgrade (which would still be cool in my book)
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dy17k,klovasos,3,Mon Jul 20 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm not sure the look actually changes when your upgrade it. I think the only variations you can get are through when they're generated."

We have only ever seen an upgraded multi-tool in the 18min video IGN release a week or so ago. When he upgraded it to a plasma canon and blew a hole in that giant rock. I did not notce any visual change when he upgraded it at all. Either in the menu or in FPS view. You saw the action of what looked like attaching an upgrade but so no actual visual change.   I do think their will be thousands of different multi-tool skins but I have a feeling they wont change with upgrades. But it will be just that...a skin. Now I think it would be cool if different skins had different base stats so there would be somewhat of a desire to upgrade your multi-tool other than just for looks. Especially since its your only ""weapon"" in the entire game.  Though I do wonder if upgrades are like ships...that once you place an upgrade you cant remove it. I see the guns skins being the same a ship skins. The base ship skin will stay the same no matter what upgrades you get."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dy17k,Laynton,3,Mon Jul 20 17:10:39 2015 UTC,Nearly positive the look will have variations...there's a screen capture of some concept art somewhere that shows many variations of the same type of multi tool...and in one of interviews with Danny at GameSpot he mentions there being like millions of possibilities due to the types of attachments and their procedural nature... (or something along those lines). Though nothing has been officially confirmed it's a safe to assume that the multi tool will be as unique as your ship at the end of the day...and least that's my understanding
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dy17k,craftitall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:09 2015 UTC,I think this is a really cool concept. I wonder if the multitools we all start with will vary in color and shape.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dy17k,bullybabybayman,0,Mon Jul 20 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"Sean has said there will not be rifles and such, so yes they will all be some sort of ""handgun""."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3e0dt4,Uncompetative,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:10 2015 UTC,You can pre-order alright but you don't get the game until HG/Sony release it. It doesn't matter if the server are available or not. You can always play the game in SP.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyxfm,AquilaSPQR,6,Mon Jul 20 17:43:10 2015 UTC,"Sean said in the first gameplay video you could lose the wanted level by hiding (although iir he either gets talked over or mumbles it really fast, it took me a few rewatches to catch)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyxfm,theearthgarden,9,Mon Jul 20 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"This.  If you just avoid the drones and stuff, the wanted level vanishes. Just remember, boys and girls: Shoot n scoot.  Shoot. N. Scoot."

He also mentioned that a high wanted level (maybe 4, or so) would have some persistence on a planet so that if you returned later, you'd still be wanted. This must be a wanted level for killing multiple sentinels, rearranging geography, and killing LOTS of critters."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dyxfm,darkautumnhour,0,Mon Jul 20 18:40:15 2015 UTC,I didn't ever hear about the persistence for higher wanted levels.  He just said the only real way to lose wanted levels is to run away/hide.

However, we've seen the tide rise in the leaked (now officially released) 6 min. IGN First video.    Those are two different videos. You should watch today's video. It's not the leaked video.   Also, the ""tide rise"" in the earlier leaked video was probably a glitch. It only happened when the player was trying to walk along the shoreline, and it only went up. This happens in other games as well. See the harbor level in Ether One for another example."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3duuub,HardKase,2,Mon Jul 20 04:49:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking at him in a ""I want to date him"" kind of way (because I'm a dude and I don't swing that way), so I'm not really talking about the way he acts. I'm saying looks alone, he is a handsome dude to me. And we can disagree on that! :D"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3duuub,FrostyXylophone,2,Mon Jul 20 04:56:38 2015 UTC,"I think he has Social Anxiety.   I have Social Anxiety and when I talk to somebody I, sometimes, look at the ground. I do that, because I don't like eye contact. Makes me feel ugly."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3duuub,DJSkrillex,2,Mon Jul 20 09:04:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that sounds right. But his passion for this project overrides that and make him cone across as charismatic. It's all derived from his passion. Which is a great thing to see in a developer.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3duuub,HardKase,2,Mon Jul 20 12:20:32 2015 UTC,I'm not saying that social anxiety makes him look bad.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3duuub,DJSkrillex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:23:30 2015 UTC,"So this used to bother me a lot too, and it was brought up in conversation once with my best friend. Now, I'd say we both had the problem, maybe for different reasons, but the fact that we could talk about it and maybe overcome our fear of mostly solid eye contact together, was what worked.   If you don't have a best friend, you could always use a family member or anyone you actually feel comfortable with. This may even be with someone you feel is more ugly than you (this may seem like a messed up thing to say, but I'm sure you're not ugly either).  Now, start by trying to have regular conversations without breaking eye contact. It will be difficult at first, but there's no reason to feel uncomfortable in front of this person, right? The point of this exercise is not only to see how long you can go without breaking (because you will), but also where you tend to look when you are breaking. If there are other people in the room/building, I'll tend to glance at them, at appropriate times (ex. not when I'm trying to get a point across, but instead maybe when I'm trying to remember something). If there's nobody else around, I might glance at what objects around the room might be interesting, whether it be what we're eating or something hung up on the wall, etc. TV probably won't work on this exercise.  Another thing to try is to explore the person you're talking to with your eyes. What are they wearing? And I don't mean socks/shoes. If you're anything like I was, you already know everyone's shoe collection. I mean, do they have anything around their neck, wrists, or head? Designs on their clothes? You can always bring any of these things up in conversation, but you're not staring at these things, you're just finding something to glance at.  Ok, so all that worked for me in average settings with people I knew, more or less. But when it came to people I found beautiful, it felt like this is where everyone has a problem maintaining eye contact. Now, if it's someone you find sexually attractive, it's good to examine them from head to toe anyway, but in great moderation. This is end game anyway, so don't get all worked up over it. I'd say within the first 15 seconds of seeing this person, you want to spend about 11 seconds looking into their eyes. If they maintain the same with you, this is going to be a great conversation.  If you have any questions, hit me up."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3duuub,DJSkrillex,2,Mon Jul 20 15:52:41 2015 UTC,"He's definitely handsome. Charismatic? Not in a ""traditional"" way I'd say, but he does have a distinct charm to him."

There are already countless discussions about the release date and PS+. It doesn't really offer any chance for additional discussion on the topic.   Post, for reference.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtflt,Nightwing69,10,Sun Jul 19 14:14:28 2015 UTC,what does the release date have to do with the specualtion over the game's content? also most rumours etc. right now is for late this year or early next
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtflt,The_Anonymoose,2,Sun Jul 19 14:25:19 2015 UTC,I don't understand. People are excited for this game. What is too much exposure?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtflt,drbansquatch,3,Sun Jul 19 23:29:55 2015 UTC,Well the thing is fallout 4 isn't rushed or anything. They just announced it when they knew it was good and ready. Wish it was like this more instead of being hyped for a game that's not even being released the same year.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtflt,AreYouDeadYet9,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:04:00 2015 UTC,I'm beginning to wish NMS was like this. I'm sick of getting hyped up for it only for it still not to have any release date in site.   They better not be letting IGN hype it up so much to still not have a release date. And I really hope it's not at the same time as Fallout (NMS is going to lose that battle but it will probably be closer than if any other game that's coming out this year or even next released near Fallout 4).

Hello games said that they were not going to show the game again or do any publicity until the game was close to being ready, they also said there would be no release date till the game is finished, they have said nothing indicating that this game is not on track for 2015 release. I am just as eager as everyone else and have been following NMS from the start, but i think its pretty obvious were close to a finished product.  On a side note...  SO. FUCKING. STOKED."

As soon as we get a release date, I'm gonna unsub and not look into anything else for the game until it's release just because I want to experience the game, not watch someone experience it. And as for Fallout 4, they didn't tease though with gameplay trailers and 3 years worth of teasing. With NMS Sony is just holding the steak in front of the dog."

Quoted from another one of my posts:   -Sean said 2015.  -Sean said they will announce a release date when its done.  -Sean said the release date will be announced soon.  -Sean shaved his programmers beard.  -Sean has had way more time to do the interview rounds and not be in a media blackout.   Happened before? Probably.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dx19y,slayerming2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:23 2015 UTC,I can only speak for myself: If I am rly invested in a project (like currently my homebuild 3D Scanner) I will only do only stuff that needs to be done. Like showering basic home cleaning etc. So I can get as much time as possible to finish my project. Also it is somehow pretty cool to measure a project by beardgrow. Another example would be the german soccer Team. Some if them decided to shave again after they won/dropped out of the world cup.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dzmrh,ocofan,4,Mon Jul 20 20:43:24 2015 UTC,What about those crates in the latest IGN video? Seem to be 'hidden' underwater (or rather not easily seen above the surface); maybe they'll be an incentive for cave exploring or just generally exploring a planet in general.

I was a little disappointed in this, but recognised how this fit with the theme he was trying to convey - the exploration of a hostile alien wilderness, not the habitation or settlement of any particular place (so it isn't right to call this 'Minecraft in space' as so many do as there won't be any base-building mechanics for deliberate reasons, even though there will be crafting of atomic elements into alloys, etc.). As a point of reference, this is what I felt may be possible and what was accounting for the delay in its release:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR9xI0GgrBY  I had thought that there would be time to create a few of these cities per major continent: a large capital, a few ports, and possibly an airport, as well as a spaceport in advanced civilisations - as you flew past the uninhabited outer planets (mainly gas giants with the odd mining colony / smuggler's den / etc.), as there would be plenty of time to run this time-consuming procedural generation algorithm on the way there and cache the results for the duration of your time in that particular star system."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:21:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It's not competing with these titles. To me, it seems people are only concerned about the marketing strategies behind the release date because it gives them an illusory way to estimate when the game will be released, where in reality, nobody really gives a damn how many NMS units they manage to sell - because we will all be playing it on Day One anyway, right?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:31:47 2015 UTC,"I don't have a PS4, and I'll probably build a good enough PC somewhere around next year, so I won't be playing on day one."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,NekoMadeOfWaifus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:37:28 2015 UTC,Even better!
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,3,Mon Jul 20 12:07:00 2015 UTC,"If they were released a day apart, I would still buy both. Who wouldn't?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,14,Sun Jul 19 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"people who cant afford both or dont have time for both  Fallout 4 is too big of a game for NMS to compete with. AND it a sequel from a well-known company.  Not saying Fallout will  be better/worse, just that the timing of release will definitely affect sales"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,mgmtconsulting,3,Mon Jul 20 00:07:41 2015 UTC,"This. People who can only afford one game will be forced to choose, and I guarantee you more of them will be choosing Fallout if it comes to that."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,chrissystardust,4,Mon Jul 20 00:14:39 2015 UTC,"I suppose. I mean, people who can only afford one game AROUND THE RELEASE DAY will be forced to choose, there is nothing to say you either buy the game on release day or you don't buy it at all.."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, but from what I understand, companies make the majority of their money in the first three months. So you really want people to buy then. Also, if people wait to buy your game they might cool down on it or find other games they want to play. So they may have had intentions of buying it later but it just doesn't happen. In general in marketing you want people to buy when the interest is new/hot. You don't want to give them time to rethink it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,tigress666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:47:49 2015 UTC,"Sure - and I agree - but we aren't really talking about the quarterly review of HelloGame's or Bethesda's income, are we?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,2,Mon Jul 20 07:24:14 2015 UTC,"I understand it would affect sales, but are we talking about that? I don't really mind how many units they sell. Of course I would love to hear they sell a ridiculous amount, but that hardly affects me getting the game.  I also wasn't suggesting people buy both games on a theoretical same-release day. Not even I could afford that in one hit.  What I was suggesting was buying both games eventually.."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,Show_Me_Your_Rocket,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:20:40 2015 UTC,"Arguably, I dont really have time to play Fallout 4 in a hurry either - I'm still gonna get it at some point anyway. It may take a while to play through it, but oh well."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,0,Sun Jul 19 23:32:08 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. You two are saying you don't have time for Fallout 4, but you do for NMS? How does that make sense? Is there some kind of rush in Fallout 4? lol"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,Zmezmer,7,Mon Jul 20 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"NMS is infinite, there's no pressure to keep playing. And from the look of things, it looks like it will be easy to pick up and put down when you have to. Fallout on the other hand, very story driven, alot of quests, and alot of dialogue. To some people, it sucks playing a game that's hard to put down, and if you can't play for a whole week, back tracking and remembering what happened can be tedious."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,kalaster189,3,Mon Jul 20 00:49:56 2015 UTC,Yeah basically that ^
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,0,Mon Jul 20 01:17:12 2015 UTC,I wouldn't. Fallout is going to take all of my gaming time. Why buy another game that I won't play until later?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,tigress666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:46:30 2015 UTC,"So you're saying you would get No Mans Sky - but later on, instead of release day? In essence, you actually would get both games, like I said originally."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,DoctorLovejuice,2,Mon Jul 20 07:26:07 2015 UTC,"I had a dream last week where it happened. After the video they say ""Oh! And we have a release date you"" and a 10 second timer shows up on the screen, at the end of said timer, a link shows up to buy and download the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,Werebaer,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:19 2015 UTC,I hope they give us a release date with some breathing room so I can put in my vacation from work the week its released.

Ostensibly this would be at the end of the month of coverage, but if something goes wrong and they find a problem that needs a few extra weeks to fix, they don't want a date leaking that's going to change later."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dvda4,Whats_upchuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"They may not know it yet. A video already leaked from IGN because of the hype around the game. I guess that if the media had the release date, we could expect it to be leaked too. It would be more secured for HG and Sony to just give them the release date at the end of the month, so they are sure it stays secret until there."

However, I'm getting my idea from a comic I found on FJ, as well as the gamesite itself, which for the life of me cannot remember. I want to see a planet where instead of having oceans, the water is replaced with trees. In the ""shallow"" areas, the trees are sparse and thin, but as you go deeper, they get massive and really thick. And the wildlife follows the pattern as well. Like, imagine you're at the bottom of the forest and you see a 60 foot tall deer looking thing walking in the dark distance. This would require a massive world, and since the depth only goes to 128m, it won't work. But I can dream right? Lol.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,AlexanderByrde,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure it goes something like;   1/10 have basic life (including lush flora, bugs, etc) 1/100 have a bit more complex life 1/1000 have even more complex life   And keeps going in that fashion, so whilst OP is technically correct, it's far far far less likely those planets will have huge, dinosaur-like animals on them.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,Nomanski,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"According to the numbers  mentioned by  HG so far,      about  10%  of  planets  have  ""life"",    and  about  10%  of that 10%  (1%   of the total)   are  ""lush garden planets"".  So  whatever  number  of  players  we're  talking about,   if  all  players  start  on  a randomly-chosen  planet,    then based on those numbers  we  can  expect 90%   to start  on   aplanet with no life, 9%   with  ""some"" life,  and  1%   on  a  ""lush garden planet"".  /r/NoMansSkyTheGame currently has 22,625 subscribers."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,americosg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:19:34 2015 UTC,They control the variables that determine the start planet. I bet 90% of us will start on a planet with reasonably complex life that way it has an interesting start for new player that actually don't know exactly what the game is about.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,Mighty_The_Man,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:24 2015 UTC,"No sean specifically said everyone will not start on the same types of planets. Some people will have planets abundant with rare resources, some will spawn with just normal resources, and everything inbetween."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,SteamPoweredCowboy,0,Mon Jul 20 00:07:14 2015 UTC,What are the chances of two players spawning on the same planet with complex life?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,tuxedohamm,5,Sun Jul 19 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"Making the assumption that there are 200 billion stars in the galaxy (based on real-world estimates), and using u/voltronranger 's estimate of 6 planets per star, then you can estimate about 1.2 trillion planets in the starting galaxy.  We know that we will start along the edges of the galaxy and not near the center.  I'd consider somewhere within the first 10% to be a fair estimate.  Feel free to criticise this guess.  My reasoning is it wouldn't be too deep in, but not so close to the edge that you're facing complete darkness on one side.  Using 10% as the estimate, there would be 120 billion starting planets.  The chance of you starting on any given planet is 1 out of 120 billion (0.0000000008%).  The chance of another player starting on a given planet would also be 1 out of 120 billion (0.0000000008%).  The chance of you and another player starting on the exact same planet is (1/120b)*(1/120b) or 1 out of 14.4 sextillion (0.0000000000000000000069%).  The chance of you and another player starting on the exact same complex life planet is (1/120b)(1/120b)(1/100) or 1 out of 1.44 septillion (0.0000000000000000000000069%).  You have a better chance of winning the US Powerball lottery jackpot twice.  EDIT:  didn't finish a figure"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,SteamPoweredCowboy,4,Sun Jul 19 15:59:34 2015 UTC,I love you. I hope we spawn on the same planet together.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,Murrdogg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"To elaborate, assuming the odds of winning the power ball were 1 in 259 million, the odds of winning it twice would be 1 in 14.9 quadrillion. Those odds are about 96.6 million times better than the 1 in 1.44 septillion."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtzvd,daneelthesane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:33:06 2015 UTC,"There's really no way of knowing that, though I think it is safe to assume that they have coded a function to prevent it. We would have to know:   The number of stars in the starting galaxy (assuming the average they gave us of 6 planets per star is accurate), and  The percentage of those stars that have starting planets (since we are starting on the outer edge of the galaxy),"

If you assume a more reasonable time on each planet of at least 5 minutes, that timeline shoots up to almost 25000 years. And then of course if you assume a sane - but still huge - playerbase of more like 100 million instead of 7 billion, you get a number more like two million years.   The moral of the story? Never trust your intuition on large numbers.  Again, 18 quintillion is A LOT. Only a small fraction of a percentage of the planets in the game are likely to ever be visited."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtis0,CapWasRight,3,Sun Jul 19 09:41:18 2015 UTC,I think you're math is a little off. 18 quintillion divided by 7 billion is way more than 2.5 billion planets. It's 2.5 trillion planets.   Definitely take more than 80 years per 1 second planets.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtis0,_therealchin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"I'm using short scale here (quintillion = 1018, billion = 109), but it does occur to me now for the first time that these numbers might be in long scale.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtis0,TheRedCow,2,Sun Jul 19 10:10:11 2015 UTC,"Surely you can find the space stations with a scan. Then near the centre of the galaxy you will have a few stations per system where everyone needs to be in order to trade. That massively reduces the size between people. Granted you may still not find anyone, however I think that makes the chances significantly higher. I'm pretty sure if you spend enough time at  the centre which is a goal for some players then you will bump into a player. I doubt you could intentionally do it though"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtis0,FrostyXylophone,2,Sun Jul 19 10:14:15 2015 UTC,"Dude... there will literally be billions of stars near the center of the galaxy, and from what I have read there is likely one space station per system. That means billions of space stations for people to go to. And people will come and go at different times. You are still severely underestimating the size of the game. Read through the post again and try to imagine the distances he gives. You can't. They are so far and vast that we can't really wrap our heads around them. Not trying to be rude or anything, I just want to prepare you for the fact that unless the devs have implemented some sort of surprise system that you activate when you reach the center, it is highly unlikely that you will find your friends or many people at all."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtis0,TheRedCow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:47:35 2015 UTC,I assume that there is a single location at the centre people are trying to reach. If you wait one star system from it you will find people going there. So let's say there are twenty different star systems that link to the central point of the Galaxy. If you choose one and wait at the space station then you will bump into someone. I know exactly how big it is but when you narrow things down to the place that will be the most populated in the game and then camp it out you will find someone. We haven't seen the centre yet so I'm making an assumption of how many linking systems there will be but unless it's thousands linking to the centre then you will find someone if you wait long enough
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtis0,japascoe,2,Sun Jul 19 10:54:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Sean has said that you can see on the galaxy map which systems have been discovered. As long as there's some way of finding specific ones on the galactic map*, finding a specific system shouldn't be that hard (getting there is a different matter). There is one station per system, and given how important they are for the gameplay I'm pretty sure they'll be easy to find, just like the beacons on the planets.  Yes, NMS is not an MMO and you won't form a bloodthirsty wing of pirates terrorizing cubic parsecs of local space with your buddies, but that doesn't mean meeting your friends will be impossible. It'll be hard and time-consuming, but the same goes for getting to the centre of the galaxy.  *E.g. searchable list in the Atlas, coordinate system, 'rotate your map so that this one blue star lines up exactly with this one green one, then zoom out for 10 seconds, then look for the explored systems in the bottom left of the screen'. I mean there's going to be a mini-map for the galactic map, so we should be able to specify quadrants at least."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtis0,nomansblade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"I thought space stations would be relatively easy to find once in a system. It seems we generally warp out near one and if not I imagine there's a waypoint for it. Isn't there only one space station per system anyway?   Getting to the same system is going to be difficult,no denying it but so long as you head towards the same star (it sounds like there's a coordinates system) it shouldn't be too difficult, just time consuming.  ""You may think you understand the scale of the game, but you're almost certainly underestimating it."". Do we really need to keep on doing this whole ""no one understands the nature of the game but me"" stuff? So many threads to do with the maths of No Man's Sky start with that rubbish."

I would not bother if I had to hyperjump 19 times and refuel 19 times / recharge 19 times in order to get to the planet.  I know we are not getting Sean's anywhere travel.

This isn't correct. The basis for this estimation was our own galaxy, where you used the old 100,000ly width (current research indicates it is now 160,000ly across), yet your calculation arrives at a distance 4.5x that amount per person at 10,000,000 people.

When the reality is they could be long bored of the game before they bump into anyone."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtis0,Flaming-Driptray,2,Sun Jul 19 11:16:05 2015 UTC,"Then why would they even bother implementing multi-player in the game, if it were nearly impossible to ever meet someone? Multi-player implementation is one of the most difficult and time consuming parts of game making. And uploading things to a central server would be possible without the need of possible real time interaction between players. And still, Hello games said this would be possible. Either it'd be a huge waste of resources, which is improbable for their small team, or there's more to this than you think. Who knows, maybe after you reach the center you can warp to any planet, or search for other players. I wouldn't dismiss such possibilities willy nilly."

If that sector of space can be identified because of distance from the center, time, and variable of movement.  You would have to input a formula in order to find it.  Unless some engineer automatically assigned everything a value then you would just need three 18 quintillion numbers height width depth, because movement and time would not matter."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dstkm,cherbert,2,Sun Jul 19 17:31:58 2015 UTC,I think its becoming increasingly obvious that that 2nd video was scrapped. Either because it was boring or Sean wasn't happy with the glitches seen in it. It was always meant to follow on the next day but was dropped. Which is why the other IGN accidentally released it because they never got the memo. My theory is we will never see that video officially released.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dstkm,ChetDiesel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:19:14 2015 UTC,"That actually makes a little bit of sense. In the video he says that they're ""going to have so much more all month long on IGN First"".

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dv888,DurMan667,6,Sun Jul 19 20:45:56 2015 UTC,The running assumption is that at the center there is something that allows you to travel to the next galaxy...therefore the 2nd galaxy's center will allow you to travel to the 3rd one and so on for infinity..... but no one really knows for sure so we will just have to wait and see
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dv888,craftitall,4,Sun Jul 19 20:25:31 2015 UTC,Might as well just be a portal network between all galaxies or some other means that allows you to visit any galaxy after the first is done.  Possibility of not being able to leave the second galaxy (whether it's the only choice or if you can choose it) before finding the center of that galaxy is also there.

A: Tsunamis...There are no tsunamis. The others are okay. There are like weather effects...and stuff. And again, that's been in some vids. I'm sure we've shown some kind of sandstorms. I think we've shown rain, and kind of like really misty planets and things like that.  And those do kind of vary on a planet, but generally you'll have a prevailing weather type on a planet. Like this is a decision that we made, that generally a planet will be kind of one biome in its entirety, with some kind of variation within it. So that players can kind of say, 'Oh that's the ice planet...That's the kind of Dune-esque planet."" Rather than like what you'd have on Earth, where Earth contains so many different biomes and stuff like that. We wanted players to almost kind of categorize it in their minds."

The admins actually cleaned up hate speech.   So far, so good.   Nowadays, since they can't control it all, they just allow it.   No! It's more like, ""Then, for a brief period from around 2010 through 2012, they were understaffed and thus couldn't control it all, so they adopted an 'anything goes' attitude. But since then, they've added plenty of staffing, so it's time to go jettison the temporary emergency 'allow hate speech' policy and go back to the original policies."""

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ds0g9,teaminus,6,Sun Jul 19 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"Meh, I'm very libertarian on this issue (not any others though, I'm le snowflake) so I dislike banning for hate speech as a principle and instead support thoroughly dismantling it with argument before it before it gains traction. Otherwise it just turns into a war between the arbitrary line of what can be classed as ""hate speech"".  But what's being proposed here is largely symbolic, and stuff that's off-topic gets removed anyway. Random posts of ""kill the Jews"" or whatever would already fall under that label. The question is whether something politically related happened to Hello Games/No Man's Sky eg. it gets banned in Iran, and the discussion evolves to be about Islam and Sharia, and some people holding strong views one way or the other. It's off topic on its own, but it's still connected to the original topic. Any decision made should be based around that dilemma, rather than deciding if it's hate speech or not. Because personally I can't think of any instance where something that could be called hate speech would be relevant to this sub anyway.  It seems to me the mods are very level-headed and good at what they do. Again, what's being proposed is symbolic, and I personally don't have strong feelings about this proposal one way or another. So it's up to the mods to decide if they want to support it, because I doubt the community will care much either way.  TL:DR It's a non-issue, so long as the sidebar text is the only change made. Sorry for this very stream-of-consciousness post."

He was a kind man, but the lizard party had other ideas..  After poisoning the water supply with their lizard-toxins they ran for president (it wasn't even election season!), and the people like mindless zombies voted in droves, giving the lizard leaders power over this once-great country within a matter of days, removing my grandfather from power and turning him to a life of drink!   Once the toxins had run off and we returned to normal, it was too late, the lizards had taken over, they had separate bathrooms, they walked on their side of the street, they'd spit blood from their eyes at us, jeered and called us names.   They took away our right to vote, our right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and we had to ask lizards to open doors for us.. And they didn't.  What do I have against lizard people?

""All lizard people should die"" is not okay. It's a call to violence.  It has to clearly incite violence or harm to others to be hate speech. So in the end, hate speech has nothing to do with opinions or facts. It's a clear attack.  As for who decides, so far it's been us, moderators. We've actually been sticklers when it comes what words you may or may not use on here. Personally, it is stressful to deal with this stuff.

Action is already banned (rapingwomen was the example in spez's post).   This is a manipulative campaign that raldi is running. Everyone has different definitions of hate speech. All he wants is for people to put 'against hate speech' in the subreddit banner. Then hate speech is defined as opinions. Then he can get communities like coontown removed.   It has to clearly incite violence or harm to others to be hate speech. So in the end, hate speech has nothing to do with opinions or facts. It's a clear attack.   Raldi is looking to remove coontown, which does not have any call to action (if it did it would be banned already, you can be sure they looked for ways to ban it).  /u/llehsadam I strongly believe you should not have that slogan in the sidebar. It is based on tricking people by fudging definitions.   People are getting banned for posting FBI statistics. I got banned once for talking about a muslim rape gang in my neighbourhood, that raped one of my friends from school - it is seen as hate speech as its islamophobic. 1300 sikh/christian/atheist children were raped in the UK by pakistani muslims and it was covered up by the governemnet and the media and the police for a decade - they were not stopped until a whistleblower gave up their career to get the truth out. The majority of people do not understand how much harm is created when you ban hate speech; it means that people cant cry for help when tragedies that occur are politically incorrect.  This is not the place to discuss tragedies, this sub. Im totally pumped up for NMS and i hate saying a sticky about subreddit politics and a call to arms to remove subs that some liberals in Silicon Valley say their (superior/absolute) moral framework cant allow for."

I haven't heard about this and knowing how reddit works (or doesn't) it's hard to accept that as the only reason for the ban, but even if I believe you, what does that have to do with a policy that hasn't been enacted yet?  Ok, you were banned for discussing a tragedy, but you have to understand that in communities with much more at stake for their users than ours (like /r/suicidewatch) people have died because of this shit. You can argue that they will move off-site, but why would you give them a platform to harm others in the first place. Reddit is the door to a dark dark rabbit hole.  And you know what? It leaks. It leaks to /r/NoMansSkyTheGame.  All of it has to go. Why does a community about a computer game have to deal with users from subreddits like that?"

Often people have an agenda in online debates Ive had, but you literally are writing lies.   /r/coontown is about dehumanization. That's not an opinion or point of view, it has always been and always will be a psychological tool for inciting harm to others.   You literally have put a view and followed it up with ""this is not an opinion or point of view"". What else can I say to this. Why dont you go there and look at threads that say ""thank god im not the only one to experience this, the police/media have covered up X Y Z blah blah blah"".   Ok, you were banned for discussing a tragedy, but you have to understand that in communities with much more at stake for their users than ours (like /r/suicidewatch) people have died because of this shit.    WTF are you even talking about. Brigading subs and calling people to action is already banned. What you are seeking to ban is people minding their own business in subs and discussing politically incorrect stories/facts. It is completely different to go into a suicidewatch thread and call people names (and obviously a bannable offence already).   That guy in the 'It leaks' thread is trolling coontown. Look at his post history - he is attacking them. it is a false flag. It might be you for all I know. Banning coontown, where people can talk about tragedies and the such, does not get rid of these trolls, and you know it. It just removes the ability for people to discuss when their friend gets raped, or 1300 children get raped again. There always will be retards writing the N word everywhere: you arent going to ban that - you are aiming to ban a support group, because you want to label it as hate without understanding it.  You have shown outrageous levels of dishonesty and manipulation here. You have claimed something (that this is about banning actions, not ideas (as quoted in parent parent comment)) but in reality you wanted the opposite. Then you have tried to cover up your tracks by claiming that ideas are ""psychological tool for inciting harm to others"" so they are actually an action, and can be banned. And you have lied to a community that trusted you."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ds0g9,daymanelite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"The problem is that ""All lizard people should die"" doesn't incite violence. It isn't directed towards inciting and isn't likely to cause imminent lawless action. So it isn't illegal. See Brandenburg v Ohio. Should I be worried that your pristine example is highly flawed? What happens when biased people, and all people are biased, get to declare from on high what is and isn't hate speech. The very concept of a group collectively deciding on good think is practically dangerous and farcical in conception. If the post or subreddit isn't illegal (e.g. child pornography, soliciting prostitution, swatting, etc) you will have a small group of people deciding what isn't and isn't okay. And as history (and common sense) shows this will devolve into a frenzied internet justice brigade that bans people for not being politically correct, having opposing political or religious views, etc. In other words, severe and oppressive discrimination. It will create an atmosphere of fear and judgement. And as I said previously this sort authoritarian PC policing will kill Reddit."

In fact, reddit allows for communities to exist that encourage activities that are illegal in some parts of the United States. I live in Germany and there are quite a few things I can't do, but I don't feel any less free. Am I in any way that actually affects my life?  I don't feel like I live in an atmoisphere of fear and judgement, the only people that do are Nazis. Perhaps the same kind of atmosphere will be created for racists and bigots on reddit.   There is no slippery slope. When reddit banned /r/jailbait, people cried that /r/trees, /r/cripplingalcoholism and /r/gambling would be next. When reddit banned doxxing, people argued that a zero tolerance policy would mean I could be banned for saying: ""/u/wil played Wesley Crusher on Star Trek."" Did the oppression ever arrive? No. Reddit grew.  I don't think banning hate speech subreddits will kill reddit, I think it will make this place more inviting to the general population. It seems the only group of people that really disagree with this statement are people with a more libertarian outlook. Personally, I'm simply not libertarian enough to share that opinion."

The mods decide what is or isn't hate speech.  It doesn't need to be a free speech issue... nobody is taking anyone to jail over things that they're saying, but removing people from subs for ANY reason is up to the mods/admins.

As recent history has shown any censorship program will devolve into a victim contest where the squeakiest wheel wins the oil. Have you been paying attention lately? The frenzy of internet justice warriors to tear down and destroy those they deem offensive has gone off the rails and has also destroyed the lives of many innocent bystanders. These perpetual victims will have to continue creating victimizers to gain attention. But I don't need to belabor this point.

It will be a tribunal crushing anyone they dislike. I don't have to envision a slippery slope. I just have to open my eyes and see it in everyday life. The fact that joking about or speaking out against gays, something that isn't illegal, will get a person banned shows how far we've fallen. This isn't justice. If ""Susie Gay"" makes fun of heterosexuals she won't be punished. The bias of this hate speech policy on display.

If you think that reddit, or any forum, has to be either a completely open, anything goes, community or an authoritarian-policed community, then I think you have issues that are rooted deeper than reddit not allowing hate-speech.  Perhaps you should lead the charge and prove your point by leaving reddit?  EDIT:  Also, I don't have the power to ban people, nor do I want it.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ds0g9,JPSRose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:53:49 2015 UTC,"My point was that the ""very clearly defined"" term ""hate speech"" is in fact a bit ambiguous due to the fact people have varying defintions of what is offensive and the line where offensive changes to insulting.  Like someone could write a bad joke. The average person finds it offensive and tasteless. I come along and see it as insulting to my existence. So was that joke hate speech or not? The joke does not matter remember in the definition of hate speech only the feelings.  Specifically to attack your definition of hate speech, look at the term ""console peasant"" when used by the more unsavory members of pcmr. Clearly meant to insult, but by the definition you gave it isn't hate speech as console users are not a ethninticity, colour, national identity,  gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.

Anyway, I see your point, but I still think it's very easy to discern.  I agree that mods should very clearly define what it is to them, but it is going to come down to a judgement call.  In any forum, mods can remove comments that they feel attack others (for any reason, not just discrimination), and this is just a part of that.  In your example, you mentioned a bad joke that the average person finds offensive and you feel insulted by it.  Unless the joke was an attack on someone or someones, it's not hate speech.  It may be idiotic and ignorant, but hate speech is tied to intent.  Anyway, overall I just don't see any negatives coming out of this.  Maybe occasionally some prick can't be a prick in the way he wants to, but too bad... this isn't a first amendment issue."

Adding that to the sidebar lets the very people who you want to denounce know that we are a target, it lets the people who go nuts about free speech complain about something and bring their free speech obsession into the subreddit, and it has nothing to do with No Mans Sky. This subreddit isn't about reddit drama, I and many other people come here because it has nothing to do with reddit drama, and I honestly believe that that is part of the reason that this subreddit is so positive. We are a big group of people dreaming about exploring space, keep the subreddit about what it's about, and it will continue to stay pure as long as it can."

The problem is when hate finds hate, it reinforces both hates and then they start messing with other boundaries to see just what's weak and what specifically they can get away with. If it stays out, great. If it doesn't then better to have a policy in place early and not later. It also helps if you have a community that knows what its responsibilities are to itself.

Hate speech to me is something that incites violence or harm against another group of people because of discrimination. So it isn't an opinion or fact, it's a verbal attack.   Of course, standard insults don't count because they are usually aimed at a person because of something that person stated (as opposed to who that person is) and because standard insults aren't discriminatory.  And opinions or facts don't count as hate speech.   Lizard people are green.   This is a well known fact and is okay.   I hate lizard people.   This is an opinion, it's okay.   Lizard people must die.   This is not an opinion, it's inciting violence so it's not okay.  You could probably change a statement around to make it difficult to decide if it's hate speech or not... but that's where moderator discretion comes in. In those cases, we can check the user's history and talk to the user to figure out what's really going on."

I think the racists/haters of the world generally make themselves look stupid on their own and its nice to ""know where the idiots are.""   So many problems are poised by censorship that you would never anticipate until you start doing it. The all important question of ""Who decides?"" looms large as different things are said by different people in a million different contexts.  So I can't support any restrictions, but I join the rest of you in hoping that the various internet scumbags who pop around from time to time sod off."

I don't think this sub should inject itself into this mess. we're clearly not a hate sub, and reddit will continue to exist no matter what happens to the controversial subs. we have no dog in this fight. no one speaks for the whole subreddit and we aren't policymakers."

Not to mention he said there would be underground tunnels that you could explore. I mean this game and this universe are seemingly endless. The odds of me finding something someone else has discovered so quickly are already low. Not to mention the fact that they might not even have the tools to properly explore it at first glace. And the possibility of someone finding something you need and helping you get there are just too high to pass up. Everyone is going to play the game differently so it only makes me excited to think about watching someone else's videos or streams. If you look at the galactic map that IGN went through you can see how crazy huge the game world is. I'm not worried.   TLDR  Game world is huge. I want No Man's Sky in life now!"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3du0nq,blockanton,4,Sun Jul 19 13:32:55 2015 UTC,I think it would fit more the planets close to the center. Cuz this song is a bit scary and Sean said planets near center are becoming really weird and hostile. Barren planets shouldn't be scary cuz they're... barren. A silent and calm song would fit them
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du0nq,KubeQ11,3,Sun Jul 19 14:18:13 2015 UTC,https://euscr.bandcamp.com/album/sol-levit  Same artist and title. Might be the same song. Sounds like a barren planet to me.

Let me ask you this: Let's say a student is writing a science paper or something. They go on Google to look up information and use the info they find. At the end of their paper is a bibliography listing their sources. Would you consider that plagiarism?

The size of planets and the size of their moons are random which mean that the gravity could potentially be really unpleasant to play with... So now imagine that your first planet is a barren one, has a huge gravity and that you struggle to simply move and take off with your spaceship, i doubt it will be cool.   If you to see how much it's difficult to play with much more physics involved you should give some try in games like ""kerbal space program"" and stuff"

Low gravity planets really wouldnt advantage us, since we have or can get, jet packs.  Having a different gravity on each planet would add an annoying reality and provide no gain."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtju0,Ammonitida,4,Sun Jul 19 10:03:26 2015 UTC,"That's where suit upgrades would come in handy. Upgrades that minimized extreme gravity. Another use for the various resources that you'll be mining. But yeah, being FORCED to walk at a snail's pace on planets the size of gas giants would get annoying very fast.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtju0,Asekoth,2,Sun Jul 19 13:53:13 2015 UTC,It would be kind of difficult if we landed on a planet and died because the gravity crushed us. That is why they didn't add different gravity.

I built a new pc and it came with a bunch of game demos, and the full version of Morrowind. It was super ridiculously hard with the way combat and abilities worked, so I cheated the levels up to something reasonable like 75 or something, where you still got the occasional miss, which I thought was fair.  Anyway, it really allowed me to get more out of the game. So much lore in Morrowind."

I remember growing up watching my Dad play the original Half-Life, and then being so excited when the add-on games came out. I adored Blue Shift.  Then when Half-Life 2 was announced, I followed it religiously, I crazily excited. My Dad downloaded all the gameplay recordings from E3 and such, and I used to watch them every day.  I haven't felt that much excitement again until now... :D"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dsh8q,RdEydFcd,6,Sun Jul 19 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"Fallout 4, which I suppose is a bit strange. When this game was announced, I told friends that Fallout 4 was the only game I could possibly be more hyped about. Now that it's been announced, I find myself scraping for information on NMS more, but that's probably because Fallout is a known quantity.  Before that, though, was probably Fallout 3. I tend not to get too hyped for games too often, not since my early 20s. Having 2 games to be hyped about is something, considering my great wall of cynicism is so thick."

Hoping NMS will help balance out the equation since Melee is pretty hardcore and will probably give me severe arthritis. NMS should be more of a therapeutic experience, I'm hoping."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dsh8q,Nukidin,5,Sun Jul 19 01:24:50 2015 UTC,"Why do you hate it? It's a great game if u don't look at it at a competitive perspective.  I bought it, hoping it would be somewhat as competitive as melee and was disappoint hugely, but I still love playing it with friends and family."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dsh8q,MHasho,0,Sun Jul 19 01:38:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, sorry for using the word ""hate"", that's an overstatement. I actually like it as a casual game; smash run is tons of fun, and 8-player smash, items are fun, etc.  However nowadays I find myself playing Melee almost exclusively. There's a small competitive scene in my region with fun people, so I find myself practicing a lot in my spare time, and it gives me my ""competitive"" gaming fix.   I quit League of Legends to play Melee some more since League was taking so much time and was too stressful. Other than Melee, it's casual games for me, mainly Monster Hunter.  I can agree with you though, Smash 4 is lots of fun."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dsh8q,TrumpeterSwann,3,Sun Jul 19 14:22:58 2015 UTC,"Your hands will be fine, so long as you practice good habits. Most importantly, your arms, hands, and fingers should be relaxed even as you perform complex ATs. It is worth relearning how to do the most simple button presses to ensure you have a solid foundation to build from. For an example of not doing this, see Hax.   I play piano seriously (I've pulled days where I practice 12+ hours a day for consecutive days), and the only reason I don't have some kind of crippling injury is because I was forced to learn good technique from my teachers.   There are multiple threads on smashboards regarding hand health. Check them out!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dsh8q,MHasho,2,Sun Jul 19 06:26:20 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for the info!   Things like this could really be the future of Melee; Mang0 said recently he thinks he has another 2 years in him, and M2K is beginning to feel the burn as well. If the next generation of up and coming pros take better care of their hands, they could easily extend their career and outlive the success of some of the Gods.  Weird rambling aside, I'll take what you've said to heart, I'll definitely work on relaxing while playing the game. I'm sure it'll help!"

Being able to take on the role of Mario and rip through the Mushroom Kingdom as a super young kid was an absolute blast. It really shaped who I became today.  I have a couple of friends that shrug the game off because they can't hit up an NPC and gather up a bunch of quests to complete and turn in for loot. That does not bother me one bit. NMS is a much needed breath of fresh air. I want to kick back on my couch or at the computer and explore the unknown. Find my own unique adventure. Find my own solar system that is maybe filled with oddball creatures, terrain, resources, and more. Hell, I'm getting pumped up just thinking about it.  I've been a massive sci-fi fan since I was young and this game just looks/sounds so on point with what I want to dive into. I can, in a small way, fulfill my dream of being a legendary bounty hunter like Boba Fett or be a badass smuggler like Han Solo. It may not be perfect, but my imagination will make it so.  It will be so cool seeing what other adventurers encounter on their travels. It will also be phenomenal seeing where Hello Games and other developers take this type of procedural gaming.

I think using the Milky Way for calculations is a good middle ground between small and large galaxies.  According to Wikipedia, most galaxies in the observable universe are 1,000-100,000 parsecs in diameter. The Milky Way is estimated to be between 30,000-55,000 parsecs in diameter, which falls nicely in the middle. And while it is true that some elliptical galaxies such as IC 1101 (1.5 million parsecs) are absolutely massive, they are relatively rare."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dxhgx,derfloh205,2,Mon Jul 20 10:15:19 2015 UTC,"Look.. If you try to kill alien life for loot (if there even is some) then the Sentinel will go on you. If you want to defend yourself, they will come even more. At first you can mine those crystals that are everywhere.. but Sean said they give very little resources.. so to get more and rare resources you have to mine the planet directly what will cause again the Sentinels to attack you.  The space goat from the 18 Minute Video would have killed Sean in a few hits if he would not have paid attention  You cant land on every planet without troubles because on some i think you will get damage (of radiation, bad climate and so on) just by beeing there. So you have to know where you can land or have the right upgrades for your suit.  The footage we have seen for now takes place on the outer planets of the galaxy and Sean said it will be harder the more you fly to the center  -> So i believe it will not be Dark Souls style hard, however it will not be an ez pzy walkthrough."

If course this is all what we've seen and heard so far, the only people who can give us a real idea are those who've actually played the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dxhgx,TheRecherche,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:18:43 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. The space flight looks pretty simplified but you also have to remember several things.   We have seen fuck all gameplay of the space flight mechanics nor are we to see a proper dog fight so we might be surprised. Elite is a cool game. But it's very niche. NMS is going for a larger demographic so going full space sim and making docking with the space station a challenge isn't the direction Hello Games want to go in. A lot can change between now and release The gameplay we've seen (like the IGN First vids) are on a dev build or a build meant for the showcase specifically, this means a few possible things. The game is likely easier in places (stronger ship maybe) and the tech they use will be fairly high level (that multi-tool was pretty OP)   Overall I think a lot of your issues can be chalked up to them not showing much space stuff yet and toning down some game aspects to better show off others. I agree with you on the suit though. That ""it adjusts gravity for you"" line is weak. I'd love gravity on planet surfaces to be procedural to add that extra bit of variety. Various gravitational forces altering physics in space would be good to but there is a lot of space and lets just say there's a reason PS4 doesn't have Elite.  EDIT: I have been proven partially wrong and brought dishonour to my name. I am sorry."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dxhgx,MaxwellSalmon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:58:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use E:D as a comparison. The controls in ED assume a far future when no one has been able to design controls that make any improvement on the ones used in the first LEM.  Other aspects of technology have advanced, ftl travel, for example, but the controls all remain primitive. If the same  lack of progress were seen in automobiles, all modern cars would still be steering with tillers.  I think NMS actually takes a more realistic approach to futuristic controls. Basically, people tend to make things easier to control over time.  From a gameplay viewpoint, I personally like the approach NMS is taking, based on what I have seen in trailers, demos, etc. This is, of course a personal preference.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dtk46,Dreadnought_99,5,Sun Jul 19 09:09:47 2015 UTC,"Since there's no set narrative to this game, most trophies are probably gonna be about doing something like ""naming a planet"" ""take part in a space battle"" ""reaching the center of a galaxy"" ""go through a stargate"" ""kill a goat"" ""discover/mine every element from the periodic table"" ""explore a crashed ship"" ""upgrade your ship"" ""upgrade your suit"" ""upgrade your gun""...

NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,senor_tapatio,7,Sat Jul 18 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"I believe he means the max upgrade to the hyperdrive. The hyperdrive we start with only lets you jump as far as 3-5 star systems at a time. I believe he's saying it could get tedious if you have travelled very far, and you have do multiple jumps to reach your planet instead of one straight-shot jump."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,teaminus,4,Sat Jul 18 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok. I thought there was just one hyperdrive upgrade. I actually prefer it this way, there's a bigger sense of progression."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Lurking4Answers,3,Sat Jul 18 20:32:38 2015 UTC,We'll get a hyperdrive to get out of our first system and upgrade it on the way to the center but I think it will be later until we get upgrades that allow us to jump really far. Far enough to go back 50 systems or whatever to that planet.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Dicdonya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:41:01 2015 UTC,"So yet again, this game has taken elements from Spore, and then made them a million times better."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Dicdonya,6,Sun Jul 19 07:13:44 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, I haven't noticed it in any video or article, has anyone asked how easy it would even be to FIND an old planet/system?  Is there some sort of progression chart or planet history that can pull up on the galactic map showing where exactly you've been?  If not, and you're trying to look back and find a single system on the galactic map you've designated as ""home"" seems like it could be quite impossible, depending on how far away you are when trying to look back."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Dicdonya,5,Sat Jul 18 21:01:34 2015 UTC,"I hope there's some kind of register of the planets you've been, and specially a marker system. Those are a must on any sandbox game, and even more on NMS."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,DoctorLovejuice,3,Sat Jul 18 21:05:35 2015 UTC,"I would hope so too, and I would assume it will be. I was just curious if it has ever actually been brought up, and maybe I just missed it.   It's possible though that Sean hasn't implemented a locate planet/system on galactic map function, either by choice, or not thinking about it.   The game is about going forward, not back, with no base building, or even saving most changes made to a planet, it's not inconceivable an easy ""back"" button is not available."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Wolverine78,0,Sat Jul 18 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, the objective of the game is to get to the center of the universe, but Sean has said a couple times that it's something optional, so I don't see why you shouldn't be able to go back as easily as you go forward."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,DurMan667,2,Sat Jul 18 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it's optional, but there really isn't much point in going back, especially if you've already mostly explored a planet.   We agree that it makes sense to be able to go back, and have some sort of easy locate for already explored planets. I was just playing a little devils advocate, and exploring the possibility that it might not actually be easy to find a past planet."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Charlaquin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:32:10 2015 UTC,"There's nothing stopping you taking note of your entire journey; system to system, planet to planet.  100% traceability would undeniably make it easy to travel back."

Even after i go to the centre of the galaxy  and see whats there ii will contunue playing and exploring."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,rillip,3,Sat Jul 18 20:37:56 2015 UTC,When you find one you really like you'll be able to bookmark it and explore it later.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,pstuddy,3,Sat Jul 18 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think this would be a great strategy for a Trader type. Just set up a nice lucrative trade route between a few systems, and pick a base of operations somewhere in the middle you can settle in when you're not trading or mining."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,NekoMadeOfWaifus,3,Sat Jul 18 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"This has actually been a plan of mine for awhile now. I'm going to find a solar system that I love that has planets that all are really cool AND rich in resources, even if it takes a long time to find it. The thought of going off on long adventures exploring all of the surrounding solar systems, venturing towards the center of the universe, then finally warping back into that solar system/ atmosphere that you love just gives me the feels. I'm very excited for this plan that I have lol"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Wulf_Star_Strider,3,Sat Jul 18 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"I think this absolutely goes against how the game is meant to be played. That being said, yes. I am interested to see if people start devising cartographic strategies for more widespread exploration on a planetary scale. I secretly hope a small community of such explorers arises and that maybe people work together to fully explore individual planets."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,AntonRuscov1,3,Sun Jul 19 01:58:42 2015 UTC,I've thought about doing this for a while on my first spawn planet before going out into space.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,AntonRuscov1,3,Sun Jul 19 02:36:09 2015 UTC,"actually, making the planet that you first start on as your home planet has more meaning to the term ""home planet"" because it is your birthplace and where it all began!!!  i know that every now and then, i will always come back to visit the first planet that gave birth to me and where my journey began! it will always be a very special place to me! XD"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,AntonRuscov1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, it'll probably be special too, but imagine that you spawn on the most barren planet in the whole universe. That's why I want to explore a bit first."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,AntonRuscov1,2,Sun Jul 19 07:46:22 2015 UTC,Everyone will spawn on a hospitable planet.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,trkmstrwggy,3,Mon Jul 20 12:07:41 2015 UTC,I might do that. Would probably choose a planet with a portal on it.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,teaminus,2,Sun Jul 19 12:20:17 2015 UTC,Won't really be possible unless you don't want to travel very far from the planet.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Mighty_The_Man,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:41:49 2015 UTC,"There's still hyperdrive, which is basically a ""quick travel"" upgrade for your ship."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,CA719,2,Sat Jul 18 21:04:22 2015 UTC,"yeah but that's not how it works, the hyper drive won't take you everywhere, it is limited in the distance it can take you, not to mention you need to refuel so that limits how far you can go even farther."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Shoninjv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"I knew about the fuel, but I guess you can upgrade the hyperdrive to take you virtually anywhere? I thought it was this way until someone told me on this same thread that the first upgrade would only take you 3-5 systems away. Do we really need to make small jumps to go from one place to the other?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,ThyJuiceBox,3,Sat Jul 18 21:17:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would go against how the dev's would want you play if you could get a hyper drive that could take to one end of the galaxy to the other in just one go. To get anywhere you need to star hop and fuel up afterwards."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,NekoMadeOfWaifus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right. Although on every video we've seen, Sean warps from one point of the universe to a really far one. Maybe the upgraded hyperdrive covers really big distances, or maybe it kinda ""deactivates"" when you're near the center of the universe."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Dat_Coffee,4,Sat Jul 18 21:22:30 2015 UTC,"Because it is his version, the dev version, of the game so he is able to ignore things like hyperdrive limitations"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Ha7den,3,Sat Jul 18 21:28:27 2015 UTC,Sean is in Sean-mode. he can go anywhere.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Battlefront528,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:28:37 2015 UTC,lol what if the center of the universe is just Sean giving you the ability to teleport anywhere  Congratulations. You're on Sean-mode now.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,ThyJuiceBox,2,Sun Jul 19 04:28:41 2015 UTC,I think if you find a system with a bunch if portals that would become your home planet for a while.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,cwolb,2,Sun Jul 19 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"*or her  and kind of, yes. A particularly interesting planet to always return to."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Wulf_Star_Strider,3,Mon Jul 20 06:59:12 2015 UTC,"Not really, no. This game is too large to keep going back to one planet..."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,DougVig,2,Sat Jul 18 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"No, I think it undermines the explorative nature of the game if you constantly feel tied to a home."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,Wulf_Star_Strider,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"Why? What would be the purpose of regularly going back to a planet you have already explored? This would defeat the purpose of the game. You are supposed to explore and get closer to the centre of the galaxy. As you get further towards the centre, you find more bizarre planets and creatures. So by staying close to one planet, you are missing out on a lot of potential discoveries."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drm4j,DougVig,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:06:58 2015 UTC,"As if you would have fully explored the planet, and some people like to have a place to call home. But to me home, is my lifepod."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,_therealchin,9,Sun Jul 19 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"I doubt that. Sean has said that the planets become more alien when you move closer to the center of the galaxy, which means they specifically adjust some parameters in the formula that builds the universe.  This, coupled with the fact that they can just tell the game to not place any player on a planet they can't handle even if those exist on the edge of the galaxy...  Also, since the ship doesn't work in water, I don't think there's gonna be any 100% water planets - unless they will have, say, trading posts or some other structures to land on then explore the water."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DawnBlue,4,Sun Jul 19 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"Well, ships can land on the surface of the water. But yeah starting on an ocean planet would make no sense."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,KubeQ11,2,Sun Jul 19 14:21:36 2015 UTC,You mean ships can double as boats?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,Ammonitida,3,Sun Jul 19 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"No, you can only land on water. No swimming."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,KubeQ11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:29:28 2015 UTC,Hopefully some ship upgrades can rectify that. I'd like to have our ships double as land rovers too.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,Ammonitida,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"I doubt that, because it would probably simplify things too much... then, on the other hand, you can already just hop into ship and fly over land OR sea.  I wonder if fuel also restricts normal flight (not just warping) which is a good reason to not do that all the time"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DawnBlue,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure fuel effects normal flight too. Unlimited flight without needing to refuel would make the game too easy for those who decided to stay in one system (which Sean has said is an option). As for flying over it all, that depends on how maneuverable your ship is. A rover or boat would likely give you better control. If fuel effects normal flight, then it balances out. Plus, you always have to exit your ship to mine for resources anyway. Or could we put a mining laser on the ship too? hahahahaha"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,Ammonitida,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:14:43 2015 UTC,"Well, didn't he also say you can fly without a warp drive between solar systems :P I can't imagine that would be possible without unlimited or a very long lasting fuel supply  I know I would love to have some of those, but I just don't think it's gonna happen :("
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DawnBlue,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:28:13 2015 UTC,Now you have me really worried. :(  Perhaps or hopefully he didn't think that answer through.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,Ammonitida,2,Sun Jul 19 15:35:20 2015 UTC,"Fuel for general flying is unlimited, warp fuel is not."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,THEKlNGSNAKE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:18:06 2015 UTC,Sean has said fuel will only be consumed by warping. Inside a solar system no fuel will be consumed.  The reason for this is them not wanting players to get stuck.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DrFeargood,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:43:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking about that. So it's going to be like Battlestar Galactica Online, as far as fuel consumption is concerned. I can live with that."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DawnBlue,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:10 2015 UTC,"Sean did say in the podcast that it's possible to have a planet completely covered in water.   I'm sure there's something in place so what I mentioned doesn't happen, but at the same time....it could be possible."

As for your ship being a rover too not going to happen how ever when he talks about developing the game after launce he uses adding land vehicals ti the game"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DawnBlue,2,Sun Jul 19 15:43:45 2015 UTC,"So much misinformation, your ships have unlimitate fuel is for hyper drive.   What? Did I say anything opposite of this? Actually, what does this even mean... what are you trying to say?   Unless something change recently you cannot land on water, source?   Source for what? That we can land on water, or that we can't?  I don't have source for either because in all the information I've gone through so far nothing has ever implied that you can OR can not land on water. Simply put, I have no idea  However I know that 100% water planets exist now, that's even in the Information Archive on this subreddit."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DawnBlue,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:57:03 2015 UTC,Could you clarify what you meant with the first one though? Did you mean that ships have unlimited fuel and only warp drive needs some sort of refueling?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,TigTrivers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:04:41 2015 UTC,Thats been the word around the sub for a long time not sure where it was originated from
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DawnBlue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:11:45 2015 UTC,I see. Well the thing is I've kinda had the same... feeling for a long time too.  Like it's somehow implied - I think Sean talked about spending fuel on trading (between systems to buy low / sell high) and obviously that was warp drive he meant. There has been no mention of normal flight using fuel AFAIK.

Whether planets such as you describe can be found on the galactic priphery where players start, we wont know until the game is out.  Certainly there is variation in the starting planets and some people will get lucky while others will be unlucky."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:20:17 2015 UTC,One concern though is if you're able to keep starting new games until you have a mineral rich head start. Would love to see how they get around new character creation.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,DawnBlue,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:32 2015 UTC,Enter profile info. Enter email. Enter name. Forevermore that is who you play as.  Honestly though in the IGN first vid they said barren worlds are minerally rich. So fly to the barren planet to start.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du3rm,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"For PC, maybe. Although you can just enter another profile info and make a second account :p  Would be pretty stupid to do that just for a better start though >_< at least if you ask me.  The game is basically at it's heart random - yeah, it's exactly like it is for everyone and it's not actually random, but every element is different and you can't predict much anything.  You can't know that the next planet or system you find is not super poor in minerals, so restarting until you get a good start seems just... absurd"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3droei,funkymotha,8,Sat Jul 18 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness Elite Dangerous is extremely similar to no man's sky except the planet exploration is WIP. There is a procedural galaxy with more stars than you will ever explore. I think that it's more serious and realistic than NMS, I think that NMS will be the game for anyone, and Elite is just soooo goddamn daunting trying to even figure out how the game works. It's fun and beautiful but also stressful and a bit scary. I think that NMS is going to be more 'fun', but in the meantime I recommend giving Elite a peek."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droei,GregoryGoose,4,Sat Jul 18 21:33:29 2015 UTC,I got ED during the sale last week. I find it a surprisingly rewarding game. You really have to learn how to do things in it. It doesn't hold your hand at all. But once you start figuring stuff out it's very rewarding.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droei,Tangerynebear,2,Sun Jul 19 02:06:08 2015 UTC,"spot on for E:D. The planet exploration would be nice, but until it's added I've been playing Ark.

NMS will have all the weird interesting shit and I have a feeling that Elite is going to just be terrain. There might be outposts to land at but I just don't see them adding life. I think that sacrificing realism is going to make NMS more popular and enjoyable but I think that Elite is perfect for the hardcore player. I feel like I'd have to spend days playing it just to play it right. It isn't the kind of game where I can sit down and play for an hour and then call it a day."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3droei,Tangerynebear,2,Sun Jul 19 02:04:17 2015 UTC,"being an idiot aside, no. since he has never played the game again after the incident (had to buy a new monitor). It was about 2 months ago, every time I mention it he kinda just walks away..."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droei,Gryphon0468,2,Sun Jul 19 02:10:31 2015 UTC,"Lol. Tell him to extend his landing gear before flying into the entrance, also full power to shields and 2 to engines. Also you need to be facing away from the entrance to land, just go nice and slow then use the radar guide to land straight."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3drtlt,Hunjay,7,Sat Jul 18 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"2 - I hope players generally take naming things seriously also. I enjoyed that parody video but I'd rather not have a bunch of flying cockface creatures (and similarly named things). It will hurt my immersion. Unless it actually looks like a cockface. Then I'll probably laugh at it.  7 - In one of the videos Sean was telling a story where he saw a crazy upgrade deep underwater and died before he could reach it. He also said stuff doesn't usually spawn down there and it was an anomaly. So its unlikely, but maybe possible? Also, the Giantbomb podcast said we can't dig any deeper than 128 meters. I too wanted to dig to the core of a planet and see what was down there (and probably die).  9 - Following a ship to see its routine is a great idea. I think we'll be somewhat limited -- I don't think when a ship warps out of system you can tell where they're going. But for ships that fly between frigates and trading outposts, this should definitely be possible.  13 - I think the jetpack has a set amount of energy and recharges between bursts. I also think its likely that it will be upgradeable/replaceable. I think its the ""tech behind no man's sky"" video where you can see Sean Murray use the jetpack and he fires it in bursts.  14 - The builds we've seen of the game have all been tweaked to have more creatures and life-supporting planets. Its possible that we're seeing more crystals because of that too. Also, there are probably other types of crystals we haven't seen, since everything is procedural.  16 - Sean Murray has said the game isn't a space sim. You won't see planets smashing into each other or anything like that. So I think meteor showers are unlikely. But I think someone asked about landing on a comet and he said you could do that? So there should be astral bodies besides planets, moons and stars for us to observe and play with.  edit: apparently the pound key is the code for bold text. Oops."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3drtlt,EuphoricDissonance,3,Sat Jul 18 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"7 - I've heard Sean mention the upgrade underwater, but I don't believe I've listened to the Giantbomb podcast. That may be the only NMS related thing that I haven't heard or seen.   9 - I meant the ones that fly between trading posts.   13 - I hope they limit jetpacking, but not too much.   14 - I know the builds have amped the life on planets, I just hope they're also affecting the crystals. I find that there are too many of them currently.   16 - I know that it isn't a space simulator, but they do have weather, and there are asteroid belts that border planets. I was just entertaining the thought of meteor showers."

I can't wait to just take off toward the stars, but at the same time, I think I'll have a difficult time doing so.  so will I  â¢ I really hope that most players decide to take the naming of discoveries seriously.  I hope so too. That's the piece that turns me off from always online part of gameplay  â¢ If there is ever a reflective material, do our players not show up in the reflection? I ask this due to Sean saying the only way we'll know what we look like is to see another player.  *as far as I know reflective material like water won't even show what you look like. If it did you just may be a blob color. * â¢ If I meet another player and there is no way to communicate via voice or text, I will carve my name into the terrain.  i think you may need a mining upgrade to do that. Remember seeing Sean shoot the ground and he didn't dig? â¢ If I reach a planet that my friend is on, I will instruct them to fly in the orbit of the planet as I do the same. I will change directions multiple times until I find the ship that is just orbiting the planet with me, instead of trying to find them on land.  *not a bad idea. Make sure you're not near a space station to narrow down the ship choices. * â¢ If the center of the universe allows for teleportation to friends, we need to name a planet after Reddit and maybe get the forum members populating an area.  speculations! â¢ I want to find a crazy upgrade at the bottom of an ocean or at the center of a planet.  i do too want to find something underwater. Though we can't go to the center of a planet. Only about 100 meters down. â¢ What types of weapons/tools do you think exist in the game? How ridiculous or 'out there' could they get, realistically?  *well. Every gun/tool is procedurally generated and there's an almost endless style of tool/weapon so it can get quite rediculous. * â¢ I want to follow a ship for a long time and see what its routine or loop looks like.  hehe sounds fun. What happens when it gets attacked? Will you defend it? â¢ Sean once said that it is possible to sprint in the game instead of just walking around. I want to see that this is possible. I want to see him run during gameplay.  *ditto. That doesn't have to be a big secret. He did show the jetpack off. * â¢ I wonder if the big space stations have rooms and decks to explore inside of them, or if they are closed off and restricted to a one-hallway-type space.  *not sure. I hope there's something we can see inside. * â¢ I don't want them to fix the glitch that allows you to fly creatures into space by picking them up with your ship.  they probably will. I didn't even know that could happen â¢ Does the jetpack have a certain amount of fly-time before it must recharge before use? Or is it infinite, continuous flying? If so, what prevents us from flying into space without our ship?  i wonder this too â¢ I wish the crystals on a planet's surface weren't as frequent, or weren't as frequent on all planets.  *Ditto. But they don't have much money anyhow. They remind me a bit of Tiberium. * â¢ I love the way the shores' waters rise and fall, as seen in the leaked Part 2 gameplay footage.  ditto â¢ It would be pretty cool to see meteor showers happening sometimes.  *ditto. Then go find it and get the minerals/resources from them *"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dts43,Dreadnought_99,12,Sun Jul 19 11:33:02 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the procedurally generated weapons and ships system works much like the unique-weapon system in the Borderlands games.  If you've ever played Borderlands, there are a number of manufacturers that each specialize in a different type of skill or ability. Some examples of this are Jacobs, Torque and Hyperion which each have skills such as high damage, explosive rounds and high fire-rate respectively.  As you progress through the game, the player can discover weapons that feature parts from different manufacturers. For example, you may find a sniper rifle with a Hyperion stock (For high fire rate) Jacobs Body (For high damage) and a Torque barrel (For explosive rounds.)  The result of this system is a game that provides a unique experience for the player each time they pick up a weapon, often with destructive results. While I am sure that the number of ships and guns in No Man's Sky won't be nearly as common as the guns in Borderlands, it makes all weapons well rounded and suitable for a variety of different tasks.  Much like giving your car a ridiculous paint job in GTA Online, procedurally generated weapons and ships sets you apart from the rest of the crowd. Even if you never see another player in No Man's Sky, you can take comfort in the fact that the equipment you use is unique, and there is truly nothing like it in the universe.  EDIT: Just thought I would clarify, I didn't mean there would be 'manufacturers' but instead a set of wings, nosecones, cockpits etc. from which the ships are generated."

If you think of what happened to Sean in the 18 minute video, where he was attacked by a purple goat creature, when he defended himself by killing the animal, he was immediately attacked by Sentinels and killed. So, in a way, to the player, they could be considered malevolent.  This also ties nicely into the fact that there are no living intelligent civilizations on planets. The Sentinels could be so protective that they end up killing anything that becomes too advanced to prevent them from killing too much and destroying the environment."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,Sinjobean,5,Sat Jul 18 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"I really hope water flows. I would be ecstatic about making rivers from and to the sea.   However that made me think, just how far or long does the game remember changes you've made to a planet? I know minor changes to planets systems don't save permanently, but how much remembering does it actually do?  I'm also curious about this for cave diving. If I make an entrance to a cave system, explore the cave system, will I be able to find my original entrance, or will it disappear the second I move out of sight?  Does anyone know?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,Dicdonya,4,Sat Jul 18 21:19:32 2015 UTC,It will surely not disappear when you come back to the top cause your changes are all locally saved. But i dont know how far you have to go away to reset it or if it never resets?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,derfloh205,3,Sat Jul 18 22:22:04 2015 UTC,Yeah that's kind of where my question came from. I was wondering how the environmental changes are saved.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,DJSkrillex,3,Sat Jul 18 22:44:10 2015 UTC,I think the engine will remember.  Imagine that you remove some numbers from an equation and leave. When you return the equation will still be missing the numbers you removed.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,kvothe5688,3,Sat Jul 18 23:05:05 2015 UTC,that doesn't work that way.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,Dicdonya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about this statement?  I coulda sworn that once you leave an area(unknown what exactly the distance is) the changes you've made are not saved?  So you could for example, destroy a mountain, get in your ship, fly off the planet, come back and the mountain returns.   I really hope you're right, because I love the idea of permanent changes to planets, even if I'm the only one who can see them."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,Mesophyll,2,Sun Jul 19 03:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's in the FAQ;   If I kill a species, will it stay dead? If an area is mined, will it stay mined?  If you do something of significance, it will be shared. Insignificant things will only be saved locally. Things like killing a bird aren't significant, but things like destroying a space station are.   There's a more definitive quote out there somewhere that deals with saving small scale terrain destruction permanently locally but I can't for the life of me find it right now. We'll both have to wait and see. :)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,Dicdonya,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:11:12 2015 UTC,"If you could find that quote that would be great. The quote above is a little dubious, simply because there is the lack of the word permanent.   In the gameplay video, sean killed a goat, then when he died and came back the same location the goat was back. He even specifically said he was going to attempt to avoid it again, which he did then ran into another one. So it would seem that killing a goat isnt saved, or, maybe small changes like killing a goat arent saved unless you ""save"" the game at a beacon? It could also just be simple respawn of the goat.   Like I said I hope you are right, just seems its not quite as cut and dry as, kill a goat, goat is gone now on the local side of the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,NekoMadeOfWaifus,2,Sun Jul 19 14:55:21 2015 UTC,I think I saw multiple goats around there.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,Mesophyll,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:15 2015 UTC,"Like I said, really can't find it so we'll just have to wait until the game comes out or something. Who knows, maybe I'm misremembering a quote from articles gone past.  The beacons seem to act as 'save points' that save all your progress locally, and upload any discoveries, rather than the game auto-saving every few seconds. Maybe if he had reached a beacon the goat would be dead, maybe it wouldn't, it could very well just be a respawn. We just don't know :b"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,Asekoth,5,Mon Jul 20 00:24:14 2015 UTC,Hopefully water flows. It would kinda be a game breaker if water was static. It is unconfirmed currently how water acts.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,TheCoolman78,4,Sat Jul 18 20:22:28 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool if liquid moved and reacted based on what it was made of. Like a planet with liquid clouds because the liquid is made out of helium.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3droee,Krebstar_,3,Sat Jul 18 21:50:56 2015 UTC,Well rivers and waterfalls are confirmed so that should imply that water does in fact flow. Hopefully that is the case.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3du7wt,OddDustin,6,Sun Jul 19 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"No, there must be some sort of a filter for which planets are suitable to be starting ones."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du7wt,Deroni76,0,Sun Jul 19 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"Why? I think it'd be quite a cool commentary on life if there were the possibility that you started off in a place where you had little/no chance of surviving long enough to escape.  I mean, there probably will be a filter because most people likely wouldn't enjoy starting off merely to die, but I don't see why there must be one."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du7wt,Gutterflame,2,Sun Jul 19 15:04:31 2015 UTC,They've already stated that the planets get more dangerous and weird the closer to the center. It makes sense that the outer edges are safe planets that aren't impossible to explore (especially makes sense for why chose to start us off on the edge). They have however said that you may start on a barren planet vs one with life.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du7wt,klovasos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I wasn't arguing that players could start somewhere inescapable, only questioning the philosophy behind why they must. Obviously it's a game and from a gameplay perspective that probably wouldn't be much fun but, as I said to /u/Deroni76, I quite like the notion that the universe could crap all over you from the outset.  It's probably a symptom of my pessimistic worldview. I wouldn't read too much into it. I guess a barren planet will have to suffice in my case :p"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3du7wt,Gutterflame,3,Sun Jul 19 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"It just wouldn't make sense. Plus, imagine this: You start the game, spawn at a planet, die immediatelly, respawn, die again, etc."

Or at least the ability to ""re-roll"" for which planet you start on, although that would have its own issues with people discovering 5,000 planets a day without a ship by restarting over and over."

And ""How long do you want it to take to get to the center?"".  When you start any normal game, story-driven, open world, whatever, do you make a big list of what you're going to do in chronological order?  The answer to that, for most people, is no. No Man's Sky is not some philosophical experiment, it's not the second coming of Christ, it's a game. I don't think this will be a game people will be disappointed by, but some of these lists and goals people make will just never be fulfilled. Basically what I'm saying is, let the game unfold as you play it.  VB, out."

I see some threatening looking creatures, but I try hard to stay on the outer perimeter of their territory. Unfortunately for me, I slip... They're after me, but I run to a nearby cave and i'm greeted by a ledge. The creatures are still after me, my fate is looking grim. I look down and see a body of water that's not too far. I don't know how deep it is, but I take my chances and jump. The creatures stop at the ledge, looking down at me. I swim to the nearest land. The cave is illuminated by glowing crystals. I follow the obvious big path, almost like it is there to lead me to something. I step on a stone that sinks into the ground, and before you know it, snakes are coming at me from behind! I run, but the snakes are catching up, there's a gap. I jump across it, but I don't make it... Not fully at least. There I am, hands grasped on the the edge hanging for dear life. I use my strength to pull my self up to safety. I think i'm all good, but a boulder crashes down from the path in front of me, so without thinking, I jump into the gap. I fall into a rapid stream and it's crashing waves take me with it effortlessly. I crash down a small waterfall and land into a more calm, shallow body of water. I get up, sore, exhausted, but alert. I  take a gander ahead of me. I see an alien looking structure. It looks technological, but it's old and corroded. It's emanating light from it's cracks. Finally, after so much trouble, I think I've found what I've been looking for. All of this work would have been worth it... I open the container, and there it is. I couldn't believe my eyes. Finally.

Here's to hoping that the effect was heavily increased for demo purposes. Also shooting an animal that is attacking you should not warrant such a deadly response.

This undoubtedly included the drones. On an actual planet sized planet, I would imagine that you would find areas where no drones will be in sight, just as there might not be any animals in sight.   In the IGN First 18 minute play demo, Sean mentioned that the drone ""saw"" him kill the goat, and that's why it attacked. We might safely assume that if there are no drones in sight, we might be able to defend ourselves against aggressive wildlife without incurring a wanted level."

Mine crystals while collectors are nearby: wanted.  I don't know to what extend this is in the final game, maybe the ASRP was ramped up a bit for the demos, but it cuts deep on myself feeling as a explorer. More like in a museum: look, don't touch!  I am really hot for this game. Hopefully they give out the release date, soon. The ASRP-thing is my biggest concern about the game.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ds9oq,BlackNotesIII,5,Sat Jul 18 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"From the eurogamer 2014 e3 coverage.  So what actually happens should you ever cross paths with another player? ""We haven't really talked about multiplayer, but I want kind of a Journey-esque feel to it,"" says Murray. ""You get a sense that you're playing with other people, and you can see the actions of other people, plus you'll share things that are significant - if you take out a space station, we'll share that, and that'll be shared across the entire universe - but if you shoot down a bird, that won't be. In terms of interactions, it's really infrequent. But when it happens we want people to get a feel that we're playing with other people. We're doing that in loads of different ways - for instance, when you fly to the centre of the galaxy, when you get there is something you can do, and that causes an event and that is seen by everyone."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ds9oq,derfloh205,2,Sun Jul 19 00:04:56 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ds9oq,Flaming-Driptray,4,Sun Jul 19 08:46:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly hope nothing happens. I would hate for one player to undermine everyone else's endeavours to reach the centre.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ds9oq,KubeQ11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's like in game Journey. You see some signs while playing the game (for example falling star) but you find out what that means when you reach the end of the game by yourself. That is really a cool feature. Because you see mysterious events on the sky, not knowing really what they mean. No worries, center of the galaxy won't be spoiled ;)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ds9oq,TemptedDreamer,2,Sun Jul 19 02:31:07 2015 UTC,"To clarify to all who read this it happens to everyone. Not just the first person to reach the center.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3duqh1,DarthGrabass,8,Sun Jul 19 18:07:25 2015 UTC,"Do keep in mind that this is a game, and in dropping some of those features it would start to look more like a tech demo to show off procedural generation than an actual video game.  That being said, if you're worried about the sentinels ruining your experience, you can take solace in the knowledge that they won't be on every planet.  If you REALLY want to murder alien rodents for sport without any consequences, it won't be too difficult to find planets without those annoying robot morality police.  As for the suits, I imagine that the progression of upgrading your suit would feel fairly natural as you play. ""Hey, I've got a lot of resources because I just spent a while poking around this cool planet I found! Heck, it's enough to upgrade my suit! I think I'll do that.""  And in any case, the more dangerous planets won't be too common until you start moving closer toward the center of the galaxy, so I imagine you generally won't need to worry about it holding you back for the most part, at least not early on.

I don't like easy games. If you want that, stick to SpaceEngine.  What I don't like is how quickly you exit your ship and enter it. It's almost like teleportation. The animation needs to be longer and more polished. Further, the warp animation could use some work too. Make it longer to give the player a sense of vastness.   Like many other players, I'm also worried that Sean has abandoned his 90/10 rule. We still have not seen a crater marked planet like Mercury. 99% have been tropical paradises."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3duqh1,Ammonitida,6,Sun Jul 19 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"You enter and exit your ship fast because they don't want it to get annoying. It's for convenience.

I thought it was amusing that he said Habik-Ogan was biologically barren, but after the scan at 1:13 we see a few creatures moving. Â¯\(ã)/Â¯  When the scan is performed, I noticed that it showed a bunch of boxes on-around the resource rock - Is that an indication of which parts of the rock were more resource rich?

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Nicholost,15,Fri Jul 17 16:22:18 2015 UTC,"Have we seen a light on your suit? Wondering how we'll see down in the caves, barring bioluminescence. I assume no planting of 'torches', for instance."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Camtreez,13,Fri Jul 17 16:30:47 2015 UTC,It looks like you will never be in complete darkness; the ground will always be partially illuminated.  I don't know though.  Just basing this assumption off this:  https://youtu.be/-h5vwfEaONg?t=2m1s
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Renegade_Meister,12,Fri Jul 17 16:36:55 2015 UTC,I'm kind of bummed they changed the scanning animation from this video into the more recent one. I like the multiple lines of this scanning more than the solid looking wave in the recent builds.   But maybe the animation changes as you upgrade your tool. That would be pretty neat.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,blueExcess,5,Fri Jul 17 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"Good point - This makes me wonder though if the scanning in this picture were player triggered scans or a psuedo night vision that regularly ""scans"" in dark areas thus providing some illumination?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,shogunno1,2,Fri Jul 17 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"It's funny- I've seen all those trailers at least 100 times, but just noticed some things: at 7:19 the two-legged walker sentinel on the glowing-blobby planet (my favorite kind) wakes up and seems WAY bigger than it does in more recent videos. Second was a spinning crystal thing (the shop interface?) in the outpost at 9:41. Does that AT-ST sentinel look bigger to anyone else or is it just me?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Crosbie71,5,Fri Jul 17 19:13:37 2015 UTC,In the 18min video when Sean jumps into the water he swims by a plant which appears to get illuminated by a light from the player
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Darthvodka,3,Fri Jul 17 16:47:50 2015 UTC,Just rewatched the 18min video and noticed that underwater. Seems v. short-range though... upgradeable?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Nicholost,10,Fri Jul 17 17:10:10 2015 UTC,new technologies (blueprints?) can be found at cargo pods and unique sites   Can we say that there is reason to explore downed freighters or ships we might find on planets like this or this?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,TigTrivers,7,Fri Jul 17 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, and beyond simple curiosity.  I always assumed they would contain stocks of resources, but I had not considered they may contain new technologies as well.  This video confirms the latter it is true.  Kinda cool."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Nicholost,6,Fri Jul 17 16:55:36 2015 UTC,He mentioned a while back you can fix up crashed ships for yourself aswell
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,e-pocalypse,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"Whoa, seriously?  I missed that in previous videos and am now completely stoked for it.  Thanks for pointing that out."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,cRucker,39,Fri Jul 17 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"While I agree that I want more out of these videos I would say that IGN First is not targeting those of us on this Subreddit-who are the ""already convinced"" group. We are the early adopters--some of us have been tracking this game for more than a year or even 18 months. At this point it's not a matter of whether we buy the game but whether we buy an entirely new computer to play it or whether to buy an entirely new couch to sit on while playing it on a PS4.  These videos are targeted at those who haven't heard much of the game, or only know a little bit--or even don't get why some of their friends are into it. So, let's consider these videos as the kind we can show others so they get an idea about the game. What I liked about this video was that the planets were diverse or at least a noob would think so. Most of us here have a fascination with the truly barren but resource rich planets, which I still hope exist. However, the middle-adopters (not us) are not going to be excited about those planets much. Instead, seeing these kinds of very different planets makes a middle-adopter more interested.  I agree that none of the IGN first videos, including the first one, really rung my bell. But my bell has been ringing since 8 December 2013.  tl;dr: These videos are for middle-adopters not us. Share them with others while we wait for breadcrumb hints of release date."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,ArtemAbramov,3,Fri Jul 17 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, I own an Xbox One, don't have a gaming pc, and I still follow this game religiously and plan on picking it up when its available to me."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Kouklitza,4,Fri Jul 17 21:33:57 2015 UTC,Well you guys on X1 have Elite: Dangerous!  I'm waiting it be released on PS4 but it's a time exclusive :(
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,nomansblade,2,Fri Jul 17 23:49:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Whilst I haven't been active in this subreddit, I was convinced I was going to buy this game since E3 last year. I understand what I'm getting with this game so I know my expectations aren't going to be crushed when I get it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Anus_Blenders,95,Sat Jul 18 04:03:40 2015 UTC,"I've just seen the title and I think I'm going to have a heart attack from sheer joy.  Edit: :(   For three of the planets the footage has already been shown. It wasn't exactly a tour either, the camera was just slowly moved around. The information as far as I can tell was already known to us, It's not a bad video as such but the title is really clickbaity and misinformative. It's nice to see two new planets being shown though.  Also what's up with that guy's voice? I was about to have a second heart attack.  Edit2: If anyone's wondering about the deleted comment u/AntonRuscov1 said:""calling it now OP is lying about the footage of planets being previously shown"". My response was:  ""The OP of this thread isn't me, OP means ""original poster"" so that's Pantheon7. You're either a troll or haven't seen a single ign video (you really think I'd get this many upvotes if I was making stuff up?).  Planet 5 is shown at the very start of this video while Planet 2 is shown around 0:24:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UgFNPg9qUXI  Planet 3 is shown at the very start of this video:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=icw5tg-H3xc  You know you should really check your facts before accusing others of not,it's embarrassing for you.""."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,devinup,34,Fri Jul 17 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"IGN probably doesn't have all that much footage, so they're milking it for all it's worth."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Renegade_Meister,13,Fri Jul 17 16:24:25 2015 UTC,Don't get too excited. It's 2 minutes long and you've seen a few of the planets already.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,thinkadrian,4,Fri Jul 17 16:06:15 2015 UTC,For three of the planets the footage has already been shown.   Good catch - Must've been shown in videos I haven't watched yet.  Which planets were repeats?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,itsQoe,75,Fri Jul 17 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"The barren planet wasn't barren, it had plant life!"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Avohaj,35,Fri Jul 17 16:12:11 2015 UTC,And an animal in the bottom center.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,squat251,11,Fri Jul 17 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"Well technically barren doesn't have to mean completely devoid of life, it could also refer to sparse life (low diversity, less complexity). This planet was definitely not what people expected from a barren planet - basically a ""dead rock in space"", like all the other telluric planets and moons in our solar system, so I'm wondering if these do exist after all. Boring as they would be."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,fpzero,2,Fri Jul 17 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda like how a ""desert island"" is really just a deserted island IE, no humans, not necessarily without plants and animals."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,devinup,11,Fri Jul 17 20:46:05 2015 UTC,"There is an explanation for this, and that is they captured the video using the E3 build. The same build that has maxed out life and almost every planet will have a beacon."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,fpzero,6,Fri Jul 17 17:06:58 2015 UTC,Every planet will have bacon?! :o
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,grgisme,3,Fri Jul 17 19:17:12 2015 UTC,"No.  Let me edit: we simply don't know enough to say.  Â   The E3 build will populate a beacon near the player, even if it is not supposed to be there. This is to allow demonstration of turning in discoveries and whatnot. The actual game might have 0-1 beacons per system, pushing heavily on the former would make dying that much worse."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,BlackNotesIII,26,Fri Jul 17 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"Seriously, it may be that we need to start actually believing that every planet has some sort of life on it. This video... is either EXTREMELY misleading, or we all need to adjust our expectations."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,grgisme,27,Fri Jul 17 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"We've seen like .0000001% of planets in the game, all tailored by HG or IGN to be interesting. You really think they put up a video of 5 totally random planets?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,BlackNotesIII,8,Fri Jul 17 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"Of course they wouldn't. We know they didn't. I'm still hopeful it follows what Sean has said, as that makes the most sense.  But I'm just pointing out that HG would typically have reviewing approval of these videos... or one would think. And if that planet wasn't something they considered ""barren"", you'd think they would correct them."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,CoreyGoodine14,3,Fri Jul 17 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure HG has that much say in what IGN releases apart from spoilers or things Sean doesn't want to reveal yet. I could be wrong but IGN could be like ""well we're going to do it this way if you want the month long coverage because this is what our viewers want, etc."" and they go along with it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Badgerisbest,4,Fri Jul 17 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"Yea like in the 18 minute gameplay when sean was talking about the game a bit and mentioned the economy he would have went on but the IGN guy quickly jumped in and said ""yea we'll talk more about the economy later on"" ffs"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,grgisme,2,Fri Jul 17 16:37:36 2015 UTC,I would actually like some planets to be completely totally barren. But maybe... they have good resources and other goodies hidden away for mining. And maybe a few very rare rare creatures or monsters that make it not 100% barren but almost 99% barren.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,basedonnothing,2,Fri Jul 17 20:34:38 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. And they've basically said something along these lines -- that barren planets will have other aspects that make them interesting to visit still.  I'm still hoping these original statements hold true, but I'll honestly love the game regardless."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,ChummyDuchess,3,Fri Jul 17 17:05:03 2015 UTC,There is an ice world shown in one of the old trailers.

But im not dissapointed, The genrated names were Nice, The planets were beautiful, a good short video! :) expecting a release date soon"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Linkdead404,14,Fri Jul 17 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"This video almost seemed like they hastily threw it together this morning lol. So short and shallow. At least the planets are cool. Unless I'm wrong every one they've visited so far has grass though, a little strange."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,sinces,7,Fri Jul 17 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Scrubby brush is about the most basic of plant life you can get.  It wouldn't surprise me if that's a fairly common thing on habitable worlds in real life, too. :)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Linkdead404,4,Fri Jul 17 16:10:47 2015 UTC,The most basic is probably more likely some form of algae or ferns. Shrubs and grass took years of evolution to become what they are.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,KPipes,3,Sat Jul 18 01:04:06 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about actual plant life, not protolife, or whatever you want to call it.  I have a feeling ferns aren't less advanced than grasses are.  Also, aren't ferns considered trees?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,niccoli,5,Sat Jul 18 01:10:18 2015 UTC,At least it isn't floating

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Kelvets,13,Fri Jul 17 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"Why are they only ever showing planets with lots of life? Even that ""biologically barren"" planet had a couple of large animals."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,grgisme,12,Fri Jul 17 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"They claim they are 5 ""completely random"" planets, but there is no way all 5 planets would have lush life like that when Sean has declared 90% of planets are barren and 9% have really boring (probably only plant) life. It would be too statistically unlikely. So either IGN is using the modified build Sean made for presentations (where every planet has life) or they are flat-out lying about the ""completely random"" thing, or Sean's definition of ""barren"" is not what you'd expect."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,kotor610,7,Fri Jul 17 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"It was probably more like, ""We randomly visited 30 and then chose 5 out of those 30."""

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,DurMan667,3,Fri Jul 17 17:37:03 2015 UTC,Completely random = the didn't know what they were until they went there. And then they chose their favorite ones. blah
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,IndorilMiara,10,Fri Jul 17 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"Because the majority of people wouldn't find a dead rock in space very interesting. We certainly would, but we're not the ones who need swaying.  Many of us believe that they inflated the number of planets with life to 100% for the E3 build in order to allow members of the press to easily find a new planet with life on it so they had something cool to report on."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,DurMan667,2,Fri Jul 17 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"I just wish we could get 1 good, in depth look at a more common planet, once. I don't think I've seen that yet, in all this time."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,IndorilMiara,9,Fri Jul 17 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna guess that most planets will be more like THIS, so we kinda have."

Looks a bit like how I imagine Mars, perhaps with a thicker atmosphere. Edit: Although it does still have plant life :p I just noticed the grass. But seriously, thanks."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Nomanski,4,Fri Jul 17 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"No problem! I just rewatched that last night so it was fresh in my mind.  And yes, there is life, but only a little grass and a few trees here and there."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,simonk83,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Although it does still have plant life    Not  sure  whether  something like this   counts as  the  ""9  out  10   planets that  'don't have life' "",   or   the  ""planets that have some  life  but  aren't  'lush garden planets'.""  HG   are  explicitly  going  for the  ""Golden Age of  science  fiction""  feel  rather than  strict  scientific  accuracy, so  we'll  probably have  to  wait and  see  when the game  comes out  ..."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,vicious796,3,Sat Jul 18 01:51:48 2015 UTC,Videos like this really highlight how lacklustre the IGN coverage is to be honest.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,IndorilMiara,3,Sat Jul 18 00:03:56 2015 UTC,"Because, to the average person, rocks piled on rocks spread out across rocks doesn't really sell a game nor does it generate hits. If your intention is to display all of the things that can be discovered - you show all of the things that can be discovered. If an average, passive gamer saw this as their first glimpse into NMS and saw 4 planets that were just different colors with different geometric shapes of rocks, they're likely to be turned off and never think of it again - even if that 1 remaining planet had all of the goodies in the bag."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,vicious796,5,Fri Jul 17 17:25:19 2015 UTC,"That's fair, except that they weren't showing only a single planet. They could've shown 5 with life and 1 without and I'd be happy. Instead, I fear that by only showing relatively earth-like planets from, presumably, the more normal parts of the galaxy,  that they'll cause people on the fence to think the game lacks variety.  The 5 places they chose look just as likely to be 5 different places on a single earth-like world (earth is pretty diverse, after all) as being 5 seperate planets. Like yes they all look very different, but they don't look particularly alien, either from each other or from real life, and I'm worried that may scare some poeple away."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,IndorilMiara,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"It runs me back to a joke by a comedian named Brian Regan where he jokes about the ""hooked on phonics"" girl and how she's not applying the lessons of phonics in her speech. While it's funniest to hear him do the entire sentence in an exaggerated phonetic way, imagine if it was just one word. Isn't that weird?   Don't misunderstand me - I wish they would show some barren worlds. I wish they would show some gas giants that we can't even walk on. I wish they would show boring old asteroid belts or ring systems. That said, I'm already a mark. I already know that at least some of these things exist through ""ye olde"" text articles and interviews. It's just not sexy.   If you're utilizing a video to show a newcomer that you will discover planets, plants, animals, and minerals you do all you can to beat that over their heads. It's like spending 43 seconds of your 45 second commercial to talk about the benefits of the drug you're selling and then dedicating the last 2 seconds to telling people that they need to talk to their doctor and it may cause 35 other problems. Only difference, of course, is that we're not getting any disclaimer about the barren planets."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,vicious796,3,Fri Jul 17 17:49:11 2015 UTC,"Only difference, of course, is that we're not getting any disclaimer about the barren planets.   That just seems downright misleading then. I'm overall rather troubled by the media focus on the garden worlds. They're gorgeous and intricate and there's more going on, but by only showing them, I can't help that the target of all these videos - people who either haven't heard of the game or are on the fence - will think the universe actually has much less diversity than it does."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,IndorilMiara,3,Fri Jul 17 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"That is a very interesting take - and one I don't often see floating around here. A ""more is less"" viewpoint, almost. I suppose time will tell, of course. Perhaps if they focus more on the fine details next week - like how the economy REALLY works or how upgrading things work - we'll get to see a barren moon that's high on x mineral needed to upgrade a ship."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,blueExcess,3,Fri Jul 17 18:11:40 2015 UTC,That would be nice. I'm excited to see more.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,devinup,2,Fri Jul 17 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there won't be any gas giants in the game :(. I agree with your point though. Of course, would you really expect any different from IGN? Whenever they get hold of a controller and play NMS, they lose all imagination and walk in tiny circles. Their interviews are about as inventive as these videos, so I don't know why we all keep hoping for something different from them."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,seladore,2,Fri Jul 17 19:28:27 2015 UTC,Yeah. I find that a little troublesome.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,ChangloriousBastard,6,Fri Jul 17 16:17:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's strange. Official word is that 1% of planets have 'complex life'... but almost every single planet we've seen so far (even the new 'randomly selected' ones) have complex life.  Even the planet described as 'barren' had plants and animals..."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,nomansblade,3,Fri Jul 17 16:39:42 2015 UTC,"Just to nitpick on that point -- as far as I can tell, that ""official word"" about 1% of worlds containing complex life is only referenced one time: the article in The Verge. Moreover, that ""official world"" isn't even a direct quote from the developers.  People treat it like it's dogma, but I'm feeling more and more that it may not necessarily be representative of the truth. If Sean or Hello Games said ""10%.... Of those 10%...."", I'd be a little more convinced, but right now everyone is basing their idea on the likelihood of life on a one-off, non-direct quote from a piece that really wasn't as in depth as a lot of other articles.  I think a lot of people are going to be upset if the game releases and life is a lot more common than they expected, simply because some Verge writer misunderstood a concept."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Hofood,2,Sat Jul 18 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"I suppose they're more interesting? I can't remember a planet being shown thus far that is completely barren, maybe the 10% rule no longer holds true."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,sciencebasedlife,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:43 2015 UTC,What about the ice planet they showed in earlier trailers? I don't remember seeing any life on those
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,grgisme,4,Fri Jul 17 16:34:15 2015 UTC,Probably because the barren planets have some extra stuff that they don't want to spoil.. All of the playthroughs have been very much worlds on the edge/normal atmospheres etc...

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,nariata_skye,8,Fri Jul 17 16:03:51 2015 UTC,Now I wait patiently for the source links...

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,pittyh,8,Fri Jul 17 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out the comment they made about the atmosphere of the planet being affected by the proximity to the star. For whatever reason I never considered that this was something they would include but it makes perfect sense.   Also it brings up the question, when you go to a new system, are you most likely to find barren planets with rare minerals and such on the outskirts? And are the few planets teeming with life going to be closer to their star like the earth? So interesting!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Kelvets,3,Fri Jul 17 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"It was confirmed ages ago but mostly forgotten. I imaginr it would be like real life, inner planets will be really hot and volcanic, you'll then get the ""goldilocks zone"" for habitable planets like earth and then you'll get the outer planets being all frozen and stuff."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,fisherjoe,3,Fri Jul 17 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"I think there's just so much to this game, and so much hype and everything else, I keep learning things and forgetting them and then learning more things and the hype just never ends! Every little tidbit excites me even more. Like I knew animals would attack you, but to have them actively hunt you? Just waiting to be stalked across a planet by a rabid pack of space goats 0.0"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Camtreez,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"One thing they haven't really given us any information on at all is the solar systems. They'll all have a space station that can vary in size, shape, etc., and all solar systems have planets. That's pretty much it. I've wanted to get a good look at an entire system for a long time now."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Robertossj4,3,Fri Jul 17 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"Old news, just like this month long IGN is getting old really fast."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Robertossj4,3,Fri Jul 17 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"Yea, apparently vast plant life is barren."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,grgisme,2,Fri Jul 17 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"""Man if it weren't for the animals and insects, the rainforest would be so barren."".   That's the same mentality they applied to that planet.   And it's wrong. I'm looking forward to actual desolate desert planets. Hopefully there are some planets or moons that are like our moon, aka without an atmosphere and completely devoid of life."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,DJSkrillex,6,Sat Jul 18 07:33:14 2015 UTC,"Oh man, now the big question: Is IGN making this footage or  Hello Games? Because if it's IGN, we could be playing this game sooner then we expect."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,vicious796,6,Fri Jul 17 16:04:54 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's IGN
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,mogi67,8,Fri Jul 17 16:08:49 2015 UTC,Imagine if the last video of the First's Series is the game review. That would be too much for me
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Sinjobean,5,Fri Jul 17 16:11:31 2015 UTC,That would be awesome... but I'm thinking the odds of that are about as likely as Sean popping into the subreddit himself to give us the world premiere news of the release date.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,_therealchin,4,Fri Jul 17 16:29:17 2015 UTC,I think HG will become more active on this subreddit after they release the game.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,EEKman,3,Fri Jul 17 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"In quite a few videos that show the team as they're working, at least one of them has had this subreddit up on their second monitor."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,MHasho,2,Fri Jul 17 17:26:50 2015 UTC,My guess is that IGN was able to demo the game when they were with HG & that's where the footage is from. I can't imagine them having a copy of the game lying around that they can just play with
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,ShiraCheshire,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:11 2015 UTC,I bet Sony is handing them out.

That you have to dig your way into the caves is such a cool idea! Maybe you'll be able to upgrade your scanner to detect underground cave systems. I'm just really excited about the terrain deformation in general.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Linkdead404,4,Fri Jul 17 16:19:07 2015 UTC,I cannot wait for them to announce the release date here in the next 2 weeks.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,charliebucket-,3,Fri Jul 17 16:08:02 2015 UTC,Among a thread full of negativity and nay sayers it's nice to see someone be positive. This game is gonna rock.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,poriand,3,Fri Jul 17 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"This is also not random barren planets. The seed ratio and all have been tweeked to their liking, I still want to see barren planets and maybe a bit of mining. The coverage sucks so far :( The first day 18 min video was the highlight so far."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Treekent,3,Fri Jul 17 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the ""barren"" thing was IGN's words and not Sean's. There are a ton of videos out there of planets with rocky surfaces and not much life on them. Wouldn't worry too much of there not being anything more barren than what you see in this video."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,poriand,3,Fri Jul 17 16:51:24 2015 UTC,Do you people not remember Soleth Prime? Barren as fuck...except for some buildings. Biologically barren as fuck.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,EternalCanadian,3,Fri Jul 17 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"A part of me is thinking, 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets and you can only show a brief part of 5 but the other (more stronger) part of me is thinking how much fun it is going to be exploring planets like that and discovering things for myself.  As others have said the IGN first is aimed at new people so for them I think it has been perfect so far. Also I believe that we will be playing this game in a couple of months if not weeks so the wait is almost over. Lastly look at how much info we have been given since E3 compared to little was given the 6 months before that, it's great we are getting all this now and I think that's another pointer to a quick release."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,handstobattlestation,4,Fri Jul 17 20:20:15 2015 UTC,"Guys, don't forget that the videos are made to attract new players. They aren't made for us."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,DiggityScrolls,6,Fri Jul 17 16:48:24 2015 UTC,Kinda disappointing how short it was.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,KPipes,2,Fri Jul 17 16:27:58 2015 UTC,Agreed.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,cherbert,3,Fri Jul 17 16:36:05 2015 UTC,They could have spent a bit more time with anything.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,nonsensykal,5,Fri Jul 17 16:20:11 2015 UTC,I think spelunking could be the most exciting part of the game for me.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,grgisme,2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:23 2015 UTC,That last planet though. Must. Find. It.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,CleverZerg,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:05 2015 UTC,On that last planet is that the first time we have seen a Sun?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,sexagonpumptangle,2,Fri Jul 17 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"It's also very interesting that they're being very specific about giving us a tour of a few named planets. Does that mean when the game releases, they will be there, somewhere out there, for us to explore? Does that mean the game is near-complete? Pure speculation, of course."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,legful,3,Fri Jul 17 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"My theory is the ""seed"" of the universe has been final since before E3. At least Sean's comment that ""someday one of you might run across planet E3"" made it seem like that."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,d_snizzy,2,Fri Jul 17 16:43:35 2015 UTC,The yellow trees on the first planet... No Man's Woolly World?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Theroonco,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:42 2015 UTC,A 2 min video? They are milking this badly.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,catteni,2,Fri Jul 17 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, this IGN First thing is really struggling now. This was an incredibly half-hearted attempt to keep showing something new about the game. 5 ""new"" planets, a couple of which we've already seen."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,nickcantwaite,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"The narrator says that habik-ogan is biologically barren planet... I think you cant say that when there are trees and grass everywhere. I'm a bit worried there wont be enough ""dead"" planets. Though they still might have just selected ""rich"" planets on purpose. But then they are not really randomly selected as I recall the narrator stated."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,Dizman7,2,Fri Jul 17 21:06:55 2015 UTC,Anyone have any comments or thoughts on the fact that each time it's posted it seems to be pushed off to the side as a footnote on the main page. Like I think the first week of info was usually on their main header and it's slowly been pushed back.  I could be wrong and maybe it's initially being posted on the header and when I check the website it's a little later in the day
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmxl4,extreme_fluffiness,2,Fri Jul 17 23:37:55 2015 UTC,That. Was. Incredible.  It's nice having so much variety packed in such a short space of time to really emphasise how big the game is!

This coupled with the fact that our first 'ship' will just be a cockpit/lifepod, a good assumption is that we'll 'materialize/start' in orbit around a planet, or in a system near a space station, or possibly at a space station.. but I would assume somewhere in a system, nearish a planet."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqef2,J_a_y_c_e,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:08:48 2015 UTC,I believe we start on a planet with a lifepod / basic ship but no hyperdrive. We then have to find  way of earning money to buy a ship / hyperdrive so we can leave our solar system. We will have a number of planest at our disposal in our starting solar system to achieve this.

These are the 49 European countries imagined as if they were landscapes in No Man's Sky. I made several improvements in comparison to the USA one, for example I made the texts smaller and made the planets in the sky look more realistic.   The name of the 'planet' is either an ancient form of the country's name, or some random letters mixed with the country's current name. The discoverer is either the founder of the country or if there wasn't really a founder, it's the current president/king/whatever. (I apologize in advance if I fucked anything sensitive up)   I hope you guys will enjoy this as much as the USA one, and if you have any suggestions/criticism: please say so!

The game deletes it all from memory and re-builds it later.  Not only that but if whilst you are there you don't cause something significant(Kill things,mine etc) then the planet will reset back to its base as if it was the first time you were there.  Sure there might be small differences but for the life on the planet it would be their first day again.  This isn't a simulation of life, its a simulation of a brief period of life until you leave."

If you go away and come back things wont have reset. The planets will have moved in their orbits, planetary rotation will have continued so the spot where you last landed will face a different direction, animals will have proceeded on in their life cycles, etc. Even things that you have changed will still be changed for you, since your changes are saved locally for you."

To this Bohr replied that however hard he (Einstein) may try, he would not be able to prove that it does, thus giving the entire riddle the status of a kind of an infallible conjectureâone that cannot be either proved or disproved."""

I'd be curious to hear some answers to this question as well.  Perhaps when we launched New Horizons into space, given its velocity we knew it had a certain probability of being at X place at Y time. Does the universe need to render the entire journey of New Horizons when no one is watching it, or can it simply resolve a probability of a previously known state upon observation?  For example, in NMS, say you shot a probe into space from one side of the galaxy to another. You then teleport to the other side of the galaxy where you expect to find the probe arriving, and after a while it appears there. The system could simply be aware of the trajectory of the probe, and the speed at which its travelling to render the probe where you are at the correct time without it having to physically render it travelling the entirety of the galaxy when no one is looking at it.

LOVE your enthusiasm for where this type of simulation can lead, but I fear it really is hyperbolic. Don't get why it's a philosophical experiment.  The game answers nothing about the universe we didn't already know. All the scientific principles the game uses are already known.  The game is only as clever as the people who programmed it, and I doubt they have the answer to life, the universe and everything.  The people who programmed it needed to understand real world problems to achieve an artistic direction.  No theoretical physicist needs this game, or something like it, to understand the universe better. More and many complicated simulations have been ran to help prove the existence of virtual particles inside an atom, for example  Recommend Lawrence Krauss' How to Get Something From Nothing lecture.  edit1: You're not crazy, just maybe thinking about it wrong. Our world influences NMS, not the other way round."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpmb2,SwebForm,2,Sat Jul 18 09:16:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but no, NMS is more of a metaphor for a universe than a simulation of one.  We can build model of the universe, but the more realistic we want to make them, the harder it is. how do you simulate life, build brains? molecules? atoms? quarks? We don't even know how the universe works at a subatomic level to simulate it properly.  If you're interested in simulated life though, check out Grandroids by Steve Grand.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpmb2,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:11:47 2015 UTC,"It's also not entirely based on real-world physics or scales. Planets are generally closer in NMS than in real life. I don't think they have full Newtonian physics either, and even if they did, that wouldn't really be all of what describes reality. No one actually fully understands how reality works in the real world, so it's not possible to fully simulate it. You can't simulate something that you don't fully understand."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpmb2,CurseHawking,2,Sat Jul 18 06:13:21 2015 UTC,"So let me ask the question slightly differently:  Knowing what we know about the model of physics at all levels but especially at the Newtonian and Einsteinian level specifically. Given the power of computers today, not necessarily commercially available ones.   Do you think it would be at least theoretically possible to build even a realistic universal simulator (or whatever smaller segment) using procedural generation?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpmb2,CurseHawking,2,Sat Jul 18 07:17:40 2015 UTC,"I'm no physicist or computer scientist, so what i know could be years out of date. However, from what i understand, a real-time physics simulation isn't really possible, even if it's just the known stuff. Usually certain areas of physics or real-world behaviors are modeled individually for study and even then, it's usually not in real-time for complex systems. I've never heard of any kind of software simulating all known areas of physics together in real-time. Most of the physics engines you'll hear about in video games are all rough approximations of what's known, but none are actually even remotely accurate in astronomical scales.  Physicists still haven't fully understood why galaxies are even able to hold themselves together. They fill in the blanks with ""dark matter"". Without dark matter existing, you can't explain how galaxies can actually exist, so a universal model without understanding dark matter just wouldn't work properly. It may hold itself together if you placed all bodies in some orbit that worked, but eventually it would all fall apart without accounting for the gravity from dark matter."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpmb2,japascoe,2,Sat Jul 18 07:39:56 2015 UTC,"To give an example from one of my colleagues at my university: If you have a plate of composite material with a crack in it, and the crack grows it will send out a sound-wave. These sound-waves are far to high frequency to hear (think 100-500 kHz), but we can pick them up with microphones placed on the structure. People are hoping that in the future you can use this to map out where a crack is by placing microphones in appropriate spots. However to do this you need to understand how these sound-waves will propagate through the structure: how will their frequency and amplitude change. Currently they are working on modelling the propagation of the sound waves through a 60cmx60cmx1.2mm flat plate, so a pretty simple structure. Even modelling just a few seconds of wave propagation takes 60 hours to run on a powerful PC.  I suppose it all depends on what you mean by realistic. I mean physicists can build simulators that will create the same types of structures we see in the sky, but the more detail you want, the harder it gets."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpmb2,CurseHawking,3,Sat Jul 18 07:58:01 2015 UTC,"That's a good example.  Another issue with simulating things in real time accurately, would be the limitations of modern computer hardware. Things like gravity work at the speed of light, but no modern computer can process information at that speed, so a true 1:1 simulation of gravity wouldn't be possible.  I think all simulations are basically an approximation because of these limitations. Maybe quantum computing will change all of this and allow for hugely improved simulations."

I think what is interesting about No Man's Sky is that it shows just how easy it is to create seemingly impossibly diverse and complicated systems from even the simplest of algorithms; something along the same lines as Conway's game of life, albeit on a much grander and understandable scale.   There are also analogies to be made between results in real life physics and algorithmically generated worlds: systems only seem to collapse into a single observable result when we check; causally isolated regions can't be said to exist simultaneously in any meaningful way; limitations on observation stop us from seeing the world past certain scales."

But as I first watched the GameInformer feature about the tech behind NMS I thought of Kantian metaphysics. It'd be a funny thing thinking about the math behind the generation of the universe as something like the thing-in-itself, the indivdual players as the subjects and the universe being generated for each player as he perceives as the empirical reality.   Exaggerating this analogy would probably be silly, as there're many details in Kants thoughts that don't fit in how No Man's Sky works and the other way around, but it makes up for some nice showerthoughts."

The Simulation Argument.  http://www.simulation-argument.com/    In a nutshell:    At least one of the following propositions is true:     (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a âposthumanâ stage     (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof)     (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation right now. It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation.     This is not mere philosophy - there are tests to determine if it is true, and, more importantly, if it is false. So far, several tests point true. Tests that would have shown false, failed.     It may well be that No Man's Sky is a stepping stone within the history simulation we live in that leads to the methodology of our own simulation.

When Widget shows don't click it! Long press on it, choose resize and fill whole homescreen with it. Now press back button to exit resizing and click widget once. Zooper Widget will open, choose SD Card and search for nms. Go to Layout, search for 'Text, L  U  C  A  S"", 'Edit text manually', change it to your name or anything you like (remember two spaces between letters, it looks better).  If you use different Apps than me for Phone, SMS etc. you have to change Hotspots. Go back to Layout. Last 5 'Rect' are the ones you are looking for. Counting from end: 1st is App Drawer (those 2 circles), 2nd it Mail, 3rd is Messenger, 4th is SMS and 5th is Phone.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dnl0f,DJSkrillex,3,Sat Jul 18 07:38:10 2015 UTC,"Here's an example. Let's say you want mail icon. You go to Layout and create new Text or Rich Text. Change font to Android L Icons 2 (that's one which looks like set of Icons when you choose it). Edit text manually and write 'c' (case sensitive). In this font 'c' is mail icon, but if you want anything else easiest way is to write whole alphabet lowercase and uppercase and numbers and then search through it."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dnl0f,thehaunsolo,5,Fri Jul 17 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"Ok. Lockscreen, a bit more complecated IMO. First of all go to http://widgetlocker.teslacoilsw.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Invisible-Tabs.wltheme.zip, open it with Widget Locker and choose 'Install only', then unpack all files so you have a folder (all on phone, if you need App that can do it use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx&hl=pl for example). Than launch Widget Locker and clear the screen. In top-right corner there is a small white button, that's settings, open it. Go to Look & Feel/Layout and resize by pulling those 2 arrows so those rectangles take whole screen, then uncheck Automatically determine grid size and change it to 6 rows x 5 columns, press save. Go to Look & Feel/Background Tint and set it to whatever you like (I use 3). Go to Advanced and 'Enable' Widget Overlap.  Go back so you see Wallpaper and white settings button again. Hold long anywhere, choose Widget -> Zooper Widget 5x1 resize it to full screen again, press back button (it hides, swipe a bit from bottom), click on widget now, choose sdcard, nms lock, go back. Lockscreen should look right now, but we are missing slider for unlock. Resize Zooper Widget from top a bit and move it to top of the screen. Long press under Zooper Widget and choose Add Slider (or something like this, I don't remember). Save it in top left corner. Reposition it to bottom of the screen then long press on it and choose edit. Pick Invisible Tabs from first menu. Now slide the unlock button, go to Icon, choose Files and find the unpacked folder, in it search for android-left-normal and use it. Press the middle button and choose disable, slide right button and choose disable. Confirm in top left corner. Resize Zooper Widget to full screen. Everything should be done now ;)"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpuz6,knobudee,2,Sat Jul 18 10:12:14 2015 UTC,"I really feel it will. They don't want to compete with Q4 sales and they are generating a lot of noise about the game right now. Being that they are a small developer I could see them just dropping it in August (probably more towards the end of August).   It wouldn't be a bad idea. Generate a ton of hype. Give it a month for people to have that set in and want the game. (Even though many of us here have been keeping tabs on it for awhile). Then drop it.   In my experience with the gaming industry AAA is for Q4, but this game is getting enough noise right now I could see it coming out at the beginning of September to separate it enough from the big titles but have its own big release.   I'm not sure what it would be competing against the next couple months otherwise I'd probably be able to make a better guess."

It's procedurally generated, not randomly generated. It does not have ""joinable lobbies similar to Destiny."" NMS's multiplayer will be reminiscent of Journey's.  I advise you to look over the multiplayer section of the Information Archive. And read this article."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dsjd7,Pestilence11,4,Sun Jul 19 03:57:21 2015 UTC,Well procedurally generated means it has rules. Random means pretty much anything goes.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dsjd7,klovasos,-2,Sun Jul 19 09:08:09 2015 UTC,"You will be able to see other players, but can only see a few at the same time. So if loads of people gathered in the same place, they wouldn't all see each other.   It mentions it right there in the Information Archive you linked. Can you not read? It will have lobby-less drop-in / drop-out multiplayer with a limited but unknown number of slots exactly like Destiny.  Also, you are being a bit harsh to criticise what is a quite well made and positive video about No Man's Sky for one unimportant technical inaccuracy that most viewers won't care to know the difference over.  If I was to say No Man's Sky was randomly generated that would not be 100% incorrect as your post suggests. Sure, it is better to use the preferred terminology, but what does that mean to the average dude? Computers are incapable of true RNG without specialised peripherals attached to them. All that can be done is to use an optionally randomised seed in a function that produces another seemingly unrelated number when given the previous number it produced. The seed could be the system time, or Paris Hilton's twitter feed, but if the same seed from one run of the program to the next then the sequence of numbers produced by this so called 'random number generator' will be an entirely predictable sequence that is the same as before. So, in essence No Man's Sky is an unrandomised RNG that is deterministically consistent.  Obviously, this underlying noise function is transmuted through the rules of celestial mechanics and used to govern the distribution of natural resources, where flora grow as a result and where fauna feed on that flora in herds that evade predators, etc. All of that, including the interplanetary trading system and faction wars is part of a stateful simulation that is overlaid on the functional taleidoscope of each terrain.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOmLWLu9Ac  tl; dr No Man's Sky is ""randomly generated"" insofar as this can only be done via procedural generation!"

But the average gamer/consumer is now going to hear that comparison and then immediately think they will basically be playing with all their friends in NMS the same way they do destiny. The video was only 2 min long, he could have taken an extra 10 sec to explain you probably won't see your friends to late game at the earliest."

The main issue i have with your statement in the video is the ambiguity of it. yes it DOES have join able lobbies like destiny's area maps. NO It DOES NOT have join able lobbies like destiny's raid/party functions."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dsjd7,klovasos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:48:18 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should have rephrased that, I'll admit. What I meant by that was that even though you're not necessarily in a party with the players around you, each area you are in functions as a ""lobby"" of sorts. If you're familiar with Destiny, when you enter an area there's a list of players in the same area as you and everyone can leave and join as they wish, though they're all still listed in the area of the map as one ""lobby"". It's harder to explain through keyboard for me, personally so I'm just going to hope that makes sense. And yes, I do admit I should have phrased that portion a bit more clearly :b"

Re-seeding the entire game with a new 64-bit integer and spawning a new galaxy is not that amazing and not at all meaningful.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,TemptedDreamer,2,Sat Jul 18 19:17:37 2015 UTC,There's already a persistant auto save feature.   The beacons are more for sharing with the larger community what you've discovered
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,ItsMeiri,2,Sat Jul 18 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"Also for getting some units, I think."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,TemptedDreamer,2,Sat Jul 18 16:58:05 2015 UTC,Yep that too. You get money for discoveries
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,lwg21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:38:55 2015 UTC,"Does someone have a source about the auto-save feature?   I was under the impression that beacons sync your discoveries with the server. Since you lose any discovery you didn't upload when you die, the OP's theory about beacons acting as save spots may work. But I might have missed something.  For the rest, yes, you will see players in real time, but this seems to be so rare that no, it's not really a community effort. I don't know about ways to communicate with other players, or if that will even be possible."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,TemptedDreamer,3,Sat Jul 18 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"In the information archive it references it with the article.   No saved games. The game will be saved all the time as you go along, but you canât save and load games. If you die, then you will have to rebuild from where you are in the universe. Youâll never have to go back to the start and try again Rock, Paper, Shotgun  It's near the bottom of the article a few paragraphs above the crashed ship."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,lwg21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks! So respawn will probably occur on/in the planet/station/system where you died, with empty inventory, lost latest discoveries and possibly the basic lifepod if your ship was destroyed. Does that sound right?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"Well. Yes.   Actually if you're outside the ship as Sean demonstrated in the 18 min vid you'll respawn right next to your ship. Like you said you lose all your discoveries, inventory items.   If you're in your ship they haven't specified where exactly you respawn (such as if you're closer to the station than a planet or if there's an asteroid field only system) but if you destroy your ship in space or above the planet's surface you eject out of your ship in the lifepod and fly to the nearest planet. I'm thinking if you have unsaved  ship based discoveries you'll lose those along with your ship cargo."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,lwg21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, thank you. I look forward to ejecting in the lifepod after a lost battle, being stranded on an unknown, hostile planet and having to find a new ship."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,DawnBlue,2,Sat Jul 18 21:56:08 2015 UTC,Maybe not a community effort in game. But information about the main goal (getting to the center of the universe) will grow in wikis and forums.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dqvgh,NekoMadeOfWaifus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats what I was thinking. Beacons should synchronize data with the main server. Uploading your discoveries, as well downloading the discoveries of the rest of the community in your own state of the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm9a0,KubeQ11,20,Fri Jul 17 12:27:26 2015 UTC,Lmao...that was hilarious.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm9a0,Linkdead404,11,Fri Jul 17 12:35:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I like the guy.   And he's right, procedural generation so far hasn't been exactly stellar in creating cool things to look at. It needs the right combination of randomness and design, and especially, it needs asymmetrical distribution of it's assets- meaning rare shit to find, because our brains are made to correlate and figure out patterns so once we've seen 3 goats, we've seen all of them."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm9a0,SpaceShipRat,10,Fri Jul 17 14:24:08 2015 UTC,Minecraft has excellent procedural generation.  I love just walking and seeing the landscapes change.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm9a0,Seeders,2,Fri Jul 17 15:44:17 2015 UTC,"Grant talked about asymmetrical distribution of assets in the GDC talk.  It was pretty spiffy.  Also, the big thing that bugs me when youtube celebs talk about the game is that none of them catch on the big thing Sean talks about over and over...that all he's showing us is outer rim worlds, and that things get stranger and more alien the closer we get to the center of the galaxy."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm9a0,Linkdead404,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"So far we have HG, or specifically Sean, saying that as they began laying down the rules of their universe that this system of chaos came from the ordered maths running behind the scenes.  It is this that has me hopeful NMS will have the proper variety to keep the game visually interesting.  Now the other side of this is how interesting each section of the galaxy be as while we move, or if we move, closer to the center.  What I mean is how is the pacing of progression (or whatever progression there is or can be in NMS).  Will I spend days upon days in the ""outer rim"" where things don't look too strange or alien.  Or will there be a pace that can show a shift change from familiar/normal to the strange/alien?  To me, I believe the pacing of the game elements is what will shut the naysayers up and will keep everyone playing for a long, long time."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm9a0,pykaswitz,3,Fri Jul 17 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"When you're new to the game, everything will be a discovery, even the gazelles, so spending a while on the outer rim shouldn't feel like a chore. (and it's our fault if we obsessively look at trailers and spoilers, it will be new to most players)"

I've given out one gilding, for which I got a trophy (the only one I have for something other than showing up...) and covered a little under 4 hours of server time.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dp3wg,1984tpearson,2,Sat Jul 18 02:53:40 2015 UTC,There are these things from the IGN 18 mins gameplay video @00:43. They look really cool and the obvious jokes have been made but I think they are just decorative like the ruins and they are a pair like the others. I can't think of anything from the entirety of the footage but he mentions finding new tech by investigating jettisoned cargo pods and other unusual sites in the new video. It's entirely possible that these could be destroyed which yields upgrades/tech as /u/TemptedDreamer suggested. The blue boobies -dammit! Couldn't resist! ...look like technology so it makes since they yield tech if they can be destroyed.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Gankstar,17,Fri Jul 17 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"100% agree with you. It's exactly for this reason that I don't mind reading the posts saying ""My end game goal after hundreds of hours of flying through space is to finally meet up with my best friend in this near infinite universe and finally get to show him some of the planets I've been to and vice versa and discover new ones together after so long of being apart"". That kind of stuff is awesome and beautiful. However, what I can't stand at all is the posts saying ""I can't wait to meet up with my whole crew and form a pirate raid group and kill all the other players we run into and then we'll get together and build a huge city on one planet for us to dock our frigate sized ships."" Those are the posts where I echo the age old ""that's not what this game is about"". I hope you understand."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,klovasos,4,Fri Jul 17 11:08:43 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying, and I actually agree. However as devils advocate, isn't it odd that the game is designed around the idea of doing whatever you want in an entire universe, but when someone says they wanna be pirates and take out freighters with friends you say ""nononono our universe isn't about that"""
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,happybanditman,3,Fri Jul 17 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"Its not that it isn't about that. Its that the statement ""we are all going to group up and form a pirate crew"" when it could literally take hundreds if not thousands of hours to meet up with a single person in that group is simply extremely unlikely to happen and they will be sorely disappointed.  The only way it'll most likely happen is when everyone gets closer to the center, and you may encounter another person from your group, but even then the chances are damn slim, damn slim indeed.  Mainly, its not that you can't do it, or you are encouraged not to do it, its just that suggesting its going to be as simple as ""meeting"" up is like saying you can pick up a grain of sand on the beach, throw it down, come back the next day and think you have a chance at finding it relatively soon. Which I think is beautiful."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Mighty_The_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:51:07 2015 UTC,"They can absolutely be a pirate though. And they could do it with a friend even, IF they manage to meet up with them. But we can't let people get this idea that they are guaranteed to play with their friends, that it will be easy, or that they could possibly spawn in with eachother and start it as a co-op game. None of that will be in the games release and if people are led to believe this even in the slightest (look at these types of threads people are already creating after sean has already given us all this information) then when the game comes out and it's not as easy as they think. They are going to immediately write a 0/10 review and take to their torches and pitchforks boycotting the game online wanting their money back. That's why sean has tried very hard to say ""THIS IS NOT AN MMO"" and people STILL make these types of threads."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,klovasos,3,Sat Jul 18 02:03:31 2015 UTC,"Nice post. Great aspect highlighted!   However, it's not an MMO. The technical systems allowing for massive player congregation just won't be in place."

Lots is hard to pull of. Even if it'd take weeks, the tech systems for a small meet-up are there from what I gather by announcements. Not so for a large meet-up."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,ouTPhaze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:38:36 2015 UTC,Yea I'm aware of that. But it's still an MMO unless MMO can only mean something like WoW or ESO to you. It's just not an MMO in the traditional sense that you can make large groups. But apart from that it isn't very different. Would you not call those games MMOs if you could only ever zone in with 3 or 4 people. Destiny is kind of similar in this regard. And I believe it's still labeled as an MMO?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,sepen_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:21:05 2015 UTC,"MMO is the abbreviation of massively multiplayer online game.  Massive being the feature separating it from other multiplayer games because that's special; or was when the term was brought into existence.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,sepen_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:58:54 2015 UTC,Yes however there are still the same amount of players playing even though they are widely distributed. It's more of a grey area than anything else. There are still a massive amount of players you just might not see any.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Gryphon0468,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:19:01 2015 UTC,"I suppose you can look at it like this.   But myself looking at it from a technical viewpoint: hardly ever meeting players, however many, only require a 'leaderboard'/clients phoning home sometimes, and a very small additional multiplayer component, if one actually runs into a second. The hallmark of an MMO is many, many players dynamically interacting, and a tremendous amount of work and intelligent systems and optimization poured into this feature to make it at all possible. Think lag, and framerates, and clipping/collisions, and everything network."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,sepen_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:02:53 2015 UTC,There will be 1000s of people online playing at the same time in the same Galaxy. I call that an MMO.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Wolverine78,3,Sat Jul 18 14:04:30 2015 UTC,"I love the thought of exploring stuff alone and knowing that out there, other sentient beings are doing similar stuff.

I don't really care about meeting anyone though."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,ouTPhaze,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:55 2015 UTC,"The game universe that Hello Games are creating is like an incredible beautiful creature but if it was strictly offline it would be a beautiful sleeping creature , the fact that we know that there are other human players out there in the same universe brings this great technological invention in the video games world to life. Its a very important game element your pointing out , its one of the most important apsects of the game and yet easily gnored by many on a conscious level."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,ouTPhaze,0,Fri Jul 17 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"And yet you can't actively go out and play with any of them. Doesn't seem to make sense, especially considering the fact that you aren't really even going to feel ""alone and isolated"" with the millions and billions of different NPC's with factions, alliances, wars, space ports, trade routes, etc. going on... Even more reason for this game to allow at least 2 people to meet up and play together, if not a few more."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,sepen_,2,Fri Jul 17 15:54:43 2015 UTC,I think that's what makes this game so unique. You both can and can't at the same time. Nobody is stopping you except yourself. You have the option to do it if you desire but nobody is going to hold your hand and place you with that person you want to play with. I totally understand how it's a shame in a way. But I support that decision because I feel it's a crucial element to the spirit of the game. The universe wouldn't feel so big if all it takes is a short loading screen to find your friends. And this would distract from the experience the developers want us to have
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,pwasma_dwagon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you don't even have the option to do it if you have to spend weeks hunting down a friend.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Nazryl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:18:01 2015 UTC,Haha yea I tried making them but when I submitted they were always removed? And yes you're absolutely right about that. It wasn't so much their opinion that bothered me but the lack of understanding of how much of a positive thing it was. I think they just didn't understand the reasoning behind the decision to include multiplayer. After that if they still don't care for it it doesn't matter really because it's true it's not a multiplayer game in the sense that it's all about a single player experience

I don't care about it being online or there being other people because the experience is about the isolation.'  Whoa! those awful, awful people! how dare they say something so obscenely offensive and derogatory! Thats worthy of some name calling for sure!

Or perhaps even through a radio with the range of a solar system. Would be awesome if you're playing minding your own business when all of sudden you hear a buzz/beep noise which is the hailing of another player.

So technically we will not be alone we just will have a had time finding other living players. The idea of being ""alone"" is interesting and will be an experience, but it would also be an experience to band together with some friends and explore together, fight or become pirates together, trade with each other, etc.  I can see both sides of the coin and honestly I would prefer the give us the option to play how we would like to play. If you want isolation, go do it, if you want to band together you can find each other and do that too....by not giving us the option they are controlling our open world experience.    Let the customer decide...either way I am looking forward to this animal!"

All they have explained about the game is you explore and collect stuff.  I don't claim to know what the game is like but just from what has been shown I hope its not super repetitive.  In my opinion the economy is going to make or break this game because you can find limitless variations of things but who really enjoys finding limitless colors and variations of junk.  A lot of games have this problem.  Something like Diablo 3 has randomly generated maps but collecting stuff is boring cause most of the stuff you get is junk.  They haven't shown anything ""reward like"" aside from exploring.  Finding new shapes and colors is nice but its not going to turn it into an unbelievable game."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,extreme_fluffiness,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:31 2015 UTC,Here is more proof of how unpopular it is now. Go on any game streaming website and you wont find anyone playing it.  Saying millions of people playing it doesn't even come close to the actual number of active accounts.  League of legends has about 1-2 million players actively playing each day and that's the most popular game in the world right now.  So your numbers are cluelessly exaggerated.  If i had to put a number on diablo 3 active players it would be 40-30k
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,ouTPhaze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:53:27 2015 UTC,"Streams don't mean much. LoL is a game with a wildly large streaming community, and they have tens of millions of active accounts. Diablo has never had a big streaming community but still has millions of active accounts.  It's like comparing SC2 players to EVE players. There are more SC2 streamers, but more EVE active players."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,ouTPhaze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"Streams are actually the best way of measuring popularity among games.  There is always going to be situations where some game is played more but not streamed, but in the general the most popular game is going to be streamed more and watched more.  Plus there is a difference between active players and active accounts.  SC2 doesn't require any subscription serves so every account ever made is active much like diablo 3 so even though it sold millions of copies and has millions of account that doesn't mean its played.  While EVE you need a subscription to be active.  Anyway its pretty obvious your not going to get the picture so good luck I'm not responding anymore."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,DurMan667,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:37:43 2015 UTC,"Streams are not the best way to see active players. Seriously. If you think that, then I know some games with hundreds of thousands of concurrent players that almost no on streams that say otherwise. Hell, EVE alone has 60k player online playing at any time, and that is small compared to its millions of active subs, and you don't see streams of it often at all.  Also look at Lineage II, which is still one of the most active mmos of all time and has no subscription. No one streams that, despite the fact they have 100k+ concurrent users online at any given time."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:58:37 2015 UTC,It's funny when people explain things they haven't played yet? Are you saying this entire subreddit and its FAQ are completely absurd? Just because none of us have played the game doesn't mean we don't have a pretty solid understanding of it. Nothing compared to what we will know once it comes out but I think HG has done an excellent job explaining it and I don't see how discussing the knowledge we have about the game is silly just because we haven't played it yet.             Edit: as for the economy making or breaking this game I agree that you've missed what this game is about for most of us. In my opinion the economy might be the least interesting thing. It's cool that's it's implemented and I can see its appeal but I won't be getting this game to determine market values and which resources are the cash cows. I don't imagine it being nearly as complex as a real economy or even similar in any way. It will be there to create the impression of value and maybe there will even be fluctuations in prices depending on supply and demand but beyond that I wouldn't expect much. and if that's what's going to make or break it then be my guest lol
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,handstobattlestation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:12 2015 UTC,"Well I think that's a pretty poor opinion.  This game is going to be all about having an adventure from an exploration perspective, and the economy is a huge factor in exploring. For example travel costs and preparations, plus whatever value your finds are. So make an adventure can have an incredible costly depth rather than just going somewhere and seeing something.  There is great risk and reward to exploration when you have a good economy.  If you have none then there is no risk or reward.  Its basically sightseeing at that point.  Which is fine if that's all you want in this game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Cauner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:15:06 2015 UTC,"Great thought, I totally agree!  Here is another one in terms of ""hope"": Isn't the search for extraterrestrial intelligent life one of the most fundamental endeavors of mankind? I mean, 1/10 planets in NMS will be populated by all kinds of procedurally (but not ""intelligent"") creatures and - since it's gonna be a video game after all - it won't come as a surprise to discover these beings, name them and move on. So far, so good. But NMS offers more than that. It provides us with the ultimate experience: Hopefully finding other intelligent lifeforms somewhere at the center of the galaxy, knowing that the possibility of an encounter increases the closer we get. In the real world, we know about the age and vastness of the universe and somehow we have the feeling that we are not alone. Somehow we don't want to be alone. But we can't prove it - at least not now. However, in NMS, even though we start on an isolated planet without a lot of resources and at the rim of the galaxy, we know ""they"" are out there. And we are going on a long journey, ready to meet them.  (This aspect of ""aliens"" eventually meeting each other also leads me to the idea that the (however bi-pedal) physical appearance of each player might be procedurally generated as well.)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,TheKrak3n,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"Also, there is no ""isolation"" when the universe is filled with millions and billions of procedurally generated NPC's that have factions, alliances, trade routes, space ports, etc."

I don't think there will be a gamer ID floating above them or anything of the sort.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Lazeru42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"You're actually mistaken on part of this: the game is literally not an MMO at all- not just in practice. In fact, the server size is, if I recall correctly,  3-5 players. Meaning, you will only see another player if you're close enough to their position in game for them to spawn into your lobbies. Every player isn't literally in one game like an MMO server. It's more like Dark Souls in this aspect. While everyone plays in their own version of the same universe which updates as everyone discovers and uploads, there aren't literally thousands of players flying around in the same server at any time. Otherwise, interesting ideas, but these are the real reasons Hello Games keeps repeating ""THIS IS NOT AN MMO!"""
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Wulf_Star_Strider,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:03 2015 UTC,Right. I get it. But with the size of the universe it's close enough that it doesn't matter. Since you will most likely never meet more than 2 or 3 players in the same place you could think everybody is on one server and never know any better. You're absolutely correct but I guess my point is that we won't really notice the fact that we are in lobbies. And our discoveries I believe will be uploaded to a main server for everybody to see not just those joining our lobbies right? I don't think its a clear cut as you make it out to be. Perhaps calling it an MMO is wrong. But I'd say it's closer to that than any other type of game genre
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Elfotodiablo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah imagine after youve played the game for months scanning the horizons for people and then there... There is a ship. It's doing barrel rolls! Oh this is what you've been waiting for! Your first human encounter. You approach the ship and it lands. There! A human character exits! Oh thank god Hello Games added voice coms! You que your Mic,   ""Hello fellow explorer!"" the model turns to you. You state at each other akwardly. It's such a sureal moment...   ""420 BLAZE IT!"" the voice screetches out. You are stunned. In a daze. You weakly reply   ""I'm not sure you understand, this is kind of a big deal. We shouldn't have even been able to meet. This game is so lar-"" Then his mic comes up again, cutting you off. He is blasting snoopdog through is mic. The quality is unbearable. He jumps in the air and spins, mid air he fires his multi-tool. You explode and he stands over your body. You hear his shitty mic que up again and he screams   ""360 no scope faggot!"" and that's how I imagine the game would go with voice coms.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Lazeru42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"If asked, I would compare the multiplayer aspect of NMS to Watch_Dogs. Obviously I'm doing so very loosely, but how the singleplayer worked was that other players could randomly, at any time, connect to your game.   You would never know if someone joined your session unless they showed themselves (or started hacking you, which was usually the reason why people joined others games) so it was always a surprise when you did come across them. And while it was technically multiplayer 24-7, it was still a singleplayer experience."

Sean somewhere has stated that this isnt an mmo and certainly not a multiplayer game. will you find people? of course but it would be in the form of an encounter, an instance so to speak. he has described it as a type of feel youd get from the game journey, youd see someone but wouldnt really do much of anything else and after awhile you just fade. its a game meant on exploring alien worlds and discovering secret places and artifacts that only you out of 7 billion have seen.  TL;DR its not a mmo and its not something you should play if your expecting play time with your friends."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Lazeru42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:18:25 2015 UTC,Me and my friends already know the chances of us actually meeting up are slim and we're just meh about it.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,ouTPhaze,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:19:51 2015 UTC,"Ironically I think this game will be more social than we think. Because everyone will have their own experience, people will share and post and chat their journey. Itll be a great game for streamers to build their audience since each one will be different. In game as you browse the galaxy map you will see spokes of discovered stars forming as players move through it. Eventually, a sort of player made map of pathways will form. You may not see a player directly but you will feel their presence."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm0nn,Elfotodiablo,0,Fri Jul 17 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"Then let me tell you, as a guy that has travelled and been a lot of places alone:  It's not about an inability to enjoy your own company and it's not a lack of ability of being introspective about experiences. It's about seeing something special and sharing that experience with someone else. It's about having someone to reminisce with. It's about being the social creatures we humans are.  As I said, I've travelled a lot alone. And while those are great experiences I wouldn't want to be without. My favorite trip so far was when I travelled with my brother last year year. And I'm looking more forward to my trip with my girlfriend later this year.  Being alone, seeing things and new places on your own is great. Doing it with someone else is so much stronger. Then you have someone to share the experience with. And it doesn't prevent you from being introspective. You can still be introspective, on your own, during and after the fact fact. But you also have someone to discuss those thoughts with. Which brings a whole new level to it, because the person you are with has their own thoughts and feelings about the same experience."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpcpk,klovasos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:17:56 2015 UTC,So 1 quintillion is 1 billion of a billion  18 quint = 18 billion billions  that's a shit load of planets so I think there are thousands or not millions of galaxies out there.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dpcpk,Linkdead404,2,Sat Jul 18 04:21:54 2015 UTC,"Top comment got it wrong actually. The milky way is thought to have 200-400 billion stars. So if we go with the largest quantity and say each galaxy in NMS has 400 billions stars and we say each star has around 10 planets (a safe bet I think). Then that means NMS would have 4,611,686 galaxies. Definitely millions."

If you really want to get nit picky like that - 100 billion planets/galaxy = 184,467,440 galaxies - still definitely millions."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,NickJosue,14,Fri Jul 17 05:45:57 2015 UTC,Isn't the whole point of procedural (or one of the main points hello games used it) that you don't need lots of people to work on it?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,Totsandtots,7,Fri Jul 17 04:58:53 2015 UTC,I know but the base creatures and ships and things need to be done by artists and such before randomized
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,Totsandtots,0,Fri Jul 17 05:20:53 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that you look up the actual base models, there is a video with Sean in debug mode.  The models are pretty simple shapes really, and only took a few people to create them.  Also the models are not random, that's not what procedural means.  I'm not trying to be an ass, but i would have to disagree with your line of reasoning in the post.  Adding more people just creates a mess of burocracy,  Sean talks about how his music director often does things without asking, they joke about how they used to have to go to committee for every single decision.  What excites me most about this tech is how this game (I hope) shows programmers/artists that they don't need to be apart of a huge studio to create an epic game in scale, ethos and gameplay."

A task that would take one person 5 seconds doesn't scale well to a thousand people?   To be fair, the correct answer is: ""Parameters undefined. How large a glass of water; where is this water located? What is the gravitational constant of the planet on which this occurs? Is it chemically water, or are there are potentially dangerous agents requiring a step-by-step safety briefing. Does the water need testing? How much observational data is required to confirm the water is, indeed, within the confines of the glass? Does spilt water count?"""

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,shawnaroo,2,Fri Jul 17 09:11:14 2015 UTC,"Unless you actual write code for HG, I don't think you're qualified to make that statement. It's certainly possible, but a common philosophy in coding is trying to keep things divided up and have separate functionalities separate in the code as much as is possible. This can make a lot of things easier, such as reusing code in another project.   It's definitely possible that some parts of the engine are written in a way that would be relatively easy to extract and provide as a base to other developers."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,lethargy86,2,Fri Jul 17 12:31:55 2015 UTC,"I never said they could snap their fingers to make it happen. It wouldn't necessarily be easy, but the valuable stuff in the game, tech-wise, is their engine.  The game elements running on the engine I'm very much looking forward to, but they're definitely recycled from other games. The engine is one-of-a-kind.  Edit: also it's hard to imagine how you could even doubt the plausibility. Let's think for a second.  Half-Life->Source, Unreal Tournament->Unreal Engine, Crysis->CryTek, Battlefield->Frostbyte. It happens all the time when people put huge effort into engines and tools."

I think it would be amazing if they licensed their procedural engine  tech so that it can be generalized and leveraged in other procedural games.   i cant imagine hello games releasing any part of their engine and is the last thing that i want as a gamer, especially knowing how sean murry feels about the topic.  it would go against everything that hello games stands for, and i would consider them total sell outs if they were to whore out their engine to either big or small studios for other projects.  programming is about problem solving, not copying and pasting code."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,shawnaroo,3,Fri Jul 17 08:43:55 2015 UTC,"Programming is about making software that accomplishes your goals. Reusing code is often times a great solution.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,Totsandtots,-1,Fri Jul 17 12:34:37 2015 UTC,"programming is a tool that builds.  obviously we should try to learn from smarter folks.  an original game engine, or video game like no man's sky is a video game, not a tool.  hello games did not set out to make a new tool for other people to use.  the internet is not a video game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,shawnaroo,2,Fri Jul 17 13:05:01 2015 UTC,"Certainly HG's main focus is making a video game, but that doesn't preclude them from having made decisions that will make it feasible to turn the NMS engine into a more general purpose engine that could be used as a foundation for other games. Modular code is a good idea for lots of reasons.   Video games have a lot of their own difficulties and opportunities compared to other types of software development, but in general, good coding practices are fairly universal."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,Totsandtots,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:13:56 2015 UTC,Well Sean was directly asked if he has going to sell any software developed from no mans sky...and he laughed it off and said no.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,lethargy86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"We're talking about after NMS is done. What if they want to make another game with procedural elements? The first step might be to clean up the engine interfaces and put it into its own project, if it isn't already, so necessary parts of the game engine can be reused easily for future projects.  At that point, Hello Games is really sitting on a treasure that could advance the entire industry significantly. Who said they have to be sellouts? They could license it for free, but honestly that would be really silly from a business perspective."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,LeMogwai,-1,Fri Jul 17 08:44:16 2015 UTC,"Now imagine a team with a lot of manpower...which uses just 1000 planets   i can imagine it, and it would be a mess.  working on complex maths with a large group of people is inefficient and for me personally, frustrating.  the number of planets or items or things that you are generating makes no difference to the amount of detail or quality of the said thing being generated.  it is the maths (rules) that you use to guide a given input into a meaningful output, which is key.  if you limit the procedural output to 1000 ""things"" that doesnt mean magically the computer will generate 1000 of what you think are the best ""things"".     hand-crafted detail / story / props / plot / quests / items / structures   to me, hand-crafted procedural generation is a bit of an oxymoron.  could you personally make a series of sounds with musical instruments and send 0-100% of it through some ""maths"" and end up with a radical out put?  sure! hello games and 65 Days of static are doing that very thing.  but any result that comes from that procedural generation wont be ""hand-crafted"" in the traditional artistic sense of what it means to create something."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,Totsandtots,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:46:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Ubisoft or EA will suddenly fire 80% of the team to generate their new games in a procedural manner . So if they decided to use this kind of technology to generate an entire new game, you can be sure that they will be able to achieve spectacular things.  But to be honest, those kind of big company are really resilient to change and you probably never see any big company take those kind of risks."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ue,teganandsararock,2,Fri Jul 17 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"The problem with procedural titles is making them fun to a wide audience. It's very easy to do that with a traditional title, because you have explicit control over everything.  NMS is introducing procedural generation to more than just terrain. Things that would otherwise be explicitly designed - creatures, ships, weapons - are being handed to a bunch of math, which would make almost any artist ridiculously uncomfortable.  NMS is the next step in procedural titles, but it's far from the last. They'll be fairly niche until we work out that ""fun"" problem. I think an ""easy"" solution would be work on AI and synthetic voices so that you could have complex individual NPCs that are almost indistinguishable from hand-crafted ones, but that's a long way off (And maybe Bioware spoiled me with their character development in their RPGs)."

It's not new tech, only new in how it's being used. I really hope other talented devs take notice and create some amazing things.  I just imagine a procedural engine similar to what they've created used for other scenarios - a medieval world where all of the towns, castles, and fantasy creatures are procedural. Imagine Skyrim with a world 1000 times larger and truly 'wild and unknown'.  Or a GTA style game but across a landscape the size of north america? Yes please."

I imagine a lot of AAA companies may have suggested that HellGames approach probably wouldn't induce a lot of hype as it has purely because it's different. I'd say there is a lot more attention towards the fact that such a small team can accomplish something so meaningful to thousands of people globally - both the big players as well as amateur game artists now realising it's possible to do so AND be successful.  Quality over quantity - in every aspect. It will no doubt spawn some great content in the future."

Something to make the game come to life, and that is what NMS appears to be- not just a universe, but a living universe.

The exploding thoughts in my head are too much to write. You made me excited for a potential Pokemon killer which probably won't exist.  Think of it like, you can only have say 10 creatures contained in your ship. If they die during battle that monster is deceased. Gone. Unless you make your way back to its homeworld and hope it wasn't one of a kind (legendary types?!)   But with near infinite monsters out there what's stopping you from going out and finding a new one with new killer strengths or abilities?  The attachment. Much like Ash and Pikachu, they've always been together. But during Pokemon games you usually just get the best ones and poof you're golden. In this game you'll have a monster you'll love simply cause it looks awesome or has an OP move but will you let it free or potentially kill it to progress deeper into the unknown to become the universe's ultimate monster tamer? Or something, I'm just spewing thoughts at this point.  A universe of monsters able to be caught and unleashed upon in space arenas, each with a ""leader"" and whoever else is there duking it out in their own private rooms.  Able to trade monsters with others..  Pokemon is now obsolete in my mind, thanks."

Source code  I wanted to have a nice place where there was a countdown to release (once we actually had a date), as well as the #nomanssky IRC channel, so I started working on this.   The main function is to provide a countdown to release. Clicking the icon in the top bar slides out the IRC, so you can chat with fellow NoManNauts while watching numbers go down. It even works on mobile.  Just a few minutes before posting this here, I added the times IGN is releaseing things for First as another countdown below the main one.  Hope you enjoy, and if you want to make it better, go ahead! I will be updating it as new events get added, and of course, will set the main countdown once we have a date."

The hard part is navigation. But you should have your home planet in your overview map. An additional requirement could be to have the center of the galaxy exactly in the middle between you and your home plannet. This would be you halfway point.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhunc,Dudemannerisms,2,Thu Jul 16 18:55:26 2015 UTC,the link is procedural. . .

Something like a daily screenshot thread like people here are suggesting would be great. Daily discoveries. You don't need a contest when the prize is just finding something amazing.  That being said, I will give reddit silver (and possibly something of actual value) to the first person who finds a jackalope."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Linkdead404,6,Fri Jul 17 11:00:10 2015 UTC,Your shield will collapse and your hyperdrive-neutron-compression-chamber will melt down causing an giant explosion that will make the sun implode and causing a black hole that eats up the whole solar system   Congratulations - you've just destroyed your first solar system 2 minutes after you start playing  insert jaden Smith quote here

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,electrictrumpet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think we know for sure if you can or can't, but several people have stated that trying to fly into a sun will be the first thing they do when they get the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,ShiraCheshire,2,Fri Jul 17 11:05:45 2015 UTC,"Yep.  My first goals are to test the limits of what you can and can't do.  Fly into a star,  crash into a planet,  manually travel to a relatively  close  neighboring system,  jetpack onto an asteroid,  space walk on the hull of a capital ship etc."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Pestilence11,2,Fri Jul 17 11:24:05 2015 UTC,"So...7 years later, once you're done traveling to that neighboring system... you'll finally play the game? :D  So...out of curiosity...how are you planning to find out which star in a field of stars - in your first person view - is the closest? ;)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Linkdead404,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:22:06 2015 UTC,"Thats also a question: Are the ingame distances realistic? So 1 ingame meter is equal to the ""real-life"" meter? Also in terms of travelling time?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,philley84,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:31:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I'm hoping that once you start traveling beyond the solar system your position will still be tracked on the galactic map. If that's the case I believe you can rotate along all 3 axis to see if you're headed to the right star. If it doesn't update your position but rather just tells you when you're in a solar system, I'll have no way of knowing, and likely would miss whichever is closest."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Pestilence11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:14:44 2015 UTC,"But...the galactic map doesn't show you at all.  Period.  It shows you what star you're at, and that's it.  Not to mention, the distances between stars is...ungodly.  Like...numbers you can't even begin to fathom..."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Linkdead404,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"Well that'll be a problem then. If you can't differentiate between stars in jump distance to others, if they're visible, it will be tough.  The distance thing I'm aware of but also intrigued about there being things to find between stars.  I've never said I will succeed but attempting sounds interesting to me. I can remember playing Colony Wars on the original PlayStation and being disappointed that distant planets didn't get any closer."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Pestilence11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"Who said there's things to find between the stars?  Also, you can differentiate between the distances...in the galaxy map.  Unfortunately, the galaxy map doesn't seem to show YOU.  At least, not your orientation or anything else."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Linkdead404,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"Sean Murray said there will be things to discover between stars, I believe rogue planets being one of them. I tried to find the source but couldn't, maybe someone else will chip in.  I meant differentiating between stars with the aid of the galactic map. Like say you're on a planet and you can see 4 points of light in the direction you're facing in a certain orientation to each other; you determine, by rotating the galactic map and making them line up in the same pattern, that two of those are stars you can jump to."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Pestilence11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:36:25 2015 UTC,"I don't remember hearing that at all...and I'm not gonna lie...rogue planets would be incredibly hard to find, since they don't have a light source nearby... you could fly relatively close to one and never know it was there...lol. Elite Dangerous actually does the vast voids in space relatively well, where you can be within a few light seconds of a planet, and it's still nothing more than a tiny speck on the screen, if even that.  Lining up the map like that would be INCREDIBLY hard (what with the giant ball of flaming death that you'd have to be looking ""through"" to line stuff up), at least in my opinion. :P"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Linkdead404,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"Well I'm hoping the more arcade nature will help in the spotting of things between systems, but I agree.  The lining up of the map may be borderline impossible but if you're facing away from the star in the system you're currently in, it might be possible. It'll be interesting to rule out if that ends up being the case. Hell it may be possible to waypoint the neighboring star and it be shown highlighted in some fashion, maybe a small chevron above it,  while in your regular first person view. Unlikely as well but you never know."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,Pestilence11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"I think the gaming industry has reached a point where you don't have to think ""is this or that implemented in the game"", you just know its there and it feels intuitive."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,carminejr,0,Fri Jul 17 12:22:58 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't this be in the game. This doesn't seem like the kind of game that makes your ship turn around now does it
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,TableSpoob,0,Fri Jul 17 11:45:33 2015 UTC,Thats what I thought. I just wondered if it was definitely possible.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,philley84,-1,Fri Jul 17 11:47:34 2015 UTC,Would love if this is possdible. Would not like to experience a invisible wall or something.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,philley84,0,Fri Jul 17 11:25:24 2015 UTC,An invisible wall would suck. From what we know about the game though I cant imagine that being the case. I want to see how close we can get before our ship disintergrates.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dm24c,zfarrow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:45:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. And hopefully the suns are ""realistically"" animated / behave in a real way, like small erruptions and moving surfaces. Not just bright bulbs hanging in space."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,shaun056,23,Thu Jul 16 19:23:41 2015 UTC,Beyonce approach? Radiohead did it better
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,mogi67,11,Thu Jul 16 15:51:24 2015 UTC,Simpsons did it!
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,devinup,10,Thu Jul 16 16:20:43 2015 UTC,Release it when it's ready? Sounds more like South Park's wheelhouse.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,yoshi8710,2,Thu Jul 16 17:23:49 2015 UTC,completely agree.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,IanKetterer,36,Thu Jul 16 23:43:32 2015 UTC,"Step 1 - ""BOOM, the game is ready.. enjoy!"" - Sean Murray   I will lose my shit if this happens."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,delta8369,8,Thu Jul 16 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer it that way anyway, better to just open reddit one day, and have my front page full of ""No Man's Sky just got hot-dropped on Steam!"" posts, than to know exactly how long I have to wait. Easier to distract myself and all that."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'd like at least some time to prepare for it. Even if it's a week, because I'm going to buy a ps4 for this game, and I want to be able to start exploring as soon as it releases."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,simonk83,5,Fri Jul 17 00:43:13 2015 UTC,"Just buy one now bud, plenty of amazing games to play while you wait :)"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,kalaster189,2,Fri Jul 17 05:34:19 2015 UTC,And I need to book a week off work =D
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,simonk83,3,Fri Jul 17 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"Never take time off of work for a game. ESPECIALLY when a game relies on the internet to function. You could spend your entire day off in server ques or worse multiple days for them to fix/ add servers. These days, it's too risky and your time is too valuable to be wasted on waiting around for the game to function properly."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,kalaster189,4,Fri Jul 17 03:48:26 2015 UTC,"NMS doesn't require the internet to function thankfully.  You can still go do your thing, you just can't upload discoveries.   Not the end of the world if that happens for a few days :)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,basura1979,3,Fri Jul 17 04:40:46 2015 UTC,"Aye! That's good to hear! I HATE things like that, like Elite Dangerous' single player still required an internet connection, and also Diablo 3! Thanks for the info :D"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Whats_upchuck,2,Fri Jul 17 04:40:21 2015 UTC,"Nah its still a valid point.  I would still be mad upset, but then I'd make myself feel better and remind myself that my wanker boss is paying for my little mess"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,kalaster189,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:18 2015 UTC,"I almost never take a full week off anyway. I try to snag Fridays only; five long weekends are worth WAY more than one week off to me.  And that's my plan for NMS too. It's got to work on one of those weekends, right?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,basura1979,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:19 2015 UTC,"Well, someone confirmed to me that there's an offline mode, so if there are server issues, you can always just go offline :D"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Dizman7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:37:51 2015 UTC,"This is a valid point.  I say now that I'll be fine with waiting another week, but in all realism we all know that the hype-train derailment will be torture while we wait for the patch.  At least I've now got a third thing that could happen that would (temporarily) make the game suck.  I need these to temper my excitement"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Nicholost,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:28:16 2015 UTC,I think I'd like some prep time too -- probably going to take a day off to relax and enjoy it.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,agnl,15,Fri Jul 17 02:39:01 2015 UTC,"I dunno if it's a fiasco.  If they'd given a date, then retracted it, then given another, then changed, that'd be more of a fiasco to me. Â  It's just the normal hype ""must have"" attitudes of avid fans (myself included) grasping to at any little tidbit of news to hopefully learn when they can get their hands on it themselves.  Much like a very determined child trying to slam a square peg in to a round hole on some toy. Â  I agree though, I hope they just do a ""And it's available now"" thing with it, versus giving us a date to obsess over. Â  I'd think the game has enough hype/press/goodwill going for it at this point that placing TV ads and what not wouldn't get them too many more sales.  And even as Sean says, he finds it very hard to demo the game in little 5-10-15min demos, how would it benefit from a 30 sec ad then?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,blueExcess,6,Thu Jul 16 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"I probably should have worded it better, I mostly just wanted to share my thoughts and get a conversation rolling."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,ramsay101,11,Thu Jul 16 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this theory and have proposed the same to friends.  Nothing about NMS' release stategy has been typical and even Sean has said that himself.  HG just kinda showed a trailer at VGX 2013 and stole the show with it.  There was no announcement of what they were working on, no teasers leading up, and no hints to the media telling them ""hey, look what I got.""  IIRC, at E3, he wanted to announce a release date and alluded that HG was close, but refrained.  I think this was also about the same time Sony got involved with the game and I suspect a Sony/PC exclusive contract was in the works, so the release date was withheld until the paperwork was finalized.  In the meantime, the media has been given nibbles of the game and told to obey an embargo.  They have, but more than one has said the game looks complete.  And remember, Sean said this is not a game where you can show one very polished level while the rest of the game is a mess, so if media guys who are typically very critical say it looks complete, it is very very close.  So my prediction, which agrees with your point /u/CannabisPrime2, is that the final day of IGN's ""Month of NMS"" will either be the release date or they will announce ""hey this [insert week day], the game will be available.""  No drawn out period where people are lusting and waiting at the risk of the excitement eroding, just ""bam, here's the game"" within a week.  And if that logic is true, I predict the release to be the first week of August.  Edit: word/spelling correction and punctuation."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Nicholost,4,Thu Jul 16 16:46:28 2015 UTC,I've said it before and I'll say it again: August 4th is my guess.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Nicholost,2,Thu Jul 16 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"Why Aug. 4th?   Anyone know what day it is that games are typically released? I know movies are like Wednesdays and Fridays, DVDs(bluerays) are tuesdays... Something like that anyways."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Mozzia,3,Thu Jul 16 17:11:51 2015 UTC,"Most AAA games follow the Tuesday release date schedule. Indy devs and smaller game studios may not follow that in recent years but, with Sony doing the marketing, I'm pretty positive it'll be a Tuesday release."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Nicholost,2,Thu Jul 16 17:57:20 2015 UTC,PSN usually makes games available and starts sales on Tuesdays.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,grgisme,2,Thu Jul 16 17:17:02 2015 UTC,I think that is a solid guess.  I have given the same prediction to friends based on the logic above and because it is a Tuesday.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Mozzia,3,Thu Jul 16 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"If Sony has any say, the game won't release until school is back in session."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,dandjent,3,Thu Jul 16 23:24:35 2015 UTC,Because Sony hates children???
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Mr_Krabs_Left_Nut,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:29 2015 UTC,"No idea, but thoughts...   Adults have more time to play (possibly), due to kids being preoccupied with homework. Highschool and College students will discuss the game amongst themselves at class and spread the word more?   I can't imagine what other benefit school in session would have..."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,dandjent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:42:04 2015 UTC,"Because it turns out that instead of having tons of free time during the summer, kids are actually doing stuff.  In school season the come home and play video games.  Especially when the weather isn't nice enough to go outside for long."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Mr_Krabs_Left_Nut,2,Sun Jul 19 03:56:48 2015 UTC,"Well this made me very happy. Obviously, you're just speculating, but you're explanation seems legit. If NMS comes out in August it will be a birthday to remember for me. I'll be 21 so, I'm gonna buy a case and go on a drunken adventure through the universe :)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,extreme_fluffiness,2,Thu Jul 16 21:18:41 2015 UTC,Be sure to take lots of pics so you can relive the adventure when sober:)
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,grgisme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:58:50 2015 UTC,Oh I will! I literally have over 500 screenshots in The Witcher 3. I can't imagine how many I'll have in NMS. I'm probably going to take a picture of each planet I visit haha. I can't wait!
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,_CitizenSnips_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:25:42 2015 UTC,I didn't even think of taking screenshots until a couple of days ago.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,skullscrashdown,2,Fri Jul 17 12:53:29 2015 UTC,"I like your analysis, sounds legit. That day would be an instant ps4 purchase for me (in my case more convenient than buying a new pc/laptop) - probably something other fans are considering too and sony's speculating on anyway.   Thus far NMS's marketing has been so unusual, it seems highly likely that the release date will be dropped like a massive bomb as well."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,basura1979,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:02:40 2015 UTC,"One correction here -- Sony got involved just before E3 2014 (a year ago+), which is why it was first shown during the Sony 2014 conference. This was the second year it was shown.  It was the 2015 E3 (a month ago) that Sean said they were going to announce the release date, but couldn't for ""reasons""."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,StifflerCP,2,Fri Jul 17 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"I think those ""reasons"" were because they wanted to see what else was getting a release date at E3, so they could play accordingly."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,NickJosue,0,Fri Jul 17 03:43:08 2015 UTC,I predict the release to be the first week of August   I'm going away august 7 for a week so really hope it isn't then haha I'd be killing myself looking at all the buzz surrounding it online while I was interstate unable to play my beloved NMS
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Linkdead404,16,Fri Jul 17 00:34:50 2015 UTC,I like the way you think CannabisPrime2.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,NickJosue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:48:02 2015 UTC,Sony doesn't have to allow anything. It's self published
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Linkdead404,6,Thu Jul 16 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"But they've got a deal with Sony and IGN.  Publishing their game on PS4 means they HAVE to go through Sony.  Sony could just be all ""nope, not ready"" until they want to release it, and bam, it doesn't release until then, even if they didn't have a deal with them.  I'm relatively certain that Sony has at least SOME say in when the game releases.  Just like I'm relatively certain IGN has SOME say in when the release date announcement releases. >.>"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,niccoli,6,Thu Jul 16 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yup. Since HG is a small dev. company, they obviously couldn't afford to do the marketing themselves. That's why they turned down financial help from Sony and instead asked for the spot at the conference and gave them exclusivity (more or less). Doing that made sure that Sony had less control over them than if they had accepted the money, but Sony still has a little control. It was likely Sony that made the deal with IGN (or IGN with Sony) to do this feature thing. Actually - Does anyone know if IGN has announced release dates for other games at the end of other IGN First months?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,darkautumnhour,2,Thu Jul 16 17:15:57 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I imagine Hello Games have surprisingly little power over the larger decisions. Most of their strategy will be dictated by the Sony overlords.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Nazryl,2,Thu Jul 16 16:25:05 2015 UTC,"It's all speculation. Considering it's an independent game, I would imagine Sony is in little more than an advisory role. Especially considering that there's a PC version dropping as well that doesn't have any restrictions via Sony. Listening to Sony's advice isn't a bad idea, but it doesn't mean they have to do what they say. Also Sony wouldn't block the release on the store with a game they aren't publishing. Companies tend to get bad reputation when they act like five year olds.  Either way, Sony isn't publishing or funding the game, no advertising deal is going to change that."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,nonsensykal,2,Thu Jul 16 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, an advertising deal IS going to change that actually.  Marketing tends to be a HUGE portion of any games final costs.  Some triple A games have marketing budgets that are quite a bit larger than the development budget.  If Sony is doing all the marketing, on their own dime, they'll have some say over the release date.    Also, this game was initially going to be a PS4 exclusive.  You can't just ""release"" games on consoles.  They have to go through a rather intensive vetting system first.  All Sony would have to do would be to say ""nope, not ready for our console""."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Linkdead404,3,Thu Jul 16 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"Marketing for AAA titles is much different than that of Indie developers, especially considering they are publishing this title on their own.  AAA titles rely on more conventional means of marketing, while indie devs usually only have budgets to support viral campaigns.  That said, the % budget would be different.  Your point about Sony vetting the game for consoles, however, is absolutely bang on."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,NickJosue,9,Thu Jul 16 18:33:29 2015 UTC,Like the insane amount of $$ put into Destiny's marketing.  Too bad they didn't put that much energy into the game design.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Linkdead404,3,Thu Jul 16 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"Ouch. This one hurts.   I really wish they would have spent less money licensing led Zep songs and more money creating dynamic levels, charismatic voice actors, and a least one drunk idiot to write the story out on a paper napkin before publishing."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,NickJosue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:09 2015 UTC,I couldn't upvote this burn nowhere near as much as I want too. You've won my eternal awe.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Linkdead404,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:49:08 2015 UTC,Zing!
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,NickJosue,3,Thu Jul 16 23:09:50 2015 UTC,That's good and all...except that sony is treating this game as if it was from one of their own development houses.  They're giving it the Triple A treatment as far as marketing goes.  That's why IGN is doing their thing.  That's why it's been in tons of magazines.  That's why it's had a /prime stage/ event at the last two E3 shows.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Spamcaster,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"Television campaigns are where about 90% of that cost is, and they aren't doing TV ads. A few blog mentions and three minutes at E3 aren't all that costly in comparison.   I'm aware of the vetting process. It's not all that complicated. Apple uses similar practices for their devices.   I'd suggest looking at https://www.playstation.com/en-us/develop/  They put it in all caps for me."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Linkdead404,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"You understand that's an application to put games out on the PS...not the vetting of the game/software to actually be approved for sale on the device, right?  It's a lot of submitting, back and forth, and possible modifications, explanations etc.  It's a pain in the ass.  And Sony can EASILY say ""No, we aren't going to do this."" in return.    Second, marketing is expensive, period.  TV campaigns are a huge portion of it, but not 90%.  And E3 stage shows aren't expensive?  Are you joking?  E3 stage presentations, for even 3 minutes, are outrageously expensive.  And if you have booths involved, it's even more outrageous.  And I'm sure No Man's Sky will have a booth presence at shows after it releases.  If they go to E3, they can expect to spend anywhere from 100k to 500k for a booth."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Crosbie71,2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm aware of how the process works. Apple works the exact same way. The point of the link was that self publishers set the release date themselves.   The marketing that No Man's Sky has received is chump change, comparatively speaking. They didn't have a booth at E3. The three minutes of stage time really isn't all that much. Apart from letting them show a few minutes of the game on stage, twice a year, what other marketing has Sony definitively set up? A few tweets? A blog post? There was a concert by 65dos, but that wasn't a free event, Sony likely recouped the cost of that on admission.   This isn't a full blown marketing campaign by Sony. They'd be idiots to throw AAA-level marketing money at a game they don't have a stranglehold on. And it's obvious they aren't."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,TyroneDaThug,0,Thu Jul 16 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"...ooookay, I'm done arguing with your amazing marketing experience and genius.  Clearly, you know everything and every little cent involved, as opposed to some people that may have actually gone through the process.  But hey, it's all you, man.  Oh, and fyi...Sony is treating this as if it's an in house developer.  You can bet your ass they're putting a huge amount of money into marketing it.  (and marketing includes stuff like magazine articles, genius.)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Linkdead404,2,Thu Jul 16 20:02:22 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take a genius to realize that they aren't advertising it like that. TV ads are phenomenally expensive. AAA titles get TV ads. Ergo, they aren't treating it like an in house title.   As far as magazines go, it's journalism. Some of it might be bought, but most of it is free advertising. Magazines make their money on proper ads and sales.  Either way, chill out, it's an internet discussion"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,ocofan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"They may have a deal with Sony, but we know that deal has already been altered.  No Man's Sky was initially a timed exclusive on the PS4, and now HG is releasing it on PS4 and PC simultaneously.  If Sony wants to hold off on releasing the game on the PS4 for marketing but HG is ready for release sooner, they have the option to release the game on Steam, don't they?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,RexRPGs,2,Thu Jul 16 20:29:54 2015 UTC,Unless their deal specifically says they aren't allowed to.  Breach of Contract is a pretty big thing. :P
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,RyanB_,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:36 2015 UTC,Pray they do not alter the deal any further.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,WetWoolley,2,Thu Jul 16 19:00:54 2015 UTC,that may not be true. our boy sean said in the past that they couldn't develop for two systems at once cuz how small they are and that the deal was that they would work on the ps4 version first and try to release on pc as soon as they could. there has never been a official statement that the game was a timed exclusive but that it was just the nature of their development. it just seems that they were wrong and could pump out a ps4 and pc version at the same time. no need to speculate homie.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Blue_Blazer_NZ,3,Thu Jul 16 19:39:58 2015 UTC,"Literally, nearly every single post on this forum is speculation."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Nechryael,0,Thu Jul 16 20:34:39 2015 UTC,Sony would have quite an extensive legal team to contend with in any case.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,trynagetrich,2,Thu Jul 16 16:31:56 2015 UTC,Shit maybe I have high expectations but I'm kind of expecting/hoping it to be released before two weeks into August

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,TyroneDaThug,3,Fri Jul 17 14:24:57 2015 UTC,"I kind of thought that they would just give a release date by the end of this month, and that it would be sometime in mid-August.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,niccoli,5,Thu Jul 16 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"I myself have been in advertising for 10 years and have experienced the transition from print advertising, to digital and now focused mainly on mobile and a big DOOH project launching soon and I agree with you that marketing strategies have changed a lot especially with the immense growth in social media.   I'm not sure about a sudden release but then again NMS is, by all accounts, an unconventional game with an unconventional fan base so perhaps an unconventional release strategy could happen. No doubt that it would be a success, as you said, and perhaps HG have convinced Sony to let them handle it their way?  Post release, every uploaded YT video will be a no-spoiler commercial for the game (except for revealing what's at the centre, of course) and that will keep driving sales upward with only the efforts of the community.  There is indeed an organic feel to everything NMS related and in all my years of working in media, I have never seen more organic hype around a titleâhype that I too am on board with all the way!

ARK has sold very impressively (over 1 million copies in 30 days) since the early access release and it owes a lot of that success to the huge hype generated by the movie. When is space stuff going to be at its peak this year? When Star Wars: The Force Awakens releases in December.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,darkautumnhour,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:17 2015 UTC,Exactly. The ARK/Jurrasic World thing worked because there were no big AAA games that were taking up people attention at the time. It was a Movie and a Game. In November/December there will be Star Wars Battlefront and Fallout 4 taking up peoples attention (and money). I HIGHLY doubt NMS wants to compete with 2 HUGE AAA releases.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,darkautumnhour,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"The marketing is going fine. It's already gathered a cult following (namely us) and is rapidly appealing to a wider audience as it appears on huge sites like IGN, and in national newspapers such as Guardian and Independent.  It's obvious that the release date will be given at the end of the IGN coverage.  Given Hello Games' very demanding job descriptions and their relationship with Sony (who, I have no doubt, have much better qualified marketers than some amateur who gives them advice on Reddit, instead of contacting them directly) I don't fancy your chances of working with Murray.."

I think you're giving Sony's marketing staff a bit too much credit, IMO.  I've working with large and small organizations over the past 12 years and my largest take away is that very little outside the box thinking happens in the former.  Large organizations cater to 'not rocking the boat', while smaller companies thrive on thinking differently."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,darkautumnhour,-2,Thu Jul 16 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"That's not going to happen.  Any game developer, indie or other, working on a title with all this commotion is not going to just drop the bomb like that. It would be a dick move to just do a guerrilla release. All the twitch streamers wouldn't be able to work the release into their schedules, and organize their fanbase. PSN would be a huge bottle neck if every one gets whole at 4pm that day and starts downloading. Game sites wouldn't have time to produce proper copy for the announcement. It would be a big mess and worse: a huge blunder for the reputation of HG: You guys can break the rules when it comes to creating the game, but you can't say fuck you to the industry and upset the infrastructure designed to help your game succeed. People want to have events, playing parties, Live Tweets, and it all goes down hill if the can't plan for the magic night."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dikyd,Kelvets,4,Thu Jul 16 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it would create quite the amount of animosity you predict. Personally I would just be impressed at the risk they would be taking. I'm not particularly knowledgable about the Let's Play/Twitch streaming craze, but do they really feel somehow entitled to all these things you describe? And why should I care if some other guy isn't gonna be able to play the game on Twitch on the day of release? As a consumer I would just think it was a cool, unorthodox way to release their game that's totally in line with their design philosophy: just go do it. Don't think about it too much, don't try to poke holes in it, don't analyze the hell out of it, just get in your ship and go find something cool.   As far as the concern over the pressure the PSN would be under, I don't really understand the logic. Would there not be more people ready to buy and download the game the second it was released if there was a release date published in advance? If they put it up on the store right this second, I would have to either just happen to see it myself, or I would have to hear about it online or by word of mouth. It seems like less people would be trying to download it at any one time, not more. Yeah it would be a disruption, it might even be kinda chaotic. It would be on the front page of reddit and countless gaming and tech news sites almost instantly, all free publicity. People would be falling over themselves trying to get their hands on it. I don't see how that's a bad thing. How in the world would anyone think they have the right to be angry about that?"

I think I'd be relatively fine with that, if it is somehow easier to do. But I see that as significantly more work for HG, an API is likely something that  they would already have; this would probably amount to exposing and then securing & caching a subset of their internal API."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,xevioso,4,Thu Jul 16 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"I think one of the problems here is determining what elements could be kept as records in a database and what elements are procedurally generated.  For example, all of the things Trylobot listed would probably be recorded to the database.    But something like the cost of Element X at station Y may be procedurally generated.  We don't know if the in game economy allows for the fluctuating of prices across 18 quintillion planets and their stations.  My suspicion is that this is procedurally generated, and if so, including this information would require the game to essentially re-generate the system, even if only in memory, to get the data."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,ahref,3,Thu Jul 16 21:40:05 2015 UTC,Aggregated stats are probably easy. But yes i'd agree everything in the amazing detail that NMS provides would be too much.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,Linkdead404,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you understand what is meant by API. This has nothing to do with modding or any kind of modification to the experience. This would be a server-side exposure of read-only data to be consumed by another application for the purpose of generating, for instance, more complicated or longer-term statistics. For instance, complicated questions like ""where can I go to make the most money from Element X?"" could be answered more quickly if you have a way to search all discovered celestial bodies for certain characteristics, like ""nearby station's current selling price of Element X"".  This doesn't really change the experience, since as a player you would presumably be able to see this information anyway via your Atlas.  It might, though, let someone create a giant galactic map of all discovered systems and draw the spacelanes of travel atop it, making for some really potentially beautiful imagery."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,ahref,0,Thu Jul 16 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"That...is actually a fairly HUGE change in gameplay...since the game is all about the experience of discovery...not being told where to go, or what things in certain places are important.  Which leads into mods.  Yes, releasing the API isn't directly towards modding, but that's it's primary use.  I /highly/ doubt they'll support this in any way, since they've stated time and time again that it's about the journey...not being led by the hand."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,Linkdead404,0,Thu Jul 16 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"You're still misunderstanding.  Server Side APIs do not allow users to create ingame mods.  Such services can have tight spoiler control etc so that users who don't want to see things...can't.  By reading this reddit you are actually spoilering some of the gameplay yourself. By watching IGN videos the same.   All the OP is asking for is access to statistics and data.  For example an api request to bungie's platform might return:  { membershipId: '4611686018439937000',   membershipType: 1,   characters:    [ { characterBase: [Object],        levelProgression: [Object],        emblemPath: '/common/destiny_content/icons/117285c72a9c89626cd7b3fa3d7226ee.jpg',        backgroundPath: '/common/destiny_content/icons/2c73bcd2e874e640f158197bb9f2c55d.jpg',        emblemHash: 776529032,        characterLevel: 2,        baseCharacterLevel: 2,        isPrestigeLevel: false,        percentToNextLevel: 50.1219521 } ],   inventory:    { buckets: { Invisible: [], Item: [], Currency: [] },      currencies: [ [Object] ] },   grimoireScore: 85 }   From that you could then make an automatic forum signature for a user: http://i.ahref.co.uk/u/r/e5qQ.png  In the context of NMS we could make a request and get this: http://i.ahref.co.uk/u/r/kCFg.png  But in raw data."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,LtRapman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"sigh  I understand what an API is.  I also understand that API's are primarily used for and in mods.  That is their primary function.  No, it's not their only function...but it's their primary one.  And even the OP is asking for it about mods, even though he's denying it.  By saying he can use it to make tools that will tell him prices of resources at certain stations, things like that.  Those are mods, at a very basic level.  And my last point still stands, I'd rather their tiny team work hard at getting the game to release, not work on side shit that /has no impact/ on the actual game.  Remember, this is crew of less than 20 people, releasing a game that is massive in scale."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,Linkdead404,3,Thu Jul 16 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say so but you really have a completely wrong understanding of an API.  What /u/Trylobot is suggesting is basically http://www.destinydb.com/ but for No Man's Sky. That's no modification of the game, it's only a way to show the collected date on a website or a smartpone app.  EDIT: But I see why you think they wouldn't so such a thing and maybe you're right. On the other side they already told us that we will see other players ""messages"" on the planets and that they expect to see the creation of natural paths by the users who follow other users."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,ahref,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:39:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, I know what an API is.  I understand it completely.  Let me rephrase in a better way, one last time.  I do not believe they will make it available, because Sean has said time and time again, that they don't want to lead people by the hand.  They want it to be about exploration and discovery.  Letting people willingly data mine the game, letting them pull shit out of the database and post about it.  That's not much different than leading them by the hand.  It's also the ENTIRE reason Sean has only been showing off outer rim planets.  He wants shit to be a surprise as you go on."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,FFlashh,0,Thu Jul 16 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"I've never suggested that any of the data in the API would in any way ruin the surprise. In fact, I would also be against that. I also notice that you keep changing your argument. I'm starting to think you're some kind of contrarian.  More importantly, HG has already stated that they would love to provide some kind of API specifically in lieu of modding, so that they won't have to worry as much about people trying to mod. So an API of this nature is highly probable. I'd get used to the idea of it being a possibility in the game's future."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,ahref,2,Fri Jul 17 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"Those are not modifications to the game's core code. At all.   Tools yes. Mods no.   As for APIs, usually they already exist they are just closed. Its the standard way of making things these days."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,FFlashh,0,Thu Jul 16 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"What he is saying is someone can use the API to farm information which educates them on certain aspects of the game re: resources, trade prices, etc. Someone very well could make a plugin using the API which gives them such information."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:27:53 2015 UTC,A browser based or phone based companion yes. But not an actual modification.  Yes its semantics but we need to be clear here. We're not requesting access to the NMS internals or access to the game's code.   Could you cheat with this data? Yes? Do you have to? No.  Even without this API you can't stop players from making spreadsheets. Elite:Dangerous and Eve have tons of online tools for working out how to make money.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,ahref,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"There is utterly zero reason why someone can't make a mod which pulls information from the online API and displays it in game. You would be changing the in game UI for starters, that's considered modding AFAIK.  You wouldn't be able to pull information from the NMS client code due to its procedural nature, only your surroundings exist at any given time on your hard drive - & I haven't seen U/linkdead404 state that anywhere, & I'm fairly certain he understands that. Maybe I've missed something, though.  Either way, as I stated in another post, I support an API as I'm a stat-whore, lol. I don't think cheating would have any lasting effect on the economy."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,teuchito,2,Thu Jul 16 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"You're confusing mod's with tools.  The tools that could be created via API access are more like references, data-banks and stock exchanges. They don't modify the game itself, they simply change the meta-game. API access or not, this stuff will happen. Whether it be via reddit, or player-made websites. You can't stop that (nor would HelloGames want to stop that) its just that the tools could be a lot better, more impressive and more useful if they had API access.  Look at EVE: Online and the plethora of tools players have made using the public API (I've even got my own excel spreadsheet that incorporates the API to update with the live market prices for every item in every region/constellation in the EVE universe). It is incredible - but at the end of the day, the EVE Online game is still 100% controlled and operated by the dev's. It would be no different with No Man's Sky.  Alongside that - API access doesn't mean everyone is exposed to it - only to those who search for and/or want to create tools to go alongside the game. Anyone who is against it does NOT have to use these tools and can simply convince themselves they don't exist. They can convince themselves the API is not accessible and your gameplay would not change whatsoever. It would be as if the API is private.  Ergo, it is not a mod."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,Linkdead404,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:24:01 2015 UTC,"Except that would be a mod it requires adding code to the game's runtime, and as such would require modding support from the developers.  A server side API that opens in your browser is not a mod to the game's code. It is a companion.   You seem to understand APIs but To be SEVERELY clear.  We are talking about a server side(HG side) api that NEVER touches your running copy of NMS directly.   Properly authenticated developers using their own servers make requests to servers on HG's side of things that respond with data."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,DoctorLovejuice,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:09:38 2015 UTC,"An API is just a thing that would let you use data from the game in say, a website. But it wouldn't let you modify the game itself. At all. And HG wouldn't need to spend extra time doing it, since they said they are going to have one. What OP says is to make that API public for everyone to use."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,ahref,-3,Thu Jul 16 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"As a modder, I disagree with your use of the word mod. It is likely that all of the information provided via an API would also be available in-game, to each player. An API simply provides a way for another application to consume the data, instead of only humans. How is this modding? And since when does HG want to tell people how to play? I thought NMS would be all about playing however the heck you want to play?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,Ozaga,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"sighs    It's highly unlikely that all the information available in an API would be available in game without taking a ton of effort.  Most of the information, especially numbers, isn't readily available for you at the press of a button in the game.  It's about exploring and finding those things.  When you're spoon fed shit, it doesn't mean anything.    As a person that actually wants NMS to come out, I object to you asking a tiny ass team to do extra work so that you can play your game your way, when I'd rather they release the game so we can all play it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,Murrdogg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:08:56 2015 UTC,I doubt it would be much extra work - all it involves is publicly showing the read-only data to the players. It would no doubt be analytics that are readily available to the HG team anyway.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djfdq,EEKman,0,Fri Jul 17 05:55:31 2015 UTC,"Really? You object to feature requests in general, then, or is it something more personal?  Hello Games has specifically requested player feedback and has stated that future development will be driven by community response. It is exactly what I am doing here. If you do not have anything to contribute beyond a vague disagreement, I would ask that you view other posts."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl1bi,LegalizeMyself,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:10:35 2015 UTC,You know PC gaming is on the rise when IGN starts a PC gaming show. Now if only they'd figure out how PCs work and stop showcasing games on crappy PCs at low settings. Lulz.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl1bi,devinup,2,Fri Jul 17 03:48:23 2015 UTC,I wonder if that might be due to how many people aren't willing to spend on gaming machines. Trying to promote gaming for PC peasants. IGN does tend to cater to the lowest common denominator.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl1bi,NickJosue,2,Fri Jul 17 03:54:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I just remember their SimCity coverage (as much as I'd prefer to forget that game ever happened). The game looked really bad in their videos. They had the settings on low. If you're showing off a game to potentially millions of viewers and it's your profession and livelihood, you should have a computer that lets you play it on high settings. It's not like SimCity was a demanding game either. Sims 4 also looked pretty bad in their videos. I assume they're just playing this stuff on crappy PCs. They're definitely console-centric, but gaming PC sales are going up, up, up. I think they realized that they need to put some kind of focus on it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl1bi,devinup,3,Fri Jul 17 03:57:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hadn't been on IGN more than a few times since... Before the full front page splash ad era. Whenever that started. Only reason I'm visiting now is this game.   That's pretty bad about SimCity though, I have it and ran it on decently high settings on a Mac laptop. Whatever they're using must be utter garbage. Same with Sims 4. They aren't all that demanding.   On that note, I should probably look into building a gaming PC, if PC gaming really is coming back in a big way."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl1bi,NickJosue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:08:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Probably just some computer with integrated graphics. Like something they use to put content up on their website. Lol. You should check it out. Steam sales and Humble Bundle make games ridiculously cheap. Most PC gamers have a huge backlog of games they haven't gotten around to playing. Not sure if that's good or not, but yeah."

I've also got a couple dozen Xbone games that I need to get around to one of these days.   They'll all end up waiting though. Getting The Binding of Isaac next week, that'll keep me busy for a while. And Diablo 3 is probably getting a massive update next month. First world problems.  Any suggestions for where to get PC equipment these days?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl1bi,NickJosue,2,Fri Jul 17 04:26:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I guess to be fair, I still have PS3 games sitting around that I never finished, but at least I started most of those. Oh well.  Yes. Newegg is definitely where I would recommend getting PC components. You can also try searching on Slickdeals for the specific part you're looking for. If there's a good sale on some other site, that works too. Just be aware if it's a site you've never heard of before, you may want to Google it and make sure it's on the up and up. Newegg is the safest bet though and they usually have some pretty good deals going on."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3djd3e,DurMan667,2,Fri Jul 17 01:15:53 2015 UTC,"He ended saying that the NMS you play at launch will be very different one year later.   I'm curious about how this will work with the procedural generation system. When a small update to one feature can change all the planets in the universe, how do they add new features?  I'd guess that since they have servers that track what planets have been visited, they can roll out patches that only affect unvisited planets (visited planets then still get generated as they were originally discovered). They might also use new galaxies for additional content.  The former idea could get a bit awkward since the game would need to keep different versions of its code around to generate different worlds. Fixing bugs would also be interesting. I can imagine a scenario where players discover that traveling to ""ancient"" planets uncovers glitches that can be used for exploits that were later patched out of the game. I have no doubt that Hello Games has a plan for updates, but it will be interesting to see how it works in practice."

I imagine if they do big, game-changing updates they too will be in new galaxies that you will need to get to (via the centre of your current galaxy maybe).  But who knows, I'll be interested to see how they tackle it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djd3e,SpeedyVT,2,Fri Jul 17 06:10:23 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing, the team members are running different galaxies right now if they're using different builds of the game. The trick will be to get consistent galaxies for all players while still pushing updates (and consistency before/after updates as well). Again, not impossible by any means, but it's an interesting technical challenge."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3djd3e,devinup,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I think they'd have to be a lot more buddy buddy with Nintendo for that. They seem much closer to Sony. What happened to Extreme-G? Those were fun games. Or Wipeout. There's a Sony franchise, although it has its own development team that pretty much just does Wipeout.  Edit: Apparently Throwback Entertainment has the rights to Extreme-G, although they don't appear to be doing anything with that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwback_Entertainment  Edit 2: I guess Sony Liverpool went bottoms up while working on a new Wipeout game for PS4. ""Sony Liverpool had been working on a Wipeout game for the upcoming PlayStation 4 console when the studio was closed on 22 August 2012.[2]"" So unless Sony has found a replacement, nobody is around to make another Wipeout. Hint hint. ;) Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipeout_(series)  Edit 3: For whatever it's worth, no real F-Zero game has been released since 2004. I thought this Criterion/Nintendo tie-in was interesting, although that's after Sean had already left that studio. ""In June 2015, news site Nintendo Life reveals that in early 2011 Nintendo of Europe approached Burnout series developer Criterion Games to work on a pitch for a new F-Zero game which they hoped to unveil at E3 that same year alongside the then-unreleased Wii U console, and potentially release the game during the console's launch period. However, the developer was unable to handle the pitch as, at the time, they devoted much of their resources into the development of Need for Speed: Most Wanted for multiple platforms. The site was tipped by an anonymous, yet ""reliable"" source, but they had confirmed this information when Criterion co-founder Alex Ward (who left the company in 2014) admitted that Nintendo of Europe did indeed approach the company for a potential F-Zero game on the Wii U.[32]"" Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Zero"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,SuperGodman234,8,Thu Jul 16 23:38:17 2015 UTC,"Not really. The elements being there doesn't necessarily mean they will pose a great challenge against the player.  For all we know, space pirates may not be that interested in attacking the player's ship (since no NPC's on the ground, I think we can rule out being attacked by them on a planet out) unless the player participates in combat against them first.  Sure, death from eaten-alive-by-a-huge-AF-alien-creature is bound to happen to most at some point. We don't know how the ""planet-police"" replicators will react to just changing too much on the planet - we've seen them come in force if you actively attack them, sure, but what if you were to just stay away from them even when you have a ""wanted level"" with them?  What I'm getting at here is that just because many things can kill you in this game, doesn't mean it's gonna be difficult."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,DawnBlue,3,Thu Jul 16 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"Wow. The comparison I was gonna make with Battletoads sounds stupid now, even though I've never played it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,TemptedDreamer,3,Fri Jul 17 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"Battle toads is still harder. I can spend 10 hours wandering the planet and as long as I don't shoot to kill I won't get hurt and the game will be easy.   The wanted level I believe are for those who like causing wanton destruction wherever they go. They're gonna have it hard.   It's like punching a solid concrete block. It hurts you more than the block versus sitting on a concrete block, it hurts no one"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,EEKman,2,Fri Jul 17 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"I think people are underestimating the difficulty. For one, we've only seen the outer rim planets, we know they get harder. Sean has said this is not a tech demo, its not utopia, things want to kill you.   The penalty for death is pretty harsh. Losing your ship with all cargo and tech in space combat is harsh. If beacons are far apart, dying on a planet is harsh too. We know its a challenge just to take out a small freighter and next to impossible to take out a fleet. If you play as a pirate you will have to pick your targets carefully.  Sean said it will take alot of resources and you will have to be 'clever' to get to the center. This is a guy who grew up on elite and loves roguelike survival games. You think its gonna be easy?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,DawnBlue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's gonna be too easy, no, but conflict existing in it doesn't prove it's gonna be too hard either.  Why would you want to take down a freighter alone - or more accurately why would you need to? It's not necessary as far as I know.  The risk of losing your stuff on planet can be helped with using your ship to change locations.  It's not gonna be Dark Souls 3: Space. That's what I expect at least.  I don't even want it to be too easy either btw. Also, final note: I've no idea how hard Elite is :p"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,Spode87,2,Fri Jul 17 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"Elite doesn't seem to be hard too, when you look at it. There's even less dangers than there's in NMS. But what makes it hard is the fact that you don't know what the fuck you should do at first. There's a lot of stars, and a lot of space stations which sell resources at different prices. At the first space station you spawn in, there's a huge list of items you can buy. And in first playthrough, you can only pick resources to buy at random. Then, you need to pick a star to warp into. If you randomly pick a dangerous system - you're dead. If you pick a system, which doesn't buy items that you bought at a higher price, you result in a credits loss and you can end up with no fuel in your ship. Not knowing what will come up next is what makes Elite hard and interesting. And I hope same will be applied to NMS.  And why the hell do you think that pirates only attack you if you attack them? It's kinda stupid, you know? Isn't it the meaning of pirates, to attack innocent ships?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,DawnBlue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:27:40 2015 UTC,"True true, the difficulty is in the not knowing - although many people will probaby follow the footsteps of others: if the game doesn't tell them much about what they can do, they'll go online and find out about, say, best materials to farm or what kind of ship is better instead of finding out themselves.  About the pirates thing... Possibly, maybe. I've just gotten the feeling that this game is not intended to be difficult like that.  I already mentioned the ""no NPCs on planets"" thing, so I also wonder: if I were to be chased by pirates / space police / whatever I attack in space, then land on a planet, what would happen?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,Spode87,2,Fri Jul 17 12:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and it's definetely one of the cool parts of NMS: you can do what you what. You can look things up on the Internet, or you can explore things all by yourself. I prefer the latter way of playing games, but I also find it really, really amazing when players cooperate with each other through the Internet to find all the game's secrets. It's a great feeling when you realize that you helped many people to master the game.  We've already seen enemy ships going through planet's atmosphere. I think that they will continue shooting you from their ships when you land. And considering that you're helpless against enemy spaceships when you're on foot, landing basically means dying."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,Crosbie71,5,Fri Jul 17 13:16:06 2015 UTC,"I was a little worried about the goat persistently headbutting you and the rapid escalation of wanted stars leading in short order to a fiery death.   Partly because it seemed like boring run-straight-at-you AI, but also because I want to be able to choose to be unhurried.   I don't mind it being difficult if you get yourself into scrapes or choose high-stakes routes to progression. I just don't want to be nagged, hassled, harrassed or bullied by a game.   I'm pretty sure HG are aware of this..."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,grgisme,4,Fri Jul 17 08:07:46 2015 UTC,"I honestly do believe it's going to be very ""easy"", and very ""casual"" for anyone that wants that kind of experience.  I'm hoping it will be too, so I may be biased. I work hard all day, I don't want to struggle to survive at night. I want to peacefully explore a planet or two in my free time.  I like that there's sentinels to protect life -- it's the Doctor Who / Star Trek style directive of do no harm. Many seem to view the sentinels as something to be challenged -- and perhaps the game will give a reason to make it so, but I also see it as encouraging players to be peaceful if their purpose is simply exploration.  The older I get, the more ""casual"" I want my games. Arkham Knight is about as difficult as I want to deal with."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,Mighty_The_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:36:13 2015 UTC,"I think your right, but you aren't either. Its not going to be easy if you want it to be easy. Could it be easier? sure. But if you say are down on a planet and you have huge aggressive monsters that want to attack you, we even saw the sheep that did it, imagine a huge monster, not so easy to kill. Maybe you accidentally mine a special rock and the sentinals blow up your ship and you have to start with the base one again. Maybe you encounter space pirates that decide to blow you up.  I mean i could go on for the most likely situations of ship blown up do to some danger, stranded in solar system until you get more resources to buy another ship ect.  It'll be a real universe of, harder zones better rewards, horrible things can happen all the time if you aren't careful ect. But you can get the explorer ships that maybe have more fuel compared to a jet fighter so you can go further while the fighter can go quicker but at shorter distances. You will have options for ships, and guns, and some sure armor and other upgradeables so that you can make it easier to get out of danger or easier to get the resources needed to keep going or any other combination of things to make it easier on you. While the game can be easy or casual, that doesn't mean it will be all the time, i'm sure it'll be a cluster fuck at the middle of the galaxy like he said.  Coming from a sandbox perspective. It won't be easy, it won't be particularly super hard, but you'll have the choices to make it easier or to avoid danger just like you'll have the choices to make it harder and be better equipped to destroy the danger."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkcjo,GregoryGoose,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that you can play the game safe or dangerously. But the fact is that things will randomly attack you and the planets you land on just trying to save your game could be extremely hostile. You might only have a few minutes to get off the rock and you encounter something that keeps you from getting off in time. As you near the center of the galaxy the stakes will be higher, the dangers will be greater, and they will come at you from more angles."

To be honest, and a bit off topic, if you get a PS4 (Especially if you get one for NMS solely) you are better off getting the subscription.  The free monthly games make up the cost and get you a lot of stuff to play.  A shameless plug, but try to get it in July and get Rocket League while its free.  Cause its awesome."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3djuv3,chrissystardust,7,Thu Jul 16 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"They don't need to, but I imagine many will. If the 40-100 hour estimate is correct, it's in the same ballpark as the Witcher 3, which most played to completion before reviewing (even if they didn't do all the side stuff)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djuv3,DawnBlue,5,Thu Jul 16 21:30:34 2015 UTC,Did reviewers really play The Witcher 3 for up to 100 hours before reviewing it? That seems an awfully long time
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djuv3,chrissystardust,2,Thu Jul 16 22:42:48 2015 UTC,It's an awfully big game. Forbes' official review only just came out a few days ago.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3djuv3,DawnBlue,0,Thu Jul 16 23:10:38 2015 UTC,"2 monts? That's... nice. Was it that common though?  Forbes isn't exactly a gaming news website (personally I think some of the crap that one gaming dude over there says should get him fired). How long did it take for say GameSpot, Kotaku, (god forbid) IGN (""10/10 just the sex-on-horses game you need"") or whatever to review it?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djuv3,chrissystardust,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"They were more immediate, but they had advanced copies. Kotaku did 60 hours in 10 days, Gamespot and IGN's reviewers said they spent at least 100 hours on it."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djuv3,DawnBlue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:58:21 2015 UTC,"Nice to know they don't judge things too fast.  Side note, about the advance copies, it doesn't change that much if the game is only reviewed after a good 100+ hours. Well, unless they get it more than a week early :P Of course for any game that can be reviewed faster it provides them the opportunity to present a review at launch or even before"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3djuv3,JPSRose,2,Thu Jul 16 21:58:50 2015 UTC,I highly doubt reviewers played Fallout 3 or the Oblivion series to 100% completion before reviewing. No one pays a journalist to play 300 hours of gameplay lol.

The devs will have a build which they can easily manipulate to force various different species and situations to occur, and they can make sure that no bugs occur in those situations. Also, they can simply play it, after putting a few hours in, going out of there way to do things they believe could cause bugs, it will be quite easy to locate and iron out a lot of glitches. At then end of the day, when you're dealing with a game of this scope, you can guarantee a few bugs."

Another persons game builds that tree on that mountain the exact same way as the first. This is what the one universe means.  As for what it means for MP, look at Elite Dangerous. Elite Dangerous has one universe but it will only matches players in the same instance if the p2p connection between them is good enough for gameplay to not be affected. See also games like Journey, Dark Souls."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj7l4,Mighty_The_Man,2,Fri Jul 17 05:10:11 2015 UTC,"That is because what makes the universe is a mathematical algorithm. Based on your coordinates in the universe, it inputs that into the algorithm and outputs the tree, rock, mountain ect. So No matter what if a player is at a specific coordinate it will always show the exact same output for everyone who is at the coordinate.  This game isn't really multi-player from what sean said. He said its more like ""journey"" where you can't really interact with other players, you can shoot them, you can see them, but that's about it."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dif54,Poulpc,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Sean was talking about different types of ships and said that different ""classes"" would have upgrades as a fighter, trader or explorer base type. Bigger guns, bigger cargo, and cloaking respectively."

But if you look closely at some videos you can at least see a Trader class.  He mentions each class has a distinct look, and I'm pretty sure the VTOL ships in the various videos are ""Trader"" class ones.  And anything that looks remotely close to an X-Wing are ""Fighter"" class ships (along with all shown in that image). Â  I personally haven't noticed a 3rd stand-out-ish feature yet that would lead me to think ""Explorer"" class in any pics/videos.  Perhaps on purpose as to keep the mystery/surprise that they really want to do."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dif54,dustsurrounds,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:29:28 2015 UTC,Pretty sure literally nobody thinks that would be how it works. That's like saying that the fighter always shoots or the trader takes no damage.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,Level_100,9,Thu Jul 16 18:37:44 2015 UTC,The very first creature we see in the very first trailer is a shark (and some fish) that's pretty indistinguishable from one that you'd find on Earth.  So...yes.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,DarthGrabass,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:50 2015 UTC,Yeah most of the fish they have shown look very earth-like.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,tinybadger,5,Thu Jul 16 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind that they've only shown outer-rim planets.  They've stated several times that the outer rim is very nearly earth-norm.  They want to give you strange, but not very strange.  While the inner worlds are much, MUCH more strange.  They're truly alien.  That gives you time to transition from partially believable to unbelievable, without ever losing your belief in the realism. :)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,Linkdead404,3,Thu Jul 16 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"And a lot of the outer-rim creature templates are basically earth animals. So yeah, it's highly likely early on in the game.  I think even the very first video had some animals that looked very much like gazelles."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,vibribbon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:35:38 2015 UTC,They look almost exactly like gazelles with okapi markings.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,DarthGrabass,8,Fri Jul 17 06:07:00 2015 UTC,yeah but it'll look like this
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,SpaceShipRat,3,Thu Jul 16 18:44:12 2015 UTC,those eyes are going to give me nightmares
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,SDJ67,3,Thu Jul 16 20:22:25 2015 UTC,Aww I miss spore.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,vibribbon,5,Thu Jul 16 22:36:29 2015 UTC,"It's possible, unless they have an algorithm that eliminates that possibility.  Is it probable?  No."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,Linkdead404,2,Thu Jul 16 18:38:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, it is possible but, as others said, it's HIGHLY improbable to happen and if it does happen, it'll be on the outer planets."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,lightspot21,3,Thu Jul 16 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"It's not highly improbable when we've seen one in nearly every trailer, whether it's a shark, a fish, butterflies, antelope or whatever."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,DarthGrabass,2,Thu Jul 16 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry for not phrasing correctly, but I meant that it's highly improbable to see one almost exactly like its real-life counterpart"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,lightspot21,0,Thu Jul 16 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"None of those have really looked like their earth counterparts.  They're vaguely familiar...but not something I'd point at and go ""That's a real animal!"".  Also, these are the out rim worlds.  The worlds you start on."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,Linkdead404,3,Thu Jul 16 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm not going to bother posting side by side comparisons, but we can easily find nearly identical Earth counterparts to all of those. You're really going to tell me that the blue butterflies seen at the start of the E3 2014 gameplay trailer are only vaguely familiar to Earth butterflies? Or the shark example I gave above? Or the antelope in the Infinite Worlds trailer that look exactly like Tibetan Antelope? Or almost all of the fish we've seen?  And yes, those are likely all outer rim worlds, but the OP was asking if Earth creatures are possible, and the answer is, yes, we've seen them."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,DarthGrabass,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"Out of all the videos I've watched, I've not yet seen a single creature I could point to and say ""that's real"".  None of them look real.  They all look possible, or some forms of possible, but none of them look like they exist on earth, right now.  And that's what the OP was asking about.  And no, the fish don't look like earth fish.  They look like fish, yes, and are easily spotted as ""swimming in the water"", but they don't look like actual fish you find on earth."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,Linkdead404,3,Thu Jul 16 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"Now I think you must be arguing about stylized computer graphics vs. real life, because all those animals I mentioned are indistinguishable representations of their Earth counterparts.  Nothing looks ""real."" It's a highly stylized video game, not a documentary film."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,DarthGrabass,-4,Thu Jul 16 19:38:03 2015 UTC,"No, the colors are off, the shapes are slightly off...they just look /different/ in a way that is fundamentally different to how the counterparts look in real life."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj8kw,Linkdead404,3,Thu Jul 16 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're really going to make me post pictures of butterflies? There is absolutely nothing fundamentally different about these butterflies vs. the butterflies seen in the E3 2014 trailer.  I can't believe we're having this argument. I still feel like you think the question is, ""Will we see a photorealistic shark that looks exactly like it was shot on HD video?""     EDIT: Here's a bonus example. I googled ""blue tropical fish"" and the very first image that shows up is literally identical to the very first fish we see in the very first trailer."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmdrs,Fractal_Curve,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the ""players being difficult to identify"", sorry if it was confusing.  I mean you will never have to think twice when on a planet, everyone you see is always a player since there are no NPCs. You can also probably pretty easily tell a player ship from an A.I. ship.  So why would players be difficult to identify?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmdrs,DawnBlue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:11 2015 UTC,Because that's what the developers are going for... I was answering the OP's question on whether or not there might be voice chat and giving my reasoning behind it.   I'm baffled that I have to explain this...
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmdrs,Fractal_Curve,0,Fri Jul 17 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"I hope you are not downvoting me for trying to explain myself...?  You don't have to explain anything, could you provide me source instead? I don't believe I've seen that sort of info anywhere.  These are from the information archive:   If you do see another player, then there won't currently be any indication that it's another player rather than just another AI.  The player character looks different than anything else you'll see.   There is nothing anywhere indicating the ""developers are going for"" having player characters be difficult to tell from A.I. Obviously without an indicator a straight-flying ship could be either, but like I said before an erratic pattern may be a sign."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmdrs,darkautumnhour,3,Fri Jul 17 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"I doubt there will be any real chat or voice option in the game. We can leave messages for other players, but it won't be a ""Chat Box"" type mechanic. In the interviews Sean says as yet alludes to playing with friends, but probably means if you have some other way of communicating with them (Steam voice chat, whatever PSN does, Skype, etc)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmdrs,ramsay101,3,Fri Jul 17 13:37:39 2015 UTC,"PSN's got a party chart the drops audio on top of the game, usually better quality then in game chat so, yeah, you could have an 8 person party while playing NMS on PS4, but, that would REALLY kill the immersion"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmdrs,darkautumnhour,2,Fri Jul 17 13:47:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The ambiance and sounds seem almost as important as the visuals for this game. Having any type of chat box popping up or someone you don't know entering your game lobby and blasting music through voice chat would break what the game is going for.  Â   Sean also mentioned the 'messages' left for other players would be more global than local. Can imagine a ""discovery journal"" type mechanic where, when you name a planet/animal, you enter some details or messages to other players about it. Somehow this information is retrievable from the Atlas either anywhere you are or when in a certain region by the planet where the notes were left."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmdrs,Gary2277,2,Fri Jul 17 14:19:38 2015 UTC,"He's the feature I would be crazy about. After you upload a discovery to Atlas, you can go online and enter ""Field notes"" or something of the like to accompany your discovery. It could be a super simple form, maybe a screen cap, a caption, and a little notes box where you can enter in your observations of the planet or creature.  I know many people would probably just 'jaden smith' the whole project, else insert disturbing erotica, but for the few of us who want to go deeper, it would be cool seeing another players discovery, along with their field notes and screen caps in game, before entering the atmosphere. It would be like player-generated lore in a way.  That being said, I think a lot of the other NMS subs will fill this role, so I'm not too wanton for such a feature in0game. Still...."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dmdrs,Spode87,3,Fri Jul 17 15:19:06 2015 UTC,I have thought about this as a concept.  It would be amazing in any open-world online game to be able to hear a player when they come within a certain radius of you.

I seriously doubt he's seen all those Dune covers, at best he's probably seen two or three of them.  Aside from which, like 90% of them feature sandworms and hello games isn't producing ""No Man's Sandworm"".  If you want to see influences, go look up the artwork of Chris Foss, Ralph McQuarrie, Vincent Di Fate and Boris Vallejo.  It doesn't stop there either, there are many others besides.  Just look up 70's sci-fi art on google and you'll find plenty."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dkzhh,Jakeyb0b,7,Fri Jul 17 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the extent to which Sean has talked about it:   Creating A New Periodic Table I wanted us to use the Earth's periodic table, and I thought that would be quite cool. I thought we'd teach people about science. It turns out people don't know chemistry that well. And it is no help to them. You're like, ""What are you trying to do combining those two elements? They will never go together."" They're just like, âEh.â   It's a shame, but whatever way we teach people in school there are certain things that are a total turn-off even though they can be intellectual sci-fi and stuff like that. It's amazing to me that you can have somebody super into sci-fi but school has managed to turn them off actual science.  It's like they're back in the schoolroom again and they're like, âBleh.â   What things can we make? We think about molecules and think about crystalline structures and stuff like that and then they're just like, âEh, sounds boring.â  And you just switch it, you change the names, and suddenly it's cool. So there's that element to it.  But also we just wanted to be a bit freer. There's only something like seven different compounds or something like that that we create really good types of liquids that you could have creatures survive in. And we might want more than that for the game. We might want to decide our own rules and you just get tied up into too many conversations about it and things like that. Sometimes gameplay and science don't sync together. That sort of a shame but I think for the best.  Grant [Duncan, art director] and I had such a battle over this, these planets have green skies. And there's no such thing. You see it in sci-fi all the time. Light is defracted by the chemical compound. The things that can form an atmosphere - there's only a certain number of them and they defract light differently. And none of them will ever produce green.   We have our own periodic table. We had it so you can see it in the game. It's a button you can press it pops up and it tells you a little bit of info about the planet. It tells you the chemical compounds. So when you come out of water, it will pop in and say what type of area you are in. And when you go underneath the water it tells you. And when you're in space it tells you.  So that's your little read out. It comes up automatically. Then you think, âI could survive in that.â   Because Grant wanted green skies I ended up adding this thing that was like âunknown air detected.â I was like, âWhat are we doing? We brought the magic green sky. Green sky component detected. Where have we gone to?â   But it's true. You have it in sci-fi all the time. Neil deGrasse Tyson likes pointing out things all the time about films and stuff that aren't real. He said like the Daily Show globe spins the wrong way.  But I was watching Cosmos and Titan in the pre-rendered stuff had a green sky. It's a me thing. I think everyone just goes, âThe sky can be green. Whatever.â    via Game Informer"

The major selling point of this game is exploring procedurally generated worlds, which unless NMS manages to completely revolutionize PG content won't be much different than exploring a new Minecraft seed in space with better graphics and Spore-like generated creatures.   NMS is a niche game, which is perfectly fine. It shouldn't try to appeal to everyone because if it did it would lose what makes it special. You can't make your friend like NMS, and he's no less of a friend for not being amazed by it the way you are. You would be less of a friend for belittling them for not seeing things your way."

Plus that scene where he's walking out of the cave and the giant winged beasts are creating shadows on the surface?! Chills. And that big snake thing! With the ruins of...something around it. There's definitely clues/pieces about something going on in the background here. Not necessarily a narrative bit something that will be completely pieced together only when reaching the center. And I wouldn't be surprised if the ""ending"" or whatever is at the center is procedurally generated and not the same for everyone. Maybe all that you've seen/discovered on your own are variables put into the equation so everyone gets their own special surprise in the center and no two are the same. Man.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,DarthGrabass,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"Math is just a fancy term. We really gotta be thankful to wonderful programming and the artist. They initially create and define the rules that lead to beauty. The artist was the one that curated the colors and so on, the math simply stretches it across an entire galaxy with all possible variants that artists couldn't do by hand."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,Aerial_1,2,Thu Jul 16 00:05:17 2015 UTC,But aren't planets one biome each? So what would be the good of exploring it thoroughly?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,Asekoth,22,Wed Jul 15 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"Well keep in mind that just because it's the same biome, doesn't mean the planet is the same 12 mile repeated all over the planet. For all we know, there could be waterfalls other natural wonders to find. It'd be like stepping foot into the Amazon and saying ""I guess I've explored the Amazon"" just because it's the same biome. This is not to mention caves to explore, or new animals that are found in various places on the planet. If there's a planet interesting enough, I could see spending hours and hours there."

Could one person explore multiple solar systems easily by portaling back and forth between them?  Would this be limited by how costy it is to buy a new ship in every system? (confirmed before that you can't take your ship with you through the portals) Or can you go back through the portal and still use the old ship you left behind...?  At the very least, if they are 2-way doorways, you can explore a bunch of Planets - at least one per portal"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,DawnBlue,2,Wed Jul 15 19:21:21 2015 UTC,They are 2-way because you can't bring your ship or obtain a new one on the other side so you have to go back through to get in your ship and continue your journey. They are essentially just an opportunity to gain more valuable resources and upgrades but they don't allow you to leap frog into a new region of the galaxy and continue on your journey.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,teaminus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"I thought they were a one-way deal that jumped you much further toward the centre, kind of like a level warp.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,vibribbon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"Here's what has been said...  From the Information Archive:   There'll be portals to different random planets closer to the centre of the galaxy, in rare alien temples that you can discover. The one they saw had a central spire surrounded by a ring of portals to different places with two giant flying snakes circling above. Each portal requires a different weapon or combination of weapons to open. Can't take ship with, so need to gather what you can on other side and go back through the portal. (Game Informer January 2015 Edition)   Here is the page from GI that talks about Portals. I believe he also talked about them in the PSX interview and/or the GI videos.  From the FAQ   How do we acquire new ships? You can acquire a new ship at a space station, which are effectively ""showrooms"" for a lot of ships. New ships will come and go as they dock at the station, and you'll be able to check them out and purchase them."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,teaminus,2,Wed Jul 15 22:28:00 2015 UTC,Ah very good thanks.  So it'll be more like extended bonus dungeon mission time on the planet.  Sounds cool.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,teaminus,4,Wed Jul 15 22:44:07 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this one.  While it wasn't anything we on this sub didn't already know, like a lot of us I enjoy watching Sean just talk about his inspirations for the game and his opinions on the state of current games.     He's bang on about games nowadays just holding your hand and we as gamers just sort of switch off our brains and follow the predetermined tracks.   I think it's probably how most of us on this sub feel, especially those of us over 30-ish who grew up in the Amiga/Spectrum era, so it's really exciting to have this amazing game sort of tailored for us, by one of us really :)  Bit sentimental I guess, but it does feel good :D  EDIT:  Also, I know we're all clambering for more footage and more info, but honestly I absolutely love that they're keeping most of it secret.  It's going to be amazing loading this game up for the first time and, for once, honestly not knowing exactly what to expect.   I love how they're going about this, it's so rare nowadays."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3de6mp,victory0901,5,Wed Jul 15 22:50:31 2015 UTC,I wonder if they couldn't give it out at E3 because of a contract with IGN first to have the rights to release that info during this coverage.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj1tz,EEKman,8,Thu Jul 16 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"Good observation, but I think that was a series of events that made it seem like the sentinel is rogue when it actually wasn't.  First he shot the rock, which caused nearby Walkers to approach him, so he backed off into the water (which activated his first wanted level). The water didn't reset his wanted level, but the Walkers couldn't chase him, and the flying sentinels couldn't find him (or shoot him) since he was submerged.   Because he was still wanted when he emerged from the water and approached the beacon, a sentinel spots him and shoots at him, and he shoots it.   We've seen that killing sentinels won't immediately raise your wanted level before; in the 18 minute gameplay video Sean kills a bunch of sentinels, but there was a point where it took 2 - 3 killed sentinels to raise his wanted level one point higher.   I think Sean would have had to kill a few more sentinels/creatures to get his wanted level higher at that point.   Finally, he uploads his discoveries to the beacon, which removes his wanted level."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj1tz,MHasho,6,Thu Jul 16 18:29:16 2015 UTC,Interesting. They probably have procedural behaviors that determine their agro range/triggers

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj1tz,Spike92,2,Thu Jul 16 20:55:14 2015 UTC,It's also possible they made it happen just for show for the E3 build. It's also possible I may be wrong.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj1tz,Mpax4059,2,Thu Jul 16 18:28:34 2015 UTC,Anyone else remember Sean saying at some point the Sentinels were a bit out of line? I think I do.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj1tz,Jakami,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:47:12 2015 UTC,I thought it was because he was just mining something and he saw something.  But yeah he probably should have got a warning level if that's the case. Â  A good observation but honestly I'd probably chuck it up to being a dev/test build more than anything.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3djwaf,posthamster,3,Thu Jul 16 21:31:21 2015 UTC,"Considering NMS has a whole lot of colour theory going on, I think this type of thing could be an amazing addition to it after release.  I'm not necessarily talking about the crazy flashing effects like in the video on the link.  More like your room taking on the same colours as the ambient lighting around you when you visit a planet.  Fading out at night time.  ...Maybe some crazy flashing during space battles - depending on what's going on.  Another thought that occurred to me is if the game is able to know the locations of the Hue lights in your room, and you're near a star, it could potentially ""move"" a bright area around you as you rotate your ship.  I don't know how difficult it would be to get NMS to talk to the Hue bridge, although there is an API for it.  No, I don't have any Hue gear. But I would get some for this."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djwaf,grgisme,4,Thu Jul 16 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"Fun idea. I've got 6 Hue recessed lights in my media room, where I'll be playing the game via PC and an Xbox 360 controller on a projector w/ surround sound. This could make it fun and atmospheric."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ty,victory0901,8,Fri Jul 17 04:39:21 2015 UTC,Probably because not unlike our own universe there is no center... science ;)
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ty,craftitall,5,Fri Jul 17 05:28:53 2015 UTC,"how do you travel to other galaxies?   We don't know for sure, but what I think is in the centre of the galaxy is a way to travel to other galaxies.    why isn't the goal to get to the center of the universe?   If you want to make that your goal, you're most welcome to. There is no set path in this game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ty,secret_online,5,Fri Jul 17 04:45:17 2015 UTC,"Also, why isn't the goal to get to the center of the universe?    Finding it might prove a tad difficult. The real universe doesn't have a center, so to speak, don't know if No Man's Sky's universe will have one. Not to mention the sheer, unfathomable size of the universe in NMS might be a little daunting. Assumptions follow:  At ~2 quintillion stars in the universe, at around 300 billion stars per galaxy, give or take. 40-100 hours to travel the radius of a galaxy...  You're looking at around 500 million hours to reach the center of the universe, starting from the edge.   That might be why."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ty,NickJosue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:32:00 2015 UTC,"That's assuming linear progression. By the time we reach the center we may have FTL drives that can hop multiple galaxies in a single warp, mine planets for fuel from orbit... Who really knows."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ty,PearElite,2,Fri Jul 17 05:26:01 2015 UTC,"Don't feel stupid. They've talked about how originally they called the star field a universe, but now they call it a galaxy.  From all explanations the entire map he's shown that has a center is a galaxy. There's no boundaries and you could truly fly from one star system to another. However, you can't do that for different galaxies (that we know of). From all they've said, getting to another galaxy (another immense star map) must be done by some other means.  It's only been mentioned once or twice that there's more than one ""galaxy"". So it's not surprising you haven't heard it."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dl9ty,Murrdogg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:28:17 2015 UTC,"I imagine that once you get to the center of the galaxy you can teleport to a new galaxy that is even stranger and more dangerous, and you can learn to adapt to that one and continue to the center of it, or perhaps use your better technologies to go back to your starter galaxy and wreak havoc upon unsuspecting stations. I think that it could generally be assumed that the more galaxies you traverse the closer you get to the center of the universe, (or edge, who knows) but I doubt there is an ultimate center. That would be expecting too much. Even if you picked up a warp drive that let you do each galaxy in 10 minutes we are talking about a lifetime of gameplay."

I, however, after having looked at more stuff, think he may have been calculating the size of a moon, and his calculations were not exactly precise, so the moon could have been larger than that (though not waaaay larger than that). They've shown some planets since then that seem much bigger."

It takes like, what, 3-4 hours to walk across skyrim? About 90 minutes to walk across Velen/Novigrad in The Witcher 3? I've never actually done it in either game so those are just estimates, but no developer would have planets even 10x that size and then claim that it would take ""weeks and weeks"" to walk across it."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,shogunno1,8,Thu Jul 16 06:31:01 2015 UTC,GiantBomb had an interview where they asked about max depth and Sean said 128 meters. I was hoping to dig to the core of the earth and get crushed/incinerated at least once but I'll live.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,Curratum,3,Thu Jul 16 08:50:29 2015 UTC,"Great scale demonstration.  128meters = over 400 feet.  Thats quite a lot of cave systems to dig through, or water to swim through.  Just some facts (From Wikipedia) to mull over::::  Deep diving has different meanings depending on the context. Even in recreational diving the meaning may vary:  In recreational diving, a depth below about 30 metres (98 ft), where nitrogen narcosis becomes a significant hazard for most divers, may be considered a ""deep dive""     in recreational diving certification agencies, Deep diving, or Deep diver may be a certification awarded to divers that have been trained to dive to a specified depth range, generally deeper than 30 metres (98 ft).     The Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) defines anything from 18 metres (60 ft) to 30 metres (100 ft) as a ""deep dive"" (other diving organisations vary), and considers deep diving a form of technical diving.[1] It is defined by the level of the diver's diver training, diving equipment, breathing gas, and surface support: In technical diving, a depth below about 60 metres (200 ft) where hypoxic breathing gas becomes necessary to avoid oxygen toxicity may be considered a ""deep dive"". In professional diving, a depth that requires special equipment, procedures, or advanced training is a deep dive."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,icyflamez96,2,Thu Jul 16 05:53:48 2015 UTC,Is it also maximum depth of oceans? I hope not.  Edit: Or maybe it's deep enough to feel like there is too much space between you and the bottom of the ocean? idk. :P
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,exocube,2,Thu Jul 16 06:56:27 2015 UTC,"Considering that free divers regularly go beyond that depth while holding their breath, if that is the limit for oceans that's very underwhelming.   Not saying it's not deep, because it is, but if a guy in a space suit can't get as deep as a dude who holds his breath then the space suit must be pretty naff, just saying."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,droznig,4,Thu Jul 16 09:10:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair space suits are designed to compensate for lack of pressure, not the other way."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,flaques,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:23:44 2015 UTC,This probably isn't the limit for natural things such as caves and oceans. Rather when you go past that limit you wouldn't be able to dig any further.  We'll see in the future.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,TheSeaOfThySoul,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:51:36 2015 UTC,"so it looks like it is 128 metres, which is still quite far (going to be lots of fun digging around) but this is one of those things i hope they change over time (if it's possible in the code without too much work), as adding in stuff like digging to 500-1000 metres (maybe doesnt need to be quite that far) sounds like there could be added a lot of risk/reward into it by adding a higher chance of better resources down there, but a higher chance of more dangerous creatures/cave ins/lava/etc."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,piiees,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:30:52 2015 UTC,So the oceans will not be deeper than 128 meters? I doubt that... Digging landmass ok. But I hope real oceans will be deeper!
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dh2z9,philley84,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"128m is A LOT. For instance, Minecraft's caves are only ~32m, if we take 2 blocks as 1 meter and say that surface is at 64 blocks. Oceans still look very, very deep in Minecraft and caves are pretty big and tricky too. It's nothing that can be compared to real world, but don't forget that planets are much smaller in NMS."

Probably the only game I've ever bought where I spent as much time reading text off my tv screen as playing the game, lol.  I really liked Spore too. I can see why so many people complained about the space stage; it had major issues.

It has such a massive open world (270 square km) that you can run around in with no invisible walls like in most MMOs.

It's actually very similar to NMS in a lot of ways, and is probably the game they would have made back then given the technological limitations of the time. The whole universe was procedurally generated and you could upload discovered planets to a master database which you could manually sync with everyone else's. Big stuff in 2002.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,Starbrow,9,Wed Jul 15 23:17:22 2015 UTC,"A lot of this gets really hard to calculate because of the fact that you will be able to see your friends in the galaxy map, so it's not just random chance. People with more friends, and more desire to find other players, will probably go out of their way to do so. While others, like myself, won't really bother with other players.  I could imagine a lot of people will be adding each other as friends just for the sake of trying to find someone nearby."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,CurseHawking,6,Wed Jul 15 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"It is true that any behaviour that introduces correlation between the paths of separate players will work to increase the probability of overlap. For instance, the draw that the centre of the galaxy is likely to provide will mean that the odds of bumping into a previously explored planet near the ""core"" is going to be higher.   That said, the numbers are still astronomical (okay, pun intended). If the core region contains 4*107 planets (0.01% of the galaxy total) out of which 100,000 get visited and you visit 500, you have a 72% chance of finding one planet that someone else has been to.  If you purposely go for somewhere that your friends are, of course the odds are 100% :)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,FrostyXylophone,2,Wed Jul 15 23:45:54 2015 UTC,I'm just curious because I hadn't seen it confirmed anywhere... We'll be able to see our friends on the galaxy map?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,CurseHawking,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:27:32 2015 UTC,"It's in the info archive under the gameplay section, confirmed by Game Informer."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,Petal_Chatoyance,4,Thu Jul 16 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"I would think that the probability of visiting a previously discovered planet becomes 100% if a player deliberately chooses to travel to a marked, identified 'Discovered' planet in the galactic map.    The question for me then becomes ""what will be the average number of warp jumps between any two beginning players within the starting galaxy?""    Is that even a question that can be approached? I lack the math skills, but it seems to me that if we knew the number of stars in the starting galaxy, and we postulated a number of players, and we assumed a random distribution of starting points along the rim... maybe, just maybe, an approximation might be made of the number of jumps between starting players.    Obviously, the closer to the center, the fewer jumps needed, but I am curious about the worst-case scenario."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,Petal_Chatoyance,3,Thu Jul 16 00:28:31 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be particularly difficult to calculate, but you'd need to know the maximum range of a jump. A rough approximation would be to treat the galaxy as flat and then assuming a random distribution of players in this plane. This would lead to the average distance between two players of:  d = sqrt{(Area of galaxy)/(#of players)}  The number of jumps is then this distance divided by the maximum jump length. The Milkyway is 100,000 light years across, so with a million players that would put people about 90 light years apart. The average distance between stars in the Milkyway is about 5 light years, so if we just assume that's about the distance that you can jump, then we will start about 18 jumps from each other."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,Kelvets,2,Thu Jul 16 01:04:42 2015 UTC,"18 jumps is within reason. This means that two players who are determined to meet, or to visit each other's discovered worlds, could reasonably do so.    Assuming that it is true that the worlds discovered by others are visible or marked on the galactic map, it seems much more likely to me now that our discoveries can be visited by others. It also makes it much more believable to hope to experience encountering another player in general.     Thank you, that was an excellent and helpful bit of work!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,J_a_y_c_e,3,Thu Jul 16 03:52:07 2015 UTC,"I just want to add that I think one million planets is a (hopefully vast) underestimate. If one million people play the game and they each visit 1000 planets in the first galaxy, that's 109 planets explored. If you also visit 1000 planets, the odds of stumbling upon someone else's discovery becomes about 92%.  It will indeed be a pretty lonely place."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,darkautumnhour,2,Wed Jul 15 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"You really think the average player will visit 1000 planets? The vast majority will quit way before that... with each planet being huge, and hyperdrive fuel limited (meaning they'll have to actually walk around the planet getting resources to buy said fuel), only the most dedicated players will visit 1000 planets in their game life!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,Linkdead404,2,Thu Jul 16 00:34:13 2015 UTC,"Probably not, I was just playing around with the numbers. If you reduce the estimate to 100 planets, the probability goes down, but not by super much! 108 planets explored and if you visit 100 too, then the probability that you see one overlap in those 100 planets is 39%.  As others have pointed out though, patterns of stars and correlations in behaviour will most likely increase the odds too."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,Kelvets,3,Thu Jul 16 00:52:21 2015 UTC,"Interesting maths but of course a few variables are unknown which can make a massive difference. How many people are going to play, how many planets they are going to visit and how many planets are in the galaxy (compared to the universe."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,Atarico,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:54:50 2015 UTC,"More than that: it's a moving target. there's no t in this equation. As time moves in the game more players are filtering in and out of the galaxy. Assuming the all start in different places, taking random paths towards the center, you yourself trying to max planet visitations (1000 planets is probably possible in 33.33 hours visiting 30 planets an hour (one every two minutes, which may not be feasible based on the upgrades you need to get from system to system)). All this to say that if you play this game all of year 1, every day you play your chances of finding a planet someone has discovered increase. I don't have the maths to calculate how they would increase, however."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,asimovwouldlike,2,Thu Jul 16 13:20:56 2015 UTC,"Also, bear in mind that stars are less dense on the outskirts, so much farther apart.  But as you get closer and closer to the center of the galaxy, paths will start to converge a lot more.  Depending on the number of players, it could lead to more meetings way close to the center of the galaxy."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,NMS_explorer,2,Wed Jul 15 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"While I agree that warp range is a factor, I guess one thing that could potentially force more convergence is if you get ""voids"" near densely populated areas, forcing people through a bottleneck of systems in order to get from one area to the next. Planets located in such systems would indeed be much more likely to see player visits than a dead-end system on the edge of the galaxy."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,SpeedyVT,2,Wed Jul 15 23:50:51 2015 UTC,"Now, before we all get super depressed, we should remember that we all start in the same galaxy, so we can vastly reduce the number of stars to about 200 billion and calculate the property of a planet being visited twice in one million planets visited in the same galaxy   It appears you're couting 1 star = 1 planet, but I think each star is a solar system, meaning each star can have many planets. Fuck."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,shaun056,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:29:18 2015 UTC,"yeah but most likely a player will visit every planet on the solar system before leaving it (at least that's what i'll try to do) so counting 1 star = 1 planet isn't ""wrong"" since chances are if you go to a star system that has been visited you will also visit the planet."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfwak,SteroyJenkins,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, to make things easier I just counted them as the same thing. The seed is used to generate planets and therefore they are the limiting factor. With some systems having more than one planet, the total number of stars is bound to be smaller."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,bigrigdom,3,Thu Jul 16 18:25:19 2015 UTC,This game has over 2.5 billion planets per living human being. I doubt you are ever going to find such a thing.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,Ratelslangen2,3,Thu Jul 16 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"No. First, it doesn't go well with the philosophy of this game. Second, it wouldn't work: how can you find a planet among 18 quintillion? The chances of anyone finding said planet would be billions of times lower than the average chance of winning real-life lottery. ""This is now the 67th week in a row that no one won the lottery prize!"". It would simply be too boring."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,Kelvets,3,Thu Jul 16 20:56:25 2015 UTC,"I think HG should capitalize on this subreddit and take whatever wins ""the coolest creature of the week"" and manufacture it into a plush that way they can still make some revenue while were all doing this.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,Nomanski,9,Fri Jul 17 15:22:39 2015 UTC,"If  you  need  an  external  incentive to explore, then NMS  probably isn't the game for you."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,darkautumnhour,6,Thu Jul 16 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"Shots fired. Lol.   Although I'm getting a bit tired of this cliche. I've heard it on so many podcasts now that ""if you want to [blank] no mans sky isn't for you"". Clearly everyone wants something a little different out of NMS, there's no reason to keep telling people that they're the wrong kind of person to enjoy a game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,Nomanski,6,Thu Jul 16 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"Still,  I'm  absolutely amazed  at  how many  posts  I  see here  saying things  like   - ""Are there  going to be  fire  trucks  in this  game?  There have to be  fire trucks!  We  should  all  write HG   and  tell  them  to  put  fire  trucks  in  the game.""  - ""Can  I  conquer a space  station and  rule  it as a  dictator?    We  have to be  able to  conquer and  rule the  space  stations!""  - ""Can  I  knock a  planet out  of  orbit?""  (Posted  here  earlier  today.)  If  you  want a game that has  something that  NMS  doesn't have,  then  maybe  you  don't want to play  NMS.  That  isn't  criticism,  it's  just  common sense."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,darkautumnhour,2,Thu Jul 16 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"Well constructed argument, to be sure. However, as a counterpoint, when you tell people they're getting a infinite universe, you open up the pandora's box of speculation.  ""Infinite? So I'll be able to find my grandma's house?""  ""How many planets will have a TARDIS on them?""  ""What if there's a planet that's entirely spiders?"" (okay, I'll take credit for that one).  To be fair though, all these things seem possible based on what we know. 264 is a whole lot of variation, and really encourages our minds to wander. It's also not hard to see that the demos have been EXTREMELY rudimentary about game play. We have seen a lick of peak-game content, let alone end game content. It's easy to imagine NMS used as a platform for all sorts of things.  That being said. I sincerely doubt HG would ever run a contest like this. Much more likely they would run a fan-art contest. Or a ""video of the day"" for youtubers."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,agnl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"What? Not at all. Even though it's practically infinite its not literally infinite. There isn't an unending number of possibility and the variation is still limited to (a) the code and (b) the assets that go in the game. Just because it's procedural doesn't mean anything can happen, it just means that stuff is created from a set of basic assets: 3D models, textures, sounds, etc. But you still have to put content in to get content out. The computer doesn't just magically create the tardis or your grandma's house."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,darkautumnhour,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:34:45 2015 UTC,"I understand this, but the way the game has been presented doesn't make this abundantly clear. Think of the E32015 stage demo: Sean showing the intense galactic map, picking one at random, ""just so you know, if something goes wrong, I've never been here before."" Like, what? The games designer doesn't know what's in the game. uhh... I guess anything's possible.  This isn't true, but it's how the logic flows in these ""Do you think...?"" posts."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,Dizman7,4,Fri Jul 17 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"That would imply they know where the planets are, what their names are,  what creatures are on them, etc.  The entire game is procedurally built, they are nearly as clueless as the rest of us as to what is on the 18 quintillion planets."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,KPipes,0,Thu Jul 16 21:53:08 2015 UTC,"Procedural yes. Random no.   They could easily and randomly pick a point in the galaxy (universe) and have their engine tell them what's there (i.e. name of closest planet or solar system, etc.) based on the procedural generation algorithms. Procedural means it's the same thing in the same point in space at all times. Names, places, etc. They could easily randomly pick a place and tell us all kinds of things about it.

There would be specific places where HG, with their godly rule over the universe, plant messages for players to find, and whoever finds them first gets the prize.  Of course finding something in a specific spot on single planet is already quite rare, let alone in an entire universe of 18 quintillion planets..."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,darkautumnhour,0,Fri Jul 17 07:07:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe after some time. When the game is released I'm sure it will be radio silence from HG for a while, while media outlets do the work for them, they'll pretty much be writing any patches necessary.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,CannabisPrime2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that sounds like a lot of fun but given the size of the universe, it would have to be something pretty generic or you'd have folks flying around looking for something that might be on the other side of the galaxy."

Everything that is generated at any point (place, name, etc.) is done so through consistent algorithms. It will output the exact same thing every time. I guarantee you HG can pick a point in the universe and know exactly what the planet name, solar system name or anything else is there. It's not random."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj6uk,DawnBlue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"You forget that the universe is the same every single time. Although the assets don't exist until a player goes to a place and they are generated, the are universal with the numbers that generate them.  If HG did this - and I'm not saying this is remotely a good idea - they could indeed just go to a random planet / system anywhere in the universe and see what's there, then be like ""Hey guys, if you find this place here, you get loots!""."

To a degree- I know that the rules of the universe were changed to bring things closer together and there are no gas giants. Still, earth and our moon are a bit of a rarity it seems. I often think that the vastness of space may be a direct visualization of exactly how improbable we really are."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dlcyt,GregoryGoose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:55:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's the point of the game. And Sean said that when you reach the center some things become more valuable to you and there is reason to continue the gameplay after that. I'm really curious what that might mean, that's why I'm crazy about this game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dlcyt,KubeQ11,2,Fri Jul 17 06:03:54 2015 UTC,"Couple things: Where you start int the game, on the outskirts, things are deliberately more earth-like and relatable. As you approach the center is gets weirder. So we go from stuff that looks like trees and goats and birds to floating orbs, slugbeasts and firedactyls... and the next planet is earth? Earth is on the outskirts of the milky way, which is more of a barred spiral galaxy, and the galaxy in NMS appears to be a globular cluster.    The next problem is that with procedural generation they cant really control what the planets are going to do at any specific point. I suppose they can put an asset at a specific point in the universe, something modeled like the Atlas. But a planet is too big and complex to treat that way. I could be wrong, but I think that it would be difficult to implement what you're suggesting."

If you have a musical background at all, you hear bits and pieces that are similar all the time."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3djxig,Linkdead404,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but a lot of pop music continues to push forward, as well as other forms of music, at this point we're at a stage where there is a large enough pool of music that unintentionally a track can be made that sounds like something else without the creator of the new track knowing of the soundalike. This is going to happen whether it's purposeful or not.  Speaking of trends, it's always interesting to see what is happening overseas, a lot of producers will often test the waters before bringing what they know back to their own country, and it's bigger now than ever. As an avid K-Pop listener I'd point to something like ""Red Light"" by f(x) as an example of creating a unique production, you can hear the stylistic influences and such but you can also hear the producers pushing the boundaries.  It's a little harder to advance these days because not many people are willing to take risks, but it's still happening, it just might not be obvious."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj045,DawnBlue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"Kind of why I wouldn't call Destiny an MMO either.  Â   Anyways, just in case you didn't find the information yet: it actually works just like an MMO.  Every place is exactly the same for everyone, but you have many instances of every place. They also said the number of players allowed per instance is low.  Â   Actually a comparison to Destiny is good here: even in ""social"" spaces, that game has a limit of 16 players / instance. (Let's not discuss the fact that it mostly puts me into almost, if not completely, empty instances of the areas) Whatever the number is in No Man's Sky, you can't control which instance you enter - not even to play with your friends - so the game is very antisocial in that way."

And the worrying thing to me is that people are saying that it's like Elite: Dangerous lobbies, which from I have seen, are just servers, like in any other game. And if you were to randomly be in the same place as another player, would they be in your lobby, or is there a chance that they will be in a different lobby, and you would never know that you both were in the same place?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dj045,DawnBlue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:00 2015 UTC,"Well... in most MMOs you are automatically placed in the lowest number instance (1, 2, 3 etc.) until it's filled up.  I think (because I can't recall them 100% confirming it) that No Man's Sky will do something similar - it's only gonna place people in separate instances of the same general area if there are too many in that place."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dedtj,SlyHackr,2,Wed Jul 15 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"In an early interview he said that ships could not go underwater, that the just crash/blow-up when you try.  In a different interview he mentions trying to get to a ""point of interest"" his scan picked up that was deep underwater.  He went down and down that it got super dark, but he said his suit was not upgraded enough so he ran out of air and droned, and that he never did figure out what the waypoint was leading him too. Â  I believe all those ships shown underwater in a couple vids were wreckage.  I remember at least one had a wing broken off. Â  I'm sure it's just more than the real-world reasoning, I'm sure there's some difficult programming one way or another with it.  I'd love to see it eventually added maybe though."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddp42,Werebaer,2,Wed Jul 15 14:02:39 2015 UTC,Your art is awesome. Do you have any suggestions on learning to sketch (videos or book recommendations). I find that I am decent at freehand. but coming up with something on a blank page is really intimidating.   Im 27 gave up trying to learn to draw in my early teens. But your art is really motivating me to pick it back up again for therapeutic reasons.   Would you say free hand drawing (edit- Copying) art and styles you like would help you develop into drawing your own art?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddp42,tinybadger,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"I'm quite intimidated by other artists, generally. All those character artists you see shared on Facebook and Deviant Art...how do they do it. Sometimes I try and emulate them, but it never works. Sometimes you just have to develop your own style, and have faith in it. I suffer quite a bit with depression, and I find that seriously effects how creative and confident I am. This why I have been spamming this sub with my Nms art, I've been really enjoying creating it, and brought back some of my confidence. I have been drawing for most of my life, and I guess my style has developed on its own. So I guess all I can advise you to do, is keep trying...first for yourself, use a theme like nms as reference, start doodling some creatures, or fish...start to mess about with them, like the seed would. That's what I did. Admittedly I have done a couple of dinosaur books in the past, so that helped with the poses etc. google image research is a must when drawing natural history/ or alien :) good luck!

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dk0tz,Linkdead404,3,Thu Jul 16 22:46:45 2015 UTC,I believe it's considered to be your escape pod.  Which is basically what you start in. :p
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dk0tz,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:11:36 2015 UTC,Escape pod/pod ship/first ship all the same. All procedural.

I'd really like to see that as well."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhay7,fnhernan3,2,Thu Jul 16 09:58:36 2015 UTC,"If you guys recall their Portal Gameplay video 7 months ago, there were some creatures that were somewhat bioluminescent in the night.   edit:/ Here's the video. https://youtu.be/WQhSP82uhY4"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhay7,formlessfish,2,Thu Jul 16 07:26:16 2015 UTC,"I have actually been wondering about creature behavior for quite some time. I am really hoping for nocturnal creatures since it woul add more diversity and act as an incentive to stay on a planet liger to see all of the the wildlife and get credit for it. I am also hoping animals have some form of nesting behavior, or a place they go to sleep or a general area they hang around and protect. Since someone confirmed that there are nocturnal animals I have hope for a few complex behaviors rather than aggressive or passive (Ie some animals are curious and follow, some are easily startled, maybe some are actually helpful and can be followed to important resources and hopefully some will stalk you )"

The character, his/her ship, the environment could be 'procedural'...or at least small changes would occur from one frame to another. The character would be a completely different person by the end of the comic...hopefully portraying everyone's different experience of NMS. I might see if I can get HG's blessing to maybe start a crowdfunder. Or am I getting carried away and should just be happy sharing with you guys...please tell it to me straight!"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddba4,Anderoth_Dreyar,2,Wed Jul 15 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"Protip: Wait 'til the game comes out before you start a comic. Have the main character travel to different planets, which would be based on notable places you visit while playing/places you see other people visit."

Maybe I'll put a single page up on this sub, about 5 or 6 frames...just to keep us entertained while we wait"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddba4,Hipolipolopigus,2,Wed Jul 15 11:41:38 2015 UTC,"Instead of making everything procedural, make a character and stick with it ( even if it is a four legged, tentacles for arms & gills on his upper torso creature). That'll give some sense of continuity to your work, can upgrade his suit/ship/multitool as you progress.  As for us not knowing what exactly might happen in the game, while that's true - I think we at least know how it begins. So, start off at a random planet with a basic ship & basic multitool.  And misadventures, well dont really need to be misadventures, can be something as silly as hmmm taking selfies everywhere (equivalent of taking screenshots i guess :P), coming across a crashed ship, swearing at the trading crystal found at tradeposts for giving us horrible rates!, running away from a monster, Jaden smith's philosophy affecting the protagonist deeply ;)  Just some random ideas, sorry if I went overboard, got excited and typed alot.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddba4,StrangeYoungMan,2,Wed Jul 15 11:43:13 2015 UTC,I think it is a great idea but after getting HGs blessing you may want to not start actual production until the game is out and have a better feel for what is typical player experience.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ded80,Dizman7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:56:09 2015 UTC,"Curious if you could go thru and then buy another ship.  Well, actually they said you only BUY ships at Space Stations......but do we know if you can CRAFT a ship yet? Â  Honestly guessing NO to all those questions and that these portals are just to give you a temporary glimpse at what's ahead, and maybe a change to gather some rarer/more valuable resources for a bit.  Basically something to tease you and motivate you get go further to the center."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ded80,Dizman7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"In one of the interviews Sean explains when your ship is destroyed the cockpit is a lifepod of sorts, and you have that to travel around the solar system you are in with but will need to buy a new ship in order to leave the system.  So you are not completely screwed if your ship is destroyed. Â  He also explained in a video if you saw a ship you liked at a trade port (only on planet surfaces) that you could follow it back to a Space Station and buy it from there if u wanted.  Saying space stations are ship showrooms, and any ship that docks there can be bought. Â  In the FAQs it lists the source but when Sean was asked if you could be stranded on a planet he said ""No, we'd count that as a bug"".  I think they want to avoid situations that force the player to walk long distances on a planet basically."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ded80,darkautumnhour,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:21:23 2015 UTC,"My guess is these set pieces tend to group together. These seem to be some of the ""ruins"" Sean talks about, and it's probably less likely to see a single one isolated out in a field then an orderly structure like this. procedural does NOT mean random."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ded80,grgisme,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Just re-watched the Portal trailer, and it's the same exact configuration. You can see the large portal behind the one they walk into, and other ruin structures in a circle around it.  Of course, and agreed. The GDC talk even discusses how they tag things (in this case probably ""Ruins"" and ""Portals""), and how the engine will create clusters/groupings of large and medium size objects in order to mimic standard environment design principals.  I was simply pondering on how likely the system is to group 10 portals together rather than 1 portal and 9 other ruins.  Whatever the case, this will be an incredibly exciting thing to happen upon."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ded80,darkautumnhour,2,Wed Jul 15 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally, I think the portals add a great element to this game and I'm surprised I haven't seen more discussion on it.  We know they portals on the outskirts of the galaxy lead to more internal planets, we would be able to go through with our ship, so we can't break the atmosphere after going through. But can we still make discoveries and upload to the Atlas? Basically, this would give a wild spice in the mix. Some of the fastest players might get near the center, and start happening upon planets discovered by casual outer-rimmers who spent enough time on one planet to find a portal, and enough time in the portal to make some discoveries. Endless possibilities.  Also, maybe portals can be networked. You might have gone through 5, or was it six, portals to get on some distant, caustic rock, and have to way to get back to your ship other than agroing setinals and respawning."

Some way to start another journey I think would be best, like a new galaxy.  This 'god hyperdrive' sort of thing might sound like it could start new journeys at first, but it also sounds dangerously similar to a fast travel system, that takes the fun of the journey out of exploration. Think about Elder Scrolls 4 and how the fast travel kind of diminished some quality of that game."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhmb7,lwg21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:55:43 2015 UTC,"Guys beforr me answered it perfectly.  Imagine that keeping just a few stats of all the minor details, for all the 18 quintillion planets... Just doing it by the groups (surface as a whole , animals as a whole, vegetation, weather) would multiply it by 4, now lets assume its for every tree, every animal, every inch or even larger area of a planet... Even if every hakf an hour tick or so...it would be insane, i cant even begin to think of the peocessing power it would require :O"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhmb7,eriongtk,2,Thu Jul 16 10:21:54 2015 UTC,"It might not necessarily cost much more processing power. Time related effects could be achieved by using time as an input for the game's algorithms (in addition to location). This is probably how the day/night cycles are already generated. However, having gradual changes (like continental drift or moving forests) is probably difficult to code (Sean mentioned in a few videos how challenging it is to control how objects are positioned with procedural generation).  But I agree with the above, minimal gain for a lot of work."

I'm looking at my CD copy of A Final Unity right now. I never did beat it...  I'll still play Spore every now and then in short spurts. It didn't have the lasting appeal I'd hoped for.  The best space-sim/space adventure game I've ever played is Freelancer. I've been trying for ages to find a game that gives me the sense exploration and all-around enjoyment that it did. I tried the X series and it didn't do it for me.   No Man's Sky is going to the one.

What if we were then, through this simulation,  able to be anywhere in the universe at anytime, and have it be exactly how it really is. We could see the surfaces of distant worlds, not as a telescope would view it's ancient photons, but how it exists at this second. We could just move the time slider and see the whole of human history play out before us, not how the books described it, but how it actually was."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,darkautumnhour,3,Thu Jul 16 02:20:50 2015 UTC,"A good post. Here's something you didn't really mention. Creationism. Many people believe there is a god, i personally don't but who cares what i believe. When you look at this game you can say a few things about life. For one, it doesn't take an artist (or a creator) to make beauty. The formula's No Mans Sky uses are much like our ""laws of physics"" in our own real universe. Laws that dictate what is possible, and then randomization creates beautiful, working ""art"".   You can also look at it and say, well, no mans sky wouldn't exist without a creator ""Sean Murray and his team"". Because yes nothing in no mans sky is really created, but someone had to create the code. So this begs the question, did someone create our laws of physics and just let nature create the rest?   This is why i think people like Neil Degrasse Tyson are actually into this game already. Even without evolution which totally helps, there can be beauty without design."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,Kelvets,2,Wed Jul 15 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"You raise a great point. Ever listen to Alan Watts? He was a philosopher who translated Eastern thought (Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.) for Western audiences. Hours and hours of his lectures are published on YouTube with mesmerizing titles. Anyway, one of the tenants of his teachings is this idea that humans, like all other matter, is grown from the universe. Each of us is the universe observing and understanding itself. This may be an idea that speaks to why we all feel a desire to take journeys.  To answer your question about a creator, it's just impossible to say. I underwhelm when it comes to explaining the possibility of a creator. If we admit the possibility of a creator, we are then asked to account for the creator's presence. Otherwise, who created the creator?  My feeling is that if we are indeed grown from the universe, which has also grown, than perhaps the limits of it (physical, metaphysical, etc.) Are defined by the growth and evolution that the growth brings. Maybe our universe exists within a drop of rain of another universe. That is to say, it's possible there are no limits to creation. It is just that maybe we can perceive limits since they appear where our understanding halts."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,darkautumnhour,3,Wed Jul 15 20:26:57 2015 UTC,"I love this. One thing that really touched me about all this is remembering Sean Murray talking about how a lot of people who've played NMS and tested it spent their time going back and forth between systems buying low and selling high like a job. At first when Sean had mentioned that I found it funny. After this.... I find it extremely sad. A game that made so you can finally think and explore and enjoy... yet so many are so unfamiliar with this concept, they simply go back to what they are used to. Menial tasks that earn them credits."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,darkautumnhour,3,Wed Jul 15 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"This was in mind as I wrote. I'm glad you picked up on this. A universe truly void of meaning flat out scares some people. That's ok though. Besides, people like machinery. An economy is often explained as some sort of mechanism. It's amazing this game contains that while also containing everything else that's been touched on. At least those who will only trade do not have to pay taxes! ;)"

I'm trying not to be so pessimistic about people choosing just to ""work"" a trading route on this game.

Some people will find wonder in the visuals of this game, others in the subtle mechanics. the economy in this game seems really fleshed out, and I personally will be making observation about it's dynamics for when I need reliable cash to upgrade my ship. Discovering creatures and environment may not be a compelling reason for some people to play this game after the 1 hour mark... Discovering dynamic trade routes in a thriving galactic economy adds a layer of depth to this game that some people really enjoy. You don't need to be brainwashed to see that."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,EuphoricDissonance,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"The thing is that space economy has been done before in numerous other games. Finally a game is coming along that is different from anything we've ever seen, and instead of taking advantage from just that different aspect, those people want to do the same menial work they can do in any other game instead... makes you question why they even got into this game in the first place."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,EuphoricDissonance,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:27:12 2015 UTC,"I get that. I just saying the economy is a big part of the package for many people. It's an intended mechanic that when taking advantage of, allows you to visit places/build things/buy things that may not be available by bobbing around in a pond scanning weird fish. Many sides of the same coin. Some people, myself include would be doing a little bit of everything, and that includes exploring ways to use and abuse the economy"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,rinclais,3,Thu Jul 16 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"I philosovoted this up, and will through in 2 cents of my own. I think this game attracts so many people because it will give of a freedom in virtual reality that we will never have in analog reality. Western children are taught there are a few basic rules to being a person, but other than that you can ""be"" anything you want and go anywhere you want to go.  Unfortunately, society sold us short on these promises. If you were born in the 90s, you never got to grow to be an astronaut, chances are you never will. You never got to be picasso, tesla or bob dylan, because what you really need is a stable job in uncertain times. We left our dreams behind as we grew to be responsible people. We stopped believing we really ever had any dreams. You're stuck here with everybody else, turning food to filth, with the only singular objective of 'Don't die'. Preventing death means, for the most part, collecting wealth, power, and friends and family for emotional support. It doesn't mean take wild, exciting risks for pure enjoyment.  NMS lets us get back to a time when the best day of your life was battling invisible monsters, in the backyard, in your underpants on a sunday afternoon. It's the things could... no, WILL do if your dreams are big enough. It's the affirmation that truly no moment in your life has any meaning unless you imbue it with meaning, on your own terms. A video game is literally nothing but moving pictures on a screen, with some discrete functions that allow you to manipulate some pictures with a control interface. All the ""fun"" you have is synthesized, inside your own mind, just like the child fighting invisible creatures in the backyard. NMS once again forces us to confront this: If I'm going to have fun, it because I choose to, because I allow myself to synthesize a good time. No one else can do it for me."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,e-pocalypse,5,Wed Jul 15 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"Yes all very well said points. The crazy thing is this game of moving images, which we haven't even played yet, has stirred this reaction in us. That's the kicker -- just the idea and vision of this game elicits these feelings from us.  Here's the other thing: I'm not sure I developed this point as well, but when I said NMS is the game that changes the course of virtual reality, it also means NMS is the first iteration of this new epoch for video gaming. Just as the PS4 is improved in every way over the first PlayStation,  NMS stands as the prototype for a new way of experiencing virtual reality. Something will come along that may blow NMS out of the water. This is hard to imagine, but it is inevitable. Yet, NMS will always have my nostalgic childhood sense of wonder."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3devrb,classiczac,4,Wed Jul 15 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"First of all let me say your post is awesome, and what a shame it is that such a well-written exposition does not reach the top of this reddit because of shoddy fan arts that probably took less time to draw than you to write your post.   Yes all very well said points. The crazy thing is this game of moving images, which we haven't even played yet, has stirred this reaction in us. That's the kicker -- just the idea and vision of this game elicits these feelings from us.   I've been thinking exactly this. Just the mere idea of this game is already making me lose interest in most other games. ""What's the point of trying out this game? It won't be nearly the experience NMS will be"".  I'd like to point out you gotta be careful with using the word ""virtual reality"" (mentioned a lot in your article) nowadays because it's now associated with VR sets, most famously Oculus Rift. On a side note, that's one thing that will bring your immersion (and consequently experience) with NMS to an even higher level. I will probably be getting a VR set just for this game!"

Punch through the atmosphere, get close to the ground, level off, and look for a place to land.  They haven't mentioned actually, ANYTHING, about ship control other than that you can buy ships with upgraded stats. Do we have full control of pitch and yaw?

NoMansSkyTheGame,3deta9,StrangeYoungMan,5,Thu Jul 16 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"You probably can.  The only reason I could think of that not being possible is if the transition from space to planet in the atmosphere is a sort of must have sequence, like a loading screen.  If that is true (and it's probably not, cause I don't know as much about this game as the lot of you) and the clouds are in that atmosphere sequence then it would be hard to cruise just above those clouds.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3deta9,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"I was a bit worried about that too, seeing a lot of footage, he always comes in from a same-ish angle and didn't really turn or look around as he entered the atmosphere which made me worry that the planet-atmosphere transition has to have as you said a ""loading screen"".  But then I remember one of the dev gameplay videos, where Sean was using a Dev cam. He moves around seamlessly from space looking at the planet to zooming down on to the surface to look at a tiny pebble on the surface.  It was that point I realised that I am looking at a god."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3deta9,CurseHawking,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:38:14 2015 UTC,"They've had to fudge the transition, because with the atmosphere being in a realistic size, everyone complained that reaching space was too fast.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3deta9,thetruth1998,3,Thu Jul 16 11:27:34 2015 UTC,"Must be possible since when you encounter rain, it would obviously only be on the planet and not just a universal ""rain event"".

New ships will come and go as they dock at the station, and you'll be able to check them out and purchase them.   Here is the page from GI that talks about Portals. I believe he also talked about them in the PSX interview and/or the GI videos.   There'll be portals to different random planets closer to the centre of the galaxy, in rare alien temples that you can discover. The one they saw had a central spire surrounded by a ring of portals to different places with two giant flying snakes circling above. Each portal requires a different weapon or combination of weapons to open. Can't take ship with, so need to gather what you can on other side and go back through the portal.

Speaking of music, does anyone know what the song is in the galaxy trailer is called?  I just watched it again yesterday and that song is amazing, but I can't seem to find the name or anything anywhere."

Worst case scenario, I'll have fun for four or five hours, and it'll dwindle off for another four or five...which means I've gotten plenty out of it for that 60 bucks.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfrx0,MHasho,5,Wed Jul 15 23:14:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm a little puzzled at the apparent graphics gap between some of the videos. There's obviously some way or some build where the game looks amazing. It may be the difference between PS4 and PC with SLI graphics cards and stuff. I really don't know, but it makes me wonder. I have a pretty nice PC so I'd be okay if that's the issue, but it'd be a little sad for the PS4 folks if it's that big of a difference. Or maybe it just has to do with some code changing/tweaking they did for the E3 build that had some unforeseen side-effects or something. Who knows?"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfrx0,GregoryGoose,8,Thu Jul 16 00:06:32 2015 UTC,I'm a little bit confused about the warping sequence. When ships warp as far as I can tell they boost forward sometimes with a trail of light. But the IGN italy video threw me off as the guy warped straight through a planet (or with a planet right in front of him) which caught me off guard.   In the portal gameplay trailer when the ship warped to Xonnas the ship sort of aligned itself before warping which I assumed was changing its direction towards that star system.   So I hope that warping will have a countdown sequence just like that trailer where the ship aligns itself toward that system rather than just instantly warping (no matter where you are) like in the italy video.  tbh; I wasn't sure if warping means a ship actually travels the distance between x and y or uses another means but I was assuming it travelled the distance since some ships project a trail of light forwards if that makes sense?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfrx0,ocofan,8,Wed Jul 15 22:53:43 2015 UTC,"The best I can guess is the warping is more like a wormhole or pocket dimension, rather than traditional ""super speedy forward acceleration"", meaning that stuff in front of you is 100% irrelevant. :)"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfrx0,ocofan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:02 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty positive wormholes are the way it works (meaning that, yes, the object(s) in front of you mean virtually nothing for traveling purposes).

And he responded with ""We've already kind of shown that"" and that was after they released one of their first full-hyperdrive trailers.  I completely agree about the countdown!! That would be nice to have that stick around with release."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfrx0,TheNoyZ1,5,Wed Jul 15 23:30:44 2015 UTC,I assumed he was using the word 'wormholes' interchangeably with the portals shown at the end of the portal gameplay trailer. :(

If you warp 500 light years are you honestly expecting that there will never be any solid objects in your path? Not meteors, other planets, stars, or ships?  I do like your idea about the alignment, although maybe the ship was already aligned towards it? Can't recall"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfrx0,theearthgarden,2,Wed Jul 15 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"In reality it makes sense that there would be obstacles in your path. But since this is all fictional I was basing my expectations off the gameplay footage of the AI travelling forwards in a burst of light that they were travelling forward at a superfast speed.  In the trailer I mentioned about before, the beacon to Xonnas was activated, and within the 3 seconds before the ship warped the ship aimed slightly to the left so I assumed that it was sort of an automatic process the ship would align (although in all the trailers so far the HG staff have been fairly fluid/smooth operating the controls so it may not have been automated at all)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfrx0,ocofan,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, I imagine like the others said, it's ""wormhole"" kind of mechanics :)  As far the beacon Xonnas, the interesting thing is in the ""Night Under No Man's Sky"" video, it said ""Incoming: Distress Beacon"" which I'm not sure you can warp to, nor am I entirely sure what they are?"

The Sentinel response will be different in every planet, and some won't even have sentinels, so on some planets you could probably kill loads of animals will no ramifications, and on others look at an animal the wrong way and you've got sentinels in your tail.  Furthermore, the sentinels don't follow you out to space, the sentinels and intergalactic police are different, the police police space whereas sentinels police the ground."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfrx0,superpositionquantum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:25:40 2015 UTC,"I would like to see continents and tectonic mountain ranges/volcanoes. I don't think it would be difficult to implement into the generation program. Just make it so lines are drawn around the planet of various shapes and sizes and randomly set them as either land or ocean and where land sections meet land sections mountain ranges and volcanoes will be generated. I do enjoy seeing the island planets too though.  another idea I had was for some form of archaeology and speciation. For example. a base model for an animal is made then altered slightly several times and each alteration is then a separate species on the same planet. Then the base model can be altered slightly as a fossil and  placed deep underground. The deeper you dig the base model is altered, then that is altered and so on. With alteration upon alteration you can see the evolution of the organisms you see moving around on the surface.   I would also like to see massive terrain structures, like mountains bigger than Everest, and canyon deeper than the grand canyon and just be able to look at that mountain from kilometers away and see all the way across that canyon as well as the bottom."

I think that the PS4 deal is a good sign that the game will be cheap, as SONY probably wants to use it to move consoles (and it will). The PC release might be a bit more but perhaps will have some sort of performance boost or Oculus support behind it?    Expect low FPS and some graphical glitches. I keep telling people this but it doesn't seem to be getting through. The way the game is designed has a huge benefit but has some downfalls when it comes to accuracy. Grass will probably still float on release and the water will creep up onto the land as you walk around the shore."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfs6j,SuperGodman234,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:50:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't measure my interest in the game by the number of subscribed when I finally joined. I knew about the game a year ago and realized it could consume me if I let the hype train do its thing. It was actually the IGN coverage that gave me hope. Also, I'm 21."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfida,yoshi8710,4,Wed Jul 15 21:31:12 2015 UTC,"It's actually more of a fish if you were to compare it to anything on Earth. The difference is in the way the tail is shaped, vertically instead of horizontally, which would also dictate the natural motion of the spine.  The vertical tail fin allows for a more natural slithering motion, because of the more natural way that the spine will move side to side. Whereas with a flat/horizontal tail fin, it would allow for a more natural up and down movement of the spine, which is better for what you would more likely associate as walking upright, which is why whales/mammals evolved to walking more upright compared to fish which evolved to things like snakes and lizards walking closer to the ground with more of a slithering action.  Cool gif either way."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfida,CurseHawking,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:41:08 2015 UTC,All tetrapods evolved from a common fish-like ancestor.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfida,SaliVader,2,Thu Jul 16 00:10:43 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, but everything probably has a common ancestor somewhere near the beginning of life. The point was that this wouldn't be considered a whale, since whales evolved directly from land-based animals, and fish would have evolved completely in water. The most obvious way to tell the difference in a simple way is the shape of the tail, horizontal for whales. Which, like i said, was because it was more suited to walking, since whales evolved directly from land-based animals."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfyrj,droznig,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:14:35 2015 UTC,"September 15th - The Taken King (Destiny expansion with PS4 exclusive goodies, I think)  October 23rd - Assassin's Creed Syndicate  In between, a whole bunch of sports games, smaller games, and Rock Band.  This window seems like their best bet. After this, there's a slew of blockblusters that No Man's Sky would get buried under (Assassin's Creed, Fallout, Call of Duty, Battlefront). NMS needs to come out before or after these, not at the same time. So either it'll drop in this one month window between Taken King and Assassin's Creed, or it will drop in December, after the deluge of AAA releases.  That's my guess, anyway."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddi6l,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:05 2015 UTC,Oh. Was it the link for the timer? What happens is reddit recognizes previously posted links so you don't repost the same info over and over and over procedurally.   What you can do is link to the original timer post you did and tell us to click the link there.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddi6l,darthgallion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:18:56 2015 UTC,It said that the link was already posted on Reddit even though I had litteraly created the timer 2 minutes prior when I tried to submit my post for the first time.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddi6l,Ryune,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"From my experience, IGN usually throws up a written article to go with most of their videos, unless it's something like a trailer that speaks entirely for itself. While it's generally a near-verbatim transcript of what you're watching, it allows for potential clarification and disclaimer-ing."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3den9f,tr0n42,9,Wed Jul 15 17:56:41 2015 UTC,I think this would be bad for business. A huge portion of potential purchasers would be hospitalized for sleep deprivation before release and rendered unable to buy the game as a result.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3den9f,Fishums1,2,Wed Jul 15 23:22:36 2015 UTC,"That's... actually a good idea.  3 - 5 second GIFs wouldn't reveal too much, especially if the probe just moves in a straight line; it would be the perfect taste of what will be seen.  Some might complain it would accidentally spoil too much if the probe happens across something we're not meant to see, but the odds of that would be slim...  We can only dream, I guess.  Oh, nice calculation of the percentage there. That really puts the scale of the game into perspective!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3den9f,MHasho,2,Wed Jul 15 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"Right up until one probe accidentally flies over an alien civ or something...lol.  Sean talks about wanting the inner galaxy to be a bit of a surprise, to let us slowly build up to it so we have a chance to acclimate to the weirdness. What if he shows us an inside-out, flying space dog on the first day?  What would we do then, Man?!  WHAT?!    :P  But seriously... I'd love it.  I just want more.  IGN trickle feeding me shit isn't cutting it. :'("
NoMansSkyTheGame,3den9f,Linkdead404,2,Wed Jul 15 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"I also thought Grant's Bot GIFs (GBG) were breath taking. I like how it's just a 5-10 stills in a straight line. the images some how seem very ""Mars Rover"".  This could even be the lore explanation for why these images exist, robotic probes sent out to survey the outer rim of the galaxy, to inform future explorers before casting off on their journey"

""Here's my Let's Play!"" ""Anyone else seen the thing that absolutely everyone has seen 100 times?""

Which I did. Without even knowing that you were not a native speaker. Were you offended that I used a meme to do so, or because of the mildly teasing nature of it? Hell, the entire point of that meme is the gentle, polite, and amusing way that Fezzik pointed out the misuse of a word in The Princess Bride. Should I have simply let you continue in your misuse of it?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dde0i,daneelthesane,2,Wed Jul 15 15:29:10 2015 UTC,"Dude, the meme literally, clearly, and openly explains the issue: the word did not mean what you think it means. How is that passive-aggressive? Do you need me to spoon-feed you a definition, or can you operate Google and dictionary.com yourself? Sweet stars alive, man, stop taking yourself so seriously and accept some mild good-natured teasing with some grace, will you? You're acting as if I actually said something insulting.  Tell you what, how about you tease me back? Maybe that will help. Here, let me assist you:   I am overweight.  I am a scatter-brain.  I am woefully out of shape, so I look jiggly when I run, which I don't do more than a couple times a week.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev0u,StifflerCP,3,Wed Jul 15 18:51:21 2015 UTC,"""all the points of interest"" -- It's worth noting that according to several post E3 videos by people who played the demo, the ""scanner"" is upgradeable to have a wider range. So I don't believe that one scan will show you all points of interest on a planet. I could be wrong though."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev0u,grgisme,4,Wed Jul 15 19:06:03 2015 UTC,The thought of being stranded with no idea where your ship is and no way of leaving the planet is eerily cool. That definitely makes me think of sci-fi books and movies.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev0u,Rocket1213,2,Wed Jul 15 22:20:15 2015 UTC,Yes theres a mark of your ship on your compass :)
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev0u,KubeQ11,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard of a homing beacon, or anything like that. I do remember Sean saying that of all the journalists that have played the game, almost all of them end up wandering around aimlessly at the start and end up losing their ship.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev0u,Fractal_Curve,3,Wed Jul 15 19:18:46 2015 UTC,"Another thing that occurred to me is that, because you have the mechanic of upgrading the scanner, it might depend on what level your scanning function is. Which might be the same for most other points of interest in the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev0u,CurseHawking,4,Wed Jul 15 19:20:25 2015 UTC,This is a really cool detail for those interested in caves/mines/underwater/structures under the surface of a planet. You may need to upgrade the scanner to find deeper points of interest.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgp5l,DarthGrabass,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was just shown that. I wonder what significance the large one has, if any."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgp5l,teaminus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:12:11 2015 UTC,"I don't remember ever seeing this. They look a LOT like monoliths! And apparently the beginning of the game follows the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that would make sense. The smaller ones look like one of the portals he went through in a video.  Also, they look like Spore monoliths specifically! Spore clone confirmed"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgp5l,teaminus,0,Thu Jul 16 03:20:43 2015 UTC,We have seen this scene before. It's one of the screen shots on the official website but the shot like the rest of the NMS footage in this video has been color corrected so it looks different. Same location though.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgp5l,northernpace,0,Thu Jul 16 03:50:17 2015 UTC,"Huh. Is there any video of it, or just the portal we've seen before?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgp5l,teaminus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:53:22 2015 UTC,The portal trailer is the same location.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgp5l,RDCAvid,0,Thu Jul 16 04:01:42 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok. I've seen parts of this, but not as a whole. Thank you. Do we know if these are the wormholes Sean references?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgp5l,RDCAvid,2,Thu Jul 16 04:05:36 2015 UTC,"They are portals that take you to a location closer to the center of the galaxy. The hitch is that you can't take your ship with you, so you are forced to come back to your original location. If you find a portal, you will potentially be able to teleport to a more hostile planet, where you may be able to find some rare resources that you can return with to sell at a high price."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgp5l,RDCAvid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:39:14 2015 UTC,In the Game Informer podcast...   GI: Will there be wormholes? SM: The portals that you've seen are kinda like that.   I think he was evading the question to avoid spoiling that there are actual wormholes and they lead to other galaxies but that is just speculation.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3df946,LazarusLong1981,4,Wed Jul 15 20:26:26 2015 UTC,Each planet has a dominant biome. There may be some small variation across the planet but you won't see a planet as diverse as earth.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3df946,devinup,2,Wed Jul 15 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"Actually, three biomes per planet: land, ocean and cave. all three appear to have different creatures and vegetation, (possibly with some crossover)"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3df946,CurseHawking,2,Wed Jul 15 20:37:30 2015 UTC,"Someone disputed that, stating that as it was early in development they could've been using the same batch of names.  We have no proof of this though."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3df946,TheSeaOfThySoul,2,Wed Jul 15 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"You/they might be right. Looking at the IGN Behind the Scenes vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kifCYToAU  He flies all around the Soleth Prime planet, and you don't really see anything that looks like a snowy area. You do see some white sand-like areas, which may be what you're actually seeing in the contrasting pictures. So, maybe what we're seeing in those pictures are not very representative, or completely different planets."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3df946,CurseHawking,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:31:35 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool as we got closer to the center planets became more earth like in multi-biomes.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhns0,P1r4nha,-12,Thu Jul 16 11:01:40 2015 UTC,"Because it's taking away peoples free will. If they want to pre-order a game for whatever reason, allow them. If you don't want to pre-order a game, don't. Someone else pre-ordering isn't going to affect you."

I'm just a man with an opinion who expresses it.. when asked by the way.  Me telling you my opinion shouldn't affect you either. I'm not taking away your ability to make a potentially stupid mistake, spend money on a disappointment and give publishers further incentive to sell games that aren't finished yet and sometimes aren't finished even on launch day.  If quality of games is your desire, then you shouldn't pre-order. But you can, because I'm just some person far away who stares into a screen and types on a keyboard.. there is no mind controlling going on here and you can keep your free will as free as you want it to be. You alone are in control of your actions.. or are you?"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhns0,ShiraCheshire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:20:08 2015 UTC,"We're not as much in control as we'd like to be. Studies have shown how easily people are being manipulated. You and I can easily do it, masters of mind control can get people to do really weird stuff.  One example is the Milgram Experiment where people do horrible things, just because a person that is seemingly an authority is asking them to do something bad to others for instance.  But it goes further with advertisement, government propaganda and echo chambers. You can convince people of the most stupid shit, get other people killed for it too. Dumb people as well as intelligent people. Look at religious extremism as well.  Anyway, I try to argue with facts and if they're convincing I hope I can make you change your mind on certain things like preorders. And if I fail at that then so be it. It's rather irrelevant for NMS or gaming in general, but an interesting topic nevertheless.  All that said I really hope NMS will become a bug free experience and everybody who does go against my advice will not regret it!"

The only reason for a digital preorder is to pre-load, or to get some bonus trinkets. It's pointless to preorder when you get neither."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhns0,SpaceShipRat,2,Thu Jul 16 11:33:04 2015 UTC,"This will be the only game I have ever pre ordered, it will be via Steam so I can pre-load it."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dhns0,Linkdead404,2,Thu Jul 16 10:30:39 2015 UTC,"First, check if it is legitimate.  Second, ask yourself if the pre-order in any way advantages you (discounted, guaranteed delivery significantly faster than if you order when it is released, etc.)  If you cant answer yes to both of the above, keep your money in your wallet."

Its not going to be this la la skip through the woods exploring game that some people think it is.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di5h2,EEKman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:03 2015 UTC,I don't think it will be all that casual friendly. I mean when your ship gets destroyed it's gone forever. When you die on a planet you lose everything you're carrying. That alone makes it different from the majority of mainstream games where there's no real penalty for dying.   The discovery system does seem pretty easy to use though. Does a scan reveal every POI on a planet or is it just in the immediate vicinity?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di5h2,mogi67,2,Thu Jul 16 13:50:12 2015 UTC,"I noticed in the E3 demo, when he scans the planet from outer space, it only shows POI's directly in front of him (in a wide range nonetheless) so it's very possible there's a range limit.  Perhaps that's something you can upgrade if you want exploring to be faster/easier?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di5h2,MHasho,2,Thu Jul 16 13:58:51 2015 UTC,Some of the YouTube podcasts by people who played the closed door demo at E3 reported that you can upgrade your scanner.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di5h2,grgisme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:35:31 2015 UTC,And it didn't show all of them. When he went to the planet and did an upload even more points of interest popped up
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di5h2,TemptedDreamer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:58:14 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you phrased things a little off... I just don't see how AoE scanning and waypoints make this a more casual friendly game.   People can play the game casually if they want to, and others will find ways to play this game competitively.   It's confirmed that there are leaderboards currently implemented in the game, which will hopefully exist in the final product.   Also, being casual-gamer friendly is probably in their best interest. If they made this some kind of permadeath, time trial race-to-the-center game it might attract a few hardcore gamers, but lose most of its appeal to the majority of gamers in the process."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di5h2,MHasho,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:26 2015 UTC,"Nope not worried, I think they have found a balance between UI and gameplay scale that will actually weed out allot of casuals who need the constant reward and hand holding."

I mean, no matter where you are you are able to see your ship, you need to do one scan to have some huge laser beam pointing out all the point of interest of the planet. you don't need to scan every creature one by one the AOE scan.   Where are you getting these ""fears"" from? Just because? Or...?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di5h2,8_Bit_Armada,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:24:00 2015 UTC,"Based on the video that was released at the E3 and the one released from IGN, and my concerns are mostly for the Exploration that looks too user friendly i think"

What I expect is, that the gameplay mechanics will be  straight forward and easy to understand - even for casuals, but when it comes to the game itself, it will not hold the playerÂ´s hands, so that is already something which speaks against it being casual."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3di0ni,Shikaku,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:30:06 2015 UTC,We've seen big ships crashed on planets. You'd need something else planet sized to knock it out of orbit and it would have to come at a pretty good speed too. I think it's safe to assume you cannot knock it out of orbit. Even if you found something big enough to do so how would you move that?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di0ni,4cdbast,-1,Thu Jul 16 13:34:37 2015 UTC,The traders are usally in a fleet and the crashed ships were only one crashed ship. Now im wondering what would happen if the whole fleet crash in a small planet?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3di0ni,knobudee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:38:32 2015 UTC,You'd have a big mess but not enough mass to push the planet anywhere.

There may also be a small possibility that the higher ranked ships will have weapons that can do some real lasting damage to landscapes.

Probably yes   Sean told that every dot of light on the map is a sun, but when he is reaching it, he always arrives near a planet...can someone explain?   Cuz those are suns, but when he warps he just goes to the first planet of that system.   Let's say we encounter another player, can we chat with each other via headset?   Not in the traditional way.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddcp2,AerPilot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:31:50 2015 UTC,Well if you can land then I would assume that you can get out. So maybe once we're on the surface of the Asteroid we can jump and float out into the void.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddcp2,Murrdogg,2,Thu Jul 16 00:44:41 2015 UTC,"From what I can see there won't be multiplayer which is  fine for me (no friends) but can see why some will be turned off by this. I mean even something like guilds would be helpful but if your going fo isolation then most forms of social interaction will have to be left out. But I'm sure modders will implement something in the future. But other questions I have are:   Will there be some form of evolution since bacteria has been confirmed wii be able to come back to presumed desolate planets to find lifeed has begun to spread?  2.Will there be growth among the creatures such as baby form to adulthood? Will I be able to eventually own my own freighter and fleets, and hire players or NPCs to help me run them? Will a be able to setup a home planet to hoard my belongings or will I be limited to what my ship can carry? will I be able to favorite planets/solar systems for return exploration? Can my actions lead to the extinction of alien life forms? Can I capture and sell those alien life forms? Are the capable of learning ie. Will they fight back if their numbers begin to falter not just when they are directly attacked? Do the creatures have genders or do they have both sex? Will I be able to eventually destroy a planet from over mining or from directly shooting at it? ( personally think it would be cool to role play Frieza) On high level ships will the tech tree be bigger or roughly the same with higher level caps on each tech? If my ship is destroyed does it respond or do I start over? How much loot is lost? And can I have back up ships if in case the original is destroyed and no respond is available? How deep will caves be? Will there be a level that no matter how strong the weapon is I can not dig? Will there be built structures like statues and buildings? Will there be hidden loot chests containing upgrades or will all upgrades only be available through craft and shops? Finally will there be hidden premade world's that are secret references to other games, movies, books, real life, etc?   I really can't wait to both play and watch let's plays about this game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddcp2,nomansblade,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"1.Unlikely to have even been considered as you'd need to wait a long time to see evolution occur. Not a definite no.  2.Nothing's been said so far.   2.No.  3.You'll be limited to what your ship can carry but there has been talk of a ""bank account"".  4.You can place waypoints (this was Sean's answer in regards to favouriting).  5.Possibly but it'd be ridiculously difficult.  6.No.   They have a set bahaviour, they can't learn.   8.No confirmation as of yet.   No, it cannot be completely destroyed though extensive damage can be done. There's no tech tree as such, you discover and buy technology but it's not a ""getting this allows you to get this"" system. When your ship is destroyed you escape in an escape pod but lose everything (you keep your suit upgrades though). You can dig 128m down so I presume that's the limit for caves as well.   13.Yes.  14.There will be hidden loot.   No, it's not really possible and chances are no one would find the planet anyway.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev3m,IanMatus,4,Wed Jul 15 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's up to us to figure out. Possibly by checking the price of that element?   Let's say you've been playing the game for a few days, planet hopping, mining, and you discover a new element you haven't mined before. You check the price at a trading post and notice it's super expensive, which might indicate it's a rare mineral! What's even more exciting is that you could combine that mineral with another rare mineral to make some kinda super-hyper-rare compound!!!   Then you make the tough decision of whether to sell it, keep it in case it can be further crafted, or use it in an upgrade.   That's why I'm super excited for the /r/NoMansSkyCrafting subreddit, where all sorts of things like this will be documented."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev3m,MHasho,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:05:39 2015 UTC,I guess that's the only way to find out.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev3m,erikj24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:48:06 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but during the 'economy' IGN video, didn't Sean say that elements from one system would more likely be more expensive in another system's trading post? Would this not make all resources technically ""rare"" and location dependent?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev3m,MHasho,3,Wed Jul 15 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"I imagine there would be some kind of probable range for the elements' price.   For example, I think a very abundant, common resource would never be super-expensive in any system just to keep the economy balanced. Sean's comment about how there's ""a lot going on behind the scenes"" in terms of the economy is encouraging, hopefully it means the economy will be intuitive with some depth, balance, and realism.   I could be wrong though; maybe in the finished game all resources may be region-specific, so if you take a common element and warp to the other side of the galaxy, it would be super expensive since it doesn't exist there.   We could both be on to something, and I wish we had more info about the economy outside of the small slice they gave us in IGN First, but we'll just have to wait and make these discoveries ourselves on day one!"

I'm sure the value of the commodities in the market will tell you how rare they are, too.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev3m,teaminus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:32:45 2015 UTC,It's always been both but you can see Sean scan and find resources in the IGN 18 mins gameplay video @9:15. The augmented grid that briefly appears designates where the resources are then you shoot that spot to get the resources.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev3m,Linkdead404,2,Wed Jul 15 19:42:39 2015 UTC,God damnit...NO...just no... /cry  Now I have to watch the whole damn thing again...for like the 12th time.  /sob
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dev3m,teaminus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:54:09 2015 UTC,haha It's too easy to get sucked down the video rabbit hole with NMS. I'll go to find an answer in an interview and hours later I've watched everything for the millionth time.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfm7s,DawnBlue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:10 2015 UTC,No Man's Sky is coming to PS4 and PC sometime in 2015.   This article actually published this as if it was confirmed info. Not trying to imply this can be interpreted as it actually being true
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfm7s,teaminus,3,Wed Jul 15 22:11:47 2015 UTC,"Well, considering the accuracy of the info and the fact that it was published yesterday, we are probably looking at a fan/reporter who compiled tons of info. As a fan myself, i imagine hes just going with the stuff said by HG, and a little bit of his own hope for the 2015 release too."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfm7s,DawnBlue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:16:24 2015 UTC,That is hard to argue against indeed. My intentions were mostly just to fend off anyone taking this too seriously (especially myself since I don't want false hope)
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfm7s,trkmstrwggy,2,Wed Jul 15 22:23:13 2015 UTC,That is 100% fair enough.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfm7s,teaminus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:57:42 2015 UTC,Hello Games said it is coming in 2015 in a newsletter. Granted it's been a while but it's not like they have said anything to the contrary and it's been published in several exclusive articles with Sean.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dfm7s,Mozzia,2,Wed Jul 15 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"True, it has not been debunked either... Man I just need to keep myself off of any possible false expectations that could hurt my soul :("
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,Fa11enAngeLIV,14,Wed Jul 15 02:50:47 2015 UTC,My plan is to keep obsessing over this game until I get bored and forget about it until release.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,Cabaretcixous,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:04:10 2015 UTC,I'm already there. It's a good time. I can now think straight.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,kotor610,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:47:33 2015 UTC,i've been at that state for the past 6 months
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,EEKman,10,Wed Jul 15 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"Just a side question. This might as well be my post. Im obsessed as well. Here's the thing though. Im not normally like this, ever. I like video games as much as the next guy, I look forward to games, but not like this. Ive never rewatched a trailer over and over before. Ive never rewatched a developer interview. Ive never rewound and rewatched just part of a trailer. There isnt a single other subreddit I look at more than once a day. Anyone else like this? This is out of character for me."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,Scepticer,4,Wed Jul 15 05:44:59 2015 UTC,"I can certainly relate to that. I've been playing computer games for 25+ years but it has been at least 15 years since I was 'hyped' about a game prior to its release. (As a side note, then it was one of the first MMO's and very first sci-fi MMO's - Anarchy Online, which btw burnt me out to the extent I promised myself to never play another MMO again and I basically never have...)  Anyway, I'm totally convinced that HG with NMS is breaking new ground here. I know procedural generation have been done before in big titles like Minecraft and lesser successes like Spore and a whole lot more. But, getting it together in the way this game is shaping up to be, this holds a promise for future gaming.  I'm completely fed up about the CoD or Battlefield single-player campaigns that is more and more reassembling a movie when you play through them. ""Don't go there, dodge now, shoot the tank, run over there... etc..."". Hollywood has had too much influence in the gaming industry the past decade... I'm also fed up with ""not-so-open-world-games"" or games that are truly open but look like crap.  This game hasn't been released yet so I'm aware it remains to be seen, but I THINK, this game might just be about to start a new era of games. An era that puts the gamer in the front seat, rather than the game director, but still manages to look incredible good and provide interesting gameplay."

I refresh this sub WAYYYYYY to often and I know so much information which I would actually prefer not to know. So I could discover it on my own.  The only thing I really want now Is a release date. Once announced I will be satisfied and unsub.   However, I will defiantly re-sub once the game is out and I reach the center. I would be way to terrified of spoilers even though the Mods do a great job about hiding spoilers."

Having this subreddit is a good thing for me personally, since it's a single place i can visit to find new information. Before i started using this place, i was searching google and youtube every few days and limiting the results to anything within the past day or week. The subreddit is a lot easier to get the same information, plus it allows for decent discussion on top of that.  Having accurate information about the game won't lead to unrealistic expectations."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,ocofan,3,Wed Jul 15 13:20:21 2015 UTC,I agree mostly. I'm spending way too much time keeping up to date with all the NMS news. It's becoming too much. The only piece of information I need is the release date. Once I know that I can give myself a break from it all. The only thing stopping me so far from taking a step back right now is my paranoia that if I cut myself off completely that I'll miss the release all together.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,rickolascornelius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:59:35 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. I'm afraid that the game won't meet my expectations (even though I don't have many) because I've already seen everything the game has to offer me. I certainly hope that isn't the case and I will still be subscribed to this sub even after the release date is announced but I can't say I'll be nearly as vigilant about it all.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,SheikhAlEgg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"You make a valid point and its certainly true that we all habituate. You can delay this habituation by delaying the start time but then you're forgetting all the fun you had reading the articles, watching the videos etc. In the end, if you add up things, you'll probably end up with the same amount of 'fun' points using both delay and non-delay tactics."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc3sd,CitrusChrome,-1,Wed Jul 15 10:07:44 2015 UTC,Then GTFO  J/K seriously though if your worried about overdoing it unsub and just come back around launch.

Your art work has a great feel, and really sends my imagination swirling to that of CS Lewis, Ray Bradbury or even my own short story sci-fi works.   Great stuff and  Safe travels, explorer!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9zrg,StifflerCP,2,Tue Jul 14 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"I loved both of those authors whilst growing up. CSLewis first and then scared myself with Bradbury. There was one short, sure it was Bradbury, about long distance travel/teleportation. You had to be drugged or close your eyes whilst being sent, otherwise you brain would experience the thousands of years journey, whilst your body would jump instantly. A kid tricks them, just to see what it's like, ends up a gibbering insane person at the other end!"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,Kelvets,66,Tue Jul 14 17:55:27 2015 UTC,I wonder if they'll include planets that seem barren from the surface but is actually full of underground caves teeming with life.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,Corto-Maltese,20,Tue Jul 14 18:28:47 2015 UTC,There is definitely life in unexpected places. Sean once talked about finding bacteria on a planet he thought was totally barren.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,MelissaJuice,5,Tue Jul 14 21:48:32 2015 UTC,"These kind of small tidbits makes me so curious.  Sean has mentioned a couple of times how he himself has been surprised at what he's found. The way he has done it has been more in the bypassing in interviews, not at all in a promotional way. When the devs themselves honestly are (positively) surprised sometimes, I can only assume there is a lot to discover and be amazed about."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,Scepticer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:12:56 2015 UTC,I want to find a deadly bacteria on a planet and weaponize it. hehehe >:)

NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,TheRecherche,4,Wed Jul 15 04:14:32 2015 UTC,And the multitool can get rid of up to 99.99% of the harmful ones! Yay!

NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,TheRecherche,6,Wed Jul 15 09:00:21 2015 UTC,My guess would just be a scan from his multitool

NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,TheRecherche,2,Wed Jul 15 05:58:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I too have wondered how easy it is to escape them just by running off into the caves or something, how far they can/will actually follow you into them, or if they spawn in there too..

""Of the 10 percent that do [have life], 90 percent of that life will be primitive and boring"" So that means 184 QUADRILLION planets will have life that aren't ""primitive and boring""  So assuming every star has 5 planets, on average it will take visiting 20 stars to find one planet that has life that isn't ""primitive and boring."" Neat."

That means that it takes 100 planets to visit to find 1 with interesting life. If it takes ten minutes per planet, you'll need a thousand minutes. That's around 17 hours on average."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,lavaai,8,Tue Jul 14 22:18:27 2015 UTC,"Nope, his calculation sounds correct to me, I believe you misread it. He mentions visiting 20 stars with 5 planets each to find one planet with interesting life, that's 100 planets in total. The interesting one represents 1% indeed."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,TheKrak3n,17,Tue Jul 14 20:08:15 2015 UTC,"The more and more I read, watch, and think about this concept the more and more strange - alien, if you will - this game becomes to me. I mean, if you think about it this game intends to fully go against every grain of modern gaming (outside of the technology).   The core of this game is loneliness.   I agree with the sentiment that the OP puts forward, though. I'm very, very intrigued about how this game will turn out BECAUSE it's so... different... in that regard. Flying around 100 planets across 20 or so star systems without seeing another player, another ship, another anything. You're just alone. Finding that ""something"", though, seemingly has no option but to light a ""spark"" in the player - it's something rare-ish. It's something they've almost ""longed"" for, regardless of how quickly they jumped from place to place.   With the modern gaming market being more and more inclusive and more and more social, this cuts directly in the opposite direction. No more than a handful of other players being in one place at one time in the best of situations, 1% of planets with actual complex life, 90% void of all life - talk about going the other way."

Just imagine what it would be like to fly a space ship across the deserts of Mars and walk on the mountains of Venus. My favorite parts will be the endless miles I'll walk on barren planets, watching the close moons loom over the planet and endless expanses of places that will most likely never be explored again.  If you think about it, with your home world being at the edge of the Galaxy will most likely never be seen again after you leave it. People will be rushing inward to the center, maybe a few people will explore the outer edges a bit, but will inevitably be drawn in. You are the only person who will ever see that world!"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,grgisme,4,Tue Jul 14 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree and I really hope that the hype train and/or publisher doesn't change anything on this front.  It'd be a shame if they increased the life percentages before they release just to try make the game ""more interesting"" and sell a few more copies.  Though, I seriously doubt Sean would allow that after listening to numerous interviews."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,Charlaquin,2,Tue Jul 14 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"What I think might happen is that the game guarantees that you start on a star with just one (lush) planet and no hyperdrive fuel, so that you're encouraged to explore that planet first of all. Otherwise, imagine how many people would be pissed that they aren't finding any planets like those cool ones they saw at E3 and would demand a refund for thinking they were cheated!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,Charlaquin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:01:46 2015 UTC,Clever. Wouldn't surprise me at all if they did this.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,grgisme,6,Wed Jul 15 03:56:31 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, if you're actively searching for life, there will be ways you can narrow that search. Sure, out of every 100 planets, only 9 will have basic life and 1 will have complex life (on average), but are you planning to land on every one of those planets to look for life? You can probably safely pass on any planets without water, and that will dramatically increase your odds of finding life."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,bendman,5,Tue Jul 14 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"Good thinking, but that only works if we assume that NMS's universe works like ours and water is essential for life... oh wait, even in ours it might not be :) Several creatures can survive dehydrated for very long periods (the tardigrade comes to mind). And even if you don't see water on the surface, the planet could hide underground water veins, or whole rivers inside caves, that the creatures drink from. So it's no guarantee ;)"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,Charlaquin,4,Tue Jul 14 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's definitely no guarantee. I fully expect there to be weird life forms in places we don't expect. But if your goal is to find life, I think it's a safe bet to assume it will be more common on planets with liquid. Maybe that's an unwarranted assumption, but we'll see."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,Charlaquin,2,Tue Jul 14 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"Great point. While you may find life in other places, it certainly would be smart to focus your search if life is your goal (just like NASA does)."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,grgisme,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:02:34 2015 UTC,"This makes me wonder how closely they based life on what we know in our own universe. Will there be weird molten-rock dwelling creatures on planets near the star, or can we limit our search to the ""habitable zone"" around stars?  Also... are there any clear examples of what constitutes basic boring life vs the more interesting life? I'm assuming it's not like reality, where ""life"" on a planet we find could be a few bacteria - it has to be visible. So is it closer to plants vs animals?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,ix_Havoc,5,Tue Jul 14 20:50:04 2015 UTC,"The actual quote from Sean was ""Ninety percent of the planets you visit should be barren, because that's how it would be in our universe and anything else would feel fake. And then 10-percent of them should have some life, but that life 90-percent of the time should just be some grass and some shrubbery or whatever, you know, just some insignificant life. But 10-percent of the time - 10-percent of the 10-percent - it should be real life. But maybe just birds, fish, and things like that, smaller creatures, 90-percent of the time. And 10-percent of the time it should be something a bit more interesting, like four-legged creatures. But that four-legged creature 90-percent of the time should be super boring.""  (Source: http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/no-mans-sky-gives-players-small-chance-discover-something-incredible/)  So yeah, 10% of the planets will have some kind of life, but only 1% will have animal life, and only .1% will have complex animal life, and only .01% will have the really weird stuff. I mean, that's still about 18 trillion planets with really interesting life, but if you're landing on every single planet you can just in case there's going to be life on it, you'll have to land on 100,000 planets on average before you'll find something crazy. I don't know about you, but in the face of those odds, I'm going to be doing whatever I can to narrow that search down to planets that are more likely to have life.  But to me, that's a big part of the fun of the hunt for life. Trying to find patterns. Is life actually more likely to show up on planets with liquid? Are there certain atmospheric conditions that are more conducive to developing complex life? Are larger planets more habitable than smaller ones? Are certain types of stars more likely to host habitable planets? I for one can't wait to find out!"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,Level_100,6,Tue Jul 14 20:22:40 2015 UTC,They've suggested that planets with complex life will tend to be in habitable zone bands around their stars - you can probably safely bypass the mercuries and neptunes of the world and search only the mars/earth/venus planets.  although it sounded like they had no plans to include planets you couldn't land on; which is maybe my one disappointment so far.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3da2is,fisherjoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"I think the only time you can't land on a planet is when your spacesuit isn't a high enough level to deal with the harsh climate/atmosphere of the planet.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgoy1,indyjamesb,5,Thu Jul 16 03:16:49 2015 UTC,How can anyone possibly work that out if we don't know:   How many planets there between you and the centre How far apart they are What your maximum/average jump distance is How long it takes to get enough resources/money to buy fuel How much fuel you need for a maximum jump Whether drive upgrades use more fuel [Insert any other missing figures here]   P.S. Sean says it will take 40-100 hours if you head straight for the centre.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgoy1,posthamster,2,Thu Jul 16 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"Judging by the warp drive capabilities in Sean's gameplay sessions, you won't be jumping 20-30 planets (or systems) at a time. At least in the beginning of the game.  Watch when he zooms out the galactic map. Those lines between stars are the current capabilities of his warp drive."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dgoy1,DarthGrabass,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"If you are the belief that the initial galaxy we all will start in has 264 planets, I did a quick calculation a few months back that shows that that would be rather crazy.   Since my assumption is based on a spherical galaxy shape and an arbitrarily given average distance distribution of the stars (1ly3), what we need to find is the radius to determine the number of jumps from the outside to the center. I am also assuming 9 planets on average per star (I recall an article mentioning 5-13 planets per star, don't remember where though), which gives us 2.0496382E+18 stars at 1ly3 each gives us a known volume (V) of 2.0496382E+18ly3. Using the formula r = cuberoot(3V / 4Ï) gives us the radius of 788,000ly, which I then divided by 100 since I estimated the average jump being 100ly.  Mind you, each jump using these figures skips past 100 star systems, which seems very high to me. The actual distance figures are actually meaningless, since warp jumps are more about the number of skipped systems getting somewhere than real distance. And this is a sphere, if in an elliptical or whirlpool shape, which is closer to a flattened cylinder for volume purposes, the distance from the edge to center would be ridiculous.  Edit - If you increase the jump distance to say 10,000ly per jump, then the 79 jumps to the center becomes much more reasonable for the 40-100 hour estimate. It really depends on the distance per jump, and the amount of stars we skip past for each jump."

As we get closer to the center we can upgrade our hyperdrive to jump further."

Our Milky Way galaxy is 100,000 light years across. The nearest star to our Sun is 4 light years away. That means that 25,000 Suns would stretch the diameter of the galaxy. Half of that (the radius) is how many stars would be in your way on the way to the center, 12,500. So, 12,500 divided by 20 (you said 20-30) is 625.  It would take 625 jumps to reach the center of our own galaxy. I highly doubt it will take much more than 50 jumps in the game to reach the center of each galaxy though."

Simon's texts to his images are just about as unique and suggestive as his pictures... This particular picture is on my livingroom wall, got it from redbubble.

At the start of the new vid it's a different system much closer (1.4ly).

NoMansSkyTheGame,3db2vo,pykaswitz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:22:14 2015 UTC,Spoil used at this moment with NMS by Murray demos means not to ruin that sense and wonder exploration brings to discovering something for the first time.  Unspoilable in the article is about how massive the universe is that no one streaming or doing Let's Plays could have the same experience as another and how the story that unfolds for you could never be spoiled no matter how many streams or Let's Plays you watch.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dcvne,knobudee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:55:48 2015 UTC,When I worked in the game industry it was near impossible to find a new system at a lower price. Sony sets the price and that's what you have to sell it for. Companies don't make much off of new systems. Game sales is where the money is.  I'd check a pawn shop or a game store for used systems if you want it cheaper.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dcvne,Curratum,2,Wed Jul 15 07:41:39 2015 UTC,The deals have been lackluster this far so I wouldn't get your hopes up on finding a cheap PS4.

It's way not as frictionless as on PC. This is definitely one area where PC > console."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dai3o,carminejr,16,Tue Jul 14 19:48:32 2015 UTC,"Go into your Share settings and make it so that one quick tap of the share button takes a screenshot. No need to pull up the Share menu at all when taking photos, so it's about as frictionless as it gets.   And if you want to start recording without pulling up the Share menu and interrupting gameplay, just double tap the share button."

Look, there's spaceships, space stations, trading posts with ships coming and going, traders and pirates criss-crossing every last solar system. If that's not intelligent life, what is?  I know what OP meant, i.e. will we encounter cities (probably, no ""In any case, Murray wants to avoid the bustling feel of conventional MMOs, in which players tend to cluster and shout at each otherâwhich is also why you won't find cities in No Man's Sky.""  Will we encounter huminoids out of there ships?

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dehpa,darkautumnhour,2,Wed Jul 15 17:40:40 2015 UTC,The theory of robots has been rased in the past few days and I found it interesting.   May bw he just meant that intelligent life forms could not be discovered like all the other generated content but that exclude NPCs in ships? Remember that there is no way to know the difference between a NPC and a player...
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dehpa,jgodin03,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"I think Sean's big pet peeve with modern video games is essentially every journey you undertake occurs between either two dialogue boxes or two cut-scenes. As long as you're not in a character dialogue or a cut scene, everything else seems to be fair game is NMS.  I personally would find more enjoyment trading with some type of NPC then a static trading post. If it felt like you were filling a need for some virtual party, trading might feel more rewarding then just noting prices for things, and carting elements around for arbitrage.  But that's the balance you strike in a game with no missions, cutscenes, or dialogue. All of the context has to come from your imagination. I'm okay with that."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dehpa,darkautumnhour,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:28:26 2015 UTC,I'm okay with that.   I am too. The game seems like a nice change of pace compared with AAA titles.

I don't see there being TOO much of a story to spoil here, at least not enough to avoid this sub. So what if you see something that someone else discovered first?  There's 18 quintillion fucking planets; you're not going to discover everything yourself.

The odds of me finding a planet exactly like one you find are pretty low, but, to be fair, there can only be so many different planet ""types""; i.e. snowy plains, lava/hellish mountains, barren mountains, a simple sphere.   And yes, I know there is a lot more than that, but you get the gist.  I guess I will do what I can to avoid the major things that I've not been around.

So if you see a [insert planetary feature], does that spoil it for you (not you per se, but anyone)???  I don't understand that line of thought.  In a game this huge it's almost idiotic to think someone could ""spoil"" something other than a part of the story/center of the galaxy. There is just too much content."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dba5e,eriongtk,2,Wed Jul 15 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from but I'm not super concerned really. It sounds like everyone will literally be able to carve out their own completely unique experience (more than ""I answered no to that NPC question"" or ""I did this quest instead of that one."") so something getting spoiled for me is probably pretty remote. I also suspect the ""center"" we can get to will be unique for everyone as well. However I will avoid topics about that piece before I experience it myself."

It is clear listening to him on this podcast that we really are only being show a tiny part of what is to come and I love him for that.

I can almost guarantee that other players will be closer than the centre of the galaxy, it might take you 10 hours to get to that system, and they've probably moved on, but now you're much closer, you're on the trail and the hunt is on.  You'll be able to spot players that are going to be easier targets to track down, they'll have named all the planets in a system, and there will be a string of systems like that right next to each-other."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddidf,ShawnManX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:22:37 2015 UTC,Even if you get too the same planet somehow at the same time the chances of you running into them are astronomical.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddidf,DrFeargood,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:27 2015 UTC,"We don't have all the info yet but here's what we know.  First target acquisition, start heading to the center as soon as you can, while scanning the galaxy map.  Once you notice a string of 3 discovered systems veer off that way a bit.  If the string keeps growing at a reliable rate you've found a good target, if it starts to get unpredictable, they're back tracking or skipping systems, find a new target.  You are the lion in the grass watching for patterns, the circling shark.  Once you have found a suitable target you want to cut them off.  Their goal in the middle.  You want to get between them and that.  You probably want the first engagement to be an ambush.  When you warp to a new system, from what we have seen, you pop in near enough the space station to see it.  It is a point meant to draw your attention.  Most players are going to make that their first stop in a new system.  If it was me I'd make this the place i first attempt an ambush.  As far as we know players can't see what's behind them use this to your advantage.  Or you could hide inside the station.  Find a nearby asteroid, or the bottom of a freighter.  Some place where you have line of sight to the station entrance but are unlikely to be noticed."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3ddidf,ShawnManX,2,Thu Jul 16 00:32:01 2015 UTC,"Everything you said could be used to potentially find another player, but you are counting on them being online at the same time as you. With planet sized planets, and the vastness of space, it is still unlikely that you will even notice them even if they are only a few hundred meters off. Anyone who has played Space Engineers can stay how hard it is to see/find anything in space.  Having said that I fully intend to try my best to find other players and hopefully I do! Maybe we'll find each other employing the methods you've laid out above :)"

At 0:46, he goes into the galactic map and flies RIGHT AT what appears to be a binary star as he gets to it. When he realizes this, at around 0:48, he strafes hard to the left and moves around so what looked like a binary star now has more room. Now, it still could be binary... but then at 0:55 you see two separate warp range lines connecting the two stars, so you know they're separate (probably)."

If you were good at it, you'd only see them within 10 blocks of you due to the density. It was artificial and not the normal experience in game."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,SpaceShipRat,6,Tue Jul 14 14:46:25 2015 UTC,"Speaking of demo builds, I hope they start to show off an actual build soon, closer to what the finished result will be. If they keep showing off demo builds which end up varying greatly from the finished build, they're just showing us something that will not occur in the actual game, or at least in a greater density than in the finished game. I'm not saying it's false advertising, but gamers have been known to overreact to that sort of thing in the past (looking at you, Destiny forums). <edit>In Destiny's case, at least some of that overreaction was warranted. I don't expect many people complaining about a dud planet here or there when there are so many others to explore</edit>  I for one won't mind at all finding a barren planet. It will make finding the lush, populated planets we've seen all the more exciting. I realize it doesn't make for the best publicity, but let's face it - we're already hooked on the game, so show us something closer to what we can expect!"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,SpaceShipRat,3,Tue Jul 14 15:33:38 2015 UTC,"I think they should just give the game to, say, 20 let's players and give them a free half an hour without sean or anyone else with them."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,MHasho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"Per your edit: I feel like there will be something more definite coming out before they release to game to better set expectations. Could be at the end of this IGN First month. Sean confirming, again, that this is a demonstration build from E3 and better laying out what to expect in the real game in terms of life & other such questions. Much like the '70 Questions' video but a bit more serious."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,MHasho,3,Tue Jul 14 15:58:20 2015 UTC,"I hope so! I know what to expect going in, because I spend way too much time on here picking over every scrap. But if all I'd seen was the E3 videos, I might expect every planet to be that populated - which again would not disappoint me, but would be an unfair expectation."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,Petal_Chatoyance,6,Tue Jul 14 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"I'd rather stop trying to explain things with ""the demo doesn't represent the game"".   Not that it would bother me personally if they upped the number of creatures for a demo, but it's unjust to keep telling everyone they've changed parameters when we don't even know if it's true."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,SDJ67,5,Tue Jul 14 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"The difference is that they did say that they changed the parameters. Animal density, types of animals, location of beacons, worlds with life..."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,Pestilence11,2,Tue Jul 14 20:10:15 2015 UTC,It has been stated in other articles that the maths was fudged a bit for demos/trailers. See the quote from the New Yorker article in OP.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,RdEydFcd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"That's talking about the previous trailers. See there where it says ""previous builds"" as opposed to the current demonstration build? It's saying the opposite of what you're saying ""forgive possible boring moments, because while the previous builds had cool stuff packed toghether, while this is the game as it's going to be"""
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,StifflerCP,4,Tue Jul 14 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"Could be onto something, definitely.   Another thing I always think about... in the old trailer where he emerges from the cave, sees the antelope-type creature, then the tall dinosaurs + rhinos, there's minimal pop-in occurring (I think an antelope kind of popped in at one point I can't recall).   We know that it was actual gameplay and not a cinematic, and he even revisited that spot in a separate video. This was on an older build as well.  The number of species on screen at once in the past few trailers has definitely been over the top, so this could be a good reason."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,MassiveLaser,3,Tue Jul 14 14:50:56 2015 UTC,"I actually think the original video was a reasonable amount of creatures vs what we have seen recently. I'd also bet that the original E3 trailer was done on a development PC that could handle whatever they threw at it. The demo was real gameplay, but it was pre-recorded. I'd like to know if there is any confirmation of what system the E3 press demos were being shown on. They're using the PS4 controller (which I know can work on PC) but with Sony running the show I'd think they'd want them to use a PS4."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,StifflerCP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I agree with you about the trailer being on PC.   My only reasonable option is to buy this game for PS4 so I'm hoping the PS4 can handle the game."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,MassiveLaser,4,Tue Jul 14 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I am a little appalled at the fuss over such minor pop-up issues by folks. The program is generating an entire cosmos, on the fly, from mathematical formulas, without on-the-disk assets, and people bitch about 'pop-in'.    Now, I'm an older gamer. I'm 55. I know pop-in. I've played games where you had to wait for the ground you were standing on to be gradually rendered - and that for a game world no larger than a football pitch.    It's a whole universe, folks! Plants and animals and stars and ruins and space ships and nebulae and black holes and for all we know, star whales! If the grass occasionally floats on cliff edges, if the odd rock or animal rezzes-in within your peripheral vision... is it fair - I ask you - is it even fair to complain so bitterly about it?    I say no. I say a big huge no. I feel like some people here are... it's like going to heaven, standing on a road of gold, surrounded by clouds and angels, and complaining that the clouds just aren't pink enough. Not the right precise shade of paradise. God sucks. Can't even render the clouds right.    This is how I feel when I read people bitching about pop-in. Yes, maybe there is the occasional bit of it. It isn't very common, yes it happens. They are giving you an entire universe to play in, children! Show a little gratitude and overlook minor imperfections for Sean's sake!    And seriously - the amount of pop-in we've seen? It is nothing! It is completely insignificant. Would you rather have thick fog all the time? That's the standard trick to hide the issue. Be grateful. Let the minor, rare, occasional pop-in slide, guys.    Sheesh."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9apf,TheSeaOfThySoul,2,Tue Jul 14 22:40:06 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it is not as huge an issue as some people make it out to be, you have to wonder what the impact of it could be if a predatory creature appeared right in front of you. Part of the game is exploring on foot and seeing what all is out there. The pop in issue, if not fixed (and for all we know it is not a problem anymore and what we're seeing now is the result of a special build or other factors), could be a major bug that impacts gameplay significantly. If my playing was interrupted more than a couple times by being killed by an animal I never saw appear next to me, I'd probably stop playing for a while and would be hesitant to recommend it to friends."

During the fly-by NH is too busy doing science to talk to Earth (both the science instruments and the antenna can only be aimed by turning the entire space-craft).   In a couple of hours NH will 'phone home' to say it survived the fly-by. That signal will take 4.5 hours to reach Earth, and is expected to arrive here around 11PMish (if I remember right) GMT.  The first photos from the fly-by will take longer to arrive. In total NH will collect something like 64 gigs of data.

His studio, bullfrog productions (co-founder) went on to produce a string of hits through the mid-nineties. At that point he had a pretty solid rep as a game designer. Then, along came Fable. Fable has a good sized fan base (I think they're pretty good games) but they're notorious for missing so many features that they don't even resemble the game that was promised. Found a vid on the subject if you're interested.  https://youtu.be/lGo63oAEN20?t=98"

Maybe some of the robots have started cloning animals the wrong way so they're all fucked up or something.  I do remember them saying that the life would get weirder towards the centre, and I suspect that would be one explanation. Although how you can save the universe without changing the storyline for everyone else is a new one on me. This does remind me of the objective in Spore once you go into the space stage. The ideas was to get to the centre of the universe where you essentially are given this ability to create life from lifeless planets. Maybe they've shamelessly copied this idea. And shamelessly copied the evil-robot-at-the-centre-of-the-galaxy thing from spore too. Anyone who played that game remembers the grox."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3daml6,fathertime979,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:45:53 2015 UTC,Nothing. Fly all you want but you can never get there. The bright light very slowly gets bigger and bigger to give you false hope. You can even keep going till the light just fills your screen blinding you. So close! Almost there! You feel like you could just reach out and touch it... But you can't and you never will.  Another fun way that this could happen is for every system you pass another is spawned from the core. The galaxy will always grow at the same rate you are traveling.   Or possibly what should be there. A black hole. Your reward for making it there is to watch your self slowly get sucked down into the center with no way to escape. If you are patient enough you can wait 18 quintillion seconds to eventually be killed and respawn. For some players this will be the end of the game. For other they will start a new character to explore anew. But this time they will travel a little wiser without childish dreams of the wonders at the canter of the galaxy for they now know it is logical as it should be. A black hole indeed.

Sean Murray is clear in every video and keeps saying, ""the center of the galaxy"" and not ""the center of the universe"". This leads me to believe that all the stars you've seen so far in the demos are only within just 1 galaxy out of billions (maybe trillions?) that the procedural world can generate. Much like how our solar system is one system among billions in the milky way galaxy and there are billions of galaxies within our supercluster, and many superclusters within our universe. My guess is that getting to the center would unlock/upgrade your hyperdrive to achieve inter-galatic travel to explore the entire universe. There are probably other incentives to keep playing but that alone would be enough for me to stay hooked."

As he enters the atmosphere he comes down right on that small island, it doesnt change size or shape at all upon arrival, only vegetation spawns on it.   Also as he gets closer to the ground, the ""bridge"" on the left stays in view quite a while, and never changes shape or size.   With the small island not changing at all, despite being a relatively small landmass, if rendering was unrealistic to scope/size of landmasses from distance, it should have changed somewhat one would think.   The bridge also didnt change at any point before it went out of view. It is unnaturally straight, and seems very coincidental to always stretch between two islands. Why not just randomly jutting out into the water to nothing in particular if it was just thin landmasses that are rendered poorly?  In short, I think it could be a bridge, and not just a rendering distance issue."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dbbvf,grgisme,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:48 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't you? There's no npcs so if you're both landed on planets you would stick out immediately. In space I guess it would be harder to determine but I'm guessing a player could be differentiated from the computer by non-linear or unpredictable patterns of flight; if you watch enough AI ships you may spots patterns after a while and notice when something doesn't conform to that pattern of flight.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dbbvf,Renegade_Meister,2,Wed Jul 15 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"yeah the AI usually seem to fly in groups as well, and like you said their flight pattern is somewhat predictable and smooth, with no meandering. Human players will be all over the place, we often change our mind about what we want to do half-way through whatever we're doing so it shouldn't be that hard to figure out after playing the game for a while and getting the AI down"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dbbvf,Congzilla,2,Wed Jul 15 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"there's a great game on Xbox 360 (AFAIK): Hidden in plain sight.   finding players in the crowd of AI which all behave strangely human-like ... or like humans acting AI-like, makes the game really fun to play with friends. Strangely you always find out who is a player by finding patterns a human does (check out a video on yt , it's tons of fun :) )"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dbbvf,inkyllama,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:13:20 2015 UTC,I saw it on YT a while ago. Simple games can often get great multiplayer fun from them.

On a planet; depending on how close my ship is to me I would be highly defensive if it was close-by as they could really screw me over by attacking the ship and my spawn point. If I have low resources gathered and my ship is hidden on the ground then why not give them a chance I suppose. But I've learnt not to trust anonymous people who have the ability to attack my character.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3db9a2,X_Joshi_X,3,Tue Jul 14 22:51:32 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a bit weird the way that people talk about hype with games right now. Its a bit silly but people get so worked up over it.   I think the problem is when companies sell an idea that isn't what the game is (Destiny) or show graphics that aren't the real graphics (watchdogs).  Outside of that, players need to learn to expect what is shown and promised.   As long as people are expecting an intergalactic exploring game, I think we will be ok with the hype. The game looks good to me. I'm excited by all the possibilities. Now, if they have all these planets and they look the same or if there is some other unforseen limitation, that would be a bit lame. So we will just need to wait and see."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db9a2,t-rexclub76,3,Wed Jul 15 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"But the problem isn't just companies selling something that isn't real. As we've seen with NMS, the audience can be culpable too. Just look at the comment section for the IGN video on how the economy works. For some reason, a whole bunch of people deduced from that video that there would be base-building. Obviously that's something that HG has no control over (people being dumb), but it's still a huge factor in how games are perceived as being overhyped."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db9a2,DarthGrabass,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:34:19 2015 UTC,"Lol. Very true. Speculation does get out of control.   The other thing that's weird is hype is such a negative thing for games right now. I guess most people are sick of being taken for a ride and now they don't want hyped up games that aren't good. But, thats marketing. Its supposed to build excitement.  Hellogames seems to be trying to avoid a hype backlash to a certain extent here. Sean seems nervous from the excitement. Its really interesting how different this is from some AAA games that talk themselves up beyond all reason."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db9a2,t-rexclub76,2,Wed Jul 15 10:12:00 2015 UTC,Yeah haha people talk about hype like its a feature in the game haha
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db9a2,Paulbo83,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:59:30 2015 UTC,So true. Even reviewers will talk about whether a game lived up to the hype.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,arnezami,66,Tue Jul 14 00:22:54 2015 UTC,Well as excited as I am these videos aren't doing good at keeping me hooked. I'm still excited as fuck but that video seemed... underwhelming.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,fathertime979,56,Tue Jul 14 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"It's because the guy playing doesn't know how to explore properly when he lands on a small island.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,cetlaph,20,Tue Jul 14 02:10:08 2015 UTC,Hell even docking at the space station would have been good to see.  Or get up close to one of the big freighters.  But nope.   I think I'll just do exactly the same thing Sean just did.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,vibribbon,15,Tue Jul 14 02:26:44 2015 UTC,I know right? This guy really comes across as a typical spoon-fed gamer who needs context & instruction.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,FFlashh,9,Tue Jul 14 04:36:45 2015 UTC,"Well, somehow I doubt that. First off, he's the lead editor of IGN. Second, I'm sure Sean gave him instructions on what to do and what not to do. Sean lives and dies by his secrets and wants you to discover them, not see someone else find them out and experience the game vicariously. Hell, that's the point of this game: exploration and child like wonder. You don't get that from seeing someone else do it. In his mind the less you see the better."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,agnl,4,Tue Jul 14 05:46:27 2015 UTC,"I totally understand this. I'm just saying how it comes across, not that he actually is a spoon-fed gamer. A lot of people aren't informed enough to know of Sean's motives."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,FFlashh,5,Tue Jul 14 06:21:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'm just not a fan of hating everyone at IGN. Sure a lot of video gaming journalists are not the greatest, but to lump them all together just isn't a good thing to do. I get what you're saying though."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,agnl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:26:19 2015 UTC,"That argument only holds so much weight though. When the game comes out people are going to watch let's plays and twitch streams of it so that's going to happen. And also, would it really have killed the ENTIRE games secrets if he went to one freighter and showed us something interesting?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,klovasos,2,Tue Jul 14 13:05:43 2015 UTC,"No. It would have changed fuck all about the game.  Personally I think they need to quit with the ""soon"" bullshit and stop acting like the game holds some top tier secrets. In a game with 18quintillion  planets ect ect I think they can start to show some shit."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,Shikaku,2,Tue Jul 14 13:17:18 2015 UTC,I bought an xbox for fable back in the day and I still haven't forgiven Peter Molyneux for that hype train. I think Sean is trying to prevent this kind of hype. Which I'm ok with.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,happytikiman,4,Tue Jul 14 13:40:59 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure he covers more Xbox things.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,Jclevs11,5,Tue Jul 14 06:43:06 2015 UTC,Even if he landed near the crashed freighter and explored that a bit it would have been a much more interesting video

Maybe we're expecting too much here because we've been pouring over every nuance of information, but that was like 2 minutes of randomly walking in a circle and thoughtlessly shooting a couple of things.  Perhaps Sean has asked them not to do anything special (like crashed ships) as to not ruin the surprise of discovery?"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,Sausages43,2,Tue Jul 14 10:49:51 2015 UTC,"Except it wasn't. Because the IGN guy specifically asked and Sean said yes upon rewatching, the fucking IGN guy muttered ""yeah"" in response to himself, but I stand by the fact it's not a rendering issue. I did think it was rendering at first, but the dude controlling it just happened to be moving with the water.   Edit: I re watched and as he approaches the shore and says ""should we go up there? (Nah let's not that would be too fucking interesting for an IGN video)"", you can see the water moving in towards him, overtaking a few small rocks. It doesn't just move with the camera."

Â  Usually high-res texture and detail pop-in doesn't bother me that much, but when entire models (buildings, cars, characters, etc) just appear out of nowhere it's pretty jarring. Â  Granted we have no clue how new or old that build was nor how long till it comes out, but I just wanted to point that out.  On a TV it's very noticeable.  The draw distance for creatures and foliage only seems to be about 20-30ft in that build. Â  Like when he lands, he's hovering very slow over the ground for a while, and it's just flat.  But as soon as he lands BAM!  There's creatures and vegetation and crystals there that should have been seen while in the ship since they are that close.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,DatapawWolf,11,Tue Jul 14 03:23:23 2015 UTC,"But it is so boring. I have friends who would understandably see that and go ""wow this game is boring"" and pass up future videos. The bottom line is, if you can't make an interesting short gameplay video because spoilers... DO NOT MAKE ONE. That is what tempting screenshots are for, not gameplay videos."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,nixon_prime,2,Tue Jul 14 13:51:13 2015 UTC,Completely agree.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,nemcade,8,Tue Jul 14 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that this is a showdemo build of the game that generates certain things to show and leaves a lot out for the full release. Every planet and moon shown so far in this build has had life and uses these ""dinosaurian"" base assets. As we have learned only 1/10 planets should have life in them and that further we progress in to the galaxy things gets weirder.   This let's me to believe that they've wanted to assure we see life at E3 presentation thus making a build that generates certain things and wont spoil the rest of the game wherever IGN guy would've gone."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,pearlmuter,3,Tue Jul 14 07:57:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting take. Now that you mention it, it seems to explain many of my own puzzles. That means, I think, that the game will not come out right now, but rather closer to holiday season."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,MAKE_ME_REDDIT,3,Tue Jul 14 09:31:39 2015 UTC,Haven't they said that they made the demo builds have certain parameters so they don't spend forever looking for stuff?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,nemcade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. But I think they also hold things back for understandable reasons. So in the build they are showing right now, every star system in the galaxy would look more or less how we've seen so far. Leaving the real discoveries for the players after release."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,archeolog108,2,Wed Jul 15 05:35:46 2015 UTC,"This is how it is done. When you demo, you want to show the best stuff. Not some barren moon with nothing."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,nemcade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:31:47 2015 UTC,Agree. Maybe they just should've been more clear about how the build works. Not everyone knows how games work and with procedural generating even less. Build worked great with E3 but when they showed it with IGN the forced generating of the wildlife is almost apparent after leaving the first planet. I would've been happy to see just a barren rocks with epic sci-fi landscapes after that.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,ocofan,3,Wed Jul 15 05:26:07 2015 UTC,Super excited to see neighboring stars so close to each other on the galactic map; kind of wish he picked the twin stars at 00:48 instead.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,Renegade_Meister,5,Tue Jul 14 00:45:45 2015 UTC,Nice find!  I was hoping to see the gun fired near a creature instead of at a creature since that already happened in the first video.  Oh well - Hopefully there's more to look forward to later this week.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,dnsbubba,13,Tue Jul 14 01:04:31 2015 UTC,Sean fired near one of the creatures in the same video that he fired at a creature.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,niccoli,4,Tue Jul 14 07:51:21 2015 UTC,"Because the guy with the controller is being incredibly boring.  I mean, it's cool to see new stuff.  But wow, so little done.  So much potential lost.   And yeah, I suppose it could be a ""Sean didn't want him to show anything spectacular off, but if so, why have the demo.  It's not really much more beyond what we've already seen."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,sarcblmed,6,Tue Jul 14 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know why but it bothers me that there are land animals in that small island. How did they get there? Are they all amphibious? It seemed the creature attacking him was with all its fins, but I would've liked to see him go into the water to see if the creature attacking him would follow at the least."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,Wulf_Star_Strider,7,Tue Jul 14 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"I suspect they have the animal density setting dialed way up on the demo builds, just to be sure the journalists can interact with them. That may account for the animal pop in too. The engine is being told to spawn many more animals in a small space much faster than it normally would."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,RdEydFcd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:49:18 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of that, it may very well be the case. It may account for a lot of the pop-in with everything too. If they dialed the up the density of quite a few things, the radius around the player where that density is apparent would probably shrink, causing the flashlight-on-a-mural-at-night effect we've seen in these videos."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,MaxwellSalmon,2,Tue Jul 14 10:59:01 2015 UTC,"I thought that as well, but the island isn't far from bigger islands. They could easily swing out there. But I don't really think it' scan excuse. I bet there will be animals no matter how far from land they are."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,RdEydFcd,2,Tue Jul 14 09:20:54 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it, fauna spawns in within a certain radius of the player, then despawns once it leaves that area. It looks like he could have walked around that island and spawned in new examples of fauna ad infinitum, because the island was larger than the spawn radius.  Maybe there's limitations to it, or more nuance than we can see from the gameplay videos, but it looks like you'll never just stumble upon new animals, they just spawn in around you."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,SteroyJenkins,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:47:36 2015 UTC,The island seemed out of place like it's a currently flooded area and the water will recide a bit and a land bridge will form. Only way to know is explore under water.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,blueExcess,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:45:06 2015 UTC,"We saw there is a tide, and admittedly I know very little about the specifics of tidal forces, but I do know that if that were a real place, the water is all connected and we can assume there are much larger bodies of water nearby that would be affected by the tidal forces of a moon I didn't see, so that would be very likely."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,DurMan667,5,Tue Jul 14 02:10:55 2015 UTC,Looked like caves at low detail.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,trynagetrich,2,Tue Jul 14 02:28:20 2015 UTC,"Looked like some rendering/pop-in to me. That's how they allow a ton of planets, procedurally rendering parts of the galaxy/worlds at the specific time you visit it. If it was rendering the entire galaxy at once... well it couldn't. There's just no way."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,Dizman7,3,Tue Jul 14 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"As others have said kind of ho-hum playing but still some neat stuff in the vid, thanks for finding it.  That planet seemed more interesting than what they did with it.  I really liked the capital ship, I thought that seemed much larger than the freighters we've seen before. Â  I personally would have investigated the crash asap!  As I believe in the past they've said u can salvage crashes, not just cargo but I think break down the ship too. Â  Then I probably would've checked out where the traders were going, that seemed like a pretty large fleet, must be something good. Â  Then checked out that mountain, and take a swim and see what's under there and how deep it might be."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,SpaceNinjaBear,3,Tue Jul 14 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"I got super excited when he spotted the derelict freighter crashed into a mountainside...  ... and then he just flew right past it. Like come on, man! I kept thinking, go back to the derelict! Go back to the derelict! That looked awesome! Ah well. Maybe they're saving juicier gameplay footage for later on."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,HuWeiliu,7,Tue Jul 14 17:34:31 2015 UTC,Yeah this video did a really job job of reinforcing the thought that there is not much to do in this game that wouldn't get repetitive really fast.

I've been wondering why they would post this video to IGN Italy and now IGN Brazil while giving IGN USA different content. It seemed a little strange, but maybe you're on to something. They could be using those smaller markets as a test or something. Maybe they spruce it up if it gets a bad reception there? Hahaha, or more likely I'm giving IGN way too much credit."

Nice to see  they have sensible tactics built into the algorithms.  B.

I mean that has to be a good feature right? /s  Seriously though this video seemed to only show that te demo is non scripted which I would have believed already since Sean died in the first first video. Hopefully the next video release is ""underwater and harsh environment discussion"" or ""we stopped showing you IGN employees and showed a space station"" I know the titles are clunky but they get the point across damnit."

I could be up in the night, but I swear I saw that not too long ago and yet I've not seen anything like that in any of the videos. He did say that it wasn't a loading screen or anything - maybe it loads while you're in the warp tunnel?   Thinking back - we haven't seen that in any of the live demos either... I really could swear I saw that fairly recently. Maybe it has something to do with the ""demo"" build? IDK, maybe someone confirm they've seen this as well and I'm not just raving mad :)"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d6y0k,blueExcess,2,Tue Jul 14 11:29:00 2015 UTC,"I really think that has something to do with this build. If you watch older videos that doesn't really happen. In fact, I think it was a 30-minute gamespot video interview where Sean was bragging about how nothing was popping (and indeed it wasn't). There was a gentle fading-in from low to med LOD, but it looked very realistic - and this was all happening while Sean was using the debug camera and really pushing the system. From what I can tell, Sean does not seem like the kind of guy who would accept ""popping"" in the final release when much earlier builds worked perfectly."

The work they've been doing since then has supposedly been to get the full master version up to the same quality.  From the New Yorker   Murray loaded up a demo of the game that he had created for E3: a solar system of six planets.   His mind turned from the screen in front of usâthe six planets, tidily assembled for the demoâto the full version of No Manâs Sky on the operating table on the studioâs first floor, below us.

Sean has said that this build is revved up for demo purposes as all of these videos were done at E3. He is afraid of showing real gameplay because what happens when the IGN guy, who doesn't even seem to understand what he is doing in the first place, just jumps between 5 different barren planets then ends the video? Public perception would be ""this is shit!"" Sean has also said that he kept the creatures pretty tame in this build because people can easily recognize them as opposed to something more mutated and alien."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9ey2,grgisme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's unlikely, but perhaps different galaxies will use a different ""seed"" and look drastically different?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9ey2,SpaceShipRat,2,Tue Jul 14 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know whether to hope for that.   The seed is the same one, and can't be tweaked after launch. So they can't use other galaxies as ""expansions"" to add content afterwards. So any content that's ""exclusive"" to other galaxies is just taking away variety from the one most people will play in."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9ey2,grgisme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"The safe assumption I think is that you're right -- since they're doing a lot of hard work to make it so that the function/seed they're using results in exactly the universe they want.  However, I haven't found proof of that yet. Sean has specifically said that what they used to call the Universe they changed their terminology to call a ""galaxy"". -- I'll look for the source of this.  With that in mind, they then started saying there are multiple galaxies, but everyone will start in the same one.  He also has shown during the ""technology"" video how he can put in a sine wave function and the planet terrain changes.  This leads me to believe that it's possible that the ""galaxies"" each use a different seed and some could be quite abstract.  Again, you're probably right... but unless they've specifically said that the same seed is used for each galaxy, I conjecture that different seeds are possible."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3d9ey2,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:10:29 2015 UTC,"It's a single seed, because that's what gives us the number of 18 quintillion planets, or whatever it is. That's a sure thing.  But it's not the seed that matters- it's just a number. It's how it's elabotrated by the formulae that matters.  It is absolutely possible that they could have set different galaxies to contain much weirder lifeforms, just as they made the center of this galaxy have stranger contents than the rim. I'm just saying they can't add this variety after launch, because changing random gen parameters after launch would change every planet, even the already visited ones. Hence my observation that it would be taking away content from the ""main"" game."

When in the galactic map the lines connecting the dots (solar systems) shows you the extent you can travel based on your hyperdrive and fuel in your ships inventory. Â  So the fuel sits in your ships inventory, and in one interview he talks about how you'll have to balance your inventories a bit.  Your ship's invo has X amount of squares, in a square you can either store a resource, hyperdrive fuel, or install an upgrade. Â  We know we can buy and sell fuel, but I am unclear if we can craft it.  And if we can (which I hope so), will we start with the blueprint or have to find/buy it down the road?"

It could be that warping between stars takes all the fuel and you have to find resources. Or it depends on the size of your warp drive.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dan2v,kkuj72,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:36:26 2015 UTC,"Every demo seems to have unlimited warp ability.   Yes, most demo warps have been in dev mode in which they zoom through the galaxy for at least 15 seconds before selecting a planet 100+ lightyears away.   Plus we don't know how far warps go.   The navigation maps we see when they initially ""zoom out"" from the ship to the galaxy view show some solar systems connected by lines indicating the warp range of the ship.  That group of linked solar systems often looks like ~20 to me.  So my guess is that ships start out with ~1 light year warp range."

Youâd like to grab them so you can upgrade your shipâs hyper drive and explore yet more planets, but the oceanâs liquid is toxic and will kill you if you just dive in. So you note the coordinates and continue on your way, returning laterâsometimes much laterâwhen youâve upgraded your suit with the right protections.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dats1,StrangeYoungMan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:18:36 2015 UTC,the official wallpapers which were released not so long ago painted the Atlus as a shiny space station. Like the red glow was a reflection off a sun or something.  this makes me theorise that the pulsing left side of the pulse which you see in the link you provided above to be a pulsing star maybe about to go supernova or something.  pulsing stars confirmed?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dats1,MHasho,8,Wed Jul 15 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, really freaky ending that hints towards the Atlas playing a key role, possibly the antagonist.   Something tells me it's linked to the sentinels, possibly as their controller or creator.  Also gives off this vibe of ""I really want to play this game right now this very instant or else I will cry"""
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dats1,pacostacos7,3,Tue Jul 14 21:10:38 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the Atlas is like a BRAINIAC sort of computer. The entire galaxy is so far populated by AI and then lower life forms. Maybe the Atlas is the main antagonist and attacks us because it doesn't like us messing with its natural order, but wants us to just be observers and gathering all possible information for it. might lead to the fact that we're another AI that it created and sent out for scouting."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dats1,MHasho,4,Tue Jul 14 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"That's something I don't like thinking about just because it would leave such an evil taste in my mouth after finding out the truth.  It makes sense that the galaxy (at least, the starting galaxy) is governed by the Atlas. We know it's the central database that all our information is stored in, and the sentinels scanning creatures would indicate that they are similarly storing data like we are.   It seems to make sense; when we scan things and send them to the Atlas, we are rewarded and our wanted level disappears (so, discovering things is helping the Atlas).   If we shoot/destroy creatures and life, we anger the sentinels which possibly act for the Atlas, and are punished (destruction is opposing the Atlas).   So you're definitely right that the Atlas is a brainiac, it rewards us for giving it data.  Our scanning method seems different from the sentinels though... I just don't want to believe we're all robots ;-; that would be so sad."

There are some similarities in how the space structures look and that red dot is also slightly reminiscent of Hal 9000. Perhaps upon reaching the center we become the Atlas with all information only to release that there are then multiple dimensions and each with its own atlas and ""lore"" giving truly infinite possibilities?

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc413,ShiraCheshire,5,Wed Jul 15 03:56:11 2015 UTC,No it is not. Why would you not be able to build bases but build a colony? Also the main idea of the game is to explore and travel to the center of the galaxy. Colony building would kind of prevent players from wanting to see whats out there and instead hunker down and stay around one or a couple choice worlds checking on their progress.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc413,voodoopriest,2,Wed Jul 15 04:43:01 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc413,thinkadrian,3,Wed Jul 15 08:47:59 2015 UTC,"Discovery isn't just 'great'. It is the entire point of the game.    Why bother to gather resources so that you can upgrade your ship, your multitool and your suit? So that you can travel farther, dive deeper, defend yourself better, and survive to see even stranger new things. Exploration is the ultimate point of No Man's Sky.    Yes, you can be a trader, or a space pirate, you can follow emergency beacons and presumably rescue ships... you can mine and dig and do countless other activities. But what's it all for? Why bother?    Because there is always another planet out there, and it could be even more amazing than the last one. A new fleet. A new mystery.     Endless space exploration encapsulates everything else in the game - from being a pirate to trading honorably. It is the excitement and the glory and the purpose and the meaning.    In No Man's Sky, you can do anything you want. But when you do it, you will also be exploring new frontiers. You can't help it.     It's all unexplored."

So if they agreed that it was his idea and he's CEO, he likely owns 51%. Could also be 50/50, but it seems like he has final say on most decisions.

Why wouldn't they be allowed to talk more about the release date or other console releases?    release date- they were fairly far off at the time of the podcast (january). sean does not want to be put in a position of having to postpone the release date. also it could have been the agreement with sony to save said release date announcement till E3, which was when it was originally going to be announced. console exclusivity- imagine you are a xbox one fan and are really interested in no man's sky however you don't really want to shell out the money for a ps4 (or to build a computer). if you announced that it will be coming to xbox later down the road you might put off on getting a new console. resigning to the belief that ""i'll get it eventually on xbox"" however if you heard that there were no plans for a port, you might feel less confident, and would rather shell out the money for a ps4 and play the game, rather than boycott it entirely."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3dc328,Jaquishqa,2,Fri Jul 17 01:45:08 2015 UTC,"It seems kind of pointless to talk around it which basically confirms that, indeed, it will eventually come to XB1 (my guess is at least 6-12 months after PS4/PC), and that the game is likely in a releaseable state already or has been for some time. Sean has said that when the game is done they'll announce a release date and at E3 they were ready to do just that until the last minute when something changed those plans."

NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,lavaai,6,Tue Jul 14 22:10:52 2015 UTC,I think it actually shows the date. Guys? Confirm?
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,carminejr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:14:23 2015 UTC,We haven't seen dates for discoveries and Sean hasn't mentioned dates but we know you will be able to see other players' discoveries in Atlas.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,teaminus,2,Tue Jul 14 22:32:02 2015 UTC,Man. I could swear I saw a date somewhere... I'll let you know if I stumble across it
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,carminejr,6,Tue Jul 14 22:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw a date...  It was a fish!  I don't have the video, but I remember because I updated a wiki about it. Ictaloris Imenicu. 'Imenicu has a height of 1.79, weighs 778.45. It was first discovered on Wed Jul 01 17:17:08 2015 by Sean-E32015 on the planet Konangko in the system Re-Dhah' So whomever can find video of that discovery, or shortly thereafter, you'll see the date/time"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,Murrdogg,4,Tue Jul 14 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"It was when he was looking at his 'discoveries'.. he hovered over the fish icon, and that popped up. So I assume it'll be the same for planets?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,Murrdogg,3,Tue Jul 14 23:20:48 2015 UTC,It may have been in Sean's name. E3-2015 or something like that.

NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,teaminus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:22:11 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he mentioned something about date of discoveries Maybe I'm wrong or maybe it was personal discoveries.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,ItzToxiin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:48:04 2015 UTC,It's entirely possible I missed it. Post if you remember.
NoMansSkyTheGame,3db3nd,teaminus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:44:16 2015 UTC,"yeah, question is if you can see the date something you just scanned was discovered. not everything, but something you just attempted to discover. ""oh, someone else beat me to it? how late was i?"""
NoMansSkyTheGame,3daisu,Cameron_Sabo,11,Tue Jul 14 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"One persistent biome per planet. However that doesn't include caves, oceans etc... So there will be variety within that biome."
NoMansSkyTheGame,3daisu,Fractal_Curve,2,Tue Jul 14 19:49:16 2015 UTC,True
NoMansSkyTheGame,3daisu,carminejr,3,Tue Jul 14 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"nope, but we've heard quotes about there being one per planet!"

NoMansSkyTheGame,3daisu,wydraz,3,Tue Jul 14 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"They're more like variations on the same biome. Like desert, desert mountains, desert scrub. etc."
