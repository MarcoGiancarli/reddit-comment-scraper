led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,jeffray123,14,Thu Jul 16 02:52:45 2015 UTC,"I bet it never belonged to Jimmy, and someone is a fraud. Most non-diehard music fans wouldn't really bat an eye, I wouldn't think. Or maybe there was a mix-up with memorabilia and it belonged to some other guy."
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,Joshua9182998,5,Thu Jul 16 03:01:47 2015 UTC,I think you're correct that's supposed to be a 6 and 12 string.
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,suckitornot,7,Thu Jul 16 03:24:17 2015 UTC,Actually I just found out from the guy. (He was working down the street). It was an ibanez and not a Gibson. He had and brought it on tour but it was never used
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,Bongzillaz,5,Thu Jul 16 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"Well thats stupid! I knew something was off by the colour. Jimmy uses a Cherry Red Gibson EDS-1275 (which is 6/12 strings) and if I want to see a double neck guitar supposedly owned by Page I want to see that one!   What a rip, I'm calling shenanigans!"
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,xvvaev,4,Thu Jul 16 04:02:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a little disappointing but it was still cool too see such a unique guitar

led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,AmishAvenger,4,Thu Jul 16 05:05:46 2015 UTC,He claimed that instrument was owned by Jimmy Page and taken on tour with Led Zeppelin but never used?
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,doorpaint,3,Thu Jul 16 06:06:21 2015 UTC,That's what he said.
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,Bringitonhome17,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"Even if that's true, that's not what the plaque says."
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,Badger_Silverado,5,Thu Jul 16 07:14:00 2015 UTC,"Ibanez? Didn't Jimmy get it specially made by Gibson. Plus, Ibanez doesn't do SG bodies, I thought."
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,xvvaev,5,Thu Jul 16 04:26:28 2015 UTC,"Sort of, you're right that Jimmy had his special ordered. The Ibanez of the 70s was a very different company than the Ibanez of today. They mostly made copies of Gibsons and some fenders. This model was likely a cash-in on the popularity that Jimmy brought to this model."
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,doorpaint,2,Thu Jul 16 14:43:43 2015 UTC,This is what it is. I found the guy at a different store and asked him.
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,suckitornot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I have a red Ibanez copy of the EDS-1275 that I bought at a garage sale, with a traditional 12-string neck up top. Gibson actually made these with bass necks on top during the very early 60's so this is a replica of that. I'm pretty sure Ibanez made a production model of this; I've seen a couple since I got my double neck."
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,Dakunaa,3,Thu Jul 16 18:18:15 2015 UTC,Didn't notice this until you pointed it out. You're right. I know for a fact he played the double necked Gibson SG.
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,chequilla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:04:28 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you can't see the headstock well, I know Ibanez does the 2x3 pegs, but usually its the six in a row."
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,Badger_Silverado,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:06:44 2015 UTC,I know his starburst Les Paul was custom made so that the string configuration was similar to a violin. If you looked from that back of the instrument the strings would be bevel the D and G strings would be higher than the A and E and B and E.  As jimmy liked to play with a violin bow.
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,wtfblue,5,Thu Jul 16 22:41:56 2015 UTC,"That is definitely a bass guitar neck and headstock (4 tuners instead of 12).  Could still be used though. Even though Jimmy is famous for playing Stairway on this, it doesn't necessarily exclude him from using the guitar you saw (just makes it unlikely)."
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,bobbylewis222,5,Thu Jul 16 05:33:37 2015 UTC,I'm sure that 99+% of their 'memorabilia' is just random shit they bought and claimed a famous person owned.
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,voxshades,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, celebrities accrue a lot of guitars over the years, and I bet when Hard Rock says ""You wanna sell a guitar?"" and has a big pile of cash they had them some of piece of junk instead of a great and personal instrument. Although the NYC Hard Rock does have Iommi's ""Monkey SG"" those type of guitars are few and far between. The ""Keith Richards guitar"" advertised at the Pittsburgh Hard Rock is a busted Ovation acoustic. I've literally never seen Keith use an Ovation before."
led_zeppelin,3dgm8i,ShivasIrons983E,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:18 2015 UTC,Is that the Hard Rock in San Diego? I remember seeing that guitar there and feeling a skeptical as to its authenticity.

led_zeppelin,3d7uy3,smilingarmpits,-3,Tue Jul 14 19:57:18 2015 UTC,Night Flight is a great tune. Buckley demonstrates just how difficult and complex it is to sing. Plant's melodic structure is amazing but I don't think I have ever heard anyone say anything about this Physical Graffiti track as a stand alone comment. The song's guitar solo is renowned as is all Page's work with Zeppelin- but the vocals on this song to many are rather obscure. There is not a single vocalist in the market today who can touch Buckley's work - unless you go to R&B with the likes of Usher. But let's face it - blue eyed soul is souless and groups like arcade fire and green day simply is not really singing with any virtuosity at all.   Page would have loved to work with Buckley - an Page knows what he is talking about. The proof is in the pudding - so the saying goes.   Please remove your flair. It is obviously misplaced self-gloss.

There are tons and tons of bootlegs out there for the taking on the internet, and the quality of many are very questionable.  If you were to run across a bootleg or two in a used record shop the price you pay might not really be worth it, and you might make Jimmy Page cry a little.  Grab a few online so that you can make an informed decision if and when you find one for your turntable.  I don't see the point of paying for them these days, but if you have a case of collecteritis you wont listen to me anyway.  Happy hunting."

Honestly I got frustrated reading this article (especially the part about bootlegs) because he focused on solely on live performace bootlegs, which granted there are more of them out there; but what about the studio outtakes bootlegs? I know that there was a lot more stuff done and I thought it would have been neat to hear them recording the songs and screwing up (kind of like the Pet Sounds Sessions box set).  What about releasing the Royal Albert Hall on a live album? Other than the DVD, the bootlegs out there are terrible and if there were an offical release of the concert I would buy it in a heartbeat!  Other than that, Page has said he's going to be releasing new material and touring for the past couple of years now; perhaps he got distracted with the remasters but I'll definitely be buying any new material he releases and try to see him live if he's close by.  Edit: I was actually just thinking of Hendrix releases. Even though the Janie Hendrix is a money-sucking bitch, at least the Experience Hendrix estate has released a lot of Hendrix material, albeit rehashed and re-released stuff."

led_zeppelin,39qpfk,Earguy,7,Sun Jun 14 01:03:00 2015 UTC,"Trusting my memory here, so I could be totally wrong...reports were that it was the 1977 tour that Page's heroin use was really impacting the band.  JPJ essentially became the musical director of the band, and the glue that held the live shows together, preventing them from completely falling apart.  It's possible that putting the bass higher in the mix may be at JPJ's request, or a necessity for the gig to work.  Based on these stories I've heard, it makes it even sadder that Plant and Page excluded JPJ when P&P toured in the 90s.  How about a little appreciation?"
led_zeppelin,39qpfk,Earguy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:24:02 2015 UTC,"My thinking is that P&P toured arenas, but a reunited Led Zeppelin could have done a new album and played stadiums."
led_zeppelin,39qpfk,andyman2012,4,Sun Jun 14 05:45:55 2015 UTC,This seems very possible. I know that page was really sloppy and it was definitely possible that they used Jones to cover up.
led_zeppelin,39qpfk,Solitude-Is-Bliss,3,Sun Jun 14 13:13:46 2015 UTC,"I think not including JPJ in the Plant/Page group was more complicated then just not wanting to give him a cut.  See, if they had JPJ in the band, they would almost certainly have had to call it a Zeppelin reunion and recruit Jason Bonham.  Also, any new tracks they created would have had to be Zeppelin tunes.  I think that Plant and Page simply wanted to work together without all the baggage that LZ brought to the table.  Besides, they had worked on each others solo albums before and in the Honeydrippers (and XYZ, for a brief time), so they had a good working relationship established outside of LZ.    I don't think they were deliberately trying to screw JPJ, although his joke at the RNRHOL induction about they finally remembering his phone number was pretty funny and on point, I believe Plant and Page simply wanted the project they had together to be about whatever they wanted to play and not completely Zeppelin focused.  Obviously, with both of them in the same band, Zeppelin loomed large always, but they wanted to minimize that effect in order to concentrate on the music they wanted to play at the time.  At least that's my take on it."
led_zeppelin,39qpfk,GwonamLord,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:58:52 2015 UTC,"This was my take on it as well until I realized that the majority of their live set list is Led Zeppelin, I mean Micheal Lee was playing a Ludwig set and everything.  I think the reason for them not inviting JPJ is based on his personality, I've always felt like JPJ never had a big connection to the rest of the band in terms of friendship compared to the other three members."
led_zeppelin,39qpfk,baccaruda66,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:25:57 2015 UTC,Jimmy was falling apart on that tour.   Listen to gigs like Tempe (shudder) and the aborted Chicago show for instance.
led_zeppelin,39qpfk,baccaruda66,7,Sun Jun 14 17:00:28 2015 UTC,It probably has more to do with the location of the bootleg mic.

led_zeppelin,39qpfk,jbob145,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:32:06 2015 UTC,"It's still probably mic location. LZ bootlegs were a challenge to obtain and people had to settle for what they could get away with, using the equipment of the time.

Granted there are some high schoolers that play like 30 year old but it was too precise, boxed up and tense. Jazz is meant to be expressive and the rules can be bent. No real dynamics in these renditions. Intonation was decent. I wouldn't  call them shitty but it was pretty rough.

The prices are a bit high too ($162.26 each). Hopefully they will go down. I think Amazon got screwed a little with pre-orders on the previous releases, pricing them too low at first. I pre-ordered the other Super Deluxes all around $112-120 but the price at release was $130-160.  EDIT: Sorry, I just assumed you wanted the Super Deluxe boxes like I do.

led_zeppelin,37moml,IThinkTheClockIsSlow,1 point,Fri May 29 03:02:05 2015 UTC,"This just dropped in my email from the official Ledzep site with info on pre-ordering:  Deluxe editions of Led Zeppelinâs final three studio albums: Presence, In Through The Out Door, and Coda will be released in July. As with the previous deluxe editions, all three have been newly remastered by guitarist and producer Jimmy Page and are accompanied by companion audio comprised of previously unreleased music related to the original release selected and compiled by Page.  Originally released in 1976, Presence was recorded during a whirlwind 18-day session at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The albumâwhich peaked at #1 in both the U.S. and UK and was certified triple platinumâcrackles with energy on Zeppelin classics like âNobodyâs Fault But Mineâ and âAchilles Last Standâ and delivers powerful jolts of the group at its visceral best.  The companion audio disc that accompanies Presence has five unreleased reference mixes from the sessions, which reveal works in progress. Along with alternate incarnations of âFor Your Life,â âAchilles Last Stand,â and âRoyal Orleans,â there is also the previously unheard instrumental curiously titled â10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod (Pod).â  On its release in the summer of 1979, In Through The Out Door topped the U.S. and UK album charts and has since been certified six-times platinum. Sadly, it would be the last album that Led Zeppelin recorded prior to drummer John Bonhamâs passing the following year. Among the seven album tracks are âFool In The Rain,â and âAll My Love,â two songs that remain rock radio staples to this day.  The albumâs companion audio disc features an unreleased rough mix of every track from the original album, including early versions with working titles such as âThe Hookâ (âAll My Loveâ), âThe Epicâ (âCarouselambraâ), and âBlotâ (âIâm Gonna Crawlâ).  The appropriately titled Coda was Led Zeppelinâs final album of studio recordings. Released in 1982, it was comprised of eight unreleased tracks recorded between 1970 and 1978. It peaked at #6 on the album charts and has been certified platinum in the U.S.  The reissue campaign ends with a double-barrel blast of Led. Coda will be the only Led Zeppelin deluxe edition to include two companion discs, featuring 15 tracks recorded between 1968 and 1974. The oldest song in the collection is also perhaps the most interesting. The frenetic blues jam âSugar Mamaâ was recorded in 1968 at Olympic Studios during sessions for the bandâs eponymous debut. The song was completed but never officially released until now. âBaby Come On Homeâ from the same session is also included in the set. Also included is the previously unreleased âSt. Tristanâs Sword,â a rollicking instrumental recorded during the Led Zeppelin III sessions in 1970.  In 1972, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page took a fabled trip to India to perform with the Bombay Orchestra and now, for the first time, recordings from these sessions will be officially released with dynamic takes on âFriendsâ and âFour Handsâ (âFour Sticksâ from Led Zeppelin IV). Among the many other highlights featured here is an early version of âWhen The Levee Breaksâ from 1970 titled âIf It Keeps On Rainingâ; rough mixes of âThe Wanton Songâ and âIn The Light,â from the Physical Graffiti sessions at Headley Grange, the latter a different alternate version than the one included in the Physical Graffiti deluxe edition; and an instrumental mix of âPoor Tomâ from 1970."

On the topic of SIBLY: I don't know why no recordings exist. It's as if everyone stopped their tape recorders at the same time, in sync, much like how TSRTS was filmed that resulted in the need for re-shoots. Even audience recordings have yielded no results. It's just plain odd that no one got it.  If I'm not mistaken though, I don't think the entire song was played, just a rough draft or elements that were incorporated somewhere else. But that doesn't make sense either, the 'elements' don't appear on the other songs that are on the DVD and all bootlegs. It would have to be a full, if not rough, performance. I would absolutely love if SIBLY appeared someday, it's my favourite song ever."

That's where the vast majority of soundboards and outtakes come from, if I recall correctly. The Led Zeppelin II multitracks have their own interesting story behind them. Allegedly, a private collector found them, and offered them for sale. A prospective buyer wanted a sample first. The collector gave him the vocals, bass, and guitar of Ramble On, on the condition that if the sample was leaked, the deal was off. Needless to say, the deal didn't go through, and the collector has those precious tapes to this day. This happened around 2007 or so, I'm pretty sure."

led_zeppelin,32nn69,TellYouTheName,20,Wed Apr 15 06:02:40 2015 UTC,"On May 11, 1974, Led Zeppelin attended (Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Bonham) Elvis Presley's evening concert at the Los Angeles Forum. During the concert, Elvis stopped a song and jokingly said: 'Wait a minute... If we can start together fellas, because we've got Led Zeppelin out there... let's try to look like we know what we're doing, whether we do or not'.  Their mutual promoter at the time, Jerry Weintraub, took Jimmy Page and Robert Plant up to Presley's Las Vegas hotel suite. For the first few minutes, Elvis ignored them.  Jimmy Pageâwho had first picked up a guitar after hearing 'Baby Let's Play House' on overseas radioâbegan to fidget. What was going on? Did he really want to meet them? Should they say something? Elvis finally turned to them. 'Is it true', he said, 'these stories about you boys on the road?' Plant answered, 'Of course not. We're family men. I get the most pleasure out of walking the hotel corridors, singing your songs'. Plant offered his best Elvis impersonation. 'Treat me like a fool, treat me mean and cruuuuel, but looooove me...'. For a moment Elvis Presley eyed them both very carefully. Then he burst out laughing. Then his bodyguards burst out laughing. For two hours he entertained them in his suite. He had never heard their records, he said, except for when his stepbrother played him 'Stairway to Heaven'. 'I liked it', said Presley. Later, walking down the hallway from the hotel room, Page and Plant congratulated themselves on a two-hour meeting with the King. 'Hey', came a voice from behind them. Presley had poked his head out the door. 'Treat me like fooool...'.    http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/music/led_zeppelin_meet_elvis.html"

People always say that Stairway to Heaven is the archetypal Led Zeppelin song, probably because of how popular and great it is. But I dont really think Stairway is the best representative of Led Zeppelin as a whole. At least to me, songs like Dazed and Confused have much more ""Led Zeppelin"" feel to them."
led_zeppelin,325ho7,jeffray123,3,Fri Apr 10 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"YESYESYESYSEs Dazed and confused represents it so well because it has all of the defining factors of led zeppelin.

led_zeppelin,325ho7,ChaosRedux,8,Sat Apr 11 14:54:24 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Page would agree with you. In an interview he was once asked how he felt about Stairway to Heaven being the defining Zepp song, and he responded that it isn't - Kashmir is.   I think the main point is that Stairway has a huge appeal across a broad range of listeners, regardless of whether or not they like rock music and/or Led Zeppelin. Kashmir as a song is so indelibly... Zeppelin."

led_zeppelin,325ho7,smilingarmpits,3,Tue Apr 14 06:45:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the one, at least to my understanding.

Bonzo shows how is right foot is faster than a cheetah on steroids and how plant can sing the blues perfectly.

Also it should have been waayyy longer, it was only an hour an a half, i think it should've been at least two hours. I also noticed everyone got face shots quite often except for JPJ, and while hes not the most interesting guy, he can really play the fucking bass. the only thing i took out of the footage was, ""Holy shit JPJ is really fucking good."" and not the movies fault but my theater played it way too low. i dont think people would have minded if it were a bit louder... its a zeppelin movie for god sake.

led_zeppelin,30399c,al_leight,3,Tue Mar 24 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"i honestly think this might be my favorite album of all time. the heavy parts are at their heaviest( not ""metal"" but deep like Since I've Been Loving You, Stairway); the soft, sincere, deep parts art at their sincerest (That's the Way, Going to California); the jam sessions are note for note perfect on all accounts (Whole Lotta Love, Dazed and Confused); and when they want to be fun and light hearted (WIAWSNB, Dancing Days, Bron Y Aur Stomp) they're at their peak.  And i don't think it gets better than Plant's vocals before he changed his style on Over the Hills and Far Away."

Second, one of the main reasons he doesn't want to tour even though the other guys do is because he is the singer. Singing ability deteriorates much more noticeably and quickly than guitar playing ability. Plant knows that he wouldn't be able to keep up with a whole tour wailing the way he used to. He doesn't want to perform songs that require such intense vocals because he knows he won't do them justice.   Either way, who the fuck are you to criticize what he chooses to pursue? He had an amazing run with LZ and now he's moved on to other things."

It's played with much more urgency, really shows JPJ's skill on the keyboard and how insanely tight the band's rhythm section is, features a great rave up guitar solo, samples other Zep tunes, and is overall just a dangerously funky song that blows the already terrific studio version out of the water.

Led Zeppelin doesnât play here after the âfunny jail incidentâ that Plant references at a Page/Plant show in the 90âs. But the Sunday newspaper has an ad for LZ in St. Louis with mail order tickets. So wtf, why not? We mail in for tickets and holy shit, we get them! St. Louis Checkerdome! January, 1975! We get in my 1969 Toyota Corolla and drive the four hours to St. Lou, planning on staying with my buddy at Webster U. Itâs a long fucking drive and my car sucks so it takes longer than we thought. We go straight to the show to see on the marquee âLed Zeppelin Postponed.â FUCK! Are you kidding? We crash at Webster anyway and itâs weird.  Show is rescheduled for February. My buddyâs brother works for a car rental place so he gives us a car. âRun away if you wreck itâ he says. So we drive in a Chrysler with fine Corinthian leather instead of my POS. This time they play and holy shit! Highlights for me was an unbelievable Kashmir and a jammed out Heartbreaker. One of the best shows of my young life. Tons of stuff from Physical Graffiti. They brought it. We made it back to KC with the Chrysler and no incidents. Saw them again in â77 in St. Louis, but thatâs another story. In â75 I had seen a ton of shows but LZ easily topped them all. Good times, good times."

led_zeppelin,2y573a,zeppconcert,3,Fri Mar 6 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"First of all there was no opening act. Also remember there was no youtube. If you have never been to a concert you probably only saw Led Zeppelin in pictures in magazines. There was only one film that would play at indie cinema - you know the Dazed And Confused from Danish TV?  So in 1975 you did not know what you were going to experience. I had great seats in a huge Basketball Arena in a Major city in the States. If you were a Zep fan you would have been excited. I knew all the LPs deeply so this was like Christmas for me.   The first thing I found so amazing was how fucking loud and clear the PA system was. I had seen other bands like Elton, The Who ... but I think the first sound was Bonzo testing the snare drum and it was all anyone could think about. It was that loud. Then the band kicked in and you were truly in sonic heaven and awe.   Every song was amazing. It seemed like Page was a magician in a circus as he pulled out one magical riff - one after the other. There were rumors he was into occult stuff and when you saw and heard that magic in person it made you a believer. In the context of 1975 there were not many bands with just one guitar. The Who was excellent but Page is a virtuoso. And immediately you were driven into an irresistible groove because they had a locked groove. They were incredibly funky for a white British rock band. It was surreal.   The shows were intentionally long and well defined as to what was going on. The Moby Dick drum solo was strange and long. It seemed inviting to wander around the audience a bit as there was no dancing on stage.   I think they played about 3 and 1/2 hours. They were no doubt the best band on earth for hard rock.   Unfortunately the days of Led Zep are over. No bands release LPs without their name on the cover. Even if they are big - there is too much music saturation these days. The problem with music today is it is a business. Back then LZ was ""radical."" The idea of using bone crunching riffs to sell Cadillac to old white people was just ridiculous. Now LZ sounds like generic rock because it has been copied and copied and emulated for 35 or so years. If you hear a rock band today they have so many elements of LZ on purpose. While LZ was creating these sounds as experiments. Sorry there is very little good new music these days. It is all just copied from 20 or 30 years ago. It has no value. Not one original idea. No more guitar masters making iconic riff LP after LP that will stand the test of time. At least there are still great vital movies being made that have some relevance to life.   This is a throw-away account because I wanted to say plainly how I felt without any flack. All the youngsters who listen to Kings Of Leon or Mumford And Sons are listening to parrot artists. They have no vision. They simply copy.   Back to Led Zep concert. The acoustic set was something to behold. There seemed to be constant re-interpretation and constant improvisation. And always the humor of Plant. He was the MC and he would get sentimental for a bit - but always having a good time. The sounds were their ""statement."" I am not sure you can find a band today that actually makes as much a-tonal , avant-garde NOISE! Jimmy and his violin bow running through that PA with all the FX and panning and switching was pure noise art. If you listen to the single ""Whole Lotta Love"" the middle bit has a theremin and it makes lots of noise. The whole mid section is strange moaning, squeaks, and stuff with Bonzo's hit-hat keeping the beat. Fuck. - can you imagine a top 40 record with noise today? No. That is part of what I am trying to say. In context of 1975 this band was exploring multiple genre of music. Blues, folk, middle eastern, classical, - just incredible genius. And you quickly heard in the opening song that each of them were masters of their instrument.   A re-union is simply novelty. It would be nice but it would be better simply to listen to the stuff on youtube. As far as I can remember they sounded like this live. But you need to listen through a stereo and crank up the bass. The bass drum rattled your bones.   If you want to get a deep feel for their concerts - first listen to Dazed and Confused from the first LP - then listen to the other live version. See how the song is still D'n'C but totally remade into a new live version. So much brilliant improvisation. This stuff makes G'n'R seem like a joke. It makes Smashing Pumpkins seem elementary. Just remember you can learn to play like Mumford and Sons in 2 or less years if you really practice. But who could teach you the timing of these dramatic live performances by LZ? Nobody, nowhere, nohow.  All the guitar players with their pedal boards are making MKII clones to try and sound like Page. It is understandable but silly. You can't play like Page because you have his gear.   Wrong generation? maybe not if you seek out new arts. The great thing about internet is you can find all kinds of new music - but it is not popular. But you are better off listening to something new that is not popular - than some pop crap.   Actually the live version I linked is a bit clearer than they actually sounded. If you can hook your computer up to an stereo - listen to this LOUD and you get a better feel how the drums sounded and led the grooves.   Rock on!"

The air was thick with pot smoke, so much that bands counted on it to enhance the light show.  Lots of sharing pot with strangers, puff puff pass.  And then there were the Quaaludes.  They were quite popular at the time.  I got caught up in that scene.  I remember one concert where I was so stoned I felt like my spine was jelly.  Then, I saw The Who on speed.  It was so much better!  Never again did I get stoned for concerts.  Most of the time I'd stay straight, not even beer, which would make you have to piss during the show, and lose your place."

They have some great songs with classic riffs and memorable lyrics. And they put on a good show when I saw them play back in the day.

And as an ensemble, they had the power and the ballads required of a top Rock band, but they never quite mastered the nuance and fluidity that Zep did . . ."

The arrangement and material of the songs is different. In the case of Zep, the band plays together in a song, and most of the songs are about some kind of interaction with others. Everything can be heard and melds together extremely well. The Who's writing material is more introspective, and the members to play against or around each other, almost fighting for the attention of the listener."

led_zeppelin,2xvecn,SambaLando,3,Wed Mar 4 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"I think most jealousy came from their path to success and how quickly they found success. Without really selling out and even with their demands of record companies and concert promoters (that benefited everyone) they still were able to be successful where a lot of the other bands might have felt cheated after they saw what Zeppelin was able to ""get away with"".  Also stylistically Zeppelin was very hard and heavy stuff for the time and for that kind of success and mass acceptance now would be similar to someone like Slipknot outselling Taylor Swift.  Also if Zeppelin has sold 250M albums Vs. The Who's 100M.....there is that."

Hmm...what are the odds?  It couldn't possibly have anything to do with jealousy.  Nope, not a chance!    The fact is, the people have spoken.  Led Zeppelin is best-selling album group in U.S. history, and even though I'm a Who, Stones and Jeff Beck fan, I shudder a little when I hear one of them say things like this.  I honestly don't understand how the creator of Who's Next doesn't like Zeppelin IV or Physical Graffiti.  It's just suspicious, I don't know."

While Jason may achieve a better technical proficiency, the genius is in creation.   It's much the same with Hendrix and Page: While some might be technically proficient(doubt it in Page's case), the creativity of both artists means that you'll do not much but step on their toes in one form or another."

led_zeppelin,2xn2u0,SirTopenhat,5,Mon Mar 2 07:27:27 2015 UTC,"I could go on for a while but I'll keep it short. And know people may disagree with me and that's fine. This is my opinion as someone that's been playing drums for a while and grew up listening to Zeppelin.   First and foremost, Jason does not have the ""feel"" that John did. John was a master at teetering on the back edge of the beat. When John played a simple rock beat it was just so fucking groovy! John was also known for being able to play the kick like castanets. It's sometimes hard to pick up on unless you know what your listening to because he played it so blisteringly fast. I have never seen Jason throw these in to the songs like John could.  There is more I could go on with but I think those two points are big ones. But I will finish by saying that John looked like he was having the time of his life while playing, while Jason dresses and looks like a total douchebag. à² _à² "

led_zeppelin,2xn2u0,Earguy,4,Mon Mar 2 07:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, Jason certainly ""wails"". But that's not what made John a great drummer, it was his subtlety and restraint more than anything else. And they were both fat-asses...but who fucking care about that."

led_zeppelin,2xn2u0,357Jimmy,3,Mon Mar 2 08:08:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say Jason may be a better tecnician, but John was an innovator, the creator of an entire new sound and style."
led_zeppelin,2xn2u0,Dakunaa,2,Mon Mar 2 23:58:00 2015 UTC,"I feel sorry for Jason. I think (as a drummer) that all drummers are different, and it is wrong to compare any 2 drummers. It is obvious that Jason and John have different styles and techniques, it this doesn't mean that one is better than the other. Jason is constantly put under the light of his dad (a drummer which no one can live up to) and people get disappointed when Jason isn't as good as John. I think both drummers are absolutely amazing in their own unique and individual ways. Neither of those drummers is better than the other. Keep in mind that I am a drummer, and have googled and researched everything there is to know about Jason and John, and seen both of them play in countless concerts and studio recordings."

Making each post(new album day post) sticky might have helped & leaving each post for a few days up there for visibilty so more people might comment & lastly voting of songs could've have been better like using a google doc & making each person just choose 3 songs.

Part of the problem, (besides Jimmy being mostly out of it at that point in their career) is on the record it is so layered with the different guitar parts, and there is really no way to do that live with a four piece.  Having said that, this is probably one of the better live versions I've heard, but the mix is awful."

led_zeppelin,2xch60,PleaseBmoreCharming,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:28:22 2015 UTC,I think a full CD is good.
led_zeppelin,2xch60,themikeysteve,1 point,Fri Feb 27 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"A CD of music would be around 18% of all the Zeppelin studio albums plus Coda. On average one out of every 5 and 1/2 songs would make the cut. That's not very many, but the impact of such a CD would be tremendous, especially for a Led Zeppelin neophyte. We must consider the neophytes.   Edit: I would be cool with dividing a CD of songs into four album sides of around twenty minutes each, give or take a minute or so. Maybe by doing so, the chosen songs would reveal a hidden order."

led_zeppelin,2x9wzt,NoMoreKarmaHere,4,Thu Feb 26 23:19:15 2015 UTC,"There should be one CD, or 80 minutes of music. We want only the best of the best. That way I could give my 18 year old son a link to it, and expect him to be well and truly blown away.  The next step should be a poll. Each redditor should then submit a list of songs, ordered from number one down to number 17. I guess it would not be all that difficult to limit each reddit account to on Top-17 list.   Someone should keep track of each submitted list and assign 17 points for each number one vote, 16 points for each number two, etc. If Jimmy Page himself votes, it would be appropriate, I think, to assign him all the votes. A simple spreadsheet would do. I would be glad to keep track of the voting if nobody else wants to do it.   I would suggest limiting voting to the canon of studio albums plus Coda. Allowing other outtakes and live cuts, etc. could lead to duplication of a song at the expense of others. I can imagine a result of Dazed and Confused from LZ I and from The Song Remains the Same or BBC being voted onto the album and, say, Four Sticks along with a few others missing the cut as a result. Including only studio cuts (plus Coda) would eliminate the possibility of duplication, and help keep the album concise.   Edit: I would suggest the title LZ 129."

It was very interesting to hear Page describe his approach to pushing the boundaries of known music in the studio, and working on the ""edge of a precipice"" live.  During the interview, to hear Page spin some tunes from HIS influences was insightful into the object of Led Zeppelin in the studio, what atmosphere and raw feeling Page was trying to achieve. At this he and his band mates succeeded wildly. Also this reminded me of the scene in It Might Get Loud where Page played air guitar to the Link Wray tune Rumble: pure musical bliss and Guitar Idols all the way down."

led_zeppelin,2x110a,LedGibsun,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"I'm telling you right now, there is not going to be any more live material. Jimmy has described these companion disks as a means to listen to how they wrote/created the songs for each album. Live material only sufficed for LZ 1(2014) because there was not any ""working"" material to put on there."
led_zeppelin,2x110a,PleaseBmoreCharming,2,Tue Feb 24 21:08:45 2015 UTC,"I hoping for an alternate version of Achilles Last Stand!! Something where it's really different, yet still just as great. Like the alt. version of Since I've Been Loving You.  ...A guy can dream, can't he?"
led_zeppelin,2x110a,PleaseBmoreCharming,2,Tue Feb 24 23:10:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldt hold out for anything ground breaking. I assume itnwill all be alternate versions and alternate mixes up until Coda, which will probably have Swan Song, HHWCID, etc. Page had expressed his concern when he got to Presence, as he didn't think he had anything for it, as the album was recorded and mixed in 18(?) days. He said he stumbled over old reference mixes.  Again, don't hold your breath for anything ground breaking on Presence and ITTOD."
led_zeppelin,2x110a,RPDC,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:12:06 2015 UTC,Even the best producers would have a hard time making Hot Dog a good song...
led_zeppelin,2x110a,jeffray123,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:55:45 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I do agree with PleaseBmoreCharming and RPDC : the future companion discs will probably not include live material or unreleased gems. I think we will get a bunch of alternate mixes, early versions and instrumentals.  Will we eventually get live tracks from the 1975 and 1977 US tour? Nobody knows, except maybe Mr. Page. It's a bit disappointing, because all Zepheads would be happy to hear live renditions of 'Dazed and Confused' or 'No Quarter' from that era on official releases. Not to mention 'Kashmir' or 'In My Time of Dying'. 'DVD' was interesting but Earl's Court and Knebworth shows were not the best Zeppelin's performances.  Nevertheless, some early studio versions are interesting, like 'Everybody Makes It Through', so if Jimmy releases tracks like that for Presence and ITTOD, I'll be pleased."

led_zeppelin,2wq35c,woodard2112,15,Sun Feb 22 03:06:44 2015 UTC,The character is called The Hermit. It's from the Rider-Waite deck of tarot cards.
led_zeppelin,2wq35c,Victor3000,15,Sun Feb 22 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"The figure of the hermit holding the lantern, in occult circles, usually stands for the journey, attainment, and bestower of knowledge. He is usually pictured on a higher surface (cliff face, top of mountain) to show he has reached the pinacle of his journey. His journey is the attainment of knowledge. (The light in the lantern is a symbol of knowledge, ie. Phosphorus) the metaphor is, you see the hermit's light atop the mountain illuminating the way to the top. You struggle   up the mountain and work hard to reach the top by following the light the hermit is shedding (usually in pictures everything is darker or in shadow and the lantern or light the hermit holds up, to light the way, is depicted as the brightest point in the picture), only to realize when you get there only the light is there and you have now become the hermit, taking up the mantle of the illuminator. (Having attained the knowledge, you now are the light bearer). Jimmy is a well known occult enthusiast and he likes to put symbolism in a lot of what he did and does. Hope this helps :)"

led_zeppelin,2wq35c,ukrainiancigarette,2,Sun Feb 22 03:10:18 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking he's supposed to be a figure from Norse mythology, as Led Zeppelin were/are quite fond of it. They reference it in a few songs.  Anyway, some quick research has revealed that Odin was sometimes described as an old, hooded man with one eye. So the image may be Odin, or possibly a more obscure character of Norse mythology."
led_zeppelin,2wmpil,xMusi,5,Sat Feb 21 05:31:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like they do sound better. Volume levels are far better than any other Zeppelin release I've heard. Clarity is a close second.

I can't really tell the difference.  I actually wrote a computer program a few years ago to do a double blind study on myself of MP3 at 128/192/256 and FLAC.  I consistently got the 128 as worst but it looked random for the others.  Growing up as a kid in the 80's my Dad had tons of vinyl.  Been there, done that, not interested.  I play my retro video games on an emulator too, not the original console.  Sue me.  I do enjoy listening to the alternate takes and looking through the books at all the pictures."

led_zeppelin,2w8y1j,Earguy,3,Wed Feb 18 04:04:39 2015 UTC,Back in the 1970s this b-side got airplay attention and I rushed right out and bought the 45.  Still have it.  I sang it at parties where we'd all sit around and play guitars and sing.

I get enough of Immigrant Song when I listen to LZ III (Which is a lot since it's my favorite album). I feel like this would have better replaced Hats Off to Roy Harper. I like that song, but maybe it was better of as a b-side."
led_zeppelin,2w4a2f,scaryketchup,10,Mon Feb 16 21:23:54 2015 UTC,To me this song sounds like a combination of Moby Dick and The Ocean.

led_zeppelin,2vzxmi,k0mbine,2,Mon Feb 16 02:38:56 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm just thinking synth as in keyboard synth. Could it be Jimmy playing guitar thru a synth (also like his roland g-707 used on Death Wish), sure I can hear that. The overdubs were done in 82 so it would be around the same time. But the overdubs kinda sound like some of the guitar stuff on the recently released song 'La La' which was recorded in April 69 before Jimmy was messing with guitar synths (they hadn't been invented yet)."

led_zeppelin,2vll9q,PleaseBmoreCharming,7,Thu Feb 12 00:44:29 2015 UTC,"Yet another disappointing ""bonus track"". Giving the song a different name is an insult considering it's the exact same song we all know, and the only difference is switching the mix of the guitar and the drum.  I think these tracks have been remastered well and sound great. But so far, outside of the debut, I have no incentive to buy the deluxe editions and get these sad bonus tracks."
led_zeppelin,2vll9q,OpabiniaGlasses,6,Thu Feb 12 06:32:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. When the Beatles Anthology came out in the 90's there were all kinds of early sketches of songs, fragments of ideas and dramatically different alternate takes.   I love Zeppelin, but most of the bonus tracks on these reissues are just slightly remixed versions of the original releases, or the original track without the vocals. True, there are some live cuts on Zeppelin I, and ""Jennings Farm Blues"" on Zeppelin III, but the rest of the stuff is pretty underwhelming."

I don't know man, The Rain Song was a disappointment to me, but Trampled I found it pretty cool. Sounds less ""confined"", more spaced - I didn't think the album cut was so much overdubbed! Robert sounds much more upfront, too, which the track (or 50% Physical Graffiti) needed. The rough mix features no guitar or organ overdubs or ""woooos"" - it sounds really fresh IMO. We'll see the album cuts.  Also, In The Light would be a cool candidate for next advance."

The version of No Quarter on the original 1976 album is simply amazing, one of the best bits of live Led Zep you'll ever hear.  It's a shame Jimmy Page butchered the remaster of it.

I read somewhere that this song was a response to critics and fans saying that Zeppelin doesn't ""rock out"" anymore, and they said this because of Led Zeppelin III being half acoustic.

It was at the National Guitar Summer Workshop I went to probably in 1988. Whenever I hear this song I think of that.

At the same time though, the ending makes you want more, and I think that helps make the song so great. The only thing I would say I dislike is the pause at the beginning. Jimmy Page wrote it while with the Yardbirds."

I don't know how to put this in non-guitar talk but I will try.  Page really seems to love things out of D.  He loves starting and ending there with a bunch of riffs in between.  If you want to check it out listen to ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", ""Thank You"" and ""Tangerine"".  It is not every song but definitely in these three."

Also even when he is in normal uninformed he has like 5 other guitar overdubs and layers so who knows what he tubes them to. Look at the tuning for Bron y aur it's so odd."

With the Rover and Custard Pie being some of the best true rock n roll songs. The second lp they rebuild you with a softer side. Its more acoustic and akin to a true successor to III. The only thing I dislike about PG is the omission of Swan Song. I think its Jimmy's best song. If you care download the outakes to PG. Its absolutely wonderful.

I'm on mobile and can't link, but you guys should youtube the isolated vocals track for this song. It's pretty cool to hear plant blasting his pipes with no other sounds.   I think my favorite part in the song is right before plant goes ""Ohh sometimes I grow so tired"" there is some sort of instrument on a little turnaround/walk down thing. I really don't know he proper terminology. It could be a synthesizer or guitar or something else. To me though, that short phrase is a good example of perfect design.

led_zeppelin,2tc2s5,warvibe24,1 point,Thu Jan 22 22:27:19 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that the 16 notes you hear throughout the song is Bonzo smacking on one of Jimmies guitar cases. Obviously mastered to sound a little more flat.
led_zeppelin,2tc2s5,1859,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"I've heard a few theories about that initial clicking, about what Bonzo is hitting: a plastic bucket, his thighs, a guitar case. After years of listening and wondering, I really think he's hitting his thighs, probably though a pair of jeans.  ... Not the weirdest reddit comment I've written, but it's up there."
led_zeppelin,2tc2s5,watchingwombat,2,Sun Jan 25 16:09:04 2015 UTC,"There is a great remix of this which is well worth hearing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytjGo5QqK7Q.  He's done a really good job modernising it but not losing all the feeling.  And to echo the comment about the isolated tracks, it's great to hear how sensitive and delicate the vocals are.  Wonderful."

led_zeppelin,2t9s8y,k0mbine,1 point,Thu Jan 22 14:54:18 2015 UTC,The one that was added the 5th. We loved it. I think I paid $ 10.00 for the ticket. The last Ad was done by Q-102 FM in Dallas. Seeing my favorite band for the first time was great.

led_zeppelin,2t7no3,scaryketchup,7,Wed Jan 21 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"This song kind of reflects the different styles of music that Zeppelin is capable of. Its mellow and also upbeat and full of energy. I think its definitely one of the best on the album, if not the best."
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,EvolutionX2,5,Wed Jan 21 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, I love this song. You have the subtle acoustic at the beginning and then the. Jimmy kicks in with that awesome guitar riff. Then you have that funky solo. The song is just awesome. That's why I love led zeppelin."
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,CamelLoggins,4,Wed Jan 21 21:52:17 2015 UTC,"Somehow failing to get into the US top 50 after being released as a single, OTHAFA is now a radio staple. Plant found it hard to sing the increasingly complex melody lines, but he did have a passion for Celtic Mythology."
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,troutbum37,2,Wed Jan 21 22:06:21 2015 UTC,This has been my 'skip list for a while now. TOO much radio play which usually doesn't happen for me.
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,flaccidflopper,2,Thu Jan 22 01:19:47 2015 UTC,Perhaps my favourite Led Zeppelin song. Absoluetly beautiful guitar riff to start the song and the point where the electric guitar comes in is just magnificent. IMO truly one if Zep's most beautiful songs.
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,tinglethefairy,1 point,Thu Jan 22 07:09:18 2015 UTC,"Just listened to this album today for this song. I see a lot of you saying it's a little overplayed on the radio, but if you step away from it for a while it's phenomenal when you come back. Especially in the context of the album: After the hard and fast Song Remains the Same and the quiet, calm (and then not so calm and then calm again) Rain Song, Over the Hills carries the acoustic bits over and then slams you back into Zeppelin II (only to go into The Crunge to freak everyone out again).  For some reason I had never really heard the bass in the intro acoustic section but damn if it isn't some amazing finger work by JPJ."
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,PimJag,2,Thu Jan 22 03:34:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the intro is just 2 acoustic guitars. The bass comes in at the same time as the drums.

led_zeppelin,2t7no3,Dakunaa,1 point,Sat Jan 24 22:22:51 2015 UTC,It's a nice song. I think it would be better without the acoustic solo bits (the notes you hear right at the start).
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,masonlodge,10,Wed Jan 21 23:37:24 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, you're wrong. It's all about light and shade."
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,Dakunaa,2,Wed Jan 21 23:40:56 2015 UTC,"Well... It's not bad, it would just have been better with JPJ on the organ in the background."
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,tinglethefairy,2,Wed Jan 21 23:44:41 2015 UTC,I think the point of it is mostly to tap into the Celtic lyrical themes.   It also works really well to show the variety Zep has in just one song. Probably one of the best examples for that.
led_zeppelin,2t7no3,Dakunaa,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:36:07 2015 UTC,"Well, the song as a whole doesn't have much variety though."
led_zeppelin,2t24nb,warvibe24,10,Tue Jan 20 15:46:50 2015 UTC,Really? For something that wasn't on a real album I think it gets played a ton. I remember when the first box set came out in the 90s that this was on the radio on the time. Then Hootie did a cover and it was out there even more.
led_zeppelin,2t24nb,stankbucket,2,Tue Jan 20 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"Well I can't speak for the 90's, because I was born in '93. However I have maybe heard the the song on the radio a total of 4 times, and whenever Zep is brought up I don't really hear this song being mentioned. Which is what makes me think it's a bit over looked."
led_zeppelin,2t24nb,zeppelinism,3,Tue Jan 20 20:32:48 2015 UTC,Where I live I hear this on the radio ALL THE TIME. That being said it's a fantastic song and my first ex would basically drop her panties when I played this for her.

led_zeppelin,2t24nb,wrongwayjay,7,Wed Jan 21 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"I remember going hunting for the 45 of Immigrant Song with a couple of friends in the late 80's.  It was the only way to get it.  About the same time it seemed to get ""rediscovered"" and started getting more airplay on classic rock stations. Later CD releases made it a lot more accessible, but at that time it was the only Led Zeppelin song (IIRC) that you couldn't get by buying all the albums.  ...And it's a damn fun song to sing in the car!"
led_zeppelin,2t24nb,watchingwombat,5,Wed Jan 21 00:37:33 2015 UTC,It is a good song but I personally can't stand it. I have no explanation as to why. The song that I feel gets over looked is Traveling Riverside Blues. It blew my brain when I first heard it.
led_zeppelin,2t24nb,wrongwayjay,5,Wed Jan 21 00:23:28 2015 UTC,"It still blows my brain, it's a magical song."
led_zeppelin,2t24nb,OctaviusC,1 point,Wed Jan 21 01:09:23 2015 UTC,I have no idea how that didn't make it onto an album. Imagine if #3 ended with that song? How did it not make it onto Coda if nothing else?
led_zeppelin,2t24nb,wrongwayjay,2,Wed Jan 21 01:24:48 2015 UTC,"Because, to my understanding, since it was recorded at the BBC and not in a studio idk if they even wanted it to be on an album until the BBC sessions were released."

led_zeppelin,2t24nb,TrickHell,3,Wed Jan 21 04:18:58 2015 UTC,It got the occasional spin on WABX in Detroit waaaaay back when.   I believe it was the B-side of The Immigrant Song single.

led_zeppelin,2t3k7i,scaryketchup,8,Tue Jan 20 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"This song doesn't feel as long as it actually is, and maybe that's because its so awesome I don't think about how much time has gone by. Definitely one of Zeppelin's best works."
led_zeppelin,2t3k7i,yeah_dawg21,6,Tue Jan 20 22:06:07 2015 UTC,I believe Page said this was his favorite Zep solo. It's badass.  Zeppelin actually plays some of the riffs in The Song Remains The Same Version of Dazed and Confused before Plant sings Going to San Francisco lines.
led_zeppelin,2t3k7i,smilingarmpits,2,Wed Jan 21 01:45:06 2015 UTC,yup the Em - C - whatever progression
led_zeppelin,2t3k7i,watchingwombat,4,Fri Jan 30 12:32:43 2015 UTC,"Oh Albion remain, sleeping now to rise again.  One of my favourite lyrics. The Page guitar army is in full force in this one, and my personal feeling is that John Bonham single handedly invented Iron Maiden with this drumbeat."

led_zeppelin,2t3k7i,orsini1138,2,Wed Jan 21 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"Presence was the first Zep album that I really felt disappointed in. It was the start of the decline for me, which makes this song stand out because it's such a great tune and WAY above the rest of the material from that album or the next. Love the solos, and I especially loves roberts vocals at 6:34, especially since you rarely here him doing backing harmonies.  this song just kicks ass"

And, Achilles Last Stand for the song, because... well, that needs no explanation.  I really respect your choice OP, because Presence is such under-appreciated album that a lot of people overlook the greatness of. If you want hard, fast-paced riffs, with some phenomenal percussion/drumming to bounce off them, then Presence is what you should go for. It's straight-up rock which is why I think a lot of tend to look at it as weak as whole. They are used to Zep's eclectic sound that moves from one genre to another, but that's really absent on the album. Instead, you have a sprint of fast, in-your-face hard rock, taht doesn't stop till the last track."

led_zeppelin,2syvrd,MrMagnolia,3,Mon Jan 19 20:18:57 2015 UTC,"I think what really makes this interesting, and possibly the reason for a surprise like Immigrant Song getting only one vote, is how these results could pair up with the exposure that we all have had to certain songs. If we assume, and a pretty good assumption it may be, that continuous radio play has over-saturated our tastes for songs like Immigrant Song, then that could definitely skew the results to unexpected outcomes.

led_zeppelin,2ss3fh,CamelLoggins,5,Sat Jan 17 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"I like In Through The Outdoor! I think it was great that the band was trying out different styles. I understand that some have different tastes than others, so it doesn't appeal to everyone. I for one, enjoy it. It makes me wonder what would have came after this album. I also wonder if it would have been a ""transition"" album like I've heard Led Zeppelin III be referred to as a ""transition"" album. /u/1859 posted a great write up on the In The Evening Song Discussion Thread about the song, the album, and also what could have been the future of Zeppelin's music."
led_zeppelin,2ss3fh,scaryketchup,3,Sun Jan 18 05:20:48 2015 UTC,"I like this album. Songs such as 'Fool in the Rain' and 'South Bound  Saurez' are heavily influenced by JPJ. ""All My Love' and 'Hot Dog' are the work of Plant, and are almost a preview of his solo career. 'In the Evening', 'Carouselambra', and 'I'm Gonna Crawl' feature the most of Jimmy Page. Along with Page, people say that Bonzo was too impaired to make this album, but after listening to some of his isolated tracks, he was as good as he always was. Not the album I recommend for first-time listeners, but a good album nonetheless."
led_zeppelin,2ss3fh,Snacksmith,3,Sat Jan 17 23:49:39 2015 UTC,I really don't think he was impaired in Fool in the Rain...   out take
led_zeppelin,2ss3fh,Dakunaa,2,Sun Jan 18 16:16:53 2015 UTC,"In the Evening, Carouselambra and Fool in the Rain are all pretty good songs. The rest, though, not so much. It's almost good that the band disbanded soon after this (though the reasons are very unfortunate). LZ would never be what they were, and In Through the Out Door and Presence each contain a bigger number of average songs than their previous albums did."
led_zeppelin,2ss3fh,PleaseBmoreCharming,5,Sun Jan 18 01:15:00 2015 UTC,"Whoa! No one knows what could have been after this album. I think it's ridiculous to say it was almost good they disbanded. While I agree the album was less than average for Zep, if you really look at the details in each song, the makeup of things like the driving guitars and composition of In The Evening, the same old band is there just shadowed by other factors."
led_zeppelin,2ss3fh,Dakunaa,2,Sun Jan 18 07:18:55 2015 UTC,"That's true. However, they were slowly moving away from their blues roots (IMO), where they were most comfortable and made the best (again, IMO) music. Plant's kid tragically died while they were on tour, and he had to be convinced to come back to play."

Sure, Spirit is no Led Zep but what about Willie Dixon? or Joan Baez?? or Jeff Beck even...or the all the other blues musicians Jimmy blatantly ""borrowed"" from?? He's even admitted as much. Have you read Mick Walls book? I'm thinking reading isn't your strong suit."
led_zeppelin,2snh4j,Gumderwear,3,Fri Jan 16 23:46:55 2015 UTC,If Jimmy Page ripped of one of my songs I would be so fucking happy! Of course LZ borrowed of a bunch stuff from other people but so did everyone else. I didn't read Mick's book. I was commenting on the particular lawsuit. Also he didn't rip of Joan Baez. She covered Babe from Anne Brenon. Maybe it is you who should revisit that whole reading thing and get your facts straight. When it comes to determining wether or not a song has be plagiarized I'd prefer to listen to the music and form my opinion rather then reading some book so I can voice someone else's ideas. As much as Zep has borrowed from people more people have borrowed from Zep and they never pussed out and filed a law suite. Do you think Jeff Beck came up with Beck's Bolero on his own? What about Jethro Tull's Bouree? Don't be a douche and cling to some small unoriginal opinion like you are an authority on the subject.

led_zeppelin,2sk74h,Vitoon,3,Fri Jan 16 00:09:32 2015 UTC,An outtake from Houses of the Holy. It had been unreleased until 1982 when it appeared on Coda. It is said that Plant's vocals were added in 1982 because it was supposed to be an instrumental for HoTH. Some parts of the song were taken from parts of the live version of Dazed and Confused.

led_zeppelin,2sfxwe,wastedaxis,7,Wed Jan 14 21:26:23 2015 UTC,"My favorite as well. I believe the harmonica sound as good as it does because they actually reversed it in studio. This song has a bunch of tricks like that, which weren't common at the time."
led_zeppelin,2sfxwe,Melkor_Morgoth,9,Thu Jan 15 00:52:06 2015 UTC,The drums sound like they were recorded in the depths of Khazad-dÃ»m.  An amazing song that I never get tired of.

led_zeppelin,2sfxwe,Mongozuma,6,Wed Jan 14 21:17:42 2015 UTC,Drums recorded in a stairwell with mics up at the second floor. As i recall reading once.
led_zeppelin,2sfxwe,JuicyPukePi,5,Thu Jan 15 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"Indeed, at Headley Grange. You get to see the inside of it where the drums were in the It Might Get Loud documentary."
led_zeppelin,2sfxwe,watchingwombat,3,Thu Jan 15 02:40:28 2015 UTC,"A great drone and probably the greatest drum beat of all time.  If you listen carefully Bonham does very few drum fills at all, mostly it's just that killer beat going on.  Just shows how something so simple can be so amazing.  I believe they either recorded it slightly faster, or slowed the tape down after recording so it sounds even more dark and menacing.  I never get tired of listening to this."

led_zeppelin,2sfxwe,SacUp,2,Thu Jan 15 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"Bonhams drumming is one half of the song 'Rhyming and Stealing' by the beastie boys. The guitar portion of that song is from 'Sweet Leaf' by Black Sabbath.   From my experience, this is the track that catches non rock music people's ears. The simplified and perfectly timed drumming fits even today's music and esp. In the hip-hop community. This song would have fit well on Led Zeppelin III."

I didn't think much of it it, mostly because I was kinda zoned out by the end of the album. That was the only time I listened to it for a while.  About a month later, I was camping one night. My tent was right by a stream. Suddenly, the most brutal storm attacked us. The rain fell like a thick sheet of bullets, and the lightning would flash and illuminate everything for brief moments.  In those fleeting moments, I could see the stream start roaring, crashing over the rocks at a great speed. All of my other camp mates were running around in a panic, trying to get themselves into the tent where it was dry, but I just stood there, in awe of the major storm that we were embroiled in.  In my head, music was blasting - ""Da na da doo! Da na na doo! Da na na doo, doo doo doo!""  The bridge to When the Levee Breaks  When I finally got home, the first thing I did was blast that song.  It is now my favorite Led Zeppelin song."

I have tickets to see Jason Bonham's Led Zeppelin Experience in March and it's a two night gig. Night one the band is playing I and II in their entirely plus some other hits.

Unfortunately Ramble On was one of those tracks the band inexplicably never performed live during their touring days.   The only instance I can think of off the top of my head is from this version of Communication Breakdown.

Just like Dazed And Confused, Page uses a violin bow. The song was featured on the soundtrack for the 1970 film ""Homer"", which is the first film to feature a song by Led Zeppelin.

I get why many don't like it as much, it's more challenging than the first few albums, and is a somewhat different sound.  But it's got everything that makes Led Zeppelin great in it - great songs, epic riffs, astounding drums, great vocals and amazing bass playing.  Not much not to like on hear, Candy Store Rock for me is the only weak point."

I really like the acoustic guitar and mandolin duet done by Page and JPJ. The original title of the song was ""Guide to California"". It started as a song about earthquakes, but then it developed into a song about searching for a woman."

It's a brilliant piece of writing, and it sounds like nothing else in the Zeppelin discography.  Maybe legal issues with The Firm, since parts of it became Midnight Moonlight?  Or - this theory is waaaaay out there - maybe Jimmy plans on using it for his upcoming solo album?    Regardless, I'm pretty disappointed by the bonus track selection."

led_zeppelin,2rnndr,1859,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:01:49 2015 UTC,"That little twist that Bonzo plays on the hi hat throughout this song is understated genius.  It changes the entire song.  I know a few drummers who gave it a first listen, said they could play it no problem, and then were absolutely lost behind the kit after giving it a try.  It sounds so simple and natural!  Now if only the boys hadn't repeated the same two measures for the first four minutes.  As a result, I mostly love the outro of Darlene.  It's a sincere love letter to 50's rockabilly, and it works well.  I think it was probably cut from ITTOD because the honky tonk of Hot Dog was too similar to Darlene, which comes across as a little undercooked."
led_zeppelin,2rj8kf,scaryketchup,7,Tue Jan 6 17:56:00 2015 UTC,I actually love this song.  It's just the solo that's makes me love it. It just fits the song perfectly
led_zeppelin,2rj8kf,EvolutionX2,4,Tue Jan 6 21:16:39 2015 UTC,"Hot Dog is like The Crunge of ITTOD.  It's the fourth song on the album, it's a tongue-in-cheek take on a genre atypical of Led Zeppelin, and you either love it or you hate it.  In an album full of lyrical hints of the dark place that Robert was in at the time, Hot Dog's humor is downright refreshing.  The guitar solo is sloppy, considering Page's previous penchant for perfection.  He later claimed that this was intentional, as sounding like a beginner guitarist fit the pastiche they were doing.  But considering his heroin addiction at the time, I'm not sure if I believe him."

If I want epic wailing blues I put on live version, if I want more of a slow jam, I put on the original. Also, the fact that live one is longer is makes a difference to me. I can put it on and just let it go."

led_zeppelin,2rf1yb,PleaseBmoreCharming,2,Mon Jan 5 21:13:06 2015 UTC,One of my favorite songs in all of music because of the amount of emotion that Robert's voice and Jimmy's guitar possesses.
led_zeppelin,2rf1yb,1859,2,Mon Jan 5 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"This is the song that Robert's gut-wrenching blues vocals were made for. He really pours it into this one. It should be no surprise that Since I've Been Loving You is one of the more polished tracks on III, considering that they'd been playing it live for nearly a year before finally putting it to wax. It's as much the centerpiece of III as Dazed And Confused was for the first record, a thesis statement that every other song on the album orbits around. In my opinion, Since I've Been Loving You is the first truly mature song that Led Zeppelin released. Every single track coalesces into something that is truly more than the sum of its parts.  The standout instrument is obviously Bonzo's Squeak King, which is like the arrow-in-the-FedEx-logo of music: once you notice it, you'll never miss it again."

Typically most of the songs on TSRTS aren't the best recorded live tracks, but I think that Since I've Been Loving You is that one exception, maybe No Quarter as well. It's always been a favorite of mine, and is equally fun to play on guitar, even as a beginning, fiddling in C minor gets you somewhere. And I agree with u/scaryketchup that the companion audio for LZ III is wonderful as well!"
led_zeppelin,2rf1yb,ziatonic,2,Mon Jan 5 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"Sweet Jesus yes. I reordered my tracklisting on Song Remains the Same to match the video setlist. (I saw the movie before I heard the album. I would put the dvd on repeat, so I like that track order.) Anyway, 'Since I've Been Loving You' and then 'No Quarter' are my all time two favourite tracks to listen to in order. It's a half hour of bliss for me. 'No Quarter' picks up right after and its just entrancing.    Sometimes I go to bars and put them on jukebox. I get a half hour of music for 2 bucks, heh heh. I've heard patrons go: ""Is this still the same song?"" Lol. I sometimes feel I am being a bit obnoxious but I don't care. 'Since I've Been Loving You (live)' followed by 'No Quarter (live)' to me, is Zeppelin perfected. Jimmy's solos are epic, JPJ's organ is mystifying and Plant's vocals are incendiary wails.... total awesomeness."

The first LP is immaculate, with In My Time of Dying and Kashmir being two of their best songs. The second LP picks up where the first left of with In The Light. I love the variety on the second LP, but it doesn't flow very well. They mainly only preformed Trampled Under Foot, Sick Again, and Kashmir live (maybe one or two more?), which is unfortunate because they could have a whole show of songs they never preformed live."

The song is based off of an event that occurred at the Royal Orleans Hotel. It is said that JPJ brought a woman to his hotel room, and was unaware that she was a transvestite. They then fell asleep and the transvestite had a lit joint in her hand, and it set the room on fire. Luckily nobody was hurt, and everyone escaped.  ""He kissed the whiskers, left and right"" ""Poor whiskers set the room alight""  Edit: I meant the only song on the album that JPJ receives credit."

led_zeppelin,2qu1lb,scaryketchup,5,Tue Dec 30 18:06:39 2014 UTC,I definitely think JPJ makes the song. It has probably the sexiest bassline I've ever heard.

Playing the bass line note-for-note is one thing, but for me to put the same feeling into it as JPJ does on the recording is something completely different, a whole new challenge beyond my capabilities at present. He's a freak show of a musician, and this song is just one example of that."

Once you do early Small Faces, turn directly to the Pretty Things.  In 1970, Rolling Stone magazine named their album Parachute as the best album of the year.  Think about that.  Good luck!  EDIT: My memory was wrong.  Quoth wiki:  ""In 1975, Rolling Stone critic Steve Turner even wrote that it had been ""a Rolling Stone 'album of the year',"" though in fact Parachute did not place among the magazine's Albums of the Year for 1970 or 1971, and indeed was not mentioned in Rolling Stone until Stephen Holden called it an ""obscure underground classic"" in his review of Freeway Madness."""

led_zeppelin,2qpys3,RPDC,1 point,Tue Dec 30 04:15:37 2014 UTC,This song feels like it is talking about death or dying with unfinished business. Maybe being separated from society. It seems to mellow to actually be happy. Beautiful song though.
led_zeppelin,2qpys3,SuburbanHierarchy,1 point,Tue Dec 30 00:02:10 2014 UTC,"Classic Zep. Down By The Seaside appears to be just another filler song, or an attempt at a ballad. Probably one of their weaker songs. After giving it a few listens, it expands to a beautiful piece soaring from tranquility and peace into thunderous jams. Perfect example of how truly amazing Zep was, with their ""weaker"" (in my opinion) songs still being purely fantastic."
led_zeppelin,2qnr05,scaryketchup,8,Sun Dec 28 23:47:54 2014 UTC,One of my favorite ways a guitar has opened a song.
led_zeppelin,2qnr05,RPDC,6,Mon Dec 29 01:24:10 2014 UTC,"In The Evening hints at what I think the next Led Zeppelin album would've been.  Pagey and Bonzo said that they wanted the next one to be a heavy return to form - but even when you reexamine your roots, you're still inevitably moving forward as well.  You're affected by the environment that you're in.  In The Evening encapsulates that line of thinking, for me.  It's probably the only identifiable ""Zeppelin-sounding"" song on the record - which is not to detract from the rest of the album, but it's true.  And at the same time, it sounds nothing like any other song they'd released up until that point.  You can feel the cocaine-fueled hedonism of the 70s shaking hands with the young, poppy 80s somewhere in the middle of this track.  And I love it.  That ethereal beginning, then Robert comes soaring in over the tympani... chills, man.  Every time."
led_zeppelin,2qnr05,1859,6,Mon Dec 29 05:28:10 2014 UTC,"Great write-up man. Exactly how I feel about the song and album as well. It's this song, and a few others on the album, that is the basis for an argument I think you hinted on: the idea that the music was changing to some degree, yet they still kept alive a piece of what it was to be ""Led Zeppelin."""
led_zeppelin,2qnr05,PleaseBmoreCharming,5,Mon Dec 29 06:08:47 2014 UTC,"This song is one of my Dad's favorite Zep songs.  A week or two ago I saw Get the Led Out in Philly at the Electric Factory with him. On the way we played our game of ""What will they open with?"" and I was claiming Rock N Roll or Good Times Bad Times but he kept insisting ""Nope, it'll be In the Evening"". I kept telling him that he was wrong, but when the lights went up and we were greeted not by crashing cymbals or guitar shockwaves but instead by the ogling guitar space, I looked at him with such disbelief. It was a great show."
led_zeppelin,2qnr05,W1CKeD_SK1LLz,3,Mon Dec 29 07:10:05 2014 UTC,I enjoy this song. I think its a good opener for In Through the Outdoor. The lyrics are about how rich and famous people are still capable of pain and struggling with things.
led_zeppelin,2qjng1,scaryketchup,10,Sat Dec 27 17:52:06 2014 UTC,"My favorite song, classic riff and one of the best outros in any of their songs. The song was written to their ""ocean"" of fans."

I read somewhere (I think in a book I read a while back) that when Plant was in the hospital after the car accident, the patient in the bed next to him recognized him and started singing The Ocean. It's cool how the song is dedicated to the audience of the band's concerts."

I can imagine them in the studio producing the album and then all suddenly realizing how incredible of a line that was and how it could contribute to the song.  Â   One of the first songs I learned to play on guitar -- great, classic riff and awesome chord progression on the verses.

led_zeppelin,2qhyvy,CamelLoggins,3,Sat Dec 27 02:48:57 2014 UTC,"My second favorite album to IV. TSRTS kicks the album off in the right direction, followed by the beautiful ballad The Rain Song, and OTHAFA concludes the epic 1-2-3 of this album in typical Zeppelin fashion. A little bit of a lull in the middle of the album with a funk inspired James Brown tribute; The Crunge (my personal least favorite), eastern inspired Dancing Days (many in this sub's least favorite), and reggae inspired D'yer Mak'er, which charted well in the U.S., but seems to be disliked my many fans. Picking things back up is the JPJ opus; No Quarter, and my personal favorite; The Ocean."
led_zeppelin,2qhyvy,scaryketchup,2,Sat Dec 27 02:59:39 2014 UTC,"This album was so difficult for me to find on vinyl for some reason, and now that I have it I see it everywhere. I like the diversity in music genre that this album has. My favorite track off the album is The Rain Song. When I first listened to the album I was instantly hooked by the first three songs, but then The Crunge kind of threw me off a bit. I don't think its a bad song, but it's definitely not as good as the three before it. Then I was hooked once again with Dancing Days, which personally I enjoy. D'yer Mak'er and No Quarter at first didn't interest me, but then they both grew on me after listening to the album again. Finally, The Ocean I enjoyed right away along with the first three songs and Dancing Days. All in all, Houses of the Holy is an interesting album because of its diversity and it being a turning point for the band."
led_zeppelin,2qhyvy,j3434,1 point,Sat Dec 27 05:09:40 2014 UTC,That Four Lad's with Jimmy at helm were into some intricate snow dune driven landscapes. The fidelity was insanely heavy and immaculately clear. The vocals unearthly. This was a journey with underpinnings of youthful desperate love and varied mysticism. There is not a misstep on this LP as they continue to perfect the hard folk-rock country influences and merge with everything from 60's R&B to Moroccan Shamanism and Prog Rock.   Following up IV was no doubt a task they were up to. The understated highly embellished mesh-weave of guitar leads refused to slam more endless repetition without an equal share of baroque introspective virtuosity.  Best of all this is an album to get laid by. Every song offers a climax or two that can be from start to finish from one perspective. This is music to get high to as well. It is also music to dance to anytime and where.   Brilliance in every facet sparkled as this radio friendly LP raised the level for all rock bands. This album is comparable to no other Led Zeppelin and no other rock album of the same ear.   .Sing out Hare hare - dance the hoochie coo !

led_zeppelin,2qgiyk,Launchboxed,2,Fri Dec 26 19:10:55 2014 UTC,"This song kind of goes back to their bluesy rock sound that they did on their first album. I know they played this song live for quite a bit, and it was featured on the Led Zeppelin DVD."
led_zeppelin,2qgiyk,justafellowtraveller,2,Fri Dec 26 17:42:33 2014 UTC,"The title of this song apparently came from the sound John Bonham was making while playing with his hi-hat in between takes during recording.

led_zeppelin,2qgiyk,j3434,0,Fri Dec 26 23:08:20 2014 UTC,"This one was a certainly glamorous ending to the epic LP. Power chords were never more transcendent and heavy simultaneously. With Magic Jimmy at the mixing board he was able to tame this mad explosion of sonic ecstasy into a 4 minute hit. At once sensual glam rock and never letting loose of the masculine blues that was their foundation.  This solo perhaps is one of Jimmy's best. The phrasing is the Page signature. A mini orchestral composition on a 57 Les Paul with spontaneous embellishments that ache needing attention and still shouting over nobody.   This one sounds like the Rolling Truck Stoners were involved in some of the tracking. One pass or two passes and Bonzo put every kind of fill in there imaginable.   ""Everybody knows I'm the one you need"" ... Lets go back to high school !"

led_zeppelin,2qdg75,CabooseMSG,4,Thu Dec 25 19:59:00 2014 UTC,I'm a huge led zep fan but I honestly think that kashmir is one of the most overrated songs they produced and got more recognition than it should have. In my opinion there's no real climax to the song and therefore just average compared to all the other great songs led zeppelin has produced.  Can anyone agree? I really feel I'm the only one with this opinion in the thread so far. What makes Kashmir a good song for you?
led_zeppelin,2qdg75,bananaking43,2,Thu Dec 25 22:03:34 2014 UTC,"I totally feel where you're coming from. I haven't listened to Kashmir in years at this point because there's nothing new for it to offer me. But that lack of climax is the key to the song's power. If there are two words to describe Kashmir, they are ""unresolved tension"". Between the 4/4 drums versus 3/4 guitar, the plodding musical interludes, and lack of an ending, Kashmir is pure discomfort. And yet it is so sure of itself that it pulls it off without sounding uncomfortable with itself. I don't love Kashmir, but I love the fact that I don't love Kashmir. Does that make sense?"

led_zeppelin,2qdg75,TealPaint,1 point,Fri Dec 26 06:49:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean too. It's really not a complex song at all. I remember hearing that it was inspired by a seemingly endless road through the Moroccan desert. I think they achieved their intentions in that respect. The main appeal of the song for me is the atmosphere it gives off with the ominous riff, as well as how the rhythm changes during the bridge. But I definitely skip it a lot because it can be boring if you're not in the mood."
led_zeppelin,2qdg75,PimJag,0,Fri Dec 26 23:16:29 2014 UTC,"The spiritual journey in life was on prime importance to the lads. They had experiences that they were expressing musically crossing into realms of metaphysics. The middle eastern fusion had been explored with Yardbirds and on LZ I through Houses of the Holy. Kashmir was the grandiose epic masterwork. It has been overplayed but hardly understood. To appreciate this song one should start with the lyrics. If you think you understand them you are probably missing the auto-biographical aspects of the songs.   It is difficult to appreciate the song out the context of it's release. There has never been anything like it before or since. They all were on the same page. Bonzo's infectious funky beat, Page's complex orchestrated production and JPJ's string section all all led by Plant's narrative and perhaps one of his top 10 sensually spiritually offerings.   This song is a text book example of production. This is Jimmy's ears at work here. Iconic perfection."

Even though it's over 10 minutes long, all of it sounds so fresh each time. The first few minutes have bold and harsh synth work from JPJ and a thumping Bonzo drumbeat. Then the transition into the slow guitar-driven section is nice and a bit of a throwback to Zep's older epics like Since I've Been Loving You. And the final section brings us back to the synths that JPJ loves oh so much, yet it still sounds quite different to the opening to the song.  All in all, it's a wonderful adventure of a song, up there with Stairway and No Quarter in terms of versatility and originality. I think I read somewhere too that Zep intended to use this song as a centrepiece to their live shows before Bonzo's death."

led_zeppelin,2q2nul,dukemantee,1 point,Tue Dec 23 16:58:32 2014 UTC,"I don't know why these lists still rate Listen To This Eddie so highly. There are a lot of true soundboards from the 75 tour that have surfaced in the last few years and they all sound better than Millard's audience recording. Dancing Avocado is great but you can barely hear Plant's vocals, and Southampton '73 which is from a professional multitrack and could sound incredible is marred by a poor mix and is a very flat and uninspired performance.   My personal favorite is Four Blocks In The Snow - Madison Square Garden, Feb 12 1975, a matrix of excellent audience and soundboard tapes."
led_zeppelin,2q2nul,AvkommaN,1 point,Tue Dec 23 18:48:50 2014 UTC,"It's rated highly because it's a brilliant performance and the recording really puts you in the audience, it wasn't the best show of that LA run but it's the most well known and widely available   There's really not a weak point with the show and that's quite good for the tumultuous year that was 1977"
led_zeppelin,2q2nul,dukemantee,1 point,Tue Dec 23 02:55:53 2014 UTC,"Four Blocks in the Snow is probably the best sounding bootleg ever, but it's not the best performance available.

led_zeppelin,2pzffs,yeah_dawg21,3,Sun Dec 21 22:06:59 2014 UTC,The guitar solo was recorded in a different studio. Just listen to it.  Page unleashes a killer solo all by himself. And it's awesome.

led_zeppelin,2pzffs,j3434,0,Tue Dec 23 09:36:32 2014 UTC,The obvious: The music stops and a solo guitar comes in to play an interlude. Perhaps not so obvious is that you couldn't find another similar structured song - anywhere. From zero to sixty - and then hit the breaks. Perfection in it's obvious spontaneity and the ragged edges make it impossible to copy. Perhaps EVH may attempt a song with an obvious showcase on skills - but in the middle of a song? I'd like to hear. It is the apogee of lead guitar on wax.

led_zeppelin,2pw75r,memebuster,8,Sat Dec 20 18:44:30 2014 UTC,"I was just talking about this last night:  Zep have been sued by Taurus for supposedly copying their song in Stairway.  Really honestly it does sound like Page was heavily inspired for the intro to the song. But Page transmogrified the Taurus section into something with much more flow and meaning. Musicians hear and are inspired by other music all the time. The irony is, someone remind me here, Zep sued the Beastie Boys and some other bands back in the 90s for sampling their material and putting it into rap songs. I cannot remember the outcome."
led_zeppelin,2pw75r,Launchboxed,2,Sat Dec 20 16:54:12 2014 UTC,I think the stairway-taures claim gets so much attention due to stairway's importance in rock music. It's like the greatest rock song of all time and what? It's not original? No way!!!   Meanwhile songs like I Cant Quit You Baby and Dazed and Confused are way more stolen/unoriginal than stairway.

led_zeppelin,2pw75r,FlyingEngineer,7,Sat Dec 20 17:27:07 2014 UTC,"This song means a lot to me. It's the song that first got me in to Zep when I was around 14 (10 years ago). After that it crops up ever now and then in my playlists. Whenever I'm having a rough day, this is a song that lifts me up. The lyrics are open to interpretation, and somehow they always seem to fit in to whatever's going on in my life at the moment. I think this song is underrated, too many dislike it because it's too popular. I think it deserves more credit.   I also think that ""To be a rock and not to roll"" can be the most inspirational quote around."

Stairway to heaven could be the best song ever written, ""what? Not this stupid argument"", you're thinking. Let's think about it for a second, when you ask someone ""what is the best song of all time"", they almost definitely wont have an answer. It is sort a weird question actually, how do you define the best song ever?  Now the reason I put this song forward is it succeeds in every reasonable metric we can go for. It has everything, so to speak. Lyrics, check. Instrumental talent, check. Singing talent, check. Memorable, check. Original/revolutionary, double check. Interesting instumentation, check. Futhermore it has a really broad appeal, and doesnt suffer from being self indulgent and overly artsy like many other songs that fit these criteria.  This only really works in a objective sense, I mean this isnt even my favourite led zeppelin song (It might not even be in the top 5) let alone my favourite song.  This doesnt really seem like a satisfactory answer, although that could be the slight hipster thing in me, however if you disagree, ask yourself, what other candidates are there really? I can't really think of any, even songs I like more have dont really succeed like Stairway does."

Louie Louie - A fun bootleg from a 1972 show.  Zeppelin covering an iconic song is always a good time.  As Long As I Have You - Classic early era Zeppelin live show stuff.  Great bootleg quality and a charming bonus of Plant rambling to fill time in front of the audience.  In The Light - An alternate take on a pretty good Zeppelin song.

led_zeppelin,2pmi1m,MrMagnolia,10,Wed Dec 17 23:04:35 2014 UTC,"With the live performances clocking in at around thirty minutes, its a lot of time to devote to a single piece of music. And, as Zep's catalog grew (especially other long songs such as Kasmir), ya gotta cut something. It was one of their older pieces as well, and the band did like to move ever onward."
led_zeppelin,2pmi1m,Victor3000,8,Thu Dec 18 02:23:07 2014 UTC,"It must have been Jimmy's choice. After all, it was his solo, like Moby Dick / Over the Top was Bonzo's, and NQ JPJ's. He chose to revive White Summer instead, and make the bow section more of a standalone section. It's just.... something different.  Which is what musicians like"

Another great blues rock song, and I love that it has that Since I've Been Loving You sound to it.  I think this song is a great song that reflects on the band members and how they suffered from homesickness.   As far as live versions, Zeppelin did not play this song in its entirety. Although, some parts of the guitar solo have been incorporated into the solo of Since I've Been Loving You. Page and Plant however have played this song live in Japan while on tour in 1996.  I think this song doesn't get nearly enough praise that it deserves, but I guess its good to always have those ""fan favorite"" songs. Unfortunately I've only talked to a few people who have even heard of it.  All in all, Tea For One, in my opinion, is just amazing. I actually prefer it over Since I've Been Loving You. Not sure if many feel the same, but I hope somebody does."

I discovered it by playing around with a record player and a copy of Led Zeppelin II. I heard those opening notes and was instantly hooked. Once the guitar solo came around, I knew I was gonna like this band.  Overall, a fun song with a really cool riff."
led_zeppelin,2pejvg,hairloop27,4,Mon Dec 15 22:23:58 2014 UTC,"Oh my god that guitar solo, the best part is the building tension that precedes it, similar to Dazed and Confused when Jimmy comes out of the psychadelic violin bow shit playing major chords.

While slightly bending the fretted A string up a quarter step or so. Just a little twang. Then hammer an E power chord and Sorta let the open E string play with it.

led_zeppelin,2pejvg,Dakunaa,4,Thu Dec 25 19:52:30 2014 UTC,"It's often very frustrating to play this song with guitarists (as a drummer). They always turn the distortion waay up and play it very rough, while it actually is nothing of the sort. When the song is sung, or drummers drumming it, they are always so rough, while that is totally unnecessary."
led_zeppelin,2pejvg,Ozzybeans,2,Tue Dec 16 06:24:42 2014 UTC,"This song was introduced in a different format on April 26th, 1969, in San Francisco. The middle section is a sparse slide guitar workout buried in Echoplex echo...Page really fucking shreds it. Audio evidence suggests that the stage debut of Page's Les Paul was the night after (the first night where you can hear him toggle the pickups to create a staccato effect), making this the only performance of this song played on his dragon Telecaster.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH6MdW0-gok - the debut live performance.  The only other performance of this song during 1969 was at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland. It is the only surviving audio of Led Zeppelin's performance that night. The middle section features a lot of call-and-response, very similar to the workout they would include in Bring It On Home.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSCSz-Ax2A  Around 3:14 you can hear a similar workout to the one in Bring It On Home. Dare to compare (heard around 4:38 in this video):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bup_W6W8axI  The first proper live version of the song was played in January of 1970 in Bristol. The audio recording doesn't do it justice - it might as well be an army of feral cats attacking each other. The next known live recording of the song is much easier on the ears - it's the Royal Albert Hall show.  The song served as a main setlist closer throughout early 1970. The last time it would be played in its Led Zeppelin II format was at their legendary concert on June 28th, 1970 at Shepton Mallet for the Bath Festival. Up until this point, How Many More Times had served as their outlet for their blues medley (as heard on the Royal Albert Hall concert and BBC Sessions). At their next performance in Germany (Berlin I think?) HMMT had been cut from the set and Whole Lotta Love served as their blues medley.  The format for the medley generally started with Boogie Chillun by John Lee Hooker and ended with a slow blues jam before returning to the main riff. They would retain this format until their 1973 US tour, where they would only play Boogie Chillun. I believe this is because their concerts were well over three hours in length by early 1973 and they wanted to trim the fat.  Whole Lotta Love returned in 1975 on the second leg of their US tour in Uniondale. After the theramin section, instead of going into the guitar solo, it was linked directly into Black Dog as their encore. Towards the end of the tour (and further into their Earl's Court performances) they would perform an abbreviated rendition of The Crunge before the theramin section, the first time they had played that song since including it in the Dazed and Confused guitar solo, as heard on How The West Was Won.  WLL continued to be stripped down for their 1977 tour; the band would play the first two verses and then in place of the theramin section they would dive right into Rock & Roll.  WLL was not played on their first Copenhagen warm-up show in 1979, but was included as an encore during the second, as well as both Knebworth shows. The second performance at Knebworth, while rather uneven, included the first performance of Boogie Chillun since 1973. The middle theramin section was dropped and the verses went right into the guitar solo; what followed was an interpolation of the main riff that's just...fucking fantastic.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB_DOA2AL7Q  This is the version seen on the Led Zeppelin DVD. If you haven't heard it, you are missing out.  Whole Lotta Love returned as an encore for their 1980 European tour, with the middle section extended as a raucous jam. It was performed as their opener during their messy reunion set at Live Aid in 1985, where their drummer lost track during the middle of the song. They played it during their 1988 reunion immediately following their lackluster performance of Heartbreaker, in a similar arrangement to the 1979 jam. The song got a proper farewell as their first encore during their 2007 reunion.  I'll cap this unnecessarily long post off with a couple of Whole Lotta Love performances with notable blues covers, rarities and whatnot. I am a big fan of Led Zeppelin live performances and if ya'll don't mind these walls of text, i'll be happy to dump as much information as I can for these song discussions.  WARNING: AUDIO QUALITY IS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT POOR.  Live in New York, 1970 (evening show): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSGQXZUjYBY  A very long medley. Includes Train Kept A-Rollin' with alternate lyrics, which was very uncommon for 1970 - the only other time they played it was as an encore in Oakland earlier in the tour. Also includes the For What It's Worth instrumental with Cinnamon Girl lyrics, and a spontaneous performance of Lawdy Miss Clawdy.  Live in Tokyo, 1971: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uELUstR2tX4  Notable for the only live rendition of Your Time Is Gonna Come with the original crew of Led Zeppelin.  Live in Osaka, 1971: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfTh_JJH9ys  Includes a rare performance of Twist and Shout, as well as a crushing Good Times Bad Times.  Live in Sydney, 1972: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufEEoczAiHs  Notable for a mostly complete instrumental rendition of the Rover, played much cleaner than the rehearsal at Chicago Stadium in 1973. Similar arrangement to the How The West Was Won version.  Live in Hamburg, 1973: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXzJVTONKAM (Part 1)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cWJhrBrSM8 (Part 2)  Plant's voice was suffering on this tour, but the instrumentals were constantly phenomenal. Despite being in poor form, Plant brings a lot of energy to the audience."
led_zeppelin,2pa37t,scaryketchup,7,Sun Dec 14 18:48:06 2014 UTC,"I've hear the inspiration for Bonhams usage of four drumsticks to play the rhythm stemmed from a fit of inadequacy after seeing Ginger Bakers All-Stars in concert during the sessions. Intent on proving himself comparable, he went and played the rhythm heard on the track.  The only known live recording of Zeppelin playing this was at Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1971. They introduced it without having a title, and said 'it very well could fall apart'. They played What It Is And What Should Never Be instead, and once they had worked out their nerves they gave it a go. ('For your entertainment!', Plant quipped.)  They established the rhythm with a 6/8 jam in E Phyrigian, and then banged out a really tight rendition of the song. They immediately followed it with an electric version of Gallows Pole, which (coupled with the way the middle section of Four Sticks sounded live) leads me to guess that Page utilized the double-neck for the two songs the way he would use it for The Song Remains the Same and the Rain Song, where he played one song on one neck and one song on the other without breaks in between.  The synthesizer used on the song is an old ARP synthesizer, I think. Something about it's construction led to it having a comparably odd sound relative to the more popular Moogs of the time. JPJ liked it and used it for a lot of songs, most notably In The Light.  Jimmy Page proudly cited the middle section of this song, along with (I think) Stairway to Heaven and Ramble On as an example of his desire to blend electric and acoustic instruments to create light and shade."
led_zeppelin,2pa37t,Ozzybeans,4,Sun Dec 14 20:30:12 2014 UTC,"Super cool knowledge. As one big nerd, thanks for sharing! I have something to add though: I count the main guitar riff as 5/4 and the middle section (the fuzzy synth melody) as 6/8."
led_zeppelin,2pa37t,smilingarmpits,1 point,Sun Dec 14 23:04:31 2014 UTC,"I count it the same way. The live version is preceded with a short jam that isn't heard on the studio version.

led_zeppelin,2pa37t,smilingarmpits,7,Thu Dec 18 00:40:22 2014 UTC,"Bonzo's drum playing is awesome. I think this is one their songs where Plant has the most high pitched vocals, especially towards the end. Led Zeppelin IV is super hard to pick a least favorite song off of since they're all so good, and unfortunately even though Four Sticks is great I'd say it's my least favorite song compared to the rest of the album."

led_zeppelin,2pa37t,SuburbanHierarchy,3,Sun Dec 14 19:55:15 2014 UTC,"I read a while back that the title comes from Bonzo playing with four drum sticks instead of two. He could not get the sound that he wanted and started dicking around with four sticks and did a perfect take of the song, so they opted to keep it instead of having him do it again.  There is a great book called Led Zeppelin: Dazed and Confused: The Story Behind Every Song that has a lot of cool facts like this about each one of their songs.  Personally, it was the hardest track to get into for me off of IV, but after a couple of listens I really got into it. The time signature is really strange but I think that it has a sort of experimentalism that compliments the other songs in the album. It seems to me to be just as mystical as Misty Mountain or Evermore, but it is a lot more emotive than either of those songs (almost in a grungy kind of way if that is a good term to describe it)."

led_zeppelin,2pa37t,Dakunaa,2,Sun Dec 14 22:58:57 2014 UTC,"For me, the attraction lies not with the drum rhythm, but with Page's guitar playing.  As far as I can tell, the drum part is a four-on-the-floor on the eight note, with a simple sticking on the toms for the rest. The most interesting thing here is the off-beat bass drum usage, not so much the ""Four Sticks"" element."

led_zeppelin,2p48xt,liquidswordzman,5,Sat Dec 13 01:39:52 2014 UTC,"A great song to kick off the album. Its neat how this song is followed by the mellow, acoustic song ""Friends"", and then the heaviness is brought back in Since I've Been Loving You and Out on the Tiles. The lyrics are cool too. Also,Jack Black begged Zeppelin to allow the song to be featured in School of Rock."

led_zeppelin,2oom8u,Leftieswillrule,5,Mon Dec 8 21:13:36 2014 UTC,"JPJ has the writing credits for the main riff. I believe that the name of the song comes from a (black) dog that was wandering around the studio where Zeppelin was recording. When performed live, it was typical for them play the intro of Out On The Tiles to begin the song. I think I like the live versions, especially on How The West Was Won, even better than the studio version because the heavier feel."

I always thought it was neat that Jimmy Page once said Elliot Randall's guitar solo on ""Reelin' in the Years"" was one of his favorite guitar solos ever. And I only just realized that this song might have been influenced by ""Home At Last"" off Aja.  Aja and In Through the Out Door were released in 1977 and 1979, respectively. The track ""Home At Last"" off Aja (my favorite Steely Dan song) featured Bernard Purdie on drums playing his signature Purdie-Shuffle. John Bonham was a Purdie fan, and I suspect was influenced heavily by the drum groove in this song when Zeppelin wrote ""Fool in the Rain,"" (my favorite Led Zeppelin song).   This is something I only just pieced together, and me being no historian, and there being no interview or mention from Bonham confirming this, this is just speculation. But I think this stands to reason; it's too goddamn cool of a connection. To be fair, BP played with everyone under the sun, and probably used that beat pre-Aja at one point or another so Bonham could have heard it elsewhere. Dare to dream, I suppose."

led_zeppelin,2oee26,CamelLoggins,3,Thu Dec 11 17:44:47 2014 UTC,"Dancing Days was inspired by the eastern music they heard on a trip to India. When Page and Plant finished the song, they danced outside the studio to a recording of it. Even though when compared to other tracks from Houses of the Holy, Dancing Days isn't a standiut, this song was really pushed for radio play at the time of it's release and was preformed live a lot in 1973."
led_zeppelin,2oee26,BleachedMat,2,Fri Dec 5 22:35:45 2014 UTC,One of my all time favorites!
led_zeppelin,2oee26,Hyce,2,Sat Dec 6 04:33:55 2014 UTC,"Fun song, I'd definitely say that the live version from How the West Was Won is better strictly on the fact that the guitars don't sound awful.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7ulasOC_kk"
led_zeppelin,2oee26,orsini1138,1 point,Sat Dec 6 18:47:12 2014 UTC,"One of the weaker tracks of the album IMO. Has a decent intro riff, that classic Zep sound of odd scales and middle eastern influence with a hammering intensity to it, but other than that I don't care for the song at all and if not for that intro it'd be as low as the Crunge on my list. Without those two songs this album would be much better imo"

One of my favorite albums, LZ II was recorded almost entirely on the road and spawned their highest charting U.S. single: Whole Lotta Love which hit #4 in 1969."
led_zeppelin,2obiok,scaryketchup,3,Fri Dec 5 01:35:41 2014 UTC,"This is the album that got me into Led Zeppelin. When my grandma gave me some of her old albums, Led Zeppelin II was one of them. I started messing around with the record player she gave me too, and this was one of the first ones I played. Those opening notes of Whole Lotta Love are what ultimately got me hooked. I listened through the entire album from there. Not too long after that, I started listening to other albums, and so on.  This album is without a doubt, a great one. I'd have to say that my favorite song on the album would be Whole Lotta Love because it was the song that got me hooked on Led Zeppelin."
led_zeppelin,2obiok,jew_gehrig,3,Fri Dec 5 02:44:43 2014 UTC,"To me, it sounds like the album with the most definitive sound (well, LZ II and Houses of the Holy). As usual, everyone really showed their prowess quite distinctly: Bonzo's drum skill (Moby Dick), JPJ's smooth bass lines (Ramble On, The Lemon Song), Page's classic guitar riffs (Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker), and Plant's signature vocals (What Is and What Should Never Be, Bring It On Home)."

It was originally titled ""The Boy Next Door"" and reflects Plant's desire to escape the real world and to enter one of peace and love. This is the typical peaceful track from the Bron-yr-Aur recording sessions, and fits very well with the rest of the album."
led_zeppelin,2obduc,CamelLoggins,3,Fri Dec 5 01:16:15 2014 UTC,"This is my favorite song on Led Zeppelin III. It's definitely in my top 10 in favorite Led Zeppelin songs of all time. The gentle and mellow sound is just beautiful, and the lyrics are very interesting too.  I believe that the lyrics reflect some of Plan'ts view on the environment. Another thing the lyrics mention is how the band members were treated in some parts of America due to their appearance.   Overall, I really enjoy this song. I mean I enjoy most of Led Zeppelin's songs, but this one especially."

led_zeppelin,2o6uvy,scaryketchup,9,Wed Dec 3 20:56:37 2014 UTC,"I think that this is song is extremely underrated, and I think the reason is because it's between Black Dog, Rock 'n' Roll, and Stairway on the album. Black Dog and Rock 'n' Roll were released as singles, so maybe that's why they get more attention than this song.  I think it's cool that they had Sandy Denny as a guest vocalist. I think I read somewhere that when this song was performed live, JPJ would sing the parts that Denny sings on the album.  Also, gotta love those Lord of the Rings references."
led_zeppelin,2o6uvy,hairloop27,6,Wed Dec 3 21:00:56 2014 UTC,"But it sets the stage perfectly for Stairway, like you start with the classic rock sound of the album, then get smacked in the face by the delicate sound of battle of evermore, then stairway acts as a mirror of the first 3 songs of the album.

led_zeppelin,2o6uvy,Topher5,4,Thu Dec 4 01:04:34 2014 UTC,"I agree that the song is definitely underrated, probably because it's a soft, acoustic song on the surface (though it's actually powerful) and it's on a monster of an album.

led_zeppelin,2o0nly,j3434,3,Tue Dec 2 05:05:06 2014 UTC,There is a fab blues tune and a very heavy rock track that should have been on some of the new release sets as an out-take. They are smokin' - Fuck yea. This is the way the Lads worked in the studio often times just trying ideas. It was all about feel. They would always give it 100% and sometimes jimmy knew which ones to develop and which ones were keepers. He is the Master Wizard - but you know that.
led_zeppelin,2nymho,scaryketchup,8,Mon Dec 1 18:23:56 2014 UTC,Many would agree that this song is heavily underrated. I believe the lyrics are about Rober Plant's girlfriend from 10 years earlier who made him choose between her and his music.
led_zeppelin,2nymho,PleaseBmoreCharming,1 point,Mon Dec 1 18:28:20 2014 UTC,"Well, good thing he made the right choice. ;)"
led_zeppelin,2nymho,CamelLoggins,9,Tue Dec 2 06:41:31 2014 UTC,"This was the one of the more complex songs they've ever made. When preformed live, John Paul Jones used a three-headed bass to create the ""wall of sound"". I believe that the lyrics of the song refer to an ultimatum that one of Robert's girlfriends had given him ten years earlier.  I think that this song has some elements of the swansong sessions in it, too. Overall, Ten Years gone is one of my favorite tracks from Physical Graffiti and one of Zep's most underrated songs."
led_zeppelin,2nymho,PimJag,2,Mon Dec 1 20:08:22 2014 UTC,I wonder how it would sound live if JPJ just played a regular bass. I always felt like the bass really makes the song in the beginning. But I also love the sound of the b-bender Jimmy used live.
led_zeppelin,2nymho,khmr33,1 point,Tue Dec 2 00:57:15 2014 UTC,"I've never seen a three headed bass, but at Knebworth it was JPJ's triple neck guitar: 6 & 12 string + Mandolin. He switched between the 6 and 12 string during different sections and played the bass part with the foot pedals from his Hammond B3 at the same time..."
led_zeppelin,2nymho,yellowledbetter16,7,Tue Dec 2 02:12:54 2014 UTC,This might be my favourite song ever. Jimmy's guitar work is just amazing - you can hear that every single layer is finely considered.

led_zeppelin,2nymho,PimJag,4,Tue Dec 2 03:14:13 2014 UTC,"i think the thing that puts led zeppelin over other bands is that none of their songs can really be pigeonholed since they all feature so many elements. ten years gone has those soft arpeggios in the beginning and then that riff... then the phased out solo over those jazzy chords and the harmonizing guitars in the bridge. it's not a ballad, and it's not hard rock. sounds cliche but it's just really good music."
led_zeppelin,2nymho,yeah_dawg21,3,Tue Dec 2 00:52:15 2014 UTC,"Best song on physical graffiti. I love when Plant sings the lines, "" Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had  Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good  'Cause it was just the first time, ""  Hits home every time"

led_zeppelin,2nymho,andyman2012,3,Tue Dec 2 01:40:01 2014 UTC,"This is such a good song, but it really came alive when they did it live.  John Paul Jones used a 3 neck guitar (12 string, 6 string and mandolin) as well as played the bass pedals.  Jimmy Page typically used his Telecaster with a B string bender so he could do some really cool bend effects.  Robert Plant used a vocal harmonizer at the end chorus.  It was pretty technical stuff for the 70's.  It also shows just how much those 4 could do live.  The fact that it is a gorgeous song and all of what they did served to try and do the song justice is a great example of what they were capable of.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AEnLAP9XY  You can see all of that live when you watch this version.  Every time Page dips the guitar down, he is bending one string.  It's a cool effect.  Unfortunately, you can't hear JPJ as much in this version, but there are much cleaner versions out there where you can.  It's my favorite Zep tune and I wish it got more love."

I always loved that chord he played live like x-0-14-0-14-0 at the very end.  (Also, very fun to play acoustically if you're a guitarist.

led_zeppelin,2nobm3,boominnewman,3,Sat Nov 29 20:26:37 2014 UTC,"I guess it's just a matter of getting the feel for it. Keep playing along to it, you'll catch on. Tap your foot to a quarter note as you play/listen to the song, it'll help you get a feel for where he comes in each measure."
led_zeppelin,2nobm3,Launchboxed,2,Sun Nov 30 00:00:25 2014 UTC,I think not having vocals to follow makes it a little harder. But this one and black dog and Hots on for nowhere are hard for me with timing  Black dog not so much actually. Just starting correctly.
led_zeppelin,2nobm3,boominnewman,3,Sun Nov 30 00:12:14 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah the vocals pretty much lead most of the song. I have a ton of trouble coming in at the right time for Black Dog too, not so much for Hot on for Nowhere. Gotta get a singer in your band, although nobody wants to attempt singing like Plant haha."
led_zeppelin,2nobm3,PimJag,2,Sun Nov 30 00:17:10 2014 UTC,one of my favorites. i love the funkiness of this song especially during the bridge. i think presence showcases zeppelin's rhythm section better than any other album. drums + bass + guitars in full force.
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,scaryketchup,8,Thu Nov 27 14:41:00 2014 UTC,"First, Happy Thanksgiving everyone, I thought that this song would be a good one for today.  I read somewhere that this song was Robert Plant's tribute to his then wife, Maureen. It's pretty rare that Jimmy Page sings, and in this song he does backing vocals.   In season 5 of That 70's Show, the episode names are all Led Zeppelin songs. S05 E08 was a Thanksgiving episode and was titled ""Thank You"""
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,CamelLoggins,5,Thu Nov 27 14:48:58 2014 UTC,"This is a nice song. Not my favorite, but it's, a nice, soft song that works well with all the hard-hitting tracks on this album."
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,Dakunaa,6,Thu Nov 27 15:17:08 2014 UTC,"Jimmy really loves his Dsus4, D, Dsus2 progression."
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,Launchboxed,6,Thu Nov 27 16:42:52 2014 UTC,"It's a great one! He used it before the solo in stairway I think.  ""Annie's song"" (not zeppelin) and that Tom Petty one, freefalling uses it too.  It's just an open D with your high E string going from an E-F#-G yeah?  Edit. I think it's also used during the ""It makes me wonder"" part of stairway, Tangerine uses it. The ""DA da DA DA, Da DA"" right before the chorus."
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,Dakunaa,6,Thu Nov 27 17:27:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it sound pretty good. Yeah, that's it! Very easy to play, too."
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,Launchboxed,4,Thu Nov 27 17:50:55 2014 UTC,Sounds so pretty though. I always like strumming an open D and just flicking my pinky on and off the G.  The G-F# pulloff makes that progression so pretty..
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,Dakunaa,3,Thu Nov 27 18:53:50 2014 UTC,Absolutely. Once you recognize the progression you start hearing it everywhere.
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,Launchboxed,2,Thu Nov 27 19:10:01 2014 UTC,"Haha I was strumming ""That's the way"" and just noticed he plays the same finger patterns at one point. It's in a G tuning so the chords are different.   It's at the ""That's the wayyy it outta stayyyyyyyyyy"""
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,okcthunder0,6,Fri Nov 28 10:04:36 2014 UTC,One of my favorites.   The best version of this song I think is from the BBC Sessions. One of Page's best solos in my opinion.   I would provide a link to this song on YouTube but I'm driving through the Ouachita Mountains right now and don't have the best of Internet connections.   Edit: found one with bonus Spanish subtitles
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,Frisky_Turtleneck33,3,Thu Nov 27 17:16:13 2014 UTC,One of my favorite songs by zep.  It's has a great ending to the song. The lyrics also match up with a jimi song. I forget the name of it though
led_zeppelin,2nkwrg,ShopOwner2,3,Thu Nov 27 17:38:31 2014 UTC,awesome song from a spectacular album
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,scaryketchup,11,Wed Nov 26 16:31:31 2014 UTC,"This song was originally supposed to be an acoustic piece. It was written at Bron-Yr-Aur, and then recorded for Houses for the Holy. It was then held off, and then was included on Physical Graffiti. The song gained a heavier feel and sound at this point.  I think that this song is highly underrated. It's a shame that this song never really got a full live performance. It did get some short live performances though. Also, Van Halen did a cover of the song and it's pretty cool."
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,justafellowtraveller,6,Wed Nov 26 16:41:38 2014 UTC,"It was performed live in its entirety only once, during a sound check in Chicago on the 1973 tour."
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,FreddiePeterson,4,Wed Nov 26 18:02:56 2014 UTC,That's awesome! Thanks for pointing this out.
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,CamelLoggins,6,Wed Nov 26 19:50:57 2014 UTC,"Love that ""finger-slide"" sound after the first drum beats, gets me every time!"
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,Backinthe70s,5,Wed Nov 26 17:31:24 2014 UTC,I love this song. It fits perfectly with the other five tracks on the first half of PG.
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,whiteylp,4,Wed Nov 26 17:00:22 2014 UTC,The album does flow well for having 4 sides. We were thrilled with every song.
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,led_zeppelin_discuss,5,Wed Nov 26 21:44:37 2014 UTC,The first 5 songs on PG fit so well together. It was never one of my favourite albums until the last few years and now it's one of my favourites. As soon as custard pie starts I just want to jump into bed with someone! Sorry but it's true!
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,led_zeppelin_discuss,6,Thu Nov 27 18:37:01 2014 UTC,"Thanks for continuing these. :)  I had forgotten about these discussions, and this account.  To contribute to the discussion, The Rover is one of my Graffiti favorites. I was lukewarm to it first, but now I love it. Love the guitar by Jimmy, as always."
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,Dakunaa,2,Thu Nov 27 00:39:14 2014 UTC,"No problem! Are you going to continue the discussions from this point on? If not, I have no problem doing it."
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,1859,3,Thu Nov 27 00:59:57 2014 UTC,"I'd probably forget/be too lazy to do them after 10 days max, so you can go right ahead."
led_zeppelin,2nhmvo,Backinthe70s,4,Thu Nov 27 01:01:30 2014 UTC,"The lead in to the solo is just so good. The solo that follows has a great tone, too."
led_zeppelin,2ni959,TurkandJD,3,Wed Nov 26 19:42:56 2014 UTC,Fuckin Love Scrubs
led_zeppelin,2nfbr0,CamelLoggins,9,Tue Nov 25 23:51:04 2014 UTC,I love how it starts with the hard hitting solos in Good Times and then goes to the soft clean track Babe I'm gonna leave you.  You get the idea they're gonna be this hard hitting rock group then get thrown something so pretty.
led_zeppelin,2nfbr0,Launchboxed,4,Wed Nov 26 01:32:47 2014 UTC,"Led Zeppelin is one of, if not the greatest debut album of all time. It has a great mix of short, face paced tracks (Good Times Bad Times, Communication Breakdown) the transitional Black Mountain Side, and long, epic tracks like Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, Dazed and Confused, and How Many More Times. Simply put, I love this album."
led_zeppelin,2nfbr0,dontlethestankout,4,Wed Nov 26 00:01:08 2014 UTC,"It has a great mix of short, face paced tracks (Good Times Bad Times, Communication Breakdown) the transitional Black Mountain Side   In one of the recent interviews with JP he is talking about his role as producer and mentions how important the order of the songs are on the albums.  That the flow was very important.  Couldn't agree more.   How many times to this day are you listening to a song on radio and as it ends you anticipate the next track only to be disappointed?"
led_zeppelin,2nfbr0,scaryketchup,4,Wed Nov 26 12:20:29 2014 UTC,"I agree that this album is one of the greatest debut albums of all time. It's a great showcase of the different genres they experimented with. There's the bluesy rock in You Shook Me, classic rock in Good Times Bad Times, and even slow rock in Your Time is Gonna Come. Also, Jimmy Page's creativity really shows in songs like Dazed and Confused and How Many More Times. One more thing, I get the chills every time Robert Plant screams his lyrics in Babe I'm Gonna Leave You.  I'll post the first (new) song discussion tomorrow."
led_zeppelin,2nfbr0,OnlyVindictam,4,Wed Nov 26 05:49:20 2014 UTC,"The way I see it, I hadn't listened to much Led Zepplin before I gave this album a run through and it blew my mind, and I went on to listen to the whole discography..over and over again. The greatest achievement about it for me is the way certain songs have grown on me over time. I barely remembered How Many More Times the first time I heard it, now I love it.  A great opener in Good Times Bad Times that sets the pace perfectly for the rest of the album and possibly, their musical career."
led_zeppelin,2nfbr0,whiteylp,5,Wed Nov 26 00:04:15 2014 UTC,"Off topic, but I have what's bordering on a phobia of ketchup. Finally username relevant to someone!   Regarding Led Zeppelin... When JPJ was asked which album he would play to someone who had never heard the band he responded with ""the first one, it's all there, right from the word go"". I loved that."
led_zeppelin,2nfbr0,ReallyBadToot,2,Wed Nov 26 00:07:19 2014 UTC,the guitar solo in Communication Breakdown blows my mind every time I hear it.  Ive rewound those 20 seconds hundreds of times in a row
led_zeppelin,2nfbr0,led_zeppelin_discuss,2,Wed Nov 26 16:18:37 2014 UTC,"Thanks for continuing these discussions! :)  I bought the remastered vinyl album a few weeks ago, and it's fantastic. One of the greatest debut albums of all time. Has some great songs like ""Good Times Bad Times"", ""Dazed and Confused"", ""Communication Breakdown"", and ""How Many More Times"". I'm kind of in-between on You Shook Me, but other than that every song if very good to great."
led_zeppelin,2n87ba,scaryketchup,6,Mon Nov 24 03:15:53 2014 UTC,In through the out door is highly underated in my opinion. I absolutely love the song fool in the rain.

The people behind me had a jambox and played a mix of Zep songs from obscure concert recordings for about 4 hrs, which was awesome.  I was super excited as I was making my way up to him. I was fine even when I was next in line, but as soon as I stepped in front and he looked me I was at a loss for words for a moment. Emotions really came out of nowhere, I was trying to keep it together in front of him.   I realized the that the person who strummed the beautiful amalgamation of notes/chords of Stairway to Heaven, who evoked emotions and brought chills to millions of people, who strutted on stage with the aura of knowing he's the best a his craft was smiling at me from across the table. He exuded the humility and kindness of someone who knows that the people shaking his hand is the exact reason why he is so revered. He commented on my shirt! As I walked away I had to hold back tears, I'll say it, whatever.  TL;DR sorry not sorry"

You might already know this, but the neck on that Telecaster (a maple in the picture) would eventually be replaced with the rosewood neck from the famous ""Dragoncaster"" that was used on Led Zeppelin I and the solo on Stairway to Heaven. Jimmy salvaged the neck from the Dragoncaster after it was ruined, and used the B-Bender tele with the now rosewood neck extensively when he toured with the Firm."

led_zeppelin,2lzyd9,DESTROYER3264,2,Wed Nov 12 04:00:49 2014 UTC,"Do you mean the one in 1998, where he says:  ""I still have it (referring to the Dragon Tele), but itâs a tragic story. I went on tour with the â59 Les Paul that I bought from Joe Walsh, and when I got back, a friend of mine had kindly painted over my paint job. He said, ""Iâve got a present for you.â He thought he had done me a real favor. As you can guess, I wasn't real happy about that. His paint job totally screwed up the sound and them wiring, so only the neck pickup workmed. I salvaged the neck and put it on my brown Tele string bender that I used in the Firm. As for the bodyâ¦ it will never be seen again! (laughs)""   I think that confirms what I said.  EDIT: Whether the '59 (Dragon) had a rosewood board originally doesnt matter, it had one when Page recieved it from Beck. The tele pictured above is a 1953 Botswana Brown Tele that page had outfitted with a B-Bender, and then, as he said, eventually put the rosewood neck on from the Dragon. He did have a third tele, a 1966 Cream one used somewhat on Physical Graffiti and on tour in 1980. So it seems pretty clear that the tele in the picture, which he used on tour in 1977, is the same one with the neck from the Dragon that he used with the Firm."
led_zeppelin,2lzyd9,Launchboxed,1 point,Wed Nov 12 04:09:00 2014 UTC,Yes! That's the quote I remember hearing. Do you think at this point (In OPs pic) it had the dragon tele's neck on it? Or later when he was in the firm he put the neck on.   I'd assume he put the neck on from the dragon at this point but I couldn't find anything on that.
led_zeppelin,2lzyd9,DESTROYER3264,1 point,Wed Nov 12 08:05:35 2014 UTC,"No, in OP's pic it still has the maple neck on it. He must've put the rosewood neck from the Dragon sometime between 77 and 79, as it has it when he plays at Knebworth."

He shifted to a Les Paul (both his #1 and the Black Beauty) for much of LZII and III, and the brown telecaster in OP's picture wouldn't be used until later, mainly on Physical Graffiti.

led_zeppelin,2lve1h,w0wzers,36,Mon Nov 10 16:46:46 2014 UTC,"that's not fair.  As a professional vocalist (and one who did a 4 year Led Zeppelin Tribute stint, opened for KISS, etc) i've debated on this topic before.   If I was Robert Plant, I wouldn't want to do it either. It has nothing to do with the money, it has nothing to do with the relationship between the other members.  As a vocalist, Robert Plant cannot sing the way he did that made Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin. I saw him 6 years ago with the Honey Drippers. He performed 4 Led Zeppelin songs --- all were lowered so he could hit the notes. It diminished that wailing, amazing vocal aspect that made this band so unique, what made the songs what they are.  He cannot sing that way anymore. He doesn't want to go embarrass himself --- same goes with his stage presence... Zeppelin and Plant back in the day was so sexual --- he basically gyrated around the stage, flirting with everything, dick on display  You tell me a 65 year old man wants to do that again? No. Way.  These are the reasons Robert Plant does not want to go do Zeppelin again. He basically can't unless he wants to sit on a stool or just stand there, and lower every single song / not do half of them.  The other 2 members (and of course young Bonham) get to stand (sit) around and play their instruments, of course they want to do it... they can still play at the caliber the once did  I'm just sick an tired of everyone getting pissed at Robert Plant for not wanting to tour again. Can't you understand why he doesn't want to?"
led_zeppelin,2lve1h,w0wzers,11,Mon Nov 10 17:05:34 2014 UTC,"Can't you understand why he doesn't want to?   He's been pretty clear about why and it's not his voice issue.  Sure, the guy is in his 60's.  No shit he can't hit notes that he did in his 20's.  Can't hit the women like in his 20's anymore either.    He has for some time been embracing eastern religion/philosophy (Buddhism).  It stresses the Now.  The Past is exactly that - the past. Listen to what he writes now not so much as the way he sings.  It is a much, much different place than a hormonally charged 20 year old he was in LZ.  I doubt that even if he could wave a magic wand and have that voice he once had would he try to go back to LZ as he has no desire to try to go back.   Money isn't any issue either.  He has as much as he needs.  He has actually let go of his ego in all this.  The guy just wants to do what he wants to do.  He owes no one anything.  Got nothing but respect for him."

I actually spoke to Chris a few years back, when he sat in with a tiny local bar band down in Redondo Beach. He said that back in The Firm days, Page was just glad to be out there playing again. And we were glad to be seeing him play, violin bow and all.  I've also spoken with Ricky Phillips, who played bass on Coverdale/Page, and said that Page was pretty laid back, right up until he hoisted his guitar and the magic happened.  And I did see the ARMS Tour. Beck, Clapton, Page, and a whole host of amazing rock stars just out to plays some tunes, raise some money, and have some fun. It was a good night, and a great show.

They can still rock, just in a more experienced groove rather than as the brash young upstarts that they used to be.  Honestly, I think that's why Robert doesn't want to tour as Zep again. He knows he's not 25 anymore, sporting hip-huggers and wailing out those songs like a groupy in heat. He's now exploring new music from a variety of different styles and influences, and reworking some of the Zep classics to fit his current state of mind.  It's not the same, and it never will be, but it's still damn good music.  I'm just hoping that Jimmy's talk about going acoustic opens up some room for Robert to come back and start playing with those songs again, breathing new life into them as reworked classics, rather than stadium-filling anthems.  All we can do is wait and see . . ."

He's having fun, playing with friends, and exploring new genres and new takes on the classic Zep stuff. It's all good.  Jimmy seems to still be stuck back in ""the good ol' days"", which is exactly what Robert is complaining about.  I think it'll do Jimmy good to step away from the old archives and get out and play again. Whether he makes new music, does a whole acoustic Zep thing, or just hooks up with some friends and has some fun, I'll be there to see it."

Edit: http://youtu.be/Lgzs6pT26KI or http://youtu.be/fpigDGf6vXM  I truly believe plant's inability to sing those high notes has to do with a lot of it (hesitation of a reunion) watching the 2007 concert I noticed many of the songs were in lower keys or the instruments themself were tuned down.

I moved The Rover because TSRTS, The Rain Song, and OTHAFA absolutely have to be the three song opener. They're a three set orchestra arrangement.   Houses, The Crunge, Dancing Days, and D'yer Mak'er are perfect together. Upbeat, major, and just a little sly.  I've always thought that IV would've worked better if they'd swapped Going To California and When The Levee Breaks, but I feel differently here. So I moved Black Country Woman from the end in order to transition from our feel-good middle section into the somber No Quarter. I've always felt like the narrator of Black Country Woman is covering up his pain with some sly wit, so it's perfect in this spot.  The Rover is more upbeat, but still menacing and crunchy, so it still has a nice transition coming from No Quarter. Finally, The Ocean is the ultimate album closer, and it would only be my hubris if I placed it anywhere else."

led_zeppelin,2kvvq9,1859,2,Fri Oct 31 17:20:38 2014 UTC,I kinda like that When The Levee Breaks comes after Going To California. The chill folk of the former makes the drumbeat of the latter feel even more obliterating in my opinion
led_zeppelin,2kvvq9,PleaseBmoreCharming,3,Fri Oct 31 22:41:02 2014 UTC,"True. It works really will as is. The end of Going To California feels like a final exhale after an entire album of tension, while the end of When The Levee Breaks is so sudden. That's how I see it, but you're so right about Going To California making that opening kick drum sound like the end of the world."
led_zeppelin,2kvvq9,1859,2,Fri Oct 31 23:22:14 2014 UTC,"Well, I see the album working perfectly with the way it is if you look at it in the format it was originally released in, which is vinyl. The first side of the record consists of: 1)Black Dog, 2)Rock and Roll, 3)The Battle of Evermore, and 4)Stairway to Heaven. Here, we start out with two songs with up-tempo, groovy sounds, then comes a soft acoustic-like piece, and ending with the magnum opus. Furthermore, because it's a record and not a CD or digital format which can immediately start the next song, one has to flip the record to other side, or in this case, we start the pattern of songs over with the second side. The next four songs: 1)Misty Mountain Hop, 2)Four Sticks, 3)Going to California, and  4)When the Levee Breaks, show a similar pattern. First we have the two groovy rock songs, followed by the acoustic piece, and ending the side, and record, with a powerful, timeless classic, which could also be considered a magnum opus by some."

Looking at Zeppelins influences, they were referring to the delta bluesman's wandering performers lifestyle. I remember I think it was Big Joe Williams, traveling companion of the legendary Robert Johnson, who said about the bluesman: it didn't matter they didn't have money or a home. They were free. Free in a time of segregation and share-cropping. More likely than not some lines in ramble on were probably stolen from old blues songs. Deeper/hidden meanings not so much. Idealizing the need to wander in search of the perfect love to cure your blue that's Ramble On all of which is readily apparent in the words and composition of the song. With a little Tolkien (another great wandering tale) splashed in for flavor."

They sound good, but they are carbon copies of the original. If I blindly heard one or the other and I had to say which is which I wouldn't know. And I was really hoping to hear some of their earlier takes on the songs and see the evolution to what the songs were officially released as.  The first three albums Jimmy had released had some pretty good alternate takes of the songs, interesting mixes, and a rare live show. But from what I've heard, this Stairway ""mix"" and Rock N' Roll ""mix"" have been disappointing for me. Still picking up the albums for collector reasons, but I hope the rest of the albums feature more ""rough"" takes."

led_zeppelin,2k191k,ShopOwner2,2,Thu Oct 23 02:21:45 2014 UTC,Zeppelin was an experimental band! Chances are Bonzo just decided to be Bonzo and had already tried play the groove inversely like that. So when it came to recording he decided eh fuck it it sounds cool anyway.
led_zeppelin,2k191k,onelemon,1 point,Thu Oct 23 17:04:35 2014 UTC,"The song as a whole is in two time signatures: 12/8 and 4/4.  The verses are all in 12/8. As a drummer, I count the verses in a 3/4 time signature, but it is written in 12/8. If counted in 3/4, Bonzo plays his snare on the ""one"" of the three beats every measure. If counted in 12/8, Bonzo is playing on the snare every one, four, seven, and ten of the 12/8 measure. He also ""shuffles"" on his hi-hats during the verse. In between those hits/accents on the snares, Bonzo is quietly ""dancing"" on the snare head. These quiet notes are called ghostnotes, because they are soft, and aren't really part of the straightforward beat. They are really there for the groove and the feel of the drummer.  But in the song, at around 3:27, the band breaks down into a 4/4 time signature. Jimmy solos, while Bonzo beats his snare on 2 and 4, and going ape shit everywhere else.  An example of Bonzo creating an unusual drum pattern is heard during the chorus of Ramble On. The syncopation between Bonzo's bass drum and snare are amazing in that song. An ordinary drummer like myself would never do such a thing, as it is very unusual.  EDIT: Some more clarity/technicality"
led_zeppelin,2k191k,The_Impeccable_Zep,1 point,Thu Oct 23 02:44:37 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this analysis of 12/8 time is not really correct. In 12/8, since it is triple meter, as opposed to duple meter (time signatures where quarter or half notes get the beat), there are not technically 12 beats in the measure. There are 4 major beats, comparable to 1,2,3, and 4 in a traditional 4/4 measure, and each major beat has 2 minor beats attached, thus giving the measure the 12 ""beats"" indicated in the time signature. So the beat of a 12/8 measure feels like 1,2,3,4 (as in 4/4), but instead of 1+,2+,3+,4+, like in duple meter, the beats are subdivided as 1+ah,2+ah,3+ah,4+ah. Each major beat would be comparable to a triplet in 4/4.  That being said, in the song, right around 1:20, Bonzo starts playing the snare on ""major"" beats 1 and 3, which sounds different. Feel the main beat of the song at this point and you'll understand (each bass note is the next major beat). However, I agree with you about the chorus of Ramble On. Very interesting drum pattern, and one very often overlooked in the Bonzo drumming catalog, yet it was one of my favorites to learn."
led_zeppelin,2k191k,ultrahobbs,1 point,Thu Oct 23 13:50:39 2014 UTC,At that 1:20 mark in the song he his hitting the snare on the same beat as all the verses
led_zeppelin,2k191k,Launchboxed,-1,Thu Oct 23 15:50:07 2014 UTC,"That's what I'm saying. He's hitting the snare on one and three in the verses where he plays a beat, which is not a traditional rock or Blues beat, where the snare accent comes on two and four. It is just an interesting way to interpret the groove of the song, where most drummers would put the accent where it usually is, on two and four. I'm not claiming he plays each of the verses differently, just that they are an inversion of a traditional rock beat."

Same with 98% or remasters of classic albums, their remastering isn't motivated by people wanting a remaster(seriously, who was ever calling for led zeppelin remasters?), it's motivated by people wanting to make money on a re-release. These ones sound muddier because they're made louder, and the drums are eq'd like drums in modern recording, as opposed to the minimally tinkered-with warm room sound that was so characteristic of Bonham's drumming in the first place. And the genius production aspects that were on the albums from the beginning are made less subtle.  It's all a money grab for re-releasing and reselling the records. Although it is nice to hear some of the unreleased tracks and song versions(but there's not even a ton of those this time around, the additional CDs are mostly just the original recordings with more extreme experiments in remixing them and removing tracks).  Not trying to be a negative-nancy but it's just true, the original releases are practically perfect, they're some of the best produced records ever. And they were always famous for that."

That whole-note chromatic descention is so ordinary, it's a common progression in tons of jazz and popular songs from the 1920s and on. Which isn't to say it originated there, this shit is so obvious in music theory it goes back to Bach-era, and there are certain obvious shapes in playing a guitar that if you look at classical-guitar music from 300 years ago you can see the same basic chord progressions that are used today and 50 years ago in all guitar music, because it's basically the same instrument, with the same tuning, and in terms of music theory it's all obvious shit."

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven#Composition) According to the cited interview, Page said he had the first phrase of the solo set already, and it was the rest that differed between the three versions. Neither of these 2 solos has the same first phrase from the album version.   My best guess is that these were just filler solos that he recorded while they were recording at Hedley Grange. The final solo(s) were recorded back in London, and those are probably still in Jimmy's vault.   These threads give a similar take on these other solo versions.

I ignored the CD for a few weeks, maybe months, but one day I put it in the computer out of curiosity. It was LZ I and Good Times Bad Times started playing. Turned out my Dad had bought the CD for me, but instead of giving it to me and telling me to listen to it, he just left it there for me to find."

At that time I didn't know about Led Zep (I wasn't in the western countries back then). But then one day I heard Kashmir, and then I found out it was by the same guys who wrote Stairway. And then I knew I had to check them out."
led_zeppelin,2j9qa7,256bit,3,Wed Oct 15 12:48:45 2014 UTC,"When Godzilla came out in 1998, Puff Daddy did a track for it called Come With Me and he appeared on SNL with Jimmy and an orchestra behind him. It's Kashmir. I fell in love with the orchestral part. At the time, I was in a CD catalog club and I tried to find Led Zeppelin but all they had here the compilation albums Early Days and Latter Days which, at the time, I thought were great. Hey, I mean, Kashmir was on there. So was Stairway, but for some reason, it didn't really excite me as Wayne's World had me thinking it was going to be a really thrashy harsh song (it was much later that I got the joke, which is that no one wants to hear anyone cobble their way through it).  So from ages 12 to 18, those albums are what I would listen to if I wanted a Zep fix. I was completely unaware of so, so many classic songs. This was all complicated by a techno phase so I never listened to the classic rock station and had zero other exposure. I was also really into Rush at the time, but only through a single cassette take for Moving Pictures that my dad's friend had given me. But, I digress.  Some time in college, there was a program that could rip music from other peoples' iTunes libraries if they were on the same network and I was able to get every single album. In My Time of Dying became my new thing.   After college, I met a Zep lover through work who turned me on to some songs I had passed over like Tea for One or Tangerine. He and I went to see the Led Zeppelin Experience and it's probably one of my fondest memories. Hope he's doing well. I miss that guy.  tl;dr: boring story"

The next door neighbor kid had moved out of his house and his mom told him to clean up his room or she was going to give away all his stuff. He didn't so I got a stack of his records. Among all the Three Dog Night and Rolling Stones was Zep II. I put on side one and heard those five notes that changed my life - the opening to Whole Lotta Love. I was able to figure out how to play it and never looked back."

Then one day not too long afterwards we were riding down the road and I believe it was ""Black Dog"" came on the radio. I liked it and asked who the band was. Went home and downloaded Black Dog on kazaa. Figured ""ah what the hell"" and downloaded a few other of their songs.   The rest is history."

He brings me to his computer, a machine with two hard drives full of just music, and he asked me what kind of music I like.

I wanted hear more of it, but the other songs in the cd didn't sound like that. A few days later we were at a stop light playing the same song and this guy in the adjacent vehicle was just staring at me and then he uttered ""Yea Led Zeppelin rock on"" and, I kid you not, turns up his radio and I hear this song (Kashmir) with this voice that sounds exactly like the guy singing in the first part of that song I stated earlier.

December of last year I decide I need to listen to a wider variety of music, so I compile a list based on a bunch of ""Top Albums of All Time"" lists I find on the internet. I weight each list based on different factors, including how highly they rated albums I liked (mostly The Wall if I'm honest) On my weighted list Led Zeppelin IV was number one, so I bought it and listened to nothing but it for a week. I discovered a new world, I heard things I didn't know existed, it made my soul ache with beauty and passion, and I was in awe.  A few months later, I'm going through finals, and it is really intense, not much time to do anything but study, so I mostly work, eat chocolate, drink caffeine and listen to Zeppelin.  I know I will only have the experience of listening to albums for the first time once, so I'm trying to take it slowly. I bought Physical Graffiti a few months ago (because it had Dazed and Confused). But don't have anything else yet (actually, I bought Mothership before I knew it was a compilation, but I don't listen to it, I don't want to break the integrity of the original album).

The best was Ramble On. The crowd went crazy, no one was expecting that one at all! The songs from his new album were great too. Hands down, the best show I've ever been to. He's still got it."

led_zeppelin,2i4376,ShineOnYouFatOldSun,7,Thu Oct 2 18:25:43 2014 UTC,Each member of the band has/had a fantasy scene. Grant was considered a member of the band so he was given his own fantasy scene which he did as a gangster.
led_zeppelin,2i4376,DBH114,6,Fri Oct 3 00:07:39 2014 UTC,"From wikipedia:   Grant and Cole were filmed as hitmen driving towards Hammerwood Park estate in Sussex in a 1928 Pierce-Arrow car. Roy Harper also makes an uncredited guest appearance as one of the 'greedy millionaires' portrayed at a business meeting of multi-national corporations. Massot envisioned Grant and Cole in the hitman roles, as it symbolised the tough business decisions they made on behalf of the band. The female passenger wearing a scarf with Peter Grant driving on a country road is his wife, Gloria. Massot had originally shot Grant walking a cameraman around a collection of antique cars, but this footage was quickly abandoned."

That was supposed to be some hairy enemy of his, again in real life."
led_zeppelin,2i4376,memebuster,2,Fri Oct 3 01:51:14 2014 UTC,"It is my understanding that it is a tribute to his business ""prowess"". Before Peter grant, bands got 10% of the cut and the promoters got 90%. After Grant and Led Zeppelin, it was reversed. Grant loved to say to promoters (especially Bill Graham) ""Led Zeppelin does NOT need you to make money - YOU need us"" and forever turning the tables in favor of all future bands...it really was the beginning of bands not getting ripped off constantly."

Hats Off To Roy Harper is superior to anything?  What.  3) Sandy ""Dennis""?  Yeouch.  Also, describing Battle Of Evermore as the worst song of IV?  Four Sticks is definitely the least developed song.  Then again, I've got a strong mandolin bias.  4)  Living Loving Maid should be down by Roy Harper.  5)  Since I've Been Loving You should be ranked higher than 21.  6) Misty Mountain Hop is overrated on this list, at #8.  7) Fool In The Rain is amazing.  But #5 overall is at least questionable.  8) Over The Hills And Far Away is #1.  Just kidding, I absolutely agree.  It's exactly where it should be.    EDIT: That said, this list is a real testament to how Led Zeppelin appealed to many different musical tastes.  The author is clearly a fan to have put together such a comprehensive list.  /u/ShineOnYouFatOldSun posted at the same time as me, saying that no real fan would claim that OTHAFA is Zeppelin's best song.  But in my honest opinion I think it is.  So we all have conflicting opinions, despite liking the exact same band.  That's pretty awesome."

This writer makes it sound intolerable. I wouldn't have put Carouselambra so high, but that's just me (Though the lyrics are incredible). This list really just made me angry haha. Edit: Oh and to put Heartbreaker above Stairway? The hipster in me hates to admit that I like Stairway as much as I do. But I would never put Heartbreaker above it. I would have put Kashmir below Stairway as well.

led_zeppelin,2hcngp,smilingarmpits,16,Tue Sep 30 10:48:34 2014 UTC,I edit songs in my head all the damn time. I would have like to have had the opening riff to Tea For One spun off into it's own song. It's great little riff but has no contextual bearing on the rest of the song.
led_zeppelin,2hcngp,danhawkeye,6,Wed Sep 24 18:33:40 2014 UTC,"The intro riff from Tea for One is just so big and stupid (in a good way,) I completely agree that it would make a great song, in the same vein as The Ocean or The Crunge (say what you want about it but it sounds like they had fun recording that tune...,) just pure stupid fun. Caught me off guard the first time I heard that song, for sure, the way it just veers from almost HotH sounding to a slower bluesy song."
led_zeppelin,2hcngp,smilingarmpits,2,Thu Sep 25 00:38:24 2014 UTC,"has no contextual bearing on the rest of the song.   Disagree! It's powerful, revolving and abrasive - just like Presence as a whole. For me, the intro riff to Tea For One says ""Okay that was one feeling on the previous songs - here's another kind of feeling..."" BAM minor blues, arguably more sad than Since I've been loving you."
led_zeppelin,2hcngp,prawnmatic,12,Tue Sep 30 10:50:14 2014 UTC,"I would make sure Bonzo's kick pedal was appropriately oiled before they recorded ""Since I've Been Loving You"" so that you can't hear it squeaking all over the song."

led_zeppelin,2hcngp,danhawkeye,8,Wed Sep 24 19:37:16 2014 UTC,As a kid I had a butchered home tape of Led Zep II that started Heartbreaker right at the stark beginning of the chicken pickin solo. Then it ended with that great little riff with only a few lines of verse. I thought that was delightfully asymmetrical and further cemented my perception of how different Led Zeppelin was from the norm.  I still think the first half of Heartbreaker should be it's own song.   Then the guitar solo should be it's own song with a coda callback to the first song. Because cool fucking progressive rock bands can do that.

led_zeppelin,2hcngp,lessdothisshit,3,Thu Sep 25 02:51:40 2014 UTC,"I agree. I could appreciate it when it was used in When the Levee Breaks, because it's as if he's under water, you know, like what you are when a levee breaks.   I guess for No Quarter they thought it would add to the ominousness and gloominess."
led_zeppelin,2hcngp,ChiefDanGeorge,6,Thu Sep 25 03:19:17 2014 UTC,"I would extend the shit out of communication breakdown. Also the part in how many more times when plant goes ""they call me the hunter"" could be it's own thing. Also, The part in ""that's the way"" when just jimmy comes in at the start of the outro - I have looped that and listened to that 8 second bit for a long long time."
led_zeppelin,2hcngp,lessdothisshit,0,Thu Sep 25 04:30:50 2014 UTC,"The hunter bit was so sexy. Very Sabbath-like. I don't know how to describe it, I just get frisson from hearing it. But part of the frisson comes from the change in tempo and feel from the main riff and booming drums, sort of a juxtaposition of fast and slow, to the slow, sexy, dark part that is the hunter. ""The Hunter"" is definitely an iconic Zep thing, a remarkable thing, because it's slightly out of place in the song. What I'm saying is that a song laid out on the foundation of the hunter riff would not have as much oomph as it does within How Many More Times, you know? I just love Zeppelins bridges.  Same with the ethereal acoustic outro in That's the Way. It's cute (a weird word for it) in that I can see a litter of puppies playing in a field while that outro is playing in the background."

led_zeppelin,2hcngp,FireHazard11,2,Thu Sep 25 00:12:55 2014 UTC,"Fair enough. One more thing, John Paul Jones should have never touched an electric keyboard with a strings synth.

Some of the video was lost but all the audio remained intact. As a fix, they had to dress up again exactly as in the show and the band mimed the missing parts with the real audio playing. See TSRTS Wikipedia page.  This probably has something to do with why Celebration Day and The Ocean aren't in the movie (instead they're in the extras thank fuck) and why the track order on the cd set is different from the concert order.  Regardless TSRTS is my favorite Zep concert.  Let the music be your master..."

Everyone here knows they are an absurdly talented power group, with one of the best vocalists, drummers, guitarists/producers and bassists to ever play rock music, never mind the fact that they shared the same stage.  But man... I still remember how brutally disappointed I was to learn that Jimmy Page ripped off multiple artists' music, oftentimes without any credit given to the original writers, amidst his legendary rise to fame.  Don't get me wrong: I still have... A WHOLE LOTTA LOVE?? ... for the guy, but it was kind of like learning Santa Claus didn't exist, to be honest.

But that is the way music has always been. Good artists borrow, great artists steal.  That being said, While they are similar, if anything I think it was inspired by the song and not stolen. Half-step walk downs happen all the time in pop music and in this case the harmonies are completely different.  If anything, the Taurus song goes on to be more complex harmonically than stairway."

Best damn musical experience of my life.   What was really interesting about them was that they didn't have a singer. Instead they had a guy on keyboard doing all of Robert Plant's stuff. IMO, it worked very well.   I don't have the set list in front of me, but they played a pretty good range of things. They brought out the lead singer for the Alabama Shakes (big black woman) to sing Lemon Song and Darlene. After she absolutely KILLED Lemon Song, she dropped the mic and walked off stage.   They did Moby Dick and the drummer lost a stick in the middle of the solo. He carried on with one hand until a tech guy brought him another stick.   I wish I could relive that moment but, alas, live music only happens once."

led_zeppelin,2eei03,jord0hh,3,Sun Aug 24 03:31:05 2014 UTC,Came here to post about ZOSO
led_zeppelin,2eei03,BonzosLiver,3,Sun Aug 24 04:05:47 2014 UTC,"I haven't seen one of the tributes bands myself(most of them are based in England or the US and they don't bother coming to Sweden I imagine) but I do know there's A TON of them, I don't think saying there's more than 20 professional Zep tribute bands is exaggerating, there's Letz Zep, Fred Zeppelin Lead Zeppelin, Houses of the Holy, No Quarter....   Probably the most cover banded bands ever"
led_zeppelin,2eei03,AvkommaN,2,Sat Aug 23 23:51:44 2014 UTC,"Ha ha yeah I'd imagine if you're good enough you could tour the states or europe endlessly. We're a small isolated island of 4 million, you could maybe try Aussie but I'm sure they'll have their own tribute bands, so these guys definitely do it for the love of it, although I've just been checking out chorus pedals made by the company which is run by the guitarist, so I guess that's his angle. The pedals do look really good. But yeah 20 plus tribute bands is a serious sign your that your band might be legendary. It would be a cool plot twist if Jimmy and JPJ jumped in with one of these bands."
led_zeppelin,2eei03,BonzosLiver,3,Sun Aug 24 00:25:28 2014 UTC,"If you are on the east coast of the U.S. please please do yourself a favor and keep an eye out for ""ZOSO.""   They play and act the part, even look like the guys. Great, great time."
led_zeppelin,2eei03,watchingwombat,2,Sun Aug 24 04:06:39 2014 UTC,"I was there too!  That guitarist was great, he really nailed the way Jimmy Page played.  I thought they all showed that they loved the music that they were playing as they'd learned how to play it properly, and the way that it was supposed to sound.  I was the same as you, closed my eyes and imagined that I was really there."
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,CamelLoggins,8,Sat Aug 23 00:43:28 2014 UTC,Physical Graffiti is my number 1 so it is definitely too low. The first disc of that album is immaculate.
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,DESTROYER3264,3,Sat Aug 23 01:59:05 2014 UTC,The chorus to The Rover is magical.
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,Composingcomposure,7,Sat Aug 23 09:17:42 2014 UTC,"His critique of Physical Graffiti is that it should be a single disc... which shows a blinding ignorance for the format's real limitations.  A non-microgrooved record has a max running time of 22 1/2 minutes per side, give or take...  If you only consider the new material for the album... and absolutely all of it is essential... it can't fit on a single disc.  There was no way around Physical Graffiti being two discs and Jimmy Page did a great job of making the whole thing feel seamless."
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,khmr33,9,Sat Aug 23 03:36:09 2014 UTC,"I think you're missing the point, he means all of it isn't essential and they could cut out half the songs and release it as a single LP with the better half."
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,StevenMunterK,5,Sat Aug 23 03:59:25 2014 UTC,I actually prefer boogie with stu and black country woman over trampled underfoot.
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,Composingcomposure,3,Sat Aug 23 03:12:24 2014 UTC,"Trampled Underfoot is actually one of my favorite Zep songs, from the intro to the blistering solos to the innuendos... It's all Zep"
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,AvkommaN,3,Sat Aug 23 09:56:31 2014 UTC,As do I :)
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,TurniptheLed,4,Sat Aug 23 09:09:46 2014 UTC,Night Flight is another one that I really like that doesn't seem to get a lot of attention.
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,Composingcomposure,3,Sat Aug 23 09:16:34 2014 UTC,I spent about a month listening to the lyrics or the songs on PG and figuring out my own meaning to them.  This made the album so much more enjoyable for me.  Of the songs
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,TurniptheLed,5,Sat Aug 23 09:19:52 2014 UTC,For me it goes   P.G. II IV HotH I III ITtOD Coda Presence
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,Notbillsanders,6,Sat Aug 23 06:55:52 2014 UTC,"You definitely need to listen to Presence more, it's fantastic, when was the last time you listened to Tea for One?"
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,AvkommaN,2,Sat Aug 23 09:58:08 2014 UTC,"I have to agree, Presence is also my least favorite Led Zeppelin album."
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,Ua_Tsaug,3,Sun Aug 24 18:31:49 2014 UTC,Here's my order:   III IV II I Physical Graffiti Houses of the Holy In Through the Out Door Coda Presence
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,guitarelf,2,Sat Aug 23 04:40:43 2014 UTC,"I agree with this, Just switch 4 with 3 and that is my list :D"
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,Maryjane42069,0,Sat Aug 23 04:59:08 2014 UTC,Presence should definitely be last.
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,Notbillsanders,3,Sat Aug 23 06:58:10 2014 UTC,"Just listening to 10 Years Gone - I definitely would have Physical Graffiti ranked much higher, especially given how its always been my favourite Zeppelin album. In fact, its one of my favourite albums by any band!  10 Years Gone, In My Time of Dying, Kashmir, In the Light.... I couldn't see dropping songs from this record to turn it into a single lp. It would have been a shame to have missed out on any of it."
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,popswhalen,2,Sat Aug 23 12:00:24 2014 UTC,I'd switch it and Presence. Maybe switch II and IV.
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,jonfin826,2,Sat Aug 23 00:58:28 2014 UTC,"For me, Physical Graffiti is definitely ahead of Houses of the Holy and III. I still have I in front of PG though. SO II, IV, I, PG, HOTH, III,..."
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,215engr,2,Sat Aug 23 02:47:56 2014 UTC,Physical Grafitti is my favorite.
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,barefo0t,2,Sat Aug 23 03:24:00 2014 UTC,I love In Through the Outdoor and I'm always sad to see that one ranked the lowest or second lowest almost every time.

led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,aneyefulloffish,2,Sat Aug 23 05:16:07 2014 UTC,"That is a pretty horrible list, as far as my taste in LZ goes. I think that Houses and Graffiti were when Zep were at the height of their musical prowess. They could and would try anything, and most times succeeded at it."
led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,GETaylor,2,Sat Aug 23 06:49:42 2014 UTC,"Glad to see a lot of Physical Graffiti fans on this thread. Only with Led Zeppelin can the potentially greatest rock album ever, be the band's seventh best album."

led_zeppelin,2ebtbt,Ua_Tsaug,1 point,Sat Aug 23 17:49:56 2014 UTC,"LZ 3 is probably #1 for me, really because I love Jimmy's acoustic work. IV was the first record I listened to and PG was the first Zeppelin I had ever listened to... So it's a tough call for me. I think it's difficult to place them in order, as they are all different and have their great qualities."
led_zeppelin,2eccbg,maximus9966,1 point,Sat Aug 23 04:42:05 2014 UTC,"Don't know if your still checking this post still, but I've seen them twice. They use different lineups for different bands, so the experience varies, but overall its a great experience. I saw Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zeppelin IV performed by the group. DSOTM was simply amazing, I couldn't stop grinning throughout the entire set. If you can see them play DSOTM, do it, you will not regret it. Now with Led Zeppelin IV, it was pretty good, but I wasn't blow away by it like I was with DSOTM, and I'm more of a Led Zeppelin fan than Pink Floyd fan. I definitely still liked it though it was worth my money at least. I'd keep asking around if you can, however."

I think my favorite bit about the song is how Jimmy Page's guitar playing isn't the main focus of the song as it is with other Led Zeppelin songs; it just sort of melts together with the keyboards and the drums."

Plants voice is powerful, and sounds fantastic."
led_zeppelin,2de006,watchingwombat,4,Wed Aug 13 01:52:50 2014 UTC,"I never thought much of this song until my freshman year of college; but my friends and I would carpool home on breaks, and it was a 10-11 hour drive depending on the weather.   We would listen to Zeppelin's catalogue from I thru Coda on the drive and every time we would be on our way back to school this part of PG would come up just as we'd crossed the Mackinac Bridge and would be driving along the shoreline of Lake MI on the UP side (usually at night).

led_zeppelin,2d8fbt,led_zeppelin_discuss,11,Mon Aug 11 13:46:51 2014 UTC,"What most people don't appreciate about D&C is that nothing like this really existed prior to its creation.   While the lyrics were bluesy, they weren't delivered as such. While the song was in some ways psychedelic with all the panning and swirling guitars, this wasn't psychedelia at all.   This song defined what rock was capable of in a way that could be almost matched but never surpassed."

And then they took it and made it a hundred times better live.  I've always loved the original Song Remains The Same version (which is largely as it was performed on that night).  And the version from the RAH in 1970 is awesome as well.  You can tell Page loved playing that song, it was his opportunity to show how awesome he could be. The other thing that amazes me is how they kept that whole 20+ minutes together, with their little signals etc, so that they always hit the changes - and there were a lot when they were playing live."

led_zeppelin,2d3gdl,AvkommaN,2,Sat Aug 9 20:46:54 2014 UTC,"I have a couple ones:   1979-07-24 Copenhagen, the warm-ups for Knebworth and one of the best shows the did after 1972, Jimmy is on fire and does the best solo on Ten Years Gone he ever did for that song, the whole band is just amazing and it has a great setlist. 1971-11-16 in Ipswich, one of the great from '71, Percy's voice is almost too damn good, the PA system can barely handle it! Early material from IV which is always interesting. 1971-09-29, another amazing '71 show from the superb tour of Japan, the longest from the tour and also with a soundboard as a source, I think it's the second performance of Black Dog too if I remember correctly, a must have as far as I'm concerned. 1973-03-16, my personal favorite of the '73 gigs, the whole Europe tour of '73 shows the band at their technical peak, the only ""bad"" thing is really Robert's voice, he plays it kinda safe but the rest of the band more than make up for it! 1980-06-29 The last one I'll add is the highlight of the 1980 shows, all because of Jimmy's playing, it's not perfect by any means but it's the most solid it ever was during 1980, if you're gonna listen to any show from 1980 it should be this one!   This is just a few shows, if anyone wants more recommendations just ask!

This song doesn't seem to be very popular among the non fans of Zeppelin.  rollingstone.com did a top 40 led zep song list and this song completely misses it.

Also his album in the 2000s was in the top 20 or so of the top albums of the 2000s? Seriously? Also, Rolling Stone also gave the first 3 Led Zep albums a lot of crap, and rated ""The Division Bell"" (a Pink Floyd masterpiece IMO) just 1 star.  I enjoy the Beatles and they are definitely within the top 5 favorite bands of all time for me, but Rolling Stone says ""Sgt Pepper"" is the greatest album of all time. The Beatles are the most overrated band of all time, especially Sgt. Pepper. I actually think their album ""Abbey Road"" may be the greatest album of all time, but that's at like 15 or something. Meanwhile Led Zep/Pink Floyd albums don't touch the top 20 albums.

led_zeppelin,2cj4zx,led_zeppelin_discuss,4,Sun Aug 3 21:22:40 2014 UTC,"I love this song, but it's so different from everything else on LZIV.  The story goes that Bonham couldn't get the track right, and then played it with two sets of drum sticks (i.e. four sticks) and nailed it.  And he does.  I've always really enjoyed the version on Unledded with the Egyptian orchestra, those strings really add something to the song, and Michael Lee seems to be enjoying playing the drum parts."
led_zeppelin,2cj4zx,watchingwombat,2,Sun Aug 3 21:32:02 2014 UTC,"Stylistically speaking, this is obviously the odd track out on IV, although I consider it to be foreshadowing of the awesome genre experimentation we'd get on Houses Of The Holy. Bonzo's drumming is stellar, although you can tell he isn't wholly comfortable with straying away from the core beats too often. Definitely the deep cut of IV, if such a thing is even possible at this point.  Check out the version created when Jimmy and Robert played it with the Bombay Orchestra, as well."
led_zeppelin,2cj4zx,1859,2,Mon Aug 4 13:57:58 2014 UTC,"Best song from IV, narrowly beating out When the Levee Breaks.   This was the song that really singled out Plant's supreme vocal talent for me. It takes a lot of skill to write vocals that sound good over a 5/4 time signature, but to make them independent of the guitar melody and so lyrically complex is the work of a master. This is a fucking awesome song."

I didn't hear the rest of LZII till sometime after that, but someone gave me LZIV and I pretty soon ended up with the rest of the albums.  LZII is amazing, as they say all killer, no filler.  My favourite off the album is The Lemon Song, mainly for that bassline.  I love listening to the isolated drum track from Whole Lotta Love.  You hear how funky Bonham was, and even better you hear him screaming as he does some of the fills near the end (and if you listen to the rough mix from the new versions, you can still hear it).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gtgxe_ientE"
led_zeppelin,2cff6a,watchingwombat,1 point,Sun Aug 3 21:38:08 2014 UTC,"One of my favorite Zepp albums. There is no bad song on this album (as with most Zepp records). This album is so heavy and Jimmy's riff always gets my heart beating faster and causing a moment of awe.  As a drummer myself, this album (along with Led Zeppelin I) helped define what rock drumming will be from now on. First it was simple Ringo, then it was the crazy Baker, then it was chaotic Moon, and then it turned into the hard hitting and technical drumming that John performed on these two albums. The drumming on this album alone completely changed all rock drummers.  ""Moby Dick"" is just mind blowing. This video of Jason Bonham playing along to Moby Dick shows how John is king of rock drumming. Even if you were taught by the greatest rock drummers, you can't beat Bonham's rolls. This video from Royal Albert Hall just displays how rock drummers should play solos from now on. The first time I saw this, I nearly fell off my seat, cause I was so amazed.  This album blows me away every time."

led_zeppelin,2cfe22,led_zeppelin_discuss,2,Sat Aug 2 15:05:41 2014 UTC,"This song has the same chord as Neil Young's Old Man as its opening chord. I personally don't feel that this is an example of the ""light and shade"" philosophy Jimmy Page employed. I think he employed the use of dynamics instead by creating mellow verse parts juxtaposed with loud and aggressive chorus parts, with no real exotic harmonic tricks (other than that jazz chord) being used. They're also using a trick The Who exploited - having the bass line working around a stationary chord, instead of doing it the other way around. Delving deeper into the Zeppelin catalogue, I've found that ""light and shade"" applies more to songs like Ten Years Gone, The Rain Song, No Quarter, and In The Light, due to the modes (using other notes of the major scale to provide contrast, thus changing the harmonic vibe) being employed."

The production is cool and surprising, the playing is great--I could go on, but, they were so panned by the critical establishment. I don't get it, but it's pretty clear that rock writers are complete assholes! This song is great! And it's a great album, and even if hard rock isn't your thing, to dismiss and mock them the way that critics did is just exasperating. I'm thinking of it, I guess, because I was read some Pink Floyd wikipedia entries earlier that noted that Dark Side of the Moon, and Wish You Were here were critical flops. I guess rock writers had such limited vision, they violently rejected music with strongly articulated visions that were different. It's weird to think of LZII and Dark Side as critical flops."

Since I've Been Loving You is a much more joyful and confident work than Tea for One, even though the bluesy lines and guitar work are all about the same kind of emotional torment. I admire Presence, but I don't love it."
led_zeppelin,2cc4t2,Tigeroflove,1 point,Fri Aug 1 19:10:24 2014 UTC,"To really appreciate Presence you have to read the lyrics and reflect how they mirrored Plant's feeling at the time, being injured after the car crash, not really wanting to be in the band and just not feeling happy, it adds so much depth to the whole album"

led_zeppelin,2ccjl6,k0mbine,6,Fri Aug 1 16:40:30 2014 UTC,"Crushed   Wow, just... Calm down for a second...  Remember it's their early albums, and they needed songs. Also, it's not like they full on ripped off the musical arrangements, they added their own flavor, a good example is Bring It On Home, a tribute to the original artist as the intro and outro. The rest of the song is original, except for the lyrics, which you could argue goes along with the tribute to the original artist.  Also think of any original songs by them, Ramble On, Stairway, Achilles Last Stand, Good Times Bad Times, etc. All good, all original. I'm trying to tell you that they aren't good because they ""rip off"", they also have pretty solid originals.  At the end of the day, Zep is Zep. You still rock out to their songs. Go listen to the songs they ""ripped off"" of, can you rock to that? Not quite. Just listen to the music."
led_zeppelin,2ccjl6,khmr33,2,Fri Aug 1 16:56:02 2014 UTC,"Okay, maybe ""crushed"" was a bit of an overstatement - I'll live - but I'm really disappointed.   Shouldn't they have at least credited the original artists? It's one thing to put their name in the credits and admit they were an inspiration, but it's a totally different thing to claim the song as your own. Okay, maybe take a chord out of it, but entire lyrics?  Isn't that rather un-gentlemanly thing to do? Was this a common practice among (rock) bands at the time?  I just wish they'd credited those guys and all of this could have been avoided altogether. Am I making sense here?  BUT, at the end of the day, nobody can deny that Zep used their own talent to distill those songs into something completely different, something beautiful - rock in its most primal and purest form."
led_zeppelin,2ccjl6,AvkommaN,2,Fri Aug 1 17:21:29 2014 UTC,"A lot of these old blues songs aren't original. There are guys that have the ""credit"" for writing some of the songs but they probably still learned them from someone else.  The songs probably existed for generations before anyone started taking credit for them. Really the credit goes to whoever recorded it first.   What Led Zeppelin is guilty of is being about 40 years ahead of the remix culture. As far as I'm concerned their versions are original."

led_zeppelin,2ccjl6,1859,2,Sat Aug 2 04:35:35 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about it, a couple of the examples given are pretty weak. I've heard the Stairway example and it would be stretching it to say that Zeppelin ripped it off. If that was the case, why wait until after the original artist had passed away and the Zep albums were being remastered and re-released before deciding to take legal action against the band. As well, Jimmy Page was a member of the Yardbirds, so technically he was ripping himself off.   There was and is a lot of music being used and re-used over the years - there are only a finite number of chords available, so repetition is bound to happen. On top of that, Zeppelin has never hidden the fact that they were heavily influenced by the old blues artists. Crank up Ten Years Gone and continue to enjoy an epic band!"
led_zeppelin,2ccjl6,AvkommaN,2,Fri Aug 1 16:55:35 2014 UTC,"Zeppelin wasn't doing anything other artists weren't already. Everyone does covers and the purpose should be to tribute the artist who created the song but also give it your own twist. This was really the case back in the 60's blues scene. Everyone had their cover of Blue Suede Shoes, Hound dog, etc. However Zeppelin took a bunch of underground tunes no one knew and rockified them. It's less crazy now but the way Zep played those sounds was very new to a lot of people listening. Add to the fact that they hadn't been together longer than 2 weeks before they recorded the first album, they simply needed material quickly to put onto the album. They just did what every blues artist they looked up to was already doing."
led_zeppelin,2ccjl6,Wagtacular,2,Fri Aug 1 17:18:19 2014 UTC,"Well Jimmy definetly got that Stairway opening riff from that band Spirit or Taurus (cant remember which one is the band and which one is the song). But its literally just these few notes(which are iconic tho). But they ovciously knew how to use them better. Then there are some lyrics they got from other artists, but no one can quite lay them as Plant can.  Every band has influences. But when a band suddenly has huge success there's gonna be people that will say that it was their material. But in the end they couldn't pull it off the way Zep did.  I didn't do any research on this, but I think Zep got sued quite a few times and also lost quite a few times, so justice had its way, if you will. I just love the way Plant sings and I don't really care who wrote the stuff he is singing, because I'm pretty damn sure they wouldn't sing it as good."
led_zeppelin,2ccjl6,GGPapoon,2,Fri Aug 1 17:27:43 2014 UTC,"On the topic of borrowing blues lyrics: Robert was raised in the blues, where bluesmen would borrow each others' lyrics all the time. In his eyes, he was taking part in that tradition. Pretty much every other aspect of the songs are completely different from the original piece, including vocal melody. They are most definitely Zeppelin songs. Most of these artists have since been credited for their lyrics, as well."

When the drums and bass kicked in, I nearly had to pull over. Bar none my favourite musical moment of any Led Zeppelin number. As soon as the tune starts, I can already feel the anticipation building up. The rhythm guitar during the solo section is also much cooler than expected.

It's the little things that make this song.  I'm split on the live versions, because I like each for different things.

The opening is basically E A E A over and over, but with a load of chord embellishments to fill a room.  I love playing it, the live version and the studio version.  When Jimmy played it on ""It Might Get Loud"", I was shell shocked on how easy it looked to play that version (I was yelling at the camera man to keep it on the guitar!!!)  The studio version is a thick mix of guitars and tones, a feel and vibe hard to mimic.   Then came the ""Celebration Day"" version.  One guitar, one voice.  Excellent."

And later I came across Ramble On and loved it. And it blew my mind after finding out that Stairway and Ramble On were both by Led Zeppelin.
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,led_zeppelin_discuss,4,Sun Jul 27 17:10:30 2014 UTC,Isn't this Page and Plants response to punk music at the time?
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,yaminub,3,Sun Jul 27 17:29:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it was their response to the punk community referring to Zeppelin and their like as ""dinosaurs"". Unfortunately, in my opinion, it comes across as defensive and a bit self-conscious. Wearing And Tearing feels like the first time Led Zeppelin were followers instead of just doing their own thing.   They'd already written the prototypical punk song, in 1968: Communication Breakdown."
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,1859,3,Sun Jul 27 17:38:41 2014 UTC,"Led Zeppelin didn't write it as a punk song, and it is not a punk song, but Led Zeppelin wanted to play with the same energy as punk bands at the time."
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,1859,1 point,Sun Jul 27 17:40:51 2014 UTC,"True. That's what I mean by it being a response to punk, not a punk song in itself. I can't imagine Jimmy being satisfied with a barebones punk arrangement"
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,Learicist,3,Sun Jul 27 17:54:41 2014 UTC,"This song is relentless; and not having known anything about the element of it being a response to punk music, I was always impressed by the power of the riffs, the all out assault of the transitions and the aggressive attitude delivered to the listener. Such a kickass way to close an album. As an observer unaware of the correlation, I never felt defensiveness or forced emotion in this track. I'm always secretly waiting for it throughout the whole album"
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,K-bohls,2,Mon Jul 28 04:04:12 2014 UTC,"I too didn't know this song was created as a response to punk, it simply sounds like a more driving Zeppelin song.  Ironically, as someone who only rarely likes punk music this song doesn't hold too much appeal for me when an underrated classic such as Poor Tom also exists on the same album."
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,scaryketchup,2,Mon Jul 28 11:21:54 2014 UTC,"Interesting to see them try punk. I read that this song was going to be released under a fake band name, so that it could actually compete with punk bands instead of being judged as a Zeppelin song."
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,Dakunaa,1 point,Sun Jul 27 17:41:28 2014 UTC,Excellent song. Still that roughness of Zeppelin in a punk veneer. Very memorable riff and great transitions.
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,Tigeroflove,1 point,Mon Jul 28 11:47:23 2014 UTC,"I don't like much (if any) Zeppelin after Physical Graffiti. Not because it's not great, which it is, but it's dark in a way that, for me, stands in great contrast to the earlier stuff. I love LZ for the great positive contrasts, light and dark, sun and moon, dudes and chicks, and I think that while the music may still seem like the same band in a technical sense on the later songs, the spirit does not match. All the later stuff sounds like heroin to me, and that makes me sad."
led_zeppelin,2bvb37,ignaciolasvegas,1 point,Tue Jul 29 19:52:26 2014 UTC,"I like the reverb that is present in this one. Everything sounds so thick and atmospheric - you almost feel like you're in the room with them. If I'm not mistaken, JPJ is on an 8 string bass (like the entire Presence album), and the only way to play one is with a pick, naturally giving it a harsher tone than the dampness of finger picked bass lines. It's such an asskicker of a song, and there are minor imperfections in it that add to its ""one take"" feel."

led_zeppelin,2bsfnf,led_zeppelin_discuss,7,Sat Jul 26 16:53:14 2014 UTC,"Actually probably my favourite song by them. It's a solid reggae piece by a non-reggae band, and the guitar solo is unmistakably Jimmy. Bonzo's drumming is crisp and tight yet loose."

led_zeppelin,2bsfnf,Phifty2,1 point,Sat Jul 26 19:37:25 2014 UTC,This is one of the best songs for the Summer. It has such a good vibe to it. Bonzo's drums are epic on this track.

led_zeppelin,2bsgr6,led_zeppelin_discuss,4,Sat Jul 26 17:05:48 2014 UTC,To me this is not what you would expect from a bands first album. I find a rookie album is when a band experiments to find it's sound. For me this isn't the case for Led Zeppelin. This album has tracks that already show the band's diversity. I think this is a testament to Jimmy Paige's creativity and may also be due to the experience he had with The Yard Birds.
led_zeppelin,2bsgr6,TheRealSpaghettino,3,Sat Jul 26 21:01:45 2014 UTC,"Great album. Showcased their ability to be lean and mean (Communication Breakdown, Good Times Bad Times) and paying homage to great blues songs and riffs by adding the heavy Zeppelin sound. This wasn't some guys just fucking around. This was a group of amazing musicians whose distinct talents, inspirations, and styles came together to form a whole greater than its parts. A great introduction to the band if a little short on original material.   It's going to be hard to review the albums. It's Led Zeppelin. It's all amazing."
led_zeppelin,2bsgr6,Phifty2,2,Sat Jul 26 21:19:04 2014 UTC,I thought that it was kind of a good show of whats to come in the early days of their career. Too bad YTIGC didn't really show up again.
led_zeppelin,2bsgr6,dairydevil,1 point,Sat Jul 26 23:04:28 2014 UTC,"Very interesting for a first album. Great album to listen to when looking for diversity in their music. You find rock n' roll in Good Times Bad Times and Communication Breakdown, blues in You Shook Me, and slower rock in Your Time is Gonna Come. Also, the creativity of Jimmy Page is shown in all tracks, especially Dazed and Confused and How Many More Times. HMMT is my favorite track on the album."
led_zeppelin,2bsgr6,scaryketchup,1 point,Sun Jul 27 02:18:41 2014 UTC,"What a fantastic album.  How can an album with I Can't Quit You, How Many More Times, Dazed & Confused be anything but fantastic?  And then there are all the other songs, which are pretty much just as awesome.  And listen to Bonzo's kick drum technique on Good Times, Bad Times - no double kick drums in those days, it's all just skill."
led_zeppelin,2bsgr6,watchingwombat,1 point,Sun Jul 27 09:16:42 2014 UTC,"It's explosive, and it sounds so young. It sounds almost like they played it live. Not at much of a studio sound as all the later ones, although, Jimmy is clearly creative and right at home as producer. I like hearing the songs from this record on live recordings better than listening to the album, though. I would put on a different album to listen to for the sake of an album."

Jan 22 1973 - Southhampton.  Great sound quality, loose performance and they sound like they're having fun. The Garden Tapes (Madison Square Garden 1973, 27th-29th July) - The performances that The Song Remains The Same was built from. Worth listening to in their original form (and after Jimmy Page butchered them for the re-released soundtrack) Feb 14th 1975 - St Valentines Day Massacre.  Awesome. 1975 Earls Court Performances (All of them). 28th April 1977 (Destroyer) - one of my favourite 1977 performances (also Listen to this Eddie from 21st June).   That's my favourites, there are many great performances though"
led_zeppelin,2b6z2l,watchingwombat,2,Sun Jul 20 07:59:39 2014 UTC,"I though I could give some alternatives to these ones from around the same time:   Mar 7, 1970 - Montreux Casino, in my opinon a superior performance than RAH but without the superior sound quality and video. Mar 16, 1973 - Vienna, again not quite as nice recording but with a better performance by Robert, the rest of the band is also flawless like they always were in 1973.   Agree on the Garden Tapes, May 5, 1973 - New Orleans is also a great show.  Feb 12 is also great, check out ""Four Blocks of Snow""  June 23, 1977 has the slight edge on 21st I think  July 24th, 1979 is one of their best shows ever, amazing recording with a brilliant performance with a perfect setlist.  June 26, 1980 - Zurich. A lot of people hate on Zep in 1980 and I think that's really harsh, there are moments of pure brilliance, like this show"

led_zeppelin,2b2a2s,PharmacistPete,1 point,Sat Jul 19 01:58:48 2014 UTC,"I don't really find that to be the case, especially with Bonamassa's live work. I saw both Joes play live in 2010, a couple of weeks apart, and found Bonamassa to be the better of the two because of the soul and passion he put in every note. A true bluesman, he was a great pleasure to watch. Sadly, although I consider myself a Satriani fan, he was just a bloke on stage calmly playing guitar, albeit brilliantly."
led_zeppelin,2b2a2s,night_owl,1 point,Sat Jul 19 11:57:37 2014 UTC,"well agreed to disagree then.   I've listed to quite a bit of Bonamassa and seen his live shows and I thought the show was basically a cross between a Stevie Ray Vaughan impersonator and Joe Satriani.

I started learning it when I had only been playing for a year and I spent 20 minutes learning 20 secs of music. The riffs in black dog are simple but getting the timing right without playing along is hard if you're playing in a band setting. Jimmy is mainly a 3 finger player, but he plays fast and kinda sloppy so sometimes it's hard to get it perfect. Good luck!"
led_zeppelin,2an82g,Composingcomposure,-1,Mon Jul 14 10:19:14 2014 UTC,Black Mountainside and Black Dog are not hard. I already know about half the discography. Songs like Achilles Last Stand are the tough ones.

led_zeppelin,2an82g,Composingcomposure,1 point,Mon Jul 14 19:35:50 2014 UTC,"Also I said the riffs for black dog are easy. There are a lot of time changes though which make it difficult to play in a band setting. They're are four time signature changes alone on the first page of this sheet music and the timing of the song as a whole does not scan. http://www.sheetmusicdirect.us/sheetmusic/song/1000138792/black-dog?redirect=1  So ya. Those dongs are difficult in their own ways. Most people guitarists can play most of Jimmy's solos but remembering all of the changes in black dog or doing the hybrid finger picking on white summer/black  mountainside take a lot more talent then Achilles Last Stand. I love Achilles Last Stand for his guitar work. Jimmy doesn't do harmonized leads all that often but I love when he does. I don't mean to dog on your reply, but I gotta defend my response."

led_zeppelin,2ak8k4,zephead007,3,Sun Jul 13 17:16:32 2014 UTC,"My best guess is ""Wearing and Tearing,"" recorded on Nov. 21, 1978. source  I'll look through some of my Zeppelin books later and see if I can find anything else, but this looks like a pretty definitive list of session info.  Edit: Here's another source that puts ""Wearing and Tearing"" as the latest-recorded song (minus overdubs & mixing) that has a definitive recording date. There may have been some recording in December 1978, but I can't find anything that puts a firm date on any particular songs."
led_zeppelin,2ajzol,PACJ_Ltd,2,Sun Jul 13 02:05:54 2014 UTC,"Here's how I look at it. I separate Led Zeppelin's music into three ""eras"": I, II, III; IV, Houses of the Holy, Physical Graffiti; and Presence, In Through the Out Door, Coda.  The idea is that each of these eras has a similar artistic style to it, so I tend to pick my favorite era, rather than album. The IV, Houses, and Physical era is my favorite, with the I, II, and III era in second."

led_zeppelin,2ahvzl,DBH114,3,Sat Jul 12 09:37:20 2014 UTC,"I passed over it a lot until I listened to ITTOD the other day, and as I did, I looked up the lyrics to Carouselambra because Percy's vocals are deep in the mix, and damn, the lyrics to that song are among his best. Honestly, the synths are a bit much, even being a prog rock fan myself. I feel like they should have taken I'm Gonna Crawl and maybe another tune and swapped it out for some of the passed over tracks on Coda. But I will say that Hot Dog is a great song and how dare any of you insult it..."

Carouselambra is not only one of the songs I am always most proud to show off as a 'true' Zep fan to new listeners as well as fans for years who have yet to find the hidden gems of the discography. It is a work of musical mastery as well as rhythmic potency and was written with a true awareness of the listener as a passenger on the roller coaster of the song. It is the Medusa (reference to a very smooth and well run ride at Six Flags in NJ) of Zep songs, in that you'll just want to ride that Carousel again when they tell you it's over."

led_zeppelin,2ahvzl,Samurai-Vortex,1 point,Sun Jul 13 14:06:01 2014 UTC,"My take on it is that if you can get past JPJ's (and the era's) blatant overuse of the synthesiser, there is a masterpiece in this song. The lyrics are evocative of a great mythology-influenced journey, as with the lines ""All was joy and hands were raised toward the sun,"" and ""await their place within the ring of calm."" The ""ahhahh""s that separate the first verses are, from a music theory standpoint, very uplifting, very mixolydian sounding.  I wish they could have done this one on Unledded, with a full orchestra replacing JPJ's parts - the only way to do his parts justice."
led_zeppelin,2aich9,The_Impeccable_Zep,9,Sat Jul 12 13:48:07 2014 UTC,Achilles Last Stand is my favourite LZ song. It is just mind-blowing.
led_zeppelin,2aich9,russianguy,2,Sat Jul 12 16:53:29 2014 UTC,"It took me awhile to ""get into"" Presence. The more and more I listen to it, the more and more I enjoy it. Listening to it just once doesn't seem to ""hook"" people as much as some of their other albums do. The list of my favorite albums and songs is constantly changing. In Through the Outdoor used to be low on my list too, but it soon became one of my favorites."
led_zeppelin,2aich9,scaryketchup,2,Sun Jul 13 01:11:30 2014 UTC,"At first listen I wasn't a huge fan. That was only a month ago. Now I love this album. The three tracks I mainly love -- Achilles Last Stand, Nobody's Fault But Mine, and Tea For One -- are amazing and are the main reason I'll sit down and give it a listen.  Now, the other songs -- For Your Life, Royal Orleans, Candy Store Rock, and Hots On For Nowhere -- range from ""fine"" to ""pretty good"". Royal Orleans and Candy Store Rock are tough to love. For Your Life is rather un-Zeppelin like but it still succeeds in being a good track. Hots On For Nowhere is a bit of funk rock, and it's a sold track.  The only things I complain about are that Robert Plant's vocals aren't as energetic. This can be excused, because he was in a car crash, and he was in a wheelchair when recording vocals for some of these songs. At first I felt like the guitar riffs on Presence were kind of corny/cheesy, but now that I know them, I love them.    Presence: 4 out of 5 stars"
led_zeppelin,2aich9,411connor,2,Sun Jul 13 02:24:01 2014 UTC,"I took a long time to get into Presence as well.  It's an album that doesn't grab you like the first four albums do, but rewards you for listening over and over again.  It's a complex album, with some bits that don't really sound like Zeppelin, and some typical Zeppelin epics.  It's now one of my favourite albums, and I listen to it more than any other.  I love the non-traditional songs like For Your Life (what a thrill to watch them do it on Celebration Day), and Achilles Last Stand just blows me away every time.  And to think Jimmy Page was wasted on heroin when recording those intricate guitar bits..."

I remember not liking Dazed and Confused the first few times I've heard it, since I wasn't used to long guitar parts. You just don't have them nowadays so that threw me off that song for a while.

Think TSRTS, when Bonzo and Jonesy are looking and nodding at each other while playing.  Once you've checked that one out, play Achilles, the ""mighty arms of Atlas"" part:  the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth from the Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oooooh...         --------------------------------   That's it!"

This is just a funny theory, what I like to think:  5:52 - San Francisco section / Achilles  5:57 - Bonzo comes in a bar earlier. Jonesy looks at him like ""Already?""  6:04 - Next bar, the Bonz is shy of filling in. Jonesy goes ""No?"" and Bonzo goes ""naah, light and shade John"". Then Jonesy goes ""Aight"".  6:11 - Bonzo fills in the end of the next bar, and Jonesy literally goes ""Yea"". There he is already beginning to channel Jonesy's groove for the fill in the final bar.  6:17 - There he is, swinging and banging one beautiful drum fill. And look at Jonesy's joy while the camera pans out!"

I met a guy there that had lost his right arm at the elbow. The upper arm was pretty much useless, but he'd had the full Swan Song tattoo done on it. He'd flown over to the UK to see Page play at the Royal Albert Hall when that was the only show planned. When they announced a few select US dates, he got those tickets and followed the whole tour. That left quite the impression on young me . . .  There was also a skinny young thing making her way through the crowd who kept asking burly guys if they were strong enough to hold her on their shoulders when the show started.

So yes....I would see this group with a different front as long as JPJ was in the mix. Hell...what am I saying.... I would see anything if Page was involved. Had tickets to see him and the crows in Indy but he ""hurt his back"" and they had to cancel (low ticket sales) but damn those boots sounded good."

Also, Jason is a great guy and he has the name, but he doesn't drum like his father. Granted, no one does drum like Bonzo, but there are other drummers who come closer to his skill set and sense of groove (which I felt like Jason lacked in the O2 show) that would tighten up the sound. Dave Grohl comes to mind."

Rock ânâ roll had once been art for artâs sake, or the worldâs sake: now it was just art for moneyâs sake, and Page & co. didnât even have the decency to pretend otherwise.   That's not true at all. Jimmy Page has stated in at least one interview that he formed Led Zeppelin because he genuinely likes playing. The amount of money that the band made was due to Peter Grant's knack for demanding as much of the profit as possible from the concert venues Led Zeppelin played at."

Hendrix absolutely kills it and it is my personal favorite song of his, and many consider it to be his best live solo.

led_zeppelin,27f4fs,zzazazz,2,Thu Jun 5 21:58:57 2014 UTC,"I got the Super Deluxe Edition box set of Led Zeppelin II. Its my favorite album so thats the one I had to go all out on. The hardbound book has a bunch of pretty cool stuff like pictures from the tours, original photo that was used on the album cover, photos of receipts from their recording sessions, etc. For a Zeppelin fan this is pretty cool to have.   The digital downloads come in a FLAC format and sound pretty amazing. I haven't busted out the albums yet for my turntable since I just got it yesterday and I have young kids that put their hands on everything they see. They are in school today and Ill give them a spin in a bit.  The previously unreleased tracks are essentially different versions of the album songs just in a different arrangement. Really cool stuff to listen to!  I plan on saving some cash for Led Zeppelin IV. If you got the cash I recommend picking them up. For your not so favorite albums, don't go all out unless you just have a whole bunch of cash to burn."
led_zeppelin,27f4fs,Splatapotomus,1 point,Fri Jun 6 13:45:45 2014 UTC,"Are they significantly higher quality than the previous CD releases? I've always thought that Immigrant Song and Adding Tensions The Same were too muddy, for example"
led_zeppelin,27f4fs,1859,2,Fri Jun 6 19:19:33 2014 UTC,"I'm only an amateurs audiophile, so you may want to check out some professional reviews, but I will tell you this... The mid and low ranges are much more fleshed out. You know how The Immigrant Song has always been very much on the treble side? You can REALLY hear John Paul Jones and John Bonham in a much more wider spectrum and actually feel the bass and drums. It's like hearing the albums for the first time again."
led_zeppelin,27f4fs,Splatapotomus,2,Sat Jun 7 02:51:37 2014 UTC,That is so exciting to hear.  The original CD mix has always kinda ruined The Immigrant Song for me.  Thanks!
led_zeppelin,27f4fs,1859,2,Sat Jun 7 02:54:19 2014 UTC,"Immigrant Song is still washy sounding but nowhere near as bad as the original version.  There still isn't a lot of bass, and the drums are pretty brassy, but the overall mix is better and allows what bass there is to stand out a bit more.  It certainly isn't as thunderous as some of the well recorded live performances that are available, but it's a big step up from the original and early remasters.  For reference, I've listened to all three RI's through decent home speakers, my near field monitors, and 2 different pairs of studio quality headphones.  I would say that the most obvious differences are in the noise floor on the drum tracks.  Where the original mixes are extremely splashy and eat up a lot of mix, the RI mixes have some really nice kit separation which opens up room for JPJ's bass to sit higher.  Guitar and vocals have always been high in the mix and not needed much, but with the tightened drum track, everything seems to be at a more balanced level which makes the overall perceived volume seem louder.    Another cool thing with the reduced noise floor; there are all these recording idiosyncrasies and techniques that really pop now.  The squeaky kick pedal that you've always been able to hear on Since I've Been Loving You is an obvious example, but there are weird vocal things that really jump out, some overdubbed guitar work that's now really split off and accentuating rather than mono-mixed into a wall of guitar.  You can also get a really good impression of the reverbs and delays that they were experimenting with, Gallows Pole being a really good example on Plants voice and Pages acoustic.  Note:  I'm just a big music fan with a basic understanding of mixing.  There are probably people here who know more about what's actually been done on these, I'm just giving you what I hear and how I think it's happening.    Overall, I'm very happy with these reissues.  They may not be much to a casual listener, but as a huge Zep fan and someone who loves to crank tunes up to practice my critical listening, these are pretty neat."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,Evelicity,16,Wed Jun 4 15:05:59 2014 UTC,I think reunions are overrated. Most of the time it won't be as good as everyone expected. Plant is doing his thing and is perfectly satisfied with it.

led_zeppelin,27ant3,Mattakusisgreatness,10,Wed Jun 4 15:26:56 2014 UTC,"Plant wants Page to go bed, wake up and see things in a different light. Basically see things from his point of view."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,_coda_,7,Wed Jun 4 16:17:58 2014 UTC,Plant is just self conscious about his voice. I think he still sounds great but I don't think he feels that way about it.
led_zeppelin,27ant3,Mattakusisgreatness,8,Wed Jun 4 17:00:35 2014 UTC,"I don't get what his problem is.  He's perfectly happy singing his non-Zeppelin stuff, and he usually tosses in a Zep or a Page & Plant tune in almost every night, so I find it hard to believe he's really all that self conscious about it.   Besides, you heard Celebration Day same as me.  Of all the old geezers still trying to ""rock"" at his age, he's by far the one whose voice has lasted the longest."

led_zeppelin,27ant3,HardwareLust,1 point,Mon Jun 16 11:55:26 2014 UTC,"Weird, because most people, even ones who aren't fans of Rush, would say that his voice got better with age."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,Travisx2112,1 point,Mon Jun 16 16:48:05 2014 UTC,"I don't think so.  He can't go anywhere near the high registers like he used to be able to.  You can definitely hear the difference, esp. when he sings older tunes.   Not saying it's bad or unpleasant, but his voice has definitely changed over the years, and he doesn't have near the range he used to.  I still enjoy it."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,HardwareLust,2,Mon Jun 16 17:13:55 2014 UTC,"I'd say he has very similar range to his old range. He can still sing Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, and Analog Kid fine, for example. The only think they really tune down regularly out of their whole catalog is 2112: overture/temples."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,Travisx2112,1 point,Mon Jun 16 17:31:44 2014 UTC,"He can also still sing Working Man fine, too"
led_zeppelin,27ant3,Travisx2112,1 point,Mon Jun 16 17:54:37 2014 UTC,Sir. I implore you to find recordings of the first days of their tours instead of recordings of the final days. For example: I've seen Geddy sing at the beginning of a tour; amazing. I've seen Geddy sing at the end of a long stretch; not so great.    I was blown away by how well he could still sing after all these years.

led_zeppelin,27ant3,Uglyhead,3,Thu Jun 19 08:35:45 2014 UTC,"IMO, Plant doesn't want to get back together and tour as Led Zeppelin because his singing has gone down hill since the days of early Zep. You can hear it progressively get worse if you listen to the live shows from the early to late days. His range gets lower and he can't whale nearly as much as he did in the beginning. You can also hear it in the O2 concert. Jimmy's guitar was tuned down a full tone. They played good times bad times in D instead of E."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,Laughing_Chipmunk,2,Thu Jun 5 08:53:02 2014 UTC,"It's clear that Page, Jones and Bonham Jr. are geared up and ready for some more live shows. Plant doesn't want to, yet when he appeared at the Jazz Fest in New Orleans 2 months ago he played about a dozen songs and fully HALF of them were from the Zeppelin catalog. So I can quite easily understand Page's frustration. Robert is free to do whatever he wants but he's acting like a diva. Too bad."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,dukemantee,4,Fri Jun 6 18:59:59 2014 UTC,"Page has been resting for too many years, its time for him to play some more shows! In my opinion Led Zep should continue without Plant. After all, Plant can no longer sing those old songs and is no longer interest din doing so. I say Page should go on a solo tour or go on a Led Zeppelin tour with himself, Jones, and Jason Bonham as well as a new singer. Its better than nothing."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,AmericanRover,8,Wed Jun 4 16:32:08 2014 UTC,"It's a shame none of Page's post Zeppelin work lasted very long. I loved the Firm, Outrider, Coverdale Page, and the live album with the Black Crowes. But I think after Zeppelin, he just never found a songwriting partner that he could really click with, including Plant, if you listen to Walking Into Clarksdale."
led_zeppelin,27ant3,SambaLando,3,Wed Jun 4 17:18:16 2014 UTC,"Really? If Celebration Day is anything to go by, Plant can still kill it. Maybe not some of the really high screams, but still not bad."

Jimmy's been pretty nervous and called the intro speech to an end with a ""I'd like to add something: we'll talk later - enjoy the music!"" or something along the lines.. Cheeky hahaha  Unreleased tracks:  Communication breakdown:  raw and energetic (as he just said) if a bit untidy. Bonzo all over the place as usual.. what a feel. Heavy use of cymbals. Jonesy keeps the bass on a rollercoaster. As the less sloppy of the four, He really knows how to play. Robert is absolutely stunning in siren mode - the hightlight of the track.  Hearbreaker: Bonzo upfront sounds awesome, and makes me wonder what if other tracks had the drums like this one: poweful, clear and upfront. Lead guitar sounds as if the ""bright"" / treble channel is muted, it sounds really mean and muddy. Vocals have more room for adlibs. Guitar solo: different - longer, more ups and downs and whirls. Heart!!  Whole lotta love: we've listened to this one a thousand times already. Quite along the lines of Heartbreaker: vocals are looser (lyrics change a bit too), guitar sounds similar, crunchy, even ""synth-ier"" I'd say! Could it be the drums are a bit phased? Maybe it's the stream. Cool. Here comes the break. More progressive. Robert mumbles a ""Yoou'veee.. beeen... yeeaaar..niiing"" almost like a child! How cool is that!! Robert's voice at its best in my opinion: not Danish TV screaming boy, but a bit crunchier, raspier, with with an enourmous delivery.   Gallows pole: Robert's voice dominates the mix, until the drums (and percussion, there has to be some tablas in there) come in. Bass is quite buried. Gallows pole sounds really magnificent and pompous on the record, this sounds like a hell of an acoustic set. I'd love a ""led zep II multitracks"" treatment for Gallows Pole - Robert's voice is incredible too, if less pompous than in cuts like WLL, etc. This is a great jam, but I can see why they decided to work it out a bit more - it doesn't sound as progressive as the album record (progressive as in the adjective, not ""prog-rock"").  OK SINCE I'VE BEEN LOVING YOU IS HERE:  Starts pretty similar, with a different touch. ""Hey!"". Guitar lines and scales obviously differ, as this one was also a live take. The loose 12 bar drumming and the bass pedals are equally (if not more) surrounding than on the album. Vocals come pretty upfront on the second verse. In the original SIBLY Robert sounds more shy (on character), here he is singing infinitely more open (think Babe I'm gonna leave you: first verse - mumbles, second: talks, then wails). Robert incorporates lines from I can't quit you baby (baby youuu let me down so low..). He sounds more abrasive.   Immigrant song:  Bass drum sounds stingier (am I making up adjectives?). The viking wail does have an echo, but the rest of the vocals sound upfront (not as much as in Gallows Pole). Guitar sounds a bit further down in the mix.  Keys to the highway / Trouble in mind  WOW. Then seconds in and I've already heard brushes from Hats Off, Levee, even Townes Van Zandt style fingerpicking! People's been saying how Keys sound eerie: huh? Here's how a raw, stripped porch blues can sound spacey too. Ok, that was the intro. It quickly gets very traditional (that's good). Now only Plant and Page on the mic. Can you hear the sound of how awesomely sloppy Jimmy Page is? Makes you think it's you playing... Ha. Robert blasts the harp stretching the notes. This is a collage of different references in time and place put together as an homage to the blues. Not sure why people say it's in the style of Hats Off (which I adore) - only similar thing is the Leslie tremolo stuff on Robert's vocals and harp. I'll never get tired of saying I would've killed for a LZ record with all tracks Hats off / Keys to the highway style. For me, THIS ONE'S the highlight.  Now on with the Q&A. Cheers folks."
led_zeppelin,264rf5,smilingarmpits,7,Wed May 21 18:53:45 2014 UTC,"Also Jimmy just said during the Q&A that one of the unlabeled tapes he unearthed for the remasters contained Achilles. So... by the current logic: Presence companion disc, track 1 - ALS."
led_zeppelin,264s45,spoonracings2k,5,Wed May 21 16:55:27 2014 UTC,"You can't compare two songs on the basis of 10 seconds that sounds similar, especially when one of the songs is 3 minutes long and the other one is 8 minutes AND the guitar piece isn't anything new, Willie Nelson used it before both of them!

led_zeppelin,264s45,memebuster,3,Wed May 21 20:28:21 2014 UTC,"So what you're saying is that Jimmy Page never lifted someone else's material? You're seriously going to take that position? Because that's what you're going to have to do to defend this one.   From both an objective P.O.V. (go listen to Bert Jansch' arrangement of ""Down By Black Waterside"" and Page's ""Black Mountain Side"" and get back to us) and an historical legal standpoint - Zeppelin have settled in court with claimants on this issue - this is incorrect - hell, even Plant straight up admitted it. We already know Zeppelin were guilty of copyright infringement.    What is at issue here is intent.  I love Zeppelin and particularly love Page's guitar work, but he did in fact pinch other peoples' stuff. This doesn't mean he wasn't amongst the greatest rock songwriters ever - the majority of Zep's repertoire is completely original - but defending him against this is weak. He did it. End of story.  So the Delta Bluesmen including Robert Johnson sometimes used other peoples' material? Some music historians claim they did to a greater or lesser extent - but at that time the blues song was extremely formulaic - and all of this was long before any of them were recorded, ditto UK folk music. I don't see how that has any bearing on what Zeppelin were doing in the late 60s and early 70s with mass produced albums. It's not an excuse. They made millions and millions of dollars. Johnson et al were penniless.   (As an aside, Robert Johnson would face away from an audience when playing if there were other guitarists present to hide both his chord patterns, fingering style and probably guitar tuning - one of the many reasons why his songs are mysterious in structure and tuning to this very day - so even he was leery of people creatively ripping him off.)  As to this particular issue, the brevity of the similar passages is irrelevant. There are probably multiple hundreds of ways to play arpeggios in any sequence. These are too similar to get away with that claim. Page was clearly influenced by the start of the song and was playing around with it and one thing Led (heheh) to another. Yes, Stairway is the superior song. No, that doesn't make this practice OK.   It doesn't matter how short the sequence is, legally. It's about establishing intent. Can it be proved that Page intentionally lifted these sequences, or was it ""unintentional copyright infringement"" like Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord""? The court will look at the entirety of the evidence of Page's musical writing career to decide that, most probably, and frankly he has a history of doing it. There's no denying it.    In the early pressings, some Zep songs were marked ""trad"" meaning traditional arrangement. You won't find that on post lawsuit issues because it's bullshit. Jansch's arrangement wasn't the traditional one, for a start.   So we have a clear line of evidence establishing Page's prior habit of lifting other peoples' material. We have a clear connection between the two bands. We have the technical evidence from the songs. It's fairly conclusive if you are objective, he lifted the sequence.   Why wait this long to sue? Standard industry practice in case of plagiarism. You don't sue the plagiarist right after the material is first released, you wait as long as possible so the earned royalties will be as large as possible.   Not a very nice way of doing it, certainly something greedy lawyers thought up, but absolutely smart and a time honoured tactic in the music business with this sort of thing.   I don't know what the fuss is about, anyway, let 'em have the money, it's not like Zeppelin surviving members are hurting for coin. My position is that The Rain Song is a hundred times better than Stairway and it is completely 100% original, and has the benefit of not having been played to death over and over on rock radio for 30 years until we were all utterly sick of it."
led_zeppelin,264s45,CaerBannog,2,Thu May 22 12:05:20 2014 UTC,"I'm specifically defending this instance, he and plant obviously lifted plenty of material"
led_zeppelin,264s45,guitarelf,3,Thu May 22 12:56:29 2014 UTC,"the songs almost couldn't be MORE dissimilar   As you even stated, they are in the same key, have the same descending chromatic line, same rhythm, almost the same tempo - yes, Stairway is much longer and more epic, and way better composed - but that opening is undeniably similar. They could have changed the key and it still wouldn't be that different - I think it's clear that there was an influence there.   But, still - maybe it was a coincidence...EXCEPT that LZ went on tour with Spirit during their first visit to the U.S.  Now don't get me wrong - I am not here to troll. I love Led Zeppelin - Jimmy Page is the single most influential guitarist and 95% behind why I play the instrument today. I don't care if they didn't write a single song - they were still the most bad ass fucking band and could demonstrate that through their musicianship alone. I think suing over it is stupid, Zep clearly made a better song with the material.   Given all of this - there's a song by The Chocolate Watchband called ""And She's Lonely"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noxzn3RJjn4). Released BEFORE Taurus - and what do you know? Jimmy toured with this band while in the Yard Birds.  Listen at it about 3 minutes in...ironically The Chocolate Watch Band was a Yardbirds ripoff - so who knows? Good music is good, and when a great band like LZ gets their hands on it - it's only better"

It's obviously quite a substantial part lifted from Taurus. I'm not one of those people that particularly cares about ""borrowing"" parts from other songs. Anyone that listens to both versions of Dazed and Confused can hear the obviously copying. At the same time, Holmes wouldn't have been known to millions of people without that copying and the final DaC is really an incredible transformation. I'm thankful that LZ copied things, even blatantly, b/c I discovered so many great artists that had been stolen from like Bert Jansch, Davey Graham, Anne Briggs, etc. All of those artists should be thankful that LZ lifted their stuff b/c they got exposure over the years that you can't put a price on.

Surely they can afford to pass a few millions my way to prop up my pathetic retirement fund. I bet they wouldn't even miss it . . .

Did the band's song interest Page? More than likely. Did he copy/steal it from an intellectual or a legal standpoint? No, not at all.

led_zeppelin,25ocu1,ProdigalSheep,1 point,Mon May 19 23:53:37 2014 UTC,"They've had some infringement issues in the past, but those primarily span from their earliest titles (Dazed, Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, etc.) and this may have been due to:    Many blues beats being very similar, which would cause discrepancies early in their career when they were very blues-oriented. A tough time working out their sound and thus borrowing music both correctly and incorrectly from other artists.   Those songs weren't direct copies (they made many edits to lyrics, chords, tempo, etc.), but some did infringe on copyrights enough to get them in some hot water. Aside from the direct covers they legally did, Zeppelin didn't flat out copy any of their music, but did have trouble with how much they borrowed from other songs early on.  Nevertheless, Zeppelin got better with their songwriting after Zeppelin II, and aside from some correctly used covers, most of their music was pretty original. Stairway has a similar chord progression to Taurus, but not enough similarities in the actual note layout to constitute a copyright violation in most courts.  Edit: Words"

It seems that after Led Zeppelin didn't credit Dazed and Confused that everyone is trying to jump on the bandwagon and claim that they flat out stole all of their songs, when that truly isn't the case. Go through any other band's discography and you will find many songs which sound like or borrow riffs from earlier music. Even the Arctic Monkeys have released a song containing the riff from Black Sabbath's War Pigs. It's just Led Zeppelin's high profile that inspires people to become the giant slayer and try to discredit Zeppelin."
led_zeppelin,25ocu1,alli001,3,Fri May 16 13:08:02 2014 UTC,"Art is never created in a vacuum. And music especially is known for building on what's gone before. Ask any musician what their influences are and you'll get a whole list of inspiring acts and artists that they listened to and emulated.   Zeppelin's talent was taking a random sampling of blues classics (and some current music), distilling them down to their essence, and rebuilding them into powerhouse anthems. Hell, Rock & Roll itself was built on direct copies of underground blues and folk songs written by black musicians, which were ""cleaned up"" and presented to a much larger ""white"" audience.  I agree that Zep could've been better about giving credit to the original sources that they loosely based some of their songs on, but that just wasn't done back then. And their musicianship stands well above those originals. Which is why everybody knows Led Zeppelin and Stairway to Heaven, but almost nobody's heard of Spirit or Taurus . . ."

led_zeppelin,24ydz1,gypsiequeen,1 point,Wed May 7 16:16:21 2014 UTC,"I saw and met them actually.  I'll start off saying that Jason Bonham was one of the coolest, most chill ""celebrities"" I've met.  You'd never guess he is who he is, or who his father was.  No air about him at all.  All I had for him to sign was the Zeppelin shirt I was wearing (coincidentally, not on purpose haha).  His repsonse: ""Trust me, that is FAR from the weirdest thing I've ever signed.""  They were a great live show, and they even closed with Deep Purple's ""Burn.""  I was really into them, but then Joe Bonamassa was a huge dick to one of my friends (unforgivably rude, not just blowing them off for an autograph or something), so I really don't listen to anything with him anymore."
led_zeppelin,24ydz1,dauandr,0,Wed May 7 15:29:17 2014 UTC,"Can't fell any simpathy for him as well.   I went to the o2 at london, didn't even knew the band, but it was 5 minutes from my sister's house (somedays later, went to a Blind Guardian concert and it was great). I remembem thinking to myself 'boy, oh boy, they're fucking LZ 2.0!' Only after I recognised jason. Glenn is great too! Sadly, this is the best album - don't like 2 and the third one, afterglow, is a solid 7, while this is a 9 for me. They also made cover for No Quarter and Mistreated.   Bonamassa is the reason they split and everytime I read something about him I get glimpses of a very rude man. And I was hoping that they could keep going with another guitar player, but Bonamassa didn't allowed them to use the name.  Hughes and Bonhan now have california breed or something like this. Hope will be as good as Black Crountry Communion.   sorry for mistakes, not a native english."

led_zeppelin,245z8u,Backinthe70s,7,Mon Apr 28 05:41:57 2014 UTC,"I think people who bash Plant for not wanting to give it another go are just selfish. Yah, guys. We'd all LOVE TO SEE THEM. It ain't gonna happen. Just let what was be.  I think Plant realizes, he cannot do this like  the young guy he once was... yeah the guys can play their instruments almost as well as when they were younger, but for him, theyd have to lower half the songs to reach the notes, or he doesn't even try to hit his wails... because he cannot anymore. I think that is more heartbreaking to him then we know.  If i were him (i am a vocalist, who did a zepplein band stint for a good 4 years) i wouldn't want to go out there and do it again unless i could do it just as well as back in the day. And i really don't think he can --- I saw him 3 years ago with band of joy, they did like 5 zeppelin songs... every single one was lowered so he could sing it.  Your  voice changes a lot. especially at 65. Perhaps there are other reasons, like hes doing other projects, or he doesn't want to go back to that lifestyle... but you can't just say shit like 'robert doesn't have any interest in led zeppelin' seriously what the fuck do you know? you know nothing and you're just being selfish."
led_zeppelin,245z8u,gypsiequeen,3,Mon Apr 28 17:50:33 2014 UTC,Great post. Also Robert Plant seems like a guy who really lives in the moment.  And Led Zeppelin's moment (as great as it was) is gone.  I think more people should try to emulate this philosophy.
led_zeppelin,245z8u,bugaosuni,1 point,Tue Apr 29 05:32:03 2014 UTC,"The thing he did to his voice is astounding, he NEVER warmed his voice up, he just went straight on and did it, I'm pretty sure he drank a lot but the worst thing he did to his voice was to sing when he was sick, big parts of '73 and '75 tours was him singing while having the flu, it really killed the higher parts of his voice"
led_zeppelin,245z8u,AvkommaN,1 point,Tue Apr 29 13:00:36 2014 UTC,"i can relate to that. i used to do 3 hours zeppelin sets drinking beer..... later i realized i would have to just do tequila shots and drink TONS of water, and then i coud talk the next day. i did this for 3 years. can't imagine doing it that way for 20. yikes."

led_zeppelin,245z8u,bonsaiisuperstar,1 point,Tue Apr 29 09:16:07 2014 UTC,"When Robert Plant has no interest in Led Zeppelin, it breaks my heart. Yeah, I get you want to be known for stuff other than Zeppelin, but you can't ever deny that you were a part of the greatest thing to ever happen to rock and roll, and all of music for the most part. I grew up listening to Zeppelin on my dad's record player in the 90's. It's such a big part of my childhood, that I want the chance to at LEAST want to see Jimmy-Page at least once in my life. If I could see them together for a reunion tour I'd be so incredibly happy."
led_zeppelin,245z8u,strumzilla,1 point,Mon Apr 28 11:36:00 2014 UTC,"I've never been able to understand or reconcile Plant's reluctance, especially after seeing the entire reunion show on Blu Ray last year. They still sounded awesome, even though they weren't sounding the same as in their heyday. I understand being burned out on the music, but that should have worn off by the mid 80's.   The only thing I can think is that perhaps Plant doesn't feel the same ownership of the band as Jimmy, and maybe he doesn't derive the same satisfaction from playing that music as he does his solo work. I quit hoping for a reunion after the 3 or 4 false rumors after the reunion show in 2007."

I can't remember the other application, since he did most the mixing.  As for IMTOD, I see what you mean. We really wanted to use three different tracks to create something new, and tuning was an unfortunate obstacle we came across. Hopefully we'll deal better with it in future mixes.  In any case, thanks! It means a lot, and any criticism is appreciated--we really want to make more mixes with other great bands, and all opinions are a big help."

led_zeppelin,23tbpi,Hjhawley7,6,Thu Apr 24 02:48:09 2014 UTC,"Definitely this. Of all bands, Zeppelin is probably one of the hardest to get sick of, but you don't wanna try and take it in all at once. Listen to one album, and stick to it for maybe a few days, or even a week. Revisit it and decide what you like. Then move on to the next.   Rinse and repeat. You're guaranteed to love all of it eventually, with the possible exception of a few tracks from Presence."
led_zeppelin,23tbpi,PrestontheGreat,8,Thu Apr 24 05:55:26 2014 UTC,"Like previously stated, you can start with Led Zeppelin I.    I, however, was introduced to Zeppelin through the BBC Sessions.  If you like live recordings, it's a safe bet.  If you do check out the BBC Sessions, just tell me you don't feel the energy in the first few bars of You Shook Me.  That's exactly what pulled me in. A friend let me borrow that 2 disc set. I never gave it back. . ."

led_zeppelin,23tbpi,W1CKeD_SK1LLz,3,Thu Apr 24 02:47:26 2014 UTC,"I came to Led Zeppelin as a major Pink Floyd fan as well. Start with Led Zeppelin IV. It is a great starting place. It has enough variety yet enough familiarity to give you a strong footing on loving Led Zeppelin's music. From there, you can go where you please."
led_zeppelin,23tbpi,Hjhawley7,4,Thu Apr 24 01:18:29 2014 UTC,"Oh boy, this is exciting.  I was in the exact same boat as you, I'm a major Floyd fan and I got into Zeppelin shortly after.   Most bands I wouldn't necessarily recommend going chronologically, but Zeppelin is one of the few exceptions. Seriously, their first six albums are flawless and their last two are still pretty good. LZ I is great right from the get-go. If you're looking for a more progressive/experimental sound, maybe go for Physical Graffiti or Houses of the Holy first, but you should be fine either way.   Good luck, and welcome to the club!"
led_zeppelin,23tbpi,strumzilla,3,Thu Apr 24 05:52:45 2014 UTC,"Do yourself a favor and listen on a good stereo or with a good set of headphones (not earbuds) with no distractions. This music is meant to be absorbed, not playing in the background while you're doing five other things concurrently."

led_zeppelin,23tbpi,Laughing_Chipmunk,2,Thu Apr 24 16:14:16 2014 UTC,"Led Zep was all about the live performances and wanted listeners to get the full experience of Led Zeppelin by going to a show, or next best, listening to one of their albums (vinyl back in the day so you couldn't skip songs), hence why they never consented to releasing any singles. So i'd probably recommend watching their live dvd first The Song Remains The Same. That way you can get some visual character to the music, see the members in action, and then follow that up by going through their albums, at least going from Led Zeppelin 1-4. Happy listening!"
led_zeppelin,23tbpi,lifeisledzep,2,Fri Apr 25 02:56:58 2014 UTC,"I first got into Led Zep on their greatest hits album. I honestly don't even remember what CD it was because after 1 week of listening to their ""greatest hits"" I ended up downloading their entire collection. If you enjoy Pink Floyd I'd point you in the direction of their more mystical selections: When The Levee Breaks, Ten Years Gone, Going to California, In the Evening, Battle of Evermore, Ramble On...promise me one thing, sir, you make sure to get the Led out!"
led_zeppelin,23tbpi,tadpolejar,2,Mon Apr 28 01:50:21 2014 UTC,"start with LZ I and II, listen to those, next play disk 1 of the BBC Sessions, listen to LZ III and 4, play disk 2 of BBC Sessions. Play Houses Of the Holy, play How the West Was Won, watch The Song Remains the Same Movie, play Physical Graffiti, Presence and ITTOD, watch the Live DVD, cry when 1980 happened, listen to Coda.

They have a son, James Patrick Page III (born April 1988). Page later married Jimena GÃ³mez-Paratcha, whom he met in Brazil on the No Quarter tour.

led_zeppelin,23kyyl,HAMAWAY,2,Mon Apr 21 11:14:48 2014 UTC,"The black and white makes it very hard to tell which one it is. Basing it off of this picture though, I think it is indeed #2. It looks too dark around the pickup selector and the horn to be #1.  EDIT: Scratch that, I'm still not sure. The picture above is much later and they have faded, so it could still be a much younger #1 with the black and white making it look darker than it is."

I think this is just the lighting that makes it look darker than it is. The picture I linked is from much later and the guitars have faded quite a bit. Look at this pic of Jimmy in 1973 with #1. The burst around the edge is much more prominent and would look dark in a black and white photo. I'm still not sure, but I think it has to be #1 or #2."

Page literally has a habit of digging his pick into the strings of the guitar. His runs are often underscored by aggressive 'blkk' and 'pwkk' sounds because he physically jams his pick into the strings. It's hard to represent in onamotapoeia. On Celebration Day, right before Since I've Been Loving You at the start of the track, Page digs his pick in making an audible 'PWKK' sound before tearing out the intro notes. It's a pick scrape sound, but one created by sliding the pick in between two strings rather than scraping it down a single string.  So basically, take it literally."

While it is hard to argue that ""Train"" is the quintessential song that got the band rolling on their path to success (although I would challenge anyone to suggest a different opinion), can anyone else offer some titles of other songs written pre 1968 that Zeppelin managed to cover either in the studio, or live performances, that may not be of obvious suggestion? (like ""Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You,"" ""Dazed and Confused,"" or ""When the Levee Breaks"")  For instance, during the Sept 29, 1971 performance in Osaka, Japan, their ""Whole Lotta Love"" medley contains a very well transcribed and substantial sample of ""Twist and Shout."""

led_zeppelin,22m2wh,smilingarmpits,2,Thu Apr 10 11:29:34 2014 UTC,"Before they counted into Train, they didnt know if they would be a band by the end of the day.  Afterwords they were sure of it. It wasnt like ""oh that sounded pretty good, lets try another"". It was ""Holy fuck did that just happen?"" It was an epiphany. If it would have been another song, it is possible, even likely, the result would have been the same, but it wasnt, it was Train.   Secondly, before most people even knew what Led Zeppelin was, they opened their shows with Train. So their first audiences' experiance with the band was that song.   Train was what brought Zeppelin into their own world, along with their first audiences.   And yes im serious. Zeppelin covered alot of songs, in unique and refreshing ways.

Robert Plant has stated in an interview that it us supposed to be Apollo. Second it states that one of Jimmy Pages suits has serpents sewn into it, which is supposed to have satanic connotations because of the serpent that tricked Eve.

Led Zeppelin are offering the first unheard, unreleased songs for a very long time on an extra CD for a very cheap price. They're not even forcing them upon you, you can just buy the remastered album as a single CD if you like. The price of the remasters on Amazon has dropped and dropped.   Also, the plural of vinyl is vinyl. Not vinyls."
led_zeppelin,2155av,Cookie0024,-5,Sun Mar 23 15:29:53 2014 UTC,"Hmmm a sore point maybe. Calm down its only a piece of plastic and conversation their are more important things in life. My point being these guys are not short of cash, talent and creativity. They should get of their ass, put their egos to one side and produce something new instead of regurgitating classics. I think this is the 5th remastering and repackage release? I'm not complaining about them releasing studio mutterings, old live stuff, practice songs, studio mix 1,2,3,4, etc. They should have released this stuff free of charge on a download basis. In some way that would compensate for all remastering releases previously. Totally respect so called ""mega-fans"" but that badge should not be an excuse for multi-millionaires and record corporations ripping people off. Choice is good and I for one will not be buying them, but feel free to copy and pass them one please."
led_zeppelin,2155av,Cookie0024,6,Sun Mar 23 16:04:50 2014 UTC,"Not a sore point at all, but a valid criticism of the argument outlined in your blog post.   Saying that Led Zeppelin ""should"" make new music is really a non-point. It's not going to happen.   And no, Led Zeppelin will never release studio outtakes for free. Yes, it would be nice, but it's completely unrealistic.  People aren't being ripped off at all. The super deluxe box sets are the same music as the other releases, repackaged, with all the formats bundled together and a book of photos. That's not ripping people off, it's providing a premium bundle for die-hard fans. If the outtakes were only available in the super deluxe box sets, then sure, I'd be with you."
led_zeppelin,2155av,Cookie0024,-2,Sun Mar 23 16:36:26 2014 UTC,"And the lack of incentive to make new music will remain as long as people are prepared to repurchase old stuff. I do like the ideas though of books and duplicated memorabilia being made available. A few years back I bought the released box set of Perl Jam's Ten. It came with 3 LP's, 2 CDs, DVD, cassette, booklet, downloads and assorted stuff all for less than the Zep super deluxe sets. If they are going to do it then it needs to be done with more integrity."
led_zeppelin,2155av,Cookie0024,3,Sun Mar 23 16:51:52 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure it's that simple. The reason that Led Zeppelin aren't making new music isn't that people are still buying old music.   Jimmy and Robert aren't even speaking anymore. A lack of sales isn't going to rebuild their relationship. I don't doubt for a second that the fans want new music, and that Robert secretly does, but unfortunately I think the opportunity is long gone. The closest we came was 2007, sadly."

led_zeppelin,20q7ez,Jasonberg,8,Tue Mar 18 16:19:36 2014 UTC,"I sort of feel like people tend to ignore Presence and ITTOD when referring to classic Zeppelin. They put out six incredible (almost perfect) albums in a row, followed by two great albums that pale in comparison. It's almost not worth discussing. A bad comparison is Weezer, who released two classic albums in a row, then were just some mediocre rock band. When people say they love Weezer, 99% of the time they are referring to those two albums. Same goes for Eminem, and countless others."
led_zeppelin,20q7ez,wrgm0100,11,Tue Mar 18 18:15:24 2014 UTC,"OK, time for a massive left-turn here . . .  I just don't get all this ""such-and-such an album/song is perfect, and such-and-such an album/song is crap"" nonsense. Art is subjective by nature, and different people will have different reactions to any piece of art, including music. That bands/artists exist that can consistently put out works that appeal to millions of fans over several decades is pretty damn amazing, and is much more interesting than focusing on the one or two things that you subjectively don't like quite as much.  And it is subjective, after all. If it wasn't, then record companies and artists would have a very simple formula for instant hits (and you know damn well they've tried), and there'd be a lot fewer artists out there producing music and making all of the money.  Let's look at it another way. What's your job/career? Do you create or produce anything new, or just push papers/stereos/hamburgers around all day?  Is every day at work your absolute best work ever, or do you have good days and not-so-good days? Do you ever wish you could go back and redo a particular job because it just doesn't measure up to the grand body of your work? Or do you just let it slide, and move on to the next task which you hope to do at least competently?  And have you even stuck with the same career for a decade (or two or three) and still expect every work day to be better and more productive than the last? Are you even still working with the same four or five people that you started out with all those years ago? And have those relationships grown and changed and matured, or is it just the same as when you started out hungry and ready to rock the world?  Why is music any different?  Why do we expect every song/album form a particular artist to be excellent? Or, more relevant to this discussion, why do we insist of calling some pieces of their work ""crap"" just because they don't subjectively measure up to something else that artist has done?  Are we still approaching the passion that is music with a grade school mentality?  I wouldn't call anything Zep has put out ""crap"". Sure, I prefer some songs/albums over others (and even that can change depending on my current mood), but their entire body of work is so far above most of the pop drivel that's out there that I just don't think ""crap"" has any place in a discussion of their works.  If pushed on the subject, I'll say that Hats Off to Roy Harper is probably my least favorite Zep song. It's not a bad song, and I can appreciate what they were trying to do experimentally, but it just doesn't speak to me the way the rest of their work does. But it's still head-and-shoulders above so many of the artists that seem to get airplay these days that I just can't see labeling that song as ""crap"", much less an entire album.  So there's my two-pence worth . . ."
led_zeppelin,20q7ez,PraxisLD,4,Tue Mar 18 19:59:59 2014 UTC,"""Hats off..."" is zero experimental, it's an acoustic slide guitar blues.  Shit, I wish they recorded a full album in that style of tune..."
led_zeppelin,20q7ez,smilingarmpits,2,Wed Mar 19 12:44:17 2014 UTC,"I agree with you in many ways, and disagree in a few:  Zeppelin released eight albums in ten years. They were all pretty much game-changers. They are one of few bands that have had a consistently excellent body of work.   Record companies and producers DO have a very simple formula for instant hits, and there ARE very few artists who make all the money. Not saying that these people aren't talented or don't deserve what they get, but the way the industry works is very different from the 70's, when self produced artists were able to get multi-million dollar deals.  I have a degree in music, and work as a server/bartender. I don't play much music anymore, but I dabble so as not to ""lose it"". In my work - as little as may be possible - I try to be creative and to make each day better than the last. I generally rate a given night on how much I make in tips, but some days are just not as busy, or maybe I'm off my game for one reason or another. Either way, I'm trying to do my best, whether that is dropping the right joke at the right time, or inventing a new seasonal cocktail, I try not to fuck around.  I agree with you in this way: people shouldn't be judged based on their off days. The thing with Zeppelin is that they built up an expectation early on, maintained it for five or so years, and then stopped delivering in the same way.  As far as working with the same people for five years in a row and fostering/developing relationships, I'm a bit of a social nomad. When things start being less good, I move on and find new friends.  We expect everything to be increasingly excellent because of The Beatles. They set the tone for how pop music would work for the foreseeable future. As soon as someone comes up with something great, anything less is useless.  I would also not say that anything they did is bad. As far as I am personally concerned, The only other artists/bands that have had such a consistently excellent career are The Beatles, Radiohead, Tom Waits... maybe more, but that's enough for now. Even Pink Floyd, Joni Mitchell, or - as I posted above - Eminem or Weezer, who are some of my favourite artists, don't have anywhere near the consistency of Zeppelin et. al. Certainly better than most pop/rock music that has happened in the last fifty years.  I can't pick a least favourite Zeppelin song, It's just like trying to pick a favourite. As soon as I think of one song, I start thinking of all the others and get into a mental clusterfuck.   I enjoyed your post, just felt like discussing."

Same here.   The album is amazing. Tea For One gets me every time.

No keyboards, no acoustic guitars - no other stuff. You are right the first track may be one of the best but lets talk about it. Nobody's Fault But Mine is a radical interpretation of the old blues version. If you can name a better classic rock song by any other band I'll eat my hat. Lets talk about Tea For One .... a long slow blues in a minor key. Can you even name a another blues song in a minor key by any of the big bands ? There are a few - but I won't help you. How about For You Life ? Incredible work where Page uses the tremolo arm on his Stratocaster. It has a funky groove that won't quit.   If you are listening to this LP on earbuds ... or on a laptop speaker - well you will never experience the art properly. This LP was made for a REAL stereo system that basically have been abandoned for iPads and android phones.   But anyway - so you say it is the worst of the Led Zep LPs ? well one needs to be best and one has to be the worst. That is your opinion. I think Presence plays great from start to end. If you are into cocaine it is really good to listen to while doing rails. Or a long drive while smoking some green bud. It is made to be played LOUD- ok ?   Candy Store Rock has some of the most interesting drum work and guitar overdubs - and the some Hots On ... well the intricate work on that is unmatched in rock history. Page is the master. Find a band that can cover     ""Candy Store Rock"" and/or ""Hots on for Nowhere"" . I doubt you will find a band to even attempt it. Too complex.   I assume you must not be old enough to remember when the LP was released. So use google and pick a better LP released that year. Impossible"

led_zeppelin,20q7ez,j3434,1 point,Sun Mar 23 03:43:41 2014 UTC,"OK - but remember ( I'm sure you know ) art is art. I have a personal nostalgic connection with the LP as well. I remember driving long stretches on US highways - passing one car after the next - moving in and out - lane to lane as side two of my cassette blared away with the dissonant rock sounds of the un-radio friendly four lads. Remember ? Boston was making sanitized pop for the future - and Kiss and Rainbow were posing while the Lads had presence .  Side one you can just play loud through a good pair of stereo speakers - but side two get some good head phones. So you can hear when Bonzo does his bongos and Plant does his ""elvis thang"". But Page is always magical in virtuosity and original tones and riffs. The mix is astounding.    There was a time that I stood tall, In the eyes of other men  But by my own choice I left you woman, And now I can't get back again   How come twenty-four hours, sometimes slip into days?  A minute seems like a lifetime, Baby when I feel this way  A minute seems like a lifetime  When I feel this way...I feel this way   That is the blues . It was the brits who American Black delta and chicago blues back to the Americans ! How crazy is that. The only people who play blues with more love, passion and integrity are the black American blues masters ! On side two there is somthing lurking. Part cajun and part bad mojo - for certain. But it rock and roll washed with some heavy drugs - it all solidifies. Don't worry. They have some voodoo rhythems - they do. Them white boys just don't know.

led_zeppelin,20ll7g,TheNeatoBurrito,13,Mon Mar 17 02:15:30 2014 UTC,"There's a couple reasons.  The obvious one would be that it was very experimental.  There was much less guitar presence and Jonesy's keys and synths took a more significant place in the mix.  Another reason is that ITTOD was made when the band was at their worst.  Page was heavily addicted to heroin at the time, and the alcoholism that would kill Bonzo was at its peak.  Those two have almost no writing credits on the album, with most of the writing falling to Jonesy.  Plant did some writing as well, but his vocals weren't as strong as they were on previous albums.  Most of the recording was done sporadically, with very few instances of the band all being present at the same time.  tl;dr: some people think it doesn't sound like ""real""Zeppelin, others acknowledge that it was a very bad time in Zep's history.

led_zeppelin,20ll7g,SicTim,3,Mon Mar 17 08:56:08 2014 UTC,"For fans like me, almost all Led Zeppelin is great music -- but only some Led Zeppelin is great Led Zeppelin.  Generally, the less popular albums were/are III, Presence and ITTOD, from most to least. But all of them have at least a couple classics on them, and Houses of the Holy and especially Presence have been pretty much redeemed from when they were released. (HOTH was unpopular with lots of folks who were primarily hard rock fans. Same for ITTOD and it's big hit D'yer Mak'er)  ITTOD also suffered from the idea that posthumous or last releases from a band generally aren't up to snuff. From Let It Be to all the albums cobbled together from unreleased tapes, this is so often the case that it's a hard perception to overcome. And in my opinion, it's also true in this case. But, y'know, that's just a matter of musical taste, and musical taste is personal and shouldn't be influenced by what some guy on the Internet or anybody else says."

And III, surprisingly, is my second favorite Zeppelin album. Physical Graffiti, LZ III, LZ IV, LZ I/II, ITTOD, Houses of the Holy, Presence, and Coda, in that order."
led_zeppelin,20ll7g,SicTim,2,Mon Mar 17 15:58:35 2014 UTC,"Totally with you on Physical Graffiti, an almost perfect double album with what I consider only one clunker: Down By The Seaside. It's my second favorite, and still the LZ album I listen to the most.  Oddly enough, my favorite is Houses of the Holy, but I'm also a huge funk fan, and a lot of it is pretty damn funky. (I mean, The Crunge is a totally awesome tribute to James Brown's Sex Machine.)"

led_zeppelin,20ll7g,accelebrate,1 point,Fri Mar 21 16:34:43 2014 UTC,"I am really surprised to hear you don't like Down By the Seaside. I feel it is one of Zep's more groovy songs from that album. I like the rest of the album very much, but this is one of my top Zep songs overall.   While I wouldn't declare Zep to be a guitar-centric band, I feel this is one of their more groovy, overall band pieces. A lot of their songs I feel come together as a musical symphony, and the majority are such with a guitar lead, as opposed to just a ""song"", and Down By the Seaside is something I see as a good example. The rhythm section is pretty simple, and JPJ and Bonzo create a good, relaxed yet full backing section. Plant offers good vocals that aren't stressed and high, like a lot of his vocals, and Page offers good color with his guitar to a nice solid rhythm section. Keep in mind when I say ""stressed and high"" I don't mean that Plant was bad by any means. Just with this song, the lyrics are just as relaxed and comfortable as the bass and drums. There's nothing exceedingly difficult in any part, but all parts come together to make a complex song that just has a good feel to it. I think this is a valid contribution to one of their greatest albums."

It isn't even really my kind of style, but its such a fun song for me. People have their reasons like it being a bad time for the band, The synth taking more of a lead over guitar and whatnot.

led_zeppelin,20joxj,bradradio,4,Sun Mar 16 19:15:51 2014 UTC,"Anyone know the venue they played?   January 18, 1975 Bloomington, MN US Met Center Setlist:  includes: Rock and Roll, Sick Again, Over the Hills & Far Away, When the Levee Breaks, The Song Remains the Same, Rain Song, Kashmir, No Quarter, Trampled Underfoot, Moby Dick, Stairway to Heaven, Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog.  Newspaper review: Led Zeppelin descended upon Minneapolis this past weekend and proved to a jam-packed crowd of more than 20,000 devotees that it is still the world's premiere heavy-metal rock and roll band.  The concert, which kicked off the band's 1975 North American tour in fine fashion, marked Led Zeppelin's first appearance on this side of the Atlantic Ocean in almost 18 months. Few groups are capable of approaching the energy level that Jimmy Page and company maintained from start to finish during the Zep's 2 1/2-hour performance. Still intact after almost seven years together as a tight, cohesive musical unit, Led Zeppelin has evolved from its beginnings as a heavy blues outfit, which specialized in long meandering hams into a sophisticated professional high energy rock band, capable of selling out one 50,000-seat football stadium after another all by itself, without the benefit of a warm-up act.  The group appeared onstage almost precisely at its scheduled 8 p.m. starting time to a thunderous roar from the crowd and broke right into Rock and Roll, led by Jimmy Page's hard, slashing guitar lines. With the exception of Moby Dick, the band's standard showcase for drummer John Bonham, and a brief, 30-second excerpt from Whole Lotta Love during the encore, the group confined its attention to its most recent albums, Led Zeppelin 4 and Houses Of The Holy, along with a number of selections from its coming Physical Grafitti LP. The new material was a particular highlight, most notably Kashmir, an ominously moody number featuring some intrigiung synthesizer work from John Paul Jones and Trampled Underfoot, a surging rocker whose title is most self-explanitory. A tremendous A tremendous version of Stairway To Heaven, sparked by Robert Plant's emotion-charged vocals, elicited the most enthusiastic reception of the evening.  It was the group's dynamic stage presence which impressed me above all else. These guys are totally in charge of the situation at all times, with Plant's rousing vocal histrionics and lanky, blond-maned frame (extremely sexy, according to most of the young ladies I spoke with before and after the show) commanding the attention of all. Page has developed into an energetic, exciting performer, prancing about and exchanging knowing smiles with Plant while he tosses out a succession of stupendous solos, each more incredible than the one before.  Other goodies for the evening included overwhelmingly powerful arrangements of When The Levee Breaks and The Song Remains The Same, which, along with the Physical Graffiti material were being performed for the first time, according to Plant. Near the end, Plant apologized to the crowd for the band being ""rusty."" He needn't have bothered â if Led Zeppelin was operating at only half-speed, I would be hard-pressed to imagine how sensational this band would be on a good night!  During its long tenure at the top of the heavy-metal rock pile, Led Zeppelin has met and defeated the challenges of untold numbers of pretenders to its throne, and if this past Saturday's performance is any indication of what's to come, I seriously doubt whether a band exists capable of equalling, much less surpassing, what Led Zeppelin could do in its sleep. The group's superb sound system and colorful lighting effects, which bathed the performers in a Avide variety of intense colors; added considerably to the over-all effect. In this highly inflationary age, Led Zeppelin gives its fans their money's worth and then more. Five years ago I willingly paid $10 for an 18th row ticket to the group's show in the same Bloomington Sports Centre (1970), the home of the Minnesota North Stars hockey club, yet this past week my 11th row seat cost just $8.50, a paltry sum for what this group delivers.  I would have liked to see the group play longer, and I doubt if there were more than a handful of people who would have left the building if the group played 15 encores into the small hours of the morning. - Free Press, Jan. 23, 1975.

The guitar playing is specifically lacking any sort of way to know if it's page or not, there are no solos and it's not really in any of the styles Page is known for, like modal eastern tunings.

led_zeppelin,1zgk21,numbahnine,1 point,Mon Mar 3 21:17:59 2014 UTC,"That, and another factor is that the recording space has a big impact on the sound of the tracks. And of course when your space is Madison Square Garden, that's going to help."

Some of the songs I prefer in studio form such as Misty Mountain Hop or (if we're talking the digital version too) Over the Hills and Far Away, but I think No Quarter and The Ocean are much better live to the point where I don't even hardly enjoy the studio versions very much."

The album may not be the greatest example of Zep live, but the release with the 3 shows mixed up did come out with a great listen IMO. It does shade a bit on the more voice demanding songs... OTHAFA, Rock and Roll, Black Dog  No Quarter is out of this world. Stairway solo anyone? SIBLY is rather good too, even o Plant side for 1973."

Someone gave me the idea of using Moby Dick as a transition - I listened to it, it may work, that's what I'm looking for. We can parse the song however we want to fit our set. I don't know the full Led Zeppelin song book and I figured some people here would. I'm just looking for songs where Jimmy Page is not playing either a part or a whole song, if those even exist."

led_zeppelin,1xgo8h,Laughing_Chipmunk,16,Mon Feb 10 03:57:53 2014 UTC,"I'm sure there are other factors, but the part that made me see he was serious was about his son's death. He was away on tour and basically blamed himself and Zeppelin for it. Shit was going downhill for them all personally due to drugs etc, and it seemed like a really dark time, add to that his son's death which he blamed on Zeppelin as an entity (including himself) and I can see why he would wash his hands of the whole thing"

He just doesn't want to kill Jason."

It'll be a great time. Just make sure you STAY HYDRATED AND BRING SHADE. Don't know how many people I have seen pass out at jazz fest because they drink too much beer and not enough water. So have at least one bottle of water for every two beers. When I say bring shade I don't care if you have to bring an umbrella and be ""that guy"" with an umbrella for shade.

led_zeppelin,1xgo8h,Pharl,1 point,Wed Mar 5 05:24:43 2014 UTC,"You know, I could speculate on why or why not Zeppelin should do a reunion, new album final tour, etc....but plenty of people have done that. I will say this. I have the O2 arena concert on DVD and have listened to it several times. I want to bring up Plant's voice and Jason Bonham as the replacement for his dad.  First of all, from what I saw from the O2 concert, Plant does not have the voice anymore. I don't mean that to be derogatory; the guy is nearly 40 years older than when he recorded with Zeppelin. A lifetime of stressing the vocal cords as a singer is bound to do that to you. Would I be upset if they (and he, Plant) tried? Fuck no. I'd love that shit. But, that brings me to Jason Bonham.  I will never disrespect the guy for being the son of one of the best drummers ever. He has a bloodline that I can not even begin to trump, nor anyone else. Simply having the last name Bonham makes him a proverbial badass. That being said, I was sorely disappointed with his O2 performance. I have never sought out, or heard, any of his personal work, but I can tell you, from the O2 concert, that he is in no way the caliber of drummer his dad was. I couldn't tell you which song it started with, but, about halfway through that concert, you could tell that Jason got tired. He was playing songs his dad played with 4 times the footwork in them, and Jason was not able to continue to keep up. I don't mean to say he is incapable, but, as a drummer, you could tell he did not have the stamina (or possibly, less likely so, the skill) to keep up with what his dad played.   That being said, I can never take the ""current status of Led Zeppelin"" to include Jason Bonham. I respect him for being the son of Bonzo. I respect the fact that, in all regards, he is the rightful heir to his dad's place. Besides that, I feel he is not a viable option for Zeppelin if they decided to do a reunion tour. Side note, I feel a new album would be a slap in the face to the great, late Bonzo, and I personally feel that the band would not do that, especially considering their decision in the 80's to not continue without him.   Now, who should replace him? I don't know enough drummers from his death to the current time to really give an accurate opinion, but I honestly feel Dave Grohl would be the reasonable choice for many reasons which numerous people have said for the past 10 years. I won't get in to that topic, because I feel that is a different thread all together."

I was surprised they played Good Times Bad Times in the reunion show...they had a similar feeling on that tune as well.

That solo guitar break just wouldn't pass muster on pop radio ... top 40 , what not. But on FM radio in the 70's - it was great deep track. So they were played together over and over. Nobody wanted to hear just LLM as tradition. Well - I'm sure LZ never recorded a bad song - period.   Who listens to the Beatles Her Majesty without listening to the preceding medley ?
