In that case you're simply an asshole and / or a troll.     Meh. Let me guess, if I oppose Obama I am racist with that too.   Depends upon the reason that you oppose Obama.

We were such edgy goth kids."

Wally is the thirteen-year-old son of archetypal 50s suburban parents, Ward and June Cleaver and the older brother of the seven-year-old (""almost eight"") title character, Theodore ""Beaver"" Cleaver. The characters grew older along with the actors.  Wally is portrayed in the series by Tony Dow. Dow portrays an adult Wally Cleaver in both the reunion telemovie, Still the Beaver (1983), and, in the sequel series The New Leave It to Beaver (1985‚Äì1989). Child actor Paul Sullivan, however, portrays the character in the series pilot, ""It's a Small World"" which aired in April 1957. In the 1997 film adaptation of the original series, Leave It to Beaver, Wally is portrayed by Erik von Detten.  Leave it to Beaver was created by writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher who found inspiration among their own children for plot lines and dialogue. Wally is based on Connelly's son, Jay.

ghettoglamourshots,38jact,SuperDad_dadadadaaa,-2,Fri Jun 5 10:46:55 2015 UTC,The original purpose of this sub is not even to mock lower class people. It's just mocking people with poor tastes in fashion resulting in more nakedness than appropriate or doing things that aren't socially acceptable like someone snapping a selfie of themselves driving with alcohol in the car. Do lower class people appear on this sub? Yes. It is more likely for a poor family to not have high powered jobs that would prevent them from the sharing with the world their love of cheap beer and Confederate flags adorning their dirty house. But would you have called those people ghetto? Probably not since you just tied poor to a race thing.
ghettoglamourshots,38jact,spearchuckin,3,Fri Jun 5 13:10:16 2015 UTC,"The original purpose of this sub   What this sub started out as is irrelevant to what it is now, though.  and I'm talking about what it is now and what I described is not far off.  Regardless, you're making fun of people who are less-fortunate than you are- whether that is shown through ""poor taste"" (you should really think about that phrase for a second, btw) in fashion or in home decor, you're still making fun of their life situation.  Whether you admit this and/or feel good or bad about that is on you.   But would you have called those people ghetto?   Yes.  Because its such a broad term these days.     you just tied poor to a race thing.   I actually did not.  I definitely separated the two as examples of things people are comfortable with laughing at and what is not socially acceptable.  Both things are wrong and my only point was people should not have an issue with someone being racist if they themselves are making fun of poor people."

Purposely constructing faux African-American vernacular sentences as titles and posting in a sub called ""trashy"" implies that the OP is calling AAVE (an essential element of African-American heritage) trash. That's different from just trying to be ""entertaining and funny."" That's just being racist. Especially when the picture of interest isn't even trashy to begin with.

To inset a 3.25"" x 4.25"" photograph cameo in a headstone could easily cost a family about $200 (without the cost of the picture) alone, I don't even want to know how much a rim would cost.

Wouldn't she have a pretty good idea of the correct shade of makeup to match her skin, regardless of how it looks in the current lighting condition?"
ghettoglamourshots,357i69,square965,23,Thu May 7 19:59:26 2015 UTC,"You would be absolutely amazed (and perhaps horrified) at how different makeup will look under different lights.  I don't even try to pick out my own shades anymore.  This is one of the few things I'll suck it up and go to the pros for.   To me, this looks like she was under some warm lights, and got super carried away with the bronzer. She has no idea she looks like a train wreck."
ghettoglamourshots,357i69,Gigglemonkey,8,Thu May 7 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, well that really shows my ignorance. So it's not as simple as picking a color that works and using that all the time, you have to actively mix different makeups to match your skin tone each time you apply?"
ghettoglamourshots,357i69,square965,18,Thu May 7 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"Sort of. You can have a basic look, and know how the stuff matches your skin. There's also a product called bronzer, which is generally used to contour your face, and generally give a light ""healthy glow"" not unlike a tan.   I don't use it, but I'm willing to bet that under very yellow incandescent lights, you can't really see subtle differences in skin tone. She probably kept applying the stuff till she noticed the desired results. Sadly, under natural or fluorescent light, she should have stopped about half a pound ago.   I think this is more akin to making fun of that one girl in high school who doesn't know that there's period blood on her white jeans. Mean, and ultimately not helpful."
ghettoglamourshots,357i69,Gigglemonkey,3,Thu May 7 20:46:52 2015 UTC,"I wear makeup religiously. I'm super pale and slightly pink. Not only is it difficult to find a shade that matches my skin, but since I burn so easily, I wear sunscreen. Some of my sunscreen products actually oxidize my foundation or tinted moisturizer. If I'm trying a new combination, not only do I have to sit directly next to an open window AND a cfl bulb, but I have to wait before leaving to make sure the colors haven't changed. Luckily, it's pretty dark where I work now, so it's not likely that I'll be super embarrassed, but still."
ghettoglamourshots,357i69,UnKamenRider,1 point,Fri May 8 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"I only apply makeup in natural lighting if at all possible. I put ""daylight"" bulbs in my bathroom that are closer to the real thing. Even so, it is really easy to over-do any contouring. Using a flash in a dark club didn't help matters."
ghettoglamourshots,357i69,spazzycakes,8,Fri May 8 06:38:16 2015 UTC,Matching foundation to your skin tone is hard for some people. There's so many shade with different undertones. Some foundations oxidize (turn orange or darker) once it's set.

ghettoglamourshots,333rmx,mojayokok,3,Sun Apr 19 08:46:20 2015 UTC,"Listen up, Men. Here is a good idea example of the difference between bad makeup and a lot of makeup. Men make the mistake of saying they don't like makeup, when they don't like bad makeup. She is trying for a certain look, but has everything all wrong. Her biggest issue is that she is using the wrong color makeup (or using spray tan) for her skin tone which makes it very noticeable. She is then compounding the problem with cheap cosmetics poorly applied. You cannot overcome this problem without more money, time and teaching.  So if your woman has this issue, (maybe not this severe), get her a trip to Ulta or Sephora and a $200 gift certificate. Suggest she have some color matching done while there. Then help her throw out her cheap drugstore makeup. Some nice gifts you can give are the Anastasia brow kit (comes in either blond or brunette so easy choice), any of the Urban Decay Naked products (would really help her eye makeup problems) or Smashbox line of goods. Yeah, good basic cosmetics START at $200.  This woman just needs good products and some time to learn she is clearly interested in cosmetics, but she doesn't apply them correctly."
ghettoglamourshots,333rmx,Thinks_Like_A_Man,15,Mon Apr 20 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"Man here, I highly doubt my lady would take makeup advice from me.  ""But baby, baby, it came from reddit""."
ghettoglamourshots,333rmx,mojayokok,7,Mon Apr 20 03:15:10 2015 UTC,"You don't need to pay $200 in order for your face not to look like it has bad makeup caked on, that's just seriously retarded, & if you're a female then you should know that. It's all about knowing how to put makeup on. Just because you spend an absurd amount on makeup doesn't mean it's going to magically look that much better. As a professional makeup artist I know you can go to CVS if you want to buy your makeup there if necessary & if you know what you're doing you'll look great.  Don't waste your money unnecessarily just because someone on Reddit told you that's what you have to do to look good."
ghettoglamourshots,333rmx,isodore,-2,Sun Apr 19 14:32:25 2015 UTC,"Why would you assume someone on Reddit told me to do that?  You're not much of an artist if you don't there isn't a difference in quality between the CoverGirl line and something like Smashbox. The difference is noticeable the even if you apply both well.  I would sure like to see how YOU would outfit someone with moisturizor, primer, foundation, blush, eye shadow, mascara, powder, liner, brow kit, lip gloss, plus the required brushes (or maybe your pro-feshunal advice is to smear it on with your paws) for a fraction of $200 at CVS. Do tell us what you feel you can get that is comparable to Urban Decay in the Lipsmacker line of cosmetics. We'll wait because surely there are just oodles.  Now I will have to question my makeup artist skills because she doesn't use Maybelline. In fact, I don't ever see any makeup professionals with the kind of shit you find at a drugstore. I am guessing because it takes so mmuch more skill to use expensive cosmetics, right?"
ghettoglamourshots,333rmx,inkdbish,4,Sun Apr 19 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"No no, you misunderstood, I'm not saying that someone on Reddit told YOU to do that ... I figured you were talking about your personal life experience with makeup, however people don't have $200 to throw away on makeup and your comment makes it sound like you must use a certain set of makeup brands, etc etc and, while I'm sure your personal makeup looks good, anyone who knows how to apply makeup can do the same magic with less expensive makeup.  I don't want some teenager looking at that and think that they have to waste their money on makeup when that's not the case.  Do you understand what I'm trying to convey?  There's a huge difference between what professionals use and what the 'everyday girl' uses.  It's expensive enough being a female with the clothes and shoes and all that, but they don't have to go into debt to that degree just on some makeup.  You can get Mary Kay (and no I don't sell Mary Kay, I'm not plugging it, just making a point) and do just fine.  If you use the more expensive brands and that's what you push then that's your business but it's not an absolute in order to look good.  Plus you can go on YouTube and get tutorials on how to find the proper tones and how to properly apply makeup.  Ladies sometimes get 'experts' to do their makeup when it's a special day but I don't want some teenager looking at this and thinking this is a must.  Now you can be a complete smartass about it if you wish as you were in your prior email, I will reply no further.  I'm sure you're good at what you do and that you know what you're talking about when it comes to those brands, however it's not mandatory by any stretch of the imagination to have certain brands to look good ... it's all about knowing how to apply it."

ghettoglamourshots,31v6ul,unclehowie420,-34,Wed Apr 8 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"It is common for some women to follow something they say with, ""giiirl,"" ""biiitch,"" or ""hoe."" While some of these are generally not recognized as friendly terms, they are used in a friendly way when women say them to each other in some contexts.  If you aren't familiar with this, I can't help you out. I can only tell you that I have heard countless women say something along the lines of, ""my legs lookin' great in them leggings, hoe."" If you're out of the loop, that's on you player.  I wasn't calling her a hoe. This girl uses ""hoe"" after a sentence. ""We partying at the club, hoe."" I know her personally. I was referencing that.  Yes, Elmo is red. I don't know what I was thinking. I feel silly for that, and I blame the weed. I seriously can't believe I made such an obvious mistake.  It isn't simply wearing blue lipstick that makes her look ""ghetto"" in my opinion. I would say she looks ghetto because of how flamboyant and loud the shade of blue is, how over-sized her sunglasses are, and the tattoo coming out from under her dress. I equate ghetto with the opposite of classy, and I think the loudness of the blue mixed with the tattoo makes her look very not-classy. I would call that non-classiness ""ghetto.""

You aren't being honest about what you assumed. You thought I was calling her a hoe when I wasn't. I admitted I should have said cookie monster. I addressed why simply wearing blue lipstick isn't why I consider her ghetto. Aside from Elmo being red, you were wrong on everything you assumed (that I was calling her a hoe and that wearing blue lipstick is what makes someone ghetto). Now you are claiming none of what I said is apparent in the picture when literally all of my reasoning is in the picture. Your response should have been, ""oh okay I understand now,"" but that would be admitting you were wrong with your initial comment.   See how I admitted how I was wrong by thinking Elmo was blue? Give it a try. It doesn't mean you're dumb or a failure at life. It just means you made a singular mistake."

Many more makeup companies are coming out with blue shades of lipstick, such as NYX, OCC, Jeffree Star, Kat Von D, etc. If you don't like it, don't wear it.

I'm sorry you are insecure and think this is a good look.
ghettoglamourshots,31v6ul,polkadotpoppy,4,Fri Apr 10 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"By better ways you mean your ways right? Because unless you are infringing on another persons rights or commiting a crime, there is no wrong way to express yourself. And I am pretty sure a lot of women would agree that just because you are wearing something doesn't mean you are asking for attention. Whatever happened to wearing something just because you LIKE IT?

Don't be a dick because someone expresses themselves in a way you don't like. Would you like it if someone put a photo on here of you, one you thought was a nice one? I wouldn't be either, and I bet this lady would not be happy about it either. I am upset because you seem to think that there is no way someone could wear something just because they like it, when in fact, other than weather and work uniforms, that is the only reason you should buy/wear anything in your closet/makeupbag/etc."

ghettoglamourshots,2yzhi6,Flint_Westwood,5,Sat Mar 14 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"I imagine that, if it's integrated into the hair (i.e. a weave) then she could just put a shower cap on to sustain the style. Plenty of people don't wash their hair every day because it can be quite damaging to hair, especially those with curly hair. Unless you're vigorously exercising every day, it's not difficult to keep your hair pretty clean for quite a number of days (even weeks).   A coworker of mine washes her hair about every other week. Her hair is thin and straight, the only noticeable difference is that it goes from being light-med blonde to a darker blonde/light brown due to the accumulation of oil on the strands. It's appearance is less nasty than it sounds and she never smells like dirty hair or anything."

ghettoglamourshots,2yzhi6,drunkaf,2,Sun Mar 15 01:02:58 2015 UTC,Most likely don't wash their hair for days. There are a lot of people who do that anyway because it's less damaging to their hair. And this looks like it would easily be fixed after a night of sleep.

ghettoglamourshots,2yhdld,motionmatrix,-7,Tue Mar 10 11:18:53 2015 UTC,"If they're taking a picture with his mother's shirt off, and he's grabbing her boobs, and he's not breastfeeding, I'd say that was sexual."
ghettoglamourshots,2yhdld,scnavi,15,Tue Mar 10 12:41:22 2015 UTC,"Just because you have a particular concept of breasts and see them in a sexual light, doesn't mean that everyone else does. There is nothing wrong with a mother being comfortable in her own skin and teaching her kids through example that their bodies are not just sexual objects.  If that was a shirtless guy holding the kid and he was doing the same, you wouldn't care would you?"
ghettoglamourshots,2yhdld,motionmatrix,-1,Tue Mar 10 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"Of course I wouldn't, but you could also use that in the sense it wouldn't be a big deal if you grabbed a mans peck vs. Grabbing a woman's breast.  Of course it's sexual.  You could also use this argument towards any naked person holding a child, it's not alright all the time, and especially not past a certain age.   I'm a mom of a two year old, and I would not allow him to do this, because along with teaching a child that a body isn't a sexual thing, you also have to teach them what society deems is appropriate and what isn't. For example, I'm teaching my son about privacy right now, he can not barge into a room while I'm changing, not because I am uncomfortable with him seeing my breasts, but because he can't do that to any old person.  People have boundaries and children should be taught to respect those boundaries.  In the same household, if he's playing with his winky in front of me or his father (because kids do this) I'm not telling him he can't do it, or that it's a bad thing, but that he should do it in private.   People feel how they feel, some people may view this as appropriate behavior, but I think many more will not see this as socially inappropriate.  And I'm personally worried what this child is being taught about respecting other people's bodies and boundaries."
ghettoglamourshots,2yhdld,scnavi,5,Tue Mar 10 18:49:28 2015 UTC,"It's only sexual if there was sexual intent. I have touched plenty of breasts in my life without it being sexual. Just because it's a boy touching breasts does not automatically mean it's sexual. A male doctor examining a woman and touching her breast as part of the examination is not sexual.   You may not be comfortable with the idea of nude people holding children, but that is cultural, there is nothing wrong with it. There are nudists colonies around the world. Your belief would make everyone in there a pedophile if there happens to be a child as part of the community.   Depending on where you stand on this planet, men hold hands and kiss on the lips, but its not homosexual in their particular cases, because it wasn't sexual to begin with.    My mom never had a problem with me touching her hair or face and also made it very clear to me that it was inappropriate to do so to others without permission. Just because he is touching her breasts in no way implies he will be unable to understand that he should not touch others.  I am sure you hold your child's hand and at no point worry that doing so is teaching him ""go and hold anyone's hand for no reason and/or without permission""."

ghettoglamourshots,2yfxpe,LadyManifesto,2,Mon Mar 9 16:36:12 2015 UTC,You're right. I'm talking about slang usage . I think the symbol has been around since the dark ages. Known as an octothorp(e?) if I'm not mistaken.

ghettoglamourshots,2wp61c,SourCreamWater,3,Sun Feb 22 03:02:31 2015 UTC,"Ahmed has Sanpaku eyes:    If the iris floats upward to reveal white at the bottom of a person‚Äôs eyes, the condition is sometimes called yin sanpaku. In less common instances, the iris sinks to the bottom of the eye, revealing the sclera at the top. This condition is referred to as yang sanpaku.  Many practitioners of alternative medicine believe that a person who demonstrates yin sanpaku eyes has a physical or mental illness causing the mind, body, and spirit to be out of balance. This belief is supported by the fact that many people who are gravely ill or suffering from substance abuse, depression, or other mental illness, have the whites of their eyes showing below the irises to varying degrees. There is also some medical evidence to support this theory. In particular, when a person is under excessive stress, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or suffering extreme exhaustion, the optic nerve often contracts, pulling the iris of the eye upward, thus revealing the white beneath."

ghettoglamourshots,2w9msf,brotadosalad,5,Wed Feb 18 02:28:31 2015 UTC,I'm confused. Someone took a pic from the visitors side of the glass. Why is that hard to understand?
ghettoglamourshots,2w9msf,Juneauite,6,Wed Feb 18 06:53:52 2015 UTC,"That they got that many people on the lock up side of the glass. Normally it's one prisoner, one visitor. With tight security how does your whole gang get a visit with who ever?"
ghettoglamourshots,2w9msf,fivefingerlid,6,Wed Feb 18 12:09:30 2015 UTC,"Like I said, security...when you visit, you have to leave everything at the front desk including your car keys. You also have to go through metal detectors so I'm curious how someone got a phone up there."
ghettoglamourshots,2w9msf,fivefingerlid,2,Wed Feb 18 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure if you hid a phone in the front of an infant's diaper, they do not require the baby go through metal detectors. All of the inmates in the picture just happened to be at visitation at the same time. It's a room holding 12 inmates. There is nothing to stop them from gathering behind the guy sitting down for a ""look at us, we're in jail and we're real thugs"" picture."

People are downvoting me like being a mother automatically means you get fat. No, eating too much and not exercising causes weight gain. There are plenty of fit mothers who aren't slobs just because they had a baby. Having a baby will affect your hormones, your pelvis, your breasts, and maybe your vagina through tearing. But it doesn't mean you will get fat and stay fat. If you're a mother who is fat, that's your fault for not exercising, not the pregnancy itself."

I mean it wasn't awful, but I definitely feel more feminine at 145 pounds. I have curves! I'm soft. I'm not fat, but I'm not bony either.  Are you on any medicines? I have fibro, RA, and anxiety. Starting a medicine regimen made me go from a steady 135-140 up to 165 pounds within 3 months! I am nursing my 3 week old, and had to go off all of my medicines when I found out I was pregnant. Going off the meds at the beginning of pregnancy, I shot RIGHT back down in weight! I didn't put back on until month until month 6! I went up at 181 by my due date, but here 3 weeks later I'm down to 147, and I KNOW it's because I'm not on my medicines!   I guarantee you I'll go back to the 160s once I start them again (in 6 months, doctor said I can't nurse while on them until she's 6 months the old). And ya know, I'd rather be a bit heavier and able to walk, than 145 and using a cane and struggling with holding the baby (I'm only 28 years old)!  If you aren't on medicines, have you tried keto? I'm not like a fanatic or going to preach it at you, but it's delicious and there's a subreddit for it :)   I'll bet you only think you look worse. I have a fuckton of old stretch marks from my first two pregnancies, but they've added a little. I'm very aware of them, especially in summer, but I think I probably see them way worse in my head than others do. Ugh sorry it's 530 am and I'm nursing this kid again and rambling lol I hope you find something that works for you and makes you feel beautiful again! And congrats on the baby!!"

ghettoglamourshots,2umqfc,ghostdrummer,2,Tue Feb 3 19:56:53 2015 UTC,That's right. You also don't need to purchase a gun to hold one. If most people barely pass a test to own a pistol (even when the guy at the gun shop you take it at feeds you some of the answers) then how good of an instructor are you for a buddy? That thought scares me when I think about how many guns there are and how many people treat them like toys.
ghettoglamourshots,2umqfc,McGuineaRI,1 point,Mon Feb 9 14:05:32 2015 UTC,I think it's a great idea that the buyer should have to show a card stating that they attended a gun safety course (like hunters safety before obtaining a hunters license) before buying a gun.

About 2 sisters and a snowman and some dude with a reindeer.

ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,loki1887,2,Sat Jan 24 01:27:07 2015 UTC,There are several other grammatical errors.
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,baconwaffl,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:16:10 2015 UTC,"Like what, sometimes is supposed to be one word and it's missing some punctuation. If that's what makes it ghetto then most reddit users must be."
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,loki1887,2,Sat Jan 24 02:18:56 2015 UTC,It's a lot more than one word.
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,loki1887,1 point,Sat Jan 24 03:28:28 2015 UTC,Sometimes should be one word and it's missing punctuation.  I guess most of reddit is ghetto too.
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,loki1887,2,Sat Jan 24 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"Have you ever heard someone say ""I was sleep""? Or ""he was sleep""? This is the same ghetto talk that is expressed in this picture. Can also be seen/heard for example when someone says ""I'm bless"". It's hard to explain, but you've heard/seen this bastardization of the English language before."
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,lll_1_lll,0,Sat Jan 24 00:47:41 2015 UTC,"Except that every other word is used correctly, makes instead of make, thats rather than that. With the exception of punctuation there's nothing there. No ""I be smilin"" or anything like it.  Considering that the rest if the sentence I sounds right, seems like this was just a typo. If this was a white girl this wouldn't even be a discussion."
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,HitlerWasASexyMofo,4,Sat Jan 24 01:07:32 2015 UTC,No way man. My best friend is dating a trashy white girl who uses that lingo. It's not even limited to black people. I bust his balls all the time about her Facebook status's.   Here she is:  http://i.imgur.com/iAseYgH.jpg  She talks like what I was trying to explain.
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,loki1887,-4,Sat Jan 24 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"What lingo? She missed one word, that was more than likely a typo on her phone. The only reason it got upvoted this high is because the sub has recently had a lot if crossover from /r/greatapes. This is a shit post."

ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,jamieinthenorthwest,0,Sat Jan 24 03:08:55 2015 UTC,The fuck are you going on about. There is literally nothing ghetto about this picture. No ridiculous pose. No rainbow weave. Normal clothes. Normal make-up. Just a girl taking a selfie with a corny inspirational quote and a typo. I bet you this girl is from the suburbs.
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,StoneColdStinkAustin,4,Sat Jan 24 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"If she lived anywhere near a suburb she would belong to a public school that would teach her that basic grammar.  For someone defending black people the way you do, you have an awfully racist expectation as to what people that live in 'ghettos' should look like."
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,TheStig30,-1,Sat Jan 24 03:24:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Because if this was a white woman, everyone would have just accepted that it's ghetto and laughed at her.  Even if the text wasn't there, they'd just clown her dirty mirror, weight and outfit and make some jokes about WalMart and whatever.  Every time a picture of a black woman gets posted in this sub, everyone runs to defend how it isn't ghetto.  Let there be a picture of a white chick or even a black man doing the same damn thing and everyone's ready to go in.  You're trying to protect black women from discrimination, RIGHTFULLY.  But some of you take it way too far to the extreme and behave as if there are no ghetto black women.  White or otherwise nonblack women are almost always trashed and it's just accepted that she's ghetto.  And just to clarify, this isn't just my skewed, ""angry, white man privilege"" point of view.  I'm not angry, white, or a man.  I'm just saying.  Y'all always do that on this sub unless the black woman in question is doing something so awful it's flat out indefensible.  It never fails that someone questions why it's ghetto.  I get that a lot of non-hood people come in this sub and even say stupid racist shit.  But there are at least a few of us who are from the hood who know ghetto when we see it, and aren't judging people based on race.  Some people are straight up familiar with this world and not just laughing from the outside in.    Did anyone question how this girl is ghetto?  She's just an unattractive white person in bad clothes, and if she were black, that would have been pointed out and everybody'd be saying that this is just ""pictures of black people."""
ghettoglamourshots,2tf3ub,cherrybomb921,0,Sat Jan 24 02:28:13 2015 UTC,"That girl in your pic is exactly what this sub is supposed to be. The wannabe tough pose, the terrible hat, the awful make-up. That's ghetto glamour shots 101.  The girl in OP is just a girl taking a selfie while smiling and a corny message. No ridiculous pose. No rainbow color weave. Normal clothes. Decent make up.   I would put money on that this girl lives in the suburbs."

It might be the culture where fast and ostentatious displays of cash (not wealth) are the norm.   I've a theory: all this ""bling"" and adherence to name brand clothing, love of the latest sneaker, slang, quick cash is a coping mechanism. It's a way to ""live in the now"" and shake the memory of an ugly past, either their own personal one or the wide and long hardship of being black in america. The smell of new sneakers obliterates the memory of mama only being able to afford cheap payless shoes, even after working two jobs. Wads of hundreds wipes out the memory of counting change to buy some fried shit from the ""chinee man."" The fat gold says I can afford anything but a decent dental plan and maybe college. Live bright now because my life value is cheap according to the mental ghetto I live in and apparently, society at large. It's really more sad than embarrassing. PS-I am black"

I just feel that an African American is probably the most qualified to pass judgement and I would like to hear it.
ghettoglamourshots,2rwbep,chonnes,-1,Sat Jan 10 03:51:37 2015 UTC,"If you think something is weird or fucked up, then it's weird or fucked up. Doesn't matter the color. Also, just say black."
ghettoglamourshots,2rwbep,FBISurveillanceVan69,2,Sun Jan 11 08:54:02 2015 UTC,"just say black.   I don't care about what some Cubans, Venezuelan, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, those from Panama, or what some French and Middle Easterns think. African Americans is more descriptive in referring to those that are black, American and of African descent.  Have you traveled very much?   it's weird or fucked up   Something to think about: There are cultures in the world that are absolutely disgusted that we take the bodies of our dead and place them in the ground where people and animals shit and piss and walk over. We take the bodies of things we are supposed to love and cover them up with dirt the way a cat covers its shit. We hide any remaining parts of them so we never have to see them again.   To us, doing this is perfectly normal. To them it's incredibly fucked up. I know you are going to always think you are right, but you are only always right in your own head."
ghettoglamourshots,2rwbep,chonnes,3,Sun Jan 11 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have. And I'm also black and prefer to be called that. You don't see Venezuelan-American, Panamanian-American, German-American, Australian-American, nor Iraq-American when it comes to race. I have no ties to Africa other than ancestry and color. We don't share the same cultures, views, or lifestyles. Many Africans even dislike ""African-Americans"" because we supposedly take everything for granted. I respect my ancestors for their struggle, but now I am a citizen of America and only America with my parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents being Americanized.   You said you're Hispanic and named many South American countries or America controlled islands. There's a good chance that you could be a descendant of African slaves also. Would that make them African-Cubans, African-Dominicans, or African-Brazilian if they have darker skin?  Our race is black. I don't see how that isn't descriptive enough for you."
ghettoglamourshots,2rwbep,FBISurveillanceVan69,-1,Sun Jan 11 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"Considering some of the research that has shown that calling someone ""black"" has a negative connotation by removing any sense of legacy because it describes only a skin color; AND since the U.S. government has used the term African American for 50 years in census data; I use the term African American to ensure the most neutral and respectful description.  FYI: I don't call people ""white"" either; I call them ""caucasian""."
ghettoglamourshots,2rwbep,chonnes,2,Sun Jan 11 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"I'm white and Caucasian isn't an accurate label for me. I, nor my ancestors are from the Southern Caucasus which are now Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. I'm white, simple as that.  Also, how do you know if the black person you are talking to or about isn't a black person from Jamaica or another country?  If you traveled to Europe and saw a black person, would you still call them an African American or would you call them an African European or exactly what?    I hate these stupid labels. I feel like they are equally racist as terms such as ""nigger"" because calling someone an African American is insinuating they are less American than a white person by putting a description of what type of American they are.  You are either American or not.  You are black, white, brown or whatever.  Why the hell would anyone find it offensive to be described by the color of skin they were born with?"

ghettoglamourshots,2rcc5r,Ducky_Mcgee,2,Mon Jan 5 06:02:23 2015 UTC,"When I think of ghetto I think of the pictures taken in hood night clubs, dance and strip. People in these pictures normally take them in front of ghetto backdrops you would see on old 90's rap albums. These people normally make poses, flash money, and wear trashy clothes. Picture looks hood. Girl in this post is a little big, but she is trying to show off her body for her man. If she was thinner, it would just be trashy. Lots of woman have tats, so that doesn't make it immediately ghetto. IMO the outfit just doesn't look right on her, so it's trashy that she is wearing it out in public. Picture is not hood, posing is only to look good for her man. Picture is more trashy than ghetto."

ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,emeaguiar,44,Sat Dec 27 18:52:55 2014 UTC,When people say females like that it just feels wrong. Like they aren't people anymore. Suddenly they're almost like animals.
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,flying_kittens_,21,Sat Dec 27 21:57:23 2014 UTC,"I literally just said the same thing on the x-post in /r/awfuleyebrows and they called me stupid.  I don't really have a point, I just thought it was an interesting coincidence."
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,FoxIzBeast,-43,Sun Dec 28 03:53:10 2014 UTC,"So, like when doctors refer to patients as male and female, are they both referring to them as if they are animals?  If not, why not?    When the World Health Organization refers to female genital mutilation, or people talk about female infanticide, again, are they referring to animals?"
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,HMG-CoAReductase,20,Sat Dec 27 22:05:56 2014 UTC,"you'll notice in both of those situations female is being used as descriptor. Female patient, female mutilation. As opposed to the more insulting ""females get jealous"".  WHO doesn't list stats for ""females who get mutilated"" they'll list stats like ""female victims under 18"". It might say ""Victims under 18 > Female"" but again that's still a descriptor of the heading.  A doctor would say ""I saw a female patient today with an edema"". No doctor would say ""I was examining this female when I got the call from the hospital with her results."""
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,wolfkin,-17,Sat Dec 27 23:07:23 2014 UTC,"Not really.  Age is the descriptor in the context of a medical setting.  So ""XX year old female"", not ""XX year old female patient"", the second would be redundant because you only make records of patients.   In the other instance, female genital mutilation is a compound noun.  And even if it's used redundantly, then you're objecting to it not being used as a compound noun.    And your example, while I agree it is offensive, it is because you're making broad generalizations about the group.  In other words, it's offensive for the same reason that saying ""all members of ethnic group Y do/like X""."
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,HMG-CoAReductase,10,Sat Dec 27 23:46:11 2014 UTC,"Age is the descriptor in the context of a medical setting. So ""XX year old female"", not ""XX year old female patient""   age is a more common descriptor yes, but we're not talking about common descriptors. We're talking about usage of the word female. In which case the former usage ""XX year old female"" which is more commonly used in a clinical setting during which the word patient is implied by previous statements like with the heading in my WHO example. Or written in which case patient is usually implied again by the formatting of the document (Patient Record: XXXX, XXXX)  Yes the example I used was offensive in part because of the broad generalizations. But the term itself ""females"" used as a noun to describe a person is in part offensive because it's often used in such a manner to make negative broad generalizations. But it's also dehumanizing. We have specific terms of female humans that are distinct from the terms we use for females of other species and by using 'females' we essentially dehumanize whatever person we're talking about. You cite that ""female genital mutilation"" is a compound noun but I'm not sure why that's relevant it's composed of an adjective + noun. Which is still the point I was making female in that case is an adjective describing the mutilation as much as ""genital"". It's not redundant as male genital mutilation is a concept. Often applied to circumcision but also to more brutal procedures that are less ambiguously mutilation.  ""Yo this club is packed with females homey"" - it's still offensive not because of the content of the sentence but because of the offensiveness of the term ""females"" applied to women.  Now some people don't mind the usage of the term ""females"". Personally I'm not often bothered by it provided it's not used as part of an insulting expression but I understand the plight of those who do find it bothersome. From this perspective you can't use females to apply to human women in casual conversation and not offend."
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,wolfkin,-6,Sun Dec 28 00:01:31 2014 UTC,"We have specific terms of female humans that are distinct from the terms we use for females of other species and by using 'females' we essentially dehumanize whatever person we're talking about.     We have several words to describe the same thing.  One of the definitions of female has always been a female human.  And if the use of female is dehumanizing in and of itself, to be consistent, you would have to object to it's use in any context, but you don't.  But then again this is /r/ghettoglamourshots so I don't really expect anyone to have well thought out positions.     t's still offensive not because of the content of the sentence but because of the offensiveness of the term ""females"" applied to women.     You're basically just saying it's offensive because it's offensive.  Referring to an individual or group of people as ""a black"" or ""blacks"" is offensive because it takes away their status as a human.  Female has always meant female person, there's nothing inherently dehumanizing about that.     From this perspective you can't use females to apply to human women in casual conversation and not offend.     That is an absurd and untenable proposition.  All it would take is for someone to say that they find it offensive to understand female as being dehumanizing, we've then come full circle and we can't use any word to describe anything."
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,HMG-CoAReductase,7,Sun Dec 28 15:26:11 2014 UTC,"Female, when used as a noun, does not inherently mean female human, it has never inherently meant female human. There's nothing human about the word 'female'. You can infer an implied context of humans (a more substantial but again flawed argument) but the word female does not mean female human.    And if the use of female is dehumanizing in and of itself, to be consistent, you would have to object to it's use in any context, but you don't.   No the point of my post was that using the word female as a subject instead of as a descriptor is dehumanizing in casual speech. I thought I made great pains to stress this point. And i stand by that. Any time females is being used as a subject for the sentence in conversation this is considered offensive. I never objected to the word female but the way it's used.  Also I did explain that part of the reason why many people find it offensive is because the usage of female is often paired with negative generalizations, and I'll also point out that it's unequally applied in this casual contexts.   All it would take is for someone to say that they find it offensive to understand female as being dehumanizing, we've then come full circle and we can't use any word to describe anything.   wait what? I'm not 100% sure what you're saying here. I think you're saying to say we can't use any word to describe anyone because that person can just say ""I find [WordA] offensive"" and that word is out and then another person can say ""i find [WordB] offensive"" until we've reached [WordA-Z] = offensive.  If that's what you're saying then again you're wrong because you miss the point that part of the reason [females] is offensive is because of the comparatively non-existant usage of the similar term [males]. Women do not object to the term [women]. They do not object to [ladies], or even in most cases [girls], and much of the time even [gals] is ok. There are many terms that have broad acceptance. [Females] is not one of them."
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,wolfkin,8,Sun Dec 28 16:08:45 2014 UTC,In both your examples you're using female/male as an adjective. We were talking about male/female as a noun
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,BhiQ,-3,Sun Dec 28 00:06:37 2014 UTC,"One of the definitions for the noun has always meant a male or female human being.  So, you're just objecting to understanding the words in the way they have always been understood?  I mean, it's an important distinction to make that calling someone ""a black"" or ""a gay"" is offensive because it denies their status as a person and those words have never been understood to refer to a person.  Here, though, female always has meant a person.  So it is in no way dehumanizing as the other example is."
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,HMG-CoAReductase,4,Sun Dec 28 15:55:40 2014 UTC,"It's not about what it has always meant , it's about how it's used today.   These days hardly anyone uses ""a male"" or ""a female"" outside of animal documentaries. The fact that it's almost exclusively used for animals makes it dehumanizing, even if it's technically correct."
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,BhiQ,21,Sun Dec 28 16:51:07 2014 UTC,"I don't mean when doctors say it.. It's when people casually say it, like ""look at those females"" or ""I met a female over the weekend"". It just sounds really odd to me."

ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,HMG-CoAReductase,13,Sat Dec 27 22:20:41 2014 UTC,"Because in a doctors office, police report, ect you aren't in a setting where things are personal in a way that you would be anywhere else.  On a police report you are just a number- a statistic and that's fine, it should be more formal. You wouldn't want to be known on a deeper level by the cop who gave you a ticket. So being classified as female doesn't seem out of place. They use the information for record keeping, which is formal. There are no underlying condescending tones on a report- its just purely factual.  You don't call out your buddies as ""hey, African-American non-Hispanic male!"" Even if that's what the Census Bureau has them checked off as, in a casual setting it would just be odd to do so and kind of offensive."
ghettoglamourshots,2qj3h8,flying_kittens_,-16,Sat Dec 27 22:36:53 2014 UTC,"Because in a doctors office, police report, ect you aren't in a setting where things are personal in a way that you would be anywhere else.     I don't think things could be any more personal than a doctor's office which on occasion involves the sticking of fingers into orifices others, generally, do not have access to.  Almost nothing gets more personal than that.    And even while I will agree with you that it sounds odd to us, there's nothing inherently offensive or dehumanizing about it.  There's no ""underlying condescending tones"", you're just making that up to feel offended about something nonsensical.  There isn't a historical context here with using female."

We passed KFC, Zaxby's, Bojangles, Church's, and Captain D's until I finally spied Popeyes. We pulled through the drive-thru and over the crackling speaker system inquired about gift cards.

Look at it this way; if there was a picture of a German and someone said ""I bet his name is [Insert really German ass name here],"" then it wouldn't matter if there were a double standard or not; it just wouldn't be very funny in general.

ghettoglamourshots,2pv3bg,autowikibot,5,Sun Dec 21 03:10:06 2014 UTC,"Elevenses:       In the British Isles, elevenses (pronunciation: /…®Ààl…õv…ônz…®z/) is a snack that is similar to afternoon tea, but eaten in the morning.  It is generally less savoury than brunch, and might consist of some cake or biscuits with a cup of coffee or tea. The name refers to the time of day that it is taken: around 11 am. In the Royal Australian Navy, elevenses is commonly called mornos. [citation needed]  During the first decades of the 19th century, in the United States, elevenses was a custom of a late-morning whiskey break.   In Sweden elevenses is a tradition mostly associated with elderly people. The Swedish word is ""elva-kaffe"" meaning ""eleven-coffee"". It is often served with some kind of biscuits but the main focus is on the coffee. [citation needed] In West Friesland country people had a similar meal called ""konkelstik"" (served at ""konkeltoid"", the proper time for ""konkelen"", a verb denoting ""making a visit"").    In some parts of Ireland, elevenses is taken as a break from work to share chocolate. Typically said chocolate is stored in a refrigerator to keep it cool.  In many Spanish-speaking cultures, such as Colombia, the term las onces (the elevens in Spanish) is used to describe a similar meal. Among Chileans it has shifted to later in the afternoon, more closely reflecting the pattern of British ""tea time"".

So we're on our third date we decided to go to the local haunted houses here in downtown Kansas City. So we're waiting in line, she turns to me and asks if she could put her wallet in my coat, I say sure so we tried my pockets in my coat and her wallet was just a little too big. Here I am thinking she has her phone or some make up in it. Nope she pulls out two wads of 20s probably the size of my fist and she's like ""here put these in your other pockets"".. Meanwhile the girl next to us sees what's going on and her eyes are HUGE, like O.O she goes "" oh you must be a waitress"" and I just shake my head no while saying yes. She probably had close to two grand on her. I ask her why she has so much money on her and her response was ""Oh I forgot to go to the bank after work last night"".

Portland used to be the PNW hub for many white supremacy groups, including the KKK. This didn't change until the late 1980s, and even today you run into some of them in the outer limits of the city and 'burbs.   Oregon in general has attracted many radical fringe groups that once organized mainly in Portland, and outside of Portland OR is hillbilly as fuck.   Even today, Portland is overwhelmingly white, and extremely segregated, with the majority of the black community still living in or around the previous redlining areas.  Portland has a reputation for being ""progressive,"" but that mainly pertains to environmentalism, and even then, the typical ""Portland"" stereotype only applies to like 60 blocks of the city in either direction."

Two Hispanic dudes with hoods and bandanas came in and forced everyone to the ground. They took 5-6 minutes to clear the drawers/vault and took off. FBI interviewed everyone for around 3 hours. The robbers were never caught and apparently hit another bank close by not too long ago.  Buddy said it was a surreal experience and that it wasn't clear they weren't going to shoot anyone.

ghettoglamourshots,2nn71s,FRONT_PAGE_QUALITY,6,Fri Nov 28 15:14:48 2014 UTC,Straight female.  She was my little sister's BFF. Her existence just offends me.

ghettoglamourshots,2nit2n,boobsmcgraw,26,Thu Nov 27 22:09:13 2014 UTC,I love how many people have no idea what boobs look like on a woman who isn't a 19 year old porn star with implants.  She looks like a normal woman with natural boobs who has had a baby.
ghettoglamourshots,2nit2n,CoruscantSunset,13,Thu Nov 27 12:57:14 2014 UTC,True. Bit weird to wear this type of dress tho.

I can honestly say that I would never want to have a beer with the guy.   At least Chris Angel sometimes does some interesting magic.

ghettoglamourshots,2n2elg,roque72,2,Sun Nov 23 04:56:33 2014 UTC,"The difference is most magicians create illusions, Criss Angel hires a fake audience who pretend to react to a trick that never really happened. He fakes the illusion altogether."

ghettoglamourshots,2mhobb,hazeyface,-1,Mon Nov 17 15:15:43 2014 UTC,"It's called holding gel.  It's gel that holds.  There's no need to reference ""tar"", that has a negative connotation."

I honestly wasn't aware that was anything negative...I was going to say glue, then black glue but thought THAT sounded bad so I said tar...because they are similar...I didn't realize any amount of gel could make hair look like that, ever.

ghettoglamourshots,2mhobb,hazeyface,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:20:44 2014 UTC,"Well, it is way too much gel that she used and that may have been what threw you off, so all good.

ghettoglamourshots,2mhobb,hazeyface,-1,Mon Nov 17 21:00:17 2014 UTC,"It's called a quick weave. It's when weave tracks are glued directly onto your hair or a stocking cap.  They wrap your hair using a ridiculous amount of ""black gel"". It is a protein styling gel referred to as black gel for the color. When placed under a dryer your hair will dry super hard into the wrap.  Then shitty stylist will glue tracks of hair to your wrapped hair, or less shitty stylist will place a stocking cap on your head and glue tracks to cap.  To avoid showing the tracks and because there is no hair to cover them. Tracks must be strategically placed around edges as to hide them from site. To keep the weave hair in place around the edges more black gel is added. Then you will either be placed under a dryer or have a hand dryer used to set the gelled pieces to rock hard. They may even use a holding spray after just to be sure.  The edges you see are not even hers which is why they look so perfectly unnatural.  It's really bad for your edges, even when done correctly. That's why you see a lot of black woman with smack bald edges. To me it usually looks unappealing not to mention looking like an early The Sims commercial."

ghettoglamourshots,2ly7zt,AmunRa666,19,Tue Nov 11 14:28:44 2014 UTC,"I honestly don't get what message the people in all the /r/ghettoglamourshots are trying to convey.   As far as I can tell there are basically 3 types of picture.   1) People who ""photoshop"" themselves into fucking weird images of lions, dogs, waterfalls etc.   2) People who hold up not very large amounts of paper money and somehow, I am assuming, think this makes them cool in some way? It must be that because it certainly doesn't make them look rich.   3) Complete tramps who make poor clothing choices and/or are fat.  Why do these people then decide to post the images on the internet? Are they expecting some kind of social acceptance from this? Are they hoping it will increase their social standing amongst the people who see it? Are they just fucking retarded and honestly have no idea that they look completely moronic and desperate?   Actually, I just realised I should feel sorry for these people. It's tragic really.   Fuck it, who am I kidding. Keep the pictures of the twats coming. It makes me feel better about myself."

ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,raboolaconundrum,18,Mon Nov 10 11:12:34 2014 UTC,Why are Irish-Americans always embarrassingly patriotic about a country their ancestors came from? My great-great-Grandmother and her family came from Isle of Man but I feel no allegiance to the Manx people nor do I feel I should have. I guess it's because I'm English though.
ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,harrythemay,17,Mon Nov 10 14:43:22 2014 UTC,"A lot of ""Italian Americans "" are the same, for some reason. I guess it's because they think it's boring to just call themselves ""American""."

ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,Omariamariaaa,4,Mon Nov 10 15:00:20 2014 UTC,You could always try some corned beef parmesan!
ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,GobiusIndustries,3,Mon Nov 10 15:25:33 2014 UTC,Corned Beef? Surely you mean boiled bacon.
ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,raboolaconundrum,1 point,Mon Nov 10 15:43:06 2014 UTC,"Well, honestly, in the USA I think it's because of the discrimination that Irish and other immigrants faced in the 19th and early 20th centuries from the ""Nativists""‚Äîthe earlier generations of European Americans who were incredibly racist and hostile to immigrants. In response to that, cultural pride is a normal defense mechanism. It stays with people from those backgrounds. The one notable exception being Americans of German descent, who largely ditched their cultural identities by WWII."
ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,heyaprofess,3,Fri Nov 21 19:09:18 2014 UTC,I wouldn't boast to anyone about being from the Isle of Man either.

Could be the Catholicism maybe? Im no fucking sociologist though, maybe they just like drinking a lot and it makes it more socially acceptable!"
ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,raboolaconundrum,9,Mon Nov 10 15:01:31 2014 UTC,"I think it's because the Irish, Italian and Mexican immigration waves are newer."
ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,Aboresh,8,Mon Nov 10 16:41:14 2014 UTC,I thought with Germans it might have something to do with people still being a bit uncomfortable with 'German pride'... I've thought it might be nice to have a bit of an ethnic cultural identity but it seems like that's not an option.  I'm just 'white'.
ghettoglamourshots,2ltru9,AndrewCarnage,3,Mon Nov 10 19:57:53 2014 UTC,"Never? Just walk around in NYC during the Steuben Parade.  And I've been told there was a lot more before the three WWs (World War I, World War II & Woodrow Wilson). Maybe without that, prohibition could've been prevented, as this took a drinking faction out of the game.  Not sure whether the relative size and, erm, ""diversity"" of Germany also plays a role. Bavarians and people from Hamburg would have some different traditions, just like the English and Scottish. You don't hear a lot about ""British-Americans""...  On the other hand, if you hand out beer by the liters, suddenly everyone's a Bavarian."

The term was originally used in the late 19th to mid 20th century.  It is one of a number of sexual preferences across age groups subsumed under the technical term chronophilia. Ephebophilia strictly denotes the preference for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners, not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction. Some authors define ephebophilia as a sexual preference for pubescent and adolescent boys.

Those skills are valuable to those companies.   And the people who do them are valuable and are not being given fair,compensation for their value and the profit they generate for those companies (who could not function without them)).   2). Because everyone who is working full time deserves to make enough money without gov help to afford necessities.   Those people do not have ""minimum work ethic""  its the opposite.  They work themselves day in and out and,still can not afford to live without help.   Its insulting to say these people dont work hard, while the big shots that run these corps I gurantee are not working shifts 7 days a week, wondering how theyll afford thanksgiving dinner.     3)  Because paying a living wage to their employees improves everything.  Their employees wont need,gov assistance, theyll have more,money,to,spend as consumers and,consumers are the job generators.  The huge disparity in wealth is insidious pure,greed and needs to be fixed.    4)  Find ways to be more,valuable?  Oh you mean like all those college grads who have no job/low skill part time job and a mountain of,student,debt?   Oh and,who are becoming more and more the work force at these companies because there are no jobs?    Also a good amount of people are not cut out for higher edu (which has become more of a scam to place huge debts on young people)  but you know what?  They still deserve to make a living wage for the work and,services they provide.     If you work, you deserve to be paid enough to be able to afford food, utilities, housing, healthcare, transportation."

Some people like bigger women, some people like tiny women, short women, tall women, black women, white women.  Just because their preference doesn't match yours, does not make their standards lowered.  (*straw man argument in case that whizzed by anyone)  EDIT: LOL from your post history I see you troll around and comment negatively about fat people a bunch. Grow up.

She was staying at a shitty motel  (http://north-american-inns.hotelp.info/) near where I work/live....got off work, called here up around 9am(I work in a data center over night).  I went there, she came down to meet me in the lobby, we went up the back stairs to her shitty hotel room she sucked my dick for about 10 mins, then I fucked her from the back for about 10 mins, then I let her ride...really I have had quite a few big girls ride before and I must say she was very flexible for such a big girl...keep in mind my wife is about 5"" 200 lbs all ass, built like the porn star pinky...but this girl was easily 325.  She seemed to genuinely enjoy fuckin and her pussy was extremely tight...she didn't use any lube and she let me finish on her back.  Funny thin was, she called me a few months later when she came back to philly and she fucked me for free that time."

ghettoglamourshots,2knh7f,hugepenis,-4,Wed Nov 12 03:44:00 2014 UTC,I am honestly curious how grotesque looking people like her get the delusional self confidence and belief that they are attractive. It is almost as if they have the complete opposite of body dysmorphic disorder where instead of seeing imaginary flaws in their appearance they see imaginary beauty and sexiness. This needs to be in the next DSM-VI
ghettoglamourshots,2knh7f,comawhite12,5,Wed Oct 29 12:23:08 2014 UTC,This isn't my sort of thing at all but it wouldn't be it's own massive porn genre of heaps of people weren't into it. Personally you couldn't pay me enough to touch the obese heart attack waiting to happen but someone is jerking it to her as we speak.
ghettoglamourshots,2knh7f,Jmersh,-7,Wed Oct 29 12:31:50 2014 UTC,"One possible hint may be our culture. Men will always have sex with fat and ugly chicks because hey, at least it's a chick and therefore deserves high-fives all around.   But if the guy gets one blowjob from Brad Pitt everyone they know, male and female from friends, family, work and church will revile them for suddenly being homosexual.

I do not believe that the white thing in the picture is indeed the girl's pad.  First of all, I would think that if a pad were to be displaced due to excessive hip thrusting and/or booty bouncing, that it would more likely migrate forward or to the side.  Also, the ""pad"" in the picture is too perfectly shaped.  If the pad moved during the twerking process, it would be all bunched up and twisted.  Furthermore, the ""pad"" appears nearly transparent and almost seems to fade at one end.   I believe that the ""pad"" in picture is a some kind of reflection or lens flare or some other photographic light anomaly."

These type of white girls for whatever reason get engulfed in urban/ghetto black culture around preteens and they almost worship these black dudes. To them, the black dudes validate their inner urban trash queen. The black dudes are actually the ones who are winning (ignoring the fact that they more than likely will live at home their entire life and don't know the meaning of a hard day's work and have several kids), but they are winning because they have 4-6 of these types of chics who are usually from decent households with parents who are too tolerant to ""ban"" them from interacting with these guys. The win comes in because the black dudes use these 4-6 different white chics for their money and sex. I used to hang out with these type of guys and when I tell you they live life like fucking rockstars, its almost enviable. They wake up, call one of these chics to drive them to the store (because they don't have car) and buy them breakfast and weed...they smoke and eat and promptly get their dick sucked all before 11AM. Then they continue that cycle with 2-3 different chics throughout the day..."

They could be the type of people that think that there's no such thing as bad publicity considering such a raunchy photo.

ghettoglamourshots,2fzbo9,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Sep 10 15:15:46 2014 UTC,"Gravitational lens:       A gravitational lens refers to a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant source (a background galaxy) and an observer, that is capable of bending (lensing) the light from the source, as it travels towards the observer. This effect is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.  Although Orest Chwolson (1924) or Frantisek Klin (1936) are sometimes credited as being the first ones to discuss the effect in print, the effect is more commonly associated with Einstein, who published a more famous article on the subject in 1936.  Fritz Zwicky posited in 1937 that the effect could allow galaxy clusters to act as gravitational lenses. It was not until 1979 that this effect was confirmed by observation of the so-called ""Twin QSO"" SBS 0957+561.

The club is likely in an industrial area or shit tastic strip mall, thinking cinderblock shithole near a dog food plant/slaughterhouse...

ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,FreudsMomsRage,161,Tue Aug 5 16:09:53 2014 UTC,"Absolutely. 18th Street gang members (and other similar cliques) force this on ""their"" women either as a slave mark for prostitution, as /u/10gags stated below, or as misguided proof of loyalty. They're one of the largest gangs in the country, and the extreme level of violence they routinely exhibit is a large reason why you see the LAPD and Sheriff getting more and more militarized every year. This woman has no chance at a life without abuse, and that baby has next to no chance to be anything other than another generation of brutal thug. It's incredibly sad.  edit: specified /u/10gags as the earlier commenter in case this gets shuffled around, since they're spot fucking on."
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,SayceGards,13,Tue Aug 5 16:54:00 2014 UTC,Oh. Now I'm sad.

ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,coldvault,16,Tue Aug 5 23:45:44 2014 UTC,Isn't it kind of fucked up that people care less when bad things happen to less-attractive people?
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,coherent_thought,28,Wed Aug 6 04:37:23 2014 UTC,"Only assholes, I suppose. I simply made an obvious observation. What's fucked up is that people can be so cynical and make broad based assumptions such as yours."
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,fedoraeuphoriaguy,14,Wed Aug 6 04:52:44 2014 UTC,"I don't know man, that statement isn't entirely false. Take the Madeline McCann case instance. This received huge media attention. She was a cute, blond haired, blue eyed kid from a nice middle class family. Around the same time there was another child abduction case in the UK which has since been solved. Shannon something, I forget the name sorry. This received significantly less coverage e she was from a very poor family and was much less aesthetically appealing. This was commented on by several prominent people as hypocrisy, which I completely agree with, but that just shows how prevalent this type of shallowness is."
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,coherent_thought,10,Wed Aug 6 14:19:32 2014 UTC,"Shannon something, I forget the name sorry.   Dude, are you for real?"

ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,yourgirlsbabydaddy11,14,Tue Aug 5 17:18:53 2014 UTC,Not to mention the fact that the gangs would probably continue to be involved in drugs and prostitution as part of their legitimate business.  The mob continued to be involved in the nightlife business after their speakeasies became legal.  Many of the top nightclubs were still mob owned decades after prohibition.
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,ChaosMotor,8,Tue Aug 5 17:23:31 2014 UTC,"But what if extortion, robbery, kidnapping, vehicle theft, underage human trafficking and fraud were legal? Then where would the gang get their income from?"

ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,buckforaduck,9,Thu Aug 14 02:33:36 2014 UTC,"That's a little like asking if taking away the garden center at Walmart would reduce their profitability. To some extent, sure, but there are countless other ways to fill the hole."

ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,senorworldwide,3,Tue Aug 5 21:54:58 2014 UTC,"So, first off, I'm not sure if you're being argumentative just to be argumentative, or if you're one of the ""everything should be legal"" people and are trying to prove a point, or if you have a genuine question.  Second, I don't accept your premise. How did you determine the potential risk and profit of each of these crimes? How do you know that drug trafficking has the least risk, highest profit, and most repeat business? I certainly don't have that information. The only answer I have for you is that life, uh, finds a way."
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,sputnikleroy,1 point,Tue Aug 5 22:22:51 2014 UTC,"How do you know that drug trafficking has the least risk, highest profit, and most repeat business?    How many ""repeat customers"" do you get for kidnapping, extortion, or any of the other things you listed? How many of the other criminal enterprises have people coming back every day, not just requesting but insisting to be serviced again and again and again?   If you're not familiar with the ease of entry for drugs & prostitution, the profitability, or the repeatability of the transactions, it's because you've chosen to be ignorant of that."
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,jvnk,3,Tue Aug 5 18:44:09 2014 UTC,"I don't think many people are voluntarily deciding whether they are repeat customers of 'any of the other things listed' such as robbery, gun running, vehicle theft, underage human trafficking etc...  Organized crime will always find a way and legalizing drugs and prostitution won't change that, even if that's the right thing to do."

Judging from the clickbait articles you see on this shit you'd think there are 11 yr old hookers on every streetcorner.

It's a hysteria, propagated by hysterics.

ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,coherent_thought,-14,Tue Aug 5 21:00:29 2014 UTC,"So why is that when a guy gets a tat to show his gang loyalty he's a fucking scumbag criminal asshole who needs to die, and when a woman does it she's a delicate flower being forced into it by evil gang overlords who obviously never ever let her out of thier sight so she won't run away?  This chick might be as down for her clique as her man or even more so.  No reason to think otherwise.  She's not a kidnapping victim."
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,BootyPapa,18,Wed Aug 6 00:15:47 2014 UTC,"So why is that when a guy gets a tat to show his gang loyalty he's a fucking scumbag criminal asshole who needs to die...   Men have much more power in Latino communities in general, and even more in gang culture specifically.  I will agree with your core sentiment that some men that get these tattoos are not really doing so because they want to, but because they have to due to their affiliation.  If you're a woman you are essentially property, so there is a difference and a quite large one at that.  Dissent is not tolerated very well in gangs (or any large group for that matter), so trying to stand up for yourself does not usually work out well."

I'm sorry if you forgot but it's not the same every where. I spent some time in a trama center. Working as an aide. The women from brutal relationships, with gang afflictions, came with tattoos to mark them. To own them.  A woman in a gang is still viewed as weak. As second class. As a woman in a male world. As something to own. And that's in America. Now let's look at South America. No offense to anyone on here from SA. Brazil is beautiful. But you can't tell me that they value women just as equally as we do. So why is it a stretch for the girl to be property? Because she is. Almost all women in gangs are property. Unless your gay and look like queen latifah. And even a gal like that could be faced with being raped or loaned out.

ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,BootyPapa,119,Tue Aug 5 17:25:42 2014 UTC,She's not a prostitute and that guy is not a pimp. They are simply gang members and her tattoo is a symbol of loyalty to that gang.
ghettoglamourshots,2cp1ic,BootyPapa,43,Tue Aug 5 18:13:52 2014 UTC,Most likely the 18th Street Gang. Known for tattooing the number on themselves.

ghettoglamourshots,2ag77t,Horsetoothedjackass,1 point,Sun Jul 13 09:12:21 2014 UTC,"Coat (animal):       Coat is the nature and quality of a mammal's pelage. It is important to the animal fancy in the judging of the animal, particularly at conformation dog shows, cat shows and horse shows. It may also be used as a standard to evaluate the quality of care and management used by the animal handler, such as in horse showmanship.  The pelage of a show animal may be divided into different types of hair, fur or wool with a texture ranging from downy to spiky. In addition, the animal may be single-coated or may have a number of coats, such as an undercoat and a topcoat (made up of guard hairs (also called an outer coat or, sometimes, overcoat). The state of the coat is considered an indication of the animal's breeding and health.  Animals might have different coat quality for different seasons. Normally, animals with fur or hair body coats may develop a thicker and/or longer winter coat in colder times of the year, which will shed out to a shorter, sleeker, summer coat as the days lengthen into spring and summer. This process may not occur in a noticeable fashion in climates that are warm year-round, though animals may nonetheless shed their coats periodically. The process may also be minimized by artificially keeping the animal blanketed, or, in the case of small animals, housed indoors.  Pinnipeds and polar bears have longer guard hairs forming the most visible fur;  polar bears' guard hairs are hollow.  Some considerations in judging the quality of an animal's coat:   Colour (coat colour other than those allowed in the breed standard results in disqualification) Markings (distribution of colour, spots, and patches; for example the spotted coat of a Dalmatian and the merle coat of an Australian Shepherd are distinctive; the markings of a terrier vary.) Pattern (specific, predictable markings; tabby, for example is a common pattern in cats) Texture of hair (smooth, rough, curly, straight, broken) Length of hair Health of hair coat (shiny or dull, brittle or flexible, etc.)   Coat (also known as a rug or blanket) may also refer to a covering or garment made by humans to protect their pets from the elements.

Again, this is a tired and lame apologist argument. It's been debunked too many times. You are looking at the numbers as if they tell the whole tale. Indeed, poverty and lack of access to opportunities such as higher education and healthcare are the biggest contributing factors to gun violence in poor communities. You act like you're doing some civil service by posting a link to a PDF that someone explains all race relations. That's intellectually dishonest and you know it.   Black people always rise to the bait as well   Yeah, I can see how innocent your original post was.   so unlike white people or Asians they are really fun to race bait.   Wow, so superior.   I'm not a racists just a pathological asshole.   /r/wtf"

For some reason, it looks like one of those makeup apps, where you can edit makeup on your face. I'm hoping that's the case, because if not, yeah this seems pretty shitty. Another reason I think""app"" is that getting a baby to sit still putting on mascara seems like only a magician could make it work. I'm 32 years old and still blink like a mad woman and flinch when I put on mascara and come too close to my eyeball with that stick-brush thing.   Edit: oh and also, I think mascara is all that is there. A lot of babies of color seem to have natural ""lip liner"" of sorts. My daughter is mixed and her lips are like that.   Edit 2: also, wanted to say, I'm a little more ticked about the hair. I might be mistaken, but from what I know, to straighten hair like that requires either relaxer (dangerous chemicals) a straight iron (holy shit who puts a flaming hot styling tool next to a kids face?) or I know it can be done if you're good enough with a blow dryer, but again, those things get crazy hot.... I can't think of a single reason to straighten or otherwise relax a baby's hair. That shit is dangerous, and can ruin the kids hair for life."
ghettoglamourshots,28tohl,MydogBatman,7,Mon Jun 23 13:40:14 2014 UTC,My nephew had hair like this. Really curly when wet and then you can use a soft brush to make it lay flat like that. No chemicals needed. I think that's what you're seeing here. It's just a quality some babies have with soft curly hair.
ghettoglamourshots,28tohl,VA1N,1 point,Tue Jun 24 02:08:35 2014 UTC,"Oh, that's a load off! Well, good! I hope this is just a make up app and some easy baby hair! I mean, as long as the girl was in no danger, it is awful cute. Lots of babies look like little grown people. So, I didn't know that....as a person with straight hair I can say I'm ignorant to some of the ins and outs of curly hair."
ghettoglamourshots,28tohl,VA1N,4,Tue Jun 24 02:24:38 2014 UTC,I really hope you are correct.
ghettoglamourshots,28tohl,VA1N,2,Mon Jun 23 13:48:08 2014 UTC,"Don't know if you saw my edit about the hair. But there's really no way I can think of to safely straighten a baby's hair. It's either chemicals or dangerous super hot styling tools. So even if the makeup is fake, that's still quite rage inducing."
ghettoglamourshots,28tohl,-ilostab3t-,2,Mon Jun 23 13:56:55 2014 UTC,"There's no way it's fake?  The front of the head looks real enough though and to straighten it, you're right, that is rage inducing!  I just want to believe that no one would do this to a baby."

ghettoglamourshots,28b5fr,DrSquid,-1,Tue Jun 17 15:20:04 2014 UTC,Actually those on probation with alcohol problems get these.  You're being awfully silly for assuming he's on work release.
ghettoglamourshots,28b5fr,AMasterInIdiocy,3,Tue Jun 17 10:46:54 2014 UTC,There are numerous types of electronic monitors.  You are referring to a SCRAM unit.  It detects alcohol by making contact with the skin.  This unit is over his sock so it is not a SCRAM.  It could be a house arrest type device that makes sure he is at home during certain hours by using a landline connection.  Individuals in my county that are released from jail to go to work or are a sex offender parolee are required to wear a GPS device that constantly monitors your location.

ghettoglamourshots,281auw,olebirddog87,6,Sun Jun 15 18:06:15 2014 UTC,I think this is a cool idea. They obviously loved their mother very much and want to celebrate her life. Good for them and fuck what other people think.

ghettoglamourshots,281auw,AnnabelLee1849,4,Fri Jun 13 13:22:42 2014 UTC,"Second line. I thought that mainly referred to the parades that march and dance down the street, not really a party, per se."
ghettoglamourshots,281auw,alittlebigger,8,Fri Jun 13 14:09:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was trying to think of.  And yes, I think it's traditionally a parade, but I think the idea is that you party to celebrate the person's life/having enjoyed your time with them, as opposed to a sad affair. I lived in NOLA last summer and I always thought this was a cool idea."
ghettoglamourshots,281auw,tinteoj,3,Fri Jun 13 17:18:33 2014 UTC,"It's more like preferring to celebrate the life rather than mourn the passing.  I grew up in Louisiana (not NOLA though, a little to the north of it), and after the initial tears are shed when approaching the casket, things usually delve into swapping stories and laughing about the good times that were had with the deceased.  Liquor optional."

ghettoglamourshots,27yhol,talesofdouchebaggery,-4,Thu Jun 12 15:24:52 2014 UTC,trashy?  Maybe if people can see you.  I live at the end of a cauldesac with only woods visible and i piss in the back yard / off my deck / out my window all the time.  It has many benefits.   Its faster than going to the bathroom Its easier. It saves water. It saves electricity. Because fuck the bathroom.
ghettoglamourshots,27yhol,SexualPie,6,Thu Jun 12 23:06:02 2014 UTC,That's different than pissing on your front steps. Then your house will smell like pee out front and that's gross.
ghettoglamourshots,27yhol,talesofdouchebaggery,-1,Fri Jun 13 05:43:52 2014 UTC,"well i said ""maybe if people can see you"", which implies front porch.  but if you piss in the grass the smell wont last longer than a couple minutes max."

ghettoglamourshots,27yhol,NewWhirledOrder,0,Thu Jun 12 23:22:04 2014 UTC,"I don't piss on my hands?  Its actually kind of interesting.  most people wash their hands after, but wouldn't it make more sense to wash your hands before?  I mean think about it.  All your dick does is sit in your boxers and do nothing.  it might get some sweat or something, but unless you're leaking theres no mess.  On the other hand your hands have been doin stuff all over the place.  you should be more worried about getting your dick dirty shouldnt you?  If I piss out the window then theres absolutely zero chance for splash back, so i would wash my hands why?  because they touched skin?  My dick is cleaner than my arms or legs.  Its been protected and safe between two different layers of clothing with nothing to make it dirty except it self.  and again, I dont leak.  Well, maybe a bit after I cum, but thats a different story."
ghettoglamourshots,27yhol,SexualPie,2,Thu Jun 12 23:32:04 2014 UTC,"I also wash pre piss if not at home and also piss outside all the time.

ghettoglamourshots,27aw3v,SpectreAnitaShepard,19,Wed Jun 4 18:21:00 2014 UTC,"It doesn't matter if they're cutting them short - the chemicals used in the process are dangerous for an adult, let alone a toddler...   It can also do permanent damage to the nail bed and fingers. And her hands are probably so delicate at that point in her growth that if she were to accidentally snap off an artificial nail, it might take her whole fingernail with it."
ghettoglamourshots,27aw3v,zottz,3,Wed Jun 4 20:45:08 2014 UTC,"Not to mention, I have fake ass nails. Not only are they painful once they've been put on (I am not sure if you know the exact process but they literally take a fucking sander to your nail to make texture to help the gel and nails stick) for about 24 hours but they can limit what you can actually do.   When I first had these put on everyday things like earrings and buckling a seat belt were hard because I wasn't used to the extra nail length. Kids should be playing tag and fucking around not having this shit forced on them by parents.  Also it makes your actual nails flimsy as shit and all yellowed and NASTY."
ghettoglamourshots,27aw3v,zottz,15,Wed Jun 4 18:21:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah. No salon reputable enough to use the ""safe"" chemicals would put acrylics on a toddler. So that's a moot point."

ghettoglamourshots,27aw3v,Super_delicious,5,Thu Jun 5 00:06:51 2014 UTC,"? Just because it's legal doesn't make it safe/""not dangerous"" for a fucking toddler. I can smell the acetone/formaldehyde just walking past a nail salon on the street. It's probably not gonna kill the kid the one time but it's not exactly safe to expose her to all the fumes and acrylic filings (I currently have acrylic filing induced asthma from frequently having gotten my nails done in the past). I mean shit, I may not have all the facts but is it so far out of the realm of possibilities that this is just a regular, chemical-y nail salon and not some toddler-friendly nail salon where the fake nails are licked on by puppies with non-toxic saliva glue?"
ghettoglamourshots,27aw3v,K-Lynn,-6,Thu Jun 5 00:57:58 2014 UTC,You do realize most salons are run by Asians that most likely use the illegal stuff because it works so much better right? That stuff will eat away at your nail beds.
ghettoglamourshots,27aw3v,Super_delicious,5,Thu Jun 5 01:37:29 2014 UTC,Can't tell if you're being facetious or you actually believe this nonsense...?
ghettoglamourshots,27aw3v,Super_delicious,2,Thu Jun 5 01:50:11 2014 UTC,Well when your mother works in salons all your life you learn a few things. One was never get acrylic nails long term and the other was never let a friend cut your hair.

One of the worst, most annoying things I've ever seen. It makes it hard to even look at my friend's page if the other friend shows up anywhere. He's got the defiant ""I'm a hardcore motherfucker"" pose in his prison clothes. She's got the extra zoom in on her fat head pouty-face pose. There are roses in between them. Of course the profile has both of their first names and his last name, even though they're not married. He's probably going right back to jail when he gets out and sees the profile. Either for peace and quiet, or for murder.  TL;DR - fathead and angryprisonerguy are not actually engaged."

I don't even see how visitors get cameras inside.  On another note though, usually if they have people talking through that TV thingie, it's because the prisoner got into a fight or something, or is seen as a threat (for violence).  It might not be true in every prison, but it's a possibility.  Usually they let you have a face-to-face visit, behind glass."

ghettoglamourshots,25j95g,tears_of_a_Shark,1 point,Thu May 15 23:20:30 2014 UTC,"Paul explains it quite well in Galatians.  ""‚Ä¶But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed. Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.""  The Law was designed to give basic outlines of what was considered righteous by Jews before Christ came. After Christ came, what was considered righteous was replaced with a more forgiving, peaceful message (the New Testament) and thus the mosaic law no longer applies to Christians except for the parts of it that are explicitly stated to still be in effect (the Ten Commandments)."

ghettoglamourshots,251xw8,autowikibot,3,Thu May 8 18:39:52 2014 UTC,"Redd Foxx:       John Elroy Sanford  (December 9, 1922 ‚Äì October 11, 1991), known professionally as Redd Foxx, was an American comedian and actor, best remembered for his explicit comedy records and his starring role on the 1970s sitcom Sanford and Son.   Foxx gained notoriety with his raunchy nightclub acts during the 1950s and 1960s. Known as the ""King of the Party Records"", he performed on more than 50 records in his lifetime. He also starred in Sanford, The Redd Foxx Show and The Royal Family. His film roles included All the Fine Young Cannibals (1960) and Harlem Nights (1989).  In 2004, Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time ranked Foxx as the 24th best stand-up comedian.  Foxx not only influenced many comedians,  but was often portrayed in popular culture as well, mainly as a result of his famous catchphrases, body language and facial expressions exhibited on Sanford and Son.

Especially if you were born with a funny arch, or really thick brows. My grandma and I tatted ours on because we both had them fall out. I was like 24, they got super patchy and didn't really grow. That's always a huge gamble, just as drawn on eyebrows can be ugly, you run the risk of tatted ones being permanently ugly. I lucked out with mine and they turned out exactly like I wanted, but I've seen some train wreck tattooed eyebrows. Sorry, but I agree, even with the somewhat over the top brows, there's nothing ""ghetto"" about this. Just another selfie.
