Lubbock,3e3sny,sectexan,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"I swear I remember hearing that Lubbock had dog parks in the past, and people couldn't be bothered to clean up after their dogs, so they became a giant cesspool of shit and then everyone that lived around the parks complained of the smell and the City shut them down."
Lubbock,3e3sny,g1bs0nsg,3,Tue Jul 21 20:39:51 2015 UTC,From what I recall Lubbock actually was a winner of a paid dogpark in a competition.  The City declined it for some reason I don't remember.

I also worked part time at United as a cashier for a few months while working full time. It wasn't bad, but I preferred the pizza delivery job cause I made more money after tips and it was a more chill environment. The maximum that United would pay a cashier is about $9 an hour when I was there. I was making about $12-$14 an hour after tips and delivery fees at Dominos. Base is generally minimum wage, though.

Like it's selfish to keep lotto winnings quiet to protect yourself and the people around you. If I won no one would know if I could help it. I'd do what I could to spread the wealth a little bit but I wouldn't let on I was doing it.  The stories about people who win and the aftermath are pretty wild.

Lubbock,3dc1l7,raiderdebater15,3,Wed Jul 15 02:32:59 2015 UTC,"Try Petfinder and typing in the breed to find an adoptable pug in close proximity. Even if there isn't one super close a lot of rescues will make huge efforts to get an animal into a loving family's arms.   Also, depending on what attracted you to the breed, there may be some easier fits out there for someone living on their own for the first time. Pugs are brachycephalic, (think smooshy face), which means they have a lot of respiratory issues and struggle with the heat. They also are prone to eye issues and seizures.   Not trying to rain on your pug parade but just wanted you have to have a little more info so you could be prepared for veterinary expenses associated with the breed. :) A good compromise may be a Chug or chihuahua pug mix. It will be heartier and healthier while still having a lot of the awesome pug mannerisms."

The pork spareribs had a light rub and a nice smoky flavor, and the sausage was juicy and had a sweet tangy flavor, also with a nice smoke. Sides were good, they appear to be homemade. Next time I'll try the mac & cheese. Service was friendly with a man I believe is the owner taking your order and cutting your meat, and the place was clean with some neat art on the walls.

Lubbock,3cksvg,shoulinjedi,2,Thu Jul 9 20:04:13 2015 UTC,"Just went, not very good.   BRISKET - It looks like they are only using the flat from the brisket and first strike, they cut off all of the fat and bark off the top before slicing.  The brisket itself had no smoke ring, not much flavor besides a little bit of soy sauce flavor. The texture was rubbery and uniform throughout.   SAUSAGE -  This was almost inedible as it had an overpowering natural gas flavor.  It appeared to be some generic store bought sausage, no color on the outside, as if it had just been warmed in the oven."
Lubbock,3cksvg,Kakona,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"I went with fusion. He is being kind. I couldnt eat the sausage it tasted so much like gas. The point was not attached to the brisket. It was one of those old lady briskets you buy in the grocery store to cook in your oven. IDK if they cooked a point at all. Notice I said ""cooked."" Immediately I noticed there wasnt a pitt of any kind, just some gas device in the back. I asked if he could give me some moist and he said he had some on the flat. I didnt want to argue. I had to use sauce, a lot of sauce. These are nice people, but it is not BBQ.  (edit for sp)"
Lubbock,3cksvg,blindfusion,3,Thu Jul 9 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"I couldn't eat the sausage it tasted so much like gas.   Wow, I thought it was a nice smoky flavor.   It was one of those old lady briskets you buy in the grocery store to cook in your oven. IDK if they cooked a point at all.   Incorrect. If you check the facebook pics you can see a frig loaded with briskets. These are 12-16 lb packer trimmed briskets, the same ones most places use. The ARE available at some grocery stores, but they're not what you're describing. fusion got it right, they are cutting of the top/point and serving the bottom/flat. Not sure what they're doing with the top. Most places around here trim out the fat, chop it up and mix with sauce and call it ""chopped beef"", but I didn't see that on the menu.   I noticed there wasnt a pitt of any kind, just some gas device in the back.   Yes, the facebook pics also show the smoker, which looks to be gas and/or electric powered. It is not a wood-fired smoker. Still, some are able to achieve pretty high levels of excellence with these types of smokers, which throw off very little smoke and are easier to use in an in-line retail space like the one Flatlands occupies next to a bank. Even Austin is cracking down on the smoke from outdoor pits these days. Many prefer the wood pits, though. I do.  People might be wondering how there can be such a variance with the reviews shown here. It's because BBQ is, I believe, one of the most difficult cuisines to prepare well consistently. The quality of smoked meat you are served can vary based on the outside temperature, the moisture in the wood, the temperature of the meat when it's put on, the fat in the meat, or whether the restaurant had food left over from the day before (meaning you're getting reheated product). So one day it's good, the next not so good. This is why Aaron Franklin in Austin is considered such a god - he manages all these variables and still serves excellent, best-you-ever-had brisket every time he opens his doors. Nobody in Lubbock even comes close, at least not yet, though I agree with u/o_g that Evie Mae's is very good."
Lubbock,3cksvg,Kakona,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know how often you've had Evie Mae's but the all 4-5 times I've been there, they have been consistently excellent.  I've never had Franklin, but I've had Micklethwait, Louis Mueller, John Mueller and La Barbecue from central Texas.  And I can tell you that Evie Mae's is that level of BBQ.  TMBBQ gives Evie Mae's a 4.25/5 rating, which puts it firmly in that elite category.   I don't know if we just caught a bad run at Flatlands or something, but it was not good.  He cut the fat cap off completely and tossed it into some container on the ground. It had little smoke taste and was overcooked.  Especially starting out, you've got to make sure you're serving your best.  I know the four people I took out there aren't coming back."
Lubbock,3cksvg,blindfusion,2,Thu Jul 9 21:13:25 2015 UTC,"I'm due to return to Evie Mae's. It was really good when I went the first time. It looks to me like Evie Mae's is serving their BBQ in the Central Texas style, using smaller briskets that they slice whole, without trimming out the fat. As far as I know they're the only ones doing it that way around here. Daniel from TM won't pay attention to any other style, so any shop that tops out a bigger brisket and slices the bottom will simply be ignored by him in most cases - he thinks they're Philistines. That said, I agree with his review of Evie Mae's, and I'm very glad to have them. Franklin's was the best I ever had, though, no doubt.  It sucks that y'all had a bad visit at Flatlands today. Besides the sausage, I don't really disagree with what you wrote, and we might have been there at the same time. I just hate to play the ""never going back"" card after one visit, because I know from experience how hard it is to deliver good BBQ every day. I don't know the owner, but he seems like a dude trying to live a dream, so I hope you will give him at least one more try before saying never. If he's better then you can tell your friends y'all caught him on a bad day."
Lubbock,3cksvg,shoulinjedi,2,Thu Jul 9 22:01:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, maybe one day I might go back, but it's just hard to give them more money after a poor experience."
Lubbock,3cksvg,Kakona,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:06:55 2015 UTC,"Grocery store briskets cut the point off. These briskets did not have a point. It was removed before the cook because there was bark there. Fusion noted they cut the fat off, this is not the same as the point. Fat that has been rendered properly does not need to be cut off. I asked for meat form a point and was essentially told no. I can only assume this is because they did not have a point to serve. With out arguing too much, this meat had no, as in ZERO, smoke ring. That is all that needs to be said. Again, I do not wish ill will to these people. They are nice folk, but no smoke ring?"
Lubbock,3cksvg,shoulinjedi,2,Thu Jul 9 21:48:57 2015 UTC,"Well, the point/cap/top does not cover the entire flat/bottom, especially after cooking, so there will be some bark even after the point/cap/top is removed. I recognized the techniques he used because I've cooked and trimmed so many of those types of briskets myself. At our place we would remove the top and keep the bottom for ""sliced beef"", which we charged more for because it was so lean (completely opposite Central Texas style, which places the premium on moistness). The top we trimmed out, chopped up and mixed with sauce as ""chopped beef"" on sandwiches and frito pies. This is still a pretty common way to serve brisket around here. Anyway, I think we're both right, and I agree that there was little to no smoke in the brisket today.

Lubbock,3cksvg,Kakona,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:24:18 2015 UTC,"Menu and plate pic  3 meat with brisket, sausage, and ribs with sides of potato salad and beans. They were out of mac and cheese.   Sausage had that weird flavor someone else said was gas. I can see where coming from. My guess is brand new stainless steel smoker still putting off some ""new car smell.""  Brisket kinda dry with not much smoke. Nothing bad though.  Ribs fine.  Beans not my cup of tea. I like some gravy with my pintos. These were dry with some bacon. Again, not bad but meh.  Potato salad was good.  BBQ sauce is gallon containers of Head Country. Saw them pouring it.   They come nowhere close to Evies or The Shack but always good to see a new place. Hope they do well and improve a little."
Lubbock,3cksvg,shoulinjedi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:07:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe their equipment needs to be seasoned. I know my pit does. No smoke ring in that photo. Im sure lots of people will like this place, like Bigham's. Its a nice interior and nice folk, but short on quality compared to Evie Mae's (the closest thing to Franklins youre going to get in this area). When they improve a bit let us know so we can give em a fair shake."
Lubbock,3cksvg,Kakona,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:57:17 2015 UTC,"After this thread I was itching to get back to Evie Mae's, so I went today and was disappointed. The reason is simple - the brisket was overcooked, and not very smoky. Here's a picture of my order, and another close-up view of the brisket. Leaving that layer of fat made each bite moist enough, but there was no disguising the fact that the bottom/flat part was dry and crumbly, so I was reaching for the sauce. You can even see how little pieces of dried beef were flecking off of the thick slices. As for the rest of my meal, the sausage was delicious, if a little crumbly inside the casing, and the potato salad was meh to my tastes - I'm not a pickle and celery guy, and those flavors and textures dominate it.  Now I will definitely be back to Evie Mae's, and hopefully they'll be back on their game. To me, my experience today bears out what I wrote in a different post on this thread - consistent BBQ is really, really difficult to produce. This is especially true when you're doing it the hard way, on a wood-burning pit. There are so many variables. Maybe mine was dry today because I got it at 12:30pm and it had been sitting around a while - who knows? It's clear that what I got today was not the same quality I've received from there before, and not what Daniel from Texas Monthly was served when he wrote them up."

Lubbock,3c3omo,KushKong420,3,Sun Jul 5 02:50:32 2015 UTC,"Sure. The drug war. The entire criminal ""justice"" system in general. The death penalty. ""Gay rights"". ( I say that as someone who thinks the government should have little to nothing to do with marriage in general). And really, if you want to engage in an intellectual argument on that front, I realize my views are totally out of sync."
Lubbock,3c3omo,Red_Baron_1,2,Sun Jul 5 03:10:41 2015 UTC,"Personally, when it comes to social issues, I'm almost libertarian because for the most part I think the government needs to stay out of our private lives. The drug war for instance has created far more problems than it has solved, if not for the drug war gangs and the cartels would not hold the power they do today much the same way the mob grew exponentially when alcohol was illegal, if recreational drugs were legal for adults many deaths could be prevented  and treatment would be more widely available. When it comes to marriage equality I think we should do something similar to what the French do when the ""marriage license"" is just a civil union and if you wish to get ""married"" in a church that is your right. When it comes to economic issues I tend to be pretty left of center in thinking that the rich need to pay more taxes because the make significantly more money, something like 50% of the wealth in this country is controlled by 10% of the population. I am very pro gun rights, but that's probably just the Texan in me though lol. So when it comes to politics I'm kinda all over the map. What lead me to believe that Texas will turn blue or at least purple is the large influx of people from the west coast and the large number of LEGAL immigrants who tend to vote democratic as well as the younger demographic being disillusioned by what the see with the GOP when it comes to social issues.  Thanks for your time, I may not agree with what you have to say but I respect your right to say it. 🇺🇸"

Lubbock,3c41a7,fittysix,6,Sat Jul 4 15:49:47 2015 UTC,"Start by collecting coupons.  Second, give up because our local grocers have no significant competition and do not offer the kinds of discounts you can find in a metropolitan area.  Kroger in the South, for example, has to compete heavily with Brookshire, Albertsons, WalMart, and the list goes on, so they have things like double and triple coupon days where you can actually walk out with more money than you went in with.  In Lubbock WalMart and United are essentially the only major grocers and they just kind of match one another."

Lubbock,3bnoaf,dianasparx,2,Wed Jul 1 18:54:27 2015 UTC,50th Street Caboose is decently fun if you go late on a weeknight to avoid the infestation of children. I think they still have half price games (that dont give tickets) on Tuesdays
Lubbock,3bnoaf,dianasparx,2,Wed Jul 1 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"Not Main Event, but not Kong's either?  Not arguing,  more like looking for ideas and clarification on what those two come up short on and where the middle ground is."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,BinaryMagick,4,Wed Jul 1 00:11:51 2015 UTC,"Not a bar, and not overpriced, but with more games. Like a larger scale arcade where games don't cost more than 50 or 75 cents. There was an arcade near the college I went to that was like this called Pinball Pete's. It was amazing!"
Lubbock,3bnoaf,femmersl,5,Wed Jul 1 00:22:11 2015 UTC,We had one in San Antonio for years called Larzland. Everything was .10 and it ruled.
Lubbock,3bnoaf,bumtowntrainer,9,Wed Jul 1 03:59:17 2015 UTC,"Drag strip and road course.  Mr. Mears tried to acquire the old Reese air strip for an NHRA class drag strip that would bring big events multiple times a year (on the level of a TTU rivalry football game for money brought into the area), the people on the development board said no.  They straight up turned down millions in tax dollars per year to keep it from being developed properly so they could keep the golfers happy and maybe build houses that are far away from anything of potential development.  If it isn't football or golf, they don't really seem interested in changing things up."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,_WarShrike_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:24:57 2015 UTC,There is a drag strip in Idalou. $10 and you can race your car all you want.
Lubbock,3bnoaf,UberXLBK,3,Wed Jul 1 14:05:44 2015 UTC,"That strip is a joke of what it used to be. They only have head to head races these days, no time slips or bracket racing. It is pretty much just a place to legally street race for $10."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,ambulancemechanic,3,Wed Jul 1 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in the old shutdown area without timing.  Used to go out there all the time back before the contractor Dennis hired screwed up the whole reconstruction of the track and left him with a ruined drag strip.  1/4 mile with timer and capability of doing other events like a standing mile or rolling 1/2 mile is more along the lines of what I am referring to."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,_WarShrike_,25,Wed Jul 1 14:25:46 2015 UTC,"Entertainment. We have become a suburb of ourselves. We need distractions and attractions. At least a top golf for now. No more restaurants. No more churches,  no more banks, just fucking something to God damn do."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,BNLforever,4,Tue Jun 30 18:08:51 2015 UTC,I have been saying Top Golf for years. I would like a good rock wall facility. Defying Gravity was too far of a drive from the center of town and struggled with management. Now it is closed and the Rec has the only worth while climbing area.

Lubbock,3bnoaf,BinaryMagick,6,Tue Jun 30 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"We have 4 first run movie theaters, Main Event, Bowling Alleys, a crappy water park  and crappy amusement park, The Science Spectrum, TTU Museum, CAT Theatre, Tech Sports, first Friday art tour, Cactus Theater, Buddy Holly Center. South Plains fair, and you can go see a band every night of the week at countless bars or coffee shops. What more are you looking for?  Check this out - http://www.thelbk.com"
Lubbock,3bnoaf,acquaman831,7,Tue Jun 30 19:31:31 2015 UTC,"you can go see a band every night of the week   A band every night of the week? Sure, but only if you're in to bro-country, Journey cover bands, or whatever headlining act stops by the Spirit Arena for their decennial trip through LBK.    first Friday art tour   First Friday is 3 hours once a month, not much of a fallback.   crappy water park and crappy amusement park   speaks for itself"
Lubbock,3bnoaf,TeddyPicker,11,Tue Jun 30 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"The music criticism is just incorrect. Blue Light features some of the best original artists in Lubbock and Texas consistently. And yes, They skew more towards country, folk, and Americana, but it's anything but 'bro-country'. Several local coffee shops and Mean Woman Grill also have some very good local artists and Jakes has some good heavy metal and hard rock acts come through. We're never gonna have a music scene like Austin, but Lubbock ain't bad.   First Friday is a valid option. I'm sure none of us have the time, money, or energy to go out and do something every night of the week, but a monthly dose of culture is pretty cool.   As far as shit to do on a regular basis, Lubbock kicks the ass out of Amarillo, Midland, Odessa, Abilene and any other town in west Texas that is comparable in size. We may grow to Austin size in a couple of decades, but it's not gonna happen overnight. Lubbock is still a very conservative town and fears change and business owners are aware of this.   The last 5-7 years have shown more business growth in Lubbock than I've seen in the previous 20. I know for college students coming from Dallas or Houston who had tons of shit to do on a regular basis and/or is only living in Lubbock temporarily, it may seem like crap. But for long time Lubbockites like myself, this is the most exciting time to live in this city. Enjoy what we have! :)"
Lubbock,3bnoaf,acquaman831,2,Tue Jun 30 21:40:35 2015 UTC,"All good points. Admittedly, I was a student that moved here years ago for college from halfway between Austin and San Antonio, so my experiences are a bit biased. It just kills me that Lubbock is so quick to pride itself on culture, music specifically, yet there is so little interest in utilizing that beyond a quick cash grab. The area keeps beating the dead horse that is Buddy Holly's legacy while not providing a means for current artists to build upon his impact. There are so many great local acts and musicians, but the entertainment scene is so disjointed that good acts have to leave while they can to achieve any type of fanbase."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,TeddyPicker,4,Tue Jun 30 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you on the music. We do have good country acts, but aside from a few bands, outside of country and singer/songwriter acts, all of it is covers. 90s covers, Top 40 covers, that's pretty much it. That is absolutely terrible. San Angelo has more original non-country music than that. San Freaking Angelo."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,ScubaSteeeve,11,Tue Jun 30 21:59:50 2015 UTC,"You're joking right? You don't want anything more?  The science spectrum hasn't changed much in years (I love that place) buddy holly is an expensive five minute walk,  first Friday is only on the first Friday,  the fair is only a limited run once a year,  I could go on. Is it wrong to want more from Lubbock? We are capable of supporting more businesses and a wide variety of them.  Bars and coffee aren't any more an activity than a restaurant."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,BNLforever,2,Tue Jun 30 19:43:37 2015 UTC,I would love to see

Lubbock,3bnoaf,bucket46,5,Tue Jun 30 22:38:06 2015 UTC,Look at the other markets TG is in. What's the difference?  Oh only a few hundred if not millions of people. A higher average income. And a mecca for others.
Lubbock,3bnoaf,BNLforever,-2,Tue Jun 30 22:40:52 2015 UTC,I think you're thinking about it too hard.

Lubbock,3bnoaf,acquaman831,0,Wed Jul 1 16:54:33 2015 UTC,"We'll never get s Braums. The stores are all corporate owned, not franchises. And they only build locations within a 250 mile radius of their Oklahoma City home office. This is mainly due to quality control issues, because they make their own dairy products. Lubbock is outside of that 250 mile radius."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,Elliotm77,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:32:59 2015 UTC,Doesn't one exist in the midland area?
Lubbock,3bnoaf,acquaman831,2,Mon Jul 6 06:39:26 2015 UTC,"No, there isn't one in Midland. The closest one to Lubbock is in Canyon and there are 5 in Amarillo. They also have locations in Wichita Falls and the DFW area, but everywhere else in Texas is outside the 250 mile radius."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,Elliotm77,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:45:26 2015 UTC,It's really a shame. I love their food.
Lubbock,3bnoaf,Rocksteady717,8,Tue Jul 7 00:15:19 2015 UTC,"Less focus on more shitty restaurant chains, more focus on entertainment in general. And I miss having a mini-golf place."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,beer4mike,11,Wed Jul 1 14:29:44 2015 UTC,A Dog park would be nice. Oh or drivers that realize they are NOT the only car on the road.
Lubbock,3bnoaf,beer4mike,2,Tue Jun 30 18:11:08 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand why the city of Lubbock is so anti-dog parks. I read somewhere that it was going to cost roughly $500,000 to build a single dog park near Mackenzie Park, whereas Amarillo built several dog parks for $35,000 total."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,bettyepallmall,9,Tue Jun 30 18:19:00 2015 UTC,Just put a fence up in the shape of a square. Bam!
Lubbock,3bnoaf,Agallion,2,Tue Jun 30 19:18:57 2015 UTC,Seriously. Throw a couple of benches in there and you're good to go.
Lubbock,3bnoaf,acquaman831,2,Tue Jun 30 23:40:53 2015 UTC,The city approved land for a non profit to run a dog park near Milwaukee and MS but the Non profit lost interest.  It's way more complicated than you think
Lubbock,3bnoaf,JDgoesmarching,3,Wed Jul 1 09:41:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a dog park is one of only things that Lubbock is truly lacking, IMO. It would be a huge mistake to put it in Mackenzie park, though. Maxy park might not be bad because it's in a central location.   Amarillo has a dog park in Thompson Park which is pretty much the same, right down to the crappy amusement park. No one goes to that dog park even though it's huge. When I was living there, everyone in Amarillo went to the smaller dog park on the SW side of town."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,nukedorbit,7,Tue Jun 30 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy with some active Meetup groups during the summer. I don't care if it's sports, DnD, or Tasmanian skirt dancing. I just want to do things with people."

Lubbock,3bnoaf,Bohrdog,6,Wed Jul 1 02:26:29 2015 UTC,"For all my fellow nerds, check out Storm Crow Games on 34th, the couple who run it are hands down the best games store owners I've ever met, very knowledgeable and professional, not to mention friendly.   The place has regular ctg, roleplaying, and board game nights, but what really snagged me was the table top scene. Aaron (the owner) runs better war machine and warhammer/40k tournaments than I've ever seen, very knowledgeable about the rules and meta around the games and thus able to put together good rule sets and make good decisions as TO. If you play those games, be sure to check out the store (and watch out for me at the next tournament!)."

Lubbock,3bnoaf,femmersl,5,Tue Jun 30 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"I think that Lubbock actually has a fair amount to do, it more that the stuff that it does have is, frankly, outdated. If you updated some of these bars, the waterpark, amusement park, the Tech Museum, etc., that would be what Lubbock is missing.   It's just a matter of modernizing/bringing diversity to the town."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,femmersl,5,Tue Jun 30 23:19:14 2015 UTC,"For one, I think that Lubbock would be a great location for a 3 day music festival. We have more than enough space, similar climate to Indio (where Coachella and Stagecoach is held) and have an established history of music. Would be a great way to help revive the music scene and would bring in serious dollars for the city. Obviously it wouldn't be the scale of Coachella or ACL, but I know that Coachella brought in $80 million for the city of Indio (and surrounding towns) in 2014."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,UberXLBK,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:35:22 2015 UTC,"They had Lubbock MusicFest a few years ago, which was fun! Small scale, but something to do."

Lubbock,3bnoaf,the_mallrat92,2,Wed Jul 1 08:13:55 2015 UTC,"Lubbock definitely needs a good dim sum place. We have decent Thai but overall, Lubbock has pretty shitty Chinese food. Most are buffets that end up on Food for Thought for food violations."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,ScubaSteeeve,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:59:11 2015 UTC,Agreed on the road course.
Lubbock,3bnoaf,MataDaRata,3,Wed Jul 1 14:30:23 2015 UTC,"Safety and development along the Canyon Lakes System.  If you've ever walked, ran, biked or driven the stretch from N University (Buddy Holly Recreation Area) to Mae Simmons/Lake Dunbar, you know that it is a really pretty stretch of canyons, lakes, trees, etc.  However, folks who live west of Indiana are (irrationally) terrified to go over there.    Maybe the 4th on Broadway in Mackenzie Park will help the perception of the area.  There is the Ag Museum and the Wind Power Museum, the Wells Fargo Amphitheater, and JoyLand down there.    It's a shame to me the rim of the canyon is populated by storage units, concrete mixing plants, and crappy houses.  Furthermore, the stretch of road that goes under I-27 from Mackenzie Park was designed with huge piers to accommodate the eventual widening and deepening of the lakes, much like Town Lake in Austin.  If we did that, we'd have a large body of navigable water INSIDE THE LOOP, near TTU and downtown.  Having that resource would do more for downtown redevelopment than anything done so far."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,Livetopick,2,Wed Jul 1 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of the civic orojects in Lubbock were like that, they sort of got started and never finished. You can tell by how overbuilt the roads on the North Side of town are and the fact that they put the airport and gold courses out there that they expected the city to grow more north than south like it did."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,ScubaSteeeve,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"That is actually in response to the 1970 tornado that started just east of TTU and ran northeast.  The destruction that event caused directly and perhaps permanently shifted construction toward the southwest, starting with South Plains Mall.  Developers and citizens fled the torn up NE side of town."
Lubbock,3bnoaf,Livetopick,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"That would be phenomenal. Imagine being able to kayak, stand up paddleboard, etc downtown... when the summer weather isn't too brutal."

Lubbock,3bnoaf,Bohrdog,8,Sun Jul 5 22:32:47 2015 UTC,"More original music with more diverse genres. We have way too many cover bands compared to original acts here. Buddy Holly wouldn't be able to make it in Lubbock's music scene today. We need more original rock, blues, punk, alternative, hip-hop, you name it. Our country/Americana scene is good, but sucks to be you if that's not your bag. A decent, halfway authentic Chinese restaurant. Dim sum, preferably. (Most of the Asian restaurants here are really conservative Americanized stuff or specialize in Thai, Vietnamese, or Korean food.) Dog parks. Places for dogs to get off their leashes and let loose. Up until recently, a decent boba tea place. I <3 Pho sells pretty good stuff, though."

The population of Lubbock, and the lack of population surrounding it make a decent mall more of a far out dream. If there were one or two men's boutiques around town that didn't specialize it expensive suits I'd be happy though."

I didn't realize how much I loved it till I moved here. I don't even wear anything but t-shirts and jeans! But there's a huge difference between walking around Northpark or Stonebriar or even the outdoor places there and people watching/window shipping versus anyplace here. It's just not a valid way to spend a Saturday afternoon. And there's no Paciugo's. I didn't realize what a stupid North Dallas snob I was till I left.

They do more than just cuts if you want to go full metro (waxing, beard trim, scalp massage), but their whole 'thing' is a man cave vibe like having TV s tuned to sports channels with staff who will talk sportcenter with you. I was actually slightly out of place for not wanting to talk about the draft or whatever.  The only thing they can't do is a straight razor shave, but I think that has something to do with getting a license so it may have changed since I last went there."

Lubbock,3bju5g,_WarShrike_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:03:39 2015 UTC,"When I worked for JTI as a leasing agent/maintenance guy, Bear Flats had an interesting mix of students (mostly upper level undergrad and grad students).  They were still some of my favorite clients to work with and all had unique ways they set up their apartments and used the space creatively.  It doesn't have covered parking, and there isn't a pool on site (I believe you can still hoof it over to St. Francis Village for the pool as it is a sister property and the manager might let you use it).  They have washer/dryer hookups and are a bit of a rustic style.  There were two phases, both have some unique styling cues to them on the interior that is very apparent in the top floor apartments.  First phase buildings have more of a lodge style space frame rafter design, while the second phase is a vaulted ceiling design which makes the whole apartment feel friggin huge.  If you can nab one of the 2nd floor end apartments with the large window that goes up to the peak of the ceiling, it really adds to the atmosphere in the apartment.  You'll need to go to the leasing office at St. Francis Village to see if you can check out the apartments.  http://www.lubbockapartments.com/property-search/property/bear-flats"
Lubbock,3bju5g,_WarShrike_,2,Tue Jun 30 04:45:01 2015 UTC,dang those do look pretty unique and very close to the law school.  thanks for the info.  are the st francis apts the same style as bear?
Lubbock,3bju5g,Txaggs,2,Tue Jun 30 05:03:07 2015 UTC,"They have the stucco exterior, but that's about it.  The bedrooms are very massive.  I believe it is 14ft. x 20ft.  We had some residents that would just rent a two bedroom so they had an entertainment room in one and the bedroom or office and stuff in another.  When I left a few years back, they were looking at installing washer/dryer connections.  Looks like they have it now.  There are a few that are legitimately cool on that property as well.  There is a 1-bedroom/1-bath directly above the office and then on the back side of that same area there is a 2 bedroom/1-bath apt that is over the maintenance shop, so no noise complaints from downstairs neighbors.  Some of these apartments share a patio with their neighbors, so pay close attention to that aspect.  Then across the street, 1st floor to the far west, there is a nice apartment there that has a walk in shower and some other things that were done a few years ago.  I can't comment on whether it is rented or not, but they can give you an idea of what apts are available."

Lubbock,3bge0m,aheartapart,8,Mon Jun 29 00:09:28 2015 UTC,"By same logic, seems like clerks could also deny opposite sex marriage licenses on grounds they disagree with marriage.  Doesn't this guy realize what a can of worms he is opening allowing denial of legally authorized services just because worker ""doesn't agree""?  e.g., ""I don't agree with welfare, and even though I work for WIC, I refuse to provide formula to poor new mothers.""  ""I work for TxDOT, but I believe that driving cars damages the environment that are sacred to my religion, so I am not going to build this road.  Just leaning on my shovel all day.""  If you cannot do your job for the state, which is granting state documents to couples under the law (not religious documents), then you need to ask for a transfer.  At the very least, each office should be required to provide someone who is willing to comply with the law."

He's an idiot."
Lubbock,3bge0m,Epinondus,4,Mon Jun 29 09:28:18 2015 UTC,I like the part where he said scotus can't decide the way we live but he's saying he can and so can his religion by discriminating against people with different beliefs.  I hate how people cite their religious views. It's not a matter of religion it's a matter of rights.  Just because your religion says something is forbidden that doesn't make it right to impose that on everyone.
Lubbock,3bge0m,BNLforever,2,Mon Jun 29 16:22:18 2015 UTC,"So by his stupid ass comment. If a religion only allows prearranged marriages. They could say no to everyone that isn't prearranged. Or interracial, racial, ect.   I would love to see a gay county clerk refuse straight couples lol"

Lubbock,3bge0m,sarcastasaur,-5,Mon Jun 29 07:27:20 2015 UTC,"He has a (kind of) point that a person should not be required to issue a marriage license if their religious views prohibit this. HOWEVER, this assumes that the marriage license issued by the state/county/etc is a religious document that is protected by religious freedom. I would argue that a marriage license is not a religious document. That would imply that states (and other government organizations) have enacted laws that ""respect an establishment of religion"". If, however, a marriage license is indeed considered a religious document then, to avoid violating the first amendment, the state would be required to provide separate licenses (or clerks) for each religion. Even if it is not a religious document but people should be allowed to object to issuing a license based on their religion, the state would then be required to employ clerks who do not object in order to avoid ""respecting an establishment of religion""."

Put on your Sunday best, pick a church with your age group, say your prayers, and join a small group the first chance you get. Lubbock churches are very accepting, and I'm sure you can find great (religious) partners this way.  If you aren't religious, you have to step up your game a bit. I'd recommend focusing on a specific hobby that will bring you towards other singles. For example, sand volleyball or dancing will get you around other single people. Lubbock has plenty of beautiful people, but it is pretty difficult to meet new people here. You have to network a lot and work for it  Of course, I don't know anything about you. Whether you like to go out, are a man or woman, gay or straight, young or old, all will lead to drastically different advice."

Late at night I was able to time the lights so that I hit the intersection at speed exactly as the light turned green. I'd zoom past the car in the middle lane (if any) and then cut in front.

The gist is amazing food with struggling service. Makes sense with a new business. I'm trying it out tonight.
Lubbock,3b77f9,Epinondus,2,Fri Jun 26 16:36:54 2015 UTC,Go and report back
Lubbock,3b77f9,WTXRed,2,Fri Jun 26 15:34:40 2015 UTC,"Soooo much better than Saigon. Service was okay. Much better than I expected after reading yesterday's reviews. A little slow but nothing unreasonable. When we cashed out, the older man cashiering inquired to our service experience so I think they realize how important it is to get it on point. We got shrimp spring rolls, egg rolls, the pho with all the yummy stuff, (tripe, tendon, fatty brisket, meatballs), and fried rice with tofu. The bowl of pho was huge. We will go back soon."
Lubbock,3b77f9,Epinondus,2,Sat Jun 27 01:25:38 2015 UTC,"While we're on the subject, is there anywhere in Lubbock to get authentic ramen? Noodles & Company doesn't seem to have it."

The boba tea is okay too, but again expensive for the size of the tea.  The service is slow, but they just opened, so I'm sure they will get faster eventually."

Lubbock,3b35qc,fittysix,5,Thu Jun 25 16:18:19 2015 UTC,I've driven all over the western half of this country.  In all the places I've been people drive as well as they do anything else - that is to say they don't know what they're doing and screw everything up.  Lubbock is no better or worse about it.

Lubbock,3b35qc,OctopussytheDestroyR,3,Fri Jun 26 12:22:05 2015 UTC,Can confirm.  A girl flipped me off after not staying in her lane at this intersection a few weeks ago.
Lubbock,3b35qc,so_futuristic,4,Fri Jun 26 14:24:41 2015 UTC,"From east to west, no one can hold their lane either. I can't tell you how many times I've almost been hit in that intersection.   Also, yield means yield. Not stop and wait until there's absolutely no one on the road."
Lubbock,3b35qc,_Nugless,2,Thu Jun 25 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"Midland is responsible for that, for some reason yield signs turn into stop and wait signs for every off ramp"
Lubbock,3b35qc,Canadian_donut_giver,3,Thu Jun 25 16:54:15 2015 UTC,There's another reason not to go to Midland. You can always tell who's from Dallas here. We will honk at you until you get your ass moving.
Lubbock,3b35qc,_Nugless,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"Crossways, divisions, on ramps, off ramps, etc; Midland drivers do not know how to intersection.  My favorites are the people turning left from under the loop underpasses.  Of te two turning lanes the guy in the right lane will cross the left lane, the double yellow, and all oncoming lanes before the intersection even starts, then they're back in the left lane, and finally they're back in the right lane.  Whoever is turning from the left lane does the same tghing but has to start from halfway under the bridge and bounce off the curb on the sidewalk to avoid the guy in the right ""lane"".  I can make a day of turning left from the left lane there.  I run the double yellow all the way out and it fucks everything up.  Like swiping your finger across a line of ants;  no one knows what to do and cars go everwhere."
Lubbock,3b35qc,makenzie71,2,Thu Jun 25 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"At least Texas uses markers to tell you how to make the turn.  When I moved to Utah, I discovered with horror that none of the multi-lane left turns have lines marked, so people just take the turn as they see fit with no regard for the fact that there's people next to you.  Wife had a Tacoma with massive lift and big tires for a while, was in the inside left turn when some dumb bint in a Corolla pulled into her by cutting her turn and leaving nowhere for my wife to go.  Fortunately, because of the big tires (she pulled into the side of the tire), the only damage was to the Corolla, and we were ruled not at fault."
Lubbock,3b35qc,midorikawa,2,Thu Jun 25 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"Two things that annoy me here:   When turning onto Marsha Sharp westbound from University to take the 4th Street exit, there's always some asshole who tries to cut onto the exit ramp at the last second despite the line of traffic trying to stay a safe distance away from each other.

Lubbock,3awe2w,Kamguh,3,Wed Jun 24 14:48:56 2015 UTC,"Did you bother to ask about Lynnwood before you moved there?  I'm just curious.  I'm also assuming you live in Lynnwood.  For anyone else's reference, Lynnwood is a great place to move into if you like be stabbed and robbed."
Lubbock,3awe2w,Rocksteady717,4,Wed Jun 24 02:59:49 2015 UTC,I always jokingly call it Lynnhood
Lubbock,3awe2w,acm2033,3,Wed Jun 24 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"Lynnwood is a funny place. I used to work in rent-to-own for several years. When I first started it was pretty much all Tech kids. I'd drive through on Saturday mornings and yards would be full of cups and cans from parties the night prior. And people were pretty great. Then almost over night it turned SUPER ghetto. I had a ton of trouble recovering merhandise there. Management would go in and take electronics from people late on rent, then they wouldn't give it back when people stopped paying for their tvs and stuff. I eventually stopped renting merch out there. I haven't worked there in like 5 years. I'm not sure if it ever changed."
Lubbock,3awe2w,Rocksteady717,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"Did that coincide with the renovation to Overton? IIRC, crime also increased a lot in the South University area after Overton started to be razed."
Lubbock,3awe2w,Rocksteady717,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:44:08 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure why it got that way. The whole Lynnwood area got pretty ghetto. Even the houses in the surrounding area got bad. I'd like to think it might change a bit now that they are building so much around that area.

They stole all my electronics and ruined my carpets stepping on bottles of artsy paints I had around. All replaceable stuff. But, yeah it sucks to come home to a wide open door and a raped house. There is still stuff I just won't buy because I'm afraid it'll just get stolen again. And I take my laptop literally everywhere now. I also write down serials for everything."
Lubbock,3awe2w,Professorchaos17,2,Wed Jun 24 04:45:35 2015 UTC,"I feel ya, this town has had over 9 armed robberies (on buisnesses alone, more if you count the home invasions) in the past 3 weeks. I live in central Lubbock 50th/Utica and it got noticeably bad around 2006/7 maybe a bit earlier.  Sorry about your hose =/"
Lubbock,3awe2w,patrick_kenzie,2,Wed Jun 24 07:39:36 2015 UTC,"That's around when McDougal was doing some massive development in the ""Tech Ghetto"" area and so quite a few ne'er-do-wells got pushed out into other areas of town so new places started getting hit."

Lubbock,3awe2w,durbblurb,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:51:38 2015 UTC,"I was robbed 3 times.    They stole my back and let my dog out. Luckily she came back the next morning. They broke down a door and busted a window. Stole everything I owned. I moved my remaining things out. They broke into the same place again (after I moved out). They got nothing.   I bought a house (now I rent it out) in Lubbock and the first thing I did was install a security alarm.  Lubbock is a small town with lots of college kids and high crime rate. Criminals will prey on the college kids since they are predictable and take predictable vacations.  Edit: not to mention, my car was broken into, my rental home was broken into (tenants forgot to set the alarm), and many of my friends were broken into. One even shot an attempted break in.  This was all over 5 years ago when I lived there. Sounds like nothing has changed."

Lubbock,3asrgc,raiderdebater15,3,Tue Jun 23 05:32:29 2015 UTC,Saigon is my go to for now. I'm excited to give this place a try.
Lubbock,3asrgc,FortunateSon101,2,Tue Jun 23 08:24:35 2015 UTC,There isn't any good pho in Lubbock right now. I'll check this place out when it opens though.  Saigon doesn't have real pho...it's made for 'murcans
Lubbock,3asrgc,unnamedcow,3,Tue Jun 23 15:34:58 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I have been eagerly anticipating the opening for months! I will be eating lunch there tomorrow!

Lubbock,3asrgc,Epinondus,2,Thu Jun 25 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"Yep. It was really good. I had pho with meatball and round steak. The broth was really delicious with no additions, but I added Sriracha, hoisin, fish sauce and veggies and it was great. Also had shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce and it was very good. There are about 10+ types of pho on the menu and other rice and noodle dishes. They also have many varieties of banh mi, making this the sole banh mi proprietor in Lubbock, to my knowledge. Mama Fu's doesn't count. My wife had a pork banh mi and said it was good.   With that said, the restaurant was very busy and service was super slow and inattentive. My wife ordered a boba tea and it never came out and she didn't have time to finish her pho before she had to go back to work. I completely understand because it's the first day, but you might want to wait a bit to let the kitchen and wait staff to get their shit together.   I will be back pho sure!"

I ordered appetizer of shrimp spring roll and my friend ordered his meal... he turned to me but then another waiter walked up and whispered in his ear. Waiter then left. 10 min later came to take our order with no recollection of previous order. 20 min pass and we get tofu spring rolls put on our table. 10 min later able to flag him down to let him know wrong order. (btw I am not one of those rude folks. I know first day so just going with flow) Little later a different guy comes to our table to take our order. Uhhhh... already placed. 15 min later waiter comes out with 2 bowls of pho. My friend didnt order pho and I didnt order meatballs. Wrong table. But he leaves the bowl in front of me. I wait a long time and then decide to chow. Good stuff. I'm almost done and my buddy still hasnt gotten his food or our shrimp spring rolls or the bahn mi roll I requested on the side. Finally waiter shows up with my friends food plus spring rolls and my soup... ""Uh. I already finished this bowl"" Got it to go!! Guy next to us walked out because never got food.  If anyone else reading this just posting how comical it was. Still gave 20%. Food was good. They will get their crap together. It was the first day."

It's like completing a puzzle that you are actually apart of. You are locked in a room for 1 hr and there are clues hidden around everywhere that help you escape. If you dont escape within an hour they let you out! I think it might be a little challenging for younger kids, but if they are maybe 14+ it would be perfect.

Lubbock,3ak9pm,fittysix,4,Sun Jun 21 00:52:20 2015 UTC,"I''l start.  25Twenty Pros: Close to TTU campus. Less than 2 minutes from Market Street and Walmart. Utilities are included (except electricity). Gym is awesome. Pool is awesome. Staff are nice. Floor plans are good. Bathroom is huge with a walk in closet (depending on floor plan). And that's about it!  25Twenty Cons: Shitty halls made of shit-stained concrete with open windows and broken fans. Rent is extremely high (750 for 2 bed/2 bat). If you get an apartment facing marsha sharp, good luck getting to sleep. Noise from marsha sharp is unbearable. It's a party apartment complex, so there's a lot of drunk college kids partying all the time. Aaaand that's about it.   Overall, it's pretty good. But I'm interested in leaving once (or if) I get this job I'm looking for which is kinda why I posted this :D"

There's a market street right by me, and it's like a 5 min drive to tech or a 5 minute walk to the bus stop.   Cons: like, no amenities. There's a coin laundry room on site, and a small dog park area and that's it. Also, it's tough getting a good parking spot after 5 cause the neighbors all work 9-5 and never go anywhere.   All in all, this is the first place I've ever rented here in town and it's been ok. No major complaints but I'd like to see if I can get better amenities for around the same price I have now.

I helped out with building the second stage of the Flats on top of my old routine of working as a leasing agent at St. Francis.  Did they fill in the pool or something?  I thought they had a pool on the north part of the lot or did that get turned into the dog park?  Used to be right here: LINK  I wonder if the red file cabinets are still in the office.

Resident events happen about 2 times a month with free stuff. Gated with a clicker and code to get in. Dog stations around the complex. Nice sized apartments with updated appliances. Washer and dryer included! Good area with plenty of stores nearby.   Cons: office staff isn't very intelligent in that they always seem to forget about things. You have to constantly remind them to get things done. Lots of communication issues at the beginning of our lease, but is getting better. Price is a bit on the higher end, but you get what you pay for.   Overall I'd recommend this for a more established person, but it's worth it.

Lubbock,3aixy3,Well_thats_cool,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"For the most part, the only furnished apartments will be the complexes that are close to campus. The majority of these are furnished and the farther you get from campus the less likely this would be true. These though from my experience tend to cost a bit more as they are charging you for your location.  Sadly with houses, most people renting out a room tend to not have an extra bed, dresser, and the like, but rather just a spare room."

Lubbock,3ac9p6,Tyvape,6,Thu Jun 18 22:52:46 2015 UTC,"Chuy's sides are all Vegan, and anything marked with a cow with a slash through it are Vegan if you omit cheese.  Mama Fu's has an actual Vegan menu if you ask for it.   Red Robin's online menu lets you organize by allergens, so you can use the Boca Vegan patty and go from there (some buns aren't Vegan, might want to look online for which are, I always go sesame).   Freebirds is my go-to - their calabacitas are amazing. Everything is Vegan except the BBQ sauce due to anchovies (by everything I mean the obvious stuff - clearly the meat/cheese isn't).  Lucky Chen on Ave Q by Walmart has a couple tasty tofu options if you're looking for dirty Chinese food, as well as spring rolls.   Check Sri Maharaja - I haven't attempted since I assume a lot of their stuff has yogurt, but would love an update on that if you go.   West Crust is good, they used to have Daiya but I don't think it generates enough interest to keep around full time. I personally prefer an insane amount of vegetables so I don't mind or miss it.   Crafthouse typically has something - and their wait staff is willing to work with you to find it if nothing sticks out.   The bean dip at Lantern is Vegan if you omit cheese and want to chill at a bar.   The Mediterranean places should be fine as long as you omit their sauces.   Pei Wei - I only go here if I want their fried spring rolls, but their options are clearly marked which is nice.   Honestly I mostly just cook - I try to buy most of my groceries from Natural Grocers. Sprouts has a better processed junk selection. Market Street is decent - they are the only place that carries the Tofutti American Cheese slices, which are cheaper than Field Roast Chao which I've only seen at Natural Grocers.   https://www.facebook.com/groups/168581737728/ Here's the Vegan in Lubbock Facebook group. Not very active unfortunately, and only about four of use show up on a regular basis when we plan things. But better than nothing, I guess.   Edit: Mediterranean sandwich (their wheat option has honey if you are against it, so get the other) at Potbelly is Vegan. Check their website for soup offerings - not sure which are okay or not."

Pita pit has to be my favorite place as of late, if you go tohttp://pitapitusa.com/build/ you can set vegan under a option bar and it will eliminate anything you can't have, they have wraps with black bean Patty, falafel, hummus, and chickipea aswell as a large amount of veggies to pile in!

Lubbock,3ac9p6,dianasparx,2,Thu Jun 18 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"If you like pita pit do yourself a favor and go to the Mediterranean cafe, or ""Lite-Bite"" on 50th and Louisville ave.  It is real mid-eastern food owned by a great Lebanese family.  I'm a vegitarian and I used to work there when I went to Tech. The dolmas, the Hummus, the Baba Ganoush are all the best I've ever had.  If you like falafel, and you like garlic, ask them to make you a falafel with the garlic spread (it looks like mayo, but it's vegan) instead of the usual spread they use. It is highly addictive.  Tabouli salad good too.  Get the ""meza plate"" and you can try it all on one plate."

There are many pits that have been dug out around Lubbock to supply the dirt needed to construct the overpasses, and these are perfect for mudding. I know of a very good one near Wolforth that is fairly large, and I guarantee no body cares about those getting torn up. In fact this one is often used as dump ground for lazy fucks who can't be bothered to go to one of the designated waste centers around here.   I appreciate your concern, but this definitely isn't something new to me. I know better than go tearing up someone's personal property just so that I can have a little fun. Hell I'd go find a construction site to mess around in before I just cruised into some random field and started thrashing around in it."

Lubbock,3a180w,booksanddogsandcats,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:54:40 2015 UTC,I would be interested. I like 1 point per every 2 receptions. I have always done a snake draft but would not be opposed to an auction. I also like doing 1/2 points. There are some other things I prefer but the Point per every 2 receptions and 1/2 points are the main things.
Lubbock,3a180w,IfIwereAsmartman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:38:38 2015 UTC,"hmmm, 1 pt/2 receptions. I'm used to .5PPR, but I haven't seen this one much. What do you think is it's advantages? Though, now that I think about it, 1/2 receptions with half points amounts to the same thing.  Honest question, I want a format/rules that makes sense and has a logical reason. So I'm totally up for discussing things."
Lubbock,3a180w,IfIwereAsmartman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:25:42 2015 UTC,For me it's all about I hate seeing a WR have 8 catches for 30 yards and still having 11 points. I also think it minimizes points for negative plays. A 1 yard loss on a reception yet you still get a point just doesn't seem right.  The reason for going with 1/2 points is I hate seeing running backs get 86 yards but you only get 8 points by adding the 1/2 point element then you can give 8.5.
Lubbock,3a180w,footd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:09:34 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I will put in on the list for discussions!

Lubbock,39umme,HumanTrophy,6,Sun Jun 14 22:41:59 2015 UTC,Stay away from Tech Terrace. Its overpriced and full of Greeks. There are a bunch of nice apts on 50th between slide and Chicago that you should look into. I think 4818 42nd is still for rent bit i don't know about price. And I find in LBB there is plenty for all to do if you're willing to look. Blue Light and Mean Woman are best for the local music scene
Lubbock,39umme,fluteitup,5,Mon Jun 15 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"Fellow former-Austinite here. Lubbock has a few comforts from home (Torchy's, Alamo Drafthouse, etc.), and besides that, it's going to depend on what your hobbies are. If you like outdoorsy stuff, there's communities for that, and great places to jog. Having some idea what you'd like to do would help us recommend things for you to do. You can check out the music scene, but only if you want to miss Austin some more.  Regarding neighborhoods: I can't give you any information on price, but good neighborhoods would generally be anything south of 50th and west of University Ave. There might be some exceptions, but that's where I'd go if I were looking for a house to rent or something. Stay away from anything with ""Raider"" in the name."

Bikes, swimming, hiking, etc. I'm a lifelong skateboarder, but outside of major cities like Austin it's hard to find good skateparks with an older scene.  Thanks again for your help.

When I was house hunting, there were a number of studio apartment type back houses available.   I also wouldn't necessarily dismiss having a roommate outright. I think you will be surprised by the number of older students you find in the engineering department especially. I'm one of them and really haven't had much trouble making friends up or down in age. I'm going to say this even though I know it won't help, but don't be afraid of making friends younger than you. I wen't through a bit of an adjustment with the age thing also. I lived in Austin before also and it sounds like you don't expect to find that out here, which is good, because you sure as hell won't.   As far as outdoor activities, Caprock Canyon and Palo Duro are great for hiking and camping. I've spent my fair share of time in Lubbock bars and then some and it's ok.  If you have any questions about the ME department or anything in general, feel free to shoot me a message.

Lubbock,39sdvw,fluteitup,3,Sun Jun 14 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"Different size airports all have their ups and downs. Ground transport is Lubbock's downside.  Bigger airports like DWF and O'Hare have great parking, direct flight and restaurant options but getting through security and getting where you need to go in the terminal takes forever.  The tiny regional airports typically don't charge for parking and security only takes a couple minutes but you can only fly to one destination at which point you'll always have to connect to get anywhere.  Lubbock is the middle ground. Security and getting around is pretty quick, there are a good selection of direct flights but it all falls apart with things like parking, shuttle service and dining options.  For me personally I love having Lubbock as my home airport just for convenience in getting in and out quickly."
Lubbock,39sdvw,Epinondus,5,Sun Jun 14 15:13:31 2015 UTC,DFW parking is at least double the price as lubbock

I couldn't find any direct flights unless I wanted to fly direct to a connecting air port like DFW.

Lubbock,39sdvw,footd,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:18:27 2015 UTC,Definitely. I think we can both agree the super small 1 destination regionals are the worst.

Lubbock,39nfvj,WTXRed,10,Sat Jun 13 00:25:17 2015 UTC,"Both were Caucasians, 5' 8"" thin and 5' 11"" fit but not muscular. It was over a girl they both like, she was also present. No one won but I would say the taller guy had the upper hand and the fight was broken up. I was telling my wife about the retired bank robber when the tall guy struck the smaller guy. The small guy tried to throw the tall guy over his shoulder. When he couldn't they both fell along with the girl while she was trying to stop them, while saying ""if you both love me you will stop this."" When they fell they hit a bumper that separates the register and tables, one of which my wife and I were sitting at. Some guys from another table pulled the tall guy off of the short guy and they just stopped fighting. The tall guy apologized to the restaurant owner and him and the girl left. The short guy kept saying he should press chargers. He also cried a little so before he left he had to go to the bathroom to collect himself. I was  sloppy and didn't think about it."
Lubbock,39nfvj,tmnt88,5,Sat Jun 13 00:40:30 2015 UTC,Honestly I wouldn't have thought to record it either..and usually fights like that are too quick to even try to record it!

I remember the first one..the second one I have no clue what happened just woke up with the biggest black eye I've ever seen and had to take all my finals with it haha I wore it though!

Was the girl thatttt attractive??  Also would you rather fight one horse-sized duck, or a hundred duck-sized horses??"
Lubbock,39nfvj,scumbagskool,5,Sat Jun 13 04:09:23 2015 UTC,"Correct, she had a standard physique but she did try to break off the fight by saying "" if both of you like me then you will quit it"". Apparently neither one of them liked her because it took a tall guy from another table to stop them. 100 duck sized horses. RIP Little Sebastian."

I mean, it's a given that people are going to want to stick with a red, white, and blue color scheme b/c it balances the State and National flag when flown up on a pole outside a building.  No offense to our neighbors to the west, but their flag stands out with that yellow field. Yeah, this guy is being a prick in his writing, and he could have been a little more professional, but according to NAVA he is right.  Now, I think that Lubbock should adopt one logo and stick with it. The weird half-circle loony tunes inspired logo is too damn busy. I think the flag should be a white field with the windmill inspired logo we see on city vehicles. That's a pretty creative design. But if they wanted something outrageous, I could suggest they could have a brown flag with the windy man wearing Buddy Holly glasses. Or better yet, the modified coiled snake flag adopted by the tea party. The snake could be wearing Buddy's glasses and under him it says ""Don't treat on me, ah-he, ah-he, ah-he-hey""."

The bad news is that you are definitely in for a downgrade in terms of places to go and things to do. The good news is that you could do a lot worse than Lubbock, and it is growing.  You should check out Alamo Drafthouse if you haven't. Pretty good way to watch a movie. In terms of coffee, there are a few good smaller places around town. Gatsby's is good. I'm still finding new places, and I've been here for two years.  Weather can be unpredictable. When it rains here, parts of town flood very easily. Just drive carefully and turn around if you have any doubt. We also get dust storms. Your car will be dirty a day after you wash it. If you haven't yet, invest in some sunglasses for when it really blows around.  The heat can get brutal, but it's not humid here. As far as winter goes, if you have to do any walking at all, invest in snowshoes. Lubbock's idea of dealing with snow and ice is dumping dirt on it and getting surprised when all it does is turn into muddy ice.  Hope this helps some."

You can get some decent Tex-Med and Mexican fusion food. Arrogant Texan has pretty solid (not mindblowing) barbecue, and it also sells some really good tacos, burritos, fajitas, etc. (the same people owned a place called Sazon which had the same things, but now they're just all in one building). Torchy's Tacos has some really neat takes on tacos.  You won't find authentic Chinese food here, but you can find some good Korean food, a few Asian markets, and even some Thai and Indian places."

It's probably my favorite coffee shop in town and has a great atmosphere for working. But there's also J&B Coffee, Yellow House Coffee, and Underground Coffee, all great local places.  The restaurants here are great! For BBQ, I would recommend The Shack. It's not a fancy place, but they make amazing food, on par with almost any I've had around Texas. There's also great Tex-Mex like Jalisco's and Chuy's. There are unique local places you should check out too, like Crafthouse Gastro Pub, Triple J's, and Mana Bread and Wine. Check out Urban Spoon for more good options.  I get where you're coming from about the local atmosphere, but I wouldn't worry too much. Everyone says it to the point that it's almost a cliche, but the people here are so friendly. Yes, it's a very conservative city, but there are plenty of more liberal minded folks as well. Just be nice and show respect, and you'll get the same in return, regardless of what you might talk about.  The theatre scene could be better, honestly. Texas Tech's theatre department puts on several good shows each year. Moonlight Musicals does a fantastic job of putting on Broadway caliber shows in the outdoor Ampitheatre, and it's almost all local people involved who would love for you to join. There's also the Lubbock Community Theatre that is open for all who want to get invovled.  Other than that, I would check out Visit Lubbock and Lubbockintheloop.com for more information, as they are both great sites. Hope you enjoy your time here!"
Lubbock,39c7pd,Kakona,5,Wed Jun 10 20:49:20 2015 UTC,I love The Shack but they recently got some competition. Check out Evie Mae's BBQ in Wolfforth. It's awesome. Here's the Texas Monthly BBQ Editor review. http://www.tmbbq.com/evie-maes-barbecue-2015/ It's expensive but good.

Other good BBQ joints in town are Eddie's at 50th & MLK (lunch only, M-F), Rudy's on South Loop 289 (a franchise, but a good one) near Slide, and Bigham's Smokehouse on 19th off Quaker and also on 82nd off Indiana (a local institution)."

South Plains fair is coming up soon.  It's dirty, gritty, and full of shifty-looking carnies, but if you're a down to earth person you can have a good time there trying the hear attack-inducing food, checking out the livestock, viewing the arts and crafts etc.  Probably more fun if you have kids because you get to live vicariously as they go on the rides"

I didn't drink much coffee when I lived there going to tech but I was in a few study sessions there when I was a part of a group.   As far as food goes, Lubbock has more restaurants per capita then any city I know of. Seriously there are a lot of restaurants. I think it's like a actual statistic or something. I worked at a hotel there for three years and would give lots of recommendations every day to incoming guests. Depending on what your pallet is of course.  Living in Austin currently and I would second Alamo draft house. (Which I believe is where draft house is originally from). They show a lot of movies that aren't typically shown in your generic theater. But for live theater, you might be stuck with whatever the university produces. I wouldn't know much about that since I never went to live theater in the 6 years that I lived there."

Lubbock,39c7pd,CodemanVash,4,Wed Jun 10 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"AroundAboutThere is spot on. If you're discreet, you can get away with smoking pot. I've got a lot of friends who do in Lubbock (I'm a former resident, but I'm a fan myself.) The problem is tracking someone down if you don't have an in-road for it.   Prices and quality can vary a lot, and there can be some dry spells, but as of a couple years ago, eights were going for $60 and ounces in the $400 range. I definitely have made better deals, but I'd expect to pay at least those prices considering you'll be working from scratch. You'll probably have the best luck finding a hookup through meeting people at Tech, though I'd highly advise avoiding a dealer who actually lives on campus.   I wouldn't count on finding any wax or oil, and if you do it's bound to be locally sourced and made with butane, which I'd avoid. Same with edibles. Don't bank on getting away with it in public, there are definitely some bible-thumpers that will call the police at the first sign, though most people are somewhere in the middle and aren't going to mess with you if you aren't in their face about it. There are also plenty or people very 420 friendly, but you'll have to find them first! At any rate, you could be in a worse spot for it. Don't carry more than an oz at a time. That's a cutoff point in Texas where you're going to face a stricter penalty if you're caught with anything over.  That's all I can think of atm. Hopefully you don't mind the wall-o-text."
Lubbock,39c7pd,CodemanVash,2,Thu Jun 11 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"It's a college town, lots of pot smoking college kids, and plenty of non college smokers. You won't have any trouble finding a source. That doesn't mean you can walk down main street with a doobie though. In my experience, anyone under the age of 30 didn't care, just keep your wits about."
Lubbock,39c7pd,Kakona,2,Thu Jun 11 00:12:54 2015 UTC,It's not likely to be something that is blatant or obvious depending on what kind of crowd you hang out with. You might want to stop off in OR or CO on your way down here to stock up and it would be advisable to keep it at home and low key.
Lubbock,39c7pd,leighalan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:35:21 2015 UTC,"You can still get taken to jail in Texas if you're caught with pot, especially if it's a sheriff/state trooper. That being said, the hardest thing for you will be finding a hookup. Worst case scenario, Lubbock is only 5 hours from Trinidad, Colorado, which has a great pot shop right off the highway, with pretty cheap and extremely high quality product. I'd probably recommend just taking a trip up there every few months, buy the max and drive careful back to LBK."

As far as coffee is concerned, both Gatsby's and Yellowhouse pull good shots. We have a pretty good selection of restaurants. If you like Indian food, then Maharaja's is pretty good. Their lunch buffet on weekends is worth the trip. We have excellent Tex-Mex and some decently authentic Mexican food. BBQ can be hit or miss though. If you're down for some good pizza, then West Crust and Capital Pizza shouldn't be missed. If you have any other food questions, I'll do my best to answer them in a PM.  I find that the atmosphere in town fully depends on who you spend your time around. I wouldn't worry about sounding like and asshole, because it's been my experience that no one else does.  I'm not too in tune with the local theatre scene, I do know that we have a couple of community theatres and we also have the Lubbock Moonlight Musicals in McKenzie Park every summer. I believe they're currently running Mary Poppins. As far as the arts are concerned in general though, it's fairly vibrant. Between the First Friday Art Trail and local shows you should be able to find something up your alley.  Like most have said on here, the weather truly is a force to be reckoned with. It can be quite beautiful though. Watching a huge thunderstorm build up and blow in can be an awe-inspiring sight, and we have some breathtaking sunsets.   If you're into hiking and other outdoor activities, then you're within a short drive of some great places such as Palo Duro canyon. If you like movies, then I recommend Alamo Drafthouse. It's a really great movie theatre, and a lot of fun. They host a trivia night on Tuesday's and Thursday's that is a blast. If you have any other questions at all, then feel free to hit me up."

Lubbock,39c7pd,o_g,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:32:17 2015 UTC,"I take it you have no kids.  So, the advantages of SW Lubbock, with newer, bigger homes and better schools, may not be that important to you. The town is laid out in a grid, A-B-C streets running north-south, 1-2-3 streets running east-west, with major thoroughfares (University, Indiana, Quaker, Slide/4th, 19th, 34th, 50th, 82nd) every mile or so. Tech Terrace is between Indiana and Quaker, 19th and 34th. It's an older neighborhood near TTU and it has a wide variety of options. It also has a couple of nice parks and a cool little neighborhood shopping center at 26th & Boston that's pretty unique in town, J&B Coffee is located there. Without a doubt the coolest, most ""urban"" neighborhood in town. I'd look there first.  East of University can be sketchy, with a lots of absentee owners, but there are nice places there so don't dismiss them.  Overall, I bet you'd be happier inside the loop."
Lubbock,39c7pd,Hooblah2u2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:16:55 2015 UTC,"Based on what I can glean from your personality (based on other comments), you should aim for Tech Terrace. This neighborhood is bordered by Indiana, University, 50th, and 19th. (Technically the official neighborhood is smaller, but this area shares a similar culture.) It feels the most like Austin, and I would assume, Seattle. Many graduate students and younger professors live in this area. Discrete pot use will not be a problem, but parties can sometimes get loud. Southwest Lubbock is more upper middle class, conservative, largely white. Nothing wrong with that, but it seems like Tech Terrace is more what you're looking for. And definitely check out First Friday Art Trail. And Palo Duro Canyon (1.5 hrs north) is a great day trip."

There is a pretty good selection, even when not including Ooh La Lattees, coffee from girls in lingerie.   There's more restaurants than you can imagine in a town this size. I've heard before that Lubbock has the most restaurants per capita. Yet, when me and my boyfriend (both 20), were searching for a place to eat for our anniversary, there was not a single place we had to rule out for being to expensive. We also both work for Caprock/Orlando's, the best local restaurants hands down.   Lots of grocery stores as well. Corner markets to Walmarts and Targets.   A large theater company is putting on Shrek right now, it looks pretty good. I know some friends who take part in acting as well, but I don't know too much about it. They have a lot of fun though.  This place has a great sense of community. You do have to buy into the Tech love. It is easy, though, it is a great school. Advanced beyond what you would expect.   The National Ranching Heritage Museum, the Lubbock Lake Landmark, and prairie dog town are things you won't find elsewhere. For perspective, I've lived in Mississippi, Houston and England. I wouldn't stay here permanently, but I'm glad college brought me here and I'll probably be attending grad school here as well."

Specs is good for exotic liquor and beer. Market Street has a reasonable selection of beer for a grocery store.  Asian Market on 34th St. near Memphis is the bees knees for everything Thai and far east. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is STUFFED with all manner of spices, veg, meat and accoutrements I haven't found anywhere else."
Lubbock,39c7pd,bugdog,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"The local Market Streets will likely give you access to the ingredients you require, and Sprouts and Natural Grocers will fill in the gaps.  Not sure if y'all drink firewater, but our liquor store situation is odd - beer & wine are all over (grocery stores, convenience stores) but hard liquor is available only from liquor stores.  Spec's is the best - on Slide just outside the South Loop.  Alcohol sales are cut off at 9 every day, and beer & wine only on Sundays.  We have one microbrewery/brewpub in town - Triple J Chophouse & Brewery, and it is excellent, IMO."
Lubbock,39c7pd,AroundAboutThere,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"I can speak to the theatre community - I was on the board of directors for Lubbock Community Theatre for the past 3 years and I only just resigned recently due to time restraints and family obligations.   There are several theatre groups here in addition to Texas Tech (which also has a terrific program) and most of them put on really good shows. I am partial to Lubbock Community Theatre as I have served on the board and have known the artistic director and his wife for 25 years. It's a very arts friendly group. They host and compete in regional theatre festivals and generally have a presence at local arts festivals and expos. LCT does 5 regular shows per season - 3 weekends per show (9 total performances each), along with a kid's program in the summer, a Christmas/Holiday themed show in December, and a Cabaret/Musical review fundraiser in August for a total of about 55 performances a year. Here is a link - http://lubbockcommunitytheatre.org/  - next seasons' shows have already been announced and are posted on the front page.  Casting and auditions for the first show of the regular season should begin in August.  It's a very community oriented group and easy to get involved with. They are always looking for fresh talent for the next production and it's not always just the same group of actors monopolizing the stage season after season. If anything, I'd say there is more theatre going on here than there is demand for it since most of the different theatre groups have a hard time selling all their seats and compete pretty hard for audiences even though we all put on really good shows. The problem? It's probably that Lubbock, as a whole, is just not very cultured and the vast majority of people here would rather get drunk on Friday and Saturday night and/or go to church on Sunday morning than come out to support the arts, HOWEVER, the people here that support theatre and the arts are a very supportive and passionate group and you and your wife should have no problem fitting in here - a good chunk of the talent in Lubbock is imported.  In addition to LCT there is C.A.T.S. Theatre, Moonlight Musicals, The Cactus Theatre, Hub Theatre Group, and Flatlands Dance Theatre. There are also several college productions every year at Texas Tech and South Plains College. Lastly, Civic Lubbock hosts the Broadway Series, which are traveling Broadway shows, and brings 4 or 5 Broadway musicals every year - they do shows like Spamalot, Miss Saigon, Beauty and the Beast, Young Frankenstein, etc. You won't participate in them but they are fun to go see.  You can find lots of info online about all of these groups, just Google them and good luck!"

Lubbock,397atj,makenzie71,3,Tue Jun 9 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"This is my comment from a post over two years ago but, it is still relevant to your interests i think.    i found this place my freshman year. there are maybe 8 hill climbs of varying difficulty. not very far away either.  33.601779,-101.848572  put this into google, click the map, and click the satellite images layer  you can access it by driving down ave Q and youll see it to your right. In the sat images you can clearly see all the trails around the area. as far as i know, its public land. and a fair amount of ppl go out here,, but dont take my word on the legality of being there. but i think is a ""park"" cuz there are signs and trash cans around the place. Go explore all around this place. its pretty cool. it is not uncommon to see other trucks and people doing stuff down there.   Also, ive found some old trails here  33.601985,-101.826138 down towards hw82  right along the edge of meadowbrook golf course. some old abandoned structures and trails that are cool to explore.  use the Sat images to recon the areas before you go. thats how i found these trails was exploring google earth of the lubbock area. thre are several other random trails around the east lubbock area that you can find and explore , usually leading to old abandoned places. pretty cool if your into that.   Here is the original post if you are interested in checking out the discussion.  Minibuggies sound like a blast, have fun!"

Lubbock,38pon2,sly_d,5,Fri Jun 5 21:24:24 2015 UTC,"You can probably find any other story about a suspect pulling a gun or doing jsut about anything and the police are tripping over each other to comment on the case. But when it's the mayor:   No context of why the gun was pulled will be released until the investigation is complete and turned over to the D.A.’s office, he said, and the investigation could be quick or take a while.   Gotta love the finite certainty of how long it will take also. ""Falls somewhere between quick and a while""."

Lubbock,38pon2,drgalaxy,2,Mon Jun 8 14:08:35 2015 UTC,"It was the county's district attorney who requested the investigation be handed to the Rangers, possibly to avoid a perception of impropriety.  If the investigation results in charges, the case could also be handed to a special prosecutor from another district for the same reason. Similar to how a special prosecutor is handling the sexual assault charge the city's former attorney is facing."

It can be pricey if you don't do the homework as far as sourcing it,  but it is very light,  surprisingly strong, easy to mold/correct,  and can be sanded, painted and even drilled for mounting hardware. Molding can be as simple as pouring hot water over it and free forming by hand. Think PVC plumbing pipe,  but lighter and in sheet form.  I have a couple 8.5x11 sheets lying around some place.

Lubbock,371vwh,_WarShrike_,19,Tue May 26 05:14:32 2015 UTC,"It may be an inconvenience but it is still much needed. We don't have rivers and lakes to support us; we get all our water from an aquifer that is quickly running out of water.   The lakes in the area are all drying up. That means no water for small towns like Post or Spur who don't have access to the same aquifer we do in Lubbock.   Even many of the playa lakes around Lubbock were really low recently.   All this rain, while annoying to us, helps us so much to continue living in this area."

Lubbock,36x2vv,mishkap,7,Fri May 22 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"I bank at Alliance FCU. They've been very good to me. The only problem I've had while banking with them for the last 5 or so years is that I tried to make an online purchase in a different currency (I can't remember which one, but I think it was a smaller European currency) and they automatically denied it. Apparently, this currency is so commonly used in fraudulent cases, Alliance no longer allows transactions that include this currency.  When I once had Newegg triple-charge me on a purchase, leading into three charges in excess of $500 total, Alliance walked me through how charges clear their system, how Newegg's system will most likely not follow through with the charges that I cancelled on their website, how any charges that aren't followed up by Newegg will automatically drop from my ""Pending Charges"" list on my Alliance account, and informed me of when I should next contact Alliance when I see that the charges are not being dropped. Eventually, all the charges except the one I wanted were dropped, and everything cleared itself up.  The lines at the credit unions are almost always short or empty, the tellers are very friendly and clearly know what they're doing, and there are 7 different locations all around town.  Wow, this sounds like a paid advertisement. So here's a list of downsides to Alliance:   It is not possible to deposit a check through an ATM. No mobile banking app yet. Their website does say they're developing one, though."
Lubbock,36x2vv,shaggy713,3,Fri May 22 21:52:16 2015 UTC,"I currently bank with first convenience, yes the awful Walmart bank.   I don't think I've ever felt like they weren't fucking me.   What are some benefits of a credit union opposed to a regular bank?"
Lubbock,36x2vv,ub3rr4v3,2,Sat May 23 00:56:55 2015 UTC,"Credit Unions are non-profits owned by the members themselves. For example, every year or so I receive a letter in the mail about where this year's meeting will be for my credit union. I can show up, hear up-to-date information about my credit union, give complaints or suggestions, etc., as if I were a stockholder at a stockholder meeting. In addition, credit unions are generally much, much smaller than banks. They have fewer employees and fewer members, and thus tend to be more focused on customer service. Again, it is in the credit union's interest to be good to the members, because the members more-or-less own the credit union. In addition, fewer members means it's important to focus on customer retention to keep the credit union thriving. All of the membership information aside, credit unions usually have better rates than banks.  I did my best to find a website that gives a good overview of the differences between banks and credit unions, without being painfully biased towards either: http://banking.about.com/od/creditunions/a/bank-vs-creditunion.htm"
Lubbock,36x2vv,shaggy713,2,Sat May 23 01:39:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I may look into a credit union actually.

Lubbock,36x2vv,OctopussytheDestroyR,1 point,Fri May 22 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"The only thing I dislike about Alliance is the lack of a mobile app. I understand that funding app development can be expensive, and apps take time to develop, but there I can't think of a good excuse for why Alliance lacks a mobile app when a large amount of other banks and credit unions already have one. The addition of a mobile app should appeal to the younger generations that prefer to do things on their phone/on-the-go as opposed to going to a brick-and-mortar location. It also makes the bank more accessible, and would easily provide marketing of other Alliance services to those who are already members. Services such as vehicle loans, CDs, house loans, whatever, can be displayed within the app. As far as I know, the only place these services are advertised are within the Alliance credit union buildings themselves.  Outside of that complaint, I find that I remember names like PlainsCapital Bank, CitiBank, BofA, and other competitors simply because they have a tendency to provide funding for local events or buildings. Of course, I'm not sure Alliance has the funding for this kind of thing, but the fact remains that having your name hanging from a banner at a local event or cemented onto the wall of a public building (event centers, for example), makes it almost impossible to forget. Maybe look into the feasibility of providing funding for events like Relay For Life, First Friday Art Trail, or other big name events."

Lubbock,36hzvu,metta_world_peace,1 point,Wed May 20 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"North of Lubbock, but I'll be in the Amarillo area most of the week. Usually try to catch a movie and a beer or three in Lubbock on the weekends. Austin and Temple all next week.  Didn't know if you lived in Lubbock. If you were around there, I thought I'd just drop them off somewhere.  You'll probably want to run any LPG cylinders you use to a refiller or cylinder handler to break the valves loose, then spray them down with water before filling them. Even on an unpurged 'empty' cylinder, static discharge can cost arms and eyes."

Lubbock,3681r9,fittysix,16,Sun May 17 01:49:04 2015 UTC,"Not being as condescending as this sounds, but... have you considered getting a job?  Edit: that aside, it's hard for me to suggest things because I'm a homebody and I mostly play games and watch YouTube and Netflix with what little free time I have.  Other suggestions:   take a cooking class.  It's always helpful to know how to cook. take up a hobby like gardening or something that takes you outdoors if you're the outdoors type.  I've taken up learning about bugs, but you could learn about literally anything like plants, reptiles, birds... visit the mall every now and then.  The sights and sounds are sometimes nice - plus air conditioning. attend some of the many music venues, arts shows, etc.  There's always something going on."
Lubbock,3681r9,Rustnrot,9,Sun May 17 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"Gonna second the music venues, arts shows, etc. First Friday Art Trail is very fun, especially with a group of friends. The music scene in Lubbock is one of the hidden gems of the city, in my opinion. Country bands play at Wild West very often, rock and alternative plays over at Jake's Backroom, Lubbock Symphony plays at the civic center. Find a website to keep track of bands coming to Lubbock and you won't be bored. Bands that call  Lubbock ""home"" that I know of are Johnny Handgun (a ska band) and Alternative Unknown, both of whom I highly recommend going to see.   Find a group of friends and join a bar quiz group. Every week on a certain day, you go to the bar and drink, eat, and pretend you're smart. I know that Fox and Hound have one on Mondays, and Lantern Tavern has one on some night, and I think Gaslight and Alamo Drafthouse has one as well.   Speaking of, go see a movie at Alamo Drafthouse. It's $5/ticket on Monday through Thursday for any movie playing at 10pm or later. My girlfriend thinks it's every night, but I think it's only Monday through Thursday. Give them a call to make sure. It's worth it to see a movie with no annoying interruptions like cell phones or loud people, plus the food is good if you want to eat while watching the movie.  There is plenty to do in Lubbock, but it is very true that you kind of have to look for it to find it. Keep an eye on EverythingLubbock.com, LubbockInTheLoop.com, and LiveLoveLubbock.org. These website will show you what shows are playing, give you an overview of entertainment in Lubbock and coming to the city, and what restaurants or shops are opening in the city soon."
Lubbock,3681r9,shaggy713_phone,3,Sun May 17 02:34:21 2015 UTC,"As a regular at the Alamo Drafthouse quiz, there are always teams looking for an extra team member.  Just go and ask the quiz master if anybody needs players.  They are really cool dudes.  Oh I am one of them."

Sun adventure has a deal on discs for 15% off and buy 2 get 1 free every sunday! So you could pick a mid and a putter and get the driver and you're set!

Go work out or rock climb at the tech rec center, disc golf like someone else suggested, go golfing (e.g. go get hammered on the golf course with a few friends and drive the golf cart and maybe hit some balls)  Video games, video games! , PC games, build a PC, get a little multicopter from a hobby shop and fly it around.   Chimy's patio always seemed to keep us busy. Also going up to the Roof bar by the stadium and watching the sun set while drinking was always fun.   Edit: Also like someone said, get a jon.

Working in a call center is not a career - just something you are temporarily doing until you get downsized or you snap.  I'm finally quitting the call center industry the latter part of this year.

While it is a job that is almost monotonous and easy to get through on a daily basis, it is mind-numbingly boring, you absolutely cannot talk at all unless announcing a call to a hearing person, and management doesn't give half a crap about you. Rumor had it that management denied a coworker when she asked off for her honeymoon. However, it was painfully easy, and there was about 3 weeks of paid training prior to the job, so you don't go in blind.  EDIT: My girlfriend said that her friend worked for NTS in their call center, and she said that she liked it. So I guess it might be a good possibility for work."

I'm on the escalation team so when a caller requests a manager (which is all the fucking time) they get me. 99% of the time it's because they didn't pay their bill and want everything back on for free.

Their phone tech support and internet tech support were separate, but they were talking about combining them when I left, so you may have to deal with answering calls about anything from no dial tone to can't connect to the internet to an incorrectly programmed remote for their tv.    The environment was nice, most clients weren't bad to deal with, the pay was a bit low for call center work, the phone wasn't constantly ringing, and they provided health/dental/vision.  Everyone I know has since left, so I can't provide any up to date information.  Hopefully this helps."

Lubbock,35nkic,fittysix,6,Tue May 12 04:14:49 2015 UTC,I don't smoke but I whole heartedly believe that these bills should pass.  Criminalizing something that is no worse than alcohol costs taxpayers WAAAAAAY more than it should.
Lubbock,35nkic,triplesecman,-10,Tue May 12 12:32:36 2015 UTC,"The difference between pot and alcohol is you can get contact high from pot. Therefore, your actions can affect other people without their permission. As long as its contained I don't care"

Please think before you try to compare alcohol to marijuana, because only one of those two things causes an average of 88,000 deaths per year."

Lubbock,35nkic,BinaryMagick,4,Tue May 12 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"Much like smoking bans, I don't really care either way since I don't smoke. But, I really thought Texas would be the 48th state to even consider legalizing pot. Maybe it'll get legalized and calm people down a bit."
Lubbock,35nkic,Rocksteady717,4,Tue May 12 12:10:21 2015 UTC,"Through its history, Texas has taken the stance -- at least outwardly -- of allowing personal freedoms and independence at every turn. From the establishment of the Republic to Gov. Perry's recent hollow threat of secession, we talk a very big game about not needing anyone to tell us how to conduct our affairs.  I would think we are the first state in line to tell the federal government they can't tell us what we can do in our own homes, but since this issue is specifically about 'taking the evil pot weed' in our own homes, we tend to clutch our pearls and feign outrage. Then, 48th in line sounds more like it.   I am pleasantly surprised to see our representatives walking the walk."
Lubbock,35nkic,BinaryMagick,6,Tue May 12 16:08:57 2015 UTC,"I've been following on the other sub-reddit and have done my part by contacting my representatives and politely voicing my support for the legalization of recreational and medicinal cannabis. It only takes about 15 minutes to contact them all and can be easily done during a lunch break. I didn't get any hang-ups or anyone telling me I was wasting my time. Everyone has been polite and courteous.  As it was mentioned elsewhere, don't think ""someone else will do it"", that's why we have so many politicians who are embarrassing Texas by doing things like ruining our school systems, stripping the renewable energy programs, banning us from filming police activities, making a fuss over military training maneuvers, and now (in a way) telling us that they would rather us spend our money in Colorado instead of investing it back into our state through cannabis taxation. We all know that there are a TON of people in this part of the state who smoke and who probably don't care about voting. Let them know that if they want to live a life without persecution for their favorite past time, and better access to better quality grass, then they need to get up and do something."

I just want to point out that HB 2165 and HB 507 have NOT been scheduled for the house floor as I'm typing this.  They have been sent to the Calendar Committee which will decide if these bills should be scheduled for the House floor or not.  That's why it's important to call!  Let Texas representatives know that you want these bills to be debated in House!  The deadline for anything to be scheduled for the House floor is tomorrow at midnight!  This is a list of all voting representatives and their stances so far.  UPDATE 2: HB 507 has died as well.  Keep the fight up by creating a Lubbock NORML chapter!  I'm just glad people are talking about marijuana reform and this is still a HUGE step for Texas!  UPDATE: Sad news, guys. Apparently I misunderstood and the deadline for HB 2165 was last night. It has failed to be scheduled and will have to be refiled next year.  Keep calling for HB 507 though, it's not dead yet!

HB2165 seeks to repeal past legislation. This is an attempt to Legalize It - if you will.  HB507 seeks to drastically reduce penalties for posession under an ounce. This decriminalizes the act. Meaning you would likely receive a ticket and be sent on your way as if you had been driving with a broken taillight.   Only HB2165 makes it even remotely possible for ""a lot of revenue for the state"" to come in through legal sales.  ELI5: These bills have been approved by committee for discussion by the house, meaning our group finally wrote the final draft of its term paper and nothing more. The next step is to show it to the teacher(s), who may very well refuse to read it, dismiss it and toss it on a giant pile, or just put a big fat 'F' on it.

Lubbock,35lyi1,BinaryMagick,3,Mon May 11 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"Certainly! Its actually a combination of things. First and foremost is the environment and this is my little way of saving some water and some pollution. I'm also getting really passionate about DIYing things and reusing ""garbage"". Second, and this is kinda dumb, but I'm hoping if I manage to stay out of all the carbs in the world that it will get me a little more svelte. Third, and I kinda feel bad this is thrid, is they way factory farms treat animals. I'm not against family farms and ethically raised meat at all. Honestly, I think I was born to be a vegan, as Isince I was wee I never really cared for most meat and eggs and milk gives me anxiety (im always convinced its rotten). tl;dr: all of the reasons ;)"

I'm not one of those huge advocates against vegans or for eating meat, though I have taken some nutrition classes and meat science classes.  I do want you to know, there isn't anything unhealthy about eating meat (whether it be organic or conventional, the nutrients are the exact same) as long as you are eating the correct portions.  Also, people in the meat industry are disgusted by the way some factory farms have treated animals, mostly swine.  I recently took a class and they admit that it does happen and that they hope those factories are shut down and people charged heavily with crime.  I have friends who are meat scientist and they stress the most humane methods possible.  In fact, it even highly affects meat quality.  Also FYI, your diet can be absent of meat and be healthy, so no complaints or judgement from me!  I hope you have a great experience with it!"

I was pleased with the service, so when it broke again last year, I took it back there.  Big mistake.  I dropped it off in early May.  I called about it every few days, because we were moving to another town in June.  Same answer every time, ""I don't know the status of repairs.  My technician works offsite.  I'll have him call you.""  I never heard from a technician.  When I asked the man on the phone if it seemed like a poor way to do business for the person in contact with the public to have absolutely no idea what was happening in his own store, he got defensive and angry.  This went on for over three months.  THREE MONTHS to fix an iPod screen.  Finally, at the beginning of August, I told him that if I didn't get it back, I was going to contact the police and the BBB.  That finally got the technician to call me back, but he told me that he had no idea where the iPod was.  They offered to send us a different, refurbished iPod in its place, which we agreed to.  It arrived a week later.  The one we left with them in May was 16 GB.  The one they mailed to us is 8 GB.  These guys are incompetent liars and crooks.  Do not take your devices to them."

I came back initially for some family reasons, but decided to stick around.  Lubbock has most of the amenities of the larger cities without the insane traffic.  I like that.  Most of the complaints of ""we don't have __________"" tend to be about some ridiculous things such as massive amusement park, Macy's, etc.  those don't really have any impact on my quality of life.  The cost of living is really nice as well.  I make a really good living here that might not go near as far as some other areas in the state or nation.   I won't be a complete homer though.  I dislike the uber-""conservative"" bible thumping.  I don't care if someone believes different than me, but I take issue when that belief is used to discriminate or act hateful towards others.  I have gay family and friends that won't come to Lubbock unless they have to due to their treatment in public settings."

It seemed like every recreational opportunity in Lubbock involved drinking/going to bars or was just incredibly lame."
Lubbock,35ckn3,KodiakAnorak,5,Sat May 9 10:22:51 2015 UTC,"Lots of stuff to do. Several music venues, game stores (I'm going to the Amarillo comic convention today), a ridiculous number of sports or shooting clubs, philanthropic lodges, a big school with super cheap sport tickets basically all year round, just off the top of my head. This is a pretty big town, just gotta find your niche. What things in other cities are you specifically missing in Lubbock? I've noticed that a lot of people here ('re: students) have a hard time seeing past the bar scene."
Lubbock,35ckn3,Iron-Fist,-8,Sat May 9 13:03:20 2015 UTC,Wooooow. Wow. There are definitely not any fucking good music venues in town. I'll throw in my two cents about the town whenever I work off this hang over. But I have never been to a more musically dry town in my life. We have the Dry Heaves which fucking rock. And then a lot of country music. And that is all. If country music isn't your thing you are boned. Abilene which is less than half the size of Lubbock has (or had) a much better music scene. There is effectively no music scene here.
Lubbock,35ckn3,I_Am_A_Snake,13,Sat May 9 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, having been involved in the Lubbock music scene, you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Jake's has rock, metal, and alternative shows going constantly. There are rock, country, metal and alternative shows out at Lone Star Amphitheater all the time.   I mean, Buffalo Wild Wings has live music, for God's sake.   Yeah, maybe the EDM scene isn't great, but there's a festival out at Buffalo Springs every year with great EDM, electronica, techno, and indie shows.   We get big names in rock, ska, and indie come through all the time. Reel Big Fish was at Jake's last year. Lucero came to town a couple of times, and the rock festivals KFMX puts on are usually headlined by huge acts.   Lubbock prides itself on its musical history and legacy and it hasn't let up. You can't pretend like the music scene is dead just because you might not like it."
Lubbock,35ckn3,BrianAllred,3,Sat May 9 17:06:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that Lubbock's local music scene is actually pretty good and there are some talented musicians playing each week, but the indie scene just isn't good. Yeah, it's great to see Reel Big Fish and Of Montreal come through, but Reel Big Fish's hayday was the late 90's and while Of Montreal always puts on a good show, they're also on their decline.   The only up and comer that I've seen since moving here in August was last week when I saw Parker Millsap play at the Cactus (great show, by the way)  I'm not saying it's Lubbock's fault. Honestly, geography plays a much larger part of Lubbock not getting these bands as most anyting else. The up and coming bands are going to want to play Austin and then head north through Dallas/Oklahoma City and either head through KC or over to Denver. There's not many bands running the Austin -> Lubbock -> Albuquerque route."

I discovered Phlipp Coggins and Leopold and his Fiction here a few months ago. Every Time I Die came here recently; I heard that show was great.

Like a chihuahua that's been fed way, way too much.  I really like property costs here, the complete lack of traffic, and the fact that the ENTIRE city is accessible within 15 minutes.  I like that I can take my buggy out and tote the neighborhood kids around the block a few times and no one calls the cops.  I know not all neighborhoods in Lubbock are like this, but I like that when I cookout a lot of the people on my block all contribute.  That being said, there are quite a few things I do not like about Lubbock.  I wish there were more family-friendly things do go do.  In general I wish there were more things to do in general...there's a lot for a visitor, but if you live here it gets pretty tedious.  And...oh my god...the people.

I didn't always dislike living here. But, honestly, the people and the boredom are what I can't stand anymore. And by people, I mean the very conservative, uber religious, ""if you don't love Jesus, you are against Christians"" kind of people. The kind that will be awesome with you because they assume that you are a Christian just like them, but the moment they find out otherwise, they treat you like shit.   I know that not all Lubbockites are like those people, but I've lived in Lubbock for more than 15 years and there are enough of them that I now can't wait to leave.   The boredom is another thing. Unless you want to eat, drink, go to church or shop, there's not much to do here. And mostly, I'm thinking inexpensive activities I can do with my kids. They've been to the science spectrum and the Heritage center so many times that they are bored with it.

All of that on top of land and labor being super cheap out here, everyone can have a yard and set up the bbq and slip n slide for family and friends to come hang out.  This isn't a major metropolitan area, but there are a lot of things to do when you look a little farther."

Lubbock,35ckn3,thezep,3,Sat May 9 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"""Lubbock or Leave It"" - That's the saying around here, and it is why I'll be leaving as soon as I can. This is my opinion, but let me reaffirm why.  The ""Lubbock or Leave It"" argument is toxic, because it ignores the importance of a city's ability to attract (and keep) talented youth that help the industry. If talented individuals actually wanted to come here, instead of say, Austin, Lubbock could be so much better. It could actually have a technology industry, support more musical diversity, or actually be attractive enough to recruit a winning football team. The ""Lubbock is pretty if you look hard enough"" argument is bullshit - potential students and workers only spend a limited amount of time here, and first impressions are vital to retaining them.  Instead, the city does little to help Lubbock's city life. For example, some brag about the big stars that visit the USA, but in truth the city actually voted against spending money to build the arena. Hell, if McDougal hadn't have come in with his private investments, the Tech Ghetto would probably still exist and the Overton Hotel wouldn't.   McDougal is planning on downtown renovation, and I really hope it goes through. Some downtown life would certainly bring some life into this city. The commercial industry has instead moved southwest, an area inhospitable to the pedestrian lifestyle that could make Lubbock attractive.  Meanwhile, the city can definitely make a difference in making Lubbock more livable. Improved public transportation, reinvestment in downtown living, or an actual conversation on the high crime rates could truly help the city.  Until then, the city will continue to remain boring. Lubbock citizens will still argue if Lubbock sucks, college students will leave for more lively cities, and the expansion of chain restaurants and tacky shopping malls will continue on into the Texas sunset."
Lubbock,35ckn3,skazombie,3,Sat May 9 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"agreed, Lubbock is way behind other cities on revitalizing downtown and have lots of catchup to play."
Lubbock,35ckn3,windfarmtx,2,Sat May 9 22:00:06 2015 UTC,The issue with public transportation would be one of my biggest complaints.  Sadly outside of the largest cities in the U.S. This tends to be an issue.

Moved her with my family last August, so I'll try and give a view from an outsider who's still getting his feet wet. I'll say now that I like Lubbock, but don't love it.  Pros: Nice people, cheap housing, extremely cheap daycare, easy to get around the city. Surprising theatre scene and a good number of classical music options (or so I've been told), craft beer options are getting better.  Cons: Bad drivers, lack of web presence for many places makes it hard for new people to find places, very limited public transportation, only bike on the roads if you want to take your life into your own hands, antiquated recycling program that only seems to be going backwards, no smoking ban in bars.  Really, it just has the feeling of a city that's about a decade behind a lot of places around the country.

In fact, there is hardly any air traffic around here. If there is gridlock it's due to an accident and it's cleared away pretty fast.  Restaurant choices. Believe me, even for a small city there is a lot to choose from (personally, I try to stick with family owned than chain). I can't see how so many Mexican food places can stay in business. It's like all all of cowboy art I see displayed everywhere; I figured people would tire of it soon and fast.   Crime. Well, I don't like crime, but if a crime is reported on the news, 9 out of 10 times the person who committed it is usually caught within a week or so. Makes you wonder why people even commit crimes around here at that rate. I know there's more crime that what gets reported on the news, I'm just saying.  Charities. Never have I seen so many homes burn/people killed/or kid with cancer on the news followed by a fund set up in someone's name. In a larger city, you are on your own. There is a flip-side mentioned below to the charitable hearts in this town.  HATE: The people. Well specific ones, we all know the uber-conservative-narrow-minded-black-hearted-wish-it-was-still-the-1950's-holy-rollers. Wait, black hearted? Yep! Notice how not a majority of them has done anything to help with the homeless problem? With enough churches in this town you would think this wouldn't be an issue. I know what Jesus would do; I guess they expect him to take care of the problem for them. I can't stand how they think that this part of Texas ""is God's country"". They must know a different God, because this land is almost barren like Isaac's wife, Rebekah. Word of advice to them, if you think it's against the teaching of your lord, let him (or her) handle it. You enjoy the little time we have on this planet with your friends and family and get your nose out of everyone's business. And if you're a christian business owner and take issue with gays/pagans/democrats/etc., you should remember that money is green, no matter what type of hand it came from.  Drivers, come on you morons. Red means STOP! Not ""Okay you last three idiots can pass through before that Honda and the line of cars behind him jumps out in your way"". I have driven a few rigs in the DFW area all the away to Houston, and while those drivers are bad, it's mainly due to too many people on the road. People out here just blatantly run red lights and stop signs. The last time I looked, this part of Texas wasn't obstructed with trees, so how is it people miss stop signs out in these farm roads. Also, am I the only one who remembers the ""Move over Lubbock"" campaign? Apparently no one who drives the loop does.  Weather. Yes, Texas weather is sometimes unpredictable, but West Texas weather sucks. We get Summer and winter with a week or two for spring and fall. Honestly, to me, it feels more like summer and spring most of the time out here. I love being outdoors, but not when it's over 85 and that happens more often than it should. I can handle the wind and dust storms, it's a given it's going to happen since we are on the edge of the desert, but the lack of cooler months sucks. Thankfully this past summer was tolerable. I hate how the news casters get all giddy when a ""heat wave"" comes through before easter then when we actually have temps in the 90's and 100's they rub in how ""much nicer it is than winter"". Eff them.   Which brings me to local television. Holy crap, half of the news casters (and along with half of the populous), pronounce simple town names. Slaton has a ""T"" in it, it's not pronounced ""Slay'un"". Local commercials are a joke. Don't get me wrong, I am all for local businesses getting their name out and I'm happy to see more of them than corporate commercials. But crap-in-a-hat there are so many BAD commercials out here I almost don't want to support them. The actors are bad, like that monotone gal for the message place, or the voice over guy who does the Momma Foo's commercials (heard on rock 101), or the older gal who's wearing that psychedelic butterfly shirt who's acting is like the disgusting water she's holding... it's not ""that good"".   Getting a job in your field. This is going to be hit and miss for some jobs, but in my experience since I moved out here I have found that if you are a college student you are cheap and there are plenty of you. But if you hold a degree, worked in your industry for almost 20 years, have the knowledge to get the job done, and are looking for a stable work environment, then you are going to cost too much. I can't tell you how many times I have had a position offered to me for $10-12 when I should be making well over $20-25 and hour.  Well, I like and hate a lot more of this town, but I feel that this rant/post has gone on too long. Many positive and negative things said in this thread are spot on. I moved here to get away from the rat race of the metroplex. I did this for my health and I feel it has helped. But sometimes I feel that I traded a few annoyances for another. I generally see this area as a midway point in getting to the mountains. Once I move from here, I won't care what happens in Lubbock. If my wife didn't have such a good job and we didn't have family here, I would be gone in a heartbeat. I didn't grow up here, but I sure as hell don't want to die here."
Lubbock,35ckn3,The_Mad_Gasser,2,Sun May 10 23:52:17 2015 UTC,"Wage stagnation is one of my main complaints about Lubbock. To make real money there you need to be very well educated (doctor, lawyer, ect.) Or have stake in a business.

Glad to not have to wait at restaurants often and not to deal with traffic jams.    Lived in Midland/Odessa for a few years and so that helped me put Lubbock in perspective as offering more than I realized the first time I lived here.

Lubbock,35ckn3,KodiakAnorak,10,Mon May 18 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"If Lubbock burned to the ground, I would play a fiddle and eat Skittles while I watched. Seriously. Fuck Lubbock.  I'm not just blowing smoke out of my ass-- I've lived in Shawnee, Norman, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Broken Bow (all in Oklahoma), and Austin. Tulsa isn't that much bigger than Lubbock, but it has many more parks and restaurants. Even though Shawnee is tiny compared to Lubbock, it has about the same level of amenities.  Lubbockites have no standards of service. Most of the restaurants are shit. I've found Lubbock restaurants that were highly recommended here to be barely average for Austin or Oklahoma City. There are limited opportunities for recreation (except drinking and various crimes) unless you feel like... you know leaving Lubbock and driving for hours. The downtown is a fucking joke and an eyesore, as all development has moved out toward 82nd and Lubbockites can't be bothered to do upkeep on their motley collection of skyscrapers. The crime rate is astronomically high, especially compared with Austin which is much larger and has more tourism. People will talk about ""how much there is in Lubbock"", but it's all the same few things-- a bunch of Walgreens, Wal-Marts, CVSs, and the like. But if you try to tell Lubbock folk about any of this, they get mad because most of them are from even shittier small West Texas towns and don't know any better. Their only responses are hillbilly aggression and defensiveness.  I could hang out in Zilker Park until 2 or 3 AM without feeling unsafe. Now try that same trick in Mackenzie Park and tell me how it goes.  So yeah, if Lubbock was destroyed tomorrow (as long as there was no loss of life) I'd feel like absolutely nothing of value or importance was lost. Oh, and I could live my entire life quite happily without seeing or hearing another jacked-up fratmobile again."

Lubbock,35ckn3,HERO3Raider,4,Sat May 9 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"I've lived in a lot of places. Long story short, I've always known a lot of people with money, but never had any myself. As a result I've lived in some extremely different places.  I've lived on the upper west side of Manhattan, east Hampton NY and Greenwich CT, the hedge fund capital of the world. I've also lived in East Harlem and the 9th ward of New Orleans. After getting robbed a few times, I moved a block away from Drew Brees.  I've lived in rural Pennsylvania, Central Florida, DC suburbs, Boston, Prague,  and India. Right now I live in Lubbock.  I can't say I've lived everywhere but I've definitely experienced all kinds of extremes. All of these places had their trade offs. Harlem was dangerous but I could afford it and get to midtown in ten minutes. New Orleans is the most dysfunctional city I've ever been too and yet it's easily my favorite. Good food, character, history, something new to be discovered every day.   Basically all these places have good aspects and bad aspects. Except Lubbock.  I'm not just trying to bash Lubbock. Seriously, it's just hands down the worst place of all. First off, the fucking weather. Enough said. Second, you're trapped here. The airport has constant delays and flights are always expensive. Driving anywhere means 5 hours plus. Third, the food sucks. Yes, there's exceptions. Maybe a dozen good restaurants. New Orleans is only about double the size of lubbock and it has hundreds. There's no good parks, and outdoor activities are pretty limited. Granted, the canyons are pretty cool. But beyond that there isn't much else.   Basically you don't get the benefits of a small town (it's not quite, safe or outdoorsy) and you don't get the benefits of a big city.   All I can say is, Lubbock has got a lot of fucking work to do."

Lubbock,35ckn3,HERO3Raider,5,Sat May 9 16:23:25 2015 UTC,Yeah you just need to get out more.  Tons of good restaurants in Lubbock you probably just don't know about.  In fact Lubbock has more restaurants per person then any other city in the US.  There is plenty to do outside from golf to lakes and sporting event.  But I promise non of that happens on your couch.  Also check out Mae Simmons and Mackenzie parks.  Very Nice and make you feel like your not in Lubbock.  The point is there is tons to do in Lubbock but no one wants to get out and look for them.  I have lived here for 10 years and lived in Dallas before that and never had a problem finding something to do here.  However when I lived in Dallas I never could afford to do anything and it was always a 1-2 hour drive to do anything.  Even go eat.
Lubbock,35ckn3,ScubaSteeeve,1 point,Sat May 9 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah you just need to get out more.   How much more does /u/semenbiscuit need to get out before you'll listen to his opinion? He says he has travelled quite a bit, and you still write that he needs to get off his couch.  If you like Lubbock that's cool, but the ""you just need to get out more"" or ""there are good restuarants you just don't know about"" argument is demeaning to those who honestly try and find Lubbock's postive attributes, but still find other cities more appealing."
Lubbock,35ckn3,hoyrolland,3,Sat May 9 18:17:59 2015 UTC,I respect his opinion 100%.  It just been my experience that most people that say this never get out of there section of Lubbock and think thats all there is.  Lubbock has lots to do but most of it isnt easy to find.  He like you already have your mind made up about Lubbock so me sharing my point is no different.  But I know personally that over 20 new restaurants have opened in Lubbock since the start of the year.  I highly doubt he is hitting them all.  Not because he isnt trying but because most of them aren't on Yelp.
Lubbock,35ckn3,hoyrolland,1 point,Sat May 9 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"I'm torn about this city.  I'm a musician. The music scene here sucks a big fat one. San Angelo and Midland are way more friendly to original music of diverse genres. Buddy Holly wouldn't be able to make it in Lubbock's music scene today or even get a band together unless he stopped playing his own stuff. Too many cover bands in this town.  Tech is a good school. Say what you will about the students, but they're way more tolerable than Texas State students (I went there before coming to Tech, and I have no idea how San Marcos doesn't beat the pants off of Lubbock when it comes to DWI and crime statistics). SPC is also a great school with great programs.  The traffic isn't bad. The city is fairly easy to navigate, and traffic jams clear up way more quickly than they do in bigger Texas cities. It's not too hard to get anywhere you need to go within a half hour or so. There are some terrible drivers (fuck you if you rev your engine when you get off the 4th Street exit from Marsha Sharp coming off University late at night; people live around there, micropenis), but that's par for the course anywhere you go.  There are some good businesses opening up. We're starting to get more niche restaurants. While you can't get authentic Asian food here in a restaurant, you can make your own with ingredients from the Asian markets. There are burger and taco joints normally associated with bigger, nicer cities here.  There's plenty I like about this city and plenty I hate about it. I wish it wasn't such a stubbornly red city. I don't like stubbornly blue cities, either, but stubbornly red ones tend to be dead when it comes to the arts."

Lubbock,35ckn3,KodiakAnorak,8,Sat May 9 08:38:58 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I are constantly looking for things to do. We go out at least twice a week. I've tried every restaurant on Yelp with 4 stars or more. I've been to probably every single bar at least once. Weve been to every museum. We've gone to First Friday, local concerts, etc.. We entertain ourselves going swimming at tech, camping in the canyons, shooting at the range. We're really active people and we're always looking for fun things. Even with all this effort, we're pretty fucking bored.   The number of good restaurants is very very limited. Most of them close at 9 or 10. On weekends! In four years I didn't try 10% of the good restaurants in New Orleans. I discovered something new almost every weekend.  It's not just that it's boring. People here can't fucking drive. The crime is outrageous. There's no cabs. The public transport sucks / doesn't exist. This city has none of the benefits of a big city. It's not a metropolis. It's just a really big middle of no where.   Meanwhile it has all the shitty aspects of a city. It's ugly and full of crime.   No benefits of small town / middle of nowhere. I don't know my neighbors. It's not pretty. There aren't any good outdoor activities. Of course it still smells like shit pretty frequently.   Oh and the crazy conservative people. This is personal opinion and not an objectively true fact about Lubbock but goddamn people. Girls getting married at 18. People that don't drink. Crazies parading around tech telling homos to burn in hell. This lady telling me that pot makes people turn violent and abandon their children.   But don't worry, I will leave. Soon as I can.

Billiards is usually $5/hr. and Fast Eddies' rates are the same day or night; never more than $6, sometimes as low as $4 per person for all day. (unless it's a fight-night). Everyone in the league from either Billiards or Fast Eddies knows just about everyone else, so it's pretty easy to make friends and find someone you'd like to practice with."

Pretty much any bar on Broadway will have the playoffs on, so if you are going for cheap drinks: Bar PM, the Local and Mesquites all have good specials (Whiskey Wednesday). Mesquites has that upstairs area as well where you could avoid obnoxious crowds. Skooner's is a really cheap and chill option as well, but pretty smokey if you don't mind that. I do know they will be having live music later on tonight but the guy playing is my buddy and he is absolutely incredible.  But for the Clippers/ Rockets game I imagine it's going to get pretty rowdy. I've been out to the Lantern before with my buddies which is nice because its smokeless. Definitely much pricier, but you can hear/watch the entire game there.  EDIT: Realize I gave you all bars. Sorry if that's not what you wanted at all haha.

Lubbock,34w4ri,theskyisblue2122,20,Tue May 5 01:25:02 2015 UTC,Citiy is flat and not set up for sudden torrential rainfall.  Citizens only complain  about drainage when it rains. Citizens refuse to authorize bonds to fix it when election comes round because our memory is short
Lubbock,34w4ri,WTXRed,6,Tue May 5 02:06:16 2015 UTC,Quaker was specifically redone to improve conditions but also regrade for drainage. People weren't too happy when it marginally helped flooding and disrupted traffic significantly to the area 4th-19th-34th.
Lubbock,34w4ri,SteamTables,7,Tue May 5 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"I think one of the biggest issues is how flat Lubbock actually is. Roads are shaped, graded, and elevated to let water flow from the center of the road (giving them a domed appearance) into preferably a storm water drain and eventually a playa lake (retention pond). That is, if any of these things are in place, not blocked or in disrepair, or already full.   Water flows down hill. Any low spot will be filled with water first. Best example of this is the Marsha Sharp underpass below University. Last major flood, there was at least 6-10 feet of water in the quite large dip. You can also see how grading and design effect roads as well. I would personally like to believe that the road is graded to lessen flooding on the higher traffic side of the road, but somehow I don't think this is quite the answer. University near campus is another great example of this. The southbound lane is lower than the far side of the northbound lane, and the flooding is worse on seemingly one side of the road. Intentional or not (my guess is the latter), this also contributes.   The amount of concrete also promotes flooding as well. As you travel west on 4th, places that receive identical amounts of rain can also not be flooded at all. Improved storm drainage systems contribute, but having tons and tons of soil helps soak it up (not in a flash flood though, soaking up is not instantaneous). Best counter example is the area around the Jones stadium/commuter north parking at Tech. There is nothing but concrete, and it floods instantaneously. I walked through there this afternoon and it was nearly 1 foot of water, and flowing fast. There is simply too much water and nothing for it to soak into or flow.   Many factors contribute, fast and heavy storms make it much worse."
Lubbock,34w4ri,SteamTables,4,Tue May 5 02:02:18 2015 UTC,"Adding to what you said, it usually doesn't rain very much around here so having underground flood water systems everywhere does not make a lot of financial sense.  Land is pretty cheap in Lubbock and people build outwards instead of upwards as it goes in many other cities bordered by geography or other cities.  To illustrate this point Lubbock has about 1,875 people per square mile while Dallas has 3,645, Austin has 2,758, San Antonio has 3,000, and New York City has 27,857."
Lubbock,34w4ri,drgalaxy,5,Tue May 5 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"People seem to forget where we've come from. I'm 26 and lived here my whole life. I went to Trinity for school and the lake next to it would flood all the time. The entire parking lot would fill with water, then spill onto the loop, meanwhile, the lake across the loop next to the apartments and Holiday Inn would do the same. Even in September of 2008, we had a storm about this bad and you couldn't even move throughout the city. It has gotten much better, people don't seem to realize it."
Lubbock,34w4ri,UberXLBK,3,Tue May 5 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"True.  It's much, much, much better than it used to be.  I remember in the 90's a small rain could flood Lakeridge for weeks.  Now it actually takes heavy rain to do that.  Plus I was actually able to drive to work this morning, all roads would have been impassable in the past."
Lubbock,34w4ri,footd,2,Tue May 5 14:11:12 2015 UTC,"I grew up here too and have noticed the same thing. I have newspaper clippings in my scrapbook of car dealerships underwater for days in the 90s. That doesn't really happen anymore. The roads clear a lot faster now than they used to. But a flash flood is still a flash flood, ya know. More water than the ground has capacity to take in, in a very short period of time."

Lubbock,34w4ri,CloseoutTX,2,Tue May 5 14:25:24 2015 UTC,Our drainage sucks and no one cares about it until it storms heavily.  That doesn't happen often - so the city will never do anything about it until someone remembers that it's a problem when it's not storming.
Lubbock,34w4ri,whisbark,4,Tue May 5 15:04:46 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, 5-year-olds should not be using that kind of language. Secondly, when a lot of rain falls from the sky and the ground is not soft, due to many sunny days and lack of rain, and it is cloudy outside, due to one not sunny day and lots of rain, the ground does not absorb the water and the sun does not make it evaporate. So all of the water just stays there because it has nowhere else to go. I hope that helped little buddy, now run along before I tell your mommy to wash your mouth out with soap."

To be fair, I am picturing the greasy, smelly white vans that pull up to construction sites to sell fajitas by the burrito. We ate from those because we had to, not because we wanted to. Are these new food trucks rolling french gourmet kitchens now?  ...is this just a fad? Are they hot shit in Portland or something? Is the top-selling truck called the ""Zombie Moustache North Face Mobile""?"

Lubbock,34em7u,HERO3Raider,2,Thu Apr 30 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"They are a fad but I think one that's here to stay. In San Antonio they have become very popular and for good reason. They are going to allow a lot more people to sell food and sell it where people want it. I visited a place in San Antonio that had an outside bar/patio and allowed food trucks to sell food right there, and it was a great place to spend a Saturday night."

In the summer construction site were too hot to bring lunch to. Even with ice packs, by lunch time your sandwich was cooked and drinks boiling hot. I have been sick as a dog a few times from eating food truck food. Now, that being said I'm sure there are some really decent ones out there. To answer the OP's question I see one parked out front of El Rodeo at 48th & Q on the weekends. People say it's pretty good."
Lubbock,34em7u,TxMedic436,-2,Thu Apr 30 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am getting downvoted, so I think the answer is ""yes, it's a fad"".

Lubbock,34em7u,BinaryMagick,3,Thu Apr 30 20:16:12 2015 UTC,Food trucks have been big in Austin for 7 or 8 years now. Most are really great food from people that love to cook but can't afford the up front cost of opening a brick & mortar restaurant.
Lubbock,34em7u,Bohrdog,-4,Thu Apr 30 20:58:29 2015 UTC,Probably because of this movie.
Lubbock,34em7u,gentlemanJosh,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"You got it backwards. The movie was made because of the recent popularity of food trucks. The food truck trend is an outgrowth of the celebrity chef phenomena brought on by Food Network, Gordon Ramsay, etc. causing hipsters to start calling themselves 'foodies' (cringe) and the prominence of social media.   I'm fine with food trucks and they spawn a lot of unique, great tasting food. I've been to Clyde Warren park in Dallas a few times and they usually have about a dozen food trucks on the weekends. Lubbock is just shitty at supporting cool, local places. We have a few funky places, but the most popular restaurants in town will always be Texas Roadhouse, On the Border, Cheddar's, etc."

Lubbock,34ea3l,prock12,3,Thu Apr 30 13:11:00 2015 UTC,"It is true. I'm a DM for a store in the mall and that's how they qualified our exorbitant rent. I am glad the mall is getting updated, though. It is far past due. I think with all the new lifestyle centers coming in, they simply didn't have a choice any longer. Why would anyone choose the mall when being in a strip will essentially make them the same volume but with lower rent?? The mall will also attract stronger tenants once the update occurs."
Lubbock,34ea3l,Epinondus,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:08:25 2015 UTC,What do you mean new lifestyle centers
Lubbock,34ea3l,christopher07cummins,2,Thu Apr 30 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"Lifestyle center is the retail phrase for strips that attract more upscale clientele. Like the strip at 82nd and Quaker would be considered a lifestyle center. The new center that will house Charming Charlie's and Torrid could be considered a lifestyle center. It all really comes down to who the tenants are. I use the two terms interchangeably, though. As fast fashion, (low price points), becomes more popular with the masses, there will be more co-tenancy of high and low price point stores so there really won't be any difference between strips and lifestyle centers."
Lubbock,34ea3l,Epinondus,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:58:30 2015 UTC,Just curious - are you saying the rent at Kingsgate is less than the mall?
Lubbock,34ea3l,Texxx81,1 point,Tue May 5 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure about Kingsgate specifically but we pay nearly $20,000 monthly for about 5,000 sq ft which is considered really high for a mall of this caliber. Similar malls, Abilene and Amarillo, have leases at $6,000-$8,000 for the same space. And the Mall of Abilene actually has higher traffic counts consistently."
Lubbock,34ea3l,Epinondus,1 point,Tue May 5 12:49:49 2015 UTC,"Surprising that it's that much higher than Abilene, and that the Abilene mall has higher traffic counts.  Given that, I'm surprised they keep it leased out to the extent that they do. You gotta sell a lot of yoga pants to pay that kind of rent..."

Lubbock,349v82,prock12,9,Wed Apr 29 13:27:28 2015 UTC,I'm in the Commercial/Residential Real Estate and this town is bustin in its seams. We have so much private money coming into Lubbock finally that is allowing us to grow. Mayor is doing a great job of getting this done. Lubbock was very conservative about this and he's changed it. Be on the look out for some awesome restaurants to keep coming and retail. I'm working on a few land deals for some entities that hide their real entity and its so hard for me to not talk about whats coming!
Lubbock,349v82,Mazzpal,3,Wed Apr 29 15:54:50 2015 UTC,you cant tempt us like that and give us sooommmeee sort of hint.  lol  I love all the new stuff coming in to town!
Lubbock,349v82,HERO3Raider,6,Wed Apr 29 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"I wish I really could. I have to sign Non-Disclosures :( Reddit would incriminate me! I'll say some of the rumors are true though! Our downtown is getting a revamp. We're moving in some really nice private money into revamping the area. Some buildings will be turned into lofts, condos, etc. with shops on the bottom."
Lubbock,349v82,Mazzpal,5,Wed Apr 29 19:59:45 2015 UTC,How long do you think it will be until we see a big influx of construction downtown?
Lubbock,349v82,HERO3Raider,6,Wed Apr 29 20:09:54 2015 UTC,"You'll start seeing tons of construction once the utilities are taken care of. Believe it or not, it's cheaper to just build new construction right now and one reason is because utilities. Utilities are the #1 most cost effective part for a General Contractor. 90% of utilities are aerial and Lubbock is trying to put these in the ground in phases. You'll see a lot of alley's blocked off for some time splicing fiber into the pedestals. This has been going on for a little over two years now. Trying to make alleys all concrete for students to be able to walk/ride bikes down them to get to the campus quicker.  I'd say in 2-3 years you'll start seeing crazy amounts of construction. Just start looking for orange/yellow paint on the ground :) It's an indication they're locating utilities due to digging.  Really though, I've had the chance to talk to the Mayor because he made his bread and butter from Real Estate Investments in the 1-4 Family House Holds. He came from being poor to making it on himself. I think its the best for our city to grow with a Real Estate Background because he knows how to grow the city. He's got the right idea with connecting us to the major highways. Lubbock has the potential to be one of the biggest HUB's for a warehousing/manufacturing. O'Rileys Auto Parts warehouse pays the city of Lubbock a royalty because one of their major warehouses is here in the commercial park area."
Lubbock,349v82,Mazzpal,7,Wed Apr 29 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"Another fun fact I want to add before I started to ramble.   With gas prices being lower than average also helps build a city quicker. One major expense for Contractors is gas prices moving cargo/materials across the nation. With this being low, they save thousands of dollars on their construction expenses.  It's really a catch 22. Bad for the oil companies but great for commercial businesses."
Lubbock,349v82,Mazzpal,4,Wed Apr 29 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"Do you know if there are any plans on adding to our ""skyline""? I understand that it's cheaper to build out than up, but it would be really nice if Lubbock had an inspiring skyline... can you imagine the sunsets from atop a 40+ story building?"

A lot of positives have happened to Lubbock but lots more are needed.  Its been a slow process but its definitely been worth it.
Lubbock,349v82,HERO3Raider,5,Wed Apr 29 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"I'm from a small town southeast of Lubbock, so it was the big city growing up. I started noticing the growth when I moved up for college 5 or 6 years ago. It absolutely exploded before I moved away last year, and to be honest, I really miss it.   Don't miss that weather, though."
Lubbock,349v82,BrianAllred,17,Wed Apr 29 13:38:37 2015 UTC,"Lubbock is a cool place to visit if you're from a smaller town. However larger cities always have more to offer. Also, I feel that Lubbock has a very conservative vibe to it so I wouldn't want to move there. Lots of crazy bible peeps who are hypocrites by judging everyone. I'm from Lubbock moved to Dallas last year. I do like visiting my parents at the lake though!"
Lubbock,349v82,Chickennoodle3,6,Wed Apr 29 14:51:15 2015 UTC,This has always been my biggest qualm with Lubbock. It is definitely very conservative and very religious and if you aren't those things as well it can be alienating sometimes. Also the wind/dirt but that is something that will always be here.
Lubbock,349v82,ambulancemechanic,3,Wed Apr 29 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"Here in lies the problem. I'm from Lubbock, but moved to Amarillo area for about 5 years after college. Amarillo is about as conservative as Lubbock, but there is a pretty good non-religious community of people that are college graduates/older than mid 20's. A lot of them work in the restaurant business or are part of the art community or music scene. There is also an atheist/agnostic group that meets weekly at one of the coffee shops. I have not found such a community since moving back to Lubbock in October.  I have a few friends that are not crazy conservatives and are generally like minded, but my wife and I can't seem to make any new friends as we are not church goers and don't have kids. All of our respective co-workers are generally religious, so no help there.  It seems like there are plenty of secular people here on reddit, but I never seem to meet any of you guys IRL."
Lubbock,349v82,acquaman831,2,Thu Apr 30 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"Cool! I grew up here as part of a church going family, but got out of that life a while back. It makes it hard to relate to family, co-workers, etc. The friends I have left are mostly like minded, but that group has dwindled quite a bit."

I enjoyed my visit and look forward to my 2 years living there.   PROS:  dining diversity-I was surprised I could get things like Lebanese and Hawaiian BBQ.   recreational things- You got a couple of good disc golf courses (wish there was one closer to the school), Buffalo Spring Lake for fishing, you're not too far from Palo Duro Canyon.  Museums-I love museums and you guys got a couple of good ones, although not very large they are very well done. I look forward to the rotating exhibits.  Friendly people: someone was kind enough to let me know I was hanging out in the ghetto part of town. that being said, the ghetto part of town isn't anything like ghettos in most cities I've been in.  CONS:  sprawly, but it seemed that traffic wasn't that bad and I was able to get around town much faster than I thought I would.  public transport: lacking, bus system shuts down way too early.  downtown?: where? didn't see a normal downtown type area.    all in all I think you guys got an alright place to be here"
Lubbock,349v82,WotanGoesBack2School,3,Wed Apr 29 17:07:21 2015 UTC,"Downtown in the the very early stages of a huge makeover. Right now they're doing a lot of infrastructure/utilities work, but there are big plans for revitalizing downtown, bringing in a lot of residential properties.  They've been working this for a couple of years now, and the results aren't showing yet, but in 5 years I think downtown is going to look very different than it does now."
Lubbock,349v82,Texxx81,3,Fri May 1 04:34:03 2015 UTC,"The lack of traffic makes me love it here over a big town. I'd like to see more independent coffee shops in the Tech area, more independent boutiques. I REALLY want to see more cool shows. Backstage was doing a great job of that but they lost their booking gal."
Lubbock,349v82,dianasparx,5,Tue May 5 12:42:18 2015 UTC,I agree with the traffic. I'm not big in the coffee shops and such. There is a company trying to put a pub atmosphere either near the tech campus or Milwaukee. Some Independent shops are scared to focus on University as their main source of business because during summer some think they couldn't recoup. I don't see the logic in it though if its like a coffee shop that doesn't have much overhead or something that needs a lot of supply/capital.
Lubbock,349v82,Mazzpal,2,Wed Apr 29 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"Is that what happened to Backstage? For 4-6 months they were amazing, but I don't think I've been back since... Black Flag?  Cool venue seems to change every 1-3 years in Lubbock, and by the time you hear where it is, they shut down."

That being said, we are seeing the lingering effects of the +$100/barrel of oil era. Now that is gone, we will probably see this high rate of development taper off in the next few years.   I could be completely wrong but I don't think so given our geographical location and predominant business market."
Lubbock,349v82,ChEbrewdog,5,Thu Apr 30 12:17:19 2015 UTC,Luckily Lubbock's economy is not dependent on oil like the midland Odessa area.  I think we will see very small drop off if any here.  Medical district and Texas Tech help keep Lubbock a little more balanced then most places.  I think that is one reason why Lubbock continues to grow is because it is not dependent on one economic field.
Lubbock,349v82,HERO3Raider,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"I feel the opposite to be honest. I think we are just getting closer and closer to being another Killeen. A few decent spots in town.

Lubbock,349v82,Rocksteady717,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:31:59 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that Lubbock is a great place to live.  Nothing wrong with a conservative community either as long as they aren't preachy and I've never been pressured to join any particular church, so not sure what others' beef with that would be.  For those who want faster paced living with all the latest stores they can go to Dallas and get burned out in a decade or two - we have (and have had) everything we need.  I do wish we had a zoo, though."
Lubbock,349v82,Rustnrot,2,Wed May 6 14:17:10 2015 UTC,I feel like we couldn't have a zoo because our weather can be so odd and it would stress certain animals out to the point where they aren't healthy/die.
Lubbock,349v82,Bothagrius,3,Wed Apr 29 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Clovis, NM has a zoo. We have weird zoning/restrictions within city limits that limit the ability to put in a zoo."
Lubbock,349v82,Mazzpal,4,Wed Apr 29 17:32:25 2015 UTC,I'd like a zoo so long as it was indigenous or near indigenous animals with a focus on conservation. I'd hate if it was sad and gross.
Lubbock,349v82,dianasparx,5,Wed Apr 29 20:00:42 2015 UTC,I wish we could do an aquarium/zoo like the Dallas World Aquarium.  Indoors so the weather wouldn't jack up the animals and it's a great place to take the kids.

Lubbock,347oea,Michaelspanx81,2,Tue Apr 28 23:20:06 2015 UTC,"I currently have a bike in at Thundering Eagle over by 50th and Frankford.  So far his communication is pretty shitty and it's taken a while to get anything done.  I took it in due to no start and for new tires mounted. It's been in just under two months, no start was fixed ~3weeks ago, and tires are still not mounted. Only way I can get an update is by going in or calling (returns most calls next day, but have not had him call me once without calling him first)  I'll let you know how the work is if I ever get it back.  Depending what kind of bike it is, you could give Watts a call.  Talk to Ken and see what he says."

Pretty standard seafood fare and nothing really special about the place, but I've never been disappointed. The dailies are always awesome and well prepared... perfect for a light to moderate lunch."

They're tying to get a liquor license so right now it is BYOB.   Love me some ThaiThai. Especially #16, the chicken noodle soup. Yum.   Slim Chicken has super delicious fried pickles.   I'm a Rosa's addict and glad to be back in West Texas where Rosa's is everywhere. Seriously eat Rosa's 3 or 4 times per week. Love their bean burritos and keep their tortillas on hand in my house.   ChopChop is consistent. I always get steak and shrimp signature style with fried rice through drive-thru and it's always good.   Montelongos is the best Mexican breakfast IMO. I typically get either chorizo and egg burrito or carne guisada burrito. Oh, and their bacon is WOW.   Rise'N Shine donuts are amazing. Always warm and fluffy glazed donuts. Have to fight the urge to eat a dozen.   Hyashi is a good Japanese steak house. Their scallops are my favorite.   Obviously, we don't cook these days but hopefully we'll start back eventually. I get mortified that so many waiters, waitresses and cashiers know me as a regular. :/"

Einstein ain't cheap, but TE&I is downright expensive - they've never disappointed me, though.  Rain cafe is decent - nothing to write home about, but no complaints.  If you're looking for a cheap lunch then believe it or not you can get a rather large slice of pizza and drink at Costco for only a few bucks.   Firehouse subs is good for sub sandwiches - as is Jersey Mike's near the Wal-Mart on 82nd.    For dinner it's Orlando's like the other guy said.   Raising Cane's never disappoints.  Red Robin is really good if you have the scratch.  Chuy's never impressed me greatly - except the Elvis, which is fantastic.  You should try Schlotzky's if you haven't gone - nothing earth shaking, but we like it and it's a change of pace for some people.  Some people will scoff, but Longhorn steakhouse has given us some fantastic meals - but damned if it isn't expensive.  If Longhorn isn't your cup of steak then you might like Cagle's if you're up for a drive to the middle of nowhere - expensive, though.  There are lots of past threads for suggestions for less mainstream places that I haven't visited because I'm a crotchety old man and not cool enough to go.  Edit: almost forgot - if you want a new Mexican food place then maybe try Gorditos on 98th (I think)."

Picante's makes MASSIVE breakfast burritos and they're very quick with service. Montelongo's has the best salsa in town. Twisted Root is a little pricey, but you cant beat their burgers. Caprock Cafe is my favorite place to chill, watch a game, and drink a  ice cold scooner of beer. Their burgers are great too imo. Crafthouse Gastropub is one of the most unique places in Lubbock. The pricest of everything on this list, but WONDERFUL food, and its unique, their draft list is hard to beat. They change their menu by season too, so you'll always see different stuff made here."

Lubbock,33v5fw,Artorr627,1 point,Fri May 1 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"""Taqueria Jalisco"". Holy guacamole! They give you so much food that if you can finish it all, you'll wish you had saved it for later. The first time I went in there, I ordered a dinner platter (cost around $8ish)  and had enough for a meal later. The sodas are always on the sweeter/syrupy side and really complements the meal. Make sure you get the green sauce to dip your chips in, they are really good.   ""Lubbock Breakfast House"" is good, but I find myself not being able to make up my mind when looking through the menu. I guess it shouldn't be too hard to since just about everything there makes me run to the restroom about an hour later. Don't know why, just does. ""The Pancake House"" on Q is good, if you can catch them when they are open.  ""Rise & Shine"" is pretty good for donuts and breakfast goods, but they recently got a ""Dunkin Donut"" chain next to them. So we'll see how long Lubbockite's loyalties holds with them. There are other donut places in Lubbock (like ""Jack & Jill"" and ""Donut Depot""), but R&S is the easiest for me in my route.  Someone mentioned ""Aloha BBQ"". YES! The katsu chicken plate is what I always order and love it. Not to mention their portions are ""kahuna"" size so you get left overs. I love that they are probably the ONLY place in Lubbock that feature Spam on the menu.  If you are looking for chicken places, ""Golden Chick"" is good and not all ""churchy"" as ""Chicken Express"" (wonder if the local chain would call itself ""Churches"" if it could). Speaking of church names and chicken, ""Raising Canes"" (too bad it's not decorated like a Satanic temple LOL) is okay, their house sauce is interesting. But we really like the new ""Slim Chickens"" outside the loop on 4th.   Seafood, I honestly haven't found a great place. It seems that we are too far from the water to appreciate the other meat group. Actually, there/was a catfish place on the service road of I-27 next to Tractor Supply. But the lady was only open the later half of the week and used to close when she ran out of food. The catfish fillets were huge and fresh. Makes me miss the eastern side of this state.  As for burgers, there are TONS of non nationwide chains in this town. I really liked ""Tommy's Famous Burgers"" on University (north of the MSF) and ""Jim Dandy's Drive-in"" on the Clovis road. ""Wild Burger"" is good for some fat mouth-watering burgers, but everything is fried and when you get an appetizer sampler, it all looks the same.  I haven't tried ""Italian Garden"", but check out ""Giorgio's Pizza"" on Broadway in downtown. I don't think they are open for supper, but I have liked everything they have to offer. They even cook HUGE pizza pies for parties, or used to the last time I went in there. If you are looking for cheap and later in the afternoon/evening, I recommend ""Cheezies"" in the shopping center next to Wal-mart on 7th and Q. You can pick up pizza and calzones to last you for days at a fraction of the cost of normal pizza chain joints.   Lastly, if you haven't tried a gyro (or want to find a good one in town), I highly recommend ""Lite Bite Mediterranean"" on 50th. ""It's Greek to Me"" is okay, but they take too long to prepare the food. I like how ""It's Greek to Me"" serves fries as opposed to ""Lite Bite's"" chips. But I feel the gyro at ""Lite Bite"" has a better taste to it."

Fast Mexican food is definitely Rosa's.   Joe's Crab Shack is my favorite place for seafood. Their steam pots are to die for and fried calamari are my go to dishes there. Pair that with a Blue Moon beer and i can die a happy man.   Mama Fu's, Shogun, or Hayashi are my favorite Asian food. Hayashi can be a bit more expensive but it's worth it."
Lubbock,33v5fw,footd,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:30:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hate Cagels.  Way over priced for what you get.  Depending on their steaks that day you might end up with a plate full of gristle and spend way too much money on it.    I understand the appeal.  They have a nice atmosphere, but last time we went it cost $80 for two steals with sides and dessert and both steaks were way over cooked and tough."

Lubbock,33sadm,DComposer,2,Sat Apr 25 09:35:32 2015 UTC,"Hi. I'm an actor in Mary Poppins (and professionally a theater-type person), so I might be able to offer some insight. This is a local production only in the sense that it originated from Lubbock and the theater is based in Lubbock. It's a professional show.  You mentioned going to another show for about the same price, so obviously you are familiar with how much professional theater costs. Our production is a better value for your dollar than a touring show. We are hiring a team of dancers from Houston. Our Mary and our Bert (who is Equity) are both professional performers flown in for this show. The choreography is done by a professional choreographer. Foy International, the company that does the rigging for Cirque Du Soleil's aerial stunts, is going to be brought in to fly our actors. Our set crew has been working around the clock on a set that is bigger and better than any touring company's, as they are all designed to be mobile and we don't have to transport the set across the country. I'm in it, and I'm awesome. Etc, etc.  Honestly, I understand why you would think that it's pricy, but it's worth every penny. This show really does represent a turning point for Lubbock. We have an incredible talent pool that sadly evaporates because, well, nobody thinks local theater is worth paying money for. The fantastic actors and singers and dancers I've worked with have largely moved away and taken their talent elsewhere because there's not a lot of support for local theater. I've been to Broadway, I've seen the touring shows that come through town, and I've been doing LMM shows for over five years. We are really, really good at what we do. The biggest difference between LMM and most professional theater companies is that LMM is and will remain family-friendly. That's it. We are on our way to being a professional company while maintaining the family aspect of things, but we won't ever be able to be successful if the community does not support the home-grown arts as much as the companies that take that ticket money away from Lubbock and to NY, LA, or Chicago. It is pricy for community theater, sure, but that's not what Mary Poppins is going to be.  (Not to mention, of course, the summer series, which will continue to be affordable family entertainment. Shrek the Musical, 1776, and a special 10th year anniversary production of Oklahoma! will be the shows out at the amphitheatre in Mackenzie Park during the summer.)  TL;DR: Comparing Mary Poppins to local theater is the wrong mindset. Compare it to the touring, professional shows. And then buy tickets because I really enjoy having a job and paying bills and eating and stuff."
Lubbock,33sadm,jdogmoney,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:45:30 2015 UTC,"""I hope future LMM plays are a bit more reasonable… at least for the shows aimed at families.""  I mean, I definitely understand not being able to afford it. Most of my family won't be able to make this one for the same reason. But what you've written definitely seemed to indicate that you didn't want to pay it primarily because it was locally produced, which is a bit unfair.  Thank you for your well wishes!"
Lubbock,33sadm,jdogmoney,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:03:09 2015 UTC,"It is uncharacteristically pricy for a LMM show, but when I lived in San Diego I payed 50-70 a ticket for local and college theatre, so this is a welcome change from that. I'm also to understand that this show could mark LMM's transition to a fully matured company, letting them obtain the rights to all manner of plays and hire more talent."
Lubbock,33rfjy,HubCityActor,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:22:35 2015 UTC,"Have an upvote and good luck with the production - I hope people turn out for it.  I was at a civic club meeting yesterday and the two lead actors (Mary and Bert) came and did a couple of songs for us.  I've been talking it up. Would love to see the Lubbock theater scene blossom, and the new performing arts center is going to be HUGE for this city.

Lubbock,33mamm,footd,7,Fri Apr 24 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"""Police have not indicated which driver may have been at fault"" Yeah, sorry but no. Not only did the police not label it as that, but the witnesses didn't either, unless the witnesses you're talking about are people you personally know who chose not to give their testimonies and saw something completely different than what the witnesses saw.  She turned while he was at a far distance, turned out he was driving at an 'unsafe speed' without his emergency lights being on (this is pretty much the ideal time to use them) and slammed into her."
Lubbock,33mamm,SoylentPoptart,5,Fri Apr 24 01:40:30 2015 UTC,"""Police have not indicated which driver may have been at fault""   The one traveling at a speed falling under the definition of 'reckless driving' usually bears 51%+ of the responsibility when there's an accident that would have otherwise been the other person's fault had they not been excessively speeding."
Lubbock,33mamm,Miaoxin,11,Fri Apr 24 03:41:02 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what the police labeled it as and what witnesses described. She was turning left, he was going straight, both had the green light. She turned in front of him, failing to yield right of way, and was struck.   She turned and was struck because the police vehicle closed the distance significantly faster than would have happened at or near the speed limit.  If only there were some means of a police vehicle signalling to others that they may be exceeding the speed limit. Perhaps some form of readily identifiable lighting system, possibly in combination with some sort of audible warning."

""Police say that after identifying, locating and interviewing all known witnesses and after reviewing available witnesses, investigators have determined that both Morgan Lee, 20, and Officer Cody Kidd were traveling in opposite directions on the Clovis Highway prior to impact and that the traffic signal at the intersection was solid green for both directions.""  ""They say Lee was driving a 2012 Hyundai Veloster northwest on Clovis Road and was turning left to travel west on North Loop 289 while Officer Kidd was traveling southeast, continuing straight through the intersection. A 911 caller also told police that Lee turned into the path of Kidd."""
Lubbock,33mamm,footd,-1,Fri Apr 24 01:51:12 2015 UTC,I am fully aware of what the posted article says.  Feel free to google further write ups from right after this occurred.  What I am telling you is that if you turn left in front of a vehicle driving straight and you both have a green light then you have failed to yield right of way.
Lubbock,33mamm,footd,-1,Fri Apr 24 01:47:25 2015 UTC,hmmm it does seem like she failed to yield the right of way. I guess she just misjudged the speed at which he was traveling? Still sad.

Either way I don't take off that much metal, just enough to shape it the first time and touch it up subsequently. Grinders should only be for a last resort, but some people would rather do it fast than well"
Lubbock,32udnw,nukedorbit,1 point,Sat Apr 18 07:43:39 2015 UTC,"Hello, are you still interested in work on your knives?"
Lubbock,32udnw,KoltonC,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"I work with him, we are, it just slipped the mind until that fucker came in today, and fucked my knife up. I'll shoot you my number tomorrow through pm after I pay my phone bill."
Lubbock,32udnw,KoltonC,2,Fri Apr 24 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, sounds great"
Lubbock,32udnw,dianasparx,2,Fri Apr 24 18:26:45 2015 UTC,I have a Cold Steel Recon 1 Tanto.  It's AUS8A steel.  I'd love to have it sharpened and the tip repaired if you are interested.

Lubbock,32tnss,anthre,2,Thu Apr 16 16:57:23 2015 UTC,97th and Quincy on Saturday.
Lubbock,32tnss,Texasguy78,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:48:13 2015 UTC,.... Isn't that a dead end?  Quincy turns into a dead end around 94th...
Lubbock,32tnss,Agallion,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:18:07 2015 UTC,It dead ends at 98th
Lubbock,32tnss,Texasguy78,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:24:37 2015 UTC,"I think Crawdaddies on 82nd and Frankford (I think) has crawfish every Wednesday or Thursday. Their seafood is usually pretty good. I don't know if I would bother ordering anything else, definitely no steaks or anything like that. Customer service isn't great but it's a pretty chill sports bar/restaurant."

Lubbock,32u86g,DrooMighty,3,Thu Apr 16 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"There's a TTU student group, Heads Up Display, that supposedly plays that kind of thing. Check them out on Orgsync.  Don't have a ton of info as that's not my bag, but if you're into boardgames, I can help you out."
Lubbock,32u86g,WonderJouster,2,Fri Apr 17 01:55:45 2015 UTC,Smash Bros?
Lubbock,32u86g,ang3l12,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"No interest in Smash. I play USFIV, UMvC3 and older Capcom fighters like CvS2, MvC2, Third Strike and Super Turbo. Typically anything that would've been in the arcade back in the day."
