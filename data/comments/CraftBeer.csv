They were at an ale fest I went to recently and had some variations of the Mad Hatter I've never seen before. Good stuff.
CraftBeer,3e3nzd,machinedog28,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:17 2015 UTC,"I had the Tasmanian Hatter from New Holland. That was a mighty fine beer. I've tried their Dragon's Milk but wasn't a huge fan, but I'll attribute that to my IPA preferences. I'll have to pick up more by them sometime!"
CraftBeer,3e3nzd,shadow1138,2,Tue Jul 21 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of their special releases, the raspberry dragon's milk, incorrigible and incorrigible reserve (I picked up as many of these as possible), Ichabod Pumpkin Ale, Blue Sunday Sour, I've tried their new IPA's but haven't found much worthwhile in them (though their Tasmanian hatter was probably a standout, though there are better galaxy IPA's, just not often available). Overall you can find a better alternative for any of their main beers (perhaps beside Dragon's Milk, though it is mid tier in the style) most of the time. I'm super excited about their Dragon's Milk triple mash and chile that are coming out soon though, can't wait to try them."

However,  I would always recommend anything and everything from Fremont Brewing. If you're able to find them, Engine House 9 makes some of the best sours in the state and just started bottling them on a small scale. And as far as a brewery visit, check out Holy Mountain. Bottle shops to check out would be Beer Junction, Chucks Hop Shop and Bottleworks."

Great beer and the tap list is in constant flux. It is in an old house and on a couple bus lines. They're my favorite in town.   Tin Dig Brewing in South Park. Small selection, excellent beer. It can be a pain to get to without a car, though. They use 32oz cans for their growlers, so it's easy to take stuff with you.   And, because no one else has mentioned it, Ballard is full of breweries. There is a cluster of three in the same block (Hilliards, Peddler, and NW Peaks) that are all pretty good. And depending on your comfort with walking, there are 7 others within a fairly short walk from there.   Note: each of the place names are neighborhoods in Seattle.   I hope you enjoy your visit."

I use razor blade and slowly scrape the ones that don't fall off with hot water. Avery label is a bitch to remove. Try removing the maharaja label without cursing.

Hooked me up with a Quadrupel on Memorial weekend and it was awesome.  -Had stuff from St. Lawrence brewing while on vacation.  Skinny Dipper DIPA was only $9 and was great  -I just read that Ithaca Beer is expanding and my wife will be pumped if we get Apricot Wheat up here  -Also just read there are like 3 I haven't even heard of in Glens Falls, might have to wonder down there  -I wouldn't be drinking Lawsons and Burlington Beer Company if it wasn't for Saranac.  They introduced me to craft brew, specifically German influenced craft brew.  Queen city brewing opened last year in VT and Saranac gave me enough background to understand the German and English style beers they are doing.  While their stuff is now just a copy of whatever's already been made popular, they lead the way 10 years ago.  When Caramel Porter came out, my mind was blown.  I compare them to Magic Hat a lot in terms of their former greatness.  -And don't forget evil twin brewing"

I think my comment on untappd (username 9four9) was something along the lines of ""better have a mouth guard in cause you're about to get punched in the face"". Huge hops, malt and booze. Poorly balanced IMO.   And I'm right with you on Simtra. Phenomenal."

CraftBeer,3do9uw,smurfe,2,Fri Jul 17 22:53:54 2015 UTC,I hope this brings Firestone Walker to my work. We're the Ommegang/Duvel wholesaler for my area. For some reason though Boulevard was allowed to go with someone else.
CraftBeer,3do9uw,Elivictus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:37:40 2015 UTC,"Well, if you are the wholesaler for the Baton Rouge/New Orleans area, I will be rooting with you. That's where I live. We are getting quite a few great beers here but it sucks to see my favorites get trucked through the state to the east to Florida or to the west to Texas. I have been known to drive the 230 miles to Houston just to load up on beer. I could get Firestone Walker there. I believe I have bought Firestone in Pensacola Florida as well but not sure of that. It's been a few years since I have been there."
CraftBeer,3dn0qg,usernamewhat,3,Fri Jul 17 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"Make sure, whatever you do, hit up Beer Corner USA on 36th and Farnam. Stop into the Crescent Moon (Tuesday Pint Night) for a pint then walk over to Beertopia which sells just about everything we can get. Farnam House Brewery is right next door as well. Then, head up to Benson (60th and Maple area) and park. You can spend a day walking up Maple and hitting all the craft bars and breweries (Benson Brewery, Infusion Brewery, Beercade, Krug Park, Jake's Cigars). There might even be a show at The Waiting Room which has a nice tap selection.  Our distro is pretty much the same. You can pick up some of our local brews that are limited to Nebraska/Iowa such as Zipline, Lucky Bucket, Scratchtown, Brickway...

Beers are all still high quality, top notch beers. The Duvel partnership has done nothing but better Boulevard Brewing Company.  Edit: I've been drinking and a bit sleep deprived.

CraftBeer,3dkncf,Thatguyaric,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:08:11 2015 UTC,I'm hoping this brings Firestone to my local shelves here in Southeast Louisiana. I get Ommegang and Duvel. I believe Boulevard as well but not positive if it's still around here. Closest I could get to FW was the Mission St Pale they brewed for Trader Joe's which was a very nice beer. They stopped brewing it about 3-4 months after our local Trader Joe's opened. Saddness.
CraftBeer,3dkncf,Foopersuzz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:10:56 2015 UTC,"Coming from Kansas City, Boulevard is the hometown brewery that I have loved since 2006 (when I was 21), and since their buyout, absolutely NOTHING has changed for the negative. I still fill my two suitcases with however much of their beer I can fit whenever I fly home from a visit. Their brewing program has only gotten better, their distribution network has grown exponentially (I'm seeing 80 Acre in California now), and the staple beers that got them there in the first place is still high quality. The same can be said about Ommegang as well.  I am still in love with them, and with the thought of Firestone Walker being in the same family as them (my favorite California brewery), let alone the prospect of a collaboration brew (GEEKGASM), I am confident their delicious nectar will only get better with age.  TL; DR Ommegang and Boulevard are still great, so calm down and drink a beer."

Smuttynose's new brewery is absolutely beautiful and worth going to, plus their restaurant Hayseed is wonderful. Throwback just moved to a new location that looks promising as well. While you're in the area, hit up WHYM. It's a craft beer bar and the owners are great people, plus the beer selection is top notch.

CraftBeer,3dkn59,aPintofHoppiness,2,Fri Jul 17 10:47:13 2015 UTC,"A stout or porter will age. Browns and ambers will keep for a while, as well as lagers/pils. If the beer is high IBU, drink it immediately, and pale ales should not be left sitting for too long either. The only IPA you should ever try to age is if the label says to do it. Hope that helps..."

It will change and lose some of the fresh hoppiness characters, but if you've never cellared beers before, it's worth cellaring some things that traditionally don't do well so that you can experience what that really means, taste-wise.  edit: also you can check out this guide from /r/beer's sidebar"

CraftBeer,3d9vam,rightclickbait,7,Tue Jul 14 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"As a craft beer enthusiast, I do not understand the angle AB tries with their commercials trying to make craft beer look silly. Rather than trying to pull customers from an already booming market (which they themselves have embraced with their own versions i.e. shocktop) they need to realize they have a separate market entirely. If I am day drinking and slugging back 12+ beverages, I certainly am reaching for the American Macros for endurance. Yes the majority of my beer purchasing budget is going into craft brewers pocket, but there is still a market share that Macros rightfully have.   Edit (forgot the punch line): In my opinion, the more I am drinking, the more likely I am to drink the cheap stuff. Since with kids and commitments as you get older, you have less time to drink, so not only will my budget for drinking go down, but the amount spent on Macros will be basically non-existent. This is the opposite of what they are trying to argue."
CraftBeer,3d9vam,SurfJam418,2,Wed Jul 15 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"Your right about them not realizing its a completely different market, but I think the reason they havent figured it out is that the  new market was created by carving out their existing customer base, so they think those same people can be talked back into their product. Also they went so long without any real competition or change in the market that they forgot how to compete via innovation and such."

Love it or hate it, you have to give the macro brewers this: they are consistent. Day in and day out, regardless of which facility they are brewing in, no matter if it was brewed on the hottest day of the year or the frozen heart of winter. The beers will taste the same. That takes skill.   I later had the luck to be at an event with a big shot guy that used to new for a macro (Anheuser if I remember correctly) and he told me that every week, each brewer would express mail a bottle of beer to each other and each head brewer had to judge each one. They had to make sure that all their beers tasted exactly the same. The guy that stays working at a macro might not be able to do a great job being from scratch, but he might be amazing at filtration, or any of the other myriad task that are involved in brewing.   Just my two cents."

CraftBeer,3cndo7,bigpipes84,2,Fri Jul 10 00:53:15 2015 UTC,Thats what I was thinking.  The only other places in the industry would be beer distribution or brewery supply like malt and hops.    Itd be the career of a lifetime to start a craft beer distribution company that takes beer from specific markets and either makes it available via mail order or supplying other distributors.  Id pay good money to have a bottle of Pliney the Elder delivered to my door in Winnipeg.

CraftBeer,3cmne6,solovolk,0,Thu Jul 9 02:44:59 2015 UTC,"If anything I'd say you made super weak arguments, he made a very solid point about 'long term storage' and canning. He isn't talking about the 99% of other beers (in fact he said he drinks those out of cans and likes it that way), he is talking about the ones that are okay to be aged, and to my second point, you clearly don't realize just how many beers are okay to age. Literally anything over 6% alcohol that isn't meant to maintain a large hop presence (and sometimes even then) and especially things that are sour, barrel or oak aged are perfectly fine and even specifically meant to be aged. There is a very very large market for aged beers, I would even argue that beer trading is such a big thing today because of beers that can withstand the effects of age. You clearly don't age beer, or are unfortunate enough to live in some area of the US that doesn't have a large selection of well aging beers. Literally some of the most lauded and praised beers are long term agers. Sam Adams Utopias? Age that shit. Abraxas? AGE! Dark Lord? Why even ask. Monster park, KBS, World Wide Stout, Abyss, JW Lees, Bigfoot, 120, Big Bad Baptist, Yeti, Bourbon County, A ton of Russian River stuff (-tion), Backwoods Bastard, Mirror Mirror, Jubel, Dragon's Milk, Sucaba,a ton of The Lost Abbey, a ton of Jolly Pumpkin, a ton of Jester King, most any lambic, La Folie, Raspberry Tart, The Bruery, and many more.

CraftBeer,3cbirl,cynosureskater,5,Mon Jul 6 16:57:18 2015 UTC,There are a couple liquor stores in town where owners will sell past date beer for a bit above cost to regular customers. See if you could make a deal with the owner.
CraftBeer,3cbirl,Allie_dog,3,Tue Jul 7 04:09:49 2015 UTC,You think they would be reducing the price anyway. No one buying Founders or some other brand? Let's put it on sale so that people will be encouraged to buy it.
CraftBeer,3cbirl,cyrilspaceman,2,Tue Jul 7 04:42:48 2015 UTC,Cost is a term a store uses meaning what they purchased their product. I'm a little drunk. Let me know if this wasn't what you're talking about.
CraftBeer,3cbirl,Allie_dog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:29:32 2015 UTC,"I knew what you meant, I just worded things poorly. I just meant that I would assume they would put poor sellers on sale for a dollar off or something to encourage people to buy it before they would start offering it for cost plus 10%."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,cyrilspaceman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:54:37 2015 UTC,"That's what I would assume too, and most places do. The specific store I visit is under staffed, and I noticed lots of refermented in the bottle bombers when I first visited. Struck a deal with the owner to help him clear out, and I get Belgians and some sours on the cheep."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,Allie_dog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"Did you mean ""below"" cost to regular customers? I would totally ask for a discount but I'm not sure how double IPA would be that's almost a year old."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,mannyvz17,3,Tue Jul 7 11:27:59 2015 UTC,"I work at a liquor store and thus is probably what he means. Say we buy a six pack of something from a distributor at $7 per six pack. We'll then mark it up to $10 to sell the customer. If the product isn't selling well or old, we'll mark it down to a dollar over cost at $8. Cost refers to what the store pays not the customer."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,Allie_dog,2,Thu Jul 9 14:10:21 2015 UTC,Some are sold that way. Depends on the popularity. Where I went to college an owner would buy out of date beer from distributors and sell it super cheep. That's how I began getting into craft beer.
CraftBeer,3cbirl,Ghost_Crow,2,Tue Jul 7 15:05:25 2015 UTC,"Where I work the distributor reps are supposed to buy back any out of date beer.  They have to pay for it out of pocket so they just ignore it. It will then stay on the shelf until someone in the department notices and pulls it. Or if they're lazy, the product will just stay out for purchase."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,Ghost_Crow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"So it might just be pointless to say something to the people that work there because it's not really on them, for they probably realize how old the beer is as well."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,OystersAreEvil,3,Mon Jul 6 21:29:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. There's not a whole lot they can do about it.   Some of us do actually care, but our hands are tied.   I had to dump probably 10 gallons of old beer down the drain about two months back. That was a sad day."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,brewcitybastard,3,Tue Jul 7 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"For those not familiar with that measurement, 10 gallons is a little over four cases of beer (4 x 24 pack x 12 oz)."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,account080491,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:35:26 2015 UTC,"That's sad. I've never had Double Trouble by Founders and the store by me has several 4 packs of it, but the bottled on date is 10/13/2014. It'd be a barleywine at that point"
CraftBeer,3cbirl,hopskillsbadgers,2,Tue Jul 7 11:25:13 2015 UTC,"Our store is diligent as hell at finding old beer, notifying the distributor, and getting it out of there. It just depends on the store. We also tend to ""test the waters"" for some of the beers we're not sure will move by bringing in smaller amounts first then re-ordering if it moves well. Some places will just buy large amounts of beer with no clue about it. It's unfortunate for the customer because there's a bunch of space getting taken up by beer that no one wants."
CraftBeer,3cbirl,loupgarou21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:53:33 2015 UTC,That's so true. I always wondered maybe the store won't put out the new stuff they get in until the older stuff is gone
CraftBeer,3cbirl,bdp1201,2,Mon Jul 6 21:31:32 2015 UTC,As far as Founders goes...I work for their distributor. We constantly have too much in the market that we're trying to get rid of that is out of code. Even still at the warehouse and not just the stuff on shelves.

CraftBeer,3c9tae,SirShale,5,Mon Jul 6 06:10:51 2015 UTC,Ballast Point Sculpin was the beer that got me into IPAs. You should try to find some of that. It is a little pricy though try to get a single bottle of it at a beer store.
CraftBeer,3c9tae,greyblok,2,Mon Jul 6 07:04:12 2015 UTC,"Ballast point sculpin is a really good IPA (they finally started carrying it in Sweden's alcohol store [government controlled] and I bought 3 bottles right away). Not as bitter as many other IPAs, however it still tastes strong (alcohol-wise) which I understood was a problem for OP. Could be a beer to work up to, because it really is good.  Edit: I'm on the phone so I incorrectly remembered strong taste of alcohol to be one of OP's problems with IPAs..."
CraftBeer,3c9tae,tapofwhiskey,2,Mon Jul 6 08:16:12 2015 UTC,"I'm also recommending the Sculpin. It's been my go-to for a couple of years now. It's crisp, refreshing, and has enough fruity notes to sort of ease you into the hop forwardness of the IPA"
CraftBeer,3c9tae,gregislegend,3,Mon Jul 6 15:28:50 2015 UTC,"Why not start with some hoppy brown ales?  I had to jump right into it. I wasn't big on IPAs until that's all my dad would drink. So, whenever I was hanging with him, that's what I had. I started with Sierra Nevada's Torpedo. Pretty soon I found myself ordering it everywhere I went.

CraftBeer,3c9tae,speedpickles,3,Mon Jul 6 13:35:11 2015 UTC,Deschutes Chain Breaker is my recommendation. It's a white IPA so it's pretty easy going. I don't recommend session IPAs; they are usually foamy and not very flavorful but still have bitterness.
CraftBeer,3c9tae,JuDGe3690,2,Mon Jul 6 06:57:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat—I can't stand most IPAs, especially those with excessive citrus-type hops, but I love porters, stouts and dark brown ales.

Try different ones as often as you can but don't burn yourself out."
CraftBeer,3c9tae,monkinator,2,Mon Jul 6 19:03:40 2015 UTC,The first IPA that I really started enjoying was Two Hearted. From there I moved to hoppier IPAs. If you enjoy supporting the MI beer culture give it a try!
CraftBeer,3c9tae,MSU_spartyon,2,Mon Jul 6 19:25:15 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend working your way up to IPA's. I really didn't like IPA's when I first tried them either, and now they're my favorite style. But it took a long time of drinking different beers to acquire that taste. I would recommend just drinking beer you like, and trying to find beers that are similar but maybe slightly hoppier than you're used to. Just doing exploration will eventually expand your palate and you might try an IPA and find yourself loving it.  Another recommendation is to try some English Pale Ales. They tend to be more balanced and not quite as bitter as American Pale ale's or IPAs, so they might be more up your alley. If you like those keep drinking them and you'll get to IPAs.  I don't think theres really a fast and easy way to come to enjoy IPAs unfortunately. It's kind of a journey that you have to take. But that's my opinion. Good luck!"
CraftBeer,3c9tae,bdp1201,2,Mon Jul 6 20:27:06 2015 UTC,"My craft beer taste started out this way too! First off let me tell you how lucky you are to be in Michigan, they have such a great variety of craft beer, it's where I used to live and I miss it SO much! I started with a lot of stouts and porters and then jumped head first into IPAs since my SO was such a big fan. My suggestions for great ones to start out with would be Perrin's grapefruit IPA, Founder's pale ale and Founder's all day IPA! Starting with the pale ales and moving in a more hoppy direction to include Indian pale ales might be a great idea! Also you might enjoy black or rye IPAs, they marry the malty and hoppy flavors very nicely and might be more of a stepping stone to something exclusively labeled hoppy. Luckily IPAs are pretty popular in the summer so this is a great time to experiment with lots of fun ones! Enjoy your MI craft beers and happy drinking!"
CraftBeer,3c9tae,notahipster-,2,Mon Jul 6 20:54:17 2015 UTC,"I am going to have to point you in the direction of the session IPA. These lower alcohol IPAs are made to be enjoyed with friends and you can actually drink more than a couple at a time. The hop flavors are usually preserved while providing a ""lighter"" starting point for IPA beginners.   I recommend Pinner Throwback IPA from Oskar Blues."
CraftBeer,3c9tae,NathanPierce,2,Wed Jul 8 03:35:00 2015 UTC,"Try Pale Ales first. My first (legal) beer which I had a few months ago was an Arrogant Bastard, which I couldn't finish. I then tried pale ales, which I liked a lot, and now I'm starting to drink the more mild IPAs."
CraftBeer,3c9tae,bluegrassgazer,2,Wed Jul 8 04:33:27 2015 UTC,"From the first sip of Dogfish Head's 90 minute IPA, I loved it forever. To me, it's more floral than bitter. Don't feel bad if you don't like IPAs at first. They're all the rage, but don't feel like you need to drink an IPA to fit in or anything. There're tons of other great styles out there. I liked lots of Porters, Stouts, and Belgian Ales before I liked any IPA. It's an evolution of the palate."
CraftBeer,3c8ppa,LetsAllStayCalmHere,5,Sun Jul 5 23:13:34 2015 UTC,I tend to stay away from buying beers that don't have dates on the can/bottle because you never know how old it can be. Sometimes you can check for haze or chunks in the beer but just be aware if it's an unfiltered beer if you use that method.
CraftBeer,3c8ppa,friskmym33t,2,Mon Jul 6 00:12:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I have been burned far too many times in the past by hoping for the best. Unless it's something ridiculously rare or a stout I pass on bottles with no dates."
CraftBeer,3c8ppa,Cpowel2,2,Tue Jul 7 00:53:28 2015 UTC,"Most companies don't date their bottles, at least from my experience, so I'd recommend asking the people who work at the establishment if something might not be fresh.

CraftBeer,3c8ppa,speedpickles,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:01:59 2015 UTC,You are a good man then.  I know plenty of bottle shops that would want you to take maturing bottles to get them the hell out of the store.
CraftBeer,3c8ppa,scgt86,2,Thu Jul 9 13:58:45 2015 UTC,"Another way I don't see mentioned here is by checking for reviews and information from BA or RB, or checking different release sites/google to find out approximately how long ago it came out. If I'm not sure when it was released I normally check beeradvocate and see if I can find the last review and see if there are a reasonable amount of recent reviews for a beer that just came out. If there aren't or it doesn't seem like a sure thing then I search the brewery name and 'release date' and find out when it was last released if possible that way. For smaller breweries that almost never works but for larger more well known it's a good way of finding that out."
CraftBeer,3c8ppa,solovolk,2,Tue Jul 7 03:42:47 2015 UTC,That's a hard one.  Bear Republic marks a drink by which makes it harder to tell since each beer may have a different shelf life.  I look for something that I know the brewery just released.  Bottles are usually at their best when you first see them hit your market.  I guess the lesson to be learned is know what you want based on releases before you walk into a store.
CraftBeer,3c8ppa,scgt86,2,Thu Jul 9 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"Don't buy it. If the brewer doesn't care enough to date their bottles/cans, I don't care enough to try their beers."
CraftBeer,3c8ppa,adam42381,4,Mon Jul 6 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"I wish that was my philosophy, but two big local breweries do not date their beers. To make sure I try fresh, I follow their releases and only try them when I know they just came out"

But it finished with a very moderate hoppiness. With a IBU of 66.6 it took me by surprise. I don't like hoppy beers but this one I did I would recommend it to people who don't like IPAs. But have a lot of friends that drink IPAs. Its a hard style to get into for people like me. Ok, O'Dells brombeere a blackberry gose. I think the BlackBerry was supposed to compliment the saltiness of a traditional gose although in this case I don't think it did.

I only drink it a few times a year when I see it on draft. ...And I just went to their website and saw they're shipping it in 12oz bottles now?! Will definitely pick up a sixer of that if I see it. Always tough to buy a 22oz IPA since I can't guarantee I'll drink it soon enough.

CraftBeer,3bydno,Jonathan_DB,5,Fri Jul 3 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"For me it has really started to seem more like a hobby than anything else.   I don't really care about getting drunk as much as I used to, but I'm kind of obsessed with trying new beers. It has gotten to the point where I can only generate enthusiasm for things I've never tried before. When I go to the beer store my eyes only land on labels that I'm unfamiliar with. Sometimes I buy 6 packs and only drink one or two before getting bored with them and going to the store to buy something different. I've walked out of bars solely because there was nothing on the tap list that I hadn't tried yet, even though there was stuff on the list that I know I liked. Sometimes I see a great deal at the store and I think, ""Meh, that's an unbelievable price but I had a sixpack of those a couple months ago so I'll pass.""  Sometimes I feel kind of like a jerk when friends or family (who all know and share my love for craft beer and are only being generous and considerate) come around with new beers and the conversations go like this,   ""Hey night_owl, check out this cool new beer I found! Wanna taste?""   ""Oh thanks, but I'm good. I tried it at a festival/bar/brewery a few months ago. It's really good though, I think you'll like it.""   And I think to myself, ""when did I turn into such a buzzkill?  They were obviously going out of their way to share and present me with something that they think I'd be excited about and I just shot them down like a snob. Fuck me.""  I appreciate that they come around and try to expose me to new beers, because I absolutely LOVE sharing new experiences with the people I care about!  But somehow I seem to fuck it up because most of the time I have already beat them to the punch and it kind of lets the wind out of their sails because we are different terms now and we don't have the same experience of trying something new together.    I try to make up for it by being the guy who shows up to every BBQ or dinner party with plenty of bottles to share of rare/random/interesting stuff that NOBODY has every tried before."
CraftBeer,3bydno,night_owl,2,Fri Jul 3 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"I watched a video the other day of two brothers here in QC who do beer reviews. They were talking to a guy who, apparently, never drinks the same beer twice. I think that's crazy! What happens if you truly fall in love with a beer, but your principles state you can never try it again?"
CraftBeer,3bydno,night_owl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty crazy as well. I'm not principally against it, but I find very little enjoyment from drinking a beer a second time. Most of my pleasure comes from the aspect of getting a new experience, and how a beer can evolve from the first sip to the last. If I'm going for a run like to take in the evolving scenery on a long trail, not do laps around the track.   I guess it is like movies for me: Even if I liked it, unless it is REALLY REALLY exceptionally good or I feel like I missed something then I'm not really interested in another go-around. And even if it is good enough for a repeat performance, I will usually want to wait a while before taking it in again and I often have diminished returns which each subsequent experience until it no longer excites me at all.   Unless of course, enough time has passed and in that case it is often like tasting it again for the first time.   It's been well over a decade since I had a regular ""go-to"" beer that I liked enough to buy it on a regular basis.  I've often fallen in love with great beers, but they tend to be ones that are expensive or hard to acquire anyway so regular consumption is not a realistic option, or they are a style that doesn't lend well to being in regular rotation (I've had a lot of great imperial porters/stouts,  but I'm not regularly in the mood for imperial stouts, especially in the heat of the summer)  But at the same time I'm not a jerk about it either. If I'm thirsty and someone hands me a beer at a BBQ I won't refuse it because I've already ""check it off the list"""

CraftBeer,3bvir1,arcarsination,6,Thu Jul 2 15:17:56 2015 UTC,"Something might indeed be rotten in the state of Denmark when it comes to Small Town Brewing. I'm not here to defend them against all criticism or even to try and prove their ownership one way or the other.   That said, this article is still a biased piece of shit. It tries to mislead you by implying that if City Brewing in La Crosse makes Mike's Hard Lemonade and other ""malternatives"" then obviously NYFRB must be like them instead of actual beer. You know what else is brewed there by City? Beer. A decent amount of it, in fact. A different (non-La Crosse) City Brewing facility actually contract brews Boston Lager for Sam Adams.*  Author then builds on this by suggesting that the intricacies of brewing ""malternatives"" means a tiny operation like Small Town probably couldn't do it. Of course, that only matters if NYFRB isn't actually beer, and the article outright states that it doesn't know that. Not that facts matter as long as the insinuations generate clicks.  Look, I don't buy Small Town's hoaky stories about old recipe books either. And there's obviously a relationship with Phusion going on. That LLC filing looks pretty damning, I won't lie. What I haven't figured out definitively is if it's outright ownership or just providing marketing and distribution services.   But this article is still a rag, making unproven insinuations and trying to assassinate NYFRB's character by associating it with Mike's Hard Lemonade and Four Loko, pariahs which the craft beer community looks down upon.    Why the subterfuge?   Indeed.  *Side note: Know what else is labelled as a ""malt beverage""? KBS"
CraftBeer,3bvir1,Borimi,3,Thu Jul 2 15:31:19 2015 UTC,"Why the shadiness and the hiring of a high powered marketing firm, though? Whatever it is, they shouldn't be trying to conceal it. Once things are concealed, speculation and connecting of the dots ensues. I, for one, have a much easier time believing that this beverage is an artificially flavored alcoholic beverage, especially given the relationship and the deliberate attempt to hide the true ownership or partnership."
CraftBeer,3bvir1,mb20x2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:19:08 2015 UTC,"What's shady and what's being concealed, specifically? No, really, I'm serious.   Is it where NYFRB is brewed? I have a bottle of it at home right now, it says La Cross, WI on the label. Does it say City brewing as a contract producer? No. But I also have a bottle of Boston Lager in my house, which is also contract brewed by City, but in a PA facility. The Boston Lager says 'Breinigsville, PA"" on the label, but it doesn't say City Brewing, either. So if Small Town is being shady there, so is Sam Adams. Is it their partnership with Pabst and Phusion? If they're trying to conceal it they've done an awful job, as it's been known for some time to any person who took the time to google NYFRB. So long as NYFRB is simply getting a leg up on marketing and distribution, and isn't some astroturf trojan horse put out by Phusion (admittedly, that is possible), is such a relationship really so shady? Seems like a great, mutually beneficial way to make a boatload of money. If there is anything duplicitous here, it hasn't been proven yet. Why would hiring a marketing firm be shady? Do you really think no craft breweries ever hire marketing firms? Do you really expect breweries to shout their marketing agency, if any, from the rooftops to fulfill some ridiculous expectation of full disclosure? Are you aware that this Sard Verbinnen Marketing Co, the marketing firm for ""Wall-Street scoundrels"" (nice, fair reporting there) also represents Pabst Brewing. It's almost like Small Town formed an agreement to get access to Pabst's massive distribution network, which included work with their already affiliated marketing firm. OMG so shady!!!!111   Do you see how so much of that shadiness you're worried about is manufactured by what's said and not said in articles like the one I'm bitching about?"
CraftBeer,3bvir1,Borimi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, you really like the drink. I get it. But the snarky and sarcastic responses really aren't necessary.   The shadiness I am referring to:  A. When asked a question about the brewing process, not even the recipe, marketing firm jumps in and cuts the guy off. I get that you aren't going to give out the recipe (although it is quite easy to get the recipe for many popular craft beers on the market), but I think the question could have been answered without doing so, since that wasn't even what he was asking.  B. Sam Adams... not sure they should be held up as a representative of craft beer. The difference here, though, is that Sam Adams did start out as a small craft brewing, which over time grew into the monolith that it is today. They are not purporting to be a small craft brewery (and, I get that it is not proven) when they may very well be a product of another much larger operation (jury is out).  C. It's the affiliation with Phusion, which we don't exactly know what that is yet. It's shady if Phusion put this product out under the guise of it being a small craft brewer. I get that it's speculation, but it seems really odd that no one never heard of this and then all of the sudden it is ubiquitous. Not the usual path for a craft brew. I'm also not a big fan of brewers selling their distribution rights, but hey, it's not nearly as bad as selling out altogether. Again, though, it's really surprising that Pabst would decide so quickly to engage in that kind of partnership.  D. I didn't say hiring the marketing firm was shady. I asked why they would hire a high powered marketing firm. And, yes, I would venture a guess that craft breweries are not hiring wall street marketing firms. Not sure the cash flow is there to engage in such a relationship. However, if you they were owned by Phusion....  I fail to see the bias of the author. You are stating that he is doing this for click bait. That very well may be, only time will tell. Enjoy the root beers, just don't be too surprised about what it is made from and how it is made.  Remember, this is a craft beer subreddit, so the argument here is that they are not really a craft beer, and not what they say they are at all."
CraftBeer,3bvir1,mb20x2,4,Thu Jul 2 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"A. then blame the marketing firm.  B. The size of Sam Adams was irrelevant to the point, which was about transparency in their brewing process/location.  C. As with any beer, it was known to the people around where it was originally brewed (Wauconda, IL). I have family near there and they were telling me about it last Christmas. It became widely known when it became widely available, most likely because of its use of Pabst's network (and, likely, marketing). That doesn't seem odd to me at all, that seems like exactly what's supposed to happen.  D. If anything should have been clear about the ""high powered marketing firm"" it's that Small Town likely didn't hire them at all. The firm already had Pabst as a client. Pabst takes over distribution (and has since bought the Small Town brand, another openly available detail) and so this firm takes over the marketing."

CraftBeer,3bvdne,nactlax,3,Thu Jul 2 13:37:37 2015 UTC,"I have been on a big saison kick lately.   Saison's are farmhouse ales, which have a really broad range of flavors and ingredients, usually very effervescent, and occasionally almost champagne-y in thinness, but generally are gold in color and about 7% ABV.  They used to be brewed in winter time, for drinking in the summer.  They pretty much threw in whatever spices and flavorings they had sitting around the farm.  I am a huge fan of Hennepin by Ommegang.  Ommegang has national distribution so you should be able to find a bottle or two.  Many craft breweries are putting out saison's with some pretty out there spins.  From there, there is a huge spectrum of IPA's, DIPA's and triple IPA's.  Stouts, hefewiezens, oh just thinking about going back and tasting all these types of beers for the first time makes me very jealous.  Good luck, don't get too wasted."
CraftBeer,3bvdne,davidaaronstephenson,2,Thu Jul 2 14:00:01 2015 UTC,"It depends a lot on where you are (state) but I recommend getting singles of a bunch of different styles of beers. From German lagers, hefeweizen, saisons, fruit beers, amber, brown ale, porter, sours, and stouts. There are plenty of lists of beers to try here is one I found real quick http://www.listology.com/betaylor73/list/1001-beers-you-must-taste-you-die . Just focus on finding what you like and knowing what it is you don't like. If you do that it will make it much easier to try new beers without being discouraged by buying stuff that doesn't taste good to you."
CraftBeer,3bvdne,solovolk,2,Thu Jul 2 13:58:27 2015 UTC,"It depends what your palette prefers, though you can expect to see your palette grow as time goes on and you find new flavors. For instance, in my experience (my own included), people find it a challenge to like IPAs at the beginning, though I drink them all the time now.  If you like light beers, maybe start with Oskar Blues Mama's Little Yella Pils.   For a really drinkable beer that has a lower ABV, try a Breckenridge Vanilla Porter. It's heavier than what you're used to I'd guess, but it will expose you to something pointed in the darker/heavier direction without being overwhelming.  If you can find it, Big Sky's Moose Drool is a standard issue solid brown ale.  I would also consult your local beermonger to see if they have any recommendations. You might also consult the subreddit for your region if one exists. They can point you in the right direction for your local breweries."
CraftBeer,3bvdne,Themarc,2,Thu Jul 2 14:02:44 2015 UTC,"Find some easy drinkers first.  Many of my friend have been turned off tasting the huge beers I enjoy such as iipas, sours and stouts.  I highly recommend finding a good beer bar or brewery before you go drop a ton on bottles.  Do a tasting flight of all kinds...find one you like and have another taste of the same style.  Get to know what you like right now.  As you explore your taste will change and you will find you want more robust beer.  Start with wheats (because that's whats what Oberon is.) Maybe try some pale ales, ambers or browns.  Even a Porter if you want to try dark and roasty.  Don't base opinions off beer advocate or ratebeer ""scores"" but use them as a sign that people like it, not that its better.  Happy drinking!!! Seriously...visit a bar or brewery before buying bottles."
CraftBeer,3bvdne,scgt86,2,Thu Jul 2 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"First thing you need to do is learn the different styles of beer. You don't have to geek out on it, just learn the basics. This is how you will figure out what you like and in turn what beers to try next. Oberon is a wheat beer. Other beers you may have tried that are the same style are shock top and Blue Moon. That style varies a LOT and you can have a lot of fun just seeing all the different variations of wheat beers. That is just one style. Your regular domestic beers like bud light would fall under the lager/Pilsner category and those will usually be very light crisp. And so on and so forth with the different styles. It is really hard to recommend any beer to someone unless you know what they like. In order to figure out what styles you like you should try a few different usual suspects from each style. Tell us where younger located and we can recommend some good examples in your area and then once you start to figure out your tastes you will really be able to get good recommendations that you can appreciate.   Source: I work in a store introducing people to craft beer everyday. This approach works very well for me in helping people to discover their craft beer identity. Beer and beer styles are much more nuanced than I portray here. This is just a general idea to get started."

Really well crafted beer. No. It's not blow your mind crazy with exotic ingredients. And, I think that's what I like. I can get that elsewhere. I go here for a killer ESB, Kolsch, Wit and Pale Ale. I also have really enjoyed some of their ""test batch"" brews. Had a great double IPA last month. The style I'm most critical of."

You'll have to find someone there who will send you some or make the pilgrimage yourself.   It really is delicious; but while it used to be head-and-shoulders above its competition, the gap has gotten increasingly narrow over the years and it's no longer so much better than many DIPAs made all over the place that it's worth going to great lengths to get a hold of. Not that I could make suggestions for what you might be able to find in Metro-Detroit, but there are several other great hoppy beers brewed in MA where I live that I no longer feel the need to trek up to Vermont to drink Heady. I assume that's probably true most places these days."

Favorites from Treehouse are Julius and Green, Favorite from Trillium is Melcher Street but both breweries do hoppy beers super well. Well, they both do several things very well. I also like the hoppy beers from Night Shift well enough (though I don't like much else that they make, but this may be an unpopular opinion) and I quite like Pretty Things' Meadowlark also."

CraftBeer,3bftor,guybehindawall,4,Sun Jun 28 21:39:36 2015 UTC,You can only get it in VT. We got cases at a distributor and got there 45 minutes before they opened because a line forms up really fast. I think (at least for the one I went to) only got Heady on Tuesdays and Thursday's. If you are one of the first 15 people or so you can get a full case. I remember putting them in the car and people were asking for a four pack for 26 bucks. It's ridiculous. Also if you make it up to Vermont try and go to Hill Farmstead. They are located in VT and have amazing Saisons and nice IPA's.

It's a really good DIPA for sure, and the beer that got me into drinking IPAs. But, living in CT/MA there's so many others that are easier to get,  like Sixpoint's Resin and Tree House's Haze, that it's really just a better idea to grab one of those or something similar. I want to say that a good portion of the hype is due to the fact that it's so hard to get. It's worth trying once, but at this point I'd rather go down to my local package store and grab a six of Resin, or drive 10 minutes to Back East's brewery and get a growler of Palate Mallet."

CraftBeer,3bd4zu,aswespiral,5,Sun Jun 28 02:22:38 2015 UTC,"Well the tricky part is gettign the right combo. I'm being blunt here. That's the hard part.   People assume that someone drinking beer the first time wants something light. That's just not fair.   I would set up a tasting of 8 beers. 4 safe and 4 risky. none of them would be big brand names and I wouldn't tell anyone any names.   So my picks would be   Safe beers- Allagash White, Founders All Day IPA, Brooklyn Lager, Rogue Dead Guy Ale, Victory Prima Pils, Sierra Pale and a few others. They're all beers that are incredibly well made. But their flavors are pretty simple.   Risky beers is where you'll find things like Arrogant Bastard, Ommegang Three Philosophers, North Coast's Old Rasputin. Oscar Blues Ten Fidy so on so forth. More flavor aggressive ales.   I think the key is to have a variety, and to describe each beer before tasting. This is a pale ale, it has flavors from the hops similar to citrus/pine/grass/whatever they are. It also has a little hint of sweetness from the barley. People will then look for those flavors when tasting and it won't just be ""a beer"" it will be more of an adventure."
CraftBeer,3bd4zu,bossmt_2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:02:04 2015 UTC,"What I've picked so far: Astra, La fin du monde, smuttynose old brown dog, tyranena blackhawk Porter and a Pacific coast cider. I'd like to get a solid stout, IPA, sour, and maybe a rye. I'm going to give them sheets with the names and open spaces titled ""Color, aroma, mouthfeel and taste"". I'll also be printing out sheets with descriptions and information on each from beer advocate. I don't know if I'll give them out before or after the actual tasting. I don't want to sway their original thoughts on each before they even try them. This will definitely be a learning experience for myself as well, I'm pretty excited for it."

Snag your number when you get there and A) Hang out with everyone else waiting for beer or B) Hit up Westview Farms just a minute away for fresh ice cream, sandwiches and other food.   Also, right now you can not buy pints until their new tasting room is completed. And, you have to buy their growlers to fill. You can not bring another breweries growlers to use.

CraftBeer,3b97aa,Jonstrocity,2,Sat Jun 27 23:14:02 2015 UTC,Just checked their website and the staycation is their summer brew. They have a hop delusion that is on rotation

CraftBeer,3b8px4,kevski82,2,Sat Jun 27 07:22:12 2015 UTC,"Siren have an excellent core range, and do some awesome small releases and collaborations. I'd recommend Undercurrent oatmeal pale ale,  Broken Steam breakfast stout and Shattered Dream, it's big brother. I've only been disappointed by two of their beers; Soundwave and Das Soundwave - English and German hopped IPAs respectively.   Buxton are equally excellent, again making a lot of beer in addition to a good core range. Axe Edge is an excellent IPA, and their Far Skyline berlinerweisse is one of my favourite beers.   Also, Wild Beer Co who make a lot of crazy beer foraged ingredients. The oddest one I can think of the top of my head is Tom Yum Gose. Evolver, a bretted (I think) IPA designed to develop over time, rather than fade out, is really cool. They made two milk stouts - Millionaire and Yankee Sandwich - that I loved. A ton of great sours and saisons as well.   Those are my favourites. Other really good British breweries to look out for : The Kernel, Beavertown, Magic Rock, Marble, Bristol Beer Factory, Tiny Rebel, Brew By Numbers, Cromarty, Roosters, Anspach & Hobday, Hammerton, Savour, Dark Star, Burning Sky, Fyne, Ilkley, Summer Wine, Weird Beard.   The best way to find good stuff is go to good beer bars or bottleshops and ask the staff for recommendations."

Orpheus, Monday night, and red brick are all choice breweries for me. Hop City and Ale Yeah! Are the go to bottle shops. But if they don't visit the Brick Store pub or the Porter then they fail ATL beer. These are consistently ranked as two of the best bars in the world and their cellar lists may induce orgasms."

Terrapin in Athens is alright (not my favorite but a lot of people around here like it). Also Three Taverns has some good stuff and I've heard Second Self is in the top 5 of Atlanta beer.  EDIT He can do Monday Night, Red Brick and Second Self all in one trip. They are all right down the street from each other."

Monday Night is pretty good as well. Depending on where you're from, there are a few cool gems from outside the area that you can snag in Atlanta: 21st Amendment, Cigar City, Ballast Point,  and Allagash. IIRC, I think the name of the store I really liked was Greene's, but I'll check in a bit and update once I find out. They offered a cash discount on purchases."

In my experience...depending on who you trade with Heady takes 2-3 FRESH Pliny.  Try to get hands on Pliny first before offering them on /r/beertrade. It is completely normal for the person to ask you to ship first during your first trade.

CraftBeer,3ap86h,Jyrchi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"Pime Öö PX. It's exquisitely layered, and very sweet. Almost like alcoholic maple syrup with hints of coffee, vanilla, cream, sherry, and even a little Scotch smoke. Too bad it's so limited, though I picked up a few bottles for special occasions. The regular edition of Pime Öö is really great too. I had it on draft at their brewpub a month ago, and there should be another batch out in December."

It is not meant to be spelled out as ‘India Pale Ale’ when used in the context of a Specialty IPA. None of these beers ever historically went to India, and many aren’t pale. But the craft beer market knows what to expect in balance when a beer is described as an ‘IPA’ – so the modifiers used to differentiate them are based on that concept alone."""

They're all almost always old when I check them, which is a shame.  Peeper seems to be the only common one with enough turnover around here.  As a semi-related aside.

CraftBeer,3aggy8,JGuR,4,Fri Jun 19 23:18:16 2015 UTC,This beer is the deity I pray to every chance I get.
CraftBeer,3aggy8,CammysComicCorner,2,Fri Jun 19 23:35:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This beer is quite possibly the finest, most complex, and well executed beer I've ever put in my mouth. So many flavors and aromas. It makes me feel like a giddy schoolgirl."
CraftBeer,3aggy8,cmrncstn,2,Sat Jun 20 00:58:51 2015 UTC,Is it a black IPA? Care to describe it?
CraftBeer,3aggy8,PurposedPorpoise,2,Sat Jun 20 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"It's styled as an ""export stout"". Not a common style that every brewhouse is pumping out. My tasting notes contain aromas of black pepper, curry, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon, and raisin undertones. Flavors of sweet and deep spice. Think of a creamy chocolate curry or even a Mexican mole sauce with strong black pepper, chile, and a cinnamon like finish. Body or mouthfeel of a silky smooth stout up front with a crisp carbonated finish that helps wash/cleanse the palate. Ultimately a very heavy flavored beer with a surprising medium body. Not refreshing at all. It's an onslaught of flavors and aromas that even trained palates have trouble with. I find it a challenge each time I have one and a great palate training experience. Sip slowly from a tulip glass from cool up to room temperature for the fullest effect. It's ultimately one of my favorite beers I've ever tasted and I find new flavors and aromas with each batch I've had. Truly a work of art that is executed with a subtle attention to the finest detail. I hope my notes can help guide you through one of the beers that is the epitome of what we consider ""craft"" beer. Cheers!  Tldr; just find some at all costs so you can say you tasted one of the most unique and wonderfully complex and challenging beers ever made."
CraftBeer,3aggy8,cmrncstn,2,Sat Jun 20 22:07:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response! Unfortunately I live in Canada so I'll have to go to the states to get it, but it sounds right up my alley. I love weird, challenging beers."
CraftBeer,3aggy8,PurposedPorpoise,2,Sat Jun 20 23:01:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I live in Texas and can rarely find it. Maybe think of contacting op through a pm and see if there's a possible mail swap you guys could set up. I've done many mail trades with friends, and even a few redditors in the past. It can be a bit pricey to ship due to the weight of bottles at times but if you have the means and patience, I'm sure some kind person out there would be willing to be a mailbeer buddy. Especially if there's interesting or rare stuff that you have access to and we Americans dont. Good luck and cheers my fellow knurd."

It is most definitely not for everyone though and is to be drank in small portions. With that said I killed the whole bomber last time I had it.

CraftBeer,3ah3yo,dd3mon,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:22:28 2015 UTC,"I'll decide on a style or a few styles that I'm in the mood for and that usually narrows it down a bunch.  From there it depends on the brands.  Do I want something from someone I've tried or do I want to take a chance on someone new?    I like most beers, so I rarely regret trying something new."
CraftBeer,3ah3yo,DarthMaillard,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:10:58 2015 UTC,"Research! It's boring, it's tedious but it's the only way to find out what is good and what is bad and when it is coming out.

CraftBeer,3adi8k,zeile33,0,Fri Jun 19 17:27:26 2015 UTC,Why is triple ipa a style?  Isn't it just a barleywine at that point?  Imperial imperial India pale ale doesn't make sense lol

CraftBeer,3a6pqv,sevenzig,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:23:27 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a mix of being in an urban location and the beer being a hot commodity. Bottle shops, especially liquor stores, tend to price gouge, more for the rarer stuff. I live in CA and can readily find TONS of nationally-coveted beers (i.e. Russian River, Firestone-Walker, Rare Barrel, Societe, Alesmith) but the prices are still relatively high like ~$15-25 a 22oz. This is too pricey for me, so I rarely get to try them except if I luck out and someone brings one to a bottleshare."
CraftBeer,3a6pqv,TurniptheLed,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:40:40 2015 UTC,yeah i guess it could be but i feel like NYC is taking advantage of it more.

CraftBeer,3a6pqv,Eurynom0s,3,Wed Jun 17 18:39:12 2015 UTC,"How much less could you get it for in Connecticut? Unless you're talking something like half as much, it seems likely that it's just ""we're trying to pay the rent"".   Also, I've noticed wherever I've lived that you'll randomly find one store selling one brand for a lot more than other stores in the nearby area, which I'm guessing is likely to mean that their distributor pulled a price out of their ass to see if it would stick and/or that their distributor is overall screwing them and they're trying to charge extra for what they think people will pay extra for to compensate.  [edit]Oh, you were in Grand Central. Of course you overpaid, rents are going to be very high there even by Manhattan standards--they're going to have to charge accordingly to make any kind of a profit."
CraftBeer,3a6pqv,scgt86,5,Thu Jun 18 02:11:53 2015 UTC,"I walked into a store in SoCal and saw FW18, Sucuba, merkin and ddba for 35.99.

CraftBeer,3a6pqv,Eurynom0s,0,Thu Jun 18 02:04:51 2015 UTC,Probably worth noting that Sucaba apparently isn't normally distributed in NYC: http://www.firestonebeer.com/find/index.php?zip=10025&miles=25&brand=Sucaba  You'd probably have to spend more than $20 getting back and forth from NJ just to buy the beer.

CraftBeer,3a6pqv,Eurynom0s,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"Bottle and draft distribution are presumably not the same, though, and I'm assuming they're talking about bottles on the Firestone site since all the language is about ""can't find it or it isn't at your favorite store?"" and ""Watch for bottled on dates located on the necks of our beers.""  The fact that you can get it on draft at bars wouldn't seem to really to inherently have anything to do with whether you can find a bottle of it at a reasonable price."
CraftBeer,3a6pqv,robert-goulet,2,Thu Jun 18 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"All of those places had bottles and/or tap and are in NYC.  Additionally all are legitimate sellers.  Top Hops had bottles for sale on Feb 17, 2015.  Edit:  I was unnecessarily harsh in my initial answer.  Sorry about that."
CraftBeer,3a6pqv,robert-goulet,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:46:47 2015 UTC,I listed several bars and stores that have it for sale in bottle.  I listed one that had it for sale on tap.

I just got a bottle the other day actually. But yeah, if you go to Silverlake Liquor you're gonna over pay (but they'll always have the good stuff), but if you hunt you will find the deals.   The store you walked into relies on people that don't have the time or care to hunt for deals and/or have the money to drop and don't know better. It's not gouging though.

CraftBeer,3a6pqv,DiarrheaHamburger,2,Wed Jun 17 18:33:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, I just made another post but being in Grand Central says it all. I've got to imagine that the rent on a store in Grand Central is astronomical even by Manhattan standards."
CraftBeer,3a6pqv,bodobeers,2,Thu Jun 18 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"You also have to remember that different places pay different amounts from the distributor if they're not paying for the top deal. I'm not saying that was the case at this store, but retailers get a discount for buying 5 or 10 or 20 cases at a time versus 1 or 2. If the store buy 1 or 2 cases of something from the distributor maybe it comes in at $60, but if they buy 10 it might drop the cost to $48 per case, therefore they are going to charge you much less.  You mostly see this with larger breweries. A small corner deli might be charging $24.99 for a Bud Light 30pk because they only have room to keep 30 in the store at a time, but total wines down the street has a warehouse sized back room, so they can buy 225 cases at a time and can sell it for $21.99."
CraftBeer,3a6pqv,Diegodangers,2,Wed Jun 17 22:46:14 2015 UTC,"I notice it also, many places i think are forced to raise prices due to the retail rents going SO high in NYC especially in Manhattan. Also then some are riding the ""hype"" and trying to maximize their profit. I think as more places compete it will level out, but yah more of a NYC thing than a craft beer ""rip people off"" thing I think.  But there are many bars that totally overcharge for pints, but then when you compare it to the price of a mixed drink it's still cheaper than those so I guess we beer drinkers are kind of spoiled in that regard. 9-12 pint or 14 dollar martini :P"

CraftBeer,3a58e0,nevinem,7,Wed Jun 17 14:29:57 2015 UTC,"Ouch not really a good article. This history doesn't explain why the canning industry became successful or any good footnotes in history and is filled with opinion. Also to miss Bill Coors in this history is a tragedy. Bill Coors was a princeton trained chemical engineer who introduced the 7oz aluminum can into his fathers brewery in 1959 (process and can of his own design). He is credited with pioneering the recyclable two-piece aluminum can, which is now standard throughout the industry. By 1963 with the introduction of the pull tab can, aluminum had supplanted tin, which dissolved into beer. By the early 1960s, can recycling was viable, and the company offered customers a one-cent deposit on returned cans. The man created the concept of recycling cans and sustainibility within the beer (and beverage) industry. This is one of two main reasons big beer was 8 out of 10 beers consumed by the end of that decade (along with the shipping industry allowing further distribution). Info from wiki, The Audactiy of Hops, and Mother Nature Network."

CraftBeer,3a1wrz,Lloyd--Christmas,3,Wed Jun 17 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"I am surprised that while talking about lagers nobody mentioned baltic porters. Here in Poland, where I live, baltic porter is a style we are all really proud of (at least the beer geeks community). More and more small regional and craft breweries brew their own interpretations of the style. Barell aged, smoked, hopped with american hops or even sour versions. I do really hope that baltic porter will get more recognition. While it is usually not as roasty as an imperial stout it can be equally complex in flavour."
CraftBeer,3a1wrz,TheKahuna,2,Thu Jun 18 11:43:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. We are starting to see this happening here in Vancouver, BC. Arguably the craft beer mecca of Canada to date."

CraftBeer,3a1wrz,rockart_ridgerunner,2,Tue Jun 16 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"We just had a huge homebrew competition in VT and my good friend from college won with a Schwarzbier, ""Salute Your Schwarz"" (I asked what he was going to name it before hand and he said ""Spaceballz was low hanging fruit"").  As a result of winning, the folks who ran the competition, 14th Star and Winooski Beverage, are canning it and selling it throughout VT.  They are also doing a limited batch of the runner ups.  Really pumped for my friend but more importantly, it sounds like they will run it for awhile, it will be easy to ship and it was fucking fantastic.  Think Saranac Black Forest before the corporate take over.  Let me know if you need to get access to this, I expect it to be out by the beginning of August."

CraftBeer,39ys6w,NateMac13,3,Mon Jun 15 21:57:27 2015 UTC,Crooked Stave bottles you'll find the best selection at the tap room.   Best beer shop in Denver (IMHO) is Mr. B's at 22nd and Market.

CraftBeer,39ys6w,cerebral_decay,2,Tue Jun 16 03:34:38 2015 UTC,In Fort Collins your best bets will be Supermarket Liquors or 287 Liquors.  Haven't seen any Russian River in town lately but Crooked Stave and Funkwerks are plentiful at both places.
CraftBeer,39ys6w,WikenwIken,2,Tue Jun 16 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"You'll have tough luck getting your hands on bottles of Russian River in Colorado (although we do occasionally get some so it's possible if you're lucky). Crooked Stave and Funkwerks are plentifully stocked at my local store south of Denver so I would hope some bigger stores in FoCo/Denver would be the same.   I'm not sure what's available to you out in Illinois, but I would recommend picking up some Great Divide Brewing Co. (Yeti and any oak aged yeti especially), Oskar Blues Brewery (Dale's Pale Ale and Old Chub are great), Avery Brewing Company (Maharaja &/or any barrel aged series are great), Odell Brewing Company (Myrcenary double IPA is the shit). Left Hand Brewery also makes some good stuff (Milk Stout/Milk Stout Nitro are most popular and delicious).  If all of these are readily available in Illinois I'd recommend looking for Eddyline Brewery - River Runners Pale Ale, Bristol Brewing Company - Compass IPA, Dry Dock Brewery - Hefeweizen (Apricot Blonde Ale is probably the most popular. It's good but I think over rated), Upslope Brewing Company - Brown Ale (One of my favorites of all time), Telluride Brewing Company - Face Down Brown (Pretty highly acclaimed, I prefer Upslope's brown), Epic Brewing Company - Escape to Colorado IPA (I would also recommend Hop Syndrome for a refreshingly crisp hoppy lager).  Hopefully you got some ideas from this, a lot of these are really huge in Denver, but I'm not sure what you have access to in Illinois. Crooked Stave and Funkwerks are definitely must haves (particularly Crooked Stave who makes some of the best sours I've ever had). Both breweries are very unique in my opinion, the other breweries I mentioned make good stuff, but a lot of standard stuff (not that there's anything wrong with that, I love it)."

I love Mercenary, it's always on the list to pick up out there. Thanks for the suggestions!"

CraftBeer,39xbz1,AgDrumma07,-1,Mon Jun 15 18:13:06 2015 UTC,Don't age it! It just gets worse. Even says so on the bottle. Age lambics not adjunct stouts.
CraftBeer,39xbz1,Purp,2,Mon Jun 15 23:58:28 2015 UTC,"Got a link or proof?  This article seems to disagree with you and I can't find anything on the label that says to avoid aging.  Besides, 6-12 months isn't going to do much and beers don't age as fast in the fridge."
CraftBeer,39xbz1,AgDrumma07,2,Tue Jun 16 12:10:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, tons of people age KBS, it's ridiculous to say it gets worse with all of the information out there on aged KBS."
CraftBeer,39xbz1,solovolk,2,Wed Jun 17 13:13:18 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It may smooth out the coffee flavor but it will by no means ruin the beer.
CraftBeer,39xbz1,AgDrumma07,2,Wed Jun 17 13:17:16 2015 UTC,"This, seriously. KBS is a coffee based beer. I sure I will be down voted for this but, I didn't like it and if you let the coffee age the point of KBS is smoothered.

Hell, I have probably 15 full cases of beer in my little apartment, and I am constantly shifting bottles from boxes to the fridge, but those boxes fill back up pretty quickly, much more quickly than the fridge empties out.

CraftBeer,39hacq,tallboybrews,13,Thu Jun 11 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"I posted this a couple years back when someone asked a similar question.  I believe my advice still stands;  I have a friend who owns a successful microbrewery. It started out similarly to your story, just a couple guys making beer in a basement and then dumping all their money into the wind and hoping they were good enough to cut it.  I had a long conversation with him, as my brother and I were considering opening a brewery. He said we absolutely had a product that could make it into the industry and I ultimately decided just to sell him my brewing notes and now I take a small cut of their business instead of going it by myself. His words about how the business process worked turned me off completely to opening my own brewery. I'll try and echo some of the process to you here.  First off, it took them nearly 7 years to gain profitability. They came dangerously close to having to shut down many times along that road. You have to understand that this business is cut throat, especially if you're trying to distribute. Are you trying to make a distributing brewery or are you trying to make a brewpub? (Brewpub has it's own issues I could explain to you if you'd like).  The startup costs are going to be very high. I'm not sure how you're planning on getting the capital, but you can safely assume with equipment, warehouse/bar, licensing, ingredients, that your upstart cost will be somewhere between $500,000-1M. Possibly less or more depending on where you are locating. You should absolutely NOT buy brand new equipment, there are tons of breweries that have started and failed who sell off their old stuff for considerably less.  The industry in most states is heavily lopsided toward macrobrewers in the distributing end. Around me the big three all own the distribution networks, and the costs of breaking into this network are high and there are lots of legal barriers. While recently some places have made the distribution easier, it will add a significant cost to the end of the line. Your beers will be probably located on the bottom or side of the cooler and cost 2 to 3 times more than bud or something. You really need to make an effort to get your name out there to make people buy your beer over the other micros that may be stocked.  Product placement aside, a lot of breweries spend a good amount of time coming up with catchy names to brand something unique. But packaging gets expensive quickly, especially if you're using very colorful and heavy packaging. My friends business started off without a labeling machine because they couldn't afford it. It turned out to be a godsend once the beers took off.  Now consider the competition in your area. You're going to need to create a beer that will stand on it's own. I don't know if you have certain styles in mind, but so many microbrewers fail because they make a good IPA. Anyone can make a good IPA. You're going to need to have a diverse menu of beers, and they will all have to be top notch. If you scope out the other brewers in the area, you'll find out what they are good at and what you can do better than them.  Licensing will be your biggest pain in the ass, at least in my state it is. It's a huge hurdle, and a major expense every year. If you're going to operate a bar at your brewery you'll need to get the proper licensing for that too. I strongly suggest you find a lawyer who has experience in the alcoholic beverage industry for this. A bar can be a great thing to have, but it can also be a big liability since you're serving.  That said. My friend originally opened up the brewery without a bar. This was done to save costs. They currently distribute beer to bars and have three types available in stores in bottles. He says this was his biggest downfall right from the get-go. The bar is now the biggest profit earner in the cards, it's always incredibly busy, and they don't even offer food. They barely make anything on distributing beers, whereas they can charge full price at the brewery and save themselves money.  This business will take a toll on you personally and you'll be spending many many hours working/slaving away with the beers. If you can enlist the help of a experienced brewmaster, I would suggest you do that right away. It may be expensive, but it'll save you time, ingredients, and ultimately money. You'll have to learn to deal with the ups and downs of the alcoholic beverage industry, in my state it's not like any other industry legally.  If you have any questions, ask away. I have learned a lot about this industry by being around my friend and his business. I wish you guys luck with this, but I am forewarning you that this is not an easy road with beer rivers flowing down either side. This is a expensive and demanding business. The microbrewing industry has seen lots of great individual brewers fail. But there are success stories amongst the fallen. You'll need to be at every event you can putting your beer out. You'll need to be making beer at 5am and not stopping until 6pm. You'll need to hire as few people as possible to keep costs down at first. You will be busy, and you will be broke most of the time. Like I said I don't know how much you have to invest, but my friends business was built by taking loans, maxing out credit cards, and doing all the labor themselves. I hope you take the time to consider how this will change your life for the next few years. Just because you love beer doesn't mean you should start a brewery, but you seem to have the gusto in you to try. It's risky as hell, but if you play your hand properly you can succeed.  Good luck."
CraftBeer,39hacq,jgopp,2,Thu Jun 11 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"Great post, thanks. Mind revealing your friends brewery's name? Perhaps could help his business some."
CraftBeer,39hacq,audiguy7,2,Thu Jun 11 21:26:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your input it is very helpful and lots of good information here. I think the reason the responsibility and massive hurdles/headaches don't scare me is because I'm not someone who wants to get their beer out there. I'm someone who wants to take on a business and be in control of my own life/fate. I love beer and the process involved but I'm not some long term veteran in the hobby, I'm someone who wants to be involved and contribute in a community that I perceive as positive and community-centric. I will certainly be enlisting the help of an experienced brewmaster. I will be funding the startup through investors. I don't mind the issues around licensing, permitting, finance, marketing, accounting, etc as these are all challenges I'll embrace and work through when the time comes.  My vision, at least as a preliminary goal, is to have a small brewery with a taproom. Not a full on bar or food service, just something simple. The goal will be to sell to surrounding restaurants and to promote the business locally to build a foundation. I have two locations in mind (one in a large suburb that has a population that will exceed 1,000,000 - and that of it's connected 'larger' city - and only currently has 3 brewery/brewpubs to my knowledge at this point), and another in a more rural community of about 8,000 people that has one brewery. Obviously the market would be easier to tap into in the larger setting, but the 8,000 people town is a big tourist spot and I'd assuming leasing would be MUCH cheaper.  I'm definitely in the preliminary stages of conceptualizing at this point and only want to lay the groundwork to allow myself to one day realize this dream, but I believe that doing is better than waiting if I'm going to make it happen in the long run. Especially if it is something that I'm completely set on."
CraftBeer,39hacq,jgopp,2,Thu Jun 11 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"You sound pretty upbeat about the project, but let me help you with some constructive pointers... (I own a business now myself, not in the brewing industry, but I'll go on what I know about my own business and my friends brewery).    I'm someone who wants to take on a business and be in control of my own life/fate. I love beer and the process involved but I'm not some long term veteran in the hobby>    So what exactly do you currently know about brewing and the industry?  It's an industry really like not too many others, it's unique in its challenges because it has so many regulations.  Knowing at least how to brew and what exactly goes into the process is also extremely important. To me it sounds like you just want to start a brewery with a brewer and let them take care of the product.  What is the overall vision of the beer you're attempting to brew?  Why should we be drinking your beer over any others I can buy?  Basically I'm asking what's the hook and draw of your place and your beers?   The goal will be to sell to surrounding restaurants and to promote the business locally to build a foundation.   I don't know what state you live in, but in most states this would be illegal.  You will have to do business with a distributor -the main ones are run by Bud, Miller, Coors- to get your beer into restaurants.  The whole system is extremely annoying to work with if you want to sell your beer anywhere else but your own brewery (which you'd never recoup the costs at the size/format you're imagining).     I will be funding the startup through investors.   Do you have investors already lined up?  If you do, are they aware of the challenges in the brewing industry?  Maybe you've got a lot of friends willing to help finance, but what happens if you burn through the initial capital faster than expected?  Are you willing to put up your house as collateral for a loan from a bank?  /u/Southern_Draw already has pointed out that it may be 3,4,5x more than you're initially expecting, and you can never account for the unforeseen issues that may arise.     I'm definitely in the preliminary stages of conceptualizing at this point    You really need to think about this decision long and hard.  It's not a challenge everyone is fit for.  You need to familiarize yourself with local regulations, state laws, and federal alcohol laws and taxes.  I would highly recommend you speak to a lawyer before you even begin to draw up a business plan to get to understand everything.  Having a solid business plan will be the most important thing if you're trying to source investment money.    Anyway, I'm not trying to make you change your mind.  I'm just hoping you do all the research you possibly can, and speak to the right people who can help you along the way.  I kind of softballed the questions for you, any real investor is going to want hard answers to their direct and sometimes uncomfortable questions.   Cheers."

I want to be involved in the brewing, but I don't want to be the head. I haven't worked in a commercial brewery before so I am homebrewing as much as possible to be able to contribute, collaborate and develop high quality product. I do not want to just mass produce a brown, a blonde and an IPA and put it out there. I do want high quality versions of each of these, and I want to develop a couple of creative, unique beers that will keep people coming back. Beer is only one, albeit large, point in my vision though. I want to develop an open community based gathering spot. Somewhere people want to come to socialize with the community and feel welcome to bring their family, dates, dogs, whatever they feel like.

I'm very much aware that the costs will be astronomical and I'm already thinking about possibly starting out in more of a nano to begin with. Will have to evaluate when I get to putting together a business plan.   Anyway, I'm not trying to make you change your mind.   Of course! I'm not looking to get a bunch of encouragement, I'm looking to get valuable insight and information which you're giving to me and I'm very appreciative of! I have a TON of research to go, but I'm not discouraged. To me, all of the shit times seem to be at the beginning of opening the business. No one that I've encountered has been said anything about hating their life/job now that they run a successful brewery. I can whole heartedly say that I am not happy at my current job and I would be even less happy if I were promoted to any other position in my company. For this reason, I am extremely motivated to start a brewery, because I know that once it is established and the wheels are turning, I will have a much better life than I do now."
CraftBeer,39hacq,Southern_Draw,3,Fri Jun 12 04:15:14 2015 UTC,"My co-founders open this coming November (2015).  We have a marketing guy, a head brewery/chemical engineer, a facilities/chemical processing expert, and a securities lawyer.  We also have a few consultants that have operated commercial breweries and commercial kitchens.  I would recommend the podcast ""how to start up a start up"" as a good place to begin. Its about 20 hours and jammed with good ideas about conceptualizing, building and growing a business. Its mostly tech sector, but the broad points are applicable to all business.  also, the brewery will be at 3-4x more expensive than you thought.  Our initial capital contribution plus loan was estimated at $230-250k.  We ended up needing to raise about $910k.  It took us three years from the point of conceptualization to the point of signing checks, the lease, and the note for the loan. Then the slab gets poured and we wait another 5-6 months before we can install the brew system.  The brew system build time is 100 days so you have to order it before or at the time the lease is signed if you don't want to be paying rent on an empty building.  Also, gauging the size and number of fermenters and bright tanks is tough.  Retrofitting an existing facility is just as expensive if not more expensive than building a custom facility for your needs.  competition is high, but the market still has some room. The local scene is the hot scene right now.  brewing is the most important job, but the business requires full time attention to grow as it should. best luck."
CraftBeer,39hacq,itsme_timd,2,Thu Jun 11 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, it is very much appreciated. I haven't worked on numbers or anything at this point, but I am very aware of the extreme costs that it will take. I read a blog of a local brewery that Estimated about $300,000 to retrofit a building they chose, and it ended up costing them over $900,000, so yeah 3-4x expected seems about right. However, despite all of this, they expect to be profitable by the 3 year mark which I would call a huge success!   I'll certainly check out the podcast! It must be torturous to wait 5-6 months waiting for concrete to dry essentially! I guess it's all just part of the game!"
CraftBeer,39hacq,NathanPierce,2,Thu Jun 11 22:05:53 2015 UTC,"No doubt its a long wait, but it is not frustrating. I am starting to wish I had maybe a little more time.  It takes about 18 days to complete a beer, so we will be brewing like maniacs for the month leading up to the grand opening.  One of the most salient pieces of advice in the podcast I referenced was that to truly succeed in any industry you must learn all you can about it.  I have started reading all I can about beer, the history of brewing, modern techniques, and a lot of high level scientific stuff about each of the 4 ingredients (which also involves a lot of googling because I don't always have a baseline of information to even start comprehending).  Best luck to you, and please post once you get open. My cofounders go on a beer trip twice a year and would love to visit your facility and have you over to ours once you are up and running."

In my opinion, the beer is the most important thing. Good beer is good beer, be it from a big company's stainless tank or the local guy down the street."
CraftBeer,39bh12,StephenFish,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:52:27 2015 UTC,"I see it as those that treat it as a craft or an art form, not a way to turn a profit.  It's much like paintings or music:  sure, you can make money from them but artists don't start making art for the money.  It's usually out of passion and the money comes later if you're good at what you do.  This, to me, separates macro from craft."
CraftBeer,39bh12,Dzyngrl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:10:49 2015 UTC,"The Brewers Association (https://www.brewersassociation.org/brewers-association/purpose/) defines what a craft brewery is. When USA Today reported about the ""top"" craft beers it was based on sales and volume. It's not a list based on taste or consumer votes. But I can see why some folks get upset about it because they don't understand these caveats."
CraftBeer,39bh12,Khraine,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"My problem with their definition is they are focused on small. They want to keep craft micro essentially. Craft bee itself has turned into one of the ""buzz words"" now.  Much like in networking ""ccna!"" Used to mean a lot. Now it's more of a ""o ok, but are you actually good"".  Which is what craft beer is turning into. There are macro craft beers that great, others bad. Some micro craft beer is terrrrrible but because they are just 4 guys and some hops it's craft beer! That's the main challenge with defining craft beer. How do you keep it ""good"" to keep the name.  I like what several of the new comer programs like craft brewers association as an example is doing. But I cant vote for ""just keepin it small"" on the same side I can't vote for the ""but we have been using the same craft formula since we poisoned indians"" either."

Yuengling is just another macro; the only reason they're classified as Craft is output volume.  I appreciate the need to keep Sam Adams in the craft category, but there's probably better ways to do that than to say anything under X million barrels. How about adding ""and has more than X percentage of their output in small batch or seasonal recipes""?"
CraftBeer,39bh12,AlphaAnt,4,Wed Jun 10 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"The article notes that the reason they're now called ""craft"" isn't because of volume, but because the craft classification now allows beers to contain adjunct like corn, rice and syrups to enhance flavor."
CraftBeer,39bh12,FapManGoo,3,Wed Jun 10 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"Adjuncts are not necessarily a bad thing; I never had a problem with that. There's no reason a beer made from rye or sorghum should be excluded because there's no barley.  However, when a brewery functions like a macro (which Yuengling does) they shouldn't be classified as craft. I hope they tighten the definition to account for that."

Beer production is attributed to the rules of alternating proprietorships. * Independent: Less than 25 percent of the craft brewery is owned or controlled (or equivalent economic interest) by a beverage alcohol industry member that is not itself a craft brewer. * Traditional: A brewer that has a majority of its total beverage alcohol volume in beers whose flavor derives from traditional or innovative brewing ingredients and their fermentation.

They've been primarily tap only, but will be releasing bottles of Ceremony and a dry hopped gose this weekend. So very excited.  Probably less well known in the Seattle area is Standard Brewing in the Central District. They've been open for just over 2 years and I feel the only reason they aren't as well known is that they're positioned away from the typical brewery hubs of Ballard and SoDo.

New Albanian seems to be always overlooked, but they're one of the older and better microbrews in the state across the board.  Their Black and Bluegrass is easily one of the best beers being made today -- I like it better than Gumballhead.   Grantline location has the best deep dish pizza in the state.  Yea.    I was really impressed with Big Woods, which is now Quaff On in Nashville.  Good stouts.  There's a little brewery in Seymour called Twisted Crew.  Their beers are consistently good.

CraftBeer,390ffd,IChooseToBooze,2,Mon Jun 8 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"In the wine world we called it a ""Tartric Stain"" were the tartrate and sediment would cling to the edge of the bottle and stain it a deep purple.  Nothing to be afraid of as cherries and grapes have a similar acid structure, and such lends itself to react similarly.  With the staining on the cork I bet it may be drying out a bit, but not to critical levels.  I would avoid storing it on its side for long periods of time as the dry cork can send an off flavor into the lambic.  But you do need to rehydrate the cork.  Tartric Sediment can be viewed as a mark of excellent quality."

Definitely enjoyed the hole-in-the-wall/urban-farm feel but didn't necessarily latch on to any of their beers honestly. I think they have a very strong farmhouse ale going for them, but I guess I'm just predisposed to the west coast IPA and didn't think that they had anything even on the same level."

CraftBeer,38thn8,Montekai,5,Sat Jun 6 18:01:10 2015 UTC,"I am incredibly biased when I say this, but I believe American beers are the best beers.  With the exception of some Scottish breweries, I've only had American beers truly push the envelope.  Our domestics (meaning made at home, not macro crap) seem more willing to experiment than those oversea. It's hard to pick one specific brewery over others though, since each one has so much to offer.  American craft usually impresses me by either using crazy ingredients (coconut, keylimes, pineapple, chocolate, bacon, even doughnuts) or crazy amounts of hops (which I've grown to love).  And of course some breweries have similar beers, but are completely different, like Funky Buddha Last Snow and OBP's Toasted Coconut Porter.  One of them is the best beer on the planet, and the other is TCP.  When choosing who to drink, I really like going local.  I'm insanely blessed to live in Florida, where the beers are freaking delicious.  So, I can go nearly anywhere and find something awesome. The distribution network and distribution laws change from state and I am hardly knowledgeable about either, so the beers here could vary from those elsewhere in the country.  I often see beers in this subreddit I simply do not recognize.  That being said; Dogfish Head, Terrapin, New Belgium, Left Hand and even Sam Adams(aka Boston Brewing and they're dangerously close to being macro) seem to be pretty easy to find and are all damn good breweries in their own right."
CraftBeer,38thn8,Hiray,2,Sat Jun 6 19:04:12 2015 UTC,Yeah the guy who sent me here said he like them best aswell. I admire the indie brewing business since we don't have that too much here. I'd like to try one someday tough i don't think they import small business crafts to sweden :(  have you tried any euro beers?
CraftBeer,38thn8,kozmund,3,Sat Jun 6 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're in Sweden, so you've probably got some options there. Sweden consumes 12% of all craft beer exported from the US.  /u/Hiray gave you a pretty good overview. I'd add that the American craft beer scene is strangely fractured due to the enormity of the US, and the fact that every state has different laws regarding alcohol. To give one example, Stone Brewing is the 9th largest craft brewery (14th, when you include the macro brewers) and even they only sell their beer in 41 out of 50 states. That said, they do actually export to Sweden. The point I'm driving at here is that the beers that someone raves about in Florida, or Michigan, or Oregon, or California may not be available for purchase in any other given area of the US. That regional quirk makes it hard to recommend beers to someone in another state, let alone another country, without sitting down and doing a ton of research.  To answer your question about European beers, most of what we see imported to the US are from Germany, Belgium, or the UK. I know over a decade ago, I had a Swedish beer or two that some visiting students brought over, but the closest (geographically) craft brewer I'm familiar with would be Nøgne Ø out of Norway. I fondly recall their Dugges Sahti, as I think it was the first beer I liked that used juniper."
CraftBeer,38thn8,Jyrchi,2,Sun Jun 7 07:49:04 2015 UTC,"Never knew Nøgne did a version of sahti. Pretty interesting as it's a traditional brew around here. Would be interesting to taste, but apparently it's pretty poorly available at this point. Internet seems to say that it doesn't have much to do with the one we have made for ages, but whatevs."
CraftBeer,38thn8,kozmund,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"Nøgne's version of it was at the very least a good beer.  Dogfish Head's Sah'tea (also quite good) is purported to be modeled on a 9th century Finnish recipe as part of their ""Ancient Ales"" series, so it's almost certainly a more traditional take on the style."
CraftBeer,38thn8,Jyrchi,2,Sun Jun 7 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"Check out local bars and pubs, they do have some selection depending on your location. Even better if it's a bigger city. Last time I was in Sweden there were some Ballast Points and other stuff like that in a restaurant in a city that had a population something close to 10k. Not as crafty as it gets, but good stuff none the less."

We of course had to fly back so we couldn't really bring much with us.  We bought this beer because we can't get anything good like this back home and her brother was super jealous of us.  We had every intention of drinking it, but we had so many other beers that we didn't get around to it.  We hid the beer (because her grandparents would throw it away if they found it) in the house and we're hoping it will still be there when we go back for Christmas.

Phoenix Vienna lager is brewed with German Pilsner, Vienna, Carapils malts, and locally grown Medjoul Dates which are added to the boil. Subtle German Noble hop bitterness provides balance and crisp flavor, with notes of toffee, dates and figs shining through into the finish. Phoenix is fermented with a Mexican Lager yeast and then lagered for an additional 60 days the result is a quaffable malt forward lager with an influence of Medjool Dates for a uniquely local Coachella Valley flavor. Pairs extremely well with spicy foods including bbq, and of course all Mexican food. Phoenix is a mythical bird cyclically regenerated and reborn symbolizing renewal, and exemplifying the intense Coachella Valley sun, as well as life in a heavenly Paradise. With that we thought of no better offering that would embody one of the most prized offerings of the Coachella Valley date growers, so enjoy Phoenix again and again and again….."

CraftBeer,38cij2,greenriver572,2,Wed Jun 3 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"It does, and there have been many articles and beer drinkers who talk about it, let me google it for you. Read any of those links and a majority of individuals or the main point of them is that yes, it is important. It effects a lot of aspects of beer and if this reviewer wants their reviews to be read at all they should at least make a concerted effort in reviewing in proper glass or near proper glass. Also if the summation of your review about the taste of the beer can be summed up by  ""stout is super sweet with a subtle bitter aftertaste, good, strong cup of black coffee, like than an oatmeal stout, similar thick, mealy taste""  Of which completely ignores a ton of flavors anyone with half a tongue could get from this beer (bourbon, vanilla, oak, and oh chocolate), then yeah it's not a good review and whats the point of making a article about it."
CraftBeer,38cij2,solovolk,-2,Wed Jun 3 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"a lot of those links/articles talked about color and aroma. Again, not much to do with the overall taste."
CraftBeer,38cij2,plug_into_aux,0,Wed Jun 3 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"You didn't read a damn link and you don't have much common knowledge if you think aroma doen't affect taste.  Fucking any article online will tell you that, here is one if you don't believe me, cognitive dissonance will probably be strong in you though.  But onto the aspects of the articles not talking about taste, I'll prove it.   First link seriouseats, it specifically talks about how it affects carbonation, carbonation directly affects flavor, did you know this? Probably not, or just don't care to say it does, but anyone who's drank a flat soda or beer before knows that.   Second link from beeradvocate, ""As soon as the beer hits the glass, its color, aroma and taste is altered, your eye candy receptors tune in, and your anticipation is tweaked."" so yeah no if ands or but's there.  Third link is from washingtonpost and goes into detail the many aspects of how it can affect taste describing the carbonation, the temperature it holds, the lip of the glass affecting where the beer is distributed, and a lot more, read the damn article. Not only that but it specifically recites other news websites Wired, Daily News, and Popular Science which all had positive reviews of beer glasses.  Next is scientificamerican which talks about the history of beer and how the glass effects carbonation, temperature, and from this specific quote ""and the lip pours the beverage evenly over the front of the drinker’s palate, enhancing the sweetness of the drink."", yes it does affect taste.  Next is thekitchn, ""Much like wine, the aroma, color, and taste of beer is affected as soon as it hits a glass."" Yeah, no, you didn't read the article.   And then learn.kegerator.com which just explains the shapes and doesn't mention anything really important at all. But you know what it says for tulip glasses? ""Designed to trap and maintain the foam head, the tulip glass helps enhance the flavor and aromatics of hoppy and malty brews."" so yeah, not really helping your case.  Next is from reddit and I thought that'd be silly to pull quotes from there, though you should check it out anyways, and then tablematters which once again explains many aspects of glasses and how they affect taste but I'm not going to bother pulling quotes through it, and then finally stackexchange which is just a yahoo answers type site that isn't anymore relevant then reddit (though the answer once again agrees with me).  So no you did not read the articles, you clearly didn't learn a thing, and this is my last response to you because I doubt you care that much anyways."
CraftBeer,38cij2,solovolk,2,Wed Jun 3 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"As someone who homebrews quite regularly, the act of dry hopping is almost entirely for the purpose of Aroma (thus, affecting taste).   Why else would we stick ounces and ounces of expensive hops in for just aroma, if it doesn't truly make the beer better?  That would be a waste of time and money.  So yes, without even putting article (which you did well with multiple sources), I'll back you up and tell you from homebrewing experience - aroma is a major contributor to taste in beer.  We dry hop almost strictly for it."

Fair warning, 3 floyds will be busy. Like line out the door waiting for it to open on a Sunday morning busy. Still worth it. My personal favorite in the Chicago area is Revolution. We did not go to the restaurant and pub on Milwakuee ave, we went to the brewery and tap room itself on Kedzie ave. Spacious, chill atmosphere, good beer. Local Option was also an excellent craft beer bar with lots of options. If you are looking for food and beer, check out the Yardhouse. They have an insane number of tap lines, like 50+. Not all of them are that rare, but no way you can't find something new and the food is out of this world. I would not recommend Half Acre brewing; beer was ok, but everybody who worked there were pricks. While you're in Chicago stop by a Binny's. They are a Chicago chain and the one I've been to a couple times has a massive craft beer selection. Source: Done a few ""beer tours"" myself, one of them being Chicago last fall"

I hear the second batch was better but the first one has to be one of the worst beers I've ever had. Undrinkable. Tasted like straight sea water it was so salty.

CraftBeer,38031n,OceanOfMyHead,2,Mon Jun 1 17:13:41 2015 UTC,Why does the big bottle mean better aging?
CraftBeer,38031n,OystersAreEvil,2,Mon Jun 1 03:18:16 2015 UTC,"Larger liquid to oxygen ratio, and more beer means less susceptibility to temperature swings."
CraftBeer,38031n,damb_b,2,Mon Jun 1 04:53:33 2015 UTC,I don't understand why the liquid to oxygen ratio would be different.
CraftBeer,38031n,damb_b,2,Mon Jun 1 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"The head space will be about the same no matter the bottle size, so the that means it will be relatively smaller if there's more liquid.  Also, if it's a large enough amount of liquid and you feel inclined to swim across, take off your suit of arms or you'll surely sink."
CraftBeer,38031n,DukeNukem1990,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There should be little to no oxygen in the bottle at all, since bottles are very likely to be purged with CO2 before filling. Brewers do not want fermented beer to be exposed to oxygen before/during packaging."
CraftBeer,38031n,OystersAreEvil,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:07:19 2015 UTC,I always understood that bigger bottles just age more slowly.

CraftBeer,380jcj,BltByKrmn,2,Mon Jun 1 02:13:42 2015 UTC,The 120 minute is hardly an IPA. It's pretty sweet. Gold color has a big honey flavor. It's great but the hops are scrubbed out by the alcohol. I'd say its much more a barley-wine than an IPA.   If I were you I would buy one for drinking and one for aging.

CraftBeer,37wqff,Badwolf2013,2,Sun May 31 06:20:03 2015 UTC,You are all over the place with those beers. I love it. The Anderson Valley is one of my favorite beers.
CraftBeer,37wqff,Khraine,1 point,Sun May 31 07:17:45 2015 UTC,I am really trying to get a little bit of everything right now. I am loving these so far. I'm always looking for suggestions for new types of beers to try though!
CraftBeer,37wqff,dsn0wman,1 point,Sun May 31 08:43:23 2015 UTC,If you are in the valley then you have to go to AZ Wilderness in Gilbert. It's the most amazing brewery. It's hands down the best brewery I've ever tried.
CraftBeer,37wqff,phenobarbidoll89,1 point,Sun May 31 21:22:00 2015 UTC,AZ Wilderness is what got me into craft beer actually. I had some friends that said I had to try this place. I went with them while they had the sycamore canyon saison and I knew I had to get into this. The blood orange zing with the sour notes was to amazing. I am going to try to pick up a growler from them soon. I don't live close but I work down the street so i'll take some home soon!
CraftBeer,37wqff,phenobarbidoll89,1 point,Sun May 31 21:39:37 2015 UTC,Awesome. Those are good friends. The last time I was their I got a growler of Berliner Weisse. It was awesome. Tart and wheaty. Enjoy all those great beers.
CraftBeer,37wqff,washufize,2,Sun May 31 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"At first I was saddened by the standard ""i am getting into craft beer here is my first trip to the real beer section!"" Post  Then I came back and see you are attempting to review. Which is exactly what this is about.   I suggest looking into an app to track your notes. Like Untapped for instance. It's fairly popular for great reasons.   For notes try to keep them. Even when it's just ""tastes like shit"" everyone has different tastes.   Craftbeer is a lot like Pokemon. Gotta try em all.   I would also suggest when you find a beer you love, ask for beers that are similar, and stock up on the beers you love. Especially if they age well. Which is a whole topic itself."
CraftBeer,37wqff,phenobarbidoll89,2,Sun May 31 21:20:55 2015 UTC,I don't think you are doing very good. It appears as if all of those bottles are full.
CraftBeer,37wqff,smurfe,2,Tue Jun 2 22:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yay Abita! Purple Haze is good but personally I think Turbodog or Andygator is better. I don't know where you live, though, so I don't know if you have access to those brews. I used to bartend and a lot of people liked to mix Purple Haze and Andygator and called it a ""Barney""."
CraftBeer,37wqff,samclemens_89,2,Sun May 31 01:28:47 2015 UTC,I live in AZ. What are the Turbodog and Andygator? Maybe I will look out for them if they are sold here!
CraftBeer,37wqff,KingVape,1 point,Sun May 31 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"Turbodog is a really dark ale that has a sort of chocolate flavor. Andygator is a Helles Doppelbock with 8% alcohol, strong but hella delicious.  I live in Louisiana just a few hours from the brewery so I kind of luck out with getting to try all the awesome flavors.  If you go to Abita's website, they have excellent descriptions on all their beers."

CraftBeer,37wqff,scgt86,1 point,Sun May 31 05:57:14 2015 UTC,"This thread is why you should never ask anyone else what you should ""like"" in craft beer. Drink what you like, not anyone else. Covington Strawberry is number one on my list of worst beers ever tried. Everything Abita is extra ""ordinary"" to nasty and this saddens me as I live like an hour from the brewery."
CraftBeer,37wqff,PDCchewie88,1 point,Sun May 31 12:47:04 2015 UTC,"Solid picks. I think it's good you got something from Paulaner. Little breweries are fun and can make great beer, but old established breweries are also awesome because they have good beer figured out at this point and inspired the smaller breweries of today."
CraftBeer,37wqff,scgt86,1 point,Sun May 31 06:36:43 2015 UTC,"Very surprised to see that Gose! I liked it a lot, but it isn't my favorite sour. Very drinkable though!"
CraftBeer,37wqff,sampson158,1 point,Sun May 31 07:34:37 2015 UTC,"The Dirt Wolf is one of my favorite Double IPAs. The Stone Russian Imperial us good but, if you like it, keep your eye out for North Coast Old Rasputin and Founders Imperial Stout. Purple Haze isn't my thing, but many people love it. If you can find it, try Victory Kirsh Gose. It's a sour cherry beer that is extremely  refreshing. I would also look into trying a barley wine or strong ale just so you get an ideaa of what you like."
CraftBeer,37wqff,tesd44,1 point,Sun May 31 13:30:30 2015 UTC,"I would recommend sharing that Chai spiced IRS with one or two other people. The flavor is spot on, but depending on your taste, it can be overwhelming to handle 22oz at a time. Also, pick up the original if you can just so you can know what the base beer is like. It's a great imperial stout."
CraftBeer,37wqff,Chris-P-Creme,2,Sun May 31 14:59:25 2015 UTC,The base IRS gets better and better with age too.  Have had it up to 10 yo and it just keeps getting better.

CraftBeer,37wryd,Rikplaysbass,8,Sun May 31 01:23:43 2015 UTC,"Don't age Hopslam! IPA of any variety is always best fresh. Hop character is the first thing to deteriorate with time, and it's what this particular beer is praised for. Also best to keep it refrigerated."
CraftBeer,37wryd,Cookaracha,2,Sun May 31 01:29:17 2015 UTC,He's kept it for a month or so. How bad did he fuck up? He's kept it in the fridge at least.
CraftBeer,37wryd,Cookaracha,2,Sun May 31 01:30:18 2015 UTC,"I think they release it once a year in winter. So if it's refrigerated it should be okay. I just recommend drinking it sooner than later, as in tonight. I got one bottle in February from a friend and drank it that day."
CraftBeer,37wryd,jbramley,2,Sun May 31 01:35:51 2015 UTC,"It was brewed and released in January. It's more than a month old. If he just got it a month ago, then he might as well sit on it for however long he feels like."
CraftBeer,37wryd,cynosureskater,-1,Mon Jun 1 13:16:10 2015 UTC,Its only a month old? That's not bad at all. Usually drink within 90 days for maximum hoppiness
CraftBeer,37wryd,whitep77,2,Sun May 31 04:43:42 2015 UTC,"Conventional wisdom for an IPA (or DIPA or IIPA) is drink it as fresh as possible.  That is not to say that it will taste bad if it is aged, but it will lose some of the aroma and hop forward flavor as it ages."
CraftBeer,37wryd,TheHungryHeathen,1 point,Sun May 31 01:29:46 2015 UTC,I always believed the same but his boss said to age it so I figured that was maybe the case for this certain beer. Thanks.
CraftBeer,37wryd,RFWM17,1 point,Sun May 31 01:31:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. I purchased two 6-packs a while back when it first came to Ohio. I just drank my last one about a week ago. I noticed a difference, not to say that it was bad. But it wasn't quite as good as when I first purchased it, and it was refrigerated the whole time."
CraftBeer,37wryd,cynosureskater,2,Sun May 31 01:39:02 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me, drank several fresh and let one sit in the fridge for a bit, and I noticed that the honey flavor really explodes if you let it sit for a period of a few months. Definitely noticed a difference in taste, but it was no less delicious in my opinion. If anything it's a testament to how good hopslam really is. Still really hoppy, but it's like letting it sit turned up the intensity of the honey."

CraftBeer,37nh12,jbramley,1 point,Fri May 29 16:58:48 2015 UTC,There were a couple of rectangle states that were just rectangles. Obviously not much you can do with boring state shapes. I just would be more interested in getting one for NC if the shape was ... something else?
CraftBeer,37nh12,Kieday,2,Fri May 29 17:22:18 2015 UTC,"I would suggest the state flag for Colorado, as we here are very proud of it and love the design. Almost suggested the same idea for NC, then looked up the flag."

CraftBeer,37nh12,veraverdita,1 point,Sat May 30 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"Pint glasses that have ""pre-order"" in the title require a small amount of crowd funding before going to production. Each town has the same small goal and it typically takes 10-20 backers to reach said goal. We are a small company, so it's difficult to financially support on-demand printing, i.e. 1 pint for 1 consumer. However, once a pint reaches it's goal for the first time, it's available forever. We started with only NJ pints and as you can see a majority of those have previously met their goals and are now readily available. Hope that makes sense!"

Head Hunter I'm not sure of in that area but it's easy to find at any bottle shop/grocery store with a craft selection. Not entirely sure how far they distribute though so worse case scenario go a bit more north if you don't find it.

Sorry,  but I didnt find any either.  Headhunter should be almost everywhere.  I think the best columbus beers are not in packaging so having pints or filling growlers will get you the coolest stuff.  The Ohio Taproom is great for ohio only beers, but only does growler fills.  For bottle shops Pace-High, Palmers, Crafted Drafts."

I suppose the difference is gypsy brewers are a much bigger deal here, but it's still done in the States. It's possible that Estonia's gypsy brewers seem to be higher profile because it's such a small country, and it's easy for me to learn all of the names."
CraftBeer,37h5hl,TvAzteca,3,Wed May 27 20:49:59 2015 UTC,Pretty Things in Massachusetts are excellent gypsy brewers who have no intention of opening their own brewery.
CraftBeer,37h5hl,Jyrchi,2,Thu May 28 12:29:17 2015 UTC,"If I'm not completely wrong, Brooklyn Brewery didn't have their own brewery when they started out. I don't know if it was made by many different breweries or just some selected partner.  Sorry for the offtopic, but just out of curiosity what led you into moving to Estonia? Feel free to stop by in your northern neighbor, which is reachable in few hours with a ferry. The prices here are a bit steeper than in Estonia, but some really nice pubs and great craft beers in Helsinki! Omnipollo Nebuchadnezzar is really great IIPA, one of my all time favorites. I'm still to taste Põhjala :("
CraftBeer,37h5hl,defroach84,2,Wed May 27 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"That's interesting to hear, since I'm a native New Yorker. Tervist from Estonia! I came here for a woman, as have most expats in this country. I also teach English, so it wasn't so difficult to find a job.   If you come down to Tallinn, swing by Speakeasy, Põhjala's brewpub. They're the most interesting brewery in Estonia in my opinion, and they sell their new experimental and collaboration brews there. A month ago they had a port-barrel imperial stout they did in collaboration with Lervig and Põhjala that night! Let me know if you want any recommendations about Estonian beer, or bars, or whatever."

CraftBeer,37h5hl,Jyrchi,1 point,Wed May 27 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Tere õhtust! (not sure if that was correctly written) That sounds damn interesting, I'll have to take up on that tip sometime in the near future. The ferries are pretty cheap when the trips are on sale, so it wouldn't be bad to drop by. And same goes, if you happen to wander into Finland any time, feel free to contact. Unfortunately around here the 0,3 - 0,5l craft beers cost anything between 5-10 euros and on special occasions even a bit over that. No wonder tourism is blooming in Tallinn.  You had pretty nice craft beer festival there a few months back. I had planned on attending, but unfortunately it didn't fit the schedule, which I'm still sad of. But maybe next year!"
CraftBeer,37h5hl,chigrz,1 point,Wed May 27 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"That's correct! And hyvää iltaa to you (according to Google translate). Põhjala actually organized that festival! They've been mixing leftover kegs from it into their rotation at Speakeasy, but they're almost out.   The thing about price is sad, I've never seen a beer over 5 euros in a shop or a bar over here. It definitely explains why whenever I go drinking with Finns they're always super generous and buy rounds for everyone. Enthusiasm over the price is the reason I generally get. So, uh, tell me if you want to go drinking when you visit Tallinn :D"
CraftBeer,37h5hl,scgt86,2,Wed May 27 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"Ha, that's just about as generous as us cheap Finns get! I'll have to take the biggest luggage bag I have and stock up on everything. I'll definitely hit you a message when I get a trip planned"
CraftBeer,37h5hl,jasonumd,1 point,Wed May 27 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"That'd be known as contract brewing in the U.S. It's a relatively small portion of craft beer market (1-2%), though that's because a lot of start-ups graduate to their own facilities. Half Acre in Chicago did this, I believe."
CraftBeer,37gdua,ecoshia,7,Wed May 27 12:56:36 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you'll get people into your bar who aren't big into craft beer (or maybe are just starting out). Their friends will want to go and they'll say ""It's ok buddy, I know you don't like craft beers but they have XYZ on tap and you'll like that one."" Obviously keep the number to a reasonable amount to keep from alienating the real customer base (depending how many taps you have total) but there's nothing wrong with having a couple of cheapies or ""crafts"" on tap in addition to a stellar lineup of good local real crafts."
CraftBeer,37gdua,immauser,3,Wed May 27 14:41:02 2015 UTC,"The logic here is that somehow micro breweries can't brew widely appealing beers and I think that's just false. Find a local pilsner or hefe and you'll be fine, no need to sell out."
CraftBeer,37gdua,Pringlecks,2,Wed May 27 19:55:22 2015 UTC,That might be how some people think of it but that's hardly my logic. You'll get some people who want to drink what they've heard of and what's familiar no matter what their friends say. Putting on a single tap of Shock Top or something similar is hardly selling out imo edit: he's also said in other comments he has a couple of macros on tap so he's more worried about people thinking he considers those beers to be craft beers than he is about giving money to the big boys so tbh I feel like this question is a lot more about perception than it is about giving money to big corporations.
CraftBeer,37gdua,immauser,1 point,Wed May 27 20:54:25 2015 UTC,Oh I see. Sorry for the mischaracterization.
CraftBeer,37gdua,Pringlecks,5,Wed May 27 21:17:01 2015 UTC,"What is your vision for the bar?  Do you want to be a craft centric bar that focuses on good local beer?  Or do you just care about making money?  If you just care about making money, then stock them.  If you care about the beer and what you sell, then don't.  If I ran a craft beer bar, I would not sell anything macro.  But, that is just me.  I am guessing a large majority of your customers would not care if you did or did not, but you would know you were."
CraftBeer,37gdua,defroach84,6,Wed May 27 13:15:27 2015 UTC,no you're right. i have always focused on craft. especially local stuff. no point fucking around with the big players now. and it's average beer anyway. don't know what i was thinking.
CraftBeer,37gdua,leecanter,2,Wed May 27 13:30:30 2015 UTC,"Bar I work at (in the U.S.) has only craft on tap and then we have Heineken and corona in the fridge by request.   To be honest there is nothing wrong with having some macros. You can still love craft but you need to make money if you wanna keep selling craft. It's utterly ridiculous (to me at least) to not sell something the public may want just cause you feel like you're not ""selling out."""
CraftBeer,37gdua,defroach84,4,Wed May 27 15:08:54 2015 UTC,To each their own.  I don't see a need for the macros when there are so many other options that are not macros.
CraftBeer,37gdua,hardkoretom,8,Wed May 27 15:50:51 2015 UTC,"Just have one tap available for them. There is nothing wrong with having an inexpensive macro beer on tap. If it brings more people in to your establishment, then you win."
CraftBeer,37gdua,SirParmigiana,6,Wed May 27 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"we already have a few macros. the australian versions of Bud, Miller and Coors (Carlton, Tooheys and Resches) a d the aussie version of sam adams (coopers). so we have stuff for the general non-crafty public. my worry was bringing it on as a ""craft"" beer. it's owned and run by coke. they're trying and winning to a certain extent, but no one really cares about who owns what outside of the serious craft drinkers. i think i'll not have them on because we've worked hard to be seen as a legitimate player in the scene in sydney, and bringing them on would lose me a lot of face."
CraftBeer,37gdua,SirParmigiana,1 point,Wed May 27 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"Depends, if your audience/cutomers already set for australian microbreweries, why bother changing the taps to macrobrewers.

CraftBeer,37gdua,Cannon1,1 point,Wed May 27 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are missing the point here.   OP is not asking if they should carry a macro beer.   OP is asking whether they should carry the fake craft stuff that macros are putting out to dupe ill informed consumers into thinking they are buying something local, but in fact are buying AB or Miller Coors products.   Think of Third Shift in the US.   My opinion is to totally say screw off on the fake craft beer they are pushing.   If needed, totally carry their regular macro stuff for the consumer who wants that."

CraftBeer,37dgnz,rjgreen85,8,Tue May 26 20:44:41 2015 UTC,$13 for 6 is fair for a double IPA.   I think it's great. What I've noticed is there area few rookie beer drinkers I've sold 2.0 to and most of them have come back for seconds. That's not the easiest thing to do for DIPAs.

CraftBeer,37dgnz,omarant329,3,Tue May 26 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it. It's more of a citrusy DIPA now, which I like. I haven't looked at any numbers, but the IBUs seem a lot lower now as well. Very comparable to any Enjoy By."
CraftBeer,37dgnz,munche,1 point,Tue May 26 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"See, to me it tastes too much like Enjoy By. It's basically a blander Enjoy By....so why would I pick it up instead of Enjoy By? Ruination 1.0 offered a different IPA experience, 2.0 is just sort of a poor man's Enjoy By that isn't really much cheaper at all.   I would really have preferred something more along the lines of RuinTen."
CraftBeer,37dgnz,omarant329,1 point,Wed May 27 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"This is a good beer that is available all year. Enjoy Bys are great but they are only available on a monthly/bi-monthly basis. RuinTen is only available annually. With Ruination 2.0 we now have a good beer available to us whenever we like, all year long."
CraftBeer,37dgnz,m2daholla,3,Wed May 27 17:03:37 2015 UTC,It's a solid followup to the original. Very drinkable. Agreed on the comparison to Enjoy By 2-14-15. A damn good DIPA.
CraftBeer,37dgnz,munche,4,Tue May 26 22:09:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's a pretty decent IPA but kind of....soulless, I guess?   I felt like the original Ruination had an aggressive, bitter, piney character. The new one is just a pretty run of the mill citrusy DIPA.   I felt like the Pale 2.0 did a much better job getting the character of the beer it was replacing while still being a unique experience."
CraftBeer,37dgnz,AggroAce,0,Wed May 27 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"Like most of Stone products, I found the ""aggressive, bitter, piney character"" a gimmick and got real old real fast. I like the move to the Citrus spectrum."
CraftBeer,37dgnz,munche,2,Wed May 27 14:55:17 2015 UTC,"The problem is, Enjoy By is a better example of the citrus side of the spectrum, so Ruination just becomes the ""well I couldn't find any Enjoy By...."""

CraftBeer,37dgnz,munche,1 point,Wed May 27 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, from a business perspective it seems like 2.0 is a hit. I think the old Ruination was getting lost in the shuffle and people's tastes have shifted away from aggressively bitter beers. I'm just a fan of that style of IPA and I'm bummed to lose it, even though it was only ever an occasional buy for me."
CraftBeer,37dgnz,yocxl,1 point,Wed May 27 18:38:01 2015 UTC,"I thought it was good. That being said, I preferred the original. It was a nice bitter piney DIPA. Now it's a fairly run of the mill (though quite good) citrusy one.   Don't know why it needed a reworking."
CraftBeer,37dgnz,DownrightBrewed,1 point,Wed May 27 05:43:11 2015 UTC,It's been a while since I've had the original but I think I like 2.0 a little more. Great citrus notes and the hoppines is just right.

Do you plan to judge? Brew? Compete? I'd say to ask yourself which would be of more value to you and your position. If you're in sales in craft beer, cicerone seems to be more applicable. It covers keeping and serving, styles, food pairings... More extensive. Both super difficult to attain, geared towards very different purposes. Working in distribution it's also important to know troubleshooting... Off flavors or draft systems. Also encompassed by cicerone.   Edit: words"
CraftBeer,379ged,reddevil_lady,1 point,Tue May 26 06:23:55 2015 UTC,"So if i understand this correctly. If one wants to become a brewer, the BJCP will serve him better. If one wants to work in the service and food industry, cicerone is the way to go. Sounds about right?"

In Ireland you pretty much can't drink alcohol in public spaces at all (although there's a bit of leniency depending on where you are), but it still just seems weird to me.   Stout is a bit of a cultural institution here, and that's inextricably linked to the idea of 'stout = pint glass', so whenever I see it it just seems very strange, and even more so in the context of beer geeks.

CraftBeer,36sx0r,Khraine,3,Fri May 22 03:31:55 2015 UTC,"Temp isn't actually the beer killer, it just doesn't provide a basis to control aging. When you store beer at a lower temp in controlled humidity with no light it provides a way of controlling the aging.  You could age a beer in a closet with no light in an AC house that holds 75 very well. In fact it's the best way to start aging. The issue is time. Most ""serious face"" cellars are 55, low humidity and no light.  But I totally agree.  If it's out in the open, especially a hop heavy beer, and ""hanging out""... you are doing it wrong. Plus I prefer my stouts. So my huge ass beer fridge is almost all stouts. mmmm Imperial Stouts."
CraftBeer,36sx0r,munche,1 point,Fri May 22 02:48:11 2015 UTC,Points Unknown was a good IPA and a good interesting tripel blended to make a pretty good beer
CraftBeer,36sx0r,dsn0wman,1 point,Fri May 22 04:33:41 2015 UTC,I think Points Unknown is brilliant. It's a lovely barrel aged tripel blended with a Double IPA. I don't think I have to date experienced any Belgian style IPAs that even come close. This is basically what Green Flash Le Freak wants to be when it grows up.    I think the point with this one is that you can very much pick up all the flavors from the tripel while still getting a nose full of hops.

CraftBeer,36t9x0,mavol,1 point,Fri May 22 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"In addition to Revolution, take a look at  Two Brothers, Metropolitan, and Half Acre. Metropolitan in particular is only sold in Chicago that I've seen (they focus on German brewing styles and pull them off well).  Also look for Small Town's Not Your Father's Root Beer. It's delicious and has been getting really popular.  Lastly, a stop at Three Floyds really is worth your time even if you only go to their carry out kiosk (check here to see what's for sale when you're heading through). You'll like be taking I-80 and it's not far off the interstate. Take Exit 1 (right before the IL border) and head south on Calumet Ave. It's just a couple miles down."

If you look really hard, there were a few special beers but not many. Decent sized pours and no limit to how many times you could visit a line.  Bad-long lines, a lot of common beers. None of the people pouring beer knew much about the beers- only a couple breweries had representatives. Loud, and crowded.  Ugly- it was pretty expensive if you paid full price for your tickets. The best beers available ran out of stock pretty quickly.  The food available was not impressive, and the venue was not that nice. Lacked a soul, for what that is worth."

Deschutes and Hair of the Dog are great at making darker, maltier, heavy stouts and Belgian styles.

CraftBeer,368d0k,laback94,5,Sun May 17 09:24:45 2015 UTC,"Ok so first thing I did was build the table and I nailed & glued wood trim on top so the resin wouldn't over flow, next I laid out the bottle caps. I used packaging tape and stuck it across the bottle caps (3 rows at a time) and laid all the rows of bottle caps to the side. Then I did a thin put off epoxy resin (you can get it at any home improvement store, it's like $70 but definitely worth it). As soon as I poured the thin layer, I put all the rows of bottle caps back down and pelted of the tape (peeling isn't easy, but it's easier than placing the caps one by one). Once I had all of the tape pelted off I pushed down on all the caps to make sure they would be held down by the epoxy resin (the first coat btw is to secure the caps to the table so that on the final poor they don't float up). After waiting for the resin to cure, I did the final poor to cover up the caps and used a heat gun to get rid of the air bubbles.  I hope this helps!"

CraftBeer,366ni3,BeerPhile,3,Sat May 23 00:08:39 2015 UTC,Seems like a normal markup for an on premise account.   I usually see 4 packs priced at about $21. Most of the off premise places get a higher margin in it because it's limited - so about 30%.  So each bottle is probably wholesaling for about $3.68.  Most on premise have a 75% margin putting my estimates at $14.72.

Lion Bridge in the Czech Village has been getting better and better, Third Base is not just a sports bar on the north side, they often are making something new. If you haven't been to Parlor City yet in the newbo district you should check it out they have a good number of taps and are always shifting what's available. Since TG was already mentioned, Big Grove Brewery as a nearby but not in CR option, it's in Solon they make great beer, have good food, and awesome atmosphere.

Some beers will taste horrible (lesson learned!), some beers will just taste old (oh well), some beers will evolve into something different (hooray! maybe...), and some beers will improve (hooray!). Regardless, you learn something about the effect of age on beer and get a better idea of what you should or shouldn't age going forward.  (Sure, some people will tell you that aging hop-forward beers is a waste of a good beer, but if you've never had a year old or three year old Pliny/Heady/HopSlam/whatever, then it could be fun to taste what happens!)"

Consider that the beer just has to make it there, it doesn't matter if it stays cold or not.   Yes, long term, you do not want beer exposed to wild temperature fluctuations, but if you do it once (or even 3-4+ times), it shouldn't matter. Light skunks beer, temperature 'ages' beer. The colder, the slower, the hotter the faster."
CraftBeer,35y9m8,JCrazy84,2,Thu May 14 15:08:18 2015 UTC,I put beers in my suitcase in my clothes. Would be best if you put them in a trash bag in case one breaks.
CraftBeer,35y9m8,hardkoretom,2,Thu May 14 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"I've flown with a lot of beer a few times now.  I'm talking two full 40-50 pound bags filled with bottles.    This is mostly just echoing what others have said, but know that you have to check these bags, you cannot bring beer on as a carry on.    Your luggage will be dropped, kicked, thrown, and generally mistreated.  Pack it as if you were shipping it.  I put every bottle in a freezer ziploc bag, and then wrap in bubble wrap and secure with tape, pack them in the center of the bags and pad the outside with clothes/more packing materials, etc.  Make sure it is packed TIGHT.  Do not pack loosely, you do not want the bottles shifting around at all.  Also, note that TSA can and will go through your bag, so don't pack it in such a complicated way that they won't be able to repack it quickly, because they will just shove it back in until they can zip it and you might have a disaster on your hands.  Room temp/cold doesn't matter too much.  I generally only chill beers before I am ready to drink them (though, most beer I drink is beer that can age).  If they go from fridge to room temp back to a fridge once before you drink it, it's not going to be that big of a deal."
CraftBeer,35y9m8,damb_b,0,Thu May 14 15:43:12 2015 UTC,"Hop-forward IPAs will lose their flavor dramatically if not kept refrigerated.    Other styles like stouts, saisons, strong ales, wild ales, etc. are far less temperature sensitive and should have little/no ill effects from the journey."

Your main concern would be that it didn't stay in direct sunlight for any good amount of time and that it didn't get exessively warm. As long as you put it in a relatively cold or room temp closet/dark area you are good. Now this specific beer might not taste just right with an amount of age on it, why? Well because Left Hand said so:  LHB: ""I think a lot of people over-age their imperial stouts, but of course it comes down to personal taste. I have over-aged imperial stouts myself. I feel the beers do not improve infinitely over time—there’s a sweet spot. The aging has to enhance characteristics already in the beer. For my taste, that’s usually about three years max, but it depends on a number of factors. Aging is controlled staling of beer, so factors such as how the bottle was filled can have significant impact. We release Wake Up Dead once it’s ready to drink—it ages about 3–4 months in the brewery, and release time is determined by sensory analysis. We taste it and package it once it’s ready."""

CraftBeer,35fupy,lager_ibarleyknowher,1 point,Sun May 10 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming these were discounted because they're almost expired?  If the breweries found out that their beers were being discounted for sale due to expiration dates, they might not be too happy. Drinking a 6 month old beer for $1 is not what any brewery or brewer wants as the perception of their product. The retailer should contact the brewery or wholesaler about aged inventory and they SHOULD gladly remedy the situation."
CraftBeer,35fupy,lager_ibarleyknowher,1 point,Fri May 15 06:31:25 2015 UTC,If I'm wrong and you have a local shop selling fresh nitro chub for a buck a can.....gimme.
CraftBeer,35fupy,lager_ibarleyknowher,1 point,Fri May 15 06:32:40 2015 UTC,"The Chubs were canned last August. Not sure about the Weyerbacher. Both tasted just fine though, as they were high ABV beers that rely on the malts for flavor. They had a few IPAs on similar sale that wouldn't be anywhere near as good.  It isn't as easy as calling the brewery in South Carolina. They still use the three-tier system here"
CraftBeer,35fupy,lager_ibarleyknowher,1 point,Fri May 15 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"They use the three tier system everywhere. I'm just saying that the distributor and brewery would probably be grateful for a heads up that their products are being sold when the taste is extremely subpar.  Canned, pasteurized beer stays good for 6 months refrigerated. That chub is at 9 months. If it's a consumers first experience with the beer, it won't be a good one."
CraftBeer,35fupy,lager_ibarleyknowher,1 point,Fri May 15 13:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think that varies a lot by which beer you're looking at. By that argument nobody should ever age beer.  I could barely taste a difference with the last Nitro Chub I had, and that's because they tweaked the Old Chub recipe. At least that's what the quality control manager at the Brevard brewery told me"
CraftBeer,35fupy,lager_ibarleyknowher,1 point,Fri May 15 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"I'm really not trying to argue and hope I don't come across that way. I have a beer cellar at home and absolutely understand proper aging. At 6.9% the ABV isn't high enough to support proper aging. It may be okay to drink and even have a minimal loss in flavor at 9 months but it's not how the brewery intended for the beer to be consumed.   Plus, if I'm new to the beer scene and see chub for $1 at a liquor store, then $7 on draft, I'll never drink it fresh when it's most delicious. It changes the perception of the product.  It's just a shitty business practice in my opinion, that's all."
CraftBeer,35fupy,lager_ibarleyknowher,1 point,Fri May 15 15:08:11 2015 UTC,"No worries, we are debating - not arguing. Chub is 8%. Still not high enough for long-term aging, but more resilient than a lot of beers.  The price argument is fair, and I guess I am biased by coming at it from the opposite direction. I've had Chub straight from the brite tank (not Nitro) and I've bought it fresh on tap. I know that if I can get even a little of that experience for 99 cents, that is a complete steal.  You don't have to worry about more consumers being put off by this particular sale. I bought them all ;) And I will make a point of visiting that beer store every time I'm in town to see if they have any new bargains. That drives business that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise, making it a good business decision in my book.  In the end I don't think anyone expects to get a prime product on clearance. Whether it's last season's fashion for jeans or a slightly flavor reduced beer people know they are paying less for a reason. If somebody let the can they picked up out of a bargain bin turn them off a brewery they need to adjust their world view"

CraftBeer,35am49,Urtedrage,2,Fri May 8 17:58:43 2015 UTC,Just realized the irony of the can of Heady Topper sitting in my beer fridge in the pic. Ha.
CraftBeer,35am49,mcbane50,1 point,Fri May 8 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"I must say that I do agree to a point. I live across the lake from Vermont on the New York side of Lake Champlain, I have seen people lined up on release day for Heady Topper and Lawson's just to grab two 4 packs that likely will only last them until dawn the next day. They seem to have mastered the supply demand curve and as a result have maintained profitable breweries by making sure that people will always go out of their way to get it, when in fact there are readily available libations that are very similar and just as good, if not better. Personally I prefer Dogfish 90 Minute, and Bell's Hopslam over Heady and I can almost always find them at a local craft beer store without having to wait. However on the flip side of things I also look at the fact that these breweries are not expanding, and are (as of right now) unwilling to make any sacrifices to the quality of their product. Years ago Magic Hat used to be one of my favorite breweries, then around 2003 they began to expand, they started using extracts rather than raw ingredients, this impacted the flavor and multiple other characteristics of their beer, it's rare now when I find one of their beers really appealing (Big Hundo is a recent exception). I feel that there is something to be said about small operations unwilling to compromise, and as a result never be able to fulfill the demand that needs to be yawn into account. I won't argue, it sucks when I can't find my favorite beers available, but at the same time, this also makes me keep trying new stuff, but as far as ratings go, yeah I completely agree, just because you can only rarely enjoy something doesn't make it better!"
CraftBeer,35am49,dsn0wman,1 point,Sat May 9 23:36:47 2015 UTC,"I really think that an IPA is best from a local brewer. In San Diego PTE isn't a rare find, but I still rate it highly. What's better though is a seemingly never ending string of IPAs from smaller local breweries like Alpine, Societe, Modern Times, Accoustic Ales, Pizza Port.    With the rate that IPA and hop trends change any small brewery is really at an advantage because they don't have to waste time on legacy brews (see Stone IPA).     And, while I think I am sitting here in an IPA mecca, there is some brewery in Minnesota knocking it out of the park just as hard, and all the locals are swearing its way better than Surly."

Many people in your shoes either have Belgian trading partners, hookups with their local shops/distributors, or plan exotic lambications with their significant others.  Others trade their highly sought-after local brewery only releases (typically with 1-2 bottle limits) to folks online local or further afield in exchange for these lambics and gueuzes.  Online shops in Belgium usually sell out of Cantillon immediately or list the beers at 5-10x the price at the brewery where they sit waiting to be bought by people who have more money than time/patience/resources.    TL;DR:  You are pretty much shit out of luck unless you want to overpay.  Harsh? yes, but factual."

CraftBeer,354ds2,Bentonkb,4,Thu May 7 00:30:22 2015 UTC,"To answer the question in your title, yes. There are some towns that are ""unworthy"" of having a brewpub.Keep in mind that it is not because they don't deserve it, but because there's a lot of variables or factors that may help or hinder the survival of a brewpub or actually any kind of shop or restaurant in a small town.  I too live in a small town (a bit less than 7000 citizens) and it's been four months since a brand new brewpub opened their doors and I really hope that they succeed and keep going for many years because I think that's a pretty huge plus for the town.  So, what should a brewpub consider when they are planning to settle in a small town? Here's some of the many elements that should be taken into account:  Customers: First and foremost, a brewpub can't survive if there's not a sufficient pool of customers. Let's not consider exportation for now, if you live in a really small town, you should rely on two things: nearby towns and tourism. If there's a sufficient and steady flow of regular customers and tourists, it should be fine. In my opinion, brewries like Tête d'Allumette at Saint-André-De-Kamouraska and La Captive (Which, by the way, is up since 2010) in Amqui rely mainly on those aspects.  When you take exportation into account, you open up to more opportunities and can, to a certain point, be the main source of income for the brewery. Pit Caribou in Anse-À-Beauflis (or Percé) relies strongly on exportation. À l'Abri de la Tempête in the Magdalen Islands may be the best example for the balance between tourism, regular customer pool and exportation.  Location and Market Saturation: That's another point that can affect the survivability of a brewpub. Market saturation may be a lot more complex than the way I will explain it but in simple terms, If there's ""X"" people who likes to drink beer in a given area, the brewpub market will saturate at ""Y"" number of pubs. If there's a lot of brewpubs relatively close to your town, the market could be too much saturated (spelling?, word?) to let a pub in yours. As an example, with 9 Brewries for a population of 80 000 inhabitants in the Gaspé Peninsula, I consider that the actual market is pretty close to be saturated.  I can't think of other factors at the moment. For those who wish to correct me on some points, please go on but consider that I'm just a 21 year old beer geek who knows nothing about marketing and economics. Have a nice day sir!"

It keeps the beer colder and fresher longer, according to the brewery I got it at which uses it exclusively, the manufacturer, and my personal usage.

CraftBeer,35286p,BeefyMcPissflaps,1 point,Wed May 6 19:54:48 2015 UTC,Looks similar to a hydroflask?
CraftBeer,35286p,sadisticrhydon,-1,Wed May 6 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, you can even find insulated ones. Honestly when I used to work at a brewery, the non-glass growlers were the worst. You can't tell when they're filled unless you let them overflow a little, and even then they won't stay fresh very long. They're better built, but I wouldn't sit on what you put in them for too long."
CraftBeer,35286p,ispitinyourcoke,2,Wed May 6 14:58:18 2015 UTC,I agree. Beer-wise they don't offer any benefit. Great for shipping and sipping pool-side (where glass is typically not allowed).
CraftBeer,35286p,jasonumd,2,Wed May 6 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"I think you've got it backwards. Everything I've ever seen on the stainless growlers, reviews, unsafe, etc. indicates the beer lasts longer in them."

I'd love to try some others though. Any suggestions?"

The most popular ones are Minerva and Tempus, which you might find in a mexican specialized store I guess.  Wendlandt has good ones, their IPA called Perro del Mar is pretty awesome. There is another great brewery in Tijuana that colaborated with stone and Chris Banker. They made the most enjoyable beer of 2014, that you might find it easier. Take a look at this video: https://youtu.be/EDFw-3j9ndc  Their beers are really good. I can name others, but not sure if you could find them. If you ever find, take a picture, tweet it to me at @betoarpi  and I can suggest :)"

CraftBeer,34j8fo,Beard_faced,1 point,Fri May 1 22:38:01 2015 UTC,I'd say it's trivial but not silly. What's silly is that people fall for such tactics.
CraftBeer,34j8fo,Pringlecks,7,Fri May 1 23:15:41 2015 UTC,It's easy to see how a new comer to craft beer would grab blue moon thinking that it is a craft beer. It sells itself as that and the only way to know is to do some research or have a knowledgeable friend. An uninformed consumer who wants to support craft beer and is a casual beer drinker would never know.
CraftBeer,34j8fo,Beard_faced,4,Sat May 2 00:29:26 2015 UTC,"You're completely right.  I'm a craft beer snob and my friends know this.  I received a picture text from a friend saying ""Have you tried this beer yet?  It's good!  Belgian-y!"".  Guess what beer it was?  Shocktop This was me"
CraftBeer,34j8fo,CrkdLtrN,2,Sat May 2 04:07:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, I had to correct someone from Australia here who commented about wishing they could get there hands on some Shocktop craft beer from America. Innocent, but triggered the same face palm. They had had it before and thought it was fantatsic.

Although, even if you lived in their town (Burlington, VT) it doesn't seem to mean you'd get your hands on any easily. People literally line up and buy them out each release. The few places that sell the cans limit people to a half case per run. Like anything in life though I guess the really good stuff is usually more rare.    For anyone curious about the Topper."
CraftBeer,34j8fo,MiyamotoKnows,2,Sat May 2 15:21:34 2015 UTC,He's basically suing them because he was ignorant about beer.
CraftBeer,34j8fo,jordaniac89,7,Sat May 2 03:40:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think this guy is an idiot.  Sure millercoors is a bad company and I'm not a fan of blue moon, but that is a ridiculous lawsuit.  If you're not informed enough to make the right beer decisions ten that's your fault.  People in this country need to stop suing people over nothing."
CraftBeer,34j8fo,notmyrealname17,5,Sat May 2 13:12:56 2015 UTC,"What other recourse is there other than a suit? Why blame the consumer when you said it yourself ""millercoors is a bad company?""   My point is putting the onus on the consumer to be informed about every single product in the supermarket is something of an unreasonable request IMO. So, it should fall to the makers and sellers of products to be as open and honest about their wares."
CraftBeer,34j8fo,notmyrealname17,2,Sat May 2 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"I just don't really see what the big deal is here.  Just because I think they're a bad company doesn't mean that they should be punished.  People are buying their products, so they must be doing something right.  When I was 18 I drank Coors because I didn't know any better.  As I got older I figured out what good beer is, and I haven't bought any since.  Should I blame Coors for misleading me to buy their product or myself for not doing the research to realize it was bad beer?"
CraftBeer,34j8fo,notmyrealname17,2,Sat May 2 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think that companies should be punished, but I think that misleading the customer is on par with snake oil salesmen. It just doesn't sit well with me."

Everything they make is limited batch, I am aging one (it's actually the barrel aged version).  I can get their stuff when they release it. Forcefield (DIPA) was exceptional. I've seen Grimm stuff in Maine tho when I went up.  I have 1 - Dog 120 day, but its a few months old.  2014 Southern Tier ""Rumking"" Pumking aged in Rum barrels  2014 Brooklyn Black Ops  2015 Stone Old Guardian  2014 Goose Bourbon County  And although I ran out of my batch of Dinner, my people who came with me still have their cases, maybe I can convince them to trade.  Dunno if they're gonna do 1:1 though, they're holding them like crown jewels haha Dinner fyi is available only on special release, next one is this summer (dunno which month, website might have it), I think it's the first year they are doing two releases.  And it is NOT distributed in any retail store or bar, they don't even pour it in their tap room.  Brewery only type of deal like Resurgam.    edit: Also getting a ton of grapefruit sculpin, and habanero (currently out but more coming) down here, didn't see that up north when I went.

I'm sure they do tours, but we just stopped in for a bit.  I'm new to the area, but Salem has a few breweries.

Although I'm sure this clown still champions better access and more progressive liquor laws he uses those same ""tee toddling"" mantras to form his argument.   More brew pubs allow children. This is bad because they see adults drink alcohol, which is bad?   Ridiculous. How is Watching responsible adults drink beer in a nice environment worse than having the forbidden tavern that only over 21 can go into. The kids try and sneak into this forbidden treasure and don't know how to act when they get in at 21.  That argument is akin to never letting a kid in a car and handing him a license and keys at 16 and telling him to have fun.    The argument for kids that don't know how to act ruining the environment in a pub is also a straw man.  -Can anyone tell me what happens to unruly patrons in any eating/drinking establishment? I mean there is a whole job category based on this issue. If an adult acts like an idiot in a bar/pub/restaurant he/she gets kicked out. Is his concept foreign to the authour? Is the authour too closed minded to possibly consider that this would apply to under 21's?  -Not to mention that most of this is alleviated by restaurants and pubs for the past decades having specific all ages sections. This isn't new.   The authour of this article is no better than the regressive tee totalling lobbyists arbitrarily restricting growler fills, abv, and creating restrictive policies on off sales, etc (mostly devoid of logic)  I'm surprised this authour doesn't suggest going back to taverns without windows so that passerbyes don't see the lushes drinking their poison."

Sours are making their comeback, so any kind of barrel aged sour.  Meads too, keep a mead on.  Ireland love their dry porters/stouts so you could always look into American renditions such as Moylan's Dry Irish Stout. Also look into flavored porters like Saranac Caramel Porter, Girl Scout Cookie Stout, or Chai Milk Stout.  You may have to settle for bottles rather than draft.  As for spirits look into point ratings. Vodka like Purity is so versatile.  The trend is anything new from a reputable company. So get to know what the best breweries are out there. beeradvocate.com or ratebeer.com"
CraftBeer,34376y,spidersthrash,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:12:25 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I doubt OP's chances of getting a lot of America stuff. I've been into my craft beers for about 6/7 years now, since they first started taking off in Ireland, and I have yet to see a Stone, or anything like it.  What's reputable in the states is mostly unknown here, and our most recognizable and available American crafts beers are Brooklyn, Sam Adams, Sierra Nevada, Founders, O'Dells and maybe Anchor Steam. And that's pretty much it. We just don't get that much of a selection, or at least, certainly not with any consistency.  In 5 years with access to really good selections I've seen maybe 1 Dogfish Head, and a couple of Great Divides, before they stopped exporting. We literally just started getting Lagunitas there about two or three months ago. Unfortunately, most of the medium sized craft breweries just don't even export here, and the pricing can be prohibitive if they do, considering the mark up on shipping, and out large tax on alcohol.   That's not to say we don't get a lot of North American beer of course, but it seems like the ones I always see on this subreddit (so, I think we can agree, some of the most popular, if we're not talking about white whales) satisfy their local demands before looking at exports, and Ireland just isn't that huge or important a market to them."
CraftBeer,34376y,nugelz,2,Tue Apr 28 09:59:41 2015 UTC,"Well, even just looking at Irish stuff alone, you have Eight Degrees, who, along with their standard fair (Howling Gale Pale Ale, Sunburnt Irish Red, Bohemian Pilsner and Knockmedown Porter) also do quite a bit of seasonal and once off stuff, including Hurricane IPA (which is amazing) and a few 'single hops series' stuff, so they'd be a good start, and a brewery to follow.  After that, Wicklow Wolf has been putting out beers for less than a year now, and seem to be very popular (in Dublin at least). Bonus points as they're an independent brewery that grow their own hops. Their newly released IPA is a weird beast, but very, very good.  Then you have Kinnegar, a Donegal brewery that's been growing in popularity over the last few years, and with very good reason. They do a couple of styles, but their Rustbucket Rye Ale is a standout for me (and I take my rye ales seriously!). They also have a few specialities and seasonals.  You also have O'Hara's, which has become so ubiquitous at this point (again, at least in Dublin) people are forgetting it's a craft beer, but it's Ireland's oldest craft brewery at this point, and still an absolute standout. They do a fairly traditional 'Irish range' (red ale, Irish Pale Ale, stout), but their Irish Pale Ale is just perfect, and their stout is so good I think it'll revitalize people's love of stout, given time. Their Leann Folainn extra stout is possibly the best thing you will ever drink too, and they also do a Helles that may have converted me to light beer.  Oh, and of course, you have Trouble Brewing, who have been fighting the good fight for years now. Dark Arts Porter and Sabotage IPA are their big bottled ones (Dark Arts is on tap too though, if I remember correctly), but they have quite a range.  Same goes for Metalman from Waterford. Their Pale Ale is excellent, and who do monthly releases of special and limited release stuff, so they'd be well worth looking at.  Then you have the Porterhouse, the behemoth of Irish Brewpubs, but they're very popular and their Plain is a great stout, and I see it pop up all over.  There are a few more breweries around too, although I haven't tried them yet so I can't say much, like N7 and Jack Cody's. The only one I'm loathe to mention is Franciscan Well. A venerable Irish craft brewery, and a very good one too, but about a year or two ago they were bought out by AB InBev. They kept their brewmaster, and they still make good beer (their new-ish Chieftain IPA is excellent, for example), but I'd prefer to support local, independent brewers, rather than the corporate giants, if only because Ireland has only had the corporate giants' stuff for decades now!  Best of luck with it anyway! Out of curiosity, where are you based?"

Since warm weather is upon us, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, there's going to be a ton of superb saisons, hefeweizens, pale ales, and IPAs (with all their permutations) being released for us to enjoy. I'm from the East Coast but I've spent most of my formative beer years in CA.  I've tried to make list of the best beers I think might be available in NYC and that a new drinker should try. Yes, there are no dark beers, well I typically prefer the porters, stouts, etc. during the colder months.  Maybe by then you'll have a better idea of your palate's likes/dislikes.  Hope this helps!

CraftBeer,342lby,TurniptheLed,2,Mon Apr 27 23:22:39 2015 UTC,"I'd add some more potent saisons to the mix, Allagash Saison, Boulevard Tank 7.  A damn good pilsner, Lagunitas Pilz (Czech styled) is underrated, victory prima for a very hopped but still traditionally styled german pils, crisp (for a citrusy American take on the German Pilsner).  Stouts! Left Hand Milk Stout for the sweet (get a nitro bottle so you can turn it over and dump into a 16oz glass and go ""ooo, aaah"") , or Carton of Milk if you can find it on draft.  Carton of Milk is dope stuff. Rockaway Nitro Gold (also draft only) for something without the overly chocolatey and coffee flavors, think more of a roastier Guiness with touches of those aforementioned flavors rather than globs of them.  If Rockaway Nitro Gold was a person with a butt, I'd give it a light smack and say ""good stuff"". Ballast Point Victory at Sea for a fine example of what the perfect blending of complementing ingredients can really be like (still floating around but limited time).  Add Sculpin (IPA) as one of the most awesomest IPAs eveeeerrrr.  If you ever see Grimm Double Negative just buy it.

Start off like we all did - you buy something and then you try it. If you like it, buy similar beers of that style. If you don't, I wouldn't entirely write that style off, I'd still buy another beer or two in that style to see if it was that particular beer or the style itself you don't care for.  Does your local beer market let you buy individual bottles / mixed six packs? Those are the best ways to start finding out what you like.   Also get the ""untappd"" app for your smartphone. It's basically a beer logbook that lets you track and rate the beers you drink. It will also recommend other beers based upon your rating of a particular beer."

Then sample different beers, but it's best if you have some kind of game plan. Just randomly guzzling everything on offer will mean you quickly won't taste (or remember) anything. Done right, you will leave the festival with some beers you really like. That's a good starting point. Like with books, or travel, or anything else: one good beer leads to many new good beers.  I also recommend A Brewer's Tale by William Bostwick. A good book that provides historical context for your enthusiasm. And some good suggestions.   And keep it fun.

They had a witbier that was good and a few other styles that I think are good representations but accessible. I don't live in SG anymore so I don't really know what else you can easily find.
CraftBeer,34090g,Urtedrage,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:33:32 2015 UTC,Try wheat ales and witbeirs as some other options.
CraftBeer,34090g,_blue_bomber,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:08:31 2015 UTC,"If you want to stay on the yeasty side of flavor, expand into saisons and Belgian styles. If you are interested in trying a new direction, brown and scotch ales are good styles that get the majority of their flavor profile from malts without being quite as heavy as a porter.  Hops are something you need to work your way into. Hoppier pale ales are a good stepping stone - Flying Dog's Doggy Style is one I enjoyed before I got into the heavier IPAs."
CraftBeer,34090g,_blue_bomber,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:56:29 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the advice. Are there any saisons and Belgian ales that you would recommend in particular?"
CraftBeer,34090g,12sub,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:44:09 2015 UTC,"La Trappe Quadrupel is one of my favorites, blending both the yeasty and malty flavors. Tripels are also good ""starter Belgians"". See if you can find La Fin Du Monde (Unibroue).  Saisons can be very hit or miss, depending on your personal taste. I like them a little dry with strong fruity esters and a hint of spice, but I guarantee you won't find my favorites in Singapore. Go to the store with the biggest selection and pick up a few different ones to get an idea of what direction you want."
CraftBeer,34090g,redsoxrule201,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:09:26 2015 UTC,"First off, be patient. It has taken me years to expand the taste profile of beers that I enjoy. Second, lagers are underrated, and if you already like some of the macrobrewey lagers, you'll love the micros. There are lots of styles(dunkel, pilsener, helles, etc) for you to explore. Third, if you like wheat beers, check out saisons and Belgian beers, those might be styles you'd enjoy. Finally, a lot of the macros make ""craft"" style beer. Since you're in Singapore, it might be easier to get your hands on those. No reason not to as you search out real craft brews and discover new flavors and they can be a cheap introduction. Blue Moon (Coors) may be international, not sure, and makes a generally well liked wheat beer."

I'd get 1-2 growler fills a week, and I joined the pint club.  The second month in happened to be the first Sac Republic game, (local soccer team, for those unaware).  Up to that point, you could get growlers of anything, so when I was told that they were only filling growlers of 2-3 of their 7 beers, I was surprised.  When I was told that they were doing so in order to have beer left for when the game ended, I was pretty pissed.  I tried again a month of so later, and the same thing happened.  Sad, but I learned that Track 7 is not for me, nor do I think it's close to the best beer in Sacramento."

CraftBeer,33qodg,OttotheBear,2,Fri Apr 24 19:50:04 2015 UTC,"Omnipollo, as far as I am aware, is a partnership of two guys, one of whom is a fashion designer of some kind (Cheap Monday jeans or something) and he does all the amazing labels.  12% Imports brings them into the country, so you theoretically can find it places where you see Evil Twin and Stillwater.  The labels are amazing, and the beer is generally deserving of the packaging.  The bottles are expensive, but the art definitely helped move them in my experience. Shipping doesn't do hoppy beers any favors, but Omnipollo's have been in amazing shape when I've had them.  Art, even when it is on beer labels, is a subjective thing.  That said, I think these are some of the sharpest looking bottles around.  They're all good, but the one for Leon might be my personal favorite."

Look at all this free publicity they're getting!  3 months later and we're STILL talking about their Super Bowl ad.  This could not have been more successful for Budweiser.  Here, let's all say it a few more times :  Budweiser, Budweiser, Budweiser.  You want to know what a successful response would be, Craft Beer?  Nothing.  Ignore them.  As we used to say on the internet a long time ago:  PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS"
CraftBeer,33ctp4,zodar,10,Tue Apr 21 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"While I see your point of view and its validity that Budweiser is getting free press by the complaints, consumers like myself who were indifferent to Budweiser and would drink their products if there were minimal options or a good special find that the ads are insulting enough that I now go out of my way not to drink an Anheuser-Busch product.   They realized they had to solidify their base by insulting those of us who explore other beer options. It's a bold move and I guess we'll keep seeing if it pays off. They still need to find ways to appeal to post college drinkers who are over chugging Bud Light from a solo cup.

CraftBeer,33ctp4,zodar,2,Tue Apr 21 17:40:49 2015 UTC,"I know, it's frustrating. And it's transparent. I honestly wouldn't mind seeing Budweiser try their hand more at their own craft beers instead of acquiring regionally successful craft breweries. Yuengling is trying it, I occasionally see Guinness do something slightly different, and of course Sam Adams pioneered part of the industry. Budweiser could try this but instead they laterally acquire breweries while simultaneously insulting the people who buy from those breweries. Which seems counter-productive to the reasons why they're absorbing craft breweries.  They could keep releasing their signature products while expanding and becoming more accessible to a growing market with Budweiser brand craft beer. I dislike the way they conduct their business and promote their products, so I'll do what I can to avoid them for now."

CraftBeer,33ctp4,munche,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:57:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say the opposite, normally I'd agree with the no publicity is bad publicity bit, but in this case the more individuals you pull into trying craft beer and opening up to it the more people you have never going back to budweiser. None of the individuals that are seeing these ads and are not drinking budweiser will go out and start drinking it again, they will be less likely overall to buy it period, but for the people who only drank budweiser they might want to see what all the fuss is about with craft beer.

CraftBeer,339s1z,JaridT,2,Tue Apr 21 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"National Beer Day (United States):       Recognized nationwide among beer enthusiasts,   National Beer Day is an unofficial holiday in the United States celebrated every year on April 7, celebrating the day in 1933, the first day in 13 years,  that people could legally buy, sell, and drink beer.  National Beer Day is a celebration of the Cullen–Harrison Act being signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 22, 1933. That law went into effect on April 7 of that year, allowing people to buy, sell and drink beer again as long as it was < 3.2% alcohol-by-weight (4.05% alcohol-by-volume). People across the country responded by gathering outside breweries, some beginning the night before. On that first day, 1.5 million barrels of beer were consumed, inspiring the future holiday.  Today, April 7 is recognized as National Beer Day and April 6 is known as New Beer's Eve.      Interesting: Beer | Low-alcohol beer | Beer festival   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

CraftBeer,3389zw,Pegasus8891,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"Damn.  Question, how does it get taxed.  Is it anything like our 3 tier system.  I'm sure I could google it but I assume you know and can dumb it down for me"
CraftBeer,3389zw,hughthewineguy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"That's a hard question to answer and I'm pretty sure that's how the government wants it to be haha. So we have a tax Excise which increases dependent on the ABV and the volume. This also controls the size of the vessel for instance our growlers have to be under 2L or they hit a higher excise level so they are all 1.89L, also I can't use 50L kegs to fill said growlers as that also incurs another level of excise. The tax Excise increases twice every year buy a small amount. Once you get you head around all of that wack on an extra 10% fro GST and there you have it. Wine tax is worse again, it hits about 41.9% tax by the time it lands in my shop."
CraftBeer,3389zw,hainque,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:19:53 2015 UTC,Wow most places here the growler is $5-6 and the fill depends on what you get 60min dog fish head was $10 I think and <$1 in tax

CraftBeer,3389zw,Surfinpicasso,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:17:33 2015 UTC,The idea is to show everyone what a Growler is as the trend is still fairly new here. I few other shops have fillers but they are hidden away in the back corner of the cold room and don't really get much exposure apart from the people that seek it out.   So far people that have never heard of the concept have been getting pretty excited at buying there first growler or squealer. So yeah it does let some cool air out which is a downside but the exposure has been massive. Also the cold room has 2 huge cooling units so it holds its tempature very well.
CraftBeer,3389zw,hughthewineguy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:23:47 2015 UTC,I'm getting more and more sad over the fact that the alcohol laws here (Sweden) doesn't allow for buying growlers of beer..

CraftBeer,338bwi,jpguitfiddler,3,Mon Apr 20 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"There are a few problems here: alcohol for retail sale has to go through the middleman of a distributor. A bar cannot go to a store and buy products to sell in their establishment. New Glarus, maker of Spotted Cow, is pretty well known for not distributing outside of Wisconsin as a point of local pride, so one theoretically will never see any of their products outside of WI. Finally, putting this all together, whoever went to Wisconsin, bought Spotted Cow, and then foolishly advertised it is now on the hook for, among other things, trafficking alcohol over state lines with intent to sell."

Its smell bursts into the surrounding area like no other beer I've encountered, the taste is a juiciness from start to finish that I have not found comparable in any beer.  Picture that best taste that you get from Swift, Lunch, sculpin, union jack, etc.. but in those beers it's momentary, and now imagine it as a start to finish experience from when it first hits your lips, to when the last drop falls down into your stomach.  It's &%$#ing amazing and I can see why the release is like an iphone release or a new jordans sneaker release, the beer is just that good."

If you are in that area though, definitely hit Cambridge Brewing, kids are more than welcome there.  Saccos is a great suggestion with kids the food is awesome and the tap list is always top notch.  Also defintely do both Trillium and Nightshit. Trillium is more a stop in grab bottles/growlers and go. Nightshift's tap room is pretty nice, and there are always kids around.  For stores you will probably need to leave Boston for the really good places. Craft Beer Cellar's are in a few suburbs with their flagship store in Belmont.

CraftBeer,32kdq2,crunchy_nipples,6,Tue Apr 14 14:26:09 2015 UTC,Deep Ellum IPA is fantastic. Revolver Blood & Honey is very good Rahr & Sons Bourbon Barrel Aged Winter Warmer (although there may not be any bottles left) Lakewood Temptress   Jester King also makes a bunch of good beers.  Lone Star Beverages is probably the best beer store in the metro.
CraftBeer,32kdq2,PaddysMac,2,Tue Apr 14 15:23:11 2015 UTC,"+1 for Deep Ellum IPA. Super tasty and they can it, so it is light and easy to transport."

CraftBeer,32kdq2,hikeon3,2,Tue Apr 14 14:52:22 2015 UTC,I've heard of Jester King before but im just starting to try to get into sours and that is what ive heard they do best. Do they do other styles that are worth trying?
CraftBeer,32kdq2,hikeon3,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:16:11 2015 UTC,Black Metal Stout is awesome. They used to make a beer called Wytchmaker Rye IPA which was awesome. I'm not sure if they still make it though.
CraftBeer,32kdq2,Allanine,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yes they still do, but its hard to find."
CraftBeer,32kdq2,BourbonScotchWhiskey,-2,Wed Apr 15 01:59:36 2015 UTC,"I think Jester King is perhaps a bit overhyped. I love WHAT they do and HOW they do it, but at the end of the day they're making beer that tastes like sour cherries fermented with hay in a wine barrel. If your goal is to challenge and sometimes overwhelm your tastebuds then JK is great but it is not everyone's cup of tea despite what ""beer connoisseur culture"" is pushing right now."
CraftBeer,32kdq2,jvidako86,2,Tue Apr 14 15:54:41 2015 UTC,Upvote.
CraftBeer,32kdq2,hikeon3,3,Sun Apr 19 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"Jester King of Austin, St Arnold of Houston. Karbach is also good. New Republic in College Station has a pretty good DIPA.   Rahr & Sons has great offerings pretty much all of their stuff.  Tell your girlfriend to scope out any Spec's Liquor stores if there any in her area. They have the widest selection of craft beers I think of any of the chains Ive been into. We also get a lot of great stuff from Colorado like Elevation and Odell.   Eleveations DIPA 7437 is heavenly and my guilty pleasure"
CraftBeer,32kdq2,Jonksa,2,Tue Apr 14 15:24:58 2015 UTC,Also came here to recommend St. Arnold's and Karbach. Tried them when I was in Houston and was very pleased.
CraftBeer,32kdq2,craftbeard,2,Tue Apr 14 15:54:21 2015 UTC,+1 for Karbach. Hopadillo is a solid IPA. Their Weisse-Versa is actually an excellent Bavarian-style hefe. Their spring seasonal Kolsch this year is really good too and I prefer it hands down to St Arnold's Lawnmower (which is also a Kolsch).
CraftBeer,32kdq2,Jonksa,3,Tue Apr 14 15:59:35 2015 UTC,Don't think I've seen it mentioned yet: Austin Beer Works if you can find it.  My Favs in no particular order  Pearl Snap -  pils  Peacemaker -  extra pale ale  Heavy Machinery -  Black IPA  Fire Eagle -  IPA
CraftBeer,32kdq2,hikeon3,2,Tue Apr 14 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"FYI Heavy Machinery is a rotating IPA series, so it will change with each release. Can be hard to get on a quick visit as it isn't continuously available. Their Fire Eagle IPA is year round though."

CraftBeer,32kdq2,bonannophone,3,Tue Apr 14 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely second the sentiment on Karbach.  Mother in Lager (it's a seasonal and I don't believe it's in season, unfortunately) really changed my view on lagers in general - apparently they can have some depth.  Weisse Versa is a great go-to for outdoor stuff; it's a hefe and a wit mixed together.  The IPAs are solid, but not really my bag.  Weekend Warrior pale ale is more like a session IPA.  Reminds me a lot of Founder's All Day IPA.  Also, they're all in cans.  I dig the can thing."
CraftBeer,32kdq2,AceTrainerJS,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:24:45 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, man. Karbach is a new go-to for me. You can find most of their beers at HEB so it is really convenient to grab a sixer of Hopadillo or their seasonal (Kolsch right now) right alongside the normal groceries."

CraftBeer,326k1c,fuck_u_very_much_too,3,Sat Apr 11 00:28:54 2015 UTC,There's a lot of really great small crafts in Southwest Ohio. Rhinegeist has gotten big recently with their wide variety. But there's a lot of smaller ones doing cool things like Listermann and Ei8ht Ball.
CraftBeer,326k1c,Martient712,2,Sat Apr 11 01:54:01 2015 UTC,I have yet to have rhinegeist but there are so many amazing Ohio Brewers.  Like Jackie o's I feel should be a more sought after brewery.  I mean dark apparition is amazing and bourbon barrel black maple is out of this world.  Mad tree has Galaxy high and fatheads has hop juju.  I'm waiting on some cans of heady but I feel Galaxy ranks right up there with Pliny so far.  Or even the brew kettles white rajah.  I feel people are missing out on so super quality beers and want to help spread the word.
CraftBeer,326k1c,o0anon0o,2,Sat Apr 11 02:16:35 2015 UTC,"Great Lakes is the only one I know of at all. They have good stuff, black out stout is awesome."

CraftBeer,325ir6,carlksufan,3,Fri Apr 10 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"What kind of beers are you into?    Belgians:  Harriet Brewing IPAs:  Surly Porter/Stout:  Dangerous Man Off the Wall Weird:  Bent Brewstillery  A LOT of posters are going to say that Surly is the only brewery worth visiting if you only get one.  But personally I like to get off the beaten path and try out the breweries that are a little less heard of.  Your best bet overall would Dangerous Man, Town Hall, or Bent Brewstillery, but that my out-of-the-box opinion."
CraftBeer,325ir6,beerploma,2,Fri Apr 10 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"+1 for Town Hall at ""Seven Corners"" near the University of Minnesota campus. Amazing beers, great food, and an eclectic atmosphere.   I like it better than Surly honestly. It feels more original than Dangerous Man, Insight, or Indeed and is more accessible to public transportation (light rail/bus) if you aren't renting a car. Surly is also accessible by light rail and you really could hit both in the same day.   But if you really want to try a lot of local beers, hit up Republic just across the street from Town Hall. It has over 100 taps and a healthy percentage of them are local beers including Indeed, Badger Hill, Fulton, Bent Paddle, Summit, Surly, Northgate, Steel Toe, Hammerheart, Sociable Cider Werks, and Bauhaus. They have a lot and do flights of your own choosing.  If you want to fly some beer home try Surdyk's in Northeast. They have a pretty good selection of local stuff as well as some rarer favorites (Ballast Point Sculpin and Victory at Sea, Great Divide, seasonal Surly, etc.). They have online inventory covering most of what they carry but there are always surprises when I go.  EDIT: I also wanted to mention Third Street Brewhouse which is in St. Cloud, MN. Most of their year-round offerings are okay BUT the reason I mention them is they released an Imperial Coffee Porter named Cool Beans. (I actually know the guy who roasted the coffee beans for the beer.) It is one of my top 5 beers (1. Town Hall Czar Jack, 2. Surly Abrasive 3. Surly Darkness 2014 , 4. Third Street Cool Beans, 5. Great Lakes Chillwave) and I have purchased like 8 of them (drank 4, cellared 2, 2 to drink yet). I rarely repeat beers but this one is good. I even had it for breakfast with chocolate chip pancakes while a buddy and I brewed some beer. You can pick it up at local liquor stores. I have only seen it on tap at one bar and it had sold out already."
CraftBeer,325ir6,Grizzly_Adamz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:23:51 2015 UTC,I like the republic idea. Is that a restaurant or bar? I'm going to need some grub if the selection is that good.
CraftBeer,325ir6,Grizzly_Adamz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:59:59 2015 UTC,A bar with good food?   Here is their beer list and their menu.  And Town Hall is right across the street and there is a sushi place just down the way from both places.
CraftBeer,325ir6,OMEGA5_,0,Sat Apr 11 02:30:24 2015 UTC,"I'll 2nd that recommendation. They have a full menu and you'll have a chance to try a lot of the locals. Stay away from Surly, it's a fine taproom, but honestly it's too much IMO and sometimes the wait times are absurd.  Edit: there is also a Republic in Calhoun Square, if that may be closer to where you're staying.  More edit: Dangerous Man would be my other suggestion if you want a tap room experience. Bauhaus is cool too."
CraftBeer,325ir6,Grizzly_Adamz,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:16:30 2015 UTC,There is a Republic in Calhoun Square but be warned that their selection is about half of what is available at Seven Corners. I haven't gone through the list to count the beers made in MN and if there are any exclusives at either venue.   I would also call ahead to see if they have any special tapping events going on the weekend you come. Next week they are tapping Founder's KBS and I heard rumors they might be tapping some Surly Darkness soon before it really warms up.
CraftBeer,325ir6,cyrilspaceman,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"What day of the week are you coming? A lot of places only do things certain days a week. Town Hall only does a tour on the first Saturday of the month and Summit does tours Tuesday through Saturday. Surly's are on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. My personal favorites were Flat Earth (Tuesdays and Saturdays I believe) and Harriet Island, they have free mini tours on Saturday and full tours Thursday through Friday.   Town Hall brews my favorite beer in the twin cities. It is the most expensive of all of these, but you get a T Shirt."
CraftBeer,325ir6,AmericanHybrid1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely recommend dangerous man or surly. Town Hall is good if you want some good pub food, but if you're focused on solely beer, then I'd check out the other two"
CraftBeer,325ir6,Grizzly_Adamz,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"I personally think Town Hall's offerings are more unique and are rare outside of the Twin Cities. Surly is good but you can get trades going to get some Furious, Abrasive, or Darkness to your doorstep. Town Hall only serves at their three locations and unless you want to start shipping growlers it is tough, if not impossible, to come by it any other way. Dangerous Man is great but doesn't have a lot of options and their offerings taste very similar to the likes of Indeed, Insight, and the like. There isn't much genuine originality."

CraftBeer,323y3c,bodobeers,2,Tue Apr 14 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"TIL that NJ breweries tend not to distribute to Maryland much.  However it does look like Flying Fish makes it down there, so their Hopfish IPA is worth picking up.  If you ever find yourself up in NJ, Carton, River Horse, and Kane are all breweries worth your time.  Troegs should distribute to Maryland too, so their Perpetual IPA can fill a spot in PA for you.  I'm also a supporter of /u/m2daholla's suggestion of Founder's Centennial and All Day IPAs.  Founder's is one of those breweries that just never seems to disappoint.  Not sure I've ever had something from them I didn't enjoy.  On another note, how would you rate the quality of that map?  I've considered getting one before, but from the pictures it looks so thin that I'm worried it would snap in half if my cat knocked it down or something."
CraftBeer,323y3c,turdferguson001,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"there's two cap spots in PA, one already has a Victory cap in it and I'm actually grabbing a Perpetual IPA today to fill the other spot haha. Perpetual is also high up on my list. I will definitely check out some NJ breweries. I checked into founders and it seems like every surrounding state gets it besides MD, so I'll have to see if I can grab some next time I'm in PA.  The quality of the map is pretty nice. It is pretty thin, but I'm sure it could survive a drop off of the wall. I really like it for the idea of keeping track of where the beers are from and how diverse your selection is. I never realized that most of my favorites are only from California breweries, the map puts everything into a different perspective and brings new fun to craft beer."

CraftBeer,31wpzt,jbramley,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:30:46 2015 UTC,"From the comments:  Jim Vorel Mod  Guest • 19 hours ago Freshness of course plays a huge role, there's almost no getting around that.  Basically, I did a few things to attempt to control for that. One, we kept all of the beers cold. Two, I staggered the heats by how long it had been since we received the beers, among other factors. Basically, the ones that came in earlier got tasted sooner. Finally, whenever possible, we got fresh bottles for the final tasting.  It's not perfect of course, but we tried as hard as we could to make them all as fresh as they could be.  But of course, if they were all bottled the day before the tasting, the results would certainly be changed up a bit."

CraftBeer,31t0ha,Euckingfrik,2,Wed Apr 8 04:52:36 2015 UTC,"It's a big city, but here's where I'd send you to minimize travel/traffic pain:  Bottle Shops: Vendome Wine and Spirits (Bev Hills is cheaper, but the Toluca Lake location has great beer tastings Thurs, Sat, Sun that often turn into amazing impromptu bottle shares, highly recommend).   Valley Beverage and $ilverlake Liquor always have rare hard to find stuff, but you will pay a premium to shop there. Def worth checking out the selection.   Bars/restaurants (where the food is excellent as well):  Beachwood Brewing & BBQ,  Tony's Darts Away (just celebrated 5 years might still have some interesting stuff around), Franklin and Co.  Craftsman brewery (my L.A. favorite) doesn't bottle or have a tasting room, but do yourself a favor and find their stuff on tap. Any bar that has a good selection of Craftsman is worth your time. They are in Pasadena so lots of places in the area.   Breweries: Golden Road, Smog City, MacLeod Ale Brewing Co. in Van Nuys (trad. English session ales). Not a lot of places that adhere to this style and a good change of pace from the IPA scene.   I have not been yet, but Phantom Carriage Brewery looks interesting."

CraftBeer,31o6s5,JaridT,7,Mon Apr 6 21:01:53 2015 UTC,"San Diegan beer drinker here.   You can start out in the North Park area and hit up Fall St. Brewing, Thorn St. Brewery, Mike Hess Brewery, Rip Current, Belching Beaver and you could try out Toronado. Toronado is not a brewery but they supply 40-50 craft beers on draft and a lot of those are local beer. All of these are walking distance from each other.  When you're done in North Park, grab an Uber/Lyft and head downtown and you can try out Mission Brewery or head over to Little Italy and try out Ballast Point Brewery. From there, grab an Uber/Lyft again and hitch a ride over to Stone brewery in Liberty Station. I have heard the Stone in Escondido is a lot better brewery but in my opinion, it's too far away from all the other breweries.  Edit: Belching Beaver has been hit or miss across the board. Some people like it. Personally, I don't really care for any of their beers. And I get my ""some people"" because I'm an Uber/Lyft driver and I always chat with riders about different bars and restaurants down here. And, I was born and raised down here."
CraftBeer,31o6s5,BR0THAKYLE,3,Mon Apr 6 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"San Diegoite beer drinker here.   I agree with what this person said.  North Park is your hub for hitting the majority of the restaurants.

CraftBeer,31o6s5,warm_sweater,2,Mon Apr 6 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"I usually hit two legs while in San Diego.  First is North County.  Start with Lost Abbey / Port, and mile down the road is Stone Bistro.  You can easily spend lunch to dinner at these places.  The second is mira mesa.  There within a ten mile stretch (have a D.D.) is some great breweries.  Ballast Point (two of them).  One is the distillary and canning, the other is their newest and biggest brewery with plenty of one offs.  Personal favorite is peppermint Vistory at sea.  There is also Saint Archer, White Labs, and Green Flash is not far from there either.  And when you are at the beach hit up a Pizza Port, their beer and pizzas are amazing."

CraftBeer,31o6s5,LTshrink,2,Mon Apr 6 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"If you want the experience of a world-class brewery,  restaurant, and beer garden you have to go to stone's Escondido location. Ballast point has gorgeous spot in Sorrento Valley, though I've never been to their other locations. Also in the area is AleSmith, which is a tiny taproom, but they do amazing stuff. Karl Strauss has a nice beer garden/brunch spot in Sorrento valley, if you're into that. Same with Lost Abbey/Port Brewing (in San Marcos). A tiny warehouse of a taproom, but you can hit two delicious birds with one stone.  In my experience, the big name places with restaurants attached can get very busy, especially on weekends."

CraftBeer,31o6s5,LTshrink,2,Tue Apr 7 04:07:03 2015 UTC,The Modern Times locations are both great.  If you had transportation and love ipas I highly recommend getting out to Alpine. Society brewing is a great treat as well.  There are some great beer bars as well. Tornado would be a good stop for selection.

CraftBeer,31o6s5,Muddbiker,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:21:50 2015 UTC,AFAIK they do growler fills. I have not made it there since they started brewing Alpine so I'm not 100% sure on that.

CraftBeer,31qh4z,the_nickster,8,Tue Apr 7 10:55:27 2015 UTC,"This is a bad idea on many fronts:  1) Guessing you want to buy bulk because you want to re-sell. That's illegal! Items sold in NY must be first registered with NYS (so they can get their $). All it takes is a SLA employee (any employee) to walk in, notice the package, then slap you with a 10k fine. The only beer you mention there that is registered in NY is Maine - contact the appropriate wholesaler and get it from them.  2) If you do get that buy of Maine, bring it back, re-sell, and your wholesaler catches wind of it, your relationship with them will be greatly strained from the get-go of your new business venture. Thus kissing goodbye any chance you had of future ""rarities"" (because they're missing out on their slice of the pie).  3) Even if you ignore these things, and find the beer to re-sell, the customers you'll attract with these brands are not loyal, they'll come to your store to purchase these and only these products, then you'll never see them again - thwarting your entire plan and efforts.   Advice:  If you're hellbent on doing this, the only way to get quantity is to have numerous people working with you to buy the individual limits, then pool them together. There is no bulk buying. Case limit on Heady and Maine (if in inventory), and even pack limits on Lawsons. #'s are your only way.   Secondly, for the love of God, do your homework and learn how to run a bottle shop. Know the laws and work with your wholesalers. Its a reciprocal business, everyone gets their take of the $. If you try to skirt the system, you'll find yourself in a world of hurt and a tanking business.   TL:DR  where there's a will, there's a way. In this case, potentially illegal means to undesirable outcome"
CraftBeer,31qh4z,MadAsHops,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:22:20 2015 UTC,"Oh boy.  I should have mentioned that we are not reselling, of course.  It is a good point to make because I've seen people in bars in the city disregard this advice without realizing how much danger they are putting their SLA license in. The bottle shop is using them as giveaways (which is legal) to create buzz for their opening. I'm using it to sample with key clients (I work with bars and restaurants) to help me build my relationships."
CraftBeer,31qh4z,MadAsHops,2,Tue Apr 7 12:43:23 2015 UTC,"Giveaways, samples, you're correct - all legal. Phew! I'm sure you know, too many clueless people trying to capitalize on craft.   As I stated above, there is a way. Its not easy, but its what you'll need to do. Check out Heady Spotter and Lawsons Find Our Beer to know which locations they're delivering to that day. Load up your mules and be there 15/20 minutes ahead of each. You can go from stop to stop and buy limits at each retailer."
CraftBeer,31qh4z,smashy_smashy,3,Tue Apr 7 12:53:05 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the advice.  And also thanks for the informative post, anyone can gain a lot of insight from it!"
CraftBeer,31qh4z,smashy_smashy,3,Tue Apr 7 12:55:06 2015 UTC,"Since we've already cleared up that you are not reselling... 1 case limit per person on Maine Dinner, but I do not think there is a limit on cases of Lunch. Allagash is also releasing one of their coolships, which is right down the road, but that's a 4 bottle limit.   You won't find cases of Heady on the weekend. VT is no bueno on the weekend, especially Sunday. So if you do Maine on Saturday for Dinner, I do not think it will be worth your time to go to VT on Sunday as you won't find anything ""rare.""  It's about a 4 hour drive from Portland, ME to Hill Farmstead so you could presumably make that on Saturday if you get in the Dinner line really early. You might find a 4 pack of Heady in Stowe since it's the off season, but I wouldn't count on it.   I think you'd be better off going down to MA and picking up some Trillium and you might be able to make it over to Tree House but they are mostly growlers and the cans usually sell out quick on Saturdays.   In the future, Thursday is the best day for VT trips.   Giveaways are cool and it is a good way to spread the love of these beers. For the love of god, don't resell them. I believe that your intentions are pure, but I still have to say it."

CraftBeer,31kxdl,TheR1ckster,4,Mon Apr 6 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on what it is, most IPAs I tend to drink within 2-3 months at the longest. Sours & Belgian Ales I'll let sit a little longer, maybe 3-6 months. Barrel aged things and higher ABV beers like the 120 Minute IPA, World Wide Stout and others not pictured (Burton Baton, Allagash Curieux, Stone/10 Barrel Suede) I'll let age until I get a craving or want to share something with a friend.   I stocked up on extra Wicked Weed because my dad who used to live in Asheville will be in town next month and it's a surprise for him. When I went home for Christmas I took a few bottles I had aging for my aunt as a thank you for letting me stay at her house.   EDIT: Forgot to answer the how often I drink. Depends on the week, some weeks my girlfriend and I will go through 12-24 without a problem. Others we might not drink anything. On average I'd say we end up drinking a six pack a week and finish 1-2 750ml bottles. But we're also forever buying beer because it's something we like, something we want to try, or just something we've heard about so it's easy for us to hold onto things, that 120 is from a case we bought in 2013."

CraftBeer,31gtgg,haveyounosense,2,Sat Apr 4 23:12:53 2015 UTC,"Santa Cruz beers suck in general. But Sante Adairius in Capitola is sooooooooooooooo worth it. Very small, beer only, you can bring in your own food and there's no samplers or flights. But it's seriously worth it to try everything on tap there. They'll spoil you. Hermitage brewery in San Jose makes some great IPAs, favorite being the Citra Single Hop IPA. Uncommon Brewers in Santa Cruz might have some interesting taste palletes you may enjoy. They sell in cans and I think you can find them at Whole foods. It's one of the only 2-3 in the entire county I haven't visited. Their weird business hours have made it hard. If you want to get your sample on, Aptos St BBQ in Aptos has a GREAT selection of beers on tap to try, we're talking nationally known, but they don't sell bottles of what they draft on site. If you want to buy some 22s or six packs of decent beer, Beer Thirty in Capitola has a nice fridge full of craft beer from all over California. I forget which exit it's off of, but you can look it up on google maps. I think they may be what you're looking for. Or you could always just check become every now and then. But again, I strongly dislike the majority of Santa Cruz local beers. In terms of some California beers I like in general, of course there's everything Lagunitas makes, Ballast Point (San Diego), Green Flash (San Diego), Figueroa Mountain (Santa Maria), Firestoke Walker is ok, but by no means my favorite (Paso Robles), RUSSIAN FREAKING RIVER (Santa Rosa), Alesmith Brewing Company (San Diego), and whatever Stouts/IPAs Stone has out (not always, but generally good) in Escondido."

I live in a fairly large (west coast) town, and no one here in this part of AZ is getting KBS.

CraftBeer,31e0tm,Cannon1,2,Sat Apr 4 04:19:15 2015 UTC,"Most brewers recommend their stouts be drunken at ~50-55 degrees. I personally pour them cold around 40, but put them in my Spieglau/Left Hand stout glass so my hand will do the warming. The cold first sip makes a nice transition to the warmer, more flavorful chocolate or coffee intended to be found.  It all depends on what the brewer intends! That's why I love when brewers put the recommended glass and temps on the bottle label, and some bars do very well at keeping kegs at precise temps too."
CraftBeer,31e0tm,JGuR,2,Sat Apr 4 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"In general, I go by the color of the beer. The darker it is, the warmer I drink it. Stouts are 50-55 degrees, brown beers (ambers, Belgian dark ales, etc.) I shoot for 40-45, and lighter colored beers I drink straight from the fridge, which I believe puts them in the upper 30s. With those lighter beers, if its a nice beer, sometimes I'll drink part of it, then let it warm up a bit to see if it changes. If the beer has ""light"" in the name, I usually try to get it as cold as possible. Of course I always check the bottle label to see if there's a specified temperature on it and if there is, always go with that."

I used to eschew cans for bottles but since I pour most of my beers into glasses I don't get the metallic taste that most people dislike when drinking from a can.

CraftBeer,319kvl,saint_frattew,8,Fri Apr 3 02:16:51 2015 UTC,Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA is awesome.  Try Founders All Day IPA for something local that is really good as well.

I found an unfinished growler in the back of my fridge from like a year or so ago, no more than a pint worth.

CraftBeer,30zr2f,JGuR,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:19:23 2015 UTC,"They had to be taken off the list because for a few years they were not considered a craft brewery due to the ""adjunct rule"".  I think this is their first year back. Schell's too!"
CraftBeer,310bl9,sweetdeerocks,0,Wed Apr 1 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"You can modify any fridge so it pulls that temperature with a stc, but if you have a closet that is moderately cold like early 60s or below just go with that. Place a thermometer in the closet or space and see how cool it gets. I have a closet that stay around 60, so it's perfect but if you want it 50s you probably will want a fridge with an stc. There are tons of tutorials online to get your beer fridge to working status with an stc. Also don't get a wine fridge and place bottles on their side! I've seen it happen...."

CraftBeer,3102k6,furrald,-1,Thu Apr 2 04:08:57 2015 UTC,"I definitely wasn't advocating for crooked stave over any other brewers, just suggesting that OP should try crooked stave.   As to the tartness and funkiness, the CS taproom had 50 sours on tap the last time I was there. There were clean, tart sours and wild, funky sours. So depends more on what you select maybe?  If I'm ever in Woodland Park I will definitely need to check out Paradox, though."

Compare Bell's Two Hearted with Stone IPA with NoDa Hop Drop 'n' Roll with Cigar City Jai Alai. Four different IPAs that taste different from each other. Trying one beer from a style is only a small sip into the world of that style."

CraftBeer,30yrmb,oxicl3an,3,Wed Apr 1 00:36:22 2015 UTC,"Sours have just gone out of season but they're always in season somewhere: bottle or tap. I think all these other comments answer your question in different and awesome ways but for me, just generally speaking, sours are where the brunt of my 'outlandish' interest has been satiated. Also, 'experimentals' are thing too. Dogfish Head brews a whole host of year-round oddities that can get you started down different pallets. I'm sure there are other breweries with year-round 'experimentals' but as an east coast beer drinker that's the brewery i suggest with a healthy selection of a whole host of outlandish brews."

CraftBeer,30ppe7,mch,2,Sun Mar 29 21:44:06 2015 UTC,no rush.  i look forward to the info so I can plan accordingly.
CraftBeer,30ppe7,mch,8,Mon Mar 30 07:56:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean for this to get so long but I sat back and had a few beers this arvo and wrote this. Hopefully it will serve as a guide for most places in Perth.  First thing I want to clear up is my problem with Little Creatures. If you ask anywhere in Perth people will tell you it's the best beer in Perth and the best venue. While I will admit I don't mind there latest pale ale and the IPA I try not to support them on principle as they are part of Lion Nathan which is sort of the southern hemisphere version of AB INBEV or Miller Coors the big bad guys. Also they are Japanese owned and i'd rather my beer money stays in the country. That's my personal feelings about it but by all means make sure you give there beers a go and maybe even check out the venue in Freo it is nice but quite expensive.  There are 3 main areas for beer in Perth, The Swan Valley (30 mins), Fremantle (30 mins) and Margaret River (2.5 hrs). The times in the brackets are approx times from the city driving. So depending on the time you want to allocate to beer Freo followed by the Swan Valley are going to be your best bet. Margaret River while a little while away is beautiful and worth the trip but you might want to get a place to stay the night.  Swan Valley  Swan Valley is probably has the bulk of the breweries and there is a lot of other cool stuff to do out that way a few distilleries, chocolate factory and wineries.   The must see brewery of WA is Feral in the Swan Valley, these guys make a beer called Hop Hog which has won heaps of awards and you will find in most good bars. Decent enough beer but they keep all the good stuff at the brewery on tap. They are the first brewer in WA to also start dabbling in sour beers I believe. I think at the moment they have 3 sours on regularly. A Berliner Weiss a geuze style and I think the same beer blended with something else so it's less sour. They also have a lot of great barrel aged beers my personal fave if I had to pick one is the BFH. They use new french so it's got an interesting character. The barley wine and russian imperial stouts are also very good. If your heading here on the weekend make sure you book a table. Service and food seems to have dropped a little in recent years but it's reasonable enough. Take away bottles are available at the bar. https://www.feralbrewing.com.au/  Mash are another really good brewery they won the AIBA beer of the year award last year for there Copy Cat IPA so definitely give that a go as it's technically the best beer in Australia for this year anyway. The venue can be a bit odd you need to book on weekends but it's also out the front of a super golf place so you get a lot of walk in traffic, bachelor parties and hens nights etc. can be rowdy, less so on week days. Mash sell bottles from the brewery I believe. http://www.mashbrewing.com/  There is a relatively new brewery call Homestead out that way that I haven't been out to yet. It's always getting recommended to me by friend and they have a good name the brewer is also from a succesful Victorian brewery I believe. I've only had their black IPA on tap at the pub it was very good and I find BIPA a bit of a meh style. Apparently they have a really nice venue too it's shared with a winery. https://www.mandoonestate.com.au/homestead/  Swan Valley is home to two German breweries, Elmars and the Duckstein. Both are good, the beers are traditional German style beers. So while not being overly adventurous there are still tasty beers to be had from both. If I had to pick on it would be Elmars, their beer is really nice and there food is amazing if you like German food. Elmars also have a great small good deli section. Duckstein do some bottles but i'm not sure if it's the sort of thing you would want to take home.   http://www.elmars.com.au/  http://www.duckstein.com.au/  Last but not least is Iron Bark Brewery. This place is a whole different kettle of fish. The venue is a little bit different, with its wonky paving and miss matched furniture. Don't let that put you off it's got some great beers and they do a mean wood fired pizza. My friend tells me that the beers are all decoction mashed and that's what gives them their great maltiness. A lot of their beers are fairly low ABV so it's a good one to start at. Their lager beers are top notch I believe some are even based on historical recipes from Perth breweries that are pretty much gone. You'll often find the brewer wandering around and he's pretty happy to have a chat. They also have a couple of ciders which are nice. I really like this place because it has a lot character they are happy doing things their way and it seems to work for them. I believe they also have bottles for sale at the bar. http://ironbarkbrewery.com.au/index.php/beers/  Fremantle  Fremantle is a great place to go on Sunday for a beer, on a day with good weather it's great sitting in the sun and feeling the breeze from the ocean. Fremantle is an older part of Perth and has a lot of history. There are some really good markets, museums and galleries to check out if your into that sort of thing. The Sail and Anchor pub is a great spot right in the heart of Freo you can't miss it. It's got some interesting history. Matilda Bay Brewery where brewing out of there at one time. They too got bought out by Lion Nathan and moved to the east coast. Also one could argue that the American craft beer scene owes something to this brewery / pub, the Americas Cup Yacht race was held in Freo in 1987 at the same time an American called Chris Cramer went into the Sail and Anchor for a beer, while there he got chatting to the guy behind the bar about how much he loved the beer. The guy gave him a tour of the place and showed him how it was all brewed on premises. I think he was pretty impressed, when he got back to America he spoke to his uncle Karl Strauss about opening up a similar venue. The rest is history. They usually have a large range of international and local beers on along with a lot of breweriana on the walls and good food. If your a fan of cask ales this is one of the venues in Perth that usually has a beer on the beer engine. A good place to start or end on a day out to Freo.   They have their own range Sail and Anchor branded beers that are contract brewed by Gage Roads Brewery. They are absolutely horrendous, I'm not one to put a beer down but these beers really annoy me. Some marketing dick is using the pubs good name to push a shoddy product. By all means try them if you want but don't say I didn't warn you. http://www.sailandanchor.com.au/  I'll do this in order of how I like to spend a day in Freo. Next I would go to The Monk brew pub. It's across the road from the Sail. These guys make some amazing beers, they often have a seasonal that will blow you away. I'm not sure if it's in season yet but they do a great coconut stout during winter. They also have probably one of the best IPA's in Perth called the Chief. Must have if your into hoppy beers that is one of their regular line ups. I really like their porter too. Food is really good, a bit pricey and this place can get pretty full. If your their on a Sunday they have a big wok setup out the front to sell paella by the plate which is my fave mid beer session snack. http://www.themonk.com.au/  After eating some paella I like to walk it off by going down to the Norfolk Hotel, it has a nice beer garden and good atmosphere. They usually have a selection of local beers and internationals. http://www.norfolkhotel.com.au/  The last brewery in Freo I've mentioned before is Little Creatures. It has an amazing venue right on the ocean. Little Creatures Pale ale is what made them famous, it was the beer of my youth and always had a great following. It even inspired a few other brewers notably Soren Erikson of 8 Wired in New Zealand. So for them to be sold off to Lion upset a few of us as we knew it would never be the same. Anyway their Pale ale used to be cascade and centennial based but they've recently changed it to a more Galaxy driven beer. Personally I really enjoy the new version, they've also got an IPA which is worth a crack a lot of Galaxy again I believe. The bright ale is a nice beer, and also their Rogers mid strength mild style beer is a good session beer. They also do a small batch run every couple of months that is very hit and miss. Beer and food prices are insultingly expensive, but it has a name and is always packed so they charge what they want. Don't let my bias put you off definitely check it out for yourself. https://littlecreatures.com.au/  The good thing about Freo is all these places are within walking distance. This last place you can walk to but it's a bit of a hike. It's a bottle shop called the Freo Doctor. These guys do growler fills and are one of my favourite bottle shops as they aren't super busy and a lot of rarer beers that get bought up quick elsewhere tend to hang around here. I always like to drop in for a bit of beer hunting. Definitely check them out if your looking for some beers take home. http://thefreodoctor.com/"
CraftBeer,30ppe7,mch,4,Mon Mar 30 13:40:20 2015 UTC,"Down South  The Margaret River region is a beautiful part of our state. It's a tourist and surfing destination a few hours drive south of the City. Long known for it's wineries it has of late been pumping out some beers to rival the wines. As I don't know if you'll make it down south i'll give you a less concise run down. You will need a car for down south as there are breweries spread all over the place sometimes quite a drive.   Relatively new is Eagle Bay brewing, they make some quality beers. They take there name from the picturesque bay near by definitely check that place out if your in the area. http://eaglebaybrewing.com.au/  Bootleg Brewery have a nice venue and do decent beers, there speak easy IPA is a top beer. They've been around for a while and won a few awards so they know what they are doing. http://www.bootlegbrewery.com.au/  Bush Shack Brewery is a personal fave, much like Iron Bark it has that friendly laid back atmosphere. These guys have been here for a long time and their venue is very kid friendly as it has a large play area. The brewer is usually behind the bar and is always happy to have a chat about his beers. If you only have one beer from this place make it the Chocolate Stout it's a beauty, also the Dirty Dans is a good beer too. They do a range of their own soft drinks and ciders. These guys sell bottles. I try to get anyone going down that way to pick me up a mixed carton of the choc stout and dans. http://www.bushshackbrewery.com.au/  Cheeky Monkey Brewery do some interesting beers, I believe they are relatively new or maybe I just hadn't heard of them. Top pick here for me is the Hagenback Belgian IPA it tastes of apples in a good way. They also do a double IPA sometimes too. http://cheekymonkeybrewery.com.au/  Colonial brewery make some solid beers, they have some seasonal that are surprising. They recently just started canning their small ale which is all the rage here in the city. Worth a look nice venue. http://www.colonialbrewingco.com.au/  There are a whole bunch of other breweries down south, these are the ones I've been to so I won't comment on any of the others. I've heard mixed reports about Cowaramup Brewery. Here is a list of what is down south. http://www.waba.org.au/breweries/the-south-west.html  Perth  While not actually in the heart of Perth, the Old Swan Brewery is a Perth icon. It sits on the shore of the river, and has a nice outside area. I have a friend who is an ancestor of the founder and really enjoy the history of this place. The building is a great feat of Architecture for it's time. Swan is now a macro brewing company almost like WA's version of Bud. Also bought out by Lion a long time ago. The Old Brewery a new craft brewery that has been set up inside this old place. Beers are OK if a little uninspired, they did have a nice barley wine though last time I was there. The brewery is part of a larger collection of restaurants. This is an upmarket sort of venue so they will charge you a premium. Definitely worth checking out as it's near the Kings Park Gardens that have a great view of the city. http://www.theoldbrewery.com.au/  As far as the actual city of Perth until very recently there wasn't a whole lot going on, it used to basically shut down at 6pm and on Sundays. Now that Perth is growing rapidly it's starting to get some life so there are a lot of good bars serving good beer. Most notably Bob's bar http://www.printhall.com.au/bobs-bar/. It's in another venue called the Print Hall. This is also the business and shopping district of the city.  Other bars I like in the city are the Mechanics Institute, and The Belgian Beer Cafe (Cantillon and other sours usually available). These are by no means the only bars in the city. Look around and you will find little bars squirreled away all over the city.   Northbridge across the train tracks is is where all the action is, this is the nightlife hub of Perth. Many nightclubs, restaurants and bars to keep you happy. Just be conscious of your surroundings late at night as it can get a little bit seedy with drunks and some criminal element. It's not uncommon to see street fights and our native friends drunk laid out in the park nearby. Police presence is usually pretty strong at night to deter this behavior. Nothing to be scared of if you aren't out to make trouble, just be aware of where you are going.  Others  The Last Drop Brewery has two venues, one in Canning Vale which is a residential / industrial area. The other is out in the Bedfordale which is a lot nicer. These guys make some great quality traditional European beers. Their Saison is one of my favourite beers, but I believe it's only a summer seasonal. http://www.lastdropbrewery.com.au/  While not a brewery Core Cider House  up in Pickering Brook is worth the trip. Hidden up in the most beautiful part of the hills. This one also gets packed so book first. http://www.corecider.com.au/  Also in the hills there are some great pubs of note, the Mundaring Weir Pub is in a scenic national park worth going to just for the drive. The Kalamunda Hotel is alright apparently it's haunted and AC/DC got their start there (citation needed).   List all breweries in WA: http://www.waba.org.au/breweries.html  Swan Valley brewery page and tourist info: http://www.swanvalley.com.au/Attractions_and_Experiences/Breweries  Disclaimer: These are my recommendations I like to think I have a good grasp of whats good in this city but everyone's tastes are different so take them as a guide rather than gospel. Perth people are strange bunch, we are a bit different to the rest of the country. Some people might come off a bit stand offish or rude, but get them talking and they will be your best mate. Breweries tend to be always packed here on the weekends, you can probably get to the bar for a beer or a tasting but if you want to sit down and eat you will need to book. Perth also has some crazy prices for everyday living things. A 6 pack of macro lager will go for $18 - $24 craft will be quite a bit more. Pints are the preferred pour and will go from about $11 for macro in most busy pubs, which I personally believe is daylight robbery. Craft can be crazy expensive, but to offset that we also get a lot of great international stuff. Founders, Six Point, Sierra Nevada, Ballast Point and many others that might surprise you are pretty easy to get.  Best Bottle Shops  All these guys do growler pours 1L & 2L.  International Beer Shop http://www.internationalbeershop.com.au/  Mane Liquor http://www.maneliquor.com.au/  Cellarbrations Carlisle http://www.cellarbrationscarlisle.com.au/  If there is anything that I didn't cover that you think I might be able to help with shoot me a message."

CraftBeer,30o6lk,eeny-meenie-miney-mo,2,Sun Mar 29 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"It's tasty. Very unique with a pleasing green tea flavor that melds well with the beer. IMO a well thought out collab, as opposed to being simply gimmicky and novel. I'd hunt around for a bit of a better price and then go for it."

CraftBeer,30p3ct,Ghaines,10,Sun Mar 29 13:20:43 2015 UTC,"I started liking stouts before I could even handle ipas. Breakfast Stout from Founders, Milk Nitro from Left Hand, Java Stout from Bells. Those are some of my favorites."
CraftBeer,30p3ct,rpdos,5,Sun Mar 29 13:31:30 2015 UTC,Left Hand Brewing's Nitro Milk Stout is what got me into stouts and darker/heavier beers.  But maybe stouts and porters aren't for you. I can't do IPA's at all and I've tried and tried. Oh well.
CraftBeer,30p3ct,nerdgirl2013,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:24:06 2015 UTC,Nitro is amazing
CraftBeer,30p3ct,TryingFarTooHard,3,Mon Mar 30 13:57:17 2015 UTC,"If you don't like it, it's not for you! I have no interest in either, too soft and thick for my pallet. I'm an ale man and that's just fine. No shame in preferences."
CraftBeer,30p3ct,windom_earle,3,Sun Mar 29 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"I used to think I hated stouts because Guinness was the only dark beer I was ever exposed to. Now they are my favorite after IPAs.  Maybe try something a little lighter like a milk stout or porter vs a barrel aged or high abv imperial stout/porter.   Some good ones I like: founders porter, deschutes black butte porter, stone smoked porter, bells java stout, sierra nevada stout, left hand milk stout  If you don't like them I wouldnt sweat it though. Everyone's tastes are different. Personally, I can't stand some styles like barleywine"
CraftBeer,30p3ct,cfsilence,3,Sun Mar 29 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"Same exact story here. Guinness is the worst. I'd start with porter, get something nice and smooth then work up to something like Founders breakfast. It is amazing.   If you can find it great lakes Edmund Fitzgerald is a great porter. Greenman is another good one."
CraftBeer,30p3ct,yocxl,3,Sun Mar 29 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can say is to keep trying them and maybe it'll grow on you. But maybe it's just not your thing. I'm sure we all have styles we don't enjoy.   If you want a few to try, I'd suggest Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, Captain Lawrence Frost Monster (though that may be a winter seasonal), and Southern Tier Creme Brulee if you can find them."
CraftBeer,30p3ct,DogFacedKillah,5,Sun Mar 29 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"Samuel Smiths organic chocolate stout is ""holy shit"" good."
CraftBeer,30p3ct,yocxl,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:49:39 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's one of my favorites.   I'd have suggested it but I think OP mentioned disliking chocolate beers, if I remember right. I could also see it being too sweet for some people.   It's so damn good though."

CraftBeer,30p3ct,DarthMaillard,2,Mon Mar 30 03:39:10 2015 UTC,"There's more or less of a chocolate and coffee taste beer to beer.  You might find some you like, but it's akin to not liking a couple varieties of hops and trying to find some IPAs you like; there's not really a way to tell unless you know someone you can ask (I find strangers describing taste totally unreliable)."
CraftBeer,30p3ct,DaveBHud,2,Sun Mar 29 16:02:59 2015 UTC,Maybe go for some BIPA/CDA/IBA style beers and then go from there.   Also milk stouts are the best ever.
CraftBeer,30p3ct,dd3mon,2,Sun Mar 29 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"For someone who likes IPAs I'd maybe start with some hoppy dark beers that are closer to what you're used to. Three Floyd's Alpha Klaus is an amazing hoppy dark beer (seasonal) that's one of my favorites. There are a number of Black IPAs out right now that are pretty good (http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/black-ipa/114/) - or you could simply make your own by mixing your favorite IPA with a decent quality stout for a black & tan.  The bitterness in a good quality stout is different than an IPA and takes some getting used to. The typical way would be to start with some weaker, but still quality dark beers like Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout or New Belgium's 1554 Black Lager. Some stronger top end stouts that are still very smooth are Stone's Russian Imperial and Oskar Blues Ten Fidy. But since you're already in to IPAs, starting out smooth might not be the issue, so the hoppy dark beers or mixing your own might work out better."
CraftBeer,30p3ct,jaujoet,2,Sun Mar 29 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"It's a difficult thing. I get you; I really wasn't into stouts at all when I started craft beers.  I'm from the Netherlands, so Belgian style beers have always been around for me. Doubles, triples, quads, stuff like that. Love them to bits! The porters and stouts were a different beer world, and one that I found difficult to enter.  It slowly grew on me though. I had many stouts that I disliked. But then came some stouts from my local craft brewery (Oersoep), who made some weird and good stuff. And then I discovered the Russian Imperial Stout! The way IPA's have fruityness and bitterness exploding from the glass, the same way RIS has maltyness, roasted and coffee/chocolate flavors exploding from it. I really love that stuff.  I'm not saying you should go and buy some RIS because you might pay a lot for something you'll dislike. But just keep trying the occasional stout, and it wil grow on you. Or not, and stick to the stuff you like."
CraftBeer,30p3ct,nerdgirl2013,2,Sun Mar 29 18:36:59 2015 UTC,Best porter i have had is ballast point i think it's called victory at sea. I know they have other porters but i haven't tried them. Evil twin lil b is another good porter. When it comes to stouts i find it's hit or miss. You could go to tastings in your area or ask to try samples at bars or just take the risk and try a bottle.
CraftBeer,30p3ct,iowabeans,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:56:37 2015 UTC,"I believe it's an acquired taste that you'll eventually ween yourself on to once you're ready.  For a couple years I was hooked on IPAs and then I started finding a stout I like here and there and became more exposed to flavors and notes.  If you can find a bottle shop with an educated drinker start talking with them, ask questions.  Expose yourself.  Buffalo sweat is an okay start, I liked it not knowing what it was.  Guinness is still a no to me.  Still not really in to porters but I can find one here and there I can enjoy."

If you believe that the hop aroma just disappears into thin air the moment you pour it into a glass, then that's what you're going to experience. But Heady is a potent IPA. There are a lot of potent IPA's, none of which advise drinking straight from the can and maintain a pleasant hop aroma throughout the drinking experience. If I'm not mistaken, that's also one of the purposes of IPA glasses."

Some suggestions of things you might enjoy that they would likely have in stock:   Maine Beer Co. - Mo, Lunch, Red Wheelbarrow Sixpoint - Resin or Hi-Res Stone - any of their IPAs are great, really.

Most egregiously, there is only one entry from the entire pacific NW, and they even spelled it wrong (""DeSchutes""). I'm not interested in starting a debate about the best regions for craft beer, but it is pretty universally agreed that the PNW has been one of the prime hotbeds of the craft beer world since it's very origins, and it hasn't exactly fallen behind. Still, there is not a single entry from two of the country's prime craft beer cities in Seattle and Portland?    I also understand that beer availability is highly regional, and being USA Today the probability that the author is from somewhere on the eastern seaboard is about 99% and they probably don't have easy access to the best of the PNW, but this just silly.   Their regional breakdown is just bad overall, some really small players like Starr Hill and DC Brau make the bracket?  It seems like they really had to stretch to find entries for the eastern section, but the west bracket is over-crowded (5 CA, 2 CO, and 1 OR) and they lump Colorado in there when they should probably be in the midwest anyway, leaving the west spots for CA, WA, and OR considering that 1/3 of all breweries in the USA are in WA, OR, CA, and CO..   Well, that turned into a longer rant than it should have, and I should probably be glad that the PNW is being overlooked anyway: more for me!  I don't need our best beers becoming more scarce anyway, I'm happy I can walk down to the corner store and get stuff like Kentucky Dark Star and this at my leisure without worrying about crowds and lines."
CraftBeer,30d9yh,iBrave,2,Thu Mar 26 19:53:16 2015 UTC,"There have been a bunch of these happening recently from various sources; all of them arguably have odd selections of breweries, and a brewery's results seem to pretty much come down to whether or not they cared enough to promote that silly bracket on social media.

I'm really confused - does this actually taste good? The IBUs would be off the charts, completely beyond any desirable style of beer. The bitterness would be close to caustic!"

CraftBeer,30emzi,Thejanitor86,2,Thu Mar 26 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"picture of the label in question: http://i.imgur.com/kr4vdjI.jpg   Atlanta's SweetWater Brewing Co. began distributing beer in Chicago this week, but its most notable beer at the moment might be the one that's missing.  The Binny's Beverage Depot in Lincoln Park has declined to stock SweetWater's Happy Ending imperial stout due to what the store's beer manager called the ""sexist, borderline racist"" artwork on the bottle.  Happy Ending (a reference to male sexual climax, presumably after a massage) features images on its bottle that include a box of tissues, the face of a man achieving what looks to be the pinnacle of pleasure and the silhouette of a geisha. It all added up to a bit more than the store's beer manager, Adam Vavrick, was comfortable putting on shelves.  ""This label is about a female Asian sex worker manually masturbating a man to orgasm and cleaning up the ejaculate with tissues,"" Vavrick said. ""Why is that appropriate on a beer label?""  It's a question that has been increasingly asked in the rapidly growing craft beer industry. Responding to various labels construed as sexist — usually showing women in various states of undress or in suggestive poses — Time Out Chicago published a piece last year beneath the headline, ""Time to grow up, breweries."" Chicago-based blog Guys Drinking Beer asked, ""Why does craft beer suddenly seem to have a problem with women?"" And the founder of Twin Cities beer shop The Four Firkins published a blog post in February called, ""Let's talk about sexist beer labels.""  Though mostly just chatter until now, Vavrick sending back three cases of Happy Ending — 36 large-format (22-ounce) bottles — is among the rare instances of a Chicago store declining to carry a beer due only to its label. According to SweetWater's Chicago distributor, Lakeshore Beverage, no other store, in the Binny's chain or otherwise, refused to stock the beer.  Vavrick said he became aware of the label when SweetWater beer arrived in Chicago this week, and a ""visibly upset"" male employee brought it to his attention. Vavrick said he polled three more Binny's staff to gauge their feelings.  ""They all felt the same way — it's gross and it has no place in here,"" Vavrick said. ""A female employee said she wouldn't be comfortable recommending that beer to anyone.""  Vavrick announced his decision this week on social media: ""Breweries: One thing I simply do not tolerate in my department is sexist or racist beer labels. I demand better and will not carry them,"" he wrote on Twitter. (With more than 100 ""favorites,"" Vavrick said, the tweet was his most popular ever.)  Lakeshore Beverage picked up the three cases of Happy Ending the next day. Vavrick said he never considered blackballing the brewery entirely; at least four other SweetWater beers, including its popular 420 Extra Pale Ale, are on the shelves.  In an interview this week, SweetWater founder Freddy Bensch said he has never heard a complaint about the artwork on the 8-year-old beer that until now has been available in mostly Southern states. It was simply intended as a joke, he said.  ""No harm was intended,"" Bensch said. ""We maybe didn't think this all the way through.""  He said the brewery would take corrective action regarding the Happy Ending bottle, though he didn't specify what that might be.  ""We're going to be thoughtful about it and make it right,"" Bensch said.  For Vavrick, and others who have claimed offense, the blowback was exacerbated by two factors: The text on the bottle describes the beer as ""sporting a huge dry hopped stiffy resulting in an explosive finish!""  And the other was a promotional video uploaded to the Internet two years ago by the brewery that shows a man standing behind a bar taking a sip of Happy Ending, then staring into the distance and exclaiming, ""Oh, god, that's good!"" A woman dressed as a geisha then rises from behind the bar, fans her face, offers a suggestive look, then descends back below the bar. Bensch, who said he was unaware of the video until this week, said he had it taken down.  Jason Alvey, founder of The Four Firkins, which has sold craft beer in the Twin Cities metro area for seven years, said he has declined to carry ""about five"" beers during the last seven years due to ""objectification of women or crass, lowbrow sexual innuendo humor."" One of the offending breweries, he said, he refuses to carry at all because it showed no contrition when he raised the issue. He declined to name that brewery.  Alvey said he doesn't object to a ""respectful portrayal of a pretty woman"" on a beer label, but acknowledged that one person's respectful can be too far for someone else.  ""It can be a difficult topic,"" Alvey said. ""We're trying not to get carried away with this and we're trying to be realistic. The ones we've said we're not going to carry are generally blatantly obvious.""  The issue of sexist beer labels has only become more pronounced as more breweries open, Alvey said. Since 2012, more than 1,000 craft breweries have opened in the U.S., bringing the national total to 3,418, according to the Brewers Association, a craft beer industry group.  ""We're getting more little breweries that don't have any training or professional experience in marketing, and they think this kind of thing will get them attention or is funny,"" Alvey said. ""A lot of new breweries forget their customer base isn't just young males.""  When a questionable label pops up, he said, he'll discuss it with his staff of 16, and put the matter to a vote. SweetWater is not distributed in Minnesota, but Alvey said he wouldn't carry Happy Ending.  ""It's juvenile frat boy humor,"" he said. ""If I see something damaging to the industry as a whole and insulting to women, I'm not going to carry it.""  The Chicago area saw a similar blowup last year when Rockford-based Pig Minds Brewing Co. released a beer called PD California Blueberry Ale — the ""PD"" standing for ""panty dropper"" — featuring a label that showed a pair of female legs jutting from a short skirt and underwear hitched down to just above the ankles. Beer bloggers and social media took Pig Minds to task, accusing the brewery of promoting anything from sexism to date rape.  When the summer-seasonal beer returns, it will be rebranded as ""Happi Daze California Blueberry Ale,"" and with a new label featuring smiley faces, said Pig Minds' general manager and brewmaster, Carson Souza.  Like SweetWater, Souza swore there was no intention to offend with PD California Ale. The beer had been on draft at Pig Minds' brew pub for two years — with the same artwork on the tap handle that appeared on the bottle — with no complaints. The owner of the brewery, Brian Endl, drew the artwork, which was sold as an aluminum placard that became popular with both male and female customers.  ""We never had one person sit there and say 'That's terrible, you should take that down,'"" Souza said. ""Quite the contrary — they said, 'How much is that placard? That's cool.'""  But he acknowledged that as breweries grow and reach wider audiences, the ability to offend increases. And in the era of social media, it can take mere hours for a beer label that barely raised an eyebrow for two years in a Rockford brewpub to incur the wrath of the Internet. The Guys Drinking Beer website, which publishes the Chicago-area beer labels approved each month by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, called PD's art ""the worst beer label ever produced"" after it was approved last August. The Internet quickly agreed, and the ""PD"" label became a hotly discussed issue on Reddit within days.  Souza said the label was part light-hearted joke, part homage to beer history (think of the standard Oktoberfest dress, he said) and nod to a certain reality.  ""Let's face it, when people drink, they get laid — that's both men and women,"" he said. ""It was just a joke. It takes a twisted mind to say that (the label) has something to do with rape.""  Though Souza said he was conflicted about changing the label, ""the best business decision was to let PD subside.""  ""We are not misogynistic and we are not sexist by any means,"" he said. ""We're husbands, we have daughters and we are artists. But it was time to say goodbye to it. We offended too many people, and we don't want to do that.""  Claudia Jendron, brewmaster at Evanston's Temperance Beer Co., and one of the relatively few female brewmasters in the U.S., said that in her experience, the industry has no trouble accepting women. At beer festivals and public events, Jendron said, she feels just as respected as any male brewer.  ""But this doesn't help,"" she said. ""It puts women in a position that we have to fight a little bit harder to get back to the same level (as men).""  Marie Cummins, who blogs about beer and is a moderator for the Chicago Craft Beer Enthusiasts Facebook page, said craft beer is clearly becoming inclusive of women. Overwhelmingly male just five years ago, beer festival crowds have become about 40 percent female, she said. And while she takes offense at the Happy Ending bottle because ""it's so apparent that they're saying this beer is really for a certain segment of the population that's not me,"" she doesn't want to see the judgment of beer labels become too weighty.  ""When you go over the line, as some of them have, it becomes obvious,"" she said. ""But you can't get offended at every little thing. The moment you become too politically correct, you take some of the passion out of it.""  jbnoel@tribune.com"

CraftBeer,309vxe,hardkoretom,4,Wed Mar 25 20:37:19 2015 UTC,I don't have an elaborate story. I drank Coors Light/Bud Light while in college and never really thought about craft beer. It was only after college did craft beer star becoming more popular. So I ordered a Three Floods gumballhead at Dicks Last Resort. Drank four more sitting on the patio overlooking Chicago. I've been into craft beer ever since.
CraftBeer,309vxe,QuincyStandback,5,Wed Mar 25 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"I just like variety. I would've been fine drinking Bud Light's if I could get a pick-6 of 6 different flavored ones. So I started doing pick 6's at the grocery store, which evolved into going across town to the nicer beer store, to visiting breweries on all trips I go on, to bringing back beers from vacations, to driving 2 hours for beer releases, to trading, to.. damn Bud Light would've been cheaper."
CraftBeer,309vxe,ecp30,4,Wed Mar 25 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"Mostly drank Budlight Lime and Modelo Negra on special occasions. But when I first started dating my girl friend she told me her favorite beer was Guinness. I wanted to impress her when she came over with some stouts she'd never had in the fridge. So I went to the local liquor shop and asked the guy to suggest some. It wasn't stout season so they had a small selection. I bought three. I don't recall the other two, but Old Rasputin changed the way I thought about beer. (Also a bottle of Brother Thelonious she brought over from Costco early in our dating blew my mind a little). Needless to say I have quite a fondness for all things North Coast Brewing. And a rather (un)healthy barrel aged obsession."

CraftBeer,309vxe,FORNICOCKALYPSE,3,Wed Mar 25 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"I got into craft beer because someone told me to try something other than Bud Light or Killian's or whatever I was drinking at the time. I tried a few things and found them to be OK. Tried a St. Bernardus Abt 12 or Trappistes Rochefort 10 (I can't remember which anymore) and had my eyes opened up. Since then, I've just been trying to taste as many amazing beers as possible, with mixed results.  Don't be afraid of trying something new. I've ordered things at bars literally because I had never heard of the beer before. You might taste something amazing or something awful or something in between, but you'll learn more about your tastes and what's out there in the process."
CraftBeer,309vxe,jbramley,3,Wed Mar 25 17:46:06 2015 UTC,"I never really enjoyed the taste of the big domestic beers. Then a friend decided to start brewing his own but wanted some ideas about what beer tastes like, other than the aforementioned beers. So, we picked up a few random singles from a local craft beer place and never looked back. Now, whenever I go out to a bar, restaurant, or grocers and don't recognize something I'll get it. My favorite way to try new things is to go on a brewery tour if at all possible, you'll get to sample a good portion of their offerings and occasionally limited runs and one offs!"

I hadn't drank anything other than the typical macro beer with the exception of Guinness (didn't like it then and still think it's crap now). It opened my eyes and now almost a decade later I'm full into every type of style there is. Start with pale ales, ambers, and brown ale then work your way into IPA and stouts."
CraftBeer,309vxe,Mrbuckeye,3,Wed Mar 25 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"At first I thought I didn't like beer. Turns out I didn't like beer flavored water.

CraftBeer,309vxe,Vaklempt,3,Wed Mar 25 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"I stayed with stuff like Guinness, then I wanted more. Started drinking Blue Moon, and a bunch of stuff from Trader Joe's. Then a friend handed me a bottle of Bear Republic's Hoprod rye IPA. This is the reason why i still like stuff like Killian's and Blue Moon. They're what got me into craft beers.   As for living in SoCal, you've got access to a great selection of beers. If you are in San Diego, I'll recommend checking out O'Brian's, the Torronado, Blind Lady, Hamilton's, or any of the great tasting rooms around."

Talking about the different flavors, brewing process, what makes this beer different from that beer.  It introduced this whole new world of beer where I could drink a different beer, each week, for most likely the rest of my life.  Each time I got a different beverage it was like going on a small adventure.  Even if it was something I didn't particularly like, it was still new and refreshing."

Then I went to Killian's, and I could see there was something added, but it still left something to be desired. From there I started trying the ""darker"" stuff, Guinness and Shiner Bock were what I remember. It continued to evolve until I started picking up the Micro-brews that were popping up at the liqour stores (Bell's, Founders, Short's and the like).   The first ""wow"" beer that really made me fall in love with craft beer was Bell's Two Hearted. It was the first beer that I consistently started buying instead of the Macro stuff. That beer sent me down a hop-crazed path of finding the most ridiculously hoppy beers I could get my hands on.   Now, a few years later, I no longer crave the hoppy beers like I used to. I'm totally on a malt-kick, and I find myself constantly searching for the next imperial stout, old ale, or barleywine.   And to top it all off, once I really started diving into craft beer I grew the intense desire to make my own. That passion led me to pick up a second-job outside of my day job working for a local meadery and I love it. It's weird to think that I might never have gone down this path if it wasn't for a Killian's, or a Two Hearted, ya know?"
CraftBeer,309vxe,Sewercap999,2,Wed Mar 25 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"One day while buying my usual Coors or PBR, I saw a bottle of Stone Arrogant Bastard on the shelf.  Curious, I picked it up and began reading it.  It was cocky and cool.  I bought it in addition to the Coors, just to try it out.  I didn't much care for the first sip, as it was so much stronger than what I was used to.  About half way through I was raving about how good it was, and wishing I had bought more than just one.   I still love Stone, but now my ""go to"" brand is Southern Tier."

CraftBeer,309vxe,kswartz,2,Thu Mar 26 13:36:16 2015 UTC,For my boyfriend's birthday I wanted to get him beers that aren't distributed in Florida from as many states as possible. I started stalking /r/beertrade and /r/beerporn to figure out what I wanted to try then traded a butt load of jai alai across the country. Took us at least two years to drink through that collection but the beer trading habit never really died down.

A little over a year ago I went on a roadtrip to Belgium with two friends. We went to a lot of breweries. One day we did sours, other days we did trappists, including Westvleteren.  When we came back, I started to buy more of the non-pilsner beers, just to check them all out. And I guess I still do that today. I've started homebrewing and I've gone back to Westvleteren a month ago to pick up some more.  It's awesome to see how craft beer is booming. Especially in the states. Slowly the larger American breweries are selling their stuff in my little swampy country, which is a good thing."

CraftBeer,309vxe,Mburton90,2,Thu Mar 26 00:18:26 2015 UTC,I have been into craft beer my whole life. My dad has liked craft beer since before I was born. There is a picture of me (as a baby) with my arm in my dad's beer. As a kid growing up he let me try all the beer he was drinking. He was one of the first patrons of Eli Cannon's (shameless plug for /r/ctbeer).
CraftBeer,309vxe,deebuggin,2,Thu Mar 26 00:56:21 2015 UTC,"I got into craft beer because my husband got into it first. He loves IPA, and tried to get me into it. I can drink the session IPAs, but not the super hoppy stuff.   I do however enjoy sour, Belgian, berliner Weiss, and saison styles.  You like Stone, so I'm guessing IPA is your thing. You live in South Bay, and we have awesome beers in South Bay. Check out /r/LAbeer if you have not.   Try visiting the breweries instead of getting beers from bottle shops. Nothing wrong with bottle shops, but you'll get better access to seasonal and rare stuff from the breweries.  You can also try more beers in one sitting because they usually have sampler flights. You can start with El Segundo brewery. They are known for their IPAs, and I'm pretty sure they have sampler flights. Other than IPAs, they have some good stouts too. We have three Weavers in Inglewood, Smog city and monkish in Torrance, and if you're feeling adventurous, Phantom carriage has sour beers in Carson. Don't be afraid to ask questions at the taprooms. These guys are very informative and passionate about their beers.   Enjoy exploring beer in our awesome South bay cities!"

Once I moved out (I was 23), I felt the glorious freedom of having my own place - that included not having to answer to anyone but myself.  So, a 12 pack of Henry Weinhards was my first purchase.  Having that first sip was bliss.  Within 1 year, I had grown tired of the mass produced beers - bitter without anything special.  I found a massive Stone Brewing Double Bastard Ale bottle that was 3 liters!  Simply because I had never seen a bottle of beer that large (and because it had a Gargoyle on it), I bought it.  Oh...  that changed everything. :)  Never again would macro-brewed beer touch my lips.  That was 13 years ago and I've held true to that mantra."

If you venture in that directions, you must check out Green Flash, Stone, Alpine, Lost Abbey, Ballast Point).  LA area top breweries include El Segundo, Strand, Monkish, Phantom Carriage and Eagle Rock Brewery. I would grab lunch at Golden Road just for the ambiance, but the beer leaves a lot to be desired. There are a few exceptional ones down south in Orange County (Noble & Bruery) that are definitely worth the short drive down.  If you are driving north, you can hit some breweries on your way. Santa Barbara = Telegraph/ Buelton = Barrellwork & Figueroa Mountain / Paso Robles = Firestone & Barrelhouse.  I'm not to versed on the SF/Napa breweries yet, I plan on going soon. But based on the bottles i've had, you should make your way to Rare Barrel, Russian River, Lagunitas, Anchor & Cellarmaker.  I hope this helps."

CraftBeer,305k9l,phiLLy820,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:35:34 2015 UTC,I don't think they distribute their spirits yet. Last time I was at the brewery that was what I was told. That was a year ago. Best bet is to go to their website and shoot them a quick email. I am sure someone will answer your question. Cheers!

CraftBeer,3054bp,jasonumd,2,Tue Mar 24 18:41:08 2015 UTC,Curious what you think of Crossbones. I found it to be a rather weak session IPA (Pinner being my favoriate at the moment). I'm excited to try Heavy Seas' Double Cannon though!
CraftBeer,3054bp,yammerant,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:56:49 2015 UTC,"Crossbones was decent, but nothing special. Haven't tried the Double Cannon, but Loose Cannon is excellent so I'd be excited too!"

CraftBeer,3054bp,sbrundage81,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:02:40 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the habanero sculpin yet? If so, what did you think? My guy and I tried it a while back and thought it was well made but seriously spicy (this from people not accustomed to spicy things). I think we expected a zing as is the case with most spiced beers and were surprised by the wallop of hotness. I can't decide if the serious spice was a good thing, or if it  detracted and overpowered all the other flavors present. That being said, it could just be my weenie palate."

CraftBeer,307ol9,Grizzly_Adamz,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:32:44 2015 UTC,I've never had it but the Ballast Point Indra Kinundra is a curry flavored stout. No idea if I spelled that right by the way haha
CraftBeer,307ol9,theures,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:49:20 2015 UTC,I think Jester King's Snörkel is probably the weirdest beer I've had that I can remember. I really liked My Blueberry Nightmare.

Carton was unique because based on color, you get flavors you just wouldn't suspect. Regular coffee was unique because the aroma just didn't match the flavor. Both are awesome by the way."
CraftBeer,307ol9,DownrightBrewed,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"I loved Regular Coffee when I tried it out of the can. Later that night I saw one that had been poured in a glass, and didn't even recognize it. You wouldn't expect that color, but you also wouldn't expect a 12% cream ale."

CraftBeer,307ol9,SeeScottRock,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:51:29 2015 UTC,Rogue Sriracha Hot Stout was really weird. I didn't like it as it really didn't have much flavor in my opinion and just kind of burned.  I had a smoked beer at the Great American Beer Fest in 2013 (I think it might have been Alaskan Smoked Porter not sure though). But it was basically like drinking ashes if I recall correctly (which is difficult after a beer fest)  Dry Dock Brewery recently released a beer called Heather Flower Ale or something like that which was made with flowers and basically tasted like eating a plant.  Twisted Pine Brewery makes a beer called Billiy's Chillies which I consider weird although I've seen a lot more chile beers recently. It wasn't awful but I wouldn't want more than 1 pint.
CraftBeer,307ol9,fungoid_sorceror,1 point,Thu Mar 26 06:11:41 2015 UTC,"I guess mine is pretty mild but Aecht Schlenkerla's Marzen tastes like bacon, which was interesting. My mind was tricking me into thinking it was salty, and that's a weird experience."

CraftBeer,306aia,Hou_mcbp,4,Tue Mar 24 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"Have to check out modern times. They have two locations. A brewery and a tap room. To get the most out of you time I would go to Northpark that has about 10 different Tap rooms including blenching beaver, mike Hess, modern times, thorn brewing, fall brewing, rip current, and a few more. They also have two of the best beer bars in San Diego, Toronado and Tiger Tiger!   I would also recommend OB noodle house in ocean beach that has great beer and food. If you want to hit as much breweries as possible I would check out the miramar area. It has big name breweries like green flash, alesmith, and ballast point. I hope that was helpful"

But I don't think tasting bitterness in a beer that is continuously hopped for two hours the day it's picked up from the brewery is some outlandish observation. I think most people taste it after aging it, which mellows out the IBUs and brings out the sweetness. Is this subreddit run by dogfish head or something?"

The Pizza Joint on Broad Street in downtown Augusta has great food and a decent beer selection.  If Terrapin, out of Athens, GA doesnt distribute where you live definitely grab some of what they have to offer while you're in town. Anything from Monday Night Brewing out of Atlanta should be around too. Thomas Creek out of Greenville, SC is a personal favorite and you should be able to find anything from them while you're around the Aiken/North Augusta area. There's a place on Bobby Jones in Augusta called Beverage Discount (or something like that) very generic name but they've got a great craft beer section."

If you're going through Indiana, stop by Three Floyds. They have some of the best IPA's and Pale Ales in the Midwest.   If you drive through Chicago, check out Half Acre.

He says as he files for a trademark of his own to keep others from using the moose.  As much as I dislike seeing the big boys bully the little guys, there is a lot that could be done here. Reverse the direction of his moose head or include more than just the head for example. How much research has he done to make the claim that there is no confusion in the marketplace? And when talking about how his product predates their company - was it in distribution then or was it a recipe he was kicking around now and then? If the former he may have a case. IG the latter, not so much. Root beer has the word right there in the title. It wouldn't be that much of a stretch for somebody to see it without reading the whole label and assume their favorite lager changed their logo a little.  Corporate bullying is real. But that doesn't mean every situation involving a big and a small brewery is unfounded."

There are so many other beers on the market that, unless I'm craving something familiar to me, I will almost always choose something I've never had before.

That being said Goose Island does not make the best beers for everything. I do enjoy their entire BCBS lineup and love 2 of their sour ales. But man, their ""everyday"" beers are meh for my money. And please don't ever buy ""muddy"" that is the worst ""stout"" ever.  And before the idiocracy rolls in. I am not happy AB-Inbev is buying people."

I just refuse to give my money to AB-Inbev. Like I said in my OP, I don't like supporting a company that is trying to hinder the craft beer scene. I live in Florida where it's illegal to buy 64oz growlers due to an antiquated law that has only stayed in place becasue big beer companies like AB-Inbev use their wallets to keep them there. They're also trying to hinder tap rooms and stop more from opening up. They're literally trying to stop breweries from opening up, they're trying to put a stop to job growth and hold back the economic boom that is craft beer. All so they can keep their large market share. I refuse to give my money to someone that's doing that and I wish others would too. Unfortunately as long as the Bourbon County series is around I don't see that happening."

I know my answer would be yes.  I do feel for the shifty as frakk practices such as the growler law and the attempt to move legislation to make it harder to open new places in attempts to hinder competition. But hey, if it's legal, which it is (Put dirty as a port-o-Jon at a festival) I have to say good job to them.   This just rabbit holes down out side of the topic point though of an ethics debate. So I'll just say:  I am not stopping buying beer I love just because they get bought out. I am not going to be happy, and I don't get excited when I hear about them making new beer for sure."

When it comes to actually supporting them, I don't think about it too much. If I had a chance to buy a bourbon county I probably would just because its notoriously good and hard to find. I value the taste of beer over the brand. That's my 2 cents."

They struggle with contamination, and while they don't always throw those batches out, you can taste the difference and can tell when some ""extra"" bacteria have gotten in."

CraftBeer,2zpjwk,night_owl,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"I think scarcity made it very desired and sought after. Now that you can get it in a lot of bars around here it doesn't seem so interesting. Double Mountain's Vaporizer is a better ""fruity / hoppy / juicy"" IPA IMO."
CraftBeer,2zpjwk,warm_sweater,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"hmmm, I like Double Mountain a lot, but can't agree with that. I've had Vaporizer a few times and it never really impressed me much. Nothing wrong with it, but just fairly ordinary IMHO.  I think you can find a better IPA just across the other side of the river at Backwoods Brewing with their Log Yard IPA.   You are absolutely right about scarcity (and the hype built in), but I'd still take a Pliny over either one, assuming the price was reasonable. That said, there are probably a dozen IPAs from WA and OR that I put almost on level terms, but none that I can honestly say I thought were measurably better."
CraftBeer,2zpjwk,night_owl,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:48:36 2015 UTC,It's better than Pliny. More balanced and has that east coast bitterness I love.
CraftBeer,2zpjwk,Hllblzr310,7,Fri Mar 20 21:01:02 2015 UTC,"The one thing I'll say is my friend who just went out there for the pliny the younger tapping and came home with a bunch of bottles said that pliny changes character by the week - so a bottle that was brewed a month ago tastes much different than one that was bottled one or two weeks ago. That being said, hype is hype. He still enjoyed it and that's all that matters."
CraftBeer,2zpjwk,talljew,3,Fri Mar 20 16:58:12 2015 UTC,"I've actually had Pliny at Russian River, and also had it shipped cross country to me. I can say for sure it tasted different each time.

CraftBeer,2zpjwk,NickPro,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:27:38 2015 UTC,Took the words right out of my mouth.  I'd love to see what the author thinks of week-old Pliny.  Having said that I do agree with a lot of his points about other beers getting better as of late.
CraftBeer,2zpjwk,night_owl,2,Fri Mar 20 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"Still haven't had any IPA that had a bigger first impression on me. I remember trying it for the first time something like 7 years ago and immediately thinking, ""out of the hundreds I've had over the years, this is the best IPA I've ever tasted and it isn't even close""  But I haven't had a Pliny in a few years now, they pulled out of the Washington market in order to keep more for the cali locals.   I'd really like to have a blind taste test to compare it to some newer popular IPA/DIPAs and see how it stacks up. Many of the really hyped ones just don't do much for me (especially the hyped stuff coming out of San Diego by guys like Stone and Ballast Point) and I think I just don't dig the general direction that so many of the really popular ones are going toward (particularly the really bitter white grapefruit or resinous piney flavors that are all the rage)"
CraftBeer,2zpjwk,Thejanitor86,2,Sat Mar 21 01:07:18 2015 UTC,"I really liked the grapefruit sculpin ipa I recently tried. It's so god damn refreshing, but I would love to do a blind taste test myself just to see the results."

CraftBeer,2zncyb,JeamBim,3,Fri Mar 20 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"I have to say I actually fall somewhere in between: I agree that the ""six step pour"" and the 119.5 second wait time are all a bunch of theater and hokum, but not all pours are equal.  I've seen places with high-pressure taps that pour in less than 10 seconds and it tastes just fine but the head is thick and it dissipates quickly, leaving you shorted an ounce or so. I've been to many Irish pubs where they are meticulous about using the proscribed process and it comes out tasting just the same, but the head holds a little better and it will just sit there on top of your pint like a cap. You'll also get a little bit more since there is actually less foamy headspace when it is served, and it can be deceptive how much fluid is held in the widest part of the glass at the mouth.   I think you truly get a better pour and better head if you pour a little slowly and let it rest a little before topping it off--two minutes is overkill but even 10-20 seconds does make a difference. It is worth noting, however, that this advice holds true for just about any beer, including all other beers served on nitro, as well any beer that pours with significant head.     Again, I want to emphasize that none of this actually changes the taste of your first sip, but it does slightly change the character of the pint and the mouthfeel, especially as you get further down and you still have a creamy head remaining instead of just a ""thin"" stout."

CraftBeer,2zimz4,tsokley,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:46:29 2015 UTC,I live in a state that doesn't carry heady topper. I'm so happy anytime someone opens one.
CraftBeer,2zimz4,Badwolf2013,2,Thu Mar 19 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not much of an IPA guy.  I've had some of the great IPAs (like Hopslam and Heady Topper) and thought they were good, but weren't that much better than everything else. I do love stouts, and the great stouts like Cigar City Hunahpu and Portsmouth Brewery Kate the Great are worth it in my opinion.  Stood in snow for over 6 hours to get Kate the Great and I'd do it again. If you're on a budget, though, they're probably not worth their outrageous prices."
CraftBeer,2zimz4,guytyping,2,Wed Mar 18 23:37:16 2015 UTC,The unicorn hunt can be part of the fun.  But I'm sure it frustrates some as well.
CraftBeer,2zimz4,ifeelhome,2,Thu Mar 19 01:05:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't even usually drink the unicorns when I do get them. I just enjoy finding them. Of course I drink the IPA's, but I'm collecting imperial stouts faster than I can drink them."
CraftBeer,2zimz4,cornonthekrobb,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:45:01 2015 UTC,Pliny is REALLY good. Westy 12 too. Abyss. Zombie Dust. Etc.   Fortunately there are more readily available beers that are just as good. I'm always let down when I try something with a lot of hype. I'd rather be blown away by something I've never heard of so I don't have unrealistic expectations walking in.
CraftBeer,2zimz4,ifeelhome,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:04:57 2015 UTC,Pliny the elder is one of my favorites. Had the Younger in CO and it actually didn't impress me like the elder did.   Duchesse is also a unicorn beer where I'm from (although several places have it on tap) and it definitely lives up to the standards.
CraftBeer,2zimz4,cornonthekrobb,2,Thu Mar 19 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with your Pliny assessment. The Elder is very good and I feel very fortunate being able to get it frequently in the Bay Area. My novice friends who don't stray past Lagunitas and Sierra Nevada even notice how good it is almost instantly. The Younger is also very good and I would say it's better, but not so much moreso that it deserves the hype it gets. I'm sure most of that hype is due to the limited supply. I'm glad I've had it but certainly won't be standing in line again to chase it down. I think Russian River's Blind Pig IPA is also really good and flies under the radar a bit due to Pliny.  I've also had some bourbon county stouts which I loved and make me want to find some KBS."
CraftBeer,2zimz4,jesscrochetsstuff,2,Thu Mar 19 17:55:15 2015 UTC,"Great assessment. Being in CO we get a limited supply from distributors of PTY. I paid $16 for a ticket and it included 9 oz pours of blind pig, elder then younger. RRB has a big connection with breast cancer charities so this bar auctioned off rest of the keg after everyone got a beer. Highest was $100 for extra 9 oz pour (not me). Tap went for $400."
CraftBeer,2zimz4,ifeelhome,3,Thu Mar 19 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"Wow! Crazy prices, but a good cause. Didn't have it this last Younger season but a year ago, the places I saw around San Jose had tickets from $6-10 and ranged from 6 oz to a pint. I really lucked out and found it for $8 a pint, limit 2 per."
CraftBeer,2zimz4,jesscrochetsstuff,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:20:38 2015 UTC,"Duchesse - that sour, right? I saw bottles of it out here and had it on tap not too long ago (Long Beach, CA)."

CraftBeer,2zimz4,Khraine,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"See, I didn't like it as much. BUT I did have a stout or something beforehand. It could have affected my palate. I actually love sours. I was shocked when I didn't like this one."
CraftBeer,2zimz4,steve032,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:53:55 2015 UTC,"I went to college in Burlington, VT and was able to get Heady pretty easily as long as I had the money. Now that I'm living in MA I find myself wanting it but then realizing it might just be what your post is about. Living near Boston gives me a whole lot of options for just of good, if not better beers. I frequent /r/sneakers and I have always noticed that these two subs are very similar in terms of what people like. When something is harder to get, people want it more. Whether it's a new pair of Jordans or some Heady or Pliny, people want what is hard for them to get."
CraftBeer,2zimz4,Khraine,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"Unicorn is a pretty thrown around name for a beer at a certain time. That being said I have had several rare beers that are talked up.  Here is that list and my notes:  Dark Lord (BA and non-BA): If you go to the release party OR get it from a friend not reselling it for 50 bucks a bottle. It's absolutely amazing and my favorite beer.  BCBS: At the cusp (in IL) of being garbage. The beer itself is great and I love it. But now there are 4 hour waits for a beer store to open just at the random change to get some. Price for beer is fair until you get to a reseller at this point. Which charge 50 bucks for a something that was 20.  Darkness: Same as Dark Lord. Though IL has been getting some each year and that's where my luck in this started. Amazing beer and great price. Resellers ruining.   Bomb!: Not quite the ""unicorn"" level. But just not as good as hype online made it to be. Abraxxxas is better IMHO.  BA Biscotti Break: It's like dark chocolate in a glass. I love it and wish i could find more.  There a bunch more of the Rares kicking around in my list but my brain is out. if you have Untappd at me (Khraine there as well) I do my best to Drink a beer and Note about it. I am not really on there to high five people and chat. It's more just my personal adventure thru craft beer."
CraftBeer,2zimz4,steve032,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"I would never compare Bomb and Abraxxas. Bomb is brewed year round and has huge distro. Abraxxas is pretty much case limit to every account perennial ships to, and will be gone in days if not minutes. Both are phenomenal but Abraxxas is a lot more rare (and is still not ""unicorn"" status, I would reserve that term for brewery only release stuff like BA Abraxxas, DB Huna, and some of the Hill Farmstead and SARA stuff.)"

CraftBeer,2zg26u,hughthewineguy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"bottles (or even whole batches of beer) can be infected by yeasts or bacteria which the brewer did not intend to have present. their activity results in excessive carbonation, and alteration of aromatic and mouthfeel aspects of the beer. the two more common ones are lactobacillus which gets intensely, intensely sour, and brettanomyces, which causes a sensation of thinness and dryness. hard to know, from the info you've posted, but without trying the beer it sounds like this is a brett infection."
CraftBeer,2zg26u,tothesource,2,Wed Mar 18 18:59:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely infected. I have a gang of 2013 Matildas, Sofies, and Pepe Nero's and they are drinking well right now."

I went to yards brewery in Philly and they had similar sustainability practices. Their bartop are make from recycled bowling alley lanes, their floor was made from something recycled which I don't remember. ( maybe I sampled too much :0 ) they used power from windmills, I believe recycled water, and I think using second hand grains, and I'm sure some other things I'm not remembering."

There are also a ton of things that could be done to 'be green that aren't shown here. The best I have seen is reclaiming CO2 from fermentation, scrubbing it and then using again for various processes in beer making/packaging. It otherwise takes a ton of energy to produce food grade CO2."

CraftBeer,2z4mt8,mikeyBURN,6,Sun Mar 15 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah /r/beertrade could get you Pliny almost whenever you want. Lots of Norcal guys in there, and hey, I used to travel to Plymouth, MI all the time for work myself and I used to bring CA beer with me on every trip. In fact, I would stay in Farmington Hills, and I've spent plenty of money at The Beer Baron in Livonia as well. Oddly enough, now I spend lots of time in Norcal. Pliny isn't that hard to get and it's surprisingly cheap for what it is.   As far as the question, have I used mules? Indeed, but I've got so much beer here at home now I'm trying to buy less overall so standard allocations are usually fine for me unless I feel like being the mule myself."

You shouldn't be giving up an arm and a leg for it.   Pliny is $6 for a 500ml bottle. If you're trading $20 in beer to get $10 in Pliny someone is straight fucking you over. 75 bucks for a pair of bottles is sad."

Even though it is a year round beer, it trades slightly higher than a typical shelf beer but don't go dropping KBE lol.   A Hopslam 6 pack $4$ for example which would be around 3 bottles of Pliny would be fair IMO. Yes, I know hopslam is out of season right now, but it's a comparison."

CraftBeer,2z4mt8,316nuts,3,Mon Mar 16 01:06:34 2015 UTC,For the record beer mules don't (shouldn't) take profit. Certainly not like this. Thank you boxes down the road -  maybe.

CraftBeer,2z43r7,rosfield,4,Sun Mar 15 11:01:23 2015 UTC,"Asia, I believe, is bound to be a great place for craft beer to expand.  I know Shanghai/Beijing both have seen some numbers of craft breweries going in.  My question for you - what actual experience brewing do you have?  Homebrewing or on a professional level?  Availability of hops?  I doubt equipment will be that bad to get (China seems to make some).  What is the income level of your city?  Shanghai and Beijing craft breweries tend to pull in a lot of westerners and wealthier Chinese, would you be able to do the same?"
CraftBeer,2z43r7,defroach84,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Thanks for response!    I'll try to answer your questions piecemeal and add any extra info..  I am a homebrewer but working hard on getting to a professional level.  I'm currently working with a 200L (1.75 BBL..I believe) system.  My beers are currently selling at a local expat bar and receiving good reviews.  Hops are no problem.  Baarth-Haas group distributes here--expensive but quality hops.  I'm currently working on sourcing hops directly from the US and possibly as a distributor in China.  Equipment is not a problem--quality equipment is.  But, I've found a suitable, small equipment maker that works out of a factory that creates surgical steel.  I've seen two of their systems in great functioning order.  So, when I upgrade to 500-1000L, I'll go with them.  This is a third tier city but quickly rising because of east coast pollution and this city's blue, (relatively) clean skies.  Lots of money flowing in from people escaping the east and local money (mining is huge here with lots of nouveau riche that want to show off their money to friends with expensive foreign products.  I'm quite confident that in the next 3-5 years, there's going to be a huge influx of money (non-mining..tourism, property, etc.) and 'outside' culture because of this province's great nature, weather, cultural diversity (most diverse province in country with 26 of 54 minorities)  I'm in no doubt craft beer will become popular here.  Locals are already accustomed to German and Belgian beers--and paying top yuan.    Both Chinese and expats have already had positive reactions to my beer.  I've been working hard since arriving 3 years ago to get my brewing chops up to level.  With some investment and networking with other pro brewers, expat/Chinese domestic and international, I will be able to take things to the next level.    There are already two 'microbreweries' in town that opened in the past 4 months.  One sells some of the worst beer I've had for minimum $7.50/.5L to lots of unassuming Chinese.  The other sells standard ""yellow/black"" beer mostly and is decent.  With the apparent air of 'foreign quality', these micros are no doubt making a killing selling cheap, questionable quality beer for prices that'll make any brewer in America say, ""WTF""!!  This is where I'm at.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  Cheers reddit!"

CraftBeer,2z4ld5,Hozzyk,2,Sun Mar 15 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"I was out in Phoenix last year. Finding good beer was a pain, honestly. There are some breweries that might do growlers (I don't quite remember), but I drove a bit out of the way in order to find a decent liquor store. That and the locals that were putting out good product weren't packaging at the time. (If nothing else, look into Arizona Wilderness. They put out good hoppy beers.)  Your parents might be able to track down some Firestone and a bit of The Bruery in package stores as well, but honestly, I was a little disappointed with the Phoenix beer scene."

If you like strong brews the two big breweries in AZ (San Tan and Four Peaks) are just not very good--Four Peaks Hop Knot is OK, but San Tan's IPA is almost undrinkable.

The choices for Innovation:  Start over and change their name, close up, operate without a trademark (until Bells decides to crush them next time)... according to Innovation, accept Bell's off to ""never expand beyond NC""  Now, looking at this, having invested your own time and money, and looking at Bell's only using the word ""Innovation"" as a product descriptor on like a bumper sticker... what would you actually do?"

CraftBeer,2yo65n,Wierd_Carissa,19,Wed Mar 11 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"It's helpful to put this in context before jumping to conclusions about Bell's (as I witnessed happened in the similar, recent Red Bull v. Blue Ox debacle). Bell's isn't filing suit here, they're merely objecting to a trademark application. They're not trying to ""win"" anything, and they realize that it is very unlikely that this succeeds. This is only a measure to strengthen their brand.   For instance, if another brewer comes along later with a much more similar tm to Bell's that does infringe upon them, the court asks ""Well, did you take steps to protect your tm in the past?"" If Bell's had let others that were even peripherally-similar apply for tms in the past without objection, they would be much more likely to lose in the future when they do encounter a real threat.   This is a mere precautionary measure. I'm almost positive that Bell's does not actually think this causes confusion, and they might not even be expecting to succeed. If there's anywhere to direct ire towards, it's the legal system that requires this action -- not Bell's."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,CRush1682,18,Wed Mar 11 12:50:52 2015 UTC,"The net result is still that a substantially larger and more financially capable brewery is causing an tiny upstart  struggling brewery to spend time and money that they don't have defending themselves.  I think you're 100% correct in your assessment, Bells kind of has to do this, but that doesn't change the fact that a big brewery is causing a small brewery to experience substantial negative ramifications as a result of their actions."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,Wierd_Carissa,7,Wed Mar 11 12:58:53 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. It's a shame. I found that, at least in the Blue Ox case which I followed closely, there was an outpouring of support for the small brewery which (hopefully) helped to offset the costs at least a little. I know I hadn't heard about Innovation Brew before, and I'll definitely be picking it up now if I have a chance.  However, in my eyes this is more of a flaw of the system rather than some immoral bullying by Bell's. If you want to argue that it's just not in the spirit or camaraderie of the craft beer community, then I think that's more warranted."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,Wierd_Carissa,8,Wed Mar 11 13:04:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the good insight. I see what you're saying, but for me, the disappointing part was that they are causing a very small upstart to spend a lot of money which could very well cause them irreparable damage to them financially."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,wagwa2001l,4,Wed Mar 11 13:34:19 2015 UTC,"You're right. I was merely trying to provide some context because I think that learning a little bit about trademark protection helps shed some light on the situation -- Bell's isn't doing this because they're a malicious, large corporation trying to put small brewers out of business. But yeah, the fact remains that this is really shitty for Innovation."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,Wierd_Carissa,2,Wed Mar 11 13:47:32 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but as far as I know they don't even have a trademark on the ""bottling innovation"" line, they only used it on a bumper sticker, so there's no tm for them to defend in the first place."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,wagwa2001l,-1,Thu Mar 12 04:25:09 2015 UTC,"Otherwise said...  They are trying to make a small brewer change their name because of their weak shit claim on the entire word ""Innovation""... Defend what?  Their trademark to the word ""innovation"" ... seriously?  The fact that they think they have a trademark on the word ""innovation"" to defend is disturbing enough.  Bully or legal strategy... result is exactly the same... bullying.  Your ""context"" is a weak defense to a classless act.  Remember, Bells has the easy out here... they can drop this whenever they want to.  If anything you are saying is true they can stop this... the ball is entirely in their court!  Instead they tweet about not wanting to talk about it."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,cashmoneysalad,2,Wed Mar 11 17:50:13 2015 UTC,"You can stop trying to insinuate that I've tried justifying the result here. It's immediately obvious in my reply to CRush1682 that I understand that the result is the same, and I was very clear that I was only adding context to the reason as to why Bell's is pursuing this avenue.   I'm not asking anyone to change their opinion on the matter. If you insist that context is wholly unimportant and that understanding some of the nuances of copyright and trademark law adds nothing to the conversation, then that's absolutely your prerogative; however, I thought some people would be interested in the surrounding circumstances."

Pick on a random brewer? Or, you know, you could consider how copyright and trademark law work and reason that Bell's are trying to strengthen their trademark through the exact same avenues that everyone else uses to strengthen trademarks, and that Innovation is an unfortunate casualty.  Which scenario makes more sense?"

We see larger companies take down smaller companies all the time.  And when those small companies are your friends or friends of friends, and they lose money, sleep, and their wits, it can be very frustrating.    Obviously it doesn't have to happen this way.  Other disputes between breweries have ended amicably.  I call bullshit that this is just an ""unfortunate casualty"". Maybe Bell's trademark lawyers need to be paid less, and the people who are in charge of their identity in the public eye should be paid more.  After all, what is your trademark worth if people are going to stop buying your product?  My mind can always be changed with the right information...so lay it on me if you got it.  I love learning new stuff."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,Wierd_Carissa,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a trademark lawyer either, and I definitely don't know all of the facts of this case.  The only points I was trying to make was that (1) I don't believe Bell's is filing a lawsuit here, many seem to be misunderstanding the difference between a suit and a Notice of Objection, (2) NOIs are far less serious, (I would guess that) Bell's may not expect/want to ""succeed"" here, but only to strengthen their tm for future possibilities, and this seems to be the most likely scenario.   Is it a bigger brewery taking advantage of a smaller one? Absolutely, there's no way Innovation worries about this sort of thing, much less takes action against bigger breweries.   Is Bell's to blame for this? Well, maybe. I don't know the facts, again. I was merely raising the point that Bell's intentions very likely aren't what people are insinuating, given how copyright law virtually requires companies to take action against many competitors if there's any (no matter how unlikely) chance of confusion in order for legitimate filings to be successful in the future.   Could this end amicably? I'm not sure what you mean by that... Unfortunately an inherent part of the NOI is that the small brewery has to pay for legal advice if they want to keep it.   I totally agree that Bell's might take a small PR hit here. And Innovation will probably get a PR bump. I'm a huge craft beer fan and I hate seeing large companies take advantage of small companies. However, that doesn't mean I immediately blame the large company for the way the system has been rigged. I'm not going to say that Bell's position is defensible as I don't know the particularities of this case, but I think it's plausible that their position is reasonable.   Like I said at the outset, my frustration falls towards the system that requires such action, rather than the company taking this action. I thought some others might sympathize with that if they knew the relevant legal landscape."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,sleepauger,3,Wed Mar 11 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your response, and am glad you are around here to attempt to cool off our collective jets.  And I also appreciate you not lashing out at me in response...the internet can be like that...lol.  I can definitely get fired up over this because I have seen a small business collapse because of this very thing, but that doesn't excuse me for assuming this case is similar.  It's easy to side with David when he is going up against Goliath.  I do think the consumer demand for integrity will provide Bell's with some serious backlash, regardless of the NOI...mob mentality applies even to us."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,cashmoneysalad,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"I definitely know what you mean. And it's perfectly natural to want to side with David; I'd bet that that mentality is even more prevalent in the craft beer community given how horrible some macros can be towards the growing craft beer movement.   And I agree, Bell's definitely will (and should?) get some backlash over this, I think. It's not like they're a Budweiser or Miller that can easily withstand shifting public opinion."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,wagwa2001l,2,Wed Mar 11 18:47:25 2015 UTC,I actually haven't drank anything from Bell's in over a year because of this. There is a gofundme started to help cover Innovation with legal fee's. I'd link it but I'm not sure if that would be against the rules.

CraftBeer,2yo65n,defroach84,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:41:47 2015 UTC,"To our Bell’s customers and the passionate craft beer community, We want to clear up a few things regarding our federal trademark dispute with Innovation Brewing. 1. We have not, and are not asking them to change their name or their logo. There is no lawsuit. We are not suing them. We have not asked them for money. We have not asked them to stop selling their beer. We are asking them to withdraw their federal trademark application. 2. Our concern is with their United States trademark application and potential impact on our brand, which we have spent 30 years building. 3. I personally reached out to Innovation Brewing to try to settle this matter in February, 2014 and attempted to talk about this brewer to brewer instead of involving lawyers. Our efforts were rebuffed and Innovation Brewing choose to pursue this in the legal system. 4. Over the last year, we have offered co-existence agreements and have offered to pay for their legal fees. We tried to find solutions that would work for both of us. Their response was to ask for an exorbitant amount of money and we did not feel that was a collaborative solution. 5. All offers that we proposed were rejected and after more than a year of discussion regrettably, this matter has moved to the federal trademark office. We have the utmost respect for Innovation Brewing and we are going to keep any comments we have regarding this matter positive, honest, and collaborative. We want them to continue to brew and do the good work they’re doing under their own name. We hope to resolve this as swiftly as the system will allow. The passion that we have seen over the past few days is a testament to how much the beer industry means to those who support it and why we are proud to be a part of it. We always appreciate further feedback and invite everyone to continue to share their concerns with us directly: http://bellsbeer.com/contact/ Sincerely, Laura S. Bell Vice President Bell’s Brewery, Inc."
CraftBeer,2yo65n,imacubfan21,2,Thu Mar 12 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"Innovation's side of things fully explain's all of this:  https://www.facebook.com/innovationbrewing/posts/455657244592313?fref=nf  Trying to claim the word ""Innovation"" that has never been a name or a product (and that is what Bell's is trying to do) and making offers to never let a tiny brewery ""expand out of NC"" is ridiculous.  Its not a real offer... its bullying!  Also, describing a trademark dispute as anything other than a lawsuit is just not accurate... it has all the same makings and costs $50-100k to litigate through.  Edit: Full Innovation Post:  Innovation Brewing 1 hr ·  To Our Wonderful Craft Beer Community: We felt it was important to get our story out to the media because this is an important matter for the craft beer industry. We did not intend (nor do we want to) have a social media battle with Bell's, but because of allegations posted on Bell’s Brewery’s Facebook page we now have to defend ourselves. Settlement discussions are protected communications that are not to be disclosed publicly, so out of respect to Bell’s Brewery’s rights we would never have disclosed them. Furthermore, Mr. Bell pointedly stated that he would not “play this out on social media” – and so we again respected his wishes by keeping the details to ourselves. Now, it appears they changed their mind. We are planning to deliver a full statement of the facts and events that have brought us to this point. Until then, we feel it necessary to respond to Ms. Bell’s enumerated allegations. Thank you for continuing to support and believe in us. You keep us going through this difficult time. 1. Yes, this is a TM proceeding and not a lawsuit, although it is like a lawsuit, requiring legal representation, being personally deposed, and including a trial. They are asking us to withdraw our federal trademark application for our brand name. 2. We do not believe that any human on earth would confuse Innovation Brewing with Bell’s Brewery, despite their slogans. 3. Laura Bell did contact me at 7:00 pm the night before their opposition filing was due. They had already hired attorneys to represent them and file for their extension to file the opposition. We had not hired an attorney. After she advised us that she would “let us” keep using the name in NC only, and never expand beyond it, she said that we had until the next day at 5:00 PM to respond. That is 22 hours to find an attorney and decide on the future of our business. That was the one and only attempt Ms. Bell made to contact me. From there their attorneys took over. 4. Not a single co-existence agreement has ever been presented to us by Bell's. In fact it was we who submitted a written co-existence agreement – subsequently declined by Bell’s. The only monetary compensation they have ever offered us was $2,500 which was to cover the inconvenience of being forced to abandon our trademark and go register a different one. The “legal fees”, as Ms. Bell puts it, brought on by their legal action against us, may exceed $50,000. We did not feel like being bought off. 5. This matter was before the TM office one day after she began talking to us. No offer has ever been presented to us other than the offer to limit our business to NC or take $2,500 to start over and build a new brand. We believe in our business, so those are not really offers at all. 6. In regards to Laura Bell stating ""we hope to resolve this as swiftly as the system will allow"" we suggested the accelerated trademark opposition process that would have brought this to a legal end much sooner and with far less expense, but Bell's denied it. You great people don’t deserve to be peppered with sides of the story. So we will give you a full account of the facts so you can decide for yourself. We are good people and we know we have your support. Stay tuned. -Chip and Nicole"

I would recommend getting to Dogfish head earlier in the day, if you can, as the waits can be long for the tour.    I can also recommend Flying Dog in Frederick MD, but since it is about an hour west of I-95/ Baltimore I'm guessing it might be a little too far out of the way.    If you get downtown in Baltimore, DuClaw makes some great beer and you have to stop by Max's on Broadway.  Over 100 beers on tap."

If you go to a Padres game, Mission is with walking distance from Petco Park. Societe is pretty good, and they do not bottle so you will only get that on tap. Then spend a day by exiting 15N, at Miramar road. AleSmith is a must, the new Ballast up the street is high end and plenty of GF Sculpin. Around the corner is St Archer, which is another must, and then a few minutes away you can kill 2 birds w/ 1 stone - Green Flash just bought Alpine, so you will find both breweries on tap there."

CraftBeer,2yho9o,strdrrngr,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"beeradvocate.com has a whole forum section setup for people to trade.  You list what you have and what you're looking for and other people do the same.  In person trades are easier, quicker and cheaper, but sometimes to find rare stuff you'll need to ship.  UPS and Fedex both have rules against shipping beer so don't tell them what it is.  My buddy always says ""homemade pickles"" if they ask.  All that being said you can buy some fresh in the next few weeks probably, but you'll need to keep your eye open.  My buddy here in NJ keeps track of the distributors and their new arrivals lists.  When he sees cases of KBS coming, he starts calling liquor stores and asks when they're expecting their next shipment and whether they know if KBS will be in it.  Then he plans on going there directly after work those days that it arrives.  He usually has 3-5 places scouted out.  Here in NJ KBS will fly off of most liquor stores shelves in a matter of hours.  It goes for $6-$8 / bottle, most stores have 1-2 bottle / person limits.  Few stores get to buy even 1 case to sell, you have to sell 10 cases of Breakfast Stout to qualify.  I'm friendly with the manager at my local craft beer store, so I know I'll have a few bottles set aside for me.  Good luck!"

CraftBeer,2yho9o,sirstout,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:01:42 2015 UTC,Where did you stop and how packed was it? I'm hoping to get out to at least one place for a keg tapping every other night this week and am worried about how busy places will be.
CraftBeer,2yho9o,chetbodet87,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:28:32 2015 UTC,It was at Hopcat in Grand Rapids. It was real busy for this first 30-45 minutes after it was tapped. Not bad after that
CraftBeer,2yho9o,CRush1682,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:34:03 2015 UTC,I still have 4 bottles from last year in my cellar....guess I should get on that.
CraftBeer,2yho9o,willbreathes,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"I'll be up there Thursday from Cleveland for my quota, and other goodies."
CraftBeer,2yho9o,noslo5oh,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:15:04 2015 UTC,"We tapped the CBS last week, our keg was gone in about 3 hours.. We served 4oz. pours for $6.00"
CraftBeer,2yho9o,trginter,3,Tue Mar 10 06:12:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, no wonder it took 3 hours."
CraftBeer,2yho9o,r3inb01d,1 point,Tue Mar 10 13:25:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly, when we tapped it in Saginaw we got full 12 oz. pours for $8, muliples were allowed for regular customers."
CraftBeer,2yho9o,apec766,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:12:22 2015 UTC,"Jesus, really? Place in Oakland County I frequent did KBS last year limit one and sold out in 18 minutes."

CraftBeer,2yihdt,beerploma,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:00:35 2015 UTC,First and only thing I've backed on Kickstarter. Should be a blast at my homebrew get togethers!
CraftBeer,2yevs4,salekt,3,Mon Mar 9 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"Considering how short of a time they've been open, Holy Mountain is producing some amazing fucking brews.  The King's Head Double Brown is absolutely fantastic, and their flagship pale ale is super tasty.  I'm really excited to see how their 3rd Nail for The Pine Box turns out."
CraftBeer,2yevs4,TheBeerded1,2,Mon Mar 9 05:50:44 2015 UTC,Those prices are making me sick here in Australia
CraftBeer,2yevs4,phacebook,4,Mon Mar 9 09:35:37 2015 UTC,Actually compared to most breweries these prices are quite low. Well except for the cost of a hat. $25 seems a bit steep.
CraftBeer,2yevs4,drip_pan,2,Mon Mar 9 11:45:26 2015 UTC,"No you don't get it, here in Aus a full pint costs between $10-$14. This brewery's prices are unreal amazing."
CraftBeer,2yevs4,phacebook,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:05:12 2015 UTC,$10-14 would fill a good handful of growler all season beers here. That stinks.
CraftBeer,2yevs4,drip_pan,2,Thu Mar 12 01:32:57 2015 UTC,Bottles of Stone Enjoy By are selling for $45/each here.
CraftBeer,2yevs4,phacebook,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:59:43 2015 UTC,Crazy. Should I start a brewery in Australia?
CraftBeer,2yevs4,drip_pan,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:28:58 2015 UTC,Yes
CraftBeer,2yevs4,phacebook,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:36:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, $4 pints are very reasonable, especially for a microbrewery.  $2 usually gets you a 2-3 ounce sample, not an 8 ounce glass."
CraftBeer,2yevs4,CRush1682,1 point,Mon Mar 9 12:15:19 2015 UTC,I had the Ox a couple weeks ago at Brouwer's. Delicious.
