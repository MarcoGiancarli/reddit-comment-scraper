mariokart,3e1iip,davidabeats,5,Tue Jul 21 06:10:15 2015 UTC,"1) MK8  By far my favorite. The game is so refined, the physics are fantastic, controls are fluid, there are no glitches or exploits that break the game, character variety is good, music is fantastic, courses are HD and unique, item balance is fair, the competitive scene is even blooming. The only soft spot is the lack of battle mode, but it more than makes up for it with the flawless online multiplayer and time trial miiverse.  2) MK 64  Its the original couch game. I feel like at any time I can break out the classic and give all of my friends a good time. It has plenty of tracks, speedrunning is possible, the racers are mostly balanced, just classic and stands out as one of the best titles on N64.  3) MK Wii  It was the first MK I really got into and played the most before MK8. The online was really good, one of the best on the console, and I loved staying in with the MK Channel you can download for tournaments though. Lots of fun track exploits that are difficult in TT, but nothing super game breaking for casual online play. Item balance was okay, the cloud is a shitty item though. Only thing was that pretty much everyone online was a Funky Kong Flame runner because he was the sole fastest character. Bikes were also unbalanced and way faster than karts, so there was no reason to choose anything different.  MK DS:  Probably the best handheld MK. Kart customization was incredible, character diversity was there, it was great with download play on long bus rides and field trips. I didn't play it much myself but I know how great it was.  MK7  Eh, kind of the awkward transition title. It introduced gliders which were cool, kart selection was mediocre, character diversity kinda sucked, but hell it had some great tracks. It also introduced the one lap tracks which were really fun to learn. No bikes, but at least there were a lot of karts that shared the top speed spot.  MK: SS  Not much to say. First on the go MK, I played it at school and on road trips, it was a blast. Controls were wonky but what can you expect on a GBA you know?  Super MK  Never played it. Came out before I was born. Donkey Kong Jr. was in it. It was dreadfully simple and only had 2 player capability. Not that great, but has a spot because it started it all.  MK:DD  I feel like I'm in the minority for saying this, but I have to get my opinion out somehow. Pretty much everything went wrong in this title that I didn't like (or at least don't like now that I know better, because I loved DD as a kid.) The controls were wonky as hell, drifting was extremely loose and unresponsive, tracks were sort of bland and were only difficult because the mechanics sucked, item balance was all fucked because of specials, there was virtually no character balance because whoever had better items would win anyway (damn koopas with the triple reds were broken), and kart selection was awful, especially with being connected to character weight. I didn't even play SMK but I still think it's better than DD. There's really no reason to play it over any other title in the series. If I have 3 friends over you better bet I'm playing 64 instead."
mariokart,3e1iip,TonesBalones,2,Tue Jul 21 10:26:08 2015 UTC,"I can understand everything in your critique on DD except for the part where you said   drifting was extremely loose and unresponsive   IMO, DD drifting was second to DS in the entirety (of what I've played) of Mario Kart. Could you describe that some more? If anything, I'm surprised you didn't knock Wii for that because Wii definitely had a drift with less turning ability."
mariokart,3e1iip,TonesBalones,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it was, but I just didn't like it. The drifting wasn't so much ""drifting"" as it was ""advanaced turning"" if that makes sense. The karts feel slippery to begin with, and drifting didn't help it as much. I think it was a matter of myself being so used to MK8 drifting (which is the most perfect I think) where the DD drifting felt sub-obtimal when returning to it. In MK8 you can really feel the turn when you drift, it's visceral, and it feels good to take a perfect corner by starting the drift early, while chaining turbos to get a good line on a lap. I feel like that just doesn't happen in DD.  The Wii's drifting was really different too, but then again I was using the bikes, so I expected the drifting to be different. Remember, inside drift and outside drift are completely different, and it's why I can't use bikes in MK8 because the mechanics are not the same. Also Wii still had the feel-good-line system when you take laps, especially when you use a bike and master when to use wheelies. I just think DD lacks so much consistency compared to the other games I put a lot of time into and got good at."
mariokart,3e1iip,TallAndFrat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:37 2015 UTC,"I think I get it. DD had a lot more turning ability in their drifts than 8. While that made precision drifting possible, you say it doesn't feel right. Correct? And I will admit, DD had slippery karts. If I could compare DD (and DS) to any game, I would compare it too Melee, just because of how much of it was dealing with a fairly wonky set of controls which meshed together in a beautiful way. Of course, beauty in the eye of the beholder. Anyways, I appreciate the response!"
mariokart,3e1iip,TallAndFrat,2,Wed Jul 22 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"Mario Kart 64- It was simply the best. Greatest tracks, the karts were simple giving everybody an equal chance. The items were simple as well. Everything about that game was simply amazing, if only mario kart could go back to the way this game was.  Mario Kart DS- as you said, the unique karts really made the game balanced, while I love personalization, I hated MK8's kart customization. They should've kept it simple like they did for this game. It had great maps and a nice character selection. This game is definitely up there with MK64 for me.  Mario Kart 8- 2 words...HIGH DEFINITION. The game is so damn gorgeous and plays smoothly. Other than that I'd say that's pretty much it.  Mario Kart Wii- this game was broken, hated it. However I have to give it praise for adding new vehicle ""types"", (karts, motorcycles, etc.)  Mario Kart Double Dash- I actually hated this game for having a partner, just felt weird to me.  Never played MK7  Sorry if anyone hates my guts for this, but this is my opinion! ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜¬"
mariokart,3e1iip,LuxShadow1,2,Tue Jul 21 08:48:10 2015 UTC,"No worries on my MK7! To be honest, I felt a little guilty giving my review because I really haven't played much of that game either. I wish Nintendo would have hyped it up more! And I 100% agree on 8 being beautiful. Sometimes, I just like to sit back and watch highlights after a match. Not to learn or watch, just to see the game unfold. What did you think of the replay functionality in 8?"
mariokart,3e1iip,Sevenanths,2,Tue Jul 21 20:37:40 2015 UTC,I thought it was awesome and smart! Like how it knew already what the highlight moments were within a match! Just amazing and smart that the game knew that my green shell that I threw and ricocheted off 3 mushroom penises and landed on lemmy's ugly face was the exact moment that I wanted to go and show my brother!!!
mariokart,3e1iip,Sevenanths,2,Tue Jul 21 20:48:12 2015 UTC,Did it bother you that you can't record the entire match and only highlights? I know that bothered me a slight bit.
mariokart,3e1iip,SdifOdh,2,Tue Jul 21 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"1) Mario Kart 8  Music fantastic, Characters, Fantastic, Online, superb, Tracks, completely outstanding. This game is not only my personal favourite in the series, but it carries over the formula in Mario Kart 7 and adds anti gravity into the mix, and changes how a standard mario kart race can be played. The DLC is well worth the purchase as well, almost makes the character roster as good as Wii's. A proper battle mode could have been in this game, But I love 8 for what it is. I'll be playing this game for a very long time.   2) Mario Kart Double Dash  The ONLY problem that this game had imo, was that the karts felt really slippery at times, like they were always on ice. In some aspects, the issues makes the game more unique from the rest. But apart from that, this game nails the formula perfectly. Good kart combinations, characters, music, tracks, battle mode, and lets not forget items, omg, absolute chaos. I haven't really spent a lot of time with double dash compared to the other 7 mario kart games, but this game was great.   3) Mario Kart DS  Now this game had everything you want from a Mario Kart game. Good tracks, Items, characters, decent battle mode, mission mode, and a very fun and entertaining local multiplayer experience. I had a lot of fun with this game, and that's why it's my most played DS game.   4) Mario Kart 7  I liked what Mario Kart 7 brought to the table, I liked the new mechanics introduced, music, the first really good online mode and the battle mode I felt was decent. Didn't feel like the fastest instalment in the series though.   5) Mario Kart 64  One of the best battle modes in the series, decent music, great track selection, not really any major issues with this game at all. It's a good time from start to Finish.  6) Mario Kart Super Circuit  One of the most balanced item selections in the series, and good music/track design for the GBA. It was a good handheld game imo, just held back by the GBA hardware a little.   7) Mario Kart Wii  I liked the character choices but that's it. Really didn't like the track design, online hardly ever worked for me, and the controls just didn't feel that tight.   8) Mario Kart SNES  Hasn't aged that well, not the best track variation, character choices (But I'll cut this game some slack for being on the SNES)."
mariokart,3e1iip,SdifOdh,0,Tue Jul 21 09:16:48 2015 UTC,I'm actually a bit interested in your reasoning behind DS being below DD. Could you expand on that? It almost seems from your description that you liked DS a bit more.
mariokart,3e1iip,Trikitiger,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"Before I start, a bit of background information. I was born in 1999: Mario Kart Wii was my first Mario Kart. I since then have collected every single Mario Kart physically, except for Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, which I'm still looking for for a good price, but I've played them on the virtual console and emulation.   Mario Kart Wii - MARIO KART PHYSICS FTW!!!! This game is just so full of content. 4 different controllers to use, 31 wonderful tracks (fuck you, DS Desert Hills), a ton of options and ways to unlock new characters. Charming disconnection errors and an A-MA-ZING amount of community support! Custom Tracks Grand Prix eternally extends this game's lifetime. At the exact same moment you're reading this, people are playing this game online on custom servers, ain't that crazy?! Mario Kart DS - Two words: mission mode. The replay value of this game is amazing. You can torture your thumbs and wrists by snaking a lot (especially on your shiny 3DS), but what really makes this game stand out is the multiplayer. 10 years after its release, whenever there is a school trip, everyone takes their DS and we all play VS Race, or the excellent balloon battle mode. Here's a picture of our last trip. Mario Kart: Super Circuit - This game has 40 tracks, without you having to buy DLC. The game is hard and you'll have to work hard for your three star ranking. The tiny Gameboy controls make it a bit hard to control at times, but it just adds to the overall difficulty of this game. Man, is it hard. Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart Double Dash, Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart 8 - There's nothing wrong with these games, others are just better. I don't really prefer one over the other. Mario Kart 7 - There is no VS Race mode.   Feel free to bash the hell out of me."

And fwiw, I wish there were an option in the game to keep your own camera upright, so you really see and feel it, as you arc up and twist -- the anti-grav is one of the schticks of MK8, but when racing I hardly notice/know that I'm sideways or up-side-down."
mariokart,3dv4zc,TRB4,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thoughts as well. The anti-gravity sections don't really stand out at all, I can never really tell when I am upside down or sideways. The whole thing just feels like one flat course. I only just realized how the water section in the haunted mansion is actually laid out. I kept wondering why there was a ""wall"" of water in the middle of the mansion, I finally realized that it was the surface of the water and I was driving straight down.  I agree, I wish there was a camera option that kept the camera ""right side up"" so that you could actually appreciate all of the complex architecture in each course (well maybe not Baby Park)."

mariokart,3dnqwm,TonesBalones,3,Sun Jul 19 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, I can't believe the second war was won by 4 points. Third war was an absolute blowout though, I wonder what went wrong with France."
mariokart,3dndlo,lastandfinalz,6,Fri Jul 17 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess you can be happy there even is DLC for this game. Anyways, I had just as much fun with the previous installments of the series when there were way less tracks. Replay value is great!"
mariokart,3dndlo,Sevenanths,3,Fri Jul 17 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. They can't work on DLC forever, eventually they need to move on to other projects. Plus, any ideas they get just end up in the next game. So no loss there."
mariokart,3dndlo,igward,2,Fri Jul 17 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"I'm really happy with the DLC we have though, it's what's made it my favourite instalment in the series."
mariokart,3dlz3t,ryanwb2,4,Fri Jul 17 10:12:23 2015 UTC,"It's intended to be faster but firehopping circumvents that intended mechanic, and for better players it's usually faster to stay on the ground.   Simply put, fire hopping is faster than gliding, but gliding is faster than regular driving. Therefore if you can firehop well, the ground may be a faster, but if you can't, then gliding is faster."
mariokart,3dlz3t,Chronospherics,3,Fri Jul 17 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on what your alternatives to gliding are. The others are right with fire hopping being faster but that isn't the only factor to consider. A lot of courses see new strats that skip the glider in favor of mid-air soft drifting into demon slides and trick boosts. (Tick tock clock and music park come to mind). Gliding seems to only be faster if you can't find anything in terms of boosts, tech, or sharper lines on the ground."
mariokart,3dlz3t,UnlikelyExpert,2,Fri Jul 17 14:43:22 2015 UTC,"So basically, glider is faster if you don't have anything better to do. What if demon sliding is the only alternative, like on...Sunshine Airport? Is that alone faster than gliding?"
mariokart,3dlz3t,UnlikelyExpert,2,Fri Jul 17 18:56:29 2015 UTC,"Demon sliding doesn't generate any speed, it only slows the loss of it. On Sunshine Airport you are in the air long enough that you lose your trick boost momentum. You'll see the WR TT players land in time to hit their line instead of divebombing and doing slides."
mariokart,3dlz3t,Kittyminati,3,Fri Jul 17 19:40:54 2015 UTC,I'd it depends on your build. Usually people try to stay on the ground as much as possible and keep a high momentum by fire hopping.
mariokart,3dlz3t,SnowdogMK,3,Fri Jul 17 12:24:21 2015 UTC,"Another thing to note- going on a glider ramp while small from lightning is always faster than not doing so. Getting hit by a shell while gliding will lose less speed than getting hit while not gliding.   On some courses, glider is slower than non-glider paths. But there are sometimes reasons to go glider anyway."
mariokart,3dlz3t,ClarkEbarZ,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:45 2015 UTC,It's a little faster but I would recommend that you land before the next turn is coming.
