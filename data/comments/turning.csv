turning,3e44eu,corsair027,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:01 2015 UTC,"Have you put the drill chuck into the headstock to verify that it's actually the tailstock being out of alignment? And if so, have you removed the tailstock from the lathe bed to clean and check for any noticeable imperfections that could be causing the issue, like bad milling?  A tailstock out of alignment would mean that anything using the tailstock would show obvious signs of the issue; nothing would actually pivot, they would just grind a large hole.  A ""pitch'n'pick"" option is great if it's in the budget, that means you can get something full sized for more swing."
turning,3e44eu,Silound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have verified that it is the tailstock. The 'seat' is apparently not milled very well and seems to allow too much slack when tightening it down.  It's very minor an 8mm drill bit makes a maybe 8.25~8.5 mm hole.  but it is enough that it's almost impossible to get a pen brass to stay glued in correctly."
turning,3e44eu,3226,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"If you bring the tail stock up to the spur, you should see if it's off in the horizontal or vertical. If it's too low, you may be able to add a shim underneath the tail stock at the end closest to the headstock. If it's high. you may be able to shim the other side, which can bring it down a little.    Otherwise, I'd see if taking it back to the manufacturer is a possibility. If it's a $200 lathe, it's might be an expensive fix."

It's not like you could use a scroll saw or a coping saw to cut out all those shapes.    9,10,11, I can almost see, but then #12? Would that be off axis turning to get that other hole? That seems really off center to do it.    13 is really cool. I can picture doing something like this, maybe with a waste block on three sides of a cube, and then either turning a circle on the opposite side (or even just using a forstener bit) and then chucking into the hole and doing the same on the opposite side, then repeating it twice more but smaller.     No clue how #21 was done. Those holes are right up at the end, so how could you possibly turn them? If they even were turned... ...but they look like they were.    #22 just seems impossible.

I could list a few of the minor annoyances with it, from the subpar indexing, to the silly spindle lock (easily fixed by this workaround), but none of these would cause me to not recommend it unless you were going to need the indexing a lot (e.g. lots of fluted spindles, spiral layouts etc.). All in all it's just a beautiful machine for the money, especially considering the next level up (i.e. Robust, Oneway, Vicmarc, a PM4224b) will double or nearly double the price.  As an aside, I'm kind of disappointed they stopped making the fixed headstock 4224, I thought it was really nice and they did have an attachment for outboard turning (a short extension bed and tool rest post extension as shown in this pic) that still would allow for standing off the end and not leaning over to hollow, and the price point of the 4224 would have been between the 3520B and the 4224B."
turning,3dtbru,jclark58,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:56:58 2015 UTC,"I do a ton of vacuum chucking with my 3520b. I made my own rotary adaptor using some scrap maple, a double sealed bearing, a pair of 5/8"" OD o-rings and some epoxy. There are commercial rotary adapters available from Multiple companies including Oneway, JT turning tools, and others.  As /u/tigermaple mentioned the only things I've found lacking are the spindle lock and indexing. I don't use the indexing and spindle lock is easily addressed in a few minutes including a solution that Powermatic has available: http://agoodturndaily.tumblr.com/post/90311360633/finally-got-around-to-installing-my  I also installed a secondary power switch on my lathe rather than relocate the controls completely. I made my own using parts from Home Depot that ran about $27 rather than the $100+ price of the Powermatic version. The 18"" bed extension is also incredibly nice to have.   The 3520b only has 2 pulleys. Low (50-1200) and hi (125-3200). Control within those ranges is fully electronic. If you don't need the extra torque of the low speed range you could easily leave the lathe in the high speed range all the time. The 4224b actually has 3 pulleys so you'd be more likely to need to change the belt on a 4224b than you would a 3520b.   You mentioned the jet 1642. It's essentially just a smaller version of the Powermatic. Any shortcomings (other than the 42"" vs 35"" bed length difference) will be found on both lathes. In face the driver belt on the 1642 is slightly smaller than one on the 3520b. That's not to say that it's a bad lathe. It's still one of the best lathes on the market at that price point and would serve almost everyone very well."
turning,3dtbru,tigermaple,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"Oh! I forgot to mention this along the lines of ""anything else missing""- this is probably my biggest issue with it- the control box isn't movable in a magnetic box like it would be on most of the other big lathes. There is this aftermarket part available that only contains the on/off, not the speed dial or fwd/reverse, and there is this homemade solution but that voids the warranty. (I've got 1 year of warranty left and will probably do this after).  So, I think that gives you an honest view of all the ""good, bad and the ugly"" and I'd still highly recommend this lathe, but I think Powermatic could add better indexing and spindle lock and a movable control box for very little cost increase and make a great machine that much better."

You should be able to hog way more out with the bowl gouge, you'll just have to put some time in and get used to it. That black gouge looks to me like it's one of the continental style spindle gouges, a style very closely related to a spindle roughing gouge and an advanced turner can in theory use one to great effect to tame wild grain on the inside of a bowl, but this technique is just way too risky for a beginner (and a lot of us advanced turners, me included, won't mess with it either because there are other, less risky approaches)- when you get a catch with that technique, the tool just isn't built to withstand those forces and the little tang can snap.   The bowl gouge, on the other hand, is solid round bar stock all the way down in to the handle and can thus withstand the greater forces generated by bowl turning.  Here's one video I just found with pretty good footage showing how to use a gouge like your bowl gouge to cut the inside of a bowl."

That's essentially what's happening with a big catch on a side grain oriented project. Will it always break? Probably not, maybe not even most of the time, but the risk is there.

Just to comment on a few- I really dig the evolution of Molly Winton's work in a slightly new direction, Marilyn Campbell's forms are super elegant as always, and Christian Burchard's pieces are still some of my all time favorites.

turning,3d24br,Happystepchild,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:39:14 2015 UTC,This is a buckeye burl that was excavated by a massive excavator on a job I was working. The operator was nice enough to drop the 600lb burl into my truck for free because it saved them a trip. The hardest part was waiting for it to dry out. It is somewhat difficult to work with because it is fairly soft. You need really sharp tools!

turning,3d0vh5,ensulyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It was super fun too. For a long time, I've kind of held off on doing any projects like this that are essentially a copy of a ""signature style"" of another turner (in the turning world at large, this is immediately recognized as something inspired by Jimmy), but it was hard not to give it a go after seeing the video and I had a lot of fun with it.  It is definitely something to work up to- you've got to have good enough gouge skills that you kind of know where the gouge is in space and what it's doing without looking at it so that you can look at the far edge for how the profile is developing like Jimmy talks about in the video.  On the other hand, I think once you do have some of that tool control, it's a much safer project than you might think- you'll be using a nice sound piece of kiln-dried wood for it, so the risk of it coming apart is a lot lower than something with a lot of bark inclusions and voids for example."

turning,3d0vh5,jclark58,2,Sun Jul 12 17:19:04 2015 UTC,I don't have a lathe at the moment so I'm unable to enter this month but this is a fabulous piece. The curves are just right and it's nicely finished with a nice piece of curly maple. My only critique (hope you don't mind) is that the handle on the lid looks a little chunky. A slightly thinner diameter and a little bit of a curved profile would really help lighten it up. Regardless this is a real beauty which sets the benchmark that other should now strive to beat.
turning,3d0vh5,Mhoku,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:29:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! & no, I don't mind the critique at all; quite the contrary, I really appreciate it as I'm always up for learning and improving my forms and I agree 100% with your assessment about the handle. In fact, when I was turning it I thought that same thing (I should make it curvier and skinnier) then chickened out due to the weak grain orientation. I'm going to play with this idea some more, and I think some future ones will have a blackwood or bocote finial as the handle.  That's a bummer about your lathe being packed up! I had forgotten about that and was looking forward to your entry. With all the time you've put in on your club, isn't there anyone that would lend you a couple hours on their machine?"

They seem to have a long history of cutting corners on their lathes. (In fact they are getting blasted on some of the other forums for some major QC issues with their latest lathe release right now).  On that one, I don't like the looks of that flimsy tool rest extension, at at 600 RPM as a low speed, they didn't really give you a low speed low enough to safely take advantage of the 16"" swing as a beginner.  Depending on your budget, I'd suggest a couple alternatives: The HF 12x33 is pretty close to the same form factor, but at $240 with coupon, you could try things out and sell it easy for $150 later and recoup more of your purchase cost when you upgrade if you decide this is for you. (This Grizzly on the other hand, will get about $300 used tops).  Going the other direction, it might be worth stretching for the Jet 1221VS or Rikon 70-220VS with an extension for either one. You get a better variable speed mechanism that way (true EVS instead of Reeves drive)."

I've got an Australian version, and in my opinion, its a piece of crap.   The swivel head in this unit is more trouble than its worth - the detents don't line up with the tailstock, so you have to lock it halfway in between. The reeves drive (the speed change mechanism) is prone to failure in a few different ways, but it is also extremely noisey.  If you can wait/afford it, the Nova 1624-44 is much better.  edit: of course, I replied to the wrong person because herpaderpa blurk."

I got some experience learning from him, (and still have a bunch of ""practice pieces"" he made floating around. tiny plates and such he made for my Sister's dollhouse).   Later on (much later) I just got a lathe, and some tools, found Richard Raffan and Roy Underhill, and just chewed up wood.   Now, I'm actually making stuff.   membership in a club is awesome.. just about every woodcraft has one. AAW is.. well. I think it's aimed more at the gallery turner than the hobby turner these days.   Get a lathe. Get basic tools. Get some cheap 2x4s, rip em in half, and make them round. Then play with the tools and learn how to make beads and coves and such. 60% of turning is muscle memory and figuring out the tools. About 40% is actual design and asethetics, in my opinion.

Harbor Freights sells lathe-like objects. They are okay. They are not fantastic, but they work. For 300$ you can get a reversible head lathe, variable speed, that's a lousy clone of a Jet lathe, but will make wood round for you. Another 200 in tools, and you are set to do basic turning. (or you can go with mini lathes and do pens, small bowls and boxes and such).   IMO ,it's worth it to spend the money on good tools. At least, some of the tools. A good spindle gouge, a rougher, a skew, and a bowl gouge, and some sort of parting tool. That's enough to learn on and turn a LOT of stuff. Wood can be found (literally) laying by the side of the road.   Honestly though.. it's not likely you are gonna get rich doing this. I'm lucky to cover my time, materials, and kits selling pens. That doesn't even touch the 1100$ lathe, and 800 in tools I have.   But, I'm not in it to get rich. I'm in it because I genuinely enjoy the experience of making stuff.

For whatever reason, I actually resisted turning for a long time- the then director of the program had a bit of a negative view of turners to say the least, which I wound up adopting and it wasn't until I needed to turn some handles for my workbench vises that I first tried out the lathe.

I signed up for my first semester-long turning class the semester after that and never looked back, I've gone on to take classes with some of the top pros at Anderson Ranch Arts Center.  I'll state what is probably going to be an unpopular view but think classes are vastly superior to club meetings if you have access to them.

You could just buy a lathe and some tools and learn from youtube videos, but if you decide to do it this way a couple of suggestions, don't get the really cheap sets of turning chisels,   Like These  http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/1951474052_1/Free-Shipping-to-Brazil-U-S-and-Russia-Super-Cheap-8-in-1-8HSC-Wood-Turning.jpg  They are ok, but if you have trouble at first it very well could be the cheesy tools rather than any lack of skill on your own part.   My suggestion is buy 3 or 4 good second hand chisels, Sorby or Marples turn up fairly often and are good. I picked up 32 chisels for a total of $300 NZD whereas a new chisel of one of those two brands ran at about $160 for one.  Also don't buy one of these cheap lathes  http://www.nctractorspares.co.uk/ekmps/shops/nctractor/images/wood-lathe-1000mm-39183-p.jpg  They are many different badged brand names, but they are all the same lathe and they are pretty horrible to use, the bed flexes in places it shouldn't, and it'll just frustrate you.  The first time you put chisel to wood, sure use a cheap bit of pine, the second time, get something better like European beech, it will behave itself so much more than pine does and will be a joy to turn, rather than catching all the time and gouging huge chunks out of it that you didn't mean to do.  Look up ""riding the bevel"", you will turn more safely and you will feel better control, get proper eye protection, safety glasses at the least, preferably also a full face shield.   Look up videos on stance and chisel grip, watch a lot of videos, there are plenty of good ones out there.  If you find turning dry wood a little scary and just want to learn without any problems try turning some green wood, it's a lot of fun to turn and not scary at all.  Lastly look up the turning speeds for different thicknesses and roundnesses of wood eg:  http://www.woodworkingtalk.com/attachments/f12/74721d1373123277-lathe-turning-speeds-nova_dvr_speed_chart.jpg  I found I couldn't master the skew chisel at all, till I used a nice small rigid mini lathe with european beech and the piece turning at the right speed, when I had all that right that wood turned so smooth I didn't even need sandpaper, nobody I knew in my class could master the skew on pine on a big lathe. Sometimes it's not you, it's the wrong tools, set wrong with the wrong wood.  Just my 2 cents worth."

Many offer weekly or monthly ""mini-workshops""; often they will also bring in 'name' turners to present longer weekend workshops. There'll more than likely be a bunch of people willing to show you basics for free. Often times there are members with older equipment for sale. some clubs own a 'loaner lathe' to get people started before they can buy their own...  You won't know what's available until you call and talk to them.  If you're in the US, contact the American Association of Woodturners.

And 'turning tools' are the tools used to actually shape the piece.        Start by looking for lathes on your local craigslist, kijiji, used site. If you'd like you can even post the link to it in the comments and we can have a look for you.       You want something solid, preferably cast iron. It should be in good working order.

turning,3cqmcs,Mikedealer,3,Fri Jul 10 01:20:09 2015 UTC,"Cutting direction can make a big difference in preventing the tearout, as stated before.  The idea is to always cut in a way that allows the wood fibers being cut to be supported by longer fibers below so that there is support to allow the tool to cut, as opposed to breaking the ends of the fibers off.  Kind of like when drilling holes through a piece of wood...if you don't put a waste block on the back side, the drill bit breaks the fibers as it comes out of the wood, because they are unsupported.    Here are three tutorials explaining how to determine the proper cutting direction in various projects."

The reason is that the Longworth chuck is designed to center a round object between the stops, but a green-turned bowl is anything but round: it's elliptical from the drying process.

I needed the throw and girth for what I make.  If you don't need that kind of throw, I honestly think the variable speed Nova is a real winner at a more reasonable size and price for GREAT quality.  Consider this, I am part pro, and am able to make great stuff with this intermediary step.

turning,3c829d,MeetGreeper,3,Sun Jul 5 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"Mounting threads are not standard, but there are only 3 or four sizes.. figure out the diameter and thread pitch, and you are good.   There are specific angles, but they vary a bit based on personal preference. Spend some time on Youtube looking up gouge sharpening videos.. there's plenty out there, that show you how to freehand and use jigs (both home made and commercial) to get the grinds you want. Personally, I'd stick with the grinds on the tools you got, until you get more comfortable with the tools themselves. So, that's as simple as setting your grinder rest to replicate the grind that's already there, and gently retouch the edge.   There are plenty of ""Beginner"" videos on the web of basic tool concepts and use. Start with some cheap, soft wood.. like cheap not knotty 2x4s, ripped in half, to learn some basic technique. roughing, basic cylinder forming, beads and coves. Work them till you a comfortable handling the tools. Pine is soft, if you get a catch it won't be nearly as spectacular an event as doing so in maple or similar, and won't yank the tool out of your hand in the process.   practice bevel rubbing and finish cuts.. learn how the tool works best. Then move on to more avant garde stuff."
turning,3c829d,ctrum69,2,Sun Jul 5 20:00:05 2015 UTC,"Are the mounting threads standard for all lathes?   Sadly, no. Common modern sizes include: 1"" × 8 tpi, 1 1/4"" × 8 tpi, M33 x 3.5 or something like that in non freedom units, 3/4"" × 16 tpi and 3/4"" × 10 tpi.   I need to get a grinder to sharpen my tools. Are there specific angles they should be ground to?   Yes, yes you do (need a grinder). Don't let anyone waste your time telling you different. As for specific angles, yes and no. Spindle gouges and skew are somewhere in the neighborhood of 40°, bowl gouges around 55-60°, and scrapers maybe 70°, but these are just starting points that are adjusted according to wood used and the experience level of the turner (or, in other words, ask 10 different turners and you'll get at least 11 different answers).  I would recommend watching this 90 minute sharpening video from the American Association of Woodturners  You'll also need a jig like the Wolverine to go with your grinder."
turning,3c829d,tigermaple,2,Sun Jul 5 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't NEED a jig. Quite a few turners hand sharpen.. lacer, raffan, Betty, and others, all have videos explaining how to freehand a very nice edge. Jigs are nice.. but if you don't have the fundamental understanding of the angles you are trying to replicate, they are confusing as all get out. Practice angles and freehanding on cheaper tools.. don't grind up a 75$ cryo learning how to freehand."
turning,3c829d,ctrum69,3,Sun Jul 5 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"True enough, and there is indeed some instruction about freehand sharpening in the video I linked! I guess he could always try first if budget is a primary consideration."

There are several separate tutorials to go through, each explaining how changing the grinding angles affects the cutting properties of the tool.  The tutorials are here: http://www.turningblanks.net/blogs/education-center  Also, as mentioned below, be sure to check out the sharpening information that AAW offers.

(close the flute if you do this, or you will get a huge catch!)  Are you sure you can't get it higher than 800 RPM? Speed is also a key with anything like this and the piece shouldn't really be out of balance- it's just a square mounted on center. How do you have it mounted?

turning,3bo7mj,RandomJ8618,4,Tue Jun 30 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"Turning a pen blank isn't going to produce gobs of ribbon-like shavings, you'll wind up with a reasonably-sized pile of shavings & dust.  I'd recommend watching a pen turning videos on YouTube to see what kind of tools others use and how fast their progress is."
turning,3bo7mj,DavidPx,2,Tue Jun 30 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"Two things:   Surface speed of your material may also be causing you some problems. Remember that the speed at which the material moves past your chisel changes with the diameter of the material. Personally, I turn my pens around 2000 RPM. I've just gotten used to taking very gentile light cuts until I'm no longer cutting air.  Also, the tool you use makes a difference in your efficiency. I slough off waste with a sharp 3/4"" spindle roughing gouge, then follow up with a swept-back grind 1/2"" bowl gouge to complete my shaping before sanding. It takes about 5 minutes to go from square to sanding unless I'm doing an overly complex shape. With care and practice, you can easily use larger tools which make more efficient cuts. That cuts down drastically on your turning time, but does slightly increase your chances of ruining a piece. Only practice and experience will really let you eyeball a blank and determine how aggressive you can be with your tools."
turning,3bo7mj,Silound,3,Wed Jul 1 18:02:03 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to bet it's the speed.  I use a shopsmith as my lathe, and not knowing any better when I started, I used the recommendation from the manual on what speeds to use.  They were aiming these speeds at spindle turners I'm guessing, because it says up to 2"" to round at 850 RPM, shape at 1300.  This does indeed take forever on a pen, seam ripper, etc.... I mentioned this at my turning club, and after poking a bit of fun at me for using a shopsmith and trying to turn something that small, that slow, they set me straight.  I now turn these things at 3500 RPM.  I go from square to sanding in about 3 minutes, unless I'm doing something intricate."
turning,3bo7mj,g1bs0nsg,2,Wed Jul 1 20:19:31 2015 UTC,Depends all on what material your turning.  acrylics take a lot longer to turn that wood.  wood I can turn a slimline down in a couple minutes and acrylics takes id say ten+.  Reason is on wood I can take a much larger bite than acrylic.    I also turn fast so maybe if your going slow try that.
turning,3bo7mj,CrimsonKeel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:35:50 2015 UTC,"It might be the angle you're presenting the tool to the work.  If the pen mandrel is the center of the circle, your cutting tool shouldn't be pointing towards it.  If you do that, you get a very fine scraping cut that will produce  basically just sawdust.  In order to cut, it needs to be at an angle to the diameter of the work piece."

Well, it depends on what type of finish you settle for. While there isn't a lot to the turning portion of it, there is plenty to the finishing - particularly if you go for CA or polyurethane.   Then there is cast pen blanks (which can be useful for other small kits/handle projects like bottle stoppers), or segmented and/or inlayed pens - including things like celtic knot pens.   There is plenty of room to learn.  Edit: also if you're just starting out, they're pretty good for learning different tools - gouges, scrapers and skews can all be used to make pens.

turning,3baf0h,tigermaple,3,Sat Jun 27 21:46:44 2015 UTC,when you really think of it turning is just carving quickly in a circle.

turning,3baf0h,tigermaple,2,Sat Jun 27 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"Amen to that. The lathe is just one tool out of many (and a very successful turner told me once that he considered the lathe just another carving tool), and I spend way more time worrying about whether or not I am developing my own voice and producing work with good, elegant forms that people will enjoy and hopefully purchase and less time thinking about what they'll call it.  In fact I think all the distinctions in woodworking are pretty silly (I really think it's silly that we have all these separate subs). I'd rather see more postings just go back to /r/woodworking and there will be some projects that inspire you more than others but not necessarily because they are turnings or not.

You could build a good finish with shellac and it cures really fast and would be easy to repair later on if needed.  I would probably wipe it down with naphtha or alcohol to dry it as much as possible, then try a straight varnish with a short open time.  Let that set up for maybe a week or two, then go back and do a little 400 sand or 0000 steel wool with some mineral spirits as lubricant and add another coat or two.  If he maintains it with a little bit of paste wax periodically it should hold up really well.  If you let it cure for a couple of weeks in between coats, and do that little leveling sanding between coats, I think you'll be really happy with the result.  You'll also be able to rub out the finish to pretty much any sheen you like.  Get a little bit extra for finish sampling just in case and you'll be fine.

Cut most of the shape of the acorn, part off, square off (if doing more than one out of a long piece), repeat. Throw in your cap material, drill the larger size hole, sand, finish, cut most of your cap shape, part off. Put in your first jam chuck, jam the nut on there, finish cutting the point and refining the shape, sand, finish, swap out the chucks, put the one sized for the caps on there, repeat process.

Even with the Tormek jigs, you still have control over the shape by how much you grind each place around the gouge.  I have this problem (the dip near the tip) too with a couple of my gouges (at A/P65/JS4) takes some paying attention to keep it from happening.  I'll have to watch the vid that u/tigermaple posted - it is likely to have good info."
turning,3b517w,ctrum69,3,Fri Jun 26 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"pretty much a traditional grind there. If that's what you are after, just grind the top of the flute down flat before you sharpen. The angle you grind it at will determine how well it back-cuts and how sharp of a transition you can make.  edit by ""flat"" I mean a consistant angle from the top of the flute, where you side grind ends, to the tip, where the nose grind ends. Just wanted to be clear that I don't mean ""Flat"" as in ""in line with the top of the flute"".   And what jclark58 said.. grind the wings.. then just quickly roll across the tip enough to even out the nose, and bring it right up to sharp edge."
turning,3b517w,jclark58,2,Fri Jun 26 03:01:20 2015 UTC,I don't use a tormek but it looks like you're spending too much time grinding the tip and not enough time grinding the wings. I usually grind both wings first and then grind the tip just long enough to connect the wings to each other. Actual time spent grinding the tip is less than a second while the wings may be a couple seconds each.
turning,3b517w,tigermaple,2,Fri Jun 26 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"No experience with the Tormek either, but according to this new Glenn Lucas sharpening video, the flute shape of that gouge may be contributing to your problem - you're getting a dip just where he says you will with a V-shaped gouge.

I assume you mean lining up the grain so that it looks like it continues from one section to the next? It's possible, but takes some trial-and-error.  Drill the holes in the end of both blanks. Epoxy one half of the coupler in one blank. Screw the other half into the other blank, without glue. Assemble them together. See how far off the grain is.  Now disassemble and remove the unglued half. Sand down the end  of that blank slightly. Keep it perpendicular - I use a disc sander. The amount of material to remove depends on how far off the grain was. If it was off by 180 degrees, you want to remove about 1/2 pitch depth. But it's easiest to just remove a bit, reassemble, see how close you are, and repeat until it lines up.  Glue it up and turn the sections."

turning,3ap3ul,PotViking,2,Mon Jun 22 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"automotive sandpaper stuck down on a glass or marble dead flat surface with water. Gives you an edge you can split atoms with. Worht it for wood chisels (the chop and trim kind), plane irons, etc. I have not found much benefit to that on a skew or other turning tool.   I occasionally regrind the flats on my skews (big and small oval) with the grinder (or more likely an old sanding disc on my bench sander), then just touch up the edges while turning with a diamond block mounted on a bench. With a bit of practice you learn to register the flat with the block, and can do a quick, very sharp touch up that way in less than a minute.  As to gouges.. I'll also touch them up now and then (especially bowl gouges with a fingernail), with small diamond card sharpeners. Again, register the flat on the the stone, and do a quick touchup.   I've also got a set of slipstones for touching up the inside of the flute, but find I use them very rarely.   For scrapers.. usually the burr off the grinding wheel is enough (same for roughing gouges and most spindle gouges), but I do have a machine steel rod set in a plate with a fulcrum so you can lever the end of the scraper across it to raise another burr instead of using the grinder.   Depending on the wood, I will sometimes polish the bevel on my finish tool(s) with a buffing wheel, if I really want a glass smooth finish on my last pass. (Spindle, not bowl.. scrapers are typically the only way to eliminate tearout on bowls)."
turning,3ap3ul,le_ebin_maymay,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"I always do on flat chisels. On anything curved I usually just use the grinding wheel, and do a very light edge touch-up with a stone."

turning,3ap3ul,Peterb77,2,Mon Jun 22 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"It's because (besides the skew chisel which does benefit from honing), there is little to no practical benefit to going beyond the edge from the grinder for the remainder of the gouges. In fact, depending on which techniques you are you using, honing can actually make the tool less effective. (The Ellsworth scrape and shear scrape with the wings of the bowl gouge for example, work the way they do because of the burr left by the grinder)."

turning,3api8m,gotwoodllc,3,Mon Jun 22 13:24:50 2015 UTC,"If you pick this up, be sure to go through some maintenance checks before you use it.  Check the drive belts for wear, and replace if necessary.  Worn belts can cause a lot of extra vibration, which will make turning more difficult.  Check the headstock and tailstock bearings as well.  If the bearings squeak while being rotated, consider replacing them soon.  Grab the spindles in the headstock and tailstock and see if they have any side-to-side play in them.  If so, you probably want to go ahead and replace the bearings.    Check the smoothness of the top surface of the tool rest.  If it is rough and worn, sand or grind it until it is smooth.  A rough tool rest makes turning more difficult, as the tool will not move freely from side to side.  Additionally, check for any cracks in the cast iron parts.  If there are cracks in the headstock casting where the bearings are pressed in, be VERY careful.  If this crack decides to open up and break apart while you are turning, you could have a very serious accident on your hands.  The spindle could come free and cause lots of damage to the lathe, you shop, and most importantly you!"

I've got this one from Craft Supplies right now & been real happy with it. What your goal is with this step is to remove any embedded metal to expose fresh abrasive on the wheel, as well as getting the wheel concentric to the axis of the grinder arbor, so use a light touch but firmly anchored to the platform so that you aren't following any bounciness in the wheel but rather are smoothing it out.  Next time I feel like splurging on a tool, I'm looking in to one of these Don Geiger dressers that references the back of the Wolverine platform as you dress to ensure that you get the wheel concentric.  Also, I have the Wolverine wheel balancing system referenced in the video and I've got to say I was less than impressed with the difference it made. It helped some, but not $70 worth. If the arbor of the grinder runs nice and smooth with no wheels but you still have trouble even after dressing the wheels a few times, the upgrades I'd look in to before the wheel balancer would be 1. upgraded wheels and 2. machined bushings to replace the plastic ones"

turning,3adjvn,o-ffset,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"Redwood would soak up a lot of whatever you put into it, so a hard barrier surface would be best.  Epoxy is probably the best option, since that would also strengthen the wood quite a bit (redwood is kinda soft).  Next best would be several coats of a polyurethane or something similar.  If the cup won't ever have alcohol in it, shellac is a good option because it adds character to the grain, protects the wood, and stabilizes it (but it is alcohol soluble). To get into whether these are food safe or not is an argument that will probably never end.  I believe that any finish is food safe if it is allowed to cure long enough.  If that makes you nervous, then a simple boiled linseed oil might be what you're after."

turning,3acpso,tipperoffedoras,3,Fri Jun 19 01:16:10 2015 UTC,"Here are a few other tips for selling at craft fairs:  Bring a good variety of different projects so that you can see what items are more popular for future events.  Small, low priced items will usually sell more quickly.  Larger, more expensive items will sit much longer.  Having a wide variety of items in different price ranges will bring the best overall income in the long-term.  Make sure to advertise.  High quality, well-designed business cards do well.  People may want to contact you in the future to do more work.  Freebies (like printed refrigerator magnets) do very well for reminding people about your business later down the road.  Doing turning demos on site, if possible, will attract a lot more attention to your booth and help you sell.  If you do decide to do demos, be sure to keep them simple so that you can bring only the tools/supplies that you need.  Don't forget a tarp or piece of plastic to keep below the lathe to allow for easier cleanup.  Make sure to bring/wear safety equipment.  As stated below, do not underprice your work.  Consider the cost of all supplies needed to produce each piece, and add in a fair hourly rate for your labor.   You'll want to make your booth look as professional as possible.  Costs can be overwhelming when getting started.  Come up with a plan for what you want your booth setup to look like in the future (if you plan to do more), and start building your booth setup piece by piece, adding additional features during upcoming shows.    Is this an outdoor event or an indoor event?  If outdoors, a good canopy is invaluable.  Be sure to bring the necessary sunscreen, bug spray, snacks and drinks.  While you're there, be sure to check out the other vendors if/when you have time.  See what is working well for them and take note."

turning,3acv6j,BradenGV,3,Fri Jun 19 02:04:02 2015 UTC,"Note: As an example, I've linked all items related to 7mm Slimline Pen Kits since those are by far the most common and popular to start with.   For just the turning, you would need:   #2 MT Mandrel (if the seller does not include one). Doesn't have to be fancy. This one is nice to start with, and includes 5 bushings for 7mm kits (save a dollar!). Pen kits that you want to make. Most people start with 7mm Slimline kits because they're inexpensive, the shape is easily customized, and they look good. It's what I would recommend. PSI, by the way, is probably the most popular place to buy kits. Bushings that match the pen kit you want to turn. If you look at a pen kit's specs on Penn State, it will give you a link for the correct bushings and drill bits necessary. The mandrel I linked includes bushings already, however if you get a mandrel and need 7mm bushings, here they are. Drill bit to match the tubes for your pen kit. Again, look at the specs area on the kit you want and it will show you which bit you need. This one will work for 7mm kits. A barrel trimmer is a must have for your pen projects as well. Holes drilled in blanks are never quite 100% straight, and if you don't trim the end of the blank flush and square to the tube, then the pen won't fit together correctly; there will be gaps between the parts. That particular one is for a 7mm kit, but there are identical ones for all of the major tube size kits. Sandpaper in various grits. I personally use 180, 220, 320, 400, and 600 girts on my pens. Adhesive to glue the brass tubes into the blanks. Some people use epoxy or other glues, but I prefer cyanoacrylate (aka: CA or superglue) since I use it for finishing the pens. You can use plain old off the shelf thick CA from your local hobby store or buy it online wherever you want. In my experience, a 1oz container of CA glue seems to last for about 40 pens, less if you also use it to finish them. If you use CA, the spray accelerator really helps. Finishing substance. There are probably no less than a dozen ways to finish pens: waxes, oils, bars, glues, shellac, etc etc. Back in the 90's, I started out with the HUT PPP bars (Satin & Gloss), which are a friction wax bar that was very popular. These days, I prefer CA glue mostly because it's fast and takes a very nice shine without too much work. Unfortunately, it's also a bit more expensive. This kit includes absolutely everything you need to finish pens via the CA method (do not use that thin glue for your tubes!!).    It's early, I'm a hair foggy yet, but I think I covered everything there.  If you're getting into this on a real tight budget, shoot me a PM and I'll check my storage unit to see if I have some extra 7mm stuff somewhere."

turning,3aaqb2,ctrum69,2,Thu Jun 18 16:14:22 2015 UTC,"The wood is walnut.  Thank you for the info, I will give it a try."
turning,3aaqb2,ctrum69,2,Thu Jun 18 16:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. walnut really benefits from the long ways sanding. Also, make sure you dust or brush off the spindle in between grits. Paper loses chunks of abrasive as you use it. If those stay on the wood, you are simply sanding with them again, and again, as you move through the lighter grits.. canceling out your efforts to refine the scratches to basically invisible levels.   I also wet and resand the last two grits on wood.   It becomes really evident when you work with acrylics."
turning,3aaqb2,ctrum69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:25:58 2015 UTC,The spindle has tight areas which sand paper can't reach because it's too bulky. Do you use any of those sanding strings or strips? I have been cutting sanding discs and using them.
turning,3aaqb2,Silound,2,Thu Jun 18 16:33:38 2015 UTC,"I use the red, fabric backed sanding tape for just about everything. Though, I've found, the tighter areas often don't need as much sanding (if your skew or gouge technique is good), as that sort of cut tends to leave a nearly finish ready surface anyway.   But yeah, you can totally wrap some paper around a dowel, or fold it into a V, .. I've even pinched it around a paint stirrer to get into square sided, flat bottomed grooves cut with a parting tool."

turning,3a7qbv,wesleysull,6,Wed Jun 17 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"Looks like some beautiful stuff that would definitely be worth turning.  To make sure that the wood is usable until you are able to turn it all, make sure you do all of these things: 1- Remove the pith (center of the tree).  If the pith is left in any blocks that you have, cracks will radiate out and destroy some of the surrounding wood. 2- Seal the blocks of wood with either end grain sealer like Anchorseal (preferred method) or with leftover latex paint.  You do not need to seal the entire block...just areas where the end grain (the ends of the wood fibers) are exposed, or in places where there is heavy figure, such as in the crotch of the piece you have with the two limbs. 3- Store the pieces in a cool, dry place.  If you don't have a cool place to store them, at least keep them protected from direct sunlight and heavy air flow.  Doing these three things should allow the wood to dry slowly and minimize defects while being stored."

turning,3a89jd,wesleysull,5,Thu Jun 18 00:29:36 2015 UTC,"I've been cutting and selling turning stock for over 10 years now, and use paraffin wax for all sealing.  Anchorseal and paint do both work quite well (we used both when we got started in turning), but cracks still can develop in more difficult to dry woods (oak, hickory, beech, etc).    The paraffin, if not applied correctly WILL flake and crack.  If done right, though, it creates an excellent seal.  Here's what you'll need to do:  Buy a turkey roaster at Wal-Mart.  They are around $35, and are capable of heating the paraffin to the proper temperatures, but not capable of heating it too much.  Heat the wax to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit to seal most woods.  The only exceptions are ones with low initial moisture contents, such as cedar and mesquite (or woods that have already dried a lot).  Dryer woods need only about 190 degrees Fahrenheit.  Dip your blank into the wax, and allow to sit for a few seconds before removing.  This ensures that the wax penetrates slightly into the wood fibers and bonds to the wood surface.  A properly sealed surface looks fairly clear and evenly coated.  If the block looks somewhat dry, as if a heavy coat of oil had been rubbed into it, then you'll need to reduce the temperature and try again.  If the block looks opaque, and has fine cracks appearing in the wax coating, then you'll need to increase the temperature and try again.  One special note: Really wet, freshly cut woods with high moisture contents need a day or two of air drying prior to sealing, or the wax will not adhere properly.  Bradford pear, sycamore, and red elm are all good examples of this.  Their moisture contents can be upwards of 110% when freshly cut, and they will literally leak water out of the end grain for a few days.  Stack these blocks to allow for some air flow until the outer surfaces appear dry, then seal them.  You'll get much better results."

turning,3a00uz,Clbrosch,2,Tue Jun 16 14:21:53 2015 UTC,Ha! I'm also having a hard time believing just based on the photos that it's only 130 pounds. There are a couple modern mini lathes that weigh around that much and your lathe is around twice as long so...
turning,3a00uz,Silound,3,Tue Jun 16 14:24:10 2015 UTC,It was exceptionally awkward as well. The table on which it's mounted has about a half inch if clearance for grip. Between my brother in law and I we had to take it in stages. Both of us are weightlifters and while we're not breaking any records I know I can get 200lbs off the ground and up to my chest on a decent day!  If that sucker weighed 130 pounds I'm going to be shocked!
turning,3a00uz,tigermaple,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:33:49 2015 UTC,yes that is exactly right
turning,3a00uz,Silound,2,Wed Jun 17 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"Pic number 4 almost looks like the motor casing was welded and ground on at some point. Odd, but if it runs, it runs.  Pictures 7/9 are cheap Sears-Craftsman chisels. I obtained those exact sets early on, and they're absolutely dire garbage in my opinion because they are cast rather than forged and coated with a black substance that also makes the difficult to sharpen. There's also no bowl gouge in the set, and that's an important tool to have. I would spring towards a decent entry-level set of chisels online as soon as you are willing to drop the money.   Picture 8 is a MT1/2 adapter. Morse tapers are simply a system of machine tapers to hold tools or chucks. Friction from surface contact prevents them from turning with the lathe spindle and the taper makes it easy to pop it loose with a quick tap from behind. If you look at the spindle on your lathe (drive shaft if you prefer), there's a hole going all the way through it from the handle on the end. You simply put something like a dowel or metal rod through that hole and tap it a few times and the winged drive center will pop right out of the spindle (make sure you catch it so it doesn't dent the wings or point!).  Pictures 10/11 are a form of drive heads so that the lathe has good grip on the work piece to turn it. The screw center is used instead of the standard winged center (see the headstock of your lathe, there's one inserted). The arbor works just like the arbor on a saw; the nut screws back and one of the sleeve bushings comes off to allow something to be sandwiched between them.  Picture 12 is a basic faceplate. It's an older forged one, you can tell by looking at the screw holes and the thickness. Newer faceplates have more holes in different patterns and are thinner.  So all in all, you have a good working lathe, some cheap (but serviceable) tools, and a basic faceplate. Upkeep is pretty simple: don't let anything rust, wipe the exposed bed surface with a thin coat of machine oil occasionally, and make sure the belt isn't cracked or worn threadbare.  What are you planning to turn with this lathe, and what's your budget for additional tools and accessories? I would strongly recommend investing in some better quality entry level tools and possibly a chuck if you plan to do bowls, vases, and that kind of thing."
turning,3a00uz,Mobile_Version,2,Tue Jun 16 13:55:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the informative reply!  I'm not overly surprised to learn that the tools aren't great.  I'm hoping that they will at least let me do some very basic learning without getting too much in the way but I'm also willing to purchase a new set if it just looks like they'll drive me crazy.  Any recommendations on a better set for a beginner would be most welcome!    I hadn't given much thought to accessories beyond buying a face visor and trying to find some wood on which to practice, really.  I have a small handtool workshop that I've been building by finding and restoring older tools so I'm likely good on any additional shaping I need to do before getting it on the lathe.  As for budget, it's often directly proportional to how quickly it'll help me make something for my wife!  For future projects, I want to try a wide variety.  I intend to make a dining table and turning the legs would be a lot of fun, I think.  I'm a fountain pen user and some of the bodies of my pens have gotten unusable and I would love to be able to rebuild new wooden bodies.  Bowls, mallets, whatever.  Working on a lathe has the same tactile enjoyment for me as when I get a hand plane fettled to a good state and take a near perfect shaving with it.    So, it sounds like it might be a good idea to have a look at: - A new set of tools - A face visor - A chuck  Thanks so much for your advice!"

The drawbacks are:  It's more expensive.  But it's a $100 item that replaces a $25 respirator, $10-$20 goggles, and a $20-$30 face shield.  Sure that combination is cheaper, but way less comfortable and difficult to see through, IMHO.  It doesn't have forehead protection.  I took the clear shield part off my old HF face shield and wear it in addition to this mask when I am turning something with cracks or inclusions.  It basically just adds a small band of padded plastic around my forehead to deflect anything that might fly off."

turning,39vn5p,captianinsano,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:26:10 2015 UTC,Ive never tried to do this. Do you ever have issues with cracking or warping or is that part of the fun?
turning,39vn5p,tigermaple,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:43:39 2015 UTC,"Oh they almost always warp, but I personally really like that and, depending on the form it can really add to it and make it more ""lively"" for lack of a better term. For example, These two calabash bowls were both green to done in one step and I think the warping really complements the organic nature of this form.   I might be less likely use a more refined a elegant form such as this one on a piece that's going to warp, but then again, that could be fun to play with too.  In terms of cracking, I'd say I can get around 80% - 90% of my attempts off without cracking. Here, time and heat are your enemies. You have to be fast enough to get it thin enough or it will start to crack, and you have to leave a good enough surface on the outside that you don't have to resort to excessive sanding, as this will cause heat buildup and end checking. (In the album I linked above, you will notice some of this end checking in the second bowl).  I've heard of David Ellsworth wrapping the outsides of his hollow forms in packing tape before he starts hollowing the inside in order to help them retain moisture so that the outside doesn't start cracking as he hollows the inside.  For an extreme example of how fun letting things warp can be, check out the work of Christian Burchard. He works almost exclusively in very green Madrone (the pieces on the page I linked are bleached) and turns it very thin and then lets it warp. I love this kind of work, to me it's so much more interesting than ""brown and round."""
turning,39uyxo,CutBranch,2,Mon Jun 15 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"I pressure steam/boil all my bowls before paper wrapping, then at 10% moisture (2 weeks to a month) they get unwrapped to reach emc state (probably another month sometimes less). i can't finish them as fast as i turn them green so i will have a long dusty winter sanding all these things."

Maybe it's the state (Louisiana) or maybe I've been doing it wrong. Do you mind detailing your procedure, or a link to what you followed?  I'd dearly love to take these green roughs I keep collecting and be able to turn them in say, 3 months, instead of 6-12 that it would normally take (and I store inside a shop with AC, so the air isn't high humidity like outside!)."
turning,39uyxo,Silound,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:11:34 2015 UTC,"Basically i pressure steam them for around an hour in an All American 921 pressure caner, then date and wrap them in newspaper and stuff them in heavy brown paper bags. a few days later they are taken from the bag and left to sit still wrapped in paper until their moisture% is <=10% taken by stabbing through the newsprint. Im in the NYC area and from what i read the average emc is somewhere between 7-11 depending on season. My bowls are stored in a basement where the open wood framing reads around 8-11%.       Unless one has some branch pith, or was cut from too close to the main pith i don't really deal with much cracking. The main thing i try not to do is make the bowls jump from one extreme to another. hope this helps"

Mandrel, pen kit (they have a few fountain pens), way to drill middle of blanks, sanding and finishing products, drill bits. They also have a pen making DVD they will send you free of charge even free shipping (U.S. only). With those tools I imagine you will have to sharpen them often.... disc sander or grinder would be your best bet. If you find you like doing lathe work, and want to move to bowls I would suggest finding a chuck since you will need to buy something anyway and the holding options are greater than just a faceplate."

Most pen tubes have a coat of lacquer on them, sand that off with a coarse grit (~80-120), wipe off the dust with a cloth and methylated spirits, glue and wait the appropriate amount of time - for CA I tend to give it 1-2hours to make sure its hardened properly."

CA, on the other hand, will be fully cured in 30 minutes unless you're using CA with the viscosity of cold molasses.  With CA, I use 60 grit sandpaper to rough the tubes and apply a liberal amount of CA on the tube (and sometimes in the blank if it's an extremely porous wood), give each end a quick zap with accelerator so it's not messy, and let them sit for 30 minutes before I trim and clean them.  Typically I cut, drill, glue, and trim a large number of blanks at a time. Let me tell you, by the time you've glued something like 50 blanks and trimmed them, they've all been sitting there curing for at least 30 minutes, so all of them should be good go.

turning,39ofqk,Sol_Invictus,3,Sat Jun 13 06:22:07 2015 UTC,"Not to be Donny Downer but for $150 you don't have the money to get started. Sorry. Watching all the videos in the world won't help that. ...In fact, go watch a few more and, this time, besides the lathe you see, count up the costs of all the other things you see in the shop that you're gonna have to buy.   Turning doesn't have to be super expensive, but there IS a certain amount of buy-in.   You can go waste your 150 on some CL shit you know nothing about and haven't the experience to evaluate, but that won't get you any closer to making a bowl.  If I GAVE you a working lathe right now, it would still cost you more that $150 for all the other 'stuff' you'd need to finish your first bowl.  The last thing you need is to talk to more people, more beginners like yourself, that don't know shit. What you need to do is follow jclark58's excellent advise and go find a local club.  Not only will you find a group of people who are interested in showing you what you need to know (rather than fucking you to make some sale) but very often members of these clubs have old equipment for sale. Hell, some clubs even have loaner lathes to get newbies started off on.  If you just have to get rid of the $150, send it to me. It'll almost pay for my next sandpaper order."

turning,39ofqk,tigermaple,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh.... different matter entirely.  Even if you want to turn bowls, which is what I turn, I'd suggest you start off with a new lathe even if it has to be a small one.  Many of the things you'll have to learn, learn just as well on a small lathe as a $6,000 one.  I started off on a Jett Mini of some kind; it was long ago. I don't think I paid more, or much more, than $150. Part of the difference is that at least you know you're getting something with all the bits and pieces and that is in working order.  On a used lathe, there's LOTS of gottchas waiting for you... and when you start having a problem with your turning, then you have the additional question of ""is it me or the lathe?"" ...Better just one unknown at a time : )  Anywhooo, I wasn't at all sure I wanted to turn so the Jett Mini was the cheapest way for me to find out.   I joined the local turning club (They also often have buying agreements with some suppliers that allow  you to get your purchases discounted), bought the little lathe, got some weekend help from members and inside a year I bought my $5,000 'forever' lathe.  I wish you good luck."

Serious advice - get your finances in order first, go to some club meetings where you might find out about events such as mentoring sessions and be able to get some time in learning on other people's equipment, and in the meanwhile as you're saving up money, you'll be learning about turning and you'll be more informed about what you need when you do get started.   Also, any link for people that are completly new would be awesome, because I am sure you get a bunch of new people on here. Thanks!

To reiterate what he said, those two lathes that you linked are poorly designed, underpowered pieces of shit that will do nothing but frustrate you and make a steep learning curve that much steeper. Someone would have to pay ME to take either away for disposal! In general, you want to steer clear of any of the tube-type beds in favor of the flat cast iron design. The second one you linked looks like it does not have hollow centers (morse tapers) in the headstock and tailstock which will really frustrate you when you go to find accessories.   What I would recommend with your budget is this Harbor Freight five speed benchtop wood lathe. It's actually well-regarded around here for an HF tool, and it has all the right design elements that will make your life easier - cast iron bed ways to help soak up vibration, a no. 2MT hole in the headstock and tailstock so you can use standard parts, as well as 1"" × 8tpi threads on the spindle nose again so you can use widely available parts such as faceplates and chucks. Find a 20% HF coupon or wait for a sale and you can get it down to $160.00. That's as good as it's gonna get in this price range without waiting around to find the deal of a lifetime on CL."

turning,39mzv4,ctrum69,3,Sat Jun 13 00:07:10 2015 UTC,"After each grit, you need to stop the lathe, and go long way with the paper. Doesn't take long, but work your way all the way around the pen doing that. Your eye won't pick up long ways scratches, and the next grit will take the vast majority of them out.. it WILL pick up scratches around the barrel, though, in a heartbeat.   Sanding long way allows you to work with the grain, which counters harder parts of the grain from ""bouncing"" the paper and leaving high spots and grooves.   Do that all the way up till your final grain. Then take a damp paper towel and wipe down the turning. Let it sit for a bit, till the grain has a chance to rise where it has absorbed water and dry a bit. Then sand through your last two grits again.   That will give you the smoothest finish.   Now, that said, different woods will benefit from different levels of sanding. Something coarser, like a pine, you don't really have to go as high, tighter, oilier tropicals (coco bolo) you can sand almost to glass finish with the higher grits you said you have.   Good luck!"

Next, I cut the end down using a parting tool to make sure it was square. I cut inward a little bit to ensure the hardware would sit flush once installed. After that, I drilled the hole for the metal insert using my drill chuck and a half inch paddle bit. Then, I installed the metal insert by first threading it onto the bottle opener head then screwing it all into the blank with the help of a screwdriver through the opener head.

Larger chunks can sell for much more, whole. This is especially true if they are highly figured/coloured etc. You mentioned this was from a grab bag, so it's not surprising that it's less than stellar."

turning,39iw1i,afly007,2,Fri Jun 12 01:01:32 2015 UTC,I'd go back for more.  if you have a chainsaw and/or bandsaw you can mill the wood into all sorts of useful dimensions for different projects.  I've got shelves full of sizes ranging from pen and bowl blanks to boards and even some slabs.  I love the feeling of needing just the right piece of wood for something and finding it on my shelf ready to go.
turning,39iw1i,wassmatta,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your score! How much storage do you have, because I wouldn't let anything over 6"" in diameter get hauled off if I were in your shoes! I am a bit of a pack mule though...  Anyway, your immediate problem that you need to deal with, like right now is sealing what you have with some end sealer so it can dry out slowly and not split/check/warp too badly. Fresh cut wood will rapidly start to lose moisture from the end grains/burls and start to develop cracks within hours of cutting.  Either seal it, or green turn it. There are tons of guides on that topic available with a Google search.  Anyway, past the seasoning part, I would be out there chopping up as much of that maple as I could possibly seal and store and cackling joyfully as I did it. Maple is a joy to turn and for someone wanting to get more into bowl turning, this is your lucky day and I'd make the most of it I possibly could.

turning,39iw1i,Silound,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:51:40 2015 UTC,Great suggestions!  I'll definitely go back for more today.  Any suggestions on some DIY sealer?  I don't really have a local source of anchor seal and from what I hear it can get expensive.   I've read about melting candles and dealing with the wax. What about regular latex paint?
turning,39iw1i,Silound,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:12:13 2015 UTC,"I buy Anchor Seal because it's widely considered the best option and costs about the same as DIY options, so I can't really comment on many DIY means. Its also only about $100 for a 5-gallon bucket, which will last a good long while!  AS2 is a wax emulsion sealer, so I presume if you Google around you can find plenty of people inventing their own sealers.  I have used wax, spray paint, and latex paint before to seal small things like pen blanks, but those don't require much sealing since they have a relatively large surface area to thickness ratio and will lose adequate moisture from the sides. Wax tends to not stick as well without some thinning agent, the paints seem to work partially. They obviously slow the moisture loss, but small checking still happens."

turning,39h315,Mikedealer,3,Thu Jun 11 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, walnut probably is the number one answer to the question you're asking.   The biggest issue is actually the fact that there aren't that many dark colored domestic woods like walnut: black ash, black cherry, some elms, some oaks, and tupelo all can range from a light brown to a darker or reddish brown, but I can't think of another domestic off the top of my head that has the dark chocolate browns of walnut.  If these are for food use, you don't want to use a stain on them, so that leaves you with imported woods, which are more expensive than domestic woods by a pretty large margin.  If you can up your price to afford imports, then cocobolo, macassar ebony, wenge (my favorite), and mahogany are all excellent dark woods that make nice pieces. Be prepared to pay upwards of $20 for a small or wet blank and up to $100 for a larger or dried blank for many of these woods though!"

turning,39h315,Silound,2,Thu Jun 11 19:02:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah, walnut tends to fade to a duller gray/brown color with age.  If you saturate it well with mineral oil (you're going to put coats of that on anyway to seal it for food use) and use a beeswax & mineral oil finish on the bowls after the wood is saturated, that will help it keep the darker color a bit longer due to retaining the ""wet"" appearance from the oil."

All of those sources have yielded a number of nice, high quality blanks, for reasonable prices. GotWood especially lately has put a lot of maple and holly in their clearance bin, much of which has been very nice pieces. I'm a sucker for holly because you can turn it damn near translucent thin.  Recently I've been able to score 4-10"" diameter/square blanks ranging from 3-5"" thick for prices ranging from $1-15. Many on eBay, some on Etsy, most by just happening across the sale section on one of those sites and finding a good deal.  We're not talking top-notch burls or insanely figured pieces, but just about everything I've gotten has had some character that makes it a nice piece to turn into something.

If that were the case, I would buy a gallon or two of sealer and chop them down to individual blanks to be turned and re-seal the end-grain on them to start with. That would accelerate the drying process because it exposes more surface area to release moisture.  Then you can weigh the smaller blanks on a food scale every 2-4 weeks and watch them lose weight from moisture. Probably at around 6/9/12 months I would pick one, produce a finished product, and wait a couple weeks to see how badly it moves.   Depending on your moisture content where you live, you could start turning them at 6 months or you may have to wait a whole year."

turning,393s6t,o-ffset,7,Tue Jun 9 01:31:01 2015 UTC,"Wall of text incoming, sorry! Trying to answer all your questions.   So I have a lathe and general tools/chisels. I turned wood back in Jr high. There is a local lumber yard, but I don't know what to buy.   Just about any wood can be turned, although they turn with varying degrees of success based on their unique properties and the sharpness of your tools (that's another discussion). Some woods are good for learning the basics of the tools and techniques (pine & fir since they are somewhat soft and very forgiving), some are well suited for spindles and shafts (oak & poplar), and yet others are good for almost anything (maple, cherry, walnut). Any of those woods can be used for a variety of projects, but many people find woods like oak are not as good for bowls and such due to the large open end grain which is harder to finish and seal.   Is it possible to buy wood and turn some bowls, cups or plates for use this weekend?   You have a yard, so there should be a supply of something turnable, but it may not be in the dimensions you need. Gluing of boards to make a bowl blank takes time (24+ hours for the glue to set and cure properly), so you would need a slab that is already thick enough to use.  You have a lathe, but you may not have the right type of tools to turn those sorts of projects. For those you would need what's known as a bowl gouge (and it needs to be sharp enough to use) and possibly a scraper. You would also need a faceplate, mounting screw, or chuck for holding the work without the tailstock to hollow/shape the insides.  Feel free to post pictures of your tools/setup if you're unsure about that!  You will also need something food safe to finish them with. Mineral oil is fine for solid foods, but not so great for drinking vessels. Shellac seems to be the common preferred finish for drinking vessels. Be warned, food safe finishes typically need quite a few coats and time to seal well.  The other thing that comes into play is mostly experience. It's a process, and like most crafting processes, it has a learning curve to overcome. If you had enough time and materials to practice a bit, you can do it! There are literally tons of YouTube videos that detail nearly every possible aspect about turning bowls.   What is seasoning? What is green?   Green wood is fresh wood that still has a high moisture content. Seasoning is the process of taking that green wet wood and drying it, either by artificial means, or by simply letting it sit over time until the amount of moisture left in the wood goes way down. Think of leaves: green leaves are moist, but after they get picked, they slowly dry out and change shape. Wood does the exact same thing.   How long does something have to sit after turning? Does it even need to sit?   That depends on your material. Some people choose to turn green wood, but as wood dries, it cracks and moves (checking and warping) and so your bowl will crack and warp too! If the wood comes kiln dried (common for wood suppliers, but ask!) then you can turn it and it shouldn't crack. It will move slightly out of perfect round, but it's unlikely you will notice it.   What kind of wood would offer an easy enough turning experience? What wood should I avoid?   I listed a few woods above, but for food dishes and bowls, I would avoid oak mostly. The open grain can harbor bacteria and make it difficult to clean if it is not finished properly. Maple and cherry are good woods for food use because they are hard but easily worked and have tight grain that's easy to saturate with finish.   For bowls, do I turn the bottom first then the top? How deep do you go with screws? For bowls I'm thinking 6-8"" round and 2-3"" deep. Plates I'm thinking 8-9"" and thin enough, but not insane. Cups I'm thinking hand sized.   Most people do the outside of the bowl first and then remount to do the inside. It's more stable than the other way around, and it makes it easier to gauge the wall thickness while you turn.  Screws need to be deep enough to hold the work piece against the forces involved. I haven't used screws in years, but when turning the outside first, I would get a good 1-1.5"" penetration into the blank (it's waste material that will be hollowed anyway) to make sure it's secure while you round it out and curve the outside. Then when you screw into the bottom, you need at least 3/4"" penetration WITH the tailstock to support the piece while you hollow it out (think a bowl with a center post that supports the turning while you remove the bulk of the material so it's lighter).  Also, remember that whatever your desired final dimensions are, add about an inch for shaping, sanding, and mounting. So an 8"" diameter 3"" deep bowl will need to start with roughly a 9""x9"" block 4"" thick. You will lose about 1/2"" on all sides rounding and shaping the bowl, and then for 3"" depth you will need anywhere from 1/2"" to 3/4"" of material for the bottom of the bowl curve, the foot, and mounting waste. This is where jaw chucks are the reigning king...the chuck holds the foot of the bowl so there's no screws and screw holes to deal with!"

These dishes would be for a weekend festival, so they more rustic looking the better. Perfect excuse to not be perfect!  I could always add an inch or so on the bottom of the final turn and screw to that, then cut it off right? It is what I would do if I had jaws to clamp a piece...  Cool! Can't wait to give it a go! Thanks for the answers!"
turning,393s6t,DavidPx,3,Tue Jun 9 04:35:33 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend reading a few turning books as you start out.  If your library doesn't have anything then I'd recommend two of Richard Raffan's books, Turning Wood and Turning Bowls.  Coupling that with YouTube you can learn a great deal!"

turning,393s6t,Gwydion,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"I could always add an inch or so on the bottom of the final turn and screw to that, then cut it off right?    Yup! That's what most of us probably did when we were first starting.  If you have some superglue, you could also glue a flat 1"" thick piece of waste block to the bottom by cutting a tenon an a mortise in the bottom of the bowl. That would prevent you from needing more vessel material that would get wasted."

turning,393s6t,tigermaple,2,Tue Jun 9 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"This was a great post. Something like this should be linked to on the sidebar. Can you give recommendations on a bowl gouge and a bowl chuck? Not sure if it matters, but I have a harbor freight cheap lathe. Are they all universally fit?   As far as chucks go, it depends on the threads on your lathe spindle, but there are spindle adapters that will take you up/down to fit the chuck. Penn State Industries sells quite a variety of them.  Chucks come in so many varieties, it would be hard to list them all and their pros/cons, but this video is an excellent beginner's guide.  You can spend anywhere from $50 all the way up to $400 on a chuck, and even more than that for a variety of accessory jaws and attachments. Some of the more expensive chucks just come with more accessories (like jaws and thread adapters) as part of the kit, so pay attention to them because they might be a better deal.  Personally, I'd say for entry level learning the basics, a Nova G3 is probably the best bang for the buck at around $150 (someone had a sale recently, $100 for the G3). The base dovetail jaws that are included are enough to turn a large variety of things, and that particular model can use most (if not all) of Nova's different jaw/accessory options, leaving you lots of room to expand later into other projects.  As far as a good bowl gouge, well, everyone likes different tools for different reasons, but most people will tell you one is enough to start with (more later though!). Your only two real options for a bowl gouge are powder metallurgy or High Speed Steel. Some people will argue back and forth which one is better, but in my opinion in the end if you can keep them sharp, they both work quite well.   Your personal budget will probably determine which direction you go:    HSS tools are usually cheaper to buy, but they are more delicate to sharpen; you can overheat them, ruining the temper of the steel and its ability to hold an edge. PM tools are more expensive, but easy to sharpen with a CBN (cubic boron nitride) wheel on your regular bench grinder with minimal worry of overheating.   Edit to add: This Hurricane bowl gouge is a great starter tool. I had the chance to try some Hurricane tools and found them to be excellent entry level HSS tools. You'll have to find a way to keep it sharp though!"

Give this man a cigar (pen)!  I've tried bartering for wood before, and it's plausible if you're bartering with a person near enough to meet in person, but when you're talking about shipping 90lbs of turning blanks to Nevada from Florida, that gets expensive fast. The exception to that is if we're talking small things like pen blanks, which can fit in a USPS flat rate box.  What's really disappointing is that there is no value to be had in bulk purchasing lumber like for group buys. Whatever small amount is saved in the purchase price will most certainly be destroyed by the shipping costs."

turning,38lzer,nessgreen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"i sure can try! a mirror system in kaleidoscopes can be made any number of ways, with all types of angles, and multiple sides involved!  changing  the dimensions/proportions involved will change the magnification of the image you are trying to create, and improper alignment or cutting will give you an incomplete reflection ( think 6.5 point star instead of 6)  the most common mirror system and the one in use in this scope is a two mirror, isosceles triangle. The two longer legs are mirror with the third side black, which creates the rounded central image. The angle at the top of the triangle where the mirrors meet is what determines the amount of points in the reflection. Essentially you are looking through a triangular tube of mirrors. When you look into this tube, random bits of glass fall across the front to create the pattern. In looking at the image, you can see it is made up of several repeating ""wedges"" of the same image.   The triangular tube creates a ""wedge"" window so that whatever falls in front of it is reflected in that wedge around it's self to create the image. The amount of times it reflects can be changed by making the top angle of the isosceles larger or smaller, the larger the opening, the less ""wedges"" or points in the reflection!   The Brewster Society (a wonderful group of kaleidoscope enthusiasts!) has quite a lot of information under their ""FAQ"" page and this section on mirrors might shed a bit more light. https://brewstersociety.com/kaleidoscope-university/kaleidoscopic-image/  also if you're bored more kaleida-construction and history: http://www.virtualimage.co.uk/SCIENAR/html/kaleidoscopes.html http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Kaleidoscope.html     also a video inside one of my fancier scopes, a 12 point with glass floating in oil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouJMi6fJF7g"

If you do not have access to recycled wax at home, try hitting a few yard sales over the summer, my wife can usually find a trunk load of candles for a nickle to a quarter each from the local yard sales.   If you have to buy wax from a candle supply store its not worth it to DIY, it takes your cost up to $15 a gallon and its not worth the work to make it vs. just buying anchorseal 2"

turning,38gkak,tigermaple,2,Thu Jun 4 05:41:32 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with Bruce here except it's not a bedan- a bedan would be pretty much square with the sides tapering to the bottom. What you've got there is just a scraper that could be used as is as a square scraper or ground in to whatever other shape you might need such as this or this asymmetrical curve that is real handy for a light final pass on the insides of bowls to get rid of little bumps and ridges.  I'd suggest this video that is called The Skew Chisel with Allan Batty but he goes over all the spindle tools, not just the skew.  This article on preparing a new skew goes in to how putting a radiused edge on the skew makes it a lot less grabby and more useful.  Finally, a note of caution- several of these gouges are the old ""continental style"" gouge forged out of flat stock with a little tang- they are not safe for use on bowls or other projects where the grain is oriented perpendicular to the bed of the lathe (what we commonly refer to as ""side grain"" or ""faceplate"" turning).

Just get yourself the Wolverine jig and varigrind holder, watch this 90 minute AAW video on sharpening and you'll be golden.  Even though that looks like it might be a 6"" high-speed one, where 8"" low speed is preferred, it'll still work just fine.

turning,38ftdx,rbaile28,3,Wed Jun 3 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"The nut being in the way is a common problem with DIY tools. That's why most of the commercial ones are drilled and tapped with threads. If you're using square tube stock, you might try placing a small nut inside of the hollow stock.  If you have one, I would suggest giving the round cutter a try and seeing if you have better results. Square cutters have a large flat cutting surface, which is perfect for catching the length of the grain and causing binds.   Also, make sure your nut is keeping the bushings tight against the blanks. Many people use the flat of a scraper or skew to turn down pen blanks, so there should be more than enough friction there to hold everything in place."

If your between centers dont press into the blank i find quick shallow passes are best to get it round.   I have only been making pens with my 10x18 mini lathe from hb and the easy woods roughing carbide tool. I really like how quick and way carbide is.  Carbide likes to be around middle of the blank when cutting. I have found that the 2000rpm setting on my lathe produced great cuts on wood and acrylic with the carbide. I have also been leaving a space about the size of the cutter between my tool rest and work piece.   I hope this helps i have been thinking of diy carbide for the round and detailer but since i can do everything i want with the square one now i haven't commited.
turning,38bmgu,Codingo,3,Wed Jun 3 04:09:20 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I have not made any of these, but from videos I have seen, what I suspect he is doing is simply foregoing the glued in tubes, drilling and turning the materials on bushings, then threading them by hand or with a threading machine of some sort.

If you put a partial 7mm hole in you blank (not all the way through) then turn it to shape you can fit the nib holder in once its finished, a little touch of epoxy to settle it in and you have a mapping pen/dipping pen that you can change nibs on to get different style.  I think the most difficult part is the closed end aspect of the turning, not being able to run a pen mandrel all the way through means you have to figure out how to chuck it up, still experimenting with that."

PR is not good because it doesn't thread very well.  alumalite is better and there are other commercial ones that are lots better.  I have never made any personally but ive read a bit about them and other than threading and being very accurate with your turning its just a bunch of pieces that eventually fit together to make a whole.  edit:  here is a library tutorial from IAP http://content.penturners.org/library/pens/kitless_pen.pdf

turning,384kng,gingeraffe1311,4,Mon Jun 1 20:27:46 2015 UTC,"So the first thing I would suggest doing is deciding what you want to make, and what your price range is. If you only wanna make small things like pens you can get a lathe with a very small swing (the space between the top of the bed, and the spindle) if you want to make bigger things like bowls and platters you're gonna want something with a bigger swing. As many of us have found out you might think you only want to do small things but quickly decide to branch out. You should check that nothing in super rusty or if it is be prepared to clean it. Make sure the headstock and the tailstock line up perfectly or else nothing you turn will be quite true. Make sure that it turns at a low enough speed. Many people will tell you that anything over 900 as a starting speed is to high. My lathe starts around 960 and works great. Also consider a way to sharpen your tools. I suggest the rikon slow speed grinder and wolverine jig from woodcraft which can be had for about 250. Also look into a good face shield. That's about all I can think of. Let me know if you have any questions:)."

turning,384kng,ctrum69,2,Mon Jun 1 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"Big question: What is your budget for a lathe, safety equipment, and tools? That might help someone point you in a good direction to get started.  As to your original question, the major consideration when buying a used lathe is its condition.   As with any tool, avoid it if you see the classic signs of abuse or misuse: bad rust, missing or damaged pieces, homemade/non-factory kludge repairs like welds that signal something was broken and repaired. If you cannot stand and watch the tool run, I would not purchase it unless it was still under MFG warranty. When powered on, it should immediately overcome the inertia and magnets and begin to spin, coming up to the set speed quickly and smoothly. The tailstock and tool rest should slide easily on the lathe bed without any excess wobble or scraping. The tailstock should extend and retract cleanly. The headstock shaft should not wobble under any circumstances. If it does, that's a sign of bad bearings, which might be a costly or difficult replacement."

Harbor Freight 5-speed, $199.00  Rikon mini lathe $399.00  No experience with the Harbor Freight, but it's generally well regarded as being decent for the money, a hidden gem of HF if you will.   I have the Rikon and it's been great, a solid performer for 6+years now. (I upgraded to a bigger lathe but kept it and it still gets some use like when a friend came over this weekend to start learning).  The used market's been rough lately from what I've seen helping people look. Lots of crap for way too much out there, and the good buys go real quick. That being said, I've got some free time tonight so let us know where you're at and I'll help you look.  You'll need a bench grinder too unless you already have one, and likely something like the Wolverine jig to go with it."
turning,384kng,ctrum69,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:19:08 2015 UTC,"The HF is.. ehh. It's sloppy, you'll want to immediately replace the dead center in the tailstock with a good one from somewhere else. Buy extra belts, they eat them.   Honestly, having had HF lathes.. hunt around on CL, or hit your local Woodcraft (or other) turning group.. someone has outgrown their lathe (a good one, like a jet, nova, rikon) and is willing to sell the old one.   As to the need fora bench grinder.. if you have a belt sanding setup already, you can do a lot of what you can do on a grinder with belts/discs."
turning,384kng,LubricatorHex,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"That was not my experience at all with the HF 5 speed mini lathe, perhaps you are talking about a different one.  I used mine heavily for 2 years and never needed to replace the belt.  Also it didn't come with a dead center for the tail stock, but it did come with a live center which was just fine, never even considered replacing it.  The only upgrades I did were to buy a decent chuck (in my case a Nova midi which I kept when I upgraded to a Nova 1624) and to bolt it to a bench with lots of weight because they are so light.  For a $160 (with coupon) lathe, it is great.  Much better than most of the crappy old craftsman lathes you'll find on craigslist.   Best of all, I used it for 2 years to learn (and make many mistakes!) on and sold it to someone else for $120."

turning,384kng,Silound,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:27:16 2015 UTC,"Well I took a quick peek and I'm afraid your CL is a wasteland right now... a couple Jet 1236's that people want $500 and $700 for (I'd pay about $300 tops for one of those used), an old Rockwell worth about $150 that someone wants ""$300 firm"" for and it goes downhill from there.  The other thing I can think of in terms of used is to check for a club in your area using the AAW chapter finder (Just put in United States / North Carolina and all 8 or so in the state will come up. This Colorado guy isn't too familiar with NC geography so I have no idea which ones are close to you). It's worth checking with a couple of the nearby ones to see if they have a classifieds or something - a lot of times the best used deals are sold amongst club members before they even hit CL."

turning,380i85,Silound,2,Mon Jun 1 00:34:57 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you're saying this because the CA glue won't stick to the latex? I have some gloves already and the CA glue sticks to them (and gets VERY hot when it does)... Maybe they're not latex.
turning,380i85,Silound,3,Mon Jun 1 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"I simply recommended gloves as a way to prevent getting it on your fingers, not latex in particular. a carved up milk jug also works when you're wiping on a CA finish as something to hold the paper towel and keep your fingers clean.  CA will stick to just about any surface that's not oily. Luckily, the ketone acetone found in nail polish remover will work as a solvent. Your own natural skin oils will separate it from the surface layer of skin after a day or two, and it's easy to grind off with some lava soap.  Heat is a by-product of the curing of CA; part of the curing process ""cracks"" some molecular bonds, releasing heat. It's more noticeable on natural fibers like cotton which for some reason accelerate the curing process. There's no real way to avoid that."

turning,37qj1f,Conley-,2,Fri May 29 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"Here's my walkthrough or acrylics. The one thing that varies is I occasionally drill the blanks on the lathe in a chuck, depending on how horrible the bit and blank are.   http://imgur.com/a/m2tlE  For wood.. I sand really high, wet the grain, resand high, wipe with mineral spirits, then apply multiple coats of CA glue sand that back  to hopefully fill and smooth the pores in the wood, some more CA glue laid over the whole thing, then sand and finish just like acrylic (Because you have basically created an acrylic coating on the wood).   SOme woods, (much denser, darker woods) will do okay with just the sanding and polishing, like coco bolo, african blackwood, and some purpleheart I had that was particularly tight grained.. then I just hit it with a friction polish and a coat of wax.. but again, get the wood as polished and shiny as you can, BEFORE you put any finish on it.. the final product will look better.   Also, I rarely turn 7mm tube pens anymore, because they are such a pain in the ass to get off the mandrel. If the bushing spins on the mandrel at any point under load, it can groove the mandrel, and create a corresponding ridge, which makes the tubes hang up and stick. You can put the mandrel, empty, in the lathe, and lightly run the tail stock up (don't use enough pressure to bend the mandrel) and polish it up with scotchbrite, or, if the grooves are significant, a metal graded sandpaper, then wax it. That might help with the tubes sticking on it.   As to tools.. my turning area is a U. with my ""good"" lathe along one side, at the foot of that is a rolling cart with drawers and a wood top that has my box with all my bushings sorted in, my finishing supplies, and whatever tools I'm currently using. The other side of the U is my HF lathe, which is now A) a polishing station with a three buff setup on it (white, tripoli, carnauba) and which also works as a perfect platform for my Jet pen lathe when I use it. (which isn't often). Behind my ""good"" lathe is a shelf that has tool racks on it for all the REST of the crap I seldom use, with a piece of pegboard hung above it, with hooks for my mask, face shield, faceplates, calipers, saw blades, tape, etc."
turning,37qj1f,ctrum69,1 point,Fri May 29 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"OH! One other thing.. if you are going to work with light colored woods.. like maple, you might want to take some scrap tube, and make some sacrificial bushings out of wood. (Basically, drill and glue some short bits of wood on tubes, then turn them to the profile of whatever bushings you are using for you pens.. this is more for the thicker pens), and then use those when sanding and finishing.. because the first time you sand across those metal bushings, you are going to have black grimy flecks in your nice, white wood, that you won't ever get out. It's annoying as hell."

turning,37qj1f,Silound,1 point,Sat May 30 16:18:52 2015 UTC,Very cool. Thanks for the info!
turning,37qj1f,ctrum69,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:09:15 2015 UTC,"Make sure the glue is fully cured before you ream and put them on the mandrel. Accelerator will help, but just leaving the blanks to sit for 15 minutes before reaming and trimming them will solve most problems. Also there are different sized mandrels for larger/smaller tubes, so make sure you do have the right mandrel for your project.  Edit to add: You can buy 10-packs of extra tubes for like $2-3. Personally, I probably turn 2 blanks for every pen I assemble because I'm not satisfied with my results. Good way to get some practice with pens is to buy a crapton of tubes and a large supply of cheap blanks (eBay is probably the best place for cheap blanks!) and just turn, turn, turn! Eventually you'll make one you really like and want to assemble it. Carbide tools cut two different ways: shear and scrape. Laying the tool flat and inserting the carbide tip into the material will scrape, and can leave grain tear-out and rough edges. Learning to use the edge of the carbide to make a shearing cut will produce a much smoother cut result, which takes less sanding.     Speaking of sanding, make sure between grits (I sand 220->320->400->600 before applying my finish, then 1000 up to 12000 after the finish with micro mesh pads) that you stop the lathe and sand end to end on the blank. This helps remove any sanding rings created by the lathe spinning. Using a flat piece of wood for a firm edge also helps keep blanks from sanding out of true.    Finish by application of your choice of products, although most people prefer CA glue finishes for pens due to the durability and easy of creating a lustrous shine. I've never used Crystal Coat, so I can't help there. I did use the HUT PPP bars years ago before CA was a popular finish, and they worked fairly well, but they do get funky after a few years.  There are many YouTube videos that detail all of the above, I can't stress enough how awesome YouTube is for learning! Acrylic will chip and shatter if you try and take too heavy of a cut, so make sure you're taking thin cuts. Also, I generally make pens in batches. Drill a dozen blanks, glue them all, trim them all, then turn/finish them one by one. It creates a sort of process that's orderly and if one blank has an issue, I toss it and start another quickly. Once you're comfortable with the process, you should be able to drill, glue, and trim about 30 blanks an hour without rushing yourself. If you want to use a Jacobs chuck (drill chuck) in your lathe to drill blanks, the common way is to mount it in the tailstock and mount the blanks into a grip chuck on the headstock. This turns the blank on center and you simply crank the tailstock to extend it and drill through the blank. Chucks are also useful if you want to try some bowl turning or other projects that require a mounted blank, so they're 100% a worthy investment!  If you don't want to go buy a chuck and the jaws needed to hold a pen blank, I'd suggest using the standard method of a drill press. If you don't have one of those, they're only about $70 at HF for a cheapo that will get the job done. You could try making your own custom jig for the lathe, just remember the goal is to keep everything square and aligned while one part is turning.   I really can't stress YouTube enough as a valuable source of information!  And don't sweat the production time. I found that as I did more and more pens, my time per pen went way down, and then started to creep back up again. I think I sit at about 20 minutes per pen now.  Any specific questions you have, by all means ask away! If you lived anywhere near me, I'd offer to help in person =/"

Turn outside shape of bowl with rim towards headstock end, foot towards tailstock. Turn a tenon on the foot much like you would in preparation for a chuck, except this one will be straight, not dovetailed.    Remove bowl from faceplate, attach waste block. Cut mortise in waste block to tightly fit tenon. Sneak up on the fit with light scraping/cutting checking often.    Once the fit is good, glue the bowl in with superglue, hollow the inside.    Part from waste block and reverse turn to remove the tenon and shape a nice foot. (You could reshape the same block you just used in to a jam chuck)   Is that it more or less or are there any other tips or things you do differently?"
turning,37oppb,Silound,3,Fri May 29 13:42:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty close. I was trying to find a picture of it, but I wasn't having much luck, so here's a scan out of a magazine:  Method  I differ from the method slightly though:   I use wood glue, not CA. Wood glue bonds stronger for this style of mounting. I turn a longer foot with a deeper mortise, and my tenon only goes about 2/3 of the way into the mortise (so that the finished bottom is not scarred). After turning the inside of the bowl, I use a parting tool to cut through the extended foot and part it from the waste block so that the foot is shallow.   I used this method since all of my bowls were finished in mineral oil for use, and you can just wipe that on (no need for turning the bowl like a friction finish)."
turning,37oppb,tigermaple,2,Fri May 29 13:54:17 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks! That makes total sense, as fitting a tenon to a mortise is much easier than the other way around. I'll have to give this a try sometime since I'll be teaching a beginner soon that won't be able to buy a chuck right away and I also like the idea of not having to reverse turn with an eye toward getting a production line going.  I also finish off the lathe, never got into the obsession with friction polishes either. My favorite food safe finish so far is the Tried and True Danish Oil, which is another misnamed finishing product since it's just pure linseed oil with no added mineral spirits or heavy metal driers like harward store BLO."
turning,37oppb,Silound,2,Fri May 29 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"Some extra thoughts towards that, now that I contemplate on it:   Waste blocks are reusable for progressively smaller bowls. Just scrape off material far enough to go past the previous glue level for a slightly narrower tenon, and it can be used for another, smaller bowl. Never try to re-use for the same size tenon though, as the glue will not adhere as well. 2x6/2x8 framing lumber makes for a good source of free waste blocks. I visited a handful of homes being built and asked if I could have the angled cutoff waste from the rafters/ceiling joists, and walked away with a few dozen from each home. Two pieces of cutoff sanded, glued together, and trimmed on a bandsaw makes a good waste block. Most people only start with one faceplate (I had two, but that's still a far cry from what I have now) and switching project blanks is a pain. If you pre-drill the mounting holes in the waste blocks and use the fattest hex-head screws you can fit through the holes on your faceplate, that makes it super easy to use a cordless drill to mount/dismount the faceplate from waste blocks quickly."

Another thing to keep in mind is that if anything you are making is ultimately successful and noticed by the right people, you might wind up in a gallery, and a good gallery's cut of the action can range from 33 - 50%, so you've got to ask yourself, if you'd still be happy getting just $40 for that bowl you just sold for $75 and perhaps increase your prices accordingly.  Based on the above, and observing what work of similar, lesser, and greater quality than mine goes for, I've arrived at price points of around $125 - $175 for smaller bowls (8"" or less), and $150 - $300 on up for medium (8"" - 12""), depending on wood, surface treatment (i.e. carving or painting or figured wood increases the amount).   Don't underprice your work! If you don't think it's valuable, no one else will. Granted, I have not yet sold a lot, but I've sold a few of my 8"" tiger maple bowls for between $200 & $250 and several ladles for $75.

Everyone (more or less) turns differently, and has ""favorites"". Lacer will use a skew for things I find to be insane, raffan does so much with a fingernail gouge it makes my head spin, etc.   There's no point in arguing over what works for you. Just use it, enjoy it, make shavings, and make art.   I think most of the people who claim the superiority of  carbide don't know how (or don't like to) sharpen tools. I know when my skew is touched up, I can get a cut that rivals any carbide tool I've ever handled. For production work, where a sharp cutter with the turn of an allen wrench is worth the expense of the cutters, they make total sense."

For me, most of the time I prefer the cut and experience of HSS tools and with a jig, sharpening is a 30s affair. While HSS might be a little slower, I enjoy the turning experience more with it (nicer shavings that don't clog up right in front of me), and find the cut quality means I can start at a much higher grit than with carbide.  If I'm roughing out a spindle or outside of a bowl - particularly jarrah - I much prefer carbide because its fast. Cutting tenons (or mortises) for either a bowl, or tenon for a craft kit (ie, where the ferrule goes)? Carbide every single time, the square cutter makes it so easy to get a flat surface.

Even when the tools are bolted to the sled body, it introduces too much vibration.  The best solution I've seen was what Delta did on large saws back in the 80's and 90's. One end had large locking casters, the other end had legs. To move the tool, a lift lever with casters was inserted into points on the lower frame and pushed down, which picked up the dead end and allowed the saw to be re-positioned.  These days, I see quite a few solidly built wooden sled-frames with push-down retractable casters on each corner. I suspect that would also do the job pretty well."

They seem like an elegant solution.

turning,37cr0l,gradyh,3,Tue May 26 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"Like /u/jwatson1978 said, a lathe needs to be hefty because the spinning anything just a bit off balance will cause vibrations. Almost all quality lathes have cast iron beds for this reason. They do okay for spindle work, and I used mine to make several bowls but it was very slow going. In general they are just older mass-produced low-quality tools. I don't think anyone makes this style anymore."
turning,37cr0l,tigermaple,1 point,Tue May 26 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"In addition to all this, isn't the alignment between the spur center and the live center points a potential issue as well? (I've never played around with a monotube but it doesn't look like there's anything to keep these aligned like on the flat cast iron ways design)."
turning,37cr0l,gradyh,3,Tue May 26 23:02:21 2015 UTC,Actually mine had a rail along the bottom of the tube that did a pretty good job keeping things aligned. Not sure if they all have that.

I trust that it works well though, all his equipment is in wonderful shape."
turning,37ek96,Braydawg7,3,Wed May 27 01:30:03 2015 UTC,I've always been told to never wear gloves near a lathe.
turning,37ek96,Evian_Drinker,2,Wed May 27 11:50:12 2015 UTC,"I never do, this was an exception because turning the screw out was producing hot metal shavings that were burning my arm and hand, so I used it to deflect them. You'll notice that I don't have it on before i get to the screw and take it off once I'm past it."
turning,37ek96,jclark58,2,Wed May 27 16:51:52 2015 UTC,"I like the rim treatment and the finished piece but have a couple of suggestions.   When roughing out the outside of the bowl you should have your tailstock in place.   After flipping the bowl around to put it in the chuck and seeing it off center you should true up the outside. Not trueing it up led to some unevenness on the rim of your bowl.   I saw far too many cuts going against the grain (rim to foot on the outside and center up to the rim on the inside). Wood has grain that wants to be cut in the proper direction, going against the grain is hard on you, hard on your tools, and even hard on the wood leading to tear out."

They range from easier to a pen to quite a bit more advanced. You can do anything from yo-yo's to salt and pepper grinders, to duck calls and perfume atomizers. These kits are an easy first step from pen turning as many involve the same processes equipment. If you are looking to move away from the ""kit"" realm, perhaps try turning some Tops, small dishes/bowls, or a box (these may be a bit challenging but the reward when you first make one is very rewarding.

Specifically, in this section featuring John Jordan, he talks about a good shape for a side-grind (i.e. Ellsworth/Irish) bowl gouge then shows how with a new gouge (or one that's gotten too far out of whack), you can turn it upside down on the grinder and grind down the top of the wings first. This then gives you a nice visual of where you have to take metal off from there regardless of whether you are freehanding or using a jig."

In case you aren't in to the Irish/Ellsworth grind, this shows another approach using the platform that gives you a little bit of a different shape. I sharpen my spindle and detail gouges this way, but you can also do it to a bowl gouge, using a less steep angle on the platform. (On a bowl gouge, it's sometimes called the Stuart Batty grind and it works really well for the ""push-cut only"" style of turning he's a big proponent of but I don't find it as versatile as the Ellsworth grind)."

I think I kinda got to freehand grinding one that I had buggered up so bad I no longer cared if I destroyed the tool or not, and have it pretty close to what I want, so now I can use that to set up the jig, and try that.   Once I have one point of reference to work from, I can get the rest.

turning,371wmk,LakeoftheDead,2,Sun May 24 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"Your wall thickness looks relatively consistent, might be a little thicker on the bottom than the rest, but not enough that it would be the cause. Where are you located? A lot depends on the relative humidity of your local environment. Here in Colorado for example, I'd have similar results if I tried to dry rough turned bowls with the paper bag method, it just won't slow down the moisture loss enough for how dry it is here. I have to coat mine completely (not just the end grain) with green wood end sealer in order to dry them successfully. I also coat any blanks completely before turning them if I'm not going to get to them for a while."

turning,371wmk,tigermaple,2,Sun May 24 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"Nope, nothing short of encasing something in epoxy or something like that is going to prevent moisture loss entirely, it just slows it down a bit more than the paper bag method.

(I started to take some, then got in to ""fuck it, get 'er done"" mode). If there's any interest, I'll make a complete build along/how to one of these times since I plan on rehandling a lot more of my tools.  I do have this sequence about how easy it is to pop off the handles they come in. Most of these aren't even glued in by the manufacturer, it's just a tight pressure fit, so if you clamp them in a metalworking vice and hold a 2x4 against the ferrule, a few sharp blows with a hammer on the other end of the 2x4 will pop them right off."
turning,36zx4w,minotaurohomunculus,2,Sat May 23 15:58:11 2015 UTC,Real nice. How did you dye and finish them?
turning,36zx4w,minotaurohomunculus,2,Sat May 23 16:09:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The dye job was done with the Transtint water soluble dyes.      Sand through the grits up to 220. I sanded with the lathe running, but then after each grit, stop the lathe and sand along the length to remove the radial scratch pattern.    Apply a coat of the black dye. Let dry (this takes only about 20 minutes or less if you speed things along with the lathe running and/or air compressor blowing it dry).     Sand most of the black dye back to bare wood, then apply whatever color you'd like over it. This really ""pops the grain"" because the partially sanded back black dye accentuates the curl pattern.    Apply whatever topcoat you prefer (probably nothing too slick for a gouge handle). Here I used three coats of the Sam Maloof Oil/Poly blend. Buff with 0000 steel wool or white non-woven pads between coats."
turning,36zx4w,ctrum69,1 point,Sat May 23 16:19:53 2015 UTC,Thanks. You just mix those with water and apply?  Really cool.
turning,36zx4w,vangoedenaam,2,Sat May 23 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, they come in little bottles of 2oz concentrate and you just mix it up (2oz- 2 qts water, so I usually do a 1/8 oz - 8oz batch) and apply with a paper towel. Once it is mixed it doesn't come out of solution so one of these bottles will last practically a lifetime in terms of turning projects. Being water based, the first coat will raise the grain, but sanding back between coats and colors will take care of that. There's all kinds of things you can try with these. I've layered blue over green like in the colored box in this pic, and this box is the result of a more subtle dye combination."

turning,36z5hc,fixed_1978,3,Sat May 23 10:28:26 2015 UTC,"N.B.  I'm not a spindle turner. Nothing I say here has anything to do with that except perhaps by happy coincidence.  They sell some different fixtures/guages/widgets to supposedly enable you to measure the angle of the grind. Have no idea if they work or not; never used one. Trying to eyeball a 1 degree difference in lines less that a quarter inch of length was never my strong point.  Some grinds in some situations will be 'more' grabby or even impossibly grabby ... but most grabbing is a matter of technique and tip control. ....So time and experience is your biggest friend there.  What you need to do:  Get yourself one grind setup and grind all your tools the same until you get enough experience to know and understand WHY you might want to change the grind style or angle. There are specific applications for some very specific grinds that should not be in common usage on your tools. [I'm talking here about gouges (for bowl turning in my case)... of course there's specialized tools that'll be sharpened differently.]  To make the grind consistent, you need to do three things:   The 'holder' that is mounted to your grinder: Determine and set the amount of extension out from the grinder base. THEN mark that distance on the movable square-tubing so you can always return it to that point should you have (or later want) to adjust it for other grinds. The piece that holds your gouge to be sharpened: Set the angle of the moveable leg ... then tighten the f*k out of the nut so it never ever moves again. Fabricate some means of consistently setting the amount/length of the gouge that extends past the front point of the holder. This should be some sort of single-use jig that will never ever be changed.   With those three items set, all your gouges with be sharpened at the same angle. ....As you establish and set those three distances, you can monkey with the actual angle of the gouge tip until you get something that looks like what you want or that you've managed to measure.  From that point on, the only thing that will change the angle of your grind is either you moving/changing one of your established angles ... or the wear of the wheel changing it's diameter. Thankfully the change in diameter is very slow and you'll understand what's going on with the whole set up long before you have to make an adjustment for that diameter change (IOW, don't sweat it right now.)"
turning,36z5hc,Sol_Invictus,3,Sat May 23 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"Figure out the depth you want the gouge to stick through the front of the jig. Drill a hole that deep in some scrap 2x. Theres your depth setting, repeatable."
turning,36z5hc,ctrum69,2,Sat May 23 15:31:01 2015 UTC,Yep... or a block set in that distance from the edge of a bench...  But I wasn't that smart years ago when I was trying to figure all this out.

turning,36z5hc,tigermaple,3,Mon May 25 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"For measuring the angles, I have this protractor and one of these Vicmarc gauges. (You don't need both, either will get the job done). The Vicmarc has the added benefit of doubling as a spindle center finder.  In terms of how to, have you seen the AAW sharpening video? The whole thing is worth watching but specifically in this section here, John Jordan talks about what the angle should look like, then freehand grinds the shape in to a new gouge, then goes over how to use the Wolverine jig. I'd been using my Wolverine for over six years before seeing this video and it clarified some of the subtle points for me, well worth the watch. (For example, I didn't realize that the side angle should be set by arm while the nose angle is best set by the angle of the leg, because when I got started, I read a lot of things that said to keep the leg fixed).  Post some pictures of your grind and I might be able to help more with the specific issues you're having. Also, which cuts or what are you doing when it seems really grabby?"
turning,36z5hc,Sol_Invictus,3,Sat May 23 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"Hey there I read your comments often on here. ... Not suggesting anything you wrote is wrong. I don't think there's a lot of 'wrong' in turning; only results you're happy with. Just to extend the discussion a little...  I've studied with John and a few other name-turners at Arrowmont.  They ALL start off with an explanation of sharpening. They're ALL different. They ALL work.  Like most things in turning, there's no ""the"" way. There's what someone does consistently enough that they learn the tricks and traps of of that particular approach.  There's no perfect grind or sweep or angle... There's what you know and master. There may be better or easier setups in various circumstances, but the broader your experience the more one is able to work in a variety of situations with the same tool.  Seems to me people need to spend more time makin shavings than trying to finesse each difficulty with another tool. That kind of experience is where mastery comes from, not a larger kit of tools.  Whatta you think?"
turning,36z5hc,tigermaple,3,Sat May 23 15:23:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a lot of 'wrong' in turning; only results you're happy with.   Definitely! Couldn't have said it better myself. And not only is there no perfect grind or sweep or angle, what worked just fine for you on the last bowl might not work at all on the next one. I've been turning some cottonwood lately, and wow, is it ever a challenge! It's so soft that it'll tear out if you look at it wrong, so it's forced me to reach a lot deeper in to my ""bag of tricks"" and try some crazy stuff. (Shear scraping ""backwards"" - that is, rim to foot on the outside, is what finally did the trick).   Seems to me people need to spend more time makin shavings than trying to finesse each difficulty with another tool. That kind of experience is where mastery comes from, not a larger kit of tools.   Definitely agree with this too. I think the #1 thing any beginner could do for themselves is get a bunch of green wood logs (and they don't even have to be big ones or interesting wood) and mount 'em up with no agenda other than making shavings.  Later on, I think there is some benefit to having bunch of different gouges with different angles for different situations, but that comes way further down the road than most people think.  The one thing that video really did for me was that, up until seeing it, I was, as you recommended in your comment, leaving the leg totally fixed* and adjusting everything with how far the v-pocket arm was extended, and going to adjusting both like John does in the video allowed me to tweak a couple things concerning the angle of the side of the side-ground gouge.  *It's a popular recommendation. I've heard Craft Supplies goes as far as welding theirs in place for the ones in their class workshop."

Absolutely.  There's a whole lot of people who would improve their turning a ton if they did this for a month... or probably even for a week. And no time for sanding either; go with the finish you can turn.  Save em all and line em up in time order at the end of the week and have a look. If you don't see improvement you have no idea what you're why you're standing at the lathe.
turning,36z5hc,gotwoodllc,2,Sat May 23 16:21:22 2015 UTC,Here are two additional articles that I wrote a while back which might help in determining your grinding angles for gouges (as well as the other tools).

turning,36z5hc,Sol_Invictus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:47:46 2015 UTC,Thank you... I'll have a look later today.
turning,36z5hc,tigermaple,2,Thu Jun 18 13:13:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information and I will check out the AAW video. I tend to be overly analytical and as a new bowl turner, I don't have a ton of local support to use as a reference. When I purchased the bowl gouge, it came with a factory grind that worked all right. I would have catches if I presented the tool wrong, but mostly I could turn catch free. However, after trying the swept back grind it catches a lot more during basic turning than I am used to. That is why I would like to be able to verify that the angle I have ground matches what I am expecting. Also, not sure if the swept back wings are too steep, too high, etc. Here is a link to my current grind:  http://imgur.com/a/rrjCX  I purchased this center finder a bit ago and it does have the angle measurements like the Vicmarc Gauge Master:  http://www.amazon.com/NOVA-10051-Chuck-Gauge-Accessory/dp/B0064JJFAC  However, I don't seem to be able to match the set angles with my grind. I did find this video by Cindy Drozda:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_KDSIDAtGc  She uses a protractor with an arm to measure the current angle. Additionally, she marks the grinding platform at established angles. However, I am unsure how to accurately mark the platform against the center of the wheel. I was able to get the basic grind movement via TheWoodturningShop ""Sharpening a Swept Back Grind or Irish Grind on a Bowl Gouge - How To"" located here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNCZP3veFqk  Now I really want one of those DMT wheels.  Also, he uses an additional jig to set the height of his V platform.  Again thanks for all the advice and help, I will watch the video and report back,"
turning,36z5hc,tigermaple,2,Mon May 25 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"So looking at your gouge pics and reading your comments, I think you've got a couple things going on- you're definitely overthinking things :D, so on that front, just relax a little, the wood won't know the difference! (I love wood of course, but it's also a cheeky little bastard anyway that is going to move and flex on you at all times and really drive you bonkers if you've got the engineer mindset). Regarding the lines on the grinder platform, just do the best you can eyeballing it with a pencil mark of where the center of the wheel looks like to you then measure out from there with your protractor. Again, if these wind up being 33 degree lines instead of 30, it really won't be a big deal, the point is you'll have something consistent to go off of.  Second, the good news! You're really not that far off I don't think. Looking at the picture of your grind, I think what may be contributing to your issues is that while many people like for the wings to have a little bit of a complex convex curve, you've maybe got it just a bit exaggerated. This is leading to the grind kind of dipping as it comes to the nose and that can contribute to catches because it makes it hard to feel the bevel as you cut near the nose where the grind is dipping off. What you want to to is try to grind this out by just lightly doing wings only for a couple passes- careful though! It's easy to overdo it, then you've got the opposite problem - convex concave wings, and you wanna talk about some catches, oh man, convex wings will do it!  Lastly I think the nose angle looks fine. It's a bit on the steep (blunt) side but it sure doesn't look 67 degrees to me. Are you measuring from the inside of the flute? I would honestly leave this for last till you get the rest sorted. A sharper angle will cut better but is also harder to control.   Here's a pic of one of my grinds I've posted before. Note that the curve just runs continuously around from wing to wing, no dipping on the nose. That's really the key, but it does take some practice to get there. Even with a jig, you've still got to pay close attention to the shape as it develops and tweak your approach accordingly. Good luck!"
turning,36z5hc,tigermaple,1 point,Mon May 25 17:37:37 2015 UTC,I was able to purchase an angle gauge like Cindy Drozda uses. It looks like the front of my gouge is coming in at 63-67 degrees instead of 50-60. So that might account for some of my issues. Now I just need to figure out the proper adjustment to lower the angle.

turning,36vv4c,thegoddamntrain,1 point,Sat May 23 08:49:14 2015 UTC,"I love the vertex kits. That magnetic cap is sweet, it posts, and the length of the tube allows you to show off really nice woods.   As to a fountain pen.. they tend to look at lot more troublesome than they are. The ones that use a step drill are trickier. But for a standard posting cap pen, with a kit from a good manufacturer, you shouldn't really have any trouble. Just take care in selecting your blank.. the caps tend to run real close to the edges on many blanks, and anything that is prone to chipping or cracking will do it where it's really thin. Some of them end up being veneer thickness, if you use a standard size blank. So go for a bigger blank, keep track of the order and orientation of the blank when you are cutting it, and putting it on the mandrel, and take your time. You'll screw a few up.. probably sooner rather than later. We all have. I'd stick with the cheaper kits from Penn State or Woodcraft till you have made a few. If you screw up a 50 or 60 dollar kit, you'll be kicking yourself."

Buy a hammer? Everything looks like a nail! Buy a bandsaw? Everything looks like a project blank!  Second, good tools that are well cared for hold their value for a long time, and can easily be resold for a moderate price. The only way a power tool today is any better than a power tool from 20 years ago is if there was a massive technological or safety related change that completely replaces the older version and cannot be adapted to the older tool. Honestly can probably count the number of those on one hand though, because tools are designed with a basic function in mind, regardless of how they achieve that function."

turning,36e805,ybotyawnoc,5,Mon May 18 18:21:40 2015 UTC,This album represents my time in front of a lathe so well. That tiny bit of tearout that 99% of people wouldn't notice but its such a big deal to you so you have to work it/sand it out until the bowl is perfect. Then everything is going great until DISASTER!!! and somehow you put a ding or dent into the wood that once again no one will notice except for you. But all that fixing of the minor defects is totally worth it once you oil that puppy up.   Very nice work all around and HOLY CRAP that is the prettiest ash ive ever seen.
turning,36e805,captianinsano,3,Mon May 18 19:15:07 2015 UTC,Really nice photo series. Thanks for sharing!
turning,36e805,gradyh,3,Mon May 18 18:57:32 2015 UTC,Excellent sequence. Happy to see the tailstock used when needed and also happy to see that you shaped the bowl from the foot up to the rim rather than trueing up the blank to a cylinder first.   It looks like on the inside you're turning with the flute of the gouge facing left and moving the tool from the center out to the rim. Why turn it that way rather than the other direction?
turning,36e805,jclark58,1 point,Mon May 18 21:42:30 2015 UTC,"When I'm just hogging material out I change direction frequently, mainly to alleviate boredom on a large bowl like this. I should really invest in a coring system."
turning,36e805,tigermaple,3,Tue May 19 05:06:22 2015 UTC,"Real nice process photo set! I'll second what /u/jclark58 said and commend you on just shaping from the foot up without worrying about truing to a cylinder first. My other guess for your tearout if you were cutting in the correct direction (rim to foot on the inside), is that your bevel might be too wide to ""turn the corner"" so to speak and in that area where you had trouble, you lost bevel contact and were effectively scraping. Some of us address the issue by grinding a second bevel just to get some of the heel out of the way like so. This doesn't change much about how the tool works overall and makes it so it can turn a tighter radius curve while still rubbing the bevel."

If you're going to do quite a bit of pen assembly, it's worth investing in a small press of some variety to help with the process.  The coolest one I saw was a guy at a convention who had some ""press blocks"" for a drill press. They were some pieces of HDPE (milk jug plastic) that he had turned on the lathe into a set of guides for slimline pens. One bottom piece had a taper cut into it that matched the writing tip end and was flat on the other side for the caps/clips, one piece fit down over the twist assembly (prevented it from being inserted too far), and the other had a shaft protruding to stabilize the barrel as it was pressed down onto the part.  He'd assemble the pens by first pressing all of the caps/clips on, then insert all of the points, then finally change out the plastic in the chuck to press in the twist assembly.  I always wanted to try making something like that, but I never did figure out where to get a block of HDPE that I could turn like that."

Not criticizing, as they look much better than my first (Dozen) pens, but some tips:  For the acrylic, get an acrylic polish.. it's the last step after you wet sand to the highest grit.. you just put a bit on the rag or paper towel, and use it like a polishing compound. It leaves a glass finish.   And get closer to the bushings, either with the skew or gouge (which can get hairy) or the 80 grit gouge (Sandpaper).   and yes, that looks like black walnut to me.   Overally, the look awesome, and good choices on the wood/furniture pairings.   As to pen presses.. I have the adjustable one that is an aluminum plate, with a big lever on one end, and a hand wheel and delrin anvil on the other, and it works great, though I've found cutting a couple of blocks of wood to just drop in rather than re-adjusting the anvil each time is easier."

The wood was fairly wet when it was turned, I would have preferred dry wood but getting a chunk that large dried without any defects would be very difficult and I was on a very tight schedule. I resorted to microwave drying after rough turning in order to get it finished in about a week.   Sizing is based on the 1 cubic inch per pound rule (200 lbs = 200 cubic inches). I'd rather have it too large than too small so I shoot for 10-15% over size. I measure the volume with rice 1 cup = 14 cubic inches.

For me, the main advantage of the Ellsworth grind is its versatility- you can push cut, pull cut, scrape, shear scrape and make another type of pull cut, the ""peeling"" or slicing cut, all with the same tool, and different woods and situations respond better to one or the other.

I did all the boring on rough stock... finishing the outside turning became essentially a pen-turning operation, using a custom made mandrel designed to fit into the whistles' bores.  I'm still experimenting with drill bit selection.  I've experimented with off-the-shelf long twist bits, home-made bits, and other modifications.  The problem is that in the very hard woods used for whistles, a whole lot of friction and heat builds up - it can be quite a challenge to get all the way through 12"" of bore without overheating and ruining the bit or the wood.  It can also be hard to get the waste properly ejected as you go.  Much patience is required.  The proper solution to this is a gun drill, which is designed for exactly this sort of operation (long precision bores in hard material - gun barrels).  It shoots compressed air through the bit, which cools the tip and forces the waste material back up the bit's flutes.  I'll probably end up buying a gun drill setup eventually if I get back to making whistles again (I've been working on some string instruments lately instead)."

turning,3614o4,scharwenkadh,2,Sat May 16 06:48:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and glad I could help!  For what it's worth, the drill press is probably the first thing I'd ditch in this process... Since I did that writeup, I've kind of given up on using the drill press as a mill to cut the windway.  I'd actually prefer to do that by hand now... a sharp knife, a small chisel, and a few files get the job done quickly and with less chance of total disaster.  The only thing the drill press makes sense for is drilling the tone-holes, but with a bit of practice that can be done well with a hand drill as well... or even a brace and bit.  If you're worried about accuracy, drill the holes a tiny bit small and use files to enlarge them into their final shape."

turning,3614o4,Quietpiper,3,Fri May 15 09:23:15 2015 UTC,"The problem with using a drill press for this is that a one-piece penny whistle in D is about 12"" long, with about a 1/2"" i.d. bore.  A benchtop drill press isn't going to have the vertical capacity for that any way you arrange it, and even a big floor-standing one isn't going to have more than a few inches of actual quill travel - so you'll be moving the table up and down every time you want to clear the chips out of the bit... which is about every 1/2"" of depth if you don't want the thing to catch fire.  In my opinion, boring on the lathe is the only way to go here."
turning,3614o4,Quietpiper,2,Fri May 15 20:31:26 2015 UTC,Using a gundrill with compressed air on the lathe is probably the best way to bore. I actually make bagpipes part time and gundrills make everything easier for me.

Just scoop a little with a paper towel and rub it over, it's kinda like peanut butter. Then turn it on to around 1500 rpm and use a fresh part of paper towel to melt it into the wood and remove excess. Then kick it up to 2000 rpm or so and apply a single layer of the brown bar. It'll look white and streakey. Use force and a paper towel again. Might need a bit more force on this.  Then do the same with the white.

When i opened it, it had completely separated and nothing I did could get it to go back together to a working state.

You may have also turned it down just a bit too much to where the flexing of the thin wood caused the catch and tear.

Microwaving is not the best method for bowls. Too much cracking. If you choose the microwave method, keep your rough about twice the thickness you normally would. That can work. That also can lead to a little hairline crack that you didn't see that makes the whole bowl fly apart when you're 99% done with it.    That stinks up the house, too, so you'll have a wife to deal with.   Homemade dehydrator is the same way. Cracking.   Basically, my experience is that anything involving heat doesn't work well, but denatured alcohol does."
turning,35nyfr,baldylox,2,Tue May 12 04:43:52 2015 UTC,How long does the 5 gallon bucket of alcohol last you?  What happens to the water displaced from the wood?
turning,35nyfr,thegreatdivide,2,Tue May 12 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"A five gallon bucket of alcohol usually last me a day or two. :-P  Denatured alcohol in relation to bowls is another story. I don't know if I've ever put more than two gallons in the bucket. Maybe 2.5?   Different woods will stain the alcohol different colors. Osage is fun. Don't worry about that. If it gets stained a funky color, it'll come out in the final turning and sanding.   I really have no idea how long a couple gallons lasts me.  IIRC, the last time that I was cranking out a couple bowls a day, two gallons lasted at least a week or two.   You also have to make sure that your piece is submerged completely. My lathe will only accommodate up to a 9"" diameter bowl. If you're making bigger ones, you need more alcohol."
turning,35nyfr,baldylox,2,Tue May 12 05:01:30 2015 UTC,"I also use denatured alcohol. However, after I soak the bowl, I use masking tape to put a layer of brown butcher type paper tightly to the inside of the bowl, overlapping the edge of the bowl, to slow the drying a bit.  The theory is that the paper will hold moisture in a little longer so the drying of the wood as the alcohol dissipates doesn't happen too fast. It still dries very quickly. I read this online somewhere several years ago and it seems to work for me. Maybe this process is over kill- I don't know- but the DA has worked for me  many times."

Then because they're dull, you get a bad catch and chunk of pen flies into your throat and you bleed to death. Worst case but why be dependent on buying inserts?"

The starter set I bought needed sharpening out of the box, but the cheap bowl gouge I bought was sharp enough to get going. Some come purposely without any grind at all so you can sharpen your favourite grind for a particular tool onto it straight away."
turning,35o8zm,ensulyn,1 point,Tue May 12 11:49:41 2015 UTC,"If you're serious about turning eventually becoming something you want to do a lot of, consider a good water grinding system to keep your chisels sharp. Years ago, I spent almost 2 years learning to turn without ever having  what I now consider sharp chisels (just what I could accomplish on a bench grinder and a leather stropping wheel on a drill press), and when I finally got them sharpened and honed properly, it was a whole new world for me.   I have nothing against bench grinders to shape a tool, but I feel that even the finer grind wheels remove too much material too quickly when all you need is a touch-up job. Then you spend decent amount of time honing it to get rid of the jagged edge left by the grinder. After some use, you might need to touch up that edge just slightly, so you either try and use a more aggressive honing compound or you end up going back to the grinder and taking a bit more off. It's a delicate balance, and in my opinion it reduces the useful life of the tool considerably.  Tormek is the poster-boy for water systems (they got it right 20 years ago and everyone pretty much copied them), and carries the price tag to go with it. I purchased the T-7  used at a pawn shop (only needed a new stone) plus the accessory kits, and I an say without a doubt that the jig system works as advertised. The barrier to entry is the cost, but when you look at the price of decent quality stones, you realize you're only paying about half of that price for the grinder; the other half is for the stone.  Jet makes a similar model that works perfectly fine for about half the cost of a T-7, and it can use many of the Tormek jigs. A fellow turner owned one and demoed it to me when I was looking for a new sharpener. The grinder itself was functionally excellent. The only complaint for the Jet model was that the stone was garbage, and decent quality replacement stones aren't cheap! Had I not been alerted to the used T-7 at a pawn shop, I probably would have ordered the Jet and a stone that day.  Grizzly makes a cheaper-yet alternative that I'm not personally familiar with. From what I've read, most people say that if you get one free of manufacturing defects (bent shafts seem to be the common complaint) then they're solid machines that will perform well with some patience. Luckily, most of the Tormek and Jet jigs both work on the Grizzly as well, so you have your choice of accessories.  TL;DR - Get a water sharpening/honing system as soon as your budget allows for it. You won't be disappointed with the results!"
turning,35o8zm,N5IWA,1 point,Tue May 12 13:58:29 2015 UTC,Saw the price tag and made me want to mickey-mouse a water reservoir to my bench grinder lol! I think two years learning and beating up a set of starter tools before diving into a super nice set with tormek grinder is reasonable for sure tho. I'd hate to spend $700 on a wet grinder when i haven't even mastered the old bench. Good to know there is a nice upgrade to my current set up. I pretty much only use the bench grinder for lawn tools ATM precisely because it rips away too much metal for anything else.

turning,35f2uj,tigermaple,1 point,Sat May 9 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered, what are those workshops like? Is it like summer camp for adults, or just honing some more specific skills?"
turning,35f2uj,givemehellll,1 point,Sun May 10 03:47:05 2015 UTC,"You know, it's kinda hard to put in to words really. It's kind of like both of those things that you mentioned and yet neither completely does it justice either. I've been to 5 week-long workshops at Anderson Ranch (only 3 out of the 5 were in turning), and each workshop has been a little different.   There definitely is kind of a summer-camp feel to it. There's a dorm and a cafeteria, and each studio has a fridge for beer tucked away somewhere, and there's a volleyball net and a fire pit that both get used a lot, and plenty of beer is consumed! (After shop time of course). So, there is that kind of vacation vibe going on for sure.   But, there's a hard-working serious side to it too. Especially in the other disciplines like ceramics, photography, and painting, there are a lot of students in MFA programs doing a little something to advance their education and technique over the summer and you can tell everyone is very passionate and serious about getting the most out of their time there. Not only in turning, but in all the fields, the people they bring in to teach are the top pros in the world. We're talking guys (and gals) that have pieces in the Smithsonian or other equally prestigious collections and/or are making a (good) living with their art. So, a lot of us that go to these classes and get to spend a week learning from the masters treat it like the opportunity of a lifetime that it is, and it's not uncommon to work on your art from 9-5, break for dinner, and go back to the studio and work again till midnight. (They cut power tool usage at 10 pm, but the wood studio is open 24 hours and you can stay as late as you'd like working with hand tools).   I guess if it had to describe it simply I'd say it's a week of ""work hard, play hard.""   I can't recommend it enough if you ever get a chance to go, and they offer a lot of scholarships to help defray the costs for younger people/students. (And you can apply for grants from the AAW and possibly your local club).  Oh, and to answer the question about technique, most of the classes have a ""program"" of what the main thing the class will be about (and it's usually pretty much the teacher's signature thing- for example, Bihn Pho pretty much always teaches airbrushing and piercing), but those guys will usually change the agenda or add to it to teach you anything you are interested in, or they'll come back during the evening studio hours to teach requested side topics."

One of these days I will get a little fancier and get some cole jaws or make a Longworth chuck or a vacuum chuck but this has been working just fine in the meanwhile. It's probably the least complicated way I know of to turn off any evidence of the chucking method and give the foot a real nice finishing touch."
turning,35c7ap,Sol_Invictus,2,Fri May 8 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"I've been using that method to finish bowls for years except that I mount the shaped piece of wood in a chuck rather than on a faceplate. Don't worry too much about shaping the thing either. I just have 'small, medium and large'.  Doug Thompson gouges are great. I have five or six and they're my go-to steel for everything but the very last cuts.  Dat ""bottom feeder"" too although I had no name for it. Learned it from some instructor at Arrowmont. Don't use it a lot but there's the occasional piece makes me wonder what I did before I learned it."
turning,35c7ap,Sol_Invictus,2,Fri May 8 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think ""bottom feeder"" is kind of a recent name- the ""marketing"" name Mike Mahoney or CSUSA came up with for his signature series. Why anyone would pay the extra for this grind that is one of the easiest in the world as a ""signature series"" is beyond me, but I like the name anyway and kind of appropriated it since like you said, most other bowl turners know what you mean when you say that and it's quicker than saying ""non-swept back grind with a really steep angle."" I use it almost every bowl for coming across the last third or so in to the bottom on the final cuts.  Curious about what you switch out to for your final cuts, since like you said, the steel on the Thompson is hard to beat!"
turning,35c7ap,Sol_Invictus,2,Fri May 8 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"I've always heard --- but have no proof other than what seems to be the case in my experience --- that while the harder, more exotic alloys will hold a sharp edge longer than others, some of the 'softer' (for lack of a better term) steels will actually take a sharper edge (but hold it for a shorter time).  Like I said, I have no idea. But I have some old Hamlet gouges from ten or fifteen years ago... not the hardest alloy they had even then. They're what I go to for final cuts or if I'm having trouble smoothing up some cantankerous grain."

turning,35c7ap,billydreamer,1 point,Sat May 9 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"Here's one I found on short notice. The concept of a ""signature grind"" is kind of silly but if you can get past that, this is pretty close to how I use mine. For the grind, it's sharpened with a steep bevel (just went and measured mine and it's 60 degrees), and straight across just like a spindle roughing gouge, with the one exception that you can round off the corners of the wings a bit so they don't catch.   In use, it can be used with the bevel rubbing on the right wing more or less in a ""normal"" bevel riding cut, and you can also use it with the tool held perpendicular to the rest, the flute straight up and the bevel rubbing the left wing in what I think is known as a ""back cut."" This is a somewhat grabby, advanced technique and David Ellsworth describes it in his book  I'll update if I can find a better video."

turning,35bl3j,GrandAve_Photo,7,Fri May 8 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"I do a lot of CA finishing (nearly everything I do is finished with it) and I get compliments all the time from other turners, so I guess I must be good at it..... here's my process:   Turn Blanks Sand to 400 Grit at slow speed (slowest I can go is 750 RPM, I use abranet, but I don't think it really matters) After 400, turn off lathe and sand back and forth with the grain over the entire blank to remove any radial scratches with the 400 grit.  Wipe thoroughly with Acetone with the lathe spinning.  Turn your speed up a bit... I run mine at 1050 RPM while applying the CA.  Get yourself some Scott's blue paper towels... this is important, I've tried others and they do not work nearly as well.  Fold it into a 1-2 inch wide strip.  Squirt a bit of thin CA on the towel and quickly wipe it back and forth across your blank, it only takes 2-3 quick passes.  Then give it a spritz of accelerator.  Wait about 10 seconds and it should be set... to test this, hold the back of one of your fingers to the spinning blank, it's hard to describe, but you'll know when it's done... just seems to glide smoothly, no stickiness to it at all.  Do this a total of 5 times.  Now we switch to medium CA.  Same process, squirt a bit on your towel and quickly wipe back and forth 2-3 times and then hit it with a spritz of accelerator.  For me, it takes about 45 seconds for the medium to set up... I check the same way with the back of my finger.  Do this a total of 5 times.  Crank your lathe speed up some.... I run it around 1750 RPM and get out the micromesh pads and wet sand.  Mine go from 600-12,000 grit.  It doesn't take long with each pad.  Make sure you soak them in water for a couple of minutes before you start the wet sanding.  I wipe the blank down with a paper towel inbetween each pad.  After 12,000 it should be looking pretty good.  A lot of people stop right there and they're done.  I have a Beall buff system.... so after the 12,000 I get out the buffs and hit it with the tripoli wheel, and the white diamond wheel.  At this point, mine look like glass."
turning,35bl3j,g1bs0nsg,1 point,Fri May 8 20:28:24 2015 UTC,Do you have any tips for determining how many coats of CA are enough? Any visual / tactile indicators?
turning,35bl3j,DavidPx,2,Fri May 8 22:12:07 2015 UTC,"This is how I arrived at the number of coats I use.  I spent an entire day on the same blank, applying a CA finish and then sanding it off and doing it over again.  I tried 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20, elventy billion coats, etc..... I tried finishing it off with Novus plastic polish, Meguiar's PlastX, HUT pen polish.... through all my trial and error I came to the conclusion that I like 5 coats thin, 5 coats medium, wet sanding to 12,000, and then finishing with my Beall Buff.    The reason I do thin CA first is that it really helps to seal the wood up, it gets down into any little imperfections and makes for a smooth working surface when you switch to medium.  How true this is, I am not sure, but other guys in my turning club swear that if you just use medium or thick it can lead to problems like spider webbing after a period of time.  And they claim it doesn't conform to the shape of the wood quite as well and can allow moisture in, which will cause your blank to expand and crack your finish also.  So, through my experimentation I found that anything less than 10 coats tends to end up with me sanding through the finish during wet sanding.... and anything more doesn't really add to the finish and just makes it more of a pain to make sure that your blank aligns flush with your parts during assembly.  Now, if you have a lighter touch when wet sanding, you might be able to use less coats.  Everyone I know that does a CA finish does it a different way, you just have to figure out what works for you."
turning,35bl3j,g1bs0nsg,1 point,Sat May 9 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"I go straight to thick CA and  use the paper towels from Home depot.  I have seen guys use the little foam sticks to apply CA also, seems to prevent fuzzies.  I usually only need 3-4 coats for non-porous woods. I wet sand my last couple coats with 1000, then use corian polish to finish it off."
turning,35bl3j,rgraham888,1 point,Sat May 9 04:50:44 2015 UTC,"this is what i do pretty much.  My only problem is i seem to get rough area's around the end parts.  I think it is because im pushing the ca towards the ends and then ""sort of leaving it there"". I use the tapered CA finish bushings so it builds a bit on the ends.  anyway a bit of sanding and buffing and its like glass.  On things i want to really show depth ill do upwards of twenty coats."
turning,35bl3j,CrimsonKeel,4,Sun May 10 01:20:58 2015 UTC,I found this video to be pretty informative.  I haven't done a ton of CA finishing but I've had success with this process:   Turn blanks Sand to 400 Apply ~5 coats of thin CA with a folded paper towel Sand with 600 Progress through the Micromesh pads: 1500-12000   As with all finishing it's important to have a good base to work from.  If your blank is rough your glue will be rough too.

turning,35bl3j,neffs,2,Sat May 9 05:04:44 2015 UTC,"Both David and Gibson in the previous comments sound spot on. Here's just another few problems I had to work through when I started out:    Make sure you're wet sanding after the CA is applied. Friction can ruin the finish.  don't sand between coats of CA  don't use too much accelerator, and wipe off the excess after a few seconds  Thin CA glue didn't bind well enough to create a working layer for me. I'm better with the medium.   Remember you're building up the CA layer to then knock it down smooth. Make sure you're adding a good enough layer (or 10 layers) to have enough room take off the bumps. Sand until you have a consistent surface with your 1500 wet sand. I found 600 to take off too much material.  Also don't store your micromesh in water! 45 minutes was enough to ruin a good set really fast."

I never sand between coats, never looks right"
turning,35bl3j,Mikedealer,2,Sat May 9 00:02:39 2015 UTC,"Lots of good info here.. the only thing I'd add is porous woods (ekii, padauk, some oaks,), which end up with those lovely little tubes along the pen, which look so delightful when filled with wax.. will also fill with your polishing compound, leaving white dimples in the pen. You have to get them all full with the CA before you have any hope of getting that glass finish you want. For me, that means laying on medium CA long way (rubbing the length of the pen) until those dimples fill up. then I'll usually sand down to level, and then proceed as described by others. Good luck! (Then I wet sand up to 1600 or whatever the finest pad in the set I have is, turning off the lathe and going long way on the pen a few times, wiping between grits with a clean cloth, then hit it with PKONestep acrylic polish as a final step)."
turning,35ajxd,Mikedealer,3,Fri May 8 14:18:35 2015 UTC,I have only ever used a round tip bit on a home made tool and I dont really use it that much but ive had to rotate it almost all the way around now.

turning,35ajxd,WhoaLeeSmokes,3,Fri May 8 17:43:27 2015 UTC,Most metal cutting lathe inserts have a slight radius at the tip to add strength. Carbide is brittle and tips that come to a point can chip very easily.

turning,356cyl,gabrielleigh,2,Thu May 7 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"Purpleheart turns purple with age and exposure to natural light. When you first cut or sand purpleheart, you will notice the freshly exposed wood will often lose the deep and rich purple color that the surface wood had before you cut or sanded it. This will come back with time, and some purpleheart will look extremely ""pale"" when cut or sanded. Other pieces will retain more of the purple color when cut. I haven't figured out any way to predict which pieces will look pale at first, it seems to be pretty random with the lumber I work in my shop. You can speed up this process by setting up the finished piece under a UV light, or allowing it to sit near a brightly-lit window after it is finished."
turning,356cyl,supercovertguy,1 point,Thu May 7 14:18:04 2015 UTC,"This was my initial understanding, but also the source of my confusion. I also read that it was both the UV exposure and age which made it lose the purple over time. I was hoping to counteract that by finishing with a UV resistant marine varnish, is this not a wise plan?  As I understand it, I should wait a week or so after finishing turning to apply the finish to try to get the color back into the piece?"
turning,356cyl,deezy139,2,Thu May 7 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"The UV finish will slow down the wood from regaining the purple color, but as far as I know there are no products that can permanently prevent woods from changing color due to UV exposure. I have been turning purpleheart for over a dozen years now, and every project I do darkens with time. I have noticed a huge fluctuation in the color of purpleheart when I cut it. I attribute this to different growing conditions, different species possibly. Some pieces look like they were soaked in grape Koolaid, others have a lavender-brown color. It can be hard to predict what it will turn out like, so cutting a test piece and letting it age is one of the best ways to see what you will have."

turning,34zyiw,grymoire,3,Wed May 6 06:45:10 2015 UTC,"A skew is tricky for beginners.   You can use a scraper instead, and lots of sandpaper.   Expect to use up a lot of wood to gain experience with a skew. A couple of things to remember   Always ride the bevel. That is, the bevel should always be flush against the wood, so it just rubs. Then lift up the handle to gently start slicing into the wood. If you are starting the cut right, you can press hard against the wood and nothing will cut because the bevel away from the edge is against the wood.  Keep the point away from the smooth surface. It's better to start cutting with the middle of the edge. The point, if it catches, will dig into the wood and make pieces go flying, or else make big gashes. For beginners, the skew is best for making a smooth surface.  Avoid making curved shapes, especially concave curves. You may want to cut downhill (if you have a convex curve). Start at the top and ride the curve (with the bevel against the wood) down the curve."

Another place I've found good stuff is a landscaping place. Costs them to take stuff to the transfer station so they put the big wood in a pile on their lot with a big free sign next to it.

I'm fortunate enough to have all this, but I just know that some people really aren't around woods that're easy to get like that. Even landscaping folks around me have either contracts with people who want the mesquite/pecan/oak for BBQ or it's all small. We do have tons of cedar, but cedar is nasty if you ask me.   I mostly said that just because I know it's not always possible to get the great chunks of wood we see pop up on this subreddit. Especially if you want to work with non-rotted wood.

turning,34np68,tigermaple,1 point,Sun May 3 02:05:10 2015 UTC,"No one ever said ""I wish I'd gotten a smaller one.""  For $100 more here, you're getting:      Significantly more between centers    A bit more swing    Variable speed (even though it's Reeves drive, not EVS, this is still huge. I would get it for this alone)    A lower low speed. This will be important as you get in to bigger bowls.   The lower top speed shouldn't be of concern, but then again I'm not a pen turner so I don't know if there is some advantage to being able to go that fast for pen turning. I think the 2400 would be plenty but again, very little direct experience with pens.  The motor is in the wrong place as /u/shinyrich has said and Jet has since corrected that on their model that this is a copy of, but I think you'd be looking at 3x the price at least to go with the new Jet. I think all in all, you'd be pretty happy with the bigger one and it would keep you happy for a longer time before you felt the need to upgrade.  ETA: What I listed above here as ""a bit more swing"" is actually pretty significant as well. Going from 10"" to 12"" is one of the most significant jumps in lathe shopping. I would feel pretty constrained on a 10"" swing machine whereas I could do 80-90% of my work on a 12"" swing machine. (Keep in mind the ""practical"" maximum diameter you can do is 1""-2"" less than the listed swing because to hit the maximum swing, your blank would have to be perfectly rounded and centered to begin with and you'd have to keep the banjo off to the side the whole time). Going from 10"" to 12"" therefore opens of a lot of possibilities. It's a more significant jump than when shopping for bigger lathes going from 16"" to 20"" or 20"" to 24""."

turning,34gp1u,gman5500,3,Fri May 1 00:19:06 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not a fan of bulbous pens like that. if you like it however that is a personal thing. the fit looks good especially for your first and I assume its just a friction polish on it so finish is ok.  however if you are doing the bulbous look try and match the blanks in proportion.  the front part has two bumps so I think visually the back side should also or at least seem to flow like it is all one pen.
turning,34gp1u,CrimsonKeel,1 point,Fri May 1 00:58:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comments! I do enjoy the look of bulbous pens and I fit it to my hand. I'll keep some stuff you said in mind for next time :)

turning,34biww,tigermaple,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:44:44 2015 UTC,why is the leg about a foot long on the jig?
turning,34cvcu,ensulyn,6,Thu Apr 30 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"If you can only afford one, the dry grinder+ wolverine jig, no question. It will reshape your tools (and almost all new gouges require considerable initial reshaping), whereas the wet grinder will not (or at least will take forever by comparison to do so).  The additional advantage of the dry grinder + wolverine is that they are ubiquitous. If you take a class anywhere, that's what they will have for you to use for sharpening."
turning,34cvcu,tigermaple,3,Thu Apr 30 03:23:41 2015 UTC,Another vote for dry grinder plus jigs.  I have that Rikon and it works very well.  And if you wait for a sale (usually Woodcraft) you can get it for $100.
turning,34cvcu,DavidPx,2,Thu Apr 30 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"Any tips for balancing the grinding wheels?

I got mine at my local Woodcraft and was able to fire up the ones they had in stock, picking the best one.    Before the Rikon I had the $300 Jet grinder and was never able to get it balanced so I sent it back.  Sounds like you've already gone farther than I did with the machined washers...  Maybe one of those Oneway balancer kits is in your future."

turning,34d2yx,philbobalboa,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Hell yea harbor freight! I can't wait until I have more money to buy a better one.  Stainless Steel is your best bet, but it's a bear to work with. i went with a 1/2"" mild steel rod that I picked up at my local ace hardware because I didn't want to worry about working the stainless. If you go with mild, make sure you wipe it with WD-40 after every use. This will keep the rust at bay. Try your best to get a square rod because the tool will roll if you get a catch with a round bottom. I ground mine flat on bottom so it's not too bad.  Also, definitely don't buy tubing. You need the tool to be hefty so it doesn't chatter. Tubing is too light and you'll be fighting vibrations constantly."

turning,34ai7l,wdnick,2,Wed Apr 29 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"Nice work. It's not best practice to orient the grain in that direction for a bowl, but it did make an interesting effect with the porosity and radial rays of the oak."
turning,34ai7l,gradyh,2,Wed Apr 29 16:59:34 2015 UTC,It was pretty much just a practice piece. I was cutting a crotch in half with the chainsaw and cut the branch off. The diameter didn't seem hardly big enough to yield a decent cross grain bowl so I did this.  Unfortunately as it has dried the color isn't nearly as dramatic.
turning,34ai7l,gradyh,2,Wed Apr 29 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"That's pretty good practice. End grain hollowing is challenging - especially in wood like oak. But the lessons you learn may not apply to faceplate work, since the tool angles and techniques are different between the two."
turning,34ai7l,mdedm,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:26:59 2015 UTC,Why not? How does the grain direction affect the bowl?
turning,34ai7l,tigermaple,3,Thu Apr 30 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"I think one of the main reasons is that unless you have a huge piece of wood, the pith is going to be in the blank and that increases the chances of cracking. Also, all of your typical bowl turning techniques don't work since you'd be cutting ""backwards"" on end grain. (End grain is hollowed from the center cutting out and up instead of from the rim down like in a side grain bowl blank). That being said, it's fun to try it anyway from time to time and see what happens!"
turning,34ai7l,gradyh,2,Thu Apr 30 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly what /u/tigermaple said. As wood dries, it builds up a ton of stress tangential to the growth rings. Look at the end of any cut log after it's had a few days to dry and you'll see ""checks"" which are just cracks that radiate from the pith. It's because of the tangential stress pulling the wood apart. Bowl blanks are cut to relieve this stress from the wood - to give the wood freedom to deform without fighting against itself.  One more thing tigermaple didn't mention - strength. Wood is very weak along the grain. The shape of most bowls means that if you orient the grain vertically (like shown), the fibers basically ""stand alone."" They are not well supported by their neighboring fibers, so strength of the bowl can suffer."

turning,347yxk,tigermaple,3,Wed Apr 29 01:48:59 2015 UTC,"How much do you plan to turn? This stuff can get very pricey very quickly. Either by costing a lot for sharpening supplies... or by wearing your tools down to nothing.  From further down in the thread it looks like you're just starting... so maybe it's too soon to take the route I took?   Given where you're at, I would find a slow speed 8"" grinder and either build or buy a jig. Don't use a fast grinder. It's way to easy to screw up these tools and ruin the temper by ""burning"" the metal. (When the tool changes color from the heat, you know you've gone too far.)  for the future:... I went straight for the Tormek. I got the smaller one. If I had to do it over again I'd just go for the big one. My setup was $1200 including all the jigs (and taxes), but I can sharpen everything in my shop. Perfect sharpening every time with very little wear on the tools.  The guys in my wood turning club still give me a hard time, but they think slow speed grinders are faster because the Tormek is ""slow"". It's only slow if you're reshaping your tools. As my collection of tools has grown, I realized how slow it is to regrind tools to different profiles all the time. And most of my ""reshaping"" was trying to fix what I had screwed up by grinding off too much. :-) So now I've stopped messing around with angles and grinds. My tools last so much longer because the Tormek only takes off the slightest bit of metal possible to renew the edge.  I don't turn that much (a few hours on the weekends), but my time is precious to me... so I consider it worth it. And I'm very glad to stop using my slow speed grinder for sharpening.  I also know a guy who has the Tormek jigs hooked up to a slow speed grinder (with diamond wheels)."
turning,347yxk,adiaa,2,Wed Apr 29 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Heck yes on the Tormek.  Similarly, I upgraded from the T3 to the T7 and wish I would have just gotten the 7 first.   I have the BGM-100 dry grinder guide bar using it with the Rikon slow speed grinder, it works great! All my reshaping happens there with sharpening on the Tormek."

turning,347yxk,dw0r,2,Wed Apr 29 01:26:54 2015 UTC,If you don't have a grinder or a desire to make jigs you can carefully hand sharpen them with sand paper on a piece of granite or glass or cast iron.

From scratch it is not that much more expensive than a grinder, Wolverine system and other accouterments and it looks to be less expensive than the Tormek.   It does all your Turning tools and is much easier to learn to get a good edge, 'cause if you are going to turn you are going to sharpen."

To me, this piece is the ""payoff"" as all those different elements come together in one cohesive composition where it is obvious that every detail is intentional and not a happy accident!  Only because you asked because really the piece is great as is: You could make the foot even smaller, around perhaps 70% or so of the diameter here and I don't think you'd sacrifice any stability, but doing so would allow you to have an even nicer curve from the shoulder to the foot. Kick that idea around for next time perhaps, but your mom is gonna treasure this one I'm sure. Well done, looking forward to the video!"
turning,33mkry,BruceWayneWoodArtist,3,Thu Apr 23 19:12:21 2015 UTC,Woodcraft has it priced the same as a 3520b. I know which one I would get if I was dropping that kind of money.  Edit: Aren't you turning on a G0462? I'd give that to my father in law and keep the $4k machine for myself...
turning,33mkry,gradyh,2,Thu Apr 23 19:55:16 2015 UTC,"I have a G0462 ""finish lathe"". It has a major design flaw in the belt drive system and if i dont change the belts every few weeks the low end goes from 550 to around 800 or worse as the belt wears so now it just gets used to spray on, apply CA, or anything else that makes a major mess that i dont want on my DVR. If i were buying a new machine for myself it would be an American Beauty from Robust, but it will be a while before i can justify the upgrade or expense.   Anyways, are you saying that you feel the 3520b is a better machine? Have you used both the 3520 & the Laguna to have comparison points? I want to get something nice for him. The in-laws bought us a new F-350 pickup truck for our 10 year anniversary this year and although i cannot afford anything like that, i think getting him a new machine would be a nice ""we appreciate you guys"" gift. If you could offer any comparison points or personal experience with use it would be greatly appreciated. My only experience is with DVR, Grizzly, and Jet."
turning,33mkry,tigermaple,2,Thu Apr 23 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say /u/gradyh is right on the money. Though, I'd be interested too in hearing from anyone that actually has one or has at least gotten a chance to play with one for a day in a class or something, but absent a glowing review from someone I trusted, I would steer clear based on Laguna's reputation for horrible customer service alone. (Google it, it's not hard to find several stories on any forum that are basically ""I had a problem and they didn't give a damn."")  Not only is the PM3520b's list price the same, it's also relatively easy to get it for under the list price: Everything Powermatic and Jet goes on sale at Woodcraft and/or Rockler for 10%-15% off every Memorial Day and Father's Day, and even on any old day of the week, if you go back and forth calling up some of the main dealers (Craft Supplies, Osolnik Machinery, Toolnut etc.) and play a little game of ""can you beat their price?"" you can likely get it for at least 10% off list.  Around the same money can also get your foot in the door on a Oneway- 1640's start at $4,250.00. Less swing than either of the above but on a whole 'nother level in terms of build quality.

turning,33kiuj,OrifAce,3,Thu Apr 23 06:54:32 2015 UTC,What species of wood are you using? That grey area looks like a pattern which is intrinsic to the grain of this particular piece.
turning,33kiuj,Greckel82,2,Thu Apr 23 13:27:38 2015 UTC,It is maple and it seems that DavidPx might have nailed it because it is porous and the grain is almost fluffy.
turning,33kiuj,DavidPx,3,Thu Apr 23 18:25:02 2015 UTC,"Those are areas of torn-out end grain.  It will be pitted and rough and thus never get a good smooth finish.    Do your last few passes with a freshly-sharpened tool, a light touch, and cutting downhill."
turning,33kiuj,tigermaple,2,Thu Apr 23 16:59:35 2015 UTC,"That was what I was thinking, but I have some poor quality tools that I need to upgrade as I constantly have to sharpen them. Thank you for the tips and I will give it a try. I probably should have taken the picture before I tried sanding."
turning,33kiuj,tigermaple,4,Thu Apr 23 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"Better tools definitely hold an edge longer but you never really get away from frequent sharpening. Even for a small (6-8"" or so) bowl and assuming I use the same gouge throughout, I'm going to sharpen a minimum of three times each bowl:   When I begin Right before the final cut(s) on the outside Right before final cut(s) on the inside   And in all likelihood, there will be a couple other sharpenings in addition to the above minimum schedule, because I'd say 90% of the time something isn't quite going my way, a fresh edge fixes the problem.  So I encourage you to upgrade tools but don't think that constant sharpening will be a thing of the past after you do. It's more like going from sharpening 7 or 8 times per bowl to 3 or 4."
turning,33kiuj,tigermaple,2,Thu Apr 23 19:15:22 2015 UTC,I agree and have seen a lot of videos about this I just didn't ever see this type of tear out before. I'm going to have to invest in some better tools for sure.

Not only will it plug with sap and water but it will restrict your movement by tethering you with a hose.  On a serious note, i can see a lawsuit waiting to happen the first time someone is turning something large and it catches. Normally you can let go, step back, and look out. Now you have to watch for a flying vacuum, PVC, Hose, and whatever else its attached to it. I hope this does not become a trend with new turners, someone could get seriously hurt."
turning,33h6zp,BruceWayneWoodArtist,3,Wed Apr 22 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"I doubt it will be. I suspect that most new turners like myself are going to be too enamored with carbide tools.

turning,33h6zp,grauenwolf,2,Wed Apr 22 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had some similar thoughts, it's just a bad idea all around. Even without the vacuum, this is not a good shape for a bowl gouge - it will be prone to catches and not very strong if it does catch (basically the same shape/ same problems as using a spindle roughing gouge on a bowl). So I agree, I hope this doesn't become a trend and I also hope beginners don't see this and get the idea that they can just make gouges out of 3/4"" pipe."

I could see a bad catch (especially on side grain projects such as a bowl), causing the pipe to bend or break, leading to serious injury. Learning to turn is challenging enough without having to work around questionable tools.   Don't get me wrong, there's definitely plenty of situations in which making your own tool is perfectly valid (a lot of guys around here have made their own carbide insert scrapers for example), but I don't think a pipe gouge is one of them. There are plenty of inexpensive (but still pretty good) gouges out there. Let me know your budget and the projects you want to work on and I'll post some recommendations."

To put that in non-science speak, We're pretty sure the emerald ash borer is going to kill all the ash trees native to North America.  Like, what we have here is an extinction-level event, the sort of thing that happened to American Chestnut (Castanea dentata) in the early 1900's.  About three billion (says Wikipedia) chestnut trees died in the blight, and approximately 7.5 billion ash trees are at risk (the entire genus) in the United States.  So, when you consider great tragedies of forestry and you think stuff like the Chestnut Blight and Dutch Elm Disease only happen in history back and not in these our modern times, remember that a genus-level extinction event is happening to ash trees RIGHT NOW in our forests."

It's very forgiving. Some woods just tearout a lot and you'll spend more time sanding than turning. Some woods, you'll spend an hour turning it and it just looks like a polished piece of yellow pine. I get that practice is great, but at some point, especially just starting out, you'll need some positive feedback by taking something off the lathe and going ""Wow! That's so beautiful."".   Turningblanks.net is a great place for cheap, good wood. You can get kiln dried or green wood. You're correct - green wood will take patience. I only just started buying and harvesting green wood since I've got a mill and a solar kiln for my normal flat woodworking. Even then, I have a large backlog of dried wood to start turning.   Glue ups are certainly an option. Rainbow poplar or just poplar from your average Lowe's/Home Depot will serve you well for that, but make sure you read up on the glue ups. Voids and uneven surfaces can cause problems.  Best of luck, and I can't wait to see what you start turning!"

Walnut is very pretty as well, and typically lower on the cost side for 2"" thick boards, but it can be rougher to turn than cherry or maple.

Soft maple, on the other hand, often has very nice visible grain (even more so than hard maple) so your end result will be prettier on average.  Find a lumberyard that sells hardwoods and buy some kiln-dried 8/4 soft maple, cut it into squares, and make some shallow bowls from it.  The width of the bowls will be determined by the width of the board.    You mentioned nothing local, but look on craigslist as well.

To expand on why this is true, chuck jaws are machined (on a metal lathe) as one solid circle, then sliced in to quarters. So, the true circle diameter is just like the picture you posted shows- with the jaws barely open, reflecting the amount of material that was removed by slicing the solid circle in to quarters. This picture ought to be in the sidebar! (along with a few of the other fine points about tenon formation of course)."

turning,335t07,Obversa,5,Sun Apr 19 20:43:25 2015 UTC,"Pine is bad its sappy and tears out badly.  Get some maple to practice on.   best advice I'm giving you is find a local turning club.  on the sidebar is a link to the aaw site that lists local clubs.  join and let them know your new.  they should have a mentor to help you get started and access to a lathe temporarily till you get your own.  also my club has raffles where people bring in wood and give it away. turning wands is pretty straight forward as far as a skill set goes. a good spindle gouge, a roughing gouge, and a skew should be all you need for tools.  you will soon need a detail gouge for small intricate parts but a skew can do most of that. when buying a lathe though look for something with enough room between centers to turn the longest thing minus like 6 inches.  so if you want a 20 inch wand you need about a 26 inch between centers.    any lathe you go and look at make sure that the centers line up.  this will matter a lot with spindle turning especially long thin items.  you will most likely need a steady rest if you want to go real thin."

But using two different kinds of wood, it might have happened anyway. Another idea could be internal stress of the wood. Did you glue up the entire boards and then turn it? There may have been internal stresses in the boards, and when you hollowed out the bowl you reduced each board's capacity to resist those stresses which lead to deformation/cracking. Just a thought."

turning,32xt0v,givemehellll,6,Fri Apr 17 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, I think it'll work just fine, but it's usually even better to leave mass in the center as long as you can, helps control vibration. Here's a comment I posted in a thread a little while ago that asked essentially this same thing (why don't people hollow using Forstner bits?):   A few things I can think of as to why it isn't common practice.   Once you're fast enough with a bowl gouge, it's more of a chore to set up a Jacobs chuck and drill bit than to just hollow with a gouge. Sharpening is a 10 second job at most once you've got it down. I'm approaching this level of overall speed myself and the pros that turn bowls all day long are way beyond it. It would remove first the part of the bowl I'd rather keep the longest. Even if I'm not going to use the tailstock for support (and most of my work on bowls these days is in the 8"" - 10"" range, not big enough to fool with the tailstock either), I like having the middle in there for the mass and stability it adds. Here's a pic of a typical bowl of mine in the middle of hollowing and another. I leave that mass in the middle and go down the inside in steps - getting the first 1"" or so deep to final thickness before moving on to the next. Leaving the middle keeps the rim from flexing as much as it would if the middle were removed first. All those cuts are just more of an opportunity to practice gouge skills. You can get a feel for each piece of wood and practice new cuts and approaches on material that's ultimately going to be removed and therefore is of no consequence (other than safety) if you get a catch trying something new. Overall drilling with a large bit just strikes me as less fun! :)    context"

turning,32u22s,llama111,4,Thu Apr 16 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"I have one of these (they are sold under a million brands, all coming from the same factory).  They are a great tool for the money and I have got a lot of use out of mine.  You can use it for wood turning - hold wood in the chuck, turn on, apply chisel.  But you shouldn't.  Getting a proper place to rest the chisel is a constant issue, so while with a little messing about you can make a simple x to get the job you are wanting done, you will learn nothing but bad habits about wood turning.  If you want to do wood turning, spend the money on a wood lathe, I am sure that you will be able to get something entry level for a similar amount of money eventually.  If you have a spare $150 & somewhere to put it (metal working is dirty), grab it.  The lathes are pretty simple, very well supported, google ""mini lathe"" & are great for making small tools etc that just can't be done without a lathe.  Most of the people who buy them are  noobs (like me) so there are plenty of dumb questions asked and answered.    A lot of the issues (like the lead screw) with the lathe is noobs not spending the time to do the initial setup & tighten everything that the factory should have tightened & tune everything the factory should have tuned.  Nothing that is too difficult, instructions easily found on the web.  The best thing about the lathe is that the tailstock has an MT2 taper, so when you get a live centre, drill chuck etc, you can use those tools in both your wood & metal lathes.  Very handy!"

Some pen turners use a metal lathe since it can be more accurate.  You can make a steady rest and mount it on the cross slide and use standard wood turning tools.  Your not going to turn big items but for smaller stuff it will work ok.  I converted mine to CNC which makes it easier to do curved pieces.

turning,32p0ac,currough,2,Wed Apr 15 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"A little bit of explanation, as /u/Sol_Invictus mentioned the phrase ""cast into polyester resin"" was a bit unclear.  This particular oak tree was being attacked by both Gold Spotted Oak Bore and powderwork beetles at the time of its felling. So, there were a lot of beetle tracks and large voids in the burl. In order to make it turn-able I rough-cut the piece into a circular blank on a bandsaw, and then put it into a mold of slightly larger diameter. The mold then gets filled with a 2-part polyester resin, with a low amount of catalyst to allow it to impregnate all the voids in the wood before it hardens. What's left is a bowl blank of oak burl suspended in resin, which I turn normally.   I'm still sort of new to the whole resin casting thing, so if I've said anything flat-out wrong please let me know!"
turning,32p0ac,adiaa,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:55:20 2015 UTC,This is relevant to my interests. Is there a website that covers how to get started casting with polyester resin??
turning,32p0ac,Sol_Invictus,2,Wed Apr 15 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"There's lots of them. I didn't use any one in particular. Just search google.   Here's my breakdown: You need the actual resin and the matching catalyst. They're usually sold together. To fill the cracks in a piece of burl you'll want to mix it so that it cures as slowly as possible; this means using the minimum amount of catalyst. Be careful not to use less, though, because then the resin won't cure; it'll stay sticky. There should be mixing ratios on the bottle.  Assemble your mold and resin, catalyst, mixing container, and utensil in a very well-lit area. This is really important-the fumes are really bad for you. Pour the resin into your mixing container gently to prevent bubbles, then add your catalyst and stir it in until it's completely mixed (again, gently). Bubbles are the enemy here. Pour the mixture into your mold, and let it cure for 48 or so hours.   When I specifically want to encase a piece of wood in resin, like I did here, I'll put the wood in the mold and pour the resin over it slowly. You want the mold to be as close to the size of your finished piece as possible; wasted resin is expensive and it's gross to have to turn a bunch of resin off the piece.  Advanced techniques: You can mix dyes and coloring agents in before the catalyst. A really cool effect is to mix two colors of resin and pour them into the mold at the same time, so they don't mix completely - you can get some really nice swirl patterns by drawing a mixing stick through them at this point. You can also remove the bubbles by placing the mold (after pouring) into a vacuum chamber.  A final note: this stuff is not food safe, so be careful using it on kitchenware or similar stuff.  Also, I understand our mod frequently does work with resin, so maybe you should be on the lookout for some of /u/Peterb77 's pieces.  edit: corrected ""good safe"" to ""food safe""."
turning,32p0ac,Sol_Invictus,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your note earlier and all the good information.  Is the bowl pictured, the completed bowl or is this the bowl coming out of the resin but before finish turning ... Oh, WAIT!!! ... or did you encase an entire solid piece of wood (IOW, with no roughing-out of the interior) and then turn what you've shown in your photos?  .  Three questions beyond what you've already discussed:   Brands: There's a tone of this polyester resin stuff out there. In your experience is it all pretty much the same? Are there any specific attributes to be sure and look for in picking one? What brand do you use ... and do you use a whole 'system'? The mold: Is this something you buy or make? (And if so, where do you get them or what mataerial do you use) Is the mold destroyed in releasing the resin/wood piece or is there a release agent to be used? Turning: You're saying that this stuff turns essentially like wood? I'm a reasonably experienced turner; just mount it up and go? No Gottchas?   .  Oh, and also thanks for turning out u/Peterb77 : )"
turning,32p0ac,Sol_Invictus,2,Wed Apr 15 21:29:13 2015 UTC,"I trimmed a piece of burl into a solid cylinder on a bandsaw, and then used a cottage cheese container as a mold. That worked in this case because the piece of burl was just slightly smaller than the container. I also included a piece of scrap wood to attach my faceplate to, but if you have a chuck then you don't need to do that. I then had a big blank which consisted of resin with a piece of wood in the center.   Brands: I use ""Composite Resource"" brand polyester resin along with generic polyester resin catalyst that I bought at a local plastic and acrylic supply store. That's all I have experience with.  Mold: As I said above, I usually try to find a disposable container slightly larger than my piece. One warning here is that you should stick to hard plastic; when I was starting out using this stuff I tried to make a mold out of styrofoam, which the liquid resin melted through and poured out all over my bench. That was fun to clean up. I've also heard solo cups do not work.   Turning: It really varies. What Iv'e found is that your success in being able to turn the stuff really depends on hitting that ""sweet spot"" of the amount of catalyst. If you don't use enough, it'll be gummy and tear itself apart. Too much, and it's brittle like glass. If you use the right ratio of catalyst it'll turn in big long wispy shavings. Not exactly like wood, but easy enough.   Thanks for the interest. Maybe next time I make one of these, I should capture the whole process?"

I have always tried to glue it up in one go and never could get it to look good. It really turned out great! She will love it!
turning,32h66f,Porygon_is_innocent,2,Tue Apr 14 00:43:03 2015 UTC,That one trick really makes segmented turning so much easier when you dont have a precise miter gauge (I actually learned it from someone on reddit). Just use little wedges to fill in any gaps between the halves to keep everything tight. Works great. The only issue is that there is another round of glue ups which just makes the whole process even longer.

turning,32g2u0,rightious,3,Mon Apr 13 14:45:18 2015 UTC,"For green wood I typically turn the piece while green and leave the thickness about 10% of the diameter (10"" diameter I'd leave it 1"" thick, 12"" diameter I'd leave 1.2"" thick). Then I'd put it in a paper bag and forget about it for a 6 months to a year."

turning,32g2u0,jclark58,3,Mon Apr 13 15:10:49 2015 UTC,Consistent wall thickness is key. You want uniform wall thickness so that the entire piece dries at the same rate. If the rim is thin and the bottom is thick then the rim will dry much faster than the bottom and will likely crack as the bottom continues to dry. It's also reasonably important to remove the pith if you're doing a side grain bowl as the majority of cracks originate from the pith.
turning,32g2u0,tigermaple,2,Mon Apr 13 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"Cool, Thanks"
turning,32g2u0,givemehellll,3,Mon Apr 13 20:03:33 2015 UTC,"Good tips all around in here so far and I'll just add that a lot of the drying schedule and what you have to do to prevent cracking is more an art than a science and is highly dependent on the humidity and other conditions of where you are located.   For example, I'm in Colorado, where it is very dry, and if I want to rough turn and save a blank for later, I generally have to coat the whole thing, inside and out, with green wood end sealer. It will crack almost overnight here if I left off the sealer and just went with the paper bag method (which works great for other people in other climates).  Last year I had some cottonwood that I roughed turned the biggest piece to about 11"" diameter / 1"" wall thickness and the cottonwood lost moisture faster than any other wood that I've worked with and was ready to go for a bone-dry second turn in just three months.  So, pay attention to the good tips given so far here (consistent wall thickness and removing the pith go a long way) and start experimenting around for what works in your climate, it's a fun undertaking and you come out the other side with a much better understanding of the nature of wood in general.  My favorite is going green to done in one step and just letting them warp. If you get em down to 3/8"" or so or less quick enough they generally won't crack. Here's a couple I did last year this way. One of these did crack a little but I think that had to do more with the extremely lively character of that blank!"
turning,32g2u0,ThaFilth,2,Mon Apr 13 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"Very cool, Thanks"
turning,32g2u0,givemehellll,3,Tue Apr 14 18:07:25 2015 UTC,"Theres a couple different ways. Just as jclark58 said you can rough turn it and keep it in a bag with shavings. You can also rough turn it, then seal the outside with endgrain sealer, and put it on the shelf. You can also turn it to a final thickness (should be relatively thin), then use suran/ plastic wrap around the outside leaving it to breathe to the inside of the bowl. After about 10 days itll be warped and wonky, hand sand and put some finish on it."
turning,32gf6p,Mikedealer,3,Mon Apr 13 16:19:37 2015 UTC,"A few things:   Easy Wood Tools is kind of the ubiquitous manufacturer of carbide turning tools. Most of the carbide inserts you'll find are based on their tools (see the EWT logo in the corner of the inserts on the second link you posted). I would highly recommend choosing or making a tool which is compatible with these inserts. The replacement inserts for the tool on the third link you posted are hilariously poor quality (http://www.pennstateind.com/store/LXPMXX.html). I can't even believe that put that picture on their store. Lots of people make their own tools, because (as you said) they're pretty simple. At the most basic, you can tap a hole in some bar stock and screw on an insert. Just search this sub for several examples of this. One contributor to this subreddit (/u/kiltedcajun) runs a website (www.wolframcarbide.com) selling discounted carbide inserts which are the same size/shape as the Easy Wood Tools inserts.

turning,32e8is,gradyh,3,Mon Apr 13 12:07:13 2015 UTC,"Okay here's a diagram to go with my other response.  You can see that you start with the length of a single segment. But then from there on, you can't just add each additional length since they overlap. So you have to subtract the overlapping length (shown as a dashed line) from each segmented after the first. But, since your saw kerf takes up some of the board, you also have to add that length to each segment.  Here's an example: Say you are making a twelve-segment ring, where each segment is 4"" long and 2"" wide. You'll need a 2"" wide board that is at least 43.5"" long.  b = 4 + (12 - 1)*[4 - 2*tan(15) + .125/cos(15)]"
turning,32e8is,givemehellll,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:36:45 2015 UTC,"to simplify it, if you knew the size of your segment, couldnt you just do: [short side] + [long side] x [#of segments] / [2]? do that for each ring, then add up the rings for each?"
turning,32e8is,gradyh,2,Mon Apr 13 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea. It gets you close, but it underestimates just a bit since both ends don't have an overlapping segment and it doesn't incorporate the blade kerf. If you were to use this formula, I think I would add another 5-10% just to stay on the safe side.  Also, I cut my segments based on the longer side, so I never know what the short length will be before cutting unless I actually do the trigonometry or draw it in CAD software."

I've used the big Powermatic and a little Jet, but I'd take my Nova again 100 times. I had the spindle lock fall off since it's not the best design (spin to lock/unlock, but it also spins to come off), but I make do. I hear it's easy to replace - just haven't.  I've put a lot of miles on this lathe, and it's still smooth and dead even. I love that it spins from 100 RPM to 5,000 RPM. The swivel headstock allows for a 30-something"" outboard capacity, which I far favor over the sliding ones from Jet and PM since I'm a little bit of a cramped shop. I can flip it around and it basically sticks out of the garage door instead of me having to move the dust collector. I don't use any of the program modes, but I am going to start soon. The motor is silly smooth. Everything is solid and sturdy, but I think I will bolt it to the ground once it has a permanent home since I tend to turn BIG rough pieces. It's sturdy enough to let me sit on the bed while I hollow and not worry about anything. I know you can get an extension, but I tend to turn sub-12"" long pieces. Certainly sub 24. Everything is big and sturdy and just feels and looks great. I'd recommend it to everyone. I love PM for a lot of things, but I think that they kinda phone in the lathes. They could be doing much more. Nova does that much more. I can get some photos when I go back to my shop. You'll have to excuse the layers of Mylands and whatnot I have on it, though. It still works just as well! Plus, I just don't think you can beat Nova customer service. They're absolutely amazing. They bend backwards for me both when I had issues with my Infinity chuck (why it was recalled) and when I phoned in about my spindle lock falling off.   It comes with that big plate for the front of it with ""NOVA 2024 TEKNATOOL"" on it... Mine has it because I think it looks cool. Easy to take off or just not put on. It has rubber gasket things to prevent rattling, but it is a little odd to put the big skirt with an ad on it.   Cast iron, weighs a ton, takes two people at least to move it, and I love that."

Mainly I've been curious about it because there's another guy on here that has tried several lathes and said something along the lines of the DVR XP was his favorite headstock and motor ever because of how smooth it is but that the rest of the machine wasn't beefy enough.  I have the PM3520b and I know what you mean by ""phone it in."" Don't get me wrong, overall I love it, but there is so much more they could have done in terms of fit and finish. I think they finally got it right with the new(ish) 4224b- that lathe has a lot of the features I wish mine did, like a spindle lock that isn't cheesy, an actual indexing system instead of the dumbass screw hole thing the 3520 has, and better clamping mechanisms on the headstock and the banjo. Not to mention an integrated vacuum chuck. Maybe some of these features will find their way in to a future iteration of the 3520?"
turning,326i8y,doombuggy110,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with that other guy. The DVR is just silly smooth it is, and the interface is nice and not complex. Sure, holding the button down to increase speed is a little clunkier than a nice dial, but when you figure you can set modes if you aren't lazy, it's nice. Not sure about the beefy comment. I'd say it's only a tiny bit less beefy than a PM, but it's also entirely cast iron, including the super heavy and thick bed, tailstock, banjo... We'll see! I'll put some of my Thompson tools against it for scale.  Integrated vacuum chuck?! How cool! The Nova certainly isn't ""feature-bloated""... But I kinda learned my lesson across everything - cycling, scuba, cell phones - that feature bloat just gets in the way of the item doing what it's really made to do by distracting you from the flaws by saying ""Sure, it doesn't index at all properly, but it's got a vacuum chuck on it!"". But, PM can kinda pull that off nicely."
turning,326i8y,doombuggy110,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:10:04 2015 UTC,I have wetstones for chisels. Would that work? Or do you mean like a benchtop grinder?
turning,326i8y,robobug,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"A dry bench grinder is a must for sharpening turning tools- the sharpening process is very different from what you may be used to from sharpening bench chisels. Lathe gouges almost always have to have a completely new profile ground initially, then, during the course of even a small project are often sharpened (at the grinder) several times."
turning,326i8y,tigermaple,2,Sat Apr 11 23:34:11 2015 UTC,"Not to mention all the times you accidentally drop your chisel and it takes a tiny gouge out of the wing... Or when you hit a nail and it chips your tool. Because that happens to everyone, right? Right?"
turning,326i8y,tigermaple,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:11:59 2015 UTC,Ahh ok. Well I've thought about getting a bench grinder for awhile anyway....  never have too many tools! I use them at work for sharpening cobalt blades to cut titanium in metal lathes so it shouldn't be an issue.
turning,326i8y,jatjqtjat,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:44:16 2015 UTC,"May be tough. I have a Tormek that I highly recommend, but a grinder will probably be best. You'll reshape and resharpen extremely frequently."

turning,325jvm,lincolnrick,0,Sat Apr 11 14:46:26 2015 UTC,I think the size is good. Much smaller and we're going to lose a lot of detail.
turning,324c5m,warghuul,6,Fri Apr 10 13:57:41 2015 UTC,I would not recommend that lathe. This one by HF is better in every single way and is not that much more expensive. Find a 20% off coupon and the price difference is even less.   http://www.harborfreight.com/5-speed-bench-top-wood-lathe-65345.html
turning,324c5m,jclark58,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:02:32 2015 UTC,Does this one have the alignment issues that I've heard about with the harbor freight lathes? Where the tailstock and headstock are sometimes several mm off?
turning,324c5m,wealy,2,Fri Apr 10 15:39:39 2015 UTC,I've never used either of the lathes being discussed so I can't comment on alignment issues. With pretty much any lathe at this price point there may be fit/finish issues such as bed flatness and alignment. The lathe I linked to is not a $500 Jet but it's significantly closer than the link from OP.
turning,324c5m,jclark58,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"I'm aware if the price/quality issues when compared to bigger brands, I was more curious as a friend has been thinking about purchasing the one that you listed. I'm pretty satisfied with my own setup at the moment"
turning,324c5m,wealy,2,Fri Apr 10 15:53:24 2015 UTC,The tailstock has some wobble but not once you lock it in place.  Nothing that can't be worked around easily.
turning,324c5m,robobug,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"Buying new tools, you usually get what you pay for.   Horrible Fright (my pet name for the store) sells low quality tools for low prices.  If you wanna get started, it's not so bad, but I'd recommend joining the local wood turners association and searching through craigslist. Between those two places a better lathe will be found for a decent price. Edit: grammar"
turning,324c5m,Murphdog024,2,Fri Apr 10 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"In the last 6 months I've had to replace at least 4 tools that were less than a year old that were purchased because the price was right. My suggestion is to save up and get something that will last you a lifetime.   It's a little outdated but holds true. link  I'd throw the new Rikon 70-220 at the top (Biased, just bought one myself). Maybe look at the Nova Comet II? Reviews put it in good light and in the US comes with a chuck (160$ value).   Also keep in mind, tool and sharpening will realistically set you back around 300$ minimum for a basic setup. (PSI HSS tool set, slow speed grinder).  TLDR; Be patient, save, get quality for life and save disappointment later."
turning,324c5m,Narrowuser,2,Fri Apr 10 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  Don't do what I did, which is buy 4 lathes incrementally better than the next until you finally realize that you needed to buy another one that cost what the previous 4 did combined.  The only way you should buy a bottom end lathe like this is if you have no idea if you'll really use it and you just want to find out about the hobby, or if there's no way you could ever scratch the money together to buy a better one.  Even if you're not sure you'll use it I could argue it's a bad idea to buy a cheap one because  using a cheap tool is so much less fun that using a quality tool, and the good ones hold their value if you want to resell it."
turning,324c5m,Imperial_Aerosol_Kid,2,Fri Apr 10 17:19:32 2015 UTC,"I've used what is probably that model for the last couple of years and have to say that it works pretty well.  It's a little underpowered and the bed is short, but if you're just starting out and want to be able to do a lot of spindle turning and/or small bowls, it's hard to go wrong for the price.  The larger one that /u/jclark58 referenced is probably going to be more versatile in the long run for you as it more closely mirrors the features of a Jet midi lathe.  This is just my opinion here, but I think you'd be better off getting a very entry level lathe to start out and be able to spend a few more bucks on some good gouges and sharpening equipment than to drop the big money on a better lathe.  Yes, you're probably going to want a better lathe in the near future but if you get a nice lathe and crappy tools, you're going to lose interest and get frustrated in the hobby.  If you can do both, obviously do both.  If you know you're going to be into this in five years, go for the Jet. You don't often find them used because most people upgrade in addition to rather than instead of, but going to your local turning guild meet ups will definitely put you in touch with folks who can hook you up with good quality used stuff.  Not to mention that their expertise is the most valuable thing you can get when starting out.  For what you're talking about making, I'd think that this lathe is probably going to meet your need for a while.  The rest of know that you won't stop with plugs, though, and that you're going to be making everything else down the road.  TL;DR IMHO, spending on good quality tools you can keep sharp is a better beginning investment than a more expensive lathe."

turning,324c5m,lotus2471,2,Sun Apr 12 12:58:14 2015 UTC,For wood plugs you wont need a duplicator.  that is too much work just a nice set of calipers and a few tools should be fine. Once you get set you can just turn a jig that when the plug is right sldes in and your good.  but honestly once you have made 20 you should be able to repeat them pretty easy by eye.
turning,324c5m,CrimsonKeel,2,Fri Apr 10 19:27:52 2015 UTC,100% agree with this. Using a duplicator on this would go way beyond overkill to lots more trouble than it's worth.

turning,3232ge,Narrowuser,3,Fri Apr 10 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the lathe, I checked it out the last time I was at Woodcraft and it seems like a nice beefy little unit for the money, I'm interested in hearing how it performs over time so keep us posted.  Regarding drying the bowls, the easiest overall drying protocol by far is just to rough turn the blanks in to thick bowl blanks at this point, then seal and set aside to dry for 3-6 months. A good rule of thumb for how thick to leave them so that you still have enough material to turn a round after it dries is about 10% of diameter, so for example, a 10"" diameter bowl blank would need to be left about 1"" thick, 5"" diameter about 1/2"" and so on. I've never worked with heating wax so I don't know how easy it would be to coat a roughed out bowl blank with it.  I do recommend picking up some of the green wood end sealer - you can get it shipped from Rockler, Woodcraft, or Craft Supplies, and it's just the easiest way to go if you're doing lots of green wood. (You could order it and temporarily store these or your bowl roughouts in a plastic bag in the meanwhile). Here are a couple of my previous albums on how I deal with green wood:  splitting the logs rough turning the bowl blanks  Hope this helps!"
turning,3232ge,tigermaple,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:21:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Was a toss up between the 70-220, nova comet 2 and the general international with the swinging headstock. Went with this one  because it had more horsepower (1 v 3/4), better warranty (5 years) and the place I got it from price matched it to a ridiculously low price (Cheaper than the Nova).   Not sure if Rockler/Woodcraft ships to Canada, I'll have to check out Leevalley though. I think for now I'll remove the pith from all the logs, wax the ends and try to find a Canadian store that sells sealer and get an order in. That should give me some time to figure everything out."
turning,3232ge,tigermaple,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"I think you made the right call. I don't know anything about the General, and the Nova is a real nice lathe too, but in addition to all the things you pointed out, the Rikon is I think 30-40 lbs heavier and that's a nice difference as well. I have the Rikon 70-100 (and my Powermatic) and it was a good little lathe for me for many years. Still is, I just don't use it much anymore, but some friends have been interested in learning so I may dust it off for some mini classes here soon, and if needing a 2nd lathe becomes a regular ""thing"" for me, I've got my eye on swapping out for the 70-220."
