malaysia,3e1zwl,OookOok,3,Tue Jul 21 13:47:15 2015 UTC,"(terjemahan)  Penyataan Media oleh Ho Kay Tat, Penerbit dan Ketua Pegawai Eksekutif Kumpulan, The Edge Media Group  Kami tidak boleh mengabaikan sahaja apabila mendapat tahu mengenai rancangan menyeleweng berbilion-bilion ringgit dari Malaysia  Kuala Lumpur, Julai 21, 2015 - The Edge telah membuat laporan menyeluruh mengenai 1 Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) sepanjang 2013 dan 2014 apabila tampak organisasi milik kerajaan itu mengalami masalah kewangan. Maklumat yang ada, walau bagaimana pun, jarang diperoleh dan terhad kerana laporan audit tahunannya sentiasa lambat.  Wartawan kami bertemu dengan pelbagai punca dan meneliti semua maklumat yang berjaya diperoleh untuk mencari perkara sebenar.  Awal tahun ini, kami diberitahu bahawa ada seseorang yang sudi memberi maklumat yang menerangkan usahasama 1MDB dengan PetroSaudi International. Kami tidak diberitahu siapa dia sebelum bertemu dengannya,  Dia yang tidak akan kami namakan menunjukkan beribu-ribu email dan dokumen berkaitan. Kami membaca ratusan daripadanya dan percaya bahawa dokumen-dokumen itu sahih dari jumlahnya yang sangat banyak dan dari rantaian email tersebut. Seterusnya kami mendapatkan pengesahan dari pakar forensik IT yang mengesahkan bahawa tidak ada sebarang sebab untuk percaya yang maklumat email-email dan dokumen-dokumen dipalsukan.  Apa yang kami baca mengejutkan kami. Apa yang sepatutnya usahasama yang bakal membawa manfaat ekonomi kepada negara adalah suatu rancangan menyeleweng berbilion ringgit dari Malaysia oleh sekumpulan orang Malaysia dan rakan luar negara mereka.  Pada saat itu, kami mempunyai dua pilihan:  1) Mengabaikan perkara ini keseluruhannya, atau  2) Mendapatkan semua maklumat untuk mencari perkara sebenar.  Kami membuat keputusan untuk mencari kebenaran.  Sebagaimana kata-kata Tun Dr Mahathir Mohammad, Tun Musa Hitam dan Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah baru-baru ini, mereka yang mempunyai maklumat yang membawa kepada kebenaran mestilah memberitahu perkara sebenar dan tidak memalingkan muka. Tidak memaklumkan mengenai sesuatu salah laku adalah satu kesalahan.  Bahkan Perdana Menteri Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak dan Timbalan Perdana Menteri Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin turut menyatakan yang mereka ingin mendapatkan perkara sebenar.  Sebagai sebuah kumpulan media, kami percaya bahawa kami mempunyai tanggungjawab awam tidak kira betapa susah atau bahaya ianya terhadap kami.  Berjumpa dengan sumber untuk mengumpul maklumat adalah perkara yang sentiasa dilakukan oleh ahli professional media sepanjang masa dalam pencarian wacana. Tiada apa yang salah atau tersorok mengenainya.  Kami tidak terlibat dengan sebarang kecurian, kami tidak membuat bayaran kepada sesiapa, dan kami tidak mengubahsuai mana-mana email-email dan dokumen-dokumen yang diberi kepada kami. Malah kami telah memastikan data-data tersebut tidak boleh diubahsuai. Hal ini boleh disahkan oleh pihak berkuasa.  Sebahagian dari maklumat-maklumat tersebut telah digunakan dalam artikel-artikel yang kami telah terbitkan sepanjang beberapa bulan yang lepas. Sebahagiannya terlampau sensitif untuk digunakan. Tiada artikel yang diterbitkan telah dicabar oleh sesiapa yang dinamakan dalam artikel-artikel tersebut.  Sebenarnya, kami percaya bahawa artikel-artikel kami banyak membantu agensi-agensi kerajaan yang sedang meneliti 1MDB.  Jalan paling mudah untuk kami selepas mendapat maklumat ini adalah mengabaikannya. Kenapa cari masalah? Tetapi kami tidak boleh berbuat demikian.  Kami memilih jalan yang sukar, jalan yang kami tahu dipenuhi risiko kepada kami sendiri dan kepada organisasi kami, yang mana sekarang berhadapan dengan tindakan oleh Kementerian Dalam Negeri.  Isnin, kami menyerahkan dokumen-dokumen, email bercetak dan satu cakera keras kepada Bank Negara. Hari ini, set yang sama diserahkan kepada Jabatan Siasatan Jenayah Komersil (CCID), Polis Diraja Malaysia. Saya juga telah memberikan penyataan kepada CCID.  Kami berasa lapang kerana pelbagai penyiasat, Ketua Audit Negara, Jawatankuasa Kira-kira, Bank Negara, pihak Polis, Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia dan Peguam Negara telah memberi komitmen mereka untuk mencari perkara sebenar tanpa gentar atau pilih kasih.  Ia, sebenarnya, adalah tanggungjawab dan tugas mereka terhadap rakyat Malaysia untuk berbuat demikian, sebagaimana ianya tanggungjawab kami untuk mencari cerita sebenarnya.

Malaysia on the other hand is still pretty livable even if it is very bad. Unemployment at 3% will not get enough people to riot on the streets.

In fact when it happened, the Indonesian economy look like it was improving. It wasn't actually the low point prior to the riots in May 14.  While the economy in Malaysia is in much better shape than Indonesia's in 1998, there is much more racially charged language in Malaysia than there was in Indonesia in 1998. The Indonesian government or affiliated parties weren't using the anti-Chinese card, in Malaysia they are."
malaysia,3e0oyl,GavinZac,2,Tue Jul 21 02:25:04 2015 UTC,This is a very good point as well.
malaysia,3e0oyl,malaysianlah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:21:36 2015 UTC,The asian financial crisis had nothing to do with race riots. The impetus for the crisis was a large group of investor that saw an opportunity to short many asian currencies and the rupia in particular for financial gain and the subsequent run on the banking systems by the local populous. Indonesia and thailand in particular lacked robust financial structures to deal with the fall out and form the runs and shorting of currencies.
malaysia,3e0oyl,throwaway12ki876,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"Did I say the race riots caused the Asian Financial Crisis? Let me explain to you what happened.  In Indonesia's case the political situation was tied with the economic one.  Let me give you a break down.  The Rupiah was doing  US$ = Rp 5000-6000, until about the first week of January 1998.  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IDR_USD_exchange_1997-07-02_to_1998-05-21.png  Then Suharto bulked on economic reforms and started talking about currency board. Shortly after signing the IMF agreement he wanted Habibie as VP, that cause the Rupiah to tumble even further.  Indonesia going into the crisis wasn't as exposed as Thailand.  The political situation in Indonesia account for why it did much worse than Thailand.  IF Suharto had stuck with IMF reforms and put Tri Sutrisno as VP, the Rupiah would have been at US$ Rp5000-6000.  And Indonesia could have avoided the May 1998 riots and transition to democracy.  The May riots in 1998 most likely postponed the recovery of the Indonesian economy by 2-3 years. It worsened Indonesia situation considerably.  Why many Chinese Indonesians just stopped doing business. The Chinese Indonesians hold on the economy is strong, not because their network stretches all the way down to village level.  Do you want to bet that if people were to go burn down Lowyat shop[ping complex tomorrow and kill 1000 Chinese, it would only have a small impact on the Malaysian's economy? What does a 1000 dead Chinese mean really? Human beings aren't rational.  Already Malaysia has been suffering illegal capital flight over the last decade.  As I explained 50% of drop in the Rupiah from Rp 2250 to Rp 10000 was due to political instability (risk factor), this exacerbated the economic fundamentals.    When rating agencies rate current debt many of the calculations aren't based on economic factors, but political and historical ones."

malaysia,3e0oyl,imaginician,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:31:40 2015 UTC,"As someone who has lived in Thailand, a lot of people don't understand the hidden costs of moving to another country even if it has a low cost of living. You, unlike virtually every Thai, have not spent your teenage years saving for a car/bike there, don't have an uncle to rent a cheap apartment from (indeed, you are restricted to more expensive 'foreigner' condos), don't have a way to get a quick easy job to tide you over (you can have an illegal, back breaking job on a building site, or a legal job in a school with high starting costs); most of all, you don't speak Thai, so unless the Thai-Chinese feel like being extra friendly and understanding, every negotiated purchase you make (and that's virtually all of them, in Bangkok) will be heavily weighted in favour of the vendor."

malaysia,3e2srn,stormy001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:50 2015 UTC,"lol, is it time of the year to paint the vernacular schools as the source of all evils, again?    MyKMU’s writer said it was obvious that Syefura had not read the Constitution properly. “Otherwise, she would have found out that Chinese vernacular schools were supposed to be abolished 10 years after independence.”   I am not aware of this, maybe the MyKMU should provide proofs? Oh wait, perhaps they can't because they are pulling it out of their a-hole?   “What has the Malays not compromised on?”    My apology because I must be dumb for not seeing the compromise the Malays made in regards to vernacular schools. Enlighten me, please? Vernacular schools are partially funded and available to ALL races, unlike certain fully funded schools that are available only to them, and the first class citizens they belonged to.    Go anywhere in the world and see whether you can find such a proliferation of schools where education is conducted in languages other than the official language.   Go anywhere in the world and see whether you can find such a proliferation of privileges being given out to the majority.    “Is there any other country where the Chinese are allowed to dominate the economy, the media, infrastructures, the construction industry and the gambling trade to the extent that they control 70% of the nation’s wealth?”   I will need proof to every single one of such claims. And don't BS me with the ""top 10 wealthy Malaysians are Chinese"" rhetoric."

I am not aware of this, maybe the MyKMU should provide proofs? Oh wait, perhaps they can't because they are pulling it out of their a-hole?   10 years is a number I cannot find anywhere, but vernaculars were never intended to be a permanent fixture. That is just facts.   “(2) Where at any time the Minister is satisfied that a National-type primary school may suitably be converted into a National primary school, he may be order direct that the school shall become a National primary school.” - Education Act 1961 21(2)   .   My apology because I must be dumb for not seeing the compromise the Malays made in regards to vernacular schools.    No, you are not dumb, but you probably do not look at it the way a Malay might look at it, which I don't blame you for I suppose.   The Malays hold the view, shared by most of the majority populations of countries of the rest of the world, that the minority should, at the very least, if not integrate, speak the language of the majority as maybe a first language or with such fluency for it to be indistinguishable from a first language.  The compromise here is that the Malays have allowed the non-Malays to, not just speak their own language, but have also enabled institutions which will allow for the proliferation of a foreign language in place of the majority language.   This may not be what you view as an adequate compromise, but it is the viewpoint of the nationalists, and I'm just telling you this because whatever. It's not really meant to change your view or anything."
malaysia,3e2srn,Thesket,3,Tue Jul 21 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"Great points, my man.   Though I might add that vernacular schools, at least the Chinese ones, are often  picked for the perceived better quality in education (As/student ratio thought to be higher, competitive) and the increased importance of the Chinese language are the primary reasons why they are chosen over national schools.   Not to disagree with you, just pointing out to any curious readers who may hold the perception that vernacular schools are picked for chauvinistic reasons."
malaysia,3e2srn,sikballa,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"To piggy back on that, the increasing of religious influence at an alarming rate in national schools, is also one of the many reasons why parents prefer vernacular schools.

malaysia,3e3dwk,EinsteinTheory,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly there's no guarantee what the landscape of our country will be in the coming months. You can ask again when you're actually about to come over.   For the time being, know that there is no actual anti-chinese movement. If anything, my humble opinion is that there is an ever growing pro-malay movement that's bigger than any anti-chinese ones. The civics bureau slides and keris wielding politician are among the few events that have been pointing towards this. My tinfoilhat observation is that the LYIncident is more likely an accident-cum-opportune exercise at recruiting more members to the cause.  That said, no race riot is going to happen at this time. People are still either too comfortable or have been conditioned to suck it up as the minority; likewise the progressives have been stepping up their game and hopefully that will elicit some change. Crime will be on the rise however as the whole country's upper management continue to argue over the money business and not bothering with the ills in the lower rung society. Even if that gets settled the fallout is probably going to take weeks before whoever's left in the seat decides to steer the country again.   tldr; no anti-chinese movement, no race riots predicted in the near future, racial tensions a little higher but still not in the red. expect more crime however and expect the unexpected."

Seems to be the kind of thing these days in many other places just that in Malaysia it can get blown out because it is easier to divide and control the population.

They have, very unfortunately, popped their head up a few times recently, partly because our country is going through some unprecented tension right now, and some Malaysians have a tendency to view things through a racial lens.  For the most part, you will be safe. The Low Yat incident is a rather extreme and unprecedented situation that has not occurred for quite some time, and we hope won't happen again. So don't worry, know where it's not safe for you and don't go there.  P.S. I won't discount the possibility of protests of any kind happening, due also to the current political turmoil. This may be more likely due to efforts to unseat the Prime Minister and are not racially based.

In saying that, I am in agreement that using a racial description isn't particularly helpful given it doesn't bring us any closer to identifying the perpetrator. It's an interesting discussion and has been discussed elsewhere before. There's a case to say race be mentioned when it's part of a detailed description of the suspect, but a bit questionable when used as the singular identifier of a suspect.

Any media should be presented in an accurate way and let viewers come to their own conclusions. It most certainly does not make him a scum.  You might say the race is irrelevant to you in this video, and you are entitled to your opinion. But you can't imply OP has bad intentions by simply stating what happens in the video.

Again, had OP said something disparaging about indians in general, then I'm with you.

As it is, the YT video didn't say the perpetrators were Indians, he came up with that idea by himself.   The point that can't seem to go through your racially-charged head is that we don't need to add unnecessary details when there isn't any need or benefits from doing so. What does it help you to know that they were <insert-race>? So you can rally your people against them? You are okay with this because you are probably getting the blunt end of the stick when it comes to racial wars; all these racial headlines are probably giving you a boner because why not, it's justice for your people.  But take it from me, I've spent my years around the world, and the world is more at peace when people would focus on getting to the crux of the matter (in this case, the robbery) and a lot less on the race of the criminals.  But you continue being racist and all, I am sure it would be good for Malaysia. I'm done having this conversation,  racists can never see the error of their ways."

You're understandably unhappy at the state of racial affairs in this country, so are a lot of people.  What I'm trying to say is we shouldn't jump to the conclusion that OP is a scum by merely adding that title. It also doesn't make much sense to say he's inciting hatred, when the crime is committed against Indian store owners. Any rational person will just take it as added information to the video. Some people will see the video as  a reminder of the plight of majority poor Indians and quality of education in the country. Some people will think ""Indians are scums of the earth"".  Like I said before, bigots will be bigots, and simple omitting race in the title won't change that fact. I would agree with you that some people DO purposely spread hate among races, and they deserve to be condemned. But OP's post seems innocuous enough to me. To each his own I guess."

This whole Lowyat thing would not have blown out of proportion if race was not mentioned in the first place. This is the case of the media finding news where there wasn't any as it was just case of a thief who got angry that he got caught and wanted revenge; and to top it off, the silly little cuntish Xian and Jamal finding the opportunity to show their true racial self.  You are racist, you may not know it or are being in denial, but you really are racially-charged. You identify people with race, you seem to pass judgement on other based on their race first and foremost.   Tell you what kid, take this as an advice from a well-traveled person. Racism can be solved when you do not make every issue a racial issue. The video as posted by the OP? Just a robbery case, regardless of race. The Lowyat issue? Just a thief getting angry that he was caught.

malaysia,3e05x5,Aemilia,2,Tue Jul 21 04:52:53 2015 UTC,"Diet influences about 80% of weight loss, while exercise accounts for the remaining 20%. The number is low because exercise builds heavy muscles. The upside is muscles burn more calories so it's good for long term weight control.   As for food, the closer something is to its natural state, the better. Eg. Fresh tomato is better than canned tomatoes. Fresh mango vs dried mango etc.  The less processed, the better.   In my case, reducing sugar from my diet helped broke the weight plateau I was experiencing. I have a low tolerance towards sweetness now, which is nice. Working on reducing salt intake now."

They base this on e-mails that they believe talk about the plot, and what they believe are inconsistencies in accounting and statements by those involved.  They also identify who they believe is involved, how they believe it was done, and what they believe was also done to cover it up.  They have since given copies of the information they are basing all this on to the authorities.  They also have a disclaimer saying that they can't publish everything they are basing these allegations on.  However, I personally feel that they have left out some important things that should have been published to strengthen their case."

Not a single opposition leader has been accused of stealing hundreds of millions of RM, no opposition leader has been accussed of multi-million RM fiasco like NFC, 1MDB, SRC, PKFZ, KLIA2. Penang has been well run for over 6 years, Selangor is relatively scandal free compared to the years under Khir Toyol"
malaysia,3dwbvu,zul200289,-9,Mon Jul 20 08:10:49 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.  Most of the accusations are still pending trial and majority are found to be lies and unfounded.   ..and Penang/DAP also isn't 'Clean':   1) RM300M spent on ""feasibility studies"" for underground tunnel pretty much turned out nothing. The company given the tender simply said, ""Nah, we can't do it."" And left. And the Penang gov isn't doing anything about it. If only somebody would attack LGE relentlessly and divulge all the money trail of that company. 2) Spent RM30M on a bicycle trail that should only cost RM6M. Again, I'd like to see what company that have been given the tender and the money trail as well. 3) Not excluding the timber projects in Kelantan, given to companies of DAP politicians (by PAS probably), which ultimately resulted in the worst banjir in years in Kelantan.   The only difference is that BN doesn't have someone who digs the dirt out of those DAP politicians or a full-time fitnah-er that hatches out fitnahs to attack DAP or PKR every day.   In fact, it's kinda unheard of BN accusing any other parties without any backing evidences. (Yes, including the Anwar sodomy case, there's lot of solid evidence backing those accusations).  ....And Penang isn't being run well either (even if you assume they're 'clean'):   1) State administrative expenditures have tripled (200%) ever since DAP came into power.. Federal gov only increased by 42%. 2) To cover the expenditures, they sold off their lands. Since DAP came into power, state owned land have decreased from 18% to 6%. 3) DAP also have increased tax and license fees on the peniaga and companies and memperkenalkan weird tax such as 'Cukai Katil'. 4) Water bill increased several times while DAP in power. Water bill have never increased for 24 years while Gerakan/BN was in charge. 5) Not enough low-cost housing. Most of the housing projects are high-cost. When federal wants to build low-cost housing, DAP blocks the effort. 6) Penang's FDI goes down yearly. And they've got the balls to blame the feds on this, when it is DAP themselves that go to other countries to badmouth Malaysia.   The only reason the Penang rakyat doesn't feel the costs yet is because all of the increasing costs are being pushed to the peniaga and businesses, of whom the owners are in the minority. Once the bubble burst, it's going to be chaos there. In fact, it's going to be hard for the new govt to turn things around once DAP loses the election later. Well, actually, yup, people are already feeling the heat over in Penang.  ...And I have no need to go into details of Selangor governance. No water. Sampah everywhere. Dengue everywhere. And they're still blaming somebody else for their incompetence.  ..and with those points, I'll say 'Not Much Better' is actually a very generous view of how the opposition are running the management.   Personally, I'll say 'They are even worse than when BN is govt'. The only thing good about the current opposition is that they could weed out all the useless and dirty politicians on the BN side and keep them on their toes. As a government? Nope, no way."

I didn't say all of their accusations were lies and baseless, which is why I said it's good that they will put BN people on their toes and get rid of the useless and dirty ones.  ...But considering their record, everything they say might as well be all lies and baseless accusations.   And having baseless accusations definitely have a negative impact on the country.   The Tabung Haji one was one of the worse. Due to Lapiji's baseless accusation, the highly valued land is given to an Indonesian company. If you don't know about this, let me refresh you:   Tabung Haji won the bid with RM500M Lapiji accuse TH of bailing out 1MDB. Zombies get angry. 1MDB awards the tender to Indon company instead, at RM700M.   Here's the logic. Lapiji claims TH is bailing out 1MDB. This already doesn't make sense because TH wouldn't have won the tender in the first place if the reason TH won is to bail 1MDB. 1MDB should have immediately given the tender to the Indon company in the first place without considering TH.  The implication? Now foreigners get the right to develop the land there. Due to Lapiji's crooked values, he'd rather a foreigner win an important contract rather than a Malaysian just to win some brownie points with his fanboys.  Still can't believe how they could still have credibility with all of their lies."

malaysia,3dwbvu,ShinyMetalBum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:51 2015 UTC,"I read through the thing and here are a few thoughts:    1MDB did not hire its own independent valuer to do the valuation    1MDB's management shouldn't have done that, especially since their own Board told them to look for an independent valuer.  What The Edge doesn't address is whether or not 1MDB used government valuers.  This is important, because 1MDB is a fully owned government company and I suspect they're required under the Ministry of Finance's rules of procurement to use government valuations as the ultimate yardstick for things like this, with external valuations used as a reality check only.  So, 1MDB could have used the services of Jabatan Penilaian dan Pengurusan Harta, especially if the valuation by this Edward Morse could not be received in time to execute the deal.   The scheme to scam US$700 million from 1MDB was discussed as “over payment” in various email exchanges and attachments   Yeah, that's pretty damning... provided there is no reasonable context for it.  For example, expedition of works or whatever that may give good reason for an advance transfer of the RM 700 million.  But without anything further than what The Edge is telling us, said possible context is just speculation and needs to be shown by Jho Low and company if they want to be exonerated of the charge.   the letter of demand for repayment of the US$700 million loan was not needed but only “necessary for your docs to legitimise pre-payment   Ties in with the above.  Again, without any context, it looks pretty damning to me, but there is a possibility - which, I stress, needs to be proven by Buckland and company - that this is being carried out to expedite works or some kind of problem.   BNM approved payment to the account of the JV Co at JP Morgan Suisse (SA) and not to anyone else.   Very important point to keep in mind.   Patrick Mahony, the CEO of the JV Co, said that they were all part of the same company. He lied   This is the first instance in the The Edge article that I start having skeptical thoughts.  ""He lied"" is not good enough.  The Edge must prove that Good Star and the JV are completely unrelated, whether legally or practically (as in they must not be part of a consortium carrying out whatever project they were supposed to do).  The Edge must stress that the JV never issued anything like a letter of undertaking instructing 1MDB to make payments to Good Star's accounts.   If Good Star was part of PetroSaudi why was there a need to do this?   Possible answer: Establishment of paper trails and good accounting practices.    Even if Good Star is a child company of PetroSaudi (and that is almost certainly isn't true; I'm just using the example for exaggeration here), Tarek Obaid wouldn't be allowed to randomly take USD 85 million out of Good Star's coffers for PetroSaudi's use without some reason that can be put down in an account book.  That would be CBT or embezzlement because those two companies would legally be different entities.  Instead, if a parent company needs to transfer money in/out of a child company, they need to make some kind of transaction to record the transfer, and the reason can be basically anything from a generic ""Services Rendered"" to ""beer, blackjack, and hookers"".   The metadata of this document in an email attachment showed Jho Low to be the last person to save this file   Meaningless.  Without an electronic signature, there's no way you can be sure that Jho Low himself was really the last person to save the file, instead of someone else with a Word program that has Jho Low's name registered as the user.  People really should be more careful about throwing metadata around as proof positive of something, because it's pretty trivial to fake nowadays.  I can't say anything about the rest of the article.  It's all based on The Edge's data which we don't have access to anyway, so let's just assume that they at least did the math properly.   We have a duty to find and report the truth   Yes.  However, what The Edge is doing now is effectively the same as naming a rape suspect and referring to him as ""the rapist"" long before the court case or even investigation is concluded.  It's trial by media and public opinion, and I find that to be horrendously unfair.  Imagine if the suspect is found to be innocent in court; how many of you really honestly believe that the general populace will be able to shake off the months if not years of him being identified as a rapist out of their heads?  Likewise, if by some bizarre miracle this whole Jho Low and 1MDB thing turns out to be legit, or if it turns out to be true but the wrong people are named as being responsible, do you really honestly think that you will be able to get the judgements you've made after reading The Edge's article out of your heads when it's mentioned?  What I think The Edge should've done is hand over everything to the authorities first, and then publish the story later if it all gets ignored or something.  But that probably would've had less impact."

The Edge is licensed as a business/financial paper, which is why they got called up for doing reports on the 1MDB thing previously - their reports were seen as political news reporting, which is obviously against the terms of their license.    I wouldn't be surprised if they lost their license over this report, because this is really the exact same thing all over again.  This isn't a report on financial or business news - this is full-blown investigative reporting on an issue that goes beyond financial or business interest.

This is not necessarily always the rule, and there are lots of exceptions but this is how many of the non-malays who've been on the receiving end of this treatment one time or another feel and carry that fear with them.

malaysia,3dy7n5,MalaysianLiberalist,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"It depends.

Plus, 2GB of RAM is sufficient enough for everything, heck, my Redmi 1S with 1GB RAM works fine.., so the problem is the phone itself for being a POS and the customer for not doing enough research, no need to vent the anger on the shop employee, plus it shows how well Leagoo's advertising works lol.. It's just like my friend recently, who bought a freaking Intel M Core powered laptop for 1.4k, which cant even run PES2015 at the lowest settings and res, while my 1.2k laptop works well because I'd actually bothered to check and research the specs for laptops within my price range.  tl;dr Guy buys a POS phone, enticed presumably by the ads, regrets the decision and blames the shop employee.

Is the ability to run berserk with nary a rational thought a trait to be proud of, that it is brought up again when things get tough?   I remember reading about ""amok"" during primary school in B.Malaysia textbook. The way it was described matter-of-factly bewilders me.  And this part:   At the core of our problem is the failure to accept our differences, and not to just tolerate it. Instead of pressing for a colour-blind solution where we pretend that everybody is homogenous and race-less, we should instead celebrate a colourful point of view: that we are all of different ethnicities, there is no denying it, but we are all brothers and sisters nonetheless.   Nationalists who argued for elimination of vernacular schools always based their arguments on how elimination of differences will lead to elimination of racism. But the truth is, solution to racism comes from accepting differences, not just eliminating/tolerating differences."

In addition, with small efforts like these, it will create a ripple effect to those who care, with hopes that it will inspire them to do something of their own at their own volition, so that may do the same to inspire others as well, albeit with baby steps, but steps towards the right direction nonetheless.  It's not about whether if the difference is a big one, but whether if there is a difference at all, no matter how small it is.

I don't see anything wrong with this as long as these guys are contributing to the society.   Your opinion is correct logically. I can't help but feel weird that our capital city look this way. It should capture the very best of our country instead of foreign worker roaming around.   There is no doubt they are the one who are actually doing the heavy lifting in building our country. However opportunity gained by one is opportunity lost by another. While the foreign worker is doing their work, there might be another malaysian being unemployed.

People are already complaining RM2500/month is not enough (personally, it's good enough salary for a fresh grad, but that's a story for another day).

Companies can pay both locals and foreigners the same salary but there are more things to do when you hire a local.

malaysia,3dhcls,karlkry,4,Thu Jul 16 12:05:12 2015 UTC,"why is this word considered to be a slur?   It is considered to be a slur because it is used when you want to put an Indian person down, to demean, to denigrate, to degrade. The argument people have over the meaning and history of the word is irrelevant. If you wanted to talk normally, you might say ""India tak payah laa campur"", which although still would be terrible for a policemen to say , but at least hides the direct denigration.  Please watch this video to learn how the word carries weight. It is the experience many Indian people go through in government schools. This is why when the word is used, especially by a person in a position of authority like a policeman, it reminds Malaysian born and raised Indians of that feeling and the fears we continue to have to quietly endure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUsoPayw7w"

Instead, you may use ""Zhu ni hao yun"", meaning ""Wish you good luck"", or ""Zhu fu ni"", meaning ""Wish/Bless you (with)good fortune""  For Chinese first name, they are usually comprised of two individual characters that have separate meanings. Together, they are not a valid term, except when you use them as names. As such, ""go fook yewself"" wouldn't work because if you translate them, it would be ""go (name)-self"". Doesn't make sense now does it?   With that in mind, let's explore the pronunciation. Different tribes have their own dialects, and although the characters are the same, the pronunciations vary. In this case, the name is pronounced as ""Fu You"" in Mandarin. However, the name would be pronounced as ""Fook Yew"" in Cantonese, which was likely what they told the clerk when they registered him for the birth certificate."

They carry a lot of nice colorways and limited edition items. Though Adidas recently has specialty shops for their sportswear sneakers and attire. Some basketball focused nike shops like Hoops Station carry AJs and AF1s.  The top floor of Fahrenheit 88 have some local street wear brand too. Also, I think I saw a couple of local streetwear brands in Publika.  Pestle and mortar is a local brand located in Bangsar. Major Drop is by them and it carries international streetwear brands. Juice in Bangsar carries streetwear brands. Hype Clothing Co. in 1utama deserves a mention too.  Stussy Malaysia is located behind Times Square. Time Square used to have a few streetwear shops but they're either closed or having clearance sales (closing soon). Try to see if you can cop something there. I remember seeing some pretty cheap supra shoes but they're shop soiled.  Nike SB shops (I remember one in 1utama) carries Stussy and nice shoes, socks, and caps.  Tangs in 1utama carries Obey. I'm not sure whether isetan and Metrojaya carry streetwear brands or not. But isetan and Metrojaya are the next best things after Tangs if you're looking for special products that you usually don't find in other departmental stores like Aeon and Parkson.

H&M is cheaper but the quality is bad too. That or go to Asia Avenue in sunway pyramid or the many shops in Times Square for cheap knockoffs / clones.  For luxury streetwear just walk into CK, Givenchy, Alexander Wang, Alexander McQueen etc. They are at the Gardens / Pavilion / Starhill / 1utama.  Also I have to mention Uniqlo and Cotton On for the affordable basics and essentials.  (I spend way too much time shopping for a guy)"

malaysia,3dckqj,sikballa,0,Wed Jul 15 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"It's not the place of a restaurant to police morality, in my opinion.  There are plenty of reasons a Muslim might not be fasting. These can range from them being ill, travelling, pregnant or breastfeeding, menstruating, old and infirm, incredibly hungry, someone's threatening you, or some other excuse I might have missed.   You cannot conceivably tell just by looking if a Muslim is either one of five of those conditions just by looking, so the shopkeeper was in the wrong here.   Another further reason was that, according to the customer, the shop was mostly empty. A restaurateur shouldn't pre-emptively shoo  away a customer just because the customer might not order anything, only if they don't order anything. And the customer did order something, which gives the restaurant owner even less grounds. I can go to a Starbucks, order a coffee, and sit there for hours just because I've ordered something. I don't need to drink the coffee.  So I think the restaurant is in the wrong here."

If the issue is that the guy was arriving too early and would be taking uo space, the restaurant could've just compromised and did a reservation for him and his party: that would be a reason for him.to be there long before buka puasa anyway.

The highly biased opinion I can give is, Singapore iron fist ruling and good economy largely contribute to the unity ( this is in the early year of course ), the young generation mostly rely on education. Do not underestimate the power of repeating the sentence ""respect the other race"" do to a child for 10 years.   The same cannot be said to Malaysia. Our ruling is much more lax and arguably less wealthy than our neighbour. I understand the racism among the elder generation and changing their opinion is as hard as moving mountain. However, it is the younger generation racism that I can't fathom. Years of education should have smack any stereotype to minimum level, at least not causing riot.   I heard there is a time when Chinese Malay Indian coexisted peacefully, without intervention from government or any housing program. If this is true, then what happen to the unity that was once abundance and seems scarce today."

Saturday night, the thief came back with half a dozen friends and started smashing stuff in the Oppo store, apparently in revenge. This led to a minor scuffle between them and the sales assistants which was easily misconstrued as Malay vs Chinese because the gang were all Malay and the sales assistants were all Chinese. On Sunday night, a crowd of over 200 people gathered in front of Lowyat, apparently led by Pekida, protesting the biased investigations, referring to the unconfirmed rumor that the alleged thief was sold a fake handphone in the first place. Police closed off Lowyat to defuse the situation. Situation did not defuse. Without a target, violence spread around the area. Groups of men attacked patrons of a roadside restaurant. A Chinese man driving a car nearby was surrounded, dragged from his car and was beaten up. Even journalists who were covering the event were targeted. Someone let off firecrackers. Federal Reserve Unit was brought in when the police could not control the situation.   Here's a more complete summary of the event, with photos and videos."

Doesn't help that many of the people in those groups are sticking to that as the narrative as well so even though whoever it is that orchestrated this matter failed to goad the Chinese to retaliate, they've still managed to keep the melting pot boiling."

Cause I feel making generalisations, even self-deprecating generalisations, is usually an excellent way of alienating your target audience and pandering to their detractors.   Like that Hafiz Baharom fella, ""Lebih dari itu, ia telah menunjukkan bahawa hanya Melayu saja yang masih memikirkan keganasan sebagai penyelesaian masalah duniawi.""  Replace Hafiz Baharom with a Chinese guy, Melayu with Cina, and keganasan with duit, and I feel equally as uncomfortable with that kind of generalisation.  I like his usage of language, but he has some terribly inflammatory rhetoric."
malaysia,3d6nqi,throwaway12ki876,4,Mon Jul 13 23:31:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, I try to avoid generalizations, whenever possible. But it does seem like you could get away with criticizing the categories you are a part of, but not so much if you aren't. For an example, people couldn't care less if a black person uses the n-word, but if a white person uses it, it's generally considered rascism. Same goes to f-word for gays and d-word for lesbians. Likewise, I am okay with criticizing Malaysians' stereotypes with other Malaysians, but I would be offended if it was done by foreigners. I think the weird thought process is similar to how siblings are okay with bullying among themselves, but they will be up against others doing that to their siblings."
malaysia,3d6nqi,Thesket,3,Tue Jul 14 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"Generalisations can certainly be considered a type of criticism, but they straddle a very fine line.   I think the reason we are okay with in-group criticism is because we know they mean no harm / don't really mean it. But at the same time, when you level criticism to your group in the public sphere, you open up a venue for external criticism, which is less than fine.  Consider the example of saying Malaysians are bad drivers to your western friends in a joking way. You wouldn't expect them to join in the criticism too. Laugh yes, but not criticise. Or bullying your younger sibling in public. You don't expect your friends to start picking on your younger sibling too (If you do that means you're just a terrible sibling imo).  In any case, I expect non-satirical, public criticism to be more nuanced. Maybe say, ""I know not all Malays are so and so, but certainly a lot of them are"". Something like that."
malaysia,3d6nqi,cat_on_a_stick,4,Tue Jul 14 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think the immunity of in-group criticism makes it a powerful tool for self-reflection.

Especially Malays who have a long-held sense of insecurity and siege mentality (Disclaimer: ""I know not all Malays are so and so, but certainly a lot of them are""). In such a completely PC world where you can't even point out your own shortcomings as a society, how are you going to develop and better yourselves.  Also, addressing some of /u/throwaway12ki876 's points on the use of nigger and faggot and dyke, those are not really comparable with the Baharom situation as those are not ""stereotypes"" or even criticisms per se, they are just derogatory labels.   Baharom and other in-group critics get away with raising stereotypes because their objective is to motivate people to address and improve. Their incentive is so they don't get tarred with the same brush. Critics from outside the group don't have this incentive - they can be seen as threatening or demeaning, even if their intentions are good."

malaysia,3d6nqi,curiouscorncob,5,Mon Jul 13 23:43:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think Malays do it more often, and I'm not Malay either. I lump it as the general less educated / more brainwashed parts of our population that fall into acting out of violence and being simpleton enough to buy into the lies people who use them usually spew.   Side-story: I was walking back from the LRT once as a student and there were a number of Malay teens walking behind me. I hadn't taken particular notice of them, but suddenly something impacted my head from behind to the point I saw white. It didn't topple me and I stopped to turn to face the teens, of which one of them was walking ahead of me. So in a way, I was surrounded and the area was quiet save for a few cars passing by.  I just stopped and stared at the teens who then went to the opposite side of the road and kept my eyes on them as I continued walking, head still ringing.  A bike passed by and one of the teens mounted the bike which vexed me for a bit because I thought more backup was coming and for some reason it was really desolate that day.   I started to walk faster and realized the teens, 5 of them were trailing me from behind. The next stretch of road would be even more empty and I decided to cross the road as my chances of being seen by a passing car would be better. The teens thought I was fleeing decided to run towards me. One landed a kick right in my groin, another hit me on the head. I just fended their attacks off.  But I was starting to get angry now so I put my bag down and screamed asking why they were hitting me. They said I ""beat up Malay people"" so they were out to get back at me, which was pure bullshit. That got me even madder and I told them I'd never even seen their faces much less beat up a someone. They were indignant, and I was fucking pissed at that point. They backed off and crossed the street but this one punk; possibly no more than 12 years old started walking towards me with his chest out like some idiot muscle head; gotten so much as just a leg's distance away from me when a biker slowed down beside me and the little bitch ran away.  Biker dude was an old chinese uncle and asked me what was going on, while giving dirty looks to the teens who were walking away. I told him the story and he said they were probably trying to rob me, told me to be careful and asked if I needed help. I was in the clear by now since I was getting to the more populated area so I declined and just thanked him.  The point of this story is that it never occurred to me then that it was a Malay problem, but a problem with education and general brainwashing. I had Malay friends in school and none of them acted like the dumb shits we saw in the Lowyat video the other day. I know for certain they'd never go ""Melayu hidup barua mati"" and all that jack assery either.  It's not about the race in this matter; it's about how stupid or gullible these people are, to have mixed with the wrong crowd or to have just fallen into some other parties' agenda.  I find generalizations the worst. I've come across so many Malay cabbies who try to con me for a few dollars more and lazy ass Indians who take everything chill and Chinese drunkards who like nothing better than to just get wasted all their lives. No, it's never about the race, but I'll be damned if it's not some people trying to make it so. Playing the cards and pushing the buttons of the uneducated; the uninformed and getting them to dance to their racist tune.  The worst part of this is how people don't see that part of the picture. Don't be racist they're saying but that's not the problem. The real problem is how truths are being distorted everyday while the disparity and dissonance continues to grow and sadly there's nothing we can do to stop it in our position given how readily and easily people will believe what they want to believe.  That's all.   tldr: it's not the race, it's the damn tools."

Even if they did, like all other commenter  had said, we will be called pengkianat or followers of yahudi.

All these groups receive AA but have not progressed as fast as other ethnic groups.  The reason is simple. AA creates a sense of entitlement.

And also it's best to have very good proof at re-entry of your flight to leave Malaysia again, and probably good proof of where you will be staying in Malaysia.

I've accompanied them to Putrajaya to apply for this on several occasions, and it was always a 3-minute interview and then ""granted"".

Explain you're a tourist doing some training and want to take time to explore Malaysia and visit some of the surrounding countries. It's best to plan the next leg of your trip in advance so that you can show them a ticket for when you intend to leave Malaysia. Being vague might cause trouble. You are entitled to ask to stay for up to 90 days each time you arrive. Do not overstay. Enjoy! ;-)
malaysia,3d5f7f,crackanape,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:09:07 2015 UTC,"Do not get the extension. That results in a lot of unwanted questions. Do the visa run intead.  Don't do visa runs via land border if your can help it, instead fly. It doesn't really matter where you fly to.   Ideally don't wait 90 days each time, but instead take more frequent journeys. Consider it the Malaysian government encouraging you to go on holiday.   Will my 90 days reset every time I come back to Malaysia?   Yes.   Will it raise some with immigration if they see me flying in and out too often?   Doubtful. Maybe after a while, or if you are too conspicuous in other ways. Be quiet and demure and polite, don't try to create positive attention with funny jokes or anything. You want to be as invisible as possible.

Malaysian people as a whole are still by and far the nicest people I've met, and although things have taken a turn for the worse of late its still a largely safe and peaceful country. Yes there is corruption and scandal, but the fact people are talking about it and the media are now reporting it is a GOOD THING - as 10 years ago, it was very different. This guy has arrived late to the party tbh  Also he's been out of the UK for a while. It's a shithole over here, despite what people who don't live here think. If he came back here after his 10, 2o years away and had to live here again he'd understand. The world is fucked at the min, you'd be hard pressed to find a country where you can live quite freely and not come into contact with scandal, corruption and other such things.   If this guy is British, I can picture him already. Born into the middle class world of white privilege, following a life of order and rules...he moved to Malaysia and found it just too hard to snap out of his shitty fake bubble of perfection. Shame, because there are some valid points in the article, its just it feels like he's bitching about a country that he doesn't have to live in if he doesn't want to!  So from one brit to another, stop trolling yourself if you hate the chaos and return back to 'perfect' England. You can have my shitty overpriced room in London and I'll swap for your (probably) posh flat somewhere in the most soul less corner of KL because it's full of whingey expats.

If anything, it'll just be a temporary bandage on a greater ill that's afflicting our society. Racism is far too rampant and the government is practising selective persecution when charging fire starters with sedition. We've got ministers who make racist statements and in the next breath, tout the importance of 1Malaysia. There were no legal/official repercussions as a result of these statements. So naturally the Malay ultras are going to see this as a sign that their pro-Malay supremacist ideologies are shared by the government and that they would not suffer any sort of punishment by the government, should they start rampaging about and stirring shit.   I'm not disagreeing that social media has led to a rise in crackpot theories and rumours being spread like wildfire, but a blanket ban wouldn't amount to much."

The story further said the kid got arrested but released because he show the receipt (which was never even posted anywhere) and got released by the police.  Then the story said the kid then take some of his gang there and take revenge on the outlet but got bullied and kicked out of LYN by Chinese.  Those morons have been spreading this story over and over so many times all over the Facebook while branding the news report in newspaper as fake and accuse the police and reporters as taking bribe to cover this up.  It doesn't help when there are people that actually hail those thief and thugs as heroes without even a clue what actually happened.  http://imgur.com/BsYC3XG  Even worse when those ""pejuang"" flame and called everyone that posted the news report and facts to clear up the situation as insulting Malay and refuse to accept the report as real, that is still happening even right now ( http://imgur.com/htaPi6Y ).

I personally think Western values are really bad in a sense that they don't respect other people as much as they should do to their concept of freedom in almost everything. I actually quite dislike how they use the term freedom as an excuse for everything they do for example like the naked culture that is currently happening. Yes, it might be acceptable in their culture, but not in other people's country. I believe that freedom and respect have to coexist in order to properly work within a country. Freedom without respect for me is chaos.   This is where I am proud to be a Malaysian. Despite all the lack of freedom we have, we excel in respecting other people's culture. (I am specifically talking about the common people, not those politicians who live in the ivory tower with stick up their asses)  To be able to change I really believe we have to be able to open to constructive criticism no matter what we are talking about. The current trend that is happening in Malaysia is that some of the Muslim society classify people who doesn't fit their mind set as ""Yahudi"" (this word brings ALOT of emotion). Whereas for others, when given such criticism, they will think that they are being oppressed. We have all failed to acknowledge and further contemplate on the ideas that is contradictory to ours."

Siasatan Awal SB DW   Kedua-dua saspek tlh pergi ke Low Yat Plaza utk beli HP, SHAHRUL tlh melarikn HP namun orang awam tlh melakukn tangkapan & menyerahkn kedua-dua saspek kpd pengawal keselamatan. Anggota MPV tlh membuat tangkapan semula utk dibawa balik ke balai THSL. Walau bagaimanapun, KHAIRUL tlh dibebaskn. KHAIRUL tlh panggil geng2nya utk pergi ke kedai OPPO Plaza Low Yat utk balas dendam. Hasil siasatan & soal siasat SB DW adalah spt berikut:- i) SHAHRUL mengaku mencuri telefon bimbit namun tlh jatuh ketika melarikn diri. ii) CCTV tlh merakamkan perbuatan SHAHRUL melarikn telefon bimbit. iii) Mengaku mereka telah ambil dadah sebelum pergi ke Plaza Low Yat. iv) KHAIRUL telah mengaku panggil geng utk membalas dendam di Plaza Low Yat. Antara geng2 yg dikenalpasti adalah Ayie, Mat, Tiger (Anggota Polis KS Ampang Jaya), Wan, Ali & Baby.

Reaksi2 Blogger   Reaksi2 yg terdapat di laman blogger adalah seperti berikut:-   a) Reaksi blog Cina - Dunia dah berubah, tak sangka pencuri berani balas dendam. - pengawal keselamatan tidak berguna, hanya menyaksi sahaja. - mengkritik kaum melayu menberi alasan mereka terbeli hp klon, namun persoalannya ia adalah kedai oppo berlesen maka tak mungkin jual hp klon. - pengawal keselamatan semua warga asing, tidak profesional. - pengawal hanya buli orang awam sahaja. - melayu tak guna. - malaysia tak ada undang2.  b) reaksi blog Melayu - Jgn satu hari nanti Cina di Tanah Melayu ni jd mcm Cina di Indonesia. Baru makan xhabis. - penjual hp cina penipu, kaki kencing - Mana melayu2 kita ni tak duduk diam. Skrg cina sudah pijak atas kepala melayu.. takkan nak kasi muka lagi.. jangan sampai 13may berulang kembali.  Ulasan   Dilihat punca utama kekecohan ini adalah rasa tidak puas hati oleh sekumpulan remaja melayu ekoran seorang kawan mereka telah ditangkap dan dituduh mencuri telefon di salah sebuah kedai di Plaza Low Yat. Insiden ini menjadi viral ekoran orang ramai telah upload video2 & gambar2 kejadian ke dlm blogger & seterusnya mengeluarkn komen2 berunsur perkauman tanpa mengetahui keadaan sebenar insiden pergaduhan tersebut. SB DW tlh mencadangkn supaya tangkapan dibuat ke atas beberapa lelaki Cina yg terlibat dlm pergaduhan tersebut sebagai langkah neutralise isu sensitif perkauman. Selain itu, sidang media pihak polis perlu menerangkan fakta kes secara betul supaya perkara ini tidak berpanjangan. Anggota sektor SB juga tlh diarahkn utk menjumpai tokoh2 masyarakat supaya tidak mengambil tindakan sendiri & serah kpd pihak polis utk siasatan. Tq. [12/07 22:31] Sazali 150: Lk 300 orang.

KUALA LUMPUR: Police have solved a theft case at Low Yat Plaza in Bukit Bintang, here, which sparked a riot incident on Saturday. Police sources said the case was a clear-cut theft involving a 22-year-old suspect, who took away a cellular phone from a shop there without paying. ""Investigation revealed that the man had stolen a phone, which led to him being arrested by public members.   EDIT:    However, police quick action prevented any untoward incident.   ./facepalm"

malaysia,3d15bt,Darkpursuer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:53:00 2015 UTC,"Government policing religion is not a new concept. Its been around since the dawn of civilisation.  In every instance in history, governments that policed religion also used religion to control and persecute its people. From Eqypt all the way to China, there has been no exception.  The problem is that when religion becomes part of the government structure, it can no longer be challenged or debated. Questioning religion becomes a crime.  This gives government absolute discretion in all things religious.  In other words, governments get absolute power. And as they say ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"". Countries that police religion almost always corrupt  the very religion they hold n such high regard.  But human civilisation has evolved since then. Many great political thinkers of the last few centuries clearly saw the problems posed by state sanctioned religion. Communism, Liberalism, Anarchism are just some of the political ideologies that rose up to fight state control and religion.   In essence, this is what secularism is all about. Government should not have any role in religion. All religions should be able to prosper or fail by themselves.  Liberalism also offers a good solution... "" everyone is allowed to believe any thing they want as long as it does not harm others""."

An easy way to spot these unis with a lot of Malaysians is by looking at which unis JPA and MARA send their scholars to, since they send a lot of people and these people tend to go to the same unis.

So Guy swapped his non-original phone with another original phone and left the Shop. Shop reports to management, catches the Guy and report to Police, saying he stole the original Phone. Police apprehended the Guy on the charge of theft. Guy shows all the receipts that he received. Police, satisfied with what Guy shown and couldn't indict him with anything, released him. Guy tak puas hati with Shop, so he brought his friends and showdown with the Shop. Fight ensues.     This version makes more sense than some Guy caught stealing, brought to Police, but for some reason got released, then brought his friends for revenge. The ""released by Police"" part really didn't make sense to me if he really did steal.   And he did have receipts, so how could he received a receipt if he stole it in the first place?  But well, I believe later investigations will be able to make it clear though."
malaysia,3cyaee,zul200289,18,Sun Jul 12 05:14:02 2015 UTC,"That's what I read too. But this version is mainly circulating among the Malay communities, especially among the pro-Malay Facebook groups. While for the Chinese media and online community, the other version is more popular. So to be honest, they are both biased and we can't really make a conclusion without further proof.   There're several loop holes in your version though. The shop that was being trashed is the official shop for the OPPO brand, so why would an official shop sell non-original phones? That's like walking into an Apple Store that sells knock-offs. Not impossible, but highly unlikely.  Secondly, the buyer should have checked the phone before he closed the deal. Now that he has brought phone home, who knows if he switched the phone and later claimed that he was scammed? Besides, if you have bought any handphones before, you would have known that there's no actual phone on display. The phones on display are dummy phones that have no actual functionality. The actual phones are often stored away from plain sight (in a cupboard, or in the storage behind the shop). So to think that he can just ""swapped his non-original phone with another original phone and left"" is quite unbelievable. Lastly, where are the receipts? Every phone has a unique product ID or IMEI, and they should be visible on the receipt. If the phone he took has the same identification number with the one on the receipt, then he's in the right. Otherwise, he is wrong. Likewise, if you bought a book from Popular bookstore and realized that one of the pages is missing, would you just walk in the store and replace the book yourself, without permission from the store owner?   Either way, if there's a dispute, he should file a report, not trashing the store."
malaysia,3cyaee,throwaway12ki876,3,Sun Jul 12 05:45:59 2015 UTC,Not condoning the thuggish acts.   But there are cases where it is the workers that swap out the original goods for fake so they can sell the original on the black market and pocket the difference. Happens at various high end leather goods shops too.

malaysia,3cyaee,throwaway12ki876,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:22:26 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about this particular shop. Just saying that things like this have happened before.
malaysia,3cyaee,Shitmusiclistener,4,Sun Jul 12 09:30:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's not much things to go through since we don't have access to evidence.  I'm not sure about that Oppo shop, but plenty of shops I went to, they put their real phones in the glass display. I've bought like 3 phones at once and they simply took it from the glass display (2 of them in a box, 1 outside a box but they give me a box for that too) and gave it to me. It's not much of a stretch to think that they guy simply barged in, grab one from the display and sods off.  I wrote another comment, which would be good if you could look at it. If we were to believe both sides are good, then it's probably a simple breakdown of communication.    Guy doesn't understand Ori vs Non-Ori,  Shop thought he wants non-Ori and gave it to him Shop doesn't explain Ori vs non-Ori Guy showed to friends and found out it's non-Ori Guy felt cheated and went back to Shop Shop refuse to refund / exchange Guy swaps phone and leave   Yeah, I'm not defending the Guy's action, but I kinda see his point of view.  If this is truly what had happened, the shop could have avoided all of this shitstorm if they simply refunded the Guy in the first place.   Not going to comment about the speculation where Shop gave Original to Guy, Guy goes back, swaps with Non-Ori and claims that Shop gave non-Ori, because there's not much evidence to go through, though personally I think that's very unlikely what had happened."
malaysia,3cyaee,zul200289,3,Sun Jul 12 06:07:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess we would have to wait for the actual evidence, especially the receipt.    If this is truly what had happened, the shop could have avoided all of this shitstorm if they simply refunded the Guy in the first place.   Hindsight is 20/20 (American Horror Stories reference). Although, there are many factors to consider in ""refund"", especially in retail business, most will opt for ""replace"" instead. I mean, what if the phone has scratches? Or the box was already damaged? Hence, there are many reasons as to why his refund was refused, and we don't know enough to pinpoint who's at fault. But yeah, I pity whoever that has to cover the cost of these unnecessary damages."

malaysia,3cyaee,throwaway12ki876,0,Sun Jul 12 05:58:58 2015 UTC,"If you want to think positively of both sides, this could have been what happened:  1. Guy *wants to buy* original phone from Shop.     1b. Guy doesn't understand difference between Ori and non-Ori     1c. Guy asks for cheap priced phone.     1d. Shop thought he wants non-Ori  2. Shop gives a non-original phone to Guy.     2a. Shop fails to explain difference between Ori and non-Ori to Guy     2b. Guy was happy and didn't think anything of it  3. Guy goes back, shows to friend and found out it's not original.     3a. Guy thought he was being cheated  4. Guy goes to shop again, talk with Shop. 5. Shop refuse to change the phone. So Guy swapped his non-original phone with another original phone and left the Shop. 6. Shop reports to management, catches the Guy and report to Police, saying he stole the original Phone. 7.

Guy tak puas hati with Shop, so he brought his friends and showdown with the Shop. 10. Fight ensues.     To prove this line, we will need to see the Receipt value and compare the amount Guy paid to Shop with price of Phone. If amount on receipt is same as non-Ori price, then this is probably what had happened.  And without any access to evidence, we can speculate all day. Haha."

For more touristy stuff unfortunately JB isn't as well documented (e.g. on Wikitravel and blogs) as our capital Kuala Lumpur or our sister country across the straits, Singapore - but US apps like Foursquare might still come in useful for food recommendation. (although a lot of it is imo hyped up by Singaporeans) If you've never tried our cuisine hawker centres where plenty of food stalls selling different foods are gathered in one place are great for sampling different dishes.

GMOs are well-known to be safe:   There is a widespread perception that eating food from genetically modified crops is more risky than eating food from conventionally farmed crops. However, there is broad scientific consensus that food on the market derived from such crops poses no greater risk than conventional food.[1][2][3][4][83][84][74][85] No reports of ill effects have been documented in the human population from genetically modified food.[4][5][6] In 2012, the American Association for the Advancement of Science stated ""Foods containing ingredients from genetically modified (GM) crops pose no greater risk than the same foods made from crops modified by conventional plant breeding techniques.""[1] The American Medical Association, the National Academies of Sciences and the Royal Society of Medicine have stated that no adverse health effects on the human population related to genetically modified food have been reported and/or substantiated in peer-reviewed literature to date.[4][5][6] A 2004 report by Working Group 1 of the ENTRANSFOOD project, a group of scientists funded by the European Commission to identify prerequisites for introducing agricultural biotechnology products in a way that is largely acceptable to European society,[86] concluded that ""the combination of existing test methods provides a sound test-regime to assess the safety of GM crops.""[87] In 2010, the European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation reported that ""The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.""[2]:16   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies#Health  Many independent studies have proven GMOs to be safe (PDF)."
malaysia,3cqotc,peminatmasat,5,Fri Jul 10 00:25:11 2015 UTC,"Massive props to her for writing what needs to be said. Though ironically, and this is quite jarring to me, there were actually quite a few grammatical (comma-related) errors in her article, but that's neither here nor there.   That being said, I think Malays need to be weaned off the Bumi economic privileges. It was never intended to be a permanent measure, and it shouldn't continue to be. In fact, I would be all for universal welfare. Heavily means-tested, of course, but universal all the same. At the same time though, I wonder about whether or not we could actually support a welfare state."
malaysia,3cqotc,Thesket,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:39:00 2015 UTC,Would you mind to give some examples on the grammatical error she made? My English is terrible and I would like to learn from her mistake. :-)
malaysia,3cqotc,throwaway12ki876,2,Fri Jul 10 04:54:09 2015 UTC,"It's basically a lot of this:   These numbers are jarring to me, because I have seen first-hand how young Malays...   That comma shouldn't be there because ""because"" is a subordinating conjunction which sets of an essential relative clause. That is to say, the words after ""because"" are essential to the meaning of the sentence.  And some of this:   Most of them were smart, but rendered “dumb” by an education system    Here the comma precedes a coordinating conjunction (For And Nor But Or Yet So (FANBOYS)) which sets of a subordinate clause. That is to say, everything after ""but"" has an ""object"", ""verb"", but no ""subject"" which means that it doesn't give you all the information it should. To use it properly, it would be either:   Most of them were smart, but they were rendered “dumb” by an education system...   Adding a subject.  or    Most of them were smart but rendered “dumb” by an education system    Removing the comma.  And here I hope I'm not being too annoying, but, since you said you wanted to learn, I'll just point out examples in your comment, if you don't mind that is.   Would you mind to givegiving me some examples onof the grammatical errors she has made?   Usually after ""would you mind"", you should use the gerund ""giving""+me to indicate what you want who to do and when you want them to do it.   ""On"" is used to indicate that something acts as a surface of something else, among other things. On the page, on the table, etc. You should use ""of"" instead to indicate that in ""[a] of [b]"" [a] belongs to a set [b].   And finally, in the present tense you need the auxilliary verb (helper verb) ""has"" to indicate that it's in the present tense.   And also, in your second sentence there should be a comma before ""and"" since your next clause is an independent clause, that is it contains subject [I], a verb [would like/want], and an object [to learn]. Also don't be fooled, ""to learn"" is, as the infinitive form of the verb which means that it's not a verb, so in this case it acts as an object. It's not a mistake you made, but it is very well done that you recognised it.  Anyway, English is hard as shit. I recommend reading books. Reading books and watching TV are probably more useful than learning all the rules. Because there are so, so many complicated rules. :/  Hell, most people don't even know these rules. Usually people know it's wrong because it sounds wrong. They won't be able to say why it's wrong usually."
malaysia,3cqotc,Thesket,5,Fri Jul 10 09:54:00 2015 UTC,Would one not use the comma to show a natural pause? I would have written those sentences the same way just because I would have paused when I say them.
malaysia,3cqotc,IbbleBibble,3,Fri Jul 10 11:55:32 2015 UTC,"Natural pauses usually coincide with proper placement of commas and not vice versa. So just because you might pause when saying them, it doesn't mean that others will. In formal writing, it is not usual to impose diction upon the reader because there are established language conventions which deal with that.  If you must indicate a pause, like in creative writing or similar, then usually an em-dash ( — ) or ellipsis ( ... ) is used."

I get to do anything I want because I can easily get anywhere I want to to do it (its an island after all) Conventions, meet ups, shopping? Easy peasy. That said my Singaporean friends normally complain they don't have anything to do which is weird because I see a lot of things to do (hell they even have a few skate parks and dance classes) They even have good public libraries! Those I will really miss.  Speaking of shopping, yeah shopping. I get to find a lot of cool stuff whenever I am in Singapore (I visit back every few months) and compared to the same stores I visit in KL I like the ones in Singapore better. I think the competition there makes the services better.  That said the things I didn't like...  Food. Food there is bad. It has no taste. It was torture for me especially when they can mess up with something as basic as fried rice (it tasted like cardboard) and I really hated I had to rely on fast food more because of it.

You can buy dry/canned goods and and stuff like washing powder from places like 99 Speedmart, but I wouldn't recommend for short-term perishables. For cheap furnishings you can go for standard department stores like AEON Big, Tesco, Giant or Mydin depending on which is closest to you. We're a pretty obese nation as well, we love food after all. So long as you're not over 200kg I think you'll be fine. Highly recommend you download an app called MyTeksi. The cabs are metered and the prices are stated on the app. Do NOT use touts or roadside taxis if you can help it, especially if you're not obviously Malaysian. Android iPhone Define low-key."

Go dancing, Vee Ai Pi is a good place which is next to the Bombing Memorial, and down the street are reggae bars and other outlets that may or may not appeal to all.  Wear shorts and singlets and slippers if you want to or if you feel like it. Who cares? Forget a bag, just extra baggage.  Only use a taxi when you are leaving or going to the airport. Have extra money (about RM50/person) for the additional airport tax. This is not usually mentioned, but make sure you have this prior to leaving.  Budget daily RM250 for accomodation, tranport, food, you will be fine. Prepare additional $ only if you want to go surfing, hiking, diving, etc..."
malaysia,3cqayc,CorollaSE,3,Fri Jul 10 03:01:42 2015 UTC,"Went there last year for a week and I stayed in both Ubud in Kuta. Ubud is better IMO. I can't remember everything so I'll just give you my overall experience in both places.  Ubud is located in the mainland and it's not as crowded as tourist hotspots like Kuta. The paddy fields there are spectacular but it gets boring after a while. For accommodation I stayed in Cocoa villa. They are a family business and they'll treat you like a family, they even have free transport to anywhere in Ubud. There are a lot of temples to visit there, just pick a few to visit they all look almost the same. Don't miss out rafting in Ubud, you won't regret it. Oh and also don't forget babi guling if you don't mind.  Kuta is closer to the airport and it's fucking crowded. It's best known for it's nightlife, lots of pubs and clubs there. Random people at the streets will offer ""mushrooms"" and ""sexy girls"", just politely decline and walk away. I went to a complex which has several clubs inside, one of the best clubbing experiences ever. You just have to pay for entrance and you get a free drink. I can't remember the price though but it's cheap. If possible, don't go to Jimbaran for the seafood, it is expensive as fuck and IMO we have better seafood than them. If you want romantic with your girlfriend in the sunset at the beach then no choice lah, get ready to burn a hole in your pocket.  General tips in Bali:    The food there was hit or miss, just try every random food stall. Never get on a taxi who refuses to use a meter. IIRC there's only one legit taxi company and it's called Blue Bird. However, there are a lot of fake Blue Birds which looks identical to the legit one. Give this a good read. Haggling is like a culture in Bali. It's like people expect you to do it. So get ready to level up your haggling skills. Haggling +1. If you need to exchange currencies, remember to visit a money changer with a licence. I'm not familiar with money changing but if it's too good to be true it's fake.  Remember you have to pay Rp. 200k departure tax before leaving the country. Balinese girls are pretty as fuck. Smile with them to get a smile back, 10/10 would do it again. As always, safety is always the priority when travelling, please avoid doing something foolish that would put yourself in danger. Enjoy your holiday and respect the locals.   TL;DR - UBUD = KAMPUNG, KUTA = SEX & DRUGS, I LIKE KAMPUNG MORE."
malaysia,3cqayc,jay_sheng,2,Fri Jul 10 03:58:48 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good guide: http://whatevertherewas.com/one-week-bali-journey-budget-overview/  If this your first time in Bali, definitely cannot miss the Kecak dance which cost around RM20-RM50.  Explore the rest of bali too, not just Kuta.   If you're particular about halal food, be aware that they are mostly hindu and love their babi guling. If you see the word soto/sate, you need to ask if it's ayam, babi or sapi(meat). One thing that you must eat in Bali is duck(bebek). Sayur urab just means ulam. Whatever food served with their special Bumbu bali is delicioussss.   Be sure to bring some charcoal pills in case of mencret(what Indonesians call dhiarrea). Pharmacy is called ""apotik"" if you ever need one.   Balinese are very religious. Be respectful when in the temple. They usually will have some prayer things in front of every shop, don't step on it.   If you ever need to rent transportation:   Car - Mobil  Motorcyle - Sepeda motor  Bike - Sepeda  Taxi - Taksi  Trishaw - Becak  Train - Kereta (so, be careful about this one!)  Stay away from drugs. It's not worth itlah."

Sanur is much more peaceful imo. The first time I visited Bali two years ago, I stayed at Ubud. Ubud is great for cultural experience but when I recently visited Ubud, the place was much busier than usual (beware of traffic jams!).

malaysia,3cmmnt,BuddhaFacepalmed,5,Thu Jul 9 04:01:31 2015 UTC,Local foods galore. Very busy and very awesome.
malaysia,3cmmnt,vinnch,2,Thu Jul 9 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the extremely late reply. Was busy for the whole day. It's basically like a food fest but specifically for the Malays who fast during the month of Ramadhan, so it will only last until the end of Ramadhan, which is in a week. Although i'm Chinese but I frequent the bazaar too, and I can guarantee you'll love it."

Aquaria at KLCC is a pretty decent aquarium too.  As for transportation, try to use the train (LRT/Monorial) as much as you can, they are pretty cheap. For cabs, download the ""Myteksi"" application on android or iOS to book your taxi as to avoid being cheated by unscrupulous drivers."
