spaceengineers,3e2rdc,LaboratoryOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:17 2015 UTC,Haven't used 1x1 wheels lately - are you able to use them without having issues involving them bottoming out?
spaceengineers,3e2rdc,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"What do you mean with that? I havent had much issues with the 1x1 suspension wheels.    There is just one issue with wheels where when the steering is too strong, they seem to be stuck in place and almost clip weirdly. To solve that i reduce the steering angle."
spaceengineers,3e2rdc,Raeffi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:04 2015 UTC,I honestly wasn't aware that 1x1 wheels even touched the ground.
spaceengineers,3e2rdc,Raeffi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:54 2015 UTC,They only do when you lower the height offset Digi added a few weeks ago to the source code. Before the 1x1 wheels were rather useless for cars as the wheels didnt touch the ground but since then you can up the base by lowering the wheels and thus have a bit of ground clearance.

spaceengineers,3e3yb8,kenmaclean,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"The thing is weight wise it makes much more sense to be able to use gyro power in all directions - the others are just dead weight when not in use. I know in current sats they use one axis wheels like you describe but that's probably because sats don't need to spin around and dogfight.  I suggest an addition to the vanilla game instead. A power slider like the current one but separate for each axis. This would make IRL sense, be easier to code in and give players more design choice with only ""optional"" complexity."
spaceengineers,3e3yb8,Noobymcnoobcake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:02 2015 UTC,"You could put four gyroscopes, all overriden to the directions you want, then use G-menu hotkeys to control the ship, although I agree that a more intuitive method could be added."

spaceengineers,3e3ece,maxdemone,3,Tue Jul 21 17:28:59 2015 UTC,It could use more styling and sleeker curves but you'll be glad to know it's far better than my first designs.  Consider adding greebles to the outside. Flat plates of armour doesn't seem to look as interesting. A lot of players use ridges running along the vessel's length to make it look more interesting.
spaceengineers,3e3ece,Caridor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:38 2015 UTC,"My first impression is that it looks more like a heavy fighter or bomber, rather than a drop ship. When I think of drop ships, I think of the Pelican or LAAT style. Fat in the middle, turrets on the underside/under the wings to sweep as it comes in, landing struts to cushion your drop, and finally a big armored door to keep troubles from being shot up before they can get out.   That said, it is still really nicely done for a first small ship. I prefer building small ships myself, but I haven't been able to get up the creativity to do a ""gone wild"" small ship design. I think with a little help from the Roundists, adding some curves to your drop ship, you'll have a pretty sweet bird."
spaceengineers,3e3ece,Jezerey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:52 2015 UTC,Its rather blocky but you have a nice base design. I think a bit of polishing would go a long way for you. I also suggest putting the conveyor tubes for the guns internally. I would love to see this if it gets cleaned up a bit. +1
spaceengineers,3e38qj,CurtissTH,5,Tue Jul 21 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"I always build one reactor with its port facing out, and conveyer up the others. This allows me to jump start the system and becomes a welcome 3rd or 5th reactor on my small ships. Also helps to put a battery somewhere in your design, so it will charge when connected via a connector and give you a little extra power if your reactors burn out and you need to limp home."
spaceengineers,3e38qj,Jezerey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Another option is to build off an existing grid, and set up merge blocks. Then when your done and have fuel in the reactor, you can grind the merge block and be gone, or keep it and just disconnect it."
spaceengineers,3e38qj,JamesTalon,3,Wed Jul 22 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"Power is transmitted via any connected block, only items and oxygen need converyors to be transported"
spaceengineers,3e38qj,-Apfelkuchen-,3,Tue Jul 21 16:55:31 2015 UTC,If you have multiple small reactors piped up to a conveyor system but can not move uranium into them try access a reactor manually and putting some fuel in it. it will jumpstart the conveyor system and let you fuel the rest of the reactors.

spaceengineers,3e34qf,mr-octo_squid,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:15 2015 UTC,What I'd suggest doing is creating a peaceful factions server to begin with and accumulate a fair number of resources. Then implement this rare resource/mining station idea as now all your factions have some capital and it's not going to piss them off too much. There is a trading calculator knocking about somewhere that you can use.
spaceengineers,3e34qf,mr-octo_squid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"My idea was to start of with some prebuild admin owned stations and some starting ""goodies"" for each faction. But having people farm in the beginnig would be also good but may discourage players who want to join later.  Also THANK YOU!! I already feared I'd have to make a list on my own^"
spaceengineers,3e34qf,mr-octo_squid,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:22 2015 UTC,Could be an interesting concept. it would obviously take a whitelisted server. Use a few established factions run by administrators.  Could restrict attacking the factions main bases except for scripted server wide events. Small ships and medium sized ships have open PVP outside of a set distance from base.  Resources can be restricted by using a set map size and selectively adding asteroids with specific resources. Maybe set a day once a month that resources get refreshed and asteroids changed.  It keeps the resources finite and the game field always changing.
spaceengineers,3e34qf,mr-octo_squid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"I think resources should not be limited but harder to obtain in masses. Whitelist was planned since there will always be some trolls. Restricting PvP to specific areas or banning it from them is a great idea, I think I'll add this to the to-do list"
spaceengineers,3e34qf,mr-octo_squid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:43 2015 UTC,So smaller ore deposits and less of them?
spaceengineers,3e34qf,Jimmacle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure about that yet bur propably a bit of both. Also I'd like to limit it to one or max 2 ores per Asteroid, since I'll most likely make the mining stations yield the ores they are on.  So there should be a little challange in finding your desired ore and also one in getting the resource, since at the moment you can power a lot of stuff for a long time from one vein of uranium."
spaceengineers,3e34qf,AG4W,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:08 2015 UTC,How do you plan on having the mining stations work?
spaceengineers,3e34qf,IVIauser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:30 2015 UTC,Most likely having them registered manually to a list by an admin or mod and then a block that simply spawns ore over time which can be collected then.  But this is a point where I'm looking for a different solution.
spaceengineers,3e34qf,TheNotSoWanted,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:06 2015 UTC,I don't think spawning would be a good idea. Maybe having prebuild abandoned mining rigs sitting over large deposits which would need to be cleared and reactivated. similar to like a loot dungeon.

spaceengineers,3e0ggz,Ukatox,3,Tue Jul 21 08:12:10 2015 UTC,"I love to cram as much as I can into a given space - some build large... I build small.  Here's another large ship I put together - for grinding down captured drifters. You could easily replace the grinders with drills or welders, as required - though I'm not sure where you'd put an ore detector.  Yes, I have mods. I have 81 mods installed! Of particular note is MMaster's LCD script. In the Cinderblock, you can freelook straight up from the flight seats to look at them. The grinder, unfortunately, you have to get out and fly back to see. I've not got a cut-away for the grinder, as there's nothing hidden... except that the gyro is behind the LCD screen. You'll note both ships have oxygen support, though the grinder doesn't have a generator and needs to be filled externally (via connector).  Another feature you'll notice are the red/green button panels. I use these to manage oxygen - green pressurizes, red depressurizes. Finally, the beacon hanging off the top of the Cinderblock is actually a RADAR - super useful for finding stuff that doesn't have a beacon or antenna.  Final note: this was all done organically in survival mode - the only exception being that the Cinderblock was overhauled from my stock respawnable version which ends behind the refinery - no additional storage, only the one reactor, no jump drive, no antenna, no cannon, no radar, no cryo... etc. There's a full listing on the workshop page.  Note: the LCDs show ridiculous cargo capacities on these because I had copied and converted the save to creative to take the screenshots. I play with 3x inventory, for context.  BONUS - Here's an album with some other stuff from the same game. The first bunch of screenshots show my friend's ""Exploration Cube"" - a mobile base. There's a refinery, a pair of assemblers, and so on under the docking bay catwalk floor plating. Downstairs, well - there's almost 20 small cargo containers down there, 4x small reactors from here, and one fuel cell from the same mod. You can catch a glance at a small grinding ship docked within. The last four images show a small station we built to support working on these ships and a mining ship I built. The station doesn't do much - mostly charges your suit, supplies oxygen, gives you a place to log off, and provides a respawn point. The miner is pretty obvious, though you'll note I have a miniaturized jump drive on it from here - it's quite balanced in that it takes a bunch of energy, they mass a lot, and only go 50km."

The planet had a lot of flat features but there were some ridges and such, obviously Keen are gonna implement the features of the worlds, it's nice however just to have a planet/world to live on.

There is definitely one to synchronize several rotors to aim at the same angle.    The issue with what oyu might want however is that you wouldnt need just the angles but also the distance to your target or better a point in space because otherwise the other weapons wouldnt know where to focus at.    This image should quickly demonstrate the issue in 2D Ideally you want this http://i.imgur.com/mowgGq6.png The problem though, if you sample the angle of just one weapons alignment without knowing position of the target or distance to the target you will get this http://i.imgur.com/zFzzlyX.png    So you need two things. 1. A script that aligns a weapon toward a point in space. 2. A method to determine your targets point in space.    I hope that helps you looking for a solution."
spaceengineers,3e1tam,plaYer2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:05 2015 UTC,Can non-rotor based turrets even be controlled by the programming block?

spaceengineers,3e3k7i,mr-octo_squid,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Talk about getting jumped.    So I could potentially build a ring of turrets, fly off in my ship that is nothing but a jump drive, armour and landing gears, hook a ship and jump them to the center of the ring.   I wonder if that will get changed. Seems a little op."
spaceengineers,3e3k7i,bigrigross,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:24 2015 UTC,"I dont think it should be changed, but I do think there should be countermeasures added.  Not going to lie, I would love to attach to a large capital ship, jump into the atmosphere of a planet and watch it fall to its death......  /wakes up.  What I think they should do is change the charging mechanic to mass based.  More mass equals more charge so that it will take longer for your FTL to charge if the mass increases.  You attach to a capital ship, it should have to charge longer."
spaceengineers,3e3k7i,mr-octo_squid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:19 2015 UTC,"I like that suggestion. It just requires the game to be able to calculate the mass of combined ships.   I can't imagine having one of my capital ships dropped onto a planet, and never getting it air born again."
spaceengineers,3e3k7i,Extramrdo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:36 2015 UTC,Couldn't you just warp it off world? even if your thrusters couldn't move you. you could still move the seat and blind jump upwards.

spaceengineers,3e3k7i,slaya33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:02 2015 UTC,I have actually been considering working on a countermeasure mod.  If anyone is a star wars fan I was considering making gravity well generators. They keep ships from warping in or out.
spaceengineers,3e3k7i,mr-octo_squid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:19 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it won't let you jump within 2km of any objects.
spaceengineers,3e3k7i,slaya33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:42 2015 UTC,If you are connected by landing gear it will let you. Doesnt matter which ship has the connector or the drive. It will jump.
spaceengineers,3e3k7i,slaya33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:01 2015 UTC,I mean that he won't be able to jump the ship directly into his ring of turrets. Unless landing gear allows you to overcome that limitation and I'm wrong.

spaceengineers,3e175o,Synthtwo,2,Tue Jul 21 04:12:03 2015 UTC,I don't think that's possible (yet). When looking at the remote controls actions it looks like you can only control ships and start/stop autopilot with programmable block (and from buttons and flight seats etc).
spaceengineers,3e175o,misterZalli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:50:12 2015 UTC,"Some of these features are not accessible, like setting coordinates for the remote block. Afaik it has to do with restricting these automations to a direct user input and not let a programmable block with full closed loop controls have access to them aswell to ""give more weight to user"".    I am not a fan of that decision either and i hope that some git pull requests come through to fix that."

spaceengineers,3dz1je,mattstorm360,4,Mon Jul 20 19:25:51 2015 UTC,But what purpose would a lengthy respawn time have in single player?
spaceengineers,3dz1je,Caridor,4,Mon Jul 20 22:20:52 2015 UTC,"The same purpose it does in MP - cause the player to attempt to be more careful. Not as bad as limited lives, but with the game in the state it's in limiting lives isn't the best idea (because stupid shit like putting your helmet on while oriented flat near the floor/ceiling can kill you)"
spaceengineers,3dz1je,draeath,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"But the end result is the same, you just end up wasting the player's free time.   Let's be honest, when does someone die in single player? When they make a mistake in base or when attempting to take a ship, in which case, they probably lost their fighter.   It seems to be adding a punishment for making mistakes like turning off your inertial dampeners and hitting a wall or something like that, rather than anything with actual gameplay consequence, since they'll just reclaim their resources from their corpse.   It's annoying and pointless and only succeeds in wasting people's valuable free time."
spaceengineers,3dz1je,Caridor,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:51 2015 UTC,"The same could be said about any other single player game where you can die or fail.  If there's no consequences for failures, success is less meaningful."
spaceengineers,3dz1je,draeath,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:03:51 2015 UTC,"But even with your suggestion, there still isn't a gameplay consequence for failure."
spaceengineers,3dz1je,Caridor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:53 2015 UTC,"No more than any other game, as I said. If you die, you reload your last save - the only consequence being lost time."
spaceengineers,3dz1je,draeath,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:53 2015 UTC,That's called save scumming.  What we need is some cost to the player in in-game materials.
spaceengineers,3dz1je,Caridor,2,Mon Jul 20 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"No. Save scumming is abandoning a game to reload, to retry (perhaps a different PRNG result changes something, perhaps you just know what's ahead) or subverting mechanisms that delete your save on failure.  I don't disagree with you that some material (or energy) cost in-game wouldn't hurt, but what happens if the player cannot satisfy it? We're back to the same situation."
spaceengineers,3dz1je,draeath,3,Mon Jul 20 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"Well, other games, such as Terraria or Minecraft have you lose things that are on your person, such as items or money.  In this game, I think we should just leave as is. You simply can't hold anything really valuable on your person and if you die while piloting a ship, then you've probably lost your ship, which is a pretty big consequence."
spaceengineers,3dz1je,Caridor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:50:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is why I amped up welder and grinder speed. I had assemblers and refineries amped until I realized they changed the cost of things."

spaceengineers,3dz8k7,chrisbe2e9,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:56 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good plan. You could also work on equipping them with drills, since you may find the enemy buried under a couple of hundred meters of rock."

spaceengineers,3dz8k7,draeath,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"You'd have to neutralise the planet's gravity inside the barrel. Without that, your ore ball is simply going to tear through your barrel at high speed as it travels along and down.  How does this kind of design work against asteroids? Since bases may well be under a hundred meters of rock."
spaceengineers,3dz8k7,Caridor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"Mmm, true - but then, there are other ways to go as well. Something along these lines, but I think far fewer gravity generators will be required.  As you say though, if it's behind rock this won't do anything... but that doesn't mean it's not useful in general.  Explanation: 5 spherical gravity generators laid out like a die but with the center generator offset in depth will cause the ore to gather in a large clump. You then disable the spherical generator and, optionally in the case of planets, turn on a few directional generators to shove the mass away. This has the advantage of being mechanically simple - no moving parts. It also looks really damn awesome as it ""charges."" I also would expect you could drop one of the perimeter spherical generators to form a trefoil field (so 4, instead of 5) - should would work just as well."
spaceengineers,3dz8k7,draeath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:55 2015 UTC,"True, having a rock land on an enemy above ground base would be devastating.   I think this kind of design would be far more effective if it scatters in a planetary environment. This isn't a design for use against underground bunkers (which most bases will probably be) but against ground vehicles and when dealing with a small ship, one of those rocks is going to do serious damage. Launch them high into the sky and let gravity give them the velocity they need to deal damage over a wide area."
spaceengineers,3dz8k7,Caridor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"I think you'll be surprised at the variety - while building underground is really the defensible way to go, people tend to like being able to see their creations - that said, I know a few people who will be digging holes :P  Still. It can have use - taking out solar farms at the very least."
spaceengineers,3dz8k7,draeath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:59 2015 UTC,True. I guess it would be effective against some players.
spaceengineers,3dz8k7,Caridor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"I suspect that engagements with player made weaponry within a gravity field would be much slower than in a zero g environment as both sides would probably require time to set up.   What I expect to see is a aiming computer and some sort of rangefinding, if the game itself won't provide it probably using the law of cosinus. Probably in a mixture with guided projectiles using what has already been realised with drones."

Having engagements be broken up by terrain could make things interesting.  One thing I notice a lot of is people seem to expect planets to be fairly ""flat"" (in the round sense).  However, I expect the possibility of fantastically unfamiliar landscapes, the kind that are only possible in the absence of high gravity or erosive forces.  Landing areas are cool, but having space ports built into the geometry of inverted mountain ranges sounds like a reason to upgrade my GPU.  I'd be happy to have the asteroids we currently have now, only much bigger and with gravity functioning as a strong force.  If that just means bigger voxels, then that's quite acceptable.

I mean you are right that at the moment survival is a slow version of creative mode, but I think that it's very much possible to make survival mode playable. In my opinion, survival in this game is far from finished but I wouldn't loose hope."
spaceengineers,3e328a,lithiun,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"I mean you are right that at the moment survival is a slow version of creative mode,   There's no sign of this changing. I'm pretty sure KEEN is betting on mods to created interesting scenerios, but the focus is absolutely on construction.   Have a review of their ""About""   http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/about.html  There's no mention of making survival mode more than a slow creative mode."

Or friendly and neutral AI that you can trade with or join with. Possibly a system in place with random AI NPCs that you can gain reputation with. All in singleplayer. I want to see a multiplayer overhaul to where it doesn't take ma half an hour to join a server and then kicked because it took me so long. I want this game.

Or friendly and neutral AI that you can trade with or join with.   Trade, why? For what? Ore that incredibly abundant?  That sounds like an interesting scenario, but also very contrived. Like it's more of a drill, a military exercise, than a game. And that's kind of what I'm getting at. You can make up scenerios like that, but it will never really make a game. It's like those adventure maps for Minecraft. They're just a prototype for a game you might actually want to play.    Possibly a system in place with random AI NPCs that you can gain reputation with.   For what purpose though? These sound like useful mechanics by themselves, but I can't see how they fit into Space Engineers.   That's the problem. A collection of game features does not a game make.    I want to be able to build huge structures and not destroy my laptop in the process.   I doubt this is going to happen without sacrificing physics simulation. You could probably get it to work in creative mode with lots of physics dumbed down, but bringing into a real game woudl probably not work. And this is where KEEN has to make hard choices. Do you give creative types a better build environment? Or do you make multiplayer and survival more realistic and stable?"
spaceengineers,3e328a,bigrigross,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:43 2015 UTC,Trade because it could me an incredible mechanic in the game. I know it's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be. But we have all these components that make up larger blocks why not implement a currency and trade system where you can mine ore and manufacture components and sell them or the ore. Or vice versa buy ore or components! To build blocks and ships. That would be the coolest thing ever.   Reputation would fit with that. You can have bad reputation with a different faction and you shoot them they shoot you. Or neutral or good reputation to where you can dock with them and trade with them. Like neutral standing with a random station faction that when you sell them things or defend them you gain reputation and get better prices or be able to buy ships or whatever. It would be an interesting mechanic.   Why should we sacrifice being able to do more for a better multiplayer? Granted my laptop is no top tier machine but it should be able to handle the game just fine. The game shouldn't crash when a structure gets larger. To a point. I'm not talking about a planet size structure. I'm talking about having a large ship from the workshop and be able to play it at more than 10fps. I'm not harking on them. The game is beautiful and i understand it's in alpha and i wouldn't have the issues so much with a more powerful pc. But it does need to be better.

KEEN has made production of components a simple matter of building assemblers, , clicking ""build this,"" and walking away. If you have the ore, there's literally no reason to trade it for components,   Look at a game like EVE Online for comparison. You have to specialize in mining, trade, or construction (among other things). You can't do it all effectively yourself. See they create a NEED to trade and work with other people. But in SE you can do it all with minimal investment in infrastructure.  Do you see the difference?   Why should we sacrifice being able to do more for a better multiplayer? Granted my laptop is no top tier machine but it should be able to handle the game just fine. The game shouldn't crash when a structure gets larger.    Yes, it should.

Do you see how having the mechanic available is different than actually having a need to use the mechanic?  You can make up the need. You can vow not to use assemblers and only trade for components. But then you're just  adding more hoops to jump through to do what the game is ultimately made for: Creative."
spaceengineers,3e328a,bigrigross,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:16 2015 UTC,I've played eve online for 3 years. I know the difference. It would still be cool to have a currency and trading system in place even in multiplayer. Damn.
spaceengineers,3e328a,bigrigross,0,Tue Jul 21 19:20:59 2015 UTC,"Would it? I don't know why. I guess I'm just more concerned with the sum of the parts than having cool features that have no useful in-game function. A good game design should let necessity (in the game universe) drive the features and avoid implementing a laundry list of things that sound cool. For example, first a reason to trade then a trading system and currency.  If you do it that way, you  may even get mod community to do the work for you. Different trading systems would grow organically and you can pick the best one. Or just see what people like. But since nobody has any reason to trade in the game, you probably will never see a system for trading.   Let's say you have a tech/skill tree  and specialization has a real advantage. Well, that drives multiplayer interaction. It drives a real reason to form a faction and do all the other cool things you talked about. But since any player can basically do everything equally well as the next, you're OK going solo and factions remain the very loose groups you find on typical multi-player servers.   And similar situation with combat. With nothing really fight for, you never really develop combat mechanics.So someone claims a group of asteroids. Big deal? The server is infinite and you really only need a handful anyway to get all the resources you need. And that need to claim territory would drive a proper map system so you could see who has what.   You want these features, right? I'm just telling you what it takes to get them. And Space Engineers does not have what it takes. They're off doing things like planets, which promise to be little more than big asteroids with natural gravity. And with current ship mechanics, they're trivial to visit. Planets COULD drive new features, but they won't.  They'll be trivial to visit with the same ships you use to flying around in space.  Is it more clear where I'm coming from now?"
spaceengineers,3e328a,LaboratoryOne,3,Tue Jul 21 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, I personally really enjoy survival. The need to find resources and survive makes the game interesting. Now, I also play Rust for fun so maybe I'm not the best gauge for that, but I'm not sure where you're coming from. Most of what you said doesn't really support your opinion, as far as I can tell.  Of course, I would also like to point out that if you don't like survival then don't play it. Maybe its not to where you want it to be right now, but I think you're underestimating the room for improvement on survival.  TL;DR Don't throw in the towel yet, be patient grasshopper"

spaceengineers,3dx0ow,1986buickGN,9,Mon Jul 20 06:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see cross-grid message passing implemented for programmable blocks, which would be the obvious first step towards something like this.  The API would basically consist of two methods:  void Send(string message, string targetGridName, string targetBlockName = null); bool TryReceive(out string message, string sourceGridName = null, string sourceBlockName = null);   Fairly self-explanatory, although I haven't started implementing it yet so not sure how hard it'd be... plus there's the usual questions around transactional dequeuing and other things which afflict service buses."
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,descenterace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:02:18 2015 UTC,There actually is an exploit which already allows for cross grid messaging. The basic idea is to save a reference to some LCD/Text panels for shared memory as a global variable while the grids are connected. This allows for continued access even after seperating the grids.  Obviously it would be much preferable to have something more like UDP where the system conveniently queues up received messages for future consumption.
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,Nyld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:37:30 2015 UTC,"There'd need to be a limit on queue length, I think. Also the queue design would have to be carefully thought out to avoid triggering lots of gen2 collections.  Currently I'm leaning towards a message time-to-live of 1 minute, with messages reaching their target grid in the update following the send (so passing messages back and forth in a single game update isn't possible). The receiving grid/block would do the buffering, so if the receiver's not reachable when the message is sent it will be discarded. Send(...) might actually return a boolean to indicate if it was deliverable or not, but real service buses tend not to give any indication so this might just be overcomplication. Also need to think about how sending to faction or enemy blocks might work...  It's a bit annoying that strings are reference types in .NET. Makes it really hard to do slab allocation of storage space on the LOH, although I think that can be circumvented with streams."
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,descenterace,2,Tue Jul 21 06:33:55 2015 UTC,Well what I want planets to be is you could go to a planet and once you are there you can't really get off it again.. Because it should be hard to launch from them.
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,fanzypantz,3,Mon Jul 20 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"Normally thrust isn't the limiting factor, it's fuel (and the thrust needed to move all that fuel plus ship). But in SE we have nuclear reactors and can easily burn for DAYS without using it up. So I don't see this ever really being a major issue or much trouble in terms of engineering.   But yeah, if you do take a ship that can't generate 1+ g of thrust to a planet, you should just crash. What happens currently?"
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,WoodToTheMetal,3,Mon Jul 20 14:54:54 2015 UTC,"there is 0.5g on the planets. the yellow submarine can't get up from it, but you can fly in your space suit or a tiny ship."
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,fanzypantz,3,Mon Jul 20 15:08:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, so that's good. But how did you land it in the first place? You'd have to have thrust pretty well balanced to not generate significant velocity between entering sphere of influence and hitting ground.    Are they going to turn off jet packs on the surface or in atmosphere?  Speaking of atmosphere, parachutes should come with planets. So you can drop supplies in ships that consist of cargo container, power supply, and antenna.  Though a drop container block with these features would be nice."
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,WoodToTheMetal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"I just landed it on its butt, with 2m/s to go.. I mean one or two thruster more and I could probably lift off again.   I am not sure if they will turn of jet packs, I hope so."
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,fanzypantz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:03:01 2015 UTC,I don't get it. Is the natural gravity not correctly implemented then? Because it seems very unlikely that you would only have 2 m/s when you touched ground. What's the planet gravity radius.. 5km? 10km? That's a lot of time to develop significant deltaV.   Or is it the gravity effect from surface really small like 500m?
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,WoodToTheMetal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"its fairly high, but yeah its not impressive. like I had the inertial dampeners on and it just stopped going down after I hit 2m/s.   As in I was constantly burning. I just floated slowly towards the ground, no big acceleration, it felt like I was on a tiny moon in KSP.. Which in reality they where."
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,fanzypantz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:35 2015 UTC,"inertial dampeners   Ooh! Ok, that explains it. You got enough force from the dampener override but couldn't use that same extra thrust to take off.   Sounds like they implemented a special dampener ""feature"" to not completely stop you if in natural gravity. So large ships could float down like that. Did you test with a large ship that was WAY off in thust capability? Like so far away from being able to take off that even inertial dampeners couldnt' slow it down?  I'm guessing that no matter what you do, a ship will never crash into a planet as long as dampeners are on. Probably to protect players, but at further expense to realism and removing a lot of need for engineering."
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,WoodToTheMetal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"Oh I meant that the inertial dampeners could not completely negate it, so I was still going 2m/s when I landed. So I am definitely sure you need more thrusters on larger ships, but not actually many."
spaceengineers,3dx0ow,fanzypantz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"2 m/s is suspicious. It's too small to be the product of insufficient dampener thrust alone. IF the thrusters were not powerful enough, you would have accelerated well past 2 m/s. It really sounds like there's some kind of safety that makes inertial dampeners infinitely powerful so you can never fall faster than 2 m/s and crash a ship.  EDIT: I mean you COULD crash the ship if you turned dampeners off or explicitly accelerated towards the surface. I just mean the dampeners will always limit your free fall to 2 m/s. Just a theory though based on what you described. Kinda wish SE wouldn't do things like that. Like how ships are not affected by artifical gravity. The PARTS are affected by artificial gravity, but not the ships. It's weird."

Have some rudimentary aerodynamics (at least enough to allow for parachutes, for example).   I do think at some point we will need more advanced trajectory planning tools. From the videos I've seen, establishing stable orbit in SE natural gravity is a PITA.   I don't see how you can have planets and NOT borrow from KSP.  It's better than the alternative: making SE like Minecraft and having almost no natural physics at all. There's no engineering to be done then."

Drones are getting better so I guess we'll eventually do a projector system which projects the station on itself and lets drones fill in holes and repair stuff.  Maybe we'll get flak turrets which fire an exploding round that has a better chance of striking meteors.  Hell maybe we'll make tiny drones that fly towards the meteors and shoot them and/or sacrifice themselves on them, with other drones bringing in the wreckages and repairing survivors.

You don't have orientation in game. But you can access absolute coordinates of specific blocks.   is it possible to give Rotors and Gyros a set angle or vector to point at?   Don't do much with rotors, but I believe the interface is there to do exactly that.  Rotors suffer from what I call a time step bug. On single player they are okayish, sometimes they will explode for no apparent reason. Don't use them on multiplayer unless you're intentionally building a bomb. Landing gear have the same issue.  Gyro's on the other hand are a bit tricky. It's more of a spin-this-way-with-this-amount-of-arbitrary-unit type of deal, then double checking to see if you're pointed the right direction.

spaceengineers,3dw3tv,Ishakaru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:18:32 2015 UTC,"'Sense position, update acceleration appropriately' is pretty much how mechanical control systems work in reality though. The trick is damping; as the rotor/piston/gyro nears its goal, velocity needs to reduce so it's close to zero when it hits the stop. I have an experimental script somewhere which does this with pistons to minimise the 'shock' on the attached grids...  Timer 'trigger now' loops are a pretty good way of getting precise timing for gyro control. They don't need to result in the entire script logic running every update. Maintain a counter incremented every tick and quickly bail out if(counter % x != 0) where x might be 20 or 30 for smooth control."
spaceengineers,3dw3tv,descenterace,2,Mon Jul 20 06:54:28 2015 UTC,"Scripting isn't as full-featured as I'd like it to be.  tl;dr: There doesn't seem to be any way to directly set most values in a block's terminal settings (although you can read them) - you have to use Increase/Decrease toolbar actions to change the value, and you can't control the step size.  (by the way, if someone would like to prove me wrong and show a way to directly set those values, I will love you forever.)  Edit: Yep, turns out there's a really easy way to set those values, I just didn't know about it. The documentation linked to by the in-game Help button is basic at best.    A couple of days ago I wrote an ingame script (my first Space Engineers script, though certainly not my first time writing code in C#) that would move a piston to a specific distance, in order to build a lift/elevator that could stop at floors. My initial approach was fairly intuitive: The script would check the current position of the piston, work out whether it needed to extend or retract, set the appropriate piston limit value to the desired height, then activate the piston, reversing if necessary.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that there's no way couldn't find an obvious way to directly change the limits or the piston velocity! The closest that my script could do is activate the ""Increase/Decrease"" toolbar options for the piston, which change the value by a preset step value that I cannot modify.  The step value for piston limits turns out to be 1/20th of the piston's extension length, which for a vanilla piston (with a 10m extent) is 0.5m. This means I can increment it five times to change it by the length of 1 large ship block (2.5m to a side).  Unfortunately I'm not using a vanilla piston for my lift - I'm using a mod piston with an extension length of 35m. This changes the step size to 1.75m, which is an utterly useless value because it doesn't factor into 2.5 cleanly.  I ended up creating a ghetto solution involving a timer block which constantly triggers itself and the script while the piston is moving, allowing the script to constantly check the piston's position until it's in the right location, then it turns off the piston and timer."

It would take an infinitely cleverer soul than me to figure out how to create a map that figures out how to present itself with only inputs from the beacon, and not updated by hand.

spaceengineers,3dwvhk,aaronfranke,5,Mon Jul 20 06:42:21 2015 UTC,17 km/s relative to the sun.   Yeah ok so I was close

spaceengineers,3dwvhk,MonsterBlash,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:19:49 2015 UTC,I like this. Suggest it on keen forums
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,Hunter62610,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:07:27 2015 UTC,the reason is obviously because it reduces the maximum time/amount of G-forces that can be acting on you at any given time to prevent blackouts/death.
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,LoneGhostOne,7,Mon Jul 20 07:46:09 2015 UTC,"G-Forces come into play when you accelerate, not at constant speed.    You could be speeding up at 1g for a year, and even if you'd be going at crazy speeds (like close to c by then, you'd still only feel 1g of acceleration. (Ok, this, of course, is staying within the framework of classical mechanics and discounting anything which start happening at relativistic speeds.)    At best, the most logical explanation is the ""the faster you go, the more energy it takes to sustain the same acceleration because of the virtual mass"", but that happens at kinda higher speed than 300km/h XD"
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,MonsterBlash,-2,Mon Jul 20 13:04:10 2015 UTC,"No, the idea is that at 100m/s its hard to have any acceleration over any time that would be deadly."
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,LoneGhostOne,3,Mon Jul 20 15:12:23 2015 UTC,What?
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,MonsterBlash,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:32:52 2015 UTC,so if you want to accelerate to 100m/s you can either do it in one second at around 90m/s2 which is roughly 9 Gs or you could do it in just about anything less than 9 Gs. The point is that 9Gs for 1 second isnt going to put you at much risk since you're only accelerating for one second.   A human can survive up to like 30-40ish Gs if it's not sustained for more than a few MS. the 100m/s speed limit prevents you from accelerating too much for too long.
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,LoneGhostOne,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:05 2015 UTC,"If you accelerate at 2m/s2 (.2G), for 4 hours (4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds), you'll be going at 2m/s2 * 14400 = 28800m/s (1728000km/h). And you will barely have felt it.    For comparison, the Aston Martin DBS 2008 goes 0-100km/h in 4.3 seconds, so it has an acceleration of 6.5 m/s2    There are no downsides to capping acceleration directly, ""in the on-board computer"" if you want to prevent problem like these. There's a world of downsides to capping the speed to lower than one of a jet fighter.    It just doesn't make any logical sense, even with contrived logic. That's about on par as OP saying ""it's the galactic council's law"".    Just outright say ""we don't want to do more than 100m/s"" than try to come up with convoluted arguments which don't make sense. XD    (You can also accelerate at near infinite acceleration, for near zero time, to reach 100m/s, and you'll still be dead anyways, so the speed limit to prevent dying from sudden acceleration doesn't hold anyways.)"
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,MonsterBlash,0,Mon Jul 20 21:03:45 2015 UTC,"i'm saying that's why it's galactic law! but anyways it's probably an engine limitation at some speed so they thought ""hey, 100m/s is a nice round number"""
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,LoneGhostOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:53 2015 UTC,well there are other ways of doing that then. Like limiting the power of thrusters. And few ships but broken grav drives accelerate at more than 9g.
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,Noobymcnoobcake,2,Mon Jul 20 21:26:04 2015 UTC,You are traveling much faster than 100m/s right now. The ammount of g force you feel is completley independent of your velocity. Accleration produces g force.
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,Garyroachfreeman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"yes, but it wont let you change your velocity more than 200m/s and if you were to plot a graph of the time vs the accelerations you could take to change your velocity by 200m/s it would reduce the area that would be lethal on the high and the low end."
spaceengineers,3dwvhk,LoneGhostOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"That limit doesn't have anything to do with g forces though. Acceleration in game is not constant. Sure 30Gs would kill you over an hour, but thats why no one accelerates that hard that long. If the acceleration was an issue, there would be an acceleration cap."

I mean first of all the game is going to be very ambitious which means it will be very heavy on any systems no matter what. They can't scale physics like you can scale graphics, its the physics that is hard on the game. They can scale the graphics quite well however.

spaceengineers,3driyn,fanzypantz,12,Sat Jul 18 19:33:36 2015 UTC,"So I wanted to make a video demonstrating how far they have come on Planets in a simple way.  As you can see I spawned on a moon or something and instantly died, the map is probably set up for creative testing, but nevertheless I got to spawn in a realistc matter right afterwards. I flew in and noticed that I could easily fly around in my ship around the planet because it was only 0.5g there, I could also easily fly around in my suit(I've seen people being scared of difficulty building things. But you can also see when I come in my framerate starts to tank, and I got a pretty beefy computer(GPU is a tiny bit outdated, but still rather good)  There are no ores to be found either, I made a giant tunnel to see what kind of layers there where on the planets, and when using my tunneler I had many cool ideas on how I could make a tunneler work under gravity so I can tunnel around to mine ore on the planets.   I want to say that there is literally nothing to do on planets other than build bases and such, and I imagine they need to do more LOD's and cut up the planets in chunks so you can only load so so much of it at one point. I mean while at ground you don't need to load the other side of the planet...  Other issues I saw was tearing of the planet, textures being all jumpy and weird. No foliage, and nothing special to look at, no real landscape features and mountains since everything was very flat.   I want to say that they have come very far, but there are obviusly a lot more to do, though this might also be a little bit outdated because I downloaded it from github today and they might not have updated it in a while(never checked) I would say let them at it for half a month or a month before getting anxious, they aren't magicians."
spaceengineers,3driyn,Angryfa,6,Sat Jul 18 19:33:43 2015 UTC,Thank you for showing this :)  I'm afraid that expectations for the planets might be a bit too high for a lot of people. The way planets are now is pretty much how they will be (aside from some fixes). I wouldn't count there being any landscape features that stand out very much.
spaceengineers,3driyn,Angryfa,9,Sat Jul 18 20:44:24 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be all that hard to add deeper valleys and erosion, they already have a tiny bit of it.   I can see them doing quite a lot of fixes, like how the atmosphere look like from far away, adding ores to the planets, and actually making it have foliage with a better looking landscape as in Medieval Engineers(maybe not to that extreme, but if they can do it in ME why not SE, but obviously they need to do it in another way.)   I don't think they just want to make them look strange and dull. But ofc all that will take quite a lot of time."
spaceengineers,3driyn,draeath,6,Sat Jul 18 21:07:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, but it could have something to do about how such things would look like from afar. Steep mountain 1 km above the surface on a 30-50 km planet would stick out and look quite funny. Deep canyons could probably work better and personally I would really love to see impact craters. Complex landscape features also grow the surface area quite a lot compared to more ""mild"" features, and that could cause some performance issues.  Also I'm not 100% sure, but I thought there would be pockets of ore already. Compared to asteroids they just will be much more apart and hard to find. Have you tried to use large ore detector to see if there's any?  I don't personally find the current planets (from different videos and pics I have seen) to be that dull, but I just love barren inhospitable wastelands anyway :P"
spaceengineers,3driyn,thetaprime,5,Sat Jul 18 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"I never actually tried a large one. But yeah I can't say for sure if there is ore or not.  Yeah what I meant was that you create valleys, which in turn makes the existing tops look larger. As in you carve out valleys like an iceberg to get something like Norway's fjords(totally not from Norway)  But these valleys can easily just be flat on a lower LOD of the planet when  you are far away. Maybe look darker on texture or something."
spaceengineers,3driyn,WoodToTheMetal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:53:32 2015 UTC,"making it have foliage with a better looking landscape as in Medieval Engineers   I seem to recall reading on Marek's blog somewhere that the plan was to use ME's vegetation (at least at first). I've also seen others mentioning that the planet code tries to load assets that don't exist in SE, but do in ME - leaving me to believe that this is actually the case."
spaceengineers,3driyn,WoodToTheMetal,3,Sun Jul 19 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think planets should be the point of this game, but rather an important feature. I would say something like O2 harvesting and botanical samples to produce O2, water and of course, metals would be neat resources to grab there.  You could make pretty cool starports on/around them but they should simply be territories."
spaceengineers,3driyn,thetaprime,4,Sat Jul 18 23:41:24 2015 UTC,"There really are no antagonists in the game, mainly because you can eliminate meeting players by just jumping extremely god damn far. It's not easy to find people further out because the search area is a sphere of around the spawn and it only gets exponentially bigger the further out you go. We aren't bound by X and Z directions.   Having just a few planets at certain locations and make only planets or moons have a type of ore that you can only find there, it would mean you had to fight to get it if there already where people there.   That is one of the ways you could make players stay in an area. Another one is that you can hold a section of space, and to hold it you actually need to announce that to everyone like on a map. Maps of a 3D grid in both XYZ has been made before, and could probably be done in the game. That is my second idea of how you could make PVP more prominent and not just when you go look for trouble.   Both of these options make it harder for you to simply fly insanely far away and be a recluse, but they also have their con's. Like you might push certain people away from the game like those who want to build mostly. But then again you could simply just make it a PVE mode where you can't destroy anything.   Another option is NCP's like pirates or some other faction. Enemy patrols, mainly small scouts randomly come and looks around where players have been. Larger enemies with more powerful ships, generally wont get near you without being provoked. Enemy fleet or stations."
spaceengineers,3driyn,WoodToTheMetal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:27:34 2015 UTC,"Planets don't really fit, if you ask me.  The setting is very specifically in an asteroid belt. It makes no sense for one or more planets to just randomly show up amongst the asteroids. And itreally highlight how limited the engine is in terms of actually simulating space and physics.  A planet shouldn't be something you just casually land on and have a walk around.    KEEN needs to focus much harder on the core of the game and get all that fleshed out and fixed. Planets are the wrong direction.   I see this game failing in teh long run due to lack of coherent vision for what SE actually is."
spaceengineers,3driyn,Angryfa,4,Sun Jul 19 09:20:18 2015 UTC,"well if you want realism, then Space Engineers is the last place to look.. Asteroids so close you can see them from another asteroid.   In real life if you started burning straight at the asteroid out there in the distance, you would actually miss and actually not get to it at all because that is literally not how orbital mechanics work. You need to burn relative to its position.. Basically if you want this game to be realistic planets and everything in the game needs KSP physics. But its not that kind of game.   This game is pretty much about the engineering part, adding planets gives you another thing you can use for engineering.   And lastly.... Space doughnuts?? Hollow asteroids??"
spaceengineers,3driyn,WoodToTheMetal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:41:58 2015 UTC,"Asteroids so close you can see them from another asteroid.    That's a minor quibble, IMO.   In real life if you started burning straight at the asteroid out there in the distance, you would actually miss and actually not get to it at all because that is literally not how orbital mechanics work.   Between two objects in roughly the same orbit around the sun, only 10's of km's apart? Yes, you absolutely could just point directly at it and burn. It's not orbital mechanics at that point. You do it all the time in KSP when intercepting a station in orbit. Once you do the orbital mechanics to get within a few kms, you just point to your destination and burn. Well, after you kill your relative velocity, of course. But that's basically where you are at in SE. You've entered the asteroid belt and have effectively killed your relative velocity. It would take months to see significant change is position.   But KSP physics would be awesome. I get the impression the limited physics in SE are more the result of engine limitations than some conscious choice by developers. For example, they need certain things to be absolutely static.    adding planets gives you another thing you can use for engineering.    Basically just natural gravity. But since SE isn't KSP, you won't really get into good engineering challenges. It'll be the same kind of fake challenge that mining asteroid is in that any old ship COULD do it just fine.    Would love to have real challenges as seen in KSP like ""OOops, you didn't bring enough fuel, so you're stranded."" ""But I couldn't bring more fuel because it would have made me too heavy..."" But in SE, you spend a few hours mining Uranium and you never have to think about fuel again... and it hardly weighs anything."
spaceengineers,3driyn,draeath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"No I definitely feel ya. Early game is hard because it takes time..   That is all.  I wish you would get stuck on the planet if you just went to it. Right now you can fly out with your jetpack or any ship with decent trust.. I want the gravity to be so heavy that you need to build some monster to lift your monster ship to the ground. Or force you to build a space elevator.   Or say have the option to spawn on the planet, hunt for resources, build yourself up and finally build a big enough ship to launch you off.. The 0.4 g seems to be nothing for large ships.. I could land a yellow submarine on its butt with 2m/s to go but couldn't lift off again. I can't imagine I would need more than one or two thrusters more to get it off."

It's not like Kerbal Space Program where you have to plan entry and carefully land and all that. It's just a big asteroid with atmosphere.
spaceengineers,3driyn,Angryfa,3,Sun Jul 19 09:13:50 2015 UTC,"Well there you said it: ""big asteroid with atmosphere"".  It adds so much more depth to the game and actual engineering challenges with natural gravity.  In what other game can I build a big ship to transport cargo, rovers and shuttles between planets. Use the shuttle to transport the cargo and rover to the the planet surface. Look for good ore deposits with the rover and build a mining outpost on the planet and use the shuttle to transport stuff between your big ship and mining outpost.   If that doesn't sound exciting then I would really like to know what you find exciting about SE?"
spaceengineers,3driyn,Callous1970,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:18:11 2015 UTC,"It adds so much more depth to the game    Potentially. Right now it's pretty shallow. I won't be excited until you can build a proper colony on the surface. And would like to see some real challenge in getting to and from the planet surface ala KSP. I expect SE will dumb that down a lot, especially since we effectively have unlimited fuel and it doesn't weigh much. So the engineering ""challenge"" will just be ""How many engines and reactors can I cram into this boat?"" That's it. Just more engines and reactors.    If that doesn't sound exciting then I would really like to know what you find exciting about SE?   I ask myself that every time I start it up. To me it's just a big lego box w/ moving/motorized parts. I know the Minecraft comparison is kind of worn out by now, but that's the best I can think of... it's like Minecraft where the things you make actually do something. A ship in SE actually moves. It's not just a statue of a ship like in MC.   I originally was excited but MC too but lost interest over time as I realized how shallow its mechanics are and how weak the gameplay elements are. And all mods do is add yet more weak elements.   It felt like they just threw together a bunch of misc. things to do that never added up to much. Even the core of it, mining, is super weak. It's just this time wasting obstacle to building things. And the mobs just annoyances.   I worry that SE is going that way too. I don't really know what I expect of a sandbox though. I just don't think anyone has really hit that right balance of preset activities, realistic (or at least deep) mechanics, and imagination.  EDIT: I take that back, Dwarf Fortress proved to require imagination and have depth of mechanics. Too bad the interface sucks and there's not a lot of challenge unless you specifically making things hard for yourself.   But MC is hugely popular and SE has sold millions of copies already, so clearly my opinion isn't terribly popular. So ignore me."

I was also really excited about minecraft for some time but got bored by it really fast after I begun to experiment with red stone mechanics and saw how needlessly complicated that was. The one thing that blew my mind about space engineers was how easy it was to make ""complex"" stuff, comapred to minecraft.  Another thing that I really like about SE survival mode is how different it is compared to pretty much every other generic survival games following the minecraft ""progression"" formula (punch wood to get wood to build wood stuff to get better stuff to get better stuff to get better stuff etc.)."

How does a laser mine a material? By cutting chunks of rock out? How do you collect the ore? The energy use would be HUGE for a laser to cut rock.    However there are practical applications for lasers in mining  So maybe you could use lasers as    Rangefinders Long range Ore identification devices   I could dig either of those. But even thought we have warp drives I don't think that means that we're throwing out all realism. I could be wrong though."
spaceengineers,3dtfgw,sumguy720,6,Sun Jul 19 15:54:11 2015 UTC,The only reason we got jump drives is to help work around the speed cap (which is there for physics calculation purposes) and traveling large distances.  Personally I say no to mining lasers.

As for my opinion. First of all we don't have warp drives, we have jump drives, jump drives jump, warp drive speed up. ;)  Secondly I doubt we need faster drills, but it can be an alternative so you can mine further away, which really is no benefit if you just make tunnelers.   If I could have the power to decide and it would come into the game I would either ask for:   merging of drills that are next to eachother to minimize performance impact enormously. The drills we have are tiny, and you need a large amount to actually make tunnelers that work, especially for large ship..  Or I would simply ask for a giant drill. Again only for performance boost."
spaceengineers,3dtfgw,fanzypantz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:17:18 2015 UTC,I think there's already a mod for it. I've had it installed but haven't tried it yet. Not sure if it sucks up ore or if it just breaks it where you need to channel it into a collector with grav fields.
spaceengineers,3dtfgw,SneakyTouchy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:27:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so....?  Think the core physics around this are a little too scifi (more fi than sci)  The core functionality of drills is to separate chunks from whatever to be collected. Granted the collection process is done in a magical manner...  The core functionality of lasers is to shine light really hard at something. Usually with the intent to heat it up (explosions that result are from the item having explosive tendencies via expansion of something).  So looking at the physics, you would need to assume that A: everything you mine is composed at least partly of ice (ice shrinks in to water, then rapidly expands into steam) or that hitting stone will expand the metal close to it enough to break chunks away B: you don't hit too much metal at any given point in time. You lose heat transfer as the best case, hit your self as the worst case. The tractor beam part is kind like the grave generators already so.../shrug  I feel that it's too magical over all. But then again, we have grav gens: modification of the higs field only messes with mass(weight within a gravity field).  Jump drives are founded in reality at least.(theoretical physics anyway.)"
spaceengineers,3dtfgw,Ishakaru,3,Sun Jul 19 14:05:32 2015 UTC,"It's less magical and more ""probably not the best use of lasers.""  Check out laser ablation. You can use lasers to drill through things, but lasers are too precise. You'd have to cut out a chunk of rock as if you were carving a turkey. Drills can simply be rammed into an asteroid without caring about angles or much of anything."
spaceengineers,3dtfgw,Cirevam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:34:27 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected. The magical part is already in the game for the most part (gravity gens). The only real world issue I would see is reflective surfaces, but that could be glossed over for the sake of a game.   Would add a little progression to the game. High amounts of energy would be required.  Using laser antennas as a bench mark, this would bankrupt a newer player in terms of uranium.

spaceengineers,3dq7t6,IamKroopz,5,Sat Jul 18 11:25:37 2015 UTC,"I'm working around most of this with a combination of namespaces and the search box: Relevant blocks are hierarchically named like in namespaces you might know from programming languages, or similar to (reverse) internet domain names. You'd have, e.g.,    st.ass.1 st.ass.2 st.ref.1 rs.thr.1   for Station Assembler 1 and 2, Station Refinery 1, and Red Ship Thruster 1.  The actual naming can be molded to your requirements. And the search box dynamically gives you groups of your assemblers, your refineries, or only your refineries in a particular station, and many more possible subgroups.  It's worthwhile to remember here that the search box does an AND-search with multiple words entered into it, so you could narrow any search this way, both in control panel and inventory.   Works for me. :) Now, if only the cursor would automatically jump into the search box when you open these screens... Generally keyboard tends to be quicker than mouse."
spaceengineers,3dq7t6,sepen_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"The main reason I came up with the idea is the infinitely-long inventory, and naming. It becomes extremely difficult to remember all the names of all the things you've built on all the grids, especially when in multiplayer, and you've got a meter-long list of mods running.  I know for a fact, I'm not the only, nor the first one to suggest this kind of thing, and for a good reason.  In the inventory, if I want to grab a specific type of component from a number of specific containers on an even moderately large grid, and transfer them all into an empty container, I'll have to first find one such component, empty the search box, find that component again, by scrolling, and put it into the empty container, once again, by scrolling, and all that just to be able to search for the component later, and have a slightly narrowed-down list, which still won't guarantee I won't accidentally take a component from the wrong place.  So yes, you're right - mouse is slower than keyboard, and you currently have to do a lot of mouse work just to be able to get what you want. Sections would, above all, make the control panel much neater, and hopefully make searches much easier, as (granted the feature works the way I imagine,) you'd be able to group some containers/assemblers/etc., then either show only them in, or exclude them from the inventory, thus making your life much easier. Heck, I bet scripting would become much easier also - it'll be able to manipulate whatever objects are part of a specific group, eliminating the need to manually name specific items."
spaceengineers,3dq7t6,sepen_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:10:33 2015 UTC,"Having a lot of inventories will always drive up the complexity of a once simple operation, but yeah, there's definitely room to improve on existing UI, no doubt.   Searching for component names, not only block names, is powerful for what it is. And you can structure custom names carefully, or design storage and filters with certain processes in mind... But at some point, you will have to bring out the big guns, write a script, and beat the problem into submission. :)"

spaceengineers,3donl3,Seamus_Donohue,4,Sat Jul 18 12:45:56 2015 UTC,"While this is an excellent writeup, overall, I want to challenge this bit:   ...it is always more effective to use more mass blocks and only a single gravity generator.   I'm going to interpret this as ""Given a certain ship configuration, a greater acceleration increase always results from adding another Artificial Mass instead of another Gravity Generator"" and demonstrate why this is wrong.  I'm assuming that we only care about increasing the acceleration of the ship and that we're not trying to minimize the number of blocks or power requirements.  Note that: mInertial = Deadweight + 8532 kg * nGravGen + 4444 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass mGravity = 50000 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass AGravity = 9.81 m/s2 * nGravGen    ""Deadweight"" is the sum total inertial mass of anything that isn't a Space Ball, Artificial Mass, or Gravity Generator.  So, cockpits, thrusters, gyroscopes, reactors, and the like.  As you note, the acceleration of the ship is: AShip = (mGravity*AGravity) / mInertial  What I want to do now is take the derivative of AShip with respect to nGravGen, and then take the derivateive of AShip with respect to nArtMass.  To do that, I need to substitute for mGravity, AGravity, and mInertial.  AShip = (50000 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) * 9.81 m/s2 * nGravGen / (Deadweight + 8532 kg * nGravGen + 4444 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass)  Warning: Significant amounts of Precalculus incoming!  Remember that the Quotient rule is: d(Top(x)/Bottom(x))/dx = [ dTop/dx * Bottom - Top * dBottom/dx ] / Bottom2  That is, the derivative of a quotient with respect to x, where both the top and bottom are functions of x, is the derivative of the top times the bottom, minus the top times the derivative of the bottom, all divided by the bottom   squared.  Also, the term ""50000 kg * 9.81 m/s2"" will appear a LOT in intermediate calculations, so I'm going to define this force as 1 Werewolf = 490500 N.  Finally, we're going to do a comparison between two different derivatives that will both have 1/Bottom2 in common, so this will not be expanded out.  Then:  d(AShip)/d(nArtMass) = [ dTop/dnArtMass * Bottom - Top * dBottom/dnArtMass ] / Bottom2  = [ (50000 kg * 9.81 m/s2 * nGravGen) * (Deadweight + 8532 kg * nGravGen + 4444 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) - (50000 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) * 9.81 m/s2 * nGravGen * 4444 kg ] / Bottom2  d(AShip)/d(nArtMass)  = [ Deadweight * Werewolf  * nGravGen    + 8532 kg * Werewolf  * nGravGen2    + 4444 kg * Werewolf  * nArtMass * nGravGen    + SumSpaceBallMass * Werewolf  * nGravGen    - 4444 kg * Werewolf * nArtMass * nGravGen    - SumSpaceBallMass * 4444 kg * 9.81 m/s2 * nGravGen] / Bottom2    Two of these terms cancel.  Others combine.  d(AShip)/d(nArtMass) = [ (Deadweight + SumSpaceBallMass * (1 - 0.08888) ) * Werewolf * nGravGen + 8532 kg * Werewolf * nGravGen2 ] / Bottom2  Note, in particular, that the benefit of adding another Artificial Mass depends on how many Gravity Generators you have.  Now, for the derivative with respect to nGravGen:  d(AShip)/d(nGravGen) = [ dTop/dnGravGen * Bottom - Top * dBottom/dnGravGen ] / Bottom2  = [ (50000 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) * 9.81 m/s2 * (Deadweight + 8532 kg * nGravGen + 4444 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) - (50000 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) * 9.81 m/s2 * nGravGen * 8532 kg ] / Bottom2  d(AShip)/d(nGravGen)  = [ 50000 kg * nArtMass * 9.81 m/s2 * Deadweight    + 50000 kg * nArtMass * 9.81 m/s2 * 8532 kg * nGravGen    + 50000 kg * nArtMass * 9.81 m/s2 * 4444kg * nArtMass    + 50000 kg * nArtMass * 9.81 m/s2 * SumSpaceBallMass    + SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * Deadweight    + SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * 8532 kg * nGravGen    + SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * 4444 kg * nArtMass    + SumSpaceBallMass2 * 9.81 m/s2    - 50000 kg * nArtMass * 9.81 m/s2 * nGravGen * 8532 kg    - SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * nGravGen * 8532 kg ] / Bottom2  Some terms cancel, others combine. d(AShip)/d(nGravGen)  = [ nArtMass * Werewolf * Deadweight    + nArtMass * Werewolf * 4444kg * nArtMass    + nArtMass * Werewolf * SumSpaceBallMass    + SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * Deadweight    + SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * 4444 kg * nArtMass    + SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * SumSpaceBallMass] / Bottom2  d(AShip)/d(nGravGen)  = [ nArtMass * Werewolf * (Deadweight + 4444kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) + SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * (Deadweight + 4444 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) ] / Bottom2  Note, in particular, that the benefit of adding another Gravity Generator depends on how many Artificial Masses you have.  Now for the reason we went through all this math: we want to know, for a given ship configuration, whether we get more acceleration from another Gravity Generator or another Artificial Mass.  The comparison is:  d(AShip)/d(nArtMass) =? d(AShip)/d(nGravGen)  ...where I'm using ""=?"" to denote ""Are there equal, or is one greater than the other?""  For ther rest of the algebra, we can treat this as an equation, such as multiplying or adding to both sides.  [ (Deadweight + SumSpaceBallMass * (1 - 0.08888) ) * Werewolf * nGravGen + 8532 kg * Werewolf * nGravGen2 ] / Bottom2   =?   [ nArtMass * Werewolf * (Deadweight + 4444kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) + SumSpaceBallMass * 9.81 m/s2 * (Deadweight + 4444 kg * nArtMass + SumSpaceBallMass) ] / Bottom2  Multiply both sides of the equation by Bottom2.  Then, assume that SumSpaceBallMass is zero (just to make the equation less ugly, but this does mean that anyone interested in the effect of Space Balls will need to pick up from the previous step).  Deadweight * Werewolf * nGravGen + 8532 kg * Werewolf * nGravGen2   =?   nArtMass * Werewolf * (Deadweight + 4444kg * nArtMass)  Divide both sides by Werewolf.  Deadweight * nGravGen + 8532 kg * nGravGen2   =?   nArtMass * (Deadweight + 4444kg * nArtMass)  Deadweight * nGravGen + 8532 kg * nGravGen2   =?   nArtMass * Deadweight + 4444kg * nArtMass2  From the above comparison, it becomes clear that sometimes it's better (for ship acceleration) to add another Gravity Generator instead of adding another Artificial Mass.  Therefore, it is NOT always more effective to use more mass blocks and only a single gravity generator  Quad Erat Demonstradum.  ...  I want to reiterate that most of Werewolf_14's writeup is excellent, but I don't see how he drew the conclusion of ""Use only 1 Gravity Generator"" from the rest of his post."
spaceengineers,3donl3,Danjiano,2,Sat Jul 18 17:13:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that.    I was only considering using either more mass blocks and one gravity gen or more gravity gens and one mass block.  Of those two cases,  I have the single gravity generator and multiple mass blocks as being better.  Upon finding the other guide and calculator and realizing my oversight, I put strikethroughs over that section.  Apparently I missed an important part I wanted to redact and will correct."

Naming and using blocks for the orientation however is pretty outdated by now and you should prefer using the GridIntegerToWorld method. You can also get the local orientation of a block within the grid so you can get make method for local matrix to world matrix for position and orientation.

I know that aint a simple ""Just do XY and Z and you are done"" answer, but there is no such thing.    As for making a matrix out of the orientation vectors, you can use          /// <summary>       /// Creates a world matrix with the specified parameters.       /// </summary>       /// <param name=""position"">Position of the object.

The services themselves are fine, but VMs are simply not made for a single-thread-intensive application like SE. They're all about distributed load, getting a processor speed above 2.4 GHz usually requires getting a box with at least 8 cores, which means you're wasting most of what you're paying for. On either services, those boxes are > $300/mo, running you over $1k on Azure.   If you've been given a rack with at least one core > 3 Ghz you'll be good to go. That was very generous of them. You'll want at least 2-3 GB RAM to take advantage, there are a lot of memory leaks and less frequent restarts = good.   I've had pretty good experience on Hostaspace, where they take an 8 core 3.4 Ghz and give 1 core to each server.   Regarding OS... I've run it on both Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2012 with similar performance. Either should be better than Win 7 simply because you have way less user-land bloat."

Now you can even chain them together so that the next mission will start as soon as you win the current one.    For example I myself am working on a scenario that revolves around the players being part of a rescue/repair team sent out to a remote R&D lab that has recently gone dark (no communication).  The players are to be limited in Oxygen, unable to build new blocks, and limited in power themselves as they have only a SAR craft with enough parts to repair the necessary items for communication (radio parts and so on).   As they arrive at the site they will discover the power is working sporadically in different sections and will have to decide between routing power for Oxygen scrubbers (getting more O2) or power for opening doors, and establishing communication.  Spoilers: (cause I dont know how/if reddit has a spoiler hiding tag thing or not) It also is going to include terminal reports that detail the issues leading up to the black out, what happened to all the crew/staff, and being a larger facility is going to have explosive reactions when power is rerouted back to certain sections meant to simulate catastrophic failures in systems.  The idea is that the players will not come with enough resources to succeed in the mission and survive, so will have to scavenge what they can from the facility. Ontop of that the facility will be largely inaccessible to them without restoring some sources of power."

spaceengineers,3dobon,LCCX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"The potential for PvE scenarios is currently most limited by a lack of NPCs. To the best of my knowledge:  1) It is relatively hard to set up any interesting combat, even harder to set up combat which is not easily outsmarted in a second playthrough, and impossible to set up randomized combat encounters.  2) It is impossible to automatically, dynamically update faction standing (i.e. enemy, ally, etc.).  3) It is impossible to set up interactive trade, or otherwise set up any kind of economy/ecosystem.  I think that the best possible, most interesting scenarios currently possible at the moment include:   Timed Tower Defense - in a non-exploration world, survive for X minutes while waves of enemies (turreted drones) spawn following a patrol path around your asteroid(s). I don't know if you need to prevent players from leaving the immediate area, or how you could if you did need to. Can you make players lose if they leave a designated box/volume/area? Can you make drones spawn near and follow players under certain conditions? Tower Defense Build - in a non-exploration world, successfully build X ship blueprint while waves of enemies (turreted drones) spawn following a patrol path around your asteroid(s). Since players have to mine material in order to build the goal blueprint, I think you don't need to prevent players from leaving the immediate area. Perhaps you could require the players to fly/jump the ship to a GPS coordinates goal. Meteor Mining - in an exploration world with significant meteor swarms, require players to mine and accumulate X items (ore, refined items, components). Here too you could have a ""and get to X GPS coordinates"" at the end. Pirate Base - in a non-exploration world with a single crappy asteroid, require players to raid passing cargo ships in order to accumulate X items or build X ship blueprint (a nice big pirate ship!). Convoy Defense - spawn a set of friendly drones moving slowly from point A to point B, and respawning sets of enemy drones patrolling through the area. The players must escort at least X of the allied cargo ships to point B. Blockade Runner - players must get a ship from point A to point B without using a jump drive, and respawning sets of enemy drones patrolling through the area."

There literally nothing underneath it.. Everything is a voxel surface, and the mesh deforms when you mine it..   Though mining more and more would ultimately actually make more surface area to render. But that is negligible compared to the planet itself.   In other words to the PC the planet and asteroids are already hollow ;)"
spaceengineers,3dnvw0,fanzypantz,4,Fri Jul 17 21:06:10 2015 UTC,The voxel takes up space in memory too you know.
spaceengineers,3dnvw0,klousGT,3,Sat Jul 18 03:21:54 2015 UTC,"True but it doesnt send the full planet voxel data trough internet. im guessing its streaming whats needed (whats visible), thats why it sometimes lags when you drill. A side effect is that you cant not hack the game and see where the ores are since its serverside."
spaceengineers,3dnvw0,whaleboobs,3,Sat Jul 18 07:31:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah most likely when you load the map the planet get loaded to memory. And when someone drills, only those changes will get sent to the other clients (right now it is sending that to every player no matter how far away, but when multiplayer is redone it will only send that information to people nearby, and when those not nearby come to the place drilled it will update it for them as well to minimize server lag)  And I doubt that they need to load the entire inside of planets and asteroids, because that probably dont even exist in any form or shape until you start drilling it and it reveals what is under it based on seeds, code and math. I am pretty sure when you drill it figures out what should be where.. I highly doubt that anything else than the surface is in memory. Because that would make every voxel game out there impossible to run. I mean Space Engineers voxels aren't blocks, the way it does it in SE is it just deforms the surface.   Let's take Minecraft for an example. The maps are rendered by a seed, which means the PC knows what block is where, but it does not need to render every block in the vicinity, it only renders the blocks that are visible, and each time you mine it probably consults the seed and world data which blocks are underneath the block you mine.

I'll have a massive industrial room with refineries and such, a large, heavily armored reactor room, multiple hangars for small ships, a big command center, a construction dock for building smaller large ships, etc, etc.  I want to get all of that deep under the surface with just a large armored door visible from above."
spaceengineers,3dnvw0,lowrads,3,Fri Jul 17 23:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is basically the whole reason Voxel-based games are a thing. The object exists as a whole, but only its exterior is rendered/held in memory until something affects that exterior, then the exterior changes to match the effect.    Imagine you have one cube. it has 6 sides, all of which are the same colour, texture and size, they take up 8KB of data each. If i take a craft knife and cut off a corner, we now have 3 of the original sides left (3x 8KB), 3 of the original sides partially deformed (lets say original 8KB + 2KB to track the deformation), and then a new face (lets say 5KB for colour & texture only, as the size can be procedurally drawn from the deformation information in the 3 sides touching it).    Your original cube was 6x 8KB sides, and lets say 4KB to define it as being all one cube, 52KB total. Your deformed cube has 3x 8KB, 3x 10KB and 1x 5KB and again 4KB to define it as one cube, albeit slightly disfigured now. New total of 63KB. Total increase in cube data amount, 11 KB.    Note, these values are wildly exaggerated, and probably not even in scale, I'm very very tired at the moment.    The tl;dr is that nothing under the surface exists until you deform it, and the only thing taking up space inside memory is the surface, no matter how deformed/broken/mined out it is. The definitions of what material exists in what areas of the voxel is predetermined through seed, but not definitive until you deform the asteroid (hence at a guess why the ore detector markers move around before you mine out the actual spot its on.)"

spaceengineers,3dnr4o,RA2lover,3,Sun Jul 19 17:48:21 2015 UTC,Permadeath can be fun in theory but I think you'd have a hard time maintaining server population.  What if you take advantage of the new scenario options to significantly penalize players for death rather than making it permanent?    For example:  I believe you can change faction ownership/membership under certain conditions.  If someone dies they spawn in a neutral area and all their owned blocks are given to a hostile NPC faction.  Then they either have to start over or brave their own defenses to take back the lost assets.  Not 100% sure that exactly this is currently possible.
spaceengineers,3dngyj,Fenrak0,6,Fri Jul 17 18:25:09 2015 UTC,when you introduce shields into a game it often leaves two options - spam the shit out of them or dont build them. This is bad for game play and I believe they should not be added in to the vanilla game.

spaceengineers,3dngyj,werewolf_14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:30 2015 UTC,I think so.  I only noticed it here.
spaceengineers,3dngyj,lowrads,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:43:57 2015 UTC,Distribution and concentration in the sense that:   your shield points are finite and don't regenerate under fire points are used based on attacked surface area and the kinetic energy of the attacks so being hit from multiple angles simultaneously lowers the overall effectiveness they only have the potential to dissipate 100% of an impact failure to dissipate 100% of an attack due to inadequate shield points results in proportionally reduced damaged and deflected trajectory    ?  Those were my immediate thoughts on reading your post.  I'm not sure how I feel about shields in vanilla Space Engineers though I believe they have the potential to be a balanced part of gameplay provided that anything done to increase their effectiveness has diminishing returns requiring careful planning and creativity on the player's part in order to use them in a meaningful way.
spaceengineers,3dngyj,werewolf_14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:06:53 2015 UTC,I really didn't make idea clear.  Shields would regen over time.  I was thinking like Star Trek online shielding.
spaceengineers,3dngyj,werewolf_14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:30:17 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar.  How do those work?
spaceengineers,3dngyj,werewolf_14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:07:02 2015 UTC,You have a finite pool that depletes as you take damage and regen when you stop taking damage.  The shields can be redirected an any direction while in battle.  Battle regen is slow.
spaceengineers,3dngyj,werewolf_14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, so they're omidirectional until they're redirected to a specific area?  Does that leave the rest vulnerable?"
spaceengineers,3dngyj,fanzypantz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:27:06 2015 UTC,Somewhat.  You have some residual shielding by reducing amount in one area and giving it to another.  You always want to keep at least a little in each.

While in development, any piece of software as complex as Space Engineers is going to have hundreds, if not thousands, of bugs to deal along with the possibility of some performance issues.

We are planning to have a more intense bug-fixing period during the upcoming weeks, so you should expect more fixed bugs in the next updates. Additionally, we are adding some more options and possibilities for the scenario creators. Designers are now able to display videos in the scenarios, either at the start or triggered by a condition. They can also add the option to load a map based on a scenario condition (currently available for offline/single player mode missions only). In addition, there is a new option to view the scenario’s progress and inform the player about all the rules set in the current scenario (list of win / lose conditions and basic settings). Moreover, there is a new option to add a player directly into a faction when he spawns in the medical room. When this option is enabled, the player that spawns in the medical room will automatically join the faction that the owner is part of. There is also a new world option for starting in respawn screen. Any player that plays a scenario should start in a spawn screen with listed spawn points. Even if the player plays an offline single player game, he should still start in the respawn screen. Lastly, we have improved the ownership/faction options in the scenario edit mode. When a player creates a faction, it is possible to add a 0 entity that will be added to the faction. He can then assign ownership of blocks to the NPC (the NPCs should be hostile to each other).

spaceengineers,3dj43f,shaggy1265,36,Thu Jul 16 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe I get downvoted to hell but fuck it.  I don't want planets. I want working multiplayer.  What are planets worth? They are just huge asteroids. I want to play with my friends, I want to build fleets over weeks and I want to fight epic battles without killing the server every few minutes.  I want to refine ore with my friends and yes I need 10 refinerys for that, and my friends too, we need 50 refinerys working at the same time without crashing the server. I don't know why people are so hyped about planets. The devs already made clear water is nearly impossible, so why would there be plants on planets anyway? What is so cool about beeing on a fucking huge asteroid, when I can't enjoy it with my friends? I don't need plantes right now, the only thing they will change is that the performence will get even more horrible.  Thats my opinion yours can be different."

The trouble is the game will become like warcraft with quests... I mean you can come up with a million and one quests, but realistically they can only be grouped into one of several objectives - go here and destroy this, go here and defend this, go here and pick this up, take this thing from A to B etc... That isn't to say it can't be executed in a compelling way, but I'm not sure it'll be the boon they think it will."
spaceengineers,3dj43f,loofou,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"They have only been around since April.  I think it is a little early to say they are putting too much focus on scenarios. I agree they shouldn't focus too hard on them, so if the scenario updates are as frequent 3 months from now as they are now, maybe it's time to reshift focus.  I don't think this will be the case though."
spaceengineers,3dj43f,1337GameDev,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"Well, from an outside view this might look like a ""simple"" quest system, but the funny thing is: It already has more constraints and options for winning or losing a scenario than most games with more hard-set missions. If you break down the levels in most games, it comes down to a ""arrive at point X, then load next level"". That's the basic logic behind it. Of course there are many trigger points along the way, which will give some story or additional challenges, but in the end you only ""win"" a level, if you get to said point X. What makes the difference is level design and narrative, both things that have nothing to do with the Scenario Editor per se. The scenario editor is a tool for making the lives of level designers (and modders) easier. And if you ever have seen good level designers at work, you will know that they can make awesome stuff with even less options than the scenario editor is currently providing.  So what you are seeing are only the tools. I guess you had some basic ideas yourself about possible scenarios after you've seen the latest update videos. I don't expect you to be a professional level designer, but you still had some ideas. With most tools, laymen wouldn't even know where to start, let alone have actual ideas about how to use it. Now think about what crazy things professional level designers can do with such a tool ;)"
spaceengineers,3dj43f,darkthought,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"Well what other objectives are there in a shooter?   Usually they have you explore, then retrieve something, then defend something or destroy something.   Combining them in interesting ways to achieve some goal is what people will want.   It WILL be a boon, as it adds goals to the game in ways that are not hard coded but stored as parsed data files via an editor. Very powerful."

Eagerly await one of the most important releases in the game's history and one of the most significant game releases in gaming   Eh, this is not the most significant game release in gaming. And it never will be even close to what AAA companies have to offer.   Cry when it doesn't happen the week you want it to and you're given bug fixes and scenario editor options instead   I don't care about planets, I wanted them to actually finish the DX11 models or added some new features, few hours ago I made a post talking about this exact thing.  I am dissapointed that even with all of that money we still don't have many features that were promised, like fucking rails.

So in your example, the case of DX11, they got it working. First they implemented it, with some ""token"" models. Then they fixed the inevitable bugs/problems (""bloom"" comes to mind). And then more bug fixes.   Nowhere in an alpha life cycle should you be going beyond that. Move on to next feature (current month: scenarios, next month: probably planets, after that: probably AI, etc.)  After all features are complete, game goes to beta for content, remaining bugfixing and tweaks (i.e. DX11 models, balancing overpowered stuff, etc).   That's just how these things go. As you'll probably see, in the next updates they WON'T be adding scenarios, but scenario options (just like when they added DX11, the next step wasn't a bunch of models). Sometimes they'll release a scenario with an update, but only as a means of exemplifying what the scenario update changed, typically not something they expect people to consider a ""real"" scenario.   By doing things this way, they allow offloading of work (like mentioned in today's post, about letting their level designers get busy). It also allows the community to start using the new features (like all the mods that HAVE been updated to DX11 and will probably start uncovering bugs with scenarios)..."

I setup 4 turrets in a cross. I also setup 4 timers with the following settings:  Timer 1 - Turns on decoy 1, turns off the rest, triggers Timer 2  Timer 2 - Turns on decoy 2, turns off the rest, triggers Timer 3  Timer 3 - Turns on decoy 3, turns off the rest, triggers Timer 4  Timer 4 - Turns on decoy 4, turns off the rest, triggers Timer 1  When you trigger any of the timers (they all use Trigger Now). It puts all the decoys in a loop where they turn on and off really fast. With this method, the turrets have a very hard time locking on.  It works at longer distances if you spread out the decoys and add more to the loop."

We can use decoys to attract fire to a certain point which we could then heavily armour in comparison.  So if you did this for each face of the ship you could effectively have Forward, Aft, Port, Starboard, Ventral and Dorsal shielding and the ""Shields at 70% Captain"" would refer to how much of armour was left before the turret destroyed the decoy.  It hadn't occurred to me 'til now that using Decoys internally might actually be a useful tactic, I'd always assumed chaff.

spaceengineers,3dkq19,fanzypantz,2,Fri Jul 17 08:45:32 2015 UTC,"My only problem with it is the fact that, other than switching to manual and trying to take those decoys out by hand (which would be practically impossible, especially if they're hidden behind heavy armor, while the enemy maneuvers around, and while you're under constant heavy fire from his fully operational turrets), you have no way of countering this tactic.  Sure, you could make your own large turrets on rotors, and operate them simultaneously via that ""Multi-turret"" workshop script (which btw does not recommend using more than 3), but they are very expensive, and waste ammo rather quickly (not to mention, laggy and unreliable).  From an engineering perspective, the decoys could just be ignored, letting the turrets focus use the heat signature from the enemy's engines as a target (with the addition of a proper sensor, I suppose), or the aim improved slightly, by averaging it based off the positions of the decoys (aka ""blindly shooting at the middle""), but both of those would require a modification of the turret behavior, and might end up dis-balancing the game more.  All in all, it's easier to just add a delay to decoy activation, imo."
spaceengineers,3dkq19,Seukonnen,5,Fri Jul 17 08:57:35 2015 UTC,"From an engineering perspective, the decoys could just be ignored   Heat sensitive missiles are made for one reason: planes and vehicles generally creates heat from their engines.. But there are counter-measures for that as well.  From an engineering standpoint you literally have no way of getting past the forced locking on decoys because we have no real options on what blocks to shoot at.. If you want to take game balance into consideration, keeping this bug is not the greatest idea, unless you figure out a magical way of making turrets target without you doing all the targeting yourself manually or some other way.  This is a bug and needs fixing.. Sure you engineered something. But this is a game and it needs something called balance.   I am not arguing against it being a cool thing. But it definitely would break game balance and lets say you and your enemy both have this and literally nothing can happen with automatic turrets(didn't think about that did ya).. Yeah that would be very boring gameplay.  (I am not arguing against IamKroopz)"
spaceengineers,3dkq19,Skwuruhl,2,Fri Jul 17 10:48:37 2015 UTC,"There are some solutions that can be used against an opponent using this system. The turrets may not be able to fully lock on, but they still target the approximate location of the decoys. You could group some turrets and set toolbar actions to manually toggle turret firing. You'd be spraying bullets everywhere, but rocket impacts would still be pretty effective.  Torpedos (Guided and Dumb-Fire) would still be very effective as well since nothing would be trying to shoot them down (Unless you set lower max ranges to your turrets to deal with close threats). And let's not forget capital ship melee combat (ramming, grinding, etc).  I don't think this breaks the game balance, but rather forces players to approach combat with more critical thinking and strategy. If you can't out-gun your opponent, you can always try to out-wit them."

If there were, for example, a way to counter this with engineering then I would say it's fair.  But the only real way to counter it is to employ enough people to man every turret .

That can be with in-game things, as well as timescales in my opinion.  I understand that people have paid money for these games, and yeah, I can expect a little disappointment amongst some people (I'm a tad disappointed myself in all honesty), but you've invested in a work-in-progress essentially, so you need to be patient with things.  It feels like people forget that early-access games are, in most cases, alpha/beta versions of the game, and instead think it's getting a game early at a cheaper price. My mentality, and I've applied this to DayZ, too, is that when I bought the game, I asked myself if I'm happy to buy this game at this price in its current state, and not so much on potential or expected RRP of the game at the end of its development cycle.  So far I've poured 66 hours into Space Engineers, 145 into DayZ, and 4 into Watch Dogs.

Space Engineers has made a lot of money in early access. And with that comes an expectation. As with most kickstarted projects, meeting your goals and surpassing them is met with stretch goals. These goals are expanded game content from what was originally promised. This is a general practice in good humour, and to stimulate further sales.  What Keen did with the excess money, was instead launch a brand new game, Medieval Engineers, and start a fully-fledged AI project that may or may not see the light of day in Space Engineers in some form. This is where the problem blooms. Frankly I was pissed off when both of these things were announced. Your money, and my money, in their entirety were not placed directly into SE production overhead. I see that as a bit of a dick move.  Ever since that point I have placed Keen under much more scrutiny. It stopped being a friendship and instead became a business. SE seems to have the same size team, and advances at the same steady pace. Incredibly frustrating considering SE has sold so well.  I had patience, and still do to some degree, but I won't apologize for them anymore since they took my money and spent it on other ventures while SE is still in alpha and a buggy mess.

You are talking about space engineers like it is a kickstarter, but it is not a kickstarter. The SE team did not give us stretch goals or tell us to expect anything or even promise you the money was going to go to SE. You have unreasonable expectations of an indie development team that really are just doing what they want to do, and you have no say in that. When you purchased the game, you were making a conscious decision to fund them and play their game, but if they wanted the rules and guidelines enforced by kickstarter then they would have made a kickstarter. Nowhere did they promise anything to their consumer, and all of what you are mad at them for is baseless assumptions that you made yourself based on other indie games. Keen and the SE team are not perfect and they could communicate more, but I doubt they will after the pissfest following the sneak at planets.

spaceengineers,3dlnn1,LaboratoryOne,8,Fri Jul 17 07:23:57 2015 UTC,Oxygen tanks and generators on small ships have the double small port spaced like that on them. I tend to plug them directly into the cockpit since it seems designed for that.   Side note the cockpit acts as a conveyor block and when inside you can move items in and out of your inventory.

spaceengineers,3dlnn1,draeath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:45:07 2015 UTC,you can attach a conveyor block and then a small cargo container to that conveyor to one of the ports on a small cockpit. Then you put an oxygen bottle into the small container as you can put large items in them manually. The oxy bottle will refill the cockpit for you. I dont play 1 times so you can fit bottles into them.  This is the best way to oxygenate really small craft.
spaceengineers,3di40y,bonkersinspace,9,Thu Jul 16 13:31:03 2015 UTC,"So you match the planet's gravity, essentially nullifying it and allowing for thruster control as if it were outside the gravity well?  Very nice."

spaceengineers,3di40y,lordkrike,2,Thu Jul 16 14:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess that would work. I was thinking about using the autopilot to compensate for drifting sideways and keep it stationary, but then it rotates and crashes."

I have a build I'm planning this on, can you give any insight into the process of achieving this please? I have all the blocks in place (kind of) but haven't tried calibrating yet and would love any insight you may have."
spaceengineers,3di40y,BTT2,2,Thu Jul 16 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"I started off with a ""gravity engine"", meaning a spherical grav gen and a mass block on every side except the top. I thought this would help stabilize it, I don't know though, because I haven't tested any other configurations. I made it symmetric so that the center of mass is in the middle. You should keep the center off mass lower than the grav gen so it doesn't flip over. Later I added more mass blocks and 5 normal grav gens on top of the existing one. I copied this ""engine"" 4 times and connected them up. Again you should make everything symmetric and keep the center of mass lower than the grav gens. Then add the stuff you need. I have 4 refineries, 9 assemblers a ton of batteries, 8 jump drives and so on in this thing."
spaceengineers,3di40y,grimxxmastr,2,Thu Jul 16 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"Cool cool, and the settings for the grav gens? Any interesting shenanigans going on there or are they maxed pushing/pulling against the planet?  I assume there's a sweet spot that give you a neutral ""buoyancy"" if you will, is this the case ?"
spaceengineers,3di40y,Fortiman,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it depends on the mass of the ship, about of mass blocks/grav gens and gravity of the planet, which varies with altitude. So you have to fiddle around a bit. Usually you can get 0-0.2 m/s with the toolbar increase and decrease buttons, but have to fine tune it to stay stationary. But my setup is way stronger than planetary gravity. It gets me from 0 to 1000 m/s in about 15-30 sec. So if you make it weaker you can probably balance it out from toolbar. I'll post the design on the workshop once it's finished."
spaceengineers,3di40y,amkoc,6,Thu Jul 16 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"This gives me an idea, would it be possible to have a ""tunnel"" from the surface into space, with gravity generators counteracting the gravity of the planet, thus creating a 0g area in which you can fly a ship through, if the gravity is too strong to take off otherwise?"
spaceengineers,3di40y,RaliosDanuith,6,Thu Jul 16 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"I had a similar idea. Your ship would probably need artificial mass to be affected by the grav gens, though."
spaceengineers,3di40y,drewdus42,2,Thu Jul 16 15:31:48 2015 UTC,"I like the idea. I think the distance to orbit is 10-20 km which would be a rather long tunnel, but I think it is doable."

spaceengineers,3di40y,Apch,2,Thu Jul 16 16:18:47 2015 UTC,You forget that gravity gens can be a bitch to get them to do what you want them to do. They're very finicky about mass distribution etc. . If we get the ability to use them on planets I'd be willing to bet that they'd be a lot more finicky than they were before (They may incorporate the natural gravity mod to affect ships). Also look how symmetrical OP's ship is - any larger and that would be a bitch to build. Also if they don't incorporate NG you'll have to work with evenly distributing artificial mass so it does tilt over in atmo and crash to the ground.
spaceengineers,3di40y,mattstorm360,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly had no problems with the gravity gens.

With dx11 the atmosphere looks nice but the textures and the lightning are glitchy. Planets are probably released today or in the next two weeks so it's really not worth the hassle.

In fact they'd have a very real use on stationary things on planets.  With a ship moving, ladders were fine, until the ship started to turn.

They take electricity and ionize a gas that is then accelerated out using electrically generated magnetic fields.  Those reactors are generating all of that electricity this kind of system needs to produce the level of thrust we get.  If they decide to add a gas then xenon or argon are the two we use in real ion engines.
spaceengineers,3dlcn2,Callous1970,5,Fri Jul 17 05:29:18 2015 UTC,"I am aware that the current meta for the engines is that they resemble ion engines. I fear I may of over simplified my question a bit much. It is already know that irl we can generate fuel from ice. The question is simply how other players would feel about a ""liquid"" fuel for small ships instead of uranium. Not only would it give more of a purpose to large ships but would also limit the range of smaller craft.  This is not a suggestion for implementation. This is not a mod idea. This is a simply a question of opinion."

spaceengineers,3dlcn2,Serithwing,4,Fri Jul 17 22:13:22 2015 UTC,Back in the 1960's there was a test car that had a small nuclear reactor instead of a combustion engine.   It never made production due to fears of an explosion but it had a ~50 years of  run time of uranium in it. Many of our satellites also use nuclear reactors and/or solar for power.  In game small ships can use a combination of solar and nuclear power I see no need to add a liquid fuel into the game.

Using thermal energy from a nuclear source, you heat up hydrogen to the point where its kinetic energy gives you thrust.  Technically in that case, hydrogen is the fuel, and the nuclear power is just a heater, but then it fits as a byproduct of oxygen generation from ice, and use of nuclear.  Nerva Engine Project"

There's a halfway decent in-universe explanation, and as others have pointed out there's already a large number of small vehicles that have used nuclear reactors or batteries to power themselves.  I do like the idea of an additional system where Ice has to be broken down into O2 and H2 (stored in tanks like O2 is now) which can then be pumped to more powerful thrusters via the conveyor system. The new thrusters would be more ""efficient"" in that they use less power to generate fuel/thrust and would accelerate ships better than the current electric only ones."

I have a mild dislike for gravity generator propulsion because it smothers a wide range of interesting choices for ship sizes and maneuverability, it trivializes many aspects of construction, planning, and strategy. It's not that it has no drawbacks (damage causing the CoM to shift can be a headache in certain setups), I just think they're not as significant as they should be.  If I had my way, I'd do the following:   Add a slider for ships in creative mode that lets you multiply thruster/gyro output to where you feel it should be. Rebalance the large thruster to be more efficient than the small thruster, not less. Keep all the current functionality of gravity generator propulsion, but cause the energy draw to be proportional to the mass being moved such that it will still provide more power for its size than thrusters, but not by such an obscene amount.   This would make the gravity drive a powerful ""high-tech"" option for propulsion, requiring much more power, in exchange for better performance, and the protection of having an internal drive.   Edit: My large thruster information was bad, it's slightly more mass efficient than the small thruster. I'm still in favor of improving it further for other reasons."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,Cerus,10,Thu Jul 16 16:17:40 2015 UTC,"I admit that I was a bit conflicted, but I really like your idea of increasing the power draw proportionally to the mass being moved."

A Heavily armoured 15 million kg warship should not glide around faster than my light fighter that accelerates at 33 M/s  Add an equal and opposite force on the grav drive as it propels artificial mass. This removes grav drives from the game and give torpedo launchers recoil.   Also buff large ship thrusters thrust by about 2 times. I don't mind if they don't put out as much thrust per kg as small ship ones provided they are more power efficient to compensate"
spaceengineers,3dimhq,Khourieat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"Also buff large ship thrusters thrust by about 2 times. I don't mind if they don't put out as much thrust per kg as small ship ones provided they are more power efficient to compensate   I don't think that's enough. I tried a ~10m kg ship with about 10-large 15 thrusters, and it is painfully slow to accelerate. It either needs to go higher, or we need an even bigger thruster. Moving laterally with just 4 thrusters is also basically impossible, so making minor position corrections is really, really boring.  I'm eventually going to upgrade it to about 36 rear-facing thrusters. Started before jump drives were added. Finishing it out of sheer stubbornness."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,Purple_Antwerp,2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:56 2015 UTC,That's really not many thrusters for something so massive; think about if that same thrust level worked on a 1/2m kg ship.  A few large thrusters and its as nimble as a fighter.  But overall agree they need a buff!

Rebalancing thruster and gravity propulsion in the context of limited jump drive capabilities seems worth pursuing."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,Ernic42,3,Thu Jul 16 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"Well, this is actually a great debate. Are jump drives overpowered on battleships? I see them as an escape tool. Without this, large armored warships are very slow, and therefore very vulnerable. No matter how much armor you dump into a ship, its weapons, thrusters, and sometimes cockpit /are/ exposed, and against disposable attack drones, I feel you'd lose any battle of attrition. Even if you could get away, you'd suffer damage, and where would you flee to? You'd either bring the enemy back to your home, or if that ship IS your sole home, there really isn't any safety; there could be enemies behind every asteroid! With the inclusion of Jump Drives, you always have an escape route. It's not /too/ overpowered, because it has to charge for a full ten seconds. A lot of damage can occur in that time. That, too, is only if you hit the JD immediately. And because of the large size of the drives, it's usually pretty easy to deduce where they're located on any given ship. You want to interfere with a jump drive? Try heavy ordinance. :P"
spaceengineers,3dimhq,Cerus,2,Thu Jul 16 20:45:25 2015 UTC,"In my one on one tests, I've always been able to escape with my jump drives buried deep.

If the ship is prepping for a jump, and lets say an enemy fighter attaches via landing gear, the fighter warps with it. If the fighter has another jump ship to support it, it can relay the coordinates to their carrier, and the attacker jumps to meet the ship that thought it escaped.  If landing gears get a bug fix to be less explosive, or when multiplayer is optimized more for them, i'm thinking attach-craft could be a thing."

So sure the small block large/small thruster is more efficient than the large block large/small thruster. That is however true for all small blocks compared to their large blocks. The small block reactors are much denser just like ther small block batteries are.    The reason for that seems to be that keen wants the small block ships to be more efficient while large block ships have some exclusive blocks like refineries, assembler, jump drive etc"
spaceengineers,3dimhq,Cerus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:12:21 2015 UTC,"Large Ship - Large Thrusters are 2x as efficient in area cross section, but equal or less in every other regard."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,plaYer2k,2,Fri Jul 17 13:32:38 2015 UTC,"large block large thrusters are 2x as efficient as what? What do you compare them to and especially important is how you define ""efficiency""?    For me, efficiency is the ThrustPerWatt [N/W] yield and there small block thrusters are much more efficient. About 7.5 times as efficient as large block thrusters that is.    The ThrustPerSurface value sure is 2x higher when you compare the large and small thruster for any given grid size as each grid sizes vanilla thruster is balanced over their volume so far. As the large thruster uses 24 blocks volume and the small thruster only 2 blocks volume, the large thruster also has 12x as much thrust with an 12x as high energy consumption as the small thruster. Ignoring a few tiny roundings.    However, the mass for large thrusters is not 12x the mass of a small thruster for each grid size but instead less.    So the mass aswell as the ThrustPerSurface make large thrusters better than small thrusters if you got the space for them.    though i still dont know if you were refering to the actual grid size ([0.5m]³ vs [2.5m]³) or the blocks sizes (2 blocks volume vs 24 blocks volume) with that statement. If it was the grids size, you wont see that happen any time soon due to the already mentioned reasons above."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,Cerus,2,Fri Jul 17 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, interesting. Looks like my information was wrong. After reviewing everything, looks like the only real negative for large thrusters on the 2.5m3 grid is the effective health and redundancy. Thanks for the correction."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,thelittleartist,7,Fri Jul 17 19:33:41 2015 UTC,"I'm probably one of the loudest shouters when it comes to whats wrong with grav drives, and Cerus has it right. Gravity Generator based drives are far too cheap for how effective they are.    I have no issue with having this mechanic in the game, i just think its been done poorly. Accelerating a 200million KG large ship to 100m/s in a straight line should either take a ludicrous amount of energy, or a ludicrous amount of time. With a grav drive, it takes neither, and it isn't even expensive to build."

spaceengineers,3dimhq,fanzypantz,2,Thu Jul 16 16:58:03 2015 UTC,to be fair.. the game is rather unrealistic already.. I mean if you wanted to be completely correct about it you would need KSP physics.. But nobody would be able to do that well unless you have KSP experience.  While being there in the asteroids belt we are already orbiting really fast. But we can't go faster than 104m/s..
spaceengineers,3dimhq,LoneGhostOne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:04:56 2015 UTC,"i said the game is built around newtons laws, not orbital mechanics. Any game of this type is going to have to have speed limits in the game engine because there's simply no way to work around that with modern tech.   The main attraction of this game has always been being able to build ships and then crash them in a realistic mannor. this makes use of the first three of newton's laws in every aspect with the only exceptions being large, slow-moving bodies, and gravity generators."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,fanzypantz,2,Fri Jul 17 16:02:53 2015 UTC,"Simple solution: remove the matter block  I thought the matter block was retarded, and it has stayed retarded. The ship should use its own mass not mass blocks.. But because it would be impossible to have gravity on your ship you would need to have it like before mass block game into play.. It was meant to be used for cars and that.."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,Duhya,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The grav gen is necessary because Keen can't create realistic human zero-G movement(the only game i've played that has it is Take on Mars), so having a ship without gravity would require using the jetpack all the time and be clunky. And in the early game mining with the handdrill you need gravity to easily mine."

spaceengineers,3dimhq,plaYer2k,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:09:04 2015 UTC,"How would using artificial gravity generators make planet engineering easier? They dont magically counter the planets natural gravity, hence why they just are artificial gravity generators. So in combination with artificial mass blocks they merely produce a local force on that block and nothing else. One had to nicely balance the force over time to stabilize the structure. That requires closed loop controls and thus university degree knowledge to properly calculate and stabilize it."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,sumguy720,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:07:41 2015 UTC,I have a couple consistency issues with artificial gravity. I like the concept in general but I think it could use tweaks   Energy usage needs to be proportional to forces applied. Floating debris should not be affected because it has no artificial mass The generators should obey conservation of momentum.   All in all this would be a pretty big nerf but it's really the only way it makes sense.
spaceengineers,3dimhq,plaYer2k,0,Thu Jul 16 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"The generators should obey conservation of momentum.   They dont even fall into the category where such a law can be applied. No physical collision here, only gravitational acceleration or curvance in space.    And the GGs energy consumption highly depends on the alteration of that gravitational acceleration / curvance in space. So it already does that. Adding other power requirements seems silly from a physics standpoint and make the GGs even more illogical."
spaceengineers,3dimhq,sumguy720,0,Fri Jul 17 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"You don't need a collision to conserve momentum. Momentum is always conserved unless you assume you have an isolated system (which is never true - unless you include the whole universe). Any force that the gravity generators exert on any other object needs to be counteracted by a force on the generator itself.   The gravity generator does not create a gravitational field, otherwise all massed objects would be affected by it. My view is that gravity generators simulate a gravitational field by applying forces at a distance on artificial mass blocks. How this could be done is beyond modern physics so you would have to take that element with a grain of salt, but it is a conceivable system.   From a physics standpoint it's illogical to assume a gravity generator generates an actual gravitational field. It's uniform across a solid area - not to mention discontinuous - and if you don't link the forces applied to a conserved system (IE, the universe) you'll get all sorts of free energy/free momentum (IE, gravity drives)"
spaceengineers,3dimhq,AirCav25,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:29:11 2015 UTC,"As a guy who's come to specialize in grav guns, I wholehearted agree.  Grav gens are ridiculously cheap in comparison to the power they provide.   Why don't they draw more power?  Especially since the original concept was for a single grav gen to provide artificial gravity for an entire ship/station.  So yes, up the power usage by several magnitudes.    I can't comment on large/small thruster power ratios (not enough experience).  I can see the argument for rebalancing."

You physically can't win an engagement unless you get a KO first strike. Theres no way to garuntee being able to hold a player in an engagement, and no way to chase them 99% of the time.

I found that one of my ships or structures was causing it - even when I copypasted all my stuff into a new world. Is the game slow even when you start a new world?  I started bringing my ships into the new world one by one until... I think I just got fed up of switching back and forth. So I never figured out what specific thing it was. But hopefully you don't have a special connection to one of those asteroids. Try it and see if you get the same success that I did. I know when it happens again it's the first thing I'll try. Good luck.  edit: in case anyone is wondering, yes I absolutely continued building and creating things in the new world with no slowdown after that. And no, by no means could it be considered that I had a lot of stuff, or very large entities that might have contributed to it. Just as with OP, from one day to the next (not even patch day) the slowdown turned itself on. No rhyme or reason.   edit2: yes, keep your lighting and shadows and res, etc. to what you normally play on. If it's the same situation as me, it's got nothing to do with your rig.

spaceengineers,3dii1r,dainw,2,Thu Jul 16 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"They're low mass, as individual plates, so they're all affected by gravity. If you had dropped one, fine - but you dropped a stack.

Edit:  Artificial mass and mass in Space Engineers employs a particularly interesting concept in physics: The idea that inertial mass and gravitational mass are not necessarily the same thing. Inertial mass describes how difficult it is to move an object. Gravitational mass describes how much gravitational fields affect an object. In real life these quantities are the same.

spaceengineers,3dme9e,bmalloy1,2,Fri Jul 17 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"Show me where they said that planets were more important. They never did. The closest thing you will find is them saying planets are coming first. That does NOT mean they're more important, just that they're easier to code."

It takes time. They have people working on it. Calm your thrusters."
spaceengineers,3dme9e,bmalloy1,-3,Fri Jul 17 15:54:36 2015 UTC,"I'm getting tired of people assuming any post about planets and multiplayer is about demanding why it isn't here. Notice how I asked why it wasn't the priority, not why it isn't here. Calm your thrusters."
spaceengineers,3dme9e,seafoodgar,2,Fri Jul 17 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"It IS a priority. They've been working it for MONTHS. For all you know, half their entire workforce is working to get it ready. Just because it hasn't been released yet doesn't mean it isn't a top priority."
spaceengineers,3dme9e,bmalloy1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:03:10 2015 UTC,"Also planets can be prepped piece by piece, like how we got grass and dirt.  But the new net code will need to be an all in if it's truly a rewrite."

spaceengineers,3dme9e,Angryfa,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:27 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't that be addressed first?   They have more than one team.  One is working on new netcode for multiplayer.  It should come soon, too."
spaceengineers,3dme9e,dce42,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't have added multiplayer at all before end of alpha, but because people these days are so unbelievably impatient, they had to.  It would be ok if people would play multiplayer with some reasonable expectations, but I see all the time people expecting fleet battles with 64 players or something as ridiculous as that.  As with planets, people should have reasonable expectations for the new multiplayer netcode. It won't turn this game into something it was never meant to be."
spaceengineers,3dme9e,TheSoftestTaco,2,Fri Jul 17 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"Because things like planets would cause them to rewrite the netcode once again.   The current mp was written in a month using the steam library, so it is understandable that it has issues."

Net code won't break from planets.... They just need to tell the net ode to sync day and night and voxels from planets basically.   After, they can optimize net code with features they want to avoid unforeseen hiccups.   I want mp as bad as you, but adding CORE game features is paramount to avoid redoing work."

spaceengineers,3delbz,NatWu,18,Wed Jul 15 17:55:38 2015 UTC,This thing is miniscule. Too small for its gravity to really be a factor. Larger objects with noticeable gravity tend to collapse into spherical shapes.

If you're on the smaller bulb, the attraction to it will probably be stronger due to the distance being very close despite the other side having more mass. But if you try to walk across the bridge, the distance to the larger bulb will be smaller and as the square of the distance dropped compared to the mass difference, would become the dominant source.  I don't think you'd ever be able to walk across the bridge, as you'd start climbing it, then fall across the distance.

The net center of mass would be in the big one, which would be where gravity acted from. Unless my understand of gravity and CoM is way off. You could stand on the far edge of the small bulb and fall to the lower one. Honestly, it might not take much to jump back up though, given how tiny it is...  Tl;dr Net CoM/CoG is in the big bulb and you couldn't walk between them (without jumping?).   Open to being corrected. Only have a few semesters of physics under my belt."
spaceengineers,3delbz,c_for,2,Thu Jul 16 03:39:56 2015 UTC,"From great distances, the net gravitational force you would experience would functionally be that of a point mass. Of course, from great distances, you wouldn't be experiencing much gravity from it at all.  However, since it's not spherical, the equation doesn't simplify down like that when you get closer. It becomes a really really nasty integral calculation that would probably be better represented by a vector field than anything. It will simplify into something roughly equivalent to a point mass far enough away, but if you're standing on the surface, things get wonky as one side pulls on you more as you're closer to it than the other.  Given how small 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (sp?) is, you wouldn't have enough gravity anyway to walk across its surface in the first place. You'd take a step, and the moment induced on your other foot would cause it to slide off and send you into a spin regardless of where you stood on the asteroid. If you're unlucky, you bounce off the surface, go flailing off into space, and MAYBE come back to it after a couple hours. Keep in mind, it's exerting the same gravity as a moderate sized mountain does on a hiker, which is to say ""not much.""  I recommend a very, very, very gentle drill to anchor yourself to the surface over the course of several hours.  TL;DR: Still couldn't walk between them, but only because you'd drip and sail off into space (almost) like a comet lander. Gravity is too weak to make much of a difference here.  EDIT: Looking at different images of the comet, you might be able to ""walk"" across the far side of the bridge (from this perspective) since the net effective gravitational force would be pulling you down towards the surface more than anything. I use walk in the broadest possible interpretation; I suspect anything more vigorous than an ""ooze"" (as much as humans could do that) would result in some stellar vertical jump scores."

spaceengineers,3dfm82,Cronyx,3,Wed Jul 15 23:44:39 2015 UTC,Or just griefing.
spaceengineers,3dfm82,MikeC2103,-1,Thu Jul 16 12:20:40 2015 UTC,"No one ever seems to be able to provide a non-subjective explanation for how ""griefing"" is different from ""non-consensual PVP"". Or, specifically, different from ""being on the receiving end of non-consensual PVP."" The very term, in common usage, seems like a manifestation of special pleading."
spaceengineers,3dfm82,creepig,2,Thu Jul 16 12:44:22 2015 UTC,"Griefing only really became a thing for me after dealing with Minecraft.   It wasn't the random PvP. It was spawn camping or the destruction of hours of work, for no other purpose than to piss someone off and destroy their fun.  At least in SE you can do a bit more to defend yourself without making everything indestructible."
spaceengineers,3dfm82,Ragejay,3,Fri Jul 17 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"Griefing is a special case of non-consensual PVP, in which you're taking cheap shots for the sole purpose of being a dick.  For example, using the respawn ships as kinetic missiles repeatedly is griefing.  It is 100% about intent.  Edit: to nip it in the bud, since I can tell that this is going to come up, there is no golden standard that requires that we define griefing objectively in order to chastise it.  Law, especially criminal law, regularly factors in an individuals intent when judging their actions."
spaceengineers,3dfm82,Cronyx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:57:00 2015 UTC,Just make sure you always have ammo in your turrets :) As a professional on griefology. Griefers like to give up quickly if they know they can't destroy their intended target. They simply migrate to the next server and repeat the cycle.
spaceengineers,3dfm82,creepig,-1,Thu Jul 16 13:09:47 2015 UTC,"The difference here is that, short of suicide, you can't ""stop playing"" life. A game, everyone opts in to participate. In a game like Eve Online, everyone opts in to participate in a brutal, Ayn Rand objectivist space opera of Megacorps, money, and non-consensual PVP of the most brutal caliber. There is no such thing as ""griefing"" in Eve Online. But you can stop playing at any time if you stop having fun. You don't, however, get to decree that the rules should be changed in order to facilitate your fun.  Playing To Win is the most distilled, fundamental, non-homogenized, elemental goal at the core of any ""game"" that includes success or fail conditions. And as such, the penultimate goal of any game that includes hard success or fail conditions is to win that game. To that end, in an economic or resource driven game, such as Space Engineers, I win by maintaining a monopoly of force projection. It's rare for any faction or individual to ever achieve this, but it's the reason for gathering resources, building weapons, flying to that first asteroid, taking the first step inside your starter ship, or even connecting to a multiplayer server in the first place.  If I am not cheating, then the only alternative must be that I am playing within the scope of the game mechanics. The game mechanics might be unfair, but that unfairness becomes a part of the ""meta"" of the game, a separate level of understanding, and why there are different tiers of characters in Smash Brothers, or Street Fighter.  In perusing the goal of a monopoly of force projection, without stepping over the line into cheating (not the same as understanding and incorporating game mechanics into your strategy, which is defined as ""meta""), ramming a starting ship into an enemy is instrumental in the intent of ""winning the game"" or ""achieving the success criteria, whilst diminishing the capacity of an opponent from achieving success criteria""  I've never heard an objective, pragmatic argument that would legitimize the term ""griefing"", to bring it into the realm of Competitive Play, and out of the realm of so called ""scrub-speak"" and special pleading. But I'm willing to entertain the possibility that such an argument can be made.  Admittedly, this all relates to competitive play. If playing in a creative world, where the object is to ""make things that look cool"", we're not so much playing a game anymore, because there aren't hard, quantifiable success or fail conditions, but more engaging in an exercise of creating art, using SE as a CAD program of sorts. In that scenario, no one has opted into PVP, and unplugging your computer would be as much griefing as shooting your ship, or ramming into it.   there is no golden standard that requires that we define griefing objectively in order to chastise it   But games, unlike art projects, require rules, often complex rules, in order to function. In computerized games, these are hard coded into the game's ""universe"". Editing the ""universal constants"" after play has begun (mods not withstanding, as everyone us using the same ones) are almost always a form of cheating. Operating within those universal constants, utilizing only the tools, resources, and physics contained within the game to achieve your goals are simply manifestations of very complex rules interacting.   It is 100% about intent.   Intent is arguably impossible to prove, because it is a subjective qualia on the other side of the phaneron, beyond the realm of objective and impartial audit. Making claims about intent necessarily includes philosophical assumptions that dilute hypothesis into projection, which disqualifies it from the critique of formal logic. It's also entirely superfluous, when the effects can be objectively measured, and placed into a hierarchical pass/fail framework that includes fail conditions at one extreme, and success conditions on the other. Does the action in question reduce, null-effect, or enhance my position relative to my opponents? Due to special relativity, it doesn't matter if I increase my speed, or reduce yours, I'm still getting ahead, closing the gap between us if behind, or widening it if ahead. That translates into a reduction of your force projection measures as a gain in mine, on the scale of relativity. This means that what you label ""griefing"", in actuality, fits within a measurable numberline of milestones between failure and success.  Without objective definitions, you are, by true dichotomy, invalidating someone's non-cheating strategy for purely subjective reasons (i.e. you don't ""like it"".)"
spaceengineers,3dfm82,Cronyx,3,Thu Jul 16 14:11:23 2015 UTC,That's a whole lot of tl;dr to defend shitty behavior on the part of shitty people.  Are you sure you don't want /r/philosophy or maybe one of the ancap subs?
spaceengineers,3dfm82,creepig,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:13 2015 UTC,"That's a whole lot of tl;dr to defend shitty behavior on the part of shitty people.   That's an awful lot of begging the question, subjective value judgement, and poisoning the well.  One of the tenants of information theory is that truth -- a form of order -- necessarily requires more expenditure of energy than fallacy -- a form of entropy. E.G., Defending the theory of evolution requires more energy as it it has higher information density and produces order vs ""lol god did it"", which produces more fallacy/fiction/fantasy and is thus more entropic in a closed system of information.  Noam Chomsky touched on this a bit; it's called the problem of concision.   ""The US media are alone in that you must meed the condition of concision. You've got to say things between two commercials. Or in six hundred words. And that's a very important fact, because the beauty of concision is that, you know, saying a couple of sentences between two commercials, the beauty of that is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. Suppose I get up on Nightline, and I'm given whatever it is, two minutes... and I say Kadafi's a terrorist or whatever, the Russians invaded Afghanistan, etc etc, all this sort of stuff, I don't need any evidence. Everybody just nods.  ""On the other hand, suppose you say something that just isn't regurgitating conventional pieties. Suppose you say something that's the least bit unexpected. Or controversial. Suppose you say, 'the biggest international terror operations that are known are run out of Washington,' or suppose you say, 'if the Nuremberg Rules were applied, every post-war American President would've been hanged,' or 'the Bible is the most genocidal book in our entire canon,' or 'education is a system of imposed ignorance."" Well, people will reasonably, quite reasonably, expect to know what you mean. 'Why did you say that?' 'I never heard that before.' If you said that, you'd better have a reason. Better have some evidence. In fact you'd better have a lot of evidence, because that's a pretty startling comment. You can't give evidence if you're stuck with concision. That's the genius of this structural constraint."""

spaceengineers,3dfm82,AerMarcus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:35:33 2015 UTC,"I kind of achieved this in a way that doesn't require multiple servers by creating an unlimited world.  I did go ahead and utilize the starter base since it's nice to have something at the point of origin.  I have friends that like to play as well, so we all had different areas that we jumped to.  I had a building platform about 258,000 meters from the starter base.  There was another building platform that was over 300K in another direction.  All we would do to visit these other areas was to jump in with a ship.  At the time I was using Phoenix's FTL mod.  It made things a lot more fun, because going to check out what someone was building only took a few seconds, instead of having to load into a whole other server.  Since we were all in different areas, the game ran very smoothly as well.  Another fun thing that I tried was flying a ship from one location to another.  While it took a very long time, it was interesting because I encountered various stations in ships that had been submitted for exploration.  This also gave me the idea of having snail mail routes.  What I mean here is basically sending ships on an auto pilot route to the various platforms.   Long story short, just jump to various locations in an infinite world.  Make sure you're hundreds of thousands of meters away from each other and use GPS point to jump to!"

Or simply spawn in the yellow submarine. Either way you have a ship to fly around and get uranium  or  Suck it up and go get it. It's not THAT hard. If you start on ""normal density"" you will have a decent amount of large and small asteroids right there at spawn. close enough to fly in your suit.   And no to make one ship so you can fly to more asteroids to search for a persons inventory of uranium is do not require a lot of materials. Maybe a bit of iron but you find that everywhere.   I personally like to spawn with a small ship that only have enough resource s for one assembler and one arc furnace and maybe the 64 solar panels you need for a solar panel but not the rest of the stuff for it. That is literally all you need to start in this game.   Edit: I get your points. I just am discussing your posibilities : D"

That means that the ""Station voxel support"" is enabled which requires a station to be anchored into a voxel structure like an asteroid. If you place a static grid (station) in space without touching a voxel structure, it will automatically turn into a dynamic grid (~ship). The same will happen when you separate the grid and one of the new parts does not touch the voxel structure anymore.    When you dont want that feature, turn ""Station voxel support"" off.    Check this video for some insight: https://youtu.be/32ZEX391ll8?t=70    Overall though i suggest you learn to adapt and use thrusters on large stations (large dynamic structures meant to move only slowly) in combination with remote controls and GPS to keep a position."

(Note: I'm not a developer myself. There might be a term for this in the world of dev already.) We had a similar workflow when we developed an app in-house.   Tick: New feature.  Tock: Refinement and bug fixes to core code.  That way you know at least 50% of your development time was going towards fixing bugs in the core code, rather than develop new features."
spaceengineers,3dfomj,loofou,2,Thu Jul 16 13:55:04 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you can't apply every development model for software development to game development. The first issue would be that usually only a part of the team is actually coding, the rest are designers or artists of some sort. Bug fixing usually requires more work from coders and less from other team members and they need something to do worthwhile as well. That's why most non-live-feature-implementations like systems building or bug fixing occurs in either the early or the late part of development, so designers have time to write all feature documents or tweak settings and artists either do concepts or finish up the final art. In some more Agile teams designers and artists go on vacation in the latest part of the development process and coders fix the rest of the bugs. After release, they go on their well earned vacation and the designers start working on the design for the next project after they are back from theirs."
spaceengineers,3dfomj,zipperseven,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. I was the lead UI designer on the app we did, so by the time they got to coding, I was only testing some of the builds. I never saw the process that they used to get to the final product, only that I knew that they'd work on features one week then bugs the next week."
spaceengineers,3dfomj,loofou,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with fast production times in mobile or web game development it's a completely different thing, too. Most of the time the design is simple enough to be already done or it's a even a clone, the art requirements are also known nearly from the beginning, so coding can start late and even with rapid prototyping the bug-amount is manageable enough to bugfix every once in a while. But the larger the project goes, the more time-consuming bugfixing can be. In Agile development systems where you work in Sprints, every coder has a set of features to complete in a limited amount of time. Of course he has to make sure to deliver as bug free code as possible and if he is fast he can use the rest of the remaining sprint to fix as many bugs as he can manage in the short amount of time. Still, there are usually more than one coder and as we all know ""too many cooks spoil the soup"". And with larger features that take longer than one sprint, it's even more problematic, because sometimes you can't merge your code with the main branch the rest of the team is working on for a long time, so your code may depend on obsolete classes, etc. All these issues are the important bugs that get fixed in the midst of development. The ones that are found in systems that are suspect to change are usually not, except for game breaking bugs or crashes, because there is either not enough time during one sprint, or the time investment isn't worth the trouble, because designers already changed the system and in two or three sprints you will refactor it anyway.  Still this is currently the best way to produce games or other creative works, as with Sprints you have set deadlines and enforce the divide and conquer principle where you split problems or features into smaller parts and implement each at a time. This way more complex features can get implemented in a shorter amount of time and they are usually pretty bug-free. Also the designers have the possibility to make changes on features during production, because not whole features have to be scrapped, but just smaller parts of them and not as much time is lost.  BTW: Sorry for this wall of text. I hope some people find it interesting and hopefully don't complain any more about seemingly slow or ""inefficient"" development processes in the future. From a gamers point of view it may be annoying to have to deal with bugs, but I think when people actually know a bit about the work done and the processes involved, they will appreciate the many working features more instead of being annoyed at the bugged few ;)"

Wiki on mass blocks   Artificial Mass in Space Engineers employs a particularly interesting concept in physics: The idea that inertial mass and gravitational mass are not necessarily the same thing. Inertial mass describes how difficult it is to move an object. Gravitational mass describes how much gravitational fields affect an object. In real life these quantities are the same.

I'm under the impression that the virtual mass isn't a part of the inertial mass mentioned above.  Meaning you only need to get a 4244 kg mass block moving, not a 54,244 kg one.

spaceengineers,3dfqkk,RaliosDanuith,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:38:02 2015 UTC,Would be so freaking awesome!!!  That's precisely what I'm going to do (if they fix pistons and rotors in MP)
spaceengineers,3dfqkk,RaliosDanuith,4,Thu Jul 16 13:48:31 2015 UTC,Large ship vertical tunnel bore. Dig down a fair way before disassembling it and then build a staircase down the walls of the shaft. At the bottom reassemble. Rinse and repeat. Build horizontal bores for when you want to drill sideways or hand drill to excavate ore veins. I'm also going to use this technique for building my bases.
spaceengineers,3dfqkk,LoneGhostOne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:42:34 2015 UTC,What kind of Large ship vertical tunnel bore do you have in mind? Something to land from space and then start drilling the hole?

You could build guide pillars to carry power to all the levels and use connectors to dock at the horizontal shafts to charge batteries while not moving. Of course I haven't tested it but that's my first idea."
spaceengineers,3dfqkk,Caridor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:14:50 2015 UTC,That's actually quite interesting idea. Haven't build that many drones myself though.
spaceengineers,3dfqkk,SCP106,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:20:17 2015 UTC,It's pretty simple to do. It would just be a remote control with GPS coords at the stops for each level. Maybe make it so it connects to the connectors automatically by putting it as an action when it gets to the coords. You'd definitely need seats and a way to lock down any vehicles/cargo not in containers as the autopilot may not be so gentle going from floor to floor.
spaceengineers,3dfqkk,apologeticCultist,3,Fri Jul 17 03:59:53 2015 UTC,Dig straight down by any haphazard means then use armor blocks to build a four walled elevator shaft upwards.  Use gravity gen and artificial mass to slowly float heavy vehicles up/down.  the grav gen can be adjusted per vehicle.  There might be some scrapes against the wall.
spaceengineers,3dfqkk,apologeticCultist,3,Thu Jul 16 08:43:46 2015 UTC,"Will Jump Drives be functional in a planet's atmosphere?  If so, then this might be the way to go. Simply drop it off, programme a timer to deactivate the drills so it won't get too far away to remote control and let gravity do the work, until you want to warp it back to your refinery or hook it back up to your drop ship.  Alternatively, I think small stations, with large radii could be the solution. This is just a proof of concept, nothing more but you can see how it would work. Using the rotor and only 2 pistons, you could mine out 2010.62m2 which is fairly good for it's cost. However, if you wanted to use 4 pistons (2 across, 2 down), then your mining potential becomes 20357.52m2 .  In theory, such a device could be vehicle mounted as well."
spaceengineers,3dfqkk,WasabiBomb,2,Thu Jul 16 11:20:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I would use several minig ships. Each one would be a simple fully charged battery or two with a drill, large container and connector attached. These devices would be able to mine for several thousand meters before running out of power. Once an ingame day has passed (4 hours), I shall use another small ship to fly into these deep tunnels and ferry resources to the surface containers nearby. I will hopefully be able to construct several mining devices and one or two carry-drones.   Either that or several of my HPM's ('Heavy Precision Missiles'). These use the same system as nukes but include high powered gravity drives and lots of rocks. When it hits, the explosives detonate, creating a huge hole. Then the Grav-gens throw the rock forward destroying anything left, then a spherical G-G activates and makes the rockes tear through the chunk of slag that was a ship. I have a couple of mining variants of these. My mot used are:  Gustav the Explodinator  and  Ivan the Station Crusher  GtE is a good miner, while ItSC has more rocks, less explosives. They both destroy around 5-10 layers of heavy armour but are terribly expensive and ridiculously heavy.  TL;DR: Mining drones or huge 'HPM's'"

spaceengineers,3dffd9,Slugga17,4,Thu Jul 16 18:57:09 2015 UTC,How does geostationary orbit even work.. I mean there wont even be any orbital mechanics with the game right? As in you can just fly straight up from the planet until you are not affected by its gravity like any kind of gravity work in the game now?
spaceengineers,3dffd9,fanzypantz,3,Wed Jul 15 21:54:26 2015 UTC,"I dont think geostationary orbit would work, however if you docked a ship to a connecter that was tied to the ground it would seem that that'd work."
spaceengineers,3dffd9,TheSoftestTaco,2,Wed Jul 15 21:59:36 2015 UTC,Geostationary won't work because the planets don't rotate. But there are orbital mechanics. Gravity tappers off from the planets the farther you are from it and pulls you toward the center. That's all you need for simple orbital mechanics. All you need to do is to go the right speed pointed at the correct vector and you'll orbit. What we don't have information on is if there will be anyway of accessing the correct telemetry data to make orbiting easier and less hand calculations.
spaceengineers,3dffd9,daOyster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:21:28 2015 UTC,You can stabilize it by having downward thrust equal the force of gravity. Would consume a lot of power though
spaceengineers,3dffd9,Eth0s_1,0,Wed Jul 15 22:20:05 2015 UTC,"I need you to define your version of orbital mechanics.    Mine include gravity effecting everything in a sphere that mimics that of reality(the decrease in gravity isn't linear). At that point you just need to be able to apply acceleration perpendicular to gravity, and viola you have orbital mechanics at play.   To much velocity? You leave the planet.  Not enough? You crash land.  Just right? Orbit! YaY!  *Disclaimer: the mechanics of orbits were highly simplified to make a point."
spaceengineers,3dffd9,Ishakaru,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"well an orbit would mean that you go around it in circles and does these planets even rotate? Because if they don't rotate and ships would orbit around the planet there would be no geostationary orbits because a geostationary orbit means you orbit the body as slow relative to a point on the earth as it rotates, meaning you can see the same place of the body at all times.   I was just asking how geostationary orbits would work when the game would not have orbits at all. In real life to get off the planet you usually spend most of your fuel burning horizontal not vertical to speed up to insane speeds. If they added KSP mechanics to the game, A LOT of ship designs would never ever work and you would need massive rockets. I mean 104m/s is nothing against the 7.8km/s you need to go in low earth orbit.   edit: changed my phrasing"
spaceengineers,3dffd9,fanzypantz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:45:51 2015 UTC,The only geo-stationary type of mechanic so far it seems is by being out of the SOI of a planet but not moving. Not sure on the range of planet gravity so that will determine if it will be similar or not.
spaceengineers,3dffd9,daOyster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"Well. Orbit is actually a lot easier than that. Once you're above the atmosphere, any additional delta V just results in a higher orbit. There isn't an ""orbit sweet spot"" where you have to go exactly this speed or you escape, or, crash. If you don't care about a symmetrical orbit, and you just want to be ""up there"", it's dead simple. Keep your periapsis out of the soup, and apoapsis below escape. Tada! You're in orbit."
spaceengineers,3dffd9,Cronyx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"I love how you say there's no sweet spot, then describe the sweet spot.  In KSP terms, orbits are very very easy to manage because you have the tools to manage them. Even the basic ""This is where you'll go"" makes them easier. Once you get out of the atmosphere you can maintain a stable orbit. You can adjust the speed of your orbit by making it larger or smaller.   There are problems in SE that make this difficult. (Assuming 0 mods for all points)  1)The speed cap requires a minimum distance from the planet. Depending on the gravity, and the max distance that gravity will have an effect may make orbits impossible.    2)There are 0 tools in game... currently anyway, they may add some with planets, but we have to assume they won't. There aren't even any direct ways of determining gravity at a specific point. Heck we can't even get the ships velocity directly(in the PB).  Between those 2 points. Orbits are anything but easy, and may be impossible. However, to consolidate with my previous post. Even if orbits are impossible, that doesn't mean there isn't orbital mechanics at play."
spaceengineers,3dffd9,Ishakaru,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"There are 0 tools in game   This is actually false on a fundamental level. We have all the tools necessary because we have programming blocks, sensors, and a fairly robust scripting language orders of magnitude more complex and capable than that on the Apollo 11."
spaceengineers,3dffd9,Cronyx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"I guess I was a little dramatic.   Talking in PB terms only. Here are the steps to measure gravity:  1) modify the long distance targeting script from the official forums. Or do closest point on two lines algorithm.  2)write a script to determine change in velocity.  3)Hoping that inertial dampeners will eliminate all velocity perpendicular to the pull of gravity. Use script in (2). Once you get the same vector 3 times in a row. Turn off ID, take 2 velocity/position measurements. These are used latter to determine the gravity. All the while, hope that you can manage this before crashing or reaching the speed cap.  repeat all of (3) at a different location.  Now using all this, we can determine center point of the planet, and gravitational pull at the center(the important point).   4)Now we land, take a distance from center measurement. Add 5k(?) we'll say this is the closest orbit we can make.   5)Make yet another script that calculates the orbit ap/pera and such.  Now, only 4 and 5 need to be done if we can get 2 things that are already in the hud: Gravitational direction and force.  Heck, you can wing it just 5.   Use of these tools takes 3-5 min, maybe longer,  per planet, not counting the hours needed to make the setup scripts in the first place. Not to mention the setup is highly prone to error: resulting in crash, or ship floating off into space.  Opposed to a simple script that could be used with the right access that requires 0 setup.  TL;DR: We have to make all tools to determine that which is already default in the hud. General audience will not be able to do this due to the complexity of getting everything right. With the right data, we could make a script that allows anyone to orbit any planet with a simple button."

It's really, really easy to be in some kind of stable ""orbit"" if you aren't going for something fancy like Lagrange, circular, or geosynchronous."

And every now and again fly up with a resupply ship. The hardest part in my mind, would be setting it up to go slow enough to not outpace the welders. And stop if it runs out of supplies. Maybe a simple sensor at the top, that turns it off it no more blocks exist above it."

spaceengineers,3dfw7g,Darleviath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:42:56 2015 UTC,I thought you could only jump with the main pilot seat?
spaceengineers,3dfw7g,Crowforge,5,Thu Jul 16 01:36:11 2015 UTC,"A vessel with jump drives will drag anything attached via connectors or landing gear along with it when jumping. You could easily set a waypoint inside a gravity well, grab a ship, jump in, release, and jump away. You'd need to set up hotkeys or a timer block to switch two banks of jump drives on and off, and make sure you have at least 10 seconds of fall time while waiting for the second drive to spool up, but there's no reason it wouldn't be possible."
spaceengineers,3dfw7g,JohnoTheFoolish,2,Thu Jul 16 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"Which is why they should really bring in Mass calculations with how much energy is needed to jump.  Honestly, if the drive is spun up for your ship and you attach to something 3 times bigger, it should take more time for more energy to be stored in the FTL drive.   Though that would be very funny dropping a huge enemy carrier into a planet....."
spaceengineers,3dfw7g,bigrigross,5,Thu Jul 16 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"However, any captain worth his salt will have his own drives charged and ready to spool up in such an event."
spaceengineers,3dfw7g,SaiHottari,2,Thu Jul 16 08:28:32 2015 UTC,"I think he talk about the delay between the activation of the jump drive and the effective jump. It's currently 10 second, but it the same you have only a jump drive, a reactor and a controle siege than a Full big ship with 1500 block.  IMO, the delay between the activation and the jump should be scalled by the total mass of the stuff you want to move."
spaceengineers,3dfw7g,S3blapin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:42:00 2015 UTC,"Mass does factor into the distance. I built a small test ship and jumped it 4000km in one go. I found a bunch of exploration ships nearby and grabbed them. My 4000km initial jump was reduced to 900km or so with the extra mass. Each subsequent jump, I found and added more ships so my last jump to get home was about 60km (total mass was about 40 000 tons).  Jumping enemy ships into planets may not be that practical in reality, especially with the minimum size imposed with the jump drive block and large ship grid. You have to build for speed/survivability to avoid or outlast enemy weapons, and still mange to be moving slow enough for landing gear to engage."
spaceengineers,3dfw7g,JohnoTheFoolish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:15:14 2015 UTC,Also there is the 2km safe distance from any thing so you'd need a planet with a strong gravity field and an enemy ship weak enough to fall into the gravity well

spaceengineers,3ddj3b,Ragejay,2,Wed Jul 15 13:33:01 2015 UTC,Guided missiles can be done right now. You have to engineer them yourself using warheads and other blocks. You can also manually designate targets for turrets.

Synchronised turrets.  Having this would also make having the turrets all pointing in the same direction much easier, and that just makes my OCD happy, okay."

spaceengineers,3dfwvd,deeredman1991,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:20:09 2015 UTC,Hmm. Well I'm not 100% sure it wants a list of all your rotors. I would say it probably wants the parent object of a rotor which would have a list of children.   Just try passing the parent object through it and see what happens. (i.e. a single element in your list)  If that doesn't work try casting the parent object as a list.  If that doesn't work look up to see if the rotor object has a list of children and try passing that through it.  If none of the above works; try candy and a van. lol
spaceengineers,3dfwvd,deeredman1991,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:47:37 2015 UTC,So upon examining it further. I don't even know how this function is supposed to work. It returns void which doesn't make any sense. If you are trying to get the children of a parent object you would THINK it would return a list and/or array of children but no it doesn't.   Maybe this isn't the function you are looking for?
spaceengineers,3dfwvd,descenterace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:54:39 2015 UTC,"It seems that the scripting API often provides functions where the caller is expected to create the list into which things will be added, ie. instead of returning a list the function takes a list as a parameter and adds stuff to it.  Looks a bit like a C/C++ idiom ('caller allocates memory') which tends not to pop up much in managed code since memory allocation is basically free when using a copy-collector. Although, it may be more efficient to have multiple functions add to the same list than to concatenate multiple lists for cases when you're collecting several sets.  That function does appear to be nonsense though, at least in the version of the source I'm currently looking at. It takes a list of entities and an optional predicate (default: e => true) and just re-appends any matching entities in that list to the end of the list. Maybe a bug?"
spaceengineers,3dfwvd,creepig,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:57:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the replies. I wouldn't necessarily have to feed a list of <IMyMotorStator> into the function as I also have a list of <IMyTerminalBlock> containing all blocks (the rotors list is derived from it anyway). Though both of your comments seems to suggest the function is bollocks anyway.
spaceengineers,3dfwvd,descenterace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:23:23 2015 UTC,"As a C++ programmer:  Yeah, definitely C-style return, which is just weird.  This is C#, and as you mentioned, the managed code school of thought doesn't use this.  I don't know why you wouldn't just define your return type as List<IMyEntity> if you're not passing error codes through the return.  Keen, wtf r u doin."
spaceengineers,3dfwvd,descenterace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:20:56 2015 UTC,"It makes a little bit of sense if you're expecting to collect blocks from several separate functions, eg.  var blocks = new List<something>(); GetBlocksSomehow(blocks); GetBlocksAnotherWay(blocks); GetMoreBlocks(blocks);   But then I'd expect to be passing an ICollection so I can substitute a HashSet if I don't want duplicates.  Some bits of the API seem really silly and clunky. While that's fine for internal stuff, public APIs tend to be immutable and so should be Done Right(TM) the first time, or versioned sensibly."
spaceengineers,3dfwvd,descenterace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could try approaching the problem from the other side, using the Parent properties or GetTopMostParent? I'm not entirely sure which hierarchy is being referred to by these properties though. Hopefully it's one which is of use to you."
spaceengineers,3dfwvd,descenterace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:01:47 2015 UTC,"This would probably be a better option as it would allow me to add other IMyTerminalBlocks to the connected rotors and then detect which rotors are which by looking at the parent(s) of the IMyTerminalBlock. I shall have a play.     Whilst I'm here, and this is probably somewhat related, is it possible to get a given block's type from its properties or from some other value or function? I'm assuming so, but couldn't figure out how. I ask as my project pulls all tagged blocks into a list of IMyTerminalBlock called blocks, and then that list is iterated through to check the block type and cast it into a suitable IMyBlockType list. At present, I'm checking the type by running ""blocks[i].ToString()"", which returns ""IMyBlockType {longblockIDhere}"", getting the front portion of that string, and then doing a string comparison to get the type. It works but feels somewhat like a filthy, cheaty, don't know C#y kind of solution.   Is there a better way? I searched for a solution but every example I could find used GTS.GetBlocksOfType<IMyBlockType> and cast that into a list of <IMyBlockType> rather than starting off with a list of IMyTerminalBlock and going from there. I had assumed there would be something like ""blocks[i].GetType"" available but I haven't been able to find anything.     Also also, the GetProperties method seems to be the same as the GetChildren one (it looks syntactically identical) so is it similarly bollocks?"
spaceengineers,3dfwvd,descenterace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:26 2015 UTC,"GetProperties looks OK. It appears to populate the list from an internal structure. GetChildren just seems to be implemented incorrectly. Also note that the code I'm looking at is my own copy of it which hasn't been updated in a while so it's probably v1.086 or something.  You can use the 'as' and 'is' keywords to check types, eg.  if(block is IMyRefinery) ...   or  var refinery = block as IMyRefinery if(refinery != null) ...   If you have a collection which you know contains only eg. IMyRefinery, you can use:  System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList(System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast<IMyRefinery>(blocks))   to get a list of that type. Hopefully they'll do something about the clunky LINQ extension method syntax at some stage.  If you just want to find the block 'definition ID':  block.BlockDefinition.ToString()   Unfortunately the property itself is of a type which is banned in scripts IIRC, so you can't read TypeId and SubTypeId off it directly, but you can still convert it to a string and get something fairly useful. It will look something like 'MyObjectBuilder_<typeId>/<subtypeId>', which lets you distinguish between eg. different types of Refinery.  (Guess which types of blocks my scripts deal with almost exclusively...)"
spaceengineers,3de2n5,HeavenlyUser,22,Wed Jul 15 15:28:50 2015 UTC,"Those little squares aren't conveyor ports (they're plug-in sites for upgrade modules), and the Conveyor Sorter you've got there doesn't have a port on the side anyway.

spaceengineers,3de2n5,Chaemera,7,Wed Jul 15 15:31:41 2015 UTC,oh... lol... That explains that then. I was confused why there would be so many conveyer ports on the refiners and assemblers but I guess the answer is there aren't. Thanks. I just shifted the block and it worked. xD

Have a force put on the grav drives in the opposite direction to the mass blocks force they are pushing and buff large ship thrusters considerably instead.  This is a thruster that is far easier to armour, far cheaper (multiple orders of magnitude), requires no exhaust space, no external ship area and a few orders of magnitude less volume.   They are completely broken overpowered and remove from the game rather than add to it.  It is broken. Large ship thrusters are also broken because they put out puny amounts of thrust.

Kinetic torpedo launchers (my idea here would not break these it would just add recoil).   How about fully autonomous miners . On the forums there is an amazing competition for these currently called miner Olympics.    That argument has no basis.  There is zero advantage to building a ship with more than a few thrusters in each direction because grav drives are just so much better in every way  You ever tried to do damage to a gravity driven spacebox in a small ship? At least thrusters give some weakspot.  Get a friend and a good gravity spacebox with heavy armour  and 10 or more turrets against your best fighter design. You will barley scratch his paint. At least when he has engines you can disable them.

That is a challenge that I managed to crack out to a reasonable degree almost a year ago in a an hour or two. And unless it's a pac-man drone anything other than straight miner damages itself.  My point is that much of the mechanisms you can actually build in this game rely on concepts or blocks that are horribly broken right now. Gravity drives are simply the only stable engineering and just like jump drives unless they are severely gimped they will be prone to abuse and we saw how the gimping went over with the jump drives."
spaceengineers,3denvn,Pure_Diamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"No it does not. How about having no pistons and rotating the whole miner. Use welder chains through the whole craft. Engineer around these game limitations.  You can still play around with designs against NPC ships. Design a light fighter with good forward acceleration like 25 or above.  No it does not use merge blocks and large ship grids. No rotors needed.  You have not checked on the forums at all. These things use scripting and return home when full to dock tranfer cargo and go back, carve out asteroids in an incredibly efficient pattern mining shafts straight through right next to each other fully autonomously. You have not done a tenth of that with 5 sensors 4 gyros and thrust override.   There is plenty of engineering in the game. You just need to engineer around its limitations."

I started making this by deciding (and kindof following the engineering design process) what i wanted the ship to do: - weld things with two welders - store components in a container - supply the welders with any size components from the container - have a small form-factor - have more power generation than needed - have a connector for easy resource transfer  Then when i actually went to build it i placed down the largest and most difficult to manage part first, which was the large-sized conveyor, after that i placed the curved conveyor tubes, the cargo container, and the two welders, then the cockpit, the reactors, thrusters, gyroscopes etc...  Later this underwent ""revisions"" where i decided i wanted it to do more as the game updated: - antenna so i could find it - remote control so it cant get lost - cameras for remote control - battery for emergency power storage"

spaceengineers,3ddgmj,ranak3,3,Wed Jul 15 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"Here's the sort of thing I usually build:   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420332835 (Basic hull for builders and demolishers) http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413872435 (My first mining ship, since improved upon but I don't seem to have uploaded the refinement yet)   I don't play multiplayer so weapons and defences don't tend to appear in my designs. The only reason that miner has a decent shell is because I tend to bump into things a lot :P  My recommendation would be to focus on the ship's intended purpose and hyperoptimise it for that, then test it a lot:   That miner's rear cargo pods tended to get smashed up in tight places so I started putting ablative armour strips along them. It got two extra drills because filling the containers took too long. My pre-oxygen utility hull only had two containers which was really too small, so the new one has four. It's also slightly flatter so it can fit through 1-large-block-wide spaces for welding. I've also uploaded a small-large-ship mining support vessel, which has since received a lot of use and some further tweaks (such as an extra solar panel). That one's likely to get canned though because the cargo capacity simply isn't sufficient... the replacement carries over 2 million litres of ore (1x capacity) and has a jump drive.   I tend to design these things in Creative and then blueprint them over to Survival. This might be considered 'cheating', but otherwise I'd probably go insane :P"

spaceengineers,3ddgmj,vrekais,3,Thu Jul 16 11:19:52 2015 UTC,"I will typically build the ship I have an idea of in my head. Name it ""scooty puff Jr. Mk I"" or something to designate that it's a prototype.  Then use it for a little bit.   After you get a feel for what you like/dislike about it, build it again, and make subtle changes. I tend to pick one thing and focus on it, such as ""I'm going to extend the body by one block front to back, and see what options that gives me for my thrusters."" Name this Mk II.  Repeat whenever you feel like it, making blueprints along the way. If you screw something up, just trash it and reload the last model's blueprint.  By the time you get to your third or fourth iteration, you will more than likely perfect the design.  I've been playing this game for a long time, and I still use this process for small ships I design. It took hundreds of hours of experience for me to be able to do it quickly, but that's what creative can circumvent.  Also, I recommend browsing the workshop and downloading blueprints for one or two small ships you like. Then load them in game and construct them. You will inevitably discover some design options, as well as someone else's idea of a complete ship. Use what you learned in your next remake.  If you're on multiplayer, build a ship WITH someone else, take turns making design choices. Some of the best looking ships I've made are just terrible to pilot. Some of the bare bones ones are the best.  You will get a feel for it after some time.  I would not recommend repeating the same design process you've used for all these other models. Try something different over and over."
spaceengineers,3ddgmj,kirby824,3,Wed Jul 15 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"My advice to making ships look good is to build your conveyor system and your components first. Your reactors, your conveyors, your guns, your basic thruster requirements and then build around that.  Once you've coated the thing in armour, you can smooth it down using sloped blocks and remove armour that doesn't need to be there.  Then, if it still looks too boxy, you can add things to the outside of it. Either additional thrusters and weapons or simply Greebles.  It's the method I used to create this (still heavy work in progress, no colour on it yet, need to put in more work with 2x1 slopes and it needs a name, but you get the idea) http://imgur.com/a/WlKWi"
spaceengineers,3ddgmj,Caridor,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"I encountered this problem a couple of times. To solve it, I tried designing the ship around the main conveyor system and then taking cues from nature.  I don't have an imgur link for you (at work) but from the back of the ship I used two small ejectors linking to an oxygen generator, then a medium cargo pod, then a conveyor block, which then connects to the fighter cockpit with the sides of the conveyor block (small conveyors) branching off to weapons and lots of small reactors).  The finished ship looks like a small bird in mid-dive.  Also, if possible, use colour more effectively to break up the sections of the ship, thereby giving the eye better clues as to where the fuselage and wings are."
spaceengineers,3ddgmj,TheHoneyThief,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:53:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever made a ship that looks decent on the first build. Instead, I've kept a rough idea in my mind of what primary functions I'm going to build it to have, then made something gross and unappealing. After that, I generally try to make it either more attractive or more functional by moving around components or shaving off excess material. When I've made improvements that I'm comfortable with, I move on to another project, then come back later and repeat the process. It took me over a month (albeit not a whole lot of playing time) and about a dozen iterations before I was happy with the first ship I made in this manner, and it's just a little 15 tonne fighter. I have a better idea of what to do on the first time around now, but it still takes me a lot of time to build ships that I like."
spaceengineers,3dcupy,WoodToTheMetal,18,Wed Jul 15 07:22:41 2015 UTC,"Its things like this that made me start adding remote control blocks and antennas to everything.  It takes seconds to assume control and stop a rogue ship.  As for the reason this happened, you were travelling over the max speed, so I'm assuming you were using a speed mod.  Of course, the base game can't handle keep track of everything over that base speed, so most likely it was a desynch.  The new netcode can't be too far off, though, which may fix issues like this when there isn't a speed mod involved."

spaceengineers,3deav2,S3raphi,2,Wed Jul 15 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Remote calls are a security risk. The script runs on the game server. Under which user account is it running, on whose network?

spaceengineers,3deav2,descenterace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:48:36 2015 UTC,"Not that I've seen.  Adding in HTTP should be as easy as exposing the built in C# HTTP object to the ModAPI, but will likely involve a bit of a back and forth with Keen (with good reason re security).  Once HTTP is enabled it's trivial to get database functionality through something like CouchDB or a RESTful service."
spaceengineers,3deav2,Purple_Antwerp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:39:13 2015 UTC,"Allowing external requests from the script environment is a huge security hole. I do not think there is any way they will permit this.  [edit] More specifically, there is no way they can allow general HTTP, etc calls from scripts without opening up large holes. It might be feasible to provide a monitoring module as part of the script API. This module would be capable of a very restricted set of calls to a statically-configured webservice or database. It would expose a set of void methods to the script which would be fire-and-forget, ie. they never wait on the underlying network request to complete, and the script would be unable to request any information from the remote service.  By 'statically-configured' I mean the person running the game server would need to set it in game options, or in a file somewhere."

spaceengineers,3dcpya,-KR-,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:50:45 2015 UTC,I can't say about planets coming in future updates but this orbit was ellipsoidal .
spaceengineers,3dcpya,c_for,2,Wed Jul 15 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look ellipsoidal to me. When you have a constant force acting on an object towards a point, you will get a flower pedal shape of an orbit, with number of petals dependent on the objects vector and position. This is what the spherical gravity generator does. It doesn't create elliptical orbits.  In one preview video of planets I saw, the force of gravity was changing as he got closer, by what appeared to be an exponential rate. If that force is related to the inverse of distance squared, you would get real elliptical orbits around planets."

spaceengineers,3dcg98,Ishakaru,2,Wed Jul 15 11:04:30 2015 UTC,"No that's not. Occlusion culling is determining what is being hidden by other geometry.

spaceengineers,3dcg98,Ishakaru,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:51:55 2015 UTC,"Forget the term, but the graphics API (DX in this case) will cull all triangles that are not facing the camera.

This would be cool and I think it will be a thing, maybe with upgrade modules needing to be researched rather than available from the start, you could fit an upgrade slow on the thrusters but I think I'd prefer them to need to need fuel and you could produce the effects with blocks like ""Fuel Injector"" or ""Thrust Efficiency Computer"" and the like which would need to be researched.  Fuel is something I really want, I know we have Reactors than need uranium but the thrusters look like rockets and not like Ion Drives... give us some hydro-carbons to mine maybe?"

spaceengineers,3d9o9l,NativeInterface,34,Wed Jul 15 23:14:02 2015 UTC,I actually really like that you can access the whole ship via door.

spaceengineers,3d9o9l,NativeInterface,18,Tue Jul 14 18:02:33 2015 UTC,Sounds fine to me. I think modern society has proved that a lot can be done on small screens. Also wouldn't surprise me if similar things has been done in sci-fi.

spaceengineers,3d9o9l,MonsterBlash,10,Tue Jul 14 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"You can still press the wrong button on a bigger screen. Proper UI ergonomics can work on smaller screens too. Also, the control panel for the reactor doesn't have to be complicated, if the technology is advanced enough.    Think about it. How many levers/button/commands do you use to start your engine, and regulate it? There are PLENTY of parameters, and sure, if the engine was experimental, then you'd want to tune lots of parameters, but once it's common enough, there's an on, and off, and a throttle.    The same is happening for the reactor, it's a Mr.Fusion. You already are using a nanobot torch thing which can build a whole reactor by pulsing a jet on a frame, don't tell me that the controls are going to be more complicated than the construction mechanics. XD"
spaceengineers,3d9o9l,Arudinne,3,Tue Jul 14 18:49:38 2015 UTC,True. I'm just saying when the controls are smaller and bunched together its easier to hit the wrong button.  I think it also matters how/where things are processed. IE: Does the control panel have its own CPU/RAM and send/recieve commands from the main computer or is merely a dumb terminal? Granted inside a game this is less of a concern.  I remember on Stargate Atlantis there was an episode where two of the characters got trapped in a transporter (if you haven't seen the show its akin to a turbo lift) and they couldn't use their tablets to access the base systems because they didn't have enough RAM.
spaceengineers,3d9o9l,UsernameHasBeenLost,2,Tue Jul 14 18:54:34 2015 UTC,It could have a hologram projection that expands the size of the screen when you open the console.

Just say ""I'd prefer if it would do X, because I think it would make the game more fun, by providing difference Y to the gameplay"".

spaceengineers,3d9o9l,solsys,5,Tue Jul 14 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"To me it's not about size, but simple ergonomics.  Here's an exercise:   Perform some non-trivial task on your phone.  Pay attention to how close the screen is to your face and the angle that you hold it at.  Get up and go to the nearest door.  Put your phone next to the door knob, flat against the door's surface.  Now try the same task.   A door knob's height is fine for a person of average height to operate, but it's a fairly simple maneuver.  Even light switches and themostats are higher up on the wall because they require finer control.    If we're going for the idea that every door panel is a computer terminal, then they should be at or slightly below eye level...   I think the middle ground is to just make the entire door a clickable surface to open/close, then move the control panel up to near eye-level for more complex tasks (Locking, permissions, etc.). Would make the most common action for the door easy, and also add a reason to have a LAN terminal on every entrance."
spaceengineers,3d9o9l,Corruptmagician,2,Tue Jul 14 21:46:46 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like about having the entire door clickable is that you would have a giant yellow square in your face when walking through the door, some door mods do this and it get's irritating."

spaceengineers,3d9o9l,Arq_Angel,6,Tue Jul 14 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  I was thinking the upgrade mechanic could lead to a bunch of new possibilities regarding blocks having multiple functions.  The upgrade tool could be like a soldering iron that opens up several different upgrade paths, and once a path is chosen the player can add the upgrade at the expense of more resources.  EDIT: Actually starting off with no panel or button is a good idea for most blocks, it would make for a more secure system, as it would be harder to hack something from the outside of a ship."

Triggering a jump from one block, with both drives turned on consumed the charge from both, and I ended up 4000km away."

The jump drive system on the red ship allows someone to travel 1 AU in roughly 302 days.

spaceengineers,3deerg,marlan_,6,Wed Jul 15 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, and where everyone else is coming from.  Being a jump drive, it's instantaneous, but I got to thinking how a mod for what you're wanting would be possible.  The way the game works, a Jump drive makes the most sense due to the fact that the game just has a hard time calculating physics at high speeds (it can't keep up).  Perhaps there's a way to do this though, that could keep the game stable, and not force it to do any wacky stuff.  When engaging a ""Warp drive"" perhaps the game could jump the ship to an animated skybox, that looks like you're moving through space at a high rate of speed.  Perhaps even something like you see from Stargate Universe.  Here's a reference  Depending on the distance, the length of time in this separate skybox would be different.  Power consumption would be higher, and a different sound could perhaps be heard while it's there.  In reality, you ship would not actually be moving, which means you could safely walk around the ship without multiplayer physics issues.  At the same time you'd have a beautiful view outside the windows.  When it comes time for the ""Warp Travel"" or ""Faster than light"" travel to come to and end, a script could possibly be made to alert people to take a seat (necessary for the actual jump feature). What the game would be doing here is jumping the ship from the ""FTL Box"" to the actual pre programmed destination.  Your idea is neat, and perhaps there's a way to do it, but I do also like having the jump drive by itself!"

There is nothing like seeing 20 missiles flying at you while your about to jump and jumping at the right time.  And honestly, I am so wanting to recreate the Battlestar Galactica scene where it jumps into the atmosphere of new caprica and jumps out.

I think this is correct when you're pasting objects — that it pivots around the block your crosshairs were pointed at when you took the blueprint.  But for projections, the ""center"" is the grid pivot. In the info tab, there's an option to see the grid pivot, and you can probably see it if it's not embedded deep in your ship.  When you start a new ship (small or large), I think the grid pivot is right at the base of the landing gear.  It's also possible to move the grid pivot. Keen has something to help with that. I don't think there's an 'official' version for large blocks, but it's just a handful of blocks anyway, so it's easy to make your own."

spaceengineers,3d9b4b,Ralph-King-Griffin,3,Tue Jul 14 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"i think its just large numbers of complex models. gyroscopes are the worst culprits, seeing as you tend to need a lot of them and they have that whole sphere thing going on. i suggest downloading encased gyroscopes/other mods that would allow for simpler models with the same effectiveness."
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,Ralph-King-Griffin,3,Tue Jul 14 18:09:39 2015 UTC,Confirming gyroscopes tank my pc pretty hard. More so than most. Which is a pain because I'm doing a big ish vanilla build meaning I can't even use Keens gyro booster thingy. Extensive piping can also do it as can excessive amounts of airtight hangar doors.  Basically op there's shagall you can do to avoid it outside of being as economic with comlex models as possible until they do a performance pass.
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,nogrim2,2,Tue Jul 14 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"The game is clearly CPU limited on my system, I've read that the game does not use multicores yet, which matches what I'm seeing.    Logic suggests that complex models would add to the strain of the GPU, but my GPU is barely doing anything, averaging 30% when playing.  Do complex models really add to the CPU workload.  That would probably explain my problems as my ship has a room with about 100 gyros.    Can you may a gravity gyroscope in the same manner as a gravity drive?"
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,Avengerr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:39:46 2015 UTC,The physics are handled by the CPU. You can hit the GPU pretty hard with enough blocks. I've made some fairly large stations which can kill my FPS while my Sim Speed is at 1.00 since the blocks on stations are usually static (depending on game settings now).
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,nogrim2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:59:02 2015 UTC,Yeah iv done so as well a couple of times and it takes a considerable amount of blocks to tank the gpu.  The build I'm working on shouldn't tank my system as much as it does but  It does  I noticed the SIM speed start tanking when I made it airtight with hangar doors and when I added gyroscopes.
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,Avengerr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't believe so,  keen have a block though that sort-of addresses this though.  It's a gyro booster thingy you can attach 4 gyroscopes to and it amplifies their effect,   which is great but  It's not In the vanilla game.   (⊙________⊙)"
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,nogrim2,2,Tue Jul 14 19:15:36 2015 UTC,same issue. i recently built a decent sized ship i was planning to use for a 4 player survival game but for some reason when it was about 75% done on the interior my performance went from great to slide show.   no idea what caused it i was going through adjusting colors on the lights i had already placed and then it just shit the bed and went in to slide show mode.   i think its time they do a performance pass i'm starting to get sick of making a new world every week because the old ones sims speed is so fucked up
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,Avengerr,3,Tue Jul 14 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"I've noticed issues with lighting in the past, though it may have changed with the DX11 update.  I had a hangar/workshop area where I could park large ships - it was a cavern in an asteroid. I had landing lights on the flight deck (interior lights) which were fine, and I had 3 spotlights on the ceiling. Whenever I turned on those spotlights, my game would drop 20fps almost instantly."
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,lowrads,2,Tue Jul 14 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"yeah spot lights were the first thing i removed, no change. it seems once your sim speed decides to shit the bed nothing will fix it.  sad part is i have copy pasted the ships out before and then they are fine when i put them in to a new world, so what ever is causing this its not just the physical make up of a ship that is responsible  for reference the ship isnt much larger than the red ship"
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,Khourieat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"Other than that, I've noticed weird issues with sim speed if there are too many floating objects.  I have a huge mining ship that is sort of a core-driller. It can dig cylindrical tunnels, and despite my best efforts a lot of time some ores don't get picked up. At the time as well, I'd turn on a conveyor system that basically ""shit out"" stone (and only stone) from the rear connector, sending it off into space where I thought it'd disappear eventually.  Turns out, either it never disappears or it takes a VERY long time. I noticed after a while that all my movements were severely delayed, and the walk sound didn't match up with the animations. So I downloaded SEToolbox and looked at my save file, and I had a huge, huge number of ""floating objects,"" mostly stone, present in my space.  After deleting all the stray ores (and other random bits like Blast Doors from military ships that apparently break because rotors, tools from when I died, etc) and re-saving, my game was back to normal."
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,nogrim2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:46:58 2015 UTC,i usually end up building a gravity funnel some where near the entrance when i do those and collect all the stone for grav weapon ammo. i had thought it might be due to this but i have not done any mining in that save game that i can recall
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,Caridor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"I never really bothered with gravity weapons because I don't play PvP. I tend to make more daring combat and capture NPC ships, and either melt them down for resources or incorporate them into my base.  In my old base before the oxygen update (I haven't played since because I had to restart in order to utilize Oxygen) I had a mobile defence platform made out of a Solar Sail. It's attached to a moon and can be detached and manoeuvred for defensive combat - though it's kinda pointless since I don't play PvP, but it looks cool.  In regards to stone I do keep some for building purposes, but the sheer amount of it I get while mining is useless to me, so I thought dumping it into space would be sufficient. Guess I was wrong, and now I have no way to dispose of it other than deleting it with SEToolbox."
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,Callous1970,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:17 2015 UTC,I would suggest putting in a switch for the lights so they are disabled when not in use.    Always on sensors can also be a problem.

spaceengineers,3d9b4b,CHARGER007,2,Tue Jul 14 18:09:53 2015 UTC,"Could this be due to using conveyor tubes?  The game tries to keep track of the reflections for each of those glass sides, and when you have tons of tubes running it can add to your lag."
spaceengineers,3d9b4b,CHARGER007,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:54:46 2015 UTC,I'll do some testing. That would make sense. Another possibility could be due to the number of conveyor to conveyor tube connections. Stranger things have happened.

spaceengineers,3d99eg,LoneGhostOne,2,Tue Jul 14 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"modern naval ships are made of metal, yet they can catch on fire. Metal is capable of catching fire as long as there is enough oxygen around."
spaceengineers,3d99eg,RA2lover,5,Tue Jul 14 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"Modern naval ships catch fire when the combustible materials inside burn IE fuel, oil, munitions, cloths, bunks their metal doesnt burn at any temperature that wouldnt have caused other major issues. in SE the only combustibles are magnesium and ammo."
spaceengineers,3d99eg,LoneGhostOne,3,Tue Jul 14 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I like to think that all blocks in SE have a large number of cords and wires in them. I mean, how else is power transferred throughout the ship? Magic? And so, when this ""wires"" are damaged, they could set off an electrical fire. Also steel, silicon, and uranium can catch fire. They act as catalysts for flames to feed off of oxygen"
spaceengineers,3d99eg,RA2lover,4,Tue Jul 14 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"they still dont burn enough to sustain a fire, also if that fire was lit by a hit landing inside then the are in that room would get vented and there'd be no problem.  On another note: it'd be neat if interior blocks had some kind of advantage, because then those could be made of of something like drywall, or plastics, things that burn nicely :)"
spaceengineers,3d99eg,LoneGhostOne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"then again, as far as we are concerned, the atmosphere on ships is pure oxygen.  Pure oxygen atmospheres make things you wouldn't think as flammable flammable."

I know you already need to setup relay stations for your communications. Adding this for GPS functionality gives you something to do work for. And if playing multiplayer, your navigational beacons become a target for the enemy.   That said, I think the limits on communication is kind of contrived. I mean, if I'm pumping 200kW into an antenna, that should have a MUCH wider range than 50km.   And for the enemy target bit... I think it may fall into ""The Rust Effect"" category of ""things that someone will just wait until you are offline to attack.""  Back to the original point, I wonder if it is possible to use the stars for basic directional navigation? Or is it just some generic sky image tiled and repeated?  Overall, I don't think directional navigation is very useful. I would only use it to remember what direction I flew to get to an asteroid so I could find my way back (without GPS). Or to keep track of what direction relative to my starting position I have explored. It would be utterly useless in finding another player."

I pretty much guarantee that in a year or two when the devs put SE on Xbox One, it will be limited in some way. It might run at 1080p 60fps, but it'll probably have a limited smaller map, and probably have none or very limited modding support that Microsoft will try to get in the way off to only allow mods that they like. I mean look at Minecraft on the Xbox One and compare it to the PC version. It seems like a simple game that even laptops can run, bun even on the Xbox One the map was limited drastically when compared to the PC version. On top of that people had to pay for texture packs and skins."

Plus i prefer k+m to controllers so pc is the only choice amd feck off if you think im paying for a bullshit code to play online when ive already paid for an Internet connection.There are far more reasons for me to be on pc than on a console but thats me.

It will probably be  soon after that with xbox one ea support. I doubt it will be limited in terms of map size either once the optimization of the lod and bettering the off screen load.

spaceengineers,3d67w2,IGetThis,3,Tue Jul 14 03:44:39 2015 UTC,Isn't the idea to have the ring/sphere stationary and use the planet's gravity?
spaceengineers,3d67w2,Daiwon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:05:09 2015 UTC,"The idea of a dyson sphere or ring is based more on the idea of a sun then planet. You put it at about 1 AU from the sun, and you have so much land mass that you would never really fill it up. The advantage to doing this around a star is the solar power you could get, especially on a Dyson sphere, you would literally be surrounding the sun and capturing near 100% of the solar power it generates (think how very little we get on earth. We are just one tiny spot a couple million miles away). Because you want to capture all that solar power, you live on the INSIDE of the ring/sphere. The rings major advantage is that you just spin it to generate the gravity, the sphere you can do the same, but you lose gravity anywhere that doesn't spin in a way to cause gravity. The ring you lose a lot of solar energy as well.  Read Ringwolrd by Larry Niven, it's a scifi book, but an interesting read that kind of delves into the logistics of a ringworld."
spaceengineers,3d67w2,buster2Xk,2,Tue Jul 14 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"The entire ring can rotate in one direction, this stops it from falling out of the sky. Now with a sphere (assuming it's rotating with the axis of the planet) will be barely rotating at the poles, and that would be difficult to hold up. Tbh you'd likely end up with a slightly more jagged ring."
spaceengineers,3d67w2,lordkrike,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"I understand your line of thinking now. You're imagining it as if it's a ring of interconnected satellites? As in, each point on the ring is ""orbiting"" thus there is no strain on the ring itself, it just sits there rotating.  I was thinking of it more like a stone arch. The ""key stone"" in the middle sits on the two sides, which sit on the ground. Now imagine a whole ring of these key stones around a planet. They are pull down by gravity, but that force goes left and right into the other parts of the ring. It would be an immense force, but there might be a material which can do it, and higher altitude would lower the force.  A sphere would be like this but the force can go left, right, forward, and back. No rotation needed."
spaceengineers,3d67w2,buster2Xk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:40:05 2015 UTC,"Higher altitudes would not help, actually.

spaceengineers,3d67w2,lordkrike,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:01:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I did some looking.  Unfortunately, I'm a mathematician, not a structural engineer, so I can't really explain very well what's going on here; only that I've read that there is no known material that can withstand the compressive forces that a Dyson sphere would generate.  The best breakdown I could find was here.   Any sphere about a gravitating body can be analysed into two hemispheres joined at a seam. The contribution of a small section To the force on the seam is   g(ravity)*d(ensity)*t(hickness)*A(rea)*cos(angle).     The integral of Acos(angle) is (pi)R2.  So the total force is gdt(pi)R2. Which is independent of distance, neatly enough.  The area resisting the force is 2(pi)R*t.  Thus, the pressure is gdR/2; this can be translated into a cylindrical tower of a given height on Earth. If that tower built of that material can stand, then the compression strain is not too great.  At 1 AU, that comes to 2([pi]AU/YR)2, or -- by my calculations -- in the neighborhood of 80 to 90 THOUSAND kilometers high.  The tendncy to buckle, moreover, is another problem."
spaceengineers,3d67w2,aaronfranke,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:46:13 2015 UTC,"I'm both cases, the sphere or the ring, rotation does nothing to assist the object remaining in orbit as a consequence of the shell theorem. The net force is zero.  However, for a Niven ring that rotates around its star, if it gets offcenter it becomes unstable (famously so, with what happened with Niven and the Ringworld series)."
spaceengineers,3d67w2,lordkrike,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:52:30 2015 UTC,"The ring can rotate, keeping the bits in orbit. A sphere could spin, but it wouldn't be rotating on the poles. There isn't a known material that could build a sphere that could simply withstand gravity like a stone arch. However, if we lived in a world with an even amount of dimensions, such as 2D or 4D, then we could build a structure that completely surrounds any object and can still orbit (in a 4D world, a sphere can spin in two directions at once, I know it's mind-boggling but we just have to trust mathematicians here)."

spaceengineers,3d67w2,vrekais,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"Only if your craft actually generates atmospheric lift.  Otherwise, you're just wasting thrust unless you're trying to actually orbit."
spaceengineers,3d67w2,lordkrike,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:12 2015 UTC,It would mean that if you need Y thrusters to escape that they could be divided along two sides. If we had atmospheric lift then yes we'd only need the forward thrust but we can produce the lift with down thrusters and gain orbit parabolically  rather than perpendicularly.
spaceengineers,3d67w2,vrekais,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:10 2015 UTC,"If your TWR < 1 and you can't generate lift, you're not going up regardless.  There is no getting to orbit parabolically because you're always at the top of your parabola.  If your TWR > 1, you're going to go up regardless of any lift you generate.  There is a very small window where 105 m/s orbital velocity gets you enough of a reduction in the apparent force of gravity that your upward thrusters would then achieve a TWR > 1, but this is a pretty tiny edge case."
spaceengineers,3d67w2,lordkrike,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:39:11 2015 UTC,If the physics were accurate I'm sure that'd be true but my point was that if you point your ship at a 45° angle you can use  both your forward and upward thrusters potentially halving the number of forward thrusters you'd need for a 90° launch.
spaceengineers,3d67w2,vrekais,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:54:51 2015 UTC,"Think about that for a moment.  Two sets of thrusters at 45 degree offsets don't generate twice the linear force.  I wouldn't describe that as taking off ""in a spiral"" either, but whatever.  Even in this case, you're best off going straight up while holding a, say, high angle of attack so that you do get the benefit of using two sets of directional thrusters."
spaceengineers,3d67w2,lordkrike,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:38:36 2015 UTC,"I think we're arguing accross purposes and my used of the word spiral probably didn't help. This is what I mean.

spaceengineers,3d67w2,vrekais,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:17:51 2015 UTC,"In the red circled scenario, you're better off raising your angle of attack until your total thrust vector is straight up.  The horizontal component is wasted.  Since we can't really orbit and can't really generate lift, your best option is to go straight up.  This does work in real life... For example, the space shuttle's main engines are off of the SRBs axis of thrust."

spaceengineers,3d67w2,dartimos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:40:51 2015 UTC,It really might be possible.  I just don't have any KSP style tools to work it out.  At max speed you're really not going too fast.  Every time I get close enough to start feeling the tug and I turn off the inertial dampeners; I crash into the surface.  It's really fun to try though.

I know its a map that just sends auto controlled enemies to your base, but the idea is the same.  I would set autosave to disabled. I would set auto-reboot to 6 hours.  This way, the scenario would essentially restart itself every six hours with a freshly loaded map.  I also used SE Extender.  This can get even harder though, so I must inform you, server timer and game timer are on different ""timers"".  The game runs timers at the sim speed.  The server runs the timer on the real time.

spaceengineers,3d581a,Shinycappn,12,Mon Jul 13 16:55:41 2015 UTC,I think that we need some form of aerodynamics on planets even if it is designated wing parts and a very basic drag system. The reason we need this is because it makes a very definite distinction between atmospheric vs space combat. Your space craft should lose to a craft optimised of atmospheric combat in an atmosphere and your atmospheric fighter should loose out in space combat or be completely unable to function (if some sort of jet engines are implemented to increase the distinction).  Sure people will design craft that can cope with both but they will also be sub optimal in both.
spaceengineers,3d581a,woodlark14,6,Mon Jul 13 19:08:44 2015 UTC,"Completely agree! I understand how hard it would be, and this is SPACE engineers, but damn, it would add another dimension of engineering to the game."
spaceengineers,3d581a,TheSoftestTaco,5,Mon Jul 13 19:27:53 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to be complicated aerodynamics (although I would very much appreciate not having to use designated wing blocks) just enough to ensure that space optimal and atmosphere optimal are different.
spaceengineers,3d581a,woodlark14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:07 2015 UTC,"Anything that doesnt use predetermined blocks will be difficult though, that's all im trying to say i guess. Completely possible, but difficult and possibly taxing on processing power. This kind of stuff is always more complicated than you initially imagine.  That said, i would fucking looooove it."
spaceengineers,3d581a,TheSoftestTaco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't predetermined blocks help the space craft though? I mean, if optimal space craft = not aerodynamic, then that's one of the disadvantages of the space craft in atmosphere. If not having special surfaces means that atmosphere doesn't affect it, then it's not going to be nerfed in atmosphere.   Any way I look at it in my mind, the space craft is most likely going to have an advantage. Think of how dependent an airplane in on it's flying surfaces. All the space craft has to do is get a short or two on a wing and the plane goes down. But a space craft woudl be much less vulnerable."
spaceengineers,3d581a,WoodToTheMetal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah but thats super unrealistic imo because there would be no drag on the craft. The difference between a good spaceship and a good aircraft would only be ""does it have wing parts or not"". So i could make a stupidly shaped box that can fly in atmo with ease, or even put the wings inside of the craft, and itd still perform like a jet, which would take all engineering fun out of it for me and many others.  Please disreguard any typos and my lack of aposrophes, on my phone at work again.  EDIT: thought of a good example of what i mean, have you ever played robocraft? Its a load of fun, however the aerospace mechanics are the ones you mentioned, and there are some completely unrealistic crafts that should not even fly(theyre damn effective though!) in thereand it gets rediculous."

spaceengineers,3d581a,WoodToTheMetal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"Your space craft should lose to a craft optimised of atmospheric combat    The main difference is going to be weight. An airplane is going to require fewer thrusters (and fuel if oxygen breathing). Other than that, you could easily design a space craft with the same aerodynamic properties as an airplane and it shouldn't affect it's performance in space very much.   But, those extra thrusters could help the space plane even in atmosphere, so you'd probably just have to build each and test them."
spaceengineers,3d581a,woodlark14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:38 2015 UTC,Yes you could design a space craft to have wings but the additional weight would make your turning circle at max speed larger making it harder to get behind someone. The extra thrusters shouldn't compensate for the weight they add and hovering in one place is a great way to get shot to pieces. Also the wings would make you a bigger target in space as well as adding inert weight. So your craft could fight in both atmosphere and a vacuum but it wouldn't be ideal in either.

spaceengineers,3d2pz2,Hoose93,5,Mon Jul 13 03:48:54 2015 UTC,The planet. You can see the crest of it from the suns light on the right side
spaceengineers,3d2pz2,Ragejay,2,Mon Jul 13 03:55:53 2015 UTC,I'm slightly confused. Is what I'm looking at round or just a flat plane?
spaceengineers,3d2pz2,eloquent_moose,-7,Mon Jul 13 04:29:06 2015 UTC,no?
spaceengineers,3d2pz2,Lurking4Answers,6,Mon Jul 13 04:41:09 2015 UTC,I just wanted clarification because planets are round and what I'm seeing is flat. I didn't know if it was flat because of render distance and size causing it to appear flat or if it was flat because it wasn't actually a planet but a large plane.
spaceengineers,3d2pz2,eloquent_moose,12,Mon Jul 13 04:53:03 2015 UTC,That doesn't look at all flat to me. You can clearly see the curve on the horizon. It must be the size making at appear flat to you.
spaceengineers,3d2pz2,LaboratoryOne,2,Mon Jul 13 05:35:52 2015 UTC,A spherical render area will cause a vast plane to have visible round edges. Looks very flat to me.

spaceengineers,3d5t37,HeavenlyUser,3,Mon Jul 13 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/user/SpaceEngineersGame  This channel has a short video for pretty much every feature. To my knowledge there is not anyone doing a tutorial series. It is kinda hard when the game gets updated every week, and some stuff changes.   For oxygen to work you need a oxygen generator, which needs ice, and then it needs vents in each room all connected through conveyors. You can add oxygen tanks to store up excess O2.  Ship connectors are easy, just maneuver your ships with connectors so that the connectors are about to touch, when they turn yellow hit ""p"" key on your keyboard.   Basically, you want a system that goes connector >conveyor > refinery/oxygen generator /arc furnace /storage/oxygen tanks > conveyor >assembler/reactor > storage. Refineries, assemblers, oxygen generators, turrets, reactors will pull what they can use automatically, it just had to be all interconnected.   https://youtube.com/channel/UCt_uDRYyHt7aKEV2ulanhXQ gas bandit has a few starter tutorials but it looks to be missing to the O2 update.

If something gets too specific then I'd ask here. There are tons of helpful folk here.   I can help you with some of the issues here.    connecting small ships to large ships for dropping off supplies stuff like that   Use connectors to transfer items between big and small ships. You just line up the connectors and press ""P"" to lock it and connect inventories.  As of right now there is no reliable way to ""dock"" 2 ships together permanently. Connectors will break loose under high speed. Rotors, pistons, and landing gears all have bugs that will cause explosions.

spaceengineers,3d3ae1,xXRandomYoXx,9,Mon Jul 13 04:28:20 2015 UTC,I think the Star Trek warp looks the best but to have that effect I think the warp drive should make you point in the general direction of the waypoint.  I like the BSG warp because of its simplicity and also it allows for cool things like the adama maneuver which looks awesome and as soon as planets are released that is the first thing I'm gonna try out.
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,AeroFace,4,Mon Jul 13 04:44:10 2015 UTC,"I loved the sonic boom caused by the Galactica jumping out of the planet's atmosphere. Big vacuum hole where she was, and everybody on the ground is like OMG MY EARS!"
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,darkthought,3,Mon Jul 13 14:57:46 2015 UTC,"I think the flash needs to scale with the size of the ship if possible, I don't think it currently does which makes the flash seem small for some ships, not sure.  It needs to be bigger and it needs to be brighter and it keeps be accompanied by an effect at the other end.  Not a fan of the fish eye thing, I get the sense that it might look good in a film but in a game it just makes all the lines look pixelated and ruins the realism (the irony I know)."
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,vrekais,5,Mon Jul 13 07:48:59 2015 UTC,"That would be cool. Super Carriers would have huge flashes. Can't wait to see large fleets initiating jumps in sync.   Also, in the context of Warhammer the eye portal makes a lot of sense. It looked nice in the cut scenes from Dawn of War 2, but it wouldn't work in a sandbox. Again, like I said, it was included as a far out example."
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,vrekais,2,Mon Jul 13 09:17:22 2015 UTC,"The current issue with fleet warps is the 2km exclusion zone... I am curious about what happens if 2 ships jump at the same time on the same vector on a blind jump though, maybe they'd come out close by.  If that works I like the skill required in timing the jumps, or you'll end up ~2km away from your fleet.  The only other option is some sort of deployable arm that allows a fleet to link up with connectors before jumping, which would also be kinda cool. Or a jump link ship that is there almost solely to link a fleet together for jumps."
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,vrekais,2,Mon Jul 13 12:30:07 2015 UTC,"Because of this, command ships are a lot more useful. Now you need to co-ordinate fleet jumps, and generally, fleet movements are decided by the command cruiser. Perhaps a device that can be built that allows for one ship to transmit jump coords to the other ships in the fleet. Also, a fleet system would be cool. Your faction can be split into fleets and fleets can be split into wings. This way, you can give messages to specific groups of ships. Once the netcode is better, this would allow for fleet tactics that are much more advanced than they are now.   I don't like the deploy-able arm idea, but maybe the ability to lock on to a ship, perhaps using the device mentioned previous, and auto jump with it. This way, you don't end up away from the group, out of formation, or, if it comes to it, crashing into a friendly. The command ship would have a transmitter, and each ship in its fleet or wing would have a receiver. The transmitter would be an important target, because if you take it out you can make enemy fleet movements chaotic and unorganized."
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,creepig,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not fond of the arm idea, from a fluff point of view Jump is usually stressful on the hull and having a weak arm attaching you to another ship doesn't really seem like a good plan.  I've seen films or shows where the nav computers of ships in a fleet are slaved to another ship, this would be ideal. I haven't tested simultaneous blind jumping yet but it's realistically only going to work at short range because otherwise any small degree difference in vector could lead to massive distance (much greater than 2km) error at the other end."
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,vrekais,2,Mon Jul 13 22:53:42 2015 UTC,Slaving systems like that were very popular in the Star Wars EU. That's where I got the idea.
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,Fasgort,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"The jump drive does its obstruction check at jump initiation, it would seem.  So long as the fleet initiates jump before the first ship has jumped away, the obstruction zone won't be an issue."
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,CAPTAlNJAPAN,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting, have you tested that then? So aslong as everyone presses the jump button before anyone has jumped they can all jump close by? I take this needs to be a blind jump because I've already seen what happens when people jump two ships to the same point."
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,notanimposter,5,Mon Jul 13 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"I'd really like that the warp weren't instantaneous. It would spawn you in some ""kind of strange portal"" where you are travelling at high speed until you reach the destination target. You wouldn't be able to get out the seats, and you would be in warp speed depending in the distance between start and end points."
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,draconisis,3,Mon Jul 13 13:47:54 2015 UTC,"I like the way it happens in Star Trek. For Space Engineers, once the jump drive is about to jump, have the ship accelerate to the top speed in about 3 seconds, and then jump once you reached the top speed."

spaceengineers,3d3ae1,vrekais,3,Mon Jul 13 16:11:29 2015 UTC,The homeworld and B5 systems would be weird to do as the ship is half in and half out of reality during a jump. So being attacked well jumping would have to make the ship take no damage during jump or something like that.
spaceengineers,3d3ae1,Yeniuss,2,Mon Jul 13 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"This is true, especially with how long Homeworld jumps take. Would be interesting to add jump malfunctions if the jump drive(s) got damaged while you were trying to escape, ranging from arriving of target by a couple km to a complete meltdown where the disrupted jump field collapses back in on the ship."

spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Republiken,9,Sun Jul 12 19:18:02 2015 UTC,Just means you need more gravity generators.
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,shaggy1265,2,Sun Jul 12 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess."
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Republiken,5,Sun Jul 12 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"At some point, there would be a gravity well so powerful, you'd need infinite gravity gens to leave it though."

spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Mr-Maguffin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"force = mass * acceleration.   The ""natural"" gravity acts on the entire ship, whereas the ""artificial gravity"" acts only on the artificial mass blocks.   So if your artificial mass blocks are 1/100th the mass of your ship, you need 100 times more artificial gravity than natural gravity for their forces to be equal.   Of course, each artificial mass block equally adds to your natural mass too - as do the other components of your gravity drive system (the gravity generators mainly, but also reactors to power everything)."
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,_BurntToast_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:43:08 2015 UTC,Grav drives scale very very exponentially and with enough grav gens you will. Its broken and they need to be removed from the game but that is the only way your getting off that thing
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Noobymcnoobcake,4,Mon Jul 13 06:32:09 2015 UTC,technically they scale quadratically
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,jack1197,-7,Sun Jul 12 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"Since mass blocks are only in the game to make cars work in the current version, they really should remove them when natural gravity planets are live."
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Skov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:47:08 2015 UTC,No they should most definitely keep them but just put an equal and opposite force on the grav gen
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Noobymcnoobcake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:14:07 2015 UTC,They could also make it so that grav gens on the same grid as artificial mass don't affect them if they wanted to nerf grav drives. In my opinion now that warp drives exist i dont think they are as necessary anymore for other things than lifting off from planets.
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Blue_Crusader,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:15:29 2015 UTC,that is exactly what my suggestion would do but mine would add a little recoil to grav guns and also prevent grav gens on rotors being new way to do grav drives. Rotors are on separate grids.
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Noobymcnoobcake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:35:50 2015 UTC,Well you could put grav gens on rotors put preventing them from working with attached grids would be easy i image. making a seperate grid and connecting it via landing gear or even having it completely seperate would end badly anyways with the current way of things. at that point a grav drive would be more trouble than its worth and that would balance it nicely if need be
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Blue_Crusader,4,Mon Jul 13 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"hmm, now there's an idea. a dedicated launching platform. add just enough grav generators to a base on the surface to negate the planets gravity, slap a mass block on your ship, and use thrusters to escape the atmosphere. could save a ton of space onboard ship, and be used for multiple ships."

I'm sure once planets are done, and programmers can focus on optimizing the code more, earth sized planets will be possible."

spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Angryfa,6,Sun Jul 12 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"Because if the gravity would be realistic, 'planets' in this game wouldn't even have any noticable gravity. They also wouldn't have any atmosphere."

spaceengineers,3d1dgf,farhil,3,Mon Jul 13 14:42:13 2015 UTC,It's going to depend on the size of the planet.   I think the average sized planets are at 1g and they fluctuate a bit up and down from there. Moons will probably be .5 or so.
spaceengineers,3d1dgf,Jetmann114,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:00:47 2015 UTC,I think it's twice the planet's radius by default but it can be configured.

You had to fly faster than 300 m/s to reach the safe zone.    Furthermore the safe zone only gets checked once the jump gets initialized but not when performed (unless they fixed it this weekend).

spaceengineers,3d3eaa,Dracon270,3,Mon Jul 13 05:07:52 2015 UTC,"It's the way the game handles two separate grids attached to each other. Normally if it's all one grid, thrusters' thrusts (try saying that 5 times fast...) will apply to the center of mass of that grid and all will be happy. If you add on another grid to that, though, it actually applies the thrust ""properly,"" hence why you get the drag. Theoretically if you aligned the connections perfectly in line with the CoM your travel in two directions would be fine. The less massive the extra grid is compared to the main grid, the less the drag will be.  Otherwise the only way to get that to not happen is to merge the two grids together with merge blocks."
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,bmalloy1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:58:23 2015 UTC,Would a mass block on the other side set to the mass of the drone balance it?
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,atari_eric,2,Mon Jul 13 06:08:42 2015 UTC,Only if it is also a separate grid.
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,lowrads,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"My current idea is to add an overhang with another big block at the back.  Then, the drone would kind of slide into that ""empty"" space, where the ship just has a single block thick wall running to the back. Currently, it's just stuck to the back.  I'm also interested in eric's idea here, with the mass block..."
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,Danjiano,3,Mon Jul 13 06:45:16 2015 UTC,"I think that's called torque. Try to make sure your mining bot docks at where the center of gravity should be, or at least behind it. That way it shouldn't mess up your steering if you go forward."
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,darkness21,2,Mon Jul 13 07:34:08 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need to disable inertial dampeners on the drone.
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,Purple_Antwerp,6,Mon Jul 13 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it's even a problem when the drone's thrusters are turned off completely."
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,Purple_Antwerp,2,Mon Jul 13 05:18:00 2015 UTC,"Two things:   Easy way: also use merge blocks next to your connectors.   Make sure to turn one connector off (not unlocked, off) when unmerging so the pull doesn't cause damage.  Also remember you permanently fuse ships with merge blocks if anything is touching that normally connects to each other (I.e. two square armor blocks). Harder:  balance out your center of mass.  If you connect two objects and they're perfectly symmetrical, you won't get drag.  You can view center of mass in the Info tab."
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,Caridor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:33:53 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly used to merge blocks (I use the modular utility ship design someone posted here), however, I've noticed when you re-separate the ships, the drone loses it's edited name, which can make it difficult to remote control the right one :/"
spaceengineers,3d3eaa,LAK132,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:46:48 2015 UTC,That is indeed a massive pain.  I think then using on/off artificial mass (or using timers to jack up/down space balls) might be the way to go.  It won't solve it but will make it more bearable.

We have a 3k radius safe area around 0,0,0.  I've been surprised at the lack of griefing; first, we are an established server so our blacklist is fairly long - I suggest finding minions like myself to help maintain yours 24/7 as a last resort line of defense.  Having a longer load time helps keep the babies-who-like-hacking out too.  That said we have updated blueprints of our permanent facilities, suggest players BP any major ships they make, and most importantly have cultivated what I think is a great community of folks who watch out for bullshit.  For example: I've personally (legit pvp) raided people and had them turn around and report griefers right after; building that kind of userbase is critical since you can't keep eyes on everything 24/7.  Finally, have constant ""/admin backup"" going through server extender; we run several a day, and generally off schedule ones as soon as  a ""XXX_TWINKLETOES-BONGS_XXX"" logs in.  This means quick turnaround and nearly zero work lost when someone does hack beyond basic griefing/ramming.  So, in rough order:   be a good community Be online Backup/Blueprint everything   Hope that helps!  We're down to one or two griefers a week at most, and basically none leave any real trace when we're done with them...  Finally, theres a sorta quiet blacklist shared among admins for this stuff. Look around.    P.s. And PM me anyone really bad (i.e. serious, especially new, hacks).  Specifically anyone you suspect might be doing *actually** illegal things elsewhere, with proof :)*"

HOWEVER, Since SE (for me) doesn't alt-tab properly: You have to do this once, force-quit out of SE (Don't stop recording), and then go BACK into SE and it'll be recording.

spaceengineers,3d03bb,plaYer2k,3,Sun Jul 12 14:50:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on your hardware. I use shadowplay for all my videos as the video quality is the best and i have almost no performance impact (~5%?). Though that of course requires you to have a GTX 6xx and newer.    GVR for AMD cards works similarly good if you got a ~7700 or newer afaik.    If none of that applies, try DxTory.    Any other software most likely does not access the hardwares video buffer directly to grab the images and thus cause a rather large performance drop.   The storage size should also not be an issue for people with modern HDDs where 1TB is considered small."

spaceengineers,3d03bb,AI221,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"probably because it's a lossless compression or something where as OBS is lossy. either way, you could probably run it through a tool to compress it.

spaceengineers,3d03bb,fanzypantz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"Shadowplay is definitely not a lossless codec.. My god I needed to turn up the quality settings to max on SP and it did not look as good as OBS with lower quality preset. Even at 60fps OBS is higher quality and has a lower file size. It's so awesome you don't even need to use SSD cache to get higher write speeds, a normal HDD is fine.   Take it from a guy that studied 3D game design and editing video was a part of it.   OBS works on AMD as well and is free. So great choice for anyone streaming or recording since it can do both, at the same time."
