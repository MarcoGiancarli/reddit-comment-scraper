Polandballart,3blfy0,Scub_,4,Tue Jun 30 04:24:53 2015 UTC,"I have a question.  There seem to be 2 different approaches for drawing high-end art. One is using the smallest pencil size and adding lots of random lines in different colours to make an object look more detailed. The other is having several areas filled completely with a shade of the main colour.  What impresses me in your drawing is that it obviously uses both styles. Fine lines for the water, and coloured areas for the rocks.  My question is, how do you decide that one part of a drawing should be done this way and another part in a different way? Did you base it off the structure of the material you're drawing, or was it just intuitive?"
Polandballart,3blfy0,SuperPolentaman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:49:29 2015 UTC,It's the aesthetics and texture of the object. I might just make a  tutorial and submit to the wiki later.
