Hunting,3e39ei,badlandmule,6,Tue Jul 21 20:28:20 2015 UTC,I thought he jumped like that because he saw a snow snake.

Hunting,3e2fst,rabidpenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:36 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying. I was a LEO ranger for years and sick or ill animals are always put down according to fed guidelines. We use a 22 (I actually had a Marlin 60) and we attempt to do a head shot in specific kill spots depending on the animal. Even if this was a cull event the gut shot and celebrations at the end were just shitty. Im willing to bet this is a used up bull being taken out of breeding stock and that the animal was separated and under fed or not fed and possibly drugged for the ""hunt""."
Hunting,3e2fst,c3h8pro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"Just a glance at the grass and the browse line on the trees shows that the place is completely overgrazed and/or overstocked. Compare it to the other side of the fence at the 16 second mark to see what the cross timbers of Texas should look like.  In the wooded part of the Cross Timbers you shouldn't be able to see a couple hundred acres through the trees.  The video was uploaded Feb. 2012, so we were in the middle of one of our worse droughts and this ranch apparently tried to hold on to too much animal with too little grass.  The sad part (for the land) is that for quite a few years carrying capacity will be a fraction of what it once was.  TL;DR: Shitty landowners make for shitty land stewards."

I'm sure it's very expensive to bring them in.  I know ranches in Texas can be HUGE so if you have several thousand acres, I don't see this as an issue.    But this.  These elk were obviously used to human interaction, they weren't spooked at all.  It also looks like a summer hunt, maybe they were too hot to run away?  I know cattle like to congregate in the shade and don't move much during hot summer days in Texas.  They might moo, but they'll rarely even stand up unless you walk right up to them.  I know elk aren't naturally found in this climate so maybe they're doing the same."

I've talked to some guys who know it isn't real hunting, but they can afford it and want a nice elk (or whatever) mounted and want the meat as well. So be it.  I also know some of those high fenced ranches provide habitat for otherwise endangered African species. It's not ideal, but it provides an economic incentive to keep them around and that's kinda cool. Forget what species it was but there was a TV special posted here and/or /r/videos that laid out the pros and cons for it.  All that said, if you think this is ""hunting"" or post a YouTube video with gay ass metal music while you ""stalk"" an elk from 5 yards away, you're a total douche.

Hunting,3e2fst,jimmoose,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:08:14 2015 UTC,"Fact of life, people do it and aren't going to stop either.  The high fence hunting are on preserves, sometimes thousands of acres with stocked animals.  They are carefully raised and taken care of.  You pay X number of dollars depending on the spices , size, rack configuration and weight, they are all cataloged and damn near tame.  For most that are fans of fair hunt, which I am, its not what they would want and there is nothing fair about it.  For the older folks, disabled or challenged , it has its uses.  Would I do it?  No, its no thrill to take an animal that won't even run from you, it will stand there and think you're going to feed it. As a side note, I'm in my 60s, fair condition and hunt regularly.  I was in Idaho for 21 days last year elk hunting, it was murder.  It took that long to get close enough, I saw plenty of elk but they were thousands of yards away.  Most can't afford to stay that long, its very cost prohibitive.  I live on the east coast on a barrier island at near sea level, put me at 8000 feet in the mountains and hunting becomes damn near impossible.  No air, mountains straight up and terrain thats suited for elk and nothing else. These planned hunts are not going away in our lifetimes, just remember, not everyone can spend the money or have the time for fair hunt.  If its humane and respectful hunting, doesn't make it right, its just better than the alternative.  Just my opinion."
Hunting,3e4pn2,elduderino260,2,Tue Jul 21 22:59:31 2015 UTC,"The book Big Bucks The Benoit Way is about a group of family members in maine that stock deer.  I would highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn about stalking.    I usually sit in a treestand in the morning until I get too cold or bored.  I take the rest of the day to walk around and follow fresh tracks.  The brush where I hunt is really thick, so it provides cover for the deer.  It's really fun when you can hear the deer in front of you but can't see it.  Eventually one of you will make a mistake and the hunt is over.    My biggest tip is about pausing.  As you walk remember to stop and scan the woods.  Most deer will let you walk right by them without moving and you won't see them.     Clothing is my second biggest tip.  When I'm hunting, I have to do some serious layer control if i'm gonna make it all day.  The temp can vary anywhere from -20 F to 35 F.  I typically wear in this order:  long johns  t-shirt  hoodie  heavy wool longsleeve shirt  down vest   2 layer jacket with removeable liner  With this set up I can quickly change over from walking to standing attire or vice versa.  When I'm walking i wear up to the wool plus the outer layer of the jacket.  On warmer days I will shed the wool too.    Get a good compass and carry matches on you.

Take a few steps then look around.  Sometimes you may spot deer 100+ yards away, sometimes they will burst out of the brush pile you just passed 10 yards behind you.  A friend and I were putting up a ladder stand, and when we walked into the area one of us carried stand parts, the other a rifle.  We looked carefully for deer, then set the rifle down and made 2 more trips on foot to the truck to get stand parts (5 minutes each trip).  After we laid out the parts and began assembling the stand a deer charged out of a brush pile that was no more than 20 yards in front of our stand!"
Hunting,3e4pn2,wellbeyond,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:19:54 2015 UTC,"I've always ever walked and stalked. You can cover a hell of a lot more country and see more animals. Hell anymore now elk won't even answer bugling or cow talk, so staying in one spot for long is pretty pointless. Either bow or rifle, knowing the country as well as general wind patterns is essential. For both my elk and antelope this past season I got within 40-50 yards during rifle season. Also knowing when to duck and cover as well as not moving is invaluable."
Hunting,3e4pn2,Flossterbation,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"A tip I've heard a lot is to vary the pace of your steps - i.e. don't walk at a constant rate, but take a few quick steps, stop, a few slow ones, etc. The idea is to sound more like another critter - wild animals don't walk at the same rate all the time like humans do, so it makes you sound like you belong in the woods a bit more. Now, I can't provide any evidence that it actually works, but I always thought it was a neat idea.  Also, when you stop to look around, don't just look around at eye-level. Bend down, lean to the side, etc, to see through the trees at different angles. You'll rarely see the outline of an entire deer, so look for some visual cues - the flick of an ear, the out-of-place horizontal line of a deer's back, etc."
Hunting,3e3cqr,IWantToBeAProducer,5,Tue Jul 21 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"This is why most states have deer hunting rules that say ""antlered"" or ""antler less"" for tags, kind of hard to check out the undercarriage of a deer in the field ;)"

Hunting,3e3axi,Oliveritaly,5,Tue Jul 21 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"Most animals have very tiny brains so depending where it hits, a .22 bullet could go right thru their head without significantly damaging the brain.  Its not the caliber, .22 is perfect for groundhogs as we call them in the South.  The heart and lungs are a much bigger target and more lethal shot.  Stop the oxygen to the brain and its going to die quickly.  I shot a bear once that had an old, healed up rifle shot straight thru its head and he had gone on to live for years afterwards until he crossed my path, if that tells you anything.  The skull healed by making massive calcium deposits around the bullet damage.  I didn't fully understand exactly what it was when I first examined the skull, thought it might be a tumor?, but my taxidermist did.  He'd seen it before. Its an interesting skull to show to people.  But the bottom line is the brain is a very small target that is hard to hit accurately especially on animals that have a lot of bone in their skulls like hog and bear.  Can you get good at it? Yes.  Did that groundhog need killing, yes. We have some acreage so, yeah, no need to dig a grave.  We take carcasses upwind of the homestead and dump them in the forest (on our own land).  They're gone, everything, bones and all, in a few days.  There may be regulations in different states about transporting or dumping game carcasses, disease issues, etc. so check to be sure."
Hunting,3e3axi,gator2442,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:32 2015 UTC,THAT makes a lot of sense.  It crawled away a few feet into some brush but collapsed there.  It was too wounded to move when I came upon it and shot it the second time.   Likely 15 seconds layer maybe?  It still seemed conscious but wounded?
Hunting,3e3axi,gator2442,4,Tue Jul 21 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"You did a good job.  A headshot on a groundhog isn't really a bad thing.  You had to get rid of it, its tearing up property, and if it stayed there long, there would be baby groundhogs down in that hole.   The will to live is so strong that death is rarely instant and never pretty but its part of the cycle of life that we must accept.  Ethical hunters strive to kill as quickly and humanely as possible but there usually is some squirming and twitching."

I don't care what the humane society has to say about it. When the population gets out of control, hairless coyotes are more frequent than when we let coyote-hunters on our properties.    That kind of makes me not too unlike the coyotes. The deer they might kill are almost always a baby or diseased adult."

Hunting,3e3byq,annoyingfan,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"Like they said, a $20-30 call is good to begin with. Here's a starter of the basic mechanics of a quack. The other videos in the series are pretty solid too. Don't even think about greeting or comeback calls until you're consistent with the quack. Be able to do 8-10 identical quacks in a row. Best conservation tool ever invented is a duck call in the hands of an inexperienced caller."
Hunting,3e3byq,QuackAddict,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"Don't get a $100 duck call to start, get a cheaper one.  THe expensive ones aren't really with it for the sound they make or the ease of blowing, they're expensive because they're made with expensive materials or just because of the logo.  You want to get calls that match up with what you expect to hunt - a teal is slightly different from a mallard, but a wood duck or a pintail are far difference from a mallard.  You're probably safe getting a regular mallard calls, I've got the duck commander Uncle Si single reed mallard call, and the DC teal call, and they're not bad.  I see Cabela's has a Rich-n-tone mallard call for less than $30, that one should be decent too.  The best piece of advice I can give you, especially if you're going hunting with seasoned duck hunters, is to keep that call in your pocket the whole time.  Everyone's got their own idea of what good duck calling sounds like, and it's almost never another hunter's duck calling that they like."
Hunting,3e3byq,rgraham888,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was hoping someone would say whether or not an expensive call would even be worth the money. I'll keep shopping for sure, and it's nice to hear that more moderately priced calls should work just fine.   Also, I'm not a complete newbie with calling. I'm going out with the guys I grew up hunting with. I just haven't been out since my kid was born, and feel like I could use some pointers and practice before going out again. But you're absolutely right, if I didn't know these guys that well, I'd never take my call out."

As far as instructions, I like this video. Its very simple and he explains why it works the way it does. https://youtu.be/yrN17kElVps Also Jase from Duck Commanders explains it. https://youtu.be/_TDAwWxRCL0 And then Jeff Williams is a  world champion caller and he has a very good instructional video on the 3 basic calls: the quack, the comeback, and the feeding calls.

Hunting,3e0ffa,filthyllama,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:25 2015 UTC,The fact that it's a chipmunk is beside the point. It doesn't matter what he's shooting.  He's using a field point. This is on par with a kid sticking critters with a long ice pick or skewing a white tail with an iron rod. If this shot was off by half an inch it wouldn't be nearly as clean a kill.

Putting holes in some critter doesn't make you a hunter or the act a hunt.  I'm not sure about chipmunk guy (OP). If he's just chilling on his back porch drinking a cold one and shooting chipmunks with his compound then I don't think it's much of a hunt.  On the other hand, if he spots-n-stalks that's a different story. OP would glass the chipmunk from 2km and then (with ghillie suit) slowly and methodically still-hunt the chipmunk, moving in from down wind. He gauges the distance with a range finder and takes his shot. The chipmunk takes the 500 gr arrow through a lung. With the 70 lbs compound, it's a clean pass-through. The chipmunk bolts into the underbrush. He tracks the chipmunk blood trail for 1km, tags it, field dresses it, and packs the meat out.  Or it could be a hunt if he uses a little chipmunk-sized pop-up blind or tree-stand with little chipmunk decoys below.  :-D Sorry, I had to share that image.  Edit:  ...After getting to the car, he begins lashing the chipmunk to the roof of the car..."

Apparently they invade cavities like this because, unlike other native and more common species, they do not excavate their own holes and tunnels. They have been wreaking havoc in the Gulf Coast area especially by destroying electrical control units for air conditioning and any other cavity they can invade.   They can short out electronics by getting shocked, releasing an alarm pheromone which causes ants to attack wires and circuits. Crazy."

I had to take it all apart to get it cleaned out (lost a few screws and one of the switch covers in the process because I didn't want ants inside the house).  I noticed there are two small holes on the bottom of the front door, which is where I assume the ants were able to get in. I sealed them up with some silicone and put the camera back up.

Get your bow from a local shop that will help you pick a setup. Take lessons to develop good form and habits. Don't take shots you can't make.  Also, don't go shoot critters with field points, even if it's a small critter. Know your arrows and your arrow points."

Its sort of like saying I want to be a pitcher and rather than getting experience in the little leagues you want to go straight to the big leagues.  I'm not trying to discourage you, far from it, I just think without a hunting mentor, you may not have much success, become frustrated, and lose interest.  I could be wrong, you may be so driven that nothing stops you from becoming a great bow hunter, but in my limited experience teaching people to hunt and fish, they need some quick success to maintain their interest level. Most successful bow hunters have had a few hunting mentors that helped show them the ropes."

Hunting,3dyqm0,Nhh20,3,Mon Jul 20 16:55:57 2015 UTC,"NC is a diverse state with a growing black bear population.  The East Coast of NC has some of the largest black bears in the world.  I don't know much about the coastal region, wish I did, but in WNC, if you put in time scouting, getting a bear with a bow or gun from a tree stand on public land isn't an impossible task. You need to be willing and able to do a lot walking and scouting, mostly in rough terrain."
Hunting,3dyqm0,gator2442,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Where do you hunt for them in WNC? Also would you mind giving me some specific info on signs, food sources, where to setup stand, etc. I was thinking about trying nantahala? Any knowledge of this area?  Thank you so much"
Hunting,3dyqm0,gator2442,3,Mon Jul 20 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"Nantahala is as steep as a horse's face! Nantahala means land of the noon day sun. There's a lot of deep, dark, cold hollers in Nantahala and bear love them but getting a bear out of there might be an issue.  Wow, I don't even know how to tell you to start.  I grew up in a hunting family and it took me years of scouting to establish my stands.  But the key to hunting the mountains is learning where good white oaks are located.  If you're new to hunting the mtns, you might want to scout and still hunt at the same time while learning the woods, you might get lucky.  I scout 12 months out of the year and the only person that knows where my stands are is my gf because she trout fishes with me and I do a lot of scouting when we fish.  I can never leave her because she might tell someone where my stands are, lol!  Read everything you can about bear hunting.  Bear sign and trails can be subtle because of their soft paws but all animals generally take the path of least resistance thru the mountains.  Bears are lazy, they will walk down forest service roads, old logging roads, or hiking trails when available. You can look for bear slides coming off hills onto those types of roads.  And unlike deer, bear can be loud coming through the woods, you will often hear their breathing before you see them, if you see them.  They get the crap dogged out of them in NC so they're skittish as all get out.  Slightest whiff of human scent and they're gone. Bear can smell things up to 6-7 miles away so you have to play the wind which can be difficult in the mountains because it tends to do a lot of unpredictable swirling.  That's why I look for trees that I can get my climbing stand as high as possible, like 30-40 foot high, anything below 25 foot is a waste of time.  Bear rut in June and will mark up trees by biting them as high up as they can, usually at the intersections of trails like where a main game trail converges with a side trail. That's how you can tell how big they are, the higher up the tree, etc.  Sometimes they rip off limbs and lay them in the trail as a sign to other bear.  Don't ask me why but I find that sometimes near bear marking trees.  You might can still find some relatively fresh rut sign right now.  And watch your step for timber rattlers, particularly if you're walking thru sunny, south facing rocks.  Wear good boots, keep an eye out, and you'll be fine with the snakes."

Not sure exactly where Beech Gap, there's probably multiple places called Beech Gap, but gaps can be productive for bear hunting its just sort of go big or go home proposition.  You may sit there for days and see nothing or someone's bear dogs might run a bear right to you."

No knock against the dog guys, but there are fewer greater pains in the ass than setting up in a climber an hour before daybreak, silent, stealthy, and fully scent protected, and then having five dogs and six guys walk right beneath your tree at 7:00 a.m."

This is accurate enough (up to 5 1/2 years) for field work. For example, when we work deer check stations we have to document the age of the deer. Obviously we can't cut the teeth and use a microscope when sitting next to a gas station with four people in line so we check the wear."

When I lived in Iowa it seemed like everyone knew a guy who poached deer. Even though, I thought it was wrong - it was kind of accepted.   In the west if you poach a deer and anyone finds out, you will be turned in. It's different.   In the east you can go to Walmart and buy a deer tag.   In the west, most states you have to play a lottery type system to get a deer tag (very few OTC deer tags).  In the east deer are very numerous. More numerous creates less value for each individual.   In the west deer are less numerous. Less numerous creates more value for each individual.   With a majority of land being public, the deer are viewed as our deer versus in the majority of the land being private - it is their deer or his/her deer.

Hunting,3dv5n2,Tautuku,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:50:09 2015 UTC,"This is a well-written defense of hunting for meat, however, it should be noted that ""trophy hunting"" is not the evil that it is made out to be.  I know quite a few trophy hunters and most of them are ethical hunters also.  They hunt for the biggest buck they can find and will pass up bucks every year just to get the one big guy.  They still use all of the meat in the buck (mostly making sausage from it).  They spend more on conservation and animal health than a lot of meat hunters I know because they are trying to raise up really healthy big deer.    Trophy hunts also have good conservation and economic value where they are allowed.  For example, predator hunts are almost always trophy hunts, but they are also a good way to control the predator population. Most trophy hunts involve going after the biggest oldest animal in the field. Many times, this simply pulls an already non-breeding animal out of the population. In places like Africa, trophy hunts actually generate economic output for the countries apart from the ""value of the tag."" Basically, not only am I hiring a guide to take me hunting, but an entire outfit. This includes spotters, trackers, a professional hunter, cooks, camp attendants, etc. It creates an industry out of nothing more than the demand for renewable natural fauna. Trophy hunts provide for a great deal of wildlife conservation in many parts of the world. Absent those hunting, there would be no wildlife. Trophy hunting helps to provide for game control that could not be coordinated in most of these countries without the professional outfits helping to locate, track, and identify game. Additionally, many of these outfits bring government game trackers on hunts to help the governments monitor the game. Finally, the professional outfits also help to deter poachers from unregulated slaughter of game.

You pay them back with the first harvest you acquire. With either a portion of the meat or make them a gift out of the by-product or make them a dinner with the harvest.   That and just being friendly/honest with locals always gets me into the right spot."
Hunting,3durbw,infrequentia,3,Sun Jul 19 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"First things first, go complete your hunters education if you haven't already. Then, go shoot. Learn the basics of marksmanship and practice.  Are you an outdoorsy kind of person? Before I picked up hunting I enjoyed hiking and fishing. I like spending time in the woods. I like to go on backpacking trips, spending the night in the woods is pretty awesome and relaxing. Most of your hunting is going to at least involve walking through the woods and spending time there, fruitlessly for a good portion of it. If you don't enjoy just being in the woods, hunting would probably get old quickly.  With that said, this year will be my first deer hunting. I have a similar background to you - my family didn't hunt. I just started last year, and I started 'easy'. I went for Grouse. I know it sounds lame to 'start easy', but it would give you a good introduction to hunting, and unless you never leave your house during the season I'm sure you'll get at least a few. One word of warning though - don't underestimate these animals. If you look up grouse you'll see people calling them fools hens, people talking about how easy it is to locate them, etc etc. I can tell you from experience that finding them can be tough. Once you do locate them, you'll see why they're called fools hens. The only thing you'd need at this point for grouse would be some hunters orange and ammo. Also, with a small game license if you run across a rabbit(and if they're in season) you could take one of those while you're out. One caveat - check your local hunting regulations. Here in Washington, we're allowed to take grouse with a rifle. Some states do not allow it.  Now, if grouse are considered easy, what do you think hitting the ground for deer, elk or bear is going to be like? These are considered challenging at the very least.   If you follow my advice you won't need camo until next year when you start going for bigger game. I ended up going with Sitka. Partly because of the reviews it gets, and partly because of the construction of the pieces. There are a lot of cheaper camo pieces in cotton or cotton blends, which aren't optimal for outdoor usage.   As far as your vehicle - for grouse you won't need anything special. The logging roads you'll drive down are just a jump off point and most are fine for sedans or otherwise. I was using a Honda Fit for my hunting last year.  If I were you I'd pass over the rifled barrel on the shotty if you're going to buy a 30-06. The amount of recoil you'll endure shooting slugs is huge, more than the 30-06. Did I mention that slugs don't have the range of the 06? I know a lot can change when you actually go to buy your first rifle, but I'd stick to the more available calibers. The 30-06, 270, and 308 are able to handle pretty much anything animal-wise, are hugely available, and the recoil is manageable. Don't fall into the magnum trap for your first rifle. Not only is ammo ridiculously expensive, but the recoil is excessive.  As far as what to bring on your hunts, google the 10 essentials.  preemptive edit - You'll find that there are other options as far as chambering for your rifle. 7mm-08 and .243 come to mind but there are countless others. The reason I excluded them from this is because of availability. You can get 308, 30-06 and 270 nearly everywhere that sells ammo, even if the selection sucks."
Hunting,3durbw,jr12345,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"I can't say I'm an outdoorsy type of person, as I didn't have much opportunity to go camping and what not, my dad doesn't know how to do any of that. I do love to hike though, nature always fascinated me in the sense everything plays a role. Usually. I find it relaxing getting out and away from everyone, it's my dream to own a property with acreage. It's one of those things I can enjoy by myself.   Why did you choose Grouse as a starting game animal? What makes it easy?  I only mentioned the rifled barrel because it seems the hunting land nearby my area seems to only allow the taking of deer with a slug. Now, I could and very well may be wrong there. Thanks for taking the time to respond, I appreciate it!"
Hunting,3durbw,jr12345,2,Mon Jul 20 00:03:09 2015 UTC,"I picked grouse due to their easy reputation, and the fact that I wouldn't have to sink a lot of money to get started. I figured if I didn't enjoy the act of hunting, the only bit I would've ventured is the price of my gun, ammo, and hunting license.  Grouse are, from what I read, an easier animal to find. They typically hang out on old abandoned logging roads. I've had my best luck earlier in the morning near a water source. If you're going for ruffed grouse, look for overgrown roads lined with a lot of young alder or vine maple. Blue grouse typically inhabit higher elevations - look for stands of fir trees, berry patches, near water sources. You typically have to put some miles on your boots to find these guys."
Hunting,3durbw,gmil6184,3,Mon Jul 20 17:06:08 2015 UTC,"I applaud your enthusiasm and interest in taking up hunting. Your initial battery of firearms (.22, 30-06 and 12 gauge) are perfect as well. With the correct ammo you can hunt everything in north america with those three. As someone brand new to the sport my advice is to keep it simple at first. There can be a certain amount of paralysis by analysis with all the different gear and choices out there. As far as selecting the correct ammo, go to your local sporting goods store (not Walmart) and go up to the person behind the counter and say ""hey I am looking for deer hunting ammo for a a 30-06 (or whatever)"". The person behind the counter will prob have a few different choices. Just pick one. Don't get too caught up on ballistic charts, and different bullet types (yet). If all else fails look at the box. Is it 30-06 with a picture of a deer on the box? Good to go! You are going pheasant hunting? Find the box of 12 gauge with a pheasant on it. Again, keep it simple. Get yourself a good, sharp knife, some warm clothes (look hard at wool, it works better than most of the synthetic stuff). The type of camo you wear doesn't matter much. I sometimes think camo is more for the hunters than the game. Buy good boots and socks (wool again). I also recommend joining a local rod & gun club. Gives you a great place to shoot and a great way to meet fellow hunters and shooters that you can learn from. Access can be tough but if you look you can almost always find public ground to hunt. But again, keep it simple and just get started."
Hunting,3durbw,heisindc,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"Google local message boards for help. Lots of friendly hunters. The goose community in eastern Maryland is like a family. Local hunting stores can intro you to some people as well.  As for gear, it obviously depends on the hunt. I did use my waterproof gear from Alaska to go goose hunting to stay warm, but it was overkill. Can wear jeans and a camo jacket to goose hunt.  Enjoy learning, taking to seasoned hunters, hearing their hunt stories and then making your own!"

Hunting,3durbw,TrybalRage,2,Mon Jul 20 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"For your rifle you want to use soft-point rounds as they expand and cause more damage when striking a target. Full metal jacket rounds which are typically used at the range for plinking are solid and can go right through your game. For shotgun it depends on what you're hunting, as that comes in different shot size (2, 4, 6, 8 BBB, BB, T, these are all different size bb's in the shell) you can look up what is recommended for what your hunting. For ducks I use 2 and 4, geese i'll use 3 1/2"" T and BB, pheasant and dove I use 6. Also you want to make sure if hunting over water you're not using lead shot. Others things that can affect performance is barrel length, if you're using a silencer or not, how heavy the round is, etc (I love guns, so I can tell you all sorts of different things if your interested in how all this works and changes things.)  For outerwear you'll have to wear blaze orange when hunting deer and pheasant. There's a lot of different choices when it comes to this and it's different between what you're hunting, i'd recommend just going to an outdoors store and asking for help  as they will know what all you need for what you are hunting.  A truck is not a necessity but they are nice to have, as you have the bed for carrying gear and you can throw a deer in it rather than having it in your vehicle.  Always bring food and water, you never know what will happen (stranded, weird weather, etc) so always bring extra. Plenty of warm clothes (socks, long underwear, wearing shoes after a day of boots is a godsend and feels amazing, jackets, gloves, hats both brimmed and something warm).   If you have any other questions feel free to ask! I do a lot of hunting (ducks, geese, pheasant, dove, grouse, squirrel, deer, rabbit, turkey, and going to start on bear)"
Hunting,3durbw,DB2V2,2,Sun Jul 19 18:40:07 2015 UTC,Something to think about instead of a truck - with a wagon OP could get a small trailer to tow along if you were planning on deer hunting.

I'd ask about barrel length but I feel that's more relevant to location as in where you would be hunting?  As for questions: when your hunting deer, pheasant and squirrel, what signs are you usually looking for when looking for? Ex: droppings, tracks etc. Thanks for taking the time to answer!"
Hunting,3durbw,L_cole,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:54:04 2015 UTC,"With pheasant and squirrel I just just go into the field/woods and wait to see them. With pheasant you can sometimes hear them cackle so you may know there are some in the area. You can also find them around gravel roads as they will eat small rocks early in the morning (in MN we can't hunt them before 9am because that's when you see a lot of them on the roads). Your best bet for them is to get a good dog that be able to sniff them out and point/flush them for you.  With deer I always go out and scout where i'm going to be hunting a few weeks ahead of time and just walk the area to look for trails that are being used (lots of hoof prints are a good indicator). I believe baiting for deer is illegal in OR so you may want to look into that, however you maybe able to use attractants such as scents, or mineral blocks, salt licks which can improve your chances. I'll usually try to set up in areas that are close to water as they are running a lot on opening day and its a good bet they'll be working their way to a water source. Also take into account how wind can carry your scent, deer have an excellent sense of smell and can easily pick you up, and their hearing is very well tuned (a broken stick you stepped on is more than enough to spook them off)."
Hunting,3durbw,L_cole,2,Mon Jul 20 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"Well, as far as bullets, you'll get a billion different opinions. You could start by Googling and doing some research on ballistics. Some bullets fly better, some hit better, sometimes it takes some experimentation. As for camo, again, it depends. In my experience any kind of camo that is dark and breaks up your profile will work. Learning how to move s-l-o-w-l-y and smoothly and not move at all are far more important. And your small economy wagon will do just fine. In Central/Eastern Oregon tires are kind of a big deal but other than that you should be good. I live in Southern Oregon and can say Oregon is an awesome state to do it, though.  Edit: For Oregon information ifish.net is pretty handy. Go to the hunting discussion board and lurk. It's typical internet, part delusional lunatic fringe conservative, part idiot hippie, a couple of insane people, but contains a lot of good information."

I hunt because it puts food on my table and it's a good getaway from every day life. There's no better feeling than just going out into the woods and just listening to nature. Take a look at your public hunting areas to go for small game like squirrels if you're interested. Make sure you know the boundaries of the land though. some people get very mad if you hunt on their land and will call a game warden on you. Just talk to people at your local gun shops and bullshit with them for a while. If you get friendly with them then they'll most likely have a world of knowledge to help you out. If you plan on eating what you kill then make sure you know how to properly clean out the entrails of your kill. If you don't do it right then your meat can go rancid and it will be wasted, which is very frowned upon in the hunting community."

I shot a nice buck, and a couple hogs.    You have to make reservations before you can go hunt, and often times the best ranches will be booked very quickly.  You have to be on top planning and calling in to get what you want.    I would look to see how many ranches you live close to.  That was my main issue.  I live in central ca so most ranches were 3 hours plus, with the majority being farther.    It will cost you more than 600 bucks though, but it will allow you multiple opportunities.  I believe the first year is about 2500 bucks, and every year after is 1400.  Overall I would recommend the club, especially for a new hunter.  They will help you out.  with that being said, you will be competing against guys who have been hunting some of those ranches for 20 years.

Hunting,3dwnjh,ruskeeblue,9,Mon Jul 20 03:47:05 2015 UTC,"Your best shot is the heart/lung area. It's a much bigger area than the vitals in the head or spine, and a proper shot will only give the deer a very short time after. To aim for an area that could end up wounding more likely than killing is disrespectful to the animal. Heart and lung is easy and quick."
Hunting,3dwnjh,DownwardSpirals,2,Mon Jul 20 03:58:15 2015 UTC,Yes this.  30-06 is a fine caliber for deer.
Hunting,3dwnjh,SomeTechDude,8,Mon Jul 20 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, a chance for my love of hunting and medical knowledge to intersect. To answer the question of where to best shoot an animal to achieve a quick, humane kill you have to understand what actually causes the animal to die when shot. The answer is lack of oxygenated blood to the brain.   This can be achieved multiple ways. One is a direct hit to the brain. It's hard to oxygenate tissue when it is destroyed by a passing bullet. This is a poor option. The brain is a small target and heavily protected by bone. For the majority of hunting, head shots are not considered optimal and should be passed on for other, more favorable options.   An interruption of the central nervous system, specifically the spine, will cause immediate incapacitation and death will quickly follow. This is also a poor option. The spinal nerve bundles themselves that you need to sever are very small, about the size of your pinky, and are also protected by thick, spinet vertebrae that can easily deflect a bullet. Again, this shot should be passed on.  A bullet through the lungs is an excellent option. This accomplishes a quick death by not only causing massive bleeding and therefore decreased blood pressure, but the damage to the lung tissue itself will not allow oxygen exchange to take place. Not only is there rapidly less and less blood, the blood that is circulating is no longer being oxygenated. A hit to the heart is of course one of the best options, as there will be no oxygenated blood reaching the brain.   The next is a crap shoot. If you don't hit the major blood vessels or spine, you will not cause enough damage to result in a quick kill."
Hunting,3dwnjh,Medic7816,4,Mon Jul 20 04:23:20 2015 UTC,I saw a hunter get lucky and pull a shot at long range which resulted in a spine hit on an elk that turned off the lights. So it is possible... But you are talking about putting he bullet into an inch square along the neck which moves a lot. You don't want to leave an animal maimed. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S2VZSedWb8s
Hunting,3dwnjh,KalimasPinky,3,Mon Jul 20 04:45:58 2015 UTC,There is a spot on the spine that can be hit (or so these hunting TV shows tell me) that kills the nerve connection between the lungs/heart and the brain.  However knowing where that's at is damn near impossible to find.  Go for the vitals.  Hit the heart and that deer will go 3 feet (straight down)
Hunting,3dwnjh,iCkerous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:15:35 2015 UTC,that would be the neck.  The spinal column is that pathway.
Hunting,3dwnjh,lonejeeper,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"The short answer is yes, a solid shot to the neck with either a .30-06 or 300 win mag will drop a deer in its tracks. However a deer's spine is a fairly small target and it runs lower through the neck than most ppl realize. I much prefer the heart/lung shot. It can ruin a little meat (especially with a .300 win mag) but its a much bigger target. Losing a little stew/grind meat from the front shoulder is a small price to pay for insuring a clean, humane kill in my opinion."

Hunting,3dwnjh,Tautuku,2,Tue Jul 21 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"heart/lungs unless you are an absolute crack shot and know where your projectile will impact at any range.

My old boss was a culler in NZ in the 60's and he has shot 1000's of deer with a 22 hornet and makes fun of me for using a 6.5x55 and shooting in the heart/lungs zone."
Hunting,3dwnjh,chop1125,2,Mon Jul 20 07:59:36 2015 UTC,"I would add to the heart/lungs chorus that if the deer is broadside, or quartering slightly away from you, shooting through the heart and lungs and into the opposite shoulder is an excellent way to bring it down quickly.  When I take this shot, the deer normally falls where it stands or runs 50 yards or less."

Between the three of them 1 step was taken, and that deer was running when I shot it.  2 of the deer were heart/lung shots, 1 was a neck shot.  The running deer was about 75 yards out and the other 2 were 120 yards or so.  One of my kids shot one (same load) that turned the heart to mush but it ran 20 yards and collapsed right next to the road.

The 30-06 at 165 grains has a velocity of 2,800 ft/s  and an energy of 2,872 ft·lbf.  The type of bullet will do more for stopping power than velocities.   If you blow through both shoulders with a 30 caliber rifle, the deer will drop right on the spot. Not a great shot on elk, but very effective on deer."

Its that our advantage is not so unnatural compared to wild animals and other predator prey relationships. Critical people's inability to see that hunting is not as simple as point. shoot. Kill"
Hunting,3dwlhe,No_Morals,2,Mon Jul 20 08:35:38 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to understand what you're trying to say. Seems like your thoughts aren't together or maybe you're typing too fast.   our advantage is not so unnatural   I'm guessing you meant our advantage is unnatural.  And it is. As humans, we control and maintain the nature around us and have for a long time. Even when it comes to setting hunting seasons, we keep track of entire populations of animals then decide just how many we'll have to put down this year to control that population. That's why a limited number of tags are given out in most places.  I don't know about how you're hunting, but when I'm up in my stand with my bow, it is as simple as wait...point.shoot.kill.   Just like a cheetah that's stalking a herd of wildabeests. It'll wait...chase.bite.kill.  A cheetah has to know where and how to bite. Just like we need to know where and how to shoot.   Plus, if hunting was any more difficult, it's likely that it'd be a tradeoff where the animal would suffer more. And that's inhumane.   When it comes down to it, what makes hunting natural is adhering to population cycles. When wild animals hunt their prey down to nearly wiping them out, they become harder to find and eventually the predators thin out as well, for lack of nutrition. Then the prey population grows, once again providing meals for the predator population, which subsequently grows as well. And the cycle repeats.  This is how hunting seasons are decided. Hunters are population control. We keep that cycle going. In some places it's out of whack and we actually have slaughtered far too many animals. Wolf populations were in decline, for example. There are a lot of theories on why that's been allowed to happen.  On the other hand there are places where we haven't been able to keep up with prey populations. Deer culling is a practice where huge numbers of deer (often 100+) are killed, sometimes with traps or poison. Poisoned meat isn't even usable. This is because we actually have wiped out the predators in many suburban areas, leaving game populations to grow out of control.  When people are critical of hunting, you should educate them. I hope all this information helps you out with that."
Hunting,3dwlhe,chefandy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:29 2015 UTC,"Most anti hunters just assume all hunters are rednecks mowing down Bambi with machine guns.  They don't realize how acute their sense of hearing and smell are and how much skill and patience is involved.  They never will appreciate it, its best not to even argue."
Hunting,3dwlhe,radiofreejoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:51 2015 UTC,"Not really sure what you're asking here but I'll play ball. The idea that it is simply a slaughter-fest insults both the hunter and the quarry. Predators are not always successful, just like humans. We use rifles, shotguns, and bows that we are confident with not because it is easier but because a clean kill is a more humane kill.   Those that argue that it is unnatural for us to hunt go against our biology and ancestry. Our GI tract and teeth are that of an omnivore, our sight is predatory. Hell even our shoulder anatomy dictates that we have been throwing spears for thousands of years.   I've even been asked by people ""if it's so natural, why not hunt like our ancestors?"" That only circles back to the humane aspect of hunting. And makes you wonder if they would rather you use spears, atlattles, pitfall traps, and buffalo jumps."
Hunting,3dwlhe,g23john,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"There are two main types of non-hunters. There are those who are adamantly against it and think like you mentioned, and then there are those who simply don't hunt but have no hard opinion. Luckily I surround myself with hunters and the people in the second category. All the non-hunters I know are kinda secretly interested in my stories and wish me luck.  I feel like you cannot even begin to debate the adamantly opposed because there is nothing you say that will change their minds. On the other hand, try to seek out people who have never been but aren't necessarily opposed to hunting and take them out and show 'em what it's all about."

Hunting,3dwlhe,one8sevenn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"The reason why wildlife exist and thrive is because of hunters.   90-95% of wildlife funding is from hunters.  Thus funding has restored species like Black Bear, Bighorn Sheep, Whitetail Deer, Snow Geese, Wild Turkeys, etc  Right now, because of the lack of predators - Humans are the Apex predators.   Hunters are managed by a permitting system to ensure herds are near or slightly above the carrying capacity of the habitat. Animals continue to thrive despite the threats from growing, agriculture, residential, & industrial developments.  Without this system in place, wildlife would go be the way side. Without the funding wildlife would be road block rather than a resource. The only other option would be if hunting stopped is to reintroduce more predators. Once, predators lose their fear of man and decide that a two legged species with the max speed of 20mph is easier to catch than a 4 legged species with a max speed 30 mph we will run into problems.   Personally, I have stopped visiting Yellowstone National Park. Because to me those animals are not wild. Those animals are glorified domestic species. To get close enough to snap a picture of an elk in the wild is a challenge worth the price of admission. To drive and see elk feeding on the side of the road to be protected against wolves and grizzlies to me just is not a wild animal.  Humans have hunted longer than they have not hunted. The non-hunting is a relatively new idea and does not have a background in biology. I find it hard to believe that biologists (Studying life) and environmentalists (Studying environments) can't see eye to eye on this issue. Biologists are for the managing the wildlife for a resource and environmentalists are for managing wildlife for the environment. How they do not see eye to eye is beyond me. It might have to do with funding. Biologists are funded by the state and hunting brings revenue to the state. Environmentalists are funded by groups under the non profit designation. Each will have it's own bias based on funding. Though, I believe to the core they should be after the same thing. Preserving and growing wildlife species.   Hunting is currently the best model for the preservation of species. The issue both groups face is habitat loss to agriculture and the development of businesses and industrial. Environmentalists would rather have a fist fight over what they believe is morally wrong, rather than coming up with a feasible solution to manage wildlife without hunting. Biologists are doing their best job to attack the battle on both fronts. It is still a losing battle with the growing populations of humans needing jobs, housing, and food.  The populations can be managed and food can be got, with the current hunting system. It is the best system? I believe it is the best system for the current situation.  The arguments for and against hunting basically come down to both sides really not understanding the issue entirely. Both sides do a poor job at explaining to the other reasons why they hunt or do not hunt.  It is the responsibility of all hunters to try and communicate this to non hunters, because one day the non-hunters will out-number the hunters in the voting ballots. And if we can't explain to them the importance of hunting we will lose the battle. We need to become educated and have adult conversations (not shouting matches or cock measuring contests) with these folks to preserve our legacy.   TL;DR  They don't understand the science behind hunting and we do not know how to communicate the science behind hunting to them."

Hog are the perfect sustainable animal to hunt, for the following reasons:  A hog population, unchecked, will double every 18 months.  Hogs are able to breed at 4 months old, can have up to 2 litters a year, with each litter anywhere from 4 -12 piglets.  They are very social, and run in groups called sounders.  They are not native anywhere in the US (feral hogs anyway, javelinas are another matter)  When they are rooting, it literally looks like a thresher went through. Seriously, on a farm it's hard to tell wether or not the land was plowed or hog came through.  They don't graze like deer, rather they stay and eat until every scrap of food is gone.  They taste incredible!  For the following reasons, I can't stress hog hunting enough. It is always good to thin their numbers (especially in the southern US), and you don't have to worry about wiping them all out (you can't)"

Hunting,3dmifb,IWantToBeAProducer,7,Fri Jul 17 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"i would not get an inflatable kayak - most likely, it'll pop and you'll sink.  i hunt ducks out of my kayak. most of the time, i'll simply use it for transportation, but i do have it rigged for jump shooting. i have a gun mount, a camouflage cover, a milk crate for storage, an anchoring system and some other stuff to allow me to hunt out of it.  jump shooting is very difficult, and also dangerous. i wear my waders in the kayak, making me quite nervous if i were ever to tip in deep water. the trick with jump shooting is leaning into the shot, and setting yourself up for the shot you want - this helps with balance. but the key is stealth - ducks on the water often see/hear/sense you coming before you can even see them. often, i'll find a spot a like (oxbow) and set up a couple dekes here for 10 minutes before moving on.  anyway, its a lot of fun. i recommend giving it a try if you think that your hunting experience could improve."
Hunting,3dmifb,ncleon2010,4,Fri Jul 17 14:14:17 2015 UTC,I think one of the big things for me is that it would open up a lot of territory for me. Wisconsin law (probably the same in other places) is that if you can legally access the water (like a public boat launch) then you can hunt on any navigable water. This means I can access a bunch of hunting spots that just aren't options for me today because I'd have to slog for a mile through a swamp to get there.
Hunting,3dmifb,ncleon2010,2,Fri Jul 17 14:24:14 2015 UTC,"then this is definitely a great option for you.   i devise a hunt plan before i go and usually paddle it once or twice beforehand. even with a headlamp and flashlights, the swamps/river is so much different at 4 AM and in pitch black darkness. very difficult to navigate and easy to get lost.   anyway, we're probably getting ahead of ourselves here. but, it's something to consider.   regardless, if you plan on trying it out, feel free to send over any questions you have about it! i've had good luck so far and i owe a lot of it to making pretty particular plans about it all."
Hunting,3dmifb,ncleon2010,3,Fri Jul 17 14:41:35 2015 UTC,I guess my first question would be what is your check list? What all do you bring?
Hunting,3dmifb,ChopperIndacar,7,Fri Jul 17 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"what i wear   i think good gloves are most important. when you are paddling, your hands get soaked. i like to wear decoy gloves to keep them from getting wet and freezing later. i'll usually wear just a beanie, so my headlamp can get adequate forehead space to work appropriately. i'll bring my baseball hat for later when i want to hide my face from the birds. i then wear normal duck hunting gear. BUT i'll usually put my waders on when i get to my launch point because i have such a long walk in. they're just a bitch to walk in, while towing a kayak. life jacket is a must. i'll wear a life jacket over everything. i have one of those slick fishing life vests so it's not bulky and in the way.   what i bring   if you have a long walk, like i do, i recommend a collapsible kayak cart. if you are going to be dragging it along a trail, i recommend the one with bike tires. i also recommend using winch straps. a kayak filled with everything is heavy and falls off cheap carts/cheap straps easily. i mentioned a headlamp before but this is most critical. its impossible to navigate dark waters without one. i also bring a very, very bright handheld flashlight that i can use if i need more light. decoys! yes, i bring decoys. if i'm jump shooting, i'll bring 3. if i'm headed out to set up in a swamp, i'll bring 6, plus my two mojos in the early season. i have a camo cover i made that fits over my kayak, but does not hit the water. i can paddle with it on, but dont always. if i'm using the kayak as a transport, i'll definitely want to cover/hide the kayak with it. basic hunting supplies - shells, first aid kit, extra hat, gloves, cell phone, batteries, snacks, water, etc. - but what i'll do is put a lot of this in zippies or watertight bags. i do want to have shells easily accessible in the kayak. most of the other stuff i put in my storage crate, which is mounted behind me. shotgun and shotgun leash. last thing i want to do is drop my gun in the bottom of a swamp. with a leash, i wont have to swim after it.    who i tell   tell your float plan to someone. set up contact times as well aka 'if you dont hear from me by 10 AM, call Dominoes bc i wont be home with dinner'"

I have NEVER had an issue with stability when shooting (even with my 3 1/2"" 10g) because it's a very stable boat. You are going to want a stable fishing style kayak for hunting.   That being said, like other have mentioned, it's a little dangerous in general because you don't have a motor, and if something goes wrong with your boat, you might have to walk out of wherever you are hunting. So don't shoot a hole in your kayak!   I love hunting out of my kayak because it's so versatile. I almost always take my kayak when hunting unless I know I will be in a friends blind or something. And if I am not using it out on the water, I can just pull it on to shore and use it like a layout blind.   One of the best advantages to hunting out of a kayak are that you can get to places where other hunters can't, and that is a lifesaver if you are mainly hunting public land.   I will leave you with this, always always always wait and save your money for a better boat. Do NOT buy and emotion or pelican kayak unless you just have to. Stick with the big name brands like Old Town, Wilderness Systems, Diablo (amazing for hunting and fishing), Jackson, Hobie, Native, Nucanoe, and maybe a field and stream. You really do get what you pay for with kayaks. And always look around for a used option on Craig's list. I got mine for $550 used from there."

Hunting,3dl6l7,hobitopia,7,Fri Jul 17 13:07:16 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend doing this, if you plan to age the meat in any real way, as this method will make the muscle fibers in the meat seperate and create airbubbles which will make the surrounding tissue suspectible to spoilage.

Hunting,3dl6l7,well_here_I_am,3,Fri Jul 17 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, most (or at least quite many) such places, when pulling the hides off the carcasses will have someone standing with a knife helping loosening the hide a bit here and there, as well as having a much more controlled pulling force, instead of just using sheer brute force. That little thing, as well as exactly how well controlled the environment, the aging process takes place in will make the difference.   Just to be clear, the environment we age all our meat in, is dependent on the weather and not a large temperature controlled room. And has worked for about 1000+ years without any real problems, introduce the brute force pulling thing and previous mentioned airpockets started to appear and being a big factor in loss of meat.  Also the first comment could have been worded a bit better, as it isn't a guarantee that said air bubbles/spaces will do any damage, far from it, but it is pretty much guaranteed that they will appear when doing the pulley thingy."
Hunting,3dl6l7,Hitno,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"when pulling the hides off the carcasses will have someone standing with a knife helping loosening the hide a bit here and there,   Well couldn't we assume that most hunters would quickly learn to do the same to avoid tearing the hide, or the deer itself?  I mean you have to make opening incisions to get this to work.  That in itself will relieve some of the pressure.  The second issue is how hot the carcass is when you do this.  If you let your deer sit over-nite and try this it will be much harder.  I mean, we pull hides on the vast majority of deer that we process and we age them in a walk-in cooler, and I've never seen any evidence of increased rancidity, despite being rougher than large plants are.    introduce the brute force pulling thing and previous mentioned airpockets started to appear and being a big factor in loss of meat... it is pretty much guaranteed that they will appear when doing the pulley thingy.

Sorry don't have any written sources on it, just a lot of anecdotes on the subject from people here, as well as seeing it happen in our own larder.

Hunting,3dl6l7,Hitno,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"Well in the video you have a hot sheep.  You could pull a hot sheep skin by hand if you wanted to.  I've been in the largest beef packing plant in the US and they pulled them rather roughly.  Beef hides really hold on tight.  I would guess you'd need several tons of force to get them to peel off.  They also use air to separate the hide from the skin in some areas like around the head, and I've never heard of any air pockets resulting from that. The compressed air method actually would allow for not making any opening cuts, and I know lots of fur hunters and trappers do that.   And don't think that I'm trying to come off as confrontational.  I'm a meat scientist and I had never heard of anything like that before.  If you ever do find a study on it I'd love to see it."
Hunting,3dl6l7,well_here_I_am,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I don't think you come off as confrontational.  As I said it might be highly anecdotal, and/or a result of the method together with our way of long time aging (up to a year) in an not entirely stable environment that can cause spoiling from the inside. Also when the meat gets dehydrated (from long time hanging) and cut into slices it is quite visible that the meat fibers have been pulled apart, if the carcass has been skinned too brutally.   To skin a sheep the traditional way here, is to have the carcass on a table, and then insert the hand between the skin and the meat, and then move the hand around til the skin comes free, like illustrated here by a small boy http://i.imgur.com/CmivaNX.jpg   I'll bear that in mind, and I've tagged you for future reference should I come across any study on it.  I guess I might be a bit ""over protective"" when recommending others not to use the golf cart method, but there it is, I'm just talking from experience here. And all farmers here and others who are involved with sheep raising and slaughtering have gone from the brute force approach to something gentler (like in the vid) cause it did cause damage to the meat in the ways I've described."

Alternatively, the shock on the fibers might have a tenderizing effect...  Too many questions.  What I do know is that when we've pulled hides on deer the bigger issue is when you have massive tissue damage far back it's entirely too easy to rip your deer in half."

I'm in WA and you have to call into the first open police station and get a temporary permit. You should be able to get the form for the first state as long you leave and enter in the same one. If you do it at a country station chances are the coppers will be easier going. How long are you in OZ for?

Hunting,3dpcqk,Narwhalbaconguy,10,Sat Jul 18 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"Number one, you need a license, and you have to got through hunter education class before you can buy one.  So go to the www.pgc.state.pa.us for times and locations around your area.  Secondly, and after going through the HTE course, you will be aware or the Pennsylvania Hunting and Trapping Digest.  In there is all the information you need to know about hunting laws and seasons in PA. According page 48 of the newest, PaHTD,    ... Single-projectile ammunition, or fine shot pellets no larger than No. 4 lead,, bismuth-tin, or tungsten - iron or other approved non-toxic shot, or No. 2 steel.   So yes you can, but you CANNOT just walk I to the woods and start trying to shot squirrels with a sling shot.  You have to be a licensed hunter in PA, and you must follow all the laws that govern hunting in our great state."

Hunting,3dpcqk,hobowithashotgun2990,11,Sat Jul 18 06:03:21 2015 UTC,Personally I don't think you should go hunting like that. You're probably getting lots of wounded animals that you can't track down and die miserable because of a broken bone or something like that. As I hear weapons aren't that expensive in the states so you should be able to save the money for a bow or a cheap gun. I can get a compound bow for 150€ here in Germany and I heard of full hunting sets with bow and arrow for around 100$ being available in Canada.

Hunting,3djqr2,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:57:44 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. I get asked all the time. The reason is that when I bought the rifle I wanted to get something to hunt with and also get into long distance shooting. Somewhere around 600 yards. So yes! Your right on both ends. It is a lot. One thing I have learned hunting with  it, however, is that if you don't hit any bones the bullet pretty much goes trainer through. Due to the high velocity it almost seems to not even slow down. I always aim right behind the shoulder and the exit wound/internal damage is never that bad if I get a heart shot and no bones. I imagine if no were to hit shoulder it would be pretty bad though."

Hunting,3djqr2,Medic7816,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"Budget is going to play a huge part in which rifle, but let's discuss the manufacturers. Remington. Ever since Remington was bought out by freedom group, their quality control has gone to nothing. Finished look horrible, actions are gritty, the weapons rust very quickly. The 700 action is phenomenal and it is easily the most supported in aftermarket accessories. However, as much as I love my 700s, I can not recommend them because the quality just isn't there.   Savage. The savage 10 series are great rifles. Very strong and user serviceable. You can swap barrels and calibers in your garage in one night with no special tools. Accu-trigger is nice, but it's no Jewell or Timiney. Overall, a very good return on your money.   Tikka. Tikka is the lower cost version of Sako rifles built in Finland. The Fins know how to build a rifle. Some of the non pressure bearing parts are plastic where in the Sakos they are metal, but this does not affect the functionality of the weapon. All models have detachable box magazines and multiple finishes to choose from. The triggers are user adjustable down to 2lbs and in my opinion are better than the Savage accu-trigger. Overall a very high quality weapon.   Ruger M77. A weapon that I think gets over looked more than it should. Ruger had been churning out quality weapons for a long time. Not amazing in any particular capacity, but gets the job done all day long. They do have proprietary scope rings which can be a hassle, but once you have them they seem to work very well.   Winchester. No.   I think that's most of the most common bolt actions. It seems currently that the savages and tikka's are your best return on your money, and I personally like the way the Tikka shoots. If you give a budget and the type of game and distance hunted, that will help narrow down which rifle of a particular brand."

Hunting,3djqr2,tsw101,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"With the price point that you have stated, I would give the Tikka a good long look. The cheaper rifles like the Savage axis, Remington 783, and Ruger American series are good shooting guns, but they are entry level guns. It sounds like you have a family tradition going, and a nicer gun is really worth the money. They have nice wooden stocks, crisp adjustable triggers, decent aftermarket support, and are promised to shoot 1 MOA from the factory. I would look at this model since it will be topped with a scope."
Hunting,3djqr2,3fingerapache,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"Well thanks again. You are correct, my Remington was my dad's when he used to hunt more. He gave it to me and bought his left handed Sako from a friend. He used to handload, and we've talked a lot about getting back into it, so it only makes sense for all 3 of us to have the same bullet."
Hunting,3djqr2,3fingerapache,2,Thu Jul 16 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"For the best accuracy, you keep a set of dies set for each rifle, or reset them (which is a pain in the ass).  BUT, that's getting really, really anal.  Like weigh all your componants anal.  It's why between my dad, brother, and I, we only have two rifles that are the same caliber.  One we haven't even shot yet and it's been about 3 years since my dad bought it.  Lots of dies though.  My brother and I only reload when we visit home and use my dad's stuff.  Neither of us have lived in a place where we can set up a nice bench.  We're both getting close though."
Hunting,3djqr2,warnef,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:15:15 2015 UTC,"Winchester. No. ?? I bought a brand new model 70 in 30-06 and it's amazing. I played with a Model 700, Tikka T3 and the Winchester felt better, looked better, and had a way smoother and crisper action. No idea why you'd say no to a Winchester."
Hunting,3djqr2,baseacegoku,2,Thu Jul 16 21:59:23 2015 UTC,Because I am on my phone and thinking faster than I can type. I was typing Winchester and thinking mossberg. Winchester and browning both also make decent bolt actions. Mossberg had not impressed me.

Hunting,3dfrfh,thatchiveguy,14,Thu Jul 16 02:16:59 2015 UTC,Did it for a couple years. Got tired of not being where the birds wanted to land. Never had trouble shooting out of one. Kinda limited by the amount of gear you can bring along. Would just carabiner a dozen texas rigs and tow them behind me. Drag became a little much with more decoys. Heres a few pics from years back

Hunting,3dfrfh,IWantToBeAProducer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:24:56 2015 UTC,I have hunted out of kayaks for 2 years now. I disagree to your statement of not being able to go where the birds are.   On the other hand i don't like the limited area that one cab shoot a gun effectively in a kayak. Stading up in a blind is much easier.
Hunting,3dfrfh,smow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:20:31 2015 UTC,"Think you misunderstood. I bought it so I could get to where the birds wanted to land. Shooting from a blind is about as ideal as it can get, but I don't have a blind. Usually set up such that the birds decoyed are in the 10-2 range. Never had stability issues shooting at 9 or 3o'clock either. My sit on top was much easier to shoot out of than my buddy's sit in"
Hunting,3dfrfh,QuackAddict,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:33:00 2015 UTC,I see. Yea my sit in is pretty hard to shoot in. 9 to 1 oclock

Hunting,3dfrfh,D0nK3yd0Ng,6,Thu Jul 16 11:18:45 2015 UTC,"Hunting from a kayak is good for jump shooting, poor for pass shooting. There's a handful of guys doing jump shooting on rivers using canoes and kayaks in videos on YouTube. My personal experience was with pass shooting, hard to get a smooth follow through and the recoil would push me backwards.   Edit: that being said I'm still damn jealous of your mighty fine rack.... gun rack. Oh, and hanging your feet out into the water will help keep the yak stable when you swing the gun."
Hunting,3dfrfh,Against-The-Grain,2,Thu Jul 16 02:39:32 2015 UTC,you really just have to pull the yak up against a bank to pass shoot.
Hunting,3dfrfh,D0nK3yd0Ng,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:25:20 2015 UTC,"I would've loved to have done that, but one of my local spots was flooded about fifteen feet at it's deepest. So the bank was in a ranchers field, less than 50ft. from his back porch or right next to his cattle. Sometimes you have to make do with what you got :)"
Hunting,3dfrfh,uglymud,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:11:58 2015 UTC,That's why you don't pass shoot. You set decoys and shoot them when they're cupped up.

Any floatable body of water is open to the public and those geese and ducks are corn fed gleaners on the estate's farm.  Cant get much better than that.  Just keep your eyes trained way down river for any movement on the water, then stick to that bank to sneak up and jump them.  Half will fly away from you down river for another possible chance, others will panic upstream and those are yours.  Taken  many a canada goose, mallard and wood duck off there.

Thinking about just getting some vinyl stickers made to look like ASAT camo.  I deer hunt with an ASAT suit and it works great for breaking you up.  What do you suggest?
Hunting,3dfrfh,UllrRllr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"Well in my opinion, natural foliage always works best for hunting. I got a big sheet of canvas, cut out and stapled it so that it would hug around my kayak snuggly. Then I attached some 3D camo netting and stapled that on top of the canvas, and then I painted it all in a camo scheme. This lets me throw some grass and foliage on top of my kayak all around me, and then I just use small zip ties to secure the grass onto the canvas through the camo netting. It works pretty well and was very cheap to make. I'm on vacation in Hawaii, other wise I would post some pictures. I'll post some pictures of my kayak setup to the sub when I get back home though."

Hunting,3di3m5,clubandfang,2,Thu Jul 16 13:27:08 2015 UTC,"simplest advice - get a soil test done (for free by state ag department). in the meantime, and weather permitting, spray to kill any and all weeds. clear the ground if doing no till. then, again be wary of the weather, fertilize the ground in accordance to the ag recommendations.   lastly, plant your seeds. you can spray cast the seeds but i'd go over them with some type of seed roller/presser to ensure good soil contact. this is often an underestimated part of the process."
Hunting,3di3m5,ncleon2010,2,Thu Jul 16 13:46:21 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical of ""no-till"" advertisement claims. It doesn't make sense. Without scratching up the ground somehow, birds and rodents will eat the seed and rain will wash it away.  But then I'm a farmer with really bad soil.  It might work better in areas with good soils.  We've tried a wide variety of food plots but Dutch white clover has been most successful for us.  It will grow in any soil and once established its tenacious. Everything uses our clover plots-bear, hog, deer, turkey, and it doesn't have to be replanted but about every 3-5 years.  We do mow our clover plots every chance we get to keep higher growing vegetation from crowding it out."

Hunting,3dgmfp,ftrkngfspn,2,Thu Jul 16 02:54:34 2015 UTC,"Ethical shots are to the heart or lungs.  While headshots will dispatch the animal, you have a smaller target to hit.  Inexperienced shooters should not try this in fear of only harming the animal.  Hog meat is tougher than most but can taste pretty good with marinades.  Why hunt if you don't want the meat?  Either way - don't let the animal go to waste.  Look into ways of donating the meat."
Hunting,3dgmfp,iCkerous,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:43:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this in-depth answer. I learned a lot from you and the others who replied.   To answer your question, I would only not hunt for meat when it's to help curb an invasive species. And I hear that hogs are quite destructive. I live in Downtown Riverside, CA, where feral animals are non existent so I have no experience with pest animals or hunting.  I will definitely look for ways to donate the meat if I ever decide not to eat it myself.   As I stated, I'm a novice who is barely getting into hunting, and these are just theoretical/basic questions so I can gain more insight into this sport."
Hunting,3dgmfp,saysomething234,2,Thu Jul 16 17:49:48 2015 UTC,"most states allow you to donate meat, EG in Georgia there's Hunters for the Homeless. Your butcher will know about these. As a rule of thumb though, all sows are great to eat, and any boar under 200lbs is OK too.  Edit: I always try to shoot for the head to preserve as much meat as possible, but I eat everything I kill. A heart/lung will drop them just as quick though.  As far as stalking, you can pretty much walk right up on pigs if you're downwind of them. If they're feeding, their heads will be down, and they make a ton of noise. Move when they move, stop when they stop, and you can get right in there. The only thing they have going for them is an incredible sense of smell, so stay downwind and don't use bugspray."

Hunting,3dgmfp,dar5252,2,Tue Jul 21 05:39:45 2015 UTC,"Boars have a musky smell that gets into the meat, and during the summer they have worms.  So I'm not sure I'd eat one either, especially if it's a big one.  Pigs under 125 lbs are the best for eating.  Pigs are pests, so you're not going to have to follow any guidelines for disposal.  I would suggest maybe burning them, or leave them out and hunt some yotes over them."

We hunt mostly for eradication, the boars we leave, there are plenty of things that will feast on them in the woods.  It's not a problem here in AL to leave a hog, and I'd never do that with another animal, but hogs are to be eradicated!  Check with your DCNR and the land owner.  The sows less than knee high we dress and take home.  We spit roasted one last year and it was awesome.  Take some surgical gloves with you and wear them when you're cutting on your hog, sometimes they have stuff you don't want to get into your blood stream (cooking kills it though).  Ice the dressed pig down as soon as possible.  If you ask, I'll put a link to our Hog hunt/BBQ, but I don't want to look like a spammer."

Hunting,3dg480,StupidHumanSuit,3,Thu Jul 16 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"I have my deer processed by a professional. I drop off a dressed dear and pick up nearly packed and processed cuts of meat. I would prefer to do it myself, but I don't have the time, expertise, nor space. Small game can be processed in an apartment no problem, or can be done on site in the woods and transported home in a cooler. If you do your own, I recommend reading some books or other research first. Nothing ruins a proud, rustic wild game dinner like bad taste and chomping on shot."
Hunting,3dg480,Medic7816,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:00:22 2015 UTC,"I hunt on my grandfather's land and process everything there. I suppose that parallels your processing at camp. Everything from gutting to packing, we do it there. Back when I was a little boy and went hunting with my dad, we would field dress it where we were then take it to a butcher to have it processed. It costs us less than buying beef at a store, so it worked out. I do know that some butcher shops, if you're having hamburger or sausage made, will blend your meat with another's so they can do it in large batches... and you just get part of that batch. We avoid shops that do this, as you have no idea where that other meat came from."

An electric meat grinder comes in handy.

If your state has regulations concerning entrails on public land learn them, if predators are a concern in your area be very wary while dressing it out, and find some other hunters in your area/neighborhood/work, learn from them.

EVERYBODY at a rifle range will help you with your rifle skills, it makes us feel manly when we can help someone shoot better.  Tell people at the range what you're doing and you may get an offer.  Last year a friend of my son's asked if he could hunt with us.  Had he not asked we wouldn't have thought about inviting him, as it turns out he had a great time and he and I hunted together more than I did with anyone else.  Then one more kid asked about going but the season was about done, I'll get him to the range a few times this year before the season.  You also may want to take a guided hunting trip.  I grew up hunting, but a few years ago started hunting hogs which I'd never hunted.  I read a lot, but the day I spent with the guide was worth every penny."

There should be some good public hunts in Maine and by going to a few you will meet a lot of other hunters and see some action.  Look for child/parent, lady hunts, or quota hunts in the regs.  There may be some good ones like pre-gun season rifle hunts in prime public land. That's how my state does it anyway.  If you get a mentor or few, you'll learn exponentially faster than on your own."
Hunting,3ddzzi,yeahozkiller,4,Wed Jul 15 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, for hunting in Michigan there are few things to consider when buying your boots. The two main ones are what is your budget, and what type of hunting are you going to do. I personally have three different boots depending on the type of hunting I am going to be doing. One is a pair of  zipper side rockies that has no insulation. This is my early season/small game boot. Anytime that I am going to be doing a lot of walking, I don't want any insulation. If you go walking with lots of Thinsulate, your feet are going to sweat, and then get cold. Overheating your feet leads to cold feet.   Thinsulate is measured in grams. My mid season boots are 200 gram thinsulate. This is for October archery hunting, late season small game, or stalking during deer season. They are light, but are not particularly warmer than your average shoe. For my main deer hunting boots i have a pair of 2000 gram thinsulate. They are big, bulky and heavy. But they are warm. Warm feet is essential to staying in the blind. Nothing makes hunting more miserable than cold feet.  If your budget only allows for one pair of boots, I would urge you to buy lightly insulated boots. Somewhere in the 200-400 gram thinsulate range. There are options to add insulation, like this, but you can never take way insulation.   The first thing that you should do before you try on the boots that you want is buy dedicated hunting socks. Don't go hunting your hanes white socks. Have some wool hunting socks, and wear those when you try your boots on to ensure that you have a good fit. Too loose of a boot and your foot will slide around and give you blisters. Too tight and you loose insulating capabilities.   Any quality hunting boot is going to be waterproof, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. One thing you might want to look for is the ability to be resoled. A good pair of hunting boots are a great find, and resoling them will let you keep a pair that works for you for many seasons."

Also I think hunting is something you should enjoy personally, of course you can tell your friends and family the great experiences you make but I don't think this should become an online thing.

As long as you don't present it as a bunch of rednecks drinking beer in the woods and mowing down Bambi with machine guns, you can have a positive impact on the sport.

Hunting,3de535,chefandy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:10:38 2015 UTC,"Blogging can be a fun hobby and its pretty easy to start.  I tried a food blog for a bit (I'm a chef in real life) and thought I had a unique viewpoint.    For me, balancing VERY long work hours with a family and small kids PLUS new hobby that felt more and more like work everyday wasn't worth it.  If you have the free time, it could be very rewarding, but you need to realize unless you're half-assing it, you won't have much free time.    It sounds like you're already a writer, which is the most important part.  Having a voice or a message that people want to read is what will make or break you and ultimately determine how many visits you'll get.     If I were to start over and do it again, I'd create a YouTube channel and have a video about whatever I was talking about.  If you were writing about the importance of cleaning and maintaining your rifle, you could create a short video detailing how to properly clean a rifle.    The video will drive youtube traffic to your site, and your site will drive traffic to your channel.  This will be increasingly important if you decide to monetize your blog (I.e. put up ads and/or referral links, YouTube also pays a % of ad revenue based on traffic).    Having both will also enable you to negotiate more free products from your sponsors and will open up new doors.   You'll be able to write off a lot of your hunting stuff as a business expense, and if you become popular, you might get some free gear and/or trophy hunting trips.      I'm super tired, hopefully this made sense.  I'd you have any questions, you can pm me and I can show you a few things."

Plus the fact that hunting in full camo and taking a shot on an animal within 30 yards is much more of a skill/thrill/sport/accomplishment/something to be proud of than shooting a deer at 150 yards with a high powered rifle resting on a shooting stick sitting in an open field where the deer may not even fear your presence."

For the closed end, cut it so you have wires poking out that you can wrap around the sides to hold it closed. When you're done, you should have a rectangular box with an open end.  Cut a square of hardware cloth with three smooth sides and one side with wires poking out to be the ""door"" and attach it a few squares from the front of the box so it can swing up toward the top (inside) of the box. Put weights on what will be the bottom half of the door. Bend the front bottom/sides up/in a little so it can't swing too far, and make sure you've got a loop or something coming up from near the bottom of the door that pokes up through the roof of the box.   Almost done! Now for the trap part of the trap. Attach the mousetrap to the top of the box so the catch faces the closed end and the bar that holds down the hammer is toward the door end.  Tie one string to the catch and drop it through the roof of the box so it's hanging down into the back of the box. This is what you'll attach your bait to, and the string should be short enough that the bait is suspended in the air.  Tie another string to the hammer of the mousetrap. Tie the nail/stick to the other end and make sure the string is just long enough for the nail/stick to hold up the trap door when the mousetrap is armed. This will pull out the nail and drop the door when the mousetrap goes off.  It might take some fine tuning and testing before it's ready to use, of course, but I know it works from experience."

Hunting,3dbb8s,hobowithashotgun2990,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"Normally we have shoots where we'll either have Pheasants, English Partridge or French Partridge. On shoots we'll mainly have one of these birds or maybe a mixture.   What happens is you have 8 guns, they meet up and pick a post number (usually done by random, like a number in a hat or along the lines of that) and these posts are in a line of 8 in a field near a woods or some over growth where the birds will hide.  The guns normally have one or two dogs with them who are set out to retrieve the birds on the field.  Then you get people called 'bush beaters' who through the woods and over growth with a stick with a brightly coloured flag on it. Their job is to scare the birds into flying away into the direction of the guns.  Then at the back you have someone picking up, who normally has a few dogs. Their job is to use the dogs to collect the birds who have been shot by the guns but were only wounded and maybe flew for a little longer.  I'm not very good at describing it but here's the wikipedia section which goes explains it a bit better.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_and_shooting_in_the_United_Kingdom#Shooting"

As far as entry, the arrow definitely went thru that hog's lungs and maybe heart when it entered.  The human eye has a tendency to follow the bright coloured fletch but the tip of the arrow entered significantly lower because of trajectory coming down from the stand.

Needing a good hunting dog, he visits a farmer who has been advertising hounds in the newspaper. The farmer shows him several dogs, but the guy doesn't like them. Then he spots one hound that the farmer hasn't shown him. The guys asks, ""What about that one?"" ""Oh, no,"" the farmer replies. ""That one's my special dog."" ""What's so special about him?"" ""Let me show you.""  The farmer leads the guy and the dog to a field, lifts up one of the dog's ears, and orders, ""Go find the birds!"" The dog charges to a nearby bush, points and barks once. ""That means there's one bird in that bush,"" says the farmer. ""No way!"" exclaims the guy. The farmer takes a stick and pokes the bush, and a huge pheasant flies out.  To further convince the guy, the farmer again lifts the dog's ear and repeats, ""Go find the birds!"" This time the dog streaks off to another bush, points, and barks twice. ""That means there's two birds in there,"" says the farmer, taking his stick and poking at the bush. Two huge pheasants pop out and fly away.  ""I've gotta have that dog!"" says the man. ""Well, okay,"" replies the farmer. ""But it's gonna cost you a bundle."" The guy forks over the bucks and takes the dog.  A month later, the farmer has to go to the city, and decides to visit the guy who bough his prize hound. When he asked the guy about the dog, the man replies, ""A couple of buddies and I went hunting, and when we got to a field the damnedest thing happened. I went up to the dog, lifted one of his ears, and said 'Go find the birds.' The dog took off like a bat outta hell and ran into the field, barking and running around like crazy. Then he jumped on my leg and started humping it like I was a bitch in heat. After that, he grabbed a stick and started shaking it violently at me! I thought he'd gone nuts for sure, or maybe had rabies or something. So I shot the fucker.""  ""You blithering idiot!"" yelled the farmer.

Hunting,3d5hhy,terraspatial,3,Mon Jul 13 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"Her gait seems slightly off, but she has purposefull movement of her ears and tail, and doesn't seem to have trouble ambulating. Granted, I have never seen a rabid deer, but the other rabid animals I have seen were not able to walk, let alone that well. Could be early CWD, or it could be a doe watchful over her fawns. I have to figure that taking take of two fawns would strain and exhaust the mother. Nothing I saw in the video gave me immediate cause for concern, but you watched her for two hours and I watched her for two minutes."
Hunting,3d5hhy,gobbler87,3,Mon Jul 13 19:05:14 2015 UTC,"The deer looks pretty healthy. She looks nervous likes she's uncomfortable with something around her but to do that for 2 hours is weird.  The way she's walking it looks like she's about to stomp an alert.  Wonder if something wasn't after those fawns and she was trying to protect them by bringing them in your yard where maybe yotes or bear wouldn't follow her and she got pinned down in there with them.  In other words, you were less of a threat to her than whatever was after her and those fawns. If that was so, whatever it was it was hanging around close by and keeping her nervous."
Hunting,3d5hhy,Corpsman223,2,Mon Jul 13 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"The deer could be sick, but it doesn't necessarily mean CWD or rabies. In my area some deer will get ill from being poisoned by lawn care chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, etc). If local herds have access to suburban lawns this could be a possible alternative source of sickness.  From my experience in observing deer behavior, watching just what's in the video doesn't raise any immediate alarms as to their behavior. She seems very alert and cautious and the circling is a bit unusual, but she doesn't actually strike me as sick. Granted it's only a minute and a half long and you're saying she did it for two hours, but just from watching, it doesn't look alarmingly unusual."
Hunting,3d5hhy,gobbler87,0,Mon Jul 13 21:16:33 2015 UTC,"I noticed in your YouTube comments that you mentioned putting feed out for the deer. I'm not sure where you live, but in some areas it is illegal to put food out for deer for any reason, mostly because it is considered baiting, but also to prevent disease spread. I would be extremely cautious, especially living within 100 miles from confirmed CWD. Concentrating animals at a food source is one of the theories in how CWD spreads.  I would check your local regulations before putting out anymore food for them. I've seen people get busted for hunting near where their neighbors were feeding deer. They had no clue the neighbors were feeding, but they were ticketed for hunting with bait."

Also, are you not allowed to take deer / game on your own land in the US? I always thought the US was rather progressive when it came to hunting matters.  Sure, on public land the  government should be free to make up whatever artificial bag limits they want; but surely if it's during the open season and you're on your own/private land you can take as many deer as you like?  For reference, in the UK there are no bag limits and it's up to individual landowners to use experience & common-sense to determine the levels of wildlife management necessary on their own property. You only need to apply for a permit in order to shoot deer at night or during the closed season."
Hunting,3d4c1o,DEADB33F,5,Mon Jul 13 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"but surely if it's during the open season and you're on your own/private land you can take as many deer as you like?   No, because that's not how conservation works. Deer don't abide by fences. They roam. So if you had like 8 adjoining properties with different owners, and 7 of the 8 owners were harvesting responsibly in a sustainable way, and 1 owner who just baited in and killed all the deer it could, that 1 owner would ruin the deer population for all 8. It's similar to why you aren't allowed to dam up a creek on your property to stop the flow of water to nearby properties.    it's up to individual landowners to use experience & common-sense   We quit counting on common-sense in the States a long time ago. It is forsaken here."
Hunting,3d4c1o,emperorOfTheUniverse,3,Mon Jul 13 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's even not letting people use common sense, it's just that maybe most folks don't know much about wildlife management and conservation.

Hunting,3d4c1o,c-9,3,Mon Jul 13 14:45:46 2015 UTC,"The limits apply on all land, public and private.

The bad news is that between clinton and Igham counties they have found chronic wasting in a wild deer. The good news is that they have set up a special hunting zone where they want to kill ALL the deer in that area to prevent spreading. There are no license limits. Being that you are archery hunting, you'll get the first crack at them. Contact the DNR, I'm sure that they can point you in the right direction. Clinton county also has an early antlerless deer season, Sept 19-20 so you can get some early hunting in too. There are certain special rules for that, so check the rule book. Thats a little east of my area of hunting, so I can't tell you for sure what specific areas are good, but michigan has a lot of public land to hunt. Deer kill numbers were down the last few years, but that seemed to be a lot weather related so it shouldn't effect you as much in the warmer archery season. It is currently approaching the application period if you want a shot a public land antlerless deer tag. The application period is from July 15-Aug 15, so don't wait too long.

Hunting,3d2x2x,notsoeasyrider,2,Mon Jul 13 06:19:26 2015 UTC,This happened on a rifle range at Fort Dix when I was deploying. I've never seen a cease fire called so quickly on an army range. That range master knew what would become of those poor deer if 50 18-year-olds with M4s had any say in it.
Hunting,3d13ab,DeeDee_78,9,Sun Jul 12 17:21:20 2015 UTC,"I'm still working on this myself.  Get a county map that'll show you who own's each quarter section and target areas with good hunting opportunities and enough land to make it worthwhile.  Sometimes it's a bit of a goose chase to get a hold of the owner if they own a lot of land or they've parceled out a bunch of acreages across their land.  It's a cold conversation when they don't know you and you're asking to use their property.  Keep on going back each year even if they say no (assuming they aren't crazy/angry people).  They'll usually remember you and it'll be a friendlier conversation next time.  Start asking for permission early (>2 months before the season) or often they'll have already given permission to someone else.    Whenever I ask for permission I hand them my ""hunting resume"".  In this resume I give all of my contact information, a business card, and some background information on who I am.  For example: I was raised in this city/state/province, I've been hunting for X years, I'm a responsible and ethical hunter, I have personal liability insurance, I'll follow your rules, I drive this type/colour of truck with this license plate, I'd volunteer to help out on their land (sweat equity), etc..    Even if they say no, once in a while I've gotten a call back later and received permission after they thought it over and reviewed the resume.  Often I've seen a bias against ""city-folk"".  If you're from a small town, great, emphasize that and leverage your rural connections.  If you are from a bigger city, don't bring it up and talk more about where else you've hunted or how you were always out at your extended family's farm, or whatever."
Hunting,3d13ab,markusbrainus,5,Sun Jul 12 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how to go about it. Many farmers I've talked to their main complaint is hunters cutting fences to get through. Offer to help fix the fences. As /u/markusbrainus said, sweat equity can go a long way.  Once you get permission work on keep the relationship in good shape. Stop by when you are out hunting to let them know you're out there and if you're hunting with someone be sure to introduce them. Don't assume because you have permission that you can bring whoever you want along with you. Do not allow any of your hunting buddies to hunt there without you. That's a sure fire way to get permission revoked."
Hunting,3d13ab,k3rnelpanic,2,Sun Jul 12 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"To piggy back, bring a simple gift when you ask. Someone else in this thread said cookies and thats a good idea. Use pinterest or similar website to come up with simple and easy gift ideas. After the hunt offer them some of the choice meat from your kill. Home owners (especially other larg land owners) speak with one and another. You want to set a good impression even if they tell you no. Good luck."

I don't hunt what I call varmints. (Coon, Coyote, etc.) I do have 2 guys that do however. I tell em its all good as long as they leave the land as they found it or better. I also tell them to help me track the deer movements, as I am a avid deer hunter. It's win win. I get more knowledge without having to spend hours out there. They get the pelts etc they want. I get rid of varmints."
Hunting,3d13ab,GDogg007,5,Mon Jul 13 20:38:45 2015 UTC,Offer to help fix fence line or to maintain posted property signs.

Always abide by their wishes, if they don't want you in a certain part of their land then by god don't go on that land. If you get a deer or whatever animal you are hunting offer some of the meat to them, we gave our landowner some deer sausage and he really appreciated it.

Hunting,3d13ab,prokony,2,Sun Jul 12 18:43:48 2015 UTC,"1. Don't roll up to the door looking like rambo 2. Pick the right time of day, not right in the middle of meal time. 3. Ask first could you spare me a few minutes of your time, as at times farmers are very busy, and nothing turns them off quicker than you standing there wanting to have a great yarn & they are flat out. 4. When driving up to his house DON'T roll right up to the door like you own the place, stop back a bit but IN FULL view, so he gets a bit of a look at you before you get to the door. 5. A bit of small talk can help to break the ice, weather, lamb prices, hows the grass growing etc. 6. If you get a yes to have a shot, make sure you get permission for a mate as well if you are planing on taking one, also find out where he DOESN'T want you to go. 7. Get a clear picture on what pests he wishes you to shoot, and whats not a target, as each farmer will have a different wish. 8. If you damage something, you can't turn back the clock, what you do from that point on is what matters, so do the right thing & front up, the damage WON'T go unnoticed. 9. I find, if you aren't going to let the neighbors know you are next door shooting, STAY well away from the boundarys. Best not to upset them  because if they ring the farmer complaining, hes not going to fall out with them, hes going to rag your ass. 10. Find out generally whats happening on farms around that area at that time of the year, rolling up asking to go shooting after lambing, right in the middle of lambing, just isn't a great idea, hes flat out & he will just not be very interested in thinking about you & your wishes. 11. Stay well away from any farm buildings or sheds, farmers hate to see people hanging or poking about their sheds . 12. I do from time to time drop a box of beers or a nice bottle of whiskey, or a leg of veni off to the stations I go hunting on, its only a small thing, but it lets the farmer know that I'm very happy to be able to enjoy his place.  13. If all else fails head to the local pub and chat up the bloke who looks like his old man has a farm."

Hunting,3d13ab,iwouldrun500miles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:07:28 2015 UTC,"Here's what I have done, with some success.  I do my scouting online, then either get a plat book or find the landowner's info online to get their address. Then I type up a letter and briefly introduce myself, saying who I am, where I'm from, etc.  I mention that I'm looking for a place to hunt, and in my research I came across their name/property. Right then I'll give them an immediate out, and say something like ""if you're not interested in letting me hunt on your property, you can stop reading right now - I totally understand and respect your decision!""  I will then go on to thank them for continuing to read/hear me out, and let them know that I appreciate the time they're giving me. I'll explain that I'm a big believer in respecting someone else's property, practicing good hunting ethics, taking care of the land, and of course being willing to share the harvest if I'm fortunate enough to take an animal(s). I also offer manual labor as payment if they have any work that needs to be done. I'll close the letter out by:  *Re-stating that I'm looking for some place to hunt, and that ""No"" is an acceptable answer  *Giving them my contact information - phone, e-mail, address  *Thanking them again for their time  Then, one other important detail: I send a self-addressed, stamped envelope with the letter so they can write back if they so choose. Seems old-school, but I figure some of the older farmers I'm writing to are old-school and may not have e-mail and stuff. I like this method as it's less intrusive than a phone call or stopping by, and it gives the landowner full control of how they get back to me if they choose to do so. It's not a sure-fire method and it's not always a ""yes"", but I've sent 5 letters this way and gotten 4 responses. Not bad, IMO."

Be up front with them, and be very clear and honest about your intentions (where, when, if anyone will be with you).  If they'd like, be willing to curb pests such as woodchucks and coyotes for them."
Hunting,3d13ab,Eric-Varminter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:16:26 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of good information up already, so I'll try not to duplicate it.  A few things I do down here in SoCal, are the following (I look for places to varmint hunt, so it opens the door for other types of hunting as well):  1)  Make-up fliers that explain what you do and how you can help.  Pass them out to everyone you run into.  If there are farmhands who only speak Spanish in your area, then make English and Spanish versions.  2)  Hit up the local feed, or farm stores.  Drop-off some fliers, but get to know them, so they know you and will refer people to you.  3)  Carry some type of liability insurance.  The NRA has a plan that acts as an umbrella policy:  https://www.locktonaffinity.com/nrains/excess.htm Don't let them know about your insurance right off, use it as a final point if you feel the farmer is wavering on saying yes, or no.  The trick is to get on Google maps/satellite, search out the areas you want to hunt, then researching the owners, then dress nicely and go visit.  Once you get one, or two, landowners, then don't be afraid to ask them to refer you to others.  It is much easier to get permissions if another landowner refers you.  Let us know how it works out!"

The suppressor does have a noticeable impact on ""standard"" ammo, but if you want the really quiet shots you need subsonic ammo otherwise you will still hear the round break the barrier.   @Alexwo1 Check this out - https://silencerco.com/how-do-silencers-work/"
Hunting,3cx099,Ready_for_the_Mayans,2,Thu Jul 16 15:18:58 2015 UTC,Yes. And even without the sonic boom the sound of bullet exiting the gun is very loud. The suppressor quiets the sound of the bullet exiting the barrel.

I do like the centerfire .17s, but we're not getting fancy here.  If they are coming up very close...like 50 yards or so, a shotgun with some decent ammo (like heavishot) would work.

The reality low magnification to decent objective size should provide plenty of light to see well in the dense vegetation and low light. The first big question is what is your budget? How much you want/can spend on glass is a huge determining factor. Another option would be a decent 3-9x50mm, preferably with a 30mm tube. The larger tube allows more light to be transferred to your eye."

I can get a second-hand Carl Zeiss Diavari-ZM 1,5-6 x 42 T* reticle 4 (14 years old and unused, like it is brand new) for $936.  A Victory HT 1,5-6X42 reticle 60 would run me $1790.

When I hunt with my AR I can comfortably and quickly make shots up to 200 yards with my Aimpoint PRO. Obviously you would ideally keep shots well under that range but it can be done. If you want a happy medium between red dot and magnified optic I would take a look at Leupold's VX-R series, they come in multiple magnifications and the center of the crosshair is illuminated by a red dot like in an Aimpoint."

As El_Hamerino commented, you could always purchased heavier tips for your bolts (125 gr.) if you want to ensure you are exceeding the minimum weight requirement for bolts for your xbow, but you will probably need to re-sight in your xbow as heavier tips will not hit the same as lighter ones."

Hunting,3cvzaq,LaFlamaBlanca8,5,Sat Jul 11 06:04:42 2015 UTC,"Both will serve you very well for a deer rifle. Both shoot the same bullet at comparable speeds. The .30-06 will launch a given bullet weight about 200 fps faster than the .308. The .30-06 also is available with heavier factory loaded ammunition. There is some increased recoil to go along with the extra power. For bolt action rifles, the .30-06 will be a ""long action"" vs a .308 ""short action"". That means exactly what it sounds like, the .30-06 rifle will be slightly longer with the same barrel length due to the action being slightly longer. Both will have similar ammunition availability.   100 yard is really not a very long shot for most modern rifles. Any of the common deer calibers will put plenty of energy on target at that distance."

One of the biggest struggles I have defending hunting is when people ask me about things like that, which are little more than killing for its own sake. Until the sport rejects the notion of literally making animals explode as an acceptable idea of fun, I think we still continue to struggle with perception and image issues."

Hunting,3cspih,reddecent,7,Fri Jul 10 13:42:09 2015 UTC,"I used this ballistics calculator on Federal's website because I normally use their TruBall foster slugs.   If you assume the gun is about 5 feet (60 inches) off the ground when you fire (standing up), with a 50 yard zero shooting parallel to the ground basically, the slug will hit the dirt at 225 yards (675 feet). If you are shooting upwards, it will go further. If you are kneeling or prone it won't go as far. It's probably not likely to go more than 300 yards (900 feet) unless you are shooting at a very high angle.  EDIT: At the higher end of range is something like a copper sabot slug which would go 320 yards (960 feet) with a 100 yard zero before burying itself in the dirt. Bottom line, even a full bore foster or brenneke style slug from a smoothbore can travel further than the length of your property before it hits the ground if you shoot while standing or shoot at all upwards. There's no substitute for knowing what's behind your target."

You're talking about a range of more than 3 times that! There isn't even ballistic data available for the .223 at this range because past 1,800 yards or so it literally won't penetrate paper towels.

Hunting,3cspih,Buelldozer,3,Fri Jul 10 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"You are correct. The bullet would have almost no energy left when it reached the top of the arc. But on its way back down it transfers all of its potential energy into kinetic energy. I am not sure if it would be enough to kill a person but it would have enough to do some damage. That being said, you might be correct as I doubt a .223 could go 3000 yards even on a perfect 45 degree arc."
Hunting,3cspih,FroBro243,8,Fri Jul 10 16:35:37 2015 UTC,"Mythbusters did an episode on whether or not a rifle or pistol fired straight up in the air could kill someone.

Hunting,3cspih,gstad,5,Fri Jul 10 16:42:28 2015 UTC,"But on its way back down it transfers all of its potential energy into kinetic energy.   It sure does but the k/e of a 56gr project travelling at ~53 meters per second is still equal to one half the mass times velocity squared.   Sooooooo assuming a 56gr projectile and an ultimate terminal velocity of 53mps the equation is ((.5 x .0036) x (53x53)) or ((.0018) x (2809)) or 5.05.   That's it, just 5.05 Kg or roughly 11lbs. It's like dropping a pen on your foot from shoulder height. You may feel it but it's extremely unlikely to kill you."
Hunting,3cspih,Buelldozer,3,Fri Jul 10 16:51:20 2015 UTC,Point conceded. I never even thought about how little a .223 bullet weighs.
Hunting,3cspih,FroBro243,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"According to my ballistic calculator, a 53gr VMAX fired at 3000 fps has a remaining velocity of 438 fps and 23 ft/lb of energy at 3000 yards. Thats not much, but its still in the realm of a high powered .22 cal airgun energy wise. I doubt its enough to create a lethal injury, but it is slightly more than dropping a pen on your foot. Either way, be sure of what is behind your target and don't launch rifle rounds into the sky."

I am sure anyone who has hunted upland game bird would know that. A bullet on the other hand would go some ways up.

Looking back, he told me that rifles shot into the air could go 5 miles, and kill someone.  It put a lot of fear in me and I never ever shoot a rifle above the horizon, even to this day as a 40 year old.   So, the thought that he might have exaggerated the distance, with the intent of teaching me how dangerous rifles are, was an exaggeration of some sort, is not that far of a stretch.   However, my uncle did die from a random bullet from the sky, while working in his garden.  We live out in the country, and I knew his son David in high school."

So, there's no way I can go and verify it for you.   Here is some research on the subject:  http://forensicoutreach.com/the-falling-bullet-myths-legends-and-terminal-velocity/  A quote from the article:  On New Year’s Eve, in Highlands Park, CA (A suburb of Los Angeles), Sheriff Lee Baca warned about the dangers of shooting live ammunition into the air. A few hours later, past the stroke of midnight, a 30 year old man was struck in the head and hospitalized by bullet fragments from above. Fortunately, he survived. “A bullet fired into the air can return to earth at speeds between 300 and 700 feet per second, fast enough to pierce a person’s skull,” Baca claimed.  This was not an isolated incident. Celebratory gunfire has wounded hundreds and killed dozens in recent years in the US alone. A 50-year-old woman in Atlanta, an 11-year-old boy in Phoenix, a baby in New Orleans — deaths like these are reported and investigated every year. A young man in Fresno, CA was killed when a friend’s vertical ‘lucky shot’ went straight up and came straight back down, entering his skull. A randomly-fired bullet hit a police helicopter in Riverside, California on New Year’s Eve in 1994, striking the pilot in the foot and forcing him to make an emergency landing. In Dallas, Texas on January 1st, 2012, a bullet came through the roof of a bedroom where a woman was nursing her baby and landed next to her on her bed."
Hunting,3cspih,fuzzwell,7,Fri Jul 10 16:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to run down every single one of these stories but your first one was a .30 caliber round and that's way different than a .22. and there's no mention of the distance involved.  A .223 will not travel 3,000+ yards let alone retain sufficient power to kill someone at that distance. I'm actually confident enough of this that I'd STAND THERE and let someone take shots at me.

Hunting,3cspih,fuzzwell,5,Fri Jul 10 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"I already posted a more comprehensive ballistic table. Yours is nice but a 55gr 223 is still only presenting 75ft/lbs at 1000 yards and even then it's a 690"" (57'!) drop!  A .223 ultimate range, before it hits the ground, may be 3000 yards but it's not killing anything at that range and you won't be hitting aimed shots at that range either.  I'll stand there and let you prove it. The physics are without question."
Hunting,3cspih,Buelldozer,3,Fri Jul 10 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you win, but I am saying that I've been thoroughly entertained reading up on bullet ballistics and scouring the internet for proof to a story I heard 30 years ago.

I commented this to someone else just now:   You know, your comment got me to thinking. The only time my dad exaggerated was on the side of caution. Looking back, he told me that rifles shot into the air could go 5 miles, and kill someone. It put a lot of fear in me and I never ever shoot a rifle above the horizon, even to this day as a 40 year old.  So, the thought that he might have exaggerated the distance, with the intent of teaching me how dangerous rifles are, was an exaggeration of some sort, is not that far of a stretch.  However, my uncle did die from a random bullet from the sky, while working in his garden. We live out in the country, and I knew his son David in high school."

Are you asking how far the slug will travel over open ground or if it will penetrate through heavy timber and brush?   In most cases there are ballistics stats for the ammunition you use right on the box, FPS and bullet drop specifically. This could give you an idea how far the slug will travel over open ground.   If there are houses or anything within a mile or two of the other side of the trees, I would recommend erring on the side of caution. ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS BEYOND YOUR TARGET........"

Hunting,3cspih,Lublib,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"This is not correct. A 1 oz foster slug from a smoothbore 12ga is going to be travelling at 1000fps at 100 yards, with just under 1000ft-lb of energy. I shoot them at 100 yards at the rifle range all the time and have no problem doing a 5"" group. Certainly good enough for whitetail.   Even at 400 yards that slug still has 270ft-lb of energy, which beats the muzzle energy of a lot of .38 special and .380 ACP loads, which I definitely do not want to be shot with.  Sub-caliber saboted slugs out of rifled barrels are good for taking deer out to 200yd and beyond and hold their velocity and energy even further."

Hunting,3ctvtj,Medic7816,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:19:32 2015 UTC,"First, figure out what round you will be shooting. The tikka has a 1:12 twist which is going to limit the weight of the bullet that you can shoot. The savage turns 1:9, allowing you to shoot heavier, higher bc bullets. If you are going to stick with 50-60 gr bullets, either will stabilize. Much heavier that 60 grains, and you are going to see better results with the savage. Both are quality guns in a similar price range. I personally prefer the way that the Tikka looks, but the savage does have the ability for at home barrel changes if that appeals to you."
Hunting,3ctvtj,Medic7816,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"The Tikka 223. Has 1-10 twist rate. 22in barrel, 1 mag. Did not know you could change barrels on the savage."

According to their website, it looks like the blue is available in either a 1:8 or 1:12 twist. http://cdn.tikka.fi/sites/default/files/Lite.pdf  A lot of people point to the ability to change the barrel in a savage as a big selling point. I personally think its a neat feature, but i doubt very many are actually shooting their barrels to the point where they need to be replaced. A .223 is hardly a barrel burner. If it where my rifle, I would go with the Tikka with a 1:8 twist. That will allow you to shoot all common bullet weights without worrying about stability issues, and I personally like the tikkas over the Savages."

Cold enough to snow and rain. If your not prepared for the right weather this can absolutely ruin your hunting experience. As for everything else, your most important step if you truly want to drop a deer is to scout your unit. Start as soon as you know where and do it often. Most units have private land on them, make sure to know where you can and cannot hunt. Most private land owners are kind enough to tell you if you can hunt their land if you juat ask and are polite. Once you have a relative location on where the deer are, get good with your gun. Make sure you can hit consistent, tight groups at 100 yards. Head over to /r/longrange and start reading.

Then take all the guns you have listed to a range with a friend and find one that you feel comfortable with. Most of the guns you have listed can kill feral hogs. Get a hunting license in your state and read the manual that comes with it about the desired game you want to hunt, (in Texas they give us a manual everytime you renew your license because bag limits change, hunting seasons change etc...).

Hunting,3cvmjj,jclark927,2,Sat Jul 11 04:28:44 2015 UTC,"For you in CA (there will be similar info in AZ for your brother and the safety certificates are reciprocal): Check out the DFG web site for a schedule of hunter ed courses. If it fits with your schedule, for your stage, I'd recommend the ""traditional"" courses over the on-line. The traditional class format has time for you to ask all your questions. (The four hour review is much more compressed.) FYI: If you decide to go the on-line route, you need to book your spot well in advance. (Traditional courses tend to be less crowded.) After the basic course is in the bag, you might also check out the DFG site for advanced hunter-ed courses. They have a bit higher fees, but lots of info and guidance one species at a time.   All three firearms you list are legal in CA (slugs required in the shotgun for big game). IMHO, none of them are great for a generalist big game gun in the West. (shorter range in the shotgun, very light bullet in the .223 and light, ballistically less efficient round in a 30 carbine.) That said, among the three, I would go with the 30 carbine and buy rounds with a quality hunting bullet. ( save your nickles for a future ,270, 280 (or 7 mm mag), 30-06 or 30 win mag.)  As a non-resident, your brother's CA license and tags will cost a bit more than yours. As you get into it, you two might decide that your chances for public land success are greater in AZ (or by meeting midway in CO for an elk hunt -- put meat in the freezer with a cow elk tag).  Hope that gets you rolling. Have fun and stay safe."

Hunting,3crgas,3fingerapache,4,Fri Jul 10 06:10:54 2015 UTC,"In addition to what this guy said, youll be working during hunting season.  If you like hunting, wrong job.  Game wardens do not get hunting season off."

Hunting,3crgas,ChuckWeezy,5,Fri Jul 10 11:17:38 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but I believe you need a bachelors.

Hunting,3crgas,RoadMule,3,Fri Jul 10 05:51:04 2015 UTC,"You dont need a BA but it sure helps. And it's actually more beneficial to get it in something like Wildlife and Fisheries Biology. You go to the academy for the law enforcement part of the job, but knowing your stuff about the wildlife and ecosystem will really put you ahead of the rest."
Hunting,3crgas,swolemechanic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:49:39 2015 UTC,"My university offered a Conservation Enforement degree. I probably wouldn't major in that (no crossover). It would make a great minor, if offered."
Hunting,3crgas,parabox1,4,Fri Jul 10 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"You'll need a bachelors, although most states won't require it to be specific to being a game warden, it definitely helps. While some might think that a degree in biology is the way to go, from what I've heard from DFG workers, is that a criminal justice degree is the way to go. It's also easier to get in if you have some law enforcement experience to begin with."

Hunting,3crgas,il0kin,2,Fri Jul 10 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"I went to school to be a cop, I tested to be a game warden and had one come to class to explain what his job was like.  The guy who came into class said he spends all day on the trail during snowmobile and atv season. All day on the water over the summer. He's not there to enjoy himself, he's working (often at checkpoints) so by the end of the season he hates seeing other snowmobiles, atvs or boats.   Regarding backup, he works a rural area and he shares dispatch with the highway patrol. He tries to back them and local police up when he's in the area so they'll back him up when he needs help (assuming they can find him as forests don't have clean addresses).  It sounded like a cool job if you like working alone in the wilderness dealing with jerks from time to time.  The tests I did were: a basic civil service style written test, how to make a variety of guns safe, how to ID different species of deer, ducks, fish, etc (including non game species). I also had an interview which I bombed (I couldn't articulate my answers) and I knew that before I left.  As others have said, go down a biology school path if you want to be a Game Warden. Criminology degrees are fluff (I have one and wish I got a technical degree instead).  If you want to know more or chat with a game warden, reach out to your local one. Odds are (s)he'd love to chat with you about it."
Hunting,3crgas,dcskater159,2,Fri Jul 10 12:08:30 2015 UTC,"Check about getting in first.  Our state has a massive line to get in, 4 year degree's required for most and you pretty much have to wait for someone to die or retire to even get a chance."

Hunting,3cisnt,Eric-Varminter,2,Wed Jul 8 14:56:55 2015 UTC,Rare on account of grays being able to keeping away of coyotes.  Coyotes will kill gray foxes on sight if given the chance.  They compete for the same food sources and a coyote will eat just about anything.  The juvenile gray in the OP's picture was at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Hunting,3ckhus,TheDeguy,3,Wed Jul 8 19:51:21 2015 UTC,"I've hunted Snipe, Rails, and brant before. Never hunted Gallinules but they are those black birds with red/yellow beaks that scurry around in marshes.    Snipe: They hang out around marshy/wet areas. I usually find them at the top end of farm ponds or in really damp fields that flood in winter. Great fun to shoot and taste decent. But they make a dove breast look huge.    Rails: AKA Marsh hens. Marsh hen hunting is done on a flood tide in salt marshes where I'm from. when the water gets super high they have no place to go but a few pieces of high ground or floating debris. They fly very very slow and not far. Anything over a .410 is overkill. I use a flats boat and find the areas where they are and flush them. They don't like getting up so bring some rocks to throw. While marsh hens look big there isn't much meat and its not the best eating although not bad if done right.   Brant: Like a goose but different. Hunt just like ducks/geese. Never shot one but have tried. The only place they winter anywhere near me is in the Palmico Sound NC and it is about the furthest south portion of their range so not many."

Hunting,3ckhus,UllrRllr,2,Thu Jul 9 04:33:21 2015 UTC,Keep in mind you need small shot (7 1/2) for snipe and rails. The states I hunt allow for lead shot for these migratory birds. But..... having lead shot in your possession while duck hunting is illegal on the federal level. I have tried to find steel in 7 1/2 but its expensive as hell so I didn't feel it was worth it.

They made me a better shooter, as they fly very low and weave like a fighter jet. Starting out I missed probably 9/10 shots because they just weren't where I shot a second ago. Great practice for the dogs as well. However, if you actually want a meal you'll have to put in some time because it takes a dozen to make a mouthful."

It's generally a good idea to have two barrels for your shotgun, rifled for slugs, and smooth bore for bird shot. That way you can hunt everything from doves to deer with one gun. You can take deer out to 150 yards with slugs and a rifled barrel.   There's really no reason to spend a ton of money on a shotgun. Remington 870 and Mossberg 500 are inexpensive guns, but they're classics are a reason, they just work. I would personally recommend one of those."

All are interchangeably called wild or feral hogs, pigs or boars; in this context, “boar” can refer to a male or female. (Technically, “feral” refers to animals that can be traced back to escaped domestic pigs, while the more all-encompassing “wild” refers to any non-domestic animals.) Escaped domestic hogs adapt to the wild in just months, and within a couple of generations they transform into scary-looking beasts as mean as can be.   It's discussed in page 2 of the article."

Hunting,3ci0a3,chrisbattle,2,Wed Jul 8 03:09:41 2015 UTC,"This is what drives me crazy about wild pigs......there are millions of them and they're always talked about as a huge problem but no one in Tx, Fl, or CA will let you on their land without paying first or you have to use a guide service.  If they wanted them gone that bad you'd figure people would jump at the opportunity to have hunters come take a few but it's not the case."
Hunting,3ci0a3,jclorley,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:27:59 2015 UTC,"Actually it is the case.  I know plenty of people in Texas who have formed a hog hunting business.  The land owners pay them to come out and kill the hogs.  The problem is that unless you know the land owner, or the hog guy, nobody's letting you on their property.  There's too much money in making people pay for killing hogs, and when they need serious help, they call in the hog guy."
Hunting,3ci0a3,bigdogle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:13:28 2015 UTC,"They are a big problem and you could probably find some land owners that would let you do it for free if you asked nicely or knew the right people.  You might be able to bribe them with a few hours of work fixing fences or helping out etc.    They'd not just going to advertise they will let strangers on their land with guns for free.  Most big land owners just hire a guide to bring clients on their land if there really is a big problem.   Some might pay for the service, but most probably make a little money off of it.    That being said, you can easily find a guided night hunt in Texas for $150-$200/gun including lodging and night vision scopes."

Hunting,3ci0a3,jclorley,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:40:02 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be spending anything near elk money on hog hunts.   There are dozens of ads on the Dallas/ft worth Craigslist and it would be an easy place to fly into from PA.   There are more hogs out in west Texas, but getting there from of state isn't easy and there's not much to do.    [Willshoghunts.com](www.willshoghunts.com) and [outlaw outfitters](www.huntoutlaw.com) are 2 guided hunts not too far from the Dallas/ft worth metroplex.

Hunting,3ci0a3,jclorley,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:23:08 2015 UTC,The short answer to your question is no.  You are going to have a tough time finding free pig hunts in california.  I do know of some public land that is known to hold pigs.  Pm me for info.  This land is by no means over run with pigs but they are definitely out there.  Like most public land you will have to contend with other hunters and a decent hike in.  You will need a license and a tag to hunt pig in ca.  If you really want to take a wild boar you are better off paying a guide to take you on private land.  They can teach you much more in a day than you I might learn in a year on your own.    The 06 will do fine for pig.

I shoot a T/C Pro Hunter, which with their FX model puts it at $550 with some shopping. Its a fantastic weapon. 14 shots with 14 deer so far. Ranges between 40 and 230 yards.   For accuracy and loose powder, you can't go wrong with Blackthorn 209. Seems to be the go to for accuracy work in modern muzzleloaders.

What I think that more and more people will get to be against hunting, and that could be a problem for the hunters..."
Hunting,3cftur,toxicroach,3,Tue Jul 7 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"The problem is the misunderstanding of anti-hunters and hunters are in spot responsible for that.  If people knew the biological reasoning behind hunting, there would not be an outcry.  Hunters through conservation attempt to boost a species to the carrying capacity of the habitat. It is a renewable resource that generates income. Hunting is a billion dollar industry and spends a lot of the money in habitat development and wildlife management.  Would a eastern hunter continue to donate the $800 to the state of Colorado for the species in the state if he wasn't allowed to go there and try to hunt them? Probably not. Each state would need to find a way to generate the income to supplement the wildlife or decide to cut funding to the program. More predators would have to be introduced to control the populations. Predators without a fear of humans can become dangerous. In the ski towns of Colorado (Steamboat, Vail, Aspen), they currently have over 300 black bear complaints a year. The number would go up without bears being afraid of people. Without hunters and police/wildlife officials having funding to discourage the bears the cities would have to be high fenced entirely, which would create a problem for deer and elk getting to their wintering grounds.    If game were left unchecked more animals would die and that causes would be starvation, winter kill, vehicular accidents, disease, increased predation, etc.   Right now, there are too many people taking habitat from wildlife. We could not go to an all nature scenario, because we would loose species(Probably Bighorn Sheep)  Most of the people that are against hunting live in a city and only see the killing, they do not see the hard work and effort to preserve a species by hunters - so they can be enjoyed by future generations. They need to know this. They soon will outnumber the hunting class and game management could take a turn for the worse, if they are not educated on all the good that comes from hunting.   My 2c Also, food supplies would be damaged by the surplus of wild game. It is not only grains for cattle, but also corn and soy for people."
Hunting,3cftur,brews,2,Wed Jul 8 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"""The problem is the misunderstanding of anti-hunters and hunters are in spot responsible for that.""  I totally agree with this quote. And I agree with all you said, that is the reason hunting must go on.  And also, hunting reserves in Africa doubled the area of land that is native habitat, without hunting, there would be less place for animals to live."

If you go on a trip like this, bring a few different guns and change based on your terrain. I stayed in place most of the time due to my inexperience, but saw the most pigs when I was teamed up with a guide and went stalking, had a great opportunity for a 250 yard shot and pulled it. He managed to get two with one bullet and then got a third when they stopped fleeing a few seconds later.

You can harvest them for meat I suppose, but I've heard the big ones don't taste so good. I live in TX. It usually comes up when someone knows someone with a 'whole mess of hogs tearing shit up' on their property and we'll load up and go hunt.   If I was up north, i'd be gearing up for deer hunting. Y'all got way better deer up north than we do down here. Just a lot more meat on them.  So I guess my advice is 'hunt what you got'. Or if you have any friends or kin down south, go visit."
Hunting,3cf296,emperorOfTheUniverse,3,Tue Jul 7 22:52:14 2015 UTC,Hog Hunting imo is the easiest type of hunting there is besides varmint. I live in Florida they're everywhere. Look for torn up ground becasue this is where they eat roots and bugs. They pretty much live  everywhere from swamps to fields. Its easier to track them in swamps because of the wet ground. But hogs are mainly active at night so know your states law regarding what time you can hunt. We use dogs in Florida mainly but setting up a tree stand over their favorite feeding lot will give you a good chance at getting one.
Hunting,3cf296,Perk1nator,2,Tue Jul 7 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"I've hunted pigs in California and now I'm South Carolina. Two completely different terrains but the basics are the same. First off in ca, we were hunting on 3,000 acres of private land, mostly live oak and scrub brush. We hunted watering holes, wallows, and bamboo groves we set up for them. Sometimes we would just drive around and look. But we hunted quite a bit and sometimes we would shoot 10-15 and other times we wouldn't see a thing.   No onto sc!! We can bait. So I sit in a stand, about 70 yards from my feeder and wait for the bastards to come to me!!! It's pretty boring but given that I'm in nursing school and short on scouting time, it works for now. If I have a free weekend I'll go out and walk the property and try to jump a few. Those days I usually hunt with my bow or my pistol.   And the terrain in sc (low country area) is swamp, pine forest, and dense live oaks. And bugs. Bugs everywhere. Snakes too. Don't ever hunt in sc or the south without snake boots. Ever."

Hunting,3cf296,ourguns,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:46:20 2015 UTC,"Ha, good luck... Really it just comes down to meeting the right people.  I worked in the agriculture business so I was in contact with these people constantly.  Your best best to hunt anything would be to become very into wine and visit vineyards and casually drop that you enjoy hunting and if there are any pests on their property, you would be happy to help take care of them.  That and bow hunt.  Ive had minimal issues getting people to let me bow hunt because they like the thought of a bow more than a rifle on their property."

Hunting,3cf296,Blitz7x,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"Well out in CA we had rattle snakes everywhere.  Killed about 30 a summer (we had livestock so couldn't keep them around). Down here in the south we have all sorts of poisons snakes.  Cotton mouths aka water moccasins, rattle snakes, coral snakes, etc.  However, you really just need to be aware of the cotton mouths and the rattlers.  Don't ever stop over a fallen log without snake boots on.  Few times ago, when I was out in the swamp, I stepped over a log and there was a 3 foot cotton mouth 3 inches from my foot, another 4 footer maybe a foot away from my other foot, and a third one about 18 inches long under by boot.  It was terrifying.  Shot all of them and then the pig hunt was over but no one got bit!  So if you're afraid of snakes, then good luck hunting down here! At least in the low country."

Hunting,3cf296,CharlesHBronson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:53:01 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely hook up with an outfitter. I hunt on private land and I could never guarantee a successful hunt because I don't hunt often enough to know the moments of the animals. But if your looking for an outfitter let me know and I may be able to point you in a direction if you want to hunt in sc! Also, I hear Virginia has some big deer... Any truth to that???"
Hunting,3cf296,sheep_wrangler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:18:00 2015 UTC,Yeah please do! An decent outfitter in SC would be great. The deer here are great and you kind find some monster bucks. The problem is private land is much better to hunt than public. You can go public here but you have to work twice as hard and watch out for other hunters. Plus people piss so close to trails and just leave human scent everywhere. Private land is not that hard to nab if you have decent social skills. But sometimes once the relationship falls apart you usually cant hunt the land anymore. I had 4 places lined up for the fall and now I am down to 1 maybe 2.
Hunting,3cf296,CharlesHBronson,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:29:05 2015 UTC,"We've always stalked hogs.  In the mtns, we dog'em and stick'em. Its an exciting style of hunting compared to sitting in a stand all day like deer season.  Its not like a shooting an animal from a far, you and your dogs on the ground interacting with them and they put up a good fight.  Wild hogs may be common, but they're not clumsy (or stupid).  They will turn and fight when pressured and can split you wide open with their cutters.  They're a nuisance on the landscape but great sport.  We tend to hunt them when other hunting seasons are closed because we can hunt them nearly anytime and we kill everyone we can because they compete with indigenous species. We see them from stands during deer season but few ppl would shoot their deer woods up for a hog. Best way to learn is to find some good hog hunters or a good guide and go hunting.  Wherever you go, the terrain will dictate the way you hunt them.  Down in TX, they hunt them from helicopters.  https://youtu.be/pVecBww1vcE WARNING GRAPHIC"

When I go alone, I generally hunt swampy areas and stalk slowly with the wind in my face (pigs have great noses).  Your EARS will probably find pigs before your eyes do, sometimes you get 10 yards away from them before you hear/see them.  If you see one running and you know he hasn't smelled you, don't worry because pigs run for grins and giggles, keep stalking slowly toward them.  30-06 does a great job, but I prefer my ruler 44 mag carbine...having 5 trigger pulls is comforting!  Watch out for snakes, I went in Feb and didn't wear my snake boots and walked up on a nice water moccasin then was worried about snake bites the rest of the hunt.  So, to recap, take a slow stroll in the woods with your gun and keep the wind in your face.  If you find a fresh pig trail...follow it.  Knee high and smaller are GREAT BBQ!"

Hunting,3cdoke,Chevy140,5,Tue Jul 7 02:39:51 2015 UTC,"If you follow the adage of 1000 ft-lbs of bullet energy on target for deer, most anything will do the job at 250 yards. Heck, most of the popular cartridges will put over 1500 ft-lbs on target at 250 yards.    To date, I've take deer with these cartridges at these ranges: .308 at 350 yards, .270 at 325 and 400 yards, 7mm-08 at 650 yards. Bullet placement is key, and I've found that a good rest and known yardage is what makes bullet placement reliable."

Hunting,3cdoke,ri7ani,3,Tue Jul 7 12:06:39 2015 UTC,"You don't really need to move up in caliber -- the .243 is plenty capable to 250 yards on deer sized game.  The MPBR of a .243 Win. with 100 grain bullet is 283 yards.  You shouldn't be shooting at live game any farther than that--there's a big difference between hitting a target at long range and shooting a moving animal.  An ""upgrade"" to me means a nicer rifle, which would rule out the 783 (it's on par with the Marlin bolt actions--both are economy or budget rifles). What makes the .243 nice is that you probably don't flinch when you shoot it.  All things being equal we tend to shoot lighter recoiling rifles better than hard kicking calibers.  If you want to move up in caliber then I'd recommend a .25-06. Flat, deadly on deer, but not as much recoil as say, a 270, 308 or 30-06. Upgrades in rifle quality would include a Savage 10/110, Winchester Model 70, Remington 700, Ruger 77, Browning X Bolt, etc."
Hunting,3cdoke,zachbrevis,2,Tue Jul 7 18:43:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for your responses. I am still wondering if anyone has had any issues with this particular model.
Hunting,3cdoke,thehuntinggearguy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"Typical Remington quality BS. Some are great, others not so much. Check for bolt turn effort in person because some of the ones I handled were miserably rough. Or buy a Savage Axis. Or just stick with your 243."
Hunting,3cdoke,Medic7816,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"The 783 is an entry level rifle, designed to give a novice hunter an acceptable level of accuracy for a low price. While it work for you? Sure. It's not on the same level as a Remington 700, Tikka T3, Savage 10, or Ruger 77 in terms of quality. If you only plan on firing 5-10 rounds a year to check your zero it will probably last you a while. No one can really speak to their longevity as they are relatively new rifles. If I were you, I wouldn't buy one. For a similar cost, you can buy a Remington 700 ADL and have a proven action with much more aftermarket support. If you are looking to upgrade your .243 to a larger caliber, I suggest .30-06. Enough horsepower to take a deer at any reasonable range and easily available ammunition."

Hunting,3cdoke,vstarbr,-6,Tue Jul 7 04:31:04 2015 UTC,"Try a .300 mag. It should reach out 250 and still have enough knock down power to take out a deer.

Hunting,3cdoke,zachbrevis,3,Tue Jul 7 21:30:14 2015 UTC,A .30-06 will certainly work on deer at 250 yards.  You could kill an elk at that distance with an '06.  The .300 mag is overkill and the recoil is going to give the shooter a flinch (esp. if he's used to a .243).

I've been wanting to make my own European mounts for them and its finally time.  I let 'the junk' decompose naturally (I let it sit on top of our wood pile and the beetles/grubs clean it up nice).  I'll say I definitely let these two sit longer that I would have liked.  I'm doing 1 at a time to make sure it goes OK as this is my first time doing this.  I got the first one taped and painted up with the per-oxide (see next picture - I used some super powerful stuff that you need a commercial license to buy. Luckily I have a friend who can get it for me).  I'm going to let this one sit for 2 or three days to soak.  Hopefully it come out pearly white and ready for step 2.  I plan to put some sort of finish on the antlers to make them look nice.  I am going to mount it on a piece of wood cut from a downed tree that will be sanded and stained.    Has anyone ever done this?  Any tips are much appreciated!!!  I'll update in a while with the final product.
Hunting,3cc071,Emmersom,2,Mon Jul 6 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"2 or 3 days sounds to long, i have previously used diluted chlorine and a toothbrush.

Hunting,3c8rkj,HindleMcCrindleberry,3,Mon Jul 6 01:17:41 2015 UTC,I think humans play the role of the wolf now. And in suburban areas where deer are over populated it's due to the gov't over regulating hunting.

I only hunted them in the winter (in the 90s, when I had my trapper's license), where I could sell their fur, skulls, claws and teeth.  Now, I am getting phone calls all the time asking me to kill them because of their boldness in attacking farm animals, including farm cats (which takes them a few nights to wipe them all out).    I now hunt them outside of my self-imposed ""season"" of October to February.  I won't hunt them during the breeding season, unless I am asked to solve an immediate problem.  Now I start in late August and go until mid-March, depending on the area.  Their populations have exploded and all I used to believe in their reproduction cycles has changed."

Hunting,3c8rkj,Eric-Varminter,2,Mon Jul 6 00:18:15 2015 UTC,It's still possible. The winter coats are way way more desirable to buyers. In winter around here you can get $75-90 a yote. Usually the buyer prefers to do the skimming themselves so the hunter doesn't skin it incorrectly.
Hunting,3c8rkj,swolemechanic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"I would skin, flesh and then send to a tannery in Idaho for tanning.  I then sold them on EBAY, as well as to small sporting goods shops who could resell legally prepared furs & skulls.  The claws were purchased by an American Indian, who would use them for jewelry (including some canine teeth, that would come from damaged skulls).    You can still sell them today, it's just the market is flooded with prepped furs now.  If you can sell to a fur buyer (with, or without a trapper's license), then you can make whatever a fur from your area, in the condition you are selling, would make.  That requires skinning, fleshing and putting up on a stretcher.  The price you receive, will be as much about your handling of the fur after the shot, then the fur itself, so be careful."

Be quiet going in, try to have the wind at your face, watch your scent and check your downwind for coyotes that will work their way around you to figure out if it's safe.  Otherwise, call in an area that has coyotes (pre-scout for sign), and practice using the call before you go out.  Start softly, then get louder after a few series of calls.  Do not over-do it.

In the 60's in Texas, then sheep herders complained to the government about coyotes killing thousands of sheep the government created eradication programs intending to decimate the coyote population.  Coyotes instinct to survive fought back by litters being larger in size than previous years.  The government population control methods all failed.  Around here in the spring during denning season small kids get bit when the coyote mating pair dig out a den and have a litter of pups too close to civilization.  Dogs in the area come up missing as the coyote perceive just about anything as a potential threat.  Few kids loose their lives annually to coyote attacks.  Back year a decade ago a teenage girl was mauled to death by a pack of coyotes from the East coast (larger genetic strain of coyotes).

There is also a 10 waiting period from the time you purchase any firearm till the point you may take it home. I've never fully understood this restriction on anything other than your first firearm purchase. If someone has 54 guns... why on earth would you put a time restriction on his 55th one?"

I've tried safes, but that inevitably results in disagreements over where the ""large black ugly safe"" goes and opens my valuable firearms to being knocked around/bumped into each other.  The closet option is great, because everything goes neatly up on the wall while still leaving room for ammunition.  Even if you have a smaller closet that you can dedicate to storage, it's worth it.  23 years of kids later, it's proven to be a safe means of storing firearms.  The kids inevitably got their own rifles for target shooting, etc, but I remain the sole person who can access my gun closet.  I was raised to be a bit old fashioned in terms of firearm safety.  I've attached a picture of a peek into the door.  There's more to my setup, but that's all I've got a photo of.  It's incredibly cheap to put together.  Answers to other questions: (1) No, there's no limit to sheer quantity in any state.

I have to admit I find gun laws in the states a bit .... Limp. Here in Germany you are required to have a safe with a certain protection level. Handguns require higher security level and you have to keep the ammunition in another safe box than the gun itself.
Hunting,3c8e01,EnlghtndBirdMan,13,Sun Jul 5 22:41:30 2015 UTC,"Safes are really meant to delay thieves, but as a side effect they delay you too. When it comes to home protection, having your handgun locked up in a different safe than your ammo can be the difference between life or death. So in the US we typically fight to maintain the functional home defense rights, and also extend that to personal defense rights (concealed carry of a loaded handgun)."

Hunting,3c8e01,nazaveg,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:49:08 2015 UTC,"Gun laws in the states are extremely strict and can net you ridiculous jail terms for very minor acts. E.g. the other day i came across a replica of a Luger/P-08 artillery holster that included a wooden buttstock. Like this: http://cmrfirearms.com/shop/images/2%20Luger%20Pistol%20m23%20Holster%20with%20stock%20Ref.%20L2b.jpg It was on sale for about 50 euros.   Here's the problem: owning that, plus a standard Luger, can get you 10 years in federal prison, and US federal prisons don't give time off for good behavior. You don't have to use it in a crime, you don't have to do anything bad, just owning the two is good for 10 years.  There are many examples like that. Seemingly harmless things... let's say I own a Steyr Aug, purchased in the states. I can buy spare magazines locally, but if you were to send me a magazine (made in Germany), installing that magazine would be a felony. 10 years behind bars for swapping magazines.   ... that's not getting into the very severe penalties for having a firearm in your possession when you commit a crime.  The law is very strict, but it is also for the most part written with the understanding that normal people have legitimate need of weapons. That's not a very European idea. While there are places that require guns to be stored deactivated/disassembled and away from ammo, those laws are of questionable legality because a disassembled firearm is not a practical weapon. For the most part you can store firearms loaded and ready to fire, so long as you do not leave them in places where children can reach them."
Hunting,3c8e01,Noxixia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"That's very interesting! May I ask why you can't own that holster? I think that sending weapon parts like magazine is illegal here in Germany too, but I don't think that this holster would be illegal here."
Hunting,3c8e01,PeanutNore,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:16:43 2015 UTC,"A standard Luger pistol like this http://picturearchive.gunauction.com/652074913/5700729/ACF3A46.JPG has a small lug at the bottom of the grip, and a loop at the top, for attaching a shoulder stock. Attaching a stock requires federal approval, background checks, and a bunch more (including a $200 tax payment every time it transfers from person to person), all of which takes about 9 months to process. Possession without approval is a felony worth 10 years in prison. You can own the gun without the stock, or the stock without the gun, but if you buy both (without first going through a very lengthy process) you are a felon. The crime is if you connect them, but under the legal theory of ""constructive possession"" you need only the ability to connect them.   Now, the artillery Luger that the holster in question is designed for is a very rare gun, and is officially listed as a ""Curio or Relic"" and granted an exemption from the Short Barrelled Rifle rule (even thought it otherwise qualifies), so if you happen to have an original Artillery Luger you are in the clear.  About the magazines, it isn't sending it that is illegal. You could mail me a dozen made in Germany Steyr Aug magazines and no harm done because I don't own a Steyr Aug. The issue is that according to US law semi-auto firearms must have at least 10 US made ""parts"" where parts are one of 20 named assemblies or components including buttstock, barrel, magazine follower, magazine body, magazine spring, bolt, etc. When Steyr began selling the Aug in the US, they set up a plant to make US parts to meet that threshold. Three of the parts made in the US are in the magazine. So technically speaking if I buy a spring that was made in china, and swap the magazine spring, I am looking at the same felony."

I recommend keeping any guns you own in a safe.  A single handgun safe in the bedside drawer is an acceptable safety measure, although I find a 12 gauge to be a better deterrent than a handgun.  Anything aside from the handgun safe, I would put in a large fireproof safe.  I also recommend maintaining that safe in a humidity and temperature controlled room in your house, and bolting the safe to the foundation.  Rapid temperature changes can cause ambient humidity in the air to condense on the guns which can cause rusting and damage.  Rusty guns are not safe.  As a result keeping the guns in a room with fairly constant temperature and humidity is a good practice.  Similarly, routine cleaning, oiling, and maintenance is important to keeping your guns in working order."

Hunting,3c7jbo,rottinguy,4,Sun Jul 5 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"Dude. Even one of your sources disagrees with you. I suggest you read that entire post as it's pretty educational.   The idea that adrenaline causes ""gamely"" flavor is just one more old wives' tale.   To be clear, I think heart shots are great. They're rapidly lethal and result in a tremendous amount of blood pooling in the chest cavity which is what you want.  In my experience, gamey flavor is caused by a combination of three primary factors:   Diet: Mammals tend to taste like what they've been eating which is why domesticated animals are often given a special ""finishing"" diet in the days/weeks before they are slaughtered. Generally speaking, deer that lives in high desert sage brush will be stronger tasting than a deer living in agricultural developments or next to suburbs. Note also that a rutting buck undergoes numerous physiological changes that can include fasting. Poor Field Treatment: The more quickly you can kill an animal and remove the blood and guts, the better the muscles will taste. Blood is the primary conduit of an animal's natural flavor so it's important to get as much of it out as you can. Hunters can also make big mistakes by accidentally spreading oil from the tarsal musk glands via their knives. Poor Butchery: The muscle structure of a deer is littered with small, gamey tasting glands that can be easy to miss if you're not looking for them. Silver skin also tends to increase the gamey flavor which is among the reason it should be removed during butchery."

Tastes a lot different than the beef you buy at the grocery store. Know why? Diet. Ever eaten a bull? Tastes a lot different than eating a heifer doesn't it?

Hunting,3c7jbo,dmarionk,3,Sun Jul 5 17:05:17 2015 UTC,"Doe meat is generally more tender and tastes better. Also it's a general practice to let bucks get older and bigger before taking them as ""trophies"". Not something I personally do as I hunt for food and the experience rather than trophies."
Hunting,3c7jbo,narddawgs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"I saw one episode where a guy had if I remember right, shot a buck illegally (I can't recall if he was where he shouldn't be or what).  The officers wrote him up a summons and told him they'd let him keep the carcass but without the head.  The guy seemed upset, one of the officers mentioned."
Hunting,3c7jbo,LittleBigHorn22,3,Sun Jul 5 20:23:53 2015 UTC,Doe meat is normally better tasting. Also it allows you more chance at tagging out for any deer rather than only bucks.
Hunting,3c7jbo,c3h8pro,3,Sun Jul 5 17:21:08 2015 UTC,The distribution of tags by gender is to thin larger heard and release pressure on an area. Removing a doe removes all the fawns she could of had. Its a control tactic.
Hunting,3c7jbo,bigdogle,3,Sun Jul 5 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"I hate being late to parties lol.    As far as permits, most states do that to a degree, and more-so the counties in that state.  You have some doe only, some buck only, and some all deer.  It's a way to control the herd, I.E. my county only allows does to be shot through Thanksgiving, and then it's bucks only, outside the ears or spikes.  They are trying to manage the herds in the county to make for healthier herds, and better hunting.  As far as which one I'd rather have, (according to the regulations in my county)  whichever one walks out first.  I want to eat what I shoot, so if it's a buck, awesome, if a doe, just as happy.  For the argument that ensued about how a buck tastes compared to a doe, and how to get it out and all such, here's MHO... I love deer meat, doe is awesome, buck is awesome.  It's my favorite meat, and I don't soak it in anything but marinade.  I DO NOT want the gamey taste out of the meat, I love that taste.  So quit crying about who, what, when, where and how.  Just eat what you like, and be happy you got the best thing on earth."
Hunting,3c7jbo,anti-apostle,2,Mon Jul 6 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"there are some opinions that it tastes better, and while I'm not going to say that those people are wrong, it is subjective. Not everyone is opposed to the depth of flavour offered by game meat, personally the only reason I would prefer to eat doe is purely tenderness. bucks rut, and prepare for rut for a lot of the year, their muscle is tougher (and more flavourful).  I have no desire to collect trophies and as such would prefer a smaller buck, or a doe (if tags would allow where I live now) any day"
Hunting,3c7jbo,marcomosh,2,Sun Jul 5 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"Age , sex , deer movement when shot, type of vegetation it eats all are factors that effect meat.  The tarsal gland on a male mule deer will produce massive amounts of gameyness   The best deer to shoot is a lil forky male as u can tell its age....1.5 - 2 years old  Does have very little character traits that tell age"
Hunting,3c7jbo,Medic7816,2,Sun Jul 5 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"By having a license that allows you to harvest either sex, you would think that you could double your chances for a successful hunt. The truth of the matter is that your odd much more than double. If I see ten deer in the woods, it will be a good day if one of them is a buck. Its not that does are all that more plentiful, they are just generally less wary and easier to see. You could easily increase your odds of filling your tag 10x or so by having the ability to shoot either sex.   I personally have never gone out of my way to shoot a buck when not required to by law. Some of the area's that I hunt in Michigan are buck only to increase deer numbers. As of yet, I have not seen a good recipe for antler soup, so shooting bucks isn't a huge drive for me."
Hunting,3c7jbo,wolfshot,2,Sun Jul 5 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"The doe population is much higher than the buck population in any state you go to. Does are more prevalent, and if a hunter is only looking for meat, it's better to take a doe that tastes better, and has less of an effect on population control."
Hunting,3c7jbo,gator2442,2,Sun Jul 5 19:53:26 2015 UTC,"Hunting regulations are complicated these days, they can vary from county to county and from day to day in any given state.  The ideal deer for meat is a youngish mature buck, he's got taste, texture, and volume.  Same in commercial meats like pork and cattle, the young male is usually preferable to eat. I like to hunt bucks, not necessarily for hanging on the wall, I enjoy the challenge of scouting for and setting up on smart bucks.  I don't even care if I kill them necessarily. I just like trying to put myself in the right place to see one, but if he gives me a good, clean shot, I'm more apt to take him.  I don't usually harvest does, they're fawn factories. and we don't have enough deer in our area."
Hunting,3c7jbo,whitemagic420,2,Tue Jul 7 03:04:42 2015 UTC,Many states that have populations of deer that need to be thinned will issue doe tags.  These are intended to thin out the deer herd.  Some states have programs that require you to kill does in order to get a buck tag.
Hunting,3c7jbo,Desert-Mouse,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:52:38 2015 UTC,"All sorts of good answers here, thanks!  Population control never really occurred to me, though it does make sense.  I just always thought killing bucks would have the same effect but I guess it depends.  It does seem like these places pay close attention to their deer populations which is good.  We don't need the deer taking over (or any other animals, for that matter)."
Hunting,3c7jbo,gator2442,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"Population is almost only controlled by hunters taking does, so biologists use it as their tool to do just that. Regarding the bucks having a similar effect, keep in mind that does will stay in esterous (heat, effectively) until they are pregnant, and bucks can come from miles away to assist even after all their local does are no longer fertile. The only way is to reduce the breeding herd."

Hunting,3c7jbo,wellbeyond,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have the doe since the meat, when handled properly, has a far less chance of being gamey tasting. You have to be particularly careful when hunting doe because you must pay attention to whether or not it is pregnant and whether or not it's producing milk and caring for your yearlings. Killing a doe that's supporting a couple of yearlings can mean that the yearlings won't survive. It's important before you take your shot to make sure you don't see a couple of little ones following behind the mother about 20-30 yards.  That said, bucks don't always produce gamey tasting meat and neither do does always produce ""cleaner"" tasting meat. A lot of that has to do more with the hunter. Having a shot that doesn't produce a very clean kill and allows the animal to run for a long distance will often leave a bit of gamey taste (as they dump all of their adrenaline into their bloodstream to run at a very unscientific half-the-speed-of-light). Improper field dressing and handling of a deer also can affect the flavor. Waiting too long before dressing a deer and leaving it in above-freezing temperatures can begin the spoiling process on your harvest. It's best to get your deer dressed and in the cold as quickly as possible (even if that means hanging it up in a tree to get it in the cold wind). If you take down a deer with a clean kill-zone shot quickly and humanely and have it dressed and put up in a timely fashion, you're going to have little risk of gamey taste unless it's a buck that happens to be dead in the middle of the rut or just very old."
Hunting,3c7jbo,StupidHumanSuit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:54:25 2015 UTC,"In AL we have a large deer population and to help keep it in check we harvest a lot of doe, which results in fewer, but larger and healthier deer.  Also, doe don't worry about things as much as bucks do, so you usually see a lot more doe than bucks except for the last month of the season during rut.  Sometimes you just gotta shoot something to take home!"
Hunting,3c7jbo,3fingerapache,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:11:59 2015 UTC,"There's also the issue of Conservation. Taking a doe instead of a buck helps even out the population.  Lots of hunters want a buck. They want the rack, the prestige. The meat is secondary. Taking only bucks will skew the population and be bad for the deer and for hunters."

One other suggestion....if still don't see great grouping with that ammo, you might try another bullet size/type/brand.  Sometimes certain bullets just don't group well in certain guns."
Hunting,3c71nu,SomeTechDude,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the input.  I like the idea of trying a few different brands/sizes/types while I am practicing too.  Better to experiment before the season starts for sure.  I have only put about 60 rounds through the rifle so far, and of those about 20 at 100  yards, so it is most likely still user error.  That said, I  have gotten things tight enough at 50 yards that i think I can start to get useful information with different ammo.    Also, just in case anyone is wondering, I am shooting out of a Savage Axis II, which from everything I read is going to be much more accurate than I am."
Hunting,3c71nu,skierboy07,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:55:02 2015 UTC,This is the best advice in here yet.  Different rifles are going to like different bullet weights/velocities/etc etc.  Buy as many varieties of ammo as you can afford and see what groups best
Hunting,3c71nu,Medic7816,5,Sun Jul 5 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"It is an excellent idea to shoot cheaper ammo during the off season. Anything that will get you more trigger time with your rifle is a good idea. Shoot as much as you can with the cheaper stuff, then like you said, four to six weeks before the season, rezero for your chosen hunting loads.   The tight groups at 50 yards and the bigger groups at 100 could be for a couple reasons. As you have said, it definitely could be user inexperience. The solution to that is trigger time. Try some different ammo as well. It could be that your rifle just doesn't like the load that you are shooting and is not stabilizing them well. What kind of rifle and scope setup are you running? It could be a loose scope, or just a low quality one that often come in cheap package deals.   Another thing to keep in mind for longer range sessions is heating up your barrel. Thin profile hunting barrels aren't designed to shoot long strings. If you are shooting too fast, the barrel can heat up and accuracy can take a nose dive. Once you have selected a hunting load, shoot five shots or so at the same bullseye over the course of 15 minutes. One shot every three minutes will keep the barrel from heating up, and will give you an accurate idea of what that first, cold bore shot will be in the woods."
Hunting,3c71nu,Medic7816,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"Awesome response, thanks!  I'm shooting a stock Savage Axis II, which comes with this weaver scope in 3-9 x 40.  Not the best, but it seems decent enough for a beginner keeping things at 100 yards max.  I did have to replace the scope with a warranty repair myself, but it was really basic, just reusing the rings.  It feels solid and the reticle stays put.  If my 100 yard+ shots don't get better it will be something to check out.  I do think the simplest answer is that it is the shooters fault at this stage.  I should mention I haven't ever used a rear support shooting from the bench, which obviously should improve things and will probably be something I start doing on my next trip to the ""range""  which is the woods at my parents' house.  The barrel heating is something I had read about.  I  didn't think it was impacting me, as I tend to shoot fairly slow with the bolt gun, taking maybe a minute in between shots for 4 shots, then waiting probably 5-10 before shooting the next group.  But based on what you are saying maybe I should slow it down even more.  Once I get my plinking .22 I will have something fun to do in between shots also.  So far I have been figuring if the barrel isn't hot to the touch (too hot to handle) then it is probably still accurate.  Is there a good rule of thumb?"
Hunting,3c71nu,Medic7816,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:02:04 2015 UTC,"A thin profile barrel can hear up suprisingly quickly, though I doubt that is the issue. Most likely trigger time will solve the issue quickly. If you really want some good, cheap practice buy some snap caps. They are fake rounds that allow you to dry fire the weapon without damaging anything.  Practice with those at the range to get your form down without worrying about recoil. Focus on firing 20, perfect shots with the snap cap, then fire one round of live ammunition. Do another 20 perfect dry fires. Fire one live round. Repeat as needed. Great practice, cheap fun."
Hunting,3c71nu,WikiWarrior55,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:20:46 2015 UTC,"That is a neat idea with the snap caps.  I've practiced dry firing in my house, but it is generally aiming at something outside a window and not from a good firing position.  I just do it to practice target acquisition and to hopefully minimize recoil anticipation, which I am definitely guilty of after a couple shots of .308.  Snap caps on range day, or even dry firing in between shots to practice maintaining a steady base sounds like a fantastic idea."
Hunting,3c71nu,PeanutNore,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"A note on reducing anticipation of breaking the shot. One of the mental games I play, because shooting is mostly mental, is to imagine your target. Imagine that nice 8 point whitetail walking into your shooting lane, to the point where you can see see his ears twitching and steam from his nostrils. Imagine the elevation of your heart rate and breathing, and how you would feel knowing that this is the deer you are going to harvest. Then start blocking all that out. Block out the size of the rack, then block out everything but that near shoulder, then block out everything other than the crease behind his front leg, about one third up the width of his body. Focus only on that one square inch of hair. Block out the pounding heart and rapid breathing. Now is not the time for excitement, that comes later. Breath, squeeze and break the shot. I can run those scenarios through my head at the range, when I'm at work, when I'm mowing my lawn or when I'm sitting in my blind. If you have your mind trained to mentally block it all out, when that deer does show up, your body will do what it has been conditioned to do. Practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect."
Hunting,3c71nu,Snowboarder12345,3,Mon Jul 6 01:03:30 2015 UTC,"You can use smaller rifles to practice, things like 1022's or anything in a plinking caliber.

It will be to get extra practice on basic marksmanship skills, and also something that my wife will enjoy shooting too, and of course for way less cost per round.   I still want to get as proficient as possible with the .308 so I will be ready for anything during hunting season.  I want to get as tight as possible off a bench, then work on standing and sitting, and also getting lots of practice shooting targets from my treestand."
Hunting,3c71nu,Vthunter557,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:00:22 2015 UTC,You can find a 10/22 new for like $180. But since you are using an Axis for deer season you might want to get a Savage Mark II which has the same trigger system as the Axis and you'll get practice with the bolt action as well.
Hunting,3c71nu,bigdogle,3,Mon Jul 6 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"Practice general shooting with something like a .22 because you can put thousands of rounds through it at low cost. At that point you just need to shoot your hunting rifle enough to know how it shoots, you can use cheap ammo for that. Once hunting season rolls around get in a couple days at the range where you use the ammo you will hunt with so that you get a feel of how they shoot and where they land at various distances. This should help you get more comfortable with shooting, as well as keep costs to a minimum."
Hunting,3c71nu,crackaboyjohnson,2,Sun Jul 5 16:54:18 2015 UTC,"you may be able to save up to 10c per shot if you shop online: I see it for 90 cents below:   http://www.gunbot.net/ammo/rifle/308/   Do you plan to shoot 150 grain or 180 grain ? If you want to practice with an eye towards hunting, it might be best to keep the bullet weight the same. Aerodynamics can vary greatly, so if you are shooting core-lokt that they are all about terminal ballistics and not very much about external. So if you want to shoot FMJ's then find spitzers and not boat-tailed bullets, to best simulate the same results.  Best of luck with your hunt"
Hunting,3c71nu,crackaboyjohnson,2,Sun Jul 5 20:41:36 2015 UTC,"I am looking at a lot of online sources for many different types of ammo.  The shipping cost so far has been an impediment.  I am trying to minimize the impact of shipping costs by possibly purchasing 100-200 rounds at a time, but I need to be pretty confident in what I am getting if I am making that kind of investment.  After reading reviews of cheap stuff like Tula steel cased ammo I am leaning towards sticking with something other than lowest-cost.  I have found some decent deals on mil-spec 7.62 x 51, which is an option since I will be shooting on private property.  I am assuming the ballistic quality will be as high with these as a hunting round like Core Lokt or Winchester Super X.  Also, it looks like my local Wal Mart carries Winchester Super X for $17.99.  If I can get decent groups with that it may replace Core Lokt as my default as it is 10% less and locally available."
Hunting,3c71nu,wellbeyond,2,Sun Jul 5 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"Here's what I did for my moose hunting trip.it might be a little different from your your hunting trip (I'm assuming deer) because with this you really only have one shot and that basically was the difference between getting one or not. I had to do a lot of prep for this trip. Weeks and weeks of firing standard ammo nothing too fancy, and cleaning and maintenance every time I took it out. Then about a month before the trip I switched over to the fancy stuff. I started off with some fusion loads but they weren't the right fit so I switched over to Hornady superperformance and those were amazing. At 7mm they were dead on at 200 yards every time. And that's what I went with. I guess what I'm trying to say is its deer hunting, there is no need to go all out and heck you could really just go with any normal ammo (excluding surplus) most likely you won't go past 100 yards like you said. In the end use what you feel like, practice like normal but remember hunting is fun and it should remain fun don't over do it. Sorry for making this so long it's the only way I knew how to put it"
Hunting,3c71nu,ruskeeblue,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late to the party here, but I would have one bit of advice.  Cheap ammo for practice is great, no problem there.  I might have an issue with the grouping though.  When I got my last rifle, I already had the scope, so they just mounted and bore sight for me.  They didn't tighten the screws all the way, so the scope bounced around when I was trying to sight it in.  So I suggest putting it in a vise, and putting a few rounds through it to make sure your scope isn't bouncing around.  Also, practice at 100 yards.  When you're on point at 100, 50 is easy, it'll just impact a little bit higher.    The other thing is that, every once in a while, you'll get a lemon.  I've never seen it myself, but I've heard of it a few times.  Each rifle has a performance mark that it should do with quality ammo.  So if everything is good with your scope and you're using good ammo, you've put it in a vice and still getting 4-6 inch groups, call Savage and tell them.  They will probably take the rifle back and check it out for you.  4-6 inch groups at 100 yards is unacceptable from any rifle whatsoever."

Hunting,3c6ipz,44r0n0wnz,4,Sun Jul 5 08:27:39 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to first find an experienced shooter to show you the ropes. The next thing would be to sight in your rifle on a bench. The bench helps to take out all the errors your body might add to the shot. Once you are positive your gun is in good working order you can begin to find out what you yourself need to correct to avoid fouling the shot. After you are sufficiently sighted in, then you might try shooting from various positions you may find yourself in during a hunt. Practice a lot. Fire lots of rounds. Shoulder your rifle and take it back down over and over so that you get used to acquiring the sights. I would further advise that you may not be ready to go hunting this year. Practice your shooting until you are proficient enough to judge distances and make ethical kills. Again a mentor can help with this. Do not ever take a shot you are not confident in. Do not ever shoot unless you are sure of your target and what is behind it. That means having eyes on the entire animal. Noises and shaking bushes are not targets. Either eat or donate to be eaten whatever you kill. Hunting is an extremely pleasurable pastime and a huge responsibility. Be safe and responsible. There is so much more to this than buying a gun and walking off into the woods. A good start is a hunter safety course. Game identification, ballistics, conservation, etc. are also good topics to explore."

Shoot at various ranges to get an idea of the curve that your gun shoots, try for instance 50 - 100 - 150, and then when your sure you can make a shot, challenge yourself to try something new. Try out a few kneeling positions to find what's comfortable for you, stand, heck try out prone, who knows you may get the chance while hunting. Blow through a truckload of target ammo, but most importantly before you hunt try out a few hunting loads and practice a bit with the one you plan to use they will all shoot a bit different."

Even though the guy who mounted the scope probably bore-sighted it, it still could be off by enough that you won't be able to hit the paper at 100 yards. Once you've got it adjusted to the point that you can hit the paper at 100 yards (should only take 1 or 2 rounds at 25 yards), fine-tune it at your preferred distance (i.e. 100 yards).

Last year I turned down a buck at 30 yards because I wasn't sure I could put the arrow in the vitals and now I feel good out to 40 yards. Shoot every day you possibly can and keep good form and you'll be set for the season. Good luck!"

To heavy, to slow, etc. they also focused TOO MUCH on big box store sales and fell out of the top tier bows. It's not that they made bad bows, just not as good as their competition. Today, their top range of bows are right up there with Mathews and elite IMO."

Enjoy the Cruzer man, it's a great bow. I can't stop selling them. I can't find a bad thing to say about them other than when people dry fire them it usually requires new cams. The posts get sheared right off. Easy way to avoid that is always use a release and always have an arrow when you draw it back.  And don't let your friends touch it!  Edit: get your peep tied in.

Its really hard to get deer hunters to take you out to their special spots, they worry about filling their tag, and adding another hunter threatens that.    Look for more and more public land.

Starting from nothing, no family hunting tradition, no access to family land is an obstacle not familiar to a lot of hunters.  I found my biggest barrier was access to hunting land.  I had a former co-worker who allowed me access to his family land to help me get my feet wet and I had to rely on possibly being able to hunt with friends of friends whenever they had the time or desire to hunt on their own shaky land access. I did not get a deer my first three years of hunting due to inexperience, lack of land access, and well, hunting is hunting.  I have got deer the last two years, including my first buck last year (mount should be done any day now).  This year I'm leasing some land and I'm pretty darn excited about having my own dedicated spot. Take small steps, there is a lot to learn, but just the fact you are concerned about ""doing it right"" shows your head is in the right place.  Luckily there is so much information on the the internet (youtube especially) that can be a great asset for techniques and protocol.  Remember, hunting is a challenge most of all."

And what is the best ways to mitigate it.   Don't take shots at longer ranges.  Make sure you get lead tipped hunting rounds. Surplus fmj ammo is illegal and unethical for hunting.

Hunting,3c49us,MotoEnduro,4,Sat Jul 4 17:38:39 2015 UTC,Make sure you read the regs book.
Hunting,3c49us,zachbrevis,5,Sat Jul 4 17:42:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, FMJ ammo is NOT appropriate for deer hunting. It won't expand or mushroom, which means the bullet won't transfer energy into the animal and it won't cause much tissue damage to the vital organs. A .223 may be legal in some states but it's not the best choice for a beginner unless you can get close. You're better off buying a single shot H&R or Rossi in a .243, 7mm-08, .25-06, .270, .308, .30-06, etc. with pointed soft point hunting ammunition.  Shooting at a game animal is different than range work -- you have adrenaline, natural camouflage (blends with your background and deceives the eye), and a moving target.  Deer tend to move at dawn and dusk, so lighting may not be optimal.  They also tend to stick to areas where there are trees, tall grass, corn fields, brush, etc. which further obfuscates your view. That's why it's called hunting, you are supposed to get close and make an ethical kill.  Good luck!"
Hunting,3c49us,GrittyHandjob,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:37:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info and insight
Hunting,3c49us,sirbrown22,3,Sun Jul 5 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"Both the Mosin and AR come with their own challenges.  There are several good .223 loads that turn it from marginal to adequate. The Nosler Partition and Barnes TSX to be specific. Keep ranges to about 50 yards, less because of ballistics, more because you really need to place that shot. As long as you place the shot well, you'll get an ethical kill, no question. You can easily mount a scope to it, which will greatly help you in low light, which is when you're most likely to get something.  As for the Mosin, since you're working without a scope, you're going to have issues in low light, and you may have issues placing an ethical shot at ranges past 75 yards or so. You also need to find a good load. Hornady makes a 150gr SST, that'd be my pick. I've shot several deer with a 180gr SST .30-06, and it works well.   Since both are limiting your range in one way or another, I personally would take the AR for two main reasons. 1, that Mosin will be hanging on every single bush and branch while you try and drag your deer out, and 2, I would value having some magnification and low light help over the horsepower of the Mosin. I know a lot of guys are iffy about the .223 for deer, and some states don't allow it, but I've seen a number of good, clean kills with premium .223 loads. It all comes down to shot placement.   I'm sure this goes without saying, but no matter which one you pick, make sure you practice often and are comfortable with it, so you can place an ethical shot."
Hunting,3c49us,ourguns,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:03:47 2015 UTC,Thank you I just didn't think the 223 would be good because I've been taught a told that a good ethnical kill was impossible with it on large game. I'm defenitly way better with it then my mosin though. I'll have to check colorado regs and see if it's legal to use
Hunting,3c49us,Sjedda,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:33:02 2015 UTC,"This is 100% spot on.  Shot placement is the most important thing.  A good 60grain Nosler Partition from your 223 will be an ethical kill.  In addition to what he said, it is very hard to find good hunting rounds for a mosin.  Most of what you find is military surplus FMJs which don't expand and give you the killing power you need for a deer.  Check your regs and make sure your all legal.  I know in Wyoming 223 is legal as long as it is a 60grain or high and not an FMJ.  Good luck and happy hunting!"

Hunting,3c2k9c,ri7ani,17,Sat Jul 4 15:35:38 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this rifle is known for its subpar barrel. The barrel will heat very fast and lose the zero. Take it to the range and see if it shoots straight after a couple of rounds. It will shoot straight on the first round for sure but after the first round you'll see that the bullets will hit higher and higher to the left or to the right. Woodsmaster have a bad rep. They were made for hunting and not for fun. If you simply want to hunt with it then you're set since theoretically you need one shot of 30-06 for deer but if you want to hone your skills at the range and have fun with it you might as well buy another rifle. i hope yours will be ok though. Google reviews on it and see for yourself

If it has been well cared for and cleaned then you shouldn't have any trouble with it cycling reliably on game day.  Good for woods ranges."

I'm using a bushnell which is cheap ($250.00) but works fine for bowhunting and riflehunting.  It is technically good out to 1000 yards, but you will have a hell of a time getting a return on non reflective surfaces (animals) past 200.  I can range vehicles and such out to 800, and large trees out to 600 yards.  It also does angle compensation which is important (especially for archers).

TBR is true ballastics range which takes into account the angle your at (which is good if your hunting high in a tree stand or shooting up/down a hill). It has fantastic glass and also has red cross hairs so it's easy to see in low light situations. When I was doing research I found the Vortex to be the other choice (great reviews and lifetime warranty). I went with the Leupoid. I bought mine for $400 but I see the price has dropped since. There are many (cheaper) alternatives but I wanted the best of the best.

Kids love finding antlers thus I leave them for the kids. There is also the nutritional benefits for critters so for that reason some should always be left."

Hunting,3c2qmz,mtyp,3,Sat Jul 4 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"I just went through this process myself not long ago.  Some observations:   People have opinions on guns.  Strong ones.  Like Ford vs. Chevy strong. Practically all modern rifles are capable of taking a deer at 200 yards.  This should cover 95% of what you do with your rifle.  Don't listen to the guys in the forums who obsess about 800 yard shots on one leg. For similar reasons, .308 and 30-06 are both fine choices for caliber.  308 is slightly cheaper and 30-06 is slightly more versatile.  If you ever want to hunt bear, you may want to get a larger gun anyway. You can do worse than going to a gun store, holding a bunch of rifles, and seeing which one ""suits"" you best.  You'll know when you hold it."
Hunting,3c2qmz,sf_gun_nut,2,Sun Jul 5 00:33:55 2015 UTC,go with a tikka t3 and a diamondback. i think that'll run you around or slightly over your 1000 budget.

Hunting,3c2qmz,bigdogle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like my Weatherby.  They make a heavy barreled threat response and varmint special model (same barrel and action but different stocks) in .308 that you could find for less than $700. Good scope and mounts will bring you to about $1K. 22"" barrel. Granted, they are 8.75 lbs. bare, but they would be a lot of fun to shoot in the off season and just fine for a tree stand (so long as you are properly seated and supported).  With respect to gear? Layers that breathe and retain heat (wool or high tech synthetic) with a waterproof shell.  You don't need a lot of fancy gear.  Good clothes, sharp knife, canteen, sandwich and deer tags. Keep it simple."

You could get yourself some decent glass (Zeiss) on it, too.  I fancy a lighter Kimber m84L in 30-06 but then I do a lot of walking out west. There aren't enough trees to put stands in. Don't worry about the rifle weight too much if you're in a stand. Savage Classic is an good all-around rifle; excellent for the price.  Also, Remington isn't as good as it used to be, IMHO."

Hunting,3c13mg,jack732,6,Fri Jul 3 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"First step in California is a hunter's safety course.  This is a requirement to obtain a hunting license.  You can usually take this course for a fee from a firearms retailer.   Next step would be to determine what you want to go hunting for.  I'm a california hunter as well, and I tend to go after upland game birds, as there are plenty of places to go (although the drought has really hurt numbers).  Duck hunting is also very good in california as it is a major thoroughfare for migration.  Big game is a bit more of a hassle in cali because of the lottery system.  Once you've figured out what you want to do, you need to get equipped for it.  This would include the proper firearms, ammunition, licenses, stamps, and other gear.  Keep in mind a lot of places in California require non-toxic ammunition to be used.  The equipment is going to vary a lot depending on what you are after.  Next up is location.  California has tons of public land, but it also has tons of hunters on that public land.  I recommend using private land, it is surprisingly easy to find farmers or other land owners that will let you hunt on their land.  I hunt for pigs in napa county, in exchange for occasionally assisting in repairing fences and reporting broken fencing when I'm hunting or scouting.  Just make some cold calls to land owners in areas you might be interested in hunting in.  Always have a plan, make sure people know where you are going and when you plan on being back, always carry water with you.    If you have any more specific questions feel free to let me know."

My friends and I took the hunting safety course through a local community gun club. You have a choice between the full day course and test at the end, or read through the material online (practice test on each part) and then do a shorter four hour course and test. Be aware that if you do not read the online stuff and opt for the short course you will NOT pass. Period. It's easy enough and well worth the knowledge imho, even if you never go hunting."

Hunting,3c13mg,Eric-Varminter,2,Sat Jul 4 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"Check out the DFG web site for a schedule of hunter ed courses. If it fits with your schedule, for your stage, I'd recommend the ""traditional"" courses over the on-line. The traditional class format has time for you to ask all your questions. (The four hour review is much more compressed.) FYI: If you decide to go the on-line route, heed the comments about the courses booking up -- you need to book your spot well in advance. (Traditional courses tend to be less crowded.) After the basic course is in the bag, you might also check out the DFG site for advanced hunter-ed courses. They have a bit higher fees, but lots of info and guidance one species at a time. good luck & stay safe!  Edit: I forgot to mention that the on-line materials no longer include the ""California"" section that is at the back of the hardcopy booklet. There are about a dozen questions on the final exam from that section and they tend to be the narrowly specific ones (how many yards, how many shells, what hours, etc). The on-line course used to have the same info but it seems to have gone away. Instructors aim to cover it during the review -- but, if you go the on-line route,  might be best if you can contact your instructor in-advance to see if you can arrange get the booklet in advance. (not an issue for traditional courses.)"

Hunting,3c13mg,baseacegoku,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:12:21 2015 UTC,"I'm new to hunting this year and just took the hunter's safety course here in WA. I opted for the online course with the in person field day at the end. It was fine, the folks that ran field day were great and I learned a lot from both the online course and the field day (and despite being relatively familiar with firearms, I found a lot of great information in the online course... wish I'd taken it long ago just for general firearms knowledge).  If I had the time available, however, and was going to do it over again, I'd opt to do the three days of pre-field day classes in person rather than online. I think the material warrants being there in person, being able to ask questions and being able to digest the material gradually rather than cram through it all at once as you can do online.  You'll probably get a lot out of either online or in person, but I'd go for the latter if you can schedule it."
