michaelbaygifs,3e0ci9,TheRealBramtyr,30,Tue Jul 21 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"This is the Hardtack I Poplar thermonuclear detonation, a 'clean' unboosted 9.3 megaton version of the B-41 warheads which yielded 25mt.  This is the 5th largest yield set off by the United States. The fireball you see expanding in a split second is about 3 miles in diameter. Big badda boom."
michaelbaygifs,3e0ci9,BesottedScot,11,Tue Jul 21 03:58:01 2015 UTC,Its a lot redder than I thought it would be.
michaelbaygifs,3e0ci9,TheRealBramtyr,3,Tue Jul 21 07:29:07 2015 UTC,"This is viewed from many miles away, so the light is passing through some thick atmosphere, which scatters more of the bluer light, similar to how the sun gets its color during a sunset. I'd also factor in the camera being used might be favoring it with a reddish color."
michaelbaygifs,3e0ci9,dotpan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"I'd also factor in the camera being used might be favoring it with a reddish color   This seems to be the case.

michaelbaygifs,3e0ci9,krelin,4,Tue Jul 21 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"What does ""clean"" mean in this context?"
michaelbaygifs,3e0ci9,TheRealBramtyr,6,Tue Jul 21 16:07:09 2015 UTC,"The yield of a thernonuclear device can be increased by using fissile material in the tamper (rather than lead or steel, 'clean')— which forms the shell around the warhead, which to my understanding slows the expansion of the detonation by a few microseconds and allows a greater quantity of the hydrogen fuel to fuse. A fissile tamper though greatly increases the fallout. For example, the Tsar Bomba, had it used a fissile tamper, could have increased its yield to 100 megatons."
michaelbaygifs,3e0ci9,ThirdFloorNorth,5,Tue Jul 21 16:14:44 2015 UTC,"the Tsar Bomba, had it used a fissile tamper, could have increased its yield to 100 megatons   From 50. It was already a 50 megaton bomb, the largest nuclear detonation... ever.  It was detonated at 4 kilometers (2.48 miles) up.   The fireball reached nearly as high as the altitude of the release plane and was visible at almost 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) away from where it ascended. The subsequent mushroom cloud was about 64 kilometres (40 mi) high (over seven times the height of Mount Everest), which meant that the cloud was above the stratosphere and well inside the mesosphere when it peaked. The cap of the mushroom cloud had a peak width of 95 kilometres (59 mi) and its base was 40 kilometres (25 mi) wide.  All buildings in the village of Severny (both wooden and brick), located 55 kilometres (34 mi) from ground zero within the Sukhoy Nos test range, were destroyed. In districts hundreds of kilometers from ground zero wooden houses were destroyed, stone ones lost their roofs, windows and doors; and radio communications were interrupted for almost one hour. One participant in the test saw a bright flash through dark goggles and felt the effects of a thermal pulse even at a distance of 270 kilometres (170 mi). The heat from the explosion could have caused third-degree burns 100 km (62 mi) away from ground zero. A shock wave was observed in the air at Dikson settlement 700 kilometres (430 mi) away; windowpanes were partially broken to distances of 900 kilometres (560 mi).[13] Atmospheric focusing caused blast damage at even greater distances, breaking windows in Norway and Finland. The seismic shock[verification needed] created by the detonation was measurable even on its third passage around the Earth.[14] Its seismic body wave magnitude was about 5 to 5.25.[12]   Wikipedia, Tsar Bomba  That was at 50 megatons. If they hadn't have nerfed it, it was capable of double that. If that doesn't give you a frisson, something is wrong."

michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,CannedEther,5,Sat Jul 11 02:46:14 2015 UTC,"From my experience, you're pretty much at a tipping point.   Level 17 myself and i'm working on my backlog before setting sail to Skellige."
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,MobiusF117,3,Fri Jul 10 06:32:20 2015 UTC,"Do you know if it's gonna cost 1k every time you travel between Novigrad and Skellige? Or is that a one time payment?   I can't afford to do it more than once right now so I figured I'd do the other main quest and some contracts first. But at the same time, I don't want to level up too much. I just reached 13 and it seems like the perfect time to go to Skellige."
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,CannedEther,5,Fri Jul 10 06:40:43 2015 UTC,It's a one time payment :) You can fast travel between them at any time so don't feel like you need to do everything in Velen first (Although I did do literally everything in Velen first on my first playthrough so I totally understand..)
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,Cookindinner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:33:46 2015 UTC,I'm just worried about over leveling. I read a post on this sub I think where someone mentioned that the game is a little hard at first but becomes very easy really fast if you do a lot of side quests. I'm trying to strike a balance so I'm always a little below the recommended level.
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,CannedEther,3,Fri Jul 10 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"I did the quests to get the master crafters at least 8 levels below recommended for each. It was pretty hard, but I was able to manage it after a few tries."
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,SlickArcher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:01:46 2015 UTC,I raised the difficulty cause I leveled up too fast with all the side quests.

michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,TheOtherBarry,3,Fri Jul 10 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"Like i said, havent sailed yet. First time i heard of the cost altogether...  Although in theory you could just hop in a boat yourself and sail to a harbor. Or just fast travel."

michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,CannedEther,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:07:07 2015 UTC,"I'd go ahead and sail if I were you because you'll find some quests in Skellige with a lower level requirement than the quest to sail to Skellige, which is weird."
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,WIENERPUNCH,2,Fri Jul 10 14:09:08 2015 UTC,"Once you pay once you can fast travel freely. Don't do what I did and go back to velen halfway through a story quest though, if you do it at the wrong time Yennifer gets pissed."

michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,Manezinho,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:49:59 2015 UTC,Fast travel doesn't cost you anything.  The initial voyage is a one-time thing.
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,GreenLightLost,3,Fri Jul 10 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"Yep. Nearly level 20, 30 hours in. Nearly done with my sidequests before Skellige. But I have a bunch of locations to uncover and I think there might be some treasures left for me to find.   I think I might spend another 10 hours or so just doing that. :3"
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,Falodir,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:21:58 2015 UTC,"I'm at the same point, level 17 and trying to complete side quests. However, I still have a ton of quest marks, notice boards and undiscovered locations to cover. I feel like if I do those I'm going to be level 30 once I finally sail to Skellige.  I can't complain about the overwhelming amount of stuff the open world has to offer. Seriously, this is like the best RPG ever while ALSO being a fantastic open world. Don't see a combination like that too often (take notes Bethesda). But there's just something off about the game balance. It's seemingly impossible to keep up with the recommended levels of each quest unless you systematically only do quests and shut yourself from exploring the open world. Killing a witcher contract 6 levels below you is no challenge."
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,JustAnotherTowaway,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:17:56 2015 UTC,"As with any good RPG, you have a choice in what you do and what you dont do. If you play it for the story, you should be able to do the bare minimum of sidequests and still be able to finish the game.  This was something that bothered me about DA:I, when you didnt really have a choice and you were required to do sidequests in order to progress."
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,MobiusF117,3,Fri Jul 10 11:47:21 2015 UTC,"Thats the bear school armour either the first or second level so im guessing hes between 15-25. For the quests just roam around towns and do witcher contracts, its what i did and i became a little over leveled before i reached most of the main quests :)"
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,anxhelino1234,2,Fri Jul 10 04:24:40 2015 UTC,"Would you recommend doing the main quests over leveled or under? At 12, I'm currently doing missions suggesting level 13 to 16. Anything below that feels way too easy but tedious. Will that change as I level up?"
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,CannedEther,2,Fri Jul 10 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"I find that you can be about 4 levels under the recommended level for a quest and youll be fine, Id say do them when youre roughly around the required level since you get the challenge the game is supposed to give you"
michaelbaygifs,3cq9lg,anxhelino1234,2,Fri Jul 10 10:54:05 2015 UTC,Huh? I'm at like 40 hours and I'm lvl 14...Im probably spending too much time staring at pretty textures and fucking around trying to cliff dive off things that arent cliff diveoffable.

michaelbaygifs,3c7enw,FireHazard11,16,Mon Jul 6 08:16:13 2015 UTC,"No. It is deceptively hard to kill small animals by dropping them. The smaller and lighter an animal is the lower it's terminal velocity will be. It doesn't matter if you fall from 10 miles up if you hit the ground at 10 mph.   For comparison, a mouse is small enough to be immune to fall damage and a cat will survive but sustain broken bones from any height as long as they have time to land on their feet. So a hamster which is only slightly bigger than a mouse will definitely not be killed by a 10 foot fall."

michaelbaygifs,3c7enw,theBergmeister,6,Sun Jul 5 20:39:57 2015 UTC,"No. That hamster is fine.  It is deceptively hard to kill small animals by dropping them. The smaller and lighter an animal is the lower it's terminal velocity will be. It doesn't matter if you fall from 10 miles up if you hit the ground at 10 mph. For comparison, a mouse is small enough to be immune to fall damage and a cat will survive but sustain broken bones from any height as long as they have time to land on their feet. So a hamster which is only slightly bigger than a mouse will definitely not be killed by a 10 foot fall."

michaelbaygifs,3bmsxu,MattAdams53,4,Tue Jun 30 22:09:53 2015 UTC,Using the technology they do with Golf and Football I wonder if they could incorporate visuals like this into a game realtime. Detecting trajectory and etc and applying special effects or even just replays getting the treatment. Would certainly livin things up. Turn the tide back around for Baseball.
michaelbaygifs,3bmsxu,Heratiki,3,Tue Jun 30 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"Haha, it's probably quite possible, I'm not entirely sure about realtime, but replays could be done quickly.  MLB Stat Cast already tracks a ton of information about plays such as ball speed, velocity off the bat, and time it took for a player to get to the ball along with motion tracking those stats to the players, all that would need to be done is swap out explosions for the default graphics."
michaelbaygifs,3bmsxu,Heratiki,3,Tue Jun 30 16:10:41 2015 UTC,This is what I'm thinking. I mean look at NFL fields and the lines on the field that are 100% digital tracked in real time and added in an immediate processing step. If that's possible with so many people on the field it's totally possible with this.
michaelbaygifs,3bmsxu,Dinosauringg,2,Tue Jun 30 16:17:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair those lines don't move constantly, they're static lines that are added to different positions on the field"
michaelbaygifs,3bmsxu,Heratiki,2,Tue Jun 30 18:08:52 2015 UTC,Yes but there is enough processing that they exclude and include all of the players and different camera angles including moving cameras.

michaelbaygifs,3ax4n3,RefundsNotAccepted,3,Wed Jun 24 17:56:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! I'll definitely make more similar things for ya'll!   I wouldn't mind making the tutorial but I don't wanna come off as ""oh yeahh so famous time to make a tutorial to show how sick I am"", but for this video specifically, I used Adobe After Effects and the stock footage Action Essentials and plugin Optical Flares. Video Copilot also has amazing tutorials for using the stock footage and plugin, this one being one of the best for explosions.   Additionally, paying attention to detail is what makes visual effect videos be ""wow"". The reflection of the explosions were on of the big things, where I duplicated the layer, flipped it horizontally, turned down opacity, and used the built in ""directional blur"" effect to achieve it. Things like that are noticeable if they are not missing, but generally unnoticeable if they are there. Camera blur effect on explosions out of focus is another thing.   Sorry I can't cover specifics for now, but yeah Video Copilot Tutorials are definitely your best bet for explosive film making! I'll most probably continue making similar ""animal war"" videos and if a number of people ask, I'll definitely put a tutorial up! :) Happy video making and hope it goes well for the future!"

michaelbaygifs,3ax4n3,SufferingSaxifrage,3,Wed Jun 24 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"If you're into action/general fun, I'd say definitely go with checking out tutorials on Video Copilot, I feel like they are one of the bests online as they are fun, applicable (I've done tutorials with my own footage as opposed to having to download theirs), memorable (there are tutorials out there with so many detailed steps that I just forget them all afterwards), and accessible (some of his tutorials require some of his plugins but most of the time he avoids them). If not so much of an action person, they still have a solid amount of title screen tutorials which are good for learning too.  There are actually a lot of other good tutorials out there on Google and YouTube, I personally like video tutorials better because they are easier to remember, and if you're JUST starting out, I watched a crash course video, I forgot which one specifically, but stuff like this and this.   To be fully honest I don't think I'm that great, I'm sorta putting vids out there for learning's sake and learn something new every time, so of course consistently making new things whether for fun or serious, you'll most definitely learn things and the skill level will actually increase a lot faster than things like learning an instrument.   I still have a crazy amount to learn and I actually have many friends who know much more than me, but feel free to PM me in the future if you got any questions!

michaelbaygifs,3aq7gn,MinerDodec,53,Mon Jun 22 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"Can confirm.   My dad (being the genius that he is) was making a fire on New Years Eve, a few years ago, for the kids outside while people were coming over to the house. He was stacking the wood, but since it was dark outside, he put his Galaxy S3 in the fire pit to see what he was doing...  Me and my friends came out about 15 minutes later, and there was a big explosion right as we walked up to the fire with flames spewing everywhere. One of my friends almost got burned because they were standing so close, but thankfully she wasn't. After some investigation I realized what it was. A few minutes later my dad ran outside and asked ""Have you guys seen my phone?"" I then proceeded to stab it with the fire poker and gave it to him.  tl:dr My dad left his phone in the fire and it proceeded to blow up and almost injured a child"

Hidden Kingdoms is pretty much chased off of youtube, but BBC has some other nature clips Here  You can also go retro with all of the original Mutual of Omaha Wild Kingdom though it doesn't have the same cinematic feel.  You may also want to look at this request from a few weeks ago with a lot of potential that no one picked up when you get the itch for an encore"

This was probably shot on a camera that records an enormous amount of data (it's not uncommon to fill hundred of gigabytes on an SSD with pro cameras)  in slow motion so they couldn't just wait all day for this to happen. The hawk was probably brought from a zoo and the mouse was bought from some pet store.   That doesn't make it any less cool, though."
