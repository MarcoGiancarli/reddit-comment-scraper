VetTech,3e2b0c,muffjazz,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"Flash cards. As a rule i personally have extremely good memory for stuff like that, so all of my friends would come to me for ways to remember diseases and anatomical parts and so on. Flashcards worked for me and many other just because of repetition. Write the word on the front, definition on the back, and try to go through the whole pile (whether it be a chapter, a days worth, or months worth of words) and just go through them and say the definition for each without looking. If you get one wrong, put it back in the rotation until you get it right. Eventually it will be second nature. I also find ways to make the words relate to the definition.(For example, syncope means fainting. ""Syn"" sounds like ""sin"". This reminded me of hell. What is commonly related with hell/devil? Goats. You know what kind of animal is comically known to have a type that ""faints"". Goats. Therefore syn=sin=hell=goat=faint. Theres the connection. Its stupid but thats how my brain works.) I do this for about everything.    Another way to help is to straight up remember the root words. Know your prefixes, suffixes and root words and everything becomes so much clearer. (Cryp is commonly referring testicles, so that takes out a lot of the guesswork) and so on. Find what works for you. Repetition? Reading it aloud? Teaching other people? Writing everything down? Figure out how you learn best and it will all come so much easier! Feel free to PM me if you need help remembering something :)"
VetTech,3e2b0c,ameliagillis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'm nearly done with my first semester of vet tech courses, and am finishing up veterinary medical terminology now. Repetition, repetition, repetition. The book we're using is broken up into sections so you'll learn about a system or species in a chapter and it breaks everything down. It helps to learn roots, prefixes, and suffixes. That way if you get a word you don't know or have a defintion and need to provide a word (that's how the majority of our exams are set up) then you can use the parts to make the right word (hopefully).   Quizlet has an app you can download and use to study sets on the go. That's what I use when I'm waiting for an appt or between classes to keep myself on top of things and staying sharp.   I've got an A in my class now and am doing well, whereas more than half of my class is struggling to get a C. All of it is coming down to they don't know how to study and how much to study (hint: it's all the time)."

Most bags or packs have a strip or a spot that changes color when introduced to heat and steam (partially for that very reason) and it's pretty obvious when something hasn't been autoclaved. The doctors and techs should be paying attention to that sort of thing anyway, so out of all the mistakes, it's not the worst thing that could happen."

He believed that things would resolve themselves if he believed and gave the right nutrition and things like that. The owner isn't a bad guy at all he's just extremely misguided. He really does have the best intentions for his dog. I basically has to fight him to keep him out of the surgery (in a nice way)"

It's not our fault, we can't stop it, literally all we can do is be there to help. Last week, we had an adorable 8 week old kitten present with a diaphragmatic hernia that was having difficulty breathing and needed surgery. The owners couldn't afford it, so our staff scrambled to find somebody to foster the kitten if the owners were willing to surrender him, but they declined to do that and the kitten was euthanized. It broke our hearts, but in the end, we couldn't force the owners to give their cat away, and we couldn't allow the kitten to suffocate. Life isn't fair, we can only take what we're given, and that guy only got 8 weeks of life and a much kinder death than he would have gotten if he were living on the street in his condition. I know this is kind of sentimental, but focus on the good that your work does instead of the heartbreak that you were unable to prevent. Imagine a world where veterinary medicine isn't practiced and what would have happened to that woman and her cat. Instead you were able to tell her why her cat was sick, and put her cat to rest before her blood turned to poison and killed her. That woman was not happy with the outcome, but both she and her cat were better off because of your actions."

The only time I get upset is if there are only minor medical problems or none at all and the euthanasia actually happens. What I have always done to cope is either make peace with the situation in my own way or vent, but not to anyone else just to myself.

It's work worth doing and that's essentially your take-home pay. You'll be happier if you live very simply or have a partner that makes better money. If you specialize in animal research or a diagnostic laboratory, you'll probably make good money. Otherwise, if you're at a veterinary clinic, your pay will probably be so-so to how-can-I-live-on-this? There are always exceptions though."

Labs are longer and covered a variety of topics - we had anatomy and physiology where we worked with models as well as preserved specimens, surgery labs, clinical pathology labs, etc.  I worked during school and stuck with clinic afterwards. I'd definitely try and get in some places and observe! If you find somewhere you like you can let them know you'd like to apply later. Here is some info on VTS (Veterinary Technician Specialist) from NAVTA."
VetTech,3dfngs,rvtjess,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:23:18 2015 UTC,"This may wildly vary depending on the program you get into. Some are Monday through Friday, 9-5 with kennel shifts on the weekend, some are online at your own speed, some are a few nights a week but less hands on, etc. It just really depends on the program you choose. This will also wildly vary depending on your location and job saturation in the market. I got a job pretty quickly in a larger metropolitan area, and even when I lost that job I was only out of work for a week max. Now, my third clinic it took me several months of sending out resumes, filling out applications, and working interviews before I got a job offer, but I was working full time up until that point so I was never out of work. If you live in a more rural area, jobs may be harder to come by. You'll have better luck in a more suburban/urban area. You can specialize as a technician; however, I will say that you really need to do research into the potential in your area for specialists and which specializations will do well or are in high demand in your area. They are not cheap and are not easy to obtain and can take a few years to get, so you really need to make sure that this is a viable option for your area and that resources are even available to you.   Honestly, calling around to a few vet tech schools in your area will give you more definitive answers."
VetTech,3dfngs,theactualstephers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:34:09 2015 UTC,"It took me a year and half almost two years to get my prerequisite classes done because I couldn't afford to go full time. Usually it only takes a year for others. Once I got accepted into the vet tech program it's was two years. To get into the program it was very competeive. They accreted 20 students only out of 50. Your grades had to be b- or higher in science and math classes. I went to BAker college in Jackson, michigan. Make sure you go to a school that is competeive and doesn't just accept anyone. I know some schools that will accept anyone and I have seen some dumb careless people come out of those schools.  I got a job as a receptionist at a clinic while I was in school that way I had my foot in the door. There are a lot of clinics that will hire students for positions like reception or assistant or kennel help. Start looking now.  Even with a specialty I don't know if it is still high paying. A lot of the clinics that pay well are barely hiring at least in mi they are not. I know some clinics out here that pay 17+ an hour but they are never hiring. I would say in average, at least in MI, pay is 13.00 to 14.00. Which sucks but if you love your job that is what matters. I would say try hard to find a place with good benefits. I have a job with excellent benefits and great pto and retirement but I don't even make 13 yet. But with your degree you can eventually do other things like research or marketing. I plan on going back to school and getting a business or marketing degree so I can learn to work for a pharmaceutical company or idexx, or even a food comp. there are a lot of things that can open up for a technician when they actually work at it.

A lot of people screw up by thinking: ""What would I do at my clinic"", when they should really be asking ""What would the textbook say?""   Do not base your answer on something you would do in a clinic because it is the quickest, most convenient way. Your answer should be what the textbook tells you to do, even if it less practical and nobody really does it.   My coworker is an amazing technician, but failed the VTNE twice because she answered the questions practically. She gave me this advice before I took the test and it really helped."

In short, unlikely.  Average nationwide is 30k a year, but remember this includes those techs working for the military, federal government, pharmaceutical, national labs and universities who all have higher starting pay and pay scales than your average private practice.  In my state the average pay for credentialed technicians is 25k a year or 12 dollars an hour before taxes if you take no vacation time.  Remember you won't get anywhere near the average for your state within the first 5 years if you are in private practice.

VetTech,3d25jo,Neryian,2,Sun Jul 12 23:58:33 2015 UTC,"Vets have an outrageous college debt to income ratio.  Google ""Should I be a veterinarian?"" and start reading.  There are routes to make decent money in this field.  Getting into one of the major labs (Antech, Idexx), getting into a food or pharmaceutical company or going governmental.  Caution though, the food companies, drug companies and government agencies (outside of going active duty) don't hire fresh grads.  So you will need experience and lots of it.   Like u/ibattletherous said, you are going to need a roommate at least one if not more fresh out of school.  I don't know any single techs who live alone.  Hell after 10 years post grad and endless networking, I can honestly say I have never met a technician who isn't married to someone who makes 2-5 times what they do or who lives alone.   This job isn't about the money, cause lets be honest, if we wanted to make good money we would go into human medicine.  Which is what many technicians end up doing.  3 of my classmates are now pharmacy techs, 2 are human nurses, and 4 more are specialty techs in human medicine (2 radiology techs, a phelbotomist and a surgical tech).  That's from a class of 25.  4 others passed boards and left medicine altogether cause the job market is so sad.  So out of 25, only 12 of us are still in the field 11 years out.  Number one reason cited wasn't burn out or compassion fatigue, it was money.    Personally I love this field, but in reality if my husband lost his job, I would be out of it in a heartbeat unless I could get hired by Hills or Royal Canin or the local colleges as an instructor (lab isn't my thing and I have applied for 3 federal government jobs already).  He pays our bills, I pay for living expenses and childcare.  The reality of the situation is that you have to absolutely love this field and understand that you will be dirt poor to scraping by for the entirety of your career unless you get very lucky."

VetTech,3d25jo,SeeknDestroy55,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"I was fortunate enough to land a job in an emergency clinic before finishing my rvt program and getting my license. I purchased my first home 1 year working as a tech and I found out very quick it is impossible to live off a techs salary. I used my life savings to purchase my first home (25 years old) and had some left over. Every month I fall into my savings just to pay bills. My fiance has a great job making 50-60k a year and she is really who keeps up afloat. This will be my last year as I have graduated with a different degree and headed towards a different career that still deals somewhat with animals. Every time we get young tech students doing their ""work rotations"" I always tell them to really think about the salary. I barely break 25k a year and thats working 48-60 hours a week. It's a burnout. We all work our asses off and unfortunately we don't get paid enough for it. I understand that yes, these animals need us but we also have to make ends meet and live a quality life for ourselves. I know I am really straight forward but seriously, I wish I had someone tell me this before going to school for it (5 classes away from graduating.) Even becoming a vet isn't guaranteed a great icome. Almost all of them finish with at least 300k in debt. That's just to become a DVM. If you want to even think about becoming a radiologist, cardiologists, critical care vet, or oncologist you are looking at even more money and even more time dedicated to schooling. I had a doctor tell me ""if your willing to leave friends, family, and social life for 6-8 years, then go to vet school and specialize. If you are not, dont do it."" It's just a field which no government funding is provided. I know techs who have worked for 14 years and are barely making $18 an hour and thats pretty much where they will be capped at. It really does suck. Just think about the things you are willing to sacrifice because living paycheck to paycheck sucks. Bad."

I just moved to a new city recently and went through probably half a dozen working interviews/trial periods before settling down at my current clinic, which I absolutely adore.  Don't feel like you're being a whiner!  In this business, we all have to work so closely with our coworkers that it's absolutely essential to have people you ""click"" with, and a group where you feel welcome, if you're going to maintain your passion and enthusiasm long-term.   Each clinic has it's own ""culture"" and attitude, as a group.  Some clinics are like being trapped in the movie Mean Girls, and it's absolutely unbearable trying to tough it out at places like that.  Trust me, you'll think you can take it, convince yourself that the good things about the job make it worth trying to cowgirl up and not let it get to you...and it'll work, for awhile. Til one day when something pushes you too far, and you ragequit. lol or maybe that's just me...  As for how to politely turn down a job, I always tell them something like ""Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with you guys today! This is a great practice, but I don't think it's the place for me.  Best of luck finding a new tech!""  If pressed for a reason why it's not for me, I lie, lie, lie!  Make up something that is as far from something negative about the practice as you can come up with.  If it's a large, multi-doctor hospital, then it's not for you because you're looking for a small, single-doctor country practice.  If it's an ER, you are feeling too overwhelmed by the pace and don't think you could keep up with such a top-level practice.  The vet community is such a creepy-small world, and it's essential to not make enemies.  Swallow your conscience and come up with the shiniest ""It's not you, it's me"" lie you can put together!   Best of luck finding a new place to call home! :-)"

After doing a million working interviews for the first time after I've been at the same place for 6 years, I finally figured out the questions I need to ask and how to say no. First off, ask about everything that youd THINK all offices would have (do they place IVs and run fluids for sx, do they have AND use EKG/pulse ox, do they have their dental scaler setup in an appropriate room, etc.) After my first few working interviews with not wanting to waste anyone's time, I was very up front if there was something I wasnt comfortable with, or if I felt it wasn't a fit for me - team wise, workload, duties, what's expected of you. Even when I thought a place would work, I still told them I had a few other offers to consider or interviews to go to first. You just never know. Every place I turned down was very understanding and said if I changed my mind they would welcome me back. I really had no idea how much of this stuff varied per practice until the last 2 months.

VetTech,3ca7rr,Turelliax,2,Mon Jul 6 08:59:09 2015 UTC,"Most clinics dont really advertise on major website. Reason being is that most are small privately owned clinics and most job openings are shared by word of mouth through employees. Hospitals such as banfield and VCA have the funds to pay for hiring ads and application processing. The best advice I can give is to send out your resume and a cover leter to every hospital within your vicinity. This will really show them that you took the effort to reach out to them. If you arent needed at the time, they'll always remeber that one person who was interested and they will give you a call."

It's his dog and his property, that's the sad reality of it. Even calling animal control won't do much other then charge him for no licensing and no rabies vaccine. Often times owners get mad when you tell them how to raise their dog because it's pretty much like their child. I know of a gentlemen who shot their own dog in theyre backyard. I called the cops and literally nothing wad done. Nobody reported the gunshot and it really is a waste of time for the cops, especially if it isnt in their jurisdiction. Animal control could take the dog if their is true neglect and abuse, but it doesnt seem like thats the case. I know, it sucks ass."
VetTech,3c773d,SeeknDestroy55,3,Sun Jul 5 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"Actually /u/tigris474, I'm in a similar situation (less intense but still) and I was told that veterinary care is something that is required in order to have a pet, otherwise it's technically abuse.   I looked it up on animal control's site and you can call them and ask them to do a wellness check and if they find they are being abused they will take the dogs away.   So, there is something you can do. Also, you've already done a lot by talking to them about pet care and if they haven't listened they are technically abusing the animal by letting them be susceptible to disease and parasites etc."
VetTech,3c773d,Sleepyhead61,-2,Sun Jul 5 17:36:25 2015 UTC,Yea I'm gonna start threatening them. But they are just so fucking stupid. Like really really stupid.

Trust me, situations like this are not worth going to jail for or losing friends and creating enemies.  It seems like your really upset emotionally but just let animal control handle the situation. Hopefully your counties animal control is on top of things because where I'm from ""wellness"" checks are a joke."

Also, I'm assuming, you don't want to lose them as friends. I'd just leave it in animal control's hands. Let us know what happens though. I hope the dogs are okay."
VetTech,3c773d,wyndwalker99,-6,Sun Jul 5 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"Yea exactly. I'm to the point where I'm going to go in and treaten them. They will be empty threats, but it might work."
VetTech,3c773d,llamacatnarwhal,6,Sun Jul 5 18:10:54 2015 UTC,"You are a lifeline for the dog, and an educational asset for the family as long as you are a friend.  Do not alienate the family.  You can make an anonymous report of a menacing dog to the non-emergency police, and animal control will be forced to check on the family.  You are not the law.  Make appropriate reports, and let the proper authorities take care of it.  Edit: Additionally, I know how painful it is to watch uneducated people let their dogs breed like rabbits, and not bother to take care of the bitch or the pups.  It's awful, we see the cases where animals are no longer wanted or taken for granted (especially cats), and it angers us to no end.  You need to be in control of that anger, and keep a smile on your face because you cannot control what other people do with their property; you can only make yourself available to help with the outcome (provide information on low-cost vaccine clinics, spay/neuter clinics, or some cities even offer free pit-bull altering because of backyard breeding being a huge problem).  ""Breeding"" and animal care are highly sensitive topics, and I've found that keeping my opinions to myself but offering tangible, safe solutions in a non-confrontational or judgmental way has had a much better response from owners, and when that doesn't work, hand it over to animal control to knock some sense into the owner. It's hard, but what's at stake makes the effort to keep your cool and think about the animal's well-being, achievable.  I can tell you're an animal lover and you want what's best for the dog, so I know you can do it."
VetTech,3c773d,llamacatnarwhal,2,Sun Jul 5 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"Did she actually bite anyone? If so, you could always file a report. I know that it would be bad for the dog, but if you feel that this is escalating towards someone being seriously injured, it may be for the best. In my area, I believe most pets get a warning before they are confiscated by the authorities (beyond rabies confinement for 10 days). Maybe that would get the owners to start thinking about training, or at least basic veterinary care."
VetTech,3c773d,Lanaowl,3,Sun Jul 5 17:09:30 2015 UTC,"I want to do that. I think it's my next step, because there are small children in the house. Someone is going to get hurt soon."
VetTech,3c773d,Lanaowl,2,Sun Jul 5 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"At this point if I were you I would offer to pay to get her spayed and offer to take her there and back. It sounds like they don't want to pay for it, and maybe the only way to get it to happen is to pay for it yourself. Other than that it's just a crappy situation :/ good luck. It's sad when someone who isn't even the dogs owner has to advocate for the dog."
VetTech,3c773d,aquafemme,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"I want to spay and offer to train her, but if I do all that and they reap the benifits, and i do all the work, they will learn that it's okay to do this, someone will always help them. I can't do that. If I was to spay her and train her, she would be MINE, I'd love to take her, she's so pretty."
VetTech,3c773d,Kolfinna,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:08:41 2015 UTC,"At this point I feel like the spay is the important part. This dog will get pregnant if they do not spay her. Then there will be unnecessary puppies in a world where there are already animals at shelters being euthanized due to lack of space. She also needs to be trained but that's on them to train her. At this point if she has puppies and you didn't do anything about it it's on you, it's already been made clear that these people are incompetent in caring for their animal in that way."

VetTech,3byw9f,misterradio,3,Fri Jul 3 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"Sure, no problem.  I honestly think they make it sound really difficult to get in to discourage people who think being a tech is about hugging puppies and kittens all day.  I think it's good to ward off those people, but if you go through the whole process, there is a very good chance you will get in if you do everything right.  Don't be scared, and if you don't get in on your first try, try again, and get some experience volunteering in a shelter in the meantime.  Also, if you don't get in and don't have the pre-reqs for taking the test done (usually Biochem)...do them.  It will make your life easier.  You can also request to have an interview with one of the teachers.  I interviewed Ms. DePaolo before applying to the program for an English class I had to take, and she definitely remembered me when I was accepted, and it might have helped them choose me to come into the program.  Honestly, A LOT of the program is about getting you to pass the tests, and you may not ever use half of what you were taught in actual practice.  For example, Large Animal and Lab Animal (for me).  I'm glad I know how to handle exotics and draw blood from large animals now, but I really don't plan on ever using that knowledge.  So even if you think you're never going to have a use for something you're learning...it will be on a test.  Make full use of the labs, and ask questions.  Dr. Mac is awesome and full of knowledge about basically everything.  Ms. DePaolo and Ms. Gregory are great and always willing to help.  I don't know much about the new director who replaced Dr. Peter.  Ms. Terry...if she actually has a good side, get on it (not bitter at all /s).  For your internship, start looking early, and really, REALLY think about what you want to do in the future.  I was dumb and at first only applied to a prestigious, large practice.  Turns out they had extremely high turnover due to being profit driven, and I never had one supervisor/mentor that I could turn to.  It was actually really detrimental.  Once I went to a small place that only had two vets and five techs who had all been there long term, I learned so much more and was much better suited to be there.  There are some great larger practices if you think it would suit you to be in that environment, but you should really consider your best fit when looking for an internship.  Also network with your classmates and teachers."

VetTech,3br5ow,ilbcnul8ter,4,Wed Jul 1 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"I am still a CVT, and was working as one for 9 years before I made a change. I had moved to a new area 2 years ago. The job pickings were slim unless I wanted to commute into a very large city 45 minutes away.  I got a job closer to home. It didn't work out.  It was so awful there. Not knowing what else to do, I decided to open my own dog boarding and daycare facility.  I rent currently and am hoping to build on my property in the next year. I definitely don't rake in the cash yet with bills and trying to save for a build, but it's going well. I work A LOT. It's definitely not for everyone, but I've just started hiring some part time help and am getting away more."

I don't know why you want to know the mundane details so bad. I don't think I need to explain everything? It doesn't matter. It was a lot of work and money.
VetTech,3br5ow,DoopleSmog,2,Wed Jul 1 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"You could always look for a position with one of the pharmaceutical companies. I know that Merial used to hire experienced techs and assistants to work in their call center for Frontline (here in the Atlanta area). Working inside sales or customer support could lead to an office job elsewhere. I had the same problem a couple of year's ago. I had 15 years of veterinary experience, but couldn't parlay that into a non-animal related position (without a drastic pay cut). I bounced around a couple of clinics, but have since been at my current clinic for a year. I love it- apparently all I needed was a change of pace. Good Luck!"

VetTech,3br5ow,geotechker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:58:30 2015 UTC,I've been a vet tech for over 11years. I decided a few years back to go back to school because I just couldn't live paycheck to paycheck forever. I took out some student loans amd ended up in nursing school. I still worked as a tech all through school. I just graduated with my bachelors and I am interviewing with local hospitals. I still have my tech job for now until a hospital position comes through. I wish that I could work just one day a week as a tech even when I start my new career. I will miss the animals!
VetTech,3br5ow,lawlysmoke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:19:00 2015 UTC,Was it a tough transition to go from animals to people? I've considered investing my time in nursing school as opposed to vet tech (start this fall) but am not sure I could handle working on people every day.

Im pursueing a career thats still going to allow me to work with animals. Fish and Wildlife is my top choice, followed by any other law enforcement agency with a great interest in k-9 unit. My last choice is animal control. Either way, I want out of the vet tech career/life. Im overworked and underpaid.

However, I have come to realise that I crave to go back to the field, as low paid as it is, I would rather be doing something I enjoy daily and be poor, than be rich and miserable day to day like I am at the bank.  I'm moving countries hopefully at the end of Oct/Nov and plan to look for a new position as a vet tech then."

It's kind of intense, so you should be prepared, but the program boasts a 100% pass rate for the state boards. I believe my skill set coming into the field was well-rounded and I had been given adequate instruction in just about everything.  Dr. Clayton and Dr. Hickman appear to be new, so I'm not familiar with them. Dr. VanLear is new as the program director but not as a professor - I'm pretty sure all of the student adore him. I loved his lecture style: more conversation with call and response rather than excessive note-taking. Dr. Larsen can be intimidating, but she's exceptionally knowledgeable and just wants to give you the best education possible. Susan Knipp and Gail Foley are just flat-out amazing.  Do you have specific questions? I graduated distance ed, but there are a lot of BRCC graduates in the area that I can refer to if I don't have an answer."
VetTech,3bk4c0,JessaFace,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:33:46 2015 UTC,"I just graduated this Spring, I loved BRCC! Dr. Larsen teaches a large chunk of the material, and at first she scares the shit out of you, but as she gets to know her class she really opens up. By the end of the program, I wished she taught the entire program. I was also a distance ed student. It was pretty hard, and I almost dropped out, but Dr. Larsen talked me out of it. My mom used to work with Dr. Hickman, she was my ferrets vet, and I had one class with her. She is a great teacher and has really fun lectures and labs. I had 2 classes with Dr. Clayton, she will beat information in your head over and over, but this was her first year teaching distance ed. Everyone in my class did well and passed their VTNE. It's a great program!"

Not because of what I actually do because I love that, but because I've been working at a clinic that is ran by an intense doctor that blames us for everything  (including slow days) and her 22 year old daughter who has no education and tries to do my job as well as ""office manager"".   Yes, I've been looking at other places for awhile now lol.  Seriously though, congratulations!!!"
VetTech,3bg0ke,flyduckie,5,Sun Jun 28 22:09:38 2015 UTC,"$18/hr sounds about right for the Seattle area as well. It can vary a lot depending on the clinic/location. LVTs just plain don't make a good living. You kind of need to love the work based solely on its own merits. Quite frankly, many have a spouse to help with the financial burden. The rest either live very simply or have more than one job."
VetTech,3bg0ke,aquafemme,2,Sun Jun 28 22:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yep. I knew the risk of getting into the field and I think I'm just experiencing some growing pains. My partner makes a great living though have years on years worth of school debt whereas I don't have debt but I've just been in limbo of not really saving money to a point where I can ever own a property. I'm watching my friends that aren't in the veterinary field, making grownup plans [I'm 27] and hanging out with them gets so hard and intimidating."
VetTech,3bg0ke,freakydeeky105,6,Mon Jun 29 05:08:19 2015 UTC,"Research typically pays better than practice. Like in university research departments. It's a very different type of work and work environment, but the compensation and benefits are generally better and you tend to get pensions and stuff.   I'm an RVT located in Ontario, Canada. I have 15 years experience and work in a referral specialty hospital as an office manager where I make $27/hour - lots of perks, bonuses, and pet discounts, but no health/dental or pension. I also have a part time emergency and general practice job at $18/hour. When I left research about 8 years ago, I was making $24/hour."

VetTech,3bg0ke,greeneyesontherise,3,Mon Jun 29 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"Ok I just hired over 20 LVT's & Vet Assists in the Mid-Atlantic.  I have people making anywhere from $10-$30 an hour.   Here's how it is broken out:   Years of experience in the field. Overall impression from the interview (did you make me feel like you were going to go above and beyond once hired? Your resume (did you job hop a lot? Did you last less then 6 months? 12 monhts?)  Finally how well did you do in the interview?   I interviewd well over 70 people for those spots.  And most were looking for a ""pay check"" or were just going through the motions.  I had a few people who wanted more then their pay band would allow (based on what level tech or assistant you would be assigned to) but turned them down.    Why? Because we couldn't afford it.  And that meant this job was not for them.  If you think you are underpaid, and you have asked for a raise (and provided reasons why you deserved it) then that is not the place for you and it is time to move on.   Not every place is willing or able to pay you what you think you are worth, and that's ok, because again, it is no longer the place for you."

To be fair she was handed the business by someone who moved so she had a client base already, but she loves what she does and makes way more than she would have otherwise. She is planning on moving in the next 5 years and has started talking to me about taking it over when she leaves. While the money is totally enticing, I really love working in a hospital and love the place/people I work with. Something I am considering. In Southern California this could be a really lucrative business for you (I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area). Going rates are $25/30 minute visit whether that be walks or just feeding, cleaning, litter box maintenance. Over night stays can be $50/night if that's something you can do."

VetTech,3b5cq0,baycrestanimal,10,Fri Jun 26 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"We've gotten all at my work from Craigslist. To be honest I'm guessing your issue is that you aren't offering enough pay for a ""qualified and efficient"" technician. If you offer beginner rates that's exactly who you will get."
VetTech,3b5cq0,greeneyesontherise,9,Fri Jun 26 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second /u/greeneyesontherise about craigslist. I browsed craigslist for months, searching for anything mentioning ""RVT"", ""vet tech"" or ""veterinary technician"". Be clear about your location, hours, and expectations. Provide a way for them to email or mail a resume or call for questions, and if you do receive emails RESPOND NICELY AND PROFESSIONALLY to answer their questions, no matter how dumb you think they are.  So many of the ads listed nothing, just ""looking for skilled RVT, competitive pay, located in South City"" or something generic. They had no contact information, so I had to reply to the jarbled craigslist email address. Many of them didn't even list a location, so I had to email them to ask where their clinic was located, and I got curt replies. Huge turn off for me.  I would also contact your state's veterinary technician board; many of them maintain a website, forum, facebook page, etc, where they will post wanted ads.  Another idea is to scout out to local vet tech schools. You can generally talk to their placement department to get some recommendations for top students looking for jobs, etc. That's actually how I got the job at my previous clinic, the clinic called ME because they got my information from the placement department at my school.  And yes... if you're offering ""competitive pay"", make sure the pay is actually competitive for the skill level you're looking for. A seasoned tech won't want to come work for you for a starting salary."
VetTech,3b5cq0,rvtjess,5,Fri Jun 26 04:04:30 2015 UTC,"Everything she said is on point! I have no better advice than this. Great jobs for RVTs are few and far between and you have to give incentive for them to leave wherever they are at to come to you. It has to be better. People in this field tend to not be out of work and looking for jobs (unless they just moved or something) because they can't afford it. I love where I'm at and the people I work for and it would take at least at 20% increase in pay for me to even think about considering leaving my hospital.   Also worth mentioning specifics on incentives: my hospital doesn't pay top tier like a specialty can, so they offer many other great things that I seriously appreciate. We have an 80% discount for our pets, $500 yearly continued education allowance, $115 quarterly for uniform allowance, they pay 80% of our top tier health insurance plans, and sponsor fun events for us to go to (such as behind the scenes zoo tours and similar activities). They also do random and fun contests or raffles for prizes, get everyone birthday cards/treats, cards/treats/gifts for every holiday, just things to make us feel appreciated.   Now think about what you need to bring to the table for your qualified and experienced technician to come to your hospital over another, it might be more than you think."

VetTech,3auyl2,decepta_con,6,Tue Jun 23 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"Other examples of the horrors I have witnessed: animals being boarded in xray and not moved when taking pictures, doctor not wearing a mask and acknowledging it while performing a toe amputation because it fogs up her glasses, assistant taking xrays on her own dog had her ENTIRE ARM in the direct beam with no lead protection on her arms (when I mentioned it, the doctor's excuse was that the dog is crazy, and that's the only way an xray would happen), the doctor telling me an owner who's dog had just been euthanized on an emergency basis (via heart stick bc Dr couldn't hit a pretty obvious saphenous vein) that the owner was taking up her whole ""damn room"" and needed to be ushered out. I told her I didn't know what she meant by that. The doctor told me, ""I know I should be more sympathetic but she was too late, I mean c'mon!"" Aahhhhh!"
VetTech,3auyl2,aquafemme,5,Tue Jun 23 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"Is there an AAHA-accredited vet clinic you could apply to? Just thinking that at least shows they were willing to go through the process. At my clinic, our patient care is exactly how you describe (your expectations for patient monitoring, fluids, prior exam, etc.) I just wish we had a capnograph! Unless you think you can enlighten them and improve conditions, I'd keep searching until you find a practice where you're comfortable. We just don't get paid enough to be doing work we don't feel good about. It's supposed to be work worth doing!"
VetTech,3auyl2,geotechker,3,Tue Jun 23 21:15:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I keep asking myself why they want a technician if there is literally nothing they would utilize someone with technical skills for? Great idea about AAHA, I'll do some research! Thanks"
VetTech,3auyl2,aquafemme,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:19:50 2015 UTC,Even be careful with AAHA accredited clinics. I briefly worked for a hospital that did their best when it was time to get re-accredited but went to shit once they were. I didn't stay there very long.
VetTech,3auyl2,xrareformx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:52:03 2015 UTC,That is so stupid. They'd basically have to start from scratch every three years. So pointless and exhausting.

No. Do a whole damn shift there. Most places will pay you for a full shift if you accept the job. Ask to come in on the busiest day of the week possible, that way you can see how they operate under stress. Ask to watch procedures and stuff like that. You may end up standing in the corner the whole time (some hospitals can't risk a non-employee to get hurt or fuck something up) but it is worth it. Also, AAHA-accreditation hospitals."

VetTech,3amol8,ancilla1998,7,Sun Jun 21 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"That's sucky all around, for the owner and for the vet staff. On one hand, what are you supposed to do, make a dr appear out of thin air? But on the other hand, the owner was probably distraught over his dying cat and wanted to do what was best for the cat - humane euthanasia instead of letting him sit and suffer a slow death, and you couldn't help. :("
VetTech,3amol8,rvtjess,3,Sun Jun 21 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe the receptionist could have referred him to a nearby veterinary office that had a doctor on staff? Why straight to the shelter?"
VetTech,3amol8,AgentAsterisk,2,Sun Jun 21 21:35:29 2015 UTC,We are a low-cost clinic and we sometimes have clients who can't even afford our office call and euthanasia service that we offer. Not to mention that most vets won't take an emergency euthanasia walk-in for a non-client.
VetTech,3amol8,jadedgoldfish,9,Sun Jun 21 22:20:51 2015 UTC,"I've never met a vet who wouldn't do an emergency euthanasia, client or not. It's also always been the one thing we can do at no charge if it's a dire emergency and there is no money available. The owners don't get to be present, there isn't an IVC, there isn't a long discussion, and they have to take remains, but we do have an ethical obligation to any animal that walks in the door. I don't know that I would want to work at a practice that would send away an animal that is suffering and dying because of less than $5 in syringe/needle/euthasol."

VetTech,3amol8,CapnToker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:38:13 2015 UTC,"Many of these comments are true but that cat didn't just suddenly become like that. So many owners want to wait until their animal is literally dying before they decide to do something and then suddenly its the clinic's fault for not being able to help them.  I work emergency and we see this kind of thing all the time. I get ""my dog needs a c-section but I can't afford it and you're gonna let my baby die"" all the time. No ma'am, you made the decision to breed your 2 pound Pom because you wanted to sell the puppies but YOU didn't make provisions for her in case of emergency. It really sucks some times and you feel bad for the animals but you can't fix ignorance and neglect."
VetTech,3aj4lt,cookiedoughnut,9,Sat Jun 20 18:19:04 2015 UTC,"I truly love this idea.  I've had discussions with our vets about how it would likely make their lives so much simpler if there was a PA type degree between tech and vet who could do things like yearlies with no complications and ""straight forward"" medicals like ear infections.  They both said they would be comfortable with the idea if it included a 6 month to a year apprenticeship type component.  We had agreed that it would add value to the practice and make some things more affordable for clients.  Some one like myself who has worked with the same Drs for 5 and 9 years can virtually read their minds.  I would be excited about an opportunity to enhance my degree."
VetTech,3aj4lt,melize,4,Sat Jun 20 22:43:22 2015 UTC,"Im currently just a vet tech student, but this gets me excited for the fututre!"
VetTech,3aj4lt,Bickell,8,Sat Jun 20 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like most animal hospitals are so small that having a PA position would be kind of pointless. It makes sense in regular healthcare where internal medicine doctors can be booked for an entire week and will have a PA to take their overflow, see patients in the hospital and nursing homes.  I have experience with two animal hospitals (one was an externship) and neither have been busy enough to warrant having a PA. There were always openings throughout the day to squeeze people in if needed.  But that's just from my experience."
VetTech,3aj4lt,EarthboundExotics,3,Sat Jun 20 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"Here in Canada, we have a lack of veterinarians willing/able to serve Northern communities. The same goes for human doctors in these regions. I feel that much like how nurse practitioners have been invaluable in these under-served regions, a veterinary version of this would greatly improve animal welfare in the North."
VetTech,3aj4lt,Neryian,3,Sun Jun 21 12:59:19 2015 UTC,"I think this would only truly work if the number one complaint of veterinary technicians was addressed, pay.  As currently we hover at poverty level pay rates, how can the profession even begin to consider paying an advance degree holder when it can barely pay its nurses?  Yes this would bridge the cap in underserved communities, but when you have an entire education profession that can barely support itself much less itself with a family, how would something like this financially work out?  This is a nice pipe dream, but the profession has doctors floundering under massive debt and low pay, do we really want to consider segmenting off a section of the nursing core into the same situation?"

VetTech,3ak1cv,theonlycrazyonehere,3,Sun Jun 21 01:10:35 2015 UTC,"We sometimes tuck them under our arms like a big bag,  and hold the head up with the other hand for jug sticks.  A lot of dogs do better that way and don't panic as much.  Good for nail trims on those buggers too.  Giant hugs!"
VetTech,3ak1cv,nickyc82,3,Sun Jun 21 02:41:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a relatively small person (4'8""), and this was my method: dog on the corner of the exam table, paws off the front. Preferred arm over the dog's upper back/neck area with your elbow or forearm on the table and slightly lean onto it. Other hand free to hold the leg off for a blood draw or the head up for a jug stick. Worked about 80% of the time. The super fidgety ones got put on their side, then take the front and back legs that are against the table and pull them just high enough to remove their leverage to flip back over. Arm holding the front leg can be bowed out a bit and your forearm can lean on the neck area to keep biters down. Let me know if either of these methods help!"
VetTech,3ak1cv,atomicangel2399,2,Sun Jun 21 05:05:19 2015 UTC,"I treat them like cats... I will pick them up like a football nestled under one arm and hold their front legs with that same arm, then use my free arm to manipulate/restrain the head. That way if they struggle, you can tighten your arm to hug them firmly against your body and you have their front legs so they can't claw you up.  Also, having someone there to talk to and distract them/""bonk"" them on the head works wonders!"

They give brachy a longer face and you can hold the muzzle when positioning the face. It also helps protect those bug eyes.  A lot of dogs will settle quickly if they can't see, which is also why I love those muzzles."

VetTech,3a6xe0,123Go93,3,Wed Jun 17 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"I absolutely take them into consideration, but I read the reviews, not just the rating to see if they are legitamate complaints or just people who are mad because they had to any pay money at all or wait 5 minutes in the lobby. Of course there are a lot of other things to consider, but I do check reviews."
VetTech,3a6xe0,trinklest,2,Wed Jun 17 21:05:08 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that  when a clinic that has major internal problems and high staff turnover and discontent, this will slowly begin to show in the reviews of the clinic. The clients notice when the employees are unhappy and the standard of care has fallen. For example, the clinic where I worked that ended up being a total train wreck now has many more recent one-star yelp reviews than it used to, starting a couple months after all the strife began. By comparison, the well-run clinic where I work now is still getting five-star reviews.   That being said, yelp does filter its reviews and tends to show more positive reviews than negative ones, presumably to try and weed out those people who are angry over things that really are their fault. I usually check out the ""reviews not currently recommended"" as well to see the overall trend in reviews for any business.   However, I think the best way to evaluate a clinic is a working interview. The types of things I will look for if I ever work at another clinic is if things are stocked and cleaned (meaning the assistants actually have a little time to do these things!) Do they complete basic protocols like weight and tpr on every pet? How do they treat the patients that are there? How present is the management? Does the office manager (which hopefully exists, if there is no office manager I would not accept that position) seem involved with their team, or do they sit away and do paperwork or watch movies all day? Do you mesh well with the employees? Why did your predecessor leave? How is the workflow between reception and ""the back""?  TL;DR in my experience, yes, yelp reviews can reflect a poor working environment and a poor standard of care. However, a working interview provides more information than a yelp review."
VetTech,3a6xe0,am_i_really_ftm,2,Wed Jun 17 19:32:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not Yelp.  Yelp has a very interesting business model in that a business has to pay them in order to get positive reviews bumped up and negative reviews bumped down.  As the ""social media contact"" for my own clinic, we are 3 star rated on Yelp with a high volume of negative reviews mostly about staff that hasn't been there in years and from clients who expected the Crystal Ball and Magic Wand treatment.  Looking at Google, we are at 4.2 stars which is lower than expected but when you read our 1 star reviews (not just look at the ratings), they fall into the yelp category or have a glowing written review but are from an older client who doesn't understand the star system (bless their hearts).  Looking at Demandforce we are a solid 5 star clinic with nearly 200 positive reviews from clients who have stuck with us for most of our 20+ year history. Many of those we use as a cycling board on our website and we will personally respond to.  Also remember, people are far more likely to complain about medical care than they are to rave about it.  Read the reviews and see if the clients are complaining about pricing (shocker it costs money!), wait times (3 minutes past appointment time is unacceptable in veterinary medicine but 45 minutes is 'Normal' in human and acceptable), Crystal Ball Diagnosis or valid complaints.    As u/am_i_really_ftm said, you will get a much better idea from a working interview than you will from internet reviews."
VetTech,3a6xe0,Neryian,2,Mon Jun 22 03:35:00 2015 UTC,"Do, however with a grain of salt. The clinic I work for now (which im leaving after 3 miserable months) is owned/operated by one vet. Clients love her to death-she specializes in ""TLC Clients"", meaning upper class women that have nothing better to do than talk about drama and shit. Shes an absolute nightmare to work for though. After getting hired on, she went on to brag about how shes a chameleon and totally treats her staff like shit. The reviews are stellar on her though. Some doctors are like that. They are awesome towards clients but horrible to their staff. Thats why I will always ALWAYS insist on doing 1-2 working interviews."
VetTech,3a2jlg,Tigris474,4,Tue Jun 16 18:52:27 2015 UTC,"For bedding, I usually go to goodwill and grab the cheapest options. Trim off any loose strings, and then just throw it away if it gets hideous. Not the best for the environment, I know, but it keeps me sane with bottle babies to not have an extra 2 loads of laundry to do every day. They should be going to the bathroom on their own within the week, so start offering a litterbox with corn or wheat based litter. They will eat whatever litter you put in, so don't put clay.  You can start offering the KMR in a very shallow saucer at this point and seeing if they have any interest in it. Start adding tiny amounts of wet food into the formula and gradually transition onto wet. Royal Canin Babycat is a great transitioning kibble to offer around 4-5 weeks.  Weigh daily. They should gain 1/4 to 1/2 oz (7-14g) a day.  If you're still doing the feedings every 2 hours... don't. They're not newborns. Every 4 hours is sufficient at this age, and you can push it to a 6 hour stretch at night so you can get some sleep. Keep formula available in a shallow dish and offer wet/KMR gruel at all times and bottle every 4. Get some sleep."

I work with one dr that, if we can't hit a vein on the first time for a blood draw, he walks over, grabs a new syringe, and takes over. Oftentimes he has trouble hitting it, too, but it makes you feel totally incompetent and like you're annoying your doctor when they do stuff like that.  Or giving you attitude for asking questions or clarification with a case.  Sometimes it's misplaced aggression, but it's still disrespectful to the techs.  Also, less minor but still an annoyance - leaving a huge mess everywhere!"

It's great that you think I have superpowers, but no, I couldn't open the clinic, clean the whole place while answering phones and admitting surgical patients, AND get an IV into the 45 pound dog by myself before you sauntered in at 8:30.

VetTech,39zit8,trinklest,14,Wed Jun 17 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"Returning equipment to the state you found it after you use it. Every doctor in my practice leaves slides and lights on on the microscopes until someone else has to use it (which turns into the ""Whose sample is this? Can I get rid of it?"" game) Dirty, nasty thermometers everywhere. Used ear cones left on otoscopes. I understand that part of my job is to clean up after the doctors. But we have premade alcohol wipes for thermometers. Two seconds of a wipe and you could save someone else two minutes scrubbing off the dried-on feces and the counter you left it on. Unless an ear was dirty we cant know if you used the cone unless you take it off and put it in the sink for me to wash. Sometimes I feel like a mother following a messy, distracted child all around.   Time management. Some doctors are better than others but when they're bad it drags everyone down with them.   Lastly, it's just underestimating the time or effort it takes us to do certain tasks. My biggest gripe is with social media. That is one of my ""jobs"" around the hospital but I'm also head surgery tech which takes up virtually all of my time at work. Social media takes WAY more time than you'd ever imagine.

I get that you want to patient to wake up asap, but I'm the anaesthetist and there's a lot of stuff that I like to do before I wake the patient up. Like untie them, remove all the ecg leads, remove the rectal thermometer etc. I like to be focused and ready to extubate, so I don't like to be fussing with other things once the Iso is off. I'll often turn them down after the procedure is complete, but I only turn off the Iso once I've given any required post operative meds, taken all the monitoring equipment off, and can be completely focused on their recovery. We've all had animals recover way quicker than expected, and there nothing worse than being on the other side of the surgery table trying to untie a limb and the patient suddenly wakes up and you're fussing and reaching across the table to try extubate and prevent the the animal from flailing and leaping off the table. Let me do my stuff and leave that Iso alone!"

Let's both enter the room with a ""can do"" attitude and everything will be fine.  Please be clear when telling me what you want for diagnostics. I spent a lot of unnecessary time retaking rads because you wrote down ""paws"" when you meant ""front limbs,"" and I heard you tell the client ""sometimes specialty appointments are a learning experience."" It's not. You weren't clear when you passed it off to me. I gave you exactly what you asked for. Please don't throw your techs under the bus when appointments take longer, even playfully. It's rude.  I treat you as a superior in front of clients, but when I see doctors gossip and whisper about childish things I do lose respect for you.   Please be patient when the RVT is teaching someone how to do something- it's usually because we are trying to make the whole process more streamlined for the future.   Gah...

My doc talks about that and actually does some things wrong like taping IV catheters in and it bugs me. Idk if it's just cuz he's from a different time but I like to think techs know nursing care. It's like ""You focus on the big stuff and I'll focus on the little."" I just don't like it when non-RVT (Or LVT) people refer to themselves as techs. I worked my ass off to pass the VTNE and never called myself one till I did. I feel like I worked hard to earn that title and don't use it lightly.  Also I hate when docs take their sweet-ass time chatting with owners during their 20-minute appointment when the next person has been waiting to see them. The owners are gonna blame me for their wait time and I have no control over that. The doc does. Wither make appointments longer or hurry the heck up!

You all say it and we all know it generally doesn't mean you actually worked as a certified or registered or whatever tech.

VetTech,39zit8,trinklest,2,Wed Jun 17 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I get annoyed with vets who have no reptile/amphibian/exotics experience and then try to push their weight around when making treatment/care decisions. For example: I have been working with reptiles both professionally and as a hobbyist for more than 10 years. I've worked for exotics vets, and now I work in a university lab with these species. I've dealt with numerous ""mammal"" vets (for lack of a better term) who come in and basically ignore my suggestions because I'm ""just a tech"". They soon learn that these animals are not mammals, and learn to listen to me."
VetTech,39zit8,EarthboundExotics,2,Thu Jun 18 11:40:42 2015 UTC,"Not asking nicely or treating their staff like the hard-working people they are. Treating your techs like they are replaceable is not going to want to make people work hard for you and stay with your business (if you run the place). Obvs that doesn't mean you can't be a hardass or have high standards, but failure to appreciate and recognize good work can become extremely degrading.   I am not a doctor. I'll never be as good as you. I just want to help and be useful, to my vets and my clients. It makes such a difference being treated with respect."
VetTech,39zit8,yahthatgirl,2,Fri Jun 19 04:19:12 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing that irks me is when doctors don't let me do my job in taking a history. There's a line here: There's one doctor at my clinic who just doesn't care for the tech getting a history. He just has the tech follow him into the room and gets the history himself. That's fine. What makes me crazy is when one particular doctor decides that he's ready for the appointment now/I'm taking too long and bursts into the room in the middle of me getting a history.  So now I don't get to communicate with the doctor what I've heard, the client has to repeat him or herself in order to tell the doctor what he or she has told me, OR the information that he or she has given me never gets repeated because he or she doesn't want to say it all again. It just throws the whole system off and it drives me absolutely bonkers.   Besides that, basically what everyone else has said: be patient with your techs, realize that we do a whole lot more than help out in rooms. When things get crazy, it's not always possible for us to be hovering at your side, waiting for you to need something. Mutual respect and patience goes a long way. I think the fact that you're considering this and asking this question says a lot about your ability to be fair with your techs and assistants.  Edit: The other thing that bothers me is when doctors don't trust me to help them throughout the day. Please, delegate. There are a few doctors that won't let me do things to help us get ahead (get blood draws, do nail trims early, bring appointments in and get a history while they're finishing notes, etc.) Just trust me, delegate to me, tell me what you need, and we will stay on time and get everything done.

The one thing that gets me is when we aren't listened too. I work with ICU patients and when I come to you saying this patents respiratory effort is increased or this patient looks more pale it means you should come check on your patient. I rather you waste your time coming to check on your patient for no reason other than peace of mind then for me to have to come get you because your patient is crashing and you ignored my updates on them.

After over a decade, I have learned there is no such thing as too much tape and my catheters don't move.  They don't blow, they don't slip and my patients don't get puffy paw.  I love splints on cats and small dogs.  Yes, its a pain in the ass to get them off sometimes and sometimes you have to use scissors.  But nothing drives me up the wall more than coming in at 2am because the doctor has decided that the cat ""looked uncomfortable"" and now I have a blown cath with puffy paw cause 2/3rds of the tape and the splint is off.  Of course that cat was pissed it had a cone and a splint, you would be too, but her bitey face was off my work until you futzed with it.   If I say Let Go, please for the love of your family, let go.  Its my job to keep you and me from getting bit, and if you keep trying to muscle that cat and you get nailed, its your own fault and I will tell you so.  Just let go and let me corner kitty into a dark room with a big blanket and happy drugs.  30 years living with psycho cats trumps your 1 semester in cat behavior.

The program I'm in is through San Juan College in Farmington, NM. It costs roughly $1500/semester not including textbooks...good thing about the program is that you'll use your textbooks for more than one class so no complaints there. I've really enjoyed this program so far. I'm in my third semester and have another year to go making the program about 2 1/2 to 3 years long going at 8 hours a semester. If your wife did 12 or more, it'd be quicker for her!   The program goes in Tiers. In tier 2, she'd have to get a hospital to work as a small animal clinical site for her so that she could practice putting in catheters, drawing blood, etc. She could probably ask around and volunteer places if this program is something that interests her. In tier 4 she'd need a large animal facility but the program has a 3 day intensive workshop in Waco, TX where you get all of your large animal portion out of the way which is what I'll be doing.   The advisor for the program is VERY helpful and very quick to reply to emails. It's been a great experience so far.   If she seems interested, feel free to message me with questions!"

VetTech,39xrc3,aquafemme,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at enrolling with San Juan. So it's essentially an ""at your own pace"" program then? Are you able to complete your externships at the hospital you work at? Do you have to do a large animal externship also?  There's a college an hour away from me that has a tech program. The problem is that they don't allow you to go part time. Having to work nearly full time and go to school full time would be really rough, let alone doing a two hour commute daily. The online option is looking more and more appealing.  One more question. Are you enrolled in a payment plan? What are the payments like?  Sorry for all the questions!"
VetTech,39xrc3,Bickell,2,Tue Jun 23 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"No it's okay! Ask away!  Each semester is 12 weeks long (spring, summer, & fall). Each class gives you 1 week to finish the assignment/quiz/test that's due. For example, in Week 1, you'll have an assignment to do and a quiz take. You have all week to do it. Some classes make all quizzes due at the very end of the semester so essentially you'd have 12 weeks to do all quizzes assigned that semester. The tests are sometimes scheduled like that as well--you either have 1 week to take them or the entire semester to take them. There are multiple attempts (2-3) on each quiz and some teachers will give you 2 attempts on each test.   You are able to complete the small animal externship at the hospital you work at once you get the hospital certified (which has to be done by Tier 2, so you have a while to get it done!) The program does a really great job of explaining the process for each step to you. The advisor, Sherry Hair, meets with you over the phone for about 15 minutes before each semester to go over what next steps need to be taken to prepare you. She's very helpful and has always responded to my e-mails within 30 minutes to an hour!   You do also have to a large animal externship...you can either find a large animal facility to work at, or the program offers a 3-4 day intensive workshop in Waco, TX where you can get all of the large animal on-hands work out of the way without having to find a facility to work at.   That was the same issue I had with the tech program in my state. You can't be part time, and unfortunately I have bills to pay, haha. This online program has been a great experience so far. I'm doing 8 hours a semester right now and it's definitely doable, even working over 40 hours a week.   I'm not enrolled in a payment plan because I have financial aid. I do think they have payment plans available, though. A semester for 8 hours (that's 4 classes) without textbooks is close to $1500. The textbooks may be expensive but you'll use the same textbook for several different classes, so it's not like you're having to buy a brand new version of a textbook for every class. Slugbooks.com has always found me an awesome deal on cheaper textbooks, though.   Sorry this was so long! :)"
VetTech,39xrc3,purpledragons,2,Wed Jun 24 15:09:29 2015 UTC,Their program is accredited by the AVMA so I don't think it is necessarily a rip off.

VetTech,39xrc3,trinklest,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, pretty much. It is usually a physical institution that offers online versions of their courses so you can complete them from anywhere in the U.S. You will still have to get hands-on experience usually in the form of an externship at a small animal hospital and then a separate place to get large animal experience. Most if not all of the programs will at some point require you to take videos of yourself performing tasks from a list."

After a few calls from the lady's daughter trying to work out what was happening (the mum was pretty upset when we put the dog in her car), the daughter suddenly called back saying that her mum was outside and the dog had stopped breathing. Sadly the dog had passed away. It was hard being there with the owner, I welled up a little.

Will they get along with the clients? 2)  Are they motivated to learn and do the job they're getting paid to do? 3)  Are they trying to think ahead?  (IE ""should I go ahead and get an ear cytology and stain it?  Do you want me to clean the ears after?"") 4)  How good are their technical skills?    Granted we hire veterinary assistants, not licensed techs at our clinic (hired 2 LVTs in the past and weren't impressed) so we don't have any expectations of them starting out, but even when someone comes in already knowing venipuncture and the like that's still what I'd look for.

VetTech,38r42q,Tigris474,7,Sat Jun 6 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"Hi fellow lifer! My mother is my veterinarian also! I've been doing this for 9 years now (started as a receptionist, worked my way up to assistant, and I'm currently the Practice Manager at our clinic.) Let me tell you, growing up in this world exposes you to all kinds of people. That being said...  It sounds like you have a lot of frustration with people because they do stupid stuff and don't have the money to pay for it. Unfortunately, this is literally the whole business. Pretty much all day, every day. The problem with being in your position is that you have a massive amount of knowledge from being a lifer. Most people don't. Luckily, it's your job to educate people on the important things they should know about their pets!  You tend to become jaded especially quickly, mostly because people will do things that seem obvious to you. Don't give your animals people meds! Don't wait for a week to take them in when they aren't eating! Duh! And while all of this seems like a no brainer for you, it's not that crystal clear to every day Joe Schmoe.   The hard truth is- it's your job to educate every owner that you work with. You need to understand that not everyone has the knowledge base that you do. Take the extra time to help them and you will be rewarded, I promise. It's not like your clients are doing these things to irritate you. They just don't know how severe things can get.   People don't get pets because they have extra expendable income. They get pets because they see a cute puppy and take it home. There is usually no planning for the what-ifs, because people just don't think that way. And trust me, I understand how frustrating it is.   But, as an assistant, you should be your patient's number one advocate. FOR EVERY PATIENT. You're there to help the animal, and that means you're also there to help the person on the other end of the leash as well.  Maybe you should sit down and re-evaluate exactly what it is you want to accomplish in your career. If you're there to help all patients, regardless of how uninformed or noodle-brained or down right annoying the client is, you're in the right place. You can help make yourself a better assistant by looking up some of the pros who talk about customer service and how to help your clients understand how important the things you're telling them are. I highly recommend Wendy Williams for this.   Now- this isn't to say you aren't ever going to have a bad day or a case that goes wrong. But carrying all that misplaced negativity around with you isn't going to help anyone, especially not your patients."
VetTech,38r42q,Stellastatistic,3,Sat Jun 6 02:56:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you kind stranger. I am very rewarded at times for my efforts especially in the cat department. Cata are my jam, I love them and I understand  them. Mom is an exotics vet so I have a good grip on them too, and ofcourse dogs. But cats are everything, so in the same night that that dog came in, so did a 6 week old kitten with a very badly injured toe and I was on it like bread on butter. This woman picked her up out of her neighbors yard and decided to keep it but had no idea how to raise a cat, so I was in heaven explaining kitten rearing for a solid 30 mins. You make a fair point freind. Thanks"
VetTech,38r42q,geotechker,4,Sat Jun 6 03:04:10 2015 UTC,"Hello! I've been a veterinary technician for about 11 years now. Stellastatic pretty much hit the nail on the head. Client education is critical to our profession and it is so easy to forget that people don't know all the things that we do. That being said, there are always going to be those clients that don't listen to you, no matter how many times you try to educate them. That can be extremely frustrating, especially when the pet ends up getting all the problems you warned it's owners about. When I have those days with those clients, I just try to focus on the animal and do whatever I can do to help it that is within my power. I also try to focus on all the positive things I've accomplished while in the field. I know that over the years I have made a difference in a lot of people's lives. When you have that client who listened to your recommendation, or the grateful client that thanks you for caring so much for their pet, it sort of balances it out and makes it worth it.  It also helps when you work for a place that will try and help people out some. The vets that I work for try to put the animal's welfare above everything else. I've seen them discount so many things, especially for people who are nice and at least make some sort of effort to care for their pet. It is a fine line though because some people will claim they have no money and try to take advantage of the situation.  One of the hardest lessons I had to learn early on in my career is that you can't save them all. If you've done your best to take care of every pet that crosses your path, then it has to be enough to be content. Working in this profession, there will always be bad days and bad clients. For myself, good always seems to outweigh the bad and it's helped me stay in the profession for so long."
VetTech,38r42q,jadedgoldfish,2,Sat Jun 6 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I made a wall of text. But I feel 9 million times better after having a very long rant and a couple ativan and maybe can sleep for the first time since walking out of work Friday morning.  Background: I'm an RVT in a 24 hour practice that is emergency at night and GP during the day. I'm on graveyard, only work emergency.  We had a cat in the other night with a vaccination site sarcoma that had grown VERY quickly and enveloped the entire leg. Easily 6""x4""x3"" deep. Massive and ulcerated. The owner had decided earlier when it was diagnosed that she wasn't going to go ahead with surgery and would euthanize when it got worse or painful or ruptured. It ruptures. I ask about surgery, the vet asked her about surgery, still not something she'd consider and we euthanize. A 3 year old cat, very sweet, super playful, difficult for all of us.  My manager comes in the next morning, peruses my records from the night before because she likes to micromanage and sees the euthanasia. Comes in and starts bitching me out telling me ""I just don't understand how you emergency people can have so little compassion. We would never do that euthanasia during the day. We would have the owner surrender it to a rescue and we wouldn't ever be so awful to do a convenience euthanasia!""  The cat had a tumor the size of a dictionary on it's leg that was open and bleeding. It's not like she was moving and didn't want to take the cat. Yes, it was operable. That cat would have been fixed with amputation. But owners still have the right to choose palliative care over surgery. I'm told repeatedly that we can't take owner relinquishments, despite my boss doing this every couple of months. I'm told that our HUGE charity fund isn't available for use, but my manager loves to use it on cases where they really don't need the money to save the life and they're just friendly clients or friends with the owner. (I realize not of this is relating to your post... I've just been having a panic attack since I left work yesterday morning over dealing with my boss and it feels really good to get it out... Sorry.)  I had a dog the other day that got into the owner's roommate's stash of meth. Dog was actually in really good shape, considering, and just needed to be kept sedate on ace. She couldn't afford to hospitalize, but the dog got a loading injection of ace and we were going to send some home with her. She paid 2/3 of the bill, but her 2nd card was declined and I had to make a payment arrangement for the remainder for her. My boss's policy: if they have a payment arrangement, you're not allowed to do any more treatments once you find out they can't afford it and they can't go home with medications. Doesn't matter what it is. Lasix for CHF? Tramadol for a blown cruciate? Acepromazine for meth? Too fucking bad, no drugs for you. I go to bat on this one, because it's wrong. Not a little wrong... it's falling below the minimum standards of care and is negligent on our part. My boss says ""It sucks that the dog can't have the meds. But it's not my job to care about the dog. I don't give a shit if he gets meds or not. All I care about is if I get paid. If i get paid, great, the dog can feel better. Until then, it's the owner's fault that her dog is suffering!""  So I'm leaving that job. I just really can't take it any more. I got into this field to help animals. I work hard to save lives. At the end of the day, giving 2 tablets of ace to a client who can't afford them isn't going to break the bank when we charge over 100 for an exam. If I charge 80 bucks for the cage and 80 bucks for the nurse and 130 for the IV catheter and bag of fluids and then continue to charge 60 bucks per shift to use an IV pump and 60 bucks for each new bag of fluids, I'm pretty sure we can afford 2 tablets of ace for a woman who is giving us every penny she has to help her dog. And lo and behold, she came back 2 hours later when her bank opened and paid the balance. Thank god, otherwise we'd still hear about the outstanding balance in 2 years."
VetTech,38r42q,jadedgoldfish,2,Sat Jun 6 19:43:23 2015 UTC,"My mother has nailed into my brain ""never work in a corporate office"" she refuses to deal with hospitals like that and no matter how often our boss says we shouldnt, she consistently bad mouths the local 24 hour clinic because of their ""money"" issues. It sounds like you work in a place much like that. We send our extreme emergancies over an hour away to avoid that clinic. Please quit and find someone in it for the animals. Thats why I love my office manager. We had a Parvo puppy come in 2 years ago and it was on deaths door, but my mother is known for bringing puppies back to life, the owner had no money and had just found it on the road. The office manager had her surrender it (we aren't a rescue and we have no donation fund or rescued pets) and she adopted the puppy and my office manager paid out of pocket, her own money and saved the dogs life. She is a spoiled brat now. But that's why I love working in a family practice."

The cat I was watching was in a small crate with an e-collar on, and the suture just all tore somehow. You just have to focus on the next animal. Remember the success stories and give the other ones a really good cuddle.  It isn't your fault. There will always be the dog that gets out of the e-collar. If there wasn't an e-collar put on or if it wasn't big enough, it's an opportunity for improvement going forward. We had one last week who tore off his scrotum after getting neutered and going home and the owner taking off the e-collar.  I'm so sorry. Go hug the nearest dog. It helps."

VetTech,38akpk,Darkangelmystic79,5,Wed Jun 3 02:06:14 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you can try to get the clinic to be more proactive about boarding animals.  Maybe they can set up a camera that is accessible to the doctors/staff on duty while animals are there overnight.    I've seen this happen.  Heck.  I worked at an emergency clinic where a client came in with their dog who did the same thing, but they wouldn't pay for the bill. So instead the went home AMA, with an abdominal wrap.  He even declined pain meds. At least she had you at the end to make her feel better and try to fix the problem.  I'm sorry this happened to you.  All we can do in these situations is grieve and learn.  And it's ok to grieve.   If it were me, I would probably ""talk to her"" one night while I was in bed.  I think they go to heaven.  Talk to her. Say out loud how you feel.  Maybe it will help.    HUGS."

VetTech,38akpk,Lanaowl,4,Wed Jun 3 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"You did all the right things in a moment of pure panic for many of us. It is very tragic that poor Annabelle could not be saved. However, a good suggestion for the future that you could bring up with the other staff at a meeting perhaps. There was a small hospital I worked for in the past. We had a patient get out of their e-collar overnight and do the same thing only it was an orthopedic surgery site. What we did to prevent it from happening again was we purchased a few cheap webcams which we then linked to a laptop, we could network to it from home. We set them up in front of a run or kennel for each animal needing observation typically we had no more than two overnight patients at one time. We would just take turns checking the cameras every hour and watching for at least 15 minutes or longer if you had the time available, each employee was assigned to a shift of checking in for two hours including the doctors. We all agreed to do this and the veterinarian and staff were given vacation hours for their time spent. It was not super cheap, it cost us about 300 dollars total to set up. However, it was awesome to have that kind of piece of mind."

VetTech,38akpk,onemanutopia,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:48:55 2015 UTC,"I had a similar traumatic experience when a golden was rushed into the hospital with ""bleeding from her rectum""  we were expecting an owner who just blew out of proportion a little blood in her stool, but in fact she had a massive hemangiosarc in her colon that had burst. She came in wagging her tail with part of her colon prolapsed gushing blood out her rear and spraying blood with her tail everywhere. It must have been extremely painful, when we stopped the bleeding and found the issue, we biopsied and had to tell them that it was another casualty to goldenitits :( This was just a few months after my beautiful tripod golden lost his fight against hamangiosarc when his spleen finally burst and he bled out into his abdomen. This one really hit home for me, and as the person who had to wash the blood off her rear/tail/legs it was very traumatic. I cried the entire drive home. Now 2 years after Troy's passing we have a 6 month old pup who is the light of my life, and a new 4 legged baby really filled the void that he left. I'm telling you, its so hard, but training and cuddles and puppy running in his sleep, its so enchanting to have a young dog again. Good luck <3"

VetTech,387q7t,Bickell,2,Tue Jun 2 13:22:52 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with starting medical terminology. It is used more frequently than not, and to truly sound professional you want adequate medical terminology. At my clinic each doctor has a tech and tech has an assistant. Maybe they would let you spend more time shadowing and helping the techs and learning/hearing/seeing firsthand what they do and the steps processes take. I'm in my first semester of a vet tech program and there is very little so far that I haven't already learned from on the job training (I've been an assistant for 3 years). Also ask if any techs have textbooks around that they would let you borrow and read."

VetTech,387q7t,OwnerOfChaos,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:21:17 2015 UTC,"The program probably has their book list online (or you can go to the college bookstore).

VetTech,387q7t,Tigris474,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"If you are close with a doctor, just start asking questions. Ask if you can chat after hours. I worked with a doctor who was only a little older than me and we got very close and she helped me so much become more confident."
VetTech,387q7t,onemanutopia,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:50:10 2015 UTC,"A good understanding of the core sciences is the foundation you will build your medical knowledge on. What you know about chemistry, biology and even physics will inform everything you learn about anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, nursing, behavior, etc. Any school can teach you what to do, but in my opinion what separates a good tech from an adequate tech is an understanding of why you do what you do. So even if your program doesn't require a lot of core science classes, take them anyway, and it's probably a good idea to take more than they require."

VetTech,37orfp,TheRealKaila,5,Fri May 29 05:25:26 2015 UTC,"Are you ready for a novel?  Apologies in advance.  /u/fffreezing has the best advice anyone could give you right now.  I'm newish to this as well, but I did start with volunteering at a non-profit spay and neuter for over 100 hours and the experience is crazy.  I did hours upon hours of online research trying to make sure this was the right field for me.  I read all the articles I could find, peoples personal stories, private practice success and horror stories, watched videos on surgeries to see if I could stomach it, asked questions on this forum and none of this prepared me for the actual job.  I've had to come to terms with a lot of things, do a lot of things I didn't know I could do and have my heart broken lots of times.  I knew some of this was inevitable like bad owners you just want to punch, euthanasia, bites, gross sites and smells but you will never know how you react to it until you are in the midst of it.  I realized that rescues aren't always great, a lot are led by horrible people who are in it for the money and not the welfare of the animals.  You learn through heartbreak that you can't save every animal and you very well shouldn't.  There are thousands of rescues in this city alone, all sweet pets who need homes after being born in a ditch or had homes and then were abandoned or surrendered for stupid reasons, or left out to become flea/tick/heart worm ridden and constantly in pain or used for fighting.  I went from thinking every single dog had a chance to turn around and have a happy home, no matter their temperament or disabilities, to thinking that sometimes these aggressive dogs need to be put down to save resources for the ones who could be adopted out to a happy family.  Rescues lie, saying that a former fighting pit bull is an 'akita mix' who needs 'work' with a loving family.  I'd rather that dog be put down humanly rather than go to a family who didn't expect it and have it bite or kill someone.  I don't think it's the pit bulls fault, I blame the person who turned that dog into a monster but sometimes they are too far gone to save.  I used to think that saving stray animals meant love, devotion and time no matter what but now I think that saving some does indeed mean euthanasia.  This is all a bummer, I know, but its necessary harsh truths you need to face for yourself to see if your skin is thick enough to bear it.  I've had a lot of very long, deep conversations and thoughts to make sure I was ready for this job after some very rough days.  When I first started it, family and friends asked questions and inevitably asked 'are there sad days, or is it mostly fun and rewarding?' and my honest answer is every single day is a little sad because every single day I have a group of new rescues needing homes and care.    I'm still here.  The clinic I volunteered at hired me full time and I love it.  These rescues might break my heart, the job might be crazy gross at times, but I'm making a difference.  For at least a few hours that day, that sweet rescue who is going back to the shelter for god knows how long had someone to hold them and love on them and tell them it'll be ok.  The dogs who were adopted at Christmas and then abandoned in January because they got to big/people didn't realize how hard it is to have a puppy broke my heart the most because they are desperate for you to love them.  The puppy mills dogs with terrible teeth and skin infections who cower at the back of the cage don't know what it's like to be held, so you hold them for a little while longer so they know not all people are bad while cleaning them up.  I pet a feral cat while it's being euthanized and apologize, but I know it's better than letting it suffer from feline aids/leukemia and spreading it to others.  I love talking to the people who do help, who have hearts of gold and are doing the right thing by these animals.  I argue with the misinformed and change their opinions, letting them go out better people than when they came in.  I partake in the gallows humor you develop with the other coworkers so you can get through the day without crying.  I scratch that special spot that makes the dogs leg twitch before sending them home.  I take time out to shave off their matted hair or trim their ridiculously long nails or pull rotten teeth even if the owners didn't specify to.  I love the animals that come through and I help their odds in getting better homes.    I don't want this to dissuade you, but you need to have a first hand knowledge of this.  Not enough research in the world prepared me for the actual job.  Can you handle the dog that wants to bite your head off?  Can you stick your head in a cage filled with parvo smelling bloody poop and clean it without gagging?  Can you wrap dead animals up to prepare for cremation?  Can you handle ignorant owners yelling at you over really stupid things, and then handing their sweet dog to them knowing they won't get treated as well as you would like?  Can you handle the emotional as well as physically aspects of the job?  Can you handle snide, bitchy co workers and micro-managing egotistical vets?  Of course you can handle all the good things, the real question to this job is if you can handle the bad without breaking down or quitting.  Volunteer, find someone who is willing to teach and mentor you, find a place that will let you get hands on.  You will only know through experience and can decide on schooling after the fact.  Sorry for the long post, but I figured some insight into the unsavory would help your decision."

The reviews on it are not great but after extensive research I have found this to be from people who don't have any experience yet. If you are already working in a vet clinic it is a great program. I can't imagine that doing an online program without first working in a hospital is a good idea. I would agree with volunteering first to be sure it's what you want to do before spending thousands on a program. It is a great career and I love what I do, but it is a very labor intensive and emotional job and many people find that it is not what they actually want to do after working in a hospital. Also finding the right fit is very important as this really tends to be a ""sink or swim"" field.   Best of luck to you and if you have any questions feel free to ask!"

VetTech,374lwv,miningfish,3,Mon May 25 15:53:22 2015 UTC,One of the techs who does part time at my clinic also works with a large animal vet so I'm lucky that I have that connection already. I'm in the rural Bay Area and we have a lot horses and cows around.
VetTech,374lwv,greeneyesontherise,1 point,Mon May 25 16:09:55 2015 UTC,That is pretty sweet. Good luck with your program! :-)
VetTech,374lwv,miningfish,2,Tue May 26 03:25:15 2015 UTC,I'm in the central valley of California so I'm sure I can find a large animal clinic but if not the San Juan College (which is the one I've been leaning towards) has a 3 day intensive workshop to get those requirements taken care of. To find a small animal clinic should I just call around and ask if they allow volunteers and/or shadowing as I am interested in beginning a vet tech program and want to get a feel for it? Or should I be applying for part-time work as an assistant?
VetTech,374lwv,miningfish,1 point,Mon May 25 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"I did not know they had that, that is a tremendous help.  I would ask if they are hiring, if not, ask about volunteering/shadowing. You may also only be able to volunteer/shadow if you can't work as many hours as they need a new hire to work. I would go in person if possible, have a resume on hand to give them, (They may also have you fill out an application) introduce yourself, explain in a concise way what you are looking for, and follow up with an email. Email is great for them, because they can get to it when they have a good time to do it, but meeting you in person leaves more of an impression."
VetTech,374lwv,aquafemme,3,Tue May 26 03:36:24 2015 UTC,I'm going to San Juan College online and have been having a good experience with it. You start with college prereqs then there are 4 Tiers of Vet Tech classes. You aren't required to be working at a clinic until Tier 2 but I strongly recommend getting into a clinic asap. The Tier 2 classes require putting in an IV catheter etc. You need to build trust with your coworkers before they're going to let you practice on the patients.
VetTech,374lwv,aquafemme,1 point,Sun May 24 23:09:42 2015 UTC,"I was actually looking into the program there, glad to hear it has been good for you. To find work with a clinic should I be volunteering or looking to be employed as an assistant of some kind?"
VetTech,374lwv,purpledragons,4,Sun May 24 23:16:43 2015 UTC,I was able to get a job as a Vet Asst. Showing I was enrolled in a Vet Tech program helped me get hired. Apply for VA positions (receptionist or kennel won't help you out much) but that does require some luck and/or excellent resume skills. I'd volunteer until you can get enough experience to get paid for it.
VetTech,373t05,rvtjess,5,Sun May 24 16:47:04 2015 UTC,"I'm an RVT and currently pregnant. I work in a fairly small, but busy practice. We have one Dr on surgery in the morning and one seeing appointments at the same time. We have one Dr on evening appointments. We have two techs on in the morning and one in the evening. The people I work with are really amazing, and have happily taken over duties that I can no longer do. I have completely stopped taking rads, which sometimes means that a Dr or the receptionist has to gown up to help restrain. I usually do all the set up and positioning and then quickly run out the room when the actual rad is taken.   I have stopped extubating patients, but I do still intubate and monitor surgery. I try to use the largest possible ET tube, and I turn on the O2 only to check the cuff (which is should be standard procedure anyways). I don't listen to check the cuff, I hand that off to someone else. Once we're sure the cuff is tight, we turn on the gas. For extubation, I hand it off to another tech/the Dr. I use gloves a lot more when I clean kennels etc and I'm more cautious about hand washing. I try to limit the amount of dentals I do, because you're really pretty close to the patients mouth and possible anaesthetic gas. But if you have a good tight cuff and an active scavenge system, your risk of exposure is really low.   Now that I'm 20 weeks and showing, I do find it harder to restrain large dogs on the floor and I'm more cautious about lifting heavy patients. But my coworkers have been amazing and have really had no problem stepping in to help out were I no longer can.   The only down side is that you'll have to tell work as soon as you find out you're pregnant. It's pretty hard to hide in our profession! In my experience it has been totally doable, but you definitely need understanding and helpful Co workers who don't mind taking on a few extra tasks. My office is 99% female, and about 80% have kids and have worked through pregnancy, so they're all pretty understanding. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
VetTech,373t05,PoisonDartFrog,1 point,Sun May 24 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"THANK you for the first hand experience! This helps out a lot and gives me some ideas. Makes me feel a little better knowing that I can still do a lot but not be completely useless for stuff like surgery and xrays.  I plan on letting my office manager know the day I even think I have a positive test, I won't hide it at all. I may hide it from friends and family until a few weeks though!"
VetTech,373t05,PoisonDartFrog,2,Sun May 24 19:13:15 2015 UTC,"I told work the day after I found out, so I was around 5 weeks, and the majority of my family and close friends after 13 weeks. It sucks because you'd have to tell work if something went wrong, which is fairly common in early pregnancy. But at the same time, exposure to rads and other chemicals is way more serious in early pregnancy.   I found this article very helpful.

Got a mask I could wear during surgery that is a high enough level to filter out gas.  However, I did still not recover patients.  They blow Iso forever. I agree - used gloves a hell of a lot more, tried to not be the restrainer on really fractious cats.  Talk to your co-workers.  Tell them your fears.  Just communicate.  Thats the key.  Good luck!"
VetTech,373t05,jadedgoldfish,1 point,Sun May 24 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"If anything, it's one of the doctors who will get bitchy, not the techs! Many of them have kids of their own and were pregnant while being a tech and have worked with other pregnant techs so they understand."
VetTech,373t05,jadedgoldfish,2,Mon May 25 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put my life plans on hold out of fear of inconveniencing my coworkers. If you have a good relationship with them they will be happy for you and will be fine managing what you can't do anymore. Just don't use pregnancy as an excuse to do nothing.   We've had two pregnant techs at my office, one still did all her duties but those she was physically unable to do, the other sat on her butt and mentioned the baby anytime she was paged. Guess which pregnancy was better received."
VetTech,373t05,Neryian,2,Sun May 24 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"You are so right. I worry so much about what other people think, but the people that truly matter to me in my life (family and close friends) would be ecstatic for us if we did become pregnant, so I guess I shouldn't worry much about what my work thinks :)  Also, yes! I have worked with both ""types"" of pregnant techs... one worked hard almost up until her due date, the other used it as an excuse for every single thing. Obnoxious. Promised myself I would never be that tech!"

She got out of dealing with all the old animals (bad breath), any induction of emesis, all abscesses and infected wounds, disimpactions, anal glands, and refused to take hospitalized patients because there would be dogs that would pee or poop and the smell would make her gag. If you can't deal with inpatient or outpatient, but are still scarfing down food 24/7, GTFO."

At best, maybe transport it to a vet (if it didn't try to bite you in the process) but at worst, your only other option was to finish the job :(  I know it hurts, and there isn't much you can do about it. I have witnessed a similar event, and felt just as awful.  You just move forward, and dedicate yourself to helping animals in your own way."
VetTech,372ff1,veracosa,1 point,Sun May 24 06:17:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with this . Shit happens, it is so so so crappy that this happened to you and obviously you feel remorse for the little guy so you can't picture yourself as some monster even tho its what you are feeling. People like us, who care, it would be concerning if you didnt feel like a monster. Personally I would have kicked it in reverse and ended it. But that is a choice that is not at all easy to make and if you can't do that it is 100% understandable and at that point then there is nothing else to do."
VetTech,36y4xt,MonstrousTurtles,6,Sat May 23 02:25:58 2015 UTC,"When I was starting out I volunteered at a spay/neuter clinic. A very kind doctor suggested I express the cats  (already anesthetized, so much more cooperative) while they are sternal.  It really helped me get confident with locating and feeling the bladder. Now I can palpate in any position and know the right pressure and push to express.    So palpate them sternal! The bladder just falls right into your hand.  Practice makes perfect! Eventually you will be teaching others!"
VetTech,36y4xt,mllecarling,1 point,Sat May 23 03:57:47 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, great idea! Time to palate all the bladders!"
VetTech,36y4xt,boba-boba,6,Fri Jun 5 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of practice on anesthetized patients first. Then, we had this kitten who was deformed at birth and incontinent and with only partial use of his bladder muscles, this was another good opportunity for me to learn because we had to palpate and express his bladder regularly.  Working urine out of a bladder in a motion towards the urethra helped with the kitten."
VetTech,36y4xt,Lanaowl,5,Sat May 23 02:53:29 2015 UTC,"For any euthanasia, if they haven't voided their bladder alredy, go ahead and express. It will require significantly less pressure, but you'll get a good feel for where the bladder is and what it should feel like. Anesthetized animals are also great practice. Work on thin cats and small dogs first, and then work your way up to bigger cats that are going to be more difficult to feel.  Do you have ultrasound in your clinic? That can help you look at what size you should be expecting to feel."
VetTech,36y4xt,jadedgoldfish,4,Sat May 23 03:35:53 2015 UTC,This. You can learn so much on euthanized patients. Don't be afraid. Use them as a learning opportunity :)

VetTech,36y4xt,RedgrassFieldOfFire,1 point,Mon May 25 12:34:45 2015 UTC,"I have to teach a lot of owners to express their dogs' bladders at home following back surgery, and sometimes it goes really smoothly, sometimes they can't get it on their first try and they become very frustrated, and I have to remind them that they'll get better at it with practice. First of all, yes, it is possible to rupture a bladder with excessive force, especially in male dogs or any animal with a urinary obstruction or bladder disease (including pressure necrosis secondary to urinary obstruction), so don't just crank down as hard as you can- firm, steady pressure is best, and it may take several seconds of pressure on the bladder before they start to urinate. My advice to you is try to remember the overall health of the animal- what is their signalment? Why is it beneficial/necessary to express the bladder? What is the risk of bladder rupture in this animal? Does the benefit of expressing this animal's bladder outweigh the risk? If a doctor is asking you to express a bladder, they have (hopefully) already considered all of this before making the decision, but they are still relying on you to use your judgement and report back to them if you are uncomfortable with the amount of force you feel that you have to apply."
VetTech,36y4xt,onemanutopia,1 point,Mon May 25 16:22:45 2015 UTC,If you have the opportunity express the bladders on deceased patients. If the client is taking their pet home it is always nice to express the bladder anyway. If you are just putting it in the freezer for cremation services to pick up it is still nice to express the bladder before baggingthem up to prevent a mess on your or helper techs. Either way it is a win win. :)

VetTech,36e6t8,Darkangelmystic79,2,Thu May 21 12:41:04 2015 UTC,I can't even write this without twitching... I had a vet who indulged his clients FAR too much and sent the dog home to his doctor owners (surgeon and psychiatrist) with an IVC and pre-measured doses of epi and atropine for when he would arrest again (and again) overnight.  The same dr also tried to use an insulin bath as anesthesia for cosmetic surgery on a goldfish.

VetTech,36e6t8,walsh_vn,5,Tue May 19 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"Probably the most ridiculous (yet horrifying) conversation I had was with a woman that called to say that no, she was not a client, but her neighbor had given her some Gabapentin to give to her dog to help with seizures. Neighbors dog was quite large, this woman's dog was tiny. No, she could not afford an exam to see a doctor, yes, she was sure she was going to give the Gabapentin to her dog no matter what, and why should she have to see a doctor? Why can't I (a receptionist, mind you) just give her the correct dosage? She ended by yelling at me, ""if my dog dies because you won't help me, I'm going to drive off a cliff and kill myself.""   The second one off the top of my head was the woman that called with a cat that was lethargic, difficulty breathing, etc. and she casually mentioned that she was going to dose it with cannabis oil before leaving for the emergency visit.  Which reminds me of the man that brought his dog in for a euthanasia and casually let me know that he had given it ""three nugs of pot on the way over"". That poor dog was terrified."

""NO. I don't want you to touch him. You won't know anything.  Just go and get the vet NOW."" So I go and get my vet who asks me why the exam sheet is blank and why I didn't get a history/exam.  I tell him why.  He goes in and explains to them that if they refuse to let the tech do their job or treat all our staff with respect, that they are free to leave and seek treatment elsewhere.  The tech will do the initial exam and history taking or you ain't seeing a vet here today! And they were very apologetic and cooperative after that."

I explained to her that no it does not need to be given twice a day it is a one time a day medicine. She was like well, I feed him twice  day could I give half the dose and then the other half later? I said again, no, it is a medicine that is to be given at the labeled dosage only once a day!

VetTech,36e9xx,thatlovelyredhead,6,Mon May 18 18:34:52 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on whether you plan on staying where you are. I work with a very talented assistant who has worked for years as an unlicensed tech in the south. Her husband is in the army and they moved across the country and she cannot get a job as a tech here without a license (I am in the PNW). We are very strict here with hiring LVTs versus unlicensed techs. She is now going to school to get her license, because she sees the worth in the degree and she has a the guarantee of getting a job anywhere in the US as a tech. In the long run, it is a very good idea if you want stability and a higher wage. You never know what the veterinary field's laws will be like in the future. Ten years from now it could be hard to get a job as a tech without a license.  That being said, in my personal opinion I think being registered/certified/licensed is a huge asset. You are essentially a pet nurse. Humans nurses have to be certified, and I think it should be the same with VTs."
VetTech,36e9xx,ciscrazy,2,Tue May 19 18:45:35 2015 UTC,"The answers to these questions will vary everywhere you go. I just graduated from the program at my local comm college and feel like I learned a lot of theory that I wouldn't necessarily pick up on the job. It has enabled me to make more educated choices and catch more doctor mistakes on the job. I got a pay raise when I graduated and I will get another when I pass my boards. At my clinic, cvts are allowed to do more procedures than non certified techs. As much as it sucks for those that are not certified, I am a believer in the push to get more perks for certified techs and I think that our field should be more like the human side in that a lot of the things techs do should require certification. By no means am I trying to illegitimize what experienced uncertified techs do. There is just a huge difference in what I knew about anesthesia from on the job training and what I know now after schooling."
VetTech,36e9xx,samrarhuasa,2,Tue May 19 18:50:16 2015 UTC,"I saw your post in the /r/askvet thread, and I wound up following it here to see what other Vet Techs have to say. For what it's worth, here's my two cents.  I worked as ""vet tech"" for a mixed animal practice for a few years, and did all kinds of things in that capacity. I worked cattle, monitored anesthesia for small animal patients, performed occasional dental prophylaxis, and ran some basic lab work. I decided to go to school so I would have a better understanding of what I was doing. There's a lot of poo-pooing school in this thread, and I have to disagree.   I recently graduated from an AVMA accredited institution, and the things I learned there over the last two years have been incredibly valuable. It's gotten me a pay raise (with another to come after I pass the VTNE) and pushed me to place of higher responsibility in a new job at a new clinic. Clinics that are AAHA compliant need licensed technicians. To stay compliant with AAHA regulations, only veterinarians or RVT's can perform dental prophylaxis or anesthetize patients.   A lot of people will tell you that the experience you pick up on the job is valuable, and I agree completely. I don't think that experience is necessarily more valuable than education, however. For example, I feel that school has made me a much more competent anesthetist simply because I have a better understanding of the drugs I'm administering and how they can effect our patients. I feel much more confident talking to clients about their patient's prescribed treatment plan because I've gained a thorough education in this field. I feel better talking to my employers, because I understand a lot more of what they're saying.   I'm a much better lab technician, and my skills have allowed my current employer to increase the amount of in house lab work we can do.   If you're going to go to school, I think that's great. You'll intern over the summer and learn a lot, and if you go to a good program you'll get a lot of hands on experience. Just make sure that you go to an AVMA accredited school. Don't waste your money on an institution that isn't accredited."
VetTech,36e9xx,wompemsauce,3,Thu May 21 23:07:28 2015 UTC,"Here is my honest opinion. Getting an RVT license is useless. Yes it is  a sense of accomplishment but in the long run you won't get paid more. Im an emergency tech and i get paid just as much as the person who has a license. The benefit they get? They get to do all the euthanasias that the doctors no longer have to do because their techs are now licensed. Ive been doing this for 2 years. Dropped out of the rvt program after being 5 classes away from finishing the program and being able to sit for boards. It just isn't worth it. I love animals, I love emergency, but I also love money and being able to do things such as fine dining and vacations....being a tech I will never be able to accomplish those things. I work 50 hours a week and all my OT gets taxed. At the end of the day just beware what the career as a tech is going to provide for you. This will be my last year teching as I am currently moving on into a much better paying career that I will still enjoy. At the end of the day obtaining a license makes your hospital look better. Will you learn from going to a tech school? Absolutely, but you wil learn A LOT more from experience. Hope this helps."
VetTech,36e9xx,SeeknDestroy55,0,Tue May 19 07:01:55 2015 UTC,"I've only worked with like two certified techs in five years, and they couldn't really do anything I couldn't, but that would depend on how good your on the job training is. One of them was paid exactly the same as me, and the other made like a dollar more. These were at different hospitals though. I've worked at a few hospitals, and have been told by several doctors that they don't like certified techs for various reasons."
