I don't hang around there that much though, for some reason.  /u/cojoco moderates both this sub and that sub.  /r/coontown does a good job astroturfing because they organize their brigades off-site, on an IRC channel.   For a while there were a bunch of ""wounded warrior"" pics posted to /r/pics that all made it to the top. People accused the military of astroturfing that, but I don't know that that was ever proven.  As shown from the /u/unidan scandal, it doesn't take many external votes to get your content traction and noticed on reddit.  I'm unsubscribed to /r/pics so I don't know what's happening there.   According to /r/coontown, the founding moderator of /r/gasthekikes, a guy who went by the name /u/eaglehigh, and then had his account banned and returned as /u/eaglehigher, then /u/eagleshigh, then /u/eaglezhigh, etc, was IP-banned as of a couple weeks ago, even before spez returned.

The astroturfing on reddit really got into full swing around the time of Occupy Wall Street. Reddit was hugely in favor and lots of those ""signboard"" posts were making it to the front page on an hourly basis. Some were really stupid, most were very heartfelt.   Like 2 days into that, suddenly commentary on OWS became very negative in every sub (I think we still had /r/reddit.com then), and it's been kinda downhill here in the news and politics subs ever since. Very supportive of the wealthy and libertarianism, very disgruntled about social issues of all stripes (except for a few ""approved"" wedge issues with little or no economic consequence like gay marriage), and so on.

She finds it objectifying and demeaning. To have them stop would be something she would find to be a positive happy experience, because to experience them she has declared is negative and demeaning.  However, once those catcalls has stopped, she is also unhappy because the absence of such attention is not a positive one....despite whatever the underlying reason might be.  So basically, which ever way men act, she is going to be unhappy with them.  And that is the contradiction."

undelete,3dxobd,not_a_throwaway23,39,Mon Jul 20 11:49:40 2015 UTC,"What's ridiculous is that the comments all were centered towards politics, not the actually TIL itself.   It's still a very real problem.  Ignoring insurance and the politics surrounding that, the biggest problem with health care as I see it is that there are no up front standard costs.   If I call up a hospital and I want to get my rotator cuff repaired, or a knee replaced, any kind of elective surgery, they should be able to give me an estimate on how much it costs, sure there can be complications and what not, add on the list of costs of whatever you need later.  It's kind of like going to the first auto repair place and having them fix your car, and whatever they charge you, you're going to pay.  If everyone got their cars fixed without knowing the costs, then there will essentially be no competition, so prices will inflate out of control like hospitals are now.  They already have you, they already did the work, so you have to pay."
undelete,3dxobd,gid0ze,15,Mon Jul 20 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"Its much worse than that metaphor explains however, because the hospital never sends you a simple itemized bill like an auto repair shop would. Instead you end up getting separate bills from half dozen to a dozen or more different billing departments and only one of them will actually be the hospital.  Worse, if this is life saving care and the hospital decides you're destitute enough to qualify for their charity care... guess what? That only applies towards the hospital bill! The other 5-12+ bills will be considered outside firms & not participate in that.  So to use the auto repair shop metaphor a little deeper, it would go like this:   Bill from the garage building owner to pay for your time in the bay (aka OR, the only bill you actually get for the hospital). Bill from the mechanic (aka specialist who performed the surgery) Bill from the diagnostic tool scanner (aka radiology). Bill from the hydrolic lift (aka anesthesiology) Bill from the snap on tool dealer when he stops by (aka pharmacy for the after-care prescriptions) Bill from the mechanic from the next bay over who briefly stops by your bay to check on your car & promptly leaves, doing nothing at all besides introducing himself. (This will be a bill from some doctor you have never heard of, in a specialty that doesn't have to do with your hospital stay: there may be a series of these depending on how many specialists sneak into your room during your stay). Bill from the junkyard that supplied the replacement fender (aka company that supplies the artificial joint parts) Bill from the lot boy who took the car out front for you to pick it up (aka medical transport company since you're immobile from getting a new joint). Bill from the detailer who washed the car before you picked it up (aka physical therapy).   Note that each of the above will use a different billing department, have different policies on insurance participation and/or charity care.  Anyone who runs a business like that in any field other than healthcare would go out of business in a hurry. But if it is healthcare? We accept it as normal."

When you pretend it doesn't break the rules, you prove that people refuse to have honest conversation about the rules and actually reinforce it existing. A big part of why that rule exists is because you can't discuss those topics without people burying their heads in the sand in order to tell themselves sweet little lies about how it is, like that this didn't break the rules when it very clearly does.

The fact that the votes can't decide is such a basic issue of the sight it's been in the site FAQ for years.  The fact that lies contradicted by their own source can make it to the front page proves that ""oh just let the votes decide"" is naive and frankly stupid in practice, making everything you just spouted meaningless.  Furthermore, none of that even matters. Saying ""the users should decide"", even if it wasn't a blatantly stupid position that ignores hivemind behavior, does NOT mean saying ""it doesn't break the rule"" suddenly becomes an honest argument to replace ""I don't like the rule with."" It's still a lie people say to make it sound worse than it is, because you can't argue your point honestly. That's why people like you lose all your influence, you'd rather lie and feel right than argue honestly an risk having your misinformed claptrap challenged.

Subreddits exist specifically for separation of content.  The fact that you argue from dishonest positions, ignorance, oh and some good ol fallacies like putting all mods in the same group, is why you will never have any influence at all. You'd rather stroke yourself than make a difference. That's fine, whatever makes you happy. But don't try to sell me on your bullshit lies like it's not my job to keep TIL accurate.

The reason there are separate subreddits is to allow niche communities to form, instead of having one monolithic overall community. These communities distinguish themselves with a unique focus, look and policies: what's on- and off-topic there, whether people are expected to behave civilly or can feel free to be brutal, etc.   Hmm, a unique focus, like fun facts or something... facts that need to be accurate because that's part of the focus, which is decided by the creator/mods.

I was specifically saying OTHER PEOPLE will come in and do that. You can tell I meant other people because if I had been talking about you I wouldn't have said ""someone will come."" I would say ""you will say.""   A post being #1 for 11 hours and then being removed doesn't seem weird to you?    No. They've explained it. I just explained it to you.   They don't read their own subs until a certain # of reports?   Sometimes that number until it gets on the frontpage is zero, and yes plenty of mods end up burned out on the communities they manage.   I've tested it. Others have tested it directly here. I've seen it several times and literally every single time someone tested it it verified what I just said. Feel free to test it yourself.

Also that you were spreading misinformation. You claimed you don't know why they wait. My point is they don't wait. That's misinformation you're spreading based on your own poor reasoning from your own misinformation.  I don't know why I bothered though.

Interesting that this bestof post was deleted, doesn't seem to have broken any of the rules, it's more likely that a mod didn't want to be associated with allowing a post criticizing spez like that to be seen.  Rule #9 states:   The moderators reserve the right to remove posts, users, and comments at their own discretion.   People are arguing in the comments on what we should do about hate speech, and I'd like to argue that we simply combat them with intellectual arguments to their points and then leave them be. The individuals who seek out that sort of ideology are already convinced that their ignorance is the correct way to go about things, censoring them is just going to push them to try harder. Sure this is a private website, but when the founders stated that they'd like to imagine that the founding fathers of America would have like to view this place as a bastion of free speech... they should stick with that sentiment."

If there's an anti Israel circlejerk going and I fancy an online argument on I often disrupt it. Usually in places like reddit I'm in a minority but I don't care. You don't need mods to censor anti Israel comments. These people are out there. Probably most of them consider themselves progressives who are 'socking it to the global hegemon' as Hurry Up Harry once put it  http://hurryupharry.org/2012/07/18/the-canary-in-the-guardians-coal-mine/   For a decade now, ever since Seumas Milne, the former Business Manager of the Stalinist Straight Left newspaper was installed as Comment Editor of The Guardian, the newspaper and its associated web venture, Comment is Free, has been a happy home for anti-Israel obsessives, Hamas supporters, and activists in fringe far Left political parties.  I should make one  thing clear. The reason that this has happened is not that the CIF clique are antisemites. Rather, they are America-haters, from the fine old British tradition with its roots in both upper middle class elites and the far Left. None of these people see themselves as Jew haters. They see themselves as progressives, at the vanguard of opposition to “imperialism” and injustice. They honestly believe themselves to be good people, doing important work. When they publish and promote people who want to kill Jews – even as they congratulate themselves for their opposition to “racism in a digital age” – it is because they think they’re socking it to the global hegemon. For those on the far Left, that is the USA:  some of those they publish believe that it is Israel and the Jews who are pulling the strings of power. However, that’s no biggie. Seumas Milne supports them all, and gave them column space, for the same reason that he supported ”militants”  in Iraq who killed British servicemen.   Now don't get me wrong, I disagree with pretty much all of the progressive world view - particularly the idea that Israel or the US are more evil than their opponents. Still I don't think political views should be censored. Then we'll end up like Sweden/Germany etc where everyone claims to be progressive in public for fear of being fired but in practice everyone is very racist in private. I.e. censoring racist and anti Semitic opinions is fundamentally counter productive - you drive them underground. And one day they'll emerge and censor you. In a free market of ideas they will simply be marginalised. You can see that in the way that the US does not censor the far right or the far left and yet both are effectively marginalised. Meanwhile in Europe the amount of censorship needed to keep extremists down seems to increase all the time."

It also isn't a ToS violating to use services that don't cause adverse effect or interfere with reddit.   That said, Rule 30 of the user agreement, which is the one you are referring to, doesn't pertain to moderator deleted comments. It only applies to comments that a user has deleted or edited on their own. It's also extremely an vague rule, because the following scenario is technically a user agreement violation under that rule:  I make a comment, you reply to my comment and quote my comment word for word. I edit (or delete) my original comment, the one you quoted, but you don't edit (or delete) your quote of my comment. You have technically violated rule 30.  Craziness!

There is definitely pro-Israeli brigading taking place on a regular basis. There are even news articles about how Israel pays people to spread pro-Israeli propaganda online. Here's one article from a couple years ago that was in USA Today.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/  If you point out what's going on on /r/worldnews you're reflexively accused of being an anti-Semite/conspiracist to try and discredit you and shut you up.

You will be paid and additional $5 per email/contact info if it's clearly identifiable from their Reddit username.

Plus, even just Googling my username, there are others with the same name on other sites (e.g. I have never written Sailor Moon fan-fiction). That may be true for any username they come across.

undelete,3dsi69,odedbe,44,Sun Jul 19 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Here is my comment that wound up getting wiped twice along with many others -  Third time posting this after all the top posts seemed to have been wiped for no explicable reason.  As far as I can tell, I had breached no rules aside from pointing out facts.  Mods, if you can tell me which part of this comment has infringed on any rules, let me know. As far as I can tell, everything I have written is factual and backed by sources I have provided.    Israel is the only state with nukes that has threatened to attack population centers all over the world (including neutral/allied non-belligerent nations i.e. Russian/European capitals).  That is the definition of terrorism.   We blame North Korea and Iran for trying to develop nuclear weapons yet here's Israel with hundreds of warheads threatening to end everybody.  Not even North Korea has ever claimed they would nuke non-belligerents and especially not allies like China when faced with an existential threat.   Hersh includes two quotations from Israeli leaders. He writes that a ""former Israeli govt official"" with ""first hand knowledge of his government’s nuclear weapons program"" told him: We can still remember the smell of Auschwitz and Treblinka. Next time we’ll take all of you with us.[9]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Samson_Option:_Israel%27s_Nuclear_Arsenal_and_American_Foreign_Policy   In 2003, a military historian, Martin van Creveld, thought that the Al-Aqsa Intifada then in progress threatened Israel's existence.[29] Van Creveld was quoted in David Hirst's The Gun and the Olive Branch (2003) as saying:  We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force. Let me quote General Moshe Dayan: 'Israel must be like a mad dog, too dangerous to bother.' I consider it all hopeless at this point. We shall have to try to prevent things from coming to that, if at all possible. Our armed forces, however, are not the thirtieth strongest in the world, but rather the second or third. We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.[30]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option#Writers.27_comments_on_the_strategy  Also, the comment that followed it -    The book in full is quite clear and refers to Americans in general -  http://www.vho.org/aaargh/fran/livres10/SamsonOption.pdf  A longer excerpt goes as follows -    For Ben Gurion, the lesson was clear: the Jewish community in America was unable to save Israel.  ""You Americans screwed us,"" one former Israeli government official said, recalling his feelings  at the time. ""If you hadn't intervened, Na sser would have been toppled and the arms race in the  Middle East would have been delayed. Israel would have kept its military and technological  edge. Instead, here comes the golf player Ike, dumb as can be, saying in the name of humanity  and evenhandednes s that 'we won't allow colonial powers to play their role.' He doesn't realize  that Nasser's reinforced and Israel's credibility is being set back.""  The Israeli, who has firsthand knowledge of his government's nuclear weapons program, added  bitterly: ""We g ot the message. We can still remember the smell of Auschwitz and Treblinka.  Next time we'll take all of you with us.""   Hersh himself also isn't one to embellish or lie - his reputation is quite stellar as an investigative journalist.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Hersh   the second is by a writer who has no affiliation with the government who didn't even finish out his mandatory military service time let alone determine Israeli military doctrine.   And yet he is still a highly regarded military history teaching the Security Studies program at Tel Aviv University.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_van_Creveld  He also has close contact with and even quotes an Israeli general and all of these quotes line up with other historical facts and quotes."

I have specifically stated that it was for MAD purposes, i.e.   Not even North Korea has ever claimed they would nuke non-belligerents and especially not allies like China when faced with an existential threat.   I merely pointed out the glaring issue that Israel would nuke allies/neutral parties not involved which is unprecedented for a nuclear power, especially one that has the capabilities to actually follow through with it's threats while we point a finger at Iran or North Korea when their nuclear policies are actually far less dangerous than Israel's,   You aren't discussing the documentary, and you clearly have a political agenda to your post   Originally it was a relevant reply but that entire thread was deleted.  If pointing out facts is having a political agenda, then okay, sure.  Holding such views, however, did not violate any rules and in a supposed 'free speech zone', it is even more heinous.   and I understand the mods not wanting to turn the subreddit into a vast political discussion regarding Israel, where usually it quickly escalates into personal attacks.

undelete,3dw6cc,FrontpageWatch,2,Mon Jul 20 01:10:21 2015 UTC,"Let me give you the particulars before I get into the story. I am a single, 22 year old female, and would consider myself to have a healthy sexual appetite. That being the case, I have had partners in the past tell me that I tend to be a bit more on the aggressive side compared to other women they have slept with.  Yesterday my friends and I decided to go out drinking and dancing. We entered a club we have never been to before, when I spotted this dude sitting at a table with a bunch of other guys. I noticed him almost right away since the hanging light over their table illuminated his face like a beam of light from heaven; this guy was so painfully attractive it hurt. My friends and I grabbed a table and a few drinks before hitting the dance floor. It wasn't long before the guy and his friends entered the dance floor from the opposite side of the room. I shuffled my way though the crowd and ""haphazardly"" started dancing with him. After he offered to buy me a drink, it was pretty obvious were things were headed.  I don't go home with casuals very often but when I do I like to see the surprise on their face when I initiate fun-times, especially when its obvious they are used to making the first move. It was obvious this guy liked the power struggle of it so we ended throwing each other around a bit.  Skip forward to this morning when I'm woken up by this guy in bed beside me absolutely freaking out about not being able to see and retinal tears and degeneration in his eyes. So I called the ambulance and went with him to make sure he was ok. I could feel my face go beat red with embarrassment while he is giving the paramedic information about how he thinks the throttling we gave each other caused the degenerative holes in his retina to tear and cause blindness and that he should have had laser surgery sooner.  I am currently in the waiting room of a hospital waiting to hear back about a guy I honestly can't remember the name of. :S  TLDR: Fucked a guy's retinas off    UPDATE: Reddit you saved me from an awkward situation!! 40 mins after being in the waiting room, Good-Girl-Gina-Nurse saved my ass! 30 mins or so after, she brought him out to the waiting room wearing a padded eye patch on the right eye and was surprised I hung around for so long. He seemed in relatively good spirits and said he could really go for some sherbert, so we went down to the hospital's cafeteria. I told him he was internet famous and asked if he used reddit, which he did not, but we spent the next hour laughing at all your comments.  He wanted to keep his name anonymous but thanks you from the bottom of his heart for all the concern and shared laughs. He also wanted you to know that his retina's are doing good, are on the mend, and will regain complete vision again.  He said the whole ordeal kinda went down like this.  Update#2: Dear u/Lostzilla815 who wrote me a message titled ""You are a slut"" and saying ""You should only sleep with a boyfriend""  You are a basement dweller and you should really shave your neckbeard. <3"

undelete,3dsvah,-moose-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:26:16 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of Controlled opposition :      A controlled opposition is a protest movement that is actually being led by government agents. Nearly all governments in history have employed this technique to trick and subdue their adversaries. Notably Vladimir Lenin who said ''""The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.""     Count Mirabeau was part of the controlled opposition, because although everyone thought he was supporting the revolution, in reality he supported the monarchy and was a personal friend of the king. He was a government agent.    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

undelete,3dlqmk,SuperConductiveRabbi,3,Sat Jul 18 04:54:18 2015 UTC,"The frequency with which it was being posted has no bearing on the fact that mods (you?) deleted it from the frontpage numerous times.   It kinda does. :) When one particular type of content begins to dominate a general interest subreddit (and by ""general interest"", I mean wide variety of topics are meant to be posted, subs in this category would include /r/Pics, /r/Videos, /r/AskReddit, etc) then steps need to be taken to mitigate that so other types of content isn't being overrun and drowned out.   Having one particular type of content dominate a subreddit for weeks & months on end drags the subreddit quality down significantly. It dilutes the subreddit. Some people may want that content, and that's fine, but there are plenty of people who don't, too. And since we're a default subreddit, we have to even more careful of this phenomena. It's fortunate that there are robust subreddits dedicated specifically to that type of content. Reddit didn't create the subreddit system so people could try and cram all available topics into one single subreddit/community, they did it to segment off those interests and allow individual communities to form around those interests. They state exactly that right here.   deleted it from the frontpage numerous times.   This is probably the most misleading and irrelevant part of your comment. It's misleading because the implication is we removed those submissions because of the topic itself when that wasn't true. Any time we remove something it's because it breaks the rules in our sidebar. The person may have worded their title incorrectly, lied, exaggerated, editorialized, etc... I do admit we are pedantic when it comes to our rules. But we have to be due to our massive size. However, again, there are plenty of examples of us allowing those exact same articles as well.   Need more proof? There was one user here (about 8-9 months back) who complained about us deleting their male domestic abuse post. I showed up, talked to him, then helped him reword his title to fit our rules and he resubmitted it just fine. More often than not, instead of politely asking us why something was removed, or if we could assist them in getting their submission approved, they immediately accuse of us being nazi jew aliens. Actually, now I think they've it's en vogue to call us either SRS, MRA, or SJW depending on what we removed. A couple months back I had someone call me a SJW and a MRA in the same day. :) And to be blunt; I don't give a shit about politics, I only care about our rules. When you've been doing this as long as I have, your own political ideology, biases, and views get severely muted. Maybe it's my age, but the truth is I'm relatively judicial when it comes to our rules. I don't care if I despise a submission's topic, so long as it doesn't break the rules, it can stay.    Again, this is an article that the TIL mods have not once permitted to exist on the frontpage.   Is it the FBI one? That one has definitely been on the front page, not once, but at least 3 separate times. Conveniently, the users who submitted those articles have deleted them and/or their accounts so they no longer show up in search. If you don't want to take my word for it, I'm pretty sure I purposefully commented in one some months back just so I could find it later due to this very reason. I'm pretty familiar with their M.O now. If it's not the FBI one, do you have a link to the article so I can check myself?  Keep in mind, these people are submitting not something they learned today, but to push an agenda. So they're more likely to scrub their history once their goal has been achieved. Which actually works against them. It may make it harder for me to find those submissions and prove it (not impossible though), but it makes it less likely for other people to stumble upon it themselves through searching, browsing, etc...    Translation: you can post shitty sources if we agree   So you're OK with people using subreddits to push their political agendas? Do you think that's something that should be encouraged? I'm sorry, but I don't share that opinion. What if it's an agenda you don't agree with? What if people were using it to push SRS type content, or SJW content? Would you be fine with that? I wouldn't.   When there's a semi-organized group of people looking to use our subreddit as a platform to push their ideology (no matter the ideology), yeah, I don't want any part of it and you're damn right I don't agree with it. I don't care if it's SRS, SJWs or MRAs - no agenda pushing period. I'm to old for that SJW/MRA shit anyways. When I was in my 20s I might have cared, now? Yeah, no. :)    with the politics behind the content   We don't allow political content per rule 4 in our sidebar so if something is political, it's getting nuked.    doesn't prove your claim that you're not biased against this topic.    I helped a user here get his male domestic abuse submission posted. Did you want me to dig that up or do you remember me doing it for him? If I'm biased, I'm not going to go out of my way to help someone, and  walk them through our rules to allow them to post it.    and you know that a single thread you failed to delete doesn't prove your claim that you're not biased against this topic.    It proves we allow them through. End of story, really. We have no control over commenting or voting. If someone submits something and it isn't successful or doesn't get 10,000 votes, that's not on us. We have zero control over that. We can't force people to vote them up. All we can do is allow it through, after that, it's no longer in our hands. Literally. It's incredibly misleading and extremely dishonest to hold us responsible for the outcome of those submissions. To hold us accountable for something we cannot control.   everything can be twisted to be considered ""political"" under TIL's rules.   If something might be political even slightly, it's probably going to get removed. I've said this many times here before. We'll err on the side of caution most of the time. We just don't want political content within our sub. People trying to use loopholes or justify why something isn't political usually means it's political enough to remove. Here's an analogy: If I say I don't want sugar in my coffee because I'm allergic to it, that doesn't mean you can put honey in it. It doesn't mean to go ahead and put fructose syrup in it. It also doesn't mean you can put brown sugar in it ... it means I don't want any sugar in my coffee. That's how we feel about political content.   Thankfully we have /r/undelete to so easily demonstrate how poorly constructed your lie is.   Sure, you can use this subreddit to show deleted content. But before you try to show any sorts of trends, like you attempt to do here, make sure you use the search function within our subreddit as well to see how many of those same articles we allowed through, as well. Because if you don't, then you're purposefully omitting essential information and lying by omission. :)"

It really says a lot about the strength of a person's arguments and convictions when they only argue them up to the point where it is convenient and self-serving to do so, but refrains going past any point that could potentially put those arguments and convictions in any sort of public jeopardy."

undelete,3dlqmk,SuperConductiveRabbi,4,Sat Jul 18 04:42:14 2015 UTC,"I assume you are talking about this one particular post:   https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2kdg2n/333501261_til_male_victims_of_domestic_violence/   and its repost:   https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/39kxqb/5045332_til_male_victims_of_domestic_violence_who/   ...if you check it out, the reasoning given for the removal was that the headline was not supported by the linked article. And I actually looked at the article, and nowhere did it explicitly say what OP claimed it did. Also, OP claiming that any data or outcomes observed in this one particular study equate to demonstrable and unquestionable FACTS, as OP insinuates in their headline, is grossly misleading and inaccurate. They didn't say ""a study suggests"" or ""in a study of 129 instances, researchers found"", or any other sort of qualifiers... the OP plainly and flat out stated, as if it was a fact, that you are ""statistically more likely"", which is not a fact. Furthermore, this submission, which is also on the list, which uses the same exact source, is doing the same exact thing... posing results from one study as if they are unquestionable facts. Not sure if you know or not, but the results from one particular social experiment/study do not equal unquestionable facts that pertain to the entire country at large.  It is helpful if you actually look into the things you are being outraged about before you start being outraged by them. It would save yourself a lot of stress. Also, pretending that those two removals, which were justified, equal a 'censorship' trend on the topic is certainly reaching quite a bit, IMO. Show me some removals on the topic that have accurate headlines, I might take your claims more seriously... but I've not seen that yet.  Edit: clarity"
