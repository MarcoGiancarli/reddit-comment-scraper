Ghosts,3e1iev,snowbirdie,-3,Tue Jul 21 06:32:59 2015 UTC,"Everyone has sleep paralysis at some point. It's not at all paranormal so your ""true story"" is nothing but a dream that is well documented by science. So boring. So redundant. If you like tales, post to /r/nosleep."

Ghosts,3e0o8f,TTMcGeee,26,Tue Jul 21 01:30:41 2015 UTC,I think you need a camera from this millennium
Ghosts,3e0o8f,ZeboTheClown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:34 2015 UTC,It was on an iphone 5 actually. And it's grainy because it was about to rain. There was a tornado warning during my tour.

St. Augustine has a long-standing reputation for weird spooky shit on account of being half a century old, but those ghost tours should be taken as a hokey (if entertaining) tourist trap even on the best of days."

Ghosts,3e0o8f,digitalyss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:09 2015 UTC,I know what ghost tours are and I took this photo myself just to see if I would see anything. Sifting back through my photos I found this.
Ghosts,3e0o8f,digitalyss,5,Tue Jul 21 11:07:27 2015 UTC,"Serious question, what kind of camera did you use? Why is it so grainy?"
Ghosts,3e0o8f,j4wn33n0,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"Because it's a shitty point and shoot digital with flash turned on and horrible self exposure capabilities. Digital cameras should not be used in near total darkness without proper training and equipment, neither of which OP has."
Ghosts,3e0o8f,mobilebeta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:25 2015 UTC,"How does it have self exposure? When I was directing the camera above my head and as far away from my body as I could get. Also, everyone in the your was behind me. We couldn't go into the cemetery since it was gated. And the camera is inside gate lines when I took it. And how Cana figure like that show up from double exposure?"
Ghosts,3dv880,pistachia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:15:49 2015 UTC,They definitely look odd
Ghosts,3dv880,littlehalo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"It honestly looks to me like two people who were walking and caused a poor exposure.   I've seen a lot of pictures from Manassas (that's where this is, right?) and some of them had some freaky things in them, so maybe you did get something, but my vote is for two normal people walking through that tall grass."
Ghosts,3dv880,garvap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:15:39 2015 UTC,yep Manassas :)  finally found a place to post it - so I did haha. I just think it's odd that the person on the right side did not have that illuminating/transparent aura
Ghosts,3dv880,garvap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:03 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a cool picture :) I think the reason the person on the right didn't have the transparency was because they're also taking a picture, so they would have been standing still, at least long enough for the pic to be taken.   That's a really cool area. I saw some pics one time from the same general area as this pic - this monument, the Lewis House, around that area - that were taken right at dusk. Could have been artifacts in the film, could have been pareidolia, something like that, but it really looked like there were lines of soldiers standing just in front of the tree line.   Be sure to dig in your other photos - you may have more that you just haven't noticed yet!"
Ghosts,3dv880,lookingforaforest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:37 2015 UTC,"I've had a lot of experiences at Manassas Battlefield, I took a picture that was similar to what you took.  I was walking with a friend and I was taking pictures while he recorded on a video and when I was reviewing the pictures later that night, I saw a figure very similar-looking to the figures on the right, at least in color/aura/transparency.  It was the figure of a man that was peering from behind a tree and it was clear he was wearing a hat.  The video showed nothing surrounding the tree, nothing that could be misinterpreted as a person.  It was the first time I ever got anything on camera there, but not the first or last strange event that happened to me there.  Sorry for any errors, I'm on mobile."

Ghosts,3dphjz,seeingredagain,4,Sat Jul 18 07:10:58 2015 UTC,"We've talked about it and she said that it's nothing major, but things like cabinet doors and drawers open in the morning after everyone has been in bed all night, finding things in places that they shouldn't be, there was a glass bulb Christmas ornament that exploded just sitting on the table. I get most concerned with what my youngest nephew has said. He used to have problems sleeping in his room because of ""the man that walks at night."" He also had a repeated issue with climbing on the counter of the half bath downstairs and smearing hand soap on the mirror. He said that we had to cover the mirror so the girl that lived in there couldn't get out. He still doesn't use the downstairs bathroom unless he has to and he'll leave the door open(it's not visible from any other room except the laundry room.)"
Ghosts,3dphjz,velvert,3,Sat Jul 18 09:58:13 2015 UTC,I'd be outta there :o but my old house used to lock it's own doors (it was like the push-lock most houses have) and we always had to pick the locks with toothpicks because they locked themselves. We knew the house was hauntes because lots of things happened there.
Ghosts,3dphjz,Grayson754,3,Sat Jul 18 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"I don't usually get a bad feeling in the house, but that's usually because there are other people there. I don't like being there alone."

I will mention that if you're open minded to the idea of a ghost, you should also consider that it may be a different type of spirit, like a brownie. Do some research, you might find it interesting.  They are known to be mischievous but also helpful. However be very careful not to insult them."

Ghosts,3dfta7,RebelRaider5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:03:56 2015 UTC,Skim through this: http://www.yourghoststories.com/ghost-stories-categories.php?category=19&page=1  You can also create an account on Your Ghost Stories and post the same thing you did here. People on there always give great advice.   That said from my experince not all shadow people are shadow people. IMHO some shadow people are just ghosts that don't have the strength/will/want to show themselves clearly.   That said there some defenses YOU can do if your still religious. Crosses blessed by a priest work [I always wear a small silver one on my neck with my dog tags]. Also what I prefer for and would recommed in this case is a Saint Benedict Medal.  The St Benedict medal is inscribed with a powerful exorcism prayer on it. This medal offers strong protections against demonic and negative spirits.  http://theghosthunterstore.com/shop/st-benedict-oxidized-silver-medal/ [Just remember to have it Blessed]  Also burning sage is old method that clears negative/bad spirits. Just be calm and do it with some motivation. Don't light it and walk around like scared.   Let me know if you have any other questions.   Also DONT GHOST HUNT IN YOUR OWN HOUSE!!
Ghosts,3dfta7,RebelRaider5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, also you can the St. Michael prayer over and over until you feel better. That helps me a lot.

Ghosts,3dfta7,Alemazile,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:47:20 2015 UTC,"Could this possibly be a psychological issue? I'm not trying to be mean, Ive had my own experiences with the paranormal but I was wondering if maybe she's doing this for attention? Or maybe some kind of paranoia runs in her family. If not then I would say her reasons for not talking about it could be because it's traumatic for her. I still think she should talk to you. You are her husband and she shouldn't have to go through whatever it is alone. On the other side of it though you could argue that she's lying to you by omission and tell her your not here to judge her but that the situation makes you uncomfortable and you need answers. It's not right for her to tell you some but not all and the fact that she doesn't trust you enough to tell you the whole story could be a whole other problem."

Ghosts,3d78yd,Horrors993,34,Tue Jul 14 01:50:12 2015 UTC,"Not paranormal at all. It's a CO2 fire extinguisher caught up with all the other debris. As it flows past, it catches on something and discharges. The hose/nozzle is aimed up and discharges white CO2 smoke. The momentum of the canister takes on on with the debris, causing the smoke to move with it. As the canister tumbles with the flowing debris, the item depressing the trigger dislodges as the canister stops billowing CO2.  The brief cloud follows the airflow updraft, making it look like a specter crawling up the roof. CO2 has a visible depth to its body and vanishes almost immediately, just like we see here."

Ghosts,3d2el7,Christmas_Pirate,3,Mon Jul 13 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"True, but it does make me wonder if it's there at all.  Maybe it has to do with neural pathways and how we perceive sound that indicates whether or not we are receptive to hearing paranormal voices, Idk. It'd make a neat study, I suppose"
Ghosts,3d2el7,GhostCheese,3,Mon Jul 13 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"This sounds too regular, it sounds like an equipment failure like a short, which you don't hear when the much stronger signal of the voice allows better filtering. If it didn't immediately start when the voices stopped and start again when they finished I might think it was something. The bangs are weird, but who really knows what that was. If we had two recordings that got the same thing that would be something."
Ghosts,3czwoy,onesadloser,2,Sun Jul 12 08:18:26 2015 UTC,"I've seen something like that.  When me and my twin were kids, mom was at work and our older sister was sleeping. My twin and I were playing in the living room, we both stopped dead at the same time, turned around and seen a white face with black eyes peeking at us from the hallway. It was an old lady but didn't feel any fear from it."

Ghosts,3czwoy,Fatgreyclouds,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:13:38 2015 UTC,I used to see something like that peeking in my window when I was little. I thought it was an alien.
Ghosts,3czwoy,GhostCheese,2,Sun Jul 12 11:08:28 2015 UTC,you'd have to rule out opossum first.
Ghosts,3czwoy,Fatgreyclouds,0,Mon Jul 13 18:47:38 2015 UTC,I'd love to say it was a possum but this was a pretty huge head. Let's just go with reflection. Definitely not alien.
Ghosts,3d14x3,videojohnc,13,Sun Jul 12 17:34:34 2015 UTC,Is there a window in the bathroom?  I ask because it looks suspiciously like a reflection coming from a window that is out of the photo to either side.  It could also be a reflection coming from the light above the mirror.  When mirrors or panes of glass are involved there are hundreds of effects that reflections can cause without our realizing it.  The anomaly appears to be ON the wall and not just in the room.  Any other information you can give with respect to windows and other glass or reflective surfaces in the room would be appreciated.
Ghosts,3d14x3,Ghyllie,7,Sun Jul 12 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"look at how the sink is lit, theres def. a light source obscured by the door."
Ghosts,3d14x3,GhostCheese,2,Sun Jul 12 20:55:29 2015 UTC,"I was also curious about this being the case. Unfortunately that part of the house was sectioned off and the only way to see into the bathroom was through the mirror you see in the picture. My only thought is the way the house is layed out, this bathroom would not have any windows on the back wall, as I think the back wall connect to the drawing room, as for a window some were else, I am just not sure! Though the sink and toilets were certainly made of a relatively reflective surface. We would have asked, but we didn't notice anything until we had left and were on the bus back to the YMCA."
Ghosts,3d14x3,Ghyllie,4,Sun Jul 12 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"I am one of those people who love to think that every anomaly could be something paranormal, but my reasonable, sensible self takes over after 35+ years of investigating and reminds me that photographic ""glitches"" are the norm and actual paranormal things are extremely rare.  If you look at the spot, however, you can almost make out what COULD be facial features, however pareidolia can cause some amazing coincidences."
Ghosts,3d14x3,ZWQncyBkaWNr,2,Sun Jul 12 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"A little context behind this photo. During the Summer, our local YMCA is taking our younger clients to see some of the Historic sites around Hamilton (Ontario). Hamilton has a fascinating local history dating back before confederation and is considered a ""haunted city"". On our first trip we went to see a famously haunted historic site once owned by the McQuesten family called ""Whitehern"", this is a pretty famously haunted location known by many of Hamilton's residents as all of the McQuesten family members died in the house - usually of natural causes and nothing too suspicious or mysterious - one of the youth was brave enough to ask if the location was haunted, usually museum staff in Hamilton are NOT game to answer this type of question and usually blow it off or get upset when it is asked, however our tour guide was fantastic and shared lots of personal experiences and the experiences of the other staff as well, basically sharing all kinds of ghost stories with us. The picture you see here was taken in the lobby of the house were the patriarch of the family Clive McQuesten died of a heart attack. The photo has not been edited outside of cropping and the red circle I placed around the ghost in question and was taken on my iPhone by one of the youth. What are your thoughts on this interesting picture? This is my first time capturing anything ""ghostly"" in a photo and probably the most convincing evidence I have ever seen that ghosts are indeed real! Also...original photo ----> http://i.imgur.com/jIplUgP.jpg"
Ghosts,3d14x3,hayley_dee,2,Sun Jul 12 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"Did you have flash on? It's possible that your flash reflected off of something, but this looks remarkably like a mustachioed face hunched at the sink."
Ghosts,3cx72j,PeteJones6969,8,Sat Jul 11 15:57:20 2015 UTC,"If there were a way of seeking out a ghost, the tv networks would have found proof years ago.  It's like hoping a collosal squid makes it to the surface so you can take a pic."

Ghosts,3cx72j,Doc_Bong,5,Sat Jul 11 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"In my experience, you can't seek out an experience like this. I, myself, seem to have the experiences come to me when I'm just doing random stuff, like laundry, cooking, bathroom, etc. My house is old and there are documented instances where people have died on my property (two of natural causes, one accident). I think the paranormal is a realm where you have to be reached out to, not reaching into. I don't talk to the spirits in my house, they just kinda let me know they're there. Maybe try spending time in a location where spiritual energy is common and just wait. Don't seek to see something but be open if something shows itself to you. Good luck!"
Ghosts,3cx72j,ertdgaf,3,Sat Jul 11 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"These Haunted places you've been to, How many times have you been to the same spot, and what time? Just going somewhere once during the day your probably not likely to experince anything.   That said browse to web for places around you that have real ghost walks, places that let the public come in and investigate along side ghost hunting teams, or even join a ghost hunting/paranormal research team."
Ghosts,3cx72j,RebelRaider5,3,Sat Jul 11 17:29:53 2015 UTC,It is these strong feelings that can keep a ghost away.  Just relax.  As someone who has seen a ghost (with another person seeing it too) I can tell you they are real and they are out there.  Just relax.
Ghosts,3cx72j,idonthaveacoolname13,2,Sun Jul 12 05:00:48 2015 UTC,"Actually SEEING a ghost is like.... the mother load.  We all want it, few get it (and even less have any sort of proof.  Which 'proof' to them can be thrown out by us that weren't there to witness thanks to the age of technology we are in).    My most convincing evidence has always come from a tape recorder.  When you are 1 of 2 people sitting completely still in a room, and you go back to hear the recording and you hear footsteps up a staircase (where the recorder had been sitting), or a voice you know doesn't belong to either of you it is really exciting.  Its hard for skeptics to hear the recording though and not think it was faked.  And I don't blame them because if evidence is put in front of me and I wasn't there to witness the conditions I am extremely skeptical of it.    One thing I suggest is doing a true investigation.  Not one of these 'pay $20 and go on a tour with 20 other people'.  The less people the better.  Sounds are the main things we catch.  Of course you should always investigate a sounds, but sometimes it can be obvious."

Ghosts,3cx72j,fr4gge,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"Sometime when you're alone,  use the voice recorder on your phone to try and catch an EVP. In my opinion, nothing is better at affirming a belief in the paranormal than knowing you're alone and hearing someone answer your questions. I've caught a few things doing impromptu EVP sessions."
Ghosts,3cx72j,mpellas,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, but even if you did have an experience you couldn't explain, how do you go about ruling out hallucination? A primed mind seems overly ready to interpret stimuli to fit prior expectations."
Ghosts,3cx72j,GhostCheese,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:32:18 2015 UTC,"You need to open yourself up more. You've got to let your guard down and open your mind to the possibility that there is much more to this world than what meets the eye. Now I'm not sure how to explain this concept in a way that will do it justice, but there's a reason children have more paranormal experiences than adults.  It's almost like as people get older they no longer see paranormal things, or they just dismiss any paranormal activity immediately and write it off as whatever we can convince ourselves is a logical enough explanation."
Ghosts,3cx72j,ItBoilsDownToDope,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:31:40 2015 UTC,I'd say you need to stay in a place that's known to be haunted overnight or even for a couple of days.  Stuff usually happens in the middle of the night.  If you're that interested in this you could even reserve a room at the Stanley hotel.
Ghosts,3cx72j,ZeroPintEnergy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:20:32 2015 UTC,"I've been pretty lucky communicating with spirits but I know all of them, family and friends that have passed over. They seem to come alive after 3am if I ask for a sign. But once in the 90's I saw a 'ghost' walk (glide) out of a hospital emergency room. The hair on the back of your neck really does stand out! It was around 4am and I stepped on the gas to get a closer look at it and when I did that, the guy I was with totally freaked out! He looked terrified! haha The ghost appeared to be man. His body was clear. He walked out of the emergency exit and turned right but there was nothing on that side of the hospital but a fence, dirt and a riverbed. You know what it is as soon as you see it! You might want to start with the ones you know."

Ghosts,3cx72j,thedigi321,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:03:58 2015 UTC,"""Seeing"" a ghost is incredibly rare. And if you do, there is a strong chance it's a residual haunt. That's why I rely on EVP sessions and other means to look for ghosts."
Ghosts,3cm32i,Threpplewang,16,Wed Jul 8 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"I grew-up living next door to a middle-aged Chinese woman who befriended my mother.  My mother would regularly send me next door with freshly baked cookies or to deliver messages to her and she was always friendly and happy to chat.  One year our neighbor returned from China with an elderly friend who we occasionally saw looking out of her upstairs window. I recall seeing this man a few times standing at the top of the staircase when I visited to deliver messages to the woman. I also recall talking to the woman in her kitchen while hearing her elderly friend play billiards upstairs.  It wasn't until I was much older that my mother mentioned that the neighbor lived alone and what I witnessed was a ghost that my neighbor brought back from China and couldn't get ride of. My mother had seen him too.  It really creeps me out to think about it.  Anyhoo, it's not a TV documentary but it convinced me."
Ghosts,3cm32i,mobilebeta,7,Thu Jul 9 01:25:37 2015 UTC,This is truly creepy. Anymore info or stories on it? How'd it follow her back? Was it friendly?
Ghosts,3cm32i,amtheref,8,Thu Jul 9 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"I don't really know. My mother died years ago and it's one of those things that was a little unsettling and never talked about. The Chinese woman didn't have any pets, however I distinctly recall hearing the repeated crack of billiard balls from the upstairs pool table on several occasions while visiting the woman.  I definitely saw the ghost a few times - the staircase was visible from the front door of the Chinese woman's house and I'd often see him looking down from the top of the stairs when I visited her. At the time I just thought her friend was curious about who was at the door... and I guess that's still accurate.  I've never even discussed it with my sister... I probably should because she may actually know something...  I've had one other shared experience that isn't worth mentioning, however I just wanted to express that in both cases neither myself nor my girlfriend ever discussed the event or what we witnessed after it happened. Perhaps that's an indication that some stories are true... if people don't freely discuss them because they were truly unsettled by the event?"
Ghosts,3cm32i,mobilebeta,6,Thu Jul 9 02:11:26 2015 UTC,Well thank you for sharing. Something about it has me very intrigued.
Ghosts,3cm32i,amtheref,2,Thu Jul 9 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"Just over 20 years ago, my friends/flatmates from uni got a ground floor flat in Belfast over summer - my family home was there, so I stayed at that. They all said about the strange noises they had heard from the empty flat upstairs. It was well known, they spoke of it quite openly. I stayed one night, sleeping in the living room and was woke by what sounded like trolleys being pushed about upstairs, with some force. Really weird thinking back.  Tbh It could have been squatters, of course, but I can't recall if anyone ever seen anybody enter or leave. It really freaked one friend who was staying there."

The intensity of the white line streak you see in the photo would require for the photo to be exposed for around 10-15 seconds in order to create that light line.

Ghosts,3aqc06,Dan_Droid,-2,Sun Jun 28 14:24:40 2015 UTC,Sorry I forgot to leave my story.   Took a ride in an Uber the other night and we got to talking about ghosts. He mentioned to me his friend took the night tour at Alcatraz and took a picture of his daughter and captured some ghosts. When I saw the picture I was creeped out. I see one obvious face and then another sinister face or maybe in pain right over the child's face. What natural causes.could have created this? Spooky either way.
Ghosts,3aqc06,DigitalMystik,-1,Mon Jun 22 18:01:40 2015 UTC,Backstory?
Ghosts,3aj2qg,hayloftgluon,8,Sat Jun 20 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"Do you have a carbon monoxide detector? It's happened before that people were hearing voices or sounds like you describe but in actuality they had carbon monoxide in the home.   Another thing that's happened to me before: I was hearing a radio or music coming from my air conditioner, through the white noise of the machine. (Central AC unit in condos). It scared me so much I thought I was going crazy and was starting to panic until I read online that sometimes people experienced it with certain medications.. I had been taking Tamiflu. Stopped taking it immediately and the music and radio noise was gone."
Ghosts,3aj2qg,Philodendritic,4,Sun Jun 21 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"Upvote for carbon monoxide.  There was just a big discussion on this in another (unrelated) reddit.  People see ghosts, hear voices, etc.  A whole episode of Ghost Hunters deal with someone who couldn't deal with all the ghosts in her house. Found out, she had high levels of carbon monoxide.  These should be mandatory in every home (all new construction has it at least)."
Ghosts,3aj2qg,snowbirdie,5,Sun Jun 21 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"I used to volunteer at a theatre, and on the third floor, we used a mic and speaker so the actors and stage crew could  listen out for cues whole show's took place on the ground floor.   Suddenly, this system started playing music. Regularly. Not music that was associated with shows and not always the same stuff or genre.  We managed to nail down that at least part of the mysterious sound was the circuit, which was closed and didn't have an obvious way to receive, picking up English speaking Thai radio. We have no idea why or how, even the theatre's electrician, who installed it and knew it like the back of his hand had no clue. But it was definitely just radio.  It's possible that sound system in your home are doing something similar - whether it's taxi or emergency service radios, a station or a cordless phone in a neighbouring property. We had guitar amps that would occasionally pick up the sound from the TV downstairs..."

Ghosts,3aj2qg,theotherlaptop,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:12:55 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate a bit?
Ghosts,3aj2qg,snowbirdie,8,Sat Jun 20 22:41:09 2015 UTC,"Use a voice recorder. It will amplify the sounds. For example, I used a recorder in my apartment when it was dead quiet. I listened to the recording and there were people constantly talking! I got very scared. Then I realized it was easily picking up my neighbor's TV show based on what was being said.    Edit: People who downvote common sense are suffering from cognitive dissonance. It's very sad, but education is the key to resolving that Dark Ages mentality."

Ghosts,3afqvw,allTheNuggets,4,Fri Jun 19 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"Do you think it's possible that the energy in a place that allows for paranormal phenomenon gets ""used up""?   Not necessarily. I will tell you that even in an active location, the odds of you having a paranormal experience are extremely slim. The shows that you see on TV make it seem like you'll have activity every single time you enter a ""haunted"" location, but that's simply not true."

Ghosts,3afqvw,s70n3834r,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:40:28 2015 UTC,It seems like these two expect movie stuff to happen just because someone attaches a spooky story to a place.
Ghosts,3afqvw,TheundeadUnicorn,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:30:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that, although it's possible any residual energy fades over time. It might be the environment on any given day, or it might be that a lot of the haunting at places that use it as a tourist attraction are more hype than anything else.  Despite what TV shows suggest, entities aren't performance artists. There's never any guarantee that they'll make themselves known."
Ghosts,3afqvw,rosiedoes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:53:18 2015 UTC,"First off, how cool that ghost hunting is a family outing for you and your sibling :)  My siblings (and mom) are also super interested in the paranormal and I'd love to do this kind of trip w/ my siblings one day.  Re: Myrtles, sorry to hear that. It sounds like you did a sleep over there.  There are so many factors that can impact your stay: the moon (IMHO), the time (were you up at 3am, when things can get active), state of mind, etc. I personally think caffeine can have an effect.  Anyhow, I hope your next visit to a haunted spot is better!"
Ghosts,3afqvw,Dynomite70,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"I've stayed overnight at The Myrtles on three different occasions and visited more times than I can count. I've been fascinated by - and drawn to - the old home since we first went there on a school field trip when I was in grade school. Still, in all that time and my many visits, I've only had one actual paranormal experience there as an adult, and it was on the first overnight stay with my best friend (we both experienced the phenomenon).   I believe the place is most likely haunted, but I think a lot of the phenomenon is just residual and not the result of any actual, active spirits. I feel there is, also, a lot of hype to make it seem the ""action"" is more frequent than it really is. There is no doubt there is something unique about the home and grounds and there is a strange energy that permeates the area, but whether it's a full-blown, full-time haunting as many purport it to be isn't something I can vouch for in my personal experience.  To be honest, I felt the paranormal energy in the house died down after it was sold to the current owners. This is nothing against them. It is just that the previous owners took a lot of the original furnishings and paintings from the home, and - personally - it hasn't felt the same or as ""strong"" since. I was a child when I visited the home with the original furnishings, though, so it may just have been that the entire atmosphere seemed more ""spooky"" to me, too.   Also, there's the history issue... I was sad to learn, as an adult, that a lot of the history that has been reported as being ""responsible"" for the hauntings is, simply, false."

Ghosts,3a9ofc,Bryanv7,3,Fri Jun 19 02:03:04 2015 UTC,I wonder what it takes to not call something a hoax? (looking at other replies)
Ghosts,3a9ofc,houtm035,13,Thu Jun 18 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, this is kind of over-the-top. If an event this extreme really took place, don't you think it would be the talk of the scientific community, instead of just being a video on youtube?   The video would be slightly more believable if the events were a little more subtle.  If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."
Ghosts,3a9ofc,OcmsRazor,3,Thu Jun 18 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, this is kind of over-the-top. If an event this extreme really took place, don't you think it would be the talk of the scientific community, instead of just being a video on youtube?    I mean, it's here and people are still calling bull shit. Do you think that a bunch of super skeptical scientists would feel differently?"
Ghosts,3a9ofc,bongo1138,7,Thu Jun 18 18:46:55 2015 UTC,"People are calling bullshit because it's obviously a hoax. I agree with what others are saying, this is likely from a hidden camera TV show.   If there ever were an attack this extreme, it would exist in more places than just youtube. There is no backstory whatsoever, there are no names mentioned, or anything else to research to look for the story, because there is no story to look for. It's just a youtube video of a hoaxed ghost attack.    bunch of super skeptical scientists   I don't know that skeptical is a good word to describe most scientists. They are in search of the truth, no matter what form it comes in."
Ghosts,3a9ofc,Dan_Droid,2,Thu Jun 18 18:55:43 2015 UTC,Then I think skeptical is precisely the word to use. I'm saying that there can never be a ghost video that people will take seriously because it's so easy to stage. Never.
Ghosts,3a9ofc,bongo1138,2,Thu Jun 18 19:27:54 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that there can never be a ghost video that people will take seriously because it's so easy to stage. Never.   I absolutely agree. In today's world of audio/photo/video editing software, it is impossible to say with 100% certainty that any video in existence is legitimate."
Ghosts,3a9ofc,Dan_Droid,3,Thu Jun 18 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. Yes, it's easy to create hoax videos and people are doing it on a daily basis. BUT... if this were real the people involved would be out there telling their story all over the place. Then it would be easy to find out if the people knew each other or were completely unrelated. You could find out who took the video and who posted it, and be able to show that way that it wasn't a hoax.  It's the lack of backstory that makes this an obvious hoax. I empathize with those who feel that no evidence will ever be enough, but really it's about the whole story (if it exists) and how it all holds together.  So yes, a video can be evidence, but there needs to be much more than a video, including interviews with all who were involved and a basic check of their background to rule out hoaxing.  You don't get any of that with the videos typically  posted here, because they are hoaxes."
Ghosts,3a9ofc,shen-han,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:45:16 2015 UTC,BUT... if this were real the people involved would be out there telling their story all over the place.   thats a logical fallacy.

So many of these stories start with ""i woke up and there it was"" or ""i was just about to fall asleep when..."" which leads me to believe it was only a figment of your imagination and you were actually still sleeping, or had just fallen asleep not realizing it.

Ghosts,39wlj8,Jack_Shid,5,Mon Jun 15 12:36:24 2015 UTC,Thankyou for the reply. The reason I want to do this is there is some creepy shit going on in my house like doors opening and closing by themselves and footsteps at night when no one is awake.
Ghosts,39wlj8,RolainTheVariable,12,Mon Jun 15 12:23:56 2015 UTC,I think a camera and/or an audio recorder would be better tools to find out what's going on in your home.

The ufo community is behaving similar in that aspect. People get tortured, have no answer for years, one guy finds the answer burried in their own reports, and they stick their nose in the air.

If you were a spirit of a person who died 100 years ago would you know how to make a smartphone app produce words? Or every someone recently dead. The logic behind them are baseless. Apps you could use would be one for audio recording to try to capture reps. I have one I've used as a vibration sensor (smart tools sound tool). There's a couple books on amazon called low tech ghost hunting that have ideas for using cheap & household items. Personally, my ears & ears are my best tools."

Ghosts,39jhy6,Not_a_Templar,4,Fri Jun 12 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, A non religious View of Ghosts:  You heard of Psionics? It isnt Psychic. Both exist, but seperately. Ghosts are psionic constructs. Our brains are famed for running on energy. According to psychic theory, Psychic is transdimensional and controls psionics and energy. Then Psionics Power The body, and the body moves Objects using specialized cells. When the body dies, If the soul wich is psychic and psionic hybrid construct has enough willpower it will theoretically Formate as a ""Ghost"". A Ghost is merely the psionic form of a person. Unstable in comparison due to no anchor, they can manipulate objects if they are strong enough. But rarely are they strong enough.  Sorry for the length, im just listing what ive researched. If its unreadable im sorry."

I was thinking that ghosts, at least in the ""kinda visible apparition"" sense, are remnants of light that have somehow ""jumped"" across space and time.    Example given: you repeatedly see a ghostly apparition in the same room of an old house.  Maybe what you are actually seeing is a bit of the light reflected from when that person was actually there - it just... got trapped.  Or lost.  Maybe both.    Remember: I was high."

HOWEVER, what is odd is that the other shadows in the photo are to the RIGHT of the seated girl and in front of the standing person (on the left hand side of the photo).  The shadows on the wall a foot or two away from the people, while they are clearly there and doubtlessly shadows, they are not terribly dark.  There are no other shadows back on the trees, and the shadow that appears to be from the seated girl is TOTALLY black, you cannot see any parts of the trees at ALL that are in the shadow.  That is extremely unusual.  Even if it's a dark shadow, you would still see the leaves and branches of the tree.  It's kind of spooky, to be truthful, even though it is, in all likelihood, not paranormal."

Ghosts,394g6f,blitzballer,-1,Tue Jun 9 04:46:32 2015 UTC,"info;  The background on the story of Robert A. Ferguson is this: Robert A. Ferguson was attending a spiritualist convention in Los Angeles, California, back in 1968. One of the attendees decided that they would take a photograph of him. And when he looked at the photograph afterward, he got a big surprise. There was an image in the photograph that was familiar to him. It was his brother. There's only one problem: Robert A. Ferguson's brother had passed away, during World War II. Because Robert A. Ferguson was interested in Spiritualists in general, it may be that he was a sensitive -- his brother may have been as well. Many ghosts decide, because of their interests and because of their affection for those of us who are still living, to come back and see us through some of our toughest times.  It may be that this is what happened in the case of Robert A. Ferguson. Some people might question the authenticity of the photograph taken at that Spiritualist convention, but it was a Polaroid. There is no way any kind of Photoshopping could have been done to that picture. We're thankful that through this photo we can get a better picture of life after death.  http://www.panicd.com/encyclopedia/the-ghost-of-robert-a.-ferguson.html"

I list it in my equipment page too.   Here's the thing. It's loud. It's EXTREMELY annoying. You can't capture EVPs while it's on.  It will have very minor pitch variances but there's no way to equate it to the paranormal. I let it run for several hours while investigating before and it just was never anything definitive.

At first I was pretty surprised and sided with you but I watched the video a thousand times and have gathered that it's a cat. When you have overexposed lighting in the foreground and extremely dark exposure and contrast in the background the camera makes things look different than they really are. In addition to the lighting as mentioned above, your camera has poor performance in low-lighting environments, which explains the grain and noise. I have this problem with my DSLR.  I'm sure someone here can try to clean up the image in Photoshop for you. I'm away from my computer and can't do so immediately.

Ghosts,38xm1i,quinterojoshua,3,Sun Jun 7 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"The last one sounds like sleep paralysis, which happens when your REM (Rapid Eye Movement) state is interrupted and you're kind of between sleep and reality. So in your head you still see the world around you as a dream, your body doesn't move because well, when you're dreaming/sleeping deeply that's what the body does, but your eyes suddenly opened, so you can see but can't do much else. I had this problem a lot and started looking for answers online. Usually people will feel a pressure on their chest and sense something evil is around them, in my case I felt like somebody was trying to choke me and there was an ominous presence in my room, I tried to scream or move but nothing happened. They advise you to start moving the tips of your fingers first. The scratches could well be from you trying to move or something similar.  About the voice, could be an auditory hallucination due to exhaustion/stress or a hypnagogic hallucination. It depends on the context: if you wake up to that voice or were just falling asleep it's a hypnagogic hallucination. If you were exhausted/stressed and/or going to bed it's just a hallucination caused by being extremely tired/stressed.  I've experienced both, the first one I heard my mom's voice when sleeping home alone at night, the latter when I  was a week in Bulgaria sleeping 4h per night and 1h on the last night and had to be at the airport at 6AM. I was so exhausted that I went to the toilet before dinner and thought I was in Barcelona, I managed to sleep 30min and when I woke up to go to the toilet the light was on and I was so paranoid I woke up my friend to go with me because I thought there was someone there and heard a voice. I get really paranoid when I'm sleep deprived (and with a lot of alcohol in my system) and that could be what has happened to you in that situation.  Hope this helped. As for your mother's experience, it could be the same thing: exhaustion. Your body does weird things when it needs rest asap, it's a way of warning you to get some sleep."

Ghosts,38sn0p,getaway-get_away,3,Sat Jun 6 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"I am also of the mind that you shouldn't do anything other than EVP/Ghost Box, or of of those EM field detectors that lights up.  Talk out loud, do not try to ""divine"" anything.  The EM Field detector can be used interactively, but I have never heard of anyone having Ouija board type problems after asking yes no questions (one blink yes, two blinks no).  The ghostbox/evp playback can let you listen for actual conversation, but its things that are already being said. Again, never heard of anyone getting an evil spirit attached to them for using EVP (except the movie White Noise...)  Using tools for spelling out responses or getting an entity to move objects seems to be the surefire way to escalate an encounter in a bad way.  These are what I consider ""divining"" the spirits which opens up a portal or door which lets other spirits through to play.  I'd like to hear from anybody else on this sub whether electronic instruments have lead to Ouija type attachments and escalations or not."

Ghosts,38qo4i,musicman1323,2,Sat Jun 6 00:18:45 2015 UTC,Ghosts are drawn to places with lots of energy. This is quite interesting because I've not heard of ghosts in a new building before unless the land in the general vicinity had some tragic history to it. Do you have an approximate location?
Ghosts,38qo4i,ghoster2k,2,Sat Jun 6 03:56:50 2015 UTC,"The city is Barstow, California.  The college was built in 1963 so the property is old but there wasn't anything directly on the spot this building is as far as I know."

Ghosts,38qo4i,TenYearsLovin,2,Thu Jun 11 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"Because it's a new theater and the possible spirit is heard humming (maybe engaging in theatrics?), my best guess would be that he/she is somewhat moving along with modern times. I think this is important to note because it excludes the possibility of a residual haunting stemming from the land in which the theater sits (unless there was a previous theater in/near it's place) and also denotes positive energy. I would make a bet that the spirit had a positive connection to the immediate area and/or college while living.   From my experience, ghostly shadows are different than shadow people (spirits). Forgive me if I've now taken you to a very weird place. Some spirits will only appear as a dashing shadow here and there because they want to avoid causing fear as well as depleting an energy source. This seems more likely in your case, in my opinion."
Ghosts,38qo4i,TenYearsLovin,2,Sat Jun 6 05:07:19 2015 UTC,"The school did have an interim theatre that sits about halfway across our small campus.

Ghosts,38qo4i,s70n3834r,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"The renovations may have chased the spirit out of the old theater & naturally he/she went to the nearest place of comfort. This travel by the spirit would also suggest it is not residual, but rather a spirit clinging to hopes & dreams - like the case of Olive Thomas, the spirit occupying the New Amsterdam Theater & credited as the most active ghost on Broadway.   Playbill.com has pages of documented theater haunting's here: http://www.playbill.com/news/article/scandals-and-secrets-of-the-supernatural-the-stories-behind-broadways-haunted-theatres-334137/P2   The articles have some great tips on reducing theater haunting's & provide a bit of understanding into the mindset of hopeful, die-hard artists."

They/we are energy beings, so it would seem the way to go is that they are somehow being ""conducted"" in that location.

At the end of that video, it's stated that they faked it and they laughed about it. Here's the full video if you want to watch it.  I was done listening after he said that it's possible a demon controlled his daughters response when she first admitted to playing it and then retracted that statement. No, it wasn't a demon, it was a kid that told the truth, saw her dad's reaction to it, and then quickly changed her tune because she didn't want to get into trouble."

The screen from the phone is in the foreground, and is what you see ""lifting off"".  There is a straight line on the bottom of the phone, and you can see two circles on either side of the line.  You can see about 3/4 of the phone's screen in front of it--it's got a black background, so it doesn't really glow, but that's definitely a touchscreen.  Just above the right yellow dot on the bottom,  the screen begins to black out, and the blacked out area sort of slants up and across the top right of the screen.  That's the thumb of the person holding the phone.  They're holding it in their right hand."

Ghosts,37oi0d,herbw,2,Fri May 29 23:30:23 2015 UTC,"Back in the 1970's when my Parents and 2 brothers and I still lived in University Park in Dallas, TX, our pets were mostly cats. We had a Siamese cat named ""Fancy"", and believe me the name fit. We had her for several years and she liked to sleep on our beds at night. She picked up a habit of climbing up a tree onto the garden wall. She would then walk up to the tile roof and jump up on the window ledge and wait there until someone saw her and went to open the window to let her in, especially while we watched TV in the upstairs ""Living Room"". One day as my parents and I were driving off to somewhere with the 2 brothers, I happened to glance out the rear window and saw Fancy go down into one of the street drains. It was a cold and snowy day. When we returned to the house later that evening, we waited for Fancy to return. We never saw her again. I think she got killed somewhere down under the streets. A few days later while I was watching TV in the aforementioned upstairs living room, I sensed something at the window that Fancy used to come in through. I looked but there was nothing there. This happened several more times for several more days. I never saw her but I kept sensing her presence. It got so strong that finally as the presence of Fancy once came to the outside of the window, I opened it and said, ""Okay, I hear ya. Come on in."" I was immediately enveloped with a feeling of peace and joy. The incident never happened again, so I felt that Fancy finally did come home. Once she did, she went on into the Light."

Ghosts,379cqb,bleepblopbloop,2,Tue May 26 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"What if the reason we bury our dead is because we can sense people in the afterlife, so we put them in the ground so we can't sense them?   I mean, maybe, but we probably started burying the dead because we switched from a hunter/gatherer society that traveled around to an Agricultural society that stayed in one place, and dead bodies leave disease and generally smell bad.  That's probably why they buried them.   What if the reason we respect our dead, is because they are still with us and they'll get pissed if we don't care about them anymore?   I mean, maybe, but we respect the dead because of who they were in life, and because we ourselves want our remains to be respected when we die.   What if the reason you shouldn't kill yourself is because your soul will be stuck in that place, hence why people who hang themselves are sometimes photographed still in the tree/rafters after they have been buried and decomposed?   Wat.  Where have you ever read or seen people in trees and rafters after they've died?  The reason we shouldn't kill ourselves is twofold, the moral and the evolutionary. Morally, life is precious and people care about us.  It's incredibly selfish to remove ourselves from the equation to only transfer our pain to other people. Evolutionarily, we don't kill ourselves because survival is built into us.   What if the reason we put flowers on our dead is because the stalk acts as a pathway for the soul and the flower blossum releases the soul to the other side?   I mean, maybe, but what the fuck do flowers do when they die?  Sociologists have traced giving flowers back to the Ancient Babylonians who would put flowers on graves to symbolize the changing of the seasons.   it's fairly old and there is quite a history of shitty things happening there.   Correlation does not equal causation."

Ghosts,36iggw,gus2155,9,Wed May 20 13:25:47 2015 UTC,"A little background. We just returned home to our house in GA. It is also a small local church with a small congregation that has been meeting there while we have been gone. It has always been haunted. You can just feel it, hear it, doors won't open, lights will go funny, etc. We have been gone, and the people watching it had vacated and it was in a level of disrepair that had me really unhappy. Two people from the folks from the church were there. A tall skinny man and his wife, who is very heavy set with long hair.  I took this establishing shot because my wife and I were considering selling it. I then thought I had caught a weird energy ribbon  on the porch. I freaked out because I thought it was an apparition. Then I realized it looked just like the man who was over, and I decided to prank  my wife and show her the ""ghost"" I found in this picture. She freaked out just like I did. I then told her it was just our friend and she laughed and commented that it looked so creepy we should a how it to the guy himself and tell him it was a ghost, only to reveal it is actually himself. It would be hilarious! So we did it. Only he sobered us up in return. This was actually looking in the same 2 hours, mind you. He said: ""My hat's red, man. And that arm of mine is covered in tattoos"" He pointed to his Nascar hat (the hat in the picture looks brown), and pulled his sleeve up to reveal a wizard tattoo. Then my wife notices the second figure crouched down in front of the lowest red circle on the wall, seeming to be sitting. But there is nothing but a shelf there, and then we noticed where the man pointing toward the door is standing was nothing but building supplies and junk.   So, there it is. I don't know, but I know those weren't people that were here. My wife says that they look like Kenny Paradise (the tall skinny guy) and Doc Thompson (the sitting guy that looks like he is wearing glasses and blue scrubs) they both used to live here, and she says she has met them both before they died."

OP: ""That is not dust...""  Ok, others mention it could be a bug, but that the dog did not react to it.  OP: ""What?? I think she completely reacted""  People are rarely looking to have their experiences debunked and are more likely looking for validation for what they feel is real.

Upon research of the property, the building had been remodeled after a fire, and the new staircase was set several inches higher than the previous one - so they determined the ghosts must have been walking down the old staircase.

Ghosts,35s6lu,maldee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:30:26 2015 UTC,By hologram did he mean technological or paranormal?  Based on the video and comments I am confused.   Also the light flickering seems to be a wiring issue or interference of some sort and not simply a matter of flicking a light switch. Unless they have a dial switch that would be hard to tamper with I think. I am not an electrician though.

Ghosts,35dxt0,dantechazy,8,Sat May 9 11:49:46 2015 UTC,"The door closing on it's own makes me think the house is having foundation problems.  If the door is suddenly incredibly hard to close, that probably means the door hinge is no longer aligned properly.  A foundation that's shifting or splitting apart can cause that.  edit: and here come the downvotes because apparently ghosts are more real than foundation problems"
Ghosts,35dxt0,alsorobots,3,Sat May 9 19:14:39 2015 UTC,That or this is a hoax to sell the house. Something about this video seems like a hoax. For example that EVP sounds almost identical to the home owner and it's clear as day.
Ghosts,35dxt0,Zamora91,2,Sat May 9 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"I agree.  A camera tech would have to be pretty unprofessional to interrupt the interview to point out a ""scratch"" that isn't even visible on camera.  Also, almost everything they said were paranormal could all be caused by a bad split in the foundation.  Small insects could easily get through a small split, as well as the drywall cracking could easily cause drywall dust to get kicked up, thus the spooky ""orbs"", which looked a hell of a lot like small flies.  I'd guess the real estate agent called the tv station which sent out their best and brightest reporter, a ""journalist"" that arrived and without even questioning the evidence, declared that the house is in fact: haunted.  Good for her.  She just broke the biggest news story in the history of mankind.  There is proof of life after death and this is it.  Geez, local news, couldn't you have busted a dirty restaurant or done a story about a memorial that needs repairs?  You had to talk to the lady who thinks her house was part of the local chainsaw massacre."

That way I can tell what the family needs to hear and I can tell them how much time I will need alone to clean the local.  Things I need to know, please answer them the most truthfuly as possible.  Location of the house: I need to know the Country, State and City and part of the city you live in. I need that to know the influences that may be near your house. Full address would be perfect but people online don't like to share that information. Feel free to not tell me so, but I need to get a general idea if there are hospitals, morgues, cemeteries, crematories and so on near your house.  Religious: I need to know if you or anyone related to you performed any religious acts inside the house. Praying before sleeping and eating counts. You don't have to be precise but ""the woman that cleans my house usually sings christian melodies while working"" is an information I need.  Pets: do you have any pets? Do you have children?  Eletronics: do you have microwave? Tube television? I need a pic of them or the position of them explained in the floor plant.  Your religion: are you religious? What religion? What religious things you do inside your house?  Deads: I need to know if you have buried any deceased person or pet in your house or lawn.  Medical conditions: I need to know if you have trouble sleeping, is on anti depression medication, was diagnosed with clinical depression, uses drugs, drinks alcohol, or use any kind of prescribed medication.

Ghosts,353nh2,christoff94,1 point,Fri May 8 02:44:49 2015 UTC,"Tests I need you to perform, because I probably can't reach your home worldwide.  1 - You will need a candle and black pepper. You may need to practice this before doing the test. You will set fire to the candle and will sprinkle the pepper in the fire. After that, you will watch the fire. You will walk the house with the candle and the pepper, sprinkling it. Do that with all lights on the house lit and with all windows closed. Walk slowly. You have to watch to where the fire bends, if it bends. If you walk near the closet and the fire bends in it's direction, don't go. Just take a picture and post it here. Don't worry, 99% of chance of nothing appearing on the pic, I need to see where the spirit may be. Dark spirits seek and suck light and fire. If that happens, we know the type of energy the spirit needs to be there.  2 - You will need incense for this. Choose one that you like the smell. I need you to burn it and walk with it burning through the house. Look at the smoke. With windows closed and the incense away from your breathing the smoke should be straight up or shaking rapidly. I need you to write me what happens to the smoke in each room of the house.  After those are tests are done, please, take NEW pictures of the same locations you've taken before and post them here. We can proceed after those are done. I will be waiting for your reply."

But, the fact that she knows your name implies that she may not be a human spirit. Most of the time humans cannot manifest as an intelligent entity. You could use a Ouija board if you want to commune with the spirits(granted you play it the right way) or send clergy in. You could also try cleansing rituals from various religions to see which the spirit responds to the most(in predominantly white countries, Christianity seems to be the most effective) or just move. Try all the ghost hunter type shit(evp, thermal, etc) and try to capture it on film. Keep a crucifix as well. Also, try to summon the man again, if he is your protection then you need him. That's the only thing i can think of to combat malign spirits."

No way I missed it earlier, it was on the very centre of a perfectly clean floor, with nothing around it for a 10 inch radius.

During the middle of the movie we paused to take shots and for me to have a smoke outside.  When we did, we heard something that heard like screaming coming from our unused bedroom.  We have some stuff stored in there like my uniforms and boxes.  I went to check it out with the light from my iphone.  Apparently, my little mini drone I had bought from several months ago had one of its wings turning on.  It was in a plastic bag so the sound it was making sounded like screaming.  The weird thing was the controller was turned off...as was the drone.  There's two batteries in the plastic bag so we think maybe they caused a reaction to it, but the damn thing has been in the same place for the past 2 months since we last played with it and we haven't moved it since.  And it was too much of a coincidence.  My wife said it might have been some ""good"" spirits playing a prank on us since we were really getting into the movie.  It really freaked her out though at first, to the point she was in tears.  Wish I had recorded the whole event on my phone."

There's a possibility there are spirits there but what you list doesn't sound exactly profound. Best thing to do if you feel such granted I know well at my old unis that it was against rules. Just light some sage real quick and smudge your room. 4 minutes max so nothing goes off. It'll throw off any spiritual energy, or personally I'd place quartz in each corner of the room.

Last time you were out of your room, someone came in, grabbed your cards from the place you always keep them, and put them on top of your door frame. Then the next time you opened your door, they fell down on top of you spooking you, which I'm sure was the intended prank.  None of this sounds paranormal to me either, just a lot of noisy people who like pranks.   Why didn't you take a picture of the strawberry milk? And why/how would a ghost put weird labels on a drink in a vending machine that anyone can buy things from?  I went to college too and messing with the RA (especially if he/she believes in ghosts) is like a national pastime."

Ghosts,34vb42,TheStarBeast,3,Tue May 5 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"From what I've read/seen, it can go either way. Some people who are haunted by children do interact with them and leave them toys and stuff to appease them or make them feel less lonely. Other people have unfortunately dealt with entities in their house that posed as lonely children and later turned out to be much darker. Caution is probably the best option to take."

Clayton was the gentleman killed in WWII. His name is on the town War memorial, and I have his obituary, and pictures from the University of Maine yearbook. Most of the photos here were added by me. I can't quite remember the name of the gentleman who died at the house. I'm at work and all that information is at home.   We never did any investigations in the house as we didn't think that was a real good idea while we were living there. I didn't want to piss anyone off or stir anything up.

That's awesome about the piano though, I'm guessing your request was respected? Poor ghost probably wanted to dance. I can understand not wanting to actively do an investigation, but did you ever capture anything inadvertently, in photos or recordings?"
Ghosts,34vb42,Wendyland78,1 point,Tue May 5 18:38:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, I wish I had captured something. I had to eventually get up and leave a few times from playing the piano because the feeling of someone looming behind me was so overwhelming it became impossible to ignore. I'm in New Mexico now for work and I miss New England a LOT."
Ghosts,34vb42,BurningCharcoal,3,Tue May 5 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! What a great old place you have. Poo Poo on the Dead Files, bet they would have founds some neat info on that place."
Ghosts,34vb42,BurningCharcoal,2,Fri Jun 5 00:04:20 2015 UTC,I've read other accounts of people seeing only partial pieces of ghosts.  I think I would be more freaked out to see just a face or another part of an apparition.  It seems like they were just messing with you with the earth worms.  sounds like something I would do if I was a ghost.
Ghosts,34vb42,JTreguboff,1 point,Fri May 8 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"Well, the place the gentleman roams, on the fields as you said, was it recently dug up? If not, I recommend you try digging that place. It might be something. I'm just trying to connect the events."

But until as a community we start criticizing these pics and saying what could it actually be we will never be taken seriously.

Ghosts,34tcdl,Kats_Lion,5,Mon May 4 19:18:38 2015 UTC,I dunno. This particular community seems pretty criticizing of most photographs presented.

That could easily be our minds trying to find faces in our surroundings. Now I am not saying it's not a ghost. Just that it's to hard to believe in 100%.  Am I making sense?
Ghosts,34tcdl,Kats_Lion,1 point,Mon May 4 21:25:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, you are! I'm with you. Some of those photos seem like a stretch."
Ghosts,34tcdl,BadWolfBella,1 point,Tue May 5 01:43:32 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if you're going to document ghosts, do it right.  Stop vaguely wandering around a house pointing cameras around and reacting to every little noise.  START by copying the floor plan of the house and making a grid, doing your best to sketch in anything that might be of importance, like electrical outlets, lamps, electronic devices, furniture, sinks, toilets, baths and showers, anything the owners might be able to tell you about where the pipes are located.  This whole process may take as long as several weeks to properly draw up and investigate.  Note any outside factors like wells, buried wires, streetlamps, light sources, trees, etc.  Then, the investigation moves to stage two where you plan a walkthrough of the house, covering every room, every square of the grid you've drawn.  Draw a path on the map if it helps but you need to cover the entire inside and outside of the house.    When going through the house, note noises the doors make when you open them both slowly and quickly.  Check to see if they shut properly, note any problems with the door mounts.  Take temperature readings in every single square of the grid and note the time.  Just a reminder, you need to keep an eye on where vents are located and note the temperature the thermostat is set at.  You'll need the following equipment:  Laser thermometer Audio decibel meter Electronic barometer Electromagnetic meter (not a stupid detector with blinking led lights!, you need a readout with accurate levels) Multimeter Geigercounter if possible Camera HIGH quality audio recorder with external shotgun microphone and omni-directional microphone. High quality camcorder X 3 or more I'd also recommend bringing a spool of thin red sewing string, two towells, a few feathers (you can buy these in a craft store I believe) a small ball, as smooth as possible, a carpenter level, tape measure (or laser measure if you can afford it).  Any other equipment would be helpful.  All measurements are useful to scientists.  Before ever talking to the family (and please warn them when you first talk to them not to divulge anything about the ""haunting"") remind the family that you'll be hearing their stories after the first investigation.  Here's investigation one:  take measurements from every single square of the house on your grid, three different times a day.  Do this three separate days.  Interview the family and have them do a walkthrough, note any disturbances they report on a transparency over your floorplan but do not let them see your map.  Spend two days analyzing any possible correlation between data on your map and the notes on the transparency.    Repeat the investigation with what you know, being careful to take measurements more carefully and more extensively using your ""hot spots"" on your map.  Make copies of everything, of course.  Go over any possible causes for the various things the family told you about.  Anything that didn't line up with data you took from the investigations.  Call it plausible.    Shake their hands, leave.  Do not play them anything from the audio recordings or video recordings.  There's no point.  Machines fail and a failure in an audio sensor or a camera sensor on a microchip or a change in air pressure or a pet walking by does not need to be given to the family unless they request it.  Leave a copy of your investigation with the family and their lawyer.  Make sure to have some serious legal papers drawn up because if Gramma takes a dive off the stairs, you messing with the scary ghosts could net you in trouble with a sleazy enough lawyer.  Make sure the family signs these otherwise if someone breaks into their house in the future, they might be able to blame you mapping everything in their home.  Reminder: If your research gets stolen, you could still be screwed legally so ghost-hunt only if you are really sure you can handle the load of responsibility."

I used to get these sometimes. I also used to wake up and see things, but it's just your brain playing tricks on you, I once saw chucky the doll standing next kt my bed.  I just so happened to be terrified of him at the time. In effect if you really believe or are terrified of something, your brain can make it ""real"".  And if you have a tendency to see things in that twilight place in between wakefulness and sleep your brain might make you see something.   Disclaimer: I have not really studied this much, just talking from my own experiences."
Ghosts,34jq4k,TunkaTun,1 point,Fri May 1 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"this sounds like sleep paralysis. waking up unable to move with an overbearing sense of fear or panic, people often see a shadowy figure in the room or sitting on top of them.

Ghosts,34jq4k,tylerdurden08,1 point,Sat May 2 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"This is a classic case of sleep paralysis. I used to have episodes of that all the time. Most of them are creepy as shit.   They almost always occur when one prone to sleep paralysis falls asleep lying flat on their back, facing the ceiling. Essentially you are awake, cannot move, and hallucinate terrors or 'dark beings' Your brain has released chemicals to keep you still during sleep and chemicals which produce dreaming but you have yet to fully fall asleep.  Even though there is a scientific explanation for this, its still creepy as shit."

She said if you're going to use a board, you need to have a specific loved one in mind.  That love connection keeps the others away.  I don't know if that's true, but I'd never risk using a oujia board."

I realize a lot of people are quick to point the finger at sleep paralysis but that's really not always the case. We are at our most vulnerable when we sleep and that's why many people get attacked by things at this time."

A couple years ago in my neighborhood there was a middle aged lady who went to my local park, the same park where I now take my son to play.

Ghosts,33qmqo,MiyamotoKnows,6,Fri Apr 24 23:54:24 2015 UTC,"Not only am I a REALTOR, not only am I a paranormal investigator, but I actually have done an investigation in this house. This is the Victorian, of Gardner, MA. It's been investigated by all your major players and it is chock full of entities for you to play with. I happened to bring one of those entities home with me and had to have my house cleansed.   Anyways, the window images are most likely cardboard cutouts because during halloween they put a skeleton in the windows. Sorry to ruin your fun, but believe me, the real stuff is way more entertaining.   This video link is me recording a quick walkthrough of the property.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv70BCxhOoo&index=8&list=PLfGwywUpqp1E4V5iYW2J3wBNZwmlhbrow  Here's another  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCKKxWI__FM&index=7&list=PLfGwywUpqp1E4V5iYW2J3wBNZwmlhbrow  Not much went on during my time there (besides bringing something home). One of the group members and I did hear a very audible giggle right between us in the basement. A child's entity is supposedly there. We didn't catch a recording though.   The MLS listing says you just need to provide a pre approval to the listing agent prior to showing. They are trying to prevent people from going exploring.   The house is being sold As Is and what the listing will not tell you is the house needs to be brought up to code if you ever intended on making it a business (tours and such). This means you would have to make everything handicap accessible which will cost you a small fortune.   Here's a link to the listing sheet and let me know if you are interested in buying it.

My brother and I were looking at places to buy back east when a friend sent me this one and it immediately grabbed my attention. A little more digging and I noticed those pictures on Google Maps.  As for the possibility of those images being cardboard cut-outs, I don’t know. Is it possible? Sure. But depending on the angle they are different. One has long hair. One has short hair. Being that this was taking from a moving car, how would they change so quickly? And according to Google Maps these were taken in August, not October. Mysterious, huh?  As for making an appointment, I’d love to. But I live in California, which doesn’t make travel there easy. I’m thinking on it. I DO absolutely love it. I’m completely enthralled with this place. But I think you’re right. It’s clear that this place needs TLC and would cost a small fortune."
Ghosts,33qmqo,DelRMi05,2,Fri Apr 24 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks for the response.  Those pictures are definitely cardboard cutouts and they have several of them on the 2nd and 3rd floor and alternate them.   I'm glad I had an opportunity to see these place before they put it on the market. It has some amazing history and some pretty famous figures have stayed there. (i.e. Bette Davis).  There were some pretty weird deaths too. A guy in the 1900's supposedly spontaneous combusted, and a woman of the night was strangled in a bedroom and left in the closet.   Further more, the owners found bones that they believed to be the remains of a small child in the furnace but the lab would not tell them anything definitively after they turned it in and contacted the police.

We went back to Library hall in the daylight and had a look around, there are no street lights in a position to have made a reflection on the window. I took the photo inside and showed the receptionist... She got very excited and said it was not the first time Ben (as in Franklin) had been seen on the premises. She also took me into the room the window is located in and there was nothing behind the window that could have been seen from the outside as the building was closed and dark at the time."

Ghosts,33icni,PristineSystem,12,Wed Apr 22 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"It being a byproduct of the sleeping brain makes perfect sense, actually. Not many studies have been done on sleep paralysis, but enough research exists on sleep that sleep paralysis is easily explained by things that happen often within the sleep cycle, but sleep paralysis is when several different events occur at the same time, to the misfortune of the sufferer. Look into hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations, and realize that the motor cortex is paralyzed every time you hit a certain phase of sleep. If something rouses the brain just enough to wake up during this phase of sleep, the motor cortex is still paralyzed by sleep, and the brain now has new input to work with in building a dreamlike state (something that also happens several times per night, often while the motor cortex is paralyzed -  so you don't move around too much while reacting to the dream; this is why it is hard to run or fight in dreams), around which these hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations may be built. I once had a hypnagogic hallucination in which I saw a little cartoon frog in my room. I was awake. I was actually looking around my room. But a frog was there. As I faded back into sleep, it disappeared.   As well, there is a certain part of the brain that, when stimulated, presents the person with the feeling of another presence. If religious, the person claims that they felt the presence of a deity or angel. If not, then of a spirit or other person. Here's an experiment in which they induce a ghostly presence feeling just by forcing proprioceptive drift within a person. It is caused by a contradiction in what the brain senses and what it perceives, and causes it to assume someone else must be there in a strange way. This creates a fear reaction, which in turn, fuels the hallucinations or dreams occurring, causing them to usually he unsettling or terrifying.   And here is what is called the God Helmet. This is the one that stimulates a part of the cortex which induces the strange feeling of an otherworldly presence.   Given all of this information, I find it much easier to believe, and much more likely, that sleep paralysis (for the vast majority; I can't possibly discount every case) is caused by natural processes in the brain rather than ghosts or aliens.  This isn't to say that I don't find value in what you said. It was a good read, and great explanation for why you believe what you do. I welcome any and all discussion about this kind of thing, so I'm glad you posted.  Edit: fixed mobile link."

It was developed by Koren and neuroscientist Michael Persinger to study creativity and the effects of subtle stimulation of the temporal lobes.  Reports by participants of a ""sensed presence"" while wearing the God helmet brought public attention and resulted in several TV documentaries.  The device has been used in Persinger's research in the field of neurotheology, the study of the neural correlations of religion and spirituality. The apparatus, placed on the head of an experimental subject, generates very weak fluctuating magnetic fields, that Persinger refers to as ""complex."" These fields are approximately as strong as those generated by a land line telephone handset or an ordinary hair dryer, but far weaker than that of an ordinary refrigerator magnet and approximately a million times weaker than transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Ghosts,33icni,MrMagiccakes,2,Thu Apr 23 03:45:36 2015 UTC,As a personal experience I've only had sleep paralysis once. And I was in a dream where I laying on the floor outside and it was raining at night. There were container trailers around me and a black figure standing on top of the trailer. I can't remember what I was yelling but I was definitely yelling at the figure. That's the one and only time I've experienced sleep paralysis.  edit: I should tell you what I felt during it. My entire body could not move except for my head. The feeling all over my body was the same feeling that you get when theres not enough blood circulation. That tingling feeling was all over my body and I was shaking. I guess I was trying to move but couldnt.
Ghosts,33icni,itsthesherf,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:41:26 2015 UTC,"The whole entire idea of sleep paralysis makes sense to me but I think that there may be more to it. The only reason I think this is because when I was stressed out for a week I would have sleep paralysis before I was even asleep and even a couple times when I would wake up and I would feel like someone was pressing down on me and I couldn't move. At this point I was so scared sometimes I wouldn't even sleep or I would try to avoid it for as long as I possibly could. It's a scary experience if you have no idea what it is or have never heard of it. One time it was very scary to the point where I couldn't move and I felt like I couldn't breathe, it seemed like I wasn't breathing at least. I felt like somebody was holding me down in my bed and I literally could not breathe. So maybe it has something to do with paranormal, maybe it doesn't, but honestly I think anything can happen. There are a lot of possibilities in this world."

Ghosts,33icni,UNCCGHC,0,Mon Jul 20 17:29:10 2015 UTC,"In the REM cycle of sleep, you have no control over any motor functions. This is because while in REM sleep you are dreaming and interpreting information that seems real (a dream) and if you had control over your body during this time you could possibly hurt yourself or at least wake yourself up which your body does not want to happen. When you wake up directly from REM sleep your body may experience a delay in returning motor function back over to you which can cause people to feel as if they ""are being held down"". There are also many scientific explanations for why someone can see or hear stimulus that isn't there during sleep/wake transitions. One is commonly referred to as ""exploding head syndrome"" where just before falling asleep or waking up you may hear someone yelling your own name or a loud bang that never happened due to a basic auditory hallucination.

Ghosts,32w9bv,Sookies_panties,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:02:53 2015 UTC,"So the backstory is I was living in a apartment building whose front faced a old funeral parlor turned bar called frank 'n stein. That place has subsequently closed as well but it is  right near the red brick building. One  sunny afternoon day a monarch butterfly got into the house and was trapped near the window. It was beautiful I wanted a pic but being a panicked butterfly caught between the storm window and outsie he was fluttering all over the shop so I took a bunch of pictures on my cellphone. As I was going through the photos to find the ""perfect"" one to post to fb I came across this. To me I see a large black mass over the funeral home which you can't really see and if you zoom in you can see a white man (poss wearing glasses?) Enveloped into the mass and almost in a black shroud coming out of the funeral parlor roof..or am I just seeing what I want to see? You tell me"

Ghosts,32j8ql,snowbirdie,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:30:56 2015 UTC,Someone just posted this same idea a week or so ago but for a phone app.   It's not a lot of work. It would take me 2-3 days to code front end and the database backend.  Plenty of sites have reporting tools.  The Google API part is extremely easy. The hard part is all the junk posts you get. Someone needs to actually moderate the site to validate the content people post. There's also legal issues. A lot of places do not want to be listed as haunted as it legitimately hurts business. Now you're liable for that. Then you lose interest and the site goes into decay after a couple years. I never advocate a single person doing sites like that. They always end up junk or decayed.

Talk to it as a human being. Ask it if there is something you can do to help it. If it continues to make a mess, then tell it to firmly leave. Often mentioning the name of a deity and saying ""in deity's name I order you to leave"" will help. If you can't get rid of it with a deity, then use the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram.   A ghost box can also be made by de-tuning a radio.   Don't, and I repeat, don't use a ouija board."

If you want to contact it, you can do it respectfully, but I'd seriously advise against challenging it. Not because it'd necessarily get mad, but because it's extremely rude. You can try ghost boxes (there's an app by steve huff for 50$, it works) or a Ouija board I guess, if you're feeling adventurous."

It seems like you're being hostile solely because I dont share your views on its legitimacy. I'm sorry, I never meant to say "" this works for sure"". But I also think nothing, in the paranormal field, is ""for sure"".  To answer your question, I recorded several sessions, and I got some results that made a lot of sense.

Ghosts,32da31,TheBigBlackCat,4,Sun Apr 12 20:52:21 2015 UTC,"It can be common to have child spirits remain in old homes without an authority spirit watching over them. Many family's throughout history gained the bulk of their wealth in the 17th century. As it was a productive era, we have to give thought to the children who lived somewhat neglected while their family name was built. Because spirits of children are often accompanied by a mentally distraught spirit of a relative, being manipulated by a dark entity, or tainted by a false sense of freedom causing major disruptions; paranormal society, in general, distrust child spirits.   If I was in your position I'd ask myself the following questions:   Is the child attached to the home or the land? This is important for researching who he is as well as figuring out what, if any, communication he's attempting.  Is the child alone? Think about it - If the child is well behaved & non-intrusive there may be a mother or father entity keeping him from going wild, so to speak.  Why is he here? The most important question. The only thing holding him from his true destination may be something as simple as the child not understanding how death works."

It's 3 in the morning btw. So as I'm talking to my friend... I hear a little girl laughing in my living room! I ignore her.. because I think I'm going crazy but then my friend looks at me, stops and says with her eyes wide open, "" Did you just hear that little girl laughing?"" When we both realized what we heard really happened we ran to my room and my friend started balling her eyes out completely freaked out. We think the little girl was the one throwing the rocks, and when she saw our reactions to the rocks being thrown she started laughing because she spooked us. she sounded 3- 5 years old, and the giggle was so delicate and innocent. She sounded like she had a very beautiful soul, the room was not heavy, I did not have a feeling of fear. the only reason my friend cried was its kind of freaky hearing a voice.. but not seeing a body. but neither of us felt threatend. This was a one time thing in the apartment, nothing ever happened again.... very random but very memorable."

Well, one night I was laying in bed ready for sleep to take me when ""someone"" really loudly when ""SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" in my ear, as though to scare me.  But when I opened my eyes, no one was there and my dog was freaking the f*ck out.  So we talked to some nuns at that bible store Pauline's and they were like yeah you need to get the house blessed, took us really seriously, gave us the demonologist's phone number because ghosts can't talk, but demons, poltergeists, etc can.  So the entity you're dealing with is likely not human.  Anyways in my case, we hung some St Benedictine medallions around the house and all paranormal problems ended immediately."

I've had nightmares with SC features in them that made me wonder if the game interfered with my sleep. It's a possibility.   My second thought: Is there a chance a spirit around you is causing you to have disturbing dreams and experiences? It doesn't hurt to cleanse your home for protection by using sage & salt; both should be used after extensive research. I think the sage will probably be used first all over the home then the salt to further protect your sleeping area. With or without cleansing - a lot of times I feel anxious and irritated when a spirit is around me. If you start to feel this way, state firmly aloud: ""You do not have permission to be around me.

Isn't it very arrogant to claim something does not exist because you have never experienced it? Yes, science is great. But it is not infallible - and just because you can not prove something does not mean it doesn't exist. We have probably just skimmed the surface of what there is to understand of this universe. People come here to share their experiences. Discussion and questions are fine, but saying someone is off their meds is uncalled for."

My point was that it is arrogant for people to claim that something someone else experienced was BS or impossible because they had never experienced it (whatever ""it"" may be).  I never said disagreeing with someone makes them a gerk. In fact, what I said was skepticism is good- without the name calling. The people I was referring to come to these boards not to have a discussion or disagree, but to attack posters and tell them they ""must be off their meds"". There's a difference.

They also don't help humans do things that could cause trouble, like winning a million dollars. That could do both good and bad things if the money was used improperly. Spirits are here to guide you on the right track. They don't give you lottery numbers. They have no need for money or for acclaim. After you are dead, it is just bliss, but even perfect is not perfect."

Spirits were originally people, but after they cross over, they see the pointlessness of getting bitches and money. They know that you are here for a short while and then you die. They just don't care about a million dollars and see that happiness can be claimed in different ways. Remember the Beatles song, Can't buy me love? It is sort of a good thing to live by. You can have all of the money in the world, but are you truly going to be happy? Are you going to learn the life lessons that we all need to learn before death in order to get closer to not having to reincarnate? Probably not if we have a million dollars. We wouldn't need to experience the pain that is needed to learn the lessons.   And I know you are a skeptic, but I didn't make the thread to have a huge debate. I just wanted to answer your question as best I could. If you don't believe, then that is okay."

I had it explain more about this subject. Also they are not allowed to let humans exert control over other people in the form of money. That would be going against free will. Hope that helps."
Ghosts,325den,HunterZ82,1 point,Sun May 31 05:32:11 2015 UTC,So you can have a kick ass time in that finite life time. That's why.

Ghosts,325den,DrainageEliDrainage,3,Sun Apr 12 13:25:26 2015 UTC,"your girlfriend's gift is both fascinating and terrifying. I wanted to know if she ever asked why spirits hung around, when they weren't connected to you (like sitting in the back of your car, stuff), why do some attach themselves to people. or do only negative entities do this? I have very weak abilities but I can (weakly) sense things sometimes. I used to dismiss it but one day I was doing a ghost box session, and the radio said ""behind you"" then ""on you"" right as I had that feeling. I tried asking them myself why some hanged around if they didn't need help (whenever I ask they just answer ""no"" languidly thru the ghost box) and the answer I got was something about warmth. but I don't trust my pathetic abilities nor the ghost box that much, so I thought, maybe she'd know?  as for her issues keeping things at bay, from the mediums I've seen it's all in the self confidence to say ""you are not welcome here"" etc etc but that's, hard to do when you see and sense things like that, ain't it."
Ghosts,325den,UnkelBewger,2,Sat Apr 11 03:56:20 2015 UTC,Spirits like your energy. They especially like people that have the ability to sense them. They can also be attached to things that you buy at a thrift store or to other objects. I actually had to throw out a lot of my clothes because a particularly annoying spirit was attached to them. Negative entities attach to people if they attempt to open themselves up to them with rituals or with ouija boards (really bad). Hope that helps.
Ghosts,325den,Honeychile6841,3,Sat Apr 11 17:45:42 2015 UTC,What does she do to protect herself?
Ghosts,325den,Honeychile6841,2,Sat Apr 11 09:03:11 2015 UTC,"She actually learned a prayer to say. Since there is a lot of energy in the christian belief, it seems to keep evil spirits away when she prays. I don't remember exactly what she says, but she says something like: in the name of the father, son, and holy spirit, leave. She says it over and over. I have watched her do that and strange noises and things have stopped. The room also feels less heavy. Although, you have to understand that she doesn't go to church, or practice the bible or whatever. She's not a strict christian."
Ghosts,325den,LocalFluff,-1,Sat Apr 11 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"So if the evil spirits cannot stand infront of the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19), maybe we should listen to the truth spoken by the Father, Son & Holy Spirit instead of believing the lies of spirits ..   Matthew 12:22-30 22 Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. 23 And all the people were amazed, and said, “Can this be the Son of David?” 24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.” 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. 26 And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 29 Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. 30 Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters."

Or when she described my brother and what he looks like. She has never seen him. She also described his mannerisms. One time, she had him hold my hand. It felt tingly and cold like an invisible hand. Later on, and I mentioned this before, we went to a cemetery and rolled a ball to some ghost children that kept laughing and rolling it back."

It is also a two way street because some spirits may just not want to talk to you. A spirit was someone that was living and died. Spirits can also be those that visit from heaven, such as your passed on family members. A ghost is another name for a spirit that is angry that you called it a ghost lol. Poltergeists are just spirits that are really good at manipulating physical objects. All spirits can do this, some just do it better than others."

Ghosts,325den,xhieron,3,Sat Apr 11 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"Not really... I think she has helped a few. Sometimes they get really angry when you try. The way that she helps them is by contacting those that are living that the spirit knew. Many times they attempt to tell her messages to tell to people, but they don't always come through in the most coherent way. For example, there was one spirit that was writing A's on her bathroom mirror. She eventually found out that the spirit wanted to contact her daughter and tell her something. I can find out more about this. I kinda forgot the story I will ask my gf when she gets back."

Ghosts,325den,throwahay96,7,Fri Apr 10 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"All I have learned about heaven has been from my deceased brother. He tells me that even perfection isn't perfect. That is was an odd concept. Basically, you got to heaven after you cross over after death. Or you just remain trapped between, I guess what we would call purgatory, and heaven. In any case, heaven is very blissful and peaceful. Everyone there is also oddly connected. You can talk to whomever you want, when you want. There is no hell, only reincarnation. Basically, after your life ends if you are not truly sorry for the things that were revealed to be ""bad"" done to other people (after the review process after death), you are reincarnated. No religion is the true religion. Certain parts of different religions are true. That is about all I have learned so far. A lot of the time, my brother's spirit is not allowed to reveal the true state after death. It's kind of a wait until you get there thing."

She seldom entertains the possibility of becoming a medium, but when she watches mediums on TV, she says that they open themselves up too much and she doesn't agree with that.

Ghosts,325den,MyLouBear,6,Fri Apr 10 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"The majority come from ""Heaven"" basically all people who died, unless reincarnated, can visit you from heaven. One thing my girlfriend says is that it would not be a great place to be after you died if you aren't able to see your family. The place is termed heaven, but you have to think outside of the Christian Mythos. Essentially, spirits (especially your relatives and friends) drop by and check on you, and then return to heaven when they want to. Other spirits aren't stuck on Earth, they have either forgotten that they were dead, or are scared of crossing over to the other side, or just don't want to. In other words, they have unfinished business. Some just enjoy pissing people off, like moving things or hiding things, or just trying to scare you. One thing that I have noticed is that the spirits follow her around and they tend to stay in some of the rooms of my house after she stays over. After burning some sage, they leave. I also have a protective symbol that keeps my office protected. She has told me that it sort of repels the spirits because she sees them outside of the door, and when we put it in other rooms, they can't enter those places either."

Now the cafeteria is closed and there isn't anyone in sight which is normal especially working night shift. So I go up to the machine, make my selection, and as I reach down to grab my food I hear ""hey"" directly behind me and clear as day. It was so clear I actually said hey and turned to see who it was.

Ghosts,31lkzp,Amorevolous,3,Mon Apr 6 06:23:53 2015 UTC,"This is nothing more than a hypothesis. They need to determine:   A threshold for how much of the mold needs to be introduced to the body before any effects actually take place. How long before any effects take place.  If being in one of these haunted houses would even expose an individual to that threshold.   This idea is in very early stages still. I do like the concept though, I really hope they continue with this and possibly find an actual connection. But for now it's a bit misleading to claim they have found a ""link""."
Ghosts,31lkzp,valdeina,3,Tue Apr 7 09:04:15 2015 UTC,"Why can't it be both? Maybe the hallucinogenic mold can open a door way to see the things that we can't normally see?  I view everything in life as if I'm not always seeing the whole story. The point is, we don't know everything about everything. We are learning more and more about our natural world and yet there are still things we can't explain. We can't explain it because we can't see the whole story. How much more do we know now than we did a 100 years ago?  I've had a lot of strange things happen to me in childhood and adulthood. The more I get into research, the more I realize that no one else knows for sure.  I'll just tell you one of my experiences and it has to do with mold. I moved into a townhouse with my three year old daughter and a roommate. I'm a sensitive person to all sorts of things but I have not been this sensitive since I was a young child. I ""felt"" as if there was someone else in the house with us. It's an unmistakable feeling that you can't believe in until you feel it yourself.   Anyway, as time went by, I felt that this ""entity"" wanted to speak to me. Desperately. What made it worse for me is that my daughter began to see it too. She would start looking in the directions that I was ""feeling"" it. One night, as I lay in bed, I ""felt"" that something was ""waving its arms in front of my face"". I ""felt"" that this thing, whatever it was, was getting closer to revealing itself to me. It had something very important to say to me but I was not prepared to see it! It terrified me! So, I said out loud, ""do NOT show yourself to me. I'm scared of you! If you have to say something, make me dream about it!"" That night, I had a dream that I moved my bed to the opposite side of the room. That was it.  The next morning, I said okay. I'm gonna move the bed. Guess what I found behind my bed frame? Mold! Thick, greenish-black mold.  I cleaned the mold, but I don't think I was hallucinating what I felt. I think there was something in that house and I still felt it after. It left me alone though. It just wanted to help me."
Ghosts,31lkzp,DelRMi05,3,Sat Apr 18 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"Extremely plausible. As an investigator I will now want to look at this in client's homes. That being said, how does it account for the interactions that groups of us experience? I get voices on tape in some cases that mold can't replicate. That being said, show me some cheap air quality testers."
Ghosts,31lkzp,InsaneClonedPuppies,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:43:36 2015 UTC,No mold in my concrete 100 year old apt building. Nothing that would cause both living people in the home to hear whoever it was rummaging through my pantry.

Ghosts,31lkzp,Abbey-Road,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:13:01 2015 UTC,"I donno. It would go against what I have experienced such as I had lived in a small school house that was turned into a home. Nothing big or fancy but there would be doors closing and things falling off of shelves. A cousin who lived with us for a time said he saw a woman standing in the living room but dismissed it as a dream but then said he had a dream that he saw the woman again and she said her name was ""J"". There were some other things but i'm fast forwarding 10 years late I had been moved out for a while and was dating a girl that I worked with that lived there. I completely forgot about the ghost and just thought it was neat that I was shtupping a girl in my old home. Anyway she told me she thinks the place is haunted and said she had a dream of a woman who was a schoolteacher who said her name was ""J"" AND her roommate had a scream fit one thinking she saw  a woman in the kitchen and swears she saw it. The point im making that Mold could not have done this! Perhaps another reason like homes being like cameras to people. Absorbing them in some way and playing it back. Its a Stephen King theory. Heck you could be haunting a house right now if that were true."
Ghosts,31hj4l,ch0ding,3,Sun Apr 5 03:22:32 2015 UTC,I watched a couple of episodes yesterday for the first time. The first one about an abandoned school in Japan and the second about a ruins complex in Thailand. I liked the premise of trying to explain that sometimes 'hauntings' may just be perceived bad energy from historic events and tales but for me the show just missed the mark. I found it quite boring and I just didn't enjoy the host. I felt like they spend a lot of time just sticking photos and post-it's to a wall. It also felt like an excessive amount of reinactment footage. I will probably give it another chance but it really failed to make a good first impression an grab me.
Ghosts,31hj4l,reddit_somewhere,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:47:48 2015 UTC,"I've seen quite a few episodes myself and completely agree with you. I like the idea of the show and love the history aspect of it, but it kinda drags on and I kinda feel the host is disregarding those who have seen spirits as ""crazy"" merely by the fact that he himself doesn't believe."

It's probably the most dramatic footage I've seen, which makes me wonder if it's a prank show from Thailand scaring some poor woman."
Ghosts,30wm3q,ProfMarvel,5,Tue Mar 31 10:19:08 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering the same things. If it is a prank/hoax it is extremely well executed and incredibly cruel to that poor woman, unless she's acting of course. In any case, getting chairs and tables to fly around like that would be pretty tricky, unless it's just CG and that's why it's a low quality video that someone's filmed on a monitor with their phone or something.

Ghosts,30wm3q,macwelsh007,9,Tue Mar 31 16:39:35 2015 UTC,I actually appreciate the skepticism of this subreddit. There are too many people out there willing to accept anything they see. It's good to have a forum where hoaxes and frauds get called out. That way if any good evidence actually shows up you can take it a little more seriously.
Ghosts,30wm3q,bobafett18,0,Tue Mar 31 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"Just because we have an interest in the paranormal doesn't mean that we have a blind acceptance to everything that is posted about it. I have seen videos that have truly made me scratch my head. I have had personal experiences with the paranormal that neither me or anyone I was with could possibly explain. But does that mean I should accept every piece of evidence brought up in order to help prove the existence of the paranormal? Not by a long shot.   The awesome thing about subs like /r/ghosts, /r/paranormal, and /r/paranormalsource is that they drive discussion, debate, and thinking. These things SHOULD be encouraged. Analyzing video, audio, and picture evidence is a ton of fun! Because of so many faked videos/pictures/audio, you have to look at the evidence presented with a more skeptical mind.   Don't look at it as ""shitting"" on the videos or pictures presented. Look at it as rooting through all the faked and nonsense in order to be presented with real evidence captured by people who care about the paranormal field. Those videos are way more valuable to the paranormal community than those faked videos that are created only to generate ""hits"" and ""subscribers"""

Ghosts,30wm3q,bobafett18,2,Sat Apr 4 14:08:25 2015 UTC,"This video really doesn't sit right with me and not in the ""i'm really spooked out"" kind of way.  First off, it doesn't help that the video has spooky music laid out in it. If it was real evidence, why is there that audio track and typing beneath the CTV footage? Also, not having any kind of backstory at all doesn't help the evidence either. These things are a bit nitpicky so I'll just overlook these.  After watching the first half, did anyone notice the chair moving in an extremely twitchy fashion? It looked to me like stop motion filming. It was extremely twitchy especially compared to the second half of the video. I know that there is a time stamp at the top (figured I'd address this before getting called out on it) but those are easily added post production and doesn't really do anything for me.  The second half of the video was extremely interesting. I've rewatched that tons of times to see if anyone was hiding under the tables or chairs manipulating them or pulling a short fishing line. I couldn't see any. I was thinking ""wow, this is pretty interesting"".  Then....the disappointing thing happened. All the chairs and desks moving to the lower left part of the room was a bit...over the top. What I mean is that takes an ENORMOUS amount of energy for a spirit to manipulate. In all the real evidence I've ever seen, I've never seen anything manifest that much energy to move all of that at once (not poltergeist or alleged demons). So, if something is outside of the normal evidence (verified paranormal evidence) it tends to be a fraud.  Just my two cents"

Ghosts,30ufrb,I_Am_Legacy,2,Mon Mar 30 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend an audio recorder for your first piece of equipment. Your own eyes and ears are your best tools. There are a lot of low budget techniques you can use also. Anything from a ball to see if anything can move it, same with a bell on a string, kids toys (i.e cars) or even baby powder on the floor to see if there are footprints...there are varying things you can try to see if anything occurs. Research the place you are investigating. An old desk bell might stir things up in an old hotel. Music cues are good also, that's playing music from the era. Remember basics such as your eyes take time to adjust to darkness so you may see ""things"" that are caused by that. I've seen people turn off a million candle power light and 5 minutes later see ""something"". It's actually their eyes adjusting. If you use a digital camera with a flash in a dusty building or dusty conditions, you'll get orbs of dust not orbs of the dead. Try and debunk anything and everything, if you can't then maybe you got something. I could go on and on."
Ghosts,30ufrb,NippleBuddy,3,Mon Mar 30 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"A good voice recorder. It's your most important tool. Get two so you can compare them. You want a recorder that captures lower DB frequencies. You also want one that has a monitor, so that you can listen live. Annnddd make sure it has a wind screen. A used H3 off ebay is a good choice.   Get a UV or red flashlight. You don't want something really bright. UV is pretty nifty but it can hurt your eyes after awhile.   Don't use flash. Really, no one seems to understand how cameras work. Unless you buy a modified camera, you're just going to catch regular visible light. No ghosts, just dust orbs, light artifacts, and bugs. Don't even bother. A video camera may be worth it for catching shadows though. Nothing fancy is needed there.   An EMF detector is pretty standard but you need to understand how EMF works and debunk things. Most clueless kids leave their cell phone on while investigating and that triggers high EMF on incoming mail and such. They can be pretty cheap. Buy used.   I bring cases upon cases of equipment to investigations but what really holds up with evidence is always the voice recorders. Put your money there to start."

I'm at the point where I'm ready to be open to his presence if he should wish to make it known, but it's still a very emotional issue for me.

Ghosts,2zggxa,retin,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:33:07 2015 UTC,"I never really thought about the possibility of the debris being haunted. I honestly thought that ground zero would be haunted as shit, but I guess it makes sense that they are ""attached"" to the debris.  My personal belief is that the woman with sandwiches was someone within the building when it was hit. Perhaps she was carrying a tray of sandwiches to an important meeting, but never made it there due to an airliner striking the building. Maybe she is still wandering around, trying to find the boardroom before the sandwiches go soggy.  That would be one shitty after life. Doomed to carry sandwiches for eternity.  Definitely going to buy this book when I get the chance.  I can't remember where I heard it, but I remember a story that came out of the attacks. Apparently there was a woman who was frantically approaching several firefighters saying that her husband was trapped in the rubble. She apparently had no silt or dirt on her, and was wearing a red blazer and black pants. She had pointed to the area where her husband was buried, and a few guys started sifting through it. They ended up finding a man in critical condition, but alive. The firefighters looked around to find this man's wife, but she was nowhere to be seen. They told the man that they will contact his wife to let her know he was found, and apparently the man was confused but didn't ask questions.  It wasn't until he was recovering in the hospital that the men that found him showed up to visit him. He was thanking them over and over, saying that if it wasn't for them his son would grow up an orphan.  The firefighters were confused and asked about his wife. The man didn't know what they were talking about, and the firefighters ended up describing her down to her red blazer. The man was stunned and told them that his wife had died from brain cancer the year before. She was buried in a red blazer.  I know, I know. It's like a ""WHO WAS PHONE?"" story. But with all of the sadness and terrible stories coming out of ground zero, this one has always stayed in my mind.  On a quick note, I also remember a video on YouTube (which I can't seem to find now, conveniently) that showed interviews with several people on ground zero. There were four people (three middle aged men and one older woman) who claimed to have seen the same thing before the first tower collapsed. The four of them were outside of the buildings looking up when they saw a large black mass ""fly"" away from the building with incredible speed. They said it looked like a giant bat, and apparently the building collapsed several seconds later. Reminded me of Mothman, although I wouldn't be surprised if it was just a large piece of debris being tossed by a collapsing building. Weird stuff, either way."

Ghosts,2z1tlm,owlties,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"Wow- I wouldn't even know where to start in responding to your situation! I have done lots of work with the ghostbox and I have them say my name, as well, and also respond to things around me- though I think, not the extent that you do. Do you do any kind of protection before using your ghostbox? I generally do, more out of habit than a fear of anything going on. If I were you, I'd consider doing a protective prayer before doing any kind of spirt work/exploration.  Some of the physical feelings you are describing sound as if you have strong mediumistic capabilities. This can be a double edged sword- especially if you are not educated in this type of thing. If you want to go forward with working with spirits, it's always a good idea to look up your local Spiritualist Church- they are a goldmine of information and help.  The spirt 'inside' you, and the ghostbox mentioning it. Yes, there is a possibility that when you challenged the spirit it went inside you. I do lots of spiritual healing and I have happened upon lots of spirit attachments. Do you feel as if the spirit is still with you? You can PM me if you want in regards to that- I can help you (free of charge). I wouldn't be overly worried- a lot of people have spirit attachments and don't even know about it.  But just so you know- don't go around challenging or insulting spirits. It's not a good idea.   Also, take anything a ghostbox says with a grain of salt. There is a lot of weird talking going on, making not a lot of sense. I still am not totally sure what we are communicating with-at best they are semi intelligent. Pretty much, ghostboxes are just fucking weird.I love using them, but I don't really know what they are about!"

I'm not overly worried about that spirit thing inside because I went to a local church later that week and had a priest bless me. Ever since I haven't felt anything anymore, so I guess I'm good! I'll do some research on that whole mediumistic things although I'm pretty sure I don't have anything of that sort. I met yesterday a girl who had flashes where she'd see the future, so honestly, feeling things from time to time doesn't seem much in comparison omg... Anyways thanks again!"

Ghosts,2ywwdk,Gh0stHunt3r,4,Fri Mar 13 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"I wasn't thinking at the time, and I really didn't think I would get anything. I didn't want silence while I was there, I needed as many distractions as possible at the time to not totally break down."
Ghosts,2ywwdk,Gh0stHunt3r,3,Fri Mar 13 16:53:34 2015 UTC,that's very understandable. I had to clean out my brothers things and I know how hard that was...   But some good solid EVP's there so it would seem..
Ghosts,2ywwdk,garyadams_cnla,5,Fri Mar 13 17:35:00 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for sharing.  That's really something.  I hope you're doing okay.

Ghosts,2ywwdk,sandyravage_,2,Sat Mar 14 10:48:41 2015 UTC,"When I first played it back, I was shocked. My heart started racing and I began to hyperventilate. I really didn't expect to get anything, the 1st EVP was about 10+ mins into it, and I played it over and over just to be sure that a) I was actually hearing something and b) what the words were that ""he"" was saying. Then I let the recording play on and I was floored with the ""back pocket"" EVP, it was so clear, there was no mistaking it."
Ghosts,2ywomj,P8ntballz,2,Fri Mar 13 13:27:15 2015 UTC,I have investigated many private residences for scared families and many times what is happening is family visitation. I would consider this a gift.

Ghosts,2ywomj,loveistruth,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"From what I've learned, since you are already sensitive to those things, you could try using a ghost box to communicate with them. The more you use it, the more they realize there is a chance to interact and the more they'll come to you. But you have to be clear in that you don't want anything malicious coming to you. As long as you're clear on that, that you only welcome friendly entities, you should be good."

Ghosts,2yvlzx,FurrySlippers,5,Fri Mar 13 04:21:55 2015 UTC,umm yes i wanna hear that other story!
Ghosts,2yvlzx,seekunrustlement,2,Fri Mar 13 05:56:25 2015 UTC,"The second story is very similair.  I was living in a different city and decided to come home and visit my parents.  My sister had just moved out, and my old bedroom has been turned into an office, so I was put up in my sisters room.  Everything as normal in the day, we go out for food, have some drinks and then I go to bed.  A few hours later I get woken up, but nothing in the room.  I go back to sleep and start to have nightmares and have a cold sweat.  Pretty much as before, I start tossing and turning, in and out of sleep.  At one point I turn over and see a little girl stood at the foot of the bed, about 6 or 7 years old, in a victorian style dress with pinafore.  I dismiss it as a nightmare and exhaustion from constantly waking up and turn over and try to get back to sleep.  The next morning at breakfast, my mom asks me if I slept ok.  I tell her that I didn't and that I had a nightmare about a little girl stood at the foot of my bed.  My mom, who is very down to earth and level headed, says casually, oh you've seen her too, I've seen her stood in our bedroom.  She then went on to describe her, which was exactly as I described her here.  I'd lived in this house for 11 years and not experienced a thing, and then the one time I come back to stay, and stay in my sisters room, this happens.  A bit of background on the house.  The house is part of an 11 house cul-de-sac.  The cul-de-sac was built in the 80s, and the land it sits on used to be a large manor house.  My dad and I both remember the house as we both used to walk past it to the school we both went to, obviously decades apart.  When we moved into the house, my dad, who likes his local history, did a lot of research into the old house.  The East wing of the house, which sat over where my parents house is, was apparently the nursery of the house.  Coincidence, maybe.  This information was only imparted to me after I told my mom about my experience."

Ghosts,2yn7eh,LaEmmaFuerte,3,Wed Mar 11 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with nevermore90038; I think it has to do with puberty.  For whatever reason, hormonal changes that girls go through can sometimes result in clarity of mental vision and other ""powers.""  It sounds like the girl is seeing the first signs of her gift.  I was 12 when I hit puberty and that was around the time I saw objects moving on their own and occasionally on command.  That lasted for a few years, then became rare, and has now almost stopped (almost 20 years later.)  If she wants this to stop she needs to firmly tell it to stop and go away or she needs to have a time once a day or once a week to ""talk"" to the spirit at a specified time so that it doesn't sneak up on her.  Hope she can work this out and stop being afraid!"
Ghosts,2yn7eh,frostfromfire,6,Thu Mar 12 00:43:09 2015 UTC,"Many children can see ghosts. One theory is that children can see into the UV spectrum, but lose this ability when they hit puberty.  It sounds like this girl may be an empath, people who can see ghosts all the time throughout their lives. (Much like the boy in ""The Sixth Sense"") My advice would be to consult a paranormal group in the area that has an empath or a sensitive as a member. A positive role model may make these visions less scary.  I've been touched by a ghost on at least 2 occasions and yes, it can be unsettling. But think about it... if you had no voicebox, how would you get someone's attention? Would you tap on their shoulder? Would you pull on their hair? Would you tug on their clothes?  An analogy I like to use with people encountering a ghost for the first time is this... Imagine if you're in a remote village in Siberia. You don't speak Russian and no one seems to speak English. Then one day, you hear one person speaking English. Would you not rush over to that person and say hello?"
Ghosts,2yn7eh,nevermore90038,3,Wed Mar 11 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"children can see into the UV spectrum   I thought you were completely bullshitting and was ready to call you out on it but I did some research and holy sh*t that's true, I can't believe I'd never heard about that.  With age our blue and violet response fades."
Ghosts,2yn7eh,WhistlingDead,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:45:20 2015 UTC,"Only MILDLY.  If you take a photo of a flower with the UV filter removed and allow the sensor to capture it, the flower looks wildly different. It's not how flowers looked to us as a kid.  It's how bees see flowers. We just can see the higher wavelengths better as kids, we don't get bee-type vision.  There's no things walking around that adults can't see. Nothing ever reflects or radiates just one wavelength anyway."
Ghosts,2yn7eh,snowbirdie,2,Wed Mar 11 18:29:07 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm still pretty sure the ""ghosts are in the UV spectrum"" thing is sketchy."
Ghosts,2yn7eh,WhistlingDead,-2,Wed Mar 11 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"I first heard it from Barry Fitzgerald of GHI. Sounds crazy, but it may explain why kids can ""see"" ghosts..."
Ghosts,2yn7eh,nevermore90038,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:57:44 2015 UTC,"If it is frightening her:   Have her in a clear, firm voice tell the entities that she does not wish to see or hear or feel them. That they are in her house and she needs to feel safe in her own house.   This has worked all times except one for me. At that time, though, I was living with an empath- so there was a lot of crazy energy going on.   In the end, I've realized that ghosts are not scary. They are at best mildly annoying. My cats bother me more. But the first time was very unsettling."
Ghosts,2yn7eh,DigitalGarden,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"I told my friend this and hopefully it works for her daughter.  They're going to burn the sage this weekend together while the rest of the house is out at work so they can both focus on it and deal with it together since they seem to be the only ones affected by it.  My friend admitted to me today that five years ago she'd been touched by what she calls ""Russel"" when she was in bed.  She felt a firm pressure rub back and forth across her legs and she shouted, ""God damn it, Russel!  I'm trying to sleep!"" and she hadn't had anything else happen to her physically after that."

Ghosts,2ygjsi,Anabelle83,2,Tue Mar 10 11:27:42 2015 UTC,"No, or at least I didn't. My cousin may have and not admitted it to me. The dream was not the only incident so now that you mention this it makes me feel she may have allowed something to enter the room because activity increased for a bit but she always noted more inside cars than myself. The strongest occurrences I was personally witness to was the day I was in the room and she was actually outside the French door. (A little more information on the room) The room had only one light in the center and it was a pull string there was no actual switch do to the remodeling of it into a room with a bathroom. Well at one end was the built closet for my cousin and at the other end was a clothes rack where I had my stuff. In the center of the room was the pull string. I never had the light on during the day (why would I, the room set up allowed for plenty of natural light) well as I was sifting through my outfits on the side closest to the windows in the dark...  ""Click"" The light was on. I froze in fear and called for my cousin as loud and my paralyzed body would let me. And again thinking back at it her response was quite odd. She was fearful the day we realized we were sharing a nightmare... But on this day with such an unexpected phenomenon she slowly walked into the room... Looked directly at me and calmly said ""you will be ok""."

Ghosts,2ybinu,peaches_mcgeee,3,Sun Mar 8 21:01:41 2015 UTC,"I feel for you. I see them, as well as other less human beings. Like you, I generally don't see them head on, and I can't hear them unless I am asleep or near-sleep, but I feel them and see them in my peripheral vision. Let me just say that your son is incredibly lucky to have someone who can talk to him about what he sees--I don't know about you, but I've had an incredibly hard time dealing with this until the past few years as I have had little support from anyone around me (Southern Baptist family and so on). And, he does have the ability to block them out a bit, but it takes some time and practice. If it were me, I would wait until he's a bit older to explain exactly what it is he's seeing, as he will want to tell his friends too soon, and also he probably hasn't had much of a chance or the developmental capacity to wrestle with questions about death. Or rather, I would answer the questions as simply as I can when he decides to ask them, and save the in-depth discussion for when he's older."
Ghosts,2ybinu,Comfycreeper,3,Mon Mar 9 00:05:14 2015 UTC,My bed vibrates a little bit. I ghosts have turned my computer on and sat on my bed. Some have also walked up and down my stairs for hours.

So all credit to you and I hope some of that strength rubs off on your son.  I do have to say though - and this isn't intended to mock you at all - but your life sounds like a mixture of The Frighteners, Odd Thomas and The Sixth Sense.  I say this partly because that is how it feels when I read your words but also because I think that it is worth you writing your experiences down in a lot more detailed and structured manner than Reddit will allow you."

Ghosts,2ybinu,mohda1999,3,Sun Mar 8 22:01:00 2015 UTC,"My dad's girlfriend has this problem. She can also feel if there's a ghost before she enters a property. If she feels something negative she avoids it all together. But from what I can tell from what she's shared she just kind of ignores it, there have been a couple ghosts that she's helped or has had kind of an ongoing relationship with them. Because she sees them so often and she can somewhat communicate with them. Her daughter also inherited it from her but not as strong. She doesn't see the ghosts she just feels them."

There's two ghosts that I can think of that she has an ongoing ""relationship"" with one is a girl in a graveyard that she's drives passed everyday on her way to work and there's a young guy that she sees in what used to be an abandoned house next to her ex husbands shop. The girl in the graveyard doesn't want anything but is friendly and says hi. The young man used to be sad all the time and lonely and crying but she could tell he wasn't mean so she talked her ex into buying the house and fixing it up as a rental. Since people have moved in the young man is always smiling and waving at her. I just recently moved and I made sure she checked the house out first because I trust her. The last house I lived in she saw a woman in there and I had some experiences as well but nothing big. It's definitely very interesting.

Ghosts,2ybinu,Vitamin_C_is_awesome,3,Sun Mar 8 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"i thought about this for a while. i think my favorite weird experience with this is the one i'm about to relate on several levels. the first being it witness by two on duty police officers, and the second is after that the ghost left and never returned, and since this happened at work, it was a great relief. and third parts of this were witness by my coworkers as well. and the fourth is i actually heard something from a ghost for the first time in an auditory manner.  i was working at the time as a night clerk at a 24 hour gas station. i currently live, as i mentioned in a small town. the night shift was not that busy even though we were just about the only thing open. the local cops and sheriff's deputies would congregate at my place of business out of a lack of anything to do, and the fact we had a single table and a few chair they could park their ass in on a lunch break. up unto this point i had experienced little things. like once i was alone, and i had a mop and bucket moved across the room and placed in front or a door to a freezer, so that when i opened the freezer i spilled the damn mop bucket. you had to have a code to get into the back of the store. i worked by myself, and ran the joint, alone from 11pm to 7am every night, as as per usual, was quite alone.   i had also heard a mans voice, kinda mumbling in the back of the place, and saw a tall, dark haired, paunchy, middle aged guy with a sad face off and on for several months in the back of the store, sort of jumping out from behind shit and startling the crap out of me. he wore a white button up and grey slacks. also during the two years i worked there products would be moved, knocked over, etc. so it was sort of a pain in the ass. on more than one occasion i actually swore out loud type of deal. this guy bugged me enough i started asking questions of the local, sort of trying to find out what was this place before it was a convenience store. i had a group of old guys that would come in before the sun rose every morning and drink coffee. they were a wealth of information. apparently before it was a store, it was a bar, and before that a speak easy. the guy who owned it when it was a bar (a 20 or thirty year span in the late fifties to the early seventies.) was apparently a local legend of shorts and was NOTORIOUS for playing practical jokes. a lot of them knew him before he died, and their description was dead on. according to them this guy dropped dead of a heart attack at about 60 or so. he also did it on the premisses.   i now know who my tall dark pain in the ass is.   flash forward a few months and i have a couple of cops sitting drinking coffee bullshitting with me. they are across the room at the table, and i am across several isles of shit up by the counter mopping the place. it is just the three of us, and has been for over an hour, and all of a sudden the room fills with a booming voice that says, and i quote, ""SEE YOU SOON MATT! HAVE A GREAT NIGHT!""  then the sensor that bings when some opens the door, bings. the cops jumped to their feet, and i shit you not both of them drew their guns. we all three searched the entirety of the store (it was good size and had a full industrial kitchen in the back). after that they left and didn't come back for over a week. when they did come back neither one wanted to talk about it. the next morning i told my manager about it and she watched the security tapes, and laughed her ass off at the cops jumping like scared kids and drawing their weapons. she proceeds to show the rest of the crew the tape. there was unfortunately no audio on the cameras, but it was still pretty great, and made me feel not so crazy. the see you soon part has always bothered me a little though..."

Ghosts,2ybinu,bluesidewinder,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"no. i can't talk to them. i see them. and sometimes i feel them, like mood etc. i can't ask them anything. trust me i have tried. but sometime they show me things. action. gestures. and sometimes weirdly they will loop and show me the same set of gestures over and over. i think after a certain amount of time they sort of wear out. or they at least become harder for me to perceive. i tend to see people dressed in modern clothes a LOT more often. i have seen a few ghost i thought were in clothes that had to be at least from the 1800's. one was a little girl that was near this spot down by a river where i used to park and just think. i would see her right by the bridge that marked the spot, and she would (what i call) hover (meaning just hang out really) just outside the car for a while, and then would grow more and more animated wanting me to follow her into the woods. i never did, because fuck that. but she was wearing night clothes from (what i assume) was the 1800's. complete with an olde tyme night cap that was much too big for her. i found the spot through a friend. she showed me one day, because there is a trail head there, and i sometimes hike. after going there to park for about 6 months or so, i decided to explore the area more one day. that is when i came across an amish community about a mile back in those wood, just off the trail head on it's own access road. so what i though were jammys from the olden days could actually have been the latest in amish style. so i try to take my guesses as to time period with a grain of salt. as for gods, like i have mentioned a few times i am not even sure he/she/it exists. let alone has anything to do with the ghosts i see. i tend to think of them more as... stains on the environment. maybe something in the electromagnetic spectrum? sort of like a vhs tape, just kind of burned, or recorded by the surrounding. i don't know, and i am just spit balling here, but that is my best guess from the things i have witnessed. others may tell you different things, or they may really even have had a VERY different phenomena happen to them that has caused them to say that i am very wrong to think this. to that i say, i must go by my own experiences. i know them to be as true as possible, because i collected the perceptions they are based on personally. i believe what i believe through experience. them i must take at their word. like i guess you guys must."

Depends on their awarenessabilty, they cant see, hear, feel, or touch the way we do... they can create their form that way, but only if they know how to use psionics to modify themselves... The Idea of ghosts is simple, The remant of a person. Most Pepole wonder how they can pull psionics from pretty much anywhere, that psionics mostly is the remnants of souls.

Tons of things I could de-bunk, but that 5% of evidence that leaves HUGE ""!!!!"" and ""?!?!"" always left me incredibly excited.  The Paranormal science is still in it's infancy. I don't think science has what it needs to start cracking through and instead just cover their eyes and go, ""la la la la, paranormal evidence isn't real, la la la la!"" Twenty years ago these assholes were telling us rogue waves weren't real. Seventy they told us black holes weren't real.  A real scientist looks at the evidence and says, ""We need more research into the paranormal.""  And real discoveries have come from paranormal research. We've learned people can be ultra sensitive from being around high power lines in their homes, so much that they can even start having psychosis from it."

It's not always residual. Many will give very clear answers to your questions, even describe you or say your name. So, I'm not discounting the holographic hypothesis, but it doesn't account for everything. For example, Ive asked to be given a tour of an asylum once (long gone, just a field now), and I got a very loud ""Show them"" response from right next to me, along with moving K2 hits.

Ghosts,2xx8aw,snowbirdie,-3,Thu Mar 5 06:55:36 2015 UTC,It's folklore/superstition. It never makes sense. It's based on irrational thought or old wives' tales. That's like asking why throw salt over your shoulder or why catching a bouquet at a wedding means you'll get married next. You need to be intelligent enough to understand what superstition is.
Ghosts,2xx8aw,tendorphin,8,Wed Mar 4 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"Minus the veiled insult, this is right. To elaborate, within that folklore, some believe that they can only ""get you"" under certain circumstances, and one of those is to look back at them while they're following you around; that is, at least, as it was explained to me."
Ghosts,2xx8aw,lumpydukeofspacenuts,7,Wed Mar 4 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"I think it can be interpreted symbolically, as well.  Ghosts are from the past, the past haunts many people, if you keep moving forward and ""don't look back"" then you can ""get away"" from things that haunt you."

Creepy artwork...yes...but it's artwork. You can tell because it has a clear, distinguishable background. It is masked by the object in front of it, and it's perspective is the same as the wall it's on. The other figure in the poster looks like a man in a flamboyant wig. I'm not going to deny it's creepy because it is...but it's not paranormal. It's a creepy ass poster."

Because it's a reflection with pareidolia, perhaps Day of the Dead skeleton stuff that always shows up in gift stores."

Ghosts,2xh52v,fmulder777,-7,Sun Mar 1 07:33:57 2015 UTC,"Story:   I grew up in Orlando, and as a teenager basically everyone worked at the theme parks. My brother's friend (high-schooler at the time) worked in the picture developing department of Islands of Adventure and one day found this anomaly when developing a photo. The photo is dated May 2003. They made a copy and gave it to us. We eventually moved and I lost the picture, and for 12 years I scoured the internet and my house to find it. The picture itself surfaced a few times on crappy geocities paranormal websites from another source, but all have since gone down. Anyway, I was talking to my mom about the picture this morning and she had recently found it in a stack of old photos! So now I give it to you. I have no idea who the kid is in the picture, or who's behind the grinch mask.   The Interpretation:  To me, these people are unmistakably dressed in period clothing. There is a man to the left in a hat, and a woman to his right. Behind them seems to be the facade of a house (old plantation style house?) and what seems to be a tree that extends up. The two parallel lines (#4 on the circled photos) to me could be some sort of double barreled gun.   The Argument:  This photo was taken outside a gift shop in Dr. Seuss Land. There wouldn't be anyone dressed in period clothing this way in that land, so I've ruled out that it's a reflection of people actually standing there. Similarly, 2003 Universal Studios (especially IOA) didn't have any civil war/colonial/period clothing themes. You can see colored reflections of real objects throughout the rest of the picture as well, making the ghostly reflections stand out.    Some of you might notice that the actual figures show up in this nice black square, making it seem like they were lazily copy/pasted onto the photo. In my opinion, I think that black box is a picture on the wall INSIDE the building, and because of it's dark color, the ghost reflections appear most vividly in front of it. If you look closely, you can see that some of the ghostly reflection extend outside this black box, ruling out that the figures are just a picture hanging on the wall inside the gift shop. Why would a Dr. Seuss shop have civil war era old time photos on the wall?   Anyway, I've waited 12 years to share this story and photo. Let me know what you think!"
Ghosts,2xh52v,Raxkor,-3,Sat Feb 28 17:41:49 2015 UTC,I see four ghosts. Good evidence. Where this was taken?

Ghosts,2xfo5t,zaturama008,6,Sat Feb 28 05:06:11 2015 UTC,"My guess is it was one of the crew who, according to the show, wasn't present, so when their shadow appeared, it was usable as paranormal footage. It matches the other shadows in darkness and clarity. IMO, not a ghost, just someone from this hoax of a show getting noticed accidentally."
Ghosts,2xfo5t,tendorphin,3,Sat Feb 28 11:48:48 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. It seems more important to these shows to have something shocking rather than genuine. There are a bunch of possible explanations for the shadow, but we have to go on their word. Yet nothing I've seen on most of these shows lead me to believe that Occam's Razor plays any part in their investigations."
Ghosts,2xfo5t,tendorphin,2,Sat Feb 28 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"It doesn't at all. I wish some independently wealthy group would do one of these shows, and that in the majority of the shows they found nothing. That would be genuine. I would watch that every time. They wouldn't replay the same clips 6 times in a row, they wouldn't recap the episode 12 times. They would just investigate and film."

Ghosts,2xfo5t,Lyratheflirt,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:17:20 2015 UTC,I don't know. The shadow has an odd morphing shape in the elbow that becomes to pronunciated to be normal.
Ghosts,2xfo5t,tendorphin,1 point,Tue Mar 3 11:24:28 2015 UTC,"But that could easily be explained by a suit he's wearing (perhaps a green body suit so he can be edited out), some other jacket, or even distance and angle from the source of light."
Ghosts,2xfo5t,Lyratheflirt,1 point,Tue Mar 3 12:13:21 2015 UTC,"Well the light source appears to be coming almost directly from the guys left. If the guy was far away the shadow would have likely went over the guy as well as it moved forward, the shadow size suggest that if it were a true shadow it would be close (although it's hard to tell since you can't really see were the exact light source is.) then he would have to be edited out on screen and there would be artifacts from removing him.  Also when you view the other camera angle, the guy's shadows is split (multiple light sources?) and very transparent, while the shadow figure is much more solid and sharp. On the other side of the argument, the axe shadow has pretty much the same but darker translucence as the shadow figure. It seems like closer object to the wall have darker shadows, implying that it is close to the wall and not the light source. Also you can maybe make out a shape in the actual doorway where there is no wall how that could just be my eyes playing tricks on me/video static.   I'm still on the fence about it though. I'm not quite sold it's a shadow figure, or a persons shadow.  It does look like it's a shadow and it's wrapping around the bumps of the wall."

First of all that is EXACTLY what I would do if I am to fake a ghost. I do believe in ghost but this video seems to scream fake fake fake to me.     The problem with computer technology today is it is ""TOO CLEAN"", so if I want to fake it and to make sure no special effect guy could detect it, all I need to do is ruin that chance once and for all by making sure that after all my hard work, I play it back on a screen and record it via a cell phone to allow the video noise of the cellphone to completely ruin any good chance for accurate analysis. Bottom line: If you want to Fake anything today, do your special effects, then play it back on screen and record using another device, repeat until quality is complete crap = REAL ! Great now people making fake UFOs is going to do this now :( If any of you have ghost image or videos that you need me to debunk, please let me know, it is healthy to have a respectful belief but the world is full of scammers."

Looking at what would be considered the left arm (viewers right), notice the black horizontal stripe on the upper arm that coincides with the horizontal wood frame, as well as the vertical black stripe (looks like a tie on the figure) that coincides with the vertical wood frame on the window, leading me to believe that whatever it is, it is behind the window, not a reflection that is on the window. Once again, as stated in my reply above, I could be completely wrong on this, but that is my argument for this being paranormal. I always welcome differing opinions, such as yours.

We were in OK filming a civil war reenactors group for footage to use in my documentary, War Wraiths (link in an earlier post). As we were leaving, one of my assistants stuck her camera out the window of the van, and just randomly snapped a couple of pictures. She wasn't even looking at what she was shooting, just point and click.  Later on, as she was looking at her pics, she noticed something weird in this photo. Look to the window directly to the left of the bricked up doorway. It might be best to download this pic, so you can blow it up on your screen, and let me  know what you see. Apologies for the size, not a very good camera to begin with, I'm thinking it was only 4-6 megapixels, at best."

I found some info on how glass was made which would help explain some of the imperfections you would see in these windows. "" Medieval glassblowers made two kinds of flat glass sheets. One technique was to blow a large cylinder. They then cut the cylinder open and flattened it out while it was still hot. The other flat glass sheet was called crown glass. They made it by spinning molten glass and letting it spread from a central point. Crown glass was the most common flat glass for a long time. It underwent considerable refinement. But, even as late as 1800, most domestic windows still displayed a characteristic umbilical imperfection called a crown at their centers."" http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1282.htm"
Ghosts,2x6uro,lordhellion,2,Thu Feb 26 03:26:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting facts on glass making. With the fort being established in 1874, I believe crown glass was not the glass used in these windows. I could be wrong on this point. What you can't see in the picture, but what is evident in the reflections on the glass, is the trees in front of the building. Looking at the top right windows, you can see a reflection of said tree that carries over multiple panes, that does not seem to distort between frames of glass, i.e., they line up to each other. That's why I initially ruled out glass distortion, but once again, I could be wrong."

Ghosts,2wuq7w,karlyb,5,Mon Feb 23 08:15:49 2015 UTC,"""Appear to be"" is the key, of course. I was very much into this in the past! Eventually, though, I kind of caught on ..with a lot of help. There is so much scientific evidence on the subject that it's really inarguable. And ""nah nah nah I can't hear you"" is not an argument. :)  The thing that needs to be understood first is how the brain processes audio input. It isn't straight ear-to-consciousness, as most people think. Instead, sounds come into your ear and are sent to the auditory cortex, where snap decisions are made as to the type of information that might be present in the sounds. Pieces of sounds are matched to the brain's own sound information base according to expectations (which are preloaded cues received by the auditory cortex from the parietal and prefrontal lobes). At this stage, your conscious mind hasn't even ""heard"" anything yet. Sound fragments are matched by expectation, and then what your auditory cortex thinks might be present is delivered to your frontal lobes for confirmation. Then, and only then, are you consciously aware of the sound and the information that your auditory cortex thought it might contain. As you would expect, then, what you hear tends to meet your expectations, because your auditory cortex has been told what to look for and lock onto before you ever ""hear"" the sound.  The TL;DR of audio pareidolia: It happens because the brain doesn't really process a whole group of sounds, determine they are words, match them with your brain's database, and then you hear those words consciously. That would be way too slow: A conversation would be over before you figured out what the first sentence said. Instead, your brain picks of a piece of a word, a phoneme, matches with its database according to context (expectation), and then delivers that product (a whole word or sentence) to your conscious mind.  With the Spirit Box, you're getting pieces of words from radio stations. That's the key element needed to trigger audio pareidolia. If you were getting a lot of whole words (scan the stations much more slowly) the context would be so clearly radio station traffic that your brain wouldn't be able to trick itself into getting special messages. But with just pieces of words, your auditory cortex can complete those phonemes into any word that works to satisfy the expectation of the conscious mind.  This pre-processing that the brain does is the reason we all have times when we could have sworn person A said X when they actually said Y. And we would swear up and down that they actually said the thing they didn't say - because that is what we really heard. We just heard wrong. They said what they said, our brain grabbed onto the wrong phoneme, or completed a phoneme into the wrong word, and we consciously heard the other person say something that they didn't say.  Audio pareidolia is also why you may think you hear the phone ring when you're in the shower (when it's not actually ringing) or why you might think you hear someone say your name in a conversation that turns out to not be about you at all. Your brain takes fragments of sounds, latches onto them based on a preconception of what meaning might be derived, then delivers the word(s) that it THINKS might be present to your conscious mind.  I empathize because I've been there and believed in this sort of thing until it was proven to be a brain function only. And people write abut this, but it keeps coming up because people don't (or more likely, just refuse to) understand audio pareidolia and how it works. I mean, this is something that is scientifically proven with repeatable laboratory results, so before anyone makes some other claim, they'd have to disprove the scientific research on the subject. Nobody does (or can) do that, so it comes back to, ""Doesn't matter, I believe it.""  DO IT YOURSELF TEST TO PROVE THIS: Videos are used to ""prove"" messages because the average viewer isn't going to have the same context expectations as the original person, so they won't ""hear"" the same messages - unless you caption the audio. Then  that visual trigger causes others to ""hear"" the message that the original person heard. And you can prove that for yourself, with no doubts at all, by testing this on other people's videos.  This is the test: Just listen to them without looking at them. Turn your head away from the screen. Write down any words you think you hear, and when you are done then and only then watch the video to see what happens. Unless the investigator also tells you what to hear in addition to the captions, you won't hear it.  It's a very interesting phenomena that gives some deep insight into how the human brain works. It's not anything paranormal, though, it's just brain science."
Ghosts,2wuq7w,shen-han,2,Mon Feb 23 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment! I agree with everything you have said here. I actually have a scientific background myself and am studying to become a veterinarian (just starting my clinical years now), and have studied neurology in some depth. I do agree that  pareidolia is something we can't rule out with the ghost box which makes it impossible to claim anything we capture is indeed paranormal. It's true at the end of the day you hear what your brain wants you to hear and this can differ from person to person.  To account for this I always try to get the opinion of other people, in a way that you have suggested - without putting ideas in their head. I typically ask them to listen to this recording and tell me what they think they hear. I follow the same approach for EVP analysis as I believe that can be more interesting than putting an idea in someone's head by saying this is what I hear.  At the end of the day I think the spirit box is a fun device and can give you the feeling that you are achieving real time communication. But we can never prove that is the case and most likely it is just pareidolia and matrixing. I always recommend that all sessions are recorded because you never hear anything that makes sense in real time and often you will notice that you may think you hear something but when you listen back to it it is obviously just a radio bleep or complete rubbish.  The faster sweep rate capability of the P-SB11 does eliminate radio interference in a sense that you won't get full sentences or words from any one station - keeping in mind that most stations exist over a number of frequencies. However in doing so you introduce the problem of stitching together bleeps and bits of speech from numerous sources and making something abstract meaningful.  I think to come away from any spirit box session believing 100% you have achieved communication is silly considering the more logical explanation. But this is where recording all sessions, sharing what you capture and communicating with others becomes important."
Ghosts,2wom88,GMUwhat1234,4,Sat Feb 21 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"Also as a word of caution, it might be illegal in your particular area to camp in a graveyard.  While I personally think it's a great idea, one must also factor in dealing with spirits, as well as dealing with the authorities."
Ghosts,2wom88,bpg131313,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:29:27 2015 UTC,True true. I'm just curious as to how they even manifest in a graveyard of all places. Aren't final resting places also usually sanctified in some way?
Ghosts,2wom88,bpg131313,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"The question you need to ask is whether or not sanctifying anything has any effect?  One could argue that it's a religious practice that isn't actually effective.  Shadow people manifest for a variety of reasons, in a variety of locations.  You have to remember that shadow people are shadow people because they don't have enough energy (or possibly experience) to manifest as a spirit one would recognize.  There's also a high degree of likelihood that most of the shadow figures out there are residuals and wouldn't interact, which is why most are found in structures where they once were as opposed to where the body is buried.  Guess you'll just have to experiment and come to your own conclusions."
Ghosts,2wom88,bpg131313,2,Sat Feb 21 21:41:37 2015 UTC,"I thought shadow people were demonic entities, hence why alot of ghost hunters choose not to interact with them directly as opposed to regular spirits"
Ghosts,2wom88,plasmafire,1 point,Sun Feb 22 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"From all I've read, and through discussions I've had, I've never seen a strong connection between shadow people and the demonic.  Those are two completely different animals.  Of course, I also must state for the record, that I've never come across one, so I've never been able to evaluate it myself.  Some confusion might occur when more than one kind of spirit may manifest as ""black"".  Non-human entities are not common, are certainly intelligent, and exhibit control over objects and mess with people.  The typical ""shadow person"" is just that, prior-human, unable to manifest entirely, and from what I've read, are unable to manipulate objects.  Most of them are just seen.  Even if you watch all of the episodes of Ghost Hunters where shadow people are captured, they don't really do anything aside from being seen.  Now that can be frightening, but I don't think I've seen an instance where they actually manipulated something.  Interestingly enough, other spirits do manipulate objects, but aren't shadow people.  That's why investigators will try to bring ""trigger objects"".  If they know they are at a site where little kids died, and are suspected of still being present, they'll bering toys and little balls for them to play with.  This is separate behavior from that of shadow people, or non-human entities."

Ghosts,2wkh2y,Sandthepilot,5,Fri Feb 20 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"The next experience unfortunately happened at the time of my floor managers death. This man, was the most pure hearted man. He was like an uncle to me. I knew him since I was six years old. He was a workaholic and ended up sleeping at the shop all the time since he'd always just be doing something. The guy couldn't relax for even an hour. He always needed something to do that is how he was. Never took vacation or breaks. So 2 weeks before he passed away he was acting very strange ended up transferring the title Of his car to his sister and some of his belongings he started taking to his gfs house and his sisters. The week he died he had a sinus infection and his gfs daughter called me and told me her mom got a text of him just saying her name so she was worried. So I picked up his gfs daughter and we headed to the shop to check up on him. We got there and I was banging on the door like 20 times while she was freaking out crying. He finally opened the door and was like what's up? I was like dude you worried us! He hugged his gfs daughter and he told us how he had a sinus infection so we said go see a doctor on Sunday. He said okay (he wasn't the type to go to the doctor). Anyway i hugged him and he said you're like a nephew to me and I want to thank you for always making me feel like part of the family. I said you are and always will be family. It was like he was saying bye but i didn't think of it that way. So Monday comes along and we all come to work and everything is shut off. Power etc. We think he must've forgot since he was sick . I knocked on his door no answer. We all called him and text him. No answer. So we picked the door with a credit card since we didn't have the key to the room. It actually worked! Open the door and we see him just laying there asleep. I was in such shock that it didn't hit me that he passed away until a day later. So for the next seven days things were normal until at night around the same time every night I got a phone call from the security company saying that the bay door is reading opened. So I go to the shop and see nothing. Bay door isn't open. We had the company come take a look and they found nothing that was faulty on the sensor or how the sensor is even going off. Only way it would go off is if it was lifted more than six inches. Happening every night for 7 Days at the same time. I believe it was him in a residual loop doing what he did before he passed away. It stopped after 7 days. Makes me believe in the whole our spirit stays for 7 days and then leaves."
Ghosts,2wkh2y,bpg131313,1 point,Fri Feb 20 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting story, but that also must make you wonder if you say your spirit only stays for 7 days, then that woman you saw in Paris had to have been there longer.  It was obviously only a residual haunt because she didn't actually interact with you or even say anything to you, but the ghost was not of this time period.    Personally, I think spirits stay around as long as they want to.  Some can't figure out how to move on and need help, but some stay just because they don't want to know what's coming next.  I have a Buddhist friend that says the light at the end of the tunnel you see when you die is actually the light in the delivery room of your next lifetime.  Interesting thought."

Ghosts,2w7pkq,theactualliz,2,Thu Feb 19 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. Ask for a thinner veil or last to see through your higher power's eyes. Also avoid things that create attachment to the physical plane. All drugs (including socially acceptable ones like caffeine and nicotine) block the flow of the light and make it harder to see these things. Of course sometimes drugs are necessary for medical reasons, so consult a doctor before stopping any prescriptions in the hopes of a better connection to the spirit world.   Food also binds one to the earthly plane. Obviously it's not a good idea to stop eating completely, but the more one eats, the more difficult it will be to see these things.   Sex is another thing that binds people to physical reality. All forms of sexual activity seem to do this. It is not enough to merely abstain. The goal is to remove the attachment / desire so that energy can be focused on other things.   ** None of this is intended as moral commentary. My only goal is to share observations on patterns of behavior that seem to make the veil thicker or thinner. A thinner veil is not necessarily good or bad. It is what it is and nothing more. Also, it's not like anybody can prove anything with this stuff. We cannot disprove more scientific explanations, so we must always remember they are at least a possibility. There is no way to prove I am right and that means I could easily be wrong."

Experiences seeded to spike after a death in the family and around the time of a birth in the family. These are probably bigger factors, but since my control over them is limited I figured they might not be of much help.   I also have this feeling the veil is thinning in general on a global scale. I think some groups might be handling this shift poorly and kinda freaking out.   It does seem to me that meditation is a pretty big variable that is under my control. Discussing these topics with others, reading and meditating to try to figure out what they might mean, praying to ask for guidance / answers....

You don't know what natural laws guide this sort of thing. I'm psyched for you though. That sounds like the beginning of a very fruitful investigation. Might not actually be a ""ghost"" if she's just watching; Sarah may be an angelic helper. Have you tried talking to her?  (Don't go around inviting random entities into your life, though. Trust your gut)"

I did talk at here but didn't perceive getting anything back. My cousin didn't answer anything for her either, the only thing he did say was ""she says in time we may talk"" (which isn't how he would normally speak) so who knows?    As for random entities, the ones I see / feel are never invited consciously.

My last experience was a couple of years ago when I woke up around 2 or 3 am and laid in bed trying to go back to sleep. I suddenly heard a man talking in the room but it was muffled, it sounded like he was under water. I couldn't make out anything he said but I remember smiling and thinking ""I absolutely believe in ghosts now and nothing will ever change that and that means my dad still exists"". I haven't had an experiences since then no matter how many times I pray for my dad to give me a sign.

Ghosts,2vxcck,BurnedShoes,2,Sun Feb 15 08:33:26 2015 UTC,"Carbon monoxide poisoning:       Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs after enough inhalation of carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas, but, being colorless, odorless, tasteless, and initially non-irritating, it is very difficult for people to detect. Carbon monoxide is a product of incomplete combustion of organic matter due to insufficient oxygen supply to enable complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). It is often produced in domestic or industrial settings by motor vehicles that run on gasoline, diesel, propane, methane, or other carbon-based fuels and tools, heaters, and cooking equipment that are powered by carbon-based fuels. Exposures at 100 ppm or greater can be dangerous to human health.

If these things are fucking with you at this level, like, not just being there and you find that scary, but deliberately being scary to mess with you, you are going to need to leave or un-Satanize the place.   Garlic, Bible study, reading the Bhagavad Gita out loud every night, learning Hebrew and reading from the Torah, holy water, getting a priest to bless the place, sage, meditation - I have no idea what will work, just try them all and hopefully some combination will work.  Attempt to love these beings - they thrive on fear and anger. From what I've read, love is too high a frequency and they can't feed off it, so it will drive them away. Love them and wish them well, but they can't stay with you and they need to get moving."

It was when we were going to leave and we were underneath the stairwell outside that I believe they've since taken down (can't remember) and the loudest ""thump, thump, thump"" came from the top of the stairwell and my friend was half way down the road when I looked up.   I immediately suspected (while running mind you) that someone was messing with us so the moment I heard it and began to run, I turned to inspect and there was literally nobody around. I stood on the street, inspecting and finally went back to look around trying to find any explanation and could only come up with two natural explanations.   One was that the tree that hovered over the stairwell dropped a branch, but there wasn't anything on the top of the stairwell.   The other, more plausible, theory was that someone was in the Whaley House still, like an employee and was able to step outside, thump a broom on the top the stairwell, and jump right back in and watch us run.   Either that or it was paranormal."

Ghosts,2v2g5r,AhrmiintheUnseen,1 point,Sat Feb 7 10:14:02 2015 UTC,"The former cemetery/current park that they reference in the Grant Humphrey's section is actually not terribly close to the mansion at all, and although I've been through the house and have heard the ghost stories, I would highly doubt that they've anything to do with Cheesman Park.  The mansion hosts a lot of weddings and the brides are given one of the second story bedrooms off of the main stairs to ready themselves - it's there that the presence of a man is often noted (and no, this man is not the groom or, worse yet, the best man).  I'm honestly surprised that they listed this one as Denver has some far creepier haunts.  For example, Croke Patterson Mansion http://www.meetup.com/colorado-ghost-hunters-group/pages/Haunted_History_of_the_Croke-Patterson_Mansion - I don't think you could pay me enough to stay there."
Ghosts,2utw3y,kittynh,6,Thu Feb 5 02:55:29 2015 UTC,To me it just looks like the one person moved during the photo being taken.
Ghosts,2utw3y,plasmafire,3,Thu Feb 5 05:29:18 2015 UTC,Ive heard that looks exactly as a pilot that died a week before that picture was taken. That's the mystery.

Ghosts,2utw3y,Fallenangel152,3,Thu Feb 5 11:17:55 2015 UTC,"That looks like a classic double-exposure to me. It looks like the same guy.   He moved, put on his hat, then held his pose for the rest of the exposure."

Ghosts,2utw3y,Annihilate_This,3,Thu Feb 5 11:02:07 2015 UTC,Photos took a long time to develop at the turn of the century. Someone could have stood there for a few seconds and then moved.
Ghosts,2utw3y,Fallenangel152,2,Thu Feb 5 11:19:33 2015 UTC,"Not just slowly, they had to pan. If you waited til the camera had panned in front of you then jumped down and ran to the other end of the photo, you could be in the same picture twice. School boys did it all the time.  I always thought this photo was something like this. Some chap cheekily sneaking in behind his buddy, hat in hand, before running off to his proper place in the photo and putting his hat on. Hat on, the apparition could be any of the guys in the picture."
Ghosts,2utw3y,riverstar,0,Thu Feb 5 19:34:19 2015 UTC,Still from no hat to hat without any other indication of moving is kinda suspicious.
Ghosts,2utw3y,Annihilate_This,2,Thu Feb 5 11:22:28 2015 UTC,The article suggests it could be a pilot stood inbetween two other who quickly got out of shot when he realised that he'd forgotten his hat.

Ghosts,2utw3y,Annihilate_This,4,Thu Feb 5 11:30:11 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you didn't read the full article. That is the text that is supplied with the photo at it's original source. No one called Freddy Jackson dying at the site can be found in any records, and only 1 person ever said it looked like him.   This is just conjecture—but it might be that out of the 80 or so folks in the shot one of them forgot to put on their hat. The photo is about to be taken—in fact the film begins to be exposed, but the poor fellow realizes he’s dropped or failed to don his cap. If he dropped it and bent to get it, perhaps by the time he stood again the exposure was up and all we are left with is a faint partial exposure of his face?"

Ghosts,2uklfp,iPirateGwar,3,Mon Feb 2 23:13:11 2015 UTC,Can you tell us about the experience when he was nine?
Ghosts,2uklfp,EmilyArwen,2,Tue Feb 3 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"Here you are - a cut & paste job from r/paranormal  When J was 9 he wanted to go to a bible group being run by our local Methodist minister. At that time he still believed in God even though my wife & I are confirmed agnostics. Fair enough - he needs to make up his own mind about whether he wants to believe or follow any religion.  I took him there and left him at the door - some of his friends were already there. About an hour later I got a call from the minister asking if I could come and see J - he sounded worried so I ran round there as fast as I could. He ushered me into the kitchen and showed me J who was spreadeagled up against a cabinet making moaning noises and a blank look on his face. The minister asked me to take him home because he was 'clearly possessed and speaking in tongues' and that he didn't want any 'demons in his house'. Apart from thinking that that wasn't a particularly Christian attitude, I picked up J and carried him home, put him on the sofa with a quilt over him and kept an eye on him while he slept. Next morning he was as fit as a fiddle but wouldn't answer our questions about what happened.  I really don't think he was possessed and I think it was one of three things:   he was arsing around. someone had put something in his juice. something else: when he was about 16 we discovered he had Gilbert's Syndrome, one of the symptoms of which is a loss of focus/concentration and an apparent fugue state. It could have been an early episode of that.   One good thing came of it though, after I had a go at the minister a few days later about his attitude and what he would have done if he couldn't contact me, I never had to talk to him again! Which is great because I never wanted to speak to the supercilious little prick again.  Edited for formatting going a bit wonky"

Ghosts,2uklfp,fauxchicken,2,Mon Feb 2 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe, maybe not. J has always been a little quiet since -almost like he lost a very good friend.  His younger brother has much more energy and enthusiasm but no weird episodes - apart from he flooded the house aged two.  Grrrr!"
Ghosts,2uip1k,lbraid88,3,Mon Feb 2 14:40:34 2015 UTC,"Oh God, I've had that happen - the someone running up the stairs outside your room and you're the only one home (or in this case my sister and I were the only ones home) and you look and no one is there. It's so unnerving!"
Ghosts,2uip1k,hollowmoon,3,Mon Feb 2 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"The house I lived in most of my childhood had this kind of shit happening all the time.  The stairs were down the centre of the house and I would often press my hands against each wall and swing my feet down to the bottom from a few steps up.  The house adjoining ours was lived in by our elderly neighbour and middle aged daughter. Sometimes the grandson would visit, but he used to play with my brothers, so if he was there, we'd know about it.  Often, I'd tell my mum that I'd heard heavy foot steps walk halfway down the stairs and stop, when I was home alone. This was absolutely terrifying and I remember the first time I heard it, I was about 13 and had stayed home sick rather than going to visit my Nan. The Smash Hits Poll Winners Party was on. I heard these footsteps and was so scared I hid my head under my blanket and didn't come out until everyone else got home.  My mother never believed me, although she used to hear foot steps walking across her bedroom while she was in there, coming from a corner where there was never any door. We'd all hear them from downstairs at other times, too.  Then, one night at 2 am,  she was still up and heard someone walk halfway down the stairs. She assumed it was me swinging down and going into the bathroom opposite the living room, but when she hadn't heard me go back up a few minutes later, went to investigate and found the bathroom unlocked and the light off. I'd never have walked around in the dark, so, spooked, she ran upstairs and turned the landing light on outside my room - only for the light to blow.  All I knew about it was my mum bending over my bed, saying,  ""Rosie, it's mum - it's dark and the lights have gone and I heard someone come down stairs!""  She made me sleep in her bed, that night.   Vindicated!"

Ghosts,2te52e,jango82,2,Fri Jan 23 10:41:00 2015 UTC,"I had a weird incident that is related to Savannah.  I had to attend a conference in Savannah for work.  The day before I was set to leave, I had stopped in my usual coffee shop on my way to work.  I live in a northern rust belt area and it's not very common to run into non blue collar types.  Well on this particular day, there was a woman dressed in what I can only describe as Voodoo garb standing at the front of the shop.  She took one look at me when I walked in the door and said in a very thick Jamaican accent ""Ooooooo somethin's gonna get chu honey.""  Fast forward to Savannah...I was walking back from dinner and it was starting to get dark and a minivan pulled up next to me full of a mom, dad and kids.  The ""Mom"" says to me, ""Let us give you a ride.""  I'm thinking, huh?  Well then she whispers that they noticed someone suspicious following me and was afraid that I would get mugged.  So that's the first and last time I've accepted a ride from strangers, but I took the gamble!"

Ghosts,2te52e,lovegreen42,2,Mon Feb 9 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"I had something weird happen one time with a camera when I was in college. I used to share a dorm room with my friend and it was just a single room, so no bathrooms or anything that someone could hide in. I had just gotten a really nice digital camera for my birthday and only had a couple pictures on it when something weird happened. There was one morning when we woke up and I wanted to look through my camera to see the pictures from the night before at our friend's house. We hadn't had anything to drink that night and the camera was with me the entire time. When I went to grab it in the morning, the camera was right on my desk where I had left it. Our windows had been closed and locked and the door to our room had been locked all night, so there was no way that anyone had been in our room. When I turned on my camera I noticed that a few more pictures had been taken throughout the night in our room. One of them was of my roommate sleeping and it looked like it had been taken from the ceiling. It was high up and over her head so there's no way she took that picture. Whoever took it would have had to be standing on her pillow behind her head and would have had to be a good 8-10 feet tall. Another was of me sleeping and it looked like it had been taken from high up again. There was also one that was a closeup of my friends face. It was so creepy and neither of us ever wanted to sleep in that room alone."

We deleted them since we wanted to kind of just block the whole thing out. That room was really creepy though. That's definitely the weirdest thing that happened there, but those dorms were pretty old so a lot of other little things happened from time to time. My ipod docking station used to just randomly turn on and off at night a lot and would always be turned up to the highest volume when it happened, even though I never turned it up that loud.

Suspicious that the camera was pointed down for a long enough time for someone to have left that bathroom and gone into the other room next to it. The cameraman yelling for his friend would have been enough to cover the noise of the door closing.    Of course, I wasn't there, but with a healthy dose of skepticism, there's just too much wrong with this video to make it real.   That being said, I would love to see something a bit more convincing. Videos like these are everywhere, doors rattling, chairs moving, etc, all of these types of things are so easily faked.

However I think its entirely possible for someone to have remained behind the door and hidden. It's also hard to tell if there is a bathtub or shower in that bathroom from that angle. Someone could have been shaking the door and then hopped into the tub and remained out of view while the friend ""investigated."" It looked like the bathroom window was open, and its possible for wind to shake the door like that by blowing past the window and rapidly changing the air pressure in the room. I've seen that before in my own house."

Now you've learned how dangerous it is to screw with things you know nothing about. It is one thing to read about this stuff but another altogether to try and contact it. Unfortunately you've had to learn the hard way, but I am sure you have learned your lesson about why ouija boards, even the homemade kind, are not just toys. You may ask for a peaceful spirit but that doesn't mean you'll get out. Ouija boards open a door for just about anything to come through. You may have just encountered something that wanted to mess with you for giggles, or you may have brought forth something more sinister. There is no way of knowing unless or until things escalate.   Unless you experience further phenomena such as knocking, footsteps, sensation of being watched, seeing things from the corner of your eye, cold spots, etc, do not worry about it. If you do start to experience strange phenomena, come back here and we will see what we can do about helping you."

Then, midway through the church service, the same foul psychically-projected odor assaulted the Warrens' senses. Once again, as they were returning home in the car, they were nauseated by a disgusting stench. Ed and Lorraine, however, did not associate it with the demonic case they were about to investigate that afternoon.""  ...

My only example from memory is the picture of the boy in the Amityville house that was sold as evidence of the ghost of one of the children killed there...

Here, though, the girl's hand is under the table right next to her.  1.18 - The table and chairs sliding isn't too convincing. The camera angle doesn't show any of the legs so it can't be said there's no rope or anything pulling the furniture.  1.54 - This is the bit that gets me. Watch the girl's ankles, especially from 2,08. When the chair slides back her ankles are completely rigid and don't move with the juddering of the chair. After it slides back at 2.08 her ankles are completely rigid but then, if you watch, they relax and her heels lower. Then, a second later, she tightens her leg muscles again, her heels raise and, surprise, the chair pushes back again. She's obviously sliding that chair back.  2.35 - Oh, come on!

It can potentially be extremely exciting and rewarding, though about 98% of he time, it's painfully boring. It's the other 2% that will keep you going.   I began researching in 1986. Back then, ""ghost busting"" was virtually unheard of. This was well before TAPS or the GAC. There were only a handful of us doing this at the time. It's come a long way since then, though there really hasn't been much progress in methodology. We have a lot more gear now, but still have yet to capture a single bit of definitive, indisputable evidence.  Be prepared for a lot of ridicule, and people slamming every bit of evidence you capture. It's unavoidable. No matter how good it is, there will always be someone who will tell you that it's fabricated or misidentified. Most evidence will only be evidence to you, because you were the one who captured it, and you're the only one who knows that it's legitimate. Never attempt to convert a non-believer into a believer. It's just not possible."

I've read (and seen) accounts where the evidence occurred when the recording devices were off, but everyone present heard it or saw it (whatever 'it' may be). I understand the the entities do not wait for you to turn on the device for them to make contact. However with the availability of go pro's and sound recording devices that can be left long term at locations, why is it that this is not done when investigating? leaving a group of cameras with large hard drives for a span of a week with regular visits to try and lure a reaction would seem the best way to capture something with concrete evidence."
Ghosts,2s1bla,Jack_Shid,2,Mon Jan 12 05:29:29 2015 UTC,"would seem the best way to capture something with concrete evidence.   Well, first, we would have to determine exactly what concrete evidence would be. In today's world of video/audio/photo editing software, there is not a photo or recording out there that someone wouldn't claim is fabricated.   For what it's worth, I do leave recording devices in empty locations for extended periods, and I do capture evidence that way. Again though, I cannot present it to anyone who hasn't worked with me, or doesn't know my techniques or methods or credibility, because I cannot prove to them that what I've captured is actually real and not fabricated."
Ghosts,2s1bla,beltran63,1 point,Mon Jan 12 13:01:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks you for answering my question. My question was more geared to the 24 hour surveillance type thing. I'm glad to hear that you do implement these type of techniques. It was something that always bugged me when I hear stories about paranormal investigations. That everything seems to happen just off camera or happen when the recording devices weren't on.  As to concrete evidence, I was more referring to capturing something that convinces you. An image or audio that you can capture that really comes through clearly. Skeptics and deniers will always try to shoot evidence down regardless of the facts. I'd be curious to see what kind of evidence you've been able to capture. Keep up the good work, I always get really interested in paranormal investigations."

The second thing that happened is when my mom introduced herself, Lorraine repeated my mother's name but then said the nickname that my mother's deceased father used to call her.

There are also several cloud-like orbs in the middle lower portion of the picture just below and to the lower right of the casket. The pictures taken with this camera did not display unusual light phenomenon save for those taken at the funeral."

Ghosts,2r1xpr,Donner1701,4,Sat Jan 3 23:37:43 2015 UTC,Those are light artifacts created from reflections off the surface of the casket.
Ghosts,2r1xpr,foobastion,2,Fri Jan 2 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"I am not convinced it's from the casket. The casket has a satin finish rather than a gloss or chrome. That type of finish diffuses the light rather than makes a hard reflection. There are other candidates in this picture, like the chrome toolbox or the fire engine. Neither of which, IMO, is reflecting significant amount of light to cause this. Anomaly, yes probably, from the light off of the casket, probably not."
Ghosts,2r1xpr,Donner1701,-1,Fri Jan 2 06:20:19 2015 UTC,"It doesn't necessarily have to be a mirror polish to reflect light. The casket is a candidate because it does have a finish on it. Not saying that you're wrong, I just don't think the casket should be written out immediately."
Ghosts,2r1xpr,plasmafire,3,Fri Jan 2 17:07:52 2015 UTC,Might be kinda difficult to tell the angle of the sun in this picture. Could also be a dirty lens.
Ghosts,2r1xpr,Donner1701,0,Fri Jan 2 02:03:46 2015 UTC,Look at the shadows.  The sun is shining downward which would reflect light off the corners of the casket onto the lens.
Ghosts,2r1xpr,Dan_Droid,2,Fri Jan 2 04:59:58 2015 UTC,"Unlikely given the other pictures. Look closely at the light which moves up to the right and back to the left. That flips from white to black and back to white. Light does not reflect like that. Additionally, those lights are not congruous with how light reflects. I see your answer dismissive at best."
Ghosts,2r1xpr,ihearthiking,6,Fri Jan 2 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"Unlikely given the other pictures.   So you think that it is more likely that it's a ghost?  If I were to guess, I'd say that you have greasy smears on your camera's lens.   EDIT: I'm very sorry for your loss. I've lost my father as well, it's not an easy thing to go through."
Ghosts,2r1xpr,Donner1701,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:28:31 2015 UTC,"Unless there is oil (from skin) on the lens.  Oil can make color changes like you're describing.    If you have a large lens (normal camera size) it can be easier to tell if there is smudging, but still not 100% detectable by the naked eye.  If you have a camera phone/ smaller or compact camera, it can be damn near impossible to tell.  All it takes is one brush with your finger tip combined with the right angle of a natural glare, and it can make things look similar to the photo.    Again, it has to combine the smudge with the glare of the reflection.  So that explains why it was only in one photo.    I am sorry for your loss."

It happened maybe 10 times. I've also had it when I have been awake and it's just a feeling of you have to get out of here now and just pure fear.   It doesn't happen anymore the last time was maybe 10 years ago. But yeah that feeling is frightening.

There's no real ventilation and the rooms either has a bathroom with shower with no tub (you shower with the drain installed on the floor with the toilet and sink next to you. Or you you use the community toilet and shower. Anyway, i slept fine but my girl at the time didn't sleep at all for some reason.

From your drawing, it kind of looks like the boys are maybe on the floor at the edge of an ""L"" shaped sofa?  And the blanket/jacket/whatever is folded or bunched near the end of the sofa.  Theoretically, someone could be under the bunched up blanket and popped up quick, holding it, creating the illusion you see.  Either on purpose or accidentally.

Ghosts,2qg0m6,magol1,10,Fri Dec 26 13:36:32 2014 UTC,"A lot of what you're describing is most likely caused by something called sleep paralysis.  It's normal but unbelievably terrifying to experience.  As for your titular question, the answer is complicated.  The majority of things posted in subs like this are debunked because many users here actually do believe in the paranormal and it is because of this belief that they want obvious fakery to be exposed as such.  Whether you believe in the paranormal or not, it's always best to explain weird occurrences with the most likely explanation, and in your case, I think sleep paralysis is more likely than the supernatural."
Ghosts,2qg0m6,Jacques_Cormery,4,Fri Dec 26 15:48:05 2014 UTC,"Sleep paralysis is a widespread condition.  I haven't met anyone who hasn't experienced it.  Plus with the modern surge in popularity of devices that include a camera and microphone, many of them with very high pixel resolution and camcorders that can record in low light conditions, it's becoming increasingly suspicious that very few cameras have captured anything beyond an easy explaination.    That being said, it's not outside the realm of possibility for supernatural phenomena to exist, there's just virtually no evidence for it.  There are also a plethora of reasons someone might experience something that isn't real, from mental disorders to substance abuse or accidental intoxication due to food toxicity or other, more dagerous reason like carbon monoxide poisoning.  Youtube and other shared video sites are the most likely sources for evidence of the paranormal and there are virtually no videos that show obvious supernatural evidence.  There are a few strange ones that (for now) seem anomalous and mysterious, so again, it's within the realm of mathematical possibility but it's growing increasingly unlikely."
Ghosts,2qg0m6,alsorobots,2,Fri Dec 26 15:57:28 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  I've never experienced anything in my life that would lead me to believe in the supernatural nor seen credible evidence that cannot be better explained in mundane terms.  But I still find the subject matter fascinating, and I find the feedback from skeptical-minded believers to be very engaging.  That's why I remain subbed here and in places like /r/paranormal."
Ghosts,2qg0m6,Jacques_Cormery,3,Fri Dec 26 16:26:33 2014 UTC,"I actually HOPE that something conclusive gets captured.  However, if it did, expect that to be the next big thing economically.  We'd see ""ghostbusters"" popping up on every medium, from internet ads to late night television and billboards.  That's kind of a down side because even if someone snaps a photo or takes a video that's absolutely 100% confirmed by scientists to be conclusive proof of the afterlife or something else paranormal, fraud is going to be the number one bad side-effect of such a discovery.  I can picture fraudsters claiming they have the ability to remove the ghosts or whatever happens to be occuring in people's homes or businesses, but the real danger wouldn't just be charlaitans charging people for exorcisms or ghost cleanings, the real danger would be the sudden and explosive reaction by the big three world religions.  Islam would go nuts with riots in the middle east.  People would be fighting to secure the ""official"" path to the after-life like never before.  Heck, we might even see a few brand new major religions pop up."

Ghosts,2qg0m6,smilesbot,3,Fri Dec 26 16:48:24 2014 UTC,"Yes this, sleep paralysis itself is a lucid dream, once your fear takes hold, your imagination takes advantage of you and puts you in the worst case scenario. I've played with it hundreds of times over the year. Its like survival with our ancestors through our dna, how they had to survive in the WILD life, its there so we can act it out and survive.  1 thing I notice if you disregard fear, it appears as a normal dream, you can act out your dream normally to whatever creativity you want it to be. If you have emotions like fear/hate/negativity/anger, this will follow you in this ""dream state"" of sleep paralysis in combination of your fears either be ""religion hell/demons"" or aliens or whatever you might of picked up from somewhere. Its like a bad dream for example, same thing; but with a BAD dream, you are allowed to escape, while with sleep paralysis, you are paralyzed. But you can actually break free of it easily and continue to act out this nightmare and take control of it. You have soooo much power under this state, most people dont realize it, you can fly around and shoot lazers[pew pew] at these demons, punch them through the walls if you wanted too :)"
Ghosts,2qg0m6,lost-cat,2,Sat Dec 27 11:19:37 2014 UTC,"Sleep paralysis:       Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon in which a person, either falling asleep or awakening, temporarily experiences an inability to move, speak or react. It is a transitional state between wakefulness and sleep characterized by complete muscle atonia (muscle weakness). It is often accompanied by terrifying hallucinations (such as an intruder in the room) to which one is unable to react due to paralysis, and physical experiences (such as strong current running through the upper body). One hypothesis is that it results from disrupted REM sleep, which normally induces complete muscle atonia to prevent sleepers from acting out their dreams. Sleep paralysis has been linked to disorders such as narcolepsy, migraines, anxiety disorders, and obstructive sleep apnea; however, it can also occur in isolation.      Image i - The Nightmare, by Henry Fuseli (1781) is thought to be one of the classic depictions of sleep paralysis perceived as a demonic visitation.

Ghosts,2pnib1,waffle247,3,Thu Dec 18 16:29:28 2014 UTC,"You'd be right. For the most part the general public stopped believing this stuff decades ago but there is enough of a market of idiots & vulnerable people out their (arguably sometimes one & the same thing) that unethical folk can abuse their situation through trickery. Now I'm a huge fan of haunted house experiences & the like but when they start saying ""I can contact your dead loved ones"" that's the line between a bit of harmless fun & a serious felony."
Ghosts,2pnib1,snowbirdie,2,Thu Dec 18 16:34:44 2014 UTC,same here! haunted house: good; contacting the dead: bad!  i understand the desire to want to contact loved ones though. i work in hospice and my job is to literally sit with the dying (i have watched many pass right in front of me) and if you're not comfortable with the idea that your loved one has passed you're going to want to still be near them.
Ghosts,2pnib1,sg92i,2,Thu Dec 18 17:16:36 2014 UTC,"Most people who believe in the paranormal WANT to find evidence and will find it regardless if it's real or not. It's an education problem ; most folks lack basic knowledge of physics, psychology, photography, etc. to understand what's really happening. It's also a mental disorder much like how people think God cures their family member of the flu, but lets millions of die of other diseases/starve to death.  People will turn anything into supporting their personal beliefs because it is comforting and reality is too scary for them to live in."
Ghosts,2pnib1,waffle247,2,Thu Dec 18 17:37:36 2014 UTC,"I am a radio & paranormal enthusiast so I might be able to give you some good information here.  A ghost/spirit box is a radio circuit that scans a radio band at a constant rate in such a way that it is impossible for it to normally produce a word or sentence regardless what the radio stations in your area happen to be producing at any given moment. The idea is, since the circuit is changing freq so fast any word or sentence it makes must be the result of something paranormal.  Normally a radio with a scan feature is designed to move in one direction until it finds a station & then it will ""park"" the tuner over that freq. This is how the radio in your car probably works. On some radios you can use brute force to keep that scan button pushed in, forcing it to keep scanning. The problem is this does not meet the design requirements of a ""spirit box"" because the radio is still going to pause on any station it finds before it goes to the next one. Those pauses would allow you to hear a word that is being broadcast by a station in your area, which is what you're trying to avoid.  So a spirit box is designed so that the tuner does not ""pause"" while seeking. They may have other features like a way of adjusting the scan-speed & scan-direction.  Since the scan-speed is constant, if you know what that scan-rate is you can calculate how many frequencies the radio attempted to play during the word or sentence you hear & suspect of being paranormal.  The problem is that a powerful transmission is likely to be received at many different freq settings. Technically the FCC establishes rules & regulations on how much bandwidth [that's signal width] a station can produce, but not everyone is in compliance and not every tuner design is good. Next time you use an analog AM radio find the most powerful station on your dial. Now tune the dial slowly in each direction and you will see that the ""width"" of the signal could be wide enough to allow you to hear up to a few words if the radio were to scan over those freq at a specific rate. So to prove whether something you hear from a spirit box is paranormal the first thing you'll need to do is make sure it is not simply playing something that a local radio station is producing at that very minute.  One way to do this would be to have other identical radios setup to receive & record every station in your area so that you can compare it to what your spirit-box says. If the spirit box says ""My name is Julie"" and none of the stations in your area said any of those words at that time, then that is your first indication that what you found could maybe be paranormal.  The next problem you need to overcome is RF interference. In theory, someone could mimic the human voice by creating interference that your spirit box receiver would pick up no matter what frequency it is on. Have you ever seen a spark-transmitter in use? The first radio transmitters worked by using an electrical-mechanical motor-generator to produce sparks, which would be controlled by a telegraph key. Using the key you can control when the sparks happen, how long they last for, and even what they sound like. This would allow you to broadcast morsecode. But, spark transmitters are notoriously bad in terms of trying to control the signal width which is why they are not used anymore. If someone was good enough at creating interference using something like a spark transmitter, they might be able to make you think a voice was said when really it was just RF interference. Even if no one is intentionally trying to mislead you, your brain has this feature called matrixing where it tries to find words & faces where there aren't any. There is so much RF interference out there today due to switching power supplies, cheap CFL bulbs, noisy electrical motors, and all kinds of poorly-shielded modern electronics that there is a chance, however remote, that what you're hearing is just white-noise that your brain is trying to recognize as words.  Now lets suppose for argument's shake that ghosts exist and can be communicated with. If you can convince a spirit to walk into a room that has a Faraday shield around it, and after that you manage to get a logical response(s) on a spirit box, then that goes further to validate your hypothesis that ghosts exist & can be communicated with. As  far as I know no one has accomplished this however many radio experimenters from the first half of the 20th century were interested in paranormal investigations and tried to accomplish this.  The following radio pioneers were all involved in paranormal experimentation:  Jagadish Bose - Recognized by the IEEE as one of the founders of radio, was interested in plant ESP  William Crookes - instrumental in the development of cathode ray tubes, member of the SPR  Thomas Edison - Self explanatory, claimed to have tried to build an electrical device to communicate with ""ghosts""  John Hammond Jr - The father of ""radio control"", was interested in paranormal research involving EMF & EVPs [although this 2nd term was not coined yet]. Attempted to get electronic communication with spirits inside Faraday shields, among other things.  Semyon Kirlian - Electrical researcher, the Kirlian Camera is named after him  Oliver Lodge - Marconi contemporary, member of the SPR  *Telsa* may or may not have been appropriate for going on this list but no one really knows what he was doing in seclusion, and his penthouse fire took out most of the records that would be used for saying one way or another."
Ghosts,2pnib1,shen-han,1 point,Thu Dec 18 23:51:42 2014 UTC,"Nice explanation except you've totally ignored that it's possible to broadcast on all wide band frequencies. Since you know your kit I'd suspect you know full well it's possible to hear something, scan through a radio station transmissions range & you will hear the whole broadcast as long as you stay within that range. Therefore your mate can do exactly the same thing broadcasting short-range wide band frequencies, you scan through them & you hear whatever was broadcast. Why anyone would think ghosts transmit radio frequencies is beyond me to explain."
Ghosts,2pnib1,sg92i,3,Fri Dec 19 09:43:35 2014 UTC,"I think everyone is overthinking this. Scanning radio stations, what you will get are parts of words from people speaking and from songs. Thanks to the well-known and proven phenomenon of audio pareidolia, we know that your brain needs only a part of a word - a phoneme - to lock on to and deliver a whole word to your conscious mind. And this process of turning parts of words into whole words happens at the subconscious level, so you'll never realize what just happened. This is what the Spirit Box does. It triggers audio pareidolia. That's all."
Ghosts,2pnib1,waffle247,1 point,Sun Jan 4 18:39:04 2015 UTC,"except you've totally ignored that it's possible to broadcast on all wide band frequencies   No, that's one of the reasons why I mentioned spark transmitters to show that it is possible to generate emissions so wide that you can receive them at [practically speaking] any freq. Maybe I could have explained that part better. This is also why you want to find this kind of data inside a Faraday shield, since the shielding would make it impossible for anyone to contaminate your findings [whether they are doing it intentionally or not].   Why anyone would think ghosts transmit radio frequencies is beyond me to explain   I don't know if anyone has proposed what the mechanism is behind how it works. Same goes for EVPs. People know they are getting data that sounds to them like coherient responses. But to prove that they come from ghosts or to prove how they are being produced, the next step would be to somehow convince a ""ghost"" to go with you into a Faraday shield and duplicate the data there.  The reason for the Faraday shield is to prove that whatever sound you get, is not being generated by someone intentionally, or being generated coincidentally by whatever is going on in the ether at that point in time. That is to say, you need to know that what you are hearing is not some strange combination of random radio station signals [aka not paranormal]; also that it is not some strange combination of white noise that by chance sounds like a voice.  So that's where the science of this rests: waiting for someone to prove a spirit box or EVP can work inside a Faraday shield. After that is accomplished then we can worry about what the mechanism is behind these occurrences.  If you have any other questions or criticisms I will try to answer them."
Ghosts,2pnib1,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Dec 19 17:49:59 2014 UTC,"Even inside a Faraday shield how would it account for random convergences of static? This is gibberish, the radios work but there is 0 evidence to support the idea that ghosts have any effect or transmit any kind of radio signals at all. Besides which there is no correlation between radio transmissions & haunted houses, other than so called ""ghost hunters"" publish - amazingly enough when real scientists turn up it turns out the results can't be reproduced. To paraphrase Sheldon Cooper spirit box ain't nothing but hokum."

Ghosts,2pk6i9,greeneyed_raven,0,Sat Jan 3 00:30:01 2015 UTC,Can you give some examples from what you've experienced?
Ghosts,2pk6i9,WolfofAnarchy,2,Tue Jan 6 18:37:19 2015 UTC,"alright, well about 5 years ago, during october I was living in a house with a friend and her family. I was sitting in the living room with her mother, we were talking and drinking coffee. my friend was sleeping in her room and the rest of the household was out of the house. very randomly while we were talking we heard a knock at the door 3 times in a  row, very loud very clear 1,2,3. there was a slight pause between each knock and we both stopped talking and looked at each other. I peeked out the blinds of the window and she walked to get the door. no one was there at all. and we had nothing hanging on the door the wind could have shook. It was odd but we just shrugged it off. however during the day later on while everyone was home it happened again. it was loud and I could hear it from the basement. tree knocks just like before. her sister answered the door this time and once again, no one was there. My friend's mom was a strong believer in the superstitious stuff and was worried. I figured it was just kids playing games.  then late that night we were all in bed and were woken up again three knocks. that week I got a call from my dad telling me my step mom was dying unexpectedly from a rare illness and I went to the hospital to see her the next day, she died hours after I left the hospital. 2 weeks later my friends mom gets a call from her brother letting her know her sister passed away who was ill with cancer. and about a week after that I got another call from my mother telling me my grandma was dying, she also had been battling cancer. I went to the hospital and she died while I was in the room with her.   this wasn't the last time this happened. It happened again a few months later at the same house though after I moved out. they lost a cousin, a aunt and a uncle. knocks on the door the very same way."

People die all the time. You're searching for correlations like an uneducated person. ""Oh hey! My cat knocked over a glass that broke - three weeks later, my aunt died, must be paranormal!""

These stories don't have to mean anything, they're just like ""hey, this happened, it was kind of weird, or interesting, or creepy,"" and other people listen and say ""oh that is interesting or weird or creepy,"" its just kind of what humans do.  It would be kind of like if I mentioned how on December 24th, a package got delivered and I heard sleigh bells ringing, people might smile and say oh ""Oh hey, sounds like Santa Claus,"" it not saying ""SEE! SANTA IS REAL!""  You act like anyone who has a weird or off beat story has never taken a class in statistics, logic, math, or science.  What a miserable, lonely, sad little man you must be. You know maybe that's the other reason people like stories about ghosts and Santa Claus, it gives them an escape from reality where they have to deal with people like you on a daily basis. That's probably a little harsh too."

Unless and until any form of evidence can be scientifically proven, I can't believe it. And I'm not holding out hope of that happening in my life, so I don't think I will find that answer for myself until my death."

Ghosts,2p4xiv,Jack_Shid,2,Sat Dec 13 22:57:53 2014 UTC,"I hope someone has input that makes sense. I had no flashlight. It was daytime. There is a noise that coincides with the movement. I didn't see it with my naked eye. I was alone. No one else was checked into the hotel except me and my boyfriend at that time. My boyfriend was in our room down at other end of hallway. I recorded it with my phone. I am not moving to the left yet(you can see that with the direction of the camera) when it moves across the screen. I went down to the room and got my boyfriend to bring him to the spot, so he could see if there was lighting... or a reason for it that I wasn't seeing. We could come up with nothing. I tried to video again from the same location several times to see if it would happen again...but it did not. Maybe it is a fluke in the camera. Maybe it is just something that can't be explained."

Ghosts,2oplih,D3ath5cyth3,11,Tue Dec 9 02:02:17 2014 UTC,"I'll keep this story rolling thanks for reading guys   After that weekend at my girlfriends house I tell her about the occurrence that I had down stairs and she was really interested. This threw me off guard but I kept going, telling her about the woman in white and the footsteps down the stairs. She admits that she has heard footsteps go up the stairs all the time when everyone is asleep in her house but she has never actually seen or felt the woman in white.   The next time I go to her house and spend the night I must admit I was a little worried about what would happen as I still wasn't allowed to sleep upstairs. This time however, her parents surprise me and bring down an extra twin sized mattress they don't use anymore that I can sleep on. Being tall, sleeping on a small couch was very uncomfortable and I gladly accepted their offer.   After the movie we go back home and hang out downstairs till midnight and then she goes back upstairs to her room. Before going to her room she tells me I can text her if anything starts to happen. About 10 minutes after she heads up stairs I get that feeling again as if someone is watching me and I instantly start to get cold sweats. The feeling this time is overwhelming as if someone is standing directly over me as I lay on this mattress in the middle of the room. I keep my eyes closed afraid of opening and seeing something that would make me run out of the house. I keep my eyes closed until I feel something start twirling my hair. At this time I grew out my hair with a mop top and was a coupe inches long but it felt as if someone was twirling my hair with one of their fingers.   I shoot straight up and look around but there was no one there. My nightly ritual of closing the curtains before I fell asleep assured me that no one was peering in to the house from the windows, so I looked around towards the stairs. I heard the creaking as if someone was coming down them and my heart raced. Someone was coming down the freaking stairs. I convinced myself it was the woman in white coming to show herself to me again, but it was my girlfriend. She was checking up on me after she heard me rustling around.   Just to clarify, you can hear every single movement in her house at night. Its a pretty small two store house and anyone walking or moving around can be heard from downstairs and upstairs without really concentrating.   She comes down and checks on me and I let her know that there was something playing with my hair as I was sleeping. She says she never has experienced this but on occasion \ at night she can hear a little girl talking at the top of the stairs. I was wondering if this is the footsteps I have been hearing the whole time I was sleeping downstairs. She comforts me for about ten minutes and then heads back up stairs.   I try to fall back asleep but every time I try to something starts playing with my hair which freaks me out. This keeps happening to me until I pass out of exhaustion. The next day we go out to lunch have a normal day and then night falls. I start getting worried because I know whats to come when the lights are turned off and her whole family is upstairs. I go through my nightly ritual of closing the curtains and then I lay on the mattress. I wait about five minutes and that all too familiar feeling hits me again. Im not alone in the room. But this time its a heavier presence, almost like there are more spirits presence or one really evil spirit.   They start playing with my hair and making noises going down the stairs. My heart starts racing and I get really uneasy in the make shift bed when all of a sudden my mattress starts to move back and forth by my feet. This happens for about 10 seconds until I leap off the mattress and run upstarts o my girlfriends room. I know I made a lot of noise because I woke up her brother who was a heavy sleeper. I woke her up and tell her whats going on. She tells me that I can stay in her room as long as I sleep on the floor and leave before her parents wake up and see me. So I run downstairs and trap the comforter and come back up and pass out on her floor.   The next morning I wake up and her dad walks past her room and sees that I am passed out on her floor. I woke up because I heard footsteps and had the misfortune of lying to her dad telling him that her daughter was crying the previous night and requested that I kept her company until she fell asleep and I happened to fall asleep before being able to go back downstairs. Her father was cool about it and told me to get downstairs before his wife saw me, so I tip toe downstairs and pass out on the mattress now stressing out about what her dad must be thinking.   I am about half way through this story guys, it gets more in depth on the next part and a little complicated but if you guys like it so far I can keep going."

Ghosts,2oplih,havok489,6,Thu Dec 11 12:52:05 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the delay guys here is the rest.  After that night I felt uneasy the whole next day. What happened the previous night really unnerved me. Before that night I didn't think that ghosts/ spirits were real and what happened was between me and my girlfriend and no one else. I was still trying to process what had happened and looking back on that day it opened my world to that realm. We started looking up paranormal things on the internet and others encounters of ghosts and spirits.   After a full day of of geeing out on paranormal videos I had to go back home. Before I left though I felt a heavy weight on my shoulders as I was exiting. I got into my car and drove home and I remember it was like someone was holding me down by my shoulders. So I finally get home and go straight to my room and turn on the TV. I start unpacking and call my girlfriend to let her know that I got home safely. We end up talking on the phone and discuss what happened the previous night. I was still scared out of my mind that her dad was going to confront her about the previous night. Turns out he kept it between us and didn't tell her mom.   I get off the phone with my girlfriend and I notice that the feeling of someone watching me has come back. Now to paint the picture for you guys of my room, its only about 10X10 with a full size bed and a dresser that has my tv on it. Next to the dresser is a pretty big window that has blinds always turned shut because I'm on the first floor. the Blinds don't take up the whole window so there is about a inch on either side where you can see out to my side yard. I see movement a quick blur of white. My whole body freezes and my eyes lock into place on the window. My mind is racing and trying to put together what I just saw. I slowly take my phone out of my pocket and look down and my girlfriend is already calling me.   I answer the phone barely getting the words out of my mouth,  ""She's here."" My girlfriend was confused, ""what do you mean?"" ""The woman in white, she is here. I think she latched on to me or something.""  My girlfriend couldn't believe it. Hell I couldn't believe it. I told her I would call her back and hang up the phone. I slowly approach the window and move the blinds so I can't see the edges of the window from my bed.   For the next couple of days I get a nightly scare from the woman in white until about the 8th day. Since I adjusted my blinds I can't see out of them but she still lets me know she is there by causing me to break out in a sweat and the usual feeling of her watching me. Whats strange is that I never had my hair played with again like what happened at my girlfriends house.   To give you a picture of my house, its a two story that I share with my family of five and a couple of pets. Occasionally my dog will sleep in my room or my sisters. He is getting old in age and his sight is slowly going away but still a loyal dog nonetheless. My dog never barks though unless he feels threatened. So, one night he comes downstairs because its cooler, and nudges the door open to my room and hops on my bed. I watched TV for an hour and then fell asleep because I had school the next day. I am fast asleep when I get woken up by my dog growling and standing on my bed facing the window. I tell him to be quiet and lay back down on the bed. As he starts to settle down that all to familiar feeling overwhelms me.   I put my dog back upstairs into my sisters room and come back downstairs and as I cross the threshold of my door, I something not looking into my window, but walking past it. I couldn't make out what it was but I thought it was someone trying to break into my house. I grabbed the closest thing in my room I could use as a weapon, which happened to be a tennis racket and treaded lightly to the door that led to my back yard. I slid it open and approached the side of my house, but nothing was there. I ran back inside and made sure all of the doors were locked and did one more quick scan of my house for any intruders. Luckily, my whole family and I were safe for the night, but I got no sleep for a couple of days.   If you guys like it so far let me know and ill post the rest"

Ghosts,2objsk,tendorphin,3,Fri Dec 5 05:13:59 2014 UTC,"Fotoforensics shows that there's a halo of lighter color around the figure, and an arc about an inch or two out from the figure, as framed in this image which would indicate that two images were cut and placed into the image. The figure may have been cut from something, darkened, and compressed to blend in with the background, and perhaps a second image of the room cut out so that the figure could be more easily worked into the image. Then, when the edited bits were worked back into the image the software had to blend the two together, causing a tiny bit of rainbowing/haloing to occur. I tried to outline it, but copying it, pasting it, and resaving it just made the colors blend even more from being re-jpegged. I'd have to say this looks fake to me due to what I see in fotoforensics.  Edit: [it's a cat](www.imgur.com/bvaQoOj.jpg)"

It is so easily explained away by inattentional blindness, memory interference, or just, they didn't see them. The first picture, for instance, was at an air show. She could have climbed in, been looking over toward the camera, another guy climbed in to have his picture taken while she was focused elsewhere, and then never bothered to look in the direction of the other seat. No mystery, just someone ignoring details of the circumstances, like everyone else at every moment of their lives.  Also clickbait."

This is as good as I could make this photo after enlarging resolution to 3000, reducing for sharpness back to 72 dpi at 3000px wide, adjusting levels and saturation (because of the over-yellowing from ambient light)   This photo is HORRIBLE condition and will not get much better than this. There are few details visible, you can't even really make out the gender of the four people on the right, let alone any details of the ""ghost"" on the left. Sure, there's no digital manipulation present, other than bad cropping, but The ""ghost"" blocks out 100% of all light, thus disturbing visible light, which means it would have to have been visible to you. You can even make out vagueries of a pattern on the back of a T-shirt. The ""ghost"" appeared spooky and dark because the person seated there was in the cast shadow of the cross on top of the mausoleum, and is wearing a dark colored shirt and has dark hair. By contrast the person seated directly to the right is wearing a white shirt, which makes it look even more like the person is hidden because the white simply pops out more into the foreground. All four of you are seated tightly together on the right side, leaving just enough room for a fifth person to be seated on the far left. If you truly were only a group of four, why would you not give yourselves elbow room instead of sitting in a claustrophobic cluster at the far right end?   No. Just no. Stop lying."

I never believed in ghost before this picture and tried to tell my friend she was crazy when she showed it to me. But I have looked it over multiple times, and thank you for blowing it up for me, I didn't know how to do that, but it freaks me out even more now that you did. I have no explanation for it. Whether it be a shadow of us or not, i don't know how that would be possible for a shadow to reflect like that though.   Also, tell me this. If you really wanna believe there were five of us up there, why would only four of us show up clearly and the figure all the way to the left look only like a shadow.."
Ghosts,2o3q9g,digitalyss,4,Wed Dec 3 16:04:06 2014 UTC,"Because as I've said multiple times, the ambient light caused the tall cross on the left to cast a shadow. Because there are multiple light sources in multiple areas, the woman immediately to the right is lit because a different light source was not blocked by the cross.  Also, your camera was horrible. It doesn't light meter properly, or you don't know how, which means any movement at all would cause blur, and everyone always thinks blurry photos are ghosts when really is just someone moving faster than the shutter speed.   There's also the fact that I need to reiterate. Your camera is not a full spectrum, meaning that it only sees visible light and what disturbs it (shadow and reflection, refraction etc). This person on the left side is 100% solid, blocking/absorbing 100% of all visible light. There is 0% chance that you did not see them because it is actually interacting with the light in the exact manner of a solid, physical object.   You are not telling the truth, science proves that.   Edit: the person is in silhouette, meaning that the reason you can still see them even in darkness is because there's a dim light on the opposite side of the object with mass that isn't bright enough to fully illuminate the scene. In this case, the sky lit by city lights."

If the phone captured a dark area, you would have seen it with your own eyes as well. Since you did not, then it must be shadow-play, a light artifact (not in this case), or something on the lens/sensor. The most likely explanation is shadow play.

Any time you have to edit a picture in any way to make something appear, it is probably pareidolia.  Never mind the fact that we have very powerful telescopes (including one's that ""normal"" people can buy at not that great of cost) that have never spotted pyramids on the moon. While the pink lady is certainly spooky, a picture like this is easily reproducible with a low shutter speed.  Is the picture interesting?  Sure, but I could dress in Pink and flap my arms around in low shutter speed and create this exact image.  Could it be a ghost?  Maybe, but what's more likely, that a spirit of a dead person is in a window, or that it is a reflection or simply a person, hoax or otherwise, taken on low shutter speed? See also: Occam's razor. Here's several good explanations of the ""foo fighters"", bu I think the best sentence in the entire article is ""Since aviators are not skilled observers of human behavior, they usually have only the vaguest understanding of their own feelings, like other naive persons, therefore, they have simply adopted a term to cover a multitude of otherwise inexplicable events.""  It is also worth noting that like the ""alien phenomena"", foo fighters were varied when they were first reported, but over time the stories became more and more similar which is a form of confirmation bias. I think you pretty much named what the naga fireballs probably are. 2 things: First, if this was an image of a man dressed in a business suit, would any one have second guessed that it was just some dude walking around opening and closing doors?  No.  Why would we now second guess that this isn't a human being dressed in period clothing on a location where people from time to time dress in period clothing and in fact must be a ghost?  Second: how does a ghost from hundreds of years ago know how to operate a modern door like this?"

True skepticism is taking everything, temporarily suspending belief, using Occam's Razor, and using just the facts."

I felt like I was grabbed by the shoulders and pulled horizontally through the headboard and the exterior wall behind, and out into the night. I sort of regained control while my legs were still in the house and struggled for what felt like ages (but was probably about 5/10 secs) until I kind of snapped back into my body. I immediately sat-up/rolled forward to the bottom of the bed. It put me off trying again for a long time, because the force pulling me felt like it had a will.   Now I'm too old and jaded and just chslk it up to being some kind of sleep-paralysis type thing - even though I could only have been sleeping for moments and it was early evening and I was fully clothed and not sleepy."

I went ahead and edited the lightness and color of the picture, which shows the border of the TV much more distinctly. http://imgur.com/uccRGGJ.jpg  EDIT: She's either lying about the TV being off, or misremembering. The TV is on, and a movie or show is playing. The children in the picture are Asian, so the movies with Asian women are countless, and they often use white face paint for many different reasons.

Lots of wood in a structure and temperature changes generally make a lot of weird noise.  Or if you want a more paranormal explanation, one theory is that when ghosts pass through walls its because when the spirit was alive the architecture of the building had a doorway or empty space where there is now a wall. Maybe when they appear on the stairs its because the stairs were there when they were alive.   I have wondered about ghosts and stairs too. Why so many sightings on stairs? I can understand why here are a lot of sightings in bedrooms while people are just waking up from a dream but what is it about staircases that seem to attract ghosts?

It takes a shit-ton of energy for us to create virtual particles.    The best I can figure out is a phase shift in time where the interactions with our matter slip through to our reality/time. Who knows.  When we understand reality, we will know better."
Ghosts,2mp8jl,snowbirdie,3,Wed Nov 19 00:33:16 2014 UTC,"This is a good question. Our local ghost hunter extraordinaire says that ghosts follow patterns that were known at the time. They will walk through walls because, back when they were alive, those were doorways. (case in point, a friend says her mom's house is haunted by a guy that walks out of a second floor closet every night but, back then, it was the door to an elevator.)  So, I guess, my answer is that ghosts who walk down stairways are walking down ones that were there when they were alive. What would be cool is ghosts that walk down ""air stairways"" because the stairways have since been removed! Also, it's so very important that you put an apostrophe in the word ghosts.  Not! (see other comment)"
Ghosts,2mp8jl,ruffthesuspect,3,Wed Nov 19 16:45:30 2014 UTC,"One speculation is that ghosts only manifest in our consciousness and sensory processing. This idea doesn’t work for every situation, but it bears some consideration.   If what’s really happening, in some cases, is that the ghost is imprinting our minds, then hearing them is a manipulation of our sensory processing. That would mean there’s no need for a physics of actually producing sound.  What about recordings of ghostly footsteps? There’s a Parapsychological theory about us being able to imprint media via paranormal means. Most research in this area was done in the 1960s and 1970s with film, but if it’s real, there’s no reason to think it wouldn’t also work with video or recording media. In that case, recordings of ghostly footsteps might also be manifestations from us, triggered by the ghost. The ghost doesn’t have to manifest.  I’ve even heard of a variant of this theory for recordings done remotely with no attendant observers. It’s supposed to work like this: what’s actually imprinted on the recording is the psychic impression projected by the ghost, so anyone observing the recording, or listening to it, will react in the same way as if they were there: they’d see the thing happen, and hear it happen - regardless of time, or space.   Why open doors, cabinets, etc.? A number of posters have already mentioned a pretty good reason: to get our attention. There’s plenty of video of doors and such being opened when no one’s about though, so what’s that all about - barring what I just noted above?   If it’s an old house, or a location that existed in essentially the same state as when the ghost was created, it might be a residual haunting effect - as another poster noted. The ghost is just doing what it did while alive. How? Who knows.  As for going through floors, I have personal experience of a phantom rising up through the floor in front of me, pausing to gaze at me, then rising up through the ceiling and disappearing. Now, it’s arguable what, in fact, I saw, but the suggestion is that depending on what the ghost wants to do, floors and such aren’t a barrier.  The idea that ghosts may manifest in collusion with us, as a combined sensory experience, suggests that a reason some ghosts appear to obey rules of interior spaces is because we expect them to. If ghosts use and manipulate our consciousness that just may be part of the package - they use our existing reality constructs."

Ghosts,2mp8jl,Altibadass,2,Wed Nov 19 09:08:47 2014 UTC,"The difference is residual haunts vs intelligent haunts.  A residual haunt is not technically a ghost at all. It is simply an moment in time that was captured electromagnetically. When the electromagnetic conditions are just right, that moment gets ""played out"" just as if you had pressed Play on a VCR.  The reason a lot of residual haunts pass through walls is because the layout of the building has changed. Where there was once a door or a hallway, there is now a wall.  As to why ghosts can walk down stairs, I have no idea."

Along with a nap (siesta) in the day, it has been argued that this is the natural pattern of human sleep.   A case has been made that maintaining such a sleep pattern may be important in regulating stress.  Historian A. Roger Ekirch   has argued that before the Industrial Revolution, segmented sleep was the dominant form of human slumber in Western civilization. He draws evidence from documents from the ancient, medieval, and modern world.  Other historians, such as Craig Koslofsky,  have endorsed Ekirch's analysis.

There is another out of body experience they can create experimentally which has a person sitting in a chair wearing goggles with monitors in them.

I've participated in the rubber hand experiment and it is bizarre. It felt like the rubber hand was my own, and the experimenter even smacked the hand with a hard implement, which made me yell, ""ouch!"" It was cool.  It is really interesting that lack of sense of sight has brought such a new dimension to drift and feeling of ownership, that it brings a feeling of another presence in the room.

Ghosts,2lj5qi,cwamoon,1 point,Sun Nov 9 19:36:40 2014 UTC,"The answer to your question would really depend on the doctrine you follow, or the theory your belief is founded upon.  In Occult, what is commonly referred to as ""ghosts"" are separated into spirits, ghosts and phantoms. Again, depending on which doctrine, this division may be different or non-existent.  Generally though, each theory has an assumption that all other conditions are built upon, or rises out of.  The idea that a ghost is an extension of every-day human consciousness is often viewed as a troublesome idea: not only does this seem to be an extension of egotism, but also brings up the question of objectivity vs subjectivity. As in, if it's an individual's psychic disturbance that causes and defines a ghost's existence, that is with the assumption that a ghost possess an ego that is under trauma or stress, still functioning under the pleasure principle that we understand of our psychology. But the varying conditions of an ego does not allow us to determine exactly what CAN be considered as an ingredient to becoming a ghost, since not ALL traumas seem to result in a ghost apparition. This line of thinking ends up nesting in the realm of individual subjectivity, and the ghost is only perceived by the individual as an extension of his/her ego.  In response, other theories severed their ties with human-centric ideas, and claims that ""ghosts"" are outside of our understanding and functions within a separate dimension. Although this seemingly answers the troubles of ego-centric perspectives, it also does not illuminate anything to us as humans, since it only admits to the fact that we cannot comprehend the realm of ghosts, whatever that may be.  There are branches that tries to mediate these two: that ghosts MIGHT be objective, but that its perception or existence is ultimately dependent on the subjective capacity of individuals.  Either way, there are many different theories as to what the experience of a ghost is like... Perhaps it's a spirit, possessing a consciousness like our own, a being existing in pure mental and energy form rather than physical. Perhaps it's a ghost, only possessing a partial consciousness that was once a physical being but due to a traumatic death the over-excitation of unreleased carthexis congeals in the mental realm. Or perhaps it's a phantom, simply an energy trace/trail of a certain consciousness, which will eventually dissipate over time.  It really depends :P"

I was upstairs going down the corridor to my room, when I saw the figure of what looked like an elderly lady, dressed in a frock type dress, she seemed like she was stooping down to pick something up. I froze, and being only 8 years old let out a whimper, when I did she turned and looked at me, smiling nicely. Sadly I bolted to my room and hid under there blankets. I then began to hear slow footsteps walking down the corridor to my room. Once they entered my toom I screamed for my Dad, who came sprinting upstairs, the footsteps stopped when I screamed."

Ghosts,2kyhqm,Hunkgolden,2,Sat Nov 1 06:27:11 2014 UTC,"That didn't sound very close to me. Sound travels extremely well, depending on location. This could be the sound of children playing a ways away. I've listened to the clip with headphones on, at max volume, and can't clearly hear any distinct words being spoken. I'd be more inclined to believe it was a bird off in the distance, or possibly someone with a set of earbuds in, listening to something a short distance away. We're you there alone?"
Ghosts,2kyhqm,MTjones,3,Sat Nov 1 13:41:37 2014 UTC,"There's a chance it could have been farther away than what I perceived, but there was no way to know for sure. There were two other people with me, neither of the were moving during the recording and both said they heard the sound. In the beginning of the recording you can hear me breathing and moving a little bit, but I stood still and held my breathe when the sound began.  It was very secluded, in between dense forest and corn fields, so I know for a fact that there was nobody there. Also, I don't think it could have been anybody else, because it doesn't even sound natural. It almost sounds as if it's from a tape recorder playing on loop, with an otherworldly, somewhat robotic voice. I can't make out anything it's saying, but I know it loops and stops halfway through the second time.  Of course, I'd love to know what made this sound, however I just see no possible way it could have been a person. Maybe it's some kind of bird, but there are no exotic bird native to Wisconsin that a capable of saying (seemingly) english words."

The reflection on the floor and the light source in the elevator do not seem to jibe with each other at all when looked at with the ELA process, leading me to believe the light in the elevator has been manipulated or masked by an overlay.  The perspective on the figure is all wrong as well, unless it is the ghost of a giant person. Otherwise they seem to fill that doorway a bit too much.  I'll defer to Jack_Shid though."

Ghosts,2kvley,DimKingdom,4,Fri Oct 31 15:03:44 2014 UTC,"It definitely does only help with certain kinds of fakes, like where they're using an image that has been saved and resaved over top of one that has only been saved once, but no tool should be dismissed because it is only useful sometimes, especially when it's as easy to use as this one. If we can dismiss a picture just by using this very simple tool, why not? If it passes the test but is clearly fake, then we move on to the next test, and have only wasted a minute or two."
Ghosts,2kvley,Jack_Shid,2,Fri Oct 31 17:32:50 2014 UTC,"You make a good point. Using it to filter out the blatant fakes would be a good use, but just because they ""pass"" should not make anyone believe that the photo is 100% legit."

[also, once again feel I should point out that I am no expert in that particular field!] I rarely have to do that though, as the evidence usually never makes it that far.  I would love to see some proof, but at this point, I feel so jaded at looking at all the ghost app photos and fakes that I doubt I will ever be able to fully trust photography as indisputable proof of anything other than art..."

Ghosts,2kseha,dyingenglish,1 point,Sat Nov 15 01:36:21 2014 UTC,What I have been led to believe is that it varies from case to case. Sometimes there are ghosts that haunt a particular place but in other cases I've heard of a spirit latching onto a particular person. It seems plausible that a ghost may follow a person for whatever reason. Maybe they feel a connection to this person or maybe they just decide that they want to make their life miserable for whatever reason.

Ghosts,2kk2o1,Efraing14,8,Tue Oct 28 15:36:32 2014 UTC,"It's a fake. Shortwave radio and high frequency radios upon which it carries is a very long waveform. If you listen to the plain static you can here this in the rising and falling of the audio. This is how us radio listeners determine local interference from actual shortwave broadcast interference, and is know as multi-pathing. In other words radio wave signals bounce all over the place, and arrive at the antenna from multiple directions and paths. The ""ghost"" feedback should have the same characteristics. I'm skeptical because it doesn't sound like a radio transmission, but more like artificial audio."

Audio edited to be louder, higher frequency, AND backwards is going to inevitably sound eery and significant thanks to natural human matrixing. The reason Isabelle is said repeatedly and drawn out is because that's what this baby cry sounds like backwards and heavily edited.

Ghosts,2k9a30,snowbirdie,9,Sat Oct 25 15:30:19 2014 UTC,"This looks like a woman who just turned and looked at the exhibit.  The photo must have been snapped right as she was turning to look at the exhibit, which is why the top half of her is blurry."
Ghosts,2k9a30,snowbirdie,2,Sat Oct 25 13:44:25 2014 UTC,"My assessment is she's taking a step forward to look closer at something, raincoat and chin-length haircut. The Saber-like shape at her side is the shadow of the picture frame in the case behind her."
Ghosts,2k9a30,flyingsaucerinvasion,3,Sat Oct 25 15:15:24 2014 UTC,"Possibly. However my coworker did say that he and his brother were the only people in the room (besides the photographer). I have to trust he is telling the truth though.   The ghost image is particularly interesting to me because the feet are odd looking, like they get blurred. Also the coat looks like it has a rain flap, the figure is wearing high gloves, and even what looks like a sword of its left side."
Ghosts,2k9a30,tendorphin,7,Sat Oct 25 13:58:40 2014 UTC,"In his eyes, he could be telling the truth because he didn't notice her. That doesn't mean it's the real truth. The girl was alone and has on quiet shoes. She may have just been out of sight.  It really just looks like a real person that turned her head. With the low lighting, you get motion blur.   Also, to proof, cameras aren't magical. They capture the visible light spectrum just like we see. So that means the guys would have had to seen her as well. The fact that they didn't shows that they were ignorant about the number of people in the room."
Ghosts,2k9a30,DarthJetta,0,Sat Oct 25 16:47:50 2014 UTC,"I appreciate your thoughtful critique. The figure does look like a someone is physically standing there. Perhaps he, his brother, and the photographer were all unaware someone else had been in the room as well.   And yes, the camera does capture a spectrum of light. However it does not see ""like we see"". The camera lens captures light in a different way than the human eye."
Ghosts,2k9a30,sk1wbw,0,Sat Oct 25 19:20:06 2014 UTC,Do you think the camera sees magical lambas? The lens works exactly as our eyes do.  That's why they're called the same thing. You are clearly not educated in physics or photography and should not be making such false statements.

This shadow person would get my heart jumping because it was very large and would block out light, it always caught me off guard. I picked him up on a trip through the woods one night with my sister. We experienced a few things and for about two weeks I saw this different shadow person."

The main problem with analog recorders is that they actually record the sound of the mechanism that moves the reels, so the recording will be fairly noisy. It's better than nothing though, so I'd take it. Make sure to use new tapes though, so you don't have any bleed-through from past recordings."

Ghosts,2jooym,dilont,2,Sun Oct 19 16:49:16 2014 UTC,Your local government or hospital should have open records of people who have died. Deaths arent usually confidential.
Ghosts,2jooym,theutensil,4,Sun Oct 19 23:25:47 2014 UTC,"I was downstairs playing don't starve    Haha! I lost it. Anyways, sounds like you MAY have something. Interested to see what, if any, video may surface. Keep us posted!"
Ghosts,2jooym,vteck1030,2,Sun Oct 19 14:45:11 2014 UTC,"Firstly, please learn to use punctuation. Sorry, I'm really not trying to insult you, but it's difficult to understand your writing. Secondly, you don't know that your cats are watching anything walking around, or anything at all for that matter. For example, cats and other animals (like dogs) look in the direction of sounds they hear, so they could just be hearing stuff outside/next door etc. As someone else pointed out, they could also be watching/hearing bugs fly about that you don't notice, or they could just be staring about the room because they're freaking cats. The door opening and stuff being messed up could just be the cats. Old buildings are creaky and draughty, making odd sounds and blowing doors open if the latch isn't fully engaged. If you put up those cameras and find anything truly spooky, I will be VERY surprised, but I kinda hope you do. Best of luck!"
Ghosts,2jooym,snowbirdie,1 point,Tue Oct 21 14:40:47 2014 UTC,"Cats have waaaay better vision than we do at night, but they see LESS of the visible spectrum than we do. Cats don't have magical ghost-seeing powers. If you don't see it, then there's no way they can. What they CAN see better than us are tiny moving things like bugs at night. My cats jump in the air and dance around at seemingly nothing, but turn on the light and there will be a tiny fly or something. There's no paranormal claim here.   The door opening is likely a draft. Even if you don't feel wind, the suction is there. Don't leave windows open and make sure doors are closed with a click. You probably didn't close the door completely and the cats had fun.   Seeing things out if the corner of your eye is another no-brainer. Our periphery vision is terrible. So terrible that you cannot accurately determine shape or even colour. Your brain literally makes up an image that makes sense to you. Ever see a coat rack out of the corner of your eye and think it was a person then laughed at how silly you are? That's it. Your periphery vision is designed to detect motion, nothing more. It detects motion better than your frontal vision. This is a survival trait.   If you put your camera on motion recording, make sure you set it to high sensitivity."
Ghosts,2jooym,Clienterror,1 point,Sun Oct 19 19:26:28 2014 UTC,"Honestly if the property is that old I'd check a few things before going to any conclusions. Check your wiring and fuse box for a high EM field, this can make people who are more sensitive to high EM fields to feel paranoia and think they see things like your partner. Also with the age I'm sure it is no where near square, doors may do this if the frame isn't square around the door (really common in older structures) and if it isn't square it might not close properly. Once it pops open because it was barely latched it could open because it's just gravity slowing opening it. Just a few things to look at."

Ghosts,2jn2d5,libertyordeath11,7,Sat Oct 18 21:42:05 2014 UTC,"Background: The Virginia Military Institute (VMI) was founded in 1839, when the college was established at the old Virginia state arsenal in Lexington. The cadets took over guarding the arsenal from the Virginia Militia at that time, and they still stand sentinel duty today. The barracks, which all cadets must live in during their time at VMI, was built around the original arsenal in 1851, and is a national historic landmark. The barracks, which was partially destroyed in 1864 by Union troops during the Civil War, has undergone additions and small renovations over the years, but the original “old barracks” is still in use today. In fact, General “Stonewall” Jackson’s former classroom and office (also where his body laid in state after his death in the Civil War) is actually a cadet room today.  Story: One of my classmates took this random picture late one night in his room located in the “old barracks” at VMI. It wasn’t until months later that he actually looked at the picture and noticed the ghostly apparition. Naturally, he showed the picture to many of us, which only confirmed what we already believed; that the VMI barracks is haunted. It also may be useful stating for the purposes of validating this photograph and story that VMI has one of the strictest honor codes in the United States, and that cadets are not allowed to lie for any reason.  Description: The figure appears to be wearing the uniform of a winter sentinel, which includes a gray wool overcoat complete with shoulder cape, and white dress gloves. It looks like the head is wearing a winter cap, and the ‘hands’ even appear to be holding a rifle at a position of “rest”.   Conclusion: After four years living in the barracks at VMI, I am convinced that that place is haunted. Everyone I ever talked to about this topic at VMI seemed to have their own personal experiences that caused them to believe the same thing. I have had many other far creepier encounters in the barracks at night, which I would be willing to share for those interested, but those stories lack photographic proof. Anyway, if you ever meet anyone who went to VMI, ask them if they ever had any experiences with ghosts. Chances are you won’t be disappointed with what they have to say."
Ghosts,2jn2d5,lhatethiswebsite,6,Sat Oct 18 21:42:13 2014 UTC,What was your personal experience?
Ghosts,2jn2d5,thetallgiant,7,Sat Oct 18 22:01:56 2014 UTC,"I have had a couple of different experiences/encounters at VMI, but none compare to this one. There was a story about a ghost/poltergeist called The Yellow Peril. Apparently it was a ghost that was only seen on the 3rd floor near a particular stairwell inside the barracks that had a yellow face with a bloody gash down the center. (I’m literally getting chills as I write this…) Anyway, there were a couple of cadets and faculty that had claimed to have seen it. Always the same description, same location, and always at around 0330 at night. (This is also the time when drum-outs take place; when a cadet is dismissed for an honor violation). Everyone who said they saw it always said that they were walking the stoops when they got the powerful feeling that they were being watch or that someone was following them. When they turned around, there it was, the yellow face with a bleeding scar, staring right at them.  Anyway, one night when I lived on the 3rd floor of the barracks (I was a sophomore cadet at the time, and all sophomores live on the 3rd floor), I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. (Cadet rooms do not have bathrooms, and you have to leave your room and walk on the outside stoop to go to one.) I remember looking at my clock and it said 0329, but I didn’t think anything of it. Well I went to the bathroom and was walking back to my room, passing by that particular staircase, when every hair on my body stood up. (Again, I’m getting chills right now just writing this.) I have never before nor since had such a strong “sixth sense” feeling like it, and I can actually remember an internal voice in my head telling me that if I turned around, I was going to see something I did not want to see. Well, I’d love to tell you that I was brave and turned around, but I didn’t, and instead I pulled my bathrobe up over the back of my head and walked as swiftly as I could back to my room. Everything in me wanted to run, but I knew that if I did that, I would panic. The whole way back I felt like I was being followed, even once I got into my room. I went to go lay down in my rack, pulled my blanket over my head, and tried to go back to sleep.  Here’s where it gets even creepier… A couple of months later I was doing some personal research in the bottom level of the library in the section on VMI history (which is rather extensive). Anyway, I found this book called “Memories of VMI” or something like that, published in 1937. It was a collection of different stories from alumni around the turn of the century, some comical, some not so. Well, as I was flipping through the various chapters/stories, I saw one titled “The VMI Phantom”. It sounded interesting, so I began to read it. It was a story from an alumnus who was talking about an event back when he was a cadet. He said that one morning a sophomore cadet seemed pretty shaken during breakfast, and his roommates were trying to find out what was wrong. After a while, he finally told them that the night before, around 0330, he awoke in his bed to the feeling that he was being watched. When he looked up, he saw standing over him a ghost with a yellow face and a bleeding scar… (More chills.) His roommates all laughed at him and told him that he was just dreaming. Well, a few nights later two other sophomore cadets said they both woke up in the middle of the night after feeling the sensation that they were being watched, and both saw the ghost with a yellow face and bleeding scar. Word traveled through barracks about the apparition, and a number of cadets decided to try to “catch” the spirit. The next night two cadet roommates who were on the football team woke up and saw the ghost. Both apparently leapt at the ghost and tried to pin it to the wall with a chair. One cadet was flung over a table by the ghost and the other broke his arm. After that, the entire barracks was in a state of panic. Cadets slept with their rifles, bayonets, and a few kept pistols underneath their pillows. Officers who normally performed midnight checks to make sure cadets were in their beds after lights out were apparently rushing along the stoops as quickly as possible, completely neglecting to even look into rooms. After a time, the ghost hadn't been seen for a while, and everything went back to normal…  After finishing the chapter, I was utterly stunned. Here was a story, written from a no doubt honorable man, almost 100 years prior, describing the exact same ghost, with the same descriptions and in the same location, that cadets and faculty were seeing today. No one I talked to ever knew anything about “the yellow peril” having been seen decades before, and the book I found probably hadn’t been read for well over 50 years. After that, I knew that what I felt on the 3rd stoop that night wasn’t my imagination. It was the same ghost that has been haunting that area of the old barracks for a hundred years. I never walked anywhere near that part of the barracks after dark for the rest of my cadetship."
Ghosts,2jn2d5,thetallgiant,4,Sun Oct 19 00:07:28 2014 UTC,"Nothing to do with ghosts, but I went to Norwich and I'm interested about the drumming out ceremony. Could you tell me more about that?"
Ghosts,2jn2d5,Cloven_Hooves,4,Sun Oct 19 02:46:34 2014 UTC,"Background on the VMI Honor Code: VMI has arguably the strictest honor code of any college in the U.S. The code simply states that “A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.” This code is taken very seriously by all, and is central to everything at VMI. The code is adhered to so well that it is actually against school policy for professors to be present in the classroom while cadets take tests or exams, because doing so is considered to be insulting to our honor. There is an Honor Court, comprised of a small group of about 15 cadets (all juniors and seniors) elected to their position by their peers, who are responsible for administering the judicial aspects of the Honor Code. If a cadet is suspected of violating the code, a trial is held. These trials are held in complete secrecy, so that no stigma will be attached to a cadet who is found innocent of the charges. The jury who decide the outcome of the trials are non-Honor Court member cadets that are randomly selected from the Corps. These cadets (and any others who may be involved in the trail as witnesses, etc.) are sworn to secrecy, never to talk about the trial they may or may not have been involved with. If a cadet is found guilty of breaking the Honor Code, they are immediately dismissed from the school. They are not even allowed to return to the barracks to retrieve their personal items; a member of the Honor Court does that for them. No one really knows that a trial has taken place, nor the outcome, until later that night…  The Drum Out: At 0330 in the morning, with every light in the entire barracks turned out, the entire Corps is woken up by an incredibly loud and startling drum roll. As this happens, members of the Honor Court, wearing their dress uniform, run the stoops, hitting each door saying “The Honor Court has met” to ensure that everyone is awake. All cadets must exit their rooms and stand on the stoops facing inward to the old barracks courtyard. The drummers are located in the shadows of a basement-like area of the courtyard that leads down to the armory known as “the sinks”, where the sound of the “long roll” reverberates through the entire barracks. The drummers are in dress uniform too, each one using only black drumsticks. About every minute the drum roll begins to crescendo, as a member of the Honor Court yells “DEATH… BEFORE… DISHONOR!” Then, the drum roll suddenly stops to a loud “crack, boom” of a large base drum. Then the drum roll starts again. This is continued about every minute until every cadet is present on the stoops, ready to witness the ceremony. Once the drum roll has stopped, and the whole barracks is quiet, the entire Honor Court marches into the barracks courtyard and suddenly halts without command. The Honor Court president continues, walking around the center of the courtyard. As he does this, he yells (an example): “Tonight, the Honor Court has met. After a trial hearing, we have found Cadet 2nd Classmen, John Doe, guilty of two counts of making a false official statement, and two counts of cheating. He has placed personal gain over personal honor, and has left the Institute in shame. His name will never be spoken in barracks again!” After that, the president walks back into the Honor Court formation, which about faces, and marches out of the courtyard. At this point, the drum out has concluded, and everyone returns to their room, trying to go back to sleep, thinking about the consequences of breaking the Honor Code."

Ghosts,2jmpbn,InvaderDem,2,Sat Oct 18 19:28:35 2014 UTC,"I lived in a house where things would be put away in the fridge and when we wake up somethings are top shelf of the cupboard.  Another house had a bandana come up missing and a necklace both found same place different times. The time my bandana was found was by my mom cleaning out the coat closet. Had stuff at the bottom that was there for years and she found my favorite bandana under it all. The other time my sister was on the computer across from this closet she hears a rattling noise goes and looks and its the missing necklace.  The house I live in now I hear a little kid call out ( like "" Mommy will you play with me"") and little kid laughter here and there( I have a 5 year old daughter but each time these have happened she would be in another room with somebody else, and the voice sounds like a little boy and not like my daughter) We hear noises like cupboards slamming, and doors opening and closing. The house has one of those floors you can feel movement very easily. You can sit on the couch and every once in a while when nobody is home you feel the floor shake. One night my floor standing fan was hit waking me up. Since my boyfriend was asleep I thought a fly. When I woke up the next morning and looked at the fan thinking I would see left overs of this massive bug. There was a indent about the size of a golf ball in the front of it. Since this fan has a metal front I was confused what could cause that. Then on another  night I woke up out of a dead sleep there was a little light casting under my door lifting up a little bit but in front of me I saw a child standing next to my bed next to my body I was only about 6 inches away from this White glowing smoke in the shape of a child. What caught my attention is when this this faded away the smoke dissolved into it's self instead of billowing out into thin lines it was like it was sucked back up. That day after seeing that child I was very drained for about 3 days I had to recover I had no energy I as very fatigued. I still hear the laughter but haven't seen it next to my bed again."

From what I've been told from a couple different people that claim to see them,  if they move stuff around like that they're typically not harmful and they just want to test you.  Seeing the figure move is a whole different thing though.  I never wanted to see anything like that so it never happened. For me, I would see stuff move randomly and unexplainable noises. It wouldn't hurt to have the house blessed (if you believe in that kind of stuff) or contact someone that can let you know if it's something you need to be worried about."
Ghosts,2jkepk,youredoingtoomuch,17,Sat Oct 18 00:15:31 2014 UTC,"If you used flash in both then why isn't the door frame in front illuminated in the second picture? In fact, the second picture is much darker than the first.  In the first picture you can tell there is flash due to things closer to the camera being brighter than further away. In the second picture this glow is gone, and nothing is illuminated. In fact, it's opposite of the first as things further from the camera are brighter than things closer to the camera.   Also, something standing behind the window on the door wouldn't make the flash stop reflecting off of it.  Not trying to be an asshole OP, I just have a feeling something is wrong here. My dad worked as a professional photographer for years and even I know the aspects of proper lighting. This really looks like a comparison of flash and no flash to me. I could be wrong, but I highly doubt it."
Ghosts,2jkepk,Intempestivity,5,Sat Oct 18 03:53:27 2014 UTC,"Also, another dead give away is that pictures with flash make light farther away look darker. The second picture shows the light farther away as BRIGHTER. This alone proves that flash was not used on both pictures."

Ghosts,2jkepk,thesimplepleasures,4,Sat Oct 18 05:05:29 2014 UTC,I honestly think there is something (furniture?) either leaning against the door or standing right behind it.  The flash is simply obscuring it in the first photo - make it look like it suddenly appeared.

Ghosts,2jhack,aliennative,7,Fri Oct 17 04:50:09 2014 UTC,"I absolutely believe in the Paranormal. But, this looks a bit like someone cut out the picture of a head and taped it to the window. The apparition of the body is just your brain trying to make sense of the floating head. While it would be impressive if it was real, nothing has ever been documented like this. If it were only a shadow standing there, distinctly on the opposite side of the glass, it would be different. Im not saying you're a liar, but my personal opinion is that it is fake."
Ghosts,2jhack,snapper1971,3,Fri Oct 17 21:36:54 2014 UTC,I get where you're coming from and I respect that 1000 times over. Knowing my brother in law and him having this convo in front of some important loving family that accused him like yourself. He couldn't lie about this imho. Thinking about it a group of guys in a log cabin getting drunk for a weekend wouldn't have the time to plan this. My 2cents. I know this isn't a fake or photoshop. Again I respect what everyone on here thinks good and bad.
Ghosts,2jhack,worldDev,2,Sat Oct 18 00:44:48 2014 UTC,Yeah and thats fine! Everyone is welcome to there own opinions. Some things cant be explained
Ghosts,2jhack,v17ads,1 point,Sat Oct 18 01:17:49 2014 UTC,"Well, there's been plenty ""documented"" like this, just everyone thinks they are fake, so there you are with all of this documentation that no one believes."

Ghosts,2jhack,tehgreatblade,2,Sun Oct 19 04:45:45 2014 UTC,Looks like a reflection from the hall/kitchen.
Ghosts,2jhza3,aabee,2,Fri Oct 17 07:49:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. I would very much like to see the picture of the hand print if you don't mind uploading it. I understand that it's probably quite unpleasant for you to look at, so it's fine if you don't want to. The wet bed is quite tricky to explain. It was only wet on one side and the doona (which I think us poms call a duvet) and pillows were completely dry?"
Ghosts,2jhza3,HazMat68W,3,Fri Oct 17 09:12:04 2014 UTC,"No problems I can get the photo... I will upload tomorrow... That's right, the duvet was completely dry on top with the water contained to one side of the bed in a long oval shape, it was very strange..."
Ghosts,2jhza3,patron14,1 point,Fri Oct 17 09:58:45 2014 UTC,"Thanks. Was there any wetness underneath the bed? If a water pipe in the floor of the bedroom sprung a leak under the wet spot, it could have sprayed water into the mattress without making the bedding on top wet, but you would definitely find water on the floor. You'd probably also have damp in the ceiling below etc. but I'm just entertaining any normal explanation I can think of."
Ghosts,2jijcv,Spockhammer,2,Fri Oct 17 13:26:18 2014 UTC,The Daily Mail? Seriously?  They're a completely credible source /s
Ghosts,2jeypw,felipeftz,13,Thu Oct 16 13:26:57 2014 UTC,"I certainly cannot say that this is not paranormal, but it's far more likely that it's just a person standing in the doorway."
Ghosts,2jeypw,Jack_Shid,6,Thu Oct 16 14:22:45 2014 UTC,"For sure, it just seems a person on there, but here, everyone must use uniform (even the part administrative, which is my case). The uniform is white. So, it was in the middle of the day, a part isolate from the hospital's patients (maintenance is at sub-floor) which to access that part, you must have touch the intercom to receive a permission. And the door wasn't far of the guy, and he said, no one was there. He told this to his boss, I don't see a point for he does this."
Ghosts,2jeypw,Jack_Shid,9,Thu Oct 16 17:54:19 2014 UTC,"That's all fine and good, but keep in mind that all we have to go off of is what is presented to us. Everything you're saying here could be true, but we don't know that. All we know for sure is that there is a photo of a desk, and the monitor on that desk shows a reflection of a person standing in a doorway. We have no reason to believe that it's anything other than that."
Ghosts,2jeypw,Jack_Shid,5,Thu Oct 16 18:02:15 2014 UTC,"Yes, you are right. I already heard about things like this from here, but first time with a ""proof"". Maybe just assumed this more than it is suppose to be."
Ghosts,2jeypw,Jack_Shid,5,Thu Oct 16 18:06:02 2014 UTC,"It very well might be proof to you and your coworkers, because you all know the situation there. You all know that what you said above is true. We do not. Again, we have to just go off of the photo by itself, without your claims. I'm not accusing you of lying, please understand that.   Let's face it, I could tell you that my dog can walk up walls and speak French. It doesn't make it true. If I had a video of my dog walking up walls and speaking french, that would be proof. My words by themselves are worthless."

Ghosts,2jeypw,OcmsRazor,6,Thu Oct 16 18:13:35 2014 UTC,"Thank you for posting, and for being understanding! Have a great day! :-)"
Ghosts,2jeypw,OcmsRazor,1 point,Thu Oct 16 18:16:30 2014 UTC,"If the options pretented here are: ghost or your friend being mistaken and someone either broke the uniform rule or didn't work there and was a guest, I gave to lean towards the latter."
Ghosts,2jeypw,jTronZero,8,Sun Oct 19 10:06:50 2014 UTC,"I think if he was taking a photo of his desk, it would be in focus. Instead, his focus is on the monitor to show the ""apparition"" behind him. Doesn't make sense."
Ghosts,2jeypw,snowbirdie,7,Thu Oct 16 15:14:09 2014 UTC,"What exactly is the person taking a photo of? I can't think of a reason that someone would take a photo of a desk like this, unless it's because they noticed how creepy the reflection in the monitor looked when the maintenance guy in his coveralls walks up to the door and leans in, and decided that it would be a fun way to prank his coworkers."
Ghosts,2jeypw,Panzer2583,4,Thu Oct 16 13:34:09 2014 UTC,He took this photo to show the organization of his desk for a 5S program which we have every year here. Probably he had a bad score on organization and had do an appointment about the organization of his office.
Ghosts,2jeypw,sbtier,3,Thu Oct 16 13:41:09 2014 UTC,"It still just looks like someone standing in the doorway. I really don't see anything that would make us believe that it's something paranormal. Who knows, maybe the guy who took the pic didn't realize someone was there, thus the claim that ""no one was at the office in that moment."""
Ghosts,2jeypw,drjewlittle,1 point,Thu Oct 16 13:58:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, for sure. Wasn't me so I can't say with 100% sure.  But just two guys work there (with uniform, white like the guy) and isn't usual go to that area of hospital."
Ghosts,2jeypw,littlehalo,3,Thu Oct 16 14:08:07 2014 UTC,"I hate the ""why would someone take a picture of that"" question that always comes up. People take pictures of all kinds of boring shit all the time."
Ghosts,2jeypw,stella4eva,7,Fri Oct 17 00:52:52 2014 UTC,"Based on the contents on the desk, this photo must be from 1999. Also, it's very clearly another person there with your friend. Your friend lies to you for a good laugh."
Ghosts,2jeypw,Gh0stHunt3r,7,Thu Oct 16 15:45:43 2014 UTC,I was gonna say the only thing back from the dead is that monitor.
Ghosts,2jjdjt,bamacl,2,Fri Oct 17 18:18:25 2014 UTC,That's not a ghost. That's a person in dark pants and a gray hoodie.
Ghosts,2jjdjt,Jack_Shid,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:20:20 2014 UTC,"I wasn't there when the photo was taken, but the girl who posted it swears that there was not a person there when it was taken."
Ghosts,2jjdjt,Jack_Shid,6,Fri Oct 17 18:21:56 2014 UTC,"Well that's fine if she is someone you know, and you believe her. All we have to go by as a group of people on the internet who do not know you or the girl who posted the photo, is the photo itself. We have no way to know if she's telling the truth, so we must ignore what she claims and base our conclusions on the photograph itself. It's pretty clear to me that it's a living person in a hoodie. If anything, maybe they have a prowler, but I don't believe that there is a ghost in this photo."
Ghosts,2jjdjt,OcmsRazor,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:25:49 2014 UTC,"A girl I went to high school with posted this photo to her Facebook page along with this comment, ""For those of you that know my family home and history.. You might find this interesting.. We always blamed the ""paranormal activity"" on a certain female within the family history.. My mom had friends over tonight, one snapped a random photo from her phone camera.. This is what she discovered.. And asked ""who is this man""?"""

Ghosts,2jjdjt,Ali8307,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:19:35 2014 UTC,I wouldn't expect a ghost to be so opaque....
Ghosts,2jds2x,g0lfw4ng,4,Thu Oct 16 02:41:42 2014 UTC,"The first thing I would do is to set up cameras in the parts of the house where you are hearing these sounds coming from to see what, if anything, you catch.  It would certainly be interesting to see if there is any thing going on that can be caught on camera.  After you see what you are dealing with, then I would find a good, solid, reputable paranormal investigation group and let them come in and see what THEY are able to dig up.  Once you decide exactly what it is you are dealing with, THEN you can come up with a battle plan to either get it out of your house or come up with a plan for you and the spirits to be able to live together."
Ghosts,2jds2x,Ghyllie,4,Thu Oct 16 03:43:48 2014 UTC,"I might add that research into the history of this house and the land associated with it could be useful.  Ask a county official which office you should go to for this information.  Checking with a librarian at your local library or historical society is also worth doing.  I would absolutely avoid communications at this point, at least if you mean question and answer sessions.  You would do well to begin asking the spirit(s) to leave you and your home alone in peace.  I see no obvious harm in beginning to document supernatural events, but I assure you this should be secondary to asking the entity to leave.  Paranormal investigators and the internet may be fascinated by your photos, etc., but they don't have to live in your house--keep that in mind.  Asking entities to leave is a process that may extend to a week or more of daily appeals.  Be respectful, courteous, firm and clear in what you want to say. If you are frightened, be sure to explain that to the spirit and ask that it stop scaring you.  I definitely would not make offers of help, despite what you see and hear.  It is nearly impossible to ascertain a spirit's true situation; the chances of you being able to provide material and immediate ""help"" are slim to none.  Best of luck and keep us updated on what happens."
Ghosts,2jds2x,spooklog,1 point,Fri Oct 17 00:45:11 2014 UTC,This seems like a really great idea. I remember watching early episodes of 'Ghost Hunters' and they often did this before investigations (think they still do). I'd love to know any history about your home.
Ghosts,2jds2x,SeafoodDuder,2,Sun Oct 19 02:49:03 2014 UTC,"Is the house fully detached, i.e. does it share any walls with another building/buildings?"
Ghosts,2jds2x,Trubridge,1 point,Thu Oct 16 06:08:51 2014 UTC,"Yikes.  That sounds terrible.   Sounds like you have both kinds of stuff happening.   Things (ghosts) that know you're there - & things that don't.  A few simple things can be done to get the process going...it takes time and courage to make it right, but you gotta start somewhere.   Salt is a simple and easy tool in starting to cleanse. Pick an area.   Open the nearest window or door -prop it OPEN. Make a confident announcement that this open door is for anything that needs to leave.   And that you prefer they do it now.    Sprinkle salt evenly (not heavy, just a dusting) in the area (or a whole room).   Try to feel confident while you do it.     Visualize the salt absorbing all the residue of spirits.   Stare at it.   Picture it.   Keep a positive mindset that doing this will help.    When you feel like it has been long enough (leave it for hours if you want as long as the same window/door has been open the whole time)... now sweep all the salt into a pile.   Take the pile and throw it out the open window/door.  When you do it, really visualize that you are setting something free.   Light a white candle and declare the space is only available for loving spirits (like your family)  & that no others are ever allowed.   You can throw God in there, you can say a prayer.  The Lord's prayer is one of the strongest.  When you feel ready.  Blow out the candle. Leave the candle in the area. You can repeat this as many times as you feel it's necessary.   When you feel like an area is finally clear -  you can make a line of salt in the door and/or window to seal it off.  BUT only if you feel like it's better. .. if it's not, it can prohibit the spirit from being able to get out.  Your intent while doing this will determine is effectiveness.  And let me say ::: this will not fix all things weird in your home ---- but it can start a reaction that can only help your situation   I really hope you keep us posted.   Best of luck."
Ghosts,2jds2x,ninjacompoop,1 point,Fri Oct 17 03:02:56 2014 UTC,"I'm no expert. I don't know what to believe. Watching ghost shows may offer some insight. The tactics that seem to work are burning sage in each room and saying a blessing (a temporary fix that only works to calm the spirits for a few weeks), a ""channeling"" where a person allows the spirit to speak through them, or a session where paranormal experts beseech the spirits to accept death and cross over. From what it sounds like, your ghosts aren't hostile. They seem sad and may need some coaxing to cross over. I want to say there are rational explanations for paranormal encounters. Some stories do beckon the question. I'd contact a medium if I were you, you may help a sad, lonely spirit out."
Ghosts,2jds2x,HauntedSnail,1 point,Sat Oct 18 17:42:02 2014 UTC,Keep a record of all your happenings. Look up house history if nothing comes up look up history of the land. A wailing woman are rare but do happen I believe most cry for their children. Maybe this woman crys because she is with one child and not another. Maybe the mother and child died together and possibly another one survived and she don't know yet. Maybe she killed her kids and is wondering crying for her children she had hurt. Try setting up a recorder and ask out loud about children if she has any? Can she find them? Does she know they are waiting on the otherside for her? Because maybe you can get her to move on by getting her to believe her children are waiting on the otherside. You can find many stories about wailing women. Look up the legend of La Llorona a story from Mexican folklore.

Ghosts,2iybz3,nevermore90038,5,Sat Oct 11 16:14:36 2014 UTC,Cool. $750k for a nearly abandoned building. Then all you have to do is spend a few million restoring it and hope that the town has enough traffic to make up for the loss in money.  I hardly ever trust people who sell places and claim they are haunted. I could sell my house right now and claim it is haunted - and then jack up the prices. I highly doubt that is an uncommon practice.  Anyone who claims a building to be haunted needs to prove it to me before I begin forking over extra dough. I am sure there are many people who lie about that in order to sell quickly/make more money. Be careful what you buy folks.

Ghosts,2iza58,joshuainthebox,1 point,Sun Oct 12 19:51:21 2014 UTC,Maybe because you should know some method to make the things work. For example I thought that a good idea can be talking to the objects in German or something like that

Ghosts,2iza58,Ghandithegman,1 point,Fri Oct 17 07:33:41 2014 UTC,"I don't know that there's a way to ""make them work.""  That's not really how spiritual attachment to an object works, and that sounds like you're trying to control something you don't know much about.. ALWAYS a dangerous move.  Are you trying to force an experience?  Or are you fearful something will happen?  Don't knock on a door if you don't know for sure who or what will answer.  However, I own some Nazi objects as a part of my personal historical collection and have never had any issues."
Ghosts,2iza58,Ghandithegman,1 point,Sun Oct 19 16:20:56 2014 UTC,"no problem. I'll never do dangerous things, as I said I'm only curious, I will never sacrifice a chicken in my living room, and I'll never cut on my breast a five edged star. I'll repeat myself but as I said I'm only curious, if anyone knows a story please tell me, it's funny and interesting, I believe in the power of suggestion. Does the ceremony to ""activate"" the object need blood? well I'll use rapes juice"
Ghosts,2iw4fh,MrsHellscreamer,2,Fri Oct 10 21:12:03 2014 UTC,"It's really hard because it's all in your head. There's no evidence and the human brain is very flawed - to the point where many cannot differentiate reality from illusion. What you describe will likely be classified as schizophrenia by a psychologist. The best thing you can do is talk to one. They can figure out what's happening. It could be real, it could be an issue with your brain. Either way, only someone qualified can really answer."
Ghosts,2iw4fh,snowbirdie,1 point,Fri Oct 10 22:23:40 2014 UTC,Sounds like you have the gift where you can see dead people. Theres groups where they take kids like this on retreat to help them understand this. People want to say it is a mental illness. Usually it takes the kid knowing something they should of never known about a deceased person to make them see otherwise.
Ghosts,2iw4fh,joshuainthebox,1 point,Fri Oct 10 22:32:10 2014 UTC,"Luckily i have no problem with this whether I am imagining it all or not. One thing I know for sure, I am not schizophrenic."

Ghosts,2iu6ig,OcmsRazor,1 point,Fri Oct 10 11:41:21 2014 UTC,"Ok, thank you. I am glad there is an explanation. I have never shared anything like this before. I don't believe in ghosts. We went on an underground tour of Edinburgh and I was the only one who had these lights coming towards me when I took pictures. Everyone in our group was asking me to do it again, even our guide. I thought it might be my phone, but it didn't happen after we left Edinburgh. My husband filmed the same things as me and didn't get any of that. It seemed the more I was interested, the faster these lights (dust I guess) would come. When I showed the videos to some of my friends and family, they encouraged me to share some of them. Being a direct descendant of most of the Kings of Scotland, and having Mary Queen of Scots as my 13th great grand aunt, had my family making me believe that's why it was only happening to me. Crazy, I know. Since this is a paranormal blog and anonymous, I felt compelled to share here. Thank you for your honest feedback."

Ghosts,2inhex,curiousSister,5,Wed Oct 8 11:46:47 2014 UTC,"This happened to my sister.  She was 12 and I was 10 at the time it happened. We were sitting at the dining room table playing cards (slap jack) and I was sitting with my back to the doorway, she was sitting across from me facing the doorway. All of the sudden her face froze and she was staring at the doorway behind me, she wouldn't move and wouldn't speak. I was getting scared so I asked her to please tell me what's wrong but she wouldn't. After about 2 mins it was like she snapped out of whatever trance she was in and started crying uncontrollably. I got her to calm down and she told me she seen someone standing in the doorway but they were so tall all she could see was the body from the chest down and that there was a really bright light surrounding them. I remember it so vividly even 20 years later but she has no memory of that day at all. Always been one of the scariest parts of my childhood."
Ghosts,2inhex,LeeshaG,2,Wed Oct 8 17:48:24 2014 UTC,Oh gosh that is terrifying!!
Ghosts,2inhex,MaidenMT,4,Thu Oct 9 08:36:45 2014 UTC,"My mother, older sister, and I were headed back to town at night, after visiting relatives. I was six-years-old. My favorite place to ride was in the back of our small hatchback car with my pillow and a blanket. I do remember looking at the stars out of the hatchback's back window. (Ah, the 1970's, before we really worried too much about unrestrained children in the car.)   My mother and sister tell this story, but I have no memory of this specific event - though I can remember things before it (our visit), and after it (having a sore throat from yelling), without any trouble. Apparently, as we were driving home over a mountain pass, one with the long concrete dividers separating the lanes of the interstate, I sat up in the very back of the car and said, ""He's coming."" My mom, who thought I might have just woken up from a dream said, ""No, everything's fine. We're almost home."" Then, I starting crawling over the back seat to get closer to my mom and sister yelling, ""He's coming! Pull over! Pull over, now! Mom, pull over, pull over!"" My mom was so concerned about my completely unexpected and erratic behavior, that she did pull over. She was turning around to comfort me when my sister yelled, ""Look! Look at that car!"" On our side of the interstate, on our side of the concrete dividers, was a white sedan with its headlights out, driving right down the middle of both lanes. The lanes that we had just exited because I had freaked out and started yelling at my mom to pull over. I don't remember any of this.   What I do remember is having a sore throat the next day and getting to stay home from school, play with my cat, drink tea (mostly lemon, hot water and honey), and watch Captain Kangaroo and Scooby Doo - a rare event. It's fascinating to me that something so visceral, so scary, is completely absent from my memory. I only know of it second hand and, apparently, it happened to me. Still gives me the chills to think about what might have happened if my mom had doubted me."
Ghosts,2inhex,triplej63,4,Wed Oct 8 19:48:37 2014 UTC,Wow! That's so strange but great as you saved everyone from a terrible accident.
Ghosts,2inhex,triplej63,1 point,Thu Oct 9 08:37:36 2014 UTC,"You sound like my sister. I have really good long term memory and remember things way back when I was like 3, 4, 5 years old. I'm 51 now. I'll be reminiscing about an event and bringing it up will make everyone in the family remember... except this one sister. She remembers nothing about it. So it could be something like that, if you generally don't remember things from your childhood that others do.  Or it could be that the event was so traumatic to you that your mind blocked it out. Do the other family members tell you that you seemed fearful at the time?"
Ghosts,2inhex,analogvulcan,1 point,Wed Oct 8 15:45:50 2014 UTC,I would probably guess the latter as I remember everything else about the holiday for the 2 weeks but nothing that happened inside the caravan.  My parents and sister say I was terrified along with them.  I think it's crazy how my brain has blocked it out to thoroughly.
Ghosts,2inhex,analogvulcan,5,Wed Oct 8 15:59:43 2014 UTC,"I was raped when I was a teen. He was a friend of my friends. At the time, I knew his name, I knew him on sight, I knew a lot about him. Now, I don't remember anything about him. It scares me that my brain does this, since as I said, my long term memory is excellent. But, I think it may be some sort of protective mechanism, so that a person is able to move on from traumatic and frightening things that happen to them."

There was also a short period after my grandfather died that I would apparently say I ""talked to bapa last night"" and would be talking to nobody. It lasted a short while and I have no memory of either events. But when I was around 13 I remember seeing something ridiculously illogical and I remember it's weird mass and how I'd never seen anything like it, but not... necessarily in the deepest detail?

Ghosts,2inhex,worsttxmistake,1 point,Thu Oct 9 15:38:52 2014 UTC,"Hasn't happened to me but my cousin. One night at a sleep over with my cousin we decided to do a spell out of a book she found at the library. I was about 11-12 we do a spell for a ""tommy knocker"" and I thought nothing of that. Thought oh it didn't work. We went and sat down in the living room and I got up to go get a drink my cousin was sitting on the left side of the couch I walked back into the living room. I got in the middle of the room (the lights dimmed and these are lights not made to dim) I was already facing my cousin but her face changed and she spoke in a deep manly voice in another language. I have no clue what it said but it was only a sentence and then the lights went back to normal and my cousin was wondering why I was standing in the middle of the room. She doesn't remember that happening to her but I remember how the shadows on her face gave her a dark look and the voice that came out was to deep for her to pretend without sounding fake. I know it was a dumb thing to open that book and read from it not knowing what we were doing. I regret doing that that night because I think there isa darkness that lingers around me."

Ghosts,2imaeh,hyena419,7,Wed Oct 8 01:37:35 2014 UTC,"The Ovilus is just a random word generator. The claim is that the device can recognize changes in the environment, and choose words based on the results. That would be just fine if we knew what changes in environment a ghost might make when selecting words that he/she wants to say. Obviously though, we do not.   The Ovilus is basically just a parlor trick."

Ghosts,2imaeh,snowbirdie,2,Wed Oct 8 01:48:43 2014 UTC,I prefer the EchoVox app over any Ovilus. Better results and it's only $20.
Ghosts,2imaeh,baron4406,3,Wed Oct 8 04:32:33 2014 UTC,"So how they supposedly work is the spirit uses their ability to manipulate EMF to choose a word. But guess what - your phone emits high EMF, thereby negating any use of the app. It would have to operate in a white room or faraday bag to be useful in any way. But let me tell you, as a programmer, you just pull the value of some random number generator or sensor and spew out some randomly mapped word. Idiots will buy it. Profit!"

There isn't any motion blur since I wasn't moving and I was the only person down there when I took the photo.   It was in the basement.  When I took the photo I was the only person down there and I wasn't moving so it couldn't be motion blur.  Everyone else was to freaked out to come down.   Whenever I took the photo there was a strange light on the ground (as you can see) but in person I couldn't see the light.  I also didn't have the flash on.  When I got home uploaded the photo is when I notice the face above the light.  When I edited the photo I thought it was two different ghost but now I believe it's just one.
Ghosts,2i78x2,snapper1971,7,Fri Oct 3 17:34:45 2014 UTC,"As a photographer I can definitely say that image has motion blur, most likely caused by a slight wobble during the exposure, which due to the lighting conditions would be a little longer to allow for more light to reach the sensor."
Ghosts,2i78x2,bowhunter6274,1 point,Sat Oct 4 12:29:49 2014 UTC,So you think that light on the floor is from exposure?  I didn't use a flash to take that picture and there was no light on the floor after or before the picture.  I think you are right about the face.  Those were taken in 2009 or 2010 and the camera I was using was from 2006 maybe 2007 so it wasn't the best.

One of my employees thought it was strange and had noticed some unexplained event in the building such as items falling off of shelves and walls when no one was around. She wanted me to check the video and this is what I found. I don't have an explanation, so the video has to speak for itself."

Ghosts,2i3hhu,coldplane,3,Thu Oct 2 15:40:23 2014 UTC,"Sadly, the entire description of the investigation that this team did revolves around orbs, and not much else. It's pretty well known that orbs are not paranormal. They have a scientific explanation, and are completely reproduceable. The fact that this team is presenting orbs as evidence tells us that they aren't very credible.  If I could give you a bit of advice, I'd recommend that you find a more reputable team to come in and investigate your location."
Ghosts,2i3hhu,OcmsRazor,2,Thu Oct 2 16:05:29 2014 UTC,"Most investigators are just idiots who want to have fun and mimic what they see on TV. Find people with science or engineering degrees - they can critically think. People who have credibility in the field are almost non-existent. Heck, find anyone who has nothing to gain by lying.   Any group that posts orbs should be immediately disallowed to do any investigations. There needs to be a certification and controlled academic organization. In reality, an investigation is all about being able to understand physics, photography, engineering, etc to explain what other people simply are ignorant about."
Ghosts,2i3hhu,coldplane,1 point,Thu Oct 2 23:23:25 2014 UTC,The way the pillow was sailing through the air was a rolling motion. If it was staged and was pulled it should have stayed still while in mid flight.

Ghosts,2i0qe0,cj5,4,Wed Oct 1 20:37:48 2014 UTC,"Very creepy to listen to. But I honestly think it's fake.   The production is a bit too clear and well-made. With the woman (women?) chanting, you can clearly hear her take a breath at times, and the wailing sounds way too consistent, like a pre-recorded sample. The timing, atmosphere and placement of noises is even spread throughout, not the maddening randomness of ""typical"" EVPs.  Still, pretty cool."

Ghosts,2hxblc,SpiritualSerin,2,Tue Sep 30 20:45:45 2014 UTC,"If this is a paranormal situation, be forewarned that many entities use sound in a deceptive manner, primarily to unnerve and frighten.  In your case, the knocking may have sounded exactly like it was coming from one location, when in fact an entity was imparting that to you.  I have seen this in action myself on several occasions and it is remarkable.  I would begin by asking whatever is making the noise, to leave you alone and leave entirely.  Ask with a tone of respect and patience, over a period of at least one week, once a day.  Also let it know you are being frightened and ask it to stop doing that.  This is very simple, straight-forward approach yet it can yield excellent results.  I strongly urge you to try this before trying more elaborate or forceful approaches to stopping the activity."

Ghosts,2hwpi3,OcmsRazor,2,Tue Sep 30 18:24:56 2014 UTC,"Posted this the other day on r/askreddit -   This is a collection of happenings. In 1989 my family bought the village store in a small former slate mining village in mid-Wales. It was originally built to house miners in the 1600s but was converted into the village shop/post office in the early 1900s. Downstairs was split into two, the shop was in one room and the old post office was in the other room. The stairs were in the post office and led up to the kitchen/dining room. Then you had two bedrooms above the shop and the bathroom at the far end. One day my Mum and I were alone in the property. My brother and sister were next door playing pool in the local pub with my Dad. All the doors and windows in the shop were closed, when suddenly what I can only describe as a gust of wind materialised in the shop blowing past my mum behind the shop counter, past me towards the post office and presumably up the stairs, because the next thing we knew there was a sound of smashing glass as the window in the far bedroom was blown out. My Dad suddenly appeared from next door asking who smashed the bedroom window, so my Mum explained to him what happened. That incident freaked us out. It wasn’t long after that my parents had to close the shop as there was not enough trade to make it a viable business. The shop then became the living room. Several times, the entire family would be sat down stairs when suddenly, as clear as day we’d hear footsteps upstairs, walking from the kitchen/dining room side (which at this point had been converted into a bedroom) all the way into the bedroom at the far end. My Dad said he’d quite often hear the footsteps in the day when he was alone in the house. On top of that we all felt a weird presence emanating from the room above the post office. I would refuse to go upstairs on my own because I felt like something evil was looking at me from that room. So, my parents decided to completely renovate the house, rip up all the floor boards, strip all the plaster off the walls and start again. Around this time our beloved Old English Sheepdog died. She was 13 so pretty old for that breed and she really struggled to get up the narrow stairs and would stumble on them. Part of the renovation involved ripping out those stairs and replacing them with nice large modern stairs relocated in the living room. Well, at night my parents would hear our dead dog still stumbling trying to get up the old stairs that were no longer there. She had a chain collar and my parents said they could distinctly hear it jingling and clonking on the stairs. Weird. Things would also go missing only to reappear exactly where they were supposed to be. One notable incident was with the catering sized pot of Marmite which should have been on the dining room table. My sister and my Mum removed everything from the table looking for it. Ready to give up and accept that they couldn't have Marmite on their toast, the pot just reappeared in the middle of the table. Now these pots are about the size of a large tin of paint, so you can’t just overlook them. So, to cut a long story short, after the renovation and the old miner’s boots were removed from underneath the floorboards, nothing else ever happened and I actually really miss that house, as we moved to England in 1999."
Ghosts,2hwpi3,Spinaldeath5000,2,Tue Sep 30 18:35:43 2014 UTC,"I am part of a paranormal investigating team.  Two recent events that happened to me that I cannot explain both happened during investigations.    First, we are in an old hospital.  The building was originally built in 190? (six, I think) and was a TB hospital, asylum and then as a home for mentally ill/disabled persons.  The location is fairly isolated and there are no houses close by.  All over the place, I keep hearing voices.  The voices aren't clear and don't address me directly, but all night long, I could hear people talking as if someone had left a television on in the next room.  No one had a radio on, no cell phones in use, no televisions - the place didn't even have electricity.    Second, was a similar occurrence, but there were four of us present.  We are in another different old hospital.  Two floors have been renovated for use and others are still undergoing renovation.  There are five floors total.  Four of us are on one of the floors being renovated. We are walking down a long hallway when suddenly - music!  It's not very loud, but we can all clearly hear people singing and a piano accompanying.  Like an old fashioned sing along.  None of us recognize the tune.    Again, there was no radio, no television.  Although not completely isolated, there was no one outside within the vicinity (it was like 2 in the morning).  That floor did not have electricity due to the construction going on.    Sometimes, one person will hear something and then everyone else will ""hear it too.""  In this case, we were all four walking to the staircase at the opposite end of the hall and we all stopped at the same time.  We were still for several seconds until someone said ""What do you hear?""  Someone else said ""singing"" and then someone else said ""I hear a piano.""  What I heard is exactly as I described, an old piano accompanying several voices singing a song."
Ghosts,2hwpi3,Maxwyfe,2,Wed Oct 1 18:50:19 2014 UTC,"I moved with my boyfriend to take care of his elderly parents. His father died a couple of months after we got there. I was walking down the hallway and on my way back I look into his mothers room as she sleeps with the door open. It's about 3 in the morning two days after his death. His mom is sleeping in her bed but there was a man watching her sleep. I could only see a white mist in the shape of a man. He had one hand on her leg he looked at me and disappeared I shook my head like I was imagining something. I also heard him call out "" My love"" from her room. My boyfriends mom said she felt him a lot and heard him too. Shortly after my boyfriends dad passed his cat smoky ran away and I saw what I believe to be smoky's ghost in the bathroom that has only a door no windows and smokey was gone for weeks by the time I saw this cat that looked like him sitting in the bathroom. I am raised on native american beliefs and we believe a spirit can take a animal into the otherworld with them. After my grandpa died his cat got very sick with a tumor and died about a year later. My uncle told us to watch out for he might take her. My grandpa was a cat lover."

Sometimes when im going up and downstairs at nighti feel like im being watched and that some ones there also while im going back up I feel like something is chasing me up the stairs  like when I look back im going to the a black figure at the bottom. And the most un explainable of all, my parents dont like to waste power so everything downstairs is always off when no one is home, one morning I woke up hearing voices from downstairs  maybe it was the tv?

To help defend that the tv wasn't on after we saw this pic, I took the same tv and camera and took pictures with it on and off and it didn't look the same. This picture is probably late 90s early 2000s and you can clearly see I scanned the pic in on my computer.i don't have time to stage things."

Ghosts,2hbrr3,tym05,15,Wed Sep 24 13:11:26 2014 UTC,"The problem is that there are computer programs that are readily available and extremely simple to use that allow people to manipulate photos, videos and audio. This makes it very difficult to determine if a piece of evidence is legitimate or fabricated.   The only evidence that I personally find credible is evidence that I've personally gathered, or evidence gathered by my colleagues that I know are trustworthy. This works both ways though. I could present a piece of evidence that I know is credible and compelling, but since you do not know me or my credibility, you might not find it compelling, and might even think I've presented evidence that I've fabricated.  Another thing to consider is that our eyes and our minds play tricks on us. Pareidolia and imagination often make people believe that they've captured compelling evidence, when in reality, there is a perfectly natural explanation for what they've captured.  To answer your question, I have seen photos on the internet that I find compelling, but as far as photos that I strongly believe are actual photos of ghosts, no. I've not seen any."
Ghosts,2hbrr3,Jack_Shid,2,Wed Sep 24 13:31:19 2014 UTC,"I totally agree with this. Whether or not something is really a ""ghost"" can never be proven or known, but you can only know the authenticity of photos you have taken yourself and others you know well. Only you know the conditions of the area before and after the photo, also. So only you would know that there truly wasn't anyone else in the room, or there wasn't a light there, etc."
Ghosts,2hbrr3,Sparkyriker,2,Wed Sep 24 14:14:34 2014 UTC,This right here. We can't trust any evidence that we ourselves haven't gathered because of how easy it is to manipulate photos these days. I could snap a picture and add a ghostly figure or lights in about a minute.  It's really hard to find anything remotely credible.

No. Regular cameras ""aren't magical"" and a majority of people seem to lack basic education on how camera sensors work (lens flares, long exposures, flash, etc).

Ghosts,2hbrr3,BarelyReal,2,Wed Sep 24 18:21:22 2014 UTC,"It's hard to define an image as being of a ""real"" ghost when you have an almost impossible time proving that ghosts are in fact real.

Ghosts,2hbrr3,littleoldcat,3,Mon Sep 29 15:51:22 2014 UTC,"There is no photo which someone cannot ""debunk"" by merely insisting that it's fake.

I had to erase them cause if my wife would have seen them she would have wanted me to sell the house.  I set up a camera in my master bathroom. The light had been turning on by itself so I wanted to see if I could catch anything.  On one of them I caught a little kid peaking from the master bedroom towards the bathroom where the camera was set. I caught the light going on And also a light at the corner of the walk in closet.  Moreover, I caught energy going from the closet to the master bedroom and back. The house has been quiet for a while so I think I kicked it out."

There are dozens of videos on YouTube showing that the flashlights that twist on and off will heat up and  if placed just barely on, will turn themselves off.

Put your foot down and lay down the law to whatever it is that is hanging around your home.  If you want it out, then tell it in no uncertain terms to GET OUT!  If you don't really mind it being there but just want it to leave you alone, tell it that it can stay as long as it doesn't interfere in your life or in the lives of anyone else who lives with you.

You said this has been happening for three months. Is that when you moved into the apartment? Or did this start happening after you've lived there awhile?  The feeling of being watched you get. What kind of emotions come with it? Anxiousness? Uncomfortableness? Annoyance?  You may want to consider x-posting to /r/thetruthishere as the community there seems a bit more active and it's catered to real life stories/experiences.

I get anxious, but I convince myself that it's just my imagination. I got annoyed when I still thought this was just me, but as soon as I saw that I wasn't in complete control, the scale tipped and I lost it. It was definitely very scary. Sometimes I get chills when I walk from the living room and through the hallway, but again I try to rationalise because often times I'll be thinking ""what if??"" when I get up to do whatever.

You can also use a wand to create a seal against negative energies.  Near each entrance to your home sketch a pentacle near each of these entrances.  Also put a line of salt by the doors.

If a fly or something got in, it could have been trying to catch it. This happens in my place with my cats, they'll crash up and down the stairs, into cabinets, and generally make an ungodly ruckus.    Are you sure the creaking was directly going up the stairs and into 1 room, or were you noticing a pattern with many creaks and pieced them together to make sense? Identifying the exact location of a sound is actually pretty hard.    The smoke alarms could be bugs getting into the house (happens at least once a year in my parent's place), or if they're connected directly to the house they will sound off for a bit after a power surge, or they could have an issue. Maybe check the batteries. Overall I don't think you have anything to lose sleep over, but it could help you to keep a notepad going of different events you experience, and any real world solutions you find."

The only way he could get back in and out was either the door and window but we have all of them tightly shut.  I could hear the creaking in series, one after the other for each step. Maybe it didn't stop directly in the room but it stopped at the top of the stairs (which is right next to the room) I used to life in another house that would creak on occasion but the creaks never continued like this did.  There is a lot of bugs that hang out near the house though. Its almost as if the house was in the forest. Bugs could have been the cause of the smoke alarms."
Ghosts,2h05pb,snowbirdie,0,Sun Sep 21 19:40:37 2014 UTC,"So it's a story where you are the only witness?  Humans are subjective, not objective.  We have no way of telling if you were hallucinating, having a frontal lobe seizure, or asleep. It doesn't sound like you did any critical thinking to troubleshoot, you just panicked and called someone.  The smoke detectors went off for a reason - was there smoke? Were they carbon monoxide level detectors? It's possible that those went off and because the carbon monoxide levels were high, you hallucinated.  Most paranormal groups have a carbon monoxide detector because many paranormal cases have been solved due to the person living in a location that had high levels and was causing them to hallucinate."
Ghosts,2h05pb,classicrocker883,1 point,Sun Sep 21 04:58:11 2014 UTC,The smoke detectors had new batteries in them. We had moved into the house just a couple months before this happened. I was not asleep because I already had already gotten dressed had breakfast seen the whole family leave for school and was working on my homework.  carbon monoxide levels could be the cause. Is there anything that would temporarily produce carbon monoxide levels and then stop after only a few minutes? Maybe I can pin point what exactly caused a possible hallucination.
Ghosts,2h05pb,interfreak,1 point,Sun Sep 21 19:34:32 2014 UTC,"are these connected? as the new ones are, like if one goes off so does the other to warn you. so you heard the creaking as you were looking at where it was coming? like you would have seen someone walking except nothing was there but creaks. so i would say check any sort of object that a spirit might have attached to. it can have an odd strong musky odor, and beware of the dark, they love closets and dark spaces. make sure your bedroom isnt shared with things that go bump in the night"

Ghosts,2gt4s7,RelaxedBeing,17,Thu Sep 18 23:12:19 2014 UTC,"It's hard to prove any video as legit. It's too easy to fake media, which only leads to more skepticism.  Personally, I find the San Pedro haunting to be pretty intriguing. Not much is caught on tape, but many strange things do seem to happen.  The most compelling part is that every person involved have yet to change their story - even twenty years after the fact. That is either serious dedication to a lie, or something strange truly did happen.  Here is a pretty good documentary on the haunting: An Unknown Encounter. http://youtu.be/dwSIczexst0"

Ghosts,2gt4s7,BlackSparkle13,3,Fri Sep 19 17:19:49 2014 UTC,Did you happen to catch the Paranormal Witness episode on that case? I think about a year before it aired I saw this documentary and I was interested to see their take on it. The guy who was hung in the attic didn't participate in the Paranormal Witness episode though.
Ghosts,2gt4s7,ibuprophete,3,Tue Sep 23 05:17:18 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, I have yet to watch a single episode of Paranormal Witness. I should probably go watch episode now.  As for Barry Conrad not being on the show was... Well, I'll let Jackie explain it:  http://forums.syfy.com/index.php?showtopic=2360883  *BEING ROBBED IN THE PARANORMAL  Some of you may know my name, Jackie Hernandez, as the lady who was beset by an intensely violent poltergeist/haunting outbreak in San Pedro from 1989 to 1993.  You may have heard of, or seen, the two videos my story was told in: “An Unknown Encounter” and “California’s Most Haunted”. Some of you may have just witnessed my recent appearance on SyFy’s “Paranormal Witness”.  These paranormal encounters made my life a living hell for almost four years and it was near impossible to raise two children as a single mother in the midst of this chaos, but I did the best I could.  What you do not know is how I was used, abused, mistreated and literally robbed of promised money contracted to me by filmmaker Barry Conrad who wrote, produced and directed the two aforementioned videos.  Barry Conrad gave me an agreement/contract early on in his documentation of my case, wherein he agreed to pay me ten percent (10%) of all money made of his video(s) and eventual book pertaining to his investigation and chronicling of my experiences.  Each of his videos had numerous airings on the Sci Fi channel beginning in April of 2003, as well as sales into foreign markets and at numerous paranormal conferences Conrad regularly attends. I’m sure his book sales have been brisk as well.  By all accounting, Barry Conrad has paid me less than six tenths of one percent (0.6%) of the money he’s made off me over the last fifteen years. He was well aware of my being a single mother raising two young children on her own and how the protracted haunting took its toll on both my family and me.  What kind of person takes advantage of another in such a terrible situation? Doesn’t he have any feelings about his making a small fortune off me, while throwing me a bone?  I feel as though Barry Conrad has financially raped me, as he was so nice and friendly while shooting his videos over the years and repeatedly promising to pay me what he agreed to.  I’ve repeatedly tried contacting Barry Conrad regarding his breach of contract and he refuses to answer his phone or return any emails or conventional mail sent to him.  All I want is what’s contractually and rightfully owed to me by Barry Conrad. What kind of a man turns around and slaps a friend in the face and then stabs her in the back  when it comes to money? Conrad is a very successful and well-respected cameraman with his company Bar Con Video Productions, but not a very honorable or sincere man.  In pure legal terms, Barry Conrad is guilty of breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation, unfair competition, unjust enrichment and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  With the online dissemination of this story, perhaps Barry Conrad will finally live up to his own contract and stop ignoring me. Do the right and fair thing Barry, it’s about time to finally be responsible.*"

Ghosts,2gt4s7,MoonMonsoon,4,Fri Sep 19 17:29:47 2014 UTC,"As grainy and low-quality as that video is, it could be absolutely anything. Could be hunters, or pranksters, or a herd of elk. Calling it paranormal is wishful thinking at best.  EDIT: This video was posted to youtube in 2006. There was plenty of editing software available in 2006, though I do not believe it was used here. I think there is a natural explanation for everything in this video."
Ghosts,2gt4s7,Dan_Droid,3,Fri Sep 19 17:39:53 2014 UTC,"I agree with /u/Dan_Droid on this. This could be a number of things. Poachers, wildlife, jackasses messing with people who were out there.  Too many variables exist for this do be conclusive proof."

Ghosts,2gt4s7,Dan_Droid,4,Sat Sep 20 12:46:40 2014 UTC,"So this was the thought process that lead you to leap straight from some possible things that it could be all the way to it being ghosts? This is what is wrong with the paranormal field these days. Consider a couple possibilities, and when they don't pan out, it has got to be paranormal.   You didn't even take the video, so I'm not sure why you're going to such great lengths to defend it.   Hunting is not allowed, so there's no hunters    If you truly believe that this is true, then I do not believe you grew up in the wilderness. Hunters are everywhere in the wilderness, and often couldn't care less if hunting is allowed or not. Pot is not allowed in 48 states right now, so obviously nobody is smoking pot in those states, right?  Animals often move slowly. I have spent the last 47 years in the Rocky Mountains, and I can tell you that wildlife only moves quickly a fraction of the time, usually when feeding or mating."

CCTVs do not have an automatic focus. They are designed for far focal points. To fake it would be extremely easy and footage almost identical to this has been reproduced/debunked in Fact or Faked fairly well.

Ghosts,2gmcuv,Winnychan,29,Wed Sep 17 02:00:38 2014 UTC,"There are fantastic ghost stories in my immediate family, eye-witnessed by my mother and grandmother. A house they owned in Michigan was haunted by two kindly spinsters who had lived there previously and loved the house more than life itself. In fact, the only reason my mom and grandma were able to move into the house at all was because these two old ladies wanted them to have it!             Originally they were only touring the house for fun and out of curiosity. They couldn't actually afford it. The man who took them on the tour said it had to be lived in as a residence and mustn't be torn down to build anything commercial. And there were some weird specifications, such as ""the previous owners ask that you hang a red wreath in every window at Christmas"". He hinted that these stipulations were scaring away some buyers, but my grandma was in love with the beautiful house and sincerely agreed that red wreaths in the windows would look lovely. Another potential buyer arrived and the man left my mom and grandma to explore the house and think it over. They had seen most of it and my mom asked if they should leave. My grandmother got this weird, dazed look on her face and said no... no, not yet. There was something she needed to see. And she went racing back up the stairs with my mom following in confusion, and back into one of the bedrooms they had already toured. She was muttering under her breath softly, 'It's here... it's right here."" She went to the closet and threw it open. It was empty except for an old fashioned garment bag, the long zippered kind, big enough that it would hold a dress with a full skirt. My grandma quickly unzips this and finds it also is empty. Then she reaches into the bag and pulls out the false bottom. The entire bottom of the bag is lined with gleaming silver coins.               I don't know exactly what mint they were, but mom could see at a glance that they were very old. My mom is freaking out, especially because my grandma is very catholic. But at the moment she is calmly scooping up these strange coins and putting them into her purse. My mom grabs her hand and hisses, ""Mom! It'd be stealing. We can't just take these!"" My grandma stops and looks at her. ""Normally I would say that it's a sin, but. I don't know how to explain it to you, sweetheart. These are a gift. We were meant to have this house.""               And they were. They took the coins and sold them to a dealer for more than enough to purchase the house. And there were plenty of creaks and groans, little instances of things moving, cabinets closing, objects being re-arranged and what have you. But the spinsters remained a benevolent presence, more guardians than angry or spooky ghosts. There were even a few more times when the family ran into financial difficulty and my grandmother got that unfocused look on her face and suddenly ""found"" more cached treasure.                   My mom looked into the story of how the spinsters died. The first died naturally in the house, but the second was quite a tale. She said that the house caught fire due to an accident with the deep burner. Part of her dress and also some of the curtains caught fire. Instead of working to extinguish her own clothes she ran into the study, called 911 on the rotary phone, and said, ""Help, help, you've got to save my house!"" Then she ran out the front door into the snow and died.                One day in the middle of cooking and talking with my mom, my grandma stops mid-sentence and looks up at a picture on the wall. It was a picture of the house hanging inside of the house, which is kind of weird, but it looked nice and they had never disturbed it before. Suddenly my grandma gets that look in her eye, which is now familiar to my mom, and mom is hoping maybe they are going to get another windfall as she reaches up for the picture and takes it off the wall. They flipped it over, but there was no money this time. It was the letter I linked originally, both a poem and plea to God, written by one of the two ladies."

Ghosts,2gcqv5,Ahsinoei,2,Sun Oct 26 00:18:39 2014 UTC,"Something I kind of just remembered that happened to me when I was a little older, around 14 or 15.  A friend of mine and I were messing around with the Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven."" We were singing it forward into a mic on the computer and playing it in reverse to hear the satanic lyrics backwards. We did this a couple of times and then my brother from the story above wanted to do it. He sang it and then we played it backward and when it got to the last part the lights in the entire city went out. We all start freaking out and go to Wal-Mart. My brother and friend buy some movie (I believe it was House of a Thousand Corpses just to mess with me).   When we were coming back in my brothers truck I notice that there is a strange noise coming through the background radio static. It was like someone speaking but it was all warped and distorted to the point it sounded like they were speaking backwards. Again, we all freak out and change the radio station and the other ones were fine. We go back to the one that had the crazy voice coming through and it's back to normal.   We arrive back home and I run to the nearest bible and start reading verses out loud because I'm scared to death at this point. After a little while the power comes back on and everything was back to normal.  This may have all been coincidence but still pretty freaky, at least I think."
Ghosts,2gcqv5,PajamaShazama,2,Mon Sep 15 23:38:55 2014 UTC,"I had a similar experience. I was living with my brother and his boyfriend in a condo in a suburb of the city in which I live. I was working earlier shifts than both of them, so I would wake up at 4am and sometimes 3am (during the holiday season) to arrive at work on time, after having prepared and everything.  Some background on the condo community: it is a rural area that is quickly becoming a suburban city, and there are a couple of very well known companies headquartered there. There was a big condo boom after the recession, so the condo in which I was staying was pretty much brand new. Outside of this little condo community, there wasn't much of anything at all. Most of the people that live in the condo community are young professionals, and we know that there was no one with teenaged kids. This background is fairly important to the story.  So it was around 3:30am and I was getting ready to head out, after having showered and eaten breakfast. It's the middle of winter in Ohio, which can get pretty cold. There was fresh snow on the ground and it was probably a good -4C (25F) outside. I walk up to the door, which has windows on it, and see a drunken teenage kid (probably around 17 or 18) on the driveway, holding a brownbag with what I assume is some liquor (too fat to be a beer bottle?) in his left hand, and he is dressed head to toe in what looks like a tuxedo. He took one step backward in a sort of stumbling motion.  After that quick glance which lasted all of three seconds, I moved out of the way of the door so that he didn't notice me (he was looking away from the house when I saw him, but I still didn't want him to notice me.) Then I thought to myself, ""No, I should probably help him. It'll make me late for work, but small price to pay for helping out a lost drunk kid."" So then I look out the window again, and he is completely gone.  I consider my self an extremely rational person...I've watched pretty much every episode possible of every scary reality show and all of the scary movies, and I always want to be scared, but I can usually always explain everything away. That wasn't the case with this situation...and here's why: given that there was fresh snow on the ground and there were ZERO footprints where this drunk dude was standing, and there were ZERO footprints leading to anywhere to or from the driveway where he was standing. The only footprints that were around were the ones that I was about to make as I moved from the doorway to the driveway, then to my car. There were no kids or teenagers that lived anywhere near the condo complex, and Ohio doesn't usually have proms on a Tuesday night in the middle of the winter (it usually happens around June or so, when everyone is graduating). There was no humanly possible way that someone could disappear so quickly (within the ten seconds it took me to gather my thoughts after seeing him initially.) I am a morning person, so no, I was not groggy at 3:30am. I was ready to take on the day.  A couple of other weird things happened after and before I moved into the condo complex with my brother and his boyfriend; a woman about our age had walked into some nearby woods and shot herself in the head. After about two years after I had moved out of the condo, one of the floor leads (manager of sorts) with whom I had worked was killed at the intersection right next to the condo complex due to his intoxicated state, while driving.  I'm not saying any of those instances were connected. Just stating facts.  Regardless, my rational, logical mind cannot explain what I saw that morning, as harmless as it was. I'll leave it up to you to interpret what/who it may have been.  TL;DR - Saw drunk prom dude ghost once.  ETA a little more detail."

I hesitated if I should grab my gun but just jumped up and looked, the hallway and the rest of the house was dark. I turned on all the lights and looked around, nothing."

We keep a baby gate up at night because he likes to go into the kitchen and get into things, but we also want to keep our bedroom door open because it gets too stuffy if we don't. One night I woke up to him at the baby gate, looking out into the living area, and growling. He never growls. Ever. Then he started backing up like whatever it was, was coming closer to him. I was expecting to see something come through the doorway any moment. The only way to describe how I felt was numb. Then my hair stood up and I got a really weird chill over my body. It was pretty terrifying for me. Finally my husband woke up because his growling had become that loud (I was too frozen to even make a move to wake him at that point), and went to check things out, he didn't find anything but I, nor my dog, went back to sleep that night."

It was taken on Sunday, 8/17/97, and we think the man behind her is my grandpa who passed away on Sunday, 8/14/84.  We did not notice the man in the picture until Christmas Day, 2000 (granny had since passed away), while browsing through some loose family photos at my parents' house. My sister thought it was such a nice picture of granny that she even made a copy for mom, but still, nobody noticed the man behind her for over three years! When I arrived at my parents' house that Christmas day, my sister handed me the picture and said, ""Who do you think this man behind granny looks like?"" It took a few seconds for it to sink in.

Ghosts,2g2kno,Donner1701,2,Thu Sep 11 22:58:21 2014 UTC,"info;  A set of photos taken in the O'Hare Mansion in Greencastle, Indiana, showing the ghost that became known as the Pink Lady of Greencastle. The photo above was taken by Guy Winters during a paranormal investigation in O’Hare Mansion in Greencastle, Indiana. It came to be called “The Pink Lady of Greencastle,” owing its name to the ghostly figure of a lady seemingly lit by a pinkish glow.  A friend told Winters that he and his girlfriend had a scary encounter with a ghostly entity during an attempt to have a tryst in the abandoned property. So, Winters, along with another friend Terry and a team of paranormal investigators, explored the O’Hare Mansion upon being granted permission by the property’s owner.  Armed with VHS video cameras and simple flash cameras, Winters and his group began documenting their search for several days. Finally, the group began to feel something spooky during one of their night visits. While some of his companions covered the interior of the ruined mansion, Winters started taking photos of the windows and doorways outside. He did not recall seeing anything, but when the film was developed, there it was: the vapory but also visible figure of a lady staring out from one of the windows. She is believed to be the ghost of Irene O’Hare.  The fourth frame on the lower right shows a screenshot from the analysis done on one of the photos snapped by Winters, showing something distinctly skull-like. The verdict of the photographic expert? The figure of the Pink Lady was registered on the film and was not caused by a camera malfunction or questionable activity.  http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/10/25/creepiest-ghost-photos-ever-the-pink-lady-of-greencastle  http://paranormal.about.com/od/ghostphotos/ig/Best-Ghost-Photos/The-Pink-Lady-of-Greencastle-picture.htm  http://www.ghosthauntings.org/Pink_Lady_Of_Greencastle.html"

It's fun to wonder about the spirit difference between humans and animals. What about ghost deer? I'm rambling, this is great. Thanks for sharing!"
Ghosts,2g1npe,mark_bellhorn,2,Wed Sep 10 21:53:39 2014 UTC,"Orbs are known in the field of photography as backscatter. The term backscatter in photography refers to light from a flash or strobe reflecting back from particles passing very near to the lens's field of view causing specks of light to appear in the photo. This gives rise to what are sometimes referred to as orb artifacts. Photographic backscatter can result from snowflakes, rain or mist, or airborne dust. Due to the size limitations of the modern compact and ultra-compact cameras, especially digital cameras, the distance between the lens and the built-in flash has decreased, thereby decreasing the angle of light reflection to the lens and increasing the likelihood of light reflection off normally sub-visible particles. Hence, the orb artifact is commonplace with small digital or film camera photographs."
Ghosts,2g1npe,OcmsRazor,1 point,Thu Sep 11 14:23:16 2014 UTC,"Huh, never realized this. Thanks for the info!  So, are all pictures of orbs then just pictures of dust/rain/snowflakes, etc?"
Ghosts,2g1npe,OcmsRazor,2,Thu Sep 11 15:17:34 2014 UTC,"Well, that depends on who you ask. I believe that all orbs are explainable, mainly because I can recreate them intentionally anytime I want by pounding my hand on a couch cushion and taking a flash photo. If I can recreate something that easily, I will dismiss it.   There are still people that believe that orbs in photographs are paranormal, even though they can be recreated, and have a scientific explanation. I do not share that belief."

Unless you have specialized equipment on hand that could detect actual air flow rate, you cannot say there was no draft.   Someone could've opened a door upstairs and it created a suction that would slam the door downstairs. There could've been a slight breeze outside that caused suction through an open window upstairs.

Ghosts,2fqnys,Words_of_Nelim,4,Mon Sep 8 11:23:45 2014 UTC,"“There is also the emotional motivation for these beliefs,” French says. “The vast majority of us don’t like the idea of our own mortality. Even though we find the idea of ghosts and spirits scary, in a wider context, they provide evidence for the survival of the soul.”   i see this line of reasoning so much and it just has never made any sense to me. I'd think that most people who believe in ghosts feel that way because they've had an experience themselves with an unseen entity or something happened with no ready explanation or clear cause, not because they want to think they (or a loved one) will be trapped on earth for millennia.  Why would anyone take any kind of comfort in that, wandering lonely and mute in some in-between existence for Christ knows how long, coming apart at the seams like a schizo in solitary? It's like Groundhog Day as imagined by David Lynch. Like being buried alive in time.  If that were the only evidence for the survival of the soul, that would be Lovecraft-level terrifying.

I could be wrong, but I think it was determined that it was created by a person who has a ""horror short"" youtube channel.   My first indication that it's a hoax is that the security camera is aimed directly at a single door, coincidentally the door where the ""paranormal activity"" is happening, instead of down the hall as it would be in a hotel. Security cameras have to cover as much area as possible, so why would it be aimed directly at a single door? For this to be real, there would be an individual camera aimed at every single door in the hotel."

Ghosts,2fhvaz,SpiritualSerin,3,Thu Sep 4 22:09:31 2014 UTC,"If this situation is paranormal, and it sounds as such, you don't know much about this entity.  That's normal at this point.  But to give you some context and a bit of insight, I assure you the noises you hear are made by the entity but not quite how you might imagine.  Sounds are typically ""projected"" to places by the being and they can sound utterly real.  Was there something in your neighbor's apartment overhead?  I think that's doubtful, based on my experience.  This entity has been in your space all this time but is using its abilities to frighten you by projecting sounds wherever it chooses.  The results are bizarre and unsettling, but they are almost always ""unreal.""  I would begin by asking it to leave, but asking in the right way.  This is very important.  Talk to it as if you were addressing any other person in the room.  Tell it, in a clear, detailed and courteous way, to leave you alone.  Tell it you are frightened and you would like it to stop producing the noises.  Be sincere, and by that I mean what you say and what you think should be on the same page.  This being will be very sensitive to what you feel and think.  If it knows you are fudging when you talk to it, you'll probably be ignored at best.  Show it some respect (unpleasant as that may seem) and I assure you it will be listening carefully.  I would address it this way for at least a week.  If things improve you've made progress; if things worsen it may be time to escalate the process.  But I definitely would start with the simple, direct, honest approach.  The approach outlined here can be surprisingly effective--just bear in mind that beings such as this often have a dislike for the people they must share a space with.  Provocation and attempts to force it to leave are generally unproductive now.  Keep us posted and the best of luck."

There were two dark spots towards the top of the rounded image.  My rough guesstimate is that the ""thing"" was about three and a half feet high.  I took the rounded area to be a head and the two dark spots to be large eyes.  The head appeared to be tilted downward, hiding the rest of the face.  Frankly, the image strongly resembles not so much a ""ghost"" but the so-called beings known as ""Grays.""  After you have a good look at the image, Google ""alien"" or ""gray alien"" and I think you'll see what I mean.  Of course there is much room to disagree; the image is far from clear.  But I have worked with experiencers before--those who have seen Grays--and this looks very realistic to me.  I'd be interested to hear what others have to say."

There are far too many fakes trying to be passed off as real, and sadly folks often fall for them completely.

We'll never be taken seriously when these photos are being passed around as legitimate evidence.  Thank you so much for your input!"

If people want to have fun they can go to haunted houses and get their ""scares"" that way.  People are so quick to discredit paranormal research as it is.  I've been on investigations where people are slamming doors, leaving props around...as though the whole thing is a joke.  Well it's not a joke to all of us.  We take it seriously enough to want credible evidence.  It doesn't necessarily mean unedited audio and film is legitimately paranormal.  It just makes it a lot easier to discern the possible from the ridiculous."

If I see it, I will politely inform the poster what it is, and I ask that everyone else do the same.

It could be difficult, because evidence can be interpreted so very differently, and often, evidence is only solid to those who were present when it was captured. For instance, I could post one of my personal audio recordings, but you would have no way of knowing that the voice wasn't that of another investigator, while I would know for a fact that it wasn't. It's one of the big drawbacks to posting evidence on a public forum.   Let me think about this one. I really like the idea, I just need to think of a way to make it happen.   Thank you for the suggestion!"

I would not remove a post containing an app photo unless I sincerely felt the OP was the one who created it, and that they posted it with the intent to fool us. As you said, the poster may not be aware that it's fake, and it would be a perfect opportunity to politely educate them. Same is true with orb photos. Some people watch Ghost Adventures, and it's their only source of information when it comes to the paranormal. I'd rather allow those posts, then politely use it as an educational tool.   As for the question in your edit about youtube vids, I'll have to check with the other mods. As the new guy, I'd rather not give you inaccurate info.

Ghosts,2erslw,scrumtrellescent,24,Wed Aug 27 23:12:46 2014 UTC,"The short answer is that we don't know how they work, or if they exist. There is no scientific evidence to prove nor disprove their existence.  There are many different theories, ranging from ""purgatory"" to Quantum Entanglement. Some believe that spirits stay here due to unfinished business - others take a more scientific approach and consider the possibility that spirits could be the energy that was once a part of a human, absorbed by it's environment and reflected outward. Some even believe that ghosts aren't what we think they are - that perhaps they are higher dimensional beings who ""dip"" in and out of our space-time, and what we see is a 3D projection of a 4th dimensional object or being.  The types of ghosts is mostly hearsay. They round them off into 4 categories: Residual, Intelligent, Poltergeist, and demonic.  Residual refers to events or experiences that appear to have a cycle. These are assumed to be left over energy from a traumatizing event that was absorbed by it's environment, hence why it is called a ""place memory"". Residual spirits are impossible to contact as they are unaware of you being there. It is almost as through two periods of time mesh together, both being relatively unaware of each other.  Intelligent refers to spirits you CAN communicate with. These are what people call ""ghosts"". Energy that is both intelligent and self-sustaining.  Poltergeists refer to what are called ""tricksters"" or ""noisy ghosts"". These are apparently beings who are able to manipulate the physical environment in which we live in. They throw things, destroy things, hide things, etc. These ghosts are intelligent and the most active. Unlike ghosts, poltergeists are usually considered malevolent or ""demonic"" in nature. They are known to harm and annoy the living.  Demonic spirits refer to beings that are NOT from humans. They are beings that exist, but never in a physical form. Demonic spirits attach themselves to living hosts, and bring misfortune and bad energy with them. Demons are considered to be very intelligent and able to manipulate the living into doing what it wants. It is essentially a leech that won't let go. These are considered the most dangerous and very few people are willing to dabble in that kind of stuff.  In short, we don't know if they exist - but we have tons of information and experiences to base all of this knowledge on. Most of what we know about spirits is probably very wrong, however this is what we can make of the phenomenon for now.   EDIT: Keep in mind that this is a very watered down explanation. No one knows if they really exist, so all knowledge is completely hypothetical. Take all of this with a bucket of salt.  Several people claim to have had experiences, however it is more likely that those experiences have logical explanations that the terrified victim didn't think about.  I would imagine that truly unexplainable things happen very rarely. Out of all the ""Paranormal"" events ever witnessed by humanity, maybe 1-5% of those are truly unexplainable IMO."
Ghosts,2erslw,talondigital,7,Thu Aug 28 02:23:20 2014 UTC,This is a superb and intelligently composed answer.
Ghosts,2erslw,askolsunburcu,6,Thu Aug 28 03:11:51 2014 UTC,Best explanation I've ever heard. Kudos
Ghosts,2erslw,corourke,3,Thu Aug 28 14:17:35 2014 UTC,"I was under the impression that:  a) Residual hauntings were merely imprints, like a recording in space/time that plays itself over and over  b) Poltergeists were not actual beings but the manifestation of super concentrated negative energy of the people occupying the ""haunted"" place  I don't have experience from either, just going by what I have read/heard so far."
Ghosts,2erslw,snowbirdie,6,Thu Aug 28 15:11:41 2014 UTC,"I'm a total skeptic but love being creeped out/scared. For the most part assume ghosts aren't real.   That said residuals are currently the only type of hauntings given any merit by science. A lot of old house construction created faraday cages that can ""contain"" a magnetic field. During a massive spike in brain activity due to murder, remorse, guilt etc the hypothesis is the more powerful EM emissions from the brain get stuck in the house. There have been 2 cases (at work so don't have the link) where degaussing a house to deal with power issues also caused the purported hauntings to stop.  Tl;dr: ghosts work by magnets."
Ghosts,2erslw,TheWildTurkey,3,Thu Aug 28 17:20:25 2014 UTC,"You are right on both points. ""Place Memories"" are also known as ""imprints"". Different names, same meaning.  As for poltergeists there are many conflicting theories. From being a demon to being manifestations of strong emotional stress (what you said). I would say that Poltergeists are the most interesting and possibly the most difficult to understand. They provide proof of their existence by manipulating the environment, but still remain a complete mystery."
Ghosts,2erslw,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Aug 28 22:25:14 2014 UTC,"Quantum Entanglement? No. That does not work on a macro scale, nor does it even make sense. The spin state of an electron entangled with another electron has nothing to do with the paranormal. The only remotely related topic that you could be alluding to is non-locality and the possibility of a holographic universe.  But QM/QED is purely at the Planck level, unless you consider virtual particles to be ghosts."
Ghosts,2erslw,kokiril33t,2,Thu Aug 28 05:49:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah Quantum Entanglement doesn't make sense as an explanation for ghosts, but I think OP might have been referring to a theory put forth by Dr Stuart Hameroff and Sir Roger Penrose that posited that consciousness was an emergent property of quantum interactions occurring in microtubules in our cells.  IIRC, some have suggested that if these quantum interactions could continue outside the body, they may allow for an afterlife and thus the existence of ghosts."

Ghosts,2erslw,SpYf3R,5,Thu Aug 28 07:20:19 2014 UTC,"First off, Ghosts/specters/apparitions/ use energy to materialize. That is why our camera batteries drain and our flashlights go out. They need it to manifest.   There are two different categories when we talk about hauntings. Intelligent Hauntings and Residual Hauntings. Almost all hauntings are one of these two.  A Residual Haunting is based on the senses. A phantom smell you can't place. A repeating sound that you've heard several times. Sometimes full body apparitions going over the same motions over and over again. These are seen/smelt/heard because of energy that resides. For example, a full body apparition walks down a hall and stands at the top of a staircase. One theory is that the person would do this constantly, and the energy of the place (for an unknown reason) has captured it and replays it. Like a broken record. When it comes to smells or sounds, its usually something that would accompany a place often such as A piano playing in an old theatre, or laughter in an old bar.  An Intelligent Haunting can have all of the same features of a Residual Haunting, with the exception that the events are, as some say, perpetrated by the spirit of someone or something. These are the hauntings you hear about that deal with seeing an apparition in multiple places, or objects moving. EVPs (Electronic Voice Phenomena) Are usually thought to be linked with Intelligent Hauntings."

Ghosts,2erslw,spooklog,3,Thu Aug 28 02:50:55 2014 UTC,"This is just my own theory, but to me it makes sense.  The soul is the essence of the human being.  Our soul is energy.  Energy can never die, it can only change form.  When a person dies, their soul has to go somewhere, it can't just disappear forever.  There is a theory that ghosts come into being when someone was either not ready to die, was afraid to die, or who died suddenly or tragically and does not yet realize they are dead.  I suppose that theory makes as much sense as anything, just as my theory that the soul being comprised of energy that can never die made perfect sense to me, but I don't know whether or not it will make sense to anyone else."
Ghosts,2erslw,emperorxyn,1 point,Fri Sep 5 17:33:44 2014 UTC,"Hmmm define soul. What do you think constitutes the essense of a person? I would say their thoughts, memories, and self awareness."
Ghosts,2erslw,Oscar_Mayer85,1 point,Fri Sep 5 18:17:43 2014 UTC,I thought that made sense. Its like when something traumatic happens to a person sometimes they repress the memory. Dying would definitely be traumatic for someone who didn't expect it or if it was violent. Maybe ghosts are souls who have repressed the memory of dying?
Ghosts,2erslw,velezaraptor,2,Sat Sep 6 15:13:37 2014 UTC,"I think one of the most outstanding characteristics of paranormal events is their subjectivity.  So many encounters are with individuals, not groups; when there is a group encounter, each member of the group may have a different story to tell.    The subjective element does not invalidate claims of the paranormal, ghosts, aliens, etc.  But it does highlight how the scientific method and material ""evidence gathering"" is so inadequate at dealing with the paranormal."
