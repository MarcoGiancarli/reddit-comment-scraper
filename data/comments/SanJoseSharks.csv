SanJoseSharks,3e41g1,twrmUK,3,Tue Jul 21 20:05:48 2015 UTC,I have to say it again. These shorts that Sharks have been putting out this summer have been phenomenal. I would love to see these extended during the season to maybe 15 minutes have it become like a Shark Byte type show posted to YouTube.
SanJoseSharks,3e41g1,BurningBushJr,2,Tue Jul 21 23:02:28 2015 UTC,"Very interesting to see how tough of a time management is having in the decision making for rosters. I know it can't be very easy, but it seems Meier might steal a spot, we shall see..."

SanJoseSharks,3e294c,futurefound,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:09 2015 UTC,Hands down he has always been my favorite player!
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,Arttru707,7,Tue Jul 21 21:21:21 2015 UTC,I just want to open the discussion for Pavelski as Captain.  Here's proof of why he deserves the captaincy. He leads by example and fires up the team.  Pavs for President 2016!
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,bearvsshawn,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:39 2015 UTC,I totally fucking agree. Give the guy a fuckin C. He is the Sharks future and needed leader.
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,foxbodystang,3,Tue Jul 21 16:16:39 2015 UTC,He also brings holiday fruit cake shenanigans to the table(pun intended)! And to be honest I'd much rather hear about Mrs. Couture's fruit cake than Jumbo's Cock.
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,SquirrellyTurtle,4,Tue Jul 21 16:51:20 2015 UTC,Anyone else besides me think we should roll out Pavelski as a third line Center to give us more depth?   Something that bothered me last year was the fact that we had our best players on the top two lines and our bottom two lines looked like shart salad.
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,Arttru707,12,Tue Jul 21 13:28:55 2015 UTC,They aren't going to put our top scorer and possible captain on the third line. This move is dead just like the burns on offense one.
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,DisastersFinest,7,Tue Jul 21 13:37:42 2015 UTC,"I did last year, not so sure I want to see it this year given some of the gaps we've managed to fill and how solid Tierney looked last year. I could (and want to) see Tierney or Hertl playing 3C this season."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,crosshogg,8,Tue Jul 21 15:13:45 2015 UTC,"With Tierney coming up and looking really good, no."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,bearvsshawn,3,Tue Jul 21 13:58:12 2015 UTC,"I read an interesting article about Pavelski in 13-14 vs 14-15, and one of the main differences was he thrived on the third line in 13-14.  EDIT: I can't find the article to save my life. It was a very interesting read for those interested. I think it was Fear The Fin."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,crosshogg,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"In the context of last season, I totally agreed with that at the time, and was clamoring for it, too, because the lineup was basically depleted all over the place and we had no depth anywhere. When he played on the 3rd line in the playoffs in 13-14 in particular, he did look great. FTF advocated that move throughout most of last season.   Buuuut Pavs, Thornton, Ward has the potential to be one of the best lines in the league next year, and  I don't know who would fill Pavelski's spot on that first line that would make him centering the third worth the tradeoff. We have young, capable guys, and DW and DeBoer seem to be on the same page about letting Hertl center a line, something that Todd (allegedly) actively did not want to do. Pavs is also in the prime of his career and should be playing 1st line minutes."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,Arttru707,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"He did really well on the third line, and sorry folks Pavelski IS greatness but he also had Jumbo setting up plays. We have talented Centers and we need them to play Center. We need to have depth up and down the lines if we are going to push for playoffs this season."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,bearvsshawn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:14 2015 UTC,I definitely agree Pavelski needs to stay on the top line. Tierney can take Center for the third line. Tierney/Nieto/insert name here can handle the role and put up points.
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,piepi314,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:17 2015 UTC,That's just not going to happen. It was a good idea 5 years ago but now he's one of our top scorers. It's just not a viable strategy anymore. Tierney or Hertl will likely be our 3rd line center. Pavs is best served on the top line now.
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,BurningBushJr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"Anyone else besides me think we should roll out Pavelski as a third line Center to give us more depth?   Not sure if serious or not. When talking about how to improve the sharks lineup,  This is like THE number one thing people talk about with moving burns back to forward a close second."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,Jimmy__Switch,5,Tue Jul 21 19:38:42 2015 UTC,"Joe Pavelski is an American hero, the heir apparent to Joe Thornton, and arguably the most underrated player in the league.  Pavelski was drafted 205th overall in 2003.  That's the seventh round.  Pretty impressive that he's come this far.       My favourite Joe Pavelski moment."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,Henriww,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:24 2015 UTC,"I personally was with the people who would have seen him traded away over the offseason for younger pieces.  When Marleau and Thornton are done, this guy will be 34 at least, and having a 34 year old as our first/second line center isn't the best idea for getting some consistency in the team, and he is only gonna lose value once Thornton is gone. Despite that he is actually my favourite shark along with Burns. So it would've been tough to see him go, but for the team I could swallow it."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,piepi314,4,Tue Jul 21 15:27:45 2015 UTC,Pavelski has another solid 5 years and probably another decent 5 after that. There is no reason to ship away our top player for picks and prospects. Especially when pavelski is exactly the type of player we would hope those picks and prospects would develop into.
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,Henriww,4,Tue Jul 21 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"I was in the mindset that we wouldn't be competing for the next 3 years prior to the offseason, so that would be the rest of his prime wasted. And I'm not convinced he will keep up his level of performance when he is past 35 and without Thornton.  I agree he has got a solid 5 years left, but I thought prior to all the offseason trades we would've been in a better position to rebuild around Couture and maybe Hertl as our 1st and 2nd line centers once Thornton's and Marleau's contracts were up. Obviously with the trades that have been made we are once again in a win-now position and it would be a terrible idea to trade Pavelski."
SanJoseSharks,3e294c,natefaraci,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"Captain America. Quickly developing into my favorite current Shark over Couture. Might even pick up a Pavs sweater before Cooch. Regardless, this man is amazing. He will easily be our next captain and I have no problem with that. I believe he shows great leadership in the locker room and on the ice. Need proof? Here. Where ever we have played Pavs, whether it be on the first line or the third, he has played phenomenal. I remember him playing 3C and the depth we had, and I obviously remember him playing with Jumbo and almost getting back-to-back 40 goal seasons. It will be interesting to see how he will preform with a declining Jumbo. I'm really curious if he can keep that goal total up. He also has a great defensive game as well. All around great player. A complete steal in the 7th round, Pavelski is up there in every statistical category and is easily one of more underrated players in the show. Hope he has another great year."
SanJoseSharks,3e1fk5,natefaraci,9,Tue Jul 21 05:36:41 2015 UTC,Guess we liked Provorov
SanJoseSharks,3e1fk5,jdtran408,6,Tue Jul 21 05:37:14 2015 UTC,don't blame them provorov is a stud and is possibly nhl ready. a lot of scouts said that he might actually be better than hanafin. philly has a good prospect on their back end now. sharks definitely were probably looking for a dman prospect since they traded up to get jeremy roy.
SanJoseSharks,3e1fk5,dizzyDC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:12 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I like Roy though. Developed currently, I could see him in our top 4 in the future. I've heard good things about him."
SanJoseSharks,3e1fk5,Gprinziv,4,Tue Jul 21 05:44:06 2015 UTC,No doubt Roy is an excellent pick considering he dropped into the second round (some scouts had him as high as a mid 1st round pick) but I believe Provorov has the potential to be a star in the NHL. Really good pick for Philly.
SanJoseSharks,3e1fk5,joe_lami,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:53 2015 UTC,"True, it's just the the good things heard about Povorov are on a whole next level. Meier should be a strong competitor, though."
SanJoseSharks,3e1hjr,schrotestthehero,10,Tue Jul 21 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"Goldobin has the best shot. If he doesn't make it out of training camp, he'll almost certainly get a call-up sometime in the season. Donskoi could make it, but he needs time to adjust to the North American game. Meier will be sent back to juniors. For the sixth defenseman, it would probably be Tennyson, since he's older. Mueller was rushed last year, so he would go back to the AHL for a bit. Tierney definitely stays on the team, Goodrow has a great chance to do so in a fourth line role."
SanJoseSharks,3e1hjr,hertler48,4,Tue Jul 21 06:13:30 2015 UTC,"I think Tennyson is a shoe-in unless we pick up another D-man via a trade. He's the best option to round out the top 6. For the 7th guy that we sit in the press box each night, my money is on DeMelo. I sure hope Mueller gets a full season in the AHL and gets the call for the playoffs only.  Goldobin seems to 9 games and back to AHL for me. Last season I'd say differently, but we actually have some forward depth this year. Another year putting on ~5-10lbs of muscle would be great for him."
SanJoseSharks,3e1hjr,slackador,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:30:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely Goldobin. He put on some muscle over the offseason, so he should be good to go."
SanJoseSharks,3dw9au,sumiriously,10,Mon Jul 20 01:36:23 2015 UTC,Chris Tierney ends third in total points and the third line he centers is responsible for getting us through the first round of the playoffs.
SanJoseSharks,3dw9au,Seanroutt,5,Mon Jul 20 02:08:17 2015 UTC,This is probably the most realistic one IMO. I think Tierney's going to be really good.

SanJoseSharks,3dw9au,bwc_28,17,Mon Jul 20 19:45:26 2015 UTC,"The kids are alright-  Goldobin makes the team out of camp. A Goldobin-Hertl-Nieto line is used as a purely offensive third line, being heavily sheltered by a shutdown line of Marleau-Couture-Wingels. The kids line goes crazy, and is one of the best lines in the league. Our depth brings us to the Stanley Cup Final, where we lose in 4 to the Maple Leafs. Doug Wilson is fired, and replaced by SJ Sharkie. Not the guy who pretends to be Sharkie, the actual one.  You did ask for bold."

SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,whywilson,2,Fri Jul 17 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"i agree that he's the best so far but who can we really compare him to? the sharks havent been around for that long and DW has been the GM for most of the franchise. we cant compare him to ferreira, grillo or lombardi. if we did, lombardi has 2 cups with the kings but thats with the kings..."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,theyev,2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"For the most part yea, it's kind of a dumb scale to measure but it was rather infuriating seeing so many fans cry over the past two seasons. It's like everyone forget where the Sharks came from and how this franchise use to SUCK.  Sharks fans started to get entitled after 06-11."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,DontSayNoToPills,4,Sat Jul 18 15:41:55 2015 UTC,Except for the billy guerin trade.  That was a pile of shit.
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,whywilson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:41:24 2015 UTC,The McGinn trade too. I cri evrytiem
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,Leftwithnocookies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:34:40 2015 UTC,"McGinn was post 2011, so it's part of that 3-4 year period of bad decisions."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,MuscleMike,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:53:33 2015 UTC,To be honest ya it was a god awful trade looking at it now but that season Guerin was having a very good offensive season. If anything the most concerning thing about Guerin was his playoff performances in previous years. He hadnt been great in many series. Also i think the fact he didnt mesh with Joe was freaky. Really we only lost a 1st for that trade... but i agree not a good trade.
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,DontSayNoToPills,3,Mon Jul 20 00:12:12 2015 UTC,"Defense looks fine and forward depth looks ok, but I'm worried about the 2nd line. Marleau was a -17 last year with less than 20 goals and less than 60 points. Needs to be much better at a cap hit of over 6.5 mil. Also can't have Nieto in the top 6 if he doesn't improve on his 10 goals 27 points and -12. They really only had 3 players perform like top 6 forwards in Thornton, Pavelski, and Couture last year. Maybe Karlsson can fill that role and maybe Hertl gets there at some point, but even if both of those guys step up and Marleau has a bounceback year the Sharks' top 6 forwards won't be up there with Anaheim/Chicago and the other top teams. I hope I'm wrong, but I really just don't think the Sharks have good enough forwards for a 1st AND 2nd line that can go deep in the playoffs."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,MuscleMike,3,Thu Jul 16 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of truth here. Adding Joel Ward is going to benefit the Sharks more than we all know. He will bring a playing style that replicates his work ethic and he'll be a voice in the locker room. This team cannot do worse than last season, last season was the bottom for this team and there's nowhere but up for this all star roster. I think the core of this team has a lot to prove and they want to prove it. Hertl, Tierney, Karlsson will take the next step this season, and I count 7or 8 potential 20 goal scorers in this team.  Things look good!"
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,DontSayNoToPills,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried. Marleau feeds off plays like Jumbo or Cooch and Cooch can carry then 2nd line.  We should be worried about finally having a serviceable 3rd line center  Karlsson - Thornton - Pavelski  Wingels/Nieto - Couture - Marleau  Ward - Tierney - Nieto/Wingels  Brown/Torres? - Hertl - Smith  Doesn't look too bad. Alas, I agree with the notion that Nieto and Marleau need to pick up their games. Nieto might need more time to develop, and Marleau might just be getting up there."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,MuscleMike,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"That is the same 2nd line the Sharks used last year with a 1 year older Patrick Marleau. Do you really think that's good enough that we shouldn't be worried about the 2nd line. The 2nd line WAS a part of the problem last year and can we count on Marleau being as good or better at 36 compared to 35? I also can't see Hertl being limited to 4th line minutes at this critical stage of his development. I see him somewhere in the top 9 pushing Tierny to 4th line Center and meaning that no matter which 3 players out of that top 9 are on the 3rd line it will be guaranteed to be strong and remember Wingels can play wing OR center. You also left Goodrow out of your depth chart and am I the only one who thinks he's a better role forward than Ben Smith?  What I would like to see is: Marleau-Thornton-Pavelski Couture-Hertl-Karlsson Nieto-Wingels-Ward And some 4th line combination of Tierny, Brown, Goodrow, Smith, and possibly Torres who might be back from injury or Goldobin or Donskoi might make the team as well. I'd love to see the Goldobin-Tierny-Goodrow line from last preseason put back together, there was a lot of chemistry there.  What I think the forward lines are actually  likely to be like: Pavelski-Thornton-Ward Marleau-Couture-Wingels Nieto-Hertl-Karlsson Torres-Tierny-Brown  TLDR: The only forwards I 100% trust for the 1st 2 lines are 8, 19, & 39. Lines 3 & 4 and defense looks good and I'm excited for Jones in net. Just not sure they can make 2 good top forward lines."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,Leftwithnocookies,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:28:57 2015 UTC,I definitely kind of just threw out a depth chart that came out of my ass and familiarity. You made point si agree with but just never thought of. I don't know how I missed Goodrow. Derp. Fourth line would be ideal with Tierney centering Brown/Goodrow/Smith. I like having Marleau with Pavs and Thornton. Like I said Marleau can feed off Jumbo or Cooch. Marleau is obviously dropping off in his talent. That's not going to change. Hertl - Couture - Karlsson would be young and talented AF. I like it. Ward and Wingels def need to be together. That would be too much grit and heart.
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,bongmd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"I like what you said about Marleau feeding off talent though. I think 2 of Thornton, Pavs, or Couture could carry him. Just not Logan on his own with Marleau and another anchor."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,Fenix159,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:32:55 2015 UTC,i agree that Marleau hasnt been great but when i watched him play i felt his effort and speed was still there... just a tad slower due to age(but he is still one of the fastest). I think his confidence got rocked last season and he needs to learn that he can transition into becoming a 2nd or even a 3rd line forward rather than a top guy.
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,BurningBushJr,3,Mon Jul 20 00:13:57 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. No such thing as a perfect GM, and Doug has done more to benefit our team than he has to damage it. He's helped build an impressive team, and we've yet to win with it. I hope we do well this year and folks give him some credit.   I'm tired of every twitter post and post on the website getting 3 ""FIRE DW"" posts before any real responses."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,designOraptor,7,Thu Jul 16 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"My problem with DW isn't his work as GM. He has done great things far as building the roster. It's his apparent meddling with the coaching of the team.  The roster last season was part of the problem, and yeah that has been addressed so I'm thrilled with that. But the big thing to be seen is if the new coach is capable of utilizing the tools he has been given. And if he is, is he allowed to do it in a way that he thinks best or will it be the exact same system and just a new figurehead that DW can micromanage?"
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,SleazyCupid,5,Thu Jul 16 15:34:00 2015 UTC,DW has always been very honest and drawn a clear line that the coach makes their own roster decisions. I'd really like some evidence to say otherwise because everything I've seen indicates he is true to his word.   -Adam Burish: Yes DW signed him but it was Todd who kept playing him even though it was clear he was bringing the team down and has no business being on the ice. DW finally had to send him to the AHL to keep Todd from playing him.   -Hertl/James Sheppard: DW trades Sheppard and says it's so Hertl can start playing center. Todd keeps playing him at wing.   -Scott Hannan: DW signs him as a 7th defenseman to mentor the kids as coming up in the youth movement. Todd proceeds to play him night in and night out with disasterous results while Tennyson is stuck in the AHL and Mueller rots in the press box.   At no point did DW step in and micromanage these situations. Where does this idea that DW micromanage the lineup come from?

SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,da_sweetp,2,Fri Jul 17 20:09:07 2015 UTC,FB is so toxic with misinformation
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,Leftwithnocookies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:51:25 2015 UTC,There was a story that came out earlier this year that the reason we had 3 As was because DW and TMac butted heads on who should be captain. Iirc DW wanted Pavelski and TMac wanted Thornton.
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,BurningBushJr,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"| I think Doug Wilson has orchestrated a roster revitalization without losing any significant assets.  I liked your post and am happy for the optimism but not losing assets is inaccurate. They gave up numerous picks for Jones and Roy, and are on the hook for a lot of years and money for Ward and Martin."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,A_UPRIGHT_BASS,2,Fri Jul 17 05:05:51 2015 UTC,"The Sharks have a lot of promise in their system. Granted you don't want to lose out at the draft, but with a roster like San Jose, if the current plan doesn't pay out, trade for draft picks."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,A_UPRIGHT_BASS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:28:38 2015 UTC,"the jones trade right now looks like an overpayment. But lets look at it this way. To get Jones from LA (who were very against SJ getting him) it would cost at least a 1st maybe even more(Also based on Kuraly getting traded it is clear they moved on... granted i am not sure why i thought he looked promising). Jones is not proven as a starter but he has looked very promising and could have easily challenged quick for the starter job next season if the kings continue to struggle. The other side is that if Jones succeeds and plays well(which i would say is likely at least 50% chance) then a 1st round pick for a starting goalie for maybe 10 years is easily worth it. Again he could easily fail and then the trade would look awful. But if Jones fails it most likely means the sharks suck which means we dont make playoffs and DW gets fired(granted there is a chance that Stalock carries but that is pretty low).   Also if you look at the other potential goalies we could have gotten there is maybe 1 or 2 we had a shot at. Raanta is less proven and gotten traded for alot less but i wouldnt feel comfortable with him in net. Talbot was traded for very similar terms. A 2nd and a 3rd are quite high and maybe arent exactly equal to 1st but it can be close depending on where teams end up. Also NYR seemed to have a bias for Edmonton so maybe we had a better package but couldnt get it. Khudobin was traded for essentially a NHL dman, we could have maybe gotten him for a 3rd or 4th(but it looks like they wanted a dman and i feel only Braun would have been available). I am surprised we didnt get lack because based on what he got we could have easily paid that for a more experience guy. But if Vancouver was really pushing us to take Bieksa then i am glad we didnt get him. Plus being in division didnt help us. Lehner got a first and we would have had to taken Legwand. Personally i like Jones more than Lehner because of the injury factor but i would have been happy with either."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,BurningBushJr,3,Mon Jul 20 00:37:54 2015 UTC,Add 2 potentially great goalies battling it out!   I take issue with this. Stalock is not great. He's not even good. He's a bottom tier back up.
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,BurningBushJr,8,Thu Jul 16 15:45:09 2015 UTC,"I was kinda hoping Grosenick gets a shot at taking Stalock's spot.  Grosenick did great in his few games with the big club...maybe the baby Sharks needed him more than the big Sharks...but now that they have Dell (he is rfa though), Rumpel, and Anderson maybe Grosenick will get a shot at the big show."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,Ktzero3,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:43 2015 UTC,He did GREAT in is first game and god-awful in his second game
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,Ktzero3,2,Thu Jul 16 17:37:16 2015 UTC,To be fair...his second game was against the Sabres where the entire team collectively shit their pants and were to busy cleaning themselves up to play hockey properly...
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,Ktzero3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"True, but I would never say he played ""great"" in all his games with the Sharks. I remember him pretty badly misplaying the puck a couple of times in that Sabres game and letting in some really soft, ugly goals.   But for sure, he has showed great potential and definitely deserves a few more looks."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,designOraptor,2,Thu Jul 16 21:25:35 2015 UTC,I'd agree w/ that...He only played a few games iirc...and imo thats not really enough to say either way that he is great or bad...a fair shot is all he needs to prove his mettle.
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,jesteronly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:39:47 2015 UTC,I'm willing to give him a shot. The problem is what to do with Stalock if Grosenick sticks.
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,BurningBushJr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"That is the million dollar question...would the Sharks trade him? Or do they wait one more season til his contract is up and THEN bring in Grosenick as the #2 with Jones...I'd think the latter would be the most probable...this season will be his ""show us what you got"" season since it'll probably end up being a 60/40 tandem I'd guess...If he excels this season then re-sign him and keep Grosenick with Worcester the Barracuda...if he falters, then don't re-sign him and bring Grosenick up next training camp for the #2 spot."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,jesteronly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:30 2015 UTC,"Man I don't know. I just have no faith in Stalock. Wasn't last season his ""show us what you got"" season? I think 60/40 is extremely optimistic. It's clear to me that the org is very high on Jones (especially since they spent a 1st round pick on him). It's his job to lose imo. Stalock would have to have a hamburglar type year or Jones a serious step back for Stalock to get more than 10-15 starts."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,BurningBushJr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:03:46 2015 UTC,"60/40 might've been a bit generous on my part, but at the same time, I don't want Jones to be overworked in his potential first season as a starter...Until we know for sure how Jones is going to do I think a tandem of some kind would be best...If Stalock falters he won't be re-signed next season and Grosenick will come up most likely..."
SanJoseSharks,3dhe5h,MuscleMike,3,Fri Jul 17 14:20:31 2015 UTC,"Goaltenders on this team aren't exactly proven, but the potential is there, I LOVE Niemi, but I feel having two young competing goalies will set a precedent for ""drive"" on this team. Jones is hungry, that will push Stalock to be hungry(hungrier)and if Grosenick has a chance to play...great, throw him in the mix. This team needs internal competition to drive the play against the opposition. I'm not banking on the goaltending, but I'm optimistic and excited."

I get the argument for nolan but Ricci was just as memorable and i feel Nolan's captaincy and the famous all star hatty give him a slight edge. Friesen was for sure a dark horse but i feel many have forgotten him especially newer fans. Also i would like to say that the biggest Darkhorse would be Marcus Ragnarsson.

Pavelski - C Thornton/Couture - A Vlasic - A  On the other side of the coin, do we give the C back to Jumbo simply to placate a disgruntled veteran in hopes of increasing morale and point production?"
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,bearvsshawn,3,Wed Jul 15 18:48:17 2015 UTC,He should get an A. Giving him back the C would admit they made a mistake and it would look bad after all shit flinging that went back forth about it.  Pavs for captain needs to happen. Lets start a fresh season with a new coach & captain. He has already proved he can backup his talk with action.
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,Captiv8,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"To answer your last question, I think the diplomatic answer is the 'A' for Thornton.  I'm curios to see if they do rotating alternates for home/away like we saw a few years back."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,GhostShark,5,Wed Jul 15 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"While pretty much everyone else here is going to be correct, I'm pretty hopeful that Wingels rotates in at A at least in the next couple years. Dude plays his heart out and is a good role model. I don't see couture being A, but he probably might because of skill."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,cubedude719,3,Wed Jul 15 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"I would love to see Wingels get the A over Couture. He just seems to be more soft spoken than Logan, which is why I think Logan gets it."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,Gprinziv,6,Wed Jul 15 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"Pavelski C, Vlasic, Thornton As. Tierney or Wingels will get Thornton's A in two years.  From what's been said, it sounds like Tierney is a natural leader on the ice."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,Environ_MENTAL_ist,5,Wed Jul 15 21:54:30 2015 UTC,"Tierney is love, Tierney is life"
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,bwc_28,6,Wed Jul 15 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"I would give Pavelski the C, Vlasic & Couture the As"
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,Fenix159,15,Wed Jul 15 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"Wilson might refuse to admit it, but this is still Jumbo's team. Pavs will get the C, but it will be absolute stupidity if Jumbo doesn't have an A."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,OleDeadwoodDick,0,Wed Jul 15 18:33:42 2015 UTC,Wilson has zero say over captaincy. It's 100% Peter's decision.
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,Fenix159,14,Wed Jul 15 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"The ""final say"" may rest with the coach, but to suggest that DW has no say is ignorant."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,OleDeadwoodDick,5,Wed Jul 15 20:40:14 2015 UTC,Which is why Tortorella would have made a good coach. He would have just told DW to piss off when he needed too.
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,da_sweetp,3,Thu Jul 16 00:49:10 2015 UTC,Which is why he was never seriously considered.
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,bumpinjams,2,Thu Jul 16 00:55:30 2015 UTC,Correct.
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,TheFantasticFinn,3,Thu Jul 16 01:08:21 2015 UTC,"Either go nuclear on Thornton and force him to waive his NMC, or make him the captain and stop effing with him. He is still the best player, it's his team, this season still largely depends on him."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,High-Til-I-Die,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"This. I think the captaincy drama of the past two years is in the past, with the hiring of a new coaching staff. The right move is going back to Jumbo for the C."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,iliketoast714,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"C: Pavs  A: Jumbo  A: Pickles  When Jumbo eventually retires, the other A goes to Couture."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,SpaceHooker,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting that I'm not seeing any Marleau suggestions. We all know he had a down year, but he is still a key veteran presence and consummate professional. He was one of the few present for DeBoers presser, was mentioned by PDB as a player he knows from the past, has been training hard all off-season, was the guy who called Meier after he was selected, and I believe was hanging around the facilities during the development camp. Obviously Pavs is the favourite for the C, but I wouldn't be shocked to see Patty earn another A."
SanJoseSharks,3deegw,natefaraci,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:31:28 2015 UTC,I agree that Patty should have an A.  It would be sad if he didn't.  And while I think Vlasic deserves one going forward I don't think we should rule out the possibility that Martin gets one.  He's now the elder statesman on that blue line and could be here for awhile.

SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,vigilantepro,11,Wed Jul 15 10:25:17 2015 UTC,"AFAIK It's because De Boer had been out of a job for a year. The Devils could keep paying him to do nothing, but to entice another team to snatch him up they waived the draft pick. Since the sharks hired him, the Devils no longer have to pay him on his old contract.   So the Devils waived the pick to help save money."
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,pnf1987,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:25:48 2015 UTC,Just so you know as soon as you sign a new deal the old team stops paying you regardless. Remember Dan Bylsma was hired by Buffalo and Pitt got a pick a year after he was fired. Another reason why Torts probably isn't all that interested in a job is because no one will offer him north of what he is currently being paid. And yes because he is a bad choice. As someone said this is a Lou move for sure.
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,whywilson,4,Thu Jul 16 09:04:06 2015 UTC,because it's for next year?
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,unicornlord,5,Wed Jul 15 11:22:45 2015 UTC,They denied it completely.
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,piepi314,2,Wed Jul 15 13:19:26 2015 UTC,"Did they actively decline the pick, or was it a passive ""oops we forgot"" moment?"
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,bearvsshawn,9,Wed Jul 15 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"No, we actively denied taking it.  Pretty sure this was a Lou move. Probably thinks it's a pretty dick move and wants to keep good relations."
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,NJDCat,8,Wed Jul 15 15:25:38 2015 UTC,What a stand up guy
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,bearvsshawn,7,Wed Jul 15 15:27:20 2015 UTC,Lou has always been a class act. Hopefully Shero continues this trend.
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,NJDCat,2,Wed Jul 15 15:29:49 2015 UTC,@TGfireandice   2015-05-27 21:16 UTC  Remember the Penguins did not seek compensation from the Devils for hiring Ray Shero. Devils won't from San Jose for Pete DeBoer.     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]

Also, I doubt that Edmonton really cares much about losing a third if they can get a coach like Todd anyways."
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,NJDCat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:31 2015 UTC,I've picked up that a lot of GMs consider it a dick move to ask for draft pick compensation.
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,ObsidianSquid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:31:20 2015 UTC,Yes. Not only does it destroy relations but it was never suppose to be abused in this way.
SanJoseSharks,3dd7v8,NJDCat,0,Sat Jul 18 20:16:40 2015 UTC,Because the Devils had already fired him and knew they didn't want him anymore.
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,djamesBSN,9,Tue Jul 14 02:13:42 2015 UTC,"If there is any basis to it, I would put my money on Rick Nash for Logan Couture. Some people are saying Nash for Marleau, but I don't buy that. Nash and Jumbo go way back, and have proven chemistry. Couture wants to go to a big market team. It simply makes too much sense. I suspect we don't hear anything until the end of the week. Rick probably needs time to discuss with the family, meet the team, look at houses, etc before he waives his No-Movement."
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,NowTheyTellMe,13,Tue Jul 14 02:22:54 2015 UTC,What is your source when you say Couture wants to go to a big market team? Not trying to be a dick just genuinely curious.
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,anteater58,10,Tue Jul 14 04:31:50 2015 UTC,"I'm curious of your source too. Someone on this sub also said that Couture said he's wasting his prime years being a Shark. I love Couture, but if that's the case then see ya. I've also heard multiple times that he has a bad attitude. I'm NOT saying there's any truth to this any of this, as I have no real source to go off of. But a lot of the time, where there's smoke there's fire. Would be a real bummer to find out it's true."
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,its_ryanmiller,9,Tue Jul 14 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's a lot of people just making shit up.  I've read about it too, but only here on reddit. All I can find in quick googling is this: ""Not great,"" Couture said about the team's culture. ""That's my personal opinion, and that's all I'm going to say about it.""   Other than that it's just ""I heard from a guy that lives by a guy that knows Couture..."" and other such speculative things."
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,Fenix159,4,Tue Jul 14 14:15:56 2015 UTC,"The Sharks have the entire Bay Area and Northern California to themselves... 9 million people within the market, including major cities of San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, and Sacramento.   There are only a couple larger media markets than this one. Some measures list SF-OAK-SJ as the sixth largest in the U.S., and Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto as the 20th (just Sac alone is larger than St. Louis, Pittsburgh, San Diego for comparison). That means New York, L.A., and Chicago are really the only larger markets in the league, and two of those are split by multiple teams.  ""Big hockey market"" might be a different conversation, but the perception of San Jose as a small market is deeply flawed."
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,longdrive95,5,Tue Jul 14 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"I think he means more of a hockey town, I think the average New Yorker knows more about hockey than the average person in the bay area."
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,Dzdimi14,7,Tue Jul 14 19:59:43 2015 UTC,I think you would be wrong...especially in San Jose proper...
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,SleazyCupid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:06 2015 UTC,That's called hometown bias
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,dizzyDC,5,Wed Jul 15 06:13:11 2015 UTC,It was Eklund's hypothesis that the deal was Marleau for Nash. He said in his podcast thingy that he has an understanding with his sources that if they don't respond to his texts that contain a hypothesis then he might be on to something. The man is terrible at making predictions and breaking news so I would put very little stock in it.
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,Zach_Attack33,5,Tue Jul 14 04:26:01 2015 UTC,Only way this happens is if they somehow lose Stepan. NYR would also have to retain cap and that would probably be a turnoff.

SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,SpaceHooker,3,Tue Jul 14 07:11:39 2015 UTC,funny how that word is used compared to its actual meaning.
SanJoseSharks,3d7by5,blackseeker3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"I think that Nash for Marleau would be a great trade. I wouldn't take Nash for Couture thought. Nash is a great player, but is starting to get old. Trading him for Marleau would simply be a swap of old veterans, but Marleau has been starting to fall off. I wouldn't trade him for a young goal scorer like Couture in his prime."
