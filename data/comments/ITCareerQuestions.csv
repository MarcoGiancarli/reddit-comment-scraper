They already know (and hopefully like) you, so submitting the resume sounds more like a formality.  Spend a little time looking at your resume and just copy the formatting to add in what you've been doing for them for the last 6 months. And browse /r/resumes if you need a bit more reassurance."
ITCareerQuestions,3e77a4,radben,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:19:28 2015 UTC,"They do like me, both my coworker and my boss talk about me as if I'm going to be here a while. They mention things upcoming in a few months, my boss reminds me my hours will change once the semester starts (because I work at a University), they gave me a run down of important projects coming up as far away as December.  It's been very confusing, though. At one point a few months ago my coworker warned me that early talks about the position, once posted, would require more certifications than I currently hold. Basically, they were looking for the guy I just replaced. Thing is, and my coworker said this, it wasn't realistic. The previous guy left because he had so many certs and was being underpaid and moved on to a six figure career. So, he said it would be ridiculous if they wanted to hire a carbon copy of him, because no one with those certs would want to work for what they offered.  So, flash forward, they've been dragging their feet for months now about the whole thing. Word is that they eased up on their requirements.  Ultimately, I'll have to submit a resume and go for an interview with not only my boss, but his boss, the head of the IT dept. Which, to be honest, makes me nervous, because unless the head of the IT dept caught wind of some of my accomplishments, then he essentially has no idea what I've done.  Therein lies another concern. I'm at work right now, I'm on reddit. Since the school semester ended, this is pretty much my day to day. I'm on here or youtube. So, is my coworker. We have next to nothing to do.  During the semester, I quickly showed why I was a good hire, getting them out of tight spots, ""swimming"" in situations in which I could have ""sunk"". The amount of praise I received from members of faculty and my colleagues was noteworthy. Now, I'm worried that the dead Summer has done nothing but diminish that. Everytime my boss sees me I'm doing little to nothing. Not to say that there is anything to do, and I believe he's well aware of that. However, I've gotten to know him, and he's the type of boss that seems to forget your achievements over time. I'm just nervous that my track record looks less impressive to him as time has gone by.  I know this has been very long, I'm just really stressed about it. This has been an absolute dream job for me right now at this point in my career. It has given me such a leg up and I went from being entry level IT to experienced within a few months."

ITCareerQuestions,3e5kre,PowerShellStunnah,2,Wed Jul 22 09:24:35 2015 UTC,"+1 to wall of text, that was the first thing that stood out to me at a glance. When they look down at it, you want them to see something that makes you employable, not be intimidated. Your 'experience' section is so intimidating that I would put the Skills on top, though I would rewrite both skills and experience first.  Speaking of skills, I absolutely hate bars showing how skilled you are, because the only thing they show is how skilled you think you are. A new grad will think they know a lot but actually know very little, a junior admin like yourself will think they know a little but probably know more than they think they do, a senior admin will know a lot and think they know a lot, a senior SENIOR admin will think they know very little and not know why the junior admin is amazed by just watching them work... Just say you have experience with something, and omit the bar chart.  Now, I love that you're into hiking and astronomy, but is someone looking to fill the Windows Sysadmin position going to care?"

I want a list of ""Study X then take test for X""  for everything that is needed."
ITCareerQuestions,3e3cq1,54756e6472616c,4,Tue Jul 21 17:18:08 2015 UTC,"So all of this is going to be my opinion, and what I have personally learned while being a sys admin for a short time. I just recently got into the industry, so I think I have a pretty good idea of what you need at the moment. (I may be wrong!)  First, a little background on IT. It's not really a 'job', more a network of jobs that have varying levels of difficulty, and all do different things. I would research a lot about what types of jobs interest you, and start to tailor your abilities to match that. For example, you could be a network administrator, or you could be a pen tester, with MANY different types (honestly your best friend here is going to be google).   Second, you're going to want some basic knowledge that will carry you forward. I would set one of your computers to using primarily linux, and get VERY familiar with a whole lot of commands. Here's a small list containing some that are commonly used. I would recommend getting very familiar with grep (it's saved my life a lot). Operating systems that I would recommend are linux mint, debian, or whatever really.   Third, I would buy a couple raspberry pi's and set up debian or whatever OS you want on there to simulate servers. They aren't going to be the most powerful, but it'll start getting you in the right direction, and you can even do some pretty awesome stuff with them. If you want a different type of roughly the same thing, try the arduino (which can get a little more hardware-y). With these, I would get familiar with SSH, SCP, and figure out how to get an FTP client to connect to it to manage your files.  Finally, I would buy a domain and host it on one of your raspberry pi's. I would suggest getting to know wordpress or drupal and installing them to your site. You can do all of this remotely (as in you don't have to actually be AT the machine). Play around with it a little, get a feel for websites.  Obviously this is not meant to be a comprehensive guide, and you'll have to do a SIGNIFICANT amount of research and possibly spend some money to figure out how to do all of this. You can also use any old laptop or desktop you have sitting around as a server, and install whatever OS you want on it. All of the servers I manage are running debian, and if I didn't know how to use linux before this I would be completely lost.  Hope this helps!"
ITCareerQuestions,3e3cq1,weeve90,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"Well, this would be a useful overall learning path, but i was more interedted if anyone knew of any resources of videos i could learn from. As most of the  you can find about enterprise level stuff on the internet is low quality, in terms of audio and usually content. I have my own domain and have been playing around with that stuff and am not really interested in doing that much stuff at the moment (cause most of my spending money is gonna go into my gaming computer), just wanted to learn how databases and big server clusters work"
ITCareerQuestions,3e3cq1,weeve90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:18 2015 UTC,"Mmm in that case I'm not sure what to tell you. Videos are certainly helpful but our field is very hands on. The best way to really solidify your knowledge is practice, and without getting your hands dirty you won't retain much. I watched a ton of videos and read a bunch of guides before this job I have now, and I can tell you that I've learned FAR more (and by far more I would approximate 100x more) just by being at the job than trying to learn it online.   Of course this is my own personal experience, so it may not apply to you. Also Raspberry Pi's aren't expensive at all, and arduinos are even cheaper (at least some of them). Other than that I really don't have much else to give you, most of my research came from googling what I wanted to know, and googling every term that I didn't know from the previous source."
ITCareerQuestions,3e3cq1,roflectomy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"You think it could be just as useful to skip out on the Raspberry Pi thing and just set up some VMs?  I did some of that stuff (ftp, ssh, etc) with two fedora VMs."
ITCareerQuestions,3e3cq1,weeve90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely! It'll produce a lot of the same results, and anything helps really, I simply prefer the more hardware approach. Plus they can be always running, whereas I don't really like to leave my desktop running when I'm not using it. It's a personal preference thing, if you're not going to be trying to access these when you're not at your computer (as in, you don't want to access them from any other computer using SSH), VM is definitely a good way to go."
ITCareerQuestions,3e3cq1,Christopherx8192,2,Tue Jul 21 18:53:07 2015 UTC,Honestly i am 17 and interested in networking and server security and one thing i was told to do was to build a computer and use that computer as a server and uses things such as freenas and Ubuntu Server to self train because most likely any big enterprise company hires you they will not want you working straight away they will spend the first 2+ months(one company i was interviewed for said a 9 week course)training on there systems then you can start to work on the companies systems.  And the chances are to work for BIG commercial companies or companies needed that degree of hardware you will have to have 2+ years experience or a Degree.  So all i can say is start of small and once you get the experience or qualification the progress higher.

System admin = Install a virtual desktop program, and install Linux to it. Learn to use the linux command line interface. Software development = Learn a basic scripting language (python, javascript, powershell). Make basic programs to see what you can do.   Also learn about active directory.

ITCareerQuestions,3dzbzu,Summie520,10,Mon Jul 20 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between a certificate and a certification. A certificate is a worthless piece of paper that people will laugh at or not care about. It's basically just taking a few college classes, but not enough to get an actual degree, and it only means whatever the college thinks it does to the college. Don't waste your money on this. It is only worth it if you use the credits to a full on other degree.  A certification however is recognized by the industry at large if it's the right one. Cisco, CompTIA, and ITIL are some of them. Those are worth the money, but you basically just self study and take a test."

CompTIA is nice to have, but a lot of industry folks I've talked to say that it's a joke. I've never taken it so I can't speak to that; but you should definitely do research before deciding to invest time into studying for it; or better yet, talk to potential employers about what might make you hire-able and work towards those things.  Taking some classes might still be worthwhile depending on what your technical competence is. Thankfully; there's a vast amount of free online learning resources for almost all domains for computing. However; I love learning about tech, the amount of things I discovered by just talking with my professors or listening to them talk about new tech, is astounding; I don't think I could've just Googled my way to where I am now. So classes, even at a community college may be worthwhile to expose yourself to that kind of environment  I will say that by studying for the RHCSA and RHCE cert's that I've picked up a great deal of knowledge that I didnt get from university or from the free resources online.  Good luck!"

ITCareerQuestions,3dzbzu,sqlburn,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"There 3 basic ways to make good money. Make other people money, save them money or entertain them. Assuming you are like the 99% rest of us who can't entertain ourselves out of a wet paper bag, you will have to focus on the first two.  What have you been doing for the museums? Sounds like you enjoy the museum niche. How can you either make them money or save them money?  Executives and managers love dashboards. It lets them see how their business and museums are a business, is doing in real time in one or two screens. That can show them where they are loosing money or making money. By showing them, they can make adjustments to their business they might have not seen if it wasn't for your dashboards. This business intelligence can be directly transferable to other segments of business.  If that doesn't strike your fancy, look around and see what can be automated? Automation saves a lot of money. You don't necessarily have to be a code monkey to do that. You have the niche knowledge. You can hire or work with a code monkey to make the automation happen."

If you want to demonstrate that you're a fast learner, don't just say you're a fast learner but talk about projects you've done where it's obvious.

You don't really know what tech questions they might ask so that's a bit harder to prepare for other than educating yourself on everything listed in the job description as best you can. You can look up 'common interview questions' and get an idea of the generic questions you might be asked, such as ""tell us about your background,"" ""what are your strenghts,"" ""what is a time you got really frustrated at work and how did you handle it"" etc.   After my bad interview I got a leather ""professional pad holder"" to keep a copy of my resume on one side and a notepad with some questions to ask the interviewer. Being able to refer to those if I needed to eased the tension somewhat and the next interview went much smoother.  I'm also a supplement nerd, so to lessen my anxiety pre-interview I always avoid caffeine and I take L-Theanine (the calming amino acid found in green tea), chamomile, magnesium, and GABA."

ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,Cybersoaker,2,Mon Jul 20 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend learning about programming, I couldn't imagine trying to navigate the world of security without knowing how computers execute code. You don't necessarily need to understand algorithm design and advanced data structures; but certainly getting down to the bare bones of how computers work, I think is invaluable knowledge for security.   I suppose it almost depends on what area of security you want to get into. Network security is dramatically different than software forensics or web app security, though all three are tightly linked together.   Getting internship experience is what a lot of people do; but it sounds like you might have the ability to get some experience with the Army.  I would also suggest learning the shit out of how Linux works and how to use it effectively.  Good luck man!"

ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,ICE_MF_Mike,2,Mon Jul 20 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"Security is a huge field FYI.  My suggestion is to learn your foundational skills. Networking, and OS for starters.  Once you have a strong understanding of how networks and Operating Systems work, then you can start to learn their vulnerabilities and how to protect them.  I think any direction you go in you will benefit from those skills.  For the OS, Microsoft and linux i would recommend.  And keep in mind there are rarely entry level roles in security, so they typically require you to have experience.  So learn, get a job, get some experience and then start thinking about which area of security you want to venture in.    You dont need to have programming skills.  However, learning some will help you especially if you are headed in one of the more technical areas.    And your TS clearance will definitely help you so try to keep that.

ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,Chocobo_Eater,5,Mon Jul 20 15:36:51 2015 UTC,Network security and programming security are 2 different specializations.
ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,Farren246,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"They're nothing without each other, so how could you live with yourself without knowing both? Statements like ""The software is  secure, as long as no one redirects the packets,"" do not exist in security. It has to be both."
ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,Chocobo_Eater,3,Mon Jul 20 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"People I've met in network security just follow the cisco cert path, they don't care about programming aside from basic scripting."

They work for a big ISP and do packet analysis and forensics, where programming is not really needed. (though i can think of many ways it'd be helpful)  But in the same way, I know some DBA's who also don't really know much about programming; even other operations people don't NEED it, but IMO it makes life so much easier in every way"
ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,Farren246,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"How can you even be hired into security without knowing the routing AND the programming AND the database AND the underlying hardware, on all levels?"
ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,Cybersoaker,4,Mon Jul 20 15:49:42 2015 UTC,"Being intimately familiar with all the levels requires a lot of time and practice.   But really think about it; if im writing buffer overflow exploits, do I really care about how the network stack sends packets? For that; it would be best to know x86 asm but knowing TCP control bits doesn't really matter much.  Though yes, you're rather limited in security if you are oblivious to each topic. I really think that if you wanna be good at security; you should train as a sys admin since that would give you all the domain knowledge needed to become a red teamer"
ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,Farren246,0,Mon Jul 20 15:57:07 2015 UTC,"Being intimately familiar with all the levels requires a lot of time and practice.

For that; it would be best to know x86 asm but knowing TCP control bits doesn't really matter much.   Not until you pass the data between client and server, and it gets stolen en route.  I'm of the opinion that no one should be calling themselves a security expert without the in-depth, experienced knowledge of programming, networking, and hardware (and sysadmin-ing in general). Anything less is an insult to that industry that'll only serve to lower peoples' expectations of competence from CS security professionals."

You might have security audits farmed out to specialist security consultants who only do programming or only do networking, but whoever is handling the normal day-to-day security of a company really should be a jack of all trades."
ITCareerQuestions,3dxtd6,Cybersoaker,3,Mon Jul 20 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"Well think about this; QA people don't need to know that much about programming to be effective at their job. They need to understand the key concepts to the big topics; but they don't ever have to code. Their whole job is testing things, performing analysis, and generating reports to product owners.  There are positions like this in security as well. Alongside these people; they also hire sys admins, network security specialists, intrusion response teams, etc etc.   But the point is that security is more of a mindset than a discipline. Plenty of businesses have needs that are security related but not quite as technically indepth."

Go with the role that fits your skills and personality best, not the one that's ""most stable"" or has ""room for advancement"" because if the work itself doesn't appeal to you, then it's going to be harder to motivate yourself to do your best, which will limit the advancement and progress you can make.

ITCareerQuestions,3dyklr,GunslingerJones,4,Mon Jul 20 16:13:52 2015 UTC,CS is overkill for help desk level 1 support and it sounds like you're not being paid what you're worth with the education you have. Entry level developers get paid more than that starting out with the same degree. Do you like to code?
ITCareerQuestions,3dyklr,Campes,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of being a programmer and creating something, but I can't help but feel quite inadequate. I did decently well in school, but it seemed like others grasped the concepts much better than I could so I naturally gravitated towards the easier help desk position. I guess that was a mistake.  Then I look over at my buddy who has a degree in film and is making 80k a year as a database programmer.  Oh man."
ITCareerQuestions,3dyklr,Campes,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah you'll find folks without a formal IT background in well paid positions like that sometimes. That can really make you question your own decision. But I get it, being in a good environment at a job you like can feel rewarding enough to stay. I'd just look at getting out of help desk which is what you're trying to do. It could be more stressful or less. Just depends on where you end up, not necessarily what type of position it is."
ITCareerQuestions,3dyklr,Da_Penetrator,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"The most natural graduation from helpdesk is to sys admin.  Instead of supporting the users, you are supporting the servers.  If you are good at helpesk, there's no reason why you shouldn't be good at network/server admin.  A big place will have junior network admins that make the transition easier (although you'll learn way more at a small place and get your hands on everything - good for this stage of your career).  Earning an MCSE or MCSA will make your resume look much more qualified.  That said, you have a degree in CS.  4 years ago you should have been applying your ass off to get a programmer job and not end up in helpdesk.  Hopefully your skills haven't gone too soft.  Brush up in whatever language you studied the hardest and start applying.  Helpdesk sucks and you have a CS degree.  Use it.  Or if you hate coding, go to server admin.  It's pretty hard to jump from helpdesk to project management... who would consider you qualified?"

I've heard enough stories where the work was not worth the pay, but I suppose that could happen in any field.  I have gotten quite soft and haven't brushed up on programming lately. I'm quite rusty. I might be better suited for a server administration role. Besides the MCSE/MCSA, what else would you recommend in taking steps toward that position?  Or is programming really the best way to go?"
ITCareerQuestions,3dyklr,ICE_MF_Mike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:17 2015 UTC,"I don't care for programming but that's just me.  But you probably aren't going anywhere fast doing helpdesk besides a burnout.    At a small place like you are at now, if you haven't already, it would be a great opportunity to learn from the IT manager on how to run the servers (big places have hard lines in the sand on which team does what).  You could start by asking to learn how to create basic objects in AD (users, groups, etc).  Then maybe adjusting group policies.  Or coding powershell scripts.  Or whatever is needed around there.  Google ""system administrator interview questions"" and see what's common and learn those topics.    Alternative: try to leapfrog into information security (my subfield).  Hopefully you've gotten enough exposure to the ""domains"" there and are qualified to sit for the CISSP (things like creating/deleting usings in AD count).  That's one way.  Another would be taking the rigorous and 100% hands on OSCP course/certification.  Helps if you know how to code, and/or know much about linux.  Either would probably land you a $60-$80k job somewhere as a security analyst.  The OSCP is probably the most respected certification by actual hiring managers right now (HR teams only really know about the CISSP).  It also is one of the hardest and should take you 2-4 months.  With any luck, your employer will pay for some/all of it."
ITCareerQuestions,3dyklr,foolofatook29,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are doing well.  I have a CS degree, and while i dont program, it has come in handy.  it should still help you even if you dont become a programmer.    For now, i would start adding come certs.  Then, evaluate where you are and maybe look at your options.  By then you should be in line for a nice jump in salary and role.    Otherwise, learn as much as you can, and keep your options open.

My study materials are professormesser.com free videos and his $10 dollar study guides as well as practice questions from actualtest.com that I found on the sub."
ITCareerQuestions,3dvope,Threeshoe,2,Mon Jul 20 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, the person who often does tech support for family and friends and is comfortable with building, configuring, and troubleshooting computers usually doesn't have much trouble with the A+. For that person, a month of study is plenty. I was one of those guys and, after I took the exams, I realized that I probably didn't need to study. I tried some free practice tests beforehand and they were all way tougher than the actual exams. This was some time ago - I don't know if the current edition got much tougher.   For CCENT, I'd say that it depends on how fast you can pick up subnetting. You can learn all the other stuff after enough studying, but subnetting is one of those things where people usually hit a brick wall and then one day it all clicks. It's doable in 3-4 weeks but it depends greatly on the individual."

Definitely take your studying seriously, as the exams aren't just a walk in the park for any old tech enthusiast who's put together a PC (mostly because there's just so much information, and a lot of it is quite old and irrelevant to someone who's only built a PC in the Core i5 era). Professor Messer is a great resource, but I'd definitely also find some quality practice tests to see how you do. That's the only way to know for sure how prepared you are.   I can personally recommend the Exam Cram practice tests. They're challenging, well compiled, and cheap too. It's a book, but what you're really after is the included software that includes all the questions from the book in a nice testing program."

ITCareerQuestions,3dtwh6,LeapYearBoy,6,Sun Jul 19 13:36:55 2015 UTC,This is not entirely correct. Most big companies require job candidates to have at least a bachelors degree to get hired. The experience and the certs are what get you more money.

I also just got offered two jobs by recruiters which both pay a salary above $90K (Canadian).  That said a Bachelor's will definitely help you get past HR and certain types of interviews. However, getting good experience under your belt outweighs anything else. Also you have to learn to sell yourself on resumes and interviews.  The University Degree is good but a lot of latest technology is not covered in university. That means yes, a degree alone will not get you a job. I think good IT hiring managers know how to find candidates that can DO things. SysAdmin, Backup, Support, Patching, Handling Outages, Scripting, etc. I know a lot of my coworkers with University Degrees who don't sell themselves and are stuck in a low paying IT job.

ITCareerQuestions,3dsfxp,goretsky,2,Sun Jul 19 07:08:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  But if you go cyber, make sure to learn some windows server or networking stuff on your own.

ITCareerQuestions,3dsfxp,ICE_MF_Mike,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:30:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's HCC. I was in the network security program not that long ago - a couple of the classes are different, but it looks like it's still very similar to the current cybersecurity program. I don't know if they're still there or which campuses they may be teaching at, but there are a couple of instructors that I can recommend, if you don't already have them.  As someone who went to HCC and got hired, I can tell you that the degree you pick isn't going to make or break your career. However, you should decide whether you want to do networking or servers and let that guide you.   A few things to keep in mind:  1) The cybersecurity program is really a networking program. You'll learn a lot of cool security stuff, but most of it is going to happen on the network side. The rest of it won't really be covered in the other programs and there's no other networking degree that is available. The server program has ""network"" in the description but the only relevant class is the Network+ class - that is not a networking program.   2) No matter which degree you get, you are most likely starting out at helpdesk or something similar. Most employers are not going to let someone with no experience have admin access to their network or their servers; you can do a lot of damage if you screw up. Chances are that you will not be working security, network, or servers. It can happen, it's just not likely. Most people work their way up from tier 1, as they should.   3) There isn't a huge difference between the programs. When I went there, some of the required courses actually weren't available, and I had to take something else that was accepted by the department head. Look at the classes and you'll see that there is a lot of overlap. No employer is going to examine your academic history close enough to care about the specific classes you took - they just want to know whether or not you can do the job.  4) You can see a bit of it now, but once you start working in the industry you'll see just how convoluted all the titles can get. You'll see ""network admins"" who don't know networking protocols and ""IT directors"" who are just lone tech support guys for an office. You'll see ""engineers"" who only do tier 1 phone support. The names don't mean much. The two programs you listed are network and servers. If you want to do security then both can lead you there, but you'll need some experience, either way."

Absolutely. It is nice to have the knowledge so you can work competently with your team but it is even more important to be able to deal with people as a manager.   I have a job offer from another company which I more or less like for a support role which could eventually move into the lead support role   Just make sure you keep a nice open dialogue with your new supervisor on your intent. Be a little humble that you don't know everything but are willing to learn. Any good manager will take you under their wing and start teaching you the basic skills needed to really take the big step away from support and to pure people management.  Good luck!

Since you don't have any education or experience yet, and don't really have any certs yet you're going to have a tough time getting a hiring manager to take this application seriously. Making it two pages will almost certainly make it go from ""This guy doesn't have a lot to offer but seems sincere"" to ""I don't have time for this"".   There are a few grammar mistakes. Find them. If you can't be bothered to make a correct resume, how do I know you would be bothered to do other things correctly?  You used 'huge' twice in the first paragraph. Find another word.  Your first paragraph is written in a way that does not effectively and clearly emphasize your good attributes. Don't say 'Professionalism in the workplace is something I strive to achieve', say 'I am a professional'(word it better than that, but make it mean that).  Don't thank them in the intro paragraph.  Take 'Basic' off of your 'workplace experience' line for the lifeguard job. You're downplaying your skills and experience.  In your skills section change out 'Long experience of technical troubleshooting' and 'computer building' to 'Software troubleshooting' and 'Computer hardware repair'.  Take away the references section. If they want references they will ask for them."

The most you can do is vocalize what is broken with a recommendation on how to fix it. If they ignore you then do your best to make sure you do your job the best you can with the screwed up situation you can.  Most people are able to separate the skills of a person from the implosion of a bad project. Most importantly you need to make sure people know to keep you separate and that is done with strong communication with your boss. You may take black eyes from a client perspective but the good thing about external clients is that new ones rarely know your history from shitty projects.   I keep thinking maybe I'll get to switch projects, or this situation will eventually blow over and I'll be able to rebuild my reputation (I'm not even sure what the fallout of the situation has done to my reputation, I just get a bad feeling about it)   Talk to your boss. Talk to your PM. Start engaging them on what you can do to help fix the problem and be insulate the internal damage. You mention a desire to being a Technical Architect and it is projects like this that have big opportunities if you are able to salvage the sinking ship.  As a side note it would not be a bad idea to put your resume out there and look for something else. Better to job shop while you are still employed. This is going to be a hard pill of advice to swallow but never stay at a company because of personal relationships with co-workers. I like a LOT of people I work with but if my company isn't treating me well or my career isn't going forward then I need to leave. If they are true friends then I will never lose that relationship with them as I change jobs."

Being comfortable is fine but if you pass a promotion be prepared to get passed over in the future, at least at your current company. granted i dont know the culture at your company, but i dont feel uncomfortable saying that.   What do you have to learn to fufill this role? if youre not learning, you're not in a challenging enough role- i dont think anyone expects you to be 100% there when you start or even a year in. senior positions are grown into and are always more difficult, but rewarding.    given that, if you dont mind staying stagnant for a while, you can pass it up. just be aware of what that means for your future.  once you do want to move, youll most likely have to hop companies."

Have you inquired about the work life balance?  Maybe you can negotiate that.  If they really want you, let them know that you are concerned about the work life balance.  See what they say.

Not everyone aspires to do ""computer science"". People in IT love to tinker with new technology, and like the variety and challenge. I have no desire to do ""computer science"", as that term makes me think of boring (to me) university research.   Now that I think of it, just what do you define as ""computer science""? Programming, research, or what?  I don't think you should get into IT. Those who will be good at it already know that they have a passion for it and if that was you then you'd already have been tinkering with computers/servers/routers, etc and you'd know if you wanted to do it by now. Anyone else is just doing it because the grass is greener."

I consider myself 'unemployed' because I barely make enough to feed myself while living with my family (~6-7k/yr). Computer Science could be programming, which can be fun because it's like solving a puzzle, or it could be mathematics and theory, which are boring for the most part (to me).   I don't really have a passion for anything because I've never tried anything other than what people have told me I should be trying. It's quite possible I'll never find my ""true passion"" and that's okay with me, so long as I can make enough money to support the kind of life I'd like to live (which is simple enough, but I have some hobbies that can be expensive)."
ITCareerQuestions,3dp46v,shiparp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"IT careers aren't as clean cut as you're describing, there's specializations within specializations, personally the stuff you describe as ""computer science"" is probably the easiest most tedious field, languages don't really change.    When you say you're pretty good at fixing hardware, are you talking about people's desktops and laptops? or are you talking about palo alto firewalls, left hand sans, HP servers, cisco catalyst switches? There's 100s of fields of IT and you can specialize for ridiculous money in all of them.    To give an example, I'm an infrastructure consultant, I get projects like; Customer is opening a new call centre, they have 300 users and need data, voice and remote access, I think have to plan out what hardware they need, how it will be configured, how the network is designed, then I have to implement it(from physically racking it to configuring the VPNs and storage etc).    But my main focus and primary job(although I'd still be a rookie at it at best) is penetration testing, which I currently do ""soft"" testing - Basically companies pay me to break in to their network, find vulnerabilities and back doors, then report it to them so they can get it secured.    There's more than likely something you want to do in IT, and it all makes money."
ITCareerQuestions,3dp46v,ICE_MF_Mike,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:04:58 2015 UTC,"You are making a ton of assumptions about computer science and IT.  Computer science can lead you towards many different careers, IT and non IT.  But thats not the only path into IT.  Also IT is a huge area and people get into it with no degree, and some with masters degrees.  Some people make minimum wage and some make hundreds of thousands a year.  Where you would fit depends on you.    If CS isnt for you try another major that has less programming.  Regardless of the route you choose, you will need to learn to study, pass exams and frequently learn new things.  You cant avoid that if you want to have a good career in any field(though IT typically requires more frequent learning of new things).  So whether that is in a Comp Sci course, or passing your CCNA, you need to learn how to study.  Thats one of the things college is supposed to teach you.    Good luck."

Pretty much every cert is HR friendly.  But if you dont know the content it can also provide good learning material.  but id think its most important right now for you to get more experience.   If you must get a cert, then maybe start studying the content for CISSP.  It will be a good learning experience.  But you wont be able to get the credential until you have more experience.  Otherwise, look at jobs in your area and do a search for SSCP.  if you see jobs that you want that ask for it, then its worth getting."
ITCareerQuestions,3dh0k0,MegaAppster,2,Thu Jul 16 05:08:39 2015 UTC,"You can go yes. But a better question is do you need to? It expires after 3 years. Do you plan on going to college or directly into the work force? Either option is great but if you're going to college you will be able to get an internship without it and you may not want to keep taking further certs (N+, S+) to keep upping the A+ while you have other coursework and responsibilities.   I am by no means trying to talk you out of it, its a great thing to want to start planning out this early in life and you are leagues ahead of people your age and even some people on the professional level. Just want you to think about as $300 isn't the easiest thing to come by or part with at 15."
ITCareerQuestions,3dh0k0,zztr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:17:24 2015 UTC,I though the CompTIA certs were lifetime. Did they change that recently?
ITCareerQuestions,3dh0k0,zztr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:36:52 2015 UTC,Quite a few years ago. Someone else might be able to give an exact date but it was at least ~7-8 years ago. The intention is that the technology changes so someone that got an A+ in 2000 isn't going to know the same information as someone that got it in 2014. So they only last 3 years to keep the cert current. Now lets say you get your A+ tomorrow. It would then expire on 7/17/18. But if you took the Net+ on 7/17/17. Both your Net+ and your A+ would expire on 7/17/20.
ITCareerQuestions,3dh0k0,zztr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:51:41 2015 UTC,I might have to hold off then. Especially if I can get an internship without it.
ITCareerQuestions,3dh0k0,col3yf_-,3,Thu Jul 16 14:03:27 2015 UTC,"You should be able to get an internship without it. You still have to put the work in. Also it's not a bad thing to still keep up with information. Go to professormesser.com and watch his A+ videos. But the benefit is you can do it slowly and not burn out on it. Just absorb the knowledge. I would recommend to just stay involved with computers, browse /r/techsupport and help people when and where you can and then summer after senior year if it still interests you then that's when you pull the trigger and take the exam.  Then again nothing is stopping you from finding a Mom and Pop repair shop in your area and getting a job there to learn as well.  Then again. You're 15. Have some fun."

ITCareerQuestions,3dh0k0,hustleman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"I thought I knew what I wanted to do somewhat for a career at that age. It's really easy for a plan to be derailed. I wanted to double major in physics and aerospace engineering, and then get my masters in aerospace. Theoretical physics in general I enjoy thinking about and wanted to grasp the math behind the concepts, but knew there's basically no jobs without a doctorate. So I knew I needed to find an engineering field. Wanted to go out west and work on jet engines. Sadly university and my health didn't treat me well and i had to rethink my plans since I was snagged on Calc 3 and as a prerequisite it put me behind in a degree. Tried Computer science for a semester, but I hate programming. I would go for computer engineering, but my lack of studying skills would halt any progression. Now I'm searching for a career in IT and will finish a degree that pertains to the direction I choose.   Tl;dr plans can derail"

ITCareerQuestions,3dh0k0,AnAngryFerret,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:29:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. I'm currently 15 so i think I'll study and go for it.
