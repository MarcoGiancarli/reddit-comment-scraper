AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,Cubfanatic,3,Mon Jul 20 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"I love my two, they're perfect for us. They're our dogs, but they've also become our hobby. Keeping them happy and tired is a commitment.  The more common complaints I hear from owners are the barking, the shedding, the protective/guarding instinct (I'm never surprised when I hear about an Aussie biting someone on their property- this seems to be a common topic with other Aussie owners. Usually it is a mail man or meter reader or a kid that bikes through the yard), the energy level ('needs space to run!' declare the Craigslist adds for 6 month old pups). I've met a handful that are anxious to the point of self mutilation and require medication.   My two were adopted at 2 years old and 8 months old, both owner surrenders (one to city shelter, one to ARPH). We've taken both through basic obedience and then some (the younger one is on his 3rd level of classes). If classes aren't for you than an Aussie probably isn't either- they really enjoy learning, and the class environment is helpful for socialization. Mine are very well housetrained, not something I did, they came that way. If they have an accident in the house then I know they are pretty sick. They travel well, which is good since no one will watch them for us now that we have the young, boisterous male (18 months old) so they go on vacation with us. They love other dogs, but the way they play with each other is very rough and bitey and something that non herding dogs don't usually appreciate. I brush mine myself, they have shorter coats and no need to see a groomer. The energy level seems to vary greatly between Aussies- my female is 6 years old and still has a good energy level, we met another Aussie her age who had been allowed to become obese and that dog struggled just to walk from one side of the park to the other. An adult from a good rescue is a great bet for a first Aussie- ARPH did a wonderful job matching us with our pup, they had a dog (meeting my pretty specific criteria) for us to meet within a week of our application being approved."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,catnip51,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"Do you have kids?  Parks nearby?  Are you an outdoors type of person? What do you do on the weekends?  I'd want to know those things before recommending an Aussie as a first dog. They can be extremely energetic, high-strung and high-needs if not entertained and exercised to exhaustion."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,NotYourMothersDildo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"I have not owned a dog, but my roommate (not for much longer) has two dogs, so I am quite familiar with dog needs/general requirements. I've dog sat a million times.   Close to a very big park now, not sure in the future but will likely be close to one. Small chance I'll end up downtown (Chicago) but there is very substantial dog parks/friendliness in the city. Obviously the city isn't a first choice for an Aussie, but I think I could make it work.   Edit: no kids, I'd love to play a lot of frisbee/fetch with my dog if he/she's into that. On the weekends, I might go out at night as much as the next guy, but I'd be home during the days (and of course home over night)."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,NotYourMothersDildo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"I've had Aussies and Borders in a city, no big deal as long as you have activities to do with the dog.   I think the general breed guides to Aussies are accurate; they are very high-energy and extremely smart. Sometimes having an Aussie is like having a roommate and not a pet.  They are not the most affectionate dogs and almost always wary with strangers -- they're judging the person before letting them get close. They're also not always great with kids, tending to herd them or boss them around since they are often the smartest one in the room.  But still, my favourite breed.  Have you checked for Aussie or Border Collie rescues nearby?   (Most herding dog rescues will have both types and mixes).  If you go with a rescue you can get a match for your personality and activity level vs. the unknowns of a pup.   I'd love to play a lot of frisbee/fetch with my dog if he/she's into that.   edit: ""Obsessed"" is probably the first word an Aussie owner would use to describe their dog and their dog's ball or frisbee.  I used to joke that my last girl never played with other dogs at the dog park because they lacked the thumbs to throw her frisbee."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,catnip51,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, i appreciate it!  I've generally heard most of what you said, except I read that they are generally pretty affectionate, especially to their owner, is that not something you've encountered?"
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,NotYourMothersDildo,3,Mon Jul 20 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"My male is affectionate. My female is all business. Cuddles are on her terms, mostly when it is cold and she is using you for warmth."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,RustyDogma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:02 2015 UTC,Pretty much only to the owner. Even after living with my wife for 5+ years my last girl was still my dog and not hers.  I did have one border mix that generally wasn't into receiving affection. She was friendly and loved us and all that but she didn't want to be pet for more than a few minutes at a time. She'd then go to her chair or bed and chill on her own.
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,caffeine_iv_stat,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:24 2015 UTC,"That's totally how my Aussie was. Thank you for the scratches, but I now have better things to do."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,NotYourMothersDildo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"I have a female, she loves to be petted, she is like velcro by my side, but she does not snuggle in bed. My girl does like strangers, everyone so far needs a hug from her."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,cpersall,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"One more post to say a rescue dog is also a great idea for an Aussie because you can get a retiree. There are a ton of great dogs that are retired from work or who weren't good workers to begin with that need a home.   You get an Aussie and all the good that comes with it but once they get a bit older they calm down and aren't so high-needs. Also since they aren't bred for looks or to a breed standard, they can be very long-lived dogs. My previous Aussies and mixes from rescues have made it to 15, 17, and 18 years old."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,NotYourMothersDildo,3,Mon Jul 20 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"Also since they aren't bred for looks or to a breed standard, they can be very long-lived dogs.    Um what?! If they aren't bred to the breed standard, they aren't an aussie. The breed standard is a good thing. It's not about looks. It's about function and structure."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,cpersall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right; that was a poorly worded statement. What I meant was that poor breeding and improper inbreeding is a relatively new thing to Aussies having been a working dog and not something like a Pug or a lap dog bred for certain physical deformities or unlikely characteristics. And I'm far from an expert on ""real"" Aussies having only gotten rescues; most of them were mixes."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,NotYourMothersDildo,3,Mon Jul 20 21:44:45 2015 UTC,"A well bred aussie will be bred to the standard, that is a good thing and what is desired in a breeder. A reputable breeder is also the best option for getting a healthy long living aussie. Of course adopting can be a good option, but buying from a reputable breeder should not be discouraged."

AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,raygungoff,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:24 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest posting this to /r/wigglebutts since it's a much more active Aussie subreddit!  I have an Aussie mix and I have to say that he's the smartest dog I've ever had. And many other dog owners have approached me saying that it's clear how smart he is, just from watching him. He's relatively low energy at home, is very calm (but I got him when he was 3, not as a puppy), but can get SO excited when he sees a familiar face at the park. He's always been submissive to all humans, but I imagine that is something he picked up in his previous life. While the majority of Aussies are high energy, it's not unusual to have a mellow one either."
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,warfangle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:57 2015 UTC,"My Aussie is 11 now and is just as high-energy as she was as a pup. She eats a lot and loves to be taken outside. She loves to be petted and cuddled, but not for very long.   She's extremely smart too! She used to take a little cup and put her nose in it and throw it up in the air and play with it.  She also sheds a lot, so she needs to be groomed quite often.   All in all, she's a great, loving, adorable dog! I was 7 when I got her (she was a pup) and my sister and I got along with her just fine!"
AustralianShepherd,3dymtq,cpersall,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"Temperament is often a function of training and early socialization. I've met standoffish aussies, but I've also met aussies that want to say hi to everyone no matter what as long as they get rubs! The only people my aussie is standoffish towards are people who sit in idling cars and stare at him, or stand on the street corner and stare at him. He's fantastic with kids (I socialized him to toddlers/grade schoolers at a very young age), though he can get a little pushy and try to herd them sometimes (he doesn't nip to herd, he paws at their heels).  They're very smart, and if you aren't familiar with dog training your aussie will train you. Even if you are familiar, they're tough. A lot of people want a smart dog, when they really mean a trainable dog. Smart dogs, while they pick up on training a lot faster than others, will also find all kinds of ways to get in to trouble if they're bored. And unless you're giving them a job to do, daily, they will get bored. And you will be sad. And your aussie will be sad. Job examples: herding sheep, scent work, agility training, treibball.  Aussies are almost always high energy: they were bred to herd sheep all day in the rocky mountains. If your aussie isn't high energy, you've probably let them become a couch potato and overweight (or they may have something wrong with them, and you should definitely check with your vet). Your aussie will probably need 3-4 hours of walking/running daily, if not more.  Aussies are double-coated dogs. Their hair follicles have two types of fur that comes out of them: one shorter and one longer. They will blow their light summer coat in the fall and grow a thick heavy undercoat in the wintertime, and when spring time rolls around they'll blow the undercoat. Unless you keep up with brushing, you will have fur tumble weeds everywhere. They are prone to mats in the feathering behind their ears, on their pants, and generally all over during spring and fall. You will have to do full body brushing at least every other day: an undercoat rake, a slicker brush, and a wide tooth comb. They don't need much grooming other than sanitary trims, but if you don't keep up with brushing your aussie they are going to have a bad time.  With affection/interaction with other dogs/humans, it's all about early socialization. The same with any dog. Stereotypically affectionate breeds can be surly if they aren't properly socialized. Stereotypically aggressive breeds can be the sweetest things ever if they are properly socialized.  Aussies are wonderful dogs. Smart, loyal, affectionate. But if you aren't ready for them, both of you are going to have a bad time. I would never recommend an aussie as a first pup, even if you have extensive experience dogsitting.  Would you feel like you were ready to be a big cat specialist at the zoo after cleaning your friend's cat's litterbox when they were out of town for the weekend?"
AustralianShepherd,3duk3p,Mrbrodyg,6,Sun Jul 19 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"Successful Dog Adoption by Sue Sternberg.  Great book, terrific author.  I looked, you can get one of these used for one cent, plus shipping and handling on Amazon.  Otherwise, an eight year old dog has had a lot of experiences.  My best advice for the first couple of weeks would be to be kind, keep your expectations low, maintain a safe calm atmosphere, and begin to establish a bond.  Dogs are wonderful at feeling your intent, and from your post even I can tell that you're a caring person. ;)  Soon, she'll be feeling like she's lucky to have landed in a nice place, is safe and loved, and will be ready to transfer her affection and devotion to you.

It's totally normal for newly adopted dogs to have accidents in a new house, not want to eat, etc. Just take things easy for a while.  Look into taking a training class or having a trainer come to your home to work with the whole family. Training is a great opportunity to build a bond with your dog."

Mostly everyone will probably tell you to never trim the coat but I really don't see an issue ""taking a bit off the top"". His coat has always been a bit uneven and wiry, and I don't show him or anything like that, so it works for us. I only trim half an inch or so, depending on the area of the body."

AustralianShepherd,3d54cc,rvtjess,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"I have an Aussie in Houston, and I ""shave"" his fur regularly. I have the groomer take his coat down to 1/2 inch, a And he is a different animal with his hair cut.   he is much more comfortable and can run and play for much longer before he goes and flops down in the pool or shade. I notice the biggest difference at night, when his coat is full, he pants all night,  but sleeps like a baby when it is short.   His fur grows back the same each winter and he loves the snow when we head north.  I am in the fortunate situation. Of keeping my dogs indoors most of the time, but as long as there is shade and water (kiddie pools are great) it really should t be a problem.  People say the fur insulates the dog against heat, and that is true, but just like a winter coat will insulate you against heat. If you are sitting still you can be quite comfortable in a coat on a hot day (see yard workers in sweatshirts), but once you build any sort of internal heat it can not escape, and it is the same for dogs.  my point is, it is your dog, and if you feel like it would be more comfortable with short hair then try shaving it off, it is a complete myth that it won't grow back the same.   Also Houston has some great dog parks, especially on the west side."

AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,schmegera,3,Thu Jun 25 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"I can not and would not recommend anyone breeding mini Aussies as they are not a recognized breed by any major reputable dog club. In fact, it's not just that they aren't recognized, very clear statements are made by clubs such as asca stating that mini Aussies are not part of the breed and are not a variation of the australian shepherd. Those continuing to breed mini Aussies are breeding against what is the breed as there are no size variations in the breed. If you must get a smaller dog that is similar to an aussie, look for someone breeding mini American shepherds, what is not recognized by the akc.   Yes you should be concerned with registration. While it doesn't mean that it is a reputable breeder, being unregistered or registered with an obscure group (such as NSDR who even registers ""toy Aussies"") who'll register practically anything is a huge red flag.   Why a mini? Aussies aren't big dogs to start with and it's much easier to find a reputable aussie breeder. There's a ton of aussie breeders in your state.   There are also a couple mini rescue groups around. Are you open to adopting?   This is what to look for in a breeder, whether aussie or mini American."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,cpersall,0,Mon Jun 29 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"American shepherds are mini aussies. There's a lot of politics behind it, but essentially they're getting to break away from the ""standard"" aussies (I use the term very loosely, before anyone jumps on me lol).

AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,2,Thu Jun 25 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool, thanks for confirming! So I shouldn't be worried about getting a ""mini"" aussie as long as the breeder is legit?"

AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:24:01 2015 UTC,Minis can be a pretty big range of sizes and it's not always easy to predict how large they'll grow. Females are generally smaller and would be a safer bet to fall into that range wether you look into Aussies or MAS.
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,crazyol84,0,Sun Jun 28 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"That's still a ""smaller Aussie"", though, haha. Albeit, my girl is also just shy of 40# and is definitely a ""standard"" Aussie, but a majority of Aussies that I see in the clinic and elsewhere are usually closer to the 50-60# range.  I think the politics is because the AKC and ASCA has no size requirements. From the ASCA:   Preferred height at the withers for males is 20 to 23 inches; that for females is 18 to 21 inches, however, quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size.   So that's why the American Shepherd was ""created"", to give breeders wanting to breed ""minis"" better definition for conformation, since the argument is that there are no size requirements for Aussies, so how are you going to define what makes a ""mini"" and what doesn't?"
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,5,Fri Jun 26 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely terrible logic and reasoning. Pretending like the preferred height range gives the all-clear to breed miniature dogs is flat out stupid. The very top of the ASCA standard reads: anything that detracts from his usefulness as such is undesirable.  Have  you ever worked a dog on cattle? Size certainly does matter. In fact, it detracts from usefulness and you lose a quality working dog when you go too extreme in size. The variation is there to imply that a 17.5"" bitch or 24"" dog is not automatically out of the running. That does NOT mean a 13"" dog or a 30"" dog is acceptable. The working ability will be impacted. There is a reason why Corgis have the body and substance of a 45-50lb dog and why Shelties do not normally herd cattle.  This line of reasoning is completely flawed. It goes against the nature of the Aussie."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,cpersall,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"Nowhere have I said size doesn't matter. I quoted the ASCA'S breed standard where they mention preferred size. I do not, and will not ever, encourage irresponsible breeding for just looks or size."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,0,Tue Jun 30 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"I have a mini-aussie. He's around 40lbs and not much smaller in height than a regular sized aussie.   When I got him from the breeder, she had two smaller Aussies breed to make ""mini"" aussies, but the lineage was pure Australian Shepherd who were in shows with AKC registrations."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,cpersall,-1,Thu Jun 25 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"If the parents were ""standard"" Aussies, then the puppies are all ""standards"" as well, since there are no height/weight requirements for the breed. It really is all about politics, though."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,4,Fri Jun 26 01:13:47 2015 UTC,"There actually is height requirements in the breed standard.    SIZE:  Preferred height at the withers for males is 20 to 23 inches; that for females is 18 to 21 inches, however, quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size.   It's not all politics. It's about keeping the breed what it's was bred for."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,overpriced_popcorn,-1,Mon Jun 29 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"You quoted exactly what I quoted in another comment, but allow me to draw attention to ""preferred height"" and ""quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size"". It's preferred, but not a disqualification."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,4,Mon Jun 29 21:59:40 2015 UTC,"Right but an overly small or overly large dog is not going to do great. It would have to be amazing otherwise. Like a 17.5"" bitch that has amazing movement and structure would likely still finish her CH. If she was to be bred, the breeder would probably pick a stud from lines who tend to be larger to make up for it. There still is a preferred size and to purposely breed outside of that is not breeding to standard and would make one question if it's truly an aussie. There's no way you could throw a 12"" dog in and and even have the judge consider it. The standard is still there for a reason and preference for size iswithin the standard. That ""not sacrificing quality for size"" is referring to within that 18-21"", not any size as long as it looks like an Aussie. The dog would then be losing type. Not a DQ but a fault. And the farther you go from the standard, the more severe of a fault."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,overpriced_popcorn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:33:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending mini aussies or other ""designer breed variations"" of the breed (or any breed), nor am I suggesting that someone should intentionally breed outside the preferred sizes, but there is, technically, no size restrictions or ""requirements"" for the breed."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,2,Mon Jun 29 23:37:43 2015 UTC,Yes there are. It says so in the very top of the ASCA standard: anything that detracts from his usefulness as such is undesirable.  A tiny size is absolutely undesirable as it detracts from the dog's working ability.
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,cpersall,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:08:43 2015 UTC,"And I'm not arguing that. I am talking about the use of the word ""preferred"" in lieu of ""restrictions"". There are size preferences, not restrictions."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"The restriction is the dog's functionality. A mini is no longer functional.   There are no restrictions on the number of eyes, but clearly 2 eyes would be preferred to 3 eyes or no eyes, right?   Minis//MAS completely deviate from the intention of the breed."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,cpersall,0,Tue Jun 30 03:13:54 2015 UTC,"And again, I agree with you! I'm not the one who used ""preference"" instead of ""restriction"" in the standard.  I am not a fan of minis, definitely not toys, or designer breeds at all. I am a fan of responsible breeding to improve the breed.  I really think we're ""arguing"" on the same side, it's just semantics."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,rvtjess,2,Tue Jun 30 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"Yes there is. That's why it's part of the breed standard. When's the last the last time you saw a 12"" Aussie or a 26"" aussie competing in conformation? Exactly. Never. Because there's a size in the breed standard."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,wazupbro,-1,Mon Jun 29 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"""Preferred"" does not equal ""restriction""."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,cpersall,4,Mon Jun 29 23:41:28 2015 UTC,And with what experience and qualifications do you speak?
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,jfbruin,-1,Mon Jun 29 23:50:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that I'm not a condescending person, for starters, and also MANY MANY aussie breeders in other groups and forums who have discussed just this in regards to the ""standard vs mini debates"".  I'm out. Not gonna sit here and argue semantics."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,kittymonger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"I recently got a mini aussie a few months ago from one of the reputable breeders I found on MASCA list of approved breeders. The one I had seems to be a really good one. The puppy came with lineage and health test for both parents including hip,eye and MDR1 so you know you're getting a genuine aussie instead of the ones that was cross breed with some other breed. If you're really looking for a good breeder I would suggest visiting their site. The down side is the wait. I had to wait a year and a half for my pup since the breeder would not give me a pup unless the temperament fits and he only had like 2 or 3 litters a year. All in all it was definitely worth the wait and I wouldn't ask for a better dog. Do note that mini aussie are just as active as the regular one. Simple one hour walk in morning and night won't satisfy their needs. Prepare to do a lot of jogging or throwing frisby to wear them out. The only time my pup needs a break from play is to drink water ;) definitely not a breed for the faint of heart. Good luck on your search."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,snoralax,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:28:32 2015 UTC,"so you know you're getting a genuine aussie   From asca:   The Miniature Australian Shepherd, North American Shepherd, North American Miniature Australian Shepherd, Miniature American Shepherd, and/or Toy Australian Shepherd breeds are not recognized as a variety of Australian Shepherd by ASCA. The club considers such dogs to be a distinct and separate breed and will not accept them into its registry.   A mini is not a genuine aussie."
AustralianShepherd,3b3ioo,cpersall,-4,Tue Jun 30 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"Less than 20 lbs is a toy I believe, minis are between 29 and 50 lbs. Only dog snobs call mini Aussies American Shepherds. Best dogs ever. All Aussie in a small package."

AustralianShepherd,3a92ur,UpnUpvote,9,Thu Jun 18 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"Not exactly the same, but I have a mutt myself that's Rottweiler/Pitbull/Aussie/Lab. Somehow, he came out looking like a golden retriever. He's a great dog, a bit of a leaner (which I've heard Rotties can be). He'll knock you over if you're not paying attention and he puts his 70 lbs into your legs. He's not incredibly tall, but he's built. He definitely has more of a lab personality than anything else, he loves everything/everyone. He's also a little mischievous and chews things when I'm not around to correct him.  Here are some pictures!  Adoption Day  More recent  Modeling"
AustralianShepherd,3a92ur,poopfeast,6,Thu Jun 18 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"Mixes are a grab bag. It could be more aussie, more rottie, or a more even mix. Is this a dog from a shelter or rescue group?"
AustralianShepherd,3a92ur,cpersall,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:45:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding. She's from a rescue group. She's 3 months old, short hair, looks more like a rott, very docile. They said she's gonna be anywhere from 40-50 pounds (I'm looking for a medium sized dog so that's perfect). My biggest question mark is if she's going to have a lot of girth to her or be more fit looking.   Also, I know Australian Shepherds have longer hair, but she does not.   Edit: http://m.imgur.com/dC1Tq0Y"
AustralianShepherd,3a92ur,cpersall,2,Thu Jun 18 06:54:10 2015 UTC,"Cute! Any history on her? Do they have the mom as well? Just wondering if her mix is known for sure or a bit of a guess. Her fur is quite smooth for a longer furred double coated mix.   Unless the mom was a very small aussie, I would guess that the pup may end up even larger than that. The weight they gave you is pretty average for a purebred aussie, and obviously a rottie is all around larger.   A rottie that's in good shape is still a very athletic looking dog. So even if she ends up like more of the rottie build, she can still be a nice looking dog who can and will want to be active."
AustralianShepherd,3a92ur,ddawn215,2,Thu Jun 18 07:14:55 2015 UTC,"Rotties are very active dogs and extremely loyal. I've had a few (never owned my own dog, but every person I've lived with has had dogs) and I've been around quite a few rots. They can be wonderful companions. I say see if they know her parents too, that will help a lot for you. I once had a Rottweiler/Chow mix. He was a bit too protective and territorial, but all around a great dog. A home body though."
AustralianShepherd,3a92ur,Fubster620,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:55:57 2015 UTC,"They get to be pretty big. They're very athletic and will knock you down if you're not paying attention. Mine were a bit overprotective and territorial, but were amazing companions. Would recommend."

AustralianShepherd,39bvyu,mustangsal,5,Wed Jun 10 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"When I used to shave my Aussie, I used Epi-Pet sun screen for dogs. It's sprayable. When he was young he had an almost pink snout and nose, so I would just spray a little on my hand and then dab it on his nose. It works well and it's pet safe! They have it on amazon. Also, enjoy the awesome hair free house for like 4 months!!! Also, anyone who may say the hair won't grow back properly can go kick rocks. My dog was shaved every summer for 6 years and his coat still came back in beautiful."
AustralianShepherd,39bvyu,tintedrosie,3,Wed Jun 10 19:27:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of dogs don't ever have issues growing back their coat. Some of them will be fine being shaved for years then randomly their hair won't grow back properly. And a few can be shaved once and it'll never grow back right. I've only been a groomer for a little over a year now, but from what I've seen, aussies typically don't have issues growing their coat back out."
AustralianShepherd,39bvyu,Demgoats,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Yeah, my best friend is a long time groomer and she's said the same. Obviously this is different for other breeds, but with my two Aussies I've never had an issue. Plus, they're summer swimmers and it's so much easier on the pool filter (and my roomba)! Full coats this year though because they're both in my wedding in the fall, so I'm battling through the crazy shedding!"

AustralianShepherd,39bvyu,Merandy,2,Wed Jun 10 19:48:53 2015 UTC,"Make sure that you get one designed for pets. You don't want him licking it off and getting sick :( We have to use sunscreen on our girl's nose because she is a red merle and her nose is very light. She got a really bad sunburn last year before I got the sunscreen.  I haven't had any problem with my boy's fur coming back in right. We tried not shaving him, but he was so miserable in the summer that we broke down and took him to the groomer (not as short as Cooper - poor Cooper :) ) and we have done so every summer for the last 8 years. He's so much happier and bouncier when he gets his hair cut, and in the fall/winter his gorgeous double coat grows right back in."
AustralianShepherd,39bvyu,anillop,3,Wed Jun 10 23:29:48 2015 UTC,He got into something and the groomer was only able to fully clean him up by way of a buzz cut.  This is the same dog.   So... any tips on sun protection until he the fur grows back?
