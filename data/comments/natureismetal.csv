Uhh, well - the weather guys said it was going to get windy.  Why in the fuck would you do a ""Controlled"" burn on a windy day in Colorado when everything is dry?

natureismetal,3dsp2a,Boo_R4dley,3,Sun Jul 19 21:11:39 2015 UTC,schenkstroop   As an Australian you have me intrigued to what a schenkstroop is
natureismetal,3dsp2a,Zorzarix,4,Sun Jul 19 22:45:29 2015 UTC,"Based on what I can see from the ingredients Schenkstroop looks like it's probably pretty close to the artificial pancake syrups out there taste like, perhaps a little closer to caramel syrup though."
natureismetal,3dsp2a,Zorzarix,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right, although it does sound a little negative. Are those artificial pancake syrups you speak of made with corn syrup or with actual sugar? Because schenkstroop is made with sugar afaIk."
