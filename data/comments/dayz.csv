dayz,3e25rz,TheEuphoria,76,Tue Jul 21 11:19:32 2015 UTC,Its like upgraiding your russian tractor to drive 200 kmh
dayz,3e25rz,GoldarsGoldenPot,40,Tue Jul 21 11:31:14 2015 UTC,"This.  Now, I love the game. But we're 1.5 years into development on the stand-alone. From an objective standpoint, it's kind of depressing that it takes actual work on the consumer's part to make it function in a pleasing way. I just got used to playing it at 20-30fps... another depressing fact. Bring on the hate if  you want, but I'm not going to get riled. I'm not being passionate about how much I hate the game or anything, just really disappointed with it lately."
dayz,3e25rz,NinjaGrandma,18,Tue Jul 21 12:38:56 2015 UTC,"i just hope that by the end of the year, we can play at 60 fps and look at the alpha times and be like ''We survived the Dayz Alpha''"
dayz,3e25rz,GoldarsGoldenPot,14,Tue Jul 21 13:43:37 2015 UTC,You'll look back on DayZ Alpha with fond memories. Mark my words.  I've been in enough alphas and betas to know that all the bugs and weird issues are a large part of the fun and charm of a game. Infact one of my favourite games ever was a buggy POS (Ultima Online).
dayz,3e25rz,Miserygut,11,Tue Jul 21 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"people do the same with the ""old mod days"" when they forgot how logging in used to take 15 minutes if at all. I remember sitting at my pc looking at that black screen for ages thinking ""it's going to be worth it""."

dayz,3e25rz,AstroPilot,4,Tue Jul 21 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"maybe you right, i hope that after dayz is in Beta i still have the awesome feeling the day a new patch comes out and brings something new to the game."
dayz,3e25rz,GoldarsGoldenPot,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:49 2015 UTC,He is right. Hicks just tweeted that EXP servers don't need to restart for 12 hours... how can you not get excited about that kind of progress. It may take years but thats just how this stuff goes.
dayz,3e25rz,tearinitdown,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:08 2015 UTC,"I loved the game when you could remove buildings, tree's etc... I had done that a few times and gained 60 FPS just by removing the tree's.    When i could remove buildings i used to sit inside the walls on the airfield and sing to players. I would NEVER shoot or kill anyone i would only ever sing. It was rather funny.    I sent BI messages on 3 seperate ways to stop this from happening and they done nothing other than inform players if they do this anymore they will get banned.    Duping was fun. Everything you cant do now was a bit of fun until it got fixed. Alpha's give you the chance to experiance every last part of the game intended and unintended.    When the game goes full release i'll still love it (If the game runs better) but i will always remember those days when people would pop out of nowhere, people would spawn lots of alts and stand in a line for fun etc...    Ok i get it shit like this pisses people off but back when it first was reported people had a blast until people started to abuse it for personal gain."
dayz,3e25rz,JamesTrendall,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"I always found it funny how hard they always went against duping. They patched most duping methods before they acknowledged hacking to be a massive issue in .51-.52 and worked with BE to prevent that.   If you could somehow figure out a duping method that would require the new render to come out to be fixed we'd have the new render tomorrow.   For this reason I just simply do not report duping methods (if I come across one, and I'm aware of one in .57). I know it would get answered but when they deny any responsibility for public whitelisted servers and do nothing to combat that, despite numerous reports, which get deleted and you're told to go to the server hosting company, then hey find someone else to help you find the only bugs you're willing to challenge today."
dayz,3e25rz,nexdemise,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:11 2015 UTC,Jeez if you guys were here for the entire mod journey you would have already stopped playing a long time ago.  I mean really it's dayz Rome wasn't built in a day.
dayz,3e25rz,datchilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:35 2015 UTC,But I can play DayZMod on 60fps and I often prefer it to SA for that reason.
dayz,3e25rz,NinjaGrandma,6,Tue Jul 21 17:34:02 2015 UTC,Game optimization doesn't happen until the game is finished. They will optimize it in the last few months of completing everything else.  Somehow people love to forget this.
dayz,3e25rz,Sapian,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:45 2015 UTC,"I think he is aware of that. He just said he doesn't the SA right now, but possibly later, when it is optimised."

dayz,3e25rz,Pestosterone,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:03 2015 UTC,You don't optimize until close to the end of development.. I get the concern but its not an easy task to take a mod built on the ARMA2 scripting engine (which is terrible for the architecture DayZ needs unless you want hackers) and rewrite the engine while building a renderer. It doesn't depress me honestly because I'm excited about every step forward... I work at a software company so maybe I'm biased but the dev team is actually doing a great job imo.
dayz,3e25rz,tearinitdown,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:45 2015 UTC,"I am not shitting on their work or them as creators. Maybe I just wish they had a larger team to work with so things would be fixed in large patches instead of weekly smaller fixes. I still love the game. 600 hours isn't a huge amount of time to spend playing a game when you look at it, but it's more time than I've ever put into playing... anything. I've made friends that I play other games with that, without DayZ and especially this subreddit, I wouldn't have the pleasure of knowing."
dayz,3e25rz,NinjaGrandma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:08 2015 UTC,"Yea but thats not how you do things in software dev. The more you change the harder it is to figure out what might have caused a new bug. Smaller, incremental updates that are more targeted is the way to go."
dayz,3e25rz,tearinitdown,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:00 2015 UTC,"I always loved the engine argument because it's so self-defeating.  The engine is shit, but we picked it because it's our engine, so now we have to turn a tractor into a helicopter, but the engine is shit and we simply cannot do some things, get off our asses, not our fault we made a decision to use this particular engine."
dayz,3e25rz,nexdemise,6,Tue Jul 21 20:14:01 2015 UTC,isn't that a subjective standpoint from your pov as a consumer that expected more?
dayz,3e25rz,BonzeHero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:05 2015 UTC,No. I was attempting to make an unbiased assessment. Every person expects functionality to one degree or another.
dayz,3e25rz,NinjaGrandma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"Even in the disclaimer on the steam page (and again when you buy it) it tells you that it will be super buggy and at times most likely unplayable. I don't understand why anyone would buy it without EXPECTING it to be like that. Plus, the amount of time it takes them to make the game is really not relevant. Things that ultimately seem insignificant can take months or even years to fix or implement. The renderer will have taken a long time to get built and by the time its fully used i still doubt it will be ""amazing"" but it will have been necessary to complete the game."
dayz,3e25rz,PastorWhiskey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:54 2015 UTC,optimization in alpha? not really
dayz,3e25rz,BonzeHero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:48 2015 UTC,Didn't say optimization.
dayz,3e25rz,NinjaGrandma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"But we're 1.5 years into development on the stand-alone.   And none of that time was devoted to fixing performance. There is no point when fundamental parts of the engine is not in place yet.   Anology:  A car studio is building a custom car. They start with the frame of the car. Then the different systems like an engine, tires, a battery... and so on (I'm not really too familiar in what precise order things are assembled in a car). They have been working on the car, assembling the engine and so on and yesterday they ordered the two back tires from the retailer. The battery is planned to be put in next week. Meanwhile, another team has started working on the car body. The customer who ordered the car comes in every Tuesday to observe the building process because the people making the car is interested in the customer's input. They ask him if the engine is ok, they do some tests on it (temperature and what not), his answer is: ""I don't really like the color of the car. Also, it's not fast enough.""  ...Not exactly accurate because we already have the fundamentals down (I'm shit with anologies), but the point still stands. Just because they have been working on the game for a long time (not really that long), doesn't mean they have failed to fix performance. It has not been a priority."
dayz,3e25rz,jeppeake,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:27 2015 UTC,"Well Bohemia isn't known for optimization, so...."
dayz,3e25rz,deathbytwofootfall,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:12 2015 UTC,It's still in alpha........
dayz,3e25rz,zim1985,5,Tue Jul 21 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing though, I don't think it's what we think. I don't have a clue what it could be but here's an example.  Arma 3 suffers in exactly the same way. You can load up the editor, you can roll around a city and pretty much do what you want and it will be flying at 120fps. You can even add lots of AI characters and it will hold up reasonably well.  Then you join a server - the FPS is awful. I don't know why playing on line with other people causes the FPS to drop, it doesn't make sense to me."
dayz,3e25rz,Hazzman,8,Tue Jul 21 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"1.5 years is nothing when developing a game and and engine to go along with it. Call of Duty spends two years to make their shitty remake games, and that's on a simple, already finished engine that they've used forever."
dayz,3e25rz,PanthraxIV,3,Tue Jul 21 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"Usually, other game don't change their engine mid-development."

Personally I could never set view distance so low, but you've definitely dialed in the settings that affect FPS in cities the most.  Once the new renderer is in and they have occlusion culling properly implemented, we won't have to dig into the config files at all (fingers crossed)."
dayz,3e25rz,sim_owly,9,Tue Jul 21 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"No I couldn't either my friend :) But then I don't play on the coast, at all. Just thought I'd see if it was possible as a bit of fun.  Regarding the renderer.... I'm with you there dude... crossed fingers, toes, arms, legs, eyes, balls.... :)"

I can stress test for hours at 4.8GHz just fine with my temps staying around 55c so I feel I have some headroom in the temperature department, not much, but some. For some reason though, even if I crank the voltage up I cannot avoid a bluescreen at anything over 4.8. So how the fuck you do this?!"
dayz,3e25rz,hawksaber,3,Tue Jul 21 13:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's literally luck of the draw, AKA ""Silicone Lottery"".  I have an i7 3770k that I had to do some crazy extremes to, just to hit 4.9GHz and I couldn't run that 24/7 due to high temps even on a custom water loop with a LOT of radiator surface space.  This chip was just a good one, but I still had to Delidded it, use pure Gallium liquid metal as thermal paste, spend hours and hours lapped and polished IHS and water block, and run it on a custom loop.  Funny enough, the temps at 5.5 ain't actually crazy high. During this test on DayZ it only peaked at 77c, with the TJ Max being 105c, that's perfectly safe. But the voltage IS high! More than I would be comfortable running 24/7.  Some chips just point blank will not go over a certain voltage.

It's apparently not designed or been updated to Properly stress any chips newer than Sandy and therefore isn't ideal or safe in some respects.  Use AIDA64 Extreme, they do offer a free trial.

dayz,3e25rz,thematt924,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:56 2015 UTC,"Those specs would make a nice rig dude :)  If you don't mind I would make a couple of small suggestions.   If you want to Overclock, make sure you get the ""K"" version of a CPU. Overclocking takes a bit of learning and patience, but it really isn't difficult or dangerous now days. Overclocking can help increase the time between upgrades. i.e. A CPU at 3.5GHz will start to struggle with games a lot sooner than the same CPU at 4.5GHz. (But it does require a better Cooler, the Intel Stock cooler will Not suffice) The 4690k is about the best CPU for modern games. The 4590 is good, but won't Overclock, and is clocked lower straight out the box. As for RAM (Memory), 2133, 2400, 3000... even 9000MHz won't make the slightest difference over 1333 or 1600 in 99% of games. It will help with Video editing, rendering e.t.c. but not with games. Save some money, and get 1600 or 1333MHz. EVGA, ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte are super reputable brands that make the best cards on the market. PNY, Inno3D, Palit make some good cards, but they do also have a lot of bad cards that run into issues."

I'd love to get a smoother framerate in game but a lot of the ""dayz higher FPS guides"" I find on youtube and reddit seem to contradict one another. One guide says ""this is the most important thing to tweak!"" another guide says ""actually that has nothing to do with anything."""
dayz,3e25rz,JamesTrendall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:24:41 2015 UTC,"The chances of achieving this on a normal day to day basis in-game while running round, is slim to none. This was just a balls to the wall test to see if under perfect circumstances it could be done.  The overclock was a BIG help to achieving this. The tweaks are simple, dramatically reducing the distance at which trees, buildings e.t.c. will render, also reducing the overall quality of textures, but not to the point of absolute potato quality.  And lastly... Yes! Most so called ""Super FPS improvement guides"" are next to useless. Most rely on Steam Launch Parameters, which have been proven to Not work. Also, dropping some important setting like ""scenecomplexity"" to insanely low levels, like 10,000-50,000 which would make it impossible to see players past about 50 meters."

This chip (i5 3570k) was just a good one, but I still had to Delidded it, use Gallium (liquid metal) as thermal paste, spend hours and hours lapped and polished the Integrated Heat Spread on the CPU and the water block, and finally run it on a custom water loop.  I recently helped some mates of mine with their new builds, one was able to OC 900MHz over the turbo, 1.3GHz over stockclock, on Air.  Whereas the other struggled to hit 300MHz over the turbo on Water. And at the roughly the same temps and voltages.  It's in the hands of the Silicone Gods..."

I've seen people report that ""this fix gave me 20 fps!"", while it gives me 2 fps or nothing at all, or vice versa. There's no ultimate fix, some may work for you, some may not. It really depends on the hardware, and as is the case with this engine, better hardware doesn't always mean better performance. I know one guy who's had the same computer for over 3 years, while i have been slowly upgrading mine in the same time. I have compared his performance with mine regularly, in Dayz and in Arma 2 and 3, he has always had significantly better, or slightly better FPS than i, no matter how much i upgrade. I honestly think that this engine prefers older hardware in some cases.  That ends my rant on this peace of crap engine :p I sincerely hope they make a new one for their next game. Doesn't matter how often they improve the engine for their next game, the core optimization problems always persist."

dayz,3e1x3x,OldWorldNomad,3,Tue Jul 21 10:16:36 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, devs already said you will not be able to take clothes off zombies.

Reason being performance hit on server, if zombies had regular inventory and you could undress them O_o.

Giving the zombies each clothing article as an item for them to have randomly is not going to happen because it'd be too heavy on server performance. However, it is perfectly possible to make several zombies with the same clothing model but different skins attached.  By the end of zombie development you'll have so many zombie types that you need not worry about each having randomized clothing because there are so many to encounter."

dayz,3e1x3x,gr33ni3,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:35 2015 UTC,"I guess it all relates to the question of context- i.e. how long after the infection has spread is the game set.  There has been talk of having zombies decay over time too, which I think would be awesome and add a further dynamic to the game."
dayz,3e1x3x,The_George_Cz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that is a great idea. However, it brings up the question, how would you determine the Day Zero from which zombies would decay?

More to the point- what difference will it make asserting this on reddit?  I don't see what tangible difference it makes.    This whole debate seems more beneficial to ensuring technically 'correct' info makes it into the content of a potential game intro (when you boot the game) upon release, as opposed to the benefits seen in game by interpreting them as infected or zombies- which, atleast right now, is none.  I think the whole argument is pedantic personally.  There are 3 million copies sold or more and you think most people dont refer to them as zombies?  You think this ruins the context of the game?  I don't get it man, sorry.  Unless you can come with an argument with regard to game mechanics etc then I dont see what difference it makes refering to them as zombies or infected.    The only thing I can think of, that makes this whole Infected argument valid in terms of the actual game, is the idea of a 'CURE'.  I highly doubt this will ever be implemented by the dev team.  My point ultimately is- I don't see what is at threat with people referring to them, colloquially, and therefore rightfully as 'zombies', and its a damn shame we cant have any constructive discussion on here without people chiming in killing the potential of it."
dayz,3e1x3x,T0NZ,0,Tue Jul 21 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not here to argue with you, just providing the correct information. It is a fact that they are infected and not zombies."
dayz,3e1x3x,Phantom_Gremmie,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:15 2015 UTC,Yes but why did Chris specifically call them zombies in his tweet? You are being too dogmatic here. The devs call them zombies all the time informally on streams and in interviews.

dayz,3e1x3x,gr33ni3,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:53 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that, but really- not helping what?  Why does it matter in terms of how the game plays?  The principal difference is purely that these Zombies/Infected can RUN (e.g. 28 Days Later).  Referring to them as either zombies or infected is not going to change that fact.  I think everyone needs to agree that 'zombies' is a colloquial term (George Romero would agree), isn't inaccurate, and that the argument is a bit redundant and pedantic.  They were always refered to as Zombies in the mod, even if they were technically 'alive'.  If you have seen 'Day of the Dead' then you will also know that the Zombie 'Bob' doesnt appear to be technically 'dead' either.  This is not exact science here- its fiction and therefore completely open to creativity.  If you want people to understand that they are not technically 'dead' in Dayz, what difference does this make?    Why not discuss why calling them 'Infected' is significant to the actual gameplay, and develop some ideas to share with the developers, instead of shooting down people who rightly refer to them colloquially as zombies?  If you want to be exacting then in the context of The_George_CzSoon™'s post- all living and dead things, and inanimate things DECAY.  Should we change the reddit banner too?  (I see zombies! ;)  Let people refer to them as zombies if they want, the devs will decide what manifestation of 'zombie' lore they are in game.   Thats my opinion.  FTR the models look awesome."

I wonder if heli spawns are related to central loot economy or is it separate, i.e. if all heli crash sites are looted on server, would loot respawn or is it based on a set time?"
dayz,3e20we,sim_owly,2,Tue Jul 21 12:25:42 2015 UTC,I would interpret that to mean that the helis have their own timer which makes them completely independent of the server restart.  It makes sense since their goal is to make it so that the servers can go for several hours (perhaps days?) without a restart.  A server with a 24 hour restart would seriously nerf the helis if they didn't despawn/respawn on their own.
dayz,3e20we,sim_owly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:38:34 2015 UTC,I agree with you. However running towards a heli site that then disappears when you get close could kinda lose a little realisim. I guess the chances of it happening are small though.
dayz,3e20we,barber107,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mentioned in another thread that perhaps they could delay the despawn when players are in the area.  I have a hope/hunch they're already doing this with corpses because I've seen bodies despawn in 10 minutes, but also linger for 30+ when being covered by a player.  This combined with randomizing the despawn timer (say, a random range in a 3-5 hour window) could prevent most of the immersion-breaking stuff."

dayz,3e10x5,Fragbert,49,Tue Jul 21 03:15:34 2015 UTC,"Not a game developer but a professional software developer for 15 years. I've been playing DayZ since early in the mod (ah 2 hours to get on to a server).  The pace of development seems very reasonable to me. A lot of the complaints I hear are from people who don't really get what software being alpha means, and why it's not just a-little-worse than a beta. Most people aren't used to seeing things at this stage.   The most interesting thing looking from the outside in is what we can infer about their development process from the bugs that are fixed and the kinds that appear.   Lay people can't understand just how difficult it is to construct a system like this, and scale it up to the number of concurrent players we have now. I give them a total pass on the performance troubles. That's hard.  I have only one criticism and that is the number of times we've seen re-entrant bugs around small game-logic things in items and inventory. It feels like automatic unit testing around that area is weak. But even that's been getting better.  Make no mistakes, I love this game and I'm behind the developers and I've made my money back many times over already in enjoyment."
dayz,3e10x5,jagu,6,Tue Jul 21 06:34:44 2015 UTC,"I'm in basically the same boat though I'm a sysadmin, at my place we ship custom hardware and we have been working on a new version for the last month with about 2 weeks to go, we're massively behind schedule because we are changing the process on how we provision, test, build, and configure these boxes. From the outside it looks like we should be able to just use the old way but with the new hardware when in reality we have had to to change about 10 different systems anything from rewriting small parts of the process to creating whole new bits of software. When you have so many moving parts things break in unexpected ways and you then have to sink days or weeks into fixing those issues and adjusting the overall process and system which obviously sets you back.  I can only imagine what it would be like if the public was sitting in on this calling us every name under the sun because they don't see all the underlying changes that need to be made which are completely invisible to them. Bohemia have my respect and while I'm not overly happy with the game as it is now (so I don't play it) I'm looking forward to what they do with it once its done."

dayz,3e10x5,tearinitdown,0,Tue Jul 21 18:23:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, and let me very clear here; ab-so-fuckin-lute-ly not.  Here's why.  When the game was initially slated for development it was slated as a ""slightly better version of the mod"" with a little extra/unique content.  A new engine or even a massively altered engine was never part of the original plan and rightly so (there is no way to predict the future).  Lo and behold the game sells beyond anyone's anticipated sales projections and is, as far as sales go, a resounding success.  If BI had stayed the course then, finished out with the legacy architecture and called it a day they would've made money hand over fist and delivered on their initial promises...but that didn't happen.  Instead they wanted to gut the old stuff and replace it with something new while also developing a software platform that they could reuse again later.  Now at that point they could've taken all the work that they had done up until then and basically started over with it in a new engine.  Paid the licensing fee to use someone's else's engine and gotten to work tailoring it to fit their unique needs.  Any profits they put into licensing or making their assets fit a different engine would be less than directly injected back into their company.  OR they could custom tailor an engine that is totally unique to DayZ, an engine that they could freely reuse later; and thus inject that money right back into their company like a shot in the arm.  So it made fiscal sense to develop their own engine.  They have the monetary assets to do so and it will benefit the company in the long run.  It also has tremendous benefits to us, the players.  Because you don't have to try to squeeze ""the square peg into the round hole"" things will (once its done) simply work.  In addition the team will be seasoned and masters of using the engine; which translates to even better development dividends.  The only draw back is that it takes more time, and that is really the only draw back.  Hope this clears it up :)"

It feels like automatic unit testing around that area is weak.   I was thinking about that many times since I don't understand the inner mechanics of those things. To me it seems, they change systems to often. Was the inventory taken over from arma or not? Was it a new system designed for standalone? Since they revamp it now once again. Why not think it through and make it solid? Is it that complicated? I mean things like losing items shouldn't be possible. Take something out of the inv into your hands, then the user tries to put it back, there is no room in the inventory, what now? Item vanishes as a solution/byproduct wtf? No way to describe this, that's just ridiculous design-wise. Even if prototype and early robust/basic implementation?"

People like to compare it with pacing of other games, like ""look how 7 days to die has so many new features!"" but they keep forgetting, that games like 7dtd run on Unity, which is a complete engine. You just make a bunch of models, write a script or two and you're done, you have a new feature. You don't have to worry about rendering materials, optimizing FPS or working on a lighting module. DayZ is making their own engine, so those things I mentioned are not just ""included in the package"" - you have to write them. You have to write how the single triangles in that model will get rendered. You have to write how the light will react with that model, will it be specular light or ambient light. Lots of other low-level stuff that is granted already in engines like Unity or Unreal Engine."

If there was an off the shelf engine that could handle that, I'm sure they would've gone with it immediately.   Don't take my word for it though. This has been addressed by the devs in detail before, so I won't butcher their words by trying to remember everything."

To do that and allow the public access to it is madness! I've used this illustration before - It's like remodeling every part of a house at once AND living in it at the same time.    Because that is definitely true. It's like trying to rebuild an old truck into into a porsche - while driving it in a public race event. Some people will say that's impressive - others will say that's a terrible idea, at least if you're planning to reach the goal anytime soon (preferably, with the finished porsche).

Chances are the tools aren't as polished either.   I have no doubts that this is much more work than porting the map to another engine, along with a couple of features like realistic bullet behaviour. I mean, you said it yourself - the reason other games are faster is because of their engines. Even Star Citizen uses CryEngine, which wasn't developed for space mmos, specifically.

At first, when I heard about them using an old engine and replacing parts of it I was a little confused by their choice, but it makes a lot more sense now. The old engine will have a lot of parts working near perfectly and there would be math libraries/utilities that are complete, there's no point reinventing the wheel after all. Building an engine from scratch would mean rewriting a lot of stuff that's already there, so I understand their choice and look forward to the solid game that will come.   As far as development rate, they're doing a great job. People complain about the slow update pace compared to other survival games that have popped up, the thing is those are mostly built on existing commercial game engines where an update can be as simple as drag and drop a file, make some small adjustments and press build... They are writing the bloody engine as well as updating features, I take my hat off to them.  Hopefully, one day, the impatient and ignorant ""fans"" will realise what this has all been for, we test, we provide feedback and in return we will get the game we're all waiting for. And we will, the mindset of a dedicated game dev team is something else, this shows time and time again with the DayZ devs thus I know they won't stop until it's exactly as it should be.  tl;dr: I have a masters in game development, I think development is going well, with a such a dedicated dev team they will keep going until it's perfect."

They also still would've had to rewrite the renderer and the server client architecture so we would've waited a few extra years for the same things. The renderer in ArmA3 still has simulation tied into rendering which means server performance still affects client fps which is terrible for big game modes with many basebuildings objects/scripts running. I'm sure other modders will agree but I personally am very excited for what the enfusion engine will offer for modding, the addition of enscript (which looks a lot like C# to me, any software devs able to weigh in?) the renderer being so much more robust, with server performance finally not affecting client performance and general improvements such as multithreaded rendering, multithreaded 64 bit clients, multithreaded 64 bit servers we will see mods with massive basebuilding elements that just aren't possible in ArmA 2 or 3. There could be hundreds of different modded buildable objects available to players with most likely thousands and thousands able to be on the map at one time where in ArmA 2(3) client fps will absolutely get floored around the 1,500 to 2,500 mark depending on your server hardware. Not to mention the more performance friendly scripts that should be able to be written in enscript and the scripting commands that will add to the already thousands available in sqf. All in all I'm very excited for the future of modding for DayZ with the enfusion engine and it will allow for many things that just aren't possible with the current ArmA 2(3) engines."
dayz,3e10x5,DiPDiPSeTT,0,Tue Jul 21 14:27:32 2015 UTC,They have to do most of that stuff already because they're using the A2 engine. They're no better off now by using the A2 engine vs just using A3 from the get go
dayz,3e10x5,OpossumSemen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"My point was they would have had to do it for either engine, but the A3 engine wasn't complete when they started development so to start off with the A3 engine would've delayed the project a year or two and they still would've had to do most of the same things meaning we would now be a year and change behind where we are now."

I ran 2 epoch servers and a wasteland server with very limited issues after whatever patch that was (can't be sure it was 1.34).

It's a real shame that people continue to argue with those who know what they're talking about. People don't realize that Bohemia has invested a lot into this game, and their future titles also depend on DayZ because of the Enfusion engine. Arma engines aren't all that flexible. At all. Enfusion is going to be a lot more flexible, which means they can produce different types of games (instead of simulation-type games) and produce them quicker.  Before DayZ, there really wasn't anything in Early Access with this scope, and people can argue all they want and say that Rust and H1Z1 are (going to be) better games in general, but in reality, they aren't as complex. Both already had bases to start from in terms of engines, which just leaves asset creation and coding to be done. (I might be a little naive here, but it is kind of true.) With DayZ, we are watching the birth of a new engine, and yet no one seems happy about this. I think people don't understand that Bohemia is an already established business that used EA as a type of pre-order and that Dean didn't even want to do this type of EA because he knew exactly how it would pan out; a bunch of impatient people complaining about the bugs and how ""slow"" the process is, and he was exactly right.    It's a sad reality that is becoming the norm in gaming culture that if something is in EA, people are like ""We want it, and we want it now!"" which leaves games stagnant because some developers can't handle pressure or receive death threats from stupid fools who really don't know anything about developing games or software at all. The devs have been great recently at communicating with fans and non-fans alike, answering questions on twitter, and they have been patient with most of us asking the same questions every single day. Perhaps it's about time we did the same for them, and be patient with the game while it undergoes these changes instead of trying to flame the devs for trying to make the game even better for the future. Don't ignore the warnings that appear on the store page, and the one that comes up before you even play the game. It is early access alpha. It will have bugs, and it will have bugs for a while. Here's a quote I've heard somewhere: ""You fix a bug, and 5 more will pop up in its place because fuck you."""
dayz,3e10x5,Realtra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:24 2015 UTC,"Spent some time in game QAT, and what people need to consider is two things. Typically when QAT is brought in the game is already substantially more developed than the early Alpha build we started on, and the purpose was to iron out bugs. This however is still in the development stage, meaning they are still adding features they want in the game, whereas the polishing comes after the fact.  Be patient, this is a game with a grand scale (very few multiplayer worlds are this open ended), developed on a hybrid engine using technology that is behind. Once they finish with the features they want and implement the new render engine, then I am sure they will start fixing the bugs you all so heavily lament."
dayz,3e10x5,zanaan01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:01:41 2015 UTC,"Used to be in game development, working for one of the major publishers and have a few (no big hit) games under my belt on various platforms, in teams ranging from just 5 people to nearly 150 people. Now I'm mainly doing freelance work and my own little projects while transitioning into another industry because games can be a very volatile and unstable place to be.  What I remember most vividly is the feeling that the sky is falling, constantly, all until just a couple of months to final build when magically every piece the team has worked on for months and months suddenly fall into place. There's a lot of self doubt and worry, sprinkled with occasions of awesomeness and joy.  I'm sure it's the same for the DayZ devs. Add to this the fact they are doing this more or less in public to an unforgiving audience that has no clue as to what goes into making a game. Just thinking about it gives me the shits.  Professionally I'm impressed with what they are doing, and I'm understanding to all the issues they are facing working with that engine of theirs (man, it can't be easy). Personally, and as a huge DayZ fan, I wish it would go faster because I can't wait to play the final product that I'm sure will be a lot of fun!"
dayz,3e10x5,The_Eastman,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:39 2015 UTC,"I worked in game development as a pro for 4 years. Most of the artists I worked with complained about our speed of development being too slow (and were not interested in innovation, just wanted a pub on their resumes.). So perhaps my perspective is skewed.  I would say development on this game is too slow. This is not an attack on the devs. I think they are probably doing as well as can be expected. The team is too small for the project.  The real issue for DayZ is their market window and the allocation of resources. Without proper funding (where did our money go?) they really can't do enough fast enough.  About 3 years ago I put together a demo indie game. Real-time overhead 2d thing. The demo, which looked polished but was ""candle wax and strings"" took 2 months to author. It was in the state that most games go 'greeen lit' on Scheme Greenlight. I then spent 1.5 years developing a proper game engine and unit testing it. Now I am back to writing the game proper.  So 2 months vs 1.5 years: that is the general ratio for direct game coding versus engine development. (Part time, I have a day job in CS research) There is a significant difference.  That being said, it is easy as a techie to fall into the trap of developing reusable systems that will never be re-used. Knowing when to switch from layered engine dev mode to agile game code mode is a critical skill in games development.   Finally, engineering fun is not possible. Exploring fun with agile development is. So one must switch over at some point. Some companies overdo content pipelines. Others overdo engine dev. Others stretch bad engines. There are always trade-offs."

There are a lot of things which need to be considered when developing in a project which has the scope of DayZ. First of all you need to develop the tools to be actually able to configure and program stuff. This takes a lot of time and is almost a never ending story. You are not only developing a game but also tools to alter the game at a later point. For example the API to support the new scripting language and the scripting language itself.  Then you have workflows, processes and build routines which need to be maintained and developed. Additionally the hardware side (servers) with multiple different ISPs and so on. And then there are stupid bastards which find it a good thing to DDos your servers so you have to fix your routings.  And then you have to migrate an existing shooter engine to work as a massive multiplayer online engine from the ground up.  I have the highest respect for the developers. Developing DayZ is no easy task and they are doing pretty good."

As much as I respect the words of the other developers in the thread, I personally believe that DayZ's current state is unreasonable given the amount of time they have been in the development (and Alpha) process. I have worked on numerous projects as big as, and sometimes bigger, than DayZ, and the majority of the games saw improvements (regarding performance, content, optimization) far beyond that of DayZ's current state. I understand that it is unfortunate that Rocket left the game in a relatively poor state, especially after making wild promises that are far from being delivered, but there are still many bugs around, or that have only recently been fixed, that were present in the first releases of the game two years ago. Yes, it is much more difficult creating an engine than using an older engine, but there is a degree of negligence that must be considered, and an almost 'lazy' feel to the development. Though this may be completely wrong, I feel as though the developers are not truly listening to what the players want, instead brushing it off as an ""everybody's a hater"" attitude, giving us another vehicle over performance upgrades or game-breaking bug fixes.   As neutral as I want to be regarding my opinion, it is difficult to do so after playing the mod religiously for years, becoming extremely excited at the promise of a blossoming standalone, and then being presented with DayZ in its current state."

DayZ does have problems as far as development goes, but considering the scope of the game and the size of their team, I can understand some of it. What I don't understand is how some VERY important things like the netcode, desync issues, renderer issues and other user experience issues (controls mostly) seem to take so long to fix. You would think that they'd put more time and money right now to make them work. If this were a closed alpha, those issues would be acceptable, but this is a public alpha. If those basic functionalities of the game don't work correctly, how can you test everything efficiently? Just seems backwards to me. IMO, adding new mechanics does fit in alpha but the minute tweaking of said mechanics should be done during beta. Doesn't serve much use to tweak a mechanic to perfection when the next mechanic you add just completely breaks it.  Is it perfect? Nope. Is there better on the market? Yeah there are games that have a better development process right now. There's also much worse too. All in all, there are some parts of their development cycle that could use some improvements."

The principals are the same; but someone whose never developed any software wouldn't know that.  Good luck trying to educate them.   I can compare it to other early access games   No you cant.  Every piece of software is unique in many, many ways.  For instance, most other Early Access games are built on top of a completed engine and not a custom engine developed in house.   But look at the roadmap   Roadmaps aren't even remotely accurate and I've never seen one be met item for item on time on any piece of software from the very small to the very large.  Developers just need to stop releasing them; they should be kept for internal use only like they are meant to be.  The general public cannot comprehend the fact that its a lose guideline at best and in most cases just arbitrary dates with the order in which you plan to merge features.

I worked on the animations for various characters, and did some texturing (added pee stains to various corners of the house, and rugs) and a little modeling. It was pretty interesting to walk around the studio and see the modelers all with various drug paraphernalia on their screens, I even helped with a gas mask bong, but it's not that common to walk around a professional studio seeing bongs, pipes and various other drug related objects.   We actually used Unity, and while it is a game engine, building one from the bottom up, while implementing various additions, would be a nightmare. We ran into quite a few issues just with Unity, so I cannot imagine doing this all on a platform that isn't close to being completed.   With all said, I don't think they are doing bad. I wouldn't say they are moving quickly, but again, working with a whole new engine in the process of being built, would add to that time indefinitely. In fact, I wouldn't even fault them if they took even more time. Personally, I would rather have them build it right, taking the time they need to ensure quality, which, I believe they ARE doing.   People are just impatient. I understand it too. As a gamer, I feel like I have been playing the Alpha for a long time.

I think they are doing great, and I am going to remain patient while they build. I think if people had a chance to work in a studio, and see the back end stuff, they would change their inpatient tune."
dayz,3e10x5,ThinksHeSpeaks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:57 2015 UTC,Worked as a QA Analyst for SCEA San Diego and SOE.  I believe the development is fine. It's a massive game and multiple issues WILL arise. You can fix one bug which can in turn completely fuck something else up and create 30 new bugs. It takes time. There's no magic button that you can click and make better. Trial and error. I'd rather have developers take their time and fix it to make it right instead of rushing it. A lot of complaints come from players that just don't understand the concept of alpha testing and just want a finished product from an unfinished game.   I do believe their priorities could be skewed toward more important issues instead of small bits of content here and there. Just my own opinion though. Can't make everyone happy.
dayz,3e10x5,FalconTI,2,Tue Jul 21 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"Not a game developer or software developer, but I'm incredibly well versed in many IT fields and I have a lot of education on the subject. DayZ is doing just fine. I'm impressed at their speed actually, and how well they're keeping the community updated with status reports, Twitter updates, and just generally talking to people.       The biggest thing I see people ask is ""why did they use an old engine instead of Unreal 4 / Unity / Arma3 / X?""       The Arma engine is incredibly complex. It allows so many things to happen - just shooting a weapon has many different elements. The engine calculates bullet trajectory, velocity, penetration, damage, etc. That's for every single weapon and caliber. Then it takes into account if it hits a target, or if it hits an object first.        Did it hit a wooden door, lose speed, damage & the angle changed, then impacted a player wearing a vest? All factors which need to considered and calculated.       Other games such as CoD, CS:S/CS:GO don't have that. Bullets travel instantly, bullet penetration damage is simple. Even Battlefield, which somewhat replicates actual bullet physics, doesn't reach the complexity of Arma / DayZ.       Having their own in-house engine that is already capable of doing that work is better than trying to build new, or license elsewhere. Again - that's just for one example of the overly complex things that the Arma engine does.        Games like Rust are incredibly simple when compared to DayZ, so they can be afforded to have different engines. Overall, it's just a better choice to take their own engine and modify/improve it for DayZ.       Anyone who is interested in learning about this should look it up - it's pretty interesting how complicated a lot of the stuff going on is, especially if you play Arma since there is more going on in Arma (right now) than in DayZ."

But if i were to scale what we did for our senior project and our skill level with professional and the scale of their project i'd agree. They are doing the same amount of work as we did when compared to them being professionals.  we spent roughly 6 months making a RTS that worked over a LAN network. Nothing locally. Time constraints and we wanted something different.   The final product had a level 2D level editor, some pathfinder and player vs player mechanics. Unit building and resource gathering.  Needless to say, for what we did as senior project, it was not as impressive as we would have hoped.  It was far from being complete. It would have been very early alpha. Maybe even concept since our terrain was not that great.   I regards to a score if it were to be released for sale as is? 1/10 for sure lol"
dayz,3e10x5,Spinager,0,Tue Jul 21 04:31:34 2015 UTC,"Self taught myself some coding, 3d modeling, animation, and level architecture. With just myself a small project takes a long time. But I mean the time it takes its frustratingly long for devs and gamers. Even so we need to accept the fact that modeling that house over there is going to take 3 hours and money won't make it go faster unless you want it to look like shit. And dayz is kind of cursed because it uses models & textures from an old game and uses an old engine. Things already look dated and the engine might as well be trying to fix a train with a toothpick.    TLDR: making stuff for games takes time and it's frustratingly long for BI and us."
dayz,3e10x5,PyrosEnjoyPieHW2,4,Tue Jul 21 07:00:41 2015 UTC,"me, but still studying in major:game development. As far as I know, game development is much much harder than normal programming work because you need to considerate EVERYTHING. Beside that, I am also a non-professional 3D modeling artist with Maya, compare my work with models in Dayz, I have to say that art works in Dayz is one of the best!"
dayz,3e10x5,qwer4790,0,Tue Jul 21 07:14:37 2015 UTC,"Well, there are many more systems where you have to ""consider EVERYTHING"" so I wouldn't put a game on a pedestal. Imagine a banking application for a mobile or a website. There is a lot of pressure here to make it secure and you have to consider EVERYTHING as well.  Game development is complicated, no doubt about that, but I wouldn't put it above other complicated IT systems."
dayz,3e10x5,Myzzreal,3,Tue Jul 21 08:29:58 2015 UTC,"the difference is that creating a banking application has no pressure from the public like dayz has. you can finish your product and then display it to the public. dayz has to justify every action immediately, which puts a lot of pressure on the dev team"
dayz,3e10x5,ElDschi,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:42:01 2015 UTC,"They got the cash upfront though. It's a give-take and that's the decision they made so they should go with it without complaining.  Also at the banking application or any other big app made for a client is subject to immediate justification. After each demo you get feedback and you get judged, most often by people who have no idea how development works, so it can get frustrating."
dayz,3e10x5,Myzzreal,3,Tue Jul 21 12:37:47 2015 UTC,"Soz, I feel like building a commercial game takes a lot more effort and thinking about than a bank system. Especially multiplayer games that include this much. A low budget indie game on the other hand - a lot less work."
dayz,3e10x5,TrevorWithTheBow,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:46:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah go tell a developpement team of an OS or an ERP that a game is more difficult to develop they'll have a good laugh at you   Not even talking about Oracle Datawarehouse designer, or IA developpement."
dayz,3e10x5,Mrpoussin,4,Tue Jul 21 09:01:05 2015 UTC,"I was talking about a banking system. An OS is another level of difficulty again, I wouldn't even begin to compare that to game development."
dayz,3e10x5,TrevorWithTheBow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:23 2015 UTC,"Banking system are mostly programed in Kobol wich is an old langage and very few people have the knowledge to iterate on those problem. Banking system are the most secured and complex software existing, involving Monstruous database infrastructures and heavy maintenance work.   Developping game allow a lot of approximation due to the gap between Hardware tech and software tech.   Tl dr : Game are not one of the most difficult things to develop."
dayz,3e10x5,Mrpoussin,2,Tue Jul 21 11:27:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely not, (not that I said they are) ever tried programming neural networks, advanced recognition systems etc? Bloody hard work. I'm not trying to generalise game development as the hardest of all software creation. I'm saying a ""bank system"" does not require the time and effort needed to build a game like DayZ. As you say, old Kobol systems, most banks use the same outdated software and make some adjustments because it works and it works well. No point reinventing the wheel, cost efficient and saves effort.  tl;dr: Not generalising games as most difficult, it just doesn't take a team of DayZ's size to build a bank system."
dayz,3e10x5,TrevorWithTheBow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"I've actually done both. Even more, I did a hybrid - a multiplayer game in a web application :P  It all depends on the scope. A single player game is simple. A massive MMO experience is very, very difficult because of scaling issues, synchronization and what-not. But exactly the same scaling and synchronization issues are apparent in advanced web systems.  The client side of a game is actually the easy part (in case of large scale multiplayer games)."
dayz,3e10x5,Myzzreal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:02:19 2015 UTC,"Of course, some web apps are massively complex and present a lot of the same issues and scope can vary massively, for both games and other software. The difference in this case being that a banking app wouldn't have to emphasise on sounds, map design, high quality models for every single item, interaction with a virtual world, physics, AI, player controls etc. What they may have in common - a quality interface and advanced web/server security. Just feel like a lot more things need considering in the case presented xD"
dayz,3e10x5,TrevorWithTheBow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:02:34 2015 UTC,"What you're talking about is UX, which in case of web apps is very different, but still complex in a way. It is not easy to make a proper layout using all the available tools such as CSS, JS and the more modern ones like Less or Sass and a plethora of frontend technologies. It's completely different from making maps and models and a UI for a game so I don't think we can really compare them. Of course you can make a simple site with basic styling but so you can make a simple game with basic graphics."

dayz,3e10x5,TrevorWithTheBow,2,Tue Jul 21 10:47:39 2015 UTC,"Even without the blah blah C# I can say that they are fine. Development takes time and alpha doesn't mean ""wait a year."""

It's really hard to give each person a task, and even more planning how long they will take. Also because we weren't good programmers, I wanted to rewrite some parts each week (for the looks), but the others did not like to destroy their own work.  Also Merging the version of each other was a hassle, because sometimes they did not know what they changed until we forgot it and lost 7 days of work, because we forgot to implement it into the main branch.  Server-Client connection was also super annoying (I had to do it ;( ), because it was super unstable and lagged really much. I am always astonished how dayz and all other Multiplayer games do it. They have to send x y x, speed, damage, team etc.  Physics was also super annoying, until we used the library JBox2d. Because nearly each month our scope changed. As example we only worked with boxes until one of us had the brilliant idea to implement slopes, easy to implement but those bugs, super annoying. Boxes kept clipping through slopped, which stopped the player as example.  Even though it was he'll it was fun (except for Server-Client connection), but now I understand a little what is going on behind the scenes of BI, chaos, murder, exploding harddrives, moar explosions and a fight club.

Basic vehicles Advanced loot distribution New renderer New Zombie AI Basic stealth system (zombies and animals) Diseases Improved cooking and horticulture Advanced anti-hack system (Dynamic BattlEye)   Most of the planned features are either lacking,malfunctioning or completely missing,for example...  Loot distribution is malfunctioning and loot explosions are a common occurance.Not to mention the current unresonable high amount of canned items and weapons everywhere.  Next up is ""Basic Vehicles"". I'm really not a man of high expectations,but i'd expect to see a couple more models by then. We are deep in Q2 and we have yet to witness the 2 other vehicles  Zombie AI is....broken? How much more should we wait for functioning infected?  How can you people call DayZ a zombie game  when the infected are almost non existant and no threat at all?  Same like diseases and advanced cooking,i'd expect at least a zombie transmited disease and at least a couple of cooking recipes. All we got was cooking on sticks and cooked fish models. How's can you even call that ""advanced"" ?  Do i have to be a dev to see that they have barely achiveved just the bare minimum of their planned features?  Let's take a moment here and be resonable! After all that time that passed,do you think they are on track with their schedule?"
dayz,3e10x5,Damndeadyourman,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:30 2015 UTC,"You missed the point of this thread.    Do i have to be a dev to see that they have barely achiveved just the bare minimum of their planned features?   No, but you have to have an insight to development to understand WHY. And bitching about how progress is going without understanding how it works doesnt make sense at all. They want to use the new engine for upcoming games that may or may not be in development already so they have to consider much more things than dayz itself."
dayz,3e10x5,tempest1234567890,3,Tue Jul 21 10:50:44 2015 UTC,"The Enfusion engine is just a shinny new name for a heavily modified Arma 2 engine.  The point of the Standalone was to surpass the mod's restrictions.  Looking back to it now,it's funny that the SA proves to be more restricting than a mod.  Also where are those so called ""modules"" that are gonna save the game? We have been waiting for improvement for the last 2 years.  Arguments are worthless if there's no solid evidence to back your claims.  You can't just keep defending on good faith alone,that's ridiculous!"
dayz,3e10x5,Damndeadyourman,2,Tue Jul 21 11:35:33 2015 UTC,How do you look back at something when one half of the comparison you're trying to make isn't even finished?  Please don't talk about backing up claims.. there is nothing you have said to back up yours.
dayz,3e10x5,Ack_Ack88,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:47:32 2015 UTC,"Loot distribution is malfunctioning and loot explosions are a common occurrence   Yes.  Every aspect of the game is and will be a WIP all the way up until release.  Believe that.  Features will be missing, incomplete, and broken.  This is how software development works.  It's not finished until its finished.   Not to mention the current unreasonable high amount of canned items and weapons everywhere.   Thats your opinion and something that can and will be tweaked.  Remember a few versions ago when canned food was nearly nonexistant...that's perfect to me.  Probably not to you and not to many people.  In fact, some people might believe that there aren't enough guns or food.   Next up is ""Basic Vehicles""    Which is in, and moving towards a more advanced system too.   i'd expect to see a couple more models by then. We are deep in Q2 and we have yet to witness the 2 other vehicles   Models =/= features.  They want to get the system itself fleshed out before they start adding content like crazy.  That way each asset doesn't have to be revisited.  But you wouldn't know that (which is fine) because you don't develop software.   How much more should we wait for functioning infected?   They function pretty ok if you ask me.  They don't hit through walls and floors like they used to (in fact it hasn't happened to me in idk how long).  They dont run straight through things anymore.  You can sneak around them, etc.  Are they a resource hog?  Yes.  Are they nearly nonexistent as a result?  Yes. [Alpha]   Same like diseases and advanced cooking   Doesn't say advanced, first off.  Secondly you are getting ""features"" confused with ""content"".  It's an easy mistake to make and if you haven't worked on some form of software before.  The disease and cooking systems are in, and tie in with the crafting system pretty well.  Now its just a matter of adding to them...which is a task usually reserved for beta.   Do i have to be a dev to see that they have barely achiveved just the bare minimum of their planned features?   Apparently it would help.  At least then you would understand the ""why"" instead of complaining about content when what you should really be focused on are features.   After all that time that passed,do you think they are on track with their schedule?    Yes.  Building a new engine takes time and time is all we have.  You have to choose.  Do you want something now regardless of completion, regardless of quality, regardless of quantity or would you rather wait for them to bring it up to their standards."

Alpha is for adding (functioning) features,not just eye candy mechanics.The point was to overcome the mod's restrictions and make the SA a superior game.Do you honestly see that happening any time soon?  I know better than anyone that building an engine takes time,but truth is,i have yet to see actual results on their progress.  Been here from the start,2 years have gone by,how can you ask people to keep their faith intact without seeing the fruits of their labor?  I have all the information regarding upcoming features but very little on the programming side.  All i know is their intention on switching to a different scripting language,the work on the new Renderer which is months away and plans for eventually replacing the animations systems.  I don't have any estimates on whether these features have already or will begin initial development or implementation.Really makes me wonder what have the programmers been doing in 2 years.  I will support DayZ's development,but i refuse to listen to excuses and be part of mindless circlejerks."
dayz,3e10x5,Damndeadyourman,-10,Tue Jul 21 15:29:37 2015 UTC,"That's what i'm waiting for,quality new features   No, you are waiting on content.  It is different.  When you say ""new cars"" that is content.  When you say ""new cooking recipes"" that is content.     Besides hunting,the rest of them malfunction. Are you really O.K with that?   Yes, because I realize the game is not complete.  It is not fleshed out. And it is in active development.  The game in its current state is not permanent.  So yes, I'm perfectly fine.   Alpha is for adding (functioning) features   See, another clear indicator that you have never developed a piece of software.  Of course you want that new feature you've developed to work right out of the box but that is rarely the case, especially when you are merging it with millions of lines of established code.  Especially when you are merging it to a live client facing version with literally billions of variables involved.  Shit is going to break, guarantee it.     Do you honestly see that happening any time soon?   I see it happening when the game is done, absolutely.  Thats the point; thats the reason the game was released into open alpha testing instead of closed...because the devs [wrongly] thought people would enjoy testing and watching the game grow.  They were woefully wrong, more wrong on that front than any other.   I know better than anyone that building an engine takes time,but truth is,i have yet to see actual results on their progress.   Then you obviously dont know as much as you think you know about developing a game's engine or the backend of software in general.  You don't see results until the shit is complete.  They're not going to piece meal in stuff, force new systems to work with legacy systems unless they have to or its beneficial.  When we do get the new engine it will come in the form of a handful of very large code mergers; not a trickle.   Been here from the start,2 years have gone by,how can you ask people to keep their faith intact without seeing the fruits of their labor?   Because they don't have a choice.  Anything you do in life is going to take X number of hours/days/weeks/months/years.  People getting upset or whining or playing the entitlement card does not change that fact.  More conductors don't make the train go faster either.  So patience is all there is, and all there can be.  2 years is a drop in the bucket compared to how long a truly massive game takes to develop.  Most AAA games are in development for 5+ years with alpha versions so broken you would blow a fucking gasket if you played it m8.  You really would.   but very little on the programming side.   People have trouble just understanding the simple things; it would be a fool's errand to try to educate the greater public on complex systems involved in programming...which is why people either spend years self educating or have to get a degree (and even then are in the dark on a lot of things).   I don't have any estimates on whether these features have already or will begin initial development or implementation.Really makes me wonder what have the programmers been doing in 2 years.   And I'm glad they stopped giving estimates.  Estimates are bull shit.  Vapid.  Not useful.  Totally superfluous.  All they are is a beating-stick for people to use when a deadline is missed.  The developers have been fucking crucified more than once for missing a date they've announced and their smart to shut their mouths about that sort of thing now, finally.  Instead of giving more ammo to people who simply do not and will not understand.  Like this statement for instance:   makes me wonder what have the programmers been doing in 2 years.   How on earth can you not see the obvious?  Do you even read the change logs (it seems like you do)?  I think what you are saying here is ""i see what they are doing but its not what i want therefore they are doing nothing"".   but i refuse to listen to excuses   Then don't.  I don't either.  But I know the clear and stark difference between an ""excuse"" and a ""fact"".  If the devs come out and say ""we need to push the renderer back because blah blah blah"" then I take that as a statement of fact.  When you say something like ""I think the programmers are sitting on their hands"" thats your opinion and not a fact.  Thats not how business works.  Thats not how development works.  BI doesn't want this project to drag on forever.  If someone was fucking off they would get fired.  ESPECIALLY if they had been fucking off for 2 years.    But then...a lot of folks think thats exactly whats going on.  They're all over there, just fucking off in the office 5 days a week.  No one cares about the game, they are perfectly OK with working on it forever.  No one there knows what they are doing and BI as a whole is a shit company that is going to drop the ball.  You know what I say to that: ""then why aren't you out there doing it, showing them how its done""  Because you cant.  Because you really don't know what you are talking about.  Because even when someone tries to educate you on something you throw up the walls and put your fingers in your ears and start going ""lalalala im right fuck you im right lalala"" and then call people fanbois or say its a circlejerk or say people are making excuses.  edit:  i might cuss a lot but I want to be clear, im not mad and ive got no hate or anger towards you.

Also,i can't be very linient,seeing them sell over 3 million units with 2 years development and an experienced staff under their belt.  Even Overgrowth that has stayed 7 years in Early Access,didn't have the luxuries of the DayZ development team.  Unlike other project in the market that took 5 years,DayZ didn't start from scratch.They used a premade map (Chernarus) and started with Arma's legacy systems and assets.  They didn't make the engine from a blank sheet of paper,unlike other projects (Rage engine:Gta V or Witcher 3: Redengine)  If it was Ubisoft,Rockstar or another AAA game company,in the place of BI,having a game like DayZ in the same state in Early Access,how do you think the fans would react?

Yes this is all fine and good but when it comes down to ""do we push this update"" time scale needs to not be included in that at all.  Rushing is bad.  Pushing unfinished is bad.  Let me put it like this...you have various gripes with the game and thats fine no one can make you like certain things or be happy with them.  Now imagine if the thing at the top of the list was ""on time"".  Yeah we would be on time but the game would be far, far more broken.   Keep in mind that alpha dosen't make the dev team invurnerable to criticism.The project at the current state resembles nothing like an open zombie survival sandbox game.   You're right it doesn't, but there is a difference between criticism and bitching for the sake of bitching.  For instance, content isn't as important during alpha stage, features are.  So complaining that bikes aren't in is bitching, not criticism.  It doesn't resemble at all a ""open world zombie survival sandbox"" but it does resemble an open world zombie survival sandbox that is in development and thats all anyone can ask right now.  Core features first, then content thats how this works.   Even Overgrowth...blah blah blah   You cannot compare this game with others and get any kind of worthwhile metric.

Do you have any idea how long it took to develop GTAV?  The only difference here is that you are allowed to play DayZ while its in development.  If you think the alpha builds of GTAV or any game for that matter are some how bugfree, running at 60fps, and feature complete you are fooling yourself.  IN FACT alpha versions for games that are being developed internally are generally monstrously broken and buggy to the point that ""totally unplayable"" doesn't mean you starve to death quick it means that shit doesnt even start.   All things considered,i think people have been very understanding and patient towards DayZ.If it was another game most of them would have left ages ago.   Nah, I don't see that.  I see most people expecting the game to have already moved through beta and into release by now.  I see people who didn't bother to read any of the warnings yet still come here to bitch about it.  And besides, let them leave.  It doesn't matter, they're not going to suddenly ""unbuy"" the game.  It would be best to anyone upset to uninstall, stop posting here, and just come back for beta or release.  Best route for all involved.   When i say programmers,i mean those who are in charge of developing the engine modules   Ah, ok that makes more sense.  But like I said, those branches of the source code will come in large sweeping code mergers when its ready.  They don't pay small dividends throughout development in most cases; they pay huge dividends all at once.  And you're a good guy too.  We may not agree with each other but thats ok.  You are obviously not a troll whose just wanting to bash on the game because its the ""in"" thing to do right now; and while you may be misinformed on somethings (through no fault of your own) your heart is in the right place and no one can fault you for that."

dayz,3e10x5,PyrosEnjoyPieHW2,4,Tue Jul 21 04:14:54 2015 UTC,"I am not a game developer but i have collected some knowledge from here and there. (ue3,unity and mostly game maker).  I cant say much about dayz and its developing, but i can compare it to some other early acess games.  I bought reign of kings some time ago and have been following its development because i really like the game. And the game runs almost completly smoothly all the time. It has bugs, but the performance is good. I read all the patch notes, and it seems that the developers are really focusing on bug fixing and optimising, and after that they add new content.  I feel like its the opposite with dayz. I would play it again, but i just cant run it at 60fps. Not even friends with 2times better pcs than me can run it on more than 40fps. I can run it on 30 but the game looks like its from 2000... even worse, even half life 2 looked better than this.  After i bought it back then, i really enjoyed it, and the performance was ok back then, but it seemed to get worse every patch. I started it up 7 months later on stable, and it was just unplayable.  I see that a lot of new stuff is getting added, but all i want is a game that runs smoothly in 60fps."
dayz,3e10x5,ZimBeans,-2,Tue Jul 21 07:04:08 2015 UTC,"Reign of kings is made on unity. They have a solid base engine. DayZ is creating key parts of their engine, so it is a bit different."
dayz,3e10x5,ICANTTHINKOFAHANDLE,6,Tue Jul 21 08:05:16 2015 UTC,"Why dont they switch to unity?  A lot of big games run on it fine. Like rust and RoK. Sure it would take some time, but if that means that the game will finally run smoothly, then why not."
dayz,3e10x5,ZimBeans,-2,Tue Jul 21 08:13:02 2015 UTC,They plan to use the enfusion engine for future BIS productions
dayz,3e10x5,Edoian,3,Tue Jul 21 08:36:29 2015 UTC,"Well dayz is coming out for console, i wonder how that will turn out.  I could bet not very good... If my high end pc can't even run the game, then how a console."
dayz,3e10x5,ZimBeans,-4,Tue Jul 21 08:42:52 2015 UTC,"Your high end PC is having trouble as the enfusion engine isnt complete yet, occlusion culling isnt taking place and multi core support isnt active, DX 11/12 isnt implemented and numerous other optimisation strategies have not been completed yet.  The game wont be ported to console until all these issues have been implemented."
dayz,3e10x5,Edoian,5,Tue Jul 21 09:31:30 2015 UTC,"The engine is terrible!  Do you have proof on progress suggesting otherwise?  Last time i checked,Eugen said that the Renderer still requires months of work and will not be a panacea on the game's problems.  Where's the progress on the rest of the modules? Just take a look on what the devs said themslelvs...  Viktor (Lead animator) can't even blend animations. That's why everything ingame feels robotic.  Chris (Lead Art) said it's impossible for rivers and seasons as the tech was ancient and functionlity was missing.  Eugen had to work 24 hours around the engine's code just to make a couple of small bugfixes.  And the best part is,that even with the new modules in place,some of the formentioned features would still be impossible.  It's easy accusing people being ignorant of development but that's not remotely correct.Most of us that criticize have been following DayZ from the mod and done our research.  Stop incorectlly asuming that Enfusion is going to be leap and bounds ahead from the current Arma's RV engine.The legacy tech is just too outadated,it would be a miracle if the Renderer even slightly increases performance!"
dayz,3e10x5,Damndeadyourman,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:16:23 2015 UTC,"The engine is terrible!   To say the engine is terrible is a irrational thing to say.  Its impossible to judge if the Enfusion engine, when completed, will be terrible or amazing.  Its not been released/completed yet so its an impossible question to answer, just like I cannot answer if the planned human trip to Mars will be a success or not.   Do you have proof on progress suggesting otherwise?   I'm not in the development team, so no.  There have been some updates on status reports over the last few months on progress.  Is it taking longer than they originally anticipated? Yes  The Enfusion engine isn't going to be the best engine ever developed for all features (weather effects/water effects) but it will be good at other features which are may arguably be more important.  I prefer to be optimistic (which is strange for me as I'm normally a pessimistic individual).  I'm not going to prejudge on what the finished product will be as thats a stupid thing to do."
dayz,3e10x5,Edoian,3,Tue Jul 21 13:32:38 2015 UTC,Which is bogus considering the ARMA III engine is 10000x better than DayZ in it's current state right now.  Anyone expecting miracles at this point are just lying to themselves.  Just look at the DayZ Overpoch mod in ARMA III as an example of what DayZ could have been at the start of development if they just started with a superior engine to begin with.
dayz,3e10x5,AaronC31,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:02:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, they should also have used the ArmA 5 engine back in 2013.  Whats wrong with these developers not using engines from the future?    They are full of fail!"
dayz,3e10x5,Edoian,2,Tue Jul 21 10:25:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure which planet you're living on, but ARMA III released in 2013.  Don't act like ARMA III was years away from being finished when DayZ standalone came about.  They could have started with the same internal build that the core Bohemia team was working with as well.  But no, they chose the beyond terrible ARMA II engine.  You can keep telling yourself whatever makes you feel better."
dayz,3e10x5,AaronC31,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:41:14 2015 UTC,"Here are the details from the horses mouth:  ""ArmA3 engine was a work in progress, especially for multiplayer. We needed a very basic system that was known, complete, that we could use as a foundation. I wish we could have started with A3 but we would have had to delay the project 2 or 3 years before starting."", Dean Hall"
dayz,3e10x5,Edoian,4,Tue Jul 21 10:44:17 2015 UTC,"Once again, which is bullshit.  Considering, you know... multiplayer was about the only thing that released with ARMA III on release day and the majority of singleplayer shit was delayed quite a while.  Which should be red flag #1 that what came out of his mouth was pure bullshit.  Just like what most of Dean said with all of his broken promises.  But like I said... keep believing everything they say if it makes you feel better.  His words don't match up with anything that actually happened and if you weren't so blind you'd see that."

dayz,3e10x5,Edoian,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:54:28 2015 UTC,"I'm just tired of people blindly defending this game.  It's so far behind it's development roadmap that it isn't even funny.  A staple of DayZ Standalone was supposed to be base building, and it's no where to be seen yet.  All the while H1Z1 has been in development for 1/4 of the time and it already has features implemented and working that the DayZ developers have been promising for the last few years.  I love DayZ as much as anyone else on here, but it's time to start being real about a few things"
dayz,3e10x5,AaronC31,4,Tue Jul 21 10:57:54 2015 UTC,"It can be frustrating that the game is taking what is often perceived to be a long time to develop.  If they were making the game on top on an already completed engine, im sure it would be much faster, but that is not what they are doing.  You may feel this was a bad choice from the developers and you are free to have that opinion.  Its just an opinion though.  I can see that they are evolving a new engine and that can take 5+ years for big games to do (Unreal Engine 4 took 9 years).  Everybody wants the game completed yesterday, but I guess Im more patient than most.  You may be tired of people blindly defending the game development.  Im also tired of people blindly attacking the game development.  It reeks of ""I want my toy, and I want it NOOOOW!""  The game will take the time it takes to complete.  Being patient is a great life skill to learn."

dayz,3e10x5,Ack_Ack88,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:16:37 2015 UTC,I hope they end up using the unreal 4 engine. DayZ would look so sick with that!
dayz,3e10x5,uberkritzkreig,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:33:58 2015 UTC,"The thing with engines is that you can't just choose any engine you'd like to run your game on. Every engine is different and has it pros and cons, and if there is no engine that has all the stuff you want/need it to have the only way out is to create your own engine (money might be an issue too).   Unity is a versatile engine, that has its strengths in exactly that versatility. it's beginner friendly with lots of models to purchase/for free and a base layer that let's you compile your game for many platforms. but that could make it slow/hard to scale, etc considering the map size of dayz, the number of players, the calculations done by the server, etc.  Unreal 4 brings its own graphics engine, a level editor and some features more. you would basically have to start from scratch recreating the game with that engine. that could be a con. the scripting unrealscript that UE4 uses could be another point against the engine.   I'm far from knowing the exact pros and cons and can only guess, but in the end i trust the dayz devs to be able to make that decision (and believe me, it's not an easy one).   One thing i'm pretty sure about is that they won't use UE4 for the game, enfusion is a step into the right direction and if they manage to create the engine the way they displayed it to the public, it's going to make the game a lot better (and even nicer to look at)."

Most people who bought this boughht it because they believe in the idea and the devs and some day this game will be awesome. So if i believe that why not buy it early and get it for a really low price while having a chance tontry out the new features and provide input. I play this game for a few dayz whenever something cool gtes released and then i put it on the steam shelf for a month or more.  How many did you expect to be playing on average?

There's plenty of complete, AAA super popular titles like GTA 5 which declined rapidly and that was absolutely huge on release. Look at Ark. I don't see anything wrong here...once the Standalone is in a better shape the numbers will rocket up, no question."

dayz,3e1xir,Blacerrr,-8,Tue Jul 21 09:32:54 2015 UTC,"So you think that the devs just throw the money at their screens and the developing progress magically makes a huge jump towards their goal? You're forgetting one, but probably the most important, factor in this whole situation. The time factor. 1 1/2  years honestly isn't that much time for a game being developed considering there are not 200 people working at this project 24 hours a day. Not to mention all the problems they ran into over time which forced them to redo a lot of things which weren't planed in the first place. I'd say for a game like this it will probably take 3 to 4 years to be completely finished and polished out."
dayz,3e1xir,Blacerrr,6,Tue Jul 21 10:05:07 2015 UTC,And you forgot that dayz had been developed before the early access for around 1.5 years with basically the same dev team as it is now except for the designers and content creators.
dayz,3e1xir,narchy,-7,Tue Jul 21 10:21:21 2015 UTC,"So you're saying DayZ Standalone started it's development the second the mod was available in June 2012? 1.5 years from that would exactly be the release date of DayZ SA on Steam in December 2013. Yeah... no... not really? Maybe only a few months and not 1.5 years and with way less people and literally no clue what is going to happen next. Don't put some random shit up. You are literally the reason why some of the devs decided to stop showing their presence in this sub reddit.  You clearly have no clue about game development, even less than I do and you are just trying to make shit up to trash talk about DayZ. At least show SOME effort."
dayz,3e1xir,Blacerrr,6,Tue Jul 21 10:41:24 2015 UTC,"Ah OK then tell me y in the sa most of the textures of items and scripts were the same as in the mod? Yes, even for the sa they took the mod as a starting base. So y do u not count the devtime of the mod to the sa devtime? They are mixing now two existing engines (from the same original engine) and change parts of it i.e.  renderer sound etc. It was a gradual transition from mod to sa but the recent changes got the devs stuck. And that's what we want to know about as early access is basically crowdfunding without charge back options but still the devs have the same responsibility in my eyes"
dayz,3e1xir,Solocov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:51:57 2015 UTC,"They are in the process of redoing every module of the engine.  They took the Take On Helicopters as a starting engine, and have been pulling out and replacing parts as they go along.  The assets from ArmaII (DayZ Mod) are there as a placeholder. Some will probably remain unchanged, since there's not point in replacing things that aren't broke.  Again. Do you read this? http://devhub.dayz.com ? Features not being in Exp / Stable is not the same as features not being worked on."

dayz,3e1xir,UltraeVires,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:20 2015 UTC,"Wow! Amazing why didn't they think of that stuff!  Why didn't they put the scripts from the mod into c++/c# and put it into the engine. Yeah I know you have to change some stuff, but those changes are just some semicolons and dots. EASY!!!  Oh and forget about the Renderer we have a professional lover here, dx9, dx11 or dx12 what are those things, just give me the code !!  And BAM two existing engines, Enfusion wasn't even partly done some seconds ago but BAM it's here, also we have the Arma3 engine, we might as well just copy some stuff.  Oh and I don't even get Refund and do not own the company in the slightest percentage but for me they have A RESPONSIBILITY to god or ethics, I don't know why but they do!!!  /sarcasm"
dayz,3e1xir,Solocov,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:25:46 2015 UTC,lol what? Can you cite an example of scripts from DayZ Mod used in DayZ SA?  pretty sure dean and the devs have said many times they did not copy / paste shit from the mod
dayz,3e1xir,deetaili,5,Tue Jul 21 11:58:32 2015 UTC,"Can you name anything significantly different that isn't TOH or ARMA3 mechanics? The only thing that isn't copied is the damn weather, and that's because it's third-party! They had the perfect opportunity to change all the things that made DayZ clunky, recognised 1.5 years into development that they needed a new renderer and have missed the vast majority of their quarterly targets, yet they're still defended without any objectivity. We're apparently close to Beta, yet there has been scarily little content or improvement since Alpha began.  As this chart shows, there's an huge drop in players. Some of this was expected of course; those who will be abstaining until release, but I suspect many are disillusioned or disinterested. By the time SA is finally released, there will be no hype left. The bandwagon has well and truly left. Too many competitor games out there now, soaking up all those players, and there will be more to come.  Those people don't post on this subreddit, so the majority voice here are those who still have faith in the game and its development. This is why fair criticism is downvoted like crazy.  I love this game and have racked up over 750+ hours. I still play, and I still have my objectiveness."

dayz,3e1xir,mavounet,3,Tue Jul 21 11:28:59 2015 UTC,"Congrats on cracking the case Detective /u/don__juanson   Firstly, those numbers aren't the total players per day, they are the peak players per day. It's not the same 15000 people playing for 24 hours. The individual players per day could be, 2, 3, 4 times higher? I don't know. /u/eugenharton could tell us.  Secondly - stuck? Take a wee look at http://devhub.dayz.com. It can't be stuck if work is constantly being completed, and pushed to Exp / Stable.   Thirdly, money does not equal speed. You could give Leonardo da Vinci $50 to paint the Mona Lisa, or $50,000,000 - it would still take the same length of time.   Fourthly, DayZ early access started in December 2013. That's 20 months ago. Very few games match their initial high numbers forever, a year, or even 6 months."
dayz,3e1xir,deetaili,2,Tue Jul 21 10:01:20 2015 UTC,"Very few games match their initial high numbers forever, a year, or even 6 months   Very few games sell 3.1 million units then have average monthly concurrent player counts as low as 10-11K"
dayz,3e1xir,narchy,-9,Tue Jul 21 10:05:48 2015 UTC,"It's not particularly scientific, fair or reasonable to compare DayZ to most other games.   Why?  Different genres have different player behaviours. Games like DOTA or CS:GO which are hugely competitive will have high player retention, and lots of people playing concurrently. It is also still in development, and an early access title. A lot of the people who have purchased DayZ have never even installed it, or only played a few hours, or have played 1000 hours and are taking a break. Then again, a lot of people will never play it again because they didn't like it as it is buggy and unstable. But regardless, you can't compare it to complete and full released games.   Le's look at four good Early Access titles within a similar genre - DayZ, Rust, H1Z1 and Ark.  http://i.imgur.com/aWUJaSv.jpg  Big peak at release, followed by a steady decline. Ark has had a great start, and the team seemed to have learned from the mistake of the others, but I predict it will be the same after 12 months or so, but with larger overall numbers."
dayz,3e1xir,Forrell92,3,Tue Jul 21 10:48:19 2015 UTC,"The fact that we are this close to the beta on http://devhub.dayz.com is what scares me, because yes nothing changed. Every bug is still here, inventory got changed, zombies too but you never know if it's for the better or the worse. New bugs are even coming out like the huge desync. This game is nice, I like to play it, and I will keep playing it but don't dream about a finished game cause it will probably never happen. The 3D engine they chose is complete shit and they can't work with it, even with €50,000,000."
dayz,3e1xir,mdswish,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"As always you redditors don't get the big picture. When sales raised from 170000 from first day to 3mio 13 months later and the daily player base shrinked 1/3 in this time, sth is clearly wrong and as it seems YOU are the one who does not understand relative numbers, detective.  Why not hire 5000 Leonardos instead of giving one Leonardo 5000 times the money? Don't tell me a game engine can't be developed by more devs parallel, as I AM a developer myself."

dayz,3e1xir,Hartela,0,Tue Jul 21 10:39:49 2015 UTC,"To push the analogy to the extreme, if you had 5000 Leonardos working on 1 Mona Lisa, it would never be finished.  DayZ, and all the early access titles are in a strange new world. The typical post-release user lifespan (Release > Saturation > Decline) is splattered on top of an ongoing development.   There are all kinds of variables that don't follow the typical trend, from people buying but not playing, to buggy periods deterring players, then new content pulling them back.  Ultimately the expected growth, followed by decline is there. But DayZ and it's EA cousins have the advantage of not actually being finished yet. So there's room to grow, and pull people back. But time will tell.  I am not refuting your argument that player numbers are waaaay down. I am just saying it's not a problem, it's expected and common across other similar games."
dayz,3e1xir,Solocov,-16,Tue Jul 21 10:55:28 2015 UTC,"It's not 15000 in total a day. That's just the PEAK during the day. Learn what the numbers mean, and then try again."
dayz,3e1xir,morjoviy,0,Tue Jul 21 11:33:31 2015 UTC,"I'd venture to say that once reliable persistence hits stable and gets to a point where people are fairly certain that their accumulated gear in tents, vehicles and barrels won't get wiped then people will start coming back and playing more regularly.  If you were to check you would likely see that the spikes upwards in player counts would likely coincide with stable releases, which are players returning to check out the latest build and see what's new.  As it is right now a lot of people feel like it's a waste of time to play and go around looting if their work and time spent ends up being for nothing once the devs do a hive wipe.  Once the game gets to a point where persistence is actually persistent, then people will come back and likely stick around.  The better performance that the new renderer will eventually bring (once it's debugged and optimized) will help tremendously as well."

dayz,3dymon,Tatanko,15,Mon Jul 20 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"Hooray! Server restarts are such immersion breakers, especially in between gun fights."
dayz,3dymon,Cookie001,9,Mon Jul 20 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"For me, they're mostly a nuisance, especially if they don't follow a normal schedule of some sort. A lot of it will be fixed by making more and more things persistent, so I don't terribly mind, but restarts often interrupt processes too (like growing plants).  All of the things I don't like about restarts will eventually be a non-issue though, so when it comes down to it, the only real complaint is interrupting your interactions with other players, zombies, and animals. That's where the predictable, strictly-scheduled once-a-day restarts will be a huge benefit."
dayz,3dymon,Tatanko,3,Mon Jul 20 17:20:23 2015 UTC,Yup. Persistence is key.

dayz,3dymon,Seryth,0,Tue Jul 21 07:04:03 2015 UTC,This whole game is full of immersion breakers. Restarts are the least of those probably.
dayz,3dymon,clint_iestwood,9,Tue Jul 21 02:14:30 2015 UTC,"I wonder how they're handling the dynamic events these days (specifically, the choppers).  Even though the loot spread throughout the map is persistent, I'm assuming the loot at the choppers refreshes at restart, since the choppers themselves are refreshed at every server restart, or at least they're supposed to be.  With that in mind, extending the server restart timer to 12 hours means less ""chopper-only"" gear available to be looted, unless they have some other way of balancing that out."
dayz,3dymon,sim_owly,2,Mon Jul 20 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"Well dynamic events these days seem to be static mainly. I haven't checked after a server restart on exp yet but people were saying that each server seemed to have a static location of a heli crash.   With them changing it to 12 hours, I'm really not sure how that's going to work with dynamic events in the game. Whether the heli crash is going to stay there for 12 hours and have respawning loot or the heli crashes will change without restart? I don't think the latter is possible though."
dayz,3dymon,sim_owly,3,Mon Jul 20 16:40:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would make sense for dynamic events to have their own timer, maybe?  So they despawn within a window after a certain period of time (for example a random time between 3-5 hours of the life of the chopper).  Perhaps delay the despawn when players are within a certain distance of the chopper.  Would also be cool if when the respawn happened, the new chopper had a whole crash sequence associated with it.  :)  I'm sure they've already discussed stuff like this internally.  At least I hope they have."
dayz,3dymon,paradox242,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I would really love to see the chopper flying and then crash somewhere.
dayz,3dymon,Aetherimp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"DayZero had a great system. AI choppers would fly inland from the coast and crash (or would be brought down by players) at random locations. There would only be a few in the first couple hours, but the closer the server got to restart there would be another 4-6."

dayz,3dymon,nexdemise,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:44 2015 UTC,A game that's not even in beta.. of coarse the experience will be hampered.. don't complain about an unfinished game.
dayz,3dymon,andro_dawton,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:32:01 2015 UTC,My problem is with the speed of development. I fear that the game will have lost too much of its player-base to enjoy a full release...
dayz,3dymon,nexdemise,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"They didn't put it out for early release to gather a player base but to have an open development with a small player base willing to play the alpha to submit bugs and problems. It's supposed to be a stable Alpha experience not necessarily an enjoyable one, once it's close to 1.0 they will market the game to the public and it will be bigger than it is now."
dayz,3dymon,SystemOfAFoX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:07:09 2015 UTC,"Where else will the playerbase go? There are plenty of other survival games out there, but we're looking at realistic ones, so that rules out a hell of a lot, then we're looking for PvP focused ones, ruling out plenty of good titles like The Long Dark, and then we're looking for one with a player base larger than DayZ, and content better than Dayz."

dayz,3e2xwa,ramrodthesecond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:54 2015 UTC,I wonder if it has to do with the horrendously bad loot situation. I am in awe at how much trouble they are having with it.
dayz,3e2xwa,treetop82,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"The last exp. patch from friday introduced some loot issues. They are aware of it and probably fixed it already for the patch today. No big deal tbh...0.58 runs surprisingly good right now, but they don't want to rush the new CLE (like a few months ago)."
dayz,3e2xwa,HYPERRRR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"Probably. But then again they're in a hole they dug out themselves.   CLE has had nothing but problems since it's stillbirth in .55, problems that weren't fixed with .57 (only circumvented by disabling persistence and making server spawn a fresh set of loot on every restart). Which will likely follow into .58 unless they manage to fix them over the next week.   So what happens next? There's two options:  a) .58 is farted out into stable 1-3 weeks from now with persistence disabled, which defeats the purpose of all the persistence items introduced (tents, car storage, etc). Fixing CLE will be put off until .59 and hopefully it'll work eventually, or it will be completely abandoned and we'll go back to legacy loot system with more bells and whistles. They already have exorcized most of Dean's ghost out of the offices (e.g. no loot for you approach to gear), maybe they'll exorcise CLE out as well.   b) They actually manage to make lootspawn correctly in CLE, and .58 gets released fine."

Shoot a message to any of them and I'll bet that you'll get a response within a day or two.   Some of you might balk at waiting that long for a response. but as others have said, the mods are volunteers and have their own lives to live. The idea of removing the downvote button has been floated around before(approx 6-7 months ago) and it was decided that it will remain.   Thing's aren't that bad here in /r/DayZ; heck this is probably the nicest and cleanest it's been in a long time. Sure; there are reposted videos by content producers, people advertising their streams, players posting screenshots of their characters at loading screens, BUT we've actually got developers coming back and engaging with the community on the status reports, we've got a lot of great content being produced and I've seen far fewer trolls shit-posting around /r/DayZ."

dayz,3e324l,King_Rocket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:09 2015 UTC,What cpu are you running with the X99 mobo?
dayz,3e324l,King_Rocket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:39 2015 UTC,I7 5930k...added to op.
dayz,3e324l,Paddy33,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess it's that DayZ doesn't currently use multiple cpu cores well, So while the new CPU is faster overall the individual core speeds must be lower.   New render should fix that as I believe it will allow for better usage of multiple cpu core and multi threading.   For confirmation check you cpu core usage while in game."
dayz,3e324l,King_Rocket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:01 2015 UTC,What does this have to do with cores? The 5930k was clocked higher than the 4770k and it even has a better architecture.
dayz,3e324l,Blacktwin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"In single threaded application the 4770k is faster than the 5930k, overclocking might not even them out."
dayz,3e324l,King_Rocket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:18 2015 UTC,Both have the same base clock speeds. 4770K has a slightly higher boost clock though. There shouldn't be that much of a difference seen in performance.
dayz,3e324l,Blacktwin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:58 2015 UTC,"Clock speed is meaningless unless the two cpus are identical. I'm just working off the results of anandtech's CPU benchmark for the 5930k in a single threaded application.  When running a multithreaded program the 5930k is a hell of a lot faster than than the 4770K, but not in this case.  Alternatively here is another source of info, cpubenchmark.net has a great list ranking cpus by single threaded performance. https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html You will see that the 5930k is nowhere near the top."
dayz,3e324l,King_Rocket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"There shouldn't be that much of a difference seen in performance.   4770K - 2,263 (5425 samples); 5930k - 2,082 (361 samples)  What were we talking about again? :) Oh yeah, helping OP."
dayz,3e324l,Blacktwin,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"Hey if you know a solution to the issue by all means post it, I don't think there is a solution (or a problem really, it's just an alpha thing) and all his other games run just fine."
dayz,3e324l,Toxsick23,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, it just felt like we were digressing. No negativity meant. :)  I agree with you."
dayz,3dy2v2,S3blapin,6,Mon Jul 20 14:00:08 2015 UTC,"I think ""it's alpha"" is a perfectly valid response to anyone complaining about sparse features (Few vehicles is a common one), bugs and performance issues (Desync, Zombie Navigation, Framerate Performance, and so on), and any lack of quality of life.   DayZ is in development, but we all bought in as Early Access players, and we are definitely perfectly entitled to criticizing the game (Mosin does too much damage, hunger is too demanding, vehicles behave poorly, loot isn't spread out appropriately, x/y/z feature would improve the game, etc are all valid things to suggest), but we need to understand: We're not developing DayZ, we're not designing DayZ, we're playing, and testing, DayZ.   Complaining about how long it takes for a feature to release (Devs need sleep too), or a bug remains ingame (There is no removebug.exe, it's a long and painful process), or how long since the last patch (Some features take longer than others to develop), is just pointless.   The devs don't need to know you want XYZ to happen, when they are already working on it, or you're sick of XYZ happening since early alpha, when you're hardly the first person to make a post on the internet calling them sacks of shit for it."
dayz,3dy2v2,Undoer,24,Mon Jul 20 23:07:37 2015 UTC,"I find this very aggrivating too.  Then people support this bullshit with:  1.)  They're opinions are valid too, we should hear them out  or  2.)  Criticism is good, the devs need it  Total bullshit.  File a fucking bug in the bug tracker or just shut up.  Your ""criticism"" does nothing, absolutely nothing but fill this board up with shit posts and useless dribble.  ""Its Alpha"" really is the only thing that needs to be said and the fact that-that is somehow an ""excuse"" or ""fanboi-ism"" is absolute proof that these people no fuck all about application development."
dayz,3dy2v2,NovaDose,5,Mon Jul 20 14:26:57 2015 UTC,A lot of these people that defend this BS don't know the difference between constructive criticism and bitching.
dayz,3dy2v2,Cairo9o9,2,Mon Jul 20 17:23:57 2015 UTC,precisely.  there is definitely a difference and the majority of the time its just bitching for the sake of bitching.

Hell you can even find other subs specifically for other versions of the mod too.  But then, expecting you to actually do any research would be an exercise in futility.  Even if this game was my whole life it would be a way, way more meaningful existence than ""/r/Dayz troll"""

Secondly, research? For posting on the internet? No, I'm afraid your rage filled post only confirmed my suspicions. You lead a sad, depressing life dedicated to a video game.

dayz,3dy2v2,deathbytwofootfall,5,Mon Jul 20 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"How was that a lie   I stand corrected.  You see, I didn't realize someone could actually use the excuse ""I like the mod so I post on the SA's board"" and not be completely ignorant to things like ""reddit search"" and ""google"".    I gave you the benefit of the doubt and assumed you were just blowing smoke; giving me a BS excuse.  So let me get this straight...  -You come here nearly everyday to shit post, almost religiously  -But you claim its the mod that brought you here  -When literally this is all you had to do.  And I'm the loser?  I come to a forum for a game I like.  You come to a sub for a game that you hate, shit post daily, and all the while the sub you actually wanted was a google search away.  Either you're a complete Luddite or 90 years old.  Either way, there's the sub you want.  Now kindly, fuck off and don't come back."

It's a game in alpha, isn't complete and is horrible because of those two facts.   I also assumed you'd figure out when you're being baited into arguments but alas, you're an /r/dayz poster. The subtle hint of being right or winning some type of trivial argument throws you people into a frenzy. A frenzy which always leaves me laughing. What a gullible loser fuck."
dayz,3dy2v2,deathbytwofootfall,3,Mon Jul 20 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"Dude just chill a little bit. You're going on to make assumptions on someones life based on a few sentences they wrote. And maybe your counter-arguments would actually be half-decent if you didn't follow up with that arrogant ""I find this so funny right now"" shit."
dayz,3dy2v2,YoloSwagginns,2,Tue Jul 21 00:18:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry, criticism is good.   As has been pointed out, there is a big difference between constructive criticism and pointless bitching. To give constructive criticism, you have to actually have knowledge of what you're attempting to criticize, whereas bitching, which is predominantly what passes for ""criticism"" on /r/DayZ, is simply a display of ignorance and impatience. Just from your posts in this thread I can infer that you're either a troll or someone who does a lot of bitching because they're ignorant of game development.   They do need it and the development pace for DayZ sucks.   Please validate this ""criticism"" with some evidence showing that DayZ's development pace is not on par with other games of its size/scope. If you think the pace sucks just because you're impatient and don't have a basic understanding of how game development works, then you're not providing criticism, you're bitching and your comments are worthless."
dayz,3dy2v2,Solipsismal,-6,Mon Jul 20 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"There is no point in comparing the pace to any other game. Once someone does it, /r/dayz invalidates the argument with some trivial retort by stating several preform responses. We could cite ARK, Rust or several other games. The fact is, the development is slow because it is in the public view. It is no longer a game sitting in the wings of development, it is in the public eye. Every day the passes is another day that it is in the market and not completed   You'll disagree, simply because you'll refuse to acknowledge this fact but essentially /r/dayz posters and fans of this game can be compared to the Westboro baptist church. Anyone who disagrees with you people is a monster but now that I've thoroughly admonished you knuckle dragging extra chromosome having retards, allow me to return to the point.   Let's consider every game that has been released to the public as a completed title. Now, of those games, let's consider how the player base reacts when critical fixes are not pushed or addressed. Now, let's compare those reactions to how the average player reacts to DayZ. If you aren't a /r/dayz poster, you'll see that they're identical. This doesn't show a lack of understanding, a lack of interest or a lack of offerings made to the Dean Hall shrine, what is shows is that this product is out there and susceptible to criticism of any kind. Is the game development slow? Yep. Game development in general is a slow process but the consumer, until recently, didn't really see it.   We could dive into a whole other discussion about how this game shouldn't even be considered Alpha but hey, that's just another point of contention. I'd totally cite the progress they've made since it went up for sale. Comparing it from then to now and I think most people will agree, this thing should have been labeled pre-alpha at best."
dayz,3dy2v2,deathbytwofootfall,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:32 2015 UTC,"So you have nothing to actually back up your claim. Good to know. ARK is actually shit on the performance side and adding a bunch of dinosaurs in their updates is not exactly progress. They've got a lot of features that are not performing well and the frames in-game are worse than DayZ. As for the rest of this shitpost you just dropped, I LOL'd. Especially at this:   Anyone who disagrees with you people is a monster but now that I've thoroughly admonished you knuckle dragging extra chromosome having retards, allow me to return to the point.   You're terrible at trolling. ""DayZ is bad because it's in the public eye, and people like me don't know anything about game development and don't bother to educate ourselves, so we offer empty criticisms that a grade schooler could point out the flaws in."""
dayz,3dy2v2,Solipsismal,-4,Mon Jul 20 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"ARK is actually shit on the performance side and adding a bunch of dinosaurs in their updates is not exactly progress.   Wait. You just said that while talking about DayZ. Let that sink in.   Also, this is why a prime example of the idiocy that is /r/dayz. You people literally cannot comprehend that this game is in the public view on a grand scale. It isn't a closed beta or alpha. It is being sold and publicized to people that have no interest in the development, all they want is a product that they can use. Of course you're going to see a lot of negative opinions when you're reaching a broad audience. That unfortunately is the cost of releasing a product to the public. Not everyone cares about the process. But hey, I'm not the one flailing my arms like the robot from Lost In Space and being upset that people think the game isn't good."
dayz,3dy2v2,deathbytwofootfall,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:33 2015 UTC,"Ark and rust are being developed on an already built engine. Dayz is being developed alongside the engine it will be running on. DayZ is huge, TES Skyrim is huge, and I bet Skyrim was nowhere near as playable as DayZ is halfway through alpha. Your problem is comparing the development speed of DayZ to other games, you aren't criticizing anything with your posts, you're only displaying your ignorance to everyone who actually understands what goes on in game development."
dayz,3dy2v2,SystemOfAFoX,-4,Mon Jul 20 23:25:24 2015 UTC,you're only displaying your ignorance to everyone who actually understands what goes on in game development.   I like this. You don't even understand what the enfusion engine is and you say this. God you people are idiots.
dayz,3dy2v2,deathbytwofootfall,2,Mon Jul 20 23:46:40 2015 UTC,"You're full of strawman arguments. How cute.   But hey, I'm not the one flailing my arms like the robot from Lost In Space and being upset that people think the game isn't good.   You aren't? It seems like you're annoyed that people don't share you opinion that the game is shit. You're desperately trying to force your point across while highlighting the fact that you know nothing about what you're trying to talk about, and therefore your opinion is worthless. I'm not upset that people think the game isn't good, though you can keep telling yourself this if it makes you feel like your opinion matters. What irritates me are morons like you who think their invalid criticisms--aka pointless bitching--should be heard and not refuted simply because they don't like the game. You've only proven that you're the exact type of person who doesn't need to be listened to because you have nothing relevant to say.  Good day, troll."

dayz,3dy2v2,deathbytwofootfall,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:01:47 2015 UTC,"You really need to understand that the game will stay in Alpha stage for at least 1 years, maybe 2. And it will be normal for a game like that, written from the scratch.   It's been more than a year and this game wasn't written from scratch. Many of the assets were from arma. What are you talking about?"
dayz,3dy2v2,deathbytwofootfall,3,Mon Jul 20 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"This game is written from the scratch. They take the old engine and recode each element of the engine from the scratch. Devs explained it many time, in many subject and many interview. Arma assets are just placeholder to allow player to play to the game...   It's been more than a year and this game wasn't written from scratch.   Okay, my mistake, i'll rephrase it. The game will be in ALpha stage for at least 1 additional years, More likely 2. This will lead to a 3,5 year of Alpha Stage, which is pretty damn small for a game like that.  Just look at other game. KSP, Space Engineer. Look at AAA games like GTA5 that take 4 years to develop with an existing engine. Look at games like Star citizen which is in ALPHA for already one years and we can't do multi crew flight. Look at game like From the depth,  Unturned.  Seriously. I'm not again critism when it's well argumented and respectfull. But what happen on this subreddit isn't argumented or respectfull AT ALL. There's only insult, threat, etc to devs. That's because of stuff like that Rockets leave the subreddit. That becuase of stuff like that now only Hicks answers to some comment and not to all. No more eugen harton, no more other Dayz Devs.  Is that what you want? No more interaction with the devs?"

Perhaps it was ill-advised, though - if it did actually do what it said it did, (by changing some graphics parameters within the game engine), it probably wouldn't be trusted by battleeye to give a level playing field. To take it to an absurd level, removing all the trees, say, would give one hell of a performance boost...   I wonder what it did! But that's beside the point.

At this point in development they're primarily focused on re-vamping legacy modules and adding features. In beta, they'll begin the serious bug-fixing and optimization.  On a larger note, DayZ (Arma in general, actually) is very processor heavy. You find the most gains with a better processor. Out of curiosity, what are you system specs?  I can run just about everything on ultra at 60fps (with exceptions.. Witcher 3, you bitch), but in cities DayZ brings me to a whopping 20-30 fps."

IMO you're an idiot if you live stream a tactical multiplayer game and expect to not get killed because of it.  Besides that, how on earth do can admins properly decipher whether or not someone is stream sniping?  Why is there so much focus put on protecting streamers?  They should just learn to deal with the consequences of broadcasting their position on the internet."
dayz,3dxjok,BC_Hawke,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"DayZero admins require 100% proof of stream snipers, and they don't ban anyone lightly.   IMO you're a bigger idiot watching someones stream and purposely trying to kill them but whatever."
dayz,3dxjok,BC_Hawke,5,Mon Jul 20 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"I never said that people that stream snipe weren't idiots, that's not the point.  How do you get 100% proof that someone is stream sniping?  It seems very difficult to enforce.  But again, why is there even time or effort being put into banning stream snipers?  Why are streamers being catered to?  Streamers are willingly broadcasting their position, movement, coms, loadouts, and numbers on the internet.  That's their own choice.  If some idiot decides to use that information to kill them the streamer has nobody to blame but himself.  Stream sniping is most definitely cheap, low down, and dirty, but it's not hacking.  I think stream sniping is lame just as much as you do, but streamers should expect that to happen, not rely on server admins to ban people that watch their stream to get an advantage."
dayz,3dxjok,Blitzkrieg999,4,Mon Jul 20 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Easy. Admins tend to sit in DayZero streamers' chats and watch viewer names. They also watch in-game with an admin tool. If they recognize a player on someones viewer list as also being in-game, they can very easily watch the offending player and how he plays. If he runs straight towards the streamer, when he should have absolutely no knowledge that the streamer is there, there's your proof.  I believe they also have the ability to watch player movements retroactively. Players can come in the DayZero IRC channel and ask for admins to review a death, at which point the admins can view how the questionable player is acting in-game. If they deem something questionable, they can ban the player and let the offender submit an appeal.  And no, streamers should NOT expect it to happen. It's not out of the question for gamers to expect better of a community than to pull that sort of shit. It's cheap, it's sad, and it should not be tolerated by streamers or server admins alike. Additionally, it is specifically against the DayZero server rules, and as a whitelisted server, the admins can and will enforce it. You can disagree with that rule as much as you want, but you agree to the rules when you join the server. Violating the rules gets you banned, simple as that."

Haha that sounds like an insane amount of time and dedication on the admin's part, and it doesn't sound easy at all.  I can't imagine sitting by the batphone with streamers reporting every other time they get killed and then taking the time to go review player movements vs the streamer's footage.  But hey, if the admins want to do that and players are willing to trust admins that use admin tools like that then bravo.   And no, streamers should NOT expect it to happen. It's not out of the question for gamers to expect better of a community than to pull that sort of shit. It's cheap, it's sad, and it should not be tolerated by streamers or server admins alike.   Really?  You really think that they shouldn't expect that sort of thing to happen?  I'm not advocating it, and I completely agree with you that it's cheap and sad, but remember, streamers are willingly broadcasting their movements on the internet.  It's mind blowing to me that people do this and get upset or frustrated when people exploit it.  It's like my earlier example, if you go place $10,000 out on the sidewalk in front of your house someone is going to take it.  It's just a given, and you either a) shouldn't do it or b) shouldn't be surprised or upset when someone takes it.   Additionally, it is specifically against the DayZero server rules, and as a whitelisted server, the admins can and will enforce it. You can disagree with that rule as much as you want, but you agree to the rules when you join the server. Violating the rules gets you banned, simple as that.   That's fine, they can do what they want.  I don't plan on stream sniping so I don't sweat it.  I still find it absurd that people broadcast their gameplay on the internet and expect not to have it used against them, or that admins would go through the effort to cater to them for doing something so foolish.  I also find it humorous when streamers play on a server like DayZero's then go to other servers and get upset that the admins won't wait on them hand and foot to ensure that stream snipers don't kill them."

dayz,3dxjok,BC_Hawke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:45:28 2015 UTC,"It's low down, scummy, and dirty (I don't think anyone here disagrees with that), and clearly on your server it's against the rules (I don't stream snipe so I have nothing to worry about if I play there).  But really, how is it any different than someone playing on a server with side chat and typing ""I'm in Stary with 3 of my friends, we have AKs, an L85, and an M16 and we're headed to NWAF, and we'll be there in about 5 minutes"" and another squad on that server using that information to track them and set up an ambush?  IMO, it isn't.  If you give away your position on side chat people are going to use it and kill you.  Would you ban them for doing that?  They're not cheating, right?  So what's the difference?  I honestly can't see the difference considering all it takes to watch a stream is a 2nd monitor or another web device.  At this point you're banning metagaming to protect people that are promoting your server.  That's your choice, and your player base seems fine with it, so cool, props to you, keep doing what you're doing.  Maybe I'm just old and I'm not part of the ""I'm going to put my life on the internet and not worry about the consequences"" generation, but it seems absurd to me that people want to broadcast their tactical multiplayer game play in realtime on the internet and expect admins to ban people that use that information.  Whenever the topic comes up all I can think of is this type of drama.  Obviously I'm alone on this, so at this point I'll just move along.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
dayz,3dxjok,TheRegretfulBandit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:34:37 2015 UTC,"You seem to have a real hard on about this.  I take it you really dislike streamers.  There's not some epidemic of people getting banned because of streamers dude.  Like Break said, they require solid evidence before banning someone."
dayz,3dxjok,BC_Hawke,3,Tue Jul 21 12:46:26 2015 UTC,"Well, It can really help popularise a mod so admins want a good show. I don't mean obliterate anyone who comes near or shoots at a streamer, but make it a fair fight at least. Some people on DayZero were like homing missiles. Tracking people perfectly from the coast up north, so yeah, I imagine those people just got insta banned. Other stream snipers hide it better, and its more complicated...like I said the DayZero admins don't take it lightly.   It took us about 6 months to get a squad banned for stream sniping. They would watch my VOD of the previous night, see where I logged out and hang around there until I started streaming so when we logged in....we were insta dead. (Believe it or not this happening 3 times in a month was not enough evidence of stream snipe). There has to be 100% proof. IMO thats fair, and how it should be. Streamers (especially the big ones) advertise mods and its in the admins/mod creators interest to keep the playing field level."
dayz,3dxjok,bitgus,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:25 2015 UTC,"I think that the fact that streaming increases the popularity of the mod is great (I'm all for that), but to me there's a big disconnect between broadcasting your gameplay on the internet and expecting people not to use that.  It's like me putting $10,000 out on the sidewalk in front of my house and leaving for a week, and then coming home to it being stolen and getting angry that the police didn't do a thing about it.  IMO it's completely on you, the streamer, to either a) take measures to keep people from exploiting your stream or b) just deal with the consequences of it.  To reference your example, you should end your stream before logging out, move to a different position, and log out there so you don't have to deal with some jerk trying to kill you when you log in.  Stream sniping is lame, incredibly lame, I'd never do it and I think that people that do it are pathetic...but it's not hacking.  You are voluntarily putting information out on the internet that compromises your squad.  IMO when admins cater to streamers it's on par with showing favoritism to squads or donors and that's why I don't like the idea of admins banning stream snipers (besides the fact that it's incredibly difficult to 100% prove someone was stream sniping)."

DayZero adds interiors, FPS, and great gunplay, but removes player interaction and survival elements."
dayz,3dxjok,Branch3s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:36:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. Far more than pink dresses, over-the-top gun sway, gardening, building sky bases, vehicles filled with dozens of M110s and AS50s, dozens of barracks buildings in the most random places imaginable, or being able to impersonate zombies.  Of all the mods I've played, the time I spent in SA, and everything I've seen since giving up on SA by watching streamers like /u/break-, none of them have given me the same feeling of terror and excitement that DayZero brings. Good loot can be hard to find, and when you're in a firefight or trying to sneak up on a player, you genuinely feel concern over your player, because dying means starting over with nothing, and there a quick trip to Cherno or Elektro isn't going to gear you up in the same way it did/does in the various other versions of the game.   Friendly encounters do exist, in my experience at about the same rate they have always existed. They're rare, but they happen. Some days more than others. It helps that a lot of the DayZero community knows each other. As it should be, revealing yourself to another player means putting yourself at risk. They could be friendly, and be happy to run up north with you. They could be completely uninterested either way, ignore you, and go on about their business. Or they might shoot you. That's how its always been, since the mod originally launched.   Survival elements do exist, but in a much less annoying way. Its subjective, but I would much rather have to hunt for a drink or food and have a hard time finding it, than to deal with the ridiculous hunger/thirst system in SA. Like weapons, food and drink aren't so common that they become completely irrelevant. Especially in the context of surviving with other players around, sometimes finding either one can be a real challenge. It can bring up serious questions of risk/reward when approaching a town in need of food or drink. Or when killing an animal and cooking the meat.   There's also no self-bloodbagging, which means if you're alone, food becomes even more important. And with zombies being no joke in DayZero, even if you're confident there's no one around to see you enter a town, when you're low on blood you're putting yourself at serious risk to go in searching for food, because zombies can and will fuck you up."
dayz,3dxjok,BC_Hawke,5,Tue Jul 21 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Every day of the week there are more than 20 people on. Its just people wait till the 8pm restart to play because that's when all the big squads log in. I'd love it if it had 10 servers that were 65/65 all day long, but I think DayZero has to become more readily available to players (easier to install)."

dayz,3dxjok,MarcDevo,3,Mon Jul 20 14:55:15 2015 UTC,Brilliant! Glad to see you are back! :)
dayz,3dxjok,gruso,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:53 2015 UTC,I miss BMRF.
dayz,3dxjok,Elexium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:35 2015 UTC,Me too..
dayz,3dxjok,CiforDayZServer,5,Tue Jul 21 02:06:54 2015 UTC,one of the best dayz mods out there. if not the best. pure skill based mod with a high amount of really skilled squads !  love it. gj break !
dayz,3dxjok,iConnorN,4,Mon Jul 20 11:27:23 2015 UTC,Nice and intense fight! this is why we love DayZero :D
dayz,3dxjok,BrtTrp,4,Mon Jul 20 12:59:52 2015 UTC,Haven't seen a Break vid in a while! DayZero was always my favourite mod. Might have to reinstall.
dayz,3dxjok,tomx312,4,Mon Jul 20 13:14:51 2015 UTC,You should do! We need the people! :D
dayz,3dxjok,linkinx,4,Mon Jul 20 14:01:21 2015 UTC,Meanwhile in Epoch someones building a ridiculous skybase....
dayz,3dxjok,Solipsismal,0,Mon Jul 20 13:43:57 2015 UTC,Not sure what's wrong with that. Building is one of the reasons why it got so popular in the first place - it captures the player's interest.
dayz,3dxjok,Solipsismal,5,Mon Jul 20 14:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, building is fine. but building bases that float in the sky, with ramps to jump cars out of and such are silly. A little camp in the forest is cool, but some of the stuff I've seen on YT is jokes."
dayz,3dxjok,mrcrabcore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:17 2015 UTC,Can't judge a mod based on how the lowest common denominator plays on it...  I've had better squad v squad battles on Epoch or Overpoch than any other mod.
dayz,3dxjok,KRX-,5,Mon Jul 20 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"I can't play 3rd person mod servers anymore, so I guess I'm drawn to DayZero even more than other mods. Just cant take 3rd person squad battles seriously now."
dayz,3dxjok,mrcrabcore,5,Mon Jul 20 16:29:07 2015 UTC,It's even better when you have third person AND a gigantic skybase to abuse it in! Those freshspawns will never see it coming.
dayz,3dxjok,dara1489,3,Mon Jul 20 16:35:33 2015 UTC,Exactly.
dayz,3dxjok,FRAkira123,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:48:12 2015 UTC,Let people do on ARMA whatever they want to do on ARMA.
dayz,3dxjok,Xedeth,3,Tue Jul 21 01:09:02 2015 UTC,Intense!
dayz,3dxjok,-Token,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:32:49 2015 UTC,Arma 2 only?
dayz,3dxjok,Branch3s,3,Mon Jul 20 14:51:14 2015 UTC,Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead. Same as all other DayZ mods.
dayz,3dxjok,Kosti2332,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that not all DayZ mods are only on Arma 2. Pretty sure they've got DayZ Mod, Epoch, Breaking Point, etc on Arma 3 as well."
dayz,3e226z,TheGentGaming,0,Tue Jul 21 10:31:07 2015 UTC,"I would say ""camping simulator""."
dayz,3e226z,morjoviy,0,Tue Jul 21 10:52:16 2015 UTC,and they had cars.. :D
dayz,3e226z,bulljoker,0,Tue Jul 21 12:21:53 2015 UTC,cool.
dayz,3e226z,OfficialCadarts,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:08 2015 UTC,Yep.
dayz,3e1k05,hurricane_STATS,0,Tue Jul 21 06:28:09 2015 UTC,"No, it belongs in the bug tracker!"
dayz,3e1k05,NachoDawg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:01:27 2015 UTC,Chop it down.
dayz,3e1z6a,Lechateau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:48:42 2015 UTC,There is / was a trader event like every week. They made a private sub because cheaters also lurk this subreddit and people will get fked over by cheaters during these events. So watch out when you create such events.
dayz,3e1z6a,XtremeB3,0,Tue Jul 21 09:55:36 2015 UTC,Actually I am thinking about making a private sub with frequent posters to see if the downvote prob goes away.  Problem is I have no fucking idea about what I am doing lol.  This way people could also vote on which content providers the would like to be added and self promotion could be contained in just one thread.  I miss the grishino group from dayz and the countless hours of fun it provided.  The hide and seek was a lot of fun.
dayz,3e1z6a,XtremeB3,0,Tue Jul 21 10:07:36 2015 UTC,To make a decent event. Get a good community started with a few servers so you can even switch to another server when one gets fked over.   Teamspeak  Atleast 2 servers  Decent admins  Monitor all the time during such events
dayz,3e1z6a,Sliver-Spy,0,Tue Jul 21 10:25:14 2015 UTC,"The idea is not for people to be huddled on ts and just a server.  It is for people that don't know eachother to meet in game, talk in game and interact with other people that have no freaking idea of what is happening :D  Like what the old freedom Republic of grishino used to be"
dayz,3e1z6a,sawyerdk9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:39:05 2015 UTC,Grishino was a lot of fun
dayz,3e1z6a,sawyerdk9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:46:13 2015 UTC,"There used to be a guy that would organize events every week. Haven't seen him post in maybe a year or so, but that became pretty popular. He just would make up some little scenarios such as hostage rescue, VIP assassination, capture a building, etc.   The big issue was that they became so popular that the server would be filled after ~5 minutes once the IP was given."
dayz,3e1gpg,ItsMaestro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:49:26 2015 UTC,wow really.. he punched me once and ruined the helmet + knocked me out.. It was a pristine helmet out of all things lol thats a bit ridiculous
dayz,3e1gpg,Edoian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:36:59 2015 UTC,My mate had a similar experience with a crash helmet.  It may be bugged currently
dayz,3e1gpg,dobertron,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:52:57 2015 UTC,"It's normal for things to not work as you would expect them to during an alpha test. That said, I'm surprised at you being knocked out in one punch while wearing a pristine motorcycle helmet - surprised to the point of almost not believing you. That is not normal. You got very unlucky.  EDIT: Just thought: He could have been wearing brass knuckles which would significantly increase the damage he dealt, still an impressive punch though."
dayz,3e1gpg,ASnowStormInHell,0,Tue Jul 21 12:14:41 2015 UTC,Could have been a hacker as well.  God-punches aren't uncommon now.
dayz,3e1gpg,dobertron,0,Tue Jul 21 08:18:05 2015 UTC,"I'm part of the admin team on a very high ranked private hive and we haven't seen evidence (or had any reports) of hackers so far this patch, so I didn't even consider that. I guess public is more popular with hackers? And wouldn't a ""god-punch"" kill him?"
dayz,3e1gpg,ASnowStormInHell,0,Tue Jul 21 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"Not always.  Public hives are fucking rife with them, my squad keeps getting wiped by em. It's rare that we all die to a legit, skilled player/players.  They tend to stay the fuck off private hives for a number of reasons.  That being said, a Bambi ran near me, stood about forty feet away and punched once. My friend saw me crumple to the floor. He looked at my friend, said he should have been friendly and punched at him once. He went unconscious, he proceeded to talk massive shit about how his hacks were the best, apparently gave him his name+where to buy them and then unloaded my friends AUG into his head.  I've seen pretty much every hack so far. Buddy of mine got GB'd again for using ESP/No-walls/Player inventory/Dupe/etc. Said he's done with DayZ."
dayz,3e1gpg,dobertron,0,Tue Jul 21 08:58:42 2015 UTC,"They tend to stay the fuck off private hives for a number of reasons.   Just curious, what are the reasons you avoid private hives?"
dayz,3e1gpg,ASnowStormInHell,0,Tue Jul 21 09:23:30 2015 UTC,Constantly active admins and a smaller community. It's a lot easier to pin-point who's doing what.
dayz,3e1gpg,dobertron,0,Tue Jul 21 10:52:34 2015 UTC,Constantly active admins and a smaller community.   Wait - you AVOID private hives because of active admins?
dayz,3e1gpg,ASnowStormInHell,0,Tue Jul 21 10:53:39 2015 UTC,"I said nothing to hint towards that.  I just prefer to hang on public servers, with all my clan members. Even if the risk is there. When the game becomes a bit more polished I'll most likely apply to a private, white listed hive."
dayz,3e1gpg,dobertron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:03:12 2015 UTC,"Well I asked why you avoid privates and that was your answer, I guess you read my question as ""why do you play public?"". I was confused by your answer, because active admins and smaller communities are why I play on private hives.  I'm not judging your choice of which servers to play on btw!"
dayz,3e2xah,FatalityGaming1,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:23 2015 UTC,They're hopped pretty badly.   M4 is supposedly spawning but I personally have not seen one in .57.   SVD is a low percentage at russian crashes.
dayz,3e2xah,ferrariletigre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:41 2015 UTC,Found an AUG and two 60 round clips at the Lopatino chopper crash yesterday
dayz,3e2xah,Blownupicus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:49 2015 UTC,Got killed by an m4 and later stole one off a guy. They are definently in the game but very rare
