typemoon,3cq9gt,WeaselDaddy,6,Thu Jul 9 22:22:11 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say ""Make the Crimson Moon VS. Zelretch fight and show it to Nasu via Twitter or something, so we can get a reaction on Bamboo Broom"", but then I read this: ""These are possible largely because of the lack of reliance on special effects.""  Good luck with your project, tough. :D"
typemoon,3cq9gt,RikuNoctis,2,Fri Jul 10 01:55:55 2015 UTC,"Keeping it to the Nasuverse here. Also, spoilers ahoy!  Fate/Stay-Night UBW: Saber making the new contract with Rin  Fate/Stay-Night HF: Rider and Shirou's heart to heart, where she threatens to kill him if he ever hurts Sakura  Fate/Zero: Kiritsugu vs Archibald finale, a bit of a fight, but it happens mostly with mundane weapons and has lots of talking besides the Saber & Lancer conversation  Tsukihime ... been too long to remember  Kara no Kyoukai: One of the conversations they have at Aozaki's place. It would be interesting seeing real people act out the Shiki/Mikaya/Aozaki chemistry."
typemoon,3cq9gt,werewolf_nr,2,Fri Jul 10 08:48:26 2015 UTC,"If you want lots of recognition and shares and stuff, do Fate with Saber, she's by far the most iconic character in the nasuverse and people will kill to watch anything extra with her. If your budget is low try some casual carnival phantasm stretch scene.  For iconic scenes... I guess Fate route true ending is simple and very emotional. Also I'd stay away from UBW stuff simply because the anime is still echoing in everyones minds. The exception I'd think is if you want to animate UBW Good Ending ""Sunny Days"". That would actually be freaking awesome.  Anything from Fate/HF is OK. Sparks Liner High is great, also look at Superhero bad ending from Heaven's Feel. Maybe you could mess with a few 'what if' scenarios if you're feeling creative, who knows.  I'd say get one of the Kagetsu Tohya side storys, like the one in Brunestud castle. Maybe Roa's past or Nanayas family past.  Would be awesome(and hard) if you animated something we couldn't see yet, like Notes's characters interacting. Maybe even Ado Eden awesomeness but it falls on the special effects budget.  Anything about the Dead Apostles, Zelretch, ORT(any of the types, really), Crimson Moon, Aoko, Arcueid or Gilgamesh if you want to make this sub go crazy. They don't even need to be fighting."

typemoon,3chngz,s4itox,2,Wed Jul 8 14:13:42 2015 UTC,From what I've heard PS2 Archetype was banned from tournament play due to her Eclipse mode being able to be chosen in char select without any third party applications...
typemoon,3chngz,Joby05,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:16:47 2015 UTC,"Well, considering that in PS2 I'm fairly certain she only had eclipse mode available by default (and crescent available by random select glitching), and that both of which were pretty derpy, I'm not surprised she was banned from tournament play."

typemoon,3caqwb,quuser,2,Mon Jul 6 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"HOW DARE YOU?!  In all seriousness, I haven't seen the Tsukihime anime, but I have seen the Deen version of F/SN.  I watched the Deen version only around a couple years ago, and this was after watching F/Z and playing through F/SN.  Honestly, I don't get the hate for the F/SN anime.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  It has its fair share of flaws in my opinion.  Shirou as a character did get sort gimped (though honestly a big portion of that was his character in the Fate route), and some of the stuff they changed was a bit weird in how they implemented them.  The animation is also pretty bad (I think even for its time), and some of the effects they used just seem comically outdated at this point (such as the wipes between scenes).  I think its worst flaw is it just hasn't aged well at all.  So, all in all, it's an okay series to me, even as an adaptation.  It's not horrible, but it's not great.  I can see why people would have a great amount of nostalgia behind it if it was something you saw when it first came out.  I didn't enjoy it that much, but I just don't get why some people act like it's the worst thing in all of history.  In the end, though, you like what you like, and I don't think you should necessarily feel the need to defend yourself.  Just enjoy what you want. :)"
typemoon,3caqwb,LinktheMaster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:39:26 2015 UTC,the Deen FSN made me think Fate was horrible until my friend convinced me to try again with the VN like 2 years later.
typemoon,3caqwb,GaiusEmidius,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:26:18 2015 UTC,"Deen's F/SN was what introduced me to Fate and Tsukihime. I remember hearing that the Tsukihime anime was bad almost right after it was released, but the Deen Fate hate didn't really start until the Deen version of UBW was compared to the roughly contemporary Fate/Zero anime.  Having a late 90's early 00's style anime come out in 2010 right before a modern, CG enchanced anime of the same universe was a bad move. That Deen UBW was a mediocre adaptation and insufficiently rewritten to handle its new format didn't help.  TL;DR, Tsukihime is still bad, but Deen F/SN and UBW are only bad in comparison to ufotable F/Z and UBW."

typemoon,3be3c6,SoldierofNod,8,Sun Jun 28 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"That argument is not very well thought out. It is only looking at the industry through 1 view, CR subscribers, and assumes CR subscribers won't buy BDs. The proper way to see if CR is good for the industry is to look at things from the seller's perspective.  Animations studios only reaches foreign markets by selling the rights to distributors like Funimation, or Aniplex. These distributors used to only sell to TV channels like Toonami, or BD's. Nowadays, they can sell to Netflix, Hulu, and Crunchyroll if they want to as well.   CR has to pay for the shows they host. They cover the cost with ads and subscriber fees. If they don't make enough money, they can't buy new shows. If they don't pay enough for for shows, the distributors won't sell, and will look towards BD and TV sales. These companies are doing their calculations to see if CR is offering them enough.  So the real question here is does selling to CR decrease BD sales? Probably not by much, if at all. Most likely, if a show wasn't on CR, a viewer would wait to watch it on TV, or pirate. If the viewer liked the show enough, they would buy the BD. Now add in CR, and the ppl waiting for TV are still going to wait, but some of the pirates will view on CR instead. They same % of people should be buying BD's, but now there is some profits coming from those who would have pirated. CR even brings in some new viewer who wouldn't watch it on TV or pirate.  TL;DR Crunchyroll mostly monetizes from people who would pirate or never see the anime in the first place. They pay for the shows they host, and so money goes back through a distributor to the studio. The result is more income."
typemoon,3bgr9j,hillerj,7,Mon Jun 29 02:12:06 2015 UTC,"Dead Apostles are servants of True Ancestors, and have a portion of their power (see Roa and Arcueid).  The deal with Dead Apostles though, is they're constantly infighting.  The 27 Dead Apostles are the 27 most powerful vampires classified by the church, and also ranked by their danger to humanity as a whole.   If they sense weakness, one of the Dead Apostles own followers may very well rise up, kill them, and take their place (kinda/sorta like what happend with TYPE Mercury. )  Something else to remember,  is some of the Dead Apostles are the equivalent of Heroic Spirits, but because of their vampirism they've lived way past when someone,  even a Hero, would normally die.  Meaning you have these powerful sorcerers that have been perfecting their craft for hundreds upon hundreds of years."
typemoon,3bgr9j,LaezEBoy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:24:17 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes sense. Since you're getting a sort of 'natural selection' process where the strongest vampires rise to the top and get stronger over time. Additionally, with magic being weaker than it was in the past, that makes those stronger vampires appear more powerful overall than they normally would be."
typemoon,3bgr9j,Manlir,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:59:44 2015 UTC,Vampires aren't as a whole op. Its the Dead Apostles and True ancestors who are. The generic vamp is stronger than a human but nothing too dangerous for any of the chars who can fight. Its like saying people armed with swords are op as fuck and you only know about Arthuria and EMIYA.
typemoon,3bgr9j,BlindDragoon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"Going off of what LaezEBoy said, you could also consider regular vampires to be pretty powerful, but its less so that and more so that barring special circumstances and specific characters (like Aoko Aozaki with her True Magic or Shiki getting off a surprise attack on Arcueid), Humans are kind of extremely weak as a whole. Hell, theyre kind of on the bottom of the sentient food chain in the Nasu-verse.  In the Nasu-verse, pretty much the only thing keeping the Human race from going extinct is that the vampires would lose their food if they went all out and special organizations designed to take on those kinds of threats (like the Burial Agency)"
typemoon,3bgr9j,BlindDragoon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:18:27 2015 UTC,"And even those organizations don't have that many people that can take on a truly strong vampire. The Burial Agency has, what, six people in total? And maybe three of them could defeat a strong vampire."
typemoon,3bgr9j,BlindDragoon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:57:43 2015 UTC,7 and one Reserve if i remember correctly. and in that group the only reasons theyre able to kill vampire is because their accidentally immortal or just not human xD
typemoon,3bgr9j,BlindDragoon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:11:12 2015 UTC,"And besides them, there's only ~30 official Enforcers for the Mage Association, which is pretty much the only other group capable of fighting vampires. So you've got ~40 people, most of whom are much weaker than quite a few vampires, responsible for preventing them from doing awful things on a scale that would inform the public of magic. Not very encouraging."

typemoon,3aqqrw,AirBornZG,13,Tue Jun 23 05:34:06 2015 UTC,"The Tohsaka family was taught a lot of magic by Zeltrech, a German. Archer lived with people who knew English and Japanese.

So if you do all you magic in another language that you never really use for any other purpose, it could help."

typemoon,3ajn9z,hillerj,9,Sat Jun 20 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"2nd: Operation of Parallel Worlds; basically, Zelretch has control over said parallel worlds and some very old details has him as a kind of ""warper"" because he can just grab something from this parallel world and bring it to this other parallel world. Time Travel and other applications (like his Mystic Codes) are just extras from said True Magic.  3rd: It's basically the creation of a perfect existance that can not die, never runs out of energy and it's basically highly superior to anything else. It also has the nice effect of perfectly avoiding the fact that everything returns to the Akasha eventually, which a normal being (or soul, because the 3rd affects the soul) can not avoid.  5th: Control over the order of things in existance; Aoko can move the order of things, like her time or Soujuurou's, the ""position"" of Touko's attacks and so on. Time Travel isn't the effect of the 5th but a by-product of it; also, she didn't travel in time, she just moved time itself.  Do note that what we saw from the 5th in Mahoyo is still just a by-product of what the 5th truly does, as Aoko nor Touko know what was their grandfather researching which gave her the power to control order itself as a side-effect, which prompts Touko to bitch and yell about it."
typemoon,3ajn9z,RikuNoctis,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:52:04 2015 UTC,"So in a way we really only know the effects of the Magic, not what it really does?"
typemoon,3ajn9z,RikuNoctis,5,Sun Jun 21 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"Well, if we go detail by detail about what True Magic really is and want to know exactly what obtaining one entails and what exactly does, yeah, we pretty much don't know. <<<--- which sounds contradictory, I know...  First of all, True Magic, as in the five currently known, are abilities which produce an effect that can't be replicated by any other method. For example, we do more or less know what the 2nd does, but we don't know what Zelretch did to get it; we know that he researched something non-stop (which is plausible to assume) until he got to the origin of said research, which he hoped would enable him to reach the Akasha (Mahoyo confirms it with the descriptions of the True Magics).  Sadly, we don't know what that is for any of the True Magics. I mean, we could say that they just wanted an skill that would let them affect the world on a great scale (time, order, true immortality, etc.), but jumping to conclusions about what were they researching (besides Kinoko's pseudo-philosophic stuff...) would be wrong.  If you want to make things easier, you can just think of True Magic as an overpower skill, maybe similar to Authorities, but more close to the Akasha than others. <--- I mean, two of them actually come from the Akasha, so..."
typemoon,3ajn9z,AdelKoenig,0,Sun Jun 21 01:21:50 2015 UTC,2nd is moving from one universe to another.  3rd is being able to manipulate a soul. This means you can keep people alive by moving the soul to a new body after the old one dies.   5th it time travel within a universe.
typemoon,3a94dt,hillerj,9,Thu Jun 18 05:16:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing, really. It's just their eye color.  Don't confuse them with Mystic Eyes just because they are green, crimson or an awesome blue. Most eye colors come from Takeuchi and Kinoko wanting to represent something from the character; foe example, Ryougi has brown/dark eyes representing her usual behaviour, and then her Mystic Eyes change to blue to reflect her ""purity"" of self, says Kinoko.  True, other Mystic Eyes do change a lot, like Arc's from crimson to a glowing yellow, but there is not an stated relationship between colors and abilities.  Another example would be Touko in Mahoyo, with her Mystic Eyes being Binding ones and not even having color while having a weird ""form"" in her iris."

typemoon,39gh5p,RikuNoctis,2,Thu Jun 11 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"The spanish patch is based on the tidbits some users from BL posted there, and that's because there's only the first chapter ""translated"" as of now.  I'm quoting myself here, so...   Mahoyo is 70% StuCo reunions and ranting, 10% Aoko getting angry with Mr. Bear Punch, 10% Alice reading/drinking/watching Mr. Bear Punch, 5% Touko bitching about Aoko and the other 5% is just you getting bored about everyone getting angry with Mr. Bear Punch, Aoko, Alice and Touko. So far, the good points Mahoyo has are Aoko, Touko, conceptual effects, Aoko, Ploys, details about True Magic and magecraft, Aoko, bear-killing punches because logic, some tidbits about the Church faction and the individuals there, Aoko, some tidbits about what a Magus does for a living and more Aoko.   You aren't missing that much from the game, TBH. Most things relevant to Kinokoverse mechanics are explained in a few scenes, while everything else is just a somewhat forced SoL with a lot of StuCo reunions and random bitching from the characters.  Most people think that it is full of action, but no, only two of the fighting scenes are awesome, while the others are just random explanatiosn of their mechanics (like Alice's Ploys, for example). Of course, the CGs are good and the music too, but don't expect something else."
typemoon,39gh5p,LoliPits,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:21:13 2015 UTC,"Oh I thought mahoyo was about ""aoko coming to terms with her power as a Mage""... Or at least that's what I heard. Do you mean it's actually not focusing on the history of the aozaki family and the second magic :O? If so, where can I get read about the aozaki mages? I don't just wanna read the wikia to know more about them cos that's not fun at all but I will if there really is no where else to go."
typemoon,39gh5p,RikuNoctis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:02:34 2015 UTC,"Well, she doesn't ""come to term with her power as a mage"" because she barely started a year ago from where the game starts. It's more like Touko comes to terms with the fact that their grandfather didn't choose her to succeed the Aozaki research.  True, Aoko does worry, just a bit, about her situation with magic things here and there, but the reason why her grandfather choose her instead of Touko was because her personality was more fit for that responsability and way of life. We see how Aoko finds the determination to accept it all (as well as Touko).  Also, it's the 5th True Magic, not the 2nd; the 2nd one is from old man Zelretch.  There isn't much to say about the Aozakis except that they own one of the last places in Japan, and the world, where it's possible to gather enough Mana to activate a True Magic. Also, we still don't know what was researching Aoko's grandfather and how/why said research enables Aoko to manipulate the order of things with her True Magic. Remember, Mahoyo is just Touko bitching about her right to succeed her lineage and Aoko bitching because she hates her sister and because, reasons..."
typemoon,39gh5p,LoliPits,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:17:21 2015 UTC,Oops got my magics mixed up... Wow ok I guess I'll go to the wikia then... I heard there are sequels in the works though. I hope we get more info there. Of course if this doesn't get translated then we can be sure we won't be getting any for the sequels either...
typemoon,39gh5p,RikuNoctis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:29:49 2015 UTC,"Mahoyo sequels, yeah. He said that there will be two of them, but at this rate, we'll see them released by 2099 with a bit of luck. He hasn't said anything about it besides ""buy mahoyo, and fate and whatever we already released"".  As for the Wikia, I don't recommend it. I'm sure you know why, but I'd recommend just asking here or in BL or checking the JP Wiki if it's an option for you. <<<--- actually, it would be more productive if you learn the language"
typemoon,39gh5p,LoliPits,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:14:36 2015 UTC,learn the language   Still trying lol. A little hard when all I can afford to do is self learning though...
typemoon,39gh5p,DeadSnark,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:31:40 2015 UTC,If someone could just translate Aoko vs. Flat Snark and Aoko vs. Touko then that would sum up all of the best action scenes in the game.
typemoon,39gh5p,AdelKoenig,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:32:14 2015 UTC,"From what I heard it sounded like a group (Commie?) did a machine TL [by a non-native speaker], and then several people have tried to edit it into a real TL, but all of them gave up because it was so bad.  There was another who started a TL, and has done the prologue and part of Ch1, but it has been stalled indefinitely.   So the only way to read it now is to learn French, Spanish, Korean, Japanese or Chinese....  Edit: second TL's progress page  Edit 2: Spanish TL is not complete"

typemoon,39h5cz,LoliPits,2,Thu Jun 11 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"The flowchart doesnt show any point or flag requirements for the second choice  Only thing I could think of is that you might have sexual content turned off. Might test that on my own.  EDIT: Nope, even turning off sexual content shouldnt be the cause."
typemoon,39h5cz,RIvkyn,2,Thu Jun 11 21:09:06 2015 UTC,I actually think that the flowchart says if I have 12 or more points I get the scene with the choice available but if I don't I get the same scene but no choice is available. I think this is similar to the tsukihime endings where on the first play through the choice for the true end is not available until you finish the normal end. So now I probably need more Len points... Which are the scenes that get me more?
typemoon,39h5cz,RIvkyn,2,Fri Jun 12 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"ooohhh...I missread your post slightly, my bad.  Search for choices that say ""inc_len p"" in the flowchart"
typemoon,399ekt,IronicTitanium,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:10:40 2015 UTC,"Before you get confused by those other posts, the two can't be in the same ""timeline"" because there are two reasons for that.  First, the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception; those aren't an object, like some glasses (the glasses are the Magangoroshi). The MEoDP are an special and somewhat ""unique"" skill possesed by certain very, very lucky individuals. Kinoko said that besides ""timelines"" and whatever, it would be technically impossible to have two people, on the same town with the same cheating skill that are those Mystic Eyes. As simple as that.  Second, the author said so. Tsukihime and Rakkyo aren't on the same ""timeline"". And not only because of the Mystic Eyes of both Shikis, but the fact that his works aren't connected directly to one another besides references, which are mechanics and some of the lore.  Also, Kinoko already said what he thinks about the spin-offs, and he even went as far as to negate a previous statement given by him just to not recognize one of the already mentioned spin-offs, Fate/strange fake. (zero, apocrypha and ataraxia were included, too)  And no, he didn't say that they take place in another ""timeline""; he pretty much said they are only spin-offs from other authors."

(zero, apocrypha and ataraxia were included, too)   I'm a little confused by this statement. Does this mean Fate/Zero isn't canon? Also, I thought Nasu wrote Fate/hollow ataraxia?"
typemoon,399ekt,RikuNoctis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty easy to understand. The spin-offs are just that: spin-offs.  They don't have anything to do with the main works unless Kinoko himself was the one who wrote them and specifically stated are relevant to said main works.  Yeah, there are references and somewhat similar mechanics because that's what the spin-offs take to develop their world-building, but Kinoko even mocked Narita by not recognizing his work and practically saying that the spin-offs are just spin-offs and nothing more. I repeat, he even negated the part about Waver as El-Melloi II always producing graduates with rank Grand in the Clock Tower.  And yeah, I know that most people/fans like or tend to think that every work from Kinoko is connected because lolParallelWorlds and the 2nd Magic, while they tend to forget that besides references and lore mechanics, not even the main works (Tsuki-bako and Fate) are connected between their routes because they are routes. And then, it comes the part you mention: ""is it canon?"". They obviously are canon to their continuity, like any other work that exists, but they have no more bearing than being a reference and an spin-off.  Yeah, ataraxia was written by Kinoko and he said it's just an extra story and a ""what if"" scenario from the beginning, so there's no problem there, even if he took he chance to reveal other details which are canon about the mechanincs and lore of the franchise. <<<--- also, ataraxia doesn't fit with any Fate route..."
typemoon,399ekt,RikuNoctis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:09:49 2015 UTC,"What about Fate/Zero? I get the other spinoffs, but if any of them would be canon, I'd think it would be Fate/Zero.   As for Ataraxia, yeah, regardless of author, there's no way it fits in with everything else."
typemoon,399ekt,nick012000,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:21:22 2015 UTC,"He said Fate/zero is a different world than the one in Fate/stay night. Fate/apocrypha is completely different.  Also, this thing about ""canon"" or ""not canon"" isn't healthy. The spin-offs are different works themselves and besides references between them, they have no bearing on the main ones. Only what Kinoko says is what truly counts, and even then, he at least states what is ""canon"" and what not.  Besides the fact that first we should define the term ""canon""..."
typemoon,399ekt,Bargadiel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:31:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. There's no Dead Apostles in Kara no Kyoukai, while we know from Lancer of Black's Noble Phantasms that there definitely is Dead Apostles in the Fate/Apocrypha timeline."

typemoon,399ekt,AdelKoenig,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:06:17 2015 UTC,In my headcanon KnK takes place on the main timeline. Theres no reason for it not to other than Nasu said so because it would be redundant for Tsukhime and KnK to be in the same timeline.
typemoon,399ekt,BP_Ray,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:37:21 2015 UTC,Wasn't it also because the chance of two people having Mystic Eyes of Death Perception within the same radius is so abysmally low that it might as well be impossible?
