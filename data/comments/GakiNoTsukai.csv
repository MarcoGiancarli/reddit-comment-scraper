Here's episode 1 if it's not blocked in your country.  Thing is it featured random members of the public and I read an article once that in Japan they moved away from that to comedians because such people give predictable reactions whereas a comedian can take a raw reaction and build on it. Also of course it's hard to replace the chemistry you get to know within the Gaki cast when you're faced with different random people each episode.   The only plus for the British show was that the narrator was comedian Adam Buxton who I do like (e.g. his radio show with Joe Cornish), but he only did the intros / outros I think."

GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,Cataractula,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, it was one of the last episodes of season one. The host was really nice, to be honest. Would make small talk and joke around between filming, and was very friendly. It was a lot of fun, and the entire time I was worried that the slapping machine was going to come in.  Thankfully, they added that in the second season, although someone on our episode did get slapped."
GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,NF_,2,Sun Jul 19 14:49:50 2015 UTC,"I watched this some time ago and while I like Jimmy Fallon and The Roots, I did not find this that funny. Japanese humor has more subtle tells and more overt exaggerations and American humor is about the comedian being the cool guy. You'll notice in Gaki, the comedians look genuinely terrified at the harmless punishment and play up the consequence and the Americans try to retain being the cool guy and shrug off the punishment. In my opinion the US should bring over British pannel shows because I believe it would be an easy adaptation for the American style of humor."
GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,typesoshee,2,Sat Jul 18 04:16:51 2015 UTC,"In Japan, the humor is the guy experiencing and going through the punishment.  In the US, somehow, the instinct is either the guy rejects the punishment (e.g. Questlove hardly being able to put the fish to his mouth) or like you said, brushing off the punishment as if it isn't a big deal.  In either case... it just doesn't work the way it does in Japan.    I think in order to make Silent Library work outside of a Gaki setting (not a Japanese setting - I think Gaki's ""Do not laugh"" stuff is uniquely Gaki, not Japanese), there needs to be a much harsher punishment on all participants when the decibel meter goes too high.  The ""not laughing"" part needs to be enforced a lot stricter (e.g. an extreme idea for show business participants would be -$1,000 from each participant whenever the decibel meter goes too high.  The ""no laughing"" thing just NEEDS to be enforced).    Also, participants need to be forced to do the punishment as well.  Rejecting/minimizing a punishment that you really don't want to do ""feels more naturally American,"" but it wrecks the game.  The punishment for not completing a punishment needs to be even more extreme than -$1,000 - IMO, the director should just temporarily stop shooting and explain to the cast that if the cast won't do each punishment, the whole thing is called off.  They MUST do the punishment, or else the skit really has no chance of reaching its potential.  You might as well not do the skit at all.  (In a typical Gaki Silent Library, you'll notice that when someone is really reluctant, the 4 or 5 other guys will physically force the one guy to do his punishment.  Like, they would have surrounded Questlove and forced his head into the fish while one other guy holds the fish and pushes it into his face.  The humor in this game comes from being a victim, not ""Oh, I'm too cool for this, let me just walk away from the table for a second"" (which is a very American thing).  It's all cultural, though.  The ""forced"" aspect of the other guys forcing it onto one guy like in Gaki would probably make it unfunny to American audiences (too non-consensual), so IMO there would need to be some other mechanism/punishment to force the one guy to do it on his own, like the director just giving them an ultimatum - do the punishment, or the shoot is called off.  )"
GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Sat Jul 18 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they don't do things by half heh. The remake of the ""Hole in the Wall"" game also suffered from that kind of middling atmosphere. The Japanese show likely had comedians as the contestants who are trained to take a certain amount of abuse and roll with it, but the Western version used celebrities who dithered about. It just doesn't have the same impact.  In Silent Library, when Housei was terrified of the millipede thing to the point of involuntarily shaking, the rest of the cast wasn't taking no for an answer, everyone was restraining him regardless of him being like ""Bloody well get off me."" I found that hilarious but I'm pretty sure if I described that to someone unfamiliar with the show, they'd consider me as much of a sadist as Hamada xD"
GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,typesoshee,2,Sat Jul 18 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"Right, and even when Hamada is the one who's really reluctant, the other guys will surround Hamada and physically force him to do it.    I think an example where it ""works"" in American culture is the Truth or Dare game.  There, once people agree to play the game, there's a LOT of social pressure to follow through with the dares even though most people don't want to do that stuff.  The humor comes from watching someone doing what they really don't want to do (e.g. kiss someone you really don't want to, or flash yourself in public, whatever people do in Truth or Dare...).  That's exactly the same humor in Japanese batsu games - watching someone do something crazy/humiliating that they don't really want to do.  There needs to be a way to apply that same social pressure that works in Truth or Dare to the Western Silent Libraries."
GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,typesoshee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:48:03 2015 UTC,Your 'truth or dare point' reminds me a lot of Impractical Jokers which I think is also a very funny show! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnp46b6D74Y
GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,SuperstarTinsanity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:09:48 2015 UTC,"While I can't say that I laughed much, it's definitely a better attempt than the one that OP linked.  The 2 participants actually have to hold their laughter, bringing to life the ""library"" part.  While the 2 commentators were really loud and seemed too excited for me, that's an artistic choice I guess (a lot of the Youtube comments seemed to like it).  What I didn't like was the music that would play whenever they showed the participants in the library.  It seems unnecessary but most of all it destroys the ""library"" feeling for the viewer.  With all that music and the 2 commentators being super loud, they might as well not shoot this in a library...    Of course there's no need to have to copy Gaki.  The ""no laughing"" thing is a Gaki theme, it's like a culture, almost, since they use it in so many of their different segments.    I think for the Impractical Jokers clip, I would have liked it if they used less noisy props.  Of course noise is going to attract glances until it gets too noisy and someone stops you.  Since you're doing it in a library, I think something subtler would work better.  Like, a guy starts cutting his fingernails, and then starts cutting his toe nails, gives himself a manicure, pedicure, puts on make up, and then in the end he starts shaving.  That would get really weird and funny looks from the others IMO.  If you want to make the shaving a final punchline, have him use an electric shaver, so that the sound will definitely attract a reaction.    Another thing they missed is to let the participants walk out of the library.  With this clip, it's obvious to everyone in the room (assuming this is a real library) that these two are doing pranks or something, so there wouldn't be anything interesting in watching the 2 participants leave the room.  Instead, what you could do is leave it ambiguous for the other people in the library.  Like after the electric shaving, after he gets shushed or just gets a lot of weird looks, then he packs up all his stuff (including cleaning up fingernails and toenails), maybe picks a couple of books, and then leaves the room.  The camera can then zoom in on everyone's weird but relieved looks as this weirdo leaves the room, the humor being that they don't know if this was a prank or just some weirdo.  They do this in the Gaki ones (although in that case the extras give them angry looks rather than weird looks), though, obviously, the Gaki ones are staged and it isn't a real library (the people in the background just being hired extras)."
GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,typesoshee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:58:43 2015 UTC,"I think another thing is that the Japanese entertainer's persona is anytime the camera is on, while the American style is a little different and we're watching them force themselves to the rules of the game."
GakiNoTsukai,3dotg8,Eekerson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"That's true.  But in the Gaki case, the personas can be molded by what Downtown demands from them for the sake of the game.  I.e., Matsumoto creates the rules for the game and the personas adjust themselves to fit within those rules.  My point being that either the conduct of the people have to fit under the rules (Gaki) or the rules have to conduct the people's behaviors (American).  The goal in the end is the same: to simulate that universal experience of being in a place you're supposed to be quiet but you fuck around with your friends by doing silly stuff.  (Of course Gaki takes that to extreme, self-aware levels.)  An American example, just to show how universal it is."

GakiNoTsukai,3dltuv,xn0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"Some of the translations are bit wrong. For example question (Also i translated the bits that were missing too)  Question60.  What kind of part/place about Hamada he like? Answer, Hurry going home.  is actually, What kind of part/place about Hamada he like? Answer, He like the fact that Hamda will die before him. (hamada says something really sweet which was unexpected)  Question 66.Which location or hotel he think is cold? Answer, Swiss is actually; When he (Matsumoto) becomes older, where would he like to live? Answer, Swiss  Question 75. If he's only giving 1 month at his old age, what would he want to learn/master? Answer, psi as psychokinesis, telepathy  is actually, If you could be anything for a day what would you be? Answer, Rhinoceros (lol wtf?)  Question 76. For this the question is correct but the reason is because matsumoto thinks that tanaka has a boring life.  Question 82. what kind of variety program would he like to take part in? shoten   Question 83. what genre of porn(Adult video) does he like?  He likes amature porn (only watches the debute video) he thinks that once the stars go professional it gets boring to wach.  Question 84. (I dont really know what it was because i couldnt read the knaji)  Question 92. how many kids does he want? 2  Question 95. who does he think is the most fashionable celebrity?  Machiaaki ( not sure who this person is)  Question 99. what did he say when he proposed to his wife? He was arranged married so he didnt actually proposed to her.  when they had a child, he though ""well i guess this is how its supposed to be.""  Question 100.when does he feels the happiest? when he is listening to rakugo before he goes to sleep."

GakiNoTsukai,3daj00,xn0,16,Tue Jul 14 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, behind the scenes, Hamada is tough on his subordinates but his anger is usually measured and ""within the bounds of Japanese propriety within a hierarchy (edit: but specifically a type of strict hierarchy, in this case coming from a master-apprentice tradition)"" (my interpretation).  Towards his seniors, he's very courteous, which is why many of them respect and allow his on-air antics towards them (e.g. Shimura Ken).  Towards people that are more ""outside"" of his hierarchy (e.g. non-comedians), he's also very courteous and friendly.  <-- These are my speculations from reading and watching random stuff on the internet.  I think it's generally true of him today but I DO NOT KNOW if this also applies to his earlier days (I'd say his late 20s), when Hamada was a lot more wild and DGAF on TV.  He's a lot more chill now in his later years.    Matsumoto actually has two very clear and documented cases of outbursts.  His most famous is the ending of Gottsu Ee Kanji (Japanese Wikipedia page), where Fuji TV suddenly replaced one of the shows with a baseball game because that baseball game was going to determine a championship or something.  Apparently Downtown didn't get much notice about this change and also the originally planned show had a special segment that was synchronized to the sale of a CD related to the show (thus, delaying that airing would mess up that synchronization), so Matsumoto got super mad and basically walked away from the program, as well as going on a temporary boycott of appearing on other Fuji TV shows.  So it could be interpreted that Matsumoto single-handedly ended Gottsu over this incident.   A year later, Hamada stated on a separate show that the decision to quit Gottsu was mutual and that it wasn't just Matsumoto acting out on his own.  Hard to say how believable this is... could be just Hamada covering for Matsumoto in public.  But it's also possible that Matsumoto consulted Hamada before making the decision, of course.  Who knows.    Another incident is with comedian Ota Hikari of Bakusho Mondai.  On some radio show, Ota made fun of Matsumoto for wearing an Adidas shirt (I think joking that Matsumoto was looking like an advertisement or something).  Matsumoto called Ota to his dressing room, went ballistic, and demanded that he 1. Quit show business, 2. Get hit with a chair, or 3. Dogeza (a bow on the ground, like a kowtow, which is used in Japan as expressing a deep apology).  Ota did number 3.  Apparently, after the incident, Bakusho Mondai had a tough time getting appearances on TV for a while, but they recovered after a while anyway.  They're not enemies per se these days (I think), but there's enough chilliness between them that they'll never appear on the same show.  A big exception was the last episode of Waratte Iitomo, where they did appear together, among a bunch of other comedians (it was like a big get-together, so they didn't need to interact)."
GakiNoTsukai,3daj00,typesoshee,2,Tue Jul 14 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"Ota Hikari (and his partner) appears at 7:33 in Waratte Iitomo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKqxJxZLmeM They interact a bit (the show was 5 years after the incident, things may have eased down a bit)."
GakiNoTsukai,3daj00,Ultra_Hitoshi,4,Tue Jul 14 22:18:37 2015 UTC,"I actually read some 2ch thread that did a lot of (over)analysis on this appearance.  So originally, the duos (Downtown, Tunnels, Bakusho Mondai, 99) were supposed to appear separately, each one (in the order I wrote them) getting some time on the stage with Akashiya Sanma and Tamori (or just Tamori, not sure).  But Sanma and Tamori (just the two of them on stage at first) went way overtime and it was a live airing, so basically Sanma was screwing things up.  Downtown decided to go ""rush"" the stage half-jokingly but half-seriously because that was the only way that everyone was going to get on stage with the remaining time.  Then, as Ishibashi of Tunnels actually explains in the clip later, Ishibashi called the other duos and told them to rush the stage as well.  So after Downtown is on stage, Tunnels rushes the stage, and then Bakusho Mondai, and then 99.  Ishibashi explains or implies that part of why he told the other duos to rush the stage is basically to get Bakusho Mondai on the stage at the same time as Downtown (""ネットが荒れる"").    So even though we do see Bakusho Mondai and Downtown on the stage at the same time, in the original plan for the show, they still weren't supposed to be featured at the same time.  It was supposed to be Sanma and Tamori (or just Tamori, not sure) with each of the duos separately.  Sanma going overtime and then Ishibashi telling the other duos to rush the stage created the situation where both Matsumoto and Bakusho appeared on stage at the same time."
GakiNoTsukai,3daj00,typesoshee,3,Tue Jul 14 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"Its crazy that Matsumoto is so strict on criticism on his outfit, or on such comments in general, as Downtown both were much harsher in the past (and also in present). It seems hypocritical. Or is it some Senpai-Kohai shit? (Ota is like two years younger than Matchan.)  Didn't he threaten to sue a yellow paper for making fun of his work ethics once? That also struck me as odd. They seem to be very thin-skinned when its about their work and status.  Thanks for the long answer, btw.   //edit: Matsumoto even called Hayao Miyazaki a ""Lolicon"" (e.g. Pedophile) once. That was REALLY disrespectful. Double Standards."
GakiNoTsukai,3daj00,typesoshee,6,Tue Jul 14 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if ""strict"" is the right word for it.  ""Hypocritical"" may be valid.  A generous word I would use would be ""complicated"" or ""complex.""  It might not be as clean-cut as it sounds, like I don't think it's as simple as ""Ota made fun of Matsumoto, so Matsumoto got pissed at him.""  I imagine it had something specific to do with the way Ota made fun of him, or perhaps it was because Ota didn't mention to Matsumoto beforehand or didn't contact Matusmoto afterwards about his radio appearance, like courtesies like that.  At least this would make sense in light of his decision to quit Gottsu.  Unplanned special sports programs taking precedence over regularly scheduled programming is a regular occurrence in Japan (as well as anywhere in the world, I imagine), so it may have had to do more with the way that Fuji TV dealt with them rather than the simple fact that the scheduling was changed.  So maybe it was the way that Ota made fun of Matsumoto rather than just the fact that Ota made fun of him.    It's all speculation though.  But the fact that these two things happened is well-documented (as far as private behind-the-scenes things can be documented).   edit: Matsumoto even called Hayao Miyazaki a ""Lolicon"" (e.g. Pedophile) once. That was REALLY disrespectful. Double Standards.   People have said a lot of shit about Matsumoto's movies though and he hasn't taken any special action against them.  I don't think it's as simple as ""he attacks so I attack back"" or ""I can do it but he can't"" thing.  Again, it's probably the way in which criticism is done that Matsumoto is sensitive to."
GakiNoTsukai,3daj00,typesoshee,2,Tue Jul 14 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"Matsumotos sensitivity seems to be a huge problem for him. Wasn't the ""Gottsu incident"" also the reason for a short pause and his head shaving?"

GakiNoTsukai,3d730z,TenuredOracle,3,Tue Jul 14 12:09:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you have to work with Google Translate unfortunately. Putting in a line break after punctuation can help and you can click on each word for an alternate solution (e.g. clicking on ""uncle"" offers ""old man""). The ""difficult"" is it getting confused with dialect I think (the ん on こんな), taking the ん off changes ""difficult"" to ""this.""  So the result is: Good morning, the old man of 47-year-old, when you have asked tea, this it came out.  Which still reads awkwardly of course, but reading between the lines you can figure out where correct English grammar needs to go.  But yeah, there's no replacement for human language comprehension, so much love to the translators out there."

A simple email to us would probably be enough to get you the .ass file :) It's not illegal in anyway to download our videos and extract the subs, as we are not considering releasing them separate at this point.  If you wanted to use our subs for personal work or some other reasons, next time it would be nice to gives us a heads up next time.  Thanks."

GakiNoTsukai,3cxcwj,Hashiru,2,Sat Jul 11 19:53:59 2015 UTC,Just before the No Laughing Airport game Matsumoto got a stress fracture on his foot while training; maybe that's why he doesn't participate in those tag parts nowadays. Maybe he has weak legs or feet.

To Bulgaria: But I think you it'll stick if you use Aron Alpha (industrial strength instant adhesive).  To France: There's no way a detergent that good exists, I don't believe you.  To Pakistan: See this is why I keep telling you to stop eating only fried food.  To Ghana: Ok ok I got it.. First of all you have to give him his 500 yen back.

GakiNoTsukai,3cleq8,xn0,3,Wed Jul 8 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"This is one of quite a few (5 or 6+ clips), where Matsumoto acts like a interviewer. The people he interviews (most definetly other comedians) are always pixellated.  He tries to keep his composure and not laugh, but it seems to be very difficult. It reminds me a bit of the No-Laughing Batsus, but without the punishing element.  Can someone do a quick sub or give a short summary?   //edit: In this first clip its apparently Itao Itsuji.  :D"
GakiNoTsukai,3cleq8,blinkSCV,4,Wed Jul 8 20:40:17 2015 UTC,"I'll give a short summary:   The show is meant to be a morning talk show where Matsumoto talks to people about confidential matters in their occupation. This one is ""Genius Unlicensed Doctor"" and yeah it looks like it's Itao playing the Doctor. Basically Itao talks about all sorts of stuff he does that a Doctor shouldn't be doing, like leaving medical instruments inside patients, but he justifies it by saying that he doesn't have a license and it's instruments that they don't use often anyway so it doesn't matter. Matsumoto just tries to keep a straight face and keep the conversation going without revealing that it's ridiculous.   Then it continues with other cases, but it's probably best if someone translates it instead of me spoiling the punchlines here, but that should be enough to give you an idea of what the show is about."
GakiNoTsukai,3cleq8,babbols,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:33:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much. :D Wasn't Itao posing in one of the No Laughing-Batsus as the Manga Character ""Black Jack"" (the character is also an unlicensed doctor)? It looks as if they developed it from there."

This looks so cool and funny at the same time!   Questions: Is this a series? If so, what episode? What year did they start this? Is this like a 20-25 min. length episode or small interviews within their main show?  I wanna see Matsumoto interview Hamada so bad! Ohh, and it looks interesting with other comedians being interviewed that looks serious but with subtle humor!"
GakiNoTsukai,3cleq8,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Thu Jul 9 04:53:54 2015 UTC,"It's not from Gaki, after doing a Google of the title of the video, apparently it's a show called ""Big Morning Interview"" ( search for モーニングビッグ対談 if you wanna find more ) created by Matsumoto, it ran from May - September 2003. Japanese wikipedia link."
GakiNoTsukai,3cleq8,babbols,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:49:48 2015 UTC,Ahhh! Cool. I think this could very well be a gold mine. I just love the reactions of Matsumoto and the deadpan delivery of the (presumably) insane stories.
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,bunnehfrommax,14,Tue Jul 7 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard about him stopping to be honest, one of his tweets was highlighted in a Gaki Costume Talk episode awhile back.   Shibatabread has translated some of their tweets.  ( Tsukitei Housei also has a Twitter and I've roughly translated some of their tweets. )"
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,YamasakiGifsTumblr,11,Tue Jul 7 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"His latest one with those toys says: ""Got these from a gachagacha!""  Gachagacha are like gumball machines but in Japan they can have various things in them. The word gachagacha is meant to be the sound that those machines make when you turn the knob.  Do you guys want me to translate stuff like this in the future?  Maybe you guys already understand Japanese   EDIT: Didn't read the little pamphlet thing in the photo at first but apparently these are ""Rare Beasts"" creatured by Matsumoto. Can't see the text very clearly on my phone but they seem to all have joke names and descriptions."
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,blinkSCV,11,Tue Jul 7 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"Actually a lot of Gaki fans don't know Japanese (me included) so there's a big demand for subbed and translated content of any kind. Even if someone knows a bit of Japanese, Matsumoto is still difficult to translate as a lot of his humor comes through use of words and he can be very colloquial. So I think if you did enjoy to translate his tweets, people would welcome it. :)  (Also that toy lion he got looks like it needs to stop its diet already, put some meat on your bones geez)."
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Tue Jul 7 21:10:52 2015 UTC,I put this random one in google translate and it's making no sense at all. What does it mean?  子供の時、5円たこ焼きが近所にあってん。たこが入ってないから5円やねん。 オレがそれ買ってたんをオカンがたまたま見かけたらしい。後日。小遣い上げてやりたいんやけどな〜ゴメンな〜って。 オレはただただアレが好きやってんけどな。。。おしまい
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,seviliyorsun,5,Tue Jul 7 20:40:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah google translate is not the best, especially since this is written in the Kansai dialect which would confuse it more. Anyway here's what he said:  ""When I was a kid there was a place in my neighborhood that sold takoyaki for 5yen. It cost 5yen because there was no octopus meat in them. One day it seems my mum saw me buying them and the next day she said ""I wish I could give you more pockey money. "" I actually just liked those. . . The end."""
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,blinkSCV,2,Tue Jul 7 21:01:00 2015 UTC,Could you give an example of how a really basic Japanese phrase would be different in the Kansai dialect? Just to get a feel for the dialect with my very very small knwledge of the Japanese langage?
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,billylooser,7,Tue Jul 7 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, lets say you want to say ""That's a dog. ""   Standard Japanese: それは犬だよ.  Kansaiben: それは犬やねん.  Or something like ""I don't have money. ""  Standard: 金がありません.  Kansai: 金があらへん.  There's a lot more to it than just these sentence endings but those are some simple examples. Even the pronunciations of common words like sushi can be different,  but you probably won't notice it with comedians like Matsumoto and Hamada as much because they tend to mix standard Japanese and Kansaiben since they've lived in Tokyo for most of their lives."
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,blinkSCV,2,Tue Jul 7 22:01:28 2015 UTC,"Nitpick, but according to this, ありません ー＞ ありまへん, and 金がない ー＞ 金があらへん (or 金がない?), but I really don't know the difference between あらへん and ない.  According to this, it should be あらへん (ある の否定) while ない is used for negating, uh... verbs other than ある.    Also, it seems that depending on the region, people say あらへん or あれへん.  This seems to imply that あれへん is more common in Osaka city and あらへん to the south, east, and towards Kyoto.  Yet, it's ガキの使いやあらへんで and Downtown is from Amagasaki, which is to the northwest of Osaka, instead.  But this says Kobe (while geographically farther from Amagaski than Osaka, is in the same Hyogo prefecture as Amagasaki) uses あらへん while Osaka is more あれへん.  Seems like one can say that the Kansai dialect generally uses あらへん while Osaka city uses あれへん."
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,typesoshee,3,Wed Jul 8 04:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yes that's right there are other variations, but like I said it's a lot more complicated and I was just giving some simple examples.   I used あらへん because it's more common, ありまへん is fine but I've almost never heard or seen it used. They have the same meaning but ありまへん is more polite."
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,blinkSCV,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:14:50 2015 UTC,I agree ありまへん seems rare.  My nitpick was because 金がありません is in keigo while あらへん isn't.

GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,billylooser,20,Wed Jul 8 05:10:39 2015 UTC,You can also just scroll down on Matsumoto's Twitter page to see that he never really quit tweeting.
GakiNoTsukai,3cfq8c,typesoshee,3,Tue Jul 7 16:41:17 2015 UTC,He's never stopped tweeting. He just tweets sparsely. Maybe one every 2 weeks or so

GakiNoTsukai,3cbz5x,bolt_krank,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:24:44 2015 UTC,"Well the episode just shows short clips / highlights from the DVD, the actual DVD is probably much longer (I think it collects together some past Heipo-themed episodes). But someone would have to extract the subtitles from the DVD itself.  I'm sure even a sub of the highlights reel would be appreciated though, and I'm guessing the Gaki cast have some funny things to say in the episode about Heipo getting his own DVD.  Thank you very much for subbing! Look forward to seeing the result. If you want other Gaki episode transcripts here's a list with some more. Or they can be found on this site or this site which updates each week."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,Otviss,3,Mon Jul 6 09:45:47 2015 UTC,"A few questions from a very clueless fan:   How does the typesetting/timing process work? Does it go from a typeset then handed off to a translator, or does the translation come first and typesetting second? Will this effect if TPF will release soft-subs? Say if someone had a raw already downloaded to typeset with, would they then have to redownload the final translated episode hardsubbed as well? Do you guys also accept general episode typesets that aren't on your list of to-dos? Or would that be more suited to send to another subbing group?"
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,sonitaka,3,Mon Jul 6 13:12:45 2015 UTC,"Great questions.  1.This is how the subbing process looks like.  Typesetting > Translation > Final editing(Done by typesetter) > Proofreading.  Depending on the skill of the translator, two translators might work on one episode. Let's say there's a translator that contributes to an episode. Everything left out/Not translated or any other miscellaneous pondering that given translator can't do, it'll be sent to to another one. Most certainly to one of the fluent speakers.  To clarify the situation, I'll take the ""Itao's lipsync challenge 2"" as an example. I typesetted the episode. Hans(Translator) from Team Gaki did the translation, with a little help from a close friend(Credited). The file was then sent to Lei(Team Gaki) to finish the translation. It was actually in great shape to begin with, so only minor things were changed and added. Then it was sent back to me to do final checking, Fix typesetting errors, and make sure it's completely ready for release. Then the file is sent to a proofreader. In 90% of the cases it's James(Team Gaki) that does proofreading. This involves fixing english grammatical errors. After that, it might go through a final checking again(sometimes). Just to be sure. And then it's encoding time/Hardsubbing time. And then the video is uploaded.  *  Typesetting on a 24min episode takes about 4-5 work hours. Translation on a 24min episode takes 4-10-15 work hours.(Very much dependent on the skill of the translator).  2.To quote /u/tofupandafansubs from Kiki - Fish Sausage thread:   ""Looking back at our history we have never prefered releasing soft subs. But ill bring it back to the team and discuss it.""   I'm still not sure whether this is a consideration for us. We always provide the download link on the website to the hardsub version. I haven't heard anything from the others on the team. But as for now, hardsub video will be available for streaming and download. Not separating the soft subs(.ass) and raw video. Let's say you're siting on a 720p 4:3 video and the subtitles are in a 1080p 16:9 format. It would look messed up if you were to play them together. Now this is of course not hard to fix. But having this in mind, alongside that the download is available for everyone, and if not that, it's available for streaming. What's unfortunate is if you have limited bandwith on your internet.  3.Yes and no? If you mean we accept files from others? Or if you mean we accept requests for other episodes?  All groups have a private spreedsheet to see what we're all working on. Considering what others are doing and how much resources one has, we pick what episodes we want to do. But happily accept requests! If of course it's not being done by another group. Then can't be anything else than grateful for that."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,sonitaka,2,Mon Jul 6 13:37:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the helpful answers! I'd love to be able to learn how to typeset sometime, as I have plenty of spare time which I know is pretty valued haha.  I only ask about the soft-subs because I've downloaded most Gaki raws (in a minority here obviously), and it bums me out little bit when I have to redownload episodes as I do have limited bandwidth, but I understand the reasoning behind it."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,jb52973,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:52:38 2015 UTC,"I understand...I apologize once again.  If you feel you have what it takes to learn how to typeset anyway(Which is, by the way, very easy actually) do contact me. It's something to consider at least. When i started i didnt think i would do good enough, but it's only an imaginary mental barrier, nothing else.  Take care."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"I've worked as a typesetter at a printing company for almost 20 years, using Quark and now InDesign. Do those skills carry over to the software used to typeset the episodes?"
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Mon Jul 6 18:29:46 2015 UTC,"<chuckles> Barely..barely. It sure depends on how you look at it. From one perspective it can really up the quality of the Typesetting of an episode. I would imagine if you're familiar with the design world. One is comfortable around looking for the right fonts and giving the work an aesthetic approach to it. But typesetting is mainly timing the episode too.  And timing is basically this: Setting timestamps for dialogue relative to the audio and video using a program called aegisub.  This picture illustrates what a typical(Finished and ready for translation) workbench or what ever you want to call it looks like in aegisub.  Speaking as someone that knows how it works. At first glance it looks way more complicated than it is. There's an Audio box, Video box, Subtitle box and a Script box.  They are all related to each other. And one change, changes throughout the whole ""timestamp"". I've actually had one person that was interested in doing translation for us a while back. And she said no when she saw a guide i made, even after i explained several times it was easy. And remember, As a translator everything is done for you when you get the file. You just kind of, fill in the blanks at that point. But looking at it and knowing little could be frightening. Therefore It's important for me to emphasize how easy it actually is. And how practice makes perfect with this program. Easy to use, hard to master.  If you have some spare time you would like to use to contribute to the community. It could be something to consider. As it's fun, and very enjoyable."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"If that translator is still interested, what she could do is simply type down what each person is saying on separate lines like:  E- Hey!  T- Yeah?  Then the typesetter/timer can copy and paste all of that and do Ctrl+V to paste into Aegisub. That will create lines for each one for timing etc. (and then you can remove the name markers like E- for Endo, that's just to know which color style to use e.g. Orange).  Kind of like when people do livesubs, typing in a chat what people are saying, then people take that raw text and create a sub from it. Typesetting/timing can come after the translation which may be easier for some."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:21:04 2015 UTC,"That would take so much work! But indeed an ""Alternative"" if one isn't into the technical side of things. Which she really did not seem to be. Oh no, this was 1-2 months ago anyway. I've scared her off, unfortunately.(As she didnt reply to my worrying messages).  Since you know too, that aegisub is really an easy program to use, once you get a hang of it. Convincing a translator to use that(Mainly because the typesetting is done before the translation) is my only approach to it. If the situation is tricky in the sense that the said person wouldn't want to use the program. Perhaps what you described could be an alternative for sure. But i would imagine it would take twice the work, what do you think?"
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:29:25 2015 UTC,"If anything I think it'd take out the extra step where the finished translation has to be sent back to the typesetter to check that things aren't messed up now that there's actual words and different line lengths. Knowing the final line lengths is also handy for timing of course, giving people time to read it etc. since something in Japanese may not be as concise once translated to English.  So you may be able to do both the final typesetting and timing in one step."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:53:32 2015 UTC,"Knowing the final line lengths is also handy for timing of course   Which is why spending another 20-30 minutes to adjust everything, and to align/Position/shrink lines that have now been added, really isn't such a big of a deal. In my case, the final checking step is crucial. I can only guess when to divide a sentance in two or three. or how long an on screen text is.  Sometimes i get it back from the translator and it's completely messed up. Things are bigger, longer. Perhaps i notice some timing errors made by myself that need to be fixed. This step involves alot of things, It's basically just adjusting that, and doing some tidying up. How's that a step that can be skipped?  But then, I'm familiar with how you do subbing too :). You do it all in one go. Translation too. I'm guessing you make sure errors are fixed anyway. Edit: Oh and im so sure we have different ways of working. Typesetting that is. We all have.   something in Japanese may not be as concise once translated to English.   Exactly. Which could mean making one longer timed line. in to two separate shorter lines, for readability."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Mon Jul 6 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"If anything you'll probably find it easier than doing print typesetting, as most of the text doesn't really need to be set. You just select from a pre-defined style (e.g. selecting the ""Endo"" style for when Endo is speaking) and by default it'll be set at the bottom of the screen. There's just a few instances where there might be signs and labels etc. in a video that need to be positioned, but given how much unsubbed Gaki there is, I think people will just greatly appreciate something functional (aka readable).  As Otviss said you also do timing, which is basically just setting when someone starts / stops speaking. You can set up shortcuts in the software to do that with just a few key presses. Or if you happen to be a gamer, you can check out my tutorial on timing with a controller."

GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,OatmealDome,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah they look amazing on my widescreen monitor too. They are stretched fine and everything. It's just that the aspect ratio is still 4:3 due to the resolution, and therefore, if i were to encode it, it would stretch back.......... to it's nature? I...well.. Don't ask me how it works. Only thing i know is that i always have to specify the aspect ratio meaning 16:9 and let the program change the resolution, so when i upload it to dailymotion, it will stretch properly.   Doesn't re-encoding take away some of the quality?   That's completely up to the person doing it. I've noticed, even when i encode on ""Super speed"" Specifying to keep the same video bitrate(or keeping to a specified size). It doesn't lose any quality at all. I don't know how the program does it, but. Faster encoding times should result in errors and a loss of quality, but apparently not. I even compared the finished result to the raw and it looks totally fine, and awesome in fullscreen."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,Bobblehead_IV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"so when i upload it to dailymotion, it will stretch properly.   According to their upload FAQ, they can accept 4:3 aspect ratio. How does it look when you try it? There's a few videos labeled ""1440x1080"" on there that look OK ( random one I found )."
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:07:58 2015 UTC,"I downloaded the video and it's resolution is in 1440x816.  Aspect Ratio Calculator Tells me it's 30:17  Pretty strange for an aspect ratio isnt it?    This is what happens when i encode the raw(1440x1080) with the subtitles to make the final video.  If i say this to the program: Keep original resolution and aspect ratio. Don't change anything, it will naturally encode the video in 4:3 resulting in a 4:3 video size. Because 1400x1080's aspect ratio is 4:3.(Even though it looks stretched and nice in playback on our screens, the raw that is)  In order to prevent this i need to specify it to be 16:9 and tell the program it's allowed to tamper with the resolution in order to guarantee a perfect 16:9 fit.  I'm starting to suspect that it has to do with standard resolution of japanese TV's?..   :)"
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, yeah that is an odd aspect ratio, where did all those vertical pixels go haha. Guess that's a no-go then.  Hm well when I record programs off Japanese TV (via an android app), it comes through as 16:9, so I'm not really sure. My recordings don't look as good as ErnieYoung's though, as it's an internet stream with far less mbps than a TV broadcast.  I wonder if this would produce an OK result for an alternate 4:3 .ass file or if it would just look ugly: http://docs.aegisub.org/manual/Resolution_Resampler"
GakiNoTsukai,3caaxh,CutterGaki,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Doing that works great. If you have an .ass that was originally bound to let's say a 1440x1080 video. And you have a raw that's in another resolution, you basically just load them both up in aegisub and usually the program will ask you if you want to resize the subs as its in another resolution. And with my experience I always click no because it results in some weird things, I don't know if its the same as in the ""in program"" function. But using the ""resample subtitles/resolution"" function in aegisub and choosing from video and unchecking keep aspect ratio it will resize the subs to the file you have loaded. It works like a charm. But it also depends if the file has ""ass draw"" objects in it. If it does. Some of those might look weird and off set. Other than that, its completely reliable :)"

You can see in the network tab the flv file and it shows me the url.  I can see it's from Youku, so it seems MioMio gets their videos from other sites.  I am not an expert, but I think that's the problem.

As a typesetter one has to choose; do i want to sub it like any other episode with all of the on screen text or do i want to sub it with basic subtitles..Having also in mind, that one episode is about 1 hour.  There seems to be more episodes in this series where the other comedians are chefs too! Super awesome. Though i must admit, it's quite self explanatory. What do you think about it?"

For example: △, △, ← , □ , △ , ○ , ×, △  Which is: Play, Pause, Step back, Set start of line, Play, Set end of line, Insert new line after, Play.  I hope people will find it useful.

GakiNoTsukai,3an81m,typesoshee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:00:24 2015 UTC,"Cool links, thanks.  These are one-off impressions though, whereas the idea in its ""final form"" is where you have multiple people on the same show doing different lip-syncs, and the people doing it aren't there to specifically showcase their impressions, if that makes sense.  For example, certainly in 2008 and before, Endo probably could have performed his Mori Shinichi and Hosei definitely his many singer impressions live without lip sync in front of an audience on any show.  But that's actually a common thing on Japanese variety and comedy that's existed a while.  Also, most of the people who do it are comedians who can sing, like Hosei (you need the comedy to do the impressions, and then you have to be able to sing some).  I think what you pointed out though is one significant step in the ""development.""  The first is pure impression singing without lip syncing, like the example of Hosei, which has existed for a while on Japanese TV.  The next is the limp syncing impressions, like your links.  I think these were created because it just so happened that those entertainers couldn't sing their target songs (Beyonce and Matsuura Aya).  The final step is to have an entire show/segment dedicated to lip syncing with multiple entertainers participating (where those entertainers can't necessarily sing)."

He apparently started at age 5 but I think I he admitted in an AKB48 Body Check episode (where his sense of balance failed him) that he hasn't really kept up with it since school, though with my lack of Japanese I'm just guessing by his self-deprecating tone and the film crew laughing.  Speaking of his past hobbies, recently he wrote an article for Hamada Shogo.  As expected he lists on it that a hobby of his is Mahjong, which makes sense since for his 20th anniversary special outside Gaki, he got Matsumoto and some others to play Mahjong with him.  And his other hobby?  Jet skiing...  Didn't see that coming."

And then they show the replay and I'm like, what even happened?  Seems only making contact with specific areas count whilst having correct posture that shows real intent rather than incidental... Yikes!  From an article about difficulties including kendo in the Olympics:   Unlike Olympic fencing, which keeps score with electronic sensors that light up when the target is hit, a game-winning perfect strike in kendo, known as ippon, cannot be measured electronically. Instead, it is a judgment call made by at least two of the three referees. The ingredients of that perfection are so nebulous that referees are notorious for bad calls. Nevertheless, for many kendoka, a referee’s call is preferable to the flash of a light. For them, the technology would degrade the beauty of victory."

It's hilarious when at 10:15 they have to pass along some nasty goopy drink and though Housei starts the line off, no-one else wants to take it off him so he's just left with it.  The series is an old spin-off show Downtown hosted, one part is they learn how to do something they've never done before, and the other is to do some competition challenge.

In addition to Housei and Itao there's also the two Kojis, Koji Higashino and Imada Koji. They host a lot of shows nowadays and seem pretty friendly with Housei and Downtown still, Higashino helped Housei get into rakugo.  There's also Downtown Juice with a similar cast line-up, but that focuses mostly on dialogue unfortunately (interviews with celebs and a 'come up with a funny answer' panel show), however it's fun to see their early interactions, some GIFs etc. I made."

I still do go by the amateur translating route   Yay go go amateurs haha~ Yeah if you use multiple resources rather than just copy/paste you may be able to improve on the list. Some episodes I'm sure will be tough (e.g. see this discussion for the 'Garu Game' episode) but I'm sure someone more fluent could help.  Not as many watch raws, but maybe more will check out a raw if they see an interesting episode title in proper English. Gaki subs depends on interest so it certainly won't hurt."

EDIT: By the way, to the left of Hamada at the start is Housei's old Team Zero (1988 - 1993) comedy partner Hiromitsu Noriyasu. He was the tsukkomi (like Hamada) and Housei was the boke (like Matsumoto). But he decided to pursue a career in film-making so Housei went solo thereafter."

GakiNoTsukai,39w1c5,deadenddan,4,Mon Jun 15 06:52:39 2015 UTC,"Nice! Team Gaki was basically set up for linking people up. Back when Shibatabread and Zurui unfortunately had other commitments in life take away their time for subbing, Team Gaki was set up to collectively group together anyone with spare time to sub stuff. Over on Team Gaki's Facebook there was recently this exchange:    I think i'd like to try out doing some fansubbing, especially gaki videos. Add me on Skype? Mickstar813    I'm sure they can instruct you on typesetting too if you need help. Best of luck and thank you so much for wanting to help sub more Gaki!!"
GakiNoTsukai,39w1c5,YamasakiGifsTumblr,6,Mon Jun 15 11:44:25 2015 UTC,Hey!!! Any typesetting submitted to us would be of great help!!! I would love to do any videos which are typeset! Add me on Mickstar813 on skype if you want to talk about it? :)
GakiNoTsukai,39w1c5,mickstar813,3,Mon Jun 15 12:12:15 2015 UTC,Thank you for all the response from top Gaki contributors! I will be in touch with a few individuals shortly.
GakiNoTsukai,39w1c5,typesoshee,2,Mon Jun 15 15:28:35 2015 UTC,"Is your Gaki stash the same or better quality resolution as the ones here?  If yours are better, that'd be a pretty awesome addition for everyone."
GakiNoTsukai,39w1c5,typesoshee,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:44:55 2015 UTC,"Geez, you're gonna make me download that all now to check. :P  I honestly don't know how the quality stacks up to those. I just finished getting them all together from the multiple sources I had them stored on and I plan on making a spreadsheet of all the episodes I have and the (assumed) quality.  I've watched most of them without the subs and took notes on what I could pick up and what the generic theme was."
GakiNoTsukai,39w1c5,tenkal,2,Mon Jun 15 15:26:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could just check one or two random episodes first?  Yeah, it'd be much to try to check all of them.  I imagine most of them are going to be the same quality?"
GakiNoTsukai,39w1c5,TofuPandaFansubs,2,Mon Jun 15 15:31:44 2015 UTC,"generally, bigger the file-size, better the quality."
GakiNoTsukai,39w1c5,slappymcnutface,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:27:49 2015 UTC,"Not always the case. I the file type seems to be relevant as well. I've looked at converting everything over to a single type (.mp4, .avi, etc)."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,hamachangorilla,8,Sun Jun 14 23:45:00 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for the compliment, very much appreciated.  I think there's talks of some of the other groups wanting to resub some episodes. (Paging /u/mickstar813, I think he wanted to do the 24 Hour Tag.) I do comment on the livestream about some of the poor translations, like the Gal Cosplay Bus Tour (how the hell did crepe get translated as ""bureke""?!) However, most of us prioritize subbing episodes that haven't been touched yet. Some of the popular series like Kiki and Absolutely Tasty are popular enough to maybe warrant a resub, so that is a good point.  However, we still aren't nowhere near having a lot of subbers vs how many videos are still unsubbed, so I think it will largely depend on how each sub group will prioritize their to-do list. I'll definitely bring it up with the other groups and see what they think. Thanks!"

GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Mon Jun 15 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"I seem to recall the subs for Tanaka 500 questions to be of dubious quality, at least for kiki episodes, you can sort of get a gist of what's going on. But man...that Tanaka 500 questions sub...sheesh"
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,prototype666,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those weren't great. Hamada's 500 questions was fully subbed (to the best of the translator's ability) but Tanaka's one wasn't properly finished."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,Almonde,2,Sun Jun 28 21:44:00 2015 UTC,"Really the only episodes I think that could do with resubbing are some Absolutely Tasty episodes, and only because some of those were translated from one language to another to English. Stuff like Lego Battle, Castella etc I thought were actually very nice.  It seems like the time resubbing episodes could be better spent doing episodes that haven't been done yet, but maybe that's just me."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,sonitaka,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"I personally don't speak japanese so can't really say but some of the guys who do speak japanese were saying lots of it was wrong but again, I don't know. Since like 3 episodes are being subbed a week it might just be an idea to go back and do the best episodes to a higher standard if they are not there already."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,sonitaka,2,Mon Jun 15 01:38:36 2015 UTC,"If the teams are happy with their subs, I'm not really sure what else they could do besides getting entirely new translators. Also I think it's a case of giving an episode a literal translation vs making it so that it makes more sense in English (like changing jokes so that they convey the same kind of feeling than copying it word for word).  I'm in the same boat as you though in which I don't understand Japanese fully, either, only studying. So I could just be entirely wrong also!"
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,oolongxcha,4,Mon Jun 15 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of these poorly subbed videos are subbed by people/teams that are no longer active, so it's not necessarily that we are happy with these subs, it's just that we didn't do them. I think most of the current translators for Gaki fansubs are Japanese by ethnicity, which helps a lot with the comprehension and translation."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,Otviss,3,Mon Jun 15 04:44:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Also, asking an open question regarding quality and efficiency to the community can be both good and bad. I guess it depends on what video you're doing but when im typesetting i just see it as a whole process, Finishing the work with ""the skills i have"" rather than trying ""to finish it"", Let's say quickly.. resubbing videos that are being watched over and over again such as 24 hour tag. Is a great idea and something i know mickstar wanted to do..  This goes to show that subbers are willing to put down effort in to previous older videos with dedication and not something else."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:16:51 2015 UTC,"I understand if those guys are afraid to come forward incase of backlash but I remember someone critical of Team Gaki in the past being brought into the team to improve things (as it's all volunteer based - anyone that can contribute can join). So it'd be cool if they'd approach Team Gaki privately to become proof-readers or otherwise help out with the process. Like Oolong said, there aren't really that many more subbers than before, just some have had more time on their hands recently, so they'd still appreciate any extra hands."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,typesoshee,3,Mon Jun 15 11:23:13 2015 UTC,"In fact, please just go ahead and point out the exact episode or even file.     some Absolutely Tasty episodes   is too vague (and I don't want to check through every episode to see which ones viewers want most to have resubbed).  Also, only after an exact episode is pointed out can other viewers also chime in about that episode and agree or disagree that it needs a re-sub."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,sonitaka,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:22:35 2015 UTC,"They really only have some missed lines or a bit of awkward grammar at small points, but maybe Chawanmushi, Pasta and maybe the second Rice episode. I'm not picky, I watch em all the time without issues but maybe others feel differently?  I don't think I've watched an episode that's just horrible and in need of desperate resubbing, in any case."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,kuela,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:24:40 2015 UTC,Some of the episodes translation aren't that bad(not the one listed above) but the texts are bad.. I mean black texts and colored texts with black outline. Really hard to read
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,PrioritySeven,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:51:25 2015 UTC,As far as the subbing quality goes I think the recent ones hands down have got the context and subbing to where you aren't missing out.    I think the majority of the Kiki episodes and Absolutely Tasty episodes have errors in them and some are just atrocious (many mistranslated words and context totally skipped).  It might be better if those got resubbed since they are popular but I really think the original 24-hr Tag needs to get an updated sub.
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,Adderkleet,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:11:28 2015 UTC,"With the soft-sub video and sub file, it wouldn't be ""more work"" to re-sub. But it would still take a similar amount of time as subbing a new episode (once the transcription/timings are done - although re-subbing will require re-doing those too).  I get annoyed by parts not subbed (and like 18544920, when all the subtitles are white), but I can't tell if something is badly translated. I'd prefer new content over improved old content, though. And there's only so many people that are willing to sub things. It would be great to see, though."
GakiNoTsukai,39uth6,Doopington,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:02:54 2015 UTC,"I would love to see the last 3 episodes (9,10,11) of Ashita ga Aru sa get subbed."

GakiNoTsukai,39sgc3,Rylix,3,Sun Jun 14 09:05:25 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to get the yearly Batsu games without subtitles are to torrent them from Team Gaki.  http://www.teamgaki.com/more-subtitles/ (I think they are softsubs, but I can't say for sure)  The list in the comment above has mostly unsubbed episodes. Unfortunately, the one with subtitles (marked with ""(sub)"" in the file name) are only available with subtitles. Bad for you, but good for the people who needs subtitles."
GakiNoTsukai,39sgc3,YamasakiGifsTumblr,4,Sun Jun 14 10:30:58 2015 UTC,"In addition to the thread RZ42 posted, each new weekly episode is also posted as a high quality raw in this section of the Gaki forums (Or just look through ErnieYoung's posts as they're the awesome person providing them.)  If there's a particular raw you can't find, try searching for its title in Japanese, you'll probably find them around. You can find their Japanese titles listed here.  Are you interested in subbing raws by the way? If you don't know how then maybe Team Gaki could help you out and hook you up with a typesetter etc."

GakiNoTsukai,39ncoc,Otviss,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"If you want some reasons:   Can render subtitles at the screen resolution, so subtitles will never be pixelated (this is awesome with old raw videos that have low resolution. Hardsubs will use the same resolution and they'll look bad) RAW video has more quality, because using hardsubs means re-encoding said raw video People have some control about subtitles. They can move them around the screen if they want, change size if they think they are too big or things like that"
GakiNoTsukai,39ncoc,knudow,2,Sun Jun 14 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"In terms of quality, there is little difference between the raw and the hardsub. Little as in not even noticable to the eye. But i could be wrong. No expert.   They can move them around the screen if they want, change size if they think they are too big or things like that   In aegisub or the media player?"
GakiNoTsukai,39ncoc,Otviss,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"I control the subtitles using the player, I don't change the file itself.  For example, for English tv shows and movies (English is not my first language) I have the subtitles set to smaller font, semi-transparent and delayed 1.5 seconds so I can look at them if I didn't catch a word they said and they aren't distracting)  When a subbing group releases a video that I have in RAW I usually compare them going to the same frame on full screen and alt-tabbing. Usually the raw has crisper edges. Specially when the release group uploads their own encode to Dailymotion and then Dailymotion applies its own encoding."
GakiNoTsukai,39ncoc,knudow,3,Mon Jun 15 07:58:54 2015 UTC,"I see. Depends on the quality of the encoding.But i'll tell you this. I'm amazed if you feel shrinking subtitles work for you. Since there's alot of on screen boxes and texts. If you shrink those, they wont align properly on the video. And you'll get something that looks pretty weird. I imagine it's very useful for subtitles that are like an ongoing text. Such as the earlier subs for gaki. Get what i mean?  I like your dedication. I'll see if i can get you the file. Stay cool and awesome."
GakiNoTsukai,39ncoc,Otviss,2,Mon Jun 15 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, that was an example for english tv shows! With non-stylized subtitles.  I don't do weird things to .ass subtitles. People spent hours matching them to places in the screen and colouring them!"

GakiNoTsukai,39jr33,mchief190,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:50:34 2015 UTC,Question: Why did Hamada leave? Was there a specific reason?
GakiNoTsukai,39jr33,xn0,6,Fri Jun 12 11:26:17 2015 UTC,Likely adultery.

GakiNoTsukai,39j7gt,shodo453,3,Fri Jun 12 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"If you're in the US:  Amazon search for ""Gaki no Tsukai""  For cheaper price and shipping options for outside the US:  eBay search for ""Gaki no Tsukai DVD""  They're probably region protected though, so you'll have to have a DVD player that can support that."
GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,TofuPandaFansubs,17,Thu Jun 11 02:36:40 2015 UTC,"Hey everybody, finally after a hectic previous week. The green tea episode is here. Since we are rearraging the team a bit since a while back we are still experimenting with a new format. This includes perhaps giving the videos a personal touch. We’ve updated our logo to a temporary panda icon and we’ve of course set up our own website. Hopefully these are some steps towards a new, fresh tofupanda.  This means we would love some feedback on all of these changes. Since we can’t be the only judges to design changes like this. Comment wherever you want to give us feedback or send us an email at tofupandahost@gmail.com. We love it. With that said, these changes are not set in stone. It’s just basic experimenting.  Some changes that have been made to this particular video:   We have added a watermark in the upper right corner. Now tasting and correct answer was given a new look to it. Instead of the red boxes, there are now black boxes. If this is a good change. White boxes with black text would be put on the bottom, for the name of the product. Among some other changes   Once again, experimenting is good and these changes might only apply to this video, tell us the good and bad about these changes!  You can expect more uploads in the very near future. To see what we’re working on, or to know what’s coming up shortly. Please visit the subs section on our website.  Also a big thank you to Lei from Team Gaki for proof reading.  Thank you for your patience, we look forward to releasing more videos for your enjoyment. Stay cool!  Our facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TofuPandaFansubs?fref=ts  Our website: http://tofupandas.tumblr.com/  -Tofupandafansubs"
GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,Donk72,4,Thu Jun 11 02:38:12 2015 UTC,"About the changes: Nothing to complain about. In my opinion any amount of changes are OK as long as you keep it consistent over time. It's good if it's recognisable as a Tofu Panda video.  Otherwise we'd be as clueless as Gaki in this video, sampling inferiorly subbed videos without knowing any better. ;)"
GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,kimilil,2,Thu Jun 11 10:43:48 2015 UTC,Thank you for the feedback!
GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,Whittigo,7,Fri Jun 12 12:09:24 2015 UTC,"Loved the part where Housei shouted his name with Matsumoto.  Also, due to the HD digital signal and the close-ups, Hama-chan and Ma-chan's age are really showing on their faces."

GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,kuela,3,Thu Jun 11 20:46:22 2015 UTC,TY so much. Nothing to do after finals are done XD

GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,oolongxcha,2,Thu Jun 11 03:12:21 2015 UTC,Does Team Gaki have a youtube channel?
GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Thu Jun 11 04:55:13 2015 UTC,"Nope. YouTube is pretty quick on taking down videos, so it's not really worth it."
GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,Adderkleet,4,Thu Jun 11 07:14:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anything NTV, Fuji or possibly other major channels, nope! Smaller regional channels seem possibly OK. My subs from Yomiuri, Kansai TV and Osaka TV seem to stay up."
GakiNoTsukai,39dx69,rakkanoth,2,Thu Jun 11 07:32:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for another great episode! I didn't notice the watermark when watching. I did think the black boxes look a little large or strange, but I'm sure they are no bigger than the Japanese underneath and I cannot think of a better alternative."

GakiNoTsukai,39ajqv,xn0,6,Wed Jun 10 19:53:56 2015 UTC,I really think that these challenges are what fucked up Matsumoto's back now.

GakiNoTsukai,39aiz6,Donk72,4,Wed Jun 10 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"So, I don't understand Japanese and I might get it wrong, but it seems the rest of Gaki bets the figures in front of them on how long it will take for the victims to accept a kiss from Endo, who can only say ""Ma, ma, ma"" to convince them. Am I close?  Also; I've heard ""Ma, ma, ma"" used in conversations before. What does it mean?  Part 2  Edit: Rylix posted Endo Shozo Quiz ""MA MA MA"" II here two years ago, and this one was posted in the comments there. But it was so long ago so I figure some of you haven't seen it."
GakiNoTsukai,39aiz6,Pseudo_Bread,3,Wed Jun 10 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"When I was in Japan I had someone explain 'ma ma ma' to me as something like 'don't get so worked up' or 'calm down', that seems like it would make sense in the context of the video."
GakiNoTsukai,39aiz6,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Wed Jun 10 13:46:44 2015 UTC,Makes sense yeah.  Endo: Sh sh sh (just accept it~)  Victim: ... o_o;;
GakiNoTsukai,39aiz6,oolongxcha,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:16:00 2015 UTC,I wonder if they had been so accommodating if it was a hidden camera show?
GakiNoTsukai,39aiz6,Sudokulord,2,Wed Jun 10 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"""Ma ma ma"" is used in conversation, as said in other comments, like ""Calm down,"" but it can also be used as a filler word to avoid directly answering a question.  Person A: Endo, what are you doing?  Endo: It's okay, well, you know...  It's also used fairly often by older people to younger people when they just want to avoid conflict or saying something like, ""Don't make such a big deal out of it.""  Linguistically, it can be used in a lot of situations!"
GakiNoTsukai,39aiz6,Sudokulord,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:54:46 2015 UTC,"Good to know! So now I can say ""Don't get your knickers in a knot!"" in yet another language.  Thanks!"

Go have a look for yourself and see if you recognise the one you're looking for.  2007 Hospital batsu: Starts here.  2008 Newspaper Agency batsu: Starts here.  2009 Hotel Employee batsu: Starts here.  2010 Spy School batsu: Starts here.  2011 Airport batsu: (Louder than the others!) Starts here and continues here.  2012 Enthusiastic Teachers batsu: Starts here.  2013 Earth Defense Force batsu: Starts here and continues here.  2014 Prison batsu: Starts here and continues here.  All no-laughing new year batsus.  For other ""scary"" batsus, check out the (also quite loud) 1999 Yamasaki's Piano Concert batsu and 2001 Matsumoto Haunted Hotel batsu (part 2). But these are one man batsus and probably not the one you're looking for. Still funny though."

GakiNoTsukai,3935vh,Toyoka,2,Tue Jun 9 17:25:44 2015 UTC,"You can either upload them to mega.co seperately, but for next video along with the ""download"" file. You can zip it in to a compressed file along with the .ass file. So people can watch it on their computer in higher resolution. So basically tenkal is asking for the .ass file."
GakiNoTsukai,3935vh,horticurgy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"it would be great if you could have a centralized place to grab your releases, I thought you guys had a word-press site set up, or a facebook page would do as well and under one post you can link up the hard subs, streaming and softsubs. Just like uploading the hardsubs, you just upload the .ass file to mega and link it. It's a really tiny file so there shouldn't be much problems. And also it would be nice to know what things you've already started or planned so there is no conflict with other subbers."
GakiNoTsukai,3935vh,ultra_22,7,Tue Jun 9 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"Hi Tenkal thank you for your message. We did actually make a wordpress but we received a number of horrible messages and decided that it would be silly to allow people to just make these kind of comments so we are not really using it.  In regards to what we are working on, we will keep working the way we do. We spoke to Oolong and Mickstar and we will not purposefully sub a video that is being subbed by your group but if there is a video that we want to sub and it has not been started, we will not be pressured to not sub the videos. It seems some individuals believe that videos belong to them and this is very strange to us. However at the moment we are having a little break before we carry on releasing content so do not worry about us. On top of this, we are happy to work with you so do not worry. We may also re-sub videos such as Kiki that have been really poorly subbed by certain groups but that is in the future. Many thanks!"

GakiNoTsukai,3935vh,sonitaka,2,Thu Jun 11 22:29:49 2015 UTC,"I believe this is the only Kiki where a member won on the first try, unless it happens in either of the two unsubbed episodes (haven't seen those).  Also, I didn't realize Sekine was so old...he was 56 at the time of filming, and he looks like he could pass for 30-ish. He definitely looks younger than Downtown despite being 10 years older."
GakiNoTsukai,3935vh,aorules,4,Fri Jun 12 10:46:20 2015 UTC,"So, it's apparent someone in here is upset and is downvoting every comment in this thread for no discernible reason other than the fact that it is DTP's thread. But I ask you this, if you are upset with DTP why are you downvoting other people's comments when we have nothing to do with them?"
GakiNoTsukai,3935vh,Hyleal,3,Tue Jun 9 15:51:04 2015 UTC,Why does Tanaka has only 2 stars now? I remember him having same amount as Endo.
GakiNoTsukai,3935vh,short_lurker,8,Tue Jun 9 17:25:27 2015 UTC,This episode is from 2010 and episodes have not been subbed in order so you likely are thinking of a more recent kiki.

GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,someguyfromchi-town,2,Mon Jun 8 22:52:35 2015 UTC,Hopefully nobody wants them to die!
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,horticurgy,4,Tue Jun 9 00:22:39 2015 UTC,Well this makes this skit look awkward.....
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,cesariojpn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"Fuck, that's a good photo of him at 1:15.  I wonder if it was airbrushed."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,cesariojpn,2,Tue Jun 9 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"On Soko Ga Shiritai, they interviewed a former Minister of some department, and he had his entire will and funeral plans all planned out, complete with annual photos of his portrait.   There was also one episode that dealt with a company that would retouch/restore/remake photos due to damage and age.   I'm guessing the skit was from the late 90's/early 00, so I wouldn't say Photoshopped, but well touched up by a prop guy."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,AkaBBaka,3,Tue Jun 9 02:15:19 2015 UTC,"Well, artists have retouched photos for decades before there were digital tools via airbrushing and other techniques (one of the more infamous examples being Stalin having people taken out of photos after they fell out of favour), and it wouldn't surprise me if people preferred to have their best face displayed on something like a formal funeral photo.   Or it might not even be that - could just be a case of the photographer deliberately taking the photo in the most forgiving of circumstances - with makeup, in soft light, and in monochrome/grey to soften any skin imperfections."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,Lexaternum,2,Tue Jun 9 05:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, communist governments were the original airbrushing masters.    Here's a screen shot of the photo.  I think it's the eyebrows especially that have been edited."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,Lexaternum,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:31:08 2015 UTC,"I see.  But in this case, I'm wondering if they purposely made that picture really good-looking (to the point that it starts to not look like Matsumoto) just for fun.    Also, a Youtube comment:   Alex Almansoori 6 days ago What's the music at 1:15-1:40  ... yeah, well, you're not going to find it on the Oricon charts, I can tell him that."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,ekosin,3,Tue Jun 9 02:27:16 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there a video that said that Matsumoto would rather kill himself than attend Hamada's funeral?  Something like, what would Matsumoto do if Hamada were going to die within 24 hours."

GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,MissHunbun,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"i dont quite understand their relationship tbh, can someone point me out and explain me if they have a healthy relationship or is it bad?"
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,kamichama,6,Tue Jun 9 04:11:52 2015 UTC,From my understanding they have a good relationship but they've known each other since they were kids and so don't really have a whole lot to say to each other anymore. Like they don't hang out outside of work so whatever they have to say can be said on the air.
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,MissHunbun,-3,Tue Jun 9 07:39:30 2015 UTC,"I've heard this explanation over and over, but it simply can't be true. There's a wide gulf between a friendly relationship and one where you don't have your comedy partner's cell number and have never once been to their house.  Have you ever heard another example where somebody liked being around another person, but because they were around them so much, they didn't need to be around them anymore? Humans aren't wired that way."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,kamichama,4,Tue Jun 9 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"I have people at that I see almost every day at work. People I'd consider good friends. And on my days off I don't really want to see them cause I just spent the whole week with them. And to top it off, if I'd known them since I was a child, I'd wanna see them outside of work even less.  It makes perfect sense to me. They want to save their interactions for on the screen, because it keeps things fresh"
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,MissHunbun,0,Thu Jun 11 05:07:30 2015 UTC,"On your days off, you don't want to see them, but you probably have at least one of their numbers in your cell phone just because you meet them at some company event at some point, and it just naturally happens. But let's not make this about how you act and project that onto Matsumoto. Instead, let's look at a piece of evidence that directly contradicts what you think ""makes perfect sense"".  In one of the batsu games, they occasionally leave Matsumoto and Hamada alone together, and Matsumoto complains that they did it on purpose to make it awkward. Here's the ideal place where he's at work and on camera, with no chance of ""wasting"" anything.  It's exactly the sort of situation that, according to all this rationalization, he's waiting for, and doesn't want to ever meet Hamada outside of work, just so that it will ""keep things fresh"". Yet, he instantly complains that the staff set up this situation because he wouldn't like it.  Please do your best to explain away this piece of evidence that directly contradicts what you're saying. If you do that, I'll give you another piece of evidence. There is a lot of evidence to support the truth, and only bullshit rationalization for the other side.  Oh, and by the way, downvotes on comments are for comments that are not adding to the conversation, not for ones that you disagree with and then feel compelled to respond to.  bonus comic"
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,kamichama,2,Thu Jun 11 05:47:20 2015 UTC,"First off, please don't assume I was the one downvoting you. In fact, I've made a point of telling people in the past to reply with a respectful argument rather than just downvoting. So your snarky attitude isn't appreciated. If you want to have a discussion with someone, swearing and accusing them of being rude isn't going to endear you to anyone. Also, your condescending comic wasn't funny, and your arrogance is somewhat annoying. So I will downvote you for this post.   Secondly, I'm not projecting myself onto anyone. I was trying to use a personal story to keep it light-hearted and explain it emotionally rather than ""scientifically"". If you watch their interactions when they're alone together, typically it's Matsumoto who is awkward and not Hamada.   This is for two reasons, I'm sure. The first being that it's in Matsumoto's character to complain about everything. He is constantly complaining. Doesn't matter what segment, what show, or anything. he's just whining all the time. He acts up to the extreme to get laughs.  On the other hand, you can tell by watching him that he generally seems somewhat socially awkward. In his interactions with most people he's awkward. Part of this is acting up, of course. But a lot of their ""character"" is just their own personalities magnified to the extreme, as it is with a lot of comedians.   So when he's alone with someone he sees all day every day, and he knows the staff did it on purpose to make him feel awkward, he gets annoyed because he's being forced into a situation he doesn't want to be in. The reaction for most people who are introverted, or awkward, or just very personal, private people is usually one of two things. They will politely make awkward conversation not to be rude or they'll become moody and annoyed. Which of these two is more likely to get laughs and fits in with Matsumoto's character? So he gets petulant and whiny and yells at the staff, as he does in just about every other segment they've done ever.  As for why they don't have each other's numbers. That's personal, but I don't think there's a big mystery behind it. They have known each other and spent more time with each other than about any other person in the freaking world. They're closer to each other than  a freaking married couple. So maybe, and like, I'm just trying to be reasonable here; Maybe they're trying to allow each other some modicum of personal space? So they can spend it with other friends, and family? So they have one avenue in which they aren't completely attached at the hip all the time??   It doesn't seem that far-fetched to me.  And frankly, at this point I don't really care about your ""evidence"". Because according to you, your idea of evidence is that ""humans aren't wired that way"" when I can tell you for a fact that yes, a lot of them are wired that way, and your personal experience in life doesn't constitute the makeup of the entire universe and every person in it."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,kamichama,0,Thu Jun 11 16:00:58 2015 UTC,"You think ""some modicum of personal space"" is the same as ""not having contact information""? If you won't believe the truth when somebody is waving the definitive piece of evidence in your face, I'm not sure what value you can possibly add to a discussion. Can you give one other example of anybody in show business, where connections matter more than they do where ever it is you work, who does not have the ability to contact his or her main partner directly, even though they've worked together daily for decades? You might find an example where the people hate each other, but I doubt you'd find even that. Could you find ones like this that were also childhood friends who started in the business together? The question sounds crazy because it's beyond belief that this could happen.  Matsumoto also said, while not trying to get a laugh, as alluded to earlier, that Hamada would have a lot to apologize for at Matsumoto's funeral. I might have to explain this one. You see, your best friend who is closer than your wife would not be somebody who you'd think to apologize at your funeral, even if they actually would. You'd only say that if you were holding a grudge.  Matsumoto has stated that his most awkward moments at work are when he runs into Hamada's wife backstage. I might have to explain this one as well. A normal person would feel awkward meeting the wife of somebody that he hates, because he doesn't want to say anything that would hurt her feelings.  You rationalizers just make me feel tired all over. How about you take a few deep breaths, and reexamine the evidence without bias? You know, there was a time that I thought Matsumoto and Hamada were great friends, but then, I let go of my suppositions, and looked at the evidence, and I actually changed my mind. I like to think this type of thing is possible for all people."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,Vanofthedawn,0,Fri Jun 12 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"I'm done with the ridiculous conversation because you are literally adding nothing of value to it. Nothing. You're one of those people who say ""I'm right I'm right I'm right and you're allll wrooong"" with a completely closed mind. If you're so stuck on being right all the time you'll never learn anything new, you'll never grow as a person, and everyone around you will continue to think you're just an obnoxious, condescending jerk, with nothing of value to add to anything.  I'd suggest maybe taking a look at your own attitude before you're so quick to belittle others.  And finally, before I'm really done with this forever: I think you need to look up the definition of ""evidence"". Literally nothing you've said is evidence of anything. You're just taking the same information everyone else has, putting a negative spin on it instead, and labeling your personal opinion as ""evidence"".  If anyone is feeling tired it's the rest of the people here, reading all this nonsense you're writing."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,Mespirit,-1,Sat Jun 13 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, we're trying to discern how two people feel about each other, and you're claiming that their actions, which were recorded on video, cannot be called evidence. I guess they should re-hire that cop who pointed a gun at some kids because they only caught his actions on video, and that's apparently not evidence.  Anyways:   ev·i·dence ˈevədəns  noun  1. the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.   Are you claiming that I am not giving you information, or that the information doesn't indicate whether the proposition is true?  Or... perhaps... was it actually you who didn't know the definition of ""evidence"", and didn't bother to look it up, and just assumed that it would match the rotten definition in your brain?  Not that any of this is new behavior. Making up your own definition in your head without looking at the actual definition (which takes 2 seconds on google) is exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from somebody who ignores evidence."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,kamichama,-2,Sat Jun 13 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"Also, at this point, it's ridiculous to claim that you didn't downvote the comment I accused you of downvoting, at the time that I claimed it. Your inability to look up the definition and your insistence that you didn't downvote my comment are the same kind of hypocrisy. ""Being a hypocrite"" seems to be a large part of your personality."
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,ninjadune,3,Sat Jun 13 17:01:35 2015 UTC,Well considering how much time they spend together throughout their workweek I assume any other time is devoted to family or other friends.
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,kamichama,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"Penn & Teller are the same, as well as Adam and Jaime (kind of a different field, but they're still filming entertainment)"
GakiNoTsukai,392tq1,ninjadune,3,Sat Jun 13 19:47:05 2015 UTC,"The question is about people who like each other. I'm sure you can find many examples of people who don't like their partner on a social level, like Adam and Jaime clearly don't get along socially, and they never did. The claim is that Matsumoto and Hamada are close friends, but they don't have each others' numbers in their cell phones.  But honestly, if Adam and Jaime or Penn and Teller don't have each others' numbers in their cell phones, then that would mean their relationships are even worse than reported, not that Matsumoto likes Hamada."
GakiNoTsukai,38xojb,Hashiru,10,Sun Jun 7 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"A Japanese source I found, although I have no idea how reliable it is: http://gogotsu.com/archives/8267  By the way, it's Hamada Bamyu Bamyu.  It's a little puzzling to me though.  What is there left to produce?  They already did a freaking music video.  And although it was a long time ago, Hamada has already done the ""Let's make a pop song for shits and giggles"" thing, never mind the fact that it was with the biggest music producer of Japan at the time and the song is the 17th best-selling single in Japanese pop music history.  I suppose the difference would be that this time would be a parody of a genre whereas H Jungle with T's songs ended up being earnest songs without any parody element.  But I'm still doubtful that Hamada will really want to do this."

GakiNoTsukai,38xojb,typesoshee,5,Mon Jun 8 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"He's the guy that had produced a bunch of the female vocalists that have been huge hits in Japan and elsewhere, and has his own group, called capsule. He produces for Perfume, a 3 person idol group, which have started to make inroads in the US, sort of. IIRC, he was one of the first Japanese artists to do remixes of foreign artists, remixing a song by Kylie (I think that's her name, been a while since I read Wikipedia) in Australia."
GakiNoTsukai,38xojb,Enker-Draco,2,Sun Jun 7 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"He's top bloke in japan when it comes to music, so yeah it's not just a random person."

GakiNoTsukai,38q7jb,b0Stark,2,Fri Jun 5 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I envy that work environment."
GakiNoTsukai,38q7jb,Keynan,3,Fri Jun 5 23:15:14 2015 UTC,Wow. Never thought I'd see a Norwegian video over here. I remember this being a thing back a number of years ago.
GakiNoTsukai,38q7jb,kuela,2,Sat Jun 6 02:08:17 2015 UTC,Same here. FINALLY something posted that I actually understand :P
GakiNoTsukai,38q7jb,mongip,3,Sat Jun 6 16:02:38 2015 UTC,One thing though.. Why is the video in Pets & animals category?
GakiNoTsukai,38q7jb,kuela,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:14:20 2015 UTC,Never noticed that. Perhaps it's to bypass workplace YT filters.
GakiNoTsukai,38nb9i,OwlFreak,6,Fri Jun 5 09:19:29 2015 UTC,"From what I'm aware of it's referred to as the Genkai series, which episodes are as follows:  #331: Ice Coffee  #337: Cold Chinese Noodles  #465: Cutlet Curry  #513: Chashumen  #656: Napolitan  #683: Omelet Rice  Only two have been subbed, as pointed out."

GakiNoTsukai,38nb9i,FinalRadio,2,Fri Jun 5 09:31:57 2015 UTC,That's it! Thanks a bunch =O)
GakiNoTsukai,38nb9i,TheOldOak,2,Fri Jun 5 09:39:55 2015 UTC,"The napolitan one was hilarious, but what is the connection between タモリさん and the dish?"
GakiNoTsukai,38nb9i,DarkSpikeX,2,Sat Jun 6 12:00:28 2015 UTC,"When this aired, Tamori-san was a very well known comedian and hosted a television show called Waratte Iitomo.  His real name is Kazuyoshi Morita.  The relevance is just the same as Otsuru Gitan, another Japanese celebrity, whose name happens to vaguely resemble the pronunciation of Napolitan.  It would be like asking for a Stephen Fry when you want a stir fry.  If you are very familiar with the actor, it would be very difficult to understand what they really want."
GakiNoTsukai,38nb9i,FinalRadio,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:49:30 2015 UTC,No clue sorry.
GakiNoTsukai,38nb9i,TheOldOak,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:34:36 2015 UTC,タモリさん   I guess there's no connection but the pronounciation even though they really don't sound anything alike
GakiNoTsukai,38i81l,PeanutButterGakiTime,4,Thu Jun 4 11:38:09 2015 UTC,I watched Bigun's raw and then just cut the missing scene from the Dailymotion hardsub and watched that separately. https://mega.co.nz/#!VYdyiKga!Bi56FmgtTpsStHLRV3cv3qy9IOYyj3LFgbwijiTusC8
GakiNoTsukai,38i81l,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Thu Jun 4 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, so that's why the subs skipped a lot.  I'm using Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!! - No-Laughing Prison New Years Special 2014 (720p KTK 2014-31-12).mkv because I like how it looks better, altough I have to retime the subs a from time to time.  If the non-subed part is missing from the raw used, then the missing thing is when they walk to the end of the mission and have to run back with an explosoin in the background."
GakiNoTsukai,38i81l,knudow,2,Thu Jun 4 12:37:51 2015 UTC,I also would like to ask since this corresponds directly with the Prison Batsu but did Jimmy make an appearance in this batsu game?

GakiNoTsukai,38fmrs,Toyoka,7,Sat Jun 6 21:07:12 2015 UTC,I also understand that the lyrics were written by Matsumoto and are about his childhood. Maybe someone can elaborate further on this.
GakiNoTsukai,38fmrs,hideyoshisdf,6,Wed Jun 3 23:39:29 2015 UTC,"yes, Matsumoto wrote it. He grew up poor, and the lyrics are a bit sad.  You can see when it was played on lincoln radio: https://youtu.be/RvLm9CQVvpU?t=5m11s (there is a fake sad story first)  This video has the lyrics translated."

GakiNoTsukai,38d5y0,BurntJoint,9,Wed Jun 3 13:24:05 2015 UTC,Is that about the blackface bullshit from the other thread or did i miss out on some other juicy drama somewhere?
GakiNoTsukai,38d5y0,oolongxcha,9,Wed Jun 3 13:59:56 2015 UTC,I actually don't think it's the blackface post. I think it's due to a comment on Downtown Power's post.
GakiNoTsukai,38d5y0,BurntJoint,4,Wed Jun 3 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"It better not be that, because if it is, making a dedicated mod post to remind us of the rules over one single deleted comment is a joke and a waste of everyone's time.   Modtools are there for a reason, they can delete the comment and ban the user if necessary... easy. No need for this."
GakiNoTsukai,38d5y0,Hashiru,6,Wed Jun 3 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"It wasn't about the black face topic. There were some individuals who have some issues with each other.  This post was just a little reminder.  Next time, the modtools will be used appropriately."

GakiNoTsukai,38d5y0,Butcherandom,3,Thu Jun 4 01:01:01 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it is.  I've been on here for a while and every now and it seems a few users love to start a black face topic.  Then people pile on the hate and ""outrage"" and the comments get really nasty.    The next time we see black face we should just down vote it to hell or take the high road and not comment on it.  No reason to bring this sub down to the level of the trolls."
GakiNoTsukai,38d5y0,BurntJoint,3,Wed Jun 3 14:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'd be genuinely surprised if it was. The comments in that thread, which I also participated in, were not rude or harassing in my opinion. The community as a majority seems to disagree with my own thoughts on the topic, which I'm disappointed in. But I felt the comments were civil, even though they were divisive."
GakiNoTsukai,38d5y0,Butcherandom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"Clearly it's a topic people are interested in having a debate about, and it's possible to have a debate about it without resorting to personal attacks.   This is not the subreddit to hold that debate. There are plenty of Japanese related subreddits, as well as other subreddits dedicated to answering users questions.   Its fine to discuss it in the context of what is actually happening in the specific video, but blackface in Japan is more widespread than a GnT video and when the discussion inevitably leads to talking about Japan's history of blackface and other racial subjects, it falls outside the scope of this subreddit."
GakiNoTsukai,38d5y0,Peaaaa,8,Wed Jun 3 14:57:49 2015 UTC,I don't know how you have a coherent conversation about the topic as it pertains to the show without acknowledging the history and context that it's occurring in.

I too was one of those people who kinda remembered watching this subbed before, but I must have been mistaken. There were many parts here that I didn't remember, so I must have just seen the recap from the beginning of the Yugawara Batsu.  And overall, may I say, Hosei was particularly nasty in this episode. Keep your mouth shut and stop spitting out food ya heathen."

Even the old ones before no-laughing became the standard, when they just used to make bets could be fun.  The electric roulette have been subbed, and posted here some time ago, but the bowling tournament that detemined the paticipants of the Hot Spring Inn batsu and the metal pan roulette before the Police Station batsu would be great. The latter was up on YouTube (I think) in an awful version with non-synced sound that was just frustrating to try to watch."

Hospital - I've watched this one multiple times with an odd fascination. The hidden pits were just diabolical. The Chono slap when Yamazaki was recovering from his intestinal problems.  The doctor smacking the shit out of anesthetized patients to the point where Hamada tells her to stop. A lot of priceless moments that had me laughing like crazy.   Onsen - This one seemed a bit less contrived to me. There were still plenty of setups, but the best moments were just them BSing around amongst themselves, making each other get the wrath of the blowdarts, and Matsumoto falling into his own traps."

GakiNoTsukai,37xrg2,kuela,4,Sun May 31 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Ryokan, Yugawara and High school had much more severe punishments than from Police Station onwards. They're not entirely comparable."

Even my wife was laughing at me with our newborn baby (born September 8th 2012)."
GakiNoTsukai,37xrg2,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Sun May 31 10:50:58 2015 UTC,"They don't use boiling water.  They lower the temperature of the room significantly and use luke warm water (think about the temperature of a nice bath).  The steam and reactions make it look hot.  Yamasaki does not get hit that hard, it does some damage but its not as bad as it sounds or looks.  He really knows how to take a hit well! If someone were to hit you with hands the size of Chono your eyes would water.  Just look at Tanaka's face when he got slapped by Chono in one of the batsu games.  His cheeks are flush and you can see his eyes start to well up a bit with tears (its just physiologically what your body does in response to such an impact).  He wasn't able to throw his body like Hosei in the bus and thus took the hit pretty hard."
GakiNoTsukai,37xrg2,PrioritySeven,3,Sun May 31 18:51:54 2015 UTC,"About hot water from a article interviewing trainee Yoshimoto comedians:   The writers and producers also try not to kill or maim their performers. “You have to maintain safety,” says Aki Yorihiro, CEO of the company’s new American subsidiary, Yoshimoto Entertainment USA. “But first and foremost it has to be entertaining. Our comedians are playing a real game, and they are subjected to real punishments. But their reactions, their state of mind, their overall attitude … all of that combines to make it entertaining.” Some observers have suggested that the danger and pain of batsu games are exaggerated for dramatic effect—for instance, there was no way for Power Purin viewers to know whether the soup was actually boiling. But Ogata claims, through a translator, that it really was skin-searingly hot. Gum-blisteringly hot. “Hot!” he insists, the only English word I’ve heard him use all day.   Regarding Housei and the slap, this is from an interview after the EDF batsu:   ""It’s like this, the pain remains for 2 days. Then later, after a few days, you forget about it. But, in fits and starts you’re like eh!? Why does it hurt… oh! That!!”, he laughs, “When you least expect it the pain comes back again,” the middle-aged man reveals the intermittent muscle pain symptoms.   Housei doesn't only get slapped by Chono though, his cheeks have probably swollen by now to accommodate/cushion the abuse ;;"
GakiNoTsukai,37xrg2,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Sun May 31 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"I'd also say that the melted wax used sometimes has to be pretty hot to be in a liquid state.  People use it in sexy times, but they also aren't getting a bucket of it dumped on them.  The wax probably does hurt a lot, but only for a limited time and causes no damage (hopefully)."
GakiNoTsukai,37xrg2,odrop,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the punishments are probably hot or cold enough to give the body a shock (like the electric shock devices they put on their cheeks etc.) and cause a reaction, but they're only exposed briefly and in some cases they are given an optional reprieve (e.g. oxygen masks, whatever happens behind that curtain during those towel guys fights).  It'll always be their word against others so no-one can really 'prove' anything, but our perspective might be different to the Japanese industry. Famous people dumping spine-chillingly cold buckets of water over themselves was a big viral success since it was unprecedented to see. With Gaki such suffering was relegated to second fiddle beside getting Thai Kicked!"

Especially in the last, Prison one, I was genuinly surprised he got the most and by such a big margin. I was expecting one of the younger members to ""win"".  I feel with the more or less same script of the latest batsu games they keep Matsumoto the most punished as another part of the batsu game (even when it might not be true)."

GakiNoTsukai,37w473,Amsteah52,6,Sat May 30 22:02:59 2015 UTC,"You'll often hear the pronunciation shortened to something like ""suimasen"" or ""summasen."" It's sort of like when we use ""kinda"" or ""sorta."" Just a colloquialism."
GakiNoTsukai,37w473,strokemouth,4,Sat May 30 23:10:47 2015 UTC,"There's quite a few ways to say ""sumimasen"" based on dialect, politeness, etc. There's like ""suimasen"", ""sunmasen"", ""suman"", etc. Especially in the case of the Gaki guys, they say it very quickly and particularly with Downtown, it can be said in a Kansai accent, so it's hard to hear it clearly."
GakiNoTsukai,37w473,oolongxcha,3,Mon Jun 1 07:13:18 2015 UTC,"No doubt, this probably confused OP.  I'll also add that the sound at the end is more accurately ""ng"" but it's always written as just ""n"" in Latin characters I guess for brevity.  But it's really closer to ""ng.""  Then, when it's said quickly in Japanese, it becomes more of a nasal sound (kinda like the French ""bon"").  If you don't hear the nasal sound, it'll just sound like ""suimase-""."
GakiNoTsukai,37w473,typesoshee,3,Mon Jun 1 19:40:57 2015 UTC,suman is also a contraction of sumimasen
GakiNoTsukai,37w473,bionicbadger,2,Sun May 31 02:37:00 2015 UTC,Doesn't it sound more like simasen the way they pronounce it?
GakiNoTsukai,37w473,billylooser,4,Sat May 30 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yea it's sort of like shorthand/informal way of saying sorry. They are also pronouncing it in Kansai dialect, so it sounds slightly more ""slurred/loose""."
GakiNoTsukai,37w473,Toyoka,2,Sat May 30 23:08:23 2015 UTC,"I don't speak Japanese, and have only picked up a few words from the various shows, but I thought they were saying 'Sumimasu'; at least it sounded like that to me."
GakiNoTsukai,37w473,JoetheGrim,2,Sat May 30 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"Whenever I imitate the Gaki guys, I always get corrected by my fiance over pronunciation. I point out that's not how the comedians are saying it, but he's been taught Tokyo dialect, not Kansai, and he has a wider exposure to Japanese, having been there and watching a lot of other shows, dramas, animes etc. I just wonder how weird it would look to see a chibi white girl start talking in the Kansai dialect. Kind of like that truck driver bit one of the female comedians does?"
GakiNoTsukai,37w473,SorcPenz,5,Wed Jun 3 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"Pronunication-wise it's more ""se n"" than ""en"" with the lone ""n"" being very short. It's like if you were to say ""send"" without the d. I imagine when said fast, like you say, short syllables get even shorter."

His blood type is B, nickname is ""Ega-chan"" (エガちゃん). A 2005 Oricon and 2002 - 2008 Nikkei Entertainment! poll named him as the most annoying comedian in Japan because of his obscene and vulgar comedic style. His performance heavily relies on shock value, much like that of GG Allin, Dane Cook and the cast of Jackass. Contrary to this image as an annoying, shocking performer, it has been remarked on shows like Mecha-Mecha Iketeru! that he is extremely polite and humble when the camera is not rolling. He is known for extremely good manners when dealing with TV staff, which may be part of why he is still on TV. Additionally, his frequent co-stars Yusuke Santamaria, Tsuyoshi Kusanagi and Ninety-Nine etc. are declared fans of Egashira.

I also think the show might've leaned more towards doing wacky things since I think that was Jimmy's strength, and doing skits, and been less of a variety show.  All in all, not negative or positive, just different"
GakiNoTsukai,37lv4r,InsaneTeaparty,3,Thu May 28 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"His role might overlapped with Hosei as the bullied one. In the end, from my personal opinion.. Hosei might have to leave GnT.. I've seen little videos of Jimmy outside of the Batsu games but.. He does have the natural funny face(not trying to be rude) and the way he carries himself opposed to the ever shouting Hosei might be more appealing to the crowd."
GakiNoTsukai,37lv4r,kuela,3,Thu May 28 23:04:23 2015 UTC,"I did enjoy Yamazaki vs Jimmy, the blind leading the blind sorta in competing to see who's the bigger fool. Still Jimmy left so early in the show that it's tough to say how they could of expanded on that. I feel Housei is still kind of a boke to Matsumoto in many ways (and Hamada really, like a tsukkomi/boke triangle).  You know way way back in the early 90s when Housei was still in his Team Zero manzai duo he was in some kind of school comedy with Jimmy Onishi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suf60joOCAY"

GakiNoTsukai,37jq6x,wolf4537,14,Thu May 28 03:08:11 2015 UTC,"To preface, I love the five together, and GNT has become one of my favorite things to watch. They really feel like best friends trying to make each other laugh, and I feel that translates through all languages.   Matsumoto - His comedy translates so well even without subtitles. You can laugh at his mannerisms just as much as his jokes and banter.  Hamada - the tsukommi is the straight man, the foil to the 'boke'. So he might not be as outlandish and enthusiastic as Mastumoto, but thats what makes him the number two guy. Hamada plays off Matsumoto perfectly. Without his dry humor and sadism, Matsu couldn't seem as crazy and boisterous as he is. They both have great timing and know when to play off each other. Its why they're one of the most influential comedic partnerships.  Housei - Housei feels like the third wheel with Downtown. You can tell he really tries hard to be on par with them. Since he puts in a lot of effort, he seems to land a few more laughs and opportunities than Cocorico. Young Housei was insane and willing and downtown used that to their advantage. **See housei cage wrestle animals!  Tanaka- Cocorico is  less defined and refined than downtown. Both Tanaka and Endo exhibit both boke and tsukommi styles and thus get a little stale in their characters. Tanaka ,however, seems to play up his innocence and skiddish-ness. Hes the gangly, emotional, scardy-cat. Unlike most, I actually find his tendency to fall over from freight pretty funny. They seem pretty genuine to me. Tanaka and Heipo trying to make their way through a dark forest was hilarious!  Endo- For me, Endo ends up getting lost in the group. Often he is not funny on his own, but will find himself setup in funny scenarios like the text message interrogation in Enthusiastic Teachers. The staff likes to poke at his playboy lifestyle, but they literally have to spy on him to get the funny stories out. His family and ex-wife end up funnier than him. Sorry Endo :(  My favorite supporting characters are Heipo and Itao! Two great characters on their own."

GakiNoTsukai,37jq6x,JohnnysBoxes,3,Thu May 28 05:14:54 2015 UTC,"Young Housei was insane and willing and downtown used that to their advantage.    Haha totally! They used to do some insane pranks on him like coming to his home and chucking out his bed then setting off firecrackers/doves, all because he was so willing for comedy's sake.  Housei I believe attended the same Osakan comedy training school that Downtown had graduated from, at the time Downtown had stayed on as seniors until their move to Tokyo where they began Gaki. So I think they have a really long history together. Housei says when he first met Downtown he was pleasantly surprised at how casual they were with him despite seniority.   Back then Housei was the boke in his own manzai duo (Team Zero) but when his tsukkomi partner left to become a film director I think both Matsumoto and Hamada became great tsukkomis for him on Gaki. Outside Gaki his friendliness means anyone feels free to tsukkomi against him too."

GakiNoTsukai,37jq6x,Doniac,3,Fri May 29 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"When I first watched GnT I thought Hamada was the leader of the group, probably due to his overpowering and abusive sadist nature. But I soon realized the comedic genius of Matsumoto is at the heart of the show."

Tanaka seems like a sweet guy. I've seen Housei ask for Tanaka to be the one dealing out a batsu because he knows he'll be much gentler than the others."

I love how he's the boke with Hamada yet can turn his hand to being a hilarious tsukkomi with Housei (who's everyone's boke).  Since they all contribute in their own way I think I'll leave it at my top two =)"
GakiNoTsukai,37jq6x,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Thu May 28 12:40:46 2015 UTC,"1: Matsumoto - The funniest and kindest of the group. He emits this energy that makes you happy and laugh. And yes, a lot of his jokes don't need to be translated to understand.  2: Hamada - Although I'm not a fan of his sadism there are jokes that point it out and use it as a great punchline. Him and Matsumoto are the oldest but also the most experienced and can do amazing jokes alone, as a duo or with the rest of the group.  3: Hosei - He has a very unique personality that allows him to make you laugh when he's making a bad joke, get's angry or becomes a punching bag.  4-5: Tanaka + Endo - It's a bit sad, these guys are pretty funny outside of the batsu games but for few years now Tanaka is just there for the Thai kick and scary part and Endo for his family. Endo was great when he was going through his marriage problems (sounds mean but his reactions to the jokes were always positive). After that he seems to get lost in the crowd."

I also like his somewhat serious side and think its funny.    3-4) Yamasaki: I think he plays his role well.  Although he plays the role he truly isn't at the comedic level the rest of GnT is at but he has his moments.  Matsumoto once said this about Yamasaki ""Every now and then he blossoms and then he slowly dries up and wilts and becomes Yamasaki again"".  I think it is spot on.  5) Endo: I think he is funny but out of all the GnT members I feel like he is utilized the least :("

GakiNoTsukai,37jq6x,theRacistEuphemism,1 point,Sat May 30 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"Well.. 1. Downtown. I couldn't choose between the two and just like Matsumoto-san said in the food critique episode, Downtown is legendary when both of them is together. In the previous years, Matsumoto-san is really funny as the Boke.. But as the year goes on.. He's becoming a bit bitter.. Like a real, proper Oji-san.. Hamada-san on the other is funny and detestable in his earlier years but becoming a bit of a Boke himself lately. He's becoming a bit more tame and likeable. My second favourite cast is Tanaka-san. I recently saw the Yamazaki-san head shave and the way he retaliate against Hamada-san is really, really funny. Seriously, I couldn't get enough. His other charm would be his typical reaction to scary stuffs. Next would be Endo-san. He's not really that funny by himself or maybe as Cocorico too. But his life or mere prescience  create an opportunity for the other cast members to produce funny stuffs. Lastly would be Hosei-san. He's funny don't get me wrong.. But I don't like his shouting.  Guest members ranking would be : 1. Jimmy-san 2. Itao-san 3.Heipo-san 4. Chiaki-san 5. Shin Onii  My least favourite guest would be the Fundoshi guys.

Endo- Seeing how what he does in his personal life come back and bites him in the batsu games, And lets not forget ""Ogouu!""  Tsukitei Hosei- How he tries to make the others laugh and ultimately fails unless he's getting hurt.  Tanaka- His Spaz-like mannerisms and when people call him chin man.  Hamada- I think he's funny, but the reason he's my least favorite is because he's kind of a dick.  I don't hate any of them though, they all coincide perfectly with each other."

GakiNoTsukai,37jq6x,CALLANSE,1 point,Thu May 28 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"Matsumoto - easily the most intelligent and funny member. He's also the least secure, making gripes and quips about the other members. I can't tell if it's his character or his competitiveness. People on this subreddit have suggested I'm reading too much in to it. I cite this as an example: Michael Jordan, easily the most recognizable, talented, and successful basketball player in the history of the sport used his acceptance speech into the Basketball Hall of Fame to lay out petty criticisms against his rivals throughout the years. The man had everything...fame, fortune, untarnished legacy, but his ego couldn't let him be magnanimous in the moment acknowledging his career as a whole.  I think during certain moments of exhaustion, Matsumoto has this side as well.   Housei - I like Housei's humor in that he relies on the awkwardly cringing moments to make people laugh in the show. The running gag is that his jokes fall flat and I hated him in the beginning. But once I understood that was his shtick, I  appreciated him for it. In the US, it's quite expected to be solo act in stand-up and such. But I'm learning the Japanese preference for comedic duo acts, which have largely fallen out of favor in the US. So I admire Housei for doing sacrificing cool image for the sake of being funnier. And I love how he gags for the other 4 to get them to laugh when Sonny appears, when he has to wear a ridiculous outfit, etc. I'd love to see some of his Rakugo clips translated.   Hamada - I don't really like Hamada at all. I get that his personality is a necessary ingredient for the group to have the peak dynamic. But still, I just don't like him at all. He strikes me as the kind of guy who would hit on your sister at her wedding.  Tanaka - He's just so damn quiet and timid in personality. His gag is how weak/timid he is. Of all the people in the group, Tanaka strikes me as the most honorable, least likely to be a piece of shit off-screen.   Endo - really scummy...a pretty boy who relies on looks to get by, a tiresome act to pull off in one's 40s. He strikes me as the kind of guy who was a C student in high school and got other people to do things for him. I've never laughed at anything he's said or done that wasn't in some way the result of other's setup. He contributes very little to group. Even that Frisk joke is getting old. I'd rather see Jimmy as part of the group than Endo."

GakiNoTsukai,37anx3,Hashiru,18,Tue May 26 05:42:00 2015 UTC,"Actually for some years he became a director of NTV as a whole, being responsible for deciding what shows to take on which took up most of his time.  ""The last two years I've been working to watch 22 programs a week as a quota. But the work was merely to check whether the program was 'interesting', searching as a critic. Also checking as a final bastion, important work, but I entered into such a thing for the company.""  With all that other work to do he had less time to be chief producer on Gaki and so the other acting producers took on more responsibility for the show e.g. Akira Onuma, Sakurada Kazuyuki, Yasuoka Yoshiro, Takeuchi Takami etc. The one announcing the continuation of the batsu last year was producer Yuichi Otomo.  Suga's retirement was more from his role in the head office of NTV as he said:  ""Gradually I thought that I wanted to return to the production side. It was a feeling that became uncontrollable. Not to only say what was liked, an expression of a risk taker.""  So in effect he actually now has more time to be with the Gaki show as a freelancer. In fact, right after the 'retirement' he did an amazing lip-syncing performance in this Gaki episode:  http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5411"

Googling around, it seems his reason for retiring NTV was that the higher up you go (in the corporate ladder), the further away you get from the actual studio.    菅氏によれば、同社では役職が高くなればなるほど、現場から離れることになるという。   And he says he really wanted to finish his career while working in the studio with cast members.     菅氏は「僕が圧倒的に思ったのは、芸人さんとずっと一緒で死にたいって思ったんですよ。他は要らないんです。芸人さんだけ」と打ち明け、退社せざるを得なかったことを告白した。   There's also speculation that being a ""free producer"" (i.e. someone who isn't on a TV network's payroll but is hired from the outside as an independent) actually can get you higher pay.   フリーだとタレントと同レベルで稼げるらしい        局Pより地位は上"

GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,SPLENDEUR,6,Tue May 26 03:04:44 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, he's never been ""out"" - the one closest for him coming to any kind of ""punishment"" was in the police batsu (good episode), when the guy playing the police commander (who arrived into show in motorcycle sidecar) got very close and personal with Fujiwara (of course he laughed and got away scot-free), though I think the guy mistook him as a cast member"
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,Lowell_Yuri,6,Mon May 25 21:44:09 2015 UTC,Don't forget when they made him play the sword in a barrel word game in the same batsu game. I was hoping he would make the thing pop up and get thai kicked.
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,SPLENDEUR,2,Tue May 26 05:56:10 2015 UTC,"YES. Totally forgot about that! If Fujiwara had taken the triggering sword, I think Tanaka would've copped the kick - who else? Then probably everyone else for laughing at his misfortune."
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,CactusFanta,5,Tue May 26 06:40:11 2015 UTC,Since he is the Gamemaster he is exempt from all the rules. He hasn't been out as far as I can remember.
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,jononyx,3,Mon May 25 21:06:57 2015 UTC,"Naw, but Hamada has slapped him many times for stumbling over his lines"
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,kamichama,2,Tue May 26 01:42:38 2015 UTC,"He hasn't yet, but I expected it to happen during the recent Chono scenes. You'll notice that he almost always has made Fujiwara participate in his tests to find the ""traitor"" in most recent Batsu Games sans the prison one (The most recent. 2015.) I know that he had to press his finger against the alien's in the earth defense force episode. He wasn't called ""Out"" but still had to participate.  I'd love to see him in a Kiki series though, like Heipo! I can already see them bashing Fujiwara."
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,Ahanaf,1 point,Mon May 25 22:30:09 2015 UTC,"You think he's going to record himself as ""OUT""? Why would he do that?  Also, generally, except for the five core members, being called out is more of a surprise than anything. I think when they shoved the microphone into his face and ask him to say his own name, it might ruin the surprise."
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,Tartarox,1 point,Mon May 25 23:01:21 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine someone else would do it, otherwise the surprise is... outed."
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,Braber02,1 point,Mon May 25 23:56:12 2015 UTC,"As far as i know, there has been no 'Outo' for Fujiwara. But, i remember seeing a interview of Yamazaki. He bought those button that said 'Fujiwara Out'. I cannot remember if it was ~'Fujiwara Out'~~ or '[Host name] Erika out'."
GakiNoTsukai,378x7b,godofwar7018,3,Mon May 25 23:36:06 2015 UTC,I think you're talking about this.

GakiNoTsukai,36wy5f,ZZZ-Top,7,Sat May 23 04:14:39 2015 UTC,"Haha setting himself up for the fall as usual. I like how a lot of his humor can be understood without words, via facial expressions, gestures etc. The way he didn't just turn around immediately was great.  Still remember when he got trapped on the stairs last year heh. Also memorable was when he got chased by a car (maybe Spy).  By the way, kind of looks like someone's in that room next to Housei, maybe one of the staff or just my imagination."
GakiNoTsukai,36wy5f,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Sat May 23 01:22:20 2015 UTC,"The sign says something about entering or maybe not entering, so, I guess it's a staff-only room."

GakiNoTsukai,36wy5f,Blackdeath_663,13,Sat May 23 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"As they're improvisational comedians, everywhere's a stage =)  The Oni guys are likely instructed via ear pieces by the staff watching on the 20 TV screens they have in the staff-only rooms on location, but I don't get the impression the cast are informed where they'll appear. However I'm sure Housei expected that an Oni could come since he wasn't protected or anything (he'd just been whacked prior after all).  Also of course he intentionally set himself up for a fall. Just like there was no real reason for them to try the wrong key twice on Matsumoto's door, there wasn't a real reason for Housei to block the hallway and bluster indignantly, but I get the impression it's comedians doing a comedy routine (like the whole food sharing scene in 24 Hour Tag).  Housei's reaction here is likely intentionally comical, a more typical reaction would be to immediately turn around. That's why I think the western remakes of Gaki didn't work as well, they tended to use members of the public or celebrities who have raw reactions, whereas improvisational comedians can build on top of that raw reaction. An average person might fall over when they trip but a comedian can take that to absurd lengths, especially in Japan where they have that whole ""falling over/forwards"" gag (you see it in anime a lot but comedians also do it)."

GakiNoTsukai,36ze4y,theRacistEuphemism,3,Sat May 23 12:39:47 2015 UTC,"The end of the year batsu game has turned into a tradition.  They call it ""Fuu-butsu-shi"" or basically a seasonal event.  So I think it will continue to maintain most of the same format with differences to the theme and minor gags that they have in between.  The yearly batsu opposes Kohaku-utagassen which is even a greater tradition (going on since the 50s').  It also has a predictable formula.  I can't speak for Japanese people but I tend to think the predictable formula works best simply because its a seasonal event so you need consistency year to year.  I think of the yearly batsu and Kohaku as a routine people include in their lives to bring in the new year.  That routine part is probably key to retain the large viewership they have (~18%).  Pretty amazing feat considering Kohaku's lowest has been 35% and highest 85%!"

GakiNoTsukai,36ze4y,rad_wimp,3,Tue May 26 03:35:20 2015 UTC,"Some previous debate on this topic that has a lot of interesting discussion.  http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=3603  http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=898  http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=4725  http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=3339  I think there's stuff I'd enjoy seeing changed up (e.g. the way Chono enters) but at the same time entirely removing them might affect the success of the series as there's a reason some like to see them again and again (e.g. I still enjoy Chono vs Housei). For example Jimmy Onishi appearing each year being removed from the main airing (think he's still in the extras maybe) has met with negative reactions. Each year though there are those who find it the best year ever so it's all subjective, I don't really have a favorite year, just moments from each I really liked. Though last year's got their highest ever ratings and was in the news so that's tough to beat.  Though it was in an interview about his film work I do find this Matsumoto quote relevant about his age:   Interviewer: Could you tell us your thoughts on turning 50 and your thoughts on the prospect of one day turning 100?  Matsumoto: When I entered this industry, to be honest I thought I would have retired by now. But here I am still doing it, and I have no intention of retiring. I wonder how long I can keep it up …  Interviewer: Do you think the timing of your retirement will be something you choose yourself?  Matsumoto: I wonder. Even if I wanted to keep working, but I couldn’t get any jobs, then for all intents and purposes I would have retired. But it’s hard to say. I guess my personality is such that if people want me continue, I will."
GakiNoTsukai,36ze4y,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Sat May 23 12:48:27 2015 UTC,Yes. I've always enjoyed the lunches. How they fight over one bowl and some ingredients or play games to get condiments. Kinda disappointed they didn't do it this year. The demons was good this year though. Tanaka totally crapped his pants.
GakiNoTsukai,36ze4y,MrGraywood,1 point,Sat May 23 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"That could of been another thing moved to the Extra Footage episode, I haven't seen the extras yet though.  I felt there were more demons/Oni in the tag game last year and the treasure hunt seemed a bit more organized (the key boxes this year seemed to just appear when the staff decided to chuck 'em out in the open heh). Still I like any return of the tag game, some feel it takes away from the ""Do Not Laugh"" aspect but personally I always enjoy it =D Just another one of those things that gets split opinions."

But I kinda wished they would bring back the older format, where they do a challenge and whoever fails enter the Batsu game. It's always funny to see the survivors orchestrating pranks for the loser. But it's next to impossible to bring back that format nor would they. The 5 man batsu bring in more rating.  As for the retirement.. I think by the time Downtown hit 60. Or some serious injury or rating drop tremendously."
GakiNoTsukai,36ze4y,kuela,2,Sun May 24 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"At some point in the future, I would imagine they bring in younger people (License, etc.) or change around the way the batsu games work (maybe something like Downtown vs Cocorico or the Gaki team being the punishers or something of that sort)."
GakiNoTsukai,36ze4y,Toyoka,1 point,Sun May 24 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I think even when GNT goes away, the New Year's Batsu will continue, just with new cast.

GakiNoTsukai,36zrp7,TheLegendOf1900,3,Sat May 23 15:02:27 2015 UTC,"Heya, When someone links to an external blog or forum thread, Reddit automatically picks an image from the external page as the thumbnail. In the case of the Team Gaki blog, it uses auto-generated avatars for users without their own avatar, and Reddit picks up one of these at random.  If I remember right blogs have a few auto-avatar systems you can choose from e.g. random shapes instead of those doodle creatures you saw. So they might be able to switch it if you ask.  But I think you can go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/ and select ""don't show thumbnails next to links""  EDIT: Alternatively I think the subreddit is now defaulting to the same image for all Team Gaki blog posts, so you can use AdBlocker to apply a block filter just for that one image (unsubscribe from AdBlockers other filters though if you wanna support sites which rely on ads). I've used AdBlocker in the past to disable certain peoples avatars or signatures on forums that were creeping me out heh.  This is the image url to add a filter for:  http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uz1hV5rbgxxX7wM0nrtn3Ihh7SAWYll3fF31mUamM3I.jpg"

GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,cossack_wannabe,16,Thu May 21 22:50:55 2015 UTC,"Matsumoto has always made jokes like this about how Hamada doesn't get slapped enough, Yamazaki doesn't get slapped enough etc. They all have done, ever since the first do not laugh batsu. Personally, I see it as Japanese humour and Matsumoto always wants to look vulnerable.  Saying that... He's become a bit of a jiji, always moaning etc. I have watched Downtown for around 17 years now and I've been surprised by how much everyone here reads into things that are said or done. Of course I may be wrong about some things so please don't bite if I am!   A lot of people believe that they won't do a No laughing thing every year. In my experience, Japanese people tend to let people know that it will be their last time doing something so I'm quite confident they will do a Batsu Game this year. I would put money on that it will be the final one, a HUGE hurrah potentially but that's just my personal opinion. I think the whole bringing License into many more of the episodes also says something. The whole 'do Hamada and Matsumoto hate each other'. They definitely do not hate each other and I do think they play on the fact they are not great friends. I am sure they have some sort of a friendship still, it's just unthinkable that they wouldn't to me. But working with each other every single day, you probably wouldn't be that bothered to have dinner with them afterwards :P From the text you've written, if I were to translate that into Japanese and into a way I believe Matsumoto would say it, it wouldn't sound as negative as it does in English. It's hard to explain but I really don't think he sounds as negative as made out to be.   But hey, I may be wrong so please don't bite my head off. I'm just saying what I think but I do feel that everything is still normal. The whole point for the segments where a lot of other celebrities come in is so that they get air time too.   Once again, I may be wrong but I am quite relaxed about the whole situation. I think Matsumoto has just become a bit more grumpy and I wouldn't be surprised if he is bored of the games but that is about it... a 52 year old getting hit in the arse for laughing for new years eve... That should say enough xD"
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,mickstar813,2,Thu May 21 23:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you have watched Mythbusters but I tend to think Hamada and Matsumoto's relationship is similar to Jamie and Adam.  Jamie and Adam also ""hate"" each other, they get on each others nerves a lot and don't hang out.  But they work great together, they have great respect for each other and when it comes to the show they are always on the same page.  I tend to think Matsumoto and Hamada have the same relationship.  Also I don't know what is up but it seems as this sub has grown there are more and more of these Doomsday Cult people that keep bemoaning when GnT will end.  I wish more people would be chill and live in the moment more. THere will be another Batsu this year for sure.  They will let people know when it will be the final batsu prior to in order to get the most ratings."
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,Hashiru,5,Sat May 23 06:51:49 2015 UTC,"These guys are seriously experienced entertainers, especially Downtown.  You've got to remember they've been in the industry for many, many years, and they've also had a lot training and teaching on how to properly handle stress, humour and endurance.  So, while it probably does take some toll on them, they're far better equipped to handle it than we are.  They'll also know when to call it quits, and probably will when they're ready. I wouldn't worry too much."
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,Chodrick,6,Fri May 22 05:35:08 2015 UTC,"Hm honestly, I think it just shows how good Matsumoto is at putting on a straight face. To me it seemed quite obvious he was doing a sarcastic jab at Hamada, and the camera panning in on his death stare kind of cemented that they were doing a gag. If Hamada had said anything he might of laughed at the ensuing banter. He knows Matsumoto is trying to get a rise out of him.  Earlier in the batsu Matsumoto did a similar sarcastic routine to get a rise out of Hamada. He started saying he wished he could take Housei's place (whilst he was getting bare butt beatings) but that Hamada would never allow him to do such a thing because he cares so much as if it were his own life at stake. Of course Hamada's character role is more of the uncaring sort than the saint Matsumoto was playing him up as, and also as the boke of the Downtown duo, tsukkomi Hamada is more likely to be the one dealing out the beatings. But Matsumoto kept piling it on and the camera similarly zoned in on Hamada's reaction who was trying hard not to laugh.  Sometimes Matsumoto's steel-face breaks though at his own routine and he ends up being the one to get hit when he was actually aiming for the others to succumb to laughter. So naturally he will always say the others should get hit way more (most likely as a result of his acts).  As for the cast dreading the batsu each year, yeah for sure, but they really are amazingly dedicated to entertaining people. Housei in an interview about last year's Earth Defense:  Interviewer: That it was so tough on you will be exciting for the viewers.  Housei: “Oh, it’s like that is it.”, he laughs, “But you know I hate to admit, it pleases me all the more, oddly enough…”."
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Fri May 22 02:53:33 2015 UTC,"So I looked at that 17:15 part of the Prison Batsu.  First off the batsu game was still going on... No one can laugh, hence the tense faces.. The way I saw it Matsumoto was trying to get laughs from the rest of the cast so they could get batsu.  Matsumoto is the king of ""Wa-jutsu"" or technique of talking and his pace of speaking and the way he referred to Hamada was all dribbled out in such a way to get laughs (notice the audiance laughs).  I've seen some of his ""Free Talk"" where he rabbles on in the same way and Hamada will slap him on his head i.e. Tsukkomi.  The cast that were ""taken aback"" well, they were holding back their laughter.  Especially Endo because when he tries to hold back his laughter he looks up and tightens his lip which is what he did.  Now the Hamada shooting laser beams through his eyes.. You know what that was?  It was his TSUKKOMI!!!! bam, like that!  This is downtown and why they are so good.  They take a simple principle Boke + Tsukkomi and just do so many things with it.  You can even hear the audience laughing at his Tsukkomi.  So my take on it.  Another boke and tsukkomi by the tireless duo Downtown."
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,Hashiru,3,Sat May 23 06:48:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  That moment, when Fujiwara asks everyone for their opinion, is one of those ""What are your concluding remarks?  What was it like to take in this grand experience yet again?""  And we're expecting these cliched yet honest statements, like ""I'm tired but grateful for everything,"" or ""I'm speechless and thankful for everyone.  Happy New Year,"" and they've said these kinds of things previously.  And then suddenly Matsumoto enters this rambling, grumbling rant about himself and the others, especially Hamada.  That's the joke.  Going with the flow, the obvious thing is to give some nice remarks to conclude the show, but instead, he rambles and rants.    I'm actually the one who translated this portion, so I do feel responsible for the OP not getting the joke the first time he watched it, I'm glad that others here did get it.  I decided to translate it into English really deadpan because that's how Matsumoto delivers his lines.  Without the context and the audience laughs, even in Japanese, his delivery sounds like he's being serious.  What gives it away visually is the camera work and Hamada's death stare.  In the context of Gaki, that can only mean they're ad libbing some humor.    Anyway, yeah, Gaki on, people."
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,typesoshee,2,Sat May 23 10:40:53 2015 UTC,"On a previous post on /r/JapaneseGameShows or here on Gaki, a person asked about the likelihood of getting tickets to see a gameshow live.  The majority of comments indicated that its difficult for the average person to get tickets because audience members are actually paid professionals. That certainly explains why there is more predictable laughter, even when something's not funny.   Does Gaki hire budding tarentos to be in its audience or are they truly just very happy fans?"
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Sat May 23 10:32:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd take heresay with a grain of salt. Maybe some saw their advertisements to hire audience members as on-location extras for the batsu, e.g. some of the girls on the bus have been found to be gravure idols. I think it is indeed tough to get in the audience during the in-studio bits though since it's popular, the regular Gaki series talks (e.g. Costume Talk) are no longer filmed in front of an audience so it's the only chance to see them all together live (individually you can see them live on other shows / stages). Plus from what I hear you can't just call in and ask, gotta send fancy postcards and all that jazz."
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,kuela,2,Sat May 23 11:40:29 2015 UTC,"Matsumoto is always complaining about stuffs. Like even outside Batsu games. I remembered one Gaki video where they had to say nice stuffs instead of complaining and they had evidence clips to show the casts are really whiny. You can see Matsumoto.. Well.. Really complains a lot, about anything really. He's really fussy.. Even in Lincoln, the one with Ariyoshi especially.. Complains a lot.  Not to mention.. Matsumoto laughs easily.. Lol like, he would laugh at the slightest joke. Sometime he trapped himself"
GakiNoTsukai,36t8db,theRacistEuphemism,3,Fri May 22 09:48:04 2015 UTC,"I agree when people say things like this, we're reading more into it than the cast themselves would.  I think part of what Matsumoto says is emphasizing his character too. He's a pretty vocal and whiny boke, and he plays on being that character who can bring more humour, outrageous claims, and just stupid statements for a tsukkomi to work off of. It doesn't always have to end with a slap to the head. Plus, I think Matsumoto being the ""weakest"" or most targeted with pranks and cracking him up makes batsu games funnier. He tries to find the weirdest ways to hide or suppress his laughter, and they're hilarious. When he does laugh, his laughter is contagious. When he's hit, he gets more laughs with his griping. As a comedian, he's like a win/win (especially because it is) at his own expense.  As a young person, if I was subjected to a game like this as a job, no matter how many times I myself got hit, I would probably gripe about how little others got hit too, and we even see the other guys get away with unpunished laughs in the footage. If I had the chance to project that pettiness into a character, I would capitalize on that too. His closeness (in childhood and in work) with Hamada lets him say stuff like ""Hamada definitely should have been smacked more"". It's like two old friends who have known each other for 50 years sitting down to a cup of coffee and bickering about each other. In a way, it's pretty charming they have a history like that together.  Likewise, when he says stuff like ""this will be the last year"", as he has been doing for a few years now, while it does carry a grain of truth that they're not immortal and they're not as energetic or spry as they used to be when the batsu games started (especially the 24 hour ones), nothing yet has spelled a grand finale which I think they would do too. You don't create a culture like this around batsu games which I'm sure someone at Yoshimoto realizes reaches beyond Japan, and then fall off the face of the earth hinting it's because you got old. These guys are big time celebrities, their agency knows it too, so if something is ending, it's going to be an explosive goodbye. Stuff like Arashi replacing them, they're all just jokes - but they speak truth to say it can't go on forever."

GakiNoTsukai,36ejdw,Link408,6,Tue May 19 03:12:00 2015 UTC,Im also looking for that. Torrent should be the way to go. Resource friendly and the community could help each other.

GakiNoTsukai,369kxd,cossack_wannabe,13,Sun May 17 14:48:00 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, omiai isn't necessarily an arranged marriage, but rather is like an ""official set up,"" and can be set up by parents, friends, or a professional matchmaker, or even one side of the couple who is really interested in meeting/dating the other person.  The final decision is up to the couple itself (to veto, to date officially after that, or to marry - up to them).  (Unless we're talking real old school, like 100+ years ago, then maybe omiais were almost always de facto arranged marriages by the parents?)  People still do omiais today, and usually the purpose is to see if the two people want to openly/officially/seriously date afterwards.  Thus, the reason I call it an ""official set up.""  Notice even in Matsumoto's parents case, they married 6 months after they met through the omiai, so they were probably dating/engaged during that time (rather than getting married almost immediately after the omiai, which is more of what I would call an ""arranged marriage."")"

I think my Japanese has gotten a ridiculous amount of Kansai-influence because of this. Also, I'm sorry that I'm constantly joking around and derailing the Prison Batsu discussions with my shenanigans. (Jk, I'm not actually sorry...)  To the people of /r/GakiNoTsukai, you guys are a great community. Yes, there's a couple of haters, but hey, whatever, keep sippin' that Haterade, ain't even bothered. DTR Subs hopes to continue to bring you great entertainment, so we really appreciate all the support and love.

I don't know what their policy is in regards to the kind of work you do, but an automated way to donate a monthly amount would be convenient.  My SO and I frequently have friends over specifically to watch GnT, so I love and appreciate that you're working together on more videos. I am also looking forward to a big get together to watch this year's batsu one sitting. Good luck translating future videos, and thanks again!"

GakiNoTsukai,366g38,cookturkey,5,Sat May 16 16:45:28 2015 UTC,"It depends on what part of the batsus you mean. They're improvisational comedians (like Whose Line Is It Anyway) so there'll be many moments where they act out to get more of a laugh like when they troll each other. Also of course there's the long-running tsukkomi - boke dynamic, so sadist tsukkomi Hamada or them all picking on boke Housei plays to that tradition. But like on Whose Line, each person's personality does come through, Matsumoto has mentioned Housei is a bit of a natural boke/airhead at times backstage for example."
GakiNoTsukai,366g38,YamasakiGifsTumblr,5,Sat May 16 17:12:27 2015 UTC,"I believe it's a mixture of both. They combat one another to make eachother laugh so that they get hit mostly. You  could say they are being 'goofy' as a part of themself, but not entirely. This years batsu they had a gloomy mood and could not be as goofy due to some secrets being revealed, such as Hamadas affair, endos perverted of girls, Matsumotos father died and also the ageing doesnt help."
GakiNoTsukai,366g38,Morgow1,19,Sat May 16 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"Apparently Hamada and Matumodo don't even talk with or see each other outside of filming anymore.   Edit: I'm not just making stuff up, there was a little documentary style thing with an interview with them about their professional lives verses their personal lives, and since it had a more serious tone, they were basically ""out of character"" and mentioned that they don't exactly hang out or even talk outside of work anymore, didn't say there was any bad blood between them though.

GakiNoTsukai,366g38,dailyapple,3,Sat May 16 17:01:01 2015 UTC,Penn and Teller are the same way. There have been lots of great working relationships that aren't also personal relationships.
GakiNoTsukai,366g38,benserwa,3,Sat May 16 22:48:55 2015 UTC,Why people downvote you? There are several shows where Hamada flat out says they don't hangout outside of filming.
GakiNoTsukai,366g38,Le_Squish,10,Sat May 16 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"There should be no downvoting here.  But I think the thing is, this fact gets brought up as if it's some scandalous, defining truth about Downtown all the time.    Just think of it as a couple that's been married for 30 years at the top of their game.  They see each other, literally, every day, in TV studios and green rooms and meetings.  Even though they don't know about the ""external"" stuff going on in each other's lives, in terms of personality and psychology, they probably know each other like they know themselves.  It's like, there's nothing left for them to talk between each other because they're around each other so much already and deep down inside, they know each other so well.  My married-for-30-years analogy is that a couple like that will stop going on dates together because, well, you've been married for 30 years, do you really need to go on a Saturday-night date every week?  Surely, some old couples get comfortable enough that they don't do that anymore.    It's weird at first, but I also think it kind of makes sense.  Like, do Obama and Biden hang out a lot in their free time?  Remember how big Matsu and Hama are in terms of their show business power and lives, too.  It's sort of like if those two creators of South Park don't hang out with each other in their private lives anymore (I'm just using them as an analogy, I have no idea what their lives are like).  They see each other every day, working on work everyday.  Why the need to hang out even more outside of work?  I think ""alone time"" with your family or with your other colleagues as yourself (not ""Downtown"") becomes more precious to them."
GakiNoTsukai,366g38,typesoshee,3,Sat May 16 21:54:09 2015 UTC,"I have a friend I've known for 15 years and I barely ever see him, yet we always play games and have fun in the moment, when we get around to it. I think this is similar to how Hamada and Matsumoto interact."

GakiNoTsukai,366g38,Archaic44,2,Sun May 17 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"They're ""playing"" caricatures of themselves. Their personalities are all genuine but they over-react to everything for laughs and the sake of the joke. No different than in American stand up where comedians over-embellish their bits, the stories are probably made up but they fit in with their persona so it's believable and funny"
GakiNoTsukai,366g38,Poppyseed_Bagel,2,Sat May 16 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"They are being themselves, whilst perhaps exaggerating at times"
GakiNoTsukai,366g38,DownTown_Power,2,Sat May 16 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"I think they play to their comedic strengths. Their personality is what defines them as a comedian, and as a group they have this great variety and group dynamic because each one brings something different and interesting to the table. They are able to set each other up for slapstick funny, awkward funny, emotional funny, wit, puns/play on words, etc.  but their personas as comedians don't necesarily match their personal private personas.  An example of this:   Earth Defense Force Spoiler"
GakiNoTsukai,364217,spoonfedkyle,12,Fri May 15 23:03:12 2015 UTC,Anything is a dildo if you've got the right attitude.  The butt smacking instruments used in various no laughing games seem to be some sort of foam rubber baton.  About the size of a little league baseball bat.  I know in at least one of the earlier no laughing games they didn't use the spanking punishment as the default and instead shot them in the butt with a blow gun.

Not that it's against any ""rules"", but it's generally rude to be recruiting people from already established groups, rather than them reaching out to you on their own volition. It would not make Team Gaki happy, knowing you're trying to recruit their lead translator, whether he agrees to it or not.  Anyway, it's still up to you, but just be considerate to others and that consideration will be returned."

Shibatabread and Zurui had to leave the scene due to life commitments, so Alex/Slayeer reached out to collect together anyone who simply had the time to volunteer and pitch in for a segment, so even if life commitments came up, so long as there were volunteers the Gaki scene could keep going. Here's Team Gaki's original recruitment thread (Teachers batsu): http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4423  The following year (Earth Defense) there was a volunteer lull but Mickstar had quite a lot of free time to dedicate, so inevitably he was a psuedo-lead. Of course this year he hasn't had much time so again, the fact Team Gaki is a volunteer catch-all has helped since guys/gals like you have volunteered!

I cannot comment on any 'coincidences' other than to say they are coincidences and I hope TealMirror can maybe come forward and prove that I am not infact him or her.

GakiNoTsukai,360x09,CoastalCity,3,Fri May 15 08:33:26 2015 UTC,"I've been running panels for 5 years now, between several different conventions. The biggest thing I've learned is that you need to manage your timing more than anything. The last thing you want to do is run over your given time slot and affect someone else's panel. The only other thing I recommend is just relax and have fun with the panel! It might be nerve wrecking, but just go with the flow and enjoy it! People want to see what you have to present, and most of the time they won't be disappointed.   And, I've been running this game show as well since Anime Boston 2010: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzwwIaCYdUc  And now, because of my success with it, Funimation now sponsors it. =D"
GakiNoTsukai,360x09,Whittigo,2,Fri May 15 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"I second your question. Myself and two of my friends are thinking about running a Gaki panel as well. We figured start with basic stuff, silent library, 24 hour tag. Show clips of other segments like Kiki, explain the Boke and Tsukkomi relationship. Overall just get them interested in the members and the different formats the show comes in. No way to just show full length videos, just too much and not enough time."

GakiNoTsukai,360x09,Toyoka,2,Sat May 16 02:10:07 2015 UTC,"This. My first time watching a batsu (well, part of it) was on some website that had shown part of the high-school batsu game maybe 5 or 6 years ago; the part where Jimmy tries to count to 100. Ever since then I became addicted to the Gaki series (naturally, I hated Yamasaki when I first saw him in that clip :P) and had found my way over to places such as gakifiles.blogspot, shibatabread, etc. Hell, I didn't even know this subreddit existed until just a few minutes ago! So glad I came around. People are really missing a unique form of comedy. Once you get past the initial ""wtf"" stage and realize all the weird ""wtf Japan"" stuff you see on the internet is actually just an intentional form of this type of comedy, it's becomes much more appealing and interesting."

GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,basiltrecks,12,Thu May 14 19:41:34 2015 UTC,If you are completely serious about this and have considered all precautions. I suggest you contact Team gaki and get a full notice on what episodes they are planning to do. Team gaki consists of many different independent translators and typesetters but also groups such as tofupandafansubs. Charging money to continue with projects like this requires a very very precise agenda/manifest considering there are many groups translating gaki no tsukai as volonteers already. Meaning putting the pressure on fans whether we should donate with simple genuinity or to pay somebody in order to enjoy translated gaki content. With the drive of satisfying an ethusiastic and demanding fanbase.
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,Otviss,2,Thu May 14 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"Hi there Otviss. Yes, I am completely serious about this.   Team Gaki have only done a few episodes at best in the past 2 years safter the annual game and Tofu Panda are also not that active. I think people want episodes out on a weekly/fortnight basis and so I decided to start this group. If I am honest, I cannot see them doing any other videos after they finish this years game. I hugely respect them and all for there work but this is going to be a little bit different. I will contact them and see if any of them are interested.  I want people to be able to ask for vids and then get them quickly. It will help make Gaki more popular among more people."
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,Otviss,7,Thu May 14 19:58:18 2015 UTC,Edit: This used to be a comment expressing constructive criticism towards the idea.
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,N22-J,1 point,Thu May 14 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"I have a question regarding Japanese subbing. My GF enjoys Korean shows and I enjoy Japanese stuff. Unless it's anime, Japanese shows take FOREVER to get translated. It takes months for the batsu games to get translated (I understand you guys are doing this in your free time, thank you, by the way) while it takes a matter of hours before a Korean show like Running Man gets uploaded fully subbed. Is it simply a question of money and ressources?"
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,oolongxcha,3,Thu May 14 22:06:23 2015 UTC,"It's also a matter of demand. Running Man seems to have a bigger fan base with competition from legal services. Gaki no Tsukai is a much smaller community with an even smaller number of people who can volunteer their free time to do it.  I'm not sure of your background, but say if you had 5 hours of free time per day, how much of that time would you be willing to consistently dedicate to subbing without any compensation? Many people would be very reluctant to even do it at all.  It does take a long time, but it's hard to convince myself to consistently sub even just a few hours per weekend."
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,Otviss,2,Thu May 14 22:29:06 2015 UTC,"Since none of us get paid. It's simply impossible for it to be a matter of money or resources. Thanks for expressing a thank you, i am only 0.01% of the workforce.  Like i said it could be a case of bad/different managing. I mean all these individual groups. Shibatabread, tofupanda, TG, J-hive, Godzilla radio. I mean there are so many. All these groups have people that have been assigned to do typesetting or translation on their free time. When they have time. It shows that there are people who are very dedicated willing to do this voluntarily. As far as i am aware there is no one with a clear agenda such as.. Setting up deadlines. or... maybe distributing content to such an extent that the team knows they will be releasing something in a short time, quickly.  That's why I'm saying we might be looking for a change of management. But this also means so much more work! The previous and current concept is to gather fans that have the skills or want to acquire the skills to sub gaki no tsukai and other stuff.  And hey that's super cool. Korean and japanese dramas are very popular worldwide. They probably have more established group that sub episodes quickly. I wish we could establish such a group in the future!  It does take a long time! Only a typesetter or a translator would know. Maybe someone would like to share some thoughts about it to the community sometime. :) :)"
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,Otviss,1 point,Thu May 14 22:22:08 2015 UTC,"Hi Otviss,  First of all, please do not take this personally. I am not trying to compete with you. I am not a member of TG or TofuPanda, you are right. I am just trying to start my own group and whether we succeed or not, I do not see the need for a discussion. Everyone should just carry on as they were.   I just want to start a new team and a team who can regularly provide subs for the community."

GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,Otviss,1 point,Thu May 14 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"Hi Otviss,  I believe there are a number of subbing groups out there, there always has been. Team Gaki, DTR subs, Zurui, Shibatabread, J-Hive and other groups, so I do not understand the hate for what one more small group to join the community.   Our donations will also be for servers and what have you so there is no need to worry about this. I just want a team who is committed and as you said, not just disappear etc. I want people to really commit to helping me put videos out there. Unfortunately, I have never typesetted in my life before but I will be doing the translation myself.  I personally feel that you are not happy about another group emerging and therefore, am slightly confused. Let me translate videos so that people who do not understand Japanese can understand the brilliance that is Gaki.  Last of all, I have seen the donations Team Gaki receives and it seems that they receive a lot of donations, I may be wrong and apologies if I am, but I cannot believe a serve to cost as much as donations/sponsors/ads worth as they receive. I think you are also in it for profit and thus, I do not see your point.  Thank you."

The volunteers, who typeset/sub for TPFS and TeamGaki, are average people who sub/typeset on their own free time. Basiltrecks is trying to start a team that will run on a strict schedule, and will guarantee a video release whenever the ""budget"" of the job has been filled. I'm pretty sure that Basiltrecks will discuss with the other groups which episodes are being completed and which ones aren't so that there isn't any overlapping.  EDIT: Apparently I can't say ""Hi"" or ""thanks"" without people thinking I'm part of some conspiracy with Downtown Power."

My only comment that sort of goes off of what Otviss said would be that it'd be nice if existing sub groups can coordinate on what videos we plan to do and are working on because there's no point in overlapping, especially when there's a ton of unsubbed videos out there.  Sure, you're not required to, but no point in starting rivalries and subbing group wars for different business models/subbing approaches. And maybe we can lend each other a hand."

GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Thu May 14 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, just saying if there are certain things we can do to avoid any clashing, it should be considered. But just a simple message like, ""Hey, we were thinking of subbing [insert episode name here], just wanted to let you know,"" or if there's a webpage that lists your plans, it would probably suffice.  I'm already pretty busy with real life and I don't have much time left for subbing, even if it is for profit, which is why DTR works for me since I just sub when I have time. Thanks for the offer though."

GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,YamasakiGifsTumblr,5,Thu May 14 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"I would like to make this a professional operation. x amount of money for an episode. I am completely serious about this.    With this approach, I think it'd become self-sustainable if you could scope out how much licensing an episode of Gaki would cost, say a Kiki for example. http://www.ntv.co.jp/english/pc/index.html  Once licensed you could openly monetize your operation. For example, uploading subs to Youtube with partnership ads enabled (currently NTV take down such stuff) or running a Patreon. You could also set up a online stream with ads and subscriptions (ala Twitch, Crunchryoll etc.) Then the profits from that episode could go towards funding the next and so on.  It might be pricey to pay up front for a license though so if you can convince them to do a partner commission thing it'd probably be less costly. Also possibly less pricey if you specify digital distribution only (not physical). The batsus have a lot of copyrighted music in them so I imagine their licenses would be costly but an average Kiki episode just has classical music. I think NTV's main concern with online distribution is the fact people in the region of Japan also would have access (and so compete with their DVD/Bluray sales), sites like Crunchyroll have to region block to avoid paying higher licensing costs."
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,oolongxcha,6,Fri May 15 01:31:37 2015 UTC,"Not to try and shoot down the idea. But it's really unlikely that NTV will give licensing to even a big foreign company, and even less likely for just an individual. If they really want to look into the route of appealing to an international fanbase, they'd probably do it themselves and hire their own staff of subbers so that they can directly control the schedule, content, representations, etc.  That and Japanese corporations are VERY risk-averse. It's really such a huge shame since there's so much potential in the global market, but if it's not happening for variety shows that are very popular and have a larger international fan base, it will almost very certainly not happen for Gaki."
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,TealMirror,2,Fri May 15 03:47:19 2015 UTC,"Very true it would take some convincing perhaps. Though doing everything in-house is a lot more expensive, therefore more risk involved if there isn't a big enough profit return, companies frequently outsource to get things done.  Quote from a Crunchyroll interview:   At first, publishers were reluctant, and didn’t see the value in bringing shows online. When we first started, they doubted anime viewers would pay online to support the anime industry. Miraculously, TV Tokyo, the largest anime publisher in the world, accepted Crunchyroll’s offer.   NTV gave licensing rights to a big foreign company previously (MTV) and a small British studio (Roughcut TV) who made remakes and I would say did more to sully the representation of the series. xD  By retrospect plain vanilla subs of the unedited original content would be a far better representation. And in fact, NTV on their English licensing site acknowledge that it was one such fansub that got 3 million hits on Youtube that got them ""international success.""   If they considered that Youtube video an international success then they might consider becoming a Youtube MCN (Multi-channel network), which basically 'signs on' other channels and takes a cut of their profits. Some MCNs also set up their own websites to represent the content where they can manage its promotion. http://digiday.com/publishers/wtf-mcn/"

GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,VangardMk,2,Fri May 15 12:46:44 2015 UTC,"Same one as before: http://www.ntv.co.jp/english/pc/2011/02/61.html   After becoming a hit on the Internet through the power of viral video websites with more than 3 million hits on YouTube and many groups performing their own re-enactments, Silent Library has proven to be an international success."
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,FoldinBoxes,2,Fri May 15 14:23:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the poor job of the overseas version of Silent Library would make NTV not want to do it. Ruining it for everyone...  Thing about Crunchyroll is that they many series they feature already had American licensing. Once they gained more popularity, they were able to become more gutsy with selection. Anime in general has become super popular outside of Japan, so it was probably an easier battle. Variety shows, on the other hand, tend to require current cultural knowledge. Arashi's variety show is super popular, so that's sort of the benchmark in my mind. If Arashi gets subbed or at least licensed, then just maybe... (Though it should be the other way around. HAIL DOWNTOWN.)  I wish Japanese companies would be more open-minded though. It's so sad that so many good things that non-Japanese people love gets lost in the obscurity of the internet."

GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,Fritou,1 point,Fri May 15 15:26:51 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they're testing the waters with Australia before thinking about other options. If so, could mean something good, depending on progress. But I only know a few in America who watches any Japanese variety shows and even then, my Japanese friends only watch a little.  The other thing that concerns me that I forgot about is that Downtown has no interest in gaining international attention as a duo. They probably don't have a say in distribution, but it might cause tricky relations between TV network and Downtown if they insist on not taking their shows outside of Japan."
GakiNoTsukai,35zah7,drench42,1 point,Fri May 15 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately they kind of have to remain obscure on the internet until someone somewhere approaches NTV with an offer I think, since trying to promote Gaki on mainstream channels (e.g. Youtube) gets shot down due to the lack of licensing.  Maybe Matsumoto should make good on that joke he's been making about getting the Arashi guys to do a batsu haha."

GakiNoTsukai,35wr42,tiradical,2,Thu May 14 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"Edit: 14 days, sorry!  Earlier in the week I made a post about a shirt idea I wanted to make through Teespring. It's now up through the 5/27. There didn't seem to be much interest in my last thread, so the campaign minimum was set to a minimum. Hopefully with the actual shirt in picture, you guys will actually like the design.     I will not be making any money off of this campaign. It's not my intention. I could have my design printed locally and just for myself, but I wanted to give anyone here on this sub the opportunity to buy their own as well. The price of the shirt was set to the minimum amount, apparently $13, after the shirt material, image size, and Teespring fees were included.     I've bought from a Teespring campaign in the past, and was satisfied with the quality. The silk screened print hasn't faded on my other shirt yet, and AA shirts are always a good fit."

I've made a few non gaki related ringtones for my iPhone. As long as the sound clips are less than 30sec long they should work. When I get home I shall post the instructions - or if I get time I will convert a few gaki sounds for ringtones.   If I can work out notification tones I will do those too.

Hospital/Police batsu where 3 people are under anesthetic/dead. Hamada trying so hard not to enjoy it. I believe it was also there in Enthusiastic Teacher batsu in the Edo era but it was the other lady (the one Heipo insults in the hospital batsu). It's in the bonus features. The end of century heroes - 5 rangers. Hamada likes yelling at people. So they do ridiculous stuff for him to yell at. Hamada wants to yell but can't control his laughter. Lol.

Matsumoto travels abroad as a film director but from English interviews he's done I think he prefers not to play up his Japanese TV work as he finds it easier to be taken seriously as a film director outside Japan without the expectation of always being funny."

Celebrities and the public give raw reactions but that becomes boring, in Japan comedians are trained to react to things and then improvise on top of that rawness. The Gaki guys wrote the book on that and that's what we watch for. So it would make sense to license the originals and subtitle them, if distributing a subtitled show on TV is tough then online distribution would work (Youtube partnership, Netflix, Crunchyroll etc.), but I guess NTV was never approached with an offer like that."

If you read Japanese, here,    また、2012年まで調査を実施していた「子供に見せたくない番組」の調査では2008年から2011年までは4年連続でに上位にランク（2008年度・2009年度・2011年度は10位、2010年度は7位）していた   Gaki has ranked high in a survey called ""TV shows that you don't want to show your kids."" for many years.  I mean, that's not surprising.  There's plenty of naked dudes (with their private parts covered by some graphic, of course), scatological jokes, and sex jokes on Gaki.  They freely talk about people going to fuuzoku and implying cheating on SOs, too.  It's strange to try to differentiate Silent Library from Gaki, which the NTV English description is obviously doing.  Is Silent Library family-oriented?  Hmm, possibly.  But it's still shown at 11PM and the only way you would know what it is before you tuned into Gaki would be if you read up in your TV guide or whatever that they're doing a silent library this week.  If you're just watching Gaki on a random Sunday, it's quite likely that they'll be doing ""Matsumoto's Technician Challenge"" instead."
GakiNoTsukai,35jm30,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Mon May 11 21:50:43 2015 UTC,"Huh, you're right, I never paid close attention to their wording but that is very strange. In Japan Silent Library is a long-retired blip in Gaki's history.  It would maybe make a bit of sense if they said the ""New Years Specials"" since, even if they necessarily shouldn't, families do get together for that (Housei said he noticed more young-uns were watching it when he lived near a school and kids repeatedly ding-donged his door yelling ""Yamazaki Out!"" into the intercom before running off xD;; ) .  But of course they can't use the specials as an example since they were never licensed for English distribution sadly. I do wonder how much it costs to do that."

It cut right to the chase with the tongue twister that only Yamasaki got right...all dudes got chinko'ed and it was hilarious and bizarre...my first introduction to Gaki no Tsukai
GakiNoTsukai,35jm30,Radeon760,3,Mon May 11 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they are aware that they have international fans, but they aren't striving to become international ""stars"" or anything. They are holding the best position in Japanese entertainment and will try to keep it.   I'm not sure about western comedians, but they seem to know about western/US actors/singers at least. I guess they at least know some big name comedians, but don't follow that much."

Her public image is associated with Japan's kawaisa and decora culture centered in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo.  Her music is produced by musician Yasutaka Nakata of electronic music duo Capsule.  Kyary is well known for her iconic single, ""PonPonPon"" (2011), which made Japan's top ten. The singles ""Candy Candy"" and ""Fashion Monster"" (2012) followed the success. To date, she has since released three full-length albums, Pamyu Pamyu Revolution (2012), Nanda Collection (2013) and Pika Pika Fantajin (2014).  Though most of her success as a recording artist has been in Asia, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu has also gained popularity in western countries  due in part to internet videos which have gone viral. Media outlets have referred to Kyary as ""Harajuku Pop Princess"", and she has been photographed for magazines such as Dazed & Confused.  In 2013, Kyary signed a distribution deal with Sire Records to release her material in the United States.

Luckily for TG, the server had made a backup only 4 days ago, this backup was happily sitting on the Download server.  Why? No idea… however it didn’t help with the fact that as it’s a hosting server it’s never rebooted, if it was then a filesystem check would have been kicked in and probably fixed any problems.

The first is him from high school, he's shown it at one or two talk shows.  The second is him from the ""Ass Magic"" Gaki episode. The pic on the other link was his Yoshimoto agency image during the 90s or sometime like that.  He's said that when he was at high school he was quite popular for being the funny guy. People gave him the nickname ""kawakkoii"" or something (kawaii and kakkoii - cute and cool - cuool). When he first started out on TV he had a bit of an idol status for the same reason, received Valentine's chocolates from fans, but gradually as his comedy persona became more defined as the ""loser"" (hetare) he got zero chocolates. He turned it around a bit after watching a dog show where a likely-to-lose little pug dog fruitlessly acted confident against a big St Bernard. It inspired him to do stuff like Yamazaki vs Jimmy, Yamazaki vs Moriman etc. until he found a passion for rakugo in 2008. Though Housei vs Chono is still very much in that vein of the little underdog vs the big dog heh.  Personally I think the underdog element is endearing, but it seems the lowest rung in the industry in Japan. In the UK there's been quite a few hapless bumbling clowns that were highly popular e.g. Norman Wisdom (who called himself ""The Successful Failure"")."

Since he's always had a baby face, I'm not surprised to read that he was popular for his looks before he became such a ""hetare character,"" but I had no idea he was like... legit good-looking when he was younger (and slimmer).  I was also happy to read that it seems he got a portion of the profit made from the Moriman series.  (They always make fun of the fact that he doesn't have a lot of jobs outside of Gaki but pshhh, he's doing fine, heh.  I guess that's why they actually make fun of him for that though... if he wasn't doing fine, they probably wouldn't make fun of it.)"

Haha them making fun actually prompted me to look up his other work then I started the Tumblr. But of course the Gaki guys teasing him is still great, it's all in good fun since behind it all they're actually supportive of each other.  Since Housei moved to Osaka to be closer to his rakugo gigs, he's mainly on Kansai region TV these days. He seems friendly with a lot of people in the industry so he appears on Marco Polori, Kaiketsu Emi Channel, Kugizuke, Uramayo, Tokumori, Drive A Go Go etc.  His most regular gig is co-hosting alongside his rakugo teacher Tsukitei Happo and comedian friend Jinnai Tomonori a series interviewing Yoshimoto talents about their lives.  I did a (partial) amateur sub of some of it once.  Though also recently he's landed a regular spot on a Osaka-based chat and skit show as the comical policeman (pic)."

GakiNoTsukai,354yqi,typesoshee,2,Sun May 10 03:13:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I seem to have that one but I am looking for more from that show (I think year 2007 and earlier) as he might of done more funny stuff. (No.1 Comedian 今年も生だよ芸人集合 笑いっぱなし伝説 )  Here's some of the gag songs I've found, he did a lot of Monomane show stuff over the years that I'd love to find more of.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5ROfzXuthY&list=PLT86dzvZgwgn8X8U4ERS80ubYmMp0PiW4  And another someone posted on Youtube recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_1AVhWVjew"
GakiNoTsukai,354yqi,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Sun May 10 03:50:55 2015 UTC,"Hosei definitely has a strange sense of humor, in no small part due to the ""hetare"" and ""suberi"" comedy of his on Gaki that gets emphasized.  I think being around Matsumoto makes Hosei a lot funnier.  It's almost like Hosei is a boke's boke, in other words he needs Matsumoto to be his tsukkomi.  Without Matsumoto, Hosei's boke can just feel too strange (and without the follow through of a tsukkomi, can feel awkward).  And that's why I've felt Hosei often isn't able to realize his potential on other shows where Matsumoto can act as a foil.    But one thing he definitely excels at whether or not Matsumoto is there is impressions, so it's good to see him do those a lot on other shows."
GakiNoTsukai,354yqi,typesoshee,2,Sun May 10 04:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true. I will admit to cringing through some of his stranger stuff, like this ""comedy without words"" experiment he did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gvqgM-P_XY  Though I feel he would of done well in the silent comedy days since his humor is easy to understand through his facial expressions, slapstick moves, gestures etc. I just don't think he needs to try as hard as he sometimes does for that, but the ups and downs of the industry does push him to try hard.  I also cringe through some of his more creepy impressions (e.g. Gollum), but I can respect that he's prepared to make himself look ugly for the sake of a role, kind of like Johnny Depp. I think his female impressions are hilarious, the way he doesn't just dress up but also changes his way of speaking and mannerisms.  He started out as a boke in a duo (Team Zero era) but his partner decided to be a film director instead. It seems a lot of solo comedians in Japan resort to single gags, but Housei has always experimented a lot, sometimes to extremes that even I can't handle, but I respect the effort. Back when he first started he had a catchphrase ""Yay yay yay!"", people still remember it and even use it to impersonate him but he himself doesn't pull it out much.  You're right, he's a natural boke and I really do love the chemistry he has with Matsumoto. Honestly I think with Downtown it's like a boke love triangle haha. Hamada beats him down physically and Matsumoto cuts him down verbally. Though if you look at early years even Matsumoto would physically beat him down xD Matsumoto is a great match since he is able to keep a straight face when Housei is being ridiculous, Hamada can't help to show a bemused smile.  I enjoy watching him on other TV shows because due to his friendliness with others in the industry, they all feel like they can tsukkomi him. The host for Kugizuke/Emi Channel for example said she would beat his ass and he was like ""No please, I've had quite enough of that"" (not long after the batsu), or they'll just straight up slap him:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADcxoi5FkMk"
GakiNoTsukai,354yqi,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Sun May 10 13:19:07 2015 UTC,"I actually like his Gollum impression, but it's mixed up with his suberi comedy.  He overdoes the Gollum and it looks like he's trying to be funny doing it - somehow, it's that overdoing that makes it funny.  It's not pretty... but it's his style.    On some types of series though, I find him the funniest of the five, mainly the Kiki and Absolutely Tasty series.  It's especially his back-and-forth with Matsumoto during those episodes that I find him at his best (again, it's when Matsumoto is there that I feel Hosei is at his best).  But also, the thing that happens between him and Hamada during the chocolate Kiki is legendary to me."

I'm a fan of Housei (as can be seen by my Tumblr) so I also watch him on other TV shows, if you have a favourite from the cast maybe you can check out what else they've done.

GakiNoTsukai,343qu3,Braber02,10,Tue Apr 28 01:45:33 2015 UTC,TV is TV everywhere. I'm sure some of it is based on a genuine reaction but hamming it up for TV is universal :-)
GakiNoTsukai,343qu3,WilliamTellAll,6,Tue Apr 28 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"It is always possible that Heipo has been acting, or at least over-exaggerating his probably real phobia. But he has been like that on TV since when he was just a part of Gaki crews that showed up once in a while and his schtick hasn't been turned into sketches yet."
GakiNoTsukai,343qu3,rocky_iwata,5,Tue Apr 28 04:52:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's part real, part acting, but the acting isn't made out of thin air, but rather is an exaggeration of his eccentricities that Downtown finds funny.  Like, it's conceivable that the direction given to him when he's on camera is ""Say and act with your id with completely no inhibitions.  We'll probably find it funny, and then we can just go with the flow.""    Fun fact: Heipo's staff position (総合演出) I found translates to something like Supervising Producer Wikipedia.  Japanese descriptions say that it's a position above television directors, so he's actually pretty high up in the Gaki staff hierarchy.  I think it's something like executive producer, chief producer, 総合演出/supervising producer, producers and writers, then television directors, and then others (assistant directors (""AD""), crew).  Suga is one of the creators of the show, and Wikipedia has him as an executive producer, which sounds right, but I've heard him described as producer and chief producer on the show itself.  I'm guessing he started out as chief producer and then became executive producer later.    It's funny to see Heipo in the background in some of the earlier episodes, where he's seriously just looks like one of those staff guys in the background being mostly normal."

If you are talking about why did Fujiwara suddenly seems furious, I think it was a combination of mannerism (Japanese people are expected to show different manner and tone to seniority), he didn't know this is a prank (like other celebrity prank, he is probably invited to do some other things) so he is seriously preparing, and the agressiveness of the girl (in Asia culture, people tend to think kiss is only for someone thats really affectionate toward to), so he is probably a little worry and pissed that she is not taking the make up seriously. As for the end after the staffs explained the situation, he realize the girl is actually working (she was meant to prank him) and felt sorry that he got mad at her since she is part of the staff for this."

GakiNoTsukai,33ex4z,blindcolumn,11,Wed Apr 22 00:49:33 2015 UTC,That's actually a stylization for the kanji 日 from the word 日本 which is Nippon. So Nippon TV is shortened to Ni-Tere in Japan. So it's Ni-Tere Shop. :)

GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,EphemeralMemory,24,Wed Apr 15 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"They tend to remind people whenever they post an update (because there are tons of people who will remark on the length of time it's been since the last subbed video) that they all have their own lives. I think a bunch of them are students, and with that in mind, mid to late April and into May tends to be college/university students' exam and final project time. I know I'm hitting crunch time hardcore right now - having time for sleep is a luxury, much less type setting or subbing. I would expect it to be slow going at best for the next month or so, but perhaps once classes are over, a few of them will be able to kick it up a notch. There may or may not have been some personal life things too, and some parts got reassigned in the past.  The first few videos went fairly quickly I think because it happened during a slower and less busy time academically. I assume the page updates every 60 seconds in case there's a time where they go from all Translated to Final Check to FINISHED and people are just sitting and waiting at that page for an update."
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,theRacistEuphemism,9,Wed Apr 15 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"This I can understand. I'm a grad student, I get that. Can they just leave a sticky saying they are taking a break?   Anyway, I have other things to occupy my time. I may just watch the ones that have been released thus far."
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,imnotlegolas,2,Wed Apr 15 20:03:57 2015 UTC,"You know, I understand they do it technically for free and I have donated to them, but I wish there was away we could pay for the shows subbed and ready. I'd give a lot more for it too. It's so hard to be patient and waiting for them all to be done."
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,Hashiru,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:42:08 2015 UTC,I used to sub anime/manga and I wish I could be as gracious as the team that is subbing now and do it for free but with a day job my free time is more valuable.   So I got to thinking what would get someone like me and probably others to sub more and I thought about a GoFund me or Patreon type thing.  You could have each episode cost a certain amount of money to make that would equal to about $20.00 /hr for each person working on it.  There are about 17k people here so it might be doable if even 1/10th of those people donated like $5.00 for each episode.  I assume there are others out there that could translate but really subbing for free wouldn't be the choice of how we spend our 2~3 hours of free time every day.  However if we got like $20/hr or something like that I think a lot more people would be attracted to helping out.
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,imnotlegolas,3,Thu Apr 16 01:59:00 2015 UTC,"I just think the main issue is that they can't charge money for it because they don't own the show. Donating is a different story, there's not as many rules attached as when you're asking to fund them for doing it, if that makes sense."
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,saiferoth,2,Thu Apr 16 02:16:41 2015 UTC,Right. legally they are not allowed to charge for subbed videos unless i imagine its an .srt file only and even then thats iffy. Donations allow them to circumvent that because they are technically doing it for free.
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,Hashiru,2,Thu Apr 16 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"Ah didn't realize that.  Well that is unfortunate, subbing is very time consuming."
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to make it legal they would have to raise enough money to pay the license fee of NTV. No idea how much that is though. But it's basically what Crunchyroll do. They pay a fee per episode to the Japanese studio for the legal right to distribute it, translate/sub it and then stream it on their website, making back the money through ads and paid subscriptions."
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,Aluxh,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:06:29 2015 UTC,It's still profiteering from someone else's copyright though. It may not be explicitly illegal but I bet most fan sub groups don't have the funds to prove that in court.

""Please give donations to help me create more subtitles for Gaki No Tsukai, that show by NTV!""  <-- Not OK, since you're clearly asking for money for a specific service you're providing, which has to do with someone else's copyright.  Just wondering if you know anything more about this."
GakiNoTsukai,32pxz4,Nazgod,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:48:55 2015 UTC,"I think that wording does play a really big part in this (don't take my word as truth. I've only done the bare minimum in legal classes).  Because everything in law is based on words and how things are interpreted as long as you word things correctedly (Like your example above) then you should be totally in the clear. As long as there is no obvious exchange of goods or services (for example you giving translations only to people who've contributed money to you).  On the flip side, people are allowed to sell fanart under the creative commons license, so there may be a very slight possibility that selling translations are ok. Because the original content distributors don't provide a service to english speakers therefore you're just filling in a gap that they haven't covered. They are, after all, your words that came out of your mind. (But of course there are other copyright stuff that happens but I'm just talking about translations)"

Even sites like d-addicts have had issues after attracting too much attention. NTV is a major player equivalent to an NBC/ABC/CBS... even if they have no interest in ever airing the content in the US, they will protect their rights. See TBS going after ABC over seemingly trivial copying w/ Wipeout and getting a settlement. I'm sure they were more interested in the visibility of preventing copy-cats than they were with the pricetag of the settlement. Just because it's a Japanese company doesn't mean they have no legal standing in the United States.  That said, I doubt there'd be an issue with pay-for-subs so long as they're soft. That's purely derivative material and you're paying for translation services. The issue is that you'd have to time them to a source... and that's most likely going to be a pirated one because people just aren't going to pay $４00 for the DVDｓ and however much for hours of subtitles. http://search.rakuten.co.jp/search/mall/%E3%82%AC%E3%82%AD%E3%81%AE%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%84+DVD/CD%E3%83%BBDVD%E3%83%BB%E6%A5%BD%E5%99%A8-101240/max.43799-min.40900-p.1-s.1-sf.0-st.A-v.2?oid=059"

GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,jeboody,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:53:15 2015 UTC,I thought watching it after Hamada's Sleep Endurance would show off his sadistic side enough. Do you have an alternative?
GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,jeboody,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"I guess that's probably better than nothing. But there's just so much history behind Hamada and how he treats everyone on camera, at least for me I imagine it's kinda hard to really grasp that after just one GnT episode.  If you really want to show Kiss or Pie, maybe show it later? The earlier batsu games - particularly High School - showcase what Hamada will do if he's allowed to be his S self."
GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,solaceinrage,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:45:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I'll switch the order and do highschool then sleep endurance and end with kiss or pie.
GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,Otviss,3,Tue Apr 14 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"What has worked well for me so far are showing some of the segments with the desk drawers during batsu games, the reactions to Dynamite Shikoku and the pachinko machine clips from when Jimmy Onishi was still with the gang.   Actually anything with Jimmy seems to work splendidly, especially the reading and counting from the High School Batsu game."
GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,glemmstengal,2,Mon Apr 13 20:13:47 2015 UTC,Drink something nice and watch 24 hour tag. Universal humor. It has worked on my acquaintances!
GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,Ignitus,2,Mon Apr 13 19:50:26 2015 UTC,No Reaction! Pie Hell! is short enough to be a quick watch and gauge interest and is just funny as all hell
GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,jpxjpx,2,Tue Apr 14 02:13:13 2015 UTC,take it up a notch and make a batsu pain stick out of pipe insulation and a garden hose for the first guest that laughs

GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,CallMe_Dig_Baddy,2,Tue Apr 14 15:14:09 2015 UTC,the 24-hour tag game (2000) never failed to entertain any circle of friends.
GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,orkel2,2,Thu Apr 16 14:50:32 2015 UTC,Pie hell definitely. Anyone will find that hilarious even if they have no idea what the show is about

GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,salty_d0ge,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:33:47 2015 UTC,Start with something small like the 24 hour tag. Then move it up to where they'll understand the relationship between the members
GakiNoTsukai,32gvms,Butcherandom,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"Matsumoto's batsu at the haunted hotel is a good one. Lots of great laughs to be had with that one.    No laughing highschool Batsu is another good one (it's what got my wife and me into the series).    For a short, and it is indeed short, Wall of Boxes featured Matsumoto and Hamada way back when."

But you can tell that there is a substantial amount of authentic material, too, where the Five are truly shocked, surprised, and in side-splitting hysterics. I have in mind the DVDs of recent, the trial of Endo in the bushido court, the painful competitions from the other comedy crews, etc. I would LOVE to participate in a solid 24-hrs of joy, surprise, hilarity.  Such a wide range of emotions to experience would be the rich stuff of anecdotes for the rest of my life."

GakiNoTsukai,31t4pj,kanguen,2,Tue Apr 7 23:46:16 2015 UTC,Have you seen it?   Is this the type of movie where you need to understand the language to get the humor? or are there subs out there?  Thanks a bunch for responding.
GakiNoTsukai,31t4pj,babaganoushka,3,Wed Apr 8 00:11:31 2015 UTC,The humor was great and the message was universal.   I thought it was a poignant film and really delved into the mind that is Matsumoto. It was an incredibly endearing and mature film.
GakiNoTsukai,31t4pj,Carmen-,3,Wed Apr 8 00:33:55 2015 UTC,I thought Symbol was pretty entertaining but odd. There isn't that much dialogue in it and it is available for download with subtitles here (Scroll down a bit).

GakiNoTsukai,31t4pj,Urban_Scroff,3,Wed Apr 8 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"There is a documentary about Matsumoto and how his humor is more absurd than what we see in his skits and series with Hamada, Tanaka, Endo, and Hosei (Yamasaki). These movies are different than the typical Matsumoto appearances since he really gets to show his true style of humor.  I believe he mentioned that he panders to popular humor in most other media (what we typically see).   I haven't made it through a whole movie of his since I guess I have a lame sense of humor and prefer the pieces that pander to me."

On a spectrum: I guess his movies are all out ""Matsumoto-style"" absurdity (or the Japanese term ""surreal""/""シュール""), then his Gottsu skits (half absurd/surreal, half more easy-to-get humor IMO), then Gaki (very self-aware humor and lots of parodies, but very little of it is surreal), then most of his other stuff on TV (popular humor), and finally the most ""realist"" or non-surreal humor would probably be his talk show stuff (Downtown DX, Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ).    I saw Big Man Japan and was like, eh.  I might have to see it again but then I might regret it, because I remember it was just too slow.  Even the average Gottsu skit is pretty weird for me, although some are amazing.  Gaki, I can't get enough.  Downtown DX and Hey Hey Hey though, definitely can be too tame or mundane to be called ""authentic Downtown"" IMO."
GakiNoTsukai,31t4pj,Urban_Scroff,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:43:13 2015 UTC,I believe the documentary at one point mentioned that he uses his movies as an outlet for his true style of humor that he suppresses in his other undertakings. To me that sounded like he panders to popular culture for most of his work. Give the audience what they love.

GakiNoTsukai,31insd,Paiste402,19,Sun Apr 5 13:34:14 2015 UTC,"""Gaki no Tsukai"" as others have translated literally means ""No task for kids"".  However this phrase is part of an idiom used in Osaka (where Downtown is from).  It is something that bill collectors use to say.    [Japanese] ""ガキの使いやあらへんで, 手ぶらで帰れるか"" [Pronounce] Gaki no tsukai ya arahende, tebura de kaereru ka [Translation] ""This isn't like an errand you give a kid, I can't come home empty handed"" Meaning when they go to collect a bill they can't come home w/o payment.   So the real translation would be ""Downtown's This Ain't a Kids Errands"" or something of that nature to reflect the idiom that it comes from."
GakiNoTsukai,31insd,Hashiru,9,Sun Apr 5 20:20:15 2015 UTC,"If you read Japanese, here are some similar explanations:   http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1314211578  http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1322134443  A ""gaki no tsukai/kid's errand job"" is when you send a kid to get something, and if they're told by the other party ""We don't have that,"" the kid just comes home and says ""They didn't have that,"" instead of trying harder, going to another store, looking for an alternative solution, etc.  So ""Gaki no tsukai ya arahende"" = ""I'm not doing a kid's errand job here, so I'm not going back empty-handed.  You're not going to be able to brush me off like a kid who doesn't know what he's doing.  I'm here to do the errand that I've been tasked to do.""    From the Japanese wikipedia page of gaki:   タイトルの由来は、『恋々!!ときめき倶楽部』の中で松本が出演者に対し「お父さんもガキの使いやないんやから…」と発したことから。後に放送された特番では、浜田が素人のおじさんに「いやいや、それでは済まさん。こっちもガキの使いやないんやから…」と言ったシーンが流され、これが由来だと説明されている[4][5]。   ""The origin of the title is when on the show 'Koi Koi Tokimeki Kurabu'  Matsumoto said to a participant, 'Pops, you're not doing a kid's errand so...'  On a later special, a scene was shown where Hamada says to a common man [someone not in show business, for example someone they interviewed on the street] 'No, no, that won't do.  We're not doing a kid's errand here...'  It has been explained that this is the origin of the title[4][5]."""
GakiNoTsukai,31insd,typesoshee,10,Sun Apr 5 23:17:04 2015 UTC,Gah-key no tsoo-kai yah ahrah-henday. The T in Tsu is pronounced. All syllables are given the same amount of emphasis.  Edit: You can hear Heipo say it clearer than Hamada in the intro to this episode.
GakiNoTsukai,31insd,cynicsymmetry,5,Sun Apr 5 14:06:11 2015 UTC,ah man Heipo is adorable.
GakiNoTsukai,31insd,Monckey100,3,Sun Apr 5 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"The correct pronunciation has already been stated but for future reference when pronouncing things from japan other than a i u e o which are used to extend a syllable, and n is used to end it, their whole alphabet system consists of just syllables rather than individual sounds, and since they have no letter L, this is why it's hard for them to pronounce some English words."
GakiNoTsukai,31insd,Lextube,2,Sun Apr 5 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"General thing to remember when reading anything Japanese, never see it as a whole word that must be pronounced in some way. Like ""Akabane"" you may read as ""Acker bayn"", when it's actually just a collection of syllables. A ka ba ne. To know how to properly say these vowels, check out this video.   This is all there is to it with Japanese really. From then on it's just a combination of consonants and vowels to make certain types of syllables. Here are a selection of different syllables you can have in Japanese to give you an idea. a - ka - kaa - kka - kya - n. These are a single vowel (a), a single consonant and vowel syllable (ka), an extended vowel version(kaa), a harder / extended consonant version(kka), like the consonant and vowel but with a y in the middle (kya), and then the only consonant that can be on it's own (n).  No idea if that's helped or confused, hopefully helped haha."

GakiNoTsukai,319d60,Braber02,13,Fri Apr 3 01:10:51 2015 UTC,I don't mind the current annual format What I would like to see is for them to bring back sleeping in the batsu games so it really does become a whole 24 hours (instead of just ending it late at night) Also I've always found the whole run-away-while-being-chased-and-explosion at the end kind of excessive and pointless
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,Darbon,7,Fri Apr 3 13:05:30 2015 UTC,"are we talking the annual ones or the regular occasional happened ones?  If you are talking about the annual one, i agree. Although its inevitable because:  1/ They all getting old so they cant do things too extreme.  2/ They find an optimized formula to squeeze out as much contents as possible and including as much celebrities. In a sense its no longer a Gaki exclusive event but they also about other entertainment partners of their as well. Its about Contents x Advertising x Partnership / (Effort x Cost)."
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,uw_NB,6,Fri Apr 3 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"I read in a interview with Housei that Matsumoto's original idea for the Don't Laugh series would be for it to bring together different entertainers including celebrities who don't tend to appear on the same shows as comedians. So I think it's actually now closer to his vision, when the big celeb is revealed he sometimes says ""What are you doing on a show like this?""   ""It was always the case that in all variety shows the comedians amused people, but in the ""Do Not Laugh"" series the tables turned and it was not just them but people from all different categories of entertainment appearing, even to make the comedians themselves laugh! That’s Downtown’s amazing invention."", Hōsei raves on the innovativeness of the project, then remembering the initial planning further, ""Many years ago back then, Matsumoto-san muttered it and it was eye-opening for everyone who was there, in an instant the change to the typical balance was born."", he says with amazement.   http://yamasakigifs.tumblr.com/post/70912307361/interview-with-tsukitei-hosei-on-the-chono-face"
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,YamasakiGifsTumblr,6,Fri Apr 3 03:13:14 2015 UTC,My point exactly... may be its just me but sometimes i watch a gag and see the 5 gaki guys didnt like it as much but they laughed anyway. Later on i figured they did it to keep good relationship with the performer since he/her could be a big name in entertainment industry that you dont want to offend(him/her or their fans).
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,uw_NB,2,Fri Apr 3 03:26:21 2015 UTC,"Well, it is kind of up in the air as it's easy to read into things. Pretty much every reaction they make gets labeled as fake e.g. Tanaka's falling over. There's no real way to prove otherwise, for example the Gaki guys state the beatings hurt, people don't believe them, in Japan Housei said he gets asked that and his answer is ""Of course it does.""  The thing is we may not find it funny because we aren't familiar with that celebrity but for those in Japan and the Gaki guys, it may be hilarious just to see a particular celebrity do something you wouldn't normally expect of them. Over here we have stuff like Comic Relief and when celebrities get involved it can be pretty funny, I did have a laugh at Johnny Depp with Dawn French back in the day. The Gaki guys may also be laughing out of surprise that such a hotshot would be on a comical variety show, like I say Matsumoto especially seems to get a real kick out of it. Or if they didn't think the celeb was that funny, that awkward air may also cause them to laugh at how the celeb would embarrass themself in such a way. Again though, it's just all opinion without a way to prove it, reading into it in different ways."
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Fri Apr 3 12:24:18 2015 UTC,I think it was the hospital one when a couple gags failed completely and nobody was laughing and it was not a pleasant viewing experience. Things don't have to be so cynical.
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,decayingteeth,5,Fri Apr 3 12:26:58 2015 UTC,"Last year (EDF) was kinda meh outside of Tanaka's DVD. It seems the best parts recently have been them interacting with each other and getting each other punished with the props they get from the drawers.  The skits have gotten stale because they've become too formulaic and predictable (though Hosei did a pretty good job of taking his encounter with Chono to a different direction this year IMO.) The only thing I'd like them to keep is the part where the comedians get together to gossip, but they need to switch things up."
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,cliveybear,2,Sat Apr 4 09:01:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with this... it's sad! It's not even the comedians - when they banter it's hilarious. The planning just isn't original enough.  My favorite game is that one where they have to sing a song about a random food to a certain tune. That's always incredibly funny. I think they need to change it up big time, too."
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,ctrl_shft_n,7,Mon Apr 6 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"Konya ga yamada? That was hilarious, but I think if they did some of these a lot they would stop being funny. Wouldn't you think if they brought that gag back randomly it would have more punch than if they did it regularly?   At any rate, I'm loving the current Batsu game."
GakiNoTsukai,319d60,Jonesgrieves,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:26:27 2015 UTC,"I thought the last one was very slow... spoiler do we have to see them crawl to see some person sitting on a toilet three times! The entire crawl? Even the 5 of them seemed bored.  I feel the one at the Onsen, where Matsumoto and Tanaka were running the show, was the best. Today's are boring because the geniuses aren't the ones coming up with the jokes.  I like when they banter amongst each other, or turn on each other, or deal with truly random things. Today's shows are all spectacle... it's inevitable, they've grown up... there has to be some younger Japanese comedians carrying to the torch but I haven't found them yet.  I like the banter in Shabekuri 007 a ton, horiken is amazing to me."

GakiNoTsukai,30sjok,SeveOJ,1 point,Mon Mar 30 10:52:03 2015 UTC,You should see the other ones. I don't think one has been subbed at this point but they do one per year since 2002. My flair is from one of the years actually. Him tackling Matsumoto gets me every episode.
GakiNoTsukai,30sjok,DatCheesus,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"It's one of the few ""sketches"" that is still hilarious without subs. His faces alone are redonk."

GakiNoTsukai,30sjok,chicawazza,13,Mon Mar 30 11:19:48 2015 UTC,No its just bit which they do every year.

Just a suggestion, but I still don't understand why is uploading Part X subs more important than full file subs. People have the full file and then just download the subs in a second and go watch, but downloading Part X + subs takes forever, so it's just faster/better to watch or download a low quality stream. Seems more important to have full subs than part subs up first. Just seems like a weird decision to me, that's all. Thanks again tho :)"
GakiNoTsukai,30pw9v,BurntJoint,8,Sun Mar 29 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"I dont normally upload them, but i have been adding each sub file together so that is all correctly timed for all of the parts that have been released so far, so you can watch the first 7 parts together.

GakiNoTsukai,30pw9v,xn0,1 point,Mon Mar 30 10:39:26 2015 UTC,I guess Matsumoto was parodying his own behaviour as a director on set. It was funny to see how straight he acted it out.

GakiNoTsukai,30iibn,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Sat Mar 28 17:59:35 2015 UTC,"I think Tanaka was just playing along with his comical tantrum. Matsumoto bigged himself up to be ""first-rate"" skills-wise, so when he calls them ""third-rate"" Tanaka retorts that the Kiki was set up exactly because they'd considered him ""first-rate"" (even if he did turn out otherwise). That was just how I read your translation though, I think you did a great job."

GakiNoTsukai,30dlzn,Rancid_Bear_Meat,14,Thu Mar 26 18:33:22 2015 UTC,There's not a ton of dialogue. Mostly just explaining how much of a senpai each person is and this is such a bad idea. Tanaka asks them stupid questions like what is your favorite sport or hobby or who is your dad and mom and then gets mad at them for no reason.   The Thai kick alarm is super random and usually has no connection to what they said.  Obviously each guest was told something completely different about what they were gonna be doing and are surprised that tanaka is using such rude language to them.  The gaki guys are razzing tanaka the whole time about whether or not he will apologize to each person afterwards. Which... spoiler   Of course he does.

GakiNoTsukai,30akwu,SailorDeath,17,Wed Mar 25 20:37:08 2015 UTC,I doubt it since the videos have borders around them to try and prevent copyright take downs.
GakiNoTsukai,30akwu,returnf1re,2,Wed Mar 25 20:42:55 2015 UTC,And I doubt the official channel would subscribe to random other ones.
GakiNoTsukai,30akwu,derpaherpa,0,Thu Mar 26 00:14:02 2015 UTC,I'd think the same too but I've seen some famous people/groups subscribe to channels that do fan videos.  Hell Weird Al has a page dedicated to listing all fan made music videos using his songs.
GakiNoTsukai,30akwu,YamasakiGifsTumblr,10,Thu Mar 26 13:13:35 2015 UTC,"Nope, there's quite a lot of these channels lately popping up and spamming a load of videos taken from other sources before being closed by copyright strikes. Even reposted some of my own sub videos (I post under the name Moon Pin for subs, Yamazaki Housei for raws)."
GakiNoTsukai,30akwu,lazy_mushroom,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"And if there ever will be an official GnT channel (0.01% chance), it'll be written with kanji with videos without borders."
GakiNoTsukai,30akwu,Kitakaze_Punch,1 point,Tue Mar 31 07:37:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything about an official Downtown youtube channel. Yoshimoto Kogyo has their own channel, but I haven't seen anything from Downtown on there (mainly younger comedians).  The closest you'd get to something official is Nihon Terebi putting the Gaki no Tsukai batsu games on their NTT On Demand service but it's probably of little interest to people outside Japan."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,TShizz,33,Tue Mar 24 21:02:19 2015 UTC,Yes. Absolutely. But I think content would determine the price. A best-of would probably rate $15US for me. I'd probably pay more to get certain batsu games or an entire collection of similar bits like the cooking ones.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Ar_Ciel,13,Tue Mar 24 21:22:08 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on price, in Japan each Gaki DVD is very expensive as is the norm, but in all honesty that probably wouldn't go over well here where there are budget boxset releases for shows and NTV would probably pull out pretty quick once they didn't see enough profit.  I heard Netflix is trying to set up a base in Japan, would be interesting to see if more Japanese shows could come over to UK/US Netflix etc. In the UK a lot of TV is accessible via online on-demand services supported by ads or the TV license fee (e.g. BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, 4onDemand etc.) so I think releasing them online would be a good idea.  On Twitch it's pretty easy to watch streams for free but people disable their ad blockers or pay to subscribe to support certain streams. I'd foresee the same happening with an official NTV-backed Gaki stream. But sadly it doesn't seem like NTV feel it's profitable enough to invest in the foreign market. When the Silent Library fansub exploded on Youtube they mainly just sold licensing permission for people to make remakes abroad."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,YamasakiGifsTumblr,9,Tue Mar 24 21:43:18 2015 UTC,Crunchyroll might also be a good place for it as they've already got a willing market for Japanese media.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Ar_Ciel,5,Tue Mar 24 23:38:13 2015 UTC,"Except that Crunchyroll already has problems translating jokes and puns in anime, there is no way they would do a good job with Gaki no Tsukai."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,insectsareawesome,2,Wed Mar 25 13:43:17 2015 UTC,"Ah I didn't realize Crunchyroll did other shows outside anime, cool then yeah that's another potential one."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Wed Mar 25 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"I also think I read somewhere that Matsumoto is actually against releasing it in the US. It may have been part of a belief that the cultures and humors of our peoples are too different, but my memory's pretty vague on it. He did make an effort to make some comedy just for Western audiences and talked some about how much of Big Man Japan wouldn't be appreciated culturally outside of Japan."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,MegalomaniacHack,4,Wed Mar 25 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"I've read he finds it easier being a film director outside Japan where he is expected to be a comedian first and foremost so I wouldn't be surprised if he was apprehensive about becoming more known as a comedian here.   How do you think your work is perceived in different parts of the world? I think that in Japan, because I'm really famous as a comedian, in a way it's a bit difficult when I make films. They're always seen in the background, on the side of my other activities. In other countries, I'm more appreciated as a film director, it's not just a background thing. So it's completely different.  Source: Indiewire   They also happen to mention Big Man Japan was well-received in America though."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,YamasakiGifsTumblr,4,Wed Mar 25 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard that one before but he is pretty aware of how other cultures wouldn't be able to understand Japanese comedy.   I would be surprised if he was against releasing anything anywhere because he doesn't seem to dislike having his work viewed by international people.  I think his main concern is if the words are being translated correctly.  There was an American TV show that interviewed the GnT team during one of their Costume Talk episodes.  The American Host said her brother watched the show and when they asked which ones he liked she named silent library and others.  His response was ""Oh that makes sense, its the physical ones where you don't need to understand the dialogue."""
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Hashiru,3,Wed Mar 25 05:39:22 2015 UTC,"Well it does make sense really that the physical stuff would be more accessible, we've said similar stuff ourselves on here, so I don't think that means he is against translations. The American guest didn't really stress fan translations (probably just as well on the set of NTV with their copyright lawyers watching heh).  I don't think they mentioned Kiki either which, whilst having the physical element of punishments in it, does highlight their verbal banter. They may not of mentioned the yearly effort to translate the specials (batsus) either though they do know they're watched abroad. On an episode of Downtown DX a comedian mentioned going to Italy and being asked repeatedly if he knew Housei from watching the specials.  Ultimately I don't think Matsumoto would be against anything that helps people to laugh, but he might be apprehensive about his comedy work becoming big abroad as he seems to like to use it as an escape from Japan where everything he does is expected to be comedy-based."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,YamasakiGifsTumblr,10,Wed Mar 25 12:03:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, in a heartbeat. I wish OP were doing market research for NTV, actually."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,B_i_llt_etleyyyyyy,9,Tue Mar 24 21:50:15 2015 UTC,Hell yes. I'd pay $40 AUS per DVD if I had to.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,ch0ding,7,Tue Mar 24 21:45:17 2015 UTC,sometimes i wish i was a really rich guy with millions to spare. i imagine that i would give some guy millions of dollars to sub every single gaki content out there and it would not feel like callous spending.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,birdatlaw,4,Wed Mar 25 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"If you had millions a better idea would probably be to pay whatever licensing fee NTV has for Gaki episodes / specials, pay the translators and stream the results on a website. That's basically what sites like Chrunchyroll do (and then they get money back via ads and subscriptions but I guess if you were a millionaire you could donate it to some charity). drifts away on a dream cloud"
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,YamasakiGifsTumblr,7,Wed Mar 25 01:43:19 2015 UTC,I would pay obscene prices if all seasons were subbed on DVD...
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,p00f4c3,6,Wed Mar 25 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"I'd pay hundreds just to get new subs, mainly Lincoln.   It would be cool if a team of dedicated subbers started subbing almost full time through Patreon or Kickstarter. I'm sure many people would pay for that. Also probably japan wouldn't mind/know."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,ozmelk,7,Tue Mar 24 22:03:40 2015 UTC,Japan just took down dozens of US sites that cataloged fan subbed anime. So Japan might care.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Neosovereign,4,Tue Mar 24 23:13:07 2015 UTC,"But a lot of fab subbed anime are licensed  in America or in any other country than Japan. Much more than Gaki, which is not licensed at all outside Japan. They care about what makes the licensee mad, not because they are losing money..."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Morialkar,3,Wed Mar 25 04:44:21 2015 UTC,That is why I said Japan might care. They may not. Did you even read my response? ;P
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Neosovereign,2,Wed Mar 25 04:59:43 2015 UTC,I hear what you are saying but please just consider  that Japan might care
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Bengosha87,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:39:47 2015 UTC,"Japan doesn't care; look at how many IP's people outside of Japan clamor for (Anime, Manga, Sentai, Variety Shows, etc.) and very few either are released, or a shitty ""localized"" version is offered. The companies want to keep their profit making models viable, and are content with serving the local markets; the minute they release outside of this, the profit margins will go down fast."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,cesariojpn,5,Wed Mar 25 09:45:48 2015 UTC,Without a doubt! I would pay over the odds for it as well!
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Gimlis_bottom_bitch,5,Tue Mar 24 22:33:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd pay approx $3.50 per hour of Batsu collection for DVD. I'd like it release as an box set though...like all 24-hr batsus for $150, for example. I'd only pay for it if was legit, though.  I think they have a massive library of stuff for Downtown that they could release in the US. They'd be better off trying to find a cable partner like G4 or Adult Swim to air the batsus on weekends or holiday marathons."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,cossack_wannabe,4,Wed Mar 25 00:30:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I would totally pay. Especially for those older, too fuzzy videos only found in YouTube at like 240p."

GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,GussyH,5,Thu Mar 26 10:52:09 2015 UTC,"I would prefer online subscription but i would expect: - Just eng subs, no Jap subs cluttering the screen, maybe with an option to view subs as Eng, Jap or Both. - HD 1080p, 720p would also be okay, def NOT DVD quality! - Fast delivery, weeks after release, not months. - Would be interested in also being able to pay for other Downtown content."

GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Hougaiidesu,3,Tue Mar 24 23:50:51 2015 UTC,"I would prefer an online streaming service like CrunchyRoll. I'll add, I am so over watching tiny youtube videos so I'd jump on Gaki being streamed in high quality.  I think the cheapest for customers would be a streaming service."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Hashiru,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:10:36 2015 UTC,I think the cheapest would be a box-set or individual episodes released on blu-ray and dvd.  Not to mention you would be able to watch it if the internet went down for whatever reason. And what better time to watch than during an internet outage?  Which happens with surprising frequency where I live.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,serosis,2,Sun Mar 29 06:52:01 2015 UTC,"I think it would be cheaper because: a) That is the direction media content is going.  b) You don't have to sub to Crunchyroll, only need sub for Ad free HD content so it would actually be free for most who don't care...  c) I would assume it is easier for CrunchyRoll to add GnT to their list of content because we have 17k subscribers and if 1/4 of us subscribed for $60.00 a year that would be $255,000 a year.  Not to mention the ad revenue they would get from the other 12750 people that watched GnT.  To me that sounds pretty profitable but I guess I would like to see Crunchyrolls take on it."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Hashiru,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:04:14 2015 UTC,"Do not mind me. I am just bitter that I do not have constant internet access. I feel left out.  But still, I would love to have DVD or Blu-Ray box-sets so that I could just have a sit and watch.  I think a GnT box-set could possibly beat out the Star Wars saga in price, and I would rather take GnT over Star Wars. Crazy as that may be.  CrunchyRoll would be great for on-the-go watching, but I am set in my old ways of just reading a book while travelling. And if I wanted to take GnT with me I would just transcode it to whatever device I am going to watch it on."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,serosis,3,Tue Mar 31 02:19:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd love to add them to my blu ray/dvd collection. No other comedians have made me laugh as hard as they do. I'd pay $30-$45 each. I already have all but the last two batsu's downloaded, but would love an actual disc & cover."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,xstohl,3,Wed Mar 25 05:31:54 2015 UTC,Yes. Pay.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,Kattenkut,2,Wed Mar 25 07:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd definitely get a No-Laughing Batsu Game collection. But because I live in the UK, get trolled by the price, because the licensing people suck."

GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,ProjectMirai,2,Wed Mar 25 13:22:36 2015 UTC,"As a Canadian, there's very little ways to directly support shows like these. Even if it were massively overpriced, and it'd sit on the shelf collecting dust, it'd be worth it for all the laughs it's provided over the years."
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,The_Angry_Clown,2,Wed Mar 25 15:50:04 2015 UTC,Absolutely. $15-$20 for a complilation of Downtown episodes (maybe 13-15?). $30 for a batsu DVD. I'm always in tears from watching them.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,syruup,2,Wed Mar 25 19:20:54 2015 UTC,I'd buy them. The price would obviously depend on how much content there is but I'd drop about 20-50 dollars on it.
GakiNoTsukai,306ckw,bigfatround0,4,Wed Mar 25 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"i would pay around 30, sure beats waiting a damn year for a 4h video to get subbed."

I'm a translator working with Team Gaki, and I hate to break it to you:   The DVD for the Enthusiastic Teacher's batsu was released on November 27, 2013 (Japanese Wiki link) and for the Earth Defense Force batsu was released on December 3, 2014 (Japanese link).  And Team Gaki in the recent past seems to sub the 6 hour episodes in 3-5 months.  So there you go."

GakiNoTsukai,2zp8vd,zombiexm,1 point,Mon Mar 23 08:57:53 2015 UTC,To get everything to line up perfectly you would have to constantly resize the text most people don't even understand the written Japanese so if it overlaps (for me personally) i don't bother to change it as more often then not that text well be something that is translated anyway. In short you aren't missing much and if you don't read Japanese and just find it hard to read the text black outline is the usual solution.
GakiNoTsukai,2zp8vd,tendesu,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:27:57 2015 UTC,No I'm not complaining about not being able to read the original text as I only understand a little jap but the translation a bit harder to read if the original text is green then translation is then same or slightly off color with outlines. Nothing major
GakiNoTsukai,2zp8vd,BootsLikeMafia,2,Tue Mar 24 02:54:40 2015 UTC,Also i forgot to mention that the main gaki cast has a color code (at least for team gaki vids and tofupanda stuff) So there is that too.

Chiki Chiki Tricycle Marathon Race"" which borrowed the ""chiki chiki"" portion of the title from an American cartoon called Wacky Races but whose name in Japanese was translated as チキチキマシン猛レース (""Chiki Chiki Machine Intense Race"").

GakiNoTsukai,2ym0lq,typesoshee,12,Wed Mar 11 04:49:30 2015 UTC,"Japanese hierarchy of seniority affects speech too; since Yamazaki is a junior to Matsumoto and Hamada in both age and comedic career, he should be using the polite version of Japanese speech, however the card let him speak to them in a casual way. Imagine asking an old person for a light and going ""hey asshole, got a goddamn light?"" Of course, when you get more familiar with each other, impolite speech is seen as more casual. For example, Yamazaki apparently talks to Matsumoto using casual Japanese speech when they're having a night out, but if he was to talk to Matsumoto using casual speech in a situation with other people he knows it would be seen as rude.   The part where his free speech card was about to run out was pretty subtle; just before it ran out he was asking Downtown to look at the baby by saying ""miro"", which is the impolite/rude term for ""look"". The second the card ran out he started using ""mitekudasaiyo"", which is quite a polite way of saying ""look""."
GakiNoTsukai,2ym0lq,MeisterEder,2,Wed Mar 11 13:06:24 2015 UTC,"Great explanation.  My analogy would be you're a regular employee in a huge company.  You're in a meeting and suddenly, the CEO is there.  You go up to him and say, ""Ey, my boy, take a look here at this!"" and show him something. That's kind of what it's like for Hosei to use tameguchi (non-keigo) to Hamada and Matsumoto.  Downtown are Hosei's seniors, in both age, seniority, and employment position in the show.  The Japanese hierarchical system dictates that he speak to Downtown using the type of language you would use to your own CEO in a formal setting (even in a generally relaxed Japanese setting, the specific words you use with your seniors needs to be in the type of language you would use with your CEO - even if the content might be totally R-rated and chill, like on Gaki).  ""Mitekudasai"" is like ""Please take a look.""  ""Miro"" from Hosei to his seniors is like ""Ey, boy, lookee here"" at your CEO."

A common procedure when specific brands not cleared for display are used in the show.

All these are sold under different brand names all over the world. The brands sold in Japan is beyond my knowledge, but shouldn't be too hard to research.

Like he may be a terrible person, and he is a shit video game player. But that's part of his style (the terrible video game part). So many people despise him and want him to change, but if those people just stop caring about him. Then he may actually change.   To answer OP's question: The guys stage name is Happy Boy"
GakiNoTsukai,2y7osa,Spadie,11,Sat Mar 7 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"Well first of all he always blames his own shortcomings on the game he is playing. For example; taking over 30 minutes to figure out how to crouch jump in Half-Life and then claiming it's a 'bugged jumping mechanic', constantly blaming his losses in fighting games on lag or dropped inputs (for example, claims he is blocking but is also mashing buttons which cancels your block), running directly in front of enemies in stealth games and calling the game bullshit when he gets spotted (MGS2!), sprinting up to enemies in Dark Souls and mashing attack, complaining when he gets killed after running out of stamina and not blocking, once again saying the game is bullshit.  Secondly he frequently makes racist remarks, mostly towards Asian folk.  Thirdly he insults his actual fanbase on a regular basis.  Those are a few reasons why people hate him. I think it's mostly because he pins his own inadequacy on the game/another person while also trying to seem so superior to everyone else.  Edit: Just for an example, This is a video of him getting double perfected in Street Fighter 4. First round he wins; ""He's horrible. He's terrible. Hahahaha. Absolutely awful. I love it. Online play, only the shitty may apply!""  Next round: ""Can't do anything. I was pressing buttons. (yeah, that's part of the reason why it wasn't blocking) I'm pressing- I'm actually trying to throw, I didn't get a tech I didn't get a fucking throw I got nothing!, The entire round was because I couldn't do any fucking moves online. He didn't get one legitimate hit""  From then on it's just excuses, saying it's lag, the online sucks, the other guy is hacking. See, when he wins, the other person is awful or retarded but when THEY win it's because the game is broken and the other person is cheating. You can see BOTH of those attitudes in that one video, see how quickly he switches attitudes? That's why people hate him.  SORRY FOR THE OFF TOPIC OP. I HAD TO RESPOND"
GakiNoTsukai,2y7osa,AzureSkyy,4,Sat Mar 7 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"I'd first like to thank you for explaining instead of downvoting.   But with your first point. I see it as he is like a rage quit youtuber. Like that one guy from roosterteeth. People take him too seriously. He has always been shit at games, and doesn't put the effort to learn. So I don't know why people keep nagging him about it. Idk. I never really took him seriously from the get go. So what he says doesn't effect me though.  I do see him insult races sometimes, and I'd like for him to stop as well."
GakiNoTsukai,2y7osa,Spadie,5,Sat Mar 7 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"I think some people do view him as one of those rage-because-it's-funny guys but I think it goes beyond that. It doesn't seem like he does it to be funny. He actually seems like a big manchild who blames his own shortcomings on others. Along with him insulting his genuine fans and making racist remarks it just really places me and thousands of other people at the inescapable conclusion that he is being genuine in his childishness and anger. But it's like watching a trainwreck, it's just so horrible but you can't look away."
GakiNoTsukai,2y7osa,AzureSkyy,2,Sat Mar 7 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"That's very true. He does actually blame games a lot of the time. Thanks for your viewpoint. I enjoyed it.

You can't call it spoilers mentioning a 14 months old show.  If I hadn't seen it before you put the spoiler flair on it I would have skipped it since I am waiting for the subs to finish before seeing the prison batsu. I am sure others will do the same.

It's understandable that you do that when asked, but look how his arguments are doing under the scrutiny of fellow redditors.  Only use the spoiler flair if your post is mentioning something pertaining to the prison batsu. And I guess it can be ignored when the whole subbed batsu is available. And then again put to use as soon as rumors of the next one starts later this year."

However, something that usually brings me a lot of joy are the ""gag repitition causing exhausted laughter"" instances that occur now and again, like in the Hot Springs game, Matsumoto and (I believe) Endo's characters repeatedly making the ""running motion"" to leave, and then stopping, the whole ""Kouhei Ya Yamada/Shohei HEY!"" middle of the night incident, and the ""singer unaware his mic doesn't work""."
GakiNoTsukai,2y2ukc,untbunny,3,Fri Mar 6 00:59:54 2015 UTC,It wasn't exhausted laughter but the repeated overuse of Itao's wife dancing in the High School batsu is probably one of my favorite things ever.

GakiNoTsukai,2y2ukc,TheLegendOf1900,3,Fri Mar 6 18:26:25 2015 UTC,My personal favourites are when the gang are trying to sleep in batsu games and from nowhere; KONYA GA YAMADA.... KONYA GA YA-MA-DAAAAAAAAAA or SHOW-HEY HEY!!!! I always laugh like a newborn bird screaming for food.
GakiNoTsukai,2y2ukc,TheLegendOf1900,2,Sat Mar 7 21:02:28 2015 UTC,That was hilarious but my favourite will always be the two groups of old men trying to prove who is manliest by taking punishments. The cotton flame ball kills me every time.

Before that they used to have competitions or make bets to decide who would participate and who would orchestrate the batsu. It mixed up the roles and relationships in the group, and created an escalating sense of revenge against their tormentor(s). ""We'll get him next year!""  The No Laughing-format is great, but the 24 Hour Tag Batsu is still my favorite for the reasons I mentioned. And yes, I know it's not a new years batsu, but it's still a 24 hour one. Would it have been remotely as funny if Matsumoto hadn't been the cruel antagonist?  This and that they have skipped sleep time. So if I'm forced to pick one segment to get rid of it would be the ""scary"" night activities. Let them try to get some sleep instead, but keep tormenting them as they used to."
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,Donk72,9,Fri Mar 6 13:27:29 2015 UTC,"It mixed up the roles and relationships in the group   So agree with this.  Like in the Yugawara Onsen batsu, we see Hamada, Hosei, and Tanaka together.  When else have we ever seen this combination on screen?  It feels really fresh."

GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,Waldain,12,Fri Mar 6 06:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of the hand towel group simply because the Gaki crew are more spectators at that point rather than participants. They're ordered to keep out of their fights, but I'd like it if the Gaki guys were dragged in, like teaching the rookies their ways.  For a similar reason I dislike the ""So bad it's scary"" stage segment of the ""Don't Get Scared"" bit, where they're forced to sit and spectate random people doing acts. I'd rather they replace that with more bits like that one year they got trapped in a dark room and scared themselves.  I also feel the round table blacklist gossip stories bit has maybe run a bit dry, or at least Earth Defence's seemed to drag on with them grasping for material.  Having said all that I know that all of these are someone's favourite bits so overall I wouldn't say they should be totally removed, but it would be interesting to see them re-imagined or revitalized somehow."
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Fri Mar 6 11:51:24 2015 UTC,"hand towel group   Do people mean loincloth (fundoshi)?    Yeah, the round table blacklist thing is quite tricky.  My guess is that the cast really likes it because they get to mix in real stories with fake stories and play around with people's real-life reputations on screen.  But the average viewer is obviously not going to be so knowledgeable and attuned to every comedian's personal lives and rumors, so the enjoyment isn't as great as what they're getting."
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,typesoshee,3,Fri Mar 6 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"They mean the cloth on their heads, Mame Shibori  豆絞り.  Yeah celebrity gossip stories are undoubtedly gonna be really popular so I doubt it's going anywhere. I did like some of the first ones, but I think in Earth Defence they were literally going ""So... anyone got anything else...?"" to fill the time. It is funny when they grasp at straws to get dirt on Tanaka though. Overall it's kinda hit and miss but that can be said about everything. Haven't watched this year's yet though."

GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,unclesporkums,2,Sun Mar 8 19:27:15 2015 UTC,"To be honest, having butt slappers running in and out would break up the tension of getting scared. But yeah they could do more with that section to up the stakes. In Earth Defense they had that woman pretending to call the shots. I think they could do a Saw-like thing with an instigator setting challenges which puts the others fates at stake.  There are bits that are great in the Scare section though like the phonebooth, gas jets, shock pen etc. They just need to shake things up a bit more when it comes to the ""Sit and watch these acts"" bit and also the predictable end of them running from something."

The haunted/scary parts aren't nearly as funny to me as when they used to get harassed when they were trying to sleep.  Favorite part on the other hand is when they go through all the drawers in the waiting rooms.
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,shankeyx,10,Sun Mar 8 19:11:11 2015 UTC,when they all gather in a room with other comedians and tell stories about each other.
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,hookcrosshook,4,Sat Mar 7 23:39:24 2015 UTC,Probably one of my favorite segments. Japanese humor is really interesting.
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,jeboody,4,Sun Mar 8 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"When I first started watching I think it was some of the bus rides, not knowing the people or thinking some of the skits were average.  Looking at it again nowadays it's probably the game show challenge, with very few exceptions (I think it was hotelmen where Yamazaki pulls that ridiculous impression for example).  The nightly parts are arguable too, sometimes pretty decent while othertimes quite weak.  Most other parts are consistently great."

GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,thebigread,3,Sun Mar 8 21:15:15 2015 UTC,I HATE the batsu segments where they sit in a room with a ton of people and start recounting anecdotes. I fast forward through that every year.
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,Moonpunch23,6,Tue Mar 10 05:54:29 2015 UTC,"surprised by the amount of dislikes the hand towel group gets, to me that's one of the highlights. personally I don't like the Chono slap (which I suspect is very popular), it's just dragged out and low payoff, first the begging and then hosei making the same reaction face each time, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..."
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,kosmoskatten,1 point,Fri Mar 6 14:04:38 2015 UTC,"personally I don't like the Chono slap (which I suspect is very popular)   Once it became expected, I agree.  In fact, slight prison batsu spoiler from a still unsubbed portion."
GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,typesoshee,2,Fri Mar 6 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"I'm avoiding prison spoilers but for me the payoff is the struggle before the slap, the improvisational comedy between Chono and Housei. Each year is a bit different, e.g. the blindfold chase in Hotel, yanking on his necktie in Airport, stepping on his foot and pushing him over in Spy, pushing on his cheek in Teachers, all-out wrestling in Earth Defence. I liken Housei a little to Norman Wisdom's Pitkin, it's always funny in his films when he's frantically struggling against the authority figures despite the odds stacked against him and his own incompetence.  However I don't like the more predictable aspects. Primarily the location. I've been wishing for some years that they would do away with the stage setting. They've done it a couple times with him hopping on the bus, but there's so much more room for them to do more. For this year (which I understand is likely not the case) I had wanted Chono to be a prison hustler, who would pop out and order Housei to do errands for him, all of which he would get wrong (in his eyes). Again though, not looking for spoilers~  Eventually Housei may have to stop doing the slap, he's mentioned that it's causing him head trouble. Though he also asked for burdock roots to no longer be used in Moriman for whacking his head and they just ordered more. I think he took to nicking and hiding them around the studio haha. Maybe if it comes to that they can utilize Chono in other creative ways to terrorize him. evil laugh"

GakiNoTsukai,2y3q2e,p00f4c3,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:07:53 2015 UTC,The game show segments I don't mind that much. The thing that I enjoy the least is segments heavily using Japanese references. Luckily they decreased them in most of the recent batsu games but it was one of the reasons why I enjoyed the Spy batsu game the least (I think it featured a lot of famous Japenese actors in silly roles and an immitator). I also didn't enjoy the group that does painful things but over the years I started to like them.

The police batsu is from December 2006, so 802 does precede it, and the Japanese wikipedia link description above states this as well and points to episode 802 as the source of the ""Shohei!"" call.  Here's a link to the same episode, but stating that it's episode 802.  The other links you posted - if the episode number stated in them are relatively correct - would come after the police batsu, so they can't be the source."

GakiNoTsukai,2xp6h6,servarus,-1,Tue Mar 3 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"Gonna get the hate here but... Team Gaki gets donations, ad rev, and financial support (albeit low amounts) for posting content that they did not create... compensation for the work and subtitle process. I get that. If someone else is going to take the time to upload, categorize, and distribute the content, why shouldn't the put it through adfly anyway? Let's face it, adfly doesn't exactly pay much at all (pennies), and is a similar service not being provided?  I mean MOST of the subtitled content I've EVER seen throughout the last 20 some years have all said ""do not distribute"", though I'd be watching on youtube and other similar services, chalk full of ads that the original team doesn't get. If it's truly volunteer work and your pleasure is taken not from monetization, but from the availability of the content to the public, and the fact that people can access content in their language because of your team, then I don't see what the defensive posture is for regarding other people posting the same content.  The videos are plastered with your team name, who did what, etc.. all that is done wrong here apparently is the distribution is changing hands so that they don't have to go to the TeamGaki website? As far as I can tell, all credit is given in the videos themselves.  And to think that I just saw that the videos were removed from Vimeo due to third-party takedown BY TEAM GAKI is so ironic and crazy. We rant all the time about the videos being taken down by the actual production company, and now it's even being done within the community. Less places to watch. Less content out there.  How can a team that doesn't actually own the rights to the content serve a take down notice anyway? I found that a bit strange...  Still, the watchgakinotsukai blogspot page doesn't NEED to put the adfly links and I'll assume they're merely doing so to support themselves putting the content out there for some reason. Like I said before, they're probably not getting much monetary benefit from it at all, and what I see is a distribution channel has been taken away because of it..."

GakiNoTsukai,2xka5q,katistrofik,8,Sun Mar 1 20:15:10 2015 UTC,They wouldn't be far off though the TV rips you're used to seeing have commercials hand-cut out of the final video. Several hours of minor timing errors will add up. The hard part is already done though.

GakiNoTsukai,2xka5q,YamasakiGifsTumblr,5,Mon Mar 2 00:21:42 2015 UTC,"They do, but it only amounted to NTV selling licenses to American/British studios to do remakes of Silent Library. I guess NTV don't see big enough profit in subbing the originals. http://www.ntv.co.jp/english/pc/2011/02/61.html  Last November an American TV presenter came on the regular Gaki show and also told them how popular they are: http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5807#p50070"
GakiNoTsukai,2xka5q,SorcPenz,1 point,Mon Mar 2 04:31:23 2015 UTC,"Ma-chan has mentioned ""Don't let me see this on youtube"" during the confessions to Hamada on his birthday special. They know they get uploaded and translated. Best wish would be NTV contacts (or vice versa) the sub guys we know and love and they get paid to slip in some subtitles in DVDs that can be toggled on and off. Won't cost NTV that much, not for the guys who are doing it practically for free now."
GakiNoTsukai,2xka5q,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"The Gaki guys do know there's international viewers, there was an episode of Downtown DX where they talked about a surprising number of Italian fans for Housei for example.  But unfortunately I don't think it's up to Matsumoto himself, it's probably the license holders at NTV. DVDs are very expensive in Japan, over here people have turned to digital channels or bargain-rate physical discs so they might not see us as a big profit.  So sadly it's probably wishful thinking for NTV to make the first move, it's more likely they'd listen if a distributor / publisher / streamer approached them who was willing to pay their license fee cost. Wonder how much licensing costs for the most recent batsu.  Sites like Crunchyroll (run by former fansubbers) pay the Japanese license holders first for the right to distribute their shows. They then subtitle the show themselves and stream it online with video ads and paid subscriptions (though if it's anything like Twitch, where most viewers know ways around all that, letting the ads play or subscribing are essentially donations from viewers).  Once they've made enough money to cover what they paid out of pocket to license the show in the first place, they can then make a profit. With that profit they can pay their subbers and buy future licenses."
GakiNoTsukai,2xka5q,SorcPenz,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:41:05 2015 UTC,"Lots of risk involved, and I can imagine the subbers having less money to risk than NTV, not that NTV is huge. and NTV, like you said, doesn't see the motivation behind it. It's gotta be worth it, meanwhile the subbers are doing it out of love. I can imagine licensing the music for overseas plays is also a pain. They use tons of obscure music and references, tons of food companies etc, and they probably only got the rights to use in within Japan, not around the world yet, I'm guessing."
GakiNoTsukai,2xka5q,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"True, NTV may sooner prefer just sending out a cease and desist in responce to a request. But yeah as much as I'd love it, it doesn't seem like NTV are motivated to invest in Gaki subtitles. You're right though, licensing the New Years special with all the music and such would be tough, maybe individual Gaki episodes would have to be the first stepping stone instead. Either way, still unlikely as I'm sure it requires thousands of dollars."

GakiNoTsukai,2xjme8,YamasakiGifsTumblr,4,Sun Mar 1 12:09:24 2015 UTC,Great moment to watch.  Thanks!
GakiNoTsukai,2xjme8,katistrofik,4,Sun Mar 1 16:58:35 2015 UTC,"This was a wonderful moment. I guess in Japan, they don't often say how they feel about their families the same way people do in the west.  Also, I'm not sure why these subs are called amateur. They're very well done! If the poster is worried about his English, I didn't notice any problems there, either."
GakiNoTsukai,2xjme8,kamichama,2,Mon Mar 2 06:33:18 2015 UTC,"Well even in the West people don't always actually say the L word to each other, they just assume until one needs to hear it, or they're just plain bashful.  Thank you so so much for the compliment about the subs, I always greatly appreciate such kind feedback. I call them Amateur as a disclaimer because I don't actually know Japanese, when I watch a show I have little clue what they're actually saying beyond the stuff people typically pick up like ""suki"". I just use various tools anyone can use for a literal translation then reword it in native English. I have a page about the tools here: http://yamasakigifs.tumblr.com/amateursubbing  When possible someone who actually knows Japanese kindly checks for me and they're credited separately, for example Hidensetsu helped me with some lines in this one."
GakiNoTsukai,2xjme8,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Mon Mar 2 12:24:33 2015 UTC,"Well the part where Housei said ”次女に僕のことどう思っているか聞きたい” can be better said as ""I want to ask my younger daughter what she thinks of me."" Also, the part where you translated as ""A growing family, right?"" I interpreted as ""these three, right?"", except ""right"" isn't exactly the perfect word. Another thing is ""緊張” in this case is more like nervous instead of tense. Oh, and ”お疲れ様” is more like ""thank you for your hard work."" This is how I translated it, anyway."
GakiNoTsukai,2xjme8,TakoMakura,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:06:09 2015 UTC,"Ah thank you for the help!  Actually Hidensetsu had already checked this one over for me, but it's very subjective so that's not to say you're mistaken, if I hadn't already of released this one I'd of considered your interpretation too! If you haven't already check out Hidensetsu's sub of Kiki Castella which is hilarious! http://gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5694  ""Tense"" was intended in the same way (unable to relax because of nervousness) so I'm glad we match there!  For お疲れ様 there's actually a note to that effect at the top of the video (""Cheers for hard work."") However everyone laughs at their very casual and out of context use of the term. So I put it more loosely than what it'd be in a formal context. It was a tough call though and something I deliberated over. So again you could be right there.  Thanks again for wishing to help me out."
GakiNoTsukai,2xjme8,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Fri Mar 6 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is definitely more subjective in this case. I was just putting in what I thought would be more accurate translations, but I think a lot of the time one phrase in English doesn't cover the whole meaning, so two or more can definitely fit.   As for ”お疲れ様” I just interpreted his daughter being playful, but also expressing politeness and gratitude in a more casual way. I think both ways can work, though. Just wanted to put my two cents in :)"
GakiNoTsukai,2xjme8,TakoMakura,1 point,Fri Mar 6 07:15:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's definitely tricky. Japanese Kanji can say a lot in a small space of time making it difficult to allow enough time to cover a literal English equivalent to be read in subtitles, so it does become open to interpretation.  Ah with お疲れ様, since it was Housei who said it first I felt it was something he taught and she responds in turn, but overall I'm glad our interpretations match on it expressing gratitude. I think it's a nice gesture for them to say thanks for each others efforts during the day, even if not in the same workplace. Housei I guess thanks for her hard work at school, and his daughter thanks him for his hard work at his job. Sort of saying cheers to each other. But the show hosts seem taken aback by that vague use so they're like ""Cheers to your daughter!?"" haha.  Anyway I am sincerely grateful for your 2 cents, or in my interpretation, 2 pennies haha translation joke.... crickets chirp Most of all I'm just glad that I could match the gist as I do worry about putting words in peoples mouths, so thank you for your insight."

GakiNoTsukai,2x6aum,Mitsumasa,2,Thu Feb 26 02:03:38 2015 UTC,No Yamazaki?
GakiNoTsukai,2x6aum,cesariojpn,2,Thu Feb 26 08:32:32 2015 UTC,I believe these ads are a spinoff from the TV drama MintGreenIceCream linked to which has the same name of this song and Housei wasn't in that drama. I once read he was gonna be the background dude but opted out to focus on other work so Matsumoto took the role on in his place (the window washer etc.)

Here's the higher res render: http://i.imgur.com/RVAaXhQ.png  It's a transparent 1600x1200 PNG. Hopefully that'll be sufficient for those who wanted to make this their wallpaper :)  I fixed the order of the members and gave Hamada a lovely pair of breasts in honour of his recent GNT outfits :D.

The images need to be .ICO icon format, so either you have to hope someone else can save each face as a icon or you have to open the image in Microsoft Paint, crop 1 head out and select to save it as a ""24 Bit Bitmap"" BUT, actually call the file ""something.ico"", this will make an icon you can use."

I think the layout may turn people off, seems like images are getting repeated and I'm not a big fan of auto-playing music on blogs. Maybe you can try a different layout because your art is really great!  Also if it helps note that Tumblr only makes use of the first 5 tags of a post in its site search, so make those count."

GakiNoTsukai,2x04jf,WTBRaegO,2,Fri Feb 27 00:05:00 2015 UTC,"This is worse than the week before christmas as a kid.  I told myself I wouldn't watch it untill they all came out when the first subbed 30 minutes went online. That lasted about 20 minutes. And then I found myself looking at the first episode, regretting my decition half way through. But fortunately it ended when they arrived on the bus, so it was a good place to really promise myself to not watch any more.  I've kept that promise so far, and actually downloaded the five episodes already done. So when the last one is out I will just download that too, and can watch them as long as I have power. That day nothing will stop me, not even some idiot digging up the intenet cable."

The first bit was in Typesetting, as Mickstar mentioned on another post Rich is moving house and no other typesetters were available, but they both got free time tonight.  Later in the day I checked and Part 5 had gone all yellow for ""Checking.""  Then it went to the green ""Part 5 Complete"" bar.

GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,decayingteeth,9,Sat Feb 21 10:53:43 2015 UTC,"For me, it's about relatability (okay, not so much with the beatings). It's a handful of different characters sitting around and having a laugh. Much like you or I might at a social gathering.   The comedy doesn't need too much in the way of a storyline, unlike everything on the TV in England (and likely America?).   It's simple, good natured, fun.   And matsuns laugh is desperately infectious."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,thebigread,8,Sat Feb 21 12:39:05 2015 UTC,"I started off watching stuff like the batsus and Silent Library etc. which were already subbed so the language barrier wasn't an issue. After watching stuff like 24hr Tag where they're basically in one room the whole time, you get to know the comedians themselves well, their personalities. Through that I grew to love their interactions.  From there I began watching the actual weekly series raw because I wanted to see more of that interaction, I can get a gist of what's going on through their tone and such. They're just a really fun to watch group and there isn't much by comparison on UK TV so got no choice but to deal with the language barrier. Today I watched an episode of Hamada's show GobuGobu where Housei filled in for Higashino, couldn't understand a word but loved watching Hamada and Housei make each other laugh etc.  Housei became a favourite of mine, so I also started to watch him on other stuff raw, his heavy use of facial expressions, physical gestures and voice intonation makes it a bit easier to follow for me. I watched a bunch of episodes of him in a sitcom with Ken Shimura and though I don't know Japanese, I could roughly follow the order of events in that way."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Sat Feb 21 15:08:09 2015 UTC,Same for me except I am fortunate enough to understand Japanese. I love seeing how they interact with each other and the relationship that they have. It's so hard to find a similar show where they just work off of each other the way GNT does. There's a level of innocence that just makes the show feel fresh.
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,TakoMakura,6,Fri Feb 27 07:27:51 2015 UTC,You don't have to have a working knowledge of Japanese culture to die laughing watching Endo sprint right into a trapped hole.
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,GussyH,2,Mon Feb 23 12:43:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah really. Bottom line is humor is humor.   It's a shame I won't get all the subtleties from not speaking Japanese, but there is still plenty of just universally funny material from these guys."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,slappymcnutface,6,Sun Mar 15 08:59:15 2015 UTC,"I suppose a huge part is that it knows what it wants to do and keeps it simple on a fundamental level. The execution seems grand and complex, but at its core, Batsu games are essentially series of pranks and set-ups meant to get a group of guys to laugh when they're not supposed to, and get a smack on the butt for doing so.  It sounds almost primitive and overly slapstick, but the ingenuity really shines when some of the more intricate pranks happen with great success, and it feels incredibly satisfying on a comical level. It's like a higher, more fulfilling form of schadenfreude. It's a type of humor that anyone can enjoy. I've yet to show Batsu games to anyone who ended up not enjoying it. I've watched a ton of them with about 6 or so different friends, and it has a 100% success rate. They all love it and want more.  Yeah, some sequences, such as celebrity guests and dialect/language-based jokes can go over our heads, but it doesn't change the overall simplicity and effectiveness. Plus, with a little common sense, some of those jokes can click anyway."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,Xovina,13,Sat Feb 21 14:20:03 2015 UTC,"You are talking about new series. Old were based on very simple and understandable humor for everyone. If you watch first batsu games, you don't even need translations, it is pure fun just looking at what they do, while new series require you to read entire pages of explanations on each celebrity and other comics to understand what's so funny about it. That is actually what I dislike about their new content. But then again it would be hard even for a large team of great comics to keep making original stuff for so many years.  I am pretty sure that majority of people got hooked by watching silent library and first batsu games like me, since that humor is ageless and for everyone. Then it is just a matter of time before you understand inside jokes. I also believe that all of them are incredibly charismatic, and that makes me want to watch them just to see what they do, even if I don't understand everything.  And pure interest in japanese culture is what makes people get through first shows to understand the humor.  Also, some people might be used to japanese culture by watching anime. Japanese animation is a great example, showing that sometimes you need to get through half of the series first, to understand and get into it, but it's worth it most of the time.  And sense of humor is evolving with age, you can direct it depending on what shows you watch :)"
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,7nenhan,7,Sat Feb 21 12:11:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this, I started off watching the 24 hour tag which got me interested in their over stuff. Ever since then I've been hooked and re-watched a lot of their stuff, old and new!"
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,dotJapan,4,Sat Feb 21 13:06:35 2015 UTC,"If I watch the whole thing at once, instead of in parts, I get pretty caught up in the tension and find myself trying not to laugh as well. Which makes me laugh more."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,Joshopolis,3,Sun Feb 22 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"I've watched these since middle school, and I'm 19 now. I don't know. Gaki No Tsukai is just hilarious because the humor is a little different from what I'm used to and that's refreshing.  Eventually I just learned to love the comedians. I like to see them suffer."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,Gypsyhook_,2,Wed Mar 4 06:03:00 2015 UTC,For me the funny part isn't the batsu but the tension before.  The batsu merely breaks it and brings the laughter.
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,Hashiru,2,Sat Feb 21 22:54:02 2015 UTC,schadenfreude
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,Danadin,2,Mon Feb 23 08:36:46 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, most people get first sight of the boys in 24 hour tag which is great on it's own, no need for inside jokes when the premise is good, and then people look for more and find MUCH MORE and get super excited and binge watch all the batsus.  everyone=me."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,lnickelly,2,Fri Feb 27 19:39:33 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of it is simply how well all the Gaki members play off each other as comedians. Honestly I think the Batsu games at this point are just one good thing amongst many others. I think if you throw them into any situation they will make it funny, even moreso if you've been watching them for a while and appreciate their different personalities.  I don't think there is anything really like it anywhere else in the world."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,samsonkeane,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"Well, as someone who loves Japan's culture, language, history and food. It's easy to get hooked on it.  I remember the first batsu I've watched which was the high school batsu game. It was something I've never seen before and probably the funniest thing ever.  There are so many cultural nuances to it, especially when you consider Japan's strict society. The batsu games are outragous, crazy and ridiculous which is a contradiction to Japan's society itself.  Yes, ridiculous and crazy are the best words to describe it. And they don't shy away from digging up secrets or make fun of serious matters like the divorce of Endo and Chiaki. Even the crew members or stars aren't safe."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,schalab,1 point,Mon Feb 23 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"From Downtown's wikipedia entry.   In the group's early years, many recognized Downtown's talent, but doubted Downtown would ever succeed due to their sluggish style, which was so drastically different from that of mainstream manzai. Shinsuke Shimada, a leading manzai comedian, had been one of the doubters until he saw one of Downtown's performances. Shimada was startled by how funny and complex Downtown was, and immediately announced his retirement from manzai.   I had a similar kind of reaction where I was amazed by how unique and fresh their style was. It blew everything I knew about comedy beforehand out of the water. This was above Monty Python, Whose Line etc.  It was the simple subtle things, like when they are in a segment and they say 'I do not see the purpose of this'. They point out the absurdity at a very nuanced, intelligent level, which I cannot get enough of. I watch them mainly for Matsumoto trying to make Hamada laugh with his sharpness and speedy word play. The verbal humor more than the physical humor is what I am here for."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,Waldain,1 point,Mon Feb 23 14:52:33 2015 UTC,I don't think everything has to be an inside joke. One of my favorite moments in the batsu games is when Hamada flips Matsumoto's brother's book and the picture on the back is even more hilarious.
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,CRFlixxx,1 point,Fri Feb 27 01:06:36 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason I love the the 24hr games is, it seems to me foreign humor is very broad and has many more elements of wackiness and slapstick.  This makes Gaki & the 24hr game appeal to a mass audience.  Also, being subtitled makes me more attuned to the emotion in the comic's voices and their facial expressions.  Even though I may not get all the nuances of the language, the way they say it and the look on their faces say alot.  But, for me, the best part is when they turn on each other and try to make themselves laugh.  One thing I've learned from listening to Opie & Anthony and Tough Crowd, is you can't put 3 or more great comics in a room together for long, before they start ripping into each other.  That's the best stuff."
GakiNoTsukai,2wnach,EcrThrowaway,0,Sat Feb 28 11:41:19 2015 UTC,"It's funny.  Some of the bits involving celebrities are bad. In particular, I didn't like one where a bunch of them were in a play. That was boring. Usually it doesn't matter who they are, whatever they're doing is funny on it's own.  I don't agree about the inside jokes. They redo a lot of the same stuff every year, but it doesn't matter if you've seen it before. You don't need to know yamasaki gets slapped every year if you are seeing it for the first time."

Members who do not have profiles yet: Mickstar (Michael)  http://www.teamgaki.com/members/   This year he's busy with university so he's just popping in when he has free time. So I think it's more something you'd have to take up with Mickstar direct than Team Gaki as a group."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,4,Sun Feb 22 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"If you're that person from the livestream, then we already talked about this, but it's not about the money because:  The money doesn't go to staff. At all. It goes towards paying for the server that hosts all of the files.  While donations are awesome and major thanks to those who donate, it's not an incentive for us to ignore work/school/etc. When Mickstar has time, he jumps in and subs, but otherwise, he subs when he can, just like the rest of us.  Also, just as a side note, everyone on the project is awesome, including Mickstar. :)"
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,oolongxcha,3,Mon Feb 23 18:26:56 2015 UTC,Hey. I wrote this like 3 days ago before we spoke so not sure why it's come up on reddit now. Haha
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:51:55 2015 UTC,"I think things stay on the New tab until it gets enough comments/upvotes, then it goes to the front page."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,basiltrecks,0,Tue Feb 24 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"I think what the OP is sayin is dat we should try giving money to Mick so that he would translate more often, the Prison game or general episodes. He's been around for a while and his subs are generally good. He obviously has time since he's done 40 minutes of this batsu game already I saw.  He's a legend in the Gaki community and that's because of his efforts last yr, he destroyed the subs in like 8 weeks. So props to him, we should all definitely as a community try and see if we can get him to help the Gaki community get the attention it deserves. I'm sure he isn't gna turn down money if he's getting money. Personally speaking, I would love it if there were more Gaki episodes translated at the speed he does it."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,oolongxcha,4,Mon Feb 23 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand, but the reality is, if he's busy with school, no amount of money is going to really change the workload. So even if the community donates to him, it's not going to do him any good to sub Gaki instead of studying. In fact, it won't change how fast I translate either because doing fansubs and relying on donations will never compare to my full-time job's salary and thus, I'm not going to miss work to do fansubs instead. I'm sure most of the other subbers feel the same way. We just do it in our free time because we love Gaki and we want to share it with you guys.  And yes, I know that Mickstar is amazing at subbing, he's very fast. And not to steal his thunder or anything, but the rest of us are working as hard as our schedules allow. Just to be honest, if we knew that Mickstar was getting a bunch of personal donations and not the rest of us subbers, that's pretty demotivating and would probably ruin some of the group relations. This is all hypothetically speaking, but it would be a strange feeling to know that one person in a volunteer group is getting cash in their pocket and not anyone else."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,articunozard_,0,Tue Feb 24 00:14:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he would be willing to dedicate an hour a day to translating if he's getting paid, I know I would. If he has a PT job, he could quit that, do this from his room. To be honest, if it's motivation that is lacking for him to do it all in one go, then let's just give him motivation.   The whole issue is about the subbers 'not having enough time'. Well if he can find time, then everyone wins. The subbers with not enough time don't suffer because they can just do their jobs, we get subbed vids, he gets donations. Everyone wins."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Tue Feb 24 00:39:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it's ""donations"" anymore if it's a replacement wage for a job. In that case it'd be better if NTV did a legit partnership deal, like some gaming companies have done, e.g. Nintendo. Right now Gaki gets slammed by NTV on Youtube but if they allowed it then subbers could get 70%+ of ad revenue with the rest going to NTV.  Or if NTV had a livestream site up they could do the well-performing subscription vs ads model that Twitch does.  NTV's own site admits the popularity of subbed Gaki on Youtube (Silent Library) allowed them international exposure, it's sad that only led to them licensing American/British remakes.  http://www.ntv.co.jp/english/pc/2011/02/61.html"
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,basiltrecks,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:55:47 2015 UTC,"We can't compare it to what Nintendo are doing. That's a totally different thing.  If we can pay/donate him or whoever to translate more Gaki videos and it's not going to be stupidly dear, I am down. Down-town"
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Tue Feb 24 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"Well Nintendo took issue because people were taking pay for their copyrighted content (e.g. Mario). But with the advent of stuff like Youtube and Twitch that connects the public with the companies, it's now possible for gamers to earn a living playing content they did not originally create.  Likewise if subbers could be permitted to earn a living distributing their subs of content they did not originally create, then Gaki could be on Youtube or some streaming site and earn both the subbers and companies profits. Right now NTV takes issue like Nintendo used to."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,typesoshee,2,Tue Feb 24 01:23:45 2015 UTC,"Let's plays and streaming are huge on the internet.  Streaming of TV shows, not so much.  Netflix and Hulu are players, but IMHO the biggest player is still torrent.  I think that's the difference.    You actually can make a living as a big let's player or streamer.  For subbing?  You can make a living as a translator.  If you're NTV, you would hire a translator and pay them a flat fee to sub a show, and then they would release the show.  No way they would give money to subbers as a percentage of views/the ad money.    I think it's just that with let's plays, the content is partially created by the player, so gaming companies understand that you gotta let them have the ad money to incentivize them to keep playing and get more views for themselves and their game.  For TV, the creative content isn't created by subbers.  The subbers would just be another part of the TV-making process and would certainly be paid a flat fee.  Continuous ad profit would go to NTV or the creators, like Downtown or Suga."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Tue Feb 24 02:42:03 2015 UTC,"I think Ducktoaster has had an ongoing stream for Gaki that has regular viewers? I haven't really watched it myself though. Of course when the annual batsu is streamed there's an influx of viewers.  With Netflix etc. you can't access anything without paying upfront (outside of a trial). With Twitch you can disable ads with a blocker or just not subscribe, but many people disable their adblockers/subscribe anyway as a goodwill gesture.  I see your point about the translation being a one-time thing. But if someone subs a video once and it gets views every day, at what point do we say it's because of the subtitle content or the video content?  Considering how few people watch raws, outside of a few things accessible without words, I think the subs play a major part in a Gaki video's popularity abroad. Perhaps more so than in the case of games, where people can follow the game's action without following what the gamer is saying. Though I tend to just watch gamers for funny commentary, the most popular streams are for competitive gaming and speedruns. Gaki relies on understanding what they are saying to get continued enjoyment.  It seems like NTV recognised that the fansub of Silent Library with over 3 million views expanded their market and allowed them to sell licensing permission to American and British studios. But I guess hiring in-house translators and taking the extra step to sub the show themselves didn't look profitable enough for them. Therefore if we're such a niche market giving subbers a cut might not be as huge a blow to their profit margins. They'd get profit in a market they currently get none from.  The subbers job also may not necessarily end with the sub, subbers can build up a following of their own abroad and funnel in more views. Publishers get ongoing profits for distributing others content.  Though of course this is all conjecture and dreams haha..."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,typesoshee,2,Tue Feb 24 03:47:37 2015 UTC,"Here are some numbers that I'm just throwing out there.  I'm just wondering how much ""business potential"" overseas Gaki has from NTV's perspective in a ""back of the envelope calculation"" way.   I Youtubed ""Silent Library"" sorted by view count.  The top one is ~10 million but the video is 2 years old.  The 20th result had 400k views.  The 100th result had 50k views.  So what's the total view count?  I don't know... maybe 30-50 million views?  And that's over a few years.  Silent Library MTV was on for ~3 years, and most Gaki videos of Silent Library that have a lot of views are a lot older than that.  I Youtubed Gaki No Tsukai sorted by view count.  Top one is 1.3 million views (2 years old) and the 20th result is 250k views (2 years old) although these view counts are obviously skewed down from the ""true"" count because a lot of Gaki videos have been taken down for copy right reasons by now.  I don't know what the total view count would have been, 10 or 20 million, being generous?    On the other hand, Gaki No Tsukai on actual TV has had TV ratings as high as 20% in the 1990s and as low as 7% in recent times.  And according to this and this, it seems like Japanese TV ratings are measured as a percentage of TVs being used, basically.  If you assume that everyone has access to at least one TV, it's just a straight population percentage.  If we assume Gaki No Tsukai gets 10% ratings these days, and Japan's population is ~120 million, that means Gaki No Tsukai gets 12 million views a week on TV (with TV ads, of course).  That's more than 500 million views a year (not even counting the New Years batsu).  Plus, I think I've even read that these days, Gaki relies on DVD sales a lot to stay to try to competitive in the TV-sphere of business.  (However, of course, to do this properly, we should be comparing theoretical ""revenue per view"" on NTV vs. ""revenue per view"" on Youtube.)  I suppose this is why it's still considered not worth their time at this point, because this means Gaki on NTV gets over a billion views in 2 years.  But if it does become worth their time (gets 10s of millions of views a week on Youtube), then they'll just hire professional subbers and pay them a fixed fee.  No sense sharing the continuous weekly profit with them."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Tue Feb 24 04:32:58 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind Mickstar last year had no school/work, therefore last year was the exception. Mickstar's current school/work situation means he now has a lot less time. The wait between part 4 and 5 would be no different as he was not available in that time gap, if he had the time, he would of popped in earlier.  Mickstar also worked on the Teachers Batsu the year before last. Due to understandable personal circumstances, there were delays e.g. Part 3 was released Jan 16th and Part 4 came out Feb 26th.  Comments back then went like: ""If this goes on like this, it will be another year with a subtitle that takes 6/7 months to complete... when this is like a 6 hour show, and some subbers subtitle 1 hour shows in 1 week... I sincerely don't get it. Maybe these last years the show is subtitled by really slow subbers... either you don't have enough translators, or the ones you have are taking their good time to translate.""  Though in the end the person who made that comment joined the Gaki Team and contributed towards helping the subbing process along as a typesetter / quality checker. Happy ending!  Mickstar would like to do speed / live subbing individual episodes, but due to workloads it isn't rolling yet, but hopefully something to look forward to in the future! http://gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&p=51211#p51211"

And at that point, you'd have to divide those money evenly between member (Or fixed percentage depends on people's decision), or else someone's gonna get salty and quit just because that other guys got more money.  Over all, hiring people over the net to do something is not as easy as it sounds in real life. After all, or at least in my case, doing thing on the net is my side hobby and I want to do it in my free time, I don't want it to become a 2nd job where I have to commit more of my life to do it."

If you're proposing for a paid translator, you're still stuck with a volunteer timer/typesetter whose pace the releases will depend on... There won't be releases as quick as the translations go because subbing is a team effort ... well, unless they have both the skill sets for timing and translating..."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,typesoshee,2,Tue Feb 24 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"Well, according to the logic here, if you can throw enough money at a fansubber to change them into a paid translator, you should be able to come up with enough money to ""force"" them to learn typesetting, or come up with enough money to find a pay a dedicated typesetter for that translator."

Sounds like jealousy to me.  No one has asked him to quit his job, we don't even know if he has a job. If he is at college, then surely he has time, he must do... Hence why people want some more translations.  Again, it was a good idea by the OP in my opinion. You guys are obviously butt hurt because of the lack of attention, but if you actually translated the videos and didn't spend all your time on reddit and trying to milk atention, then maybe people might recognise you're actually doing some work? Just saying..."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,oolongxcha,3,Tue Feb 24 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"If I were butthurt, I'd quit subbing. I can see why the turnover rate in the fansubbing community is so high, there's so many complaints and nagging from the fanbase over how people spend their free time to do volunteer work. But I like Gaki and I like most of the people in this community. So I think instead of complaining about how slow it is or how I'm not using my time wisely, why don't you try subbing and do it for the good of the community? Just saying.  But I will take your advice. I'll spend my time doing more productive things than to continuously explain why I can't sub every day of my life."

I don't care what you do in your free time or at your work, you are on reddit a lot, I see you posting a lot. All you do is milk for attention and people to say you're amazing for translating. The truth is you are very slow when translating and when you get critisized, you will not accept it and you get butthurt."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,typesoshee,2,Tue Feb 24 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"Again, it was a good idea by the OP in my opinion.    If it was a good idea by OP, it still is a good idea by OP.  You guys will never find out until you try it, so you should just reach out to mickstar and go for it.  We would never stop you guys from that.  I'm just looking at it from an economic and realistic perspective, and that's why we brought up Crunchyroll as an example, which actually does this kind of stuff for profit.    If you can come up with enough donations, you should be able to get more translation and typesetting.  This is a fact of economics and business.  That's the aspect I'm interested in.    But OP was missing the facts that 1) mickstar has been on Team Gaki for ages, he's basically been a core part of their group for years, and 2) Team Gaki doesn't ""hire"" anyone because it's an entirely voluntary operation with no profit."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,enyagoole,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:14:29 2015 UTC,How do we get in touch with him? He's rarely on the gnt site.
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:55:35 2015 UTC,"From a factual economic standpoint, Crunchyroll I think has to buy licensing permission first, subs it, makes their licensing money back and only then then earns an income, right?  Whereas this case skips the licensing so... Usually when I hear of fans getting cease and desists it's due to them earning income from a fan project outside of convention halls. By tax law this may need to be claimed as self-employed income rather than donations."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,drench42,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:40:37 2015 UTC,I've previously written ideas to Team Gaki but they never wrote back on facbeook. is there any other way to get through to them? Is there any way they could discuss this thread among them and tell us what they all think. I fink that would make things move quicker
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,thomas_122,0,Tue Feb 24 23:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, yes- I would do this"
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,enyagoole,0,Sat Feb 21 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"If it is guy who I think it is, the live translator, I think it could be an incredible idea to try and convince him to translate more. If the Facebook group is right and people all chip in $1, he will be one rich dude!  I don't know why we didn't do this sooner to convince other subbers to be honest. This show is way too good not to be translated."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,articunozard_,0,Tue Feb 24 00:02:56 2015 UTC,Start a big enuf petition and he might make a come back. I've not been that impressed with Prison so far compared to last year to be fair and the 2nd half is usually worse so not really bothered about Prison. But having the basic episodes translated on a weekly basis would put a smile on my face.
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,bobxtrixx,0,Tue Feb 24 00:12:56 2015 UTC,"It seems to me there is conflict between the subbers of TG in my opinion. I'm not surprised since typeso and oolong are the main subbers this year. I think some of the comment here are unacceptable. On the other hand, I do want more subs so if there is a chance for that to happen, then I support this. Hopefully if enough of us write on here, there will be a reaction from TG and maybe a new project meaning that people will translate more."

GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,bobxtrixx,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:40:13 2015 UTC,They aren't as involved on reddit so I assumed that typeso and oolong were the main translators. You are right though about the other translators so sorry about that!
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Tue Feb 24 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, no worries, Team Gaki actually has its roots on gaki-no-tsukai.com rather than Reddit and the others are more active on their own site/Facebook. Likewise Mickstar isn't as involved in Reddit."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,oolongxcha,2,Tue Feb 24 23:11:53 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah, typesoshee and I got acquainted through this subreddit, so we were active Redditors prior to subbing Gaki, but Team Gaki doesn't frequent this site."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,bobxtrixx,0,Wed Feb 25 04:34:17 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, will TG actually discuss this situation? I've messaged TG and still have not heard anything. I've written in the past too but got no reply so I guess you guys don't check your messages often."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,Bobblehead_IV,-2,Wed Feb 25 08:11:21 2015 UTC,I wish i could donate specifically to mick because he actually puts aside time to translate where a few other's cough rich cough hold up the project by taking 2 weeks to do a 5 hour task.
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,YamasakiGifsTumblr,4,Mon Feb 23 21:57:20 2015 UTC,Mickstar himself explained Rich's situation:  http://www.reddit.com/r/GakiNoTsukai/comments/2w1407/status_of_nlb_prison/corvfsx  They're good friends:  https://www.facebook.com/TeamGaki/photos/a.162767230542875.37150.145650568921208/319569121529351/?type=1&permPage=1
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,oolongxcha,5,Mon Feb 23 22:50:55 2015 UTC,"I hope you do realize that the other people on the Prison Batsu team read this subreddit.  Also, the donations don't go to staff at all, all of us are doing this for free. The money goes towards paying for the server that hosts all of the files."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,articunozard_,-1,Mon Feb 23 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"But why don't we just pay Mick to do it? It can be like a part time job for him. I don't understand your point here. He's had more experience translating then the guys doing it this year, he is much quicker and he's reliable. For 2 weeks, no news from TG. He comes in, translating done. He did live trans which were unbelievable for 2 yrs running, he obviously wants to dedicate more time to us, so why not let us give him something in return.  As a fan, I prefer that and i'm willing to chip in."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,oolongxcha,3,Tue Feb 24 00:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, he is more experienced than I am at translating for Gaki. But in the end, that's his decision to make, so if he says yes to taking it on as a job, that's all good. But if you have real life things to take care of, money isn't going to help someone get their studying/job done.   But anyone could say this or that and speaking for him doesn't do anything. Though I hope you realize that it is a team effort and it's not like we're sitting around, procrastinating on subbing. We're all subbing when we can, which is why Mickstar jumps in to help, because he found the time to do so."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,thomas_122,-5,Tue Feb 24 00:38:26 2015 UTC,Since your part of the team youre the only guys who talk to him. Help us out dude! more subs at a higher speed means happier peops and a bigger community.
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,oolongxcha,3,Tue Feb 24 00:50:10 2015 UTC,"I am helping you out to get these subs. I'm spending my free time to get you this content. Sure, it may not be as quick as you'd like, but subbing is not my job and it will never be my job because it's my hobby. As much as I'd like to help the community, I'm not going to light myself on fire to keep you guys warm."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,thomas_122,0,Tue Feb 24 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"People are just looking forward to it and we are always going to look to the fastest/best person to translate. We get it's just a hobby for you, we really do, but when a guy just in his spare time will do so much for a community like this, we are going to take to him.  Thank you again for your services but we're definitely not asking you to light yourself on fire. Just to join us trying to get Mickstar to help out more. :) It really isn't anything against you"
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,oolongxcha,2,Tue Feb 24 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"I understand, I'm just trying shed some light on why this is a tall request. This kind of work does require a team though because it's typesetting, translating, proofreading, and encoding. Relying on one person to get a 5 hour show done is asking for a lot. Mickstar already helps out when he has the time and he's been a part of the community for a while. It's great because we're all doing the best we can with what we have. So instead of speculating on what Mickstar should do, he should be the one in control of deciding."
GakiNoTsukai,2wlj8n,thomas_122,0,Tue Feb 24 20:07:05 2015 UTC,"I think that's why people are offering to pay him, hopefully he will see this and want to translate more!"

GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Fri Feb 20 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"I had the same thought about crowd-sourcing for j-variety subs which never really realized... I was thinking more on the lines where I dump all my pre-timed files(partially subbed) with a link to the RAW on a site where translators can just grab the files and work on it right away and when done, they can send me back the file for proofing + styling. Some sort of a chat room or something similar to announce if translators are working/how much done/link to the files that they've done..etc.. all this could've been really easy if some subbing site similar to viki existed.... for free...-_-"
GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,DatCheesus,3,Thu Feb 19 18:12:14 2015 UTC,Maybe you guys can speak to Rich aka http://www.reddit.com/user/methecooldude  They provide the hosting and website for Team Gaki.
GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,churakaagii,3,Thu Feb 19 19:26:30 2015 UTC,A google doc would be fine for this. Translator's/Timers can post their own progress for certain episodes and /u/Rylix or someone that admin's it can set it so only certain people can edit information/add things (Timers/Translators). It would also get rid of a worry that 2 people are working on the same thing without the other knowing.
GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:05:31 2015 UTC,I had something like that in mind. I am thinking about some details at the moment to make it work.

GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,Dazpiece,4,Thu Feb 19 22:22:30 2015 UTC,I was playing around on Google while I was translating and there was a website listing broadcast dates of these skits. I'm having trouble finding it now but I believe this was listed as  early 90s.
GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,Bobblehead_IV,3,Fri Feb 20 00:04:15 2015 UTC,"Found this.  Ctrl+f for ""横になると目から涙"" and you'll find the episode.  Episode 288, from 1995, August 27.  Great job on the subs!"

GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Thu Feb 19 22:28:23 2015 UTC,I spent maybe an hour off-and-on on getting the translation right and trying to make it work in English. The ending came out of nowhere even in Japanese! Rylix will have to answer about the timing and subs.
GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,InvisibleJawa,2,Fri Feb 20 00:02:33 2015 UTC,"Longer than expected. I could extract the automatic subtitles from youtube, but I had to remove/add some lines. Then I have to retime some line, because the automatic subs aren't perfect. So that took half an hour (I have very little experience with Aegisub).  After I got the translation from Dazpiece, I had to retime some lines (lines appear a little bit longer for longer sentences) and the colors. I think that took 15 minutes."
GakiNoTsukai,2wfz2k,alterisu,2,Fri Feb 20 08:46:04 2015 UTC,"So will you time it from scratch next time? I think that might actually be faster in the end.  Like you I've also found English can sometimes be longer than Japanese. Sometimes you gotta really abbreviate the English so it can be read quickly in the same timeframe as the spoken Japanese, e.g. with contractions, ""d'you, what're"" etc.  Are you familiar with setting up keyboard shortcuts in Aegisub?  Also if it's of any help there's a site with Japanese transcripts for more recent episodes in raw text format, I think they're the TV captions for the deaf since they don't include on-screen subtitles and describe sounds (e.g. laughter). https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:o.x0.com/m+ダウンタウンのガキの使いやあらへんで"

GakiNoTsukai,2wcxoo,svipy,2,Thu Feb 19 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"You should see his ""Breakdown""-Episode where he pretends to have a nervous breakdown after an ""insulting"" remark of Matsumoto.

People were busy with their stuff. We are hoping to have part 5 done by the end of the week, if all goes to plan! Cheers for the support and patience. Team Gaki"
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,YamasakiGifsTumblr,6,Wed Feb 18 12:42:39 2015 UTC,I'm also wondering the same thing.

GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,Bobblehead_IV,5,Mon Feb 16 14:42:53 2015 UTC,Last year it was about done at this time.
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,Vurik,1 point,Tue Feb 17 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"True, but the lead translator had a bigger amount of free time. That same translator has very little free time this year due to university etc., so there might not of been a sub at all."
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Wed Feb 18 00:19:59 2015 UTC,Maybe they're waiting for their next milestone to update.  Try hitting Ctrl+F5 to reload the page from the server.
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,Bazzatron,0,Mon Feb 16 08:50:29 2015 UTC,"You know the subs used to take 6 to 9 months to complete and it was done in chunks. Be patient and check the stickie at the top of the sub. 4 out of 10 parts done in the first month is impressive. It doesn't help that there is a lot of guests that show up and cultural jokes that can easily go over one's head.   Also remember this isn't a job for them. It's a hobby, they are using their free time to do this. Let them enjoy subbing rather than being told its not being done fast enough. Also these NLB games are getting longer than they used to be. They used to be 3 hours long. Now they are 5+ hours now."
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,Dark51d3,8,Mon Feb 16 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"Asking if they're on a break is a valid question in this situation. They did 4 full parts in around 4 weeks and now there hasn't been any progress in 2 weeks.  Not that it matters if they're on a break or not, its like you said its a hobby and not a job. They can take as much time as they need, but it would be interesting to know whats going on nonetheless."
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,insectsareawesome,3,Mon Feb 16 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"I've gotten to a point to be happy when it's done. The fact that I've been able to watch each one is amazing. I'm grateful. I didn't say asking is bad. Just saying it takes time, don't worry, they finish it and it will get done."
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,Dark51d3,4,Mon Feb 16 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I have no problems with the pacing, but I'm just curious what happened.  If you're going on break, please just say so. Again, I think having 4 parts done is incredible work for the first month, but to go from that to no update in 2 weeks is just unusual.  If the team collectively has to switch priorities, just say so. I really don't have a problem with it. Really. I just want to know either way. I think we are allowed to ask, we aren't offending anyone's sensibilities by doing so. The point that I think this thread was removed entirely seems toxic to the community.  Let us ask, and if you want to take a break, do so. I'm not sure why this topic is treated like a hot potato."
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,EphemeralMemory,1 point,Mon Feb 16 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"It was just bad timing, typesetters moving house, no internet, other typesetters were then unavailable to cover. We didn't really think much of the situation at the time but it's cleared up now."
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,mickstar813,6,Fri Feb 20 21:25:54 2015 UTC,"people are just very excited about this particular event and it's to be expected. I've been on the receiving end on such impatient requests before and it kind of sucks (*I'm not part of the sub team for this, and wouldn't want to be. bless you all) but I think it's easy to understand when people don't know what exactly is happening. the first 4 parts were out very fast, that's great but also sets the pacing and heightens the viewers expectations on continously fast releases. last year the whole project took about 2 months, a very nice feat that is also tough to follow. the experiment with the subbing status page is interesting as I imagine the reasoning was people will see exactly how far done everything is, and won't have to ask all the time. however, it of course also let's people see when people are ""not working"" (i.e. when progress has not been made, not when people are actually working). as long as people are not being rude and ungrateful, expect excitement and impatient minds, most people mean nothing by it and thinking people will sit quietly by and wait is simply not realistic, take it for what it is"
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,kosmoskatten,2,Mon Feb 16 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"I understand the sentiment. But I just assume it will take usually two or more months to get it done. I remember waiting 6 months to a year waiting for it to finish. I didn't pay any money so I try not to complain. I volunteered working with middle school and high school kids for 7 years. I did it because it was fun, I just don't want the typesetters and subbers to be taken for granted for the good work they they do. I wasn't upset with people questioning the updates. Just saying it's going to take time."
GakiNoTsukai,2w1407,Dark51d3,2,Mon Feb 16 16:22:22 2015 UTC,"If they've been pushed out faster and faster every year, and we're already running up on last years mark of 2 months, I think it's entirely reasonable for people to wonder what the status is.

GakiNoTsukai,2vtv6h,xn0,9,Sat Feb 14 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"I am not sure about their reasoning, but most likely they, including the staff, want to expose Gaki no Tsukai brand as being all 5 of the casts rather than just Downtown during the 90's era.  On a side note, it is very rare to see Manzai on TV these days, most Manzai are done on live venues rather than TV. The only sure time to see Manzai on TV is during aired comedy competitions like THE MANZAI. All owarai combi on TV are usually doing something else than Manzai like from hosting shows (for super famous ones like Downtown, Cream Stew, Neptune, Summers, London Boots, Ameagari, Football Hour, etc) to being a guest MC, being a guest talent, and/or being a target for a prank show."
GakiNoTsukai,2vtv6h,i_just_comment,4,Sat Feb 14 02:15:14 2015 UTC,"They still happen, just nobody bothers to record them since they aren't as popular  with western fans as the big gameshow-type stuff like Kiki.  Remember Gaki airs every weekend and they can't have gameshows every week, if you watch it live you'll see more."
GakiNoTsukai,2vtv6h,tirakai,2,Sat Feb 14 12:32:44 2015 UTC,"I think they mean Downtown doing manzai in front of a live audience, which doesn't actually happen in the weekly show anymore. http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewforum.php?f=58  They do have the ""Costume Talk"" segment though where all of the cast sit and discuss different topics (no live audience though).  If you want to see the weekly show, check the Gaki forums. ErnieYoung from Japan kindly records it in HD and posts it there.  I think the reasoning was discussed on the Gaki forums before but I don't know exactly where, I believe it's mainly Matsumoto's preference though, he's more into directing movies and such now. I think at one point Hamada said he wouldn't mind doing it again and Matsumoto said jokily, ""That's easy for him to say, he doesn't have to organize all the material."" But don't quote me on that, better to ask on the Gaki forums because I'm having trouble finding it since it was a random comment from a talk show."
GakiNoTsukai,2vtv6h,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Sat Feb 14 14:25:00 2015 UTC,Well I know downtown stopped opening with manzai because the audience would just laugh at anything. Maybe that's true for freetalk as well?

GakiNoTsukai,2vr791,Sorenai_,1 point,Sat Feb 14 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"I've really liked other movies of Matsumoto and a huge fan of Matsumoto's theatrical work. Symbol is almost one of my all time favorites and Saya-zamurai was really fun. With a solid setup, scenario and all that.   This one though, I'm not really sure. Matsumoto likes absurdity in comedy that is a given fact but it was a bit much imho. He even said that ""he wanted to break the cinema and go all the way out"" himself on an interview. I didn't enjoy it as much as I usually do, it was too edgy (almost about to cross the line to Japanese snuff films), it was too absurd to understand the overall structure behind it. Maybe I didn't get it though. Anyways I gave it 4-5 out of 10 and that's probably because I'm a fanboy or I liked some parts of it when I watched it 2 years ago which I can't really remember now.   Definitely watch Symbol or Saya-Zamurai if you didn't though!"
GakiNoTsukai,2vr791,umutto,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the only redeeming quality is his career. Let me preface by saying that I really respect Matsumoto as a director and artist. But I think that Symbol both really shows that he has potential and is lacking in something. Symbol would've been a great short film but was a failure of a film.   I watched R100 in the cinema when it came out in Japan and I can't help but compare it to Strange Circus. If you do compare these two, you will see that Matsumoto not only stole from a great movie but he created a much weaker work.   I want to see him direct other movies but he should also be willing to accept criticism and work with more talented people to accomplish his vision. He has the name to create something great but doesn't seem to understand it himself."

GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,typesoshee,2,Fri Feb 13 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not sure either, this was their post: http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=5789&start=30#p50677  I think I've used Amara, or a rework of it, when doing English captioning work. I found it good for typing but the timing was a bit of a pain.   I actually think Aegisub is faster for timing since you can use custom keyboard shortcuts e.g. Tab to play/pause, Left/Right arrow keys to go back and forth, Shift+\ to start a line, Alt+\ to end a line. The ""Play to the end of line"" button is handy too.  But the main thing lacking for Gaki is translators, rather than timers/typesetters. So if people can type out translated dialogue on one of these collaborative sites that'd be awesome.  Someone can always download the dialogue after and time/typeset it in Aegisub. Bonus if they use Aegisub's Style Manager for the color coding."
GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying.  I guess they do it what I had in mind. I wanted to have a site where anybody can work on the subtitles similar to wikipedia or I think like Google docs. People can add their lines and timings and you have the ability to see who did what. You can also revise every change back if some mistakes happen.  That was the idea I imagined, but it seems that this discussion isn't well received."
GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,typesoshee,2,Sat Feb 14 12:19:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say not well received as well.  Maybe just initial inertia.   I'm not a typesetter so I'm talking out of my ass here, but I imagine the most tedious part of typesetting is the timing of all the lines.  If that could be crowdsourced, that would be interesting.  I think the ""design"" part of choosing different fonts for onscreen text, moving text, effects and stuff like that isn't tedious and isn't the ""bottleneck"" in finding typesetters who want to put time into the process.    As a translator, personally, the hard part isn't translating the meaning, it's translating the humor.  As a perfectionist, my fear is that in a crowdsourced translation, you're overwhelmingly going to get a translation that translates the meaning, whereas the humor might get left behind.  I'm basically just talking about the phrasing in English of a sentence and whether it's faithful to the emotion and humor in the Japanese that is spoken.  (For example, ""知るか"" that's in response to a question could be translated as ""I don't know"" or ""I wouldn't know,"" but it could also be translated as ""How/Why the hell would I know?"", ""Who cares?"", or ""Whatever!"".)  It'd still be interesting to see it happen, though.  The success of Wikipedia IMO is the existence of editors who actually give a shit about some public page about whatever, so mirroring that, perhaps a crowdsourced translation would also need a final typesetting editor and translation editor as well?    If you're serious about it, maybe you can set it up first.  Pick an episode, set it up, typeset the first few lines or minutes or whatever you can do, and then announce it here.  Someone's gotta do the first step, right?"
GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Sun Feb 15 15:59:56 2015 UTC,"Timing is tedious but the shortcuts in Aegisub really help.  Though it's for English videos, not Japanese, I typically find typing out all the dialogue to be longer than timing. So as a translator, I feel your job is always more time-consuming, even if you didn't have the added layer of translating. Which by the way I feel you're very modest about, and that's admirable. I only wish I could understand the base meaning so fluidly.  Timing is a process with no ambiguity, but translating abstract concepts such as meanings, is tougher to grasp.  That's not to say that timing is without it's bumps in the road. If there's a lot of stops and starts in dialogue, it's awkward. When there's a steady rhythm in the dialogue you can just line up one after the other. And of course there's the headache of cross-talk etc.  But honestly if you type out the dialogue, and release it, I am sure typesetters/timers can be found. For example someone was recently asking if anyone wanted any Gaki typeset on the Gaki forums chatbox. I directed them to Mickstar as he was intending to type out episodes live-sub style, I feel his raw text could be timed/typeset as full subs. http://gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&p=51211#p51211  However I don't think Mickstar is active with it at the moment, due to other commitments. So yeah, if you type it, put it out there, someone may work with it."
GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"I've read that post by mickstar, but yeah, what's interesting about that proposal is that as you've mentioned and as I've experienced, for Gaki, the bottleneck is the number of translators available, not the number of typesetters.  And that proposal is intending to sub an episode without a typesetter, just a stream and a translator.  So, I imagine, too, if he does do it, there probably will be a random internet person who typesets the raw text and then uploads it for anyone.    I think if you're good at typesetting (you sound like you are), indeed, typesetting can be done accurately and quickly.  Somewhere in the Aegisub manual it says that if you're really good, ""...audio timing 350-400 lines of dialog to a 25-minute episode can easily be done in less than 40 minutes.""  That sounds like pro-level, though.    As for translating, it depends on how ""perfectionist"" you want to be.  Mickstar's live-translating proves that it's possible to do lightning fast translation if you're looking for a ""functional"" translation.  Team Gaki's general pace of 30 minutes per 1 or 2 weeks is proof that a ""perfectionist"" translation and typesetting takes much longer (even last year's EDF took ~7 weeks for 10 parts, so that's 0.7 weeks or ~5 days per part).  In a functional translation, you would just translate ""instantaneously,"" so your speed is only limited by how fast you can type.  A super back of the envelop calculation: for ""350-400 lines of dialog to a 25-minute episode,"" let's just say that each line is 15 words, then 400 * 15 = 6000 words.  6000 words / 100 minutes = 60 words/minute, so you could theoretically translate a 25-minute episode in about an hour and half.  But if you want to be perfectionist, maybe the whole translation process takes 5 hours.  But you most likely aren't going to devote 5 hours in one day to it.  Maybe you can only devote the an hour and a half a day to it.  So while the functional translation takes a minimum of one day to finish, the perfectionist translation could take a minimum of 3-4 days to finish.  It gets worse if you can only work on, say, a weekend.  The functional translation would take a ""max-min"" of 1 week to finish, while the perfectionist translation would take a ""max-min"" of 3-4 weeks to finish.  But, all of this babbling is similar for typesetting.  If you're a pro at typesetting, you can do it in 1 day or 1 week.  If not, it might take you 3 days or 3 weeks.    But, blablabla, someone should just set up the crowdsourcing operation and give it a go.  Though I personally can't commit because I have enough on my plate, I don't think it'll be hard to find a final typesetting editor and translation editor for a final edit either."
GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,typesoshee,2,Mon Feb 16 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, thanks for the compliment! Well I haven't timed myself (timing myself on timing... haha), and like I say, that's for English videos not Japanese, so I know instinctively where a sentence ends and the other begins, and where the unspoken punctuation is (commas etc.). Japanese does take longer.  But since I've been doing bits of captioning work, I have a set number of hours I have to complete stuff in, so I had to get familiar with using shortcuts. Like you, I can't commit sadly, but I'm happy to pass on tips for Aegisub timing using keyboard shortcuts to anyone in need.  And yeah it's greatly appreciated that you spend the extra time to make a translation that has added layers, I'm waiting for all parts to be complete before watching the batsu (haven't seen it raw either), but I am certain I will get more enjoyment out of it thanks to your dedication to conveying the humor. I'm really impressed and grateful.  And yes I agree, nothing ventured, nothing gained."

GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,typesoshee,1 point,Mon Feb 16 08:39:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea, particularly for the translation side. There are so few translators for Gaki that it is in dire need of a collaborative effort. There's always a lot more timers/typesetters who volunteer for the annual batsu than translators.  I don't think it's that the discussion is not well received. Though I was hoping to see more discussion too, I wonder if there just aren't many people who can translate on here...? Outside of those already working on the batsu of course. It's a shame since you see three sub groups competing over one anime, but Gaki (outside the batsu) falls under the radar."
GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Sat Feb 14 13:23:10 2015 UTC,"Current translator here.     It's a shame since you see three sub groups competing over one anime, but Gaki (outside the batsu) falls under the radar.   Can you expand on why this is?  I don't watch anime and don't know anything about the anime subbing community.  Is it simply because there's a lot more demand (interested viewers) for anime subs, and thus also a lot more supply (anime sub translators) as well?  I'm genuinely curious.   An important ""prerequisite"" for a volunteer sub translator is that he/she is first of all a fan of the work.  You won't get an anime subber to sub for Gaki if they just aren't interested in Gaki.  I'll never sub for an anime because I'm just not into anime... unless you pay me an ungodly amount.    Are the anime subbers mostly native Japanese speakers or are they foreigners (native English-speakers) who've learned enough Japanese to understand the anime?  If it turns out that a lot of them are the latter, we might have an answer on why the subbing community is different - besides the plain and simple size difference (which may remain the most important factor).  If anime sub translators are foreigners who've learned enough Japanese, that's a huge pool to get translators from.  But if Gaki sub translators are native Japanese, that's a much smaller pool, because 99.999% of Gaki fans are just native Japanese people who have no particular ties to the English-speaking internet.    I'm wondering if translating for Gaki is simply harder because of the humor, the inside jokes and self-references (probably the hardest part to understand and translate), the speech (which can be fast, casual, and slangy), and of course the dialect (although IMO this is the least hard part to deal with).  Of the current translators for the New Years batsu on Team Gaki, 4 out of 4 of the regular translators are native Japanese speakers and one who contributed midway (Mickstar) and also did the live translating, I think, may also be a native Japanese speaker? (ethnically half Japanese? I'm totally guessing, but also don't want to doxx anyone).  That would mean that tremendously, 5/5 of all current Team Gaki translators are native Japanese speakers.  Team Gaki seriously did not find one non-native Japanese speaker to be a translator for them?  That makes me suspicious that translating for Gaki indeed may be a different animal from translating for animes, which is why for the most part, only native speakers end up doing it.  Thinking of other subbers, Shibatabread is ethnically Japanese, GodzillaRadio is ethnically half-Japanese... not sure about Tofu Panda, whether he's a native Japanese speaker or not (going on his profile on the Team Gaki site, he's Indonesian, maybe Indonesian-American).    And even if there is a non-native Japanese speaker who can translate Gaki, they have to be interested enough in Gaki.  Like, not just a passing interest.  And to have a deep interest in Gaki, you almost have to have lived in Japan for a pretty long time and most importantly, watched a decent amount of Japanese variety TV to get their humor.  Just finding Silent Library or the Chinko Machine funny isn't really enough to get you interested enough to try to translate their conversations, because their conversations in an average episode have nothing to do with head smacks, ass faces, or chinko slaps.  Their physical humor is slapstick but their verbal humor is often not at all.    I could go on and on about how Gaki is interesting, so I'm gonna stop here.  It could all be untrue and the only thing that matters is the amount of viewer interest, heh."
GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,typesoshee,1 point,Sun Feb 15 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Like you say, I think it's mainly down to exposure within the English speaking world. I've been a fan of anime since the days of dial-up modems and VHS. Gradually as more and more of it started hitting the scene, alongside the growth of the internet to bridge gaps, interest picked up.  I can't really say about how many are English native, but it feels almost like subbing anime has become a competitive thing now demand is so high. I gave up looking at reviews for subs because it was mostly ""This group rocks, that group sucks, gogo team <subgroup>"" comments.  I guess another irrefutable difference is also of course the fact Gaki is one show, and anime are many, so people can take their pick of characters. Which ties into your notion of, if they're not interested in the Gaki guys characters they're not gonna be that driven to understand them more.  About translators, yeah I think that's right. Mickstar is British, but has Japanese family, so he's bilingual. TofuPanda, I think Kazuma is the typesetter/timer, their friend did the translating.  So yeah I do think overall it's an exposure thing. I mean, it's understandable, but after the annual batsu is done with, on the Gaki forums etc., activity drops. Then next year rolls around with a flood of anticipation. Between those times, unless it's something people are already aware of, like a new Kiki, anticipation is lower.  With anime there's someone somewhere who checks out a raw first. There's that one anime they're aware of which falls under the radar or is slow to release and they just have to see it raw. Then they want to understand it better, demand grows. With Gaki, a lot of people watch the batsu raw, they're aware of it and can't wait, demand grows. I don't think as many do that with other Gaki-related stuff.  Personally when deciding on anime I rely on people translating the summaries of what it's about like this: http://static.neregate.com/2014/12/neregate.com-Winter-2014-2015-Anime-Chart-v3.jpg  Though I don't know Japanese I do watch the weekly episodes raw, because I just really like watching the Gaki guys interact. Sometimes I try to translate the ""upcoming episode"" TV guide summary to get an idea of the premise. But simply, once I got to know them better, thanks to watching the subs, it's just fun to watch them bounce off each other. There have been episodes where I thought it likely there'd be big demand for a sub, like all the retro gaming ones, but I just don't think many people were aware of its existence.  I think stuff like the batsu, Silent Library, Chinko and Kiki are set around themes that can be grasped without language, laugh - punishment, card - punishment, answer wrong - punishment, guess wrong - punishment, so they took precedent in terms of demand.   However many seem to agree that the bits in the batsu that are the best are when the guys are simply sitting around in the break room bouncing off each other. The fact people love the idle chatter in the break rooms of the batsu is a window into what the weekly episodes offer, and people enjoy it, so there is the glimmer of demand, just no where to direct it without awareness/exposure I suppose? When a Costume Talk episode rolls around I get mixed feelings, I love the guys chatting, but I just know I'm not gonna be able to fully enjoy it because I can't understand a word... But I watch anyway in case of moments like this where they make each other laugh, just like in the batsu break room: http://yamasakigifs.tumblr.com/post/93364172147/gaki-no-tsukai-1207-14-06-01-costume-talk"
GakiNoTsukai,2vrqzz,typesoshee,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:21:13 2015 UTC,"For some reason, I'm sure you've noticed, in the past half year or so, there's been a huge proliferation of uploaded episodes of Japanese variety shows on Youtube and such (often with a thick border to avoid censors).  So I think in terms of ""raws to watch"" and ""shows to translate,"" there is a huge glut or ""backlog"" out there.  There are literally hundreds of Gaki, Lincoln, etc. raw episodes out there.  So while viewer interest may still be the main factor, the variety of shows that can be translated should not be a factor (even if that variety still is much less than anime variety).    I guess I find it hard to believe that native Japanese speakers would get into a competition with other native Japanese speakers to see who can produce more and faster anime subs.  If anyone is going to get competitive and massive in that way, I think it's going to be foreigners who've learned Japanese.  I think foreigners who've learned Japanese and are into anime are more in touch with and feel a desire to be a service to/get attention from fellow foreigners who like anime.  I feel like a native Japanese speaker is more likely to not get so heavily involved in the English-speaking internet, unless they are living in an anglophile country or are ethnically half - and that group of people is relatively really small.  (E.g. {the number of full or partially Japanese people living in an anglophile country who speak native Japanese} and are interested in Gaki < the number of foreigners interested in anime and who've learned enough Japanese to understand anime).  But again, I could be wrong.   I think stuff like the batsu, Silent Library, Chinko and Kiki are set around themes that can be grasped without language, laugh - punishment, card - punishment, answer wrong - punishment, guess wrong - punishment, so they took precedent in terms of demand.    And the thing is, when you translate an episode like that, I think you'll find that a surprising amount of the dialogue actually has very little to do with the funny physical action that's happening.  Like in the Chinko Machine-type scenes, the dialogue is like traditional word play quizzes.  In Kiki, it's free-flowing dialogue with a lot of cultural references.  I'm wondering whether that kind of hurdle makes it hard for non-native Japanese speakers to love translating all that dialogue.  Hehe, I went ahead and asked this."

It's basically their job to catch on the hints and create situations where they can cause laughter.   Like the one where they go into vent at jail batsu. Even before any of the guys go there, they know there's something there that either makes them laugh or get shocked. But for the sake of television they agree to enter one by one because they genuinely don't know what's on the other side.   This is just how Japan comedy works, the idea is not to give the viewer the impression that the comedians are innocent and they seriously don't know what's happening. The whole Batsu show is build on where the staff and various other comedians, talents and actors/actresses appear and try to make the Gaki members to laugh.  EDIT: Also the show is build on the concept that staffs try to make them laugh and them not laughing. But seriously if they REALLY tried, they wouldn't laugh as much and that's going to be boring. They could simply not open drawers, not trying to make each other laugh, look elsewhere when something funny is on. But that wouldn't satisfy the viewers, for me at least, the funniest scenes are them just messing around trying to make each other laugh and opening the drawers and have something crazy happen to them."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,Radeon760,7,Wed Feb 11 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"All of the Gaki members are considered veteran, they surely know how Variety works. It's basically their job to catch on the hints and create situations where they can cause laughter.    People seem to not be able to believe this or seem to just forget this.  These guys don't need scripted directions.  They're often funniest without directions.  There are Gaki episodes (Kigurumi talk) where they're literally just sitting there talking for 30 minutes.  Give them some props and activities to do and it gets funnier.  Put them in a whole big situation or game like the New Year's batsu and it gets even funnier.  That's all they need.  A lot of the reactions and conversations that seem scripted are just ad libs by the cast.  /u/YamasakiGifsTumblr made a comparison with Whose Line is it Anyway, which is an excellent comparison.  Fujiwara and the Gaki staff are Drew Carey and the five ad lib their reactions and conversations.  These are not regular Joe Schmos grabbed off the street, put in front of the camera, and told by NTV, ""If you don't laugh during the shoot, we'll give you a prize at the end.""  It's a batsu game, a punishment game.  The point of the game is to go through the gauntlet of activities and punishments that the staff designed for them.  The point of the Gaki cast is to go through that gauntlet and then make us laugh in the process.    If a sign says ""Go through this tunnel"" and you refuse to ""because you know something funny is on the other side,"" you are not following the instructions of the batsu game, and thus you are simply failing to do the game.  It's like if you're playing an RPG and the game tells you to ""Go to this cave and retrieve the treasure.""  If you decide not to because you know there's a powerful boss in the cave so you decide to just wander around town forever instead, you are simply not playing the game.  And if a Gaki member actually tried to do this, well, Downtown/Suga/NTV would just fire that member for not being a proper comedian.    (However, I won't claim that 100% of the reactions and conversations are definitely all ad-libbed.  Some may be scripted, since that happens in Japanese TV (or TV anywhere in the world, really).  And Gaki even makes references to this, like here.)"
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,typesoshee,3,Thu Feb 12 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks, others have made the same comparison. Plus Colin and Ryan on Whose Line know how to make each other laugh, just like the Gaki cast, gotta love it.  I like your comparison too. I'm now imagining a Gaki RPG game where they go to a cave and have to defeat a giant Suga-faced boss monster."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,YamasakiGifsTumblr,5,Thu Feb 12 03:09:15 2015 UTC,"Now that I think of it, I think some people may be mistakenly viewing the batsu game as a type of reality show.  It certainly looks that way, if you've seen reality shows before watching Gaki.  But yeah, the batsu games are a lot more like a LARP/RPG mixed with Whose Line is it Anyway and really have little to do with a reality show.  In a reality show, you're looking for genuine, ""realistic"" reactions from the participants.  In Gaki, you're looking for ad-libbed comedy (Whose Line) mixed with funny, constructed situations (RPG).  Here's a good illustration: a big part of the humor of using Fujiwara extensively in the batsu games is because he is completely untrained in the comic timing and ad-libbing that is second nature to the Gaki cast.  Sometimes you're supposed to hide your intentions for the final punchline but Fujiwara fails and the cast can see his punchline coming from miles away.  Or the conversation is going in a certain direction and the Gaki cast ask for Fujiwara's response, and Fujiwara completely bombs his response.  Or the Gaki cast ask Fujiwara a leading question that's basically asking Fujiwara to ""complete this joke,"" and Fujiwara bombs.  Each time he bombs, the cast can't help but laugh because Fujiwara is basically breaking every rule of comedy they know on TV in front of a national audience while standing next to one of the greatest comedic duos of modern Japanese comedy.  The contrast between Fujiwara and the Gaki cast shows what the Gaki cast is actually doing on TV."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,typesoshee,1 point,Thu Feb 12 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"Fujiwara is a great juxtaposition. It's really impressive he's been sticking with it for so long.  Reality TV is really big here in the UK... Gaki is my escape from that!  Big Brother seems to be going in that vein, in that they trap people together and then throw random events / challenges at them with punishments if they fail. But again, the Gaki cast know better how to improvise and get the best out of a situation.  When they remade Silent Library in America and the UK with celebrities and members of the public I feel it didn't work as neither were really experienced in giving a funny reaction to things. But I doubt the Whose Line cast would be up for such a task, people take for granted that the Gaki cast get beaten hundreds of times like it's nothing, but I think most other comedians would balk at that..."

GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,nmagod,4,Fri Feb 13 06:13:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of that, and it's a given that they create funny situations. It's pretty much like an unspoken rule that they just have to go along with whatever comes up. like they don't have to open every drawer but they do.    One thing I'm not sure about though is how difficult it would be to not laugh. If you're in that situation with friends that you're used to feeding off of each other's humor, and the pressure of knowing you're not supposed to laugh, I think it would be more difficult not to laugh than you think. Kind of like the contagious yawning effect."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,yb0t,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yes it's true that if you are with your friends then every slightest silly action could trigger everyone to laugh and once you get into the mood and laugh then there's no going back, literally every silly action makes you laugh.  The thing is the show is supposed to make viewers to laugh and the comedians itself laughing usually makes the viewers laugh as well. For example all 5 of them just staring at each other silently and burst out laughing, I love simple happenings like these.  I have been watching Japanese shows for ages and big fan of Gaki but even for me, there's some segments I can't stand and definitely will skip. For example the segments with the ""elite squad"" comedians where they do all these body-gags like stuffing milk in your nose and putting pantyhose in their heads, I just can't find this funny at all. Also those quiz where if you answer wrong your face gets pushed to some guy's ass."

GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,nmagod,27,Fri Feb 13 06:12:00 2015 UTC,Without a doubt there is direction involved.  Much of it is out in the open though by the names of areas they're going to or them being similar to others from the past.
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,Whadios,8,Wed Feb 11 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"I think someone said before its directed, but the reactions and jokes are ad-lib.  In the very first 24 hour batsu game its really obvious that the crew is supposed to not share food with Hamada, but that doesn't make it less funny.  Another example is when they all tell Hosei to befriend the Alien in the Earth Defense Force batsu."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,insectsareawesome,11,Wed Feb 11 18:41:05 2015 UTC,Really? I think not sharing the food was spontaneous. It seems like something they would do.
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,ffca,10,Wed Feb 11 18:42:40 2015 UTC,"Same, it's a role-reversal. Hamada is their senior so it's expected of them to be considerate to him, they knew instinctively it would be funnier if they were to play against that. They're improvisational comedians.  With the alien thing, even without knowledge of what was going to happen, it was in the others best interest to shift responsibility onto Housei, the fall guy. Also of course though the Gaki cast are not scripted, the actors are, so the alien bee-lined for him. There's also the fact the alien spoke English and Housei has studied some English, the staff probably did that on purpose."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"My impression was that Hosei befriended the alien because the Alien pointed at Hosei specifically and told him he was hungry.  I'll tell you what was obviously scripted, though, was when Endou was ""hypnotized"" and became a pteradon and shouted OGOO at everyone."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,Hougaiidesu,13,Wed Feb 11 21:32:18 2015 UTC,As time goes I think they are more scripted. Like the Hosei moment from last episode (The tap on shoulder) looks like from some comedy.
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,svipy,4,Wed Feb 11 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"I believe the context is scripted but the comedians are not. Like in ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" when they pick scenes out of a hat, the situations they're presented with are predetermined but how they deal with it is improvised. Each of them have many years of experience in playing to certain roles, so it comes natural to them, such as Hamada's ""sadist"" angle etc.  With things like the drawers, since they've become a tradition each time, they don't really need to be told. You hear them debate with each other about not opening the drawers at all, since they know they're trapped. But they inevitably do, I guess to satisfy their curiosity and to not waste the staff's efforts.  Other stuff, of course they've got Fujiwara, their former manager, to push them around to different areas. He is scripted and it often makes the Gaki cast laugh when he can't remember his lines.  Likewise the actors hired for the show and the settings are written by screenwriters. One of which is an old friend of Matsumoto's and co-host on his radio show, so he knows how to press his buttons."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Wed Feb 11 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"Some of it felt scripted and some of the laughs are kinda forced/fake like for example at the end of the batsu games, Suga will perform/say something and they will all laugh to get the last slap."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,alterisu,3,Thu Feb 12 05:58:36 2015 UTC,"Suga is kind of a weakness for them, since they've known him for so long, kind of like when they randomly manage to make each other laugh by just sitting in the break room. In the early onsen batsus all they had to do was put Suga's face on a poster and they'd break out laughing. Now everything is Suga themed they've gotten more used to seeing his face on things, like the statues etc. But when Suga comes out in person I think it's tougher for them to hold back."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Thu Feb 12 14:16:17 2015 UTC,To some extent. Although they arguably don't even need many cues since the formula of the whole thing has been pretty much the same for years now.
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,mokkat,2,Wed Feb 11 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"It's not scripted, but they often are qcting, improvising a scene that they know the general parameters of.  Take the annual tradition of Chono slapping hosei.  Maybe it was a surprise the first year it happened, but in subsequent years he knew what was coming as soon as he saw Chono.  Some years Hosei is defiant, other years he tries to run away, some years he's just pissed off.  But it's been basically the same every year.  Tanaka's anticipation of his thai kick works the same way.  Watch the Pie throw hell game.  I think Downtown's unfair abuse of their seniority doesn't elicit real reactions from the junior comedians, but instead they are improvising and acting, and it's easier to tell since they aren't as good at it."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,frud,3,Thu Feb 12 01:16:52 2015 UTC,"It's pretty visible now, even a lot of their supposed ad-libbing seems quite practiced. I mean obviously they have to play a part and exaggerate a lot, but the current Batsu games have moved far from what they used to be. Even most of the batsu's are pretty weak (I mean seriously how hard can a foam stick hurt, I miss the old blow dart or the bamboo canes).  Regardless I love GNT :D"
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,Enigma257,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"I dunno what the sticks are made of, could be more like latex rubber. Probably hurts if swung hard enough but without leaving permanent damage which would lead to the cast having to stop it as an annual tradition (e.g. Housei stopped doing Yamasaki VS because of the burdock roots).   The build up of hundreds of consecutive beatings in one day takes its toll on the cast, e.g. Matsumoto has mentioned hemorrhoids, and Hamada I think has a history of that (some Gaki episodes show him using a cushion). Housei also said on a talk show that he gets asked a lot by people if it really hurts and his answer is ""Of course it does."" As well as saying his wife and newborn baby got a laugh at the mess his ass was in upon returning home."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,YamasakiGifsTumblr,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:34:57 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks for the response, that was pretty enlightening.  Well true, by the end of the day it must hurt, but I seriously think it is quite exaggerated. Even their comments (e.g. about the hemroids, etc.) seem so over the top.  By the looks of the black stick thingy I can pretty safely bet that it's made of foam (like the foam swords for kids). I mean the way it wobbles and it's impact potential it definitely looks like a foam stick, and trust me I have two nephews who love play fighting, it doesn't hurt at all. If it were a rubber/latex stick they wouldn't only bruise, their skin would get ruptured."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,Enigma257,2,Thu Feb 12 11:46:57 2015 UTC,"Well I think different people have different susceptibility to hemorrhoids, even without being beat on the ass. So it might not be far-fetched if the build up of swelling and inflammation were unhelpful to someone with a weakness for it. Housei, when asked about Matsumoto's hemorrhoids, said he's fine in that department (whilst the female guest next to him started blushing haha). His head on the other hand is suffering lol....  I'm not sure of the source of information but the Gaki wiki does say they used latex sticks for the Newspaper Batsu, therefore it's possible they might still be using similar material. I guess different latex products can be a bit more flexible, maybe it has a bit of give but still feels hard to the skin with a sharp full-force swing. No real way of telling though, so admittedly it's all kind of hearsay."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Thu Feb 12 14:11:36 2015 UTC,"Its staged obviously, and heavily directed, but never exactly scripted. Obviously the bats barely hurt, and they could make the show boring by not laughing or interacting with any of the obvious traps, but their veteran improvers so they know what to do to make it entertaining."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,saiferoth,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"Also since Batsu games each year use similar pattern in certain of their jokes eg. Tanaka getting mystery DVD, getting thai-kicked or Chono slapping Yamazaki or something to do with Endo and his scandals and Chiaki. So say when there's a picture send to Endo, the Gaki members could already assume it's a picture of some girl he used to date or something.  I'd say the initial reaction is genuine but the full reaction they give might or might not be real. For example Tanaka getting overly scared to the extent that he literally falls on the floor at the slightest shock. I don't know did he exaggerate or not, but I'm sure they really got shocked.   I'm ashamed to say I don't know any western comedians that well to make a comparison but I'm not exaggerating if I say that Downtown are the most influential, most popular and the most successful comedians in the Japan history (except behind Big 3)."

GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,orkel2,1 point,Fri Feb 13 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"They are mostly scripted, but not by the cast members but by the staff writers. The laugh are often genuine because their jokes often get quite meta as they know each other well. There are definitely acting parts in it too but they are minimal.  Its also worth noticing that the cast members are veterans, they do expect a joke to appear here and there but they dont know the contain of the joke. Thats why sometimes the guesses they invited could get really unfunny to first time viewers but really funny for loyal followers: to create a surprise, unexpected effect on the cast(for example, inviting their family members, exposing their private life etc..)"
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,uw_NB,1 point,Sun Feb 15 05:40:00 2015 UTC,"To add on what's already been said, an obvious example would be Endo during the Earth Defense Batsu game. He had to solve 1/2 + 1/3 =? or receive a headbutt, now even if he did know how to solve it properly he probably wouldn't and get it wrong on purpose to take the headbutt instead for the sake of the show."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,SuperstarTinsanity,0,Tue Feb 17 04:45:16 2015 UTC,You have to remember that they are all playing characters and those characters influence their reactions to certain things. I'm sure on some level it's scripted but they still do a great job of providing entertainment.  Some of my favorite parts of the batsu games are when they are left to their own devices in the waiting room. Some of the funniest moments in my opinion have been from there.
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,glemmstengal,0,Wed Feb 11 19:29:46 2015 UTC,Of course
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,JueJueBean,-1,Wed Feb 11 19:45:04 2015 UTC,I just watched the jail one where they go in the vent. They know they are gonna laugh but they agree to go one at a time? Feels scripted.
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,Baconlips12,6,Wed Feb 11 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"They know what they're there for: to be entertaining. And each of them having a go in the vent would be entertaining, so they do it. Nobody told them to do it or anything about it. What seems like it's scripted (but isn't, they're just aware of the show and their audience) is when they make lame excuses to have each of them go in."
GakiNoTsukai,2vjyhm,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Wed Feb 11 23:43:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the Prison Batsu yet (waiting for the full sub), but in the Hospital Batsu they had to go for an MRI one by one, whilst listening to each person before them getting struck out. Same with High School and going to the 'haunted' toilet. All they knew was that they'd have to try real hard not to laugh.  I think even though something doesn't seem like a good idea, they'll instinctively go with it anyway if it seems like the funnier option, they're first and foremost comedians."

And same thing goes for the part he speaks in English, he knows pretty well they wouldn't understand the joke in English, so he was playing with the suspense factor again, making them think it was some profound message in a foreign language.

GakiNoTsukai,2va91x,oolongxcha,4,Mon Feb 9 09:06:32 2015 UTC,"Also, would anyone know what day of the week they do the filming? I know it airs in Japan on Sundays, but I can't seem to find when they film so I can try to plan around it.   As far as I know they don't really film the weekly episodes in front of a live audience anymore. Back when they did talk-based manzai on a stage they did, but Downtown have moved away from that. If so your only chance may be the filming of the in-between talk segments for the No Laughing Special. That is just my idea of it though, could be wrong. It is a shame if you can't get in at the right time.  I will say though, if you want to settle for at least seeing a member of the Gaki cast live, then you could check out one of Tsukitei Housei's rakugo gigs in the Kansai region, he posts about when these happen on his Twitter ( https://twitter.com/tukiteihousei/ ).   Depending on the venue and time allowed, he sometimes does meet and greets after a show too. He's reportedly very friendly, a person visiting from France told me they shook his hand, took a photo together and had a brief conversation (in Japanese)."
GakiNoTsukai,2va91x,YamasakiGifsTumblr,5,Mon Feb 9 13:52:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what I would exactly be signing up for, but they're always advertising about applying to watch Gaki live so I imagine it's worth signing up for.  Unfortunately, I'm not in Kansai for long at all, but if my schedule allows it, I definitely will try to see Hosei's rakugo.  Thanks for your input!"
GakiNoTsukai,2va91x,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Mon Feb 9 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"Nothing ventured, nothing gained! Hope you get in.  Ah that's a shame, but maybe some of his venues are in the Kanto region I dunno. I think he moved to the Kansai region as rakugo gigs are perhaps more common there, but he is kind of pro-active about making rakugo known wider (visiting schools, attending festivals, charity events etc.).  Also maybe you can get in on a Downtown DX recording, they seem to have an audience for that series.  Anyway best of luck!"

GakiNoTsukai,2va91x,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Mon Feb 9 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"I went to a Rakugo (not Tsukitei House) once a few months ago and I found out that it is hard to appreciate it unless you know a lot of related stories that the same family/house tells. I had no problem understanding the words (some words they use are fairly old), but the references to older folklore, history and other stories from the same Rakugo house made me confused as if I don't know the Japanese language at all.  For experience, maybe it is nice, but I had more confusion than fun when I went so I can't really recommend it to anyone. But for the sake of seeing Tsukitei Housei live on stage, maybe it is not that bad to go once (maybe they have a different Rakugo style that is funnier)."
GakiNoTsukai,2va91x,i_just_comment,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"That's cool!  Traditional rakugo reminds me of Jackanory (UK series with different guests reading books). It seems there are a number of stories and though people may of already heard them, the way in which they are told becomes entertaining, so they listen again and again.  I found Rik Mayall to be a really funny storyteller, he had great facial expressions, gestures and could vary his voice well. I watched him read out the Brothers Grimm fairytales, George's Marvelous Medicine on Jackanory and telling the tales of Kevin Turvey all whilst sat in a chair. If I didn't know English that'd be boring I'm sure.  However there is some rakugo that is basically like stand-up comedy (but sitting) where the comedian relates happenings in their life or other random satirical comments on how things in the world are. This is an example of an English rakugo doing that sort of thing about ""manners in different cultures"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jb69FP4RxQ  Tsukitei Housei sometimes does this too, for example he related an incident about how he went through airport security and the metal detector went off, the guard shouted at him ""Yamazaki Outo!""  Also someone in Japan told me that before the Earth Defense batsu he made a funny comment during a rakugo gig ""the countdown to the slap has begun"": http://yamasakigifs.tumblr.com/post/65529922339/amateur-translation-by-yamasakigifs-sincere  However I don't know how often he does those kinds of things, he is pretty passionate about the traditional rakugo stories (apparently filled his MP3 player with them and bought out whole collections of DVDs!)  So yeah, it is tough (I have very very little understanding of Japanese)... Though sometimes it looks funny to me: http://yamasakigifs.tumblr.com/post/44560954457/from-one-of-tsukitei-yamasaki-hoseis-rakugo"
GakiNoTsukai,2va91x,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Tue Feb 10 04:28:11 2015 UTC,"Nice. I didn't know some rakugo houses are reaching outside Japan.   It is pretty much a mix of traditional and more contemporary stories these days (including the one I went to).  If you go to a rakugo show, unless the person is super famous, it will usually be the whole house/family taking turns telling stories. The acts are usually started with an opening done by younger/newer members and ending with the most senior's or the master's best story. The younger generations usually tell contemporary stories (like the case of Tsukitei Housei about the airport incident) while the more senior ones tell more traditional stories like (neko no sara). This brings up the point you said   the way in which they are told becomes entertaining   it is partly due to the fact that stories are passed down to younger members of the rakugo house/family.  But yeah, the thing is, I didn't have any background about rakugo when I went which is why I find it confusing at the time.  If you are interested in rakugo, I recommend a Japanese TV drama called ""Tiger & Dragon"" (link). While fictional and over the top, it pretty much portrays the life of a typical rakugo house. The episodes are written by Kudo Kankuro (one of the best show writers in Japan) so I definitely recommend the TV drama either way even if not for rakugo."
GakiNoTsukai,2va91x,TheLegendOf1900,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's not many English rakugo but I also found a few people from outside Japan who became rakugo and so can also do it in English.  Katsura Sunshine (Canadian)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Xph7AHrDs  Diane Orrett (British)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liuW8ITNYJk  I think Housei's group seems pretty small but friendly. I don't understand it fully but I think it's a branch off an old rakugo family. His rakugo master Tsukitei Happo appears alongside him on a regular show interviewing Yoshimoto comedian's for biographies, and sometimes other variety TV. His senior Tsukitei Hakko co-hosts alongside Imada Koji on a variety talk show too which Housei guests on. I haven't yet understood fully the whole story but I think Housei was very surprised to be accepted, he always cries when he talks about it.  Housei usually appears alongside other rakugo, though he did do one special solo show, Hamada's wife sent him flowers as congratulations, he handed them out to audience members after the show: http://yamasakigifs.tumblr.com/post/65160634237/amateur-translation-by-yamasakigifs-in-the-past  I don't know a lot about how many traditional stories his gigs entail since there's little TV coverage but I did find him doing 「猫の茶碗」 and more recently 「阿弥陀池」. He did a mini-interview afterwards about how many lines / actions etc. he has to memorize and such.  Thank you for the recommendation."

Some feel Hamada, Tanaka or Endo is their favourite and deservedly so too.  Though also I watch Housei's other work outside of Gaki and grew to like him more through that too, I especially liked finding clips from when he used to host a popular children's show in the 90s since he's like a big kid himself."

There is a thread linked in the main post with music titles and artists that we find along the way.  While we haven't gathered too many yet, this is one I'd reported a few days ago.

GakiNoTsukai,2v50l5,xn0,13,Sat Feb 7 23:30:30 2015 UTC,I've watched several Japanese tv shows film and my assumption is they are taking a lot of breaks (to setup) and they also cut out a lot of boring parts.  Also there are probably a bunch of retakes as well because things didn't work out and the staff asked them to redo something.    For example the food/song part for previous batsus probably went on for about an hour or so and they cut it so only good material was available.   Also notice when they come back in from the Tag segment they aren't all messed up?  I'm sure they took half an hour to clean up and rest up. So there are probably a lot of small breaks in there which don't make it to even the DVD specials.
GakiNoTsukai,2v50l5,Hashiru,16,Sun Feb 8 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"They start off the batsus telling the time, and they end them telling the time, so it's not like they're hiding the fact that it's not a full 24 hours. If my memory serves me, it's something like 9am to 2am. I don't know why you'd just claim it's half a day. You might as well claim that they film it over several days. I mean, the room with the L shaped desks could easily be on a GnT sound stage, right? If that were true, it'd be filmed on separate days.  If they're going to lie about how long it takes to film, they'd go that way, not the way you're saying. Any amateur weatherman could look at the angle of shadows when they meet in the morning and figure out whether it's really 9am, or look at the sky whenever they're outside later during the day to see if the claimed times are accurate.  However, I suspect that they probably do film it in one go, because it's the tradition of a batsu game. They're supposed to be harsh, like a punishment. If it was easy, Matsumoto probably wouldn't always talk about ending them.  Also, I guarantee that they tape more than 24 hours of footage every year. Even if they only had the cast for 8 hours (the half day you pulled out of your ass), they have tons of cameras rolling, including one on each desk, etc. You end up with lots and lots of footage. You make it sound like somebody is trying to save film or something.  It takes a long time to shoot 5 hours of material. They claim that they're there something like 16 hours, and I wouldn't be shocked at all if that were true. Every year, there's lots of bonus footage saved for later shows. There's got to be several scenes that were completely cut because they weren't as funny as anticipated. Hell, if you're going to be so cynical about the authenticity of the batsu, you'd probably think that they'd do multiple takes of many of the scenes, which would make the session even longer.  To sum up, I have a lot of my own suspicions about whether parts of these new years batsus are genuine, but it takes a long fucking time to record 5 hours of material worthy to air on TV."
GakiNoTsukai,2v50l5,kamichama,7,Sun Feb 8 01:15:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, so 9am to 2am. That's 12 hours.   uhhhh....."

GakiNoTsukai,2v50l5,Betty_White,3,Sun Feb 8 07:18:11 2015 UTC,"You reference that exact thing like 3 or 4 times in your comment.   Also, I wouldn't call it a low hanging fruit.   Shooting probably lasts at most, half a day.   That's from your original comment. I was responding with the assumption that you knew what a half a day was. If you thought half a day meant from 9am to 2am, then that changes my whole comment."
GakiNoTsukai,2v50l5,kamichama,3,Sun Feb 8 07:27:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know where your half day comes from.  In one of the batsu they put Heipo in a shack and left him there for the whole day and planned to occasionally stream (live) bits of what was going on to make the team laugh. That was cut out entirely and turned into an episode of its own.  That is pretty clear evidence that they film for a long long time.  Also from experience a ratio of about 3:1 is good for TV, so if the segment is 6 hours long I'm sure they filmed for 18 hours or so."
GakiNoTsukai,2v50l5,Hashiru,1 point,Sun Feb 8 07:28:37 2015 UTC,"It would be at least cool to see some behind-the scenes footage.

Unless we can find a staff of the show to answer this, we can only speculate and guess what they are really doing outside of the aired scenes (and those released on DVDs).  My assumption is that they are setting up for the next scene and/or taking a break."
GakiNoTsukai,2v50l5,Dark51d3,0,Sun Feb 8 17:32:53 2015 UTC,"I think what has happened is that the show started to be 24 hrs. If you watch the older episodes they actually let them ""sleep"".  But as time goes on and they they included everyone instead of half the crew, they shortened it. That's just my guess. The last one when they slept over was the police one (2006). The ""shou hei hei"" but when they are trying to sleep gets me every time."

In the Yugawara one they use a riding crop and in the Highschool one it's a shinai or a bamboo sword used in Kendo. In the newspaper one I believe they use a giant latex pencil."
GakiNoTsukai,2v1sot,TakoMakura,3,Sat Feb 7 03:19:07 2015 UTC,During the highschool batsu it looked like they were actually using those bamboo type bats. Those were the real hits that hurt   Aftet that it just looked like foam with a bit more prrtending they hurt as the games went on
GakiNoTsukai,2v1sot,Mokken,1 point,Sat Feb 7 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"I always thought they were the same material that the fake leather couches were made of a long time ago. Filled with cotton inside because they seem flexible and make a pretty hollow sound when they're hit. I don't think it would hurt much, but I'm sure it would sting for a bit after a solid hit."

Perhaps Fujiwara was wearing some prop/mask/makeup referring to something they cut out of the batsu? Or maybe he just woke up himself, and no amount of makeup could make him pretty enough for TV? Fujiwara is also known for messing up his lines. This time it could have been so bad that even the heavy editing they usually do couldn't save the scene.  If you want to get really conspiratorial; in the scenes after we don't see his face clearly until the ""graduation ceremony"", and then only in close up on his own. Maybe it wasn't even Fujiwara until after the graduation scene? This could have been done with some clever editing and voice over.  These are just wild speculations. I really have no idea. I've seen this batsu at least three times before and never even thought about it."

I gave a comment a while back here where I mentioned how I came to fully enjoy this series.  As such, one recommendation I can give to fully appreciate the series is to watch a lot of Japanese TV shows - variety shows in particular because these shows are always packed with all kinds of Japanese celebrities and talk about a lot of their personal characters.  In the Absolutely No Laughing series, these celebrities usually break their normal character which is why the Gaki No Tsukai casts find them funny. I don't know how to explain it properly, but if you find out about the celebrity from the No Laughing series, chances are you will never find that particular scene funny unless you forget that scene, get to know the celebrity and watch the scene again. This is probably because you got your first impression of the celebrity from the show.  But yes, feel free to ask about specific celebrities, I can try to explain about them and such."

The idea is that to make the audience laugh from your reactions to the various things you do in front of them. What they do is not funny (and many times over the top), but their responses are what sells their comedy. The people I mentioned about are famous for this type of comedy. If you look up those comedians I mentioned, you will see that most of the shows they show up at, they pretty much do the same things."

Hamaguchi (the other half of Yoiko) has only appeared a very small amount of times.  But other than that, I love the show. It sounds pretty awful, a middle aged man playing old video games nearly always by himself, not to mention he's pretty bad at them. But oddly enough it's great, absolutely one of my favourite shows ever. Though I can't say the show is similar to Gaki's humor in any way."

I have knew Arino before I found GCCX from another show and I easily picked it up.  Conan O'Brien has been doing ""Clueless Gamer"" on his TBS show and it has been one of highlights of the show.

Having seen some of their official interviews with the press and one of the interviews with a foreigner they are pretty different people outside of television.  Unlike American comedians/actors their personality off screen is radically different.  They will also be pretty reserved so it would suck imo.

Your title and body content doesn't really seem match well which confuses me.

GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,b4rf3r,12,Wed Jan 28 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"This kind of topic has come up before on the Gaki forums:  2010 - http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=898  2012 - http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=3603   2013 - http://www.gaki-no-tsukai.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=4725  But each year I also see many saying ""This was the best one yet!"" Like on Facebook I saw someone say:  ""Laughed my ass off waaaay before they got on the bus. If they keep this level - it's gonna be the best one yet!""  Also for any batsu that someone says is their worst (e.g. I've seen a lot of criticism for Hotel etc.) another will say it's their favorite (which when it was streamed live before the prison batsu seemed to be the sentiment in the chat from some).  So as always it's very much dependent on opinion. Personally there are things I dislike within each batsu and things I love, but overall enjoyed them.  But when I've mentioned things I've grown a bit tired of, like the round table gossip stories, I've heard from others that it is the best bit for them. So if they removed that for part of the audience, they'd lose the other.  One thing I found interesting though is that in an interview Tsukitei Housei mentioned that Matsumoto's original idea for the No Laughing series spawned from the divide between comedians and other entertainers (actors, singers, etc.). Apparently they rarely appeared on the kinds of shows comedians were on.  For us here the bits that focus away from the Gaki guys and more on the unfamiliar celebrity guests aren't as appealing. But the parade of guests is likely a proud aspect for them (hence Matsumoto's surprise whenever they get a big name on board and he asks them ""Why are you here!?""). Last year was their highest ratings ever, it made the newspapers, this year wasn't too far behind."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,YamasakiGifsTumblr,2,Wed Jan 28 21:50:38 2015 UTC,"How big are the guys (Matsumoto, Housei etc.) in terms of celebrities, if you could compare them to American celebrities' fame?"

It seems like in Japan the Yoshimoto company is really good at representing comedians and also of course Downtown have been able to turn the tables on other celebrities such as actors (having them be guests for them instead of the other way around)."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,i_just_comment,1 point,Thu Jan 29 13:57:24 2015 UTC,"I think the reason they're not called comedians, but 芸人 or タレント is because they are able to do a number of various things like TV shows, variety, comedic acts, etc.   They are still called comedians, in particular ""お笑い芸人"", the 芸人 is just a shortened form and is more generalized. タレント used to mean a wider range of celebrity (i.e. it also covers comedians and such), but it somewhat became a specific profession in the industry. タレント are more synonymous to a ""TV personality"". Matsuko Deluxe, Darenogare, Becky, Nishikawa, and Chiaki are some examples of celebrities that fall in that category. タレント people are still singers, comedians, actors, etc., but they are less prominent in those fields.  But you are correct that almost any celebrities in Japan are pretty much well rounded in any field (singing, drama, variety shows, feature films, voice acting, modelling, etc.). That includes not only local celebrities, but other foreign celebrities/talents who are now performing mainly in Japan."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,typesoshee,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it's kinda sad comedians aren't really well respected here.    The thing is, there are a shitload of shitty comedians... where the only way they can get any attention is silly one-bit ""gags,"" and then they disappear forever.  Like, they probably can't even do a decent manzai routine. If comedians like these tried to host a talk show (which is like the pinnacle of a Japanese comedian's resume)?  I think they'd die in 30 seconds.    I think the comedians who do successfully get to that level where they can host shows, like Downtown, Bananaman Shitara, Cream Stew, whatever - they're respected.  But I basically agree with you because while they're respected for their humor, I think they're mostly respected for their ability to host a show, which is a precious and powerful talent (just like it's a big deal when a Letterman or Leno retires - who you replace him has to have that same hosting ability).  Somehow, organically, the best comedians tend to get the best hosting duties.  But only the best comedians.  I think mediocre and shitty comedians get no respect because they're seen as people who just do those one-bit gags for attention.  Hosts of a show get respect, though, because you need someone who can do that, who has the ability to talk well with people on stage.  And the best of those just tend to be the best talk-comedians."

From watching Housei on other TV shows I've come across a lot of other comedians, some of which appear to delight in typecasting themselves into a particular theme or gag.

That's a rough estimate, obviously, since those are estimates deduced from the income taxes they paid (which are public) and I'm using an extremely rough 100 JPY = 1 USD conversion.  (Btw, it's even more impressive if you factor in the fact that Downtown basically only has a domestic Japanese audience whereas Hollywood stars in the US pretty much have a global audience.  Plus, even the domestic US audience is larger in terms of population than the domestic Japanese audience.)    Jerry Seinfeld is a good analogy, since many Japanese would consider Downtown to be the #1 or #2 comedian of their generation, just like Seinfeld for the U.S.  But I'd add on a ""David Letterman/Jay Leno"" thing, too, since a huge amount of their TV presence in the last 10-20 years was Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ and Downtown DX, which feature them as hosts in a talk show-like format.    Let me add, though, that Downtown is miles and miles above Cocorico and Hosei in terms of show business power/influence/earnings.  Like, miles away.  Objectively speaking, can't even compare them, really."

I follow Housei and I know that in the past he's struggled with the ups and downs of TV work. He dabbled in studying psychology and other fields of work as a backup but never felt a passion for them and so never finished each course.  Then he got engrossed in rakugo comedy, attended lots of gigs, bought entire DVD collections, loaded up his MP3 player etc. He studied rakugo for about 4 years or so under mentor Tsukitei Happo and upon graduating formally became Tsukitei Housei.  After that he moved from Tokyo back to the Kansai area (Osaka etc.) as there is a greater wealth of rakugo theatre there (his family had to move too, in the Earth Defence batsu his daughter mentions the move I think). He performs on stage to audiences which has given him more financial stability. Also a different variety of TV programs are broadcast only in the Kansai area, I think he has been able to get more TV opportunities there. Even getting called up to fill in for people which is good to see. I think in the Teachers batsu they allude to the fact he's been able to get a bigger house etc. in a sarcastic manner."

But there isn't one batsu I can say I dislike because I can think of amazing moments in each. Though it was a shame Housei was ill for most of Hospital (again for some Hospital is their favorite)."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,BlasphemousWords,3,Fri Jan 30 07:49:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think more creative ways of making them laugh solves the problem. It's often the first thing that people point to when they decide that the series has gone down in quality, but I think that it has more to do with them getting older more than anything else. To use the variety-style conveyor belt scene as an example, what did you think of the wordplay/dancing game they did in the Hotel batsu? Because in my opinion it's essentially the same thing, and I thought the hotel game with Yamasaki was freaking hilarious.   I just think that the show will wane over time and there isn't much that we can do about it. It's probably a combination of a drop in humor quality and the viewers romanticizing the older batsu games, and there can always be debate over which one is more of a factor. There's like 25+ years of weekly content from gaki, so it's only natural that they exhaust their creative resources as far as content goes. In fact, I can't really even think of a comedian or group that has done comedy on television that consistently for longer than Downtown.  I will say though, it's possible that I'm just refusing to look at the inevitable: the imminent end of the batsu games and eventually, gaki itself. It will really be a sad day when those things happen."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,i_just_comment,2,Thu Jan 29 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"Well I wouldn't say that those two examples are the same as it feels like the TV-style competitions these last no-laughing games has had feels a lot more produced and self-concious. The Gaki crew knows immediatly whats going on (as they also pointed out this year as they were entering the set) as the hotel one felt alot more fresh and sudden for our respected members.   I do totally agree with your summary though. I don't know how I can expect to be surprised every year by these series, they have done similiar things for 25 years now. But just to clarify what I am looking for, I mean segments like the sadistic doctor slapping around patients that can't move, or the Heipo apology letter have both been done before but I liked them alot and they were fresh to me then, but segments like that would be appreciated by me anyways.  To conclude, these are just my opinions and I would expect there are 5 million japanese that would beg to differ as I'm not their target demographic, but it does seem like they are milking it a bit now, thats all."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,insectsareawesome,2,Wed Jan 28 21:53:56 2015 UTC,"I will say though, it's possible that I'm just refusing to look at the inevitable: the imminent end of the batsu games and eventually, gaki itself. It will really be a sad day when those things happen.   DON'T YOU SAY THAT! When Matsumoto and Hamada retire they'll Change the name of the show to Coq-au-rico's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!! and License will become a more permanent part of the show.... It'll go on forever! Forrrreevvvver....."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,arthwyr,3,Wed Jan 28 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"like Matsumoto telling stories about Hamada and the bamkauchen (?)   It is call baumkuchen. I don't know how it is read in German, but here in Japan, we read as ""baumukuuhen"". You can buy them from 7/11.  As for the main topic, this series is really more about other Japanese celebrities appearing on this kind of variety show (just like what /u/YamasakiGifsTumblr said). At least it has turned into that direction. During new year's eve here in Japan, most people watch Kouhaku instead of others. Kouhaku is rather famous because it is jam packed with famous singers from all over Japan. In order to compete with that, Gaki no Tsukai producers probably want to focus more on variety of celebrities to gain more viewership rather than newer contents."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,megafilipe,3,Wed Jan 28 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"And the introduction of these TV-type contests with the conveyer belt seem just so forced   I agree with that, while I would normally enjoy this type of comedy/segment it doesn't really belong in the no-laughing games.  The last few years the No Laughing shows have been very similar with many segments that make it into the show each year and only minor differences. I notice time and time again that the best bits are the ones you don't expect like Endo's family singing ashita ga aru sa in the bus or Matsumoto and his blue peebag in the Hospital episode. The ""letter to papa"" segment last year was new and unexpected and it absolutly killed me.  I know its incredibly hard to come up with content for a 5 hour show, but I wish they would do more original stuff and less repeating old jokes. But well, thats Japanese comedy for you."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,toyzviper,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:36:59 2015 UTC,"Yes I totally agree. Btw, that peebag was in the Airport one if im not mistaken! Yes the letter thing was great as well, just so extremely inappropriate for the mood and everything."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,RicoValentin,3,Thu Jan 29 17:46:24 2015 UTC,"Some of the pranks have gotten brilliant, but I am getting sick of the game show segments and the opposing ""gangs"" segment in the Batsu games."
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,rti9,2,Thu Jan 29 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"im loving the new prison batsu, that bathroom joke was insane (not wanting to spoil)  the challenges on the conveyer belt wasn't really good yea"
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,eldergrab,2,Wed Jan 28 21:29:12 2015 UTC,oh man i wish they can still use the bamboo sticks they used in highschool batsu game. Hamada rips them a new asshole when he was in disguised.
GakiNoTsukai,2u04mx,TakoMakura,2,Wed Jan 28 22:31:06 2015 UTC,"I recently re-watched the Onsen Batsu where they get blow darts when they laugh. The group sitting in their room for most of the time and being forced to talk with one another is what I consider their greatest 'chunk' of each batsu game. From the Keshi-gomu, Itao, Darth Obachan, fruit basket, and more being brought to them, these traps, while they suffer through them makes this batsu game seem fresher than what has been happening the past few years. Not sure how much Suga had in making the last few batsu games seem extremely linear and predictable (meet up, bus, break room, bus, few staged events, Chono, scary maze/rescue mission) but hopefully the next one will actually be the most unpredictable one yet(now that he has retired).    Another thing that might have differentiated the early ones from the current ones is that not all of them were a part of the batsu games. Maybe this time they can have Matsumoto and Hamada be a part of the traps like they used to be instead of the entire gang going through it. Every year they could choose a couple of new members/talents/etc to join Coco-rico and Hosei. Imagine them with Rola and Matsuko Deluxe as an example with Downtown randomly popping up trying to make them laugh. Just a thought."
GakiNoTsukai,2tyytf,nextstopjapan,3,Wed Jan 28 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"Cool to hear that Endo helped Tanaka so much with his graduation project in school. Somehow unexpected, which I guess shows how different their stage persona is from their real selves."

I feel waiting until Spring each year for the batsu, is roughly like waiting a year for each New Year airing anyway. If it gets completed sooner, like last year's insanity, that's simply an unexpected happy bonus.  Plenty of other things to do and watch in the meantime."

GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,jake_lucky_masters,5,Mon Jan 26 03:21:14 2015 UTC,"2) What does the off voice say...   It says, ""zenin"". 全員（ぜんいん）First character means all/every. Second means person/participant/member."
GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,xrahmx,5,Mon Jan 26 00:49:12 2015 UTC,3) as far as scripting goes....I don't think any of the scenes/reactions are scripted but people in Japanese Variety usually have roles they play by. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'd say: * Hamada is the sadist * Matsumoto is the masochist * Tsukitei (Yamasaki) is the eternal victim * Tanaka is the depressed guy * Endo is the pervert so their actions will usually go according to this scheme. And of course since they are professionals and aim to entertain they will always do what's best for the show. That's why they will always open the drawers/play the DVD's etc. or try and make the others in the group laugh. Latter might also just be them having fun on the set ;)
GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,slappymcnutface,2,Mon Jan 26 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"Right. I really doubt that any of their reactions are scripted, but they did strive to fit their character roles and give a good reaction for TV. You will see they (usually) know when to give a big reaction, or just a grimace given the context of what is going on.   The thing about being a TV celebrity anywhere is that you know people are watching you for your actions and feelings. Sure they could probably just as easily be lazy about it and ignore the slaps, but the excitement is in the extroverted reactions. So, there's a lot of acting to it I think, but certainly not scripted."
GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,Hashiru,4,Mon Jan 26 11:32:34 2015 UTC,1) How come they went softer with the punishments?   The ass darts caused marks.  I know the physical punishments are funny but really they aren't the main form of humor.  They just add a hook or consequence that they can work their verbal humor off of so its not important that it is painful.  In most cases the fact that they got singled out to be punished IS the punchline.  Things like Thai Kick and Chono's Slap are the exceptions where the magnitude of the physical punishment is the punchline.   2) What does the off voice say when everybody is OUT?   Zei-inn Out = Everyone is Out   3) How much of it in the yearly batsu games is actually scripted?    A lot is scripted but the reactions are pretty real.  Sometimes the producers will drop in stuff that surprise the GnT members.
GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,PoetPlays,-3,Mon Jan 26 03:17:25 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why you quoted me without a comment? scratches head
GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,slappymcnutface,0,Mon Jan 26 03:27:37 2015 UTC,I get downvoted because he edited his response after I replied? What the hell :D
GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,CommanderRown,3,Mon Jan 26 12:56:15 2015 UTC,"Well I know that a lot of the reactions in the past have been scripted. If you watch some of the older batsu games, there are definitely bits where... if they're not scripted, they know exactly what the reaction and wording should be. This was the case when it came to things like Hamada not getting any of the food when they have to eat for example. As far as scripting goes now... I think that it's mostly improvised because it isn't like it used to be. They don't need to make it funny while sitting in a single room for 24 hours. They have ""traps"" and events that happen through the night to give them content and so they don't need to script it themselves.  The settings and scenarios are entirely scripted. The talents and idols they bring on as guests always have dialog and actions to perform, but often it's funniest when they deviate.  Their actual reactions are a bit forced as well... they don't take as much pain from things as they let on, but in Japanese variety comedy, that kind of acting is completely normal. If you get smacked in the head with a foam bat, you'll roll around on the ground in pain for a few minutes. That's the humor of it. Exaggeration is very funny."

You mean like during the lunch for the 24 batsu tag game? I could believe that it's scripted, but honestly I suspect it's just smart actors playing up a role for TV. Ad libbing a sitcom, so to speak."
GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Mon Jan 26 11:35:17 2015 UTC,"1) For me, I enjoy it much more when it's a lighter punishment. I mean 260-odd hits (of Matsumoto magnitude) of nearly anything will add up, and it leaves the participants more open to laugh, thus making it more fun for us.   2) That means, quite literally, all are out. It's instead of saying all 5's names. For the exact word, I'm not sure.   3) I'm mostly sure that it has never been scripted. Maybe that's my own hopes and dreams coming in to play, but that's my take.  4) Not sure, sorry!"
GakiNoTsukai,2to3nh,robot_mower_guy,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:41:42 2015 UTC,"Ass darts and hard hitting bamboo sticks really hurt a little bit but it's not extreme pain   You sound like you're speaking from experience.... xD  In all seriousness, Bamboo is very sturdy, as is Burdock root which Housei ended up with many bumps from being hit repeatedly in the VS Moriman series. That, amongst other reasons, meant he stopped doing it. So it's better not to use such methods of beating if the series is to continue.  However Housei said on a talk show once that people ask him if the punishment in the New Years special really hurts, I think his answer was ""Of course it does."" He then referred to Matsumoto suffering hemorrhoids from the build up of constant beatings.  3) A long-time friend (as far back as school) of Matsumoto's, Takasu Mitsuyoshi, is actually a writer for Gaki. He along with others write the scenarios and setups (by that I mean the stuff the Gaki cast react to). However the Gaki cast are not made aware of any of it, so their reactions are improvised. In Japan comedians actually train through exposure to react to things like hot water etc. http://www.wired.com/2012/11/ff-japanese-tv-punishment-games/"

Roughly the same people worked on Teachers which went at a slower pace due to other responsibilities coming up in life more.  If we were to go with the same people as last year there would be no translation at all because those responsibilities now take up the majority of those peoples time.  Sadly there aren't many translators for Gaki, that's why Team Gaki isn't a fixed group of people, but merely a volunteer effort who welcome in different people."

I use a rice cooker, but you can just use a regular pot as well, really doesn't make a difference. As to how people prepare it, it varies. Some let it soak for 30 minutes before they cook it, others use medium heat throughout. Here's how I do it, when I use a pot:     Wash the rice until water stays clear Ratio of 2 to 1 by volume of water and rice With the lid on, bring to a boil, reduce to low heat Wait 15-20 minutes, eat"

Every time there are hard seats set out for them, even though they already know the order to sit in, the staff has placed the blue cushion for Hamada. They're never on the buses in batsu games though. It's been so many years that it's hard to tell if it's a running joke at this point, or if what he has is a chronic condition."

They came up with using the word ""Putain"" which has several uses in French I guess. Then he wanted to get names of French celebrities that were known and some that were not as well known and his speech was basically using the word ""Putain I love _________"".  That was how he put together his foreign bit.  According to the show Matsumoto's movies apparently are being received pretty well by the people that put on these events.  The second guy is Sasaki who is a producer of all of Matsumoto's shows and for some reason the show concentrated on his ""Professionalism"" of getting Matsumoto the best meals possible.  He failed with the falafel but Matsumoto approved of the sea food.  Honestly it was kinda strange but damn Matsumoto is funny."

GakiNoTsukai,2t1pd6,glemmstengal,6,Wed Jan 21 22:27:18 2015 UTC,"By your standards, I would be sacked as a translator.  Each person has a certain role on the team and there's a handful who juggle multiple roles. Rich is one of those. Have some sympathy please, it's not like the only thing on our agenda each day is to typeset and translate for no compensation other than kindness and gratitude. (Donations do not go into our pockets, it goes towards paying for the web hosting where you can download all the videos.) It surprises me that there’s a handful of fans out there who seem to have no concept of how other people have to spend their time. Even when I have free time to spare to spend on translating, I want to go hang out with friends, go out of town, play video games, etc. I mean, do you spend all of your free time on volunteering?  I understand you’re impatient, but when there’s rent to pay, classes to go to, deadlines to meet, the last thought on my mind is, “Oh no, I’m falling behind on subbing the batsu game.”  Also, Rich is the one who even built that status website and is hosting all of Team Gaki's web content. Plus, more people to even contribute a little puts pressure off of the rest of us. Maybe you didn't mean to come off as rude, but this was pretty unnecessary. Fortunately, most of us don't care about the negative unhelpful feedback and keep going, but when a group is doing you (and the community) a favor, I'd recommend being more sympathetic and empathic.  Edit: Also, there aren't very many subbers for Gaki. If busy/lazy/inexperienced subbers stepped down, I'm not sure who would be left..."
GakiNoTsukai,2t1pd6,oolongxcha,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"I understand all that, but Rich is the reason part 2 (and even future parts) got delayed by about a week, since Hinnerk had to abandon his work and come back to typeset while all the other sections are already done translating. Part 2 could already be out by now if not for Rich. Big thanks to Rich for making and hosting the status website, but he shouldn't be typesetting if he has no experience and only delays everything. Or at least he should be put to do later parts and do them in timely fashion. While I appreciate all of your works, have even donated 10€ because of that in the past and have no right to bitch about someones voluntary work, I just had to say this, for me and my friends could be watching gaki by now, instead we have to wait another week because of a single weak link."

So yes, you and your friends could've been watching, but we also could've been doing a thousand other things that aren't subbing. If you really meant it as constructive criticism, you could have messaged him privately instead of complaining on a public forum. Are you really so impatient that you have to watch Gaki on a weekly basis? Are you going to post about your impatience if someone has some real life obligations and can't deliver their subs by the weekend?  We're not a business. We're just a group of people offering a service for a community for free because we want to. As individuals, we don't owe anyone anything and that's why subbers come and go. So we work when we can, not when people want. All I ask is that you let us handle it and be patient. Next time, if you really think our system is inefficient, contact us."

The second one is he liked 7th grade a lot.  8: Yamazaki | Matsumoto | Yamazaki | Yamazaki  9: Endo | Hamada | Me | Me  10: Endo | Yamasaki | Me | Hamada  11: 5 | 9 | 14 | 3  Around here they start copying Endo by making faces when the camera zooms and the banter is usually ""That looks forced"" or ""you are trying too hard"".  12: Wife | Ronbu Ryou | Manager | Wife  13: Moshi-Mo Box | Small Light | Dokodemo Door | Moshi-Mo Box  14: 30k | 70k | 35000 yen | ¥30,000--  During the break Yamasaki is asking Matsumoto questions (that they already answered) and he doesn't know the answers.  Yamasaki then asks a  question and Endo answers it and Yamasaki says wow you are really into Tanaka.  Endo responds by saying yeah I'm pretty into Tanaka. Then the narration says after this a mircile happens to Matsumoto.  15: Can't see answers  16: Can't see answers  17: Can't see answers  Apparently Matsumoto is on a 20 for 20 streak after the break.  18: Paris | Monaco | Los Angles | Ishigaki Island  19: Plum | Plume | Plum | Plum  20: Elephant | Elephant | Horse | Camel  At this point the narrator says another important keyword to understanding Tanaka a little more are the answer to the next questions. Those were ""Ishigaki-island"" ""sausage""   21: Tomato | Boiled Egg | Tempura | Tomato  22: Omelet | Omelet | Fried Potato |  Rice Omelet  23: Ishigaki | Ishigaki | Futagotama | Ishigaki  24: 7th grade | middle school | seventh grade | seventh grade  Matsumoto points out a lot of answers are ""Seven grade, Ishigaki-Island, sausage and when it comes to animals its Rhino.  25: Pakkyun | Hedoro-chan (Sludge-chan) | Kintaman (Mr. Balls) | Higenikibi (Pimple-stache/Pimple Mustache)"

GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,Otviss,47,Sun Jan 18 19:14:56 2015 UTC,"Despite Hosei being made fun of for liking sweet things and generally being the most childish of the group, Endo has a very class-clown persona that can be pretty endearing. He's very good at making absurdist jokes and then remaining absolutely in character or straight faced, similar to Stephen Colbert.  He doesn't often get the chance to shine since Cocorico remain somewhat secondary to Downtown, and Tanaka's Thai Kick, sudden shock and other woobie abuse gags get more attention out of those two, but Endo's ability to play things absolutely straight is also what makes his agony when his family and his perverted escapades get brought up so believable and entertaining."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,JanusTheDoorman,12,Sun Jan 18 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"Tanaka is my personal favorite. He's like the Donatello of the group. Hamada is Raph, Matsumodo is Mikey, and Endo is Leonardo, Hosei is Casey Jones. It's a comdey group, so the heirarchy is reversed, but the character archetypes hold up pretty well.  Cocorico are really there to add variety to the group, so it's always refreshing when they get the spotlight. Matsumodo-Hamada's Boke-Tsukkomi relationship is perfect, but by now, even their somewhat unique twist on manzai has gotten a little predictable. The added twist of Hamada's sadistic side adds to it, and Hosei usually plays into that. It's a subtle part of the tsukkomi's role in that by constantly correcting the boke he's showing a sort of affection, looking out for his hapless friend, and Hamada's sadistic twist could damage that aspect of his dynamic with Matsumoto, but by having Hosei do things that make the audience genuinely thing ""What the hell is he doing? Did he think that was funny?"", rather than the ""Ha Ha, Macchan's so silly sometimes"" reaction that Matsumoto goes for, it's gratifying to have Hamada express the audience's displeasure with Hosei when if he did that to Matsumoto, it would come off as overly cruel and something of a betrayal of their friendship.  Therefore, those three form the core of most of the interactions - Hamada is really the center of GnT, being an outlet for the audience's reactions to Matsumoto's clownishness and Hosei's ""unfunny tag-along"" character, even though Matsumoto is probably the more flamboyant and attention attracting. Hamada play's a role similar to Kyon's in the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, being a cypher the expresses the the expected audience reaction, validating us.  Cocorico are sort of like comic relief characters, even though the whole point of the show is comedy. Their bits are more self-containedly funny, not requiring as much interplay with the others. Much of, for instance, the Batsu games would proceed the same if they were pop-in characters like Jimmy Onishi - except instead of showing up and being stunningly inept at something, Endo would show up probably as a straightlaced salaryman who suddenly has the dozen strippers he owes money to burst in on his family, and Tanaka would be relating some deeply heartfelt story about his love for animals which inevitably ends in a pun or a rhyme with Thai Kick."

GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,itaaaaaiiii,8,Mon Jan 19 03:52:00 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite episodes is where Endo auditions for an American movie, where the director and all the cast interviewing him are all clearly Gaki members. The crux of the joke is that everyone is obviously in on the premise, but everyone also plays it 100% straight which is what makes it funny. I think Endo has a really understated sense of humor that works best when he keeps it straight-faced."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,DogToggleSwitch,1 point,Mon Jan 19 13:14:59 2015 UTC,Is this subbed somewhere? I'd be interested in watching this.
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,LostMahAccount,6,Mon Jan 19 03:06:21 2015 UTC,perv   Endo's charm is that he plays a great straight man but he is thoroughly perverted and his messed up love life gets dragged into the show.  I'm not sure he is my favorite but his Edo period trial in the Earth Defense Force game is probably my favorite scene.
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,Danadin,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:34:59 2015 UTC,"Also that he's very ""academically stupid"""
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,SuperstarTinsanity,3,Mon Jan 19 07:21:06 2015 UTC,Endo has a very class-clown persona that can be pretty endearing.   I believe in one of Downtown episodes where they visited where they grew up. Endo mentioned he was the class clown when growing up.
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,short_lurker,3,Tue Jan 20 19:28:01 2015 UTC,"Very good, thank you. It's always nice to see a fellow gaki fans take on something you know so little about."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,typesoshee,1 point,Sun Jan 18 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"Nothing much new to add, just echoing that Endo's style is very deadpan.  I'm sure people have noticed how in some episodes, when they're doing a satire, the cast, especially Matsumoto, can't help but laugh even though they aren't supposed to (they'll turn their heads away from the camera and bury their faces in their elbows to try to minimize and muffle their laugh).  Endo is usually the best at staying not laughing during these situations (well, Tanaka is as well, but I find Endo's performance during those episodes to stand out especially well)."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,Vertigo666,86,Sun Jan 18 21:13:42 2015 UTC,Because of his propensity for Frisk
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,MisjahDK,11,Mon Jan 19 04:30:53 2015 UTC,"That was actually pretty hilarious, especially when he kept using it in Absolute Tasty."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,Vertigo666,17,Sun Jan 18 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"And how he kept straight-faced, insisting it would make for a great result. I also forgot to mention Shikoku Dynamite"
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,coolguy9001,3,Sun Jan 18 21:07:07 2015 UTC,where else does he say/show he likes it other than absolute tasty
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,TheLegendOf1900,1 point,Sun Jan 18 22:22:41 2015 UTC,The pizza episode SUCKED. the best part of frisk is when he unveils it and everyone reacts. In the pizza episode they skip the reactions and just show a frisk pizza. Totally disappointing.
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,draxvalor,16,Mon Jan 19 01:22:03 2015 UTC,"he strikes me as somewhat of the straight-man of the group, a role that is needed in every large comedy group imo."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,ncolaros,11,Mon Jan 19 05:59:19 2015 UTC,This. He reminds me of Michael Palin. He makes everyone else better.
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,Zephsace,6,Sun Jan 18 20:01:58 2015 UTC,Very good comparison. I understand it better now.
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,SaulKD,2,Sun Jan 18 21:00:38 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I can see his role. The part he plays in the group. But as a favorite. It's hard to imagine eh?
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,Derpy2015,2,Sun Jan 18 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"This. It's when he's beaten or caught that makes it the greatest. He's not the funniest, but this makes it one of HIS funniest moments."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,Joshopolis,9,Sun Jan 18 21:12:20 2015 UTC,I like that he has been able to transition into a different character in the Gaki shows.  You need to keep in mind that as part of Cocorico he is the tsukkomi but he can hardly play that role in the Gaki group because Hamada is around.  It's not a problem for Tanaka to continue to be the same persona because more clowns for Hamada to beat on is not a problem.  I appreciate that Endo has a harder role to fill in Gaki by being both a straight man and letting his personal life be the constant source of so many humiliating jokes.
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,acommunistspy,9,Sun Jan 18 19:52:07 2015 UTC,It's hard to pick a favorite but I really appreciate endo when he's pretending to be serious like in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPksTLiDBxY
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,insectsareawesome,8,Sun Jan 18 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"I like endo, i like endo,  endo, i love you."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,tsukkomigorilla,7,Sun Jan 18 22:05:33 2015 UTC,My favourite is the entire cast of Gaki no Tsukai.
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,YamasakiGifsTumblr,3,Sun Jan 18 19:22:07 2015 UTC,"I like the fact that Gaki raised him up to the star he is today, and tears him back down gleefully. I don't know if this is because they feel responsible for his behavior or because they believe that he hasn't returned their investment in him, but the Edo period trial and the Egashira ass cannon was one of the realest, most painfully humiliating things i've ever seen in my life. Although both hamada and yamasaki(?) have had revealed affairs, this could only have been done to endo."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,thebigread,3,Sun Jan 18 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"Almost like Hamadas sensei-junior relationship with tanaka. After watching the ""Hamadas 50th birthday"" video. Where tanaka explains how hamada gave him money for shoes... or when he gave that gift card to hosei. It tears me up to see such a generous attitude behind that predetermined superstitious role they've been given.  I can imagine that endo is just treated in a similar sense. Being raised by the gaki group overall. But foremost by Matsumoto and hamada as senpais."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,tsukkomigorilla,-1,Mon Jan 19 03:58:05 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that was all just acting and nothing of that is real. Except the gift card maybe

GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,IAMyourSOLIDturd,2,Sun Jan 18 21:19:10 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell. In one of the batsus each of them are called out on a secret (in a lineup by an intense woman, sorry can't quite remember). Housei's secret was that his wife punished him in the balls for being unfaithful. But I don't think they actually specify what he did, just what his wife did in response. So he could of been unfaithful in a number of ways, e.g. flirting etc.  He's had some disagreements with his wife, but they're very close still. In the Hamada Birthday episode he mentioned that on his wedding day they had a horrendous argument but a gift from Hamada made them laugh together and they made up. In a Drunken Tavern episode he also mentioned leaving the house after an argument.  But they recently had a son so though they don't always see eye to eye they're committed. Also in the 24 Hour interview episode he mentioned how much he thought of his wife whilst apart."
GakiNoTsukai,2sursw,xn0,2,Mon Jan 19 17:15:42 2015 UTC,That was in the airport batsu IIRC.

GakiNoTsukai,2swzyo,Bits_n_Bobs,2,Mon Jan 19 07:52:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's during the Yugawara no laughing batsu. I can't remember when for the life of me. I remember Hamada getting hit in the crotch a couple times pretty early on if that's any consolation, lol"
GakiNoTsukai,2swzyo,Aurelyn,1 point,Mon Jan 19 08:08:37 2015 UTC,Its thre Yugawara batsu game. 1st episode i think. while they're walking up to the temple. then another time when it was the c3po messing with them. BUt both times are Hamada and not Tanaka

GakiNoTsukai,2swzyo,jhorid,1 point,Mon Jan 19 09:59:50 2015 UTC,"Yugawara. They used riding crops that year, which the punishers apparently had a hard time keeping consistent on where their hits landed.  I think he got three shots to the boys in a row.  Hamada took a direct shot to the crotch in this batsu game, too.  I think one of them was trying to punish Tanaka.  Hamada, who was standing to the side with Fujiwara, got nailed in the crotch as the punisher drew back to hit Tanaka.  Just a random aside there...  Maybe that has something to do with why they went with longer punishing tools with every no laughing game onward.  I don't know.  Just an observation there.  Another random aside - in the Onsen batsu with the blow darts, can you imagine if one of THOSE went off target and landed in a testicle?"
GakiNoTsukai,2ss0ed,Zephsace,4,Sat Jan 17 23:07:30 2015 UTC,"When I see his face, I can't help but to think about his role in the airport drama and laugh.  ""Doke doke dokeeeee~"""

GakiNoTsukai,2spg7q,billylooser,19,Sat Jan 17 09:28:30 2015 UTC,"I don't get why some Gaki fans try so hard to force a connection between Gaki and Jackass. Jackass' origins are rooted in skateboarding culture and literally, desperation and stupidity. Johnny Knoxville was a failed actor who thought it would be a good idea to test self-defense products on himself for a magazine article. Steve-O actually went to clown college -- which, let's be honest, most of us wouldn't have even guessed was a real thing.   I'm sure it's possible the Jackass crew has at least heard of Downtown and Gaki (they went to Japan to film parts of the first Jackass movie), but to claim anything else as fact would be a stretch."

GakiNoTsukai,2spg7q,gibsonmiata,3,Sat Jan 17 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"Nice article.  My IMHO thoughts:    I have no authority to say this, but I firmly believe that Spike Jonze and the co-creators of Jackass were initially inspired by Matsumoto and Downtown.    Not necessarily.  There is PLENTY of similar wild and physical comedy on Japanese TV.  Just Youtube search ""Japanese game show"".   There is no Jackass without Downtown 's masterminds Hitoshi Matsumoto and Masatoshi Hamada and their contemporary Beat Takeshi.   Yes, Beat Takeshi had a HUGE role in making that sort of crazy physical comedy popular on Japanese TV starting in the '80s.  I was impressed to see this mention in the article.     But since 2007, Matsumoto has also embarked on a new facet of his solo career, directing some of the most breathtakingly inventive feature comedy films the world has ever seen. Big Man Japan, Symbol, Saya Samurai and now his fourth film R100 are all masterpieces   This would be a minority opinion.  I'm not saying it's wrong, just saying that at a glance, the broader movie-critic sphere, both Western and especially Japanese, wouldn't agree with him there.    IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035719/?ref_=nv_sr_1  Metacritic: http://www.metacritic.com/person/hitoshi-matsumoto  Rotten Tomatoes (surprisingly high): http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/hitoshi_matsumoto/  Eiga Judge (a random Japanese movie review site I googled): http://www.cinemaonline.jp/?s=%E6%9D%BE%E6%9C%AC+%E4%BA%BA%E5%BF%97"

GakiNoTsukai,2spg7q,Derpy2015,1 point,Sun Jan 18 12:27:50 2015 UTC,"Tokyo Shock Boys:       The Tokyo Shock Boys (東京ショック男の子) (電撃ネットワーク; Dengeki Network) is a Japanese group of five men who perform dangerous and crude stunts. In 2012 they announced on the Dengeki Network 'Day long takeover' (一日中買収) that they had a new member only known as (ジョシュア) or the Latin 'Joshua', who has now been seen to be 'Baggott' (袋ゴット) as his nick and brand name suggests from products.  The group was formed in Tokyo in 1990. The Tokyo Shock Boys have a huge cult following in Japan and have appeared in many other locales, such as Australia, Canada, Germany and Scotland in the United Kingdom.  In 2006, they made appearances in Japanorama, Adam & Joe go Tokyo and the Dirty Sanchez movie. However, their shows are viewed as having more 'magic' stunts rather than painful ones. This was proven in Dirty Sanchez: The Movie as the Tokyo Shock Boys refused to do a show with Dirty Sanchez due to the fact they viewed their stunts to be too extreme.  The members of the group are:   Gyuzo (ギュウゾウ Gyūzō) Danna Koyanagi (ダンナ小柳 Danna Koyanagi) a.k.a. ""Buns of Steel"" Sangojugo (三五十五 Sangojūgo) Nanbu Torata (南部虎弾 Nanbu Torata) Josheu Baggott (ジョシュア Joh-shwah)   On volume 2 of the manga Yu-Gi-Oh!, when asked to slide one's foot inside a shoe with a scorpion, Yugi, Jonouchi, and Honda respond, ""Who do you think we are, the Tokyo Shock Boys?""  They have since become a huge success. This is due to the huge range of products the Shockboys have now released. These span from spoof items such as 'Baggott's Bean Pie' to actual action figurines of the five members. The success is thought to be due to new member 'Baggott' having a close relationship to famous actor Nicolas Cage.

GakiNoTsukai,2sks4k,SgtMcBadass,2,Fri Jan 16 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"I think improv is the right idea but personally I think GnT type of humor seems to be more along the lines of Conan O'Brien and other late night hosts.  I think Conan's humor is the closest to GnT especially his physical humor (i.e. what GnT refer to as Gags).  Especially when Conan's jokes fall flat (suberu), his reaction and efforts toward bringing the laughter back to life off a failed joke reminds me soooooooo much of Matsumoto when his comedy falls flat.    If I were to pick a no laughing USA it would be from the late night TV hosts like Stephen Colbert, Conan, and Jimmy Fallon.  Maybe throw Andy in there as well and Norm McDonald since he has great chemistry especially with his dead pan humor."
GakiNoTsukai,2sks4k,Hashiru,2,Fri Jan 16 02:14:47 2015 UTC,I'd rather not have the batsu games come here as I think it would be turned into something similar to what happened with Silent Library.
GakiNoTsukai,2sks4k,Iggybrows,1 point,Sat Jan 17 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. Colin and Ryan are way past that time, and quite frankly I don't think they'd agree, alongside with Wayne who, I feel, will be out of his comfort zone. The guys have always been up to entertainment as long as it involves a stage and a crowd, not physical pain and strenuous activities.  The best cast to do it would be a cast of young and foolish adults. People who want to have fun, and also have a passion for comedy. People who are dumb enough to take on the risks, but smart enough to make it into a comedy instead of a documentary of a bunch of guys sitting down.  And last, but certainly not least, a cast of individuals who are comfortable among each other and have great chemistry. Not friends, but close co-workers. The best possible group would probably be the Jackass Crew....but, the truth is, Jackass already does their own thang. Even though they'd be the best possible group, they're just not comedians really. Just dudes doing stupid pranks and outrageous crap.  You can't keep a Jackass coped in a room without him acting rowdy.  The next group I can think of, which, again, still won't work just because this is a stretch, would be Achievement Hunter/Rooster Teeth. I think they have a bunch of interesting and lively bunch of people who could, not only be creative enough to make wild pranks, but also entertain the audience. While not comedians, they certainly aren't unfunny.  I think they'd be perfect, but good luck trying to pitch something so obviously expensive. And something that's so risky that it will most likely fail because they will change several things in editing in fear of being too ""alien""."
GakiNoTsukai,2sks4k,KachingaSquids,1 point,Fri Jan 16 04:34:46 2015 UTC,I've thought about it because they're both good at improvisational comedy but I doubt they'd ever agree to it because it's not really what they trained for. In Japan comedians are actually trained through exposure to react to things like hot temperatures etc. The Yoshimoto company is a big driving force for the comedy industry in Japan. http://www.wired.com/2012/11/ff-japanese-tv-punishment-games/all/
GakiNoTsukai,2sks4k,THECapedCaper,0,Fri Jan 16 01:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'd kill for an American Batsu. Let the Jackass guys take it on, I don't think the Whose Line cast could do it based on their age and style, but they could definitely whip up a sketch that could bring a ton of punishment."
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,Mattaconda,10,Thu Jan 15 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for those words and for sharing your story.    As for Matsumoto, he's been saying ""I don't want to do these New Year's batsu games anymore"" half-jokingly for some time.  Yet they keep going on.  But I think his own age is a factor for Matsumoto regarding the physicality of these games.  If they make a change to accommodate for his desire to not do it, it's possible that (at least initially) it won't be a complete stop and abandonment of it (in terms of money-making, relevance to Japanese TV, and the continued existence of Gaki as a program, the New Year's batsu is huge).  They've done ones where 1 or 2 of the cast had major ""behind the scenes"" roles (although that was quite in the past) during the batsu as opposed to playing the batsu game itself, so they could arrange something like that.  Who knows.  I think the chance that they wind down in the next few years is pretty realistic, but they'll probably announce it beforehand, like ""The next New Year's batsu will be the last one"" instead of just announcing in the middle of the year, ""No more New Year's batsus from now, can't do it"" like that."
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,typesoshee,1 point,Thu Jan 15 09:41:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's as physically demanding as they let on. The first few where they even had to stay in overnight and were hit in physically taxing ways is nothing to being hit with a foam bat. This makes me assume that his tongue-in-cheek moaning about them is also a put on.  The show is HUGELY popular, and if nothing else I think he'd most likely stop doing all other aspects and shows rather than this. I know of several celebrities who often come out of retirement for annual or semi-annual specials. I don't know why this would be any different.  When they do stop (everything comes to an end eventually), I assume that even then their shoes will be filled by other comedians. I don't think people are tuning in just because they're (Downtown) are a part of it at this point, and the slapstick will still be funny regardless of who is receiving it."
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,PoetPlays,3,Thu Jan 15 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"We're all speculating, I suppose, but still, I respectfully disagree with your points.  They've said a few times that the hardest ones were the earlier ones.  The tag game was the hardest physically.  In terms of pain, the blow darts were the most painful, and you can tell that it got less painful until the foam bats came to stay (I think from the police one).    I think Downtown, especially Matsumoto, because of age, is at a point in their careers where they're looking to do what they want to rather than what's expected of them.  I think it's quite realistic that Matsumoto may unilaterally decide to step away from the New Year's batsu at some point, simply because he has other interests and is getting physically tired.  Downtown is a huge part of the draw of the New Year's batsu.  The fun of seeing a bunch of other popular comedians throughout the whole show is definitely a reason why people might bother tuning into this show on New Year's eve rather than Kohaku Utagassen, but really, the show lives and dies with Downtown.  If you completely replace Downtown with some other comedians, I think the New Year's batsu ends (the regular weekly Gaki might survive for a while but I think that existence becomes dangerous as well).  It's not the slapstick that creates the lasting and broad viewer demand, it's verbal comedy."
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,typesoshee,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:43:20 2015 UTC,"You say you disagree with my points and then immediately agree with one? eh...  Either way, people behave like Matsumoto could drop at any moment and as though he has one foot in the grave. He's only 51. He's nowhere near retirement age, and like I suggested, the current batsu games aren't exactly physically taxing to a person of any age. Yeah, he's absolutely in his right to want to stop doing something if he doesn't enjoy it, but I haven't seen a single solitary piece of evidence to suggest he actually dislikes doing the job that he does beyond some tongue-in-cheek humor about it.  If they're (the entire group) feeling tired about anything it's not because of their age or their physical health, but because of the huge schedule they have to maintain. Literally being ""on"" for hours upon hours of every day, moving from studio to studio is what would be difficult, which is exactly why I said it was realistic that he'd stop doing all other aspects and stick to a smaller schedule such as doing specials.   I agree with you that they have a draw to the New Years specials, even for nostalgic reasons, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work without them. I know that I for one would still tune in, and I for one would still have a great time watching the cameo appearances and traps that appear. This is not their manzai. I don't tune in to watch the ""verbal comedy"" between them as I would in other shows. The batsu game formula is entirely different than what Downtown is specifically known for in my opinion. Even if it was for the verbal comedy, to suggest that even some of the up-and-coming comedians in Japan can't compete on their current level is preposterous."
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,PoetPlays,2,Fri Jan 16 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think I agreed with any of your points, but it may be because this   The first few where they even had to stay in overnight and were hit in physically taxing ways is nothing to being hit with a foam bat.   is confusing.  I interpreted it as you saying that the earlier batsus are easier because they are ""nothing"" compared to being hit with a foam bat.  I suppose what you meant is the reverse.    It isn't about retirement age or dropping dead.  It's about age and the physicality of the comedy.  Look at any other big comedians who are aged 50 and see if they do the physical comedy of the New Year's batsus.  Matsumoto can do comedy past the age of 70, but it isn't going to be doing the kind where you get your ass smacked for 18 hours.   I actually recall hearing Matsumoto say that he goes to bed around 10PM everyday these days.  I think his stature in show business is high enough that he can decide his own schedule (and everyone else has to work around that schedule).  The one thing that isn't in his control is the New Year's batsu because it's such a huge production.  I still think it's realistic that he'll sacrifice the New Year's batsu before he sacrifices other things he wants to do.  Your point that things get brought back just for New Year's specials is true, but I think Matsumoto can be quite unpredictable.  I think Hamada doesn't mind doing all of these things, though.  I think the verbal comedy that happens in between the physical comedy is key in these batsu games.  There are definitely comedians who can do great verbal comedy, but their styles can be very different, and might not work here.  If I were to personally replace Downtown, I'd go with Ameagari... but really, Ameagari's New Year's Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende has no where the draw of Downtown.  And anyone bigger than Ameagari I think would really hesitate taking the role since it would feel weird for them to try to fill Downtown's shoes, since Gaki and Downtown are synonymous.  I don't know, but in any case, I hope Downtown keeps going."
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,typesoshee,2,Fri Jan 16 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the physically taxing part.  While they might not be taking hard shots anymore, they are shooting for a very long time.  I don't know how old you are, but having to do anything, even with breaks, for the kind of hours that they go, is very taxing."
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,victortrash,5,Fri Jan 16 08:58:05 2015 UTC,Personally I thought he was just having laugh when he said about how wants to stop. At least that's impression of the reaction from the rest of Gaki gave. I'd have thought it would've have been a bigger announcement if he was actually thinking of stopping but who knows what the next year will bring.
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,Archreact,4,Thu Jan 15 07:32:40 2015 UTC,"Well Matsumoto is reportedly bored by comedy and the stifling restrictions and repetitions in todays japanese TV, and he said in the past that ""its time to graduate from comedy"". So there is a very real background to the jokes about retiring and stopping Downtown."
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,xn0,5,Thu Jan 15 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"I can not stomach the variety shows they have to go on, the ironic part is how they call them variety shows but they all feel the same"
GakiNoTsukai,2shn8q,glemmstengal,3,Thu Jan 15 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"There will most likely be a Batsu next year since they are close to the 10th anniversary (full cast NL-batsu-game).  I just don't see them missing out on a chance to celebrate that.    I know people like to say Matsumoto is tired of comedy but I don't think they understand that to this person comedy is his art... his craft... not a job.  Most people don't have a craft or art and can't imagine what that means to a person.  In everything he does he finds comedy, he'll even go to sleep listening to Japanese Rakugo and even in regular private conversations he always has a punchline.  Comedy is to Matsumoto as Sushi is to Jiro.  Its something he will do until he can no longer do, he just lives and breathes it.  I doubt he will ever quit comedy, he might retire sometime but he'll be making jokes and delivering punch lines in one for or another until he can't.  The no laughing games are physically demanding and at some point you just can't expect them to do it anymore.  I don't know when but I doubt I would see them doing it at the age of 60.  However they could change the format to where Matsumoto and Hamada are giving out orders (like the older Batsu games) and the younger comedians are doing the 24/hr no laughing.  That is entirely possible.  Like you I've spent a good year filling my life with GnT and other spin-offs as it has given me calmness and laughter when nothing else would.  I've branched off and found that Lincoln as well as Gotsu-EE-Kanji are similarly fun to watch.  You might check them out if you can find them subbed, some of the humor doesn't require subs too.  But I think it would be a surprise if they didn't have no laughing next year... again its the 10 year anniversary for NL after this one I think they will at least get to 10."

The film also profiles Jiro's two sons, both of whom are also sushi chefs. The younger son, Takashi (隆士), left Sukiyabashi Jiro to open a mirror image of his father's restaurant in Roppongi Hills. The 50-year-old elder son, Yoshikazu (禎一), obligated to succeed his father, still works for Jiro and is faced with the prospect of one day taking over the flagship restaurant.

Why not make a post commending those who are grateful, and showed you guys gratitude know what I mean? Now this sole loser gets the attention for being negative, why give him the pleasure?"
GakiNoTsukai,2s5b3m,imnotlegolas,2,Mon Jan 12 15:08:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are saying to not take it seriously and to not feed the troll. We're not taking it seriously, we're still going at the same schedule and not changing it for this. I think we're all aware that there are assholes out there in the world and the internet makes it easier for people to have no filters. Still, it's just dumb. Please don't waste your time and our time with this. We just read it and go, ""What a dick"" and then go back to doing what we were doing. None of us think, ""oh noez, we need to translate and typeset faster!!""  Also, Rich didn't mention this, but this perpetrator did this twice.  Anyway, the compliments and encouragements vastly outnumber the asshole comments. But just a note, haters are gonna hate and it's not going to get the subs done any faster. Thanks to those who aren't being an asshole and extra thanks to those who send words of support and money!"

GakiNoTsukai,2s5b3m,KachingaSquids,2,Mon Jan 12 21:35:08 2015 UTC,I know Japanese to the point where I could translate things very quickly... I did translate a manga for a friend and it was excellent work but it was ALOT of fucking work.... for free to boot....  So I feel like I know what these guys are going through.  First you gotta translate which is easy but you go back and read what you translated and it doesn't flow like the Japanese version so you sit there and wrestle with the dialogue until you capture the same feel.  That is something even a fluent person can't do unless they have a good cultural feel for both native languages.  I remember seeing some Team-Gaki subs where they actually reordered a few sentences to get the feel right.  So you are getting quality subs that is for sure and they get better every year.  Second is the editing.  Putting in text and effects is time consuming.  I imagine for a television show or movie you have to even consider the timing of how much dialogue someone can read while its up there and figure out how to present that best.  I know it must suck to have to wait but you gotta appreciate the effort that goes into this work... People that do this type of stuff on their own free time are gems.

They were probably brought up that way and have no idea how hurtful they are being. That's where we should place our pity, not our anger.  That being said however, I would probably still take it up with Paypal. People like that shouldn't have the capacity to abuse a service like Paypal. If they had just sent it in an email, you can mark it as spam and move on with your day... but using Paypal in order to send hate speech has got to be a violation of the Terms of Use somehow.

GakiNoTsukai,2s3h22,PoetPlays,2,Mon Jan 12 07:28:16 2015 UTC,"If I'm to take a guess... and I could be very wrong, but this is just my opinion: The kiki series is probably one of the last things on the list of things to take on and transcribe. If you've seen one episode you've seen them all. The expressions and comparisons they use are basically the same in all of them, and if you take the time to listen as you read carefully you'll catch on to them, even as a non-Japanese speaker.  The things you'll miss out on the most are the personal jabs they make in between tastings more than anything else, but again... since most of the show can be enjoyed with a basic understanding from previous episodes, I don't think it's at the top of anyone's list.  Again, I say that as my personal opinion as I'd much prefer other more complex dialog to be translated than to have something I can pretty well understand anyway take priority."

I've done some translating myself for a similar Korean show with a large cast, and for it to take over 7 days for someone to do a single 10 min block is beyond slow.   Don't get me wrong, i appreciate the work and have donated to them every year for these, but its a little odd the translating took so long."
GakiNoTsukai,2s27g9,Venomdeathninja,3,Sun Jan 11 15:55:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed it too, but I wasn't going to say anything out of the fact that I don't know what's going on behind the scenes. I noticed last year's Batsu game was actually done a week after it aired in Japan.   Again, I don't like talking as if I know what's happening, so I don't want to say something like ""they're being too slow"" or ""how hard could it be?"".

GakiNoTsukai,2s27g9,BurntJoint,3,Sun Jan 11 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It doesn't bother me because it's not going to change the pace of my translations, but I just hope that it sheds some light that leads to a better understanding.

Not 7 days... maybe more like 30-40 minutes.. however that's without the language gap and without the communication between people needed.  I'm sure a highly motivated individual could get a huge section done if they're willing to sink a ton of their time into it, but that's just not what's going on. From what I've read on the gaki forum, they have reasons for not doing just that."

It has a lot to do with quality, but also with free time.  The subbing is definitely taking longer than previous record year, but it doesn't matter as long as it's quality.  What grinds my gears though, is ""Translating Done"" on the gaki status page. Its been that way for a long time now, yet one still can't download the subs. An update from the team would be wonderful.

Writing for this type of show along with any reality is more producing than writing. You create the scenarios and have your cast react to the presented scenarios."

Under ""Batsu Games"" you find chronological lists of Batsu Games and No-Laughing Batsu Games. There are some pies flying in the 2000 24 Hour Tag-batsu. One of the best.  If you specifically were looking for pie-in-face-batsus you could get disappointed there, but there is some.  Some non-batsu pie fun: Under ""Other"" you can find the show Lincoln where this gold nugget is listed as Matsumoto presents: Pie or Kiss. And two months ago Pie Throw Hell Game was posted here.  There must be more, but not that I can think of from the top of my head. Enjoy!"

GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,OldColt,13,Wed Feb 11 12:41:35 2015 UTC,Is it typesetting first and then translating?
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,GameJoker,5,Wed Jan 7 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"yes, bit by bit."
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,justsayingguy,11,Wed Jan 7 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"I'm confused about why the typesetting happens first. I understand that the timing and colors and fonts need to be established, but can't these be thrown off by the translation? For example, if a particular line turns out to need an English translation that was longer than expected, wouldn't that mess things up? Thanks :)"
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,HawaiianDry,20,Wed Jan 7 21:29:19 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine both typesetter and translator have access to the same software. The typesetter first goes through and adds something like ""[text here]"" at the right time and in the right color. Then the translator goes in and simply selects ""[text here]"" and replaces it with the actual text. Simple and easy.  If you went translator --> typesetter, then the translator would have to keep a separate document of translation with a timestamp on each piece of dialogue (huge burden) and the typesetter would have to match up the translations with the timestamp (huge burden). This is a way of doing it so you skip timestamps altogether.  I also might be talking about a subject I know very little about, so take it with a grain of salt."
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,bq87,13,Wed Jan 7 22:43:32 2015 UTC,"You are actually pretty spot on. This is the main reason and both typesetters and translators use AegiSubs. I write my translations on a Word Doc so I can keep track of them, but then copy and paste the line in the proper place in AegiSub."
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,oolongxcha,5,Thu Jan 8 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"I've experienced it both ways.  I think typesetter --> translator is the safest method because once the typesetting is done, the translator just needs minimal subbing software navigation skills to stick the translated text into the appropriate lines.    But I personally actually prefer translator --> typesetter because I think it's the same ""flow"" as with actual creative content production (talking out of my ass here because I've never created a video from scratch).  The translation is like the ""script writing"" and the typesetting is the ""direction and production"" where you're trying to communicate the script to the viewer.   Without budget constraints (which you don't, really, in this kind of subbing context, obviously), you let the script writing do what it needs to do without bothering it with technicalities.  In the next step, the typesetter takes the translated text and then ""physically creates"" the content that goes on the screen.  Let the typesetter deal with the technicalities because the typesetter, by definition, is going to be more familiar with the subbing software and thus more adept at dealing with technicalities.  The big caveat with this is that it helps tremendously if the typesetter knows a bit of the language, since then the translator doesn't necessarily need to include half-assed time stamps when they translate the text.  They just need to produce the translated English and then let the typesetter handle the rest.  (But I'm biased because I'm a translator and this method does mean less work for the translator and more for the typesetter, heh.)    But for example, in a span of 2 seconds, 5 people might talk over each other.  In the typesetter --> translator direction, the typesetter adds 5 sub lines at the same timestamp.  The translator dutifully translates all 5 sub lines into English, and you get four instances of ""Oh, wow"" and one instance of ""Gee"" stacked together.  In the translator --> typesetter direction, the translator probably would have translated it as ""All: Oh, wow"" and ignored the ""Gee"" because ""Oh, wow"" is really all that needs to be communicated, and there's no need for 5 lines to be stacked vertically and taking up space at the bottom of the video.  The typesetter just sticks in one line ""Oh, wow.""  Another example: in a span of 2 seconds, 3 people talk over each other.  In the typesetter --> translator direction, knowing the example above, the typesetter assumes that all of their dialogue can be condensed into something like ""All: Oh, wow,"" like above, so he makes it ""All: ____"", leaving the blank for the translator.  But the translator listens to the dialogue and finds that 1 person yelled ""Weird!!,"" another said ""Nice,"" and another said ""You're stupid.""  The dialogue that follows is someone else replying to the person who said ""You're stupid.""  Thus, now, we find that ""You're stupid,"" is an important line because without it, the dialogue that comes after makes no sense.  So you have to translate ""You're stupid.""  But the other two people said totally different things, ""Weird!!"" and ""Nice.""  So if you want to be precise, you can't group any of those together.  Maybe you need all three lines present.  Or maybe the translator can decide that the ""Nice"" line is relatively unimportant and only ""Weird!!"" and ""You're stupid"" is necessary (too many lines stacked vertically can make the subs look awkward, potentially taking up like half of of the screen).  Basically, if the translator decides that the timing and placement of the lines needs to change, either he needs to ask the typesetter for edits here and there or venture into typesetting himself.    Now that I look back on it, translator --> typesetter works when the typesetter knows a bit of the language.  Typesetter --> translator works when the translator knows a bit of typesetting.  But I still think that, say, if both the typesetter knows a bit of the language and the translator knows a bit of typesetting, translator --> typesetter is still better since you divide the labor more clearly.  If the typesetter doesn't know the language and the translator doesn't know any typesetting, definitely typesetter --> translator."
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,typesoshee,5,Fri Jan 9 19:28:59 2015 UTC,This makes sense. I'd imagine there's probably another quick typesetting pass after the translating to make sure everything looks good.
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,gkatsev,2,Wed Jan 7 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but like was mentioned if they're just using placeholders, how do they know what it translates to wont overlap with other placeholders if more than one is talking over each other, or there'll be enough time for somebody to read said text."
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,OverlordQ,3,Wed Jan 7 23:05:19 2015 UTC,"I used to translate in an anime group before so here's my answer:  Many typesetter actually understand a little bit of the language. While it's not enough for them to actually translate, it is enough for them to know when to cut lines and such.   On the other hand, a good translator need to know how to rephrase one sentence without changing its meaning. So that even if you got a typesetter that do not understand any of the language, you will still be able to split one sentences into many smaller lines. This is not exclusive to subbing, but even in real life translating this ability is a must-have to become a good translator."
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,Moesugi,6,Fri Jan 9 11:06:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I dont get either. You can't do ordering and layout until you know wtf it says."
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,OverlordQ,3,Wed Jan 7 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"It seems wrong in my mind too. But just look at their record so far. They are probably doing it right.  I'm usually good at telling people ""You are doing it wrong!"", but in this case I'll just shut up, keep my distance and throw money at them."
GakiNoTsukai,2rnkz7,Donk72,3,Thu Jan 8 14:30:55 2015 UTC,"That's what I initially thought too. And then once I actually started doing translations, I started out with writing first and then typesetting later and then tried typesetting first and translating after. Translating first actually wastes a lot of time and /u/bq87 explains it pretty well."

To the point where I have to adjust the sub delay forth and back constantly. Completely un-watchable! So I decided to go to teamgaki.com and download all the subfiles individually, but then I realized that the websites directory have completely changed after their webserver went down, so the files are nowhere to be found. All the files are out, but nothing is working as intended. The full sub files is out of sync, can't find individual sub files for all the parts, 404 errors on their website.

GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,Squishydew,64,Wed Jan 7 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the translators, working alongside Team Gaki, for this batsu game. Thank you for asking this question, I hope this clarifies things!  I can only speak as a translator, but translating is fairly challenging, though it depends on your language skills and cultural knowledge. Finding the right phrase in English to invoke the original feeling/attitude is actually a lot more difficult than I thought. /u/typesoshee and I discussed this and sometimes, you stare at a Japanese phrase for so long, you start to question your own English comprehension. Particularly the cultural jokes are hard to translate because how do you translate the Kansai dialect in a way that makes a really normal phrase sound funny? And then there's also jokes that make specific references, so there's also research into what that joke means.  And then there's also the problem that when they all talk over each other, it doesn't matter if your Japanese skills are superb, you just can't hear very clearly.  I'm also a perfectionist and if I'm not satisfied, I will take time and effort to get it there. I always keep a dictionary and thesaurus tab open as I go along.  The biggest difficulty factor is definitely just having time though.  [Edit] Damnit, I promise I can English good."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,oolongxcha,9,Wed Jan 7 19:48:56 2015 UTC,Finding the right phrase in English to invoke the original feeling/attitude is actually a lot more difficult than I thought.   What /u/oolongxcha said right there.  I've seen a lot of translations where the jokes don't even come across in the English translation.  And for what its worth GnT is popular because of their verbal humor not their physical so I think it would suck to miss out on quality translations.
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,Hashiru,5,Wed Jan 7 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I try to be a perfectionist when it comes to translating, especially for Downtown, because as silly as it sounds, they deserve it.  As ridiculous and funny as their physical humor is, it's Downtown's verbal humor that makes them special.  Physical humor (like Silent Library) obviously has more viral ability because it easily crosses language and cultural barriers.  So as a subber, where the basic ""mission"" or purpose of volunteering is to spread the Gaki love as much as possible, my ""mission"" is to spread Gaki's verbal humor as much as possible.    You've already touched on this but the thing I feel is that almost every sentence that the Gaki cast says on screen is funny in Japanese (especially in an episode like this where it's edited down (from ~18? hours to 6 hours)).  I'm not exaggerating: almost every utterance, even single word sentences that they're saying is funny in Japanese.  My goal is to translate that humor as well, so that does take time.    (Hijacking here, sorry): Someone below asked whether typsetting or subbing takes longer.  The typesetters at Team Gaki are really good and used to doing this, so they can do it really fast, and props to them.  As for subbing, it just depends on how perfectionist you're going to do it.  /u/oolongxcha or I could have live-translated as well or finished some parts by now if only a ""functional"" translation was needed (like enough for English speakers to just understand literally what people were saying), but I guess we're going for something that will translate the humor as well as possible, so that takes some time.  I think especially since a live-translated transcription already seems to exist, the value-addition of Team Gaki will be a more perfectionist, professional-looking sub-job.  So now viewers get two choices, a ""functional"" sub that's available immediately and a ""perfectionist"" sub that will take more time.  But as /u/oolongxcha said, the biggest factor in translation speed is still free time and energy :P."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,typesoshee,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"Great to hear! I hope every subber on the team is trying to get the verbal humor as right as you two.  Btw, how far done are the first 3 parts, if you wouldn't mind saying? If you say % it will at least make my wait that much less dreadful. :)"
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,ozmelk,3,Fri Jan 9 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. And your background on how you learned Japanese also affects translations. Some people maybe be brilliant at speaking/reading/writing in academic and formal Japanese, but don't know colloquial/slang terms, which may prove to be a huge challenge for translating variety and comedy shows. Which is why it's so nice to have other translators to work together with."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,oolongxcha,3,Wed Jan 7 23:58:59 2015 UTC,It's wonderful to hear how much effort and thought it's put into translating. I hope other translators do as much as well. Thank you very much subbing and replying. +respect :)

I've been studying Japanese for a year, I can just barely understand the kiki episodes but that's about it. I used to complain about subs on anime that are confusing or overly 'anglo-ified', but I now realize how hard it is to translate all the subtleties of Japanese. Your work is really appreciated, It's from people like you that Gaki no Tsukai has spread to the west where so many people can enjoy it! Katajikenai!"

GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,oolongxcha,2,Thu Jan 8 00:59:23 2015 UTC,"How about asking instead of yelling? Would that suffice?  I think we're formatting our subs for 720p, thus the 720p file. I'll double check."

GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,victoryforZIM,17,Thu Jan 8 09:29:44 2015 UTC,"Translation, timing, typesetting, encoding, and quality check have to be done at the very least...I imagine it takes quite a long time especially when you're trying to translate jokes so they can be understood by an English speaking audience. Not to mention all the translations of text that scrolls on the screen and the difficulty of hearing what they're saying at times."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,BurntJoint,7,Wed Jan 7 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"It also really depends on what level of quality and how much sleep they feel like sacrificing for the final product. There is a Korean variety show i watch (Running Man) that is usually around the 70-80 min mark each week with a main cast of 7 and that gets hardsubbed within 36 hours and released on DramaFever.   Now the sub quality is actually fairly decent, but these guys basically stay up for that whole period to get it done in time. I don't have any expectations when it comes to people who provide free subs, because its their time and effort they are using to entertain us so im just happy we have anything at all."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,dokuromark,2,Wed Jan 7 20:52:43 2015 UTC,That's some real dedication to get shows subbed in 36 hours! Kudo to those hardcore heroes!
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,dokuromark,2,Fri Jan 9 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"I second all that. The translation part is not as easy as just listening to what the person says and typing it into Word. It has to be translated carefully so that it doesn't sound excessively odd to English-speakers ears, then entered into a subtitling program using the right formatting for the speaker. If you've ever tried your hand at transcribing, ie listening to a speech in your native language and typing it up in Word or whatever, it's not something most people can do very quickly. Even very good transcribers have to listen to the speech several times to make certain it's accurate.  And translation is just one facet of the subbing process, as victoryforZIM points out. Timing alone can take hours for just a short segment, as the timer has to listen to a section of spoken word and mark the beginning and ending segments of each speech precisely. Someone has to set all the colours and position of text correctly. Another person has to make sure it's all consistent, error-free, and flows correctly.  Others in the thread have pointed out that it's also not really anybody's full-time job. Those working on the subs love Gaki, but also have to go to school, work a regular job, spend time with family, have year-round hobbies, etc. They volunteer their time when they can to make the subbing happen.  I'm sure everybody who works on subbing the GNT New Year's show wants to see it complete and subbed as soon as possible, but they also want to see it done right and don't want to exhaust themselves over it."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,gkatsev,3,Fri Jan 9 18:35:25 2015 UTC,Mad props to everyone involved in getting these subbed and released!
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,Whittigo,4,Wed Jan 7 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"How long have you been a gaki fan? Last year was fantastic, the entire thing subbed with quality subs and out so quickly, years before that it would be June/July until the new years batsu would be fully subbed. It's not an easy job, and certainly not easy to understand them all at times with their dialects and all the noise going on in the show. So yeah its a big time investment."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,t2t2,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not to sure honestly, i think i started watching late 2013? Might be totally off, all i know is that I've loved it all, at the time i think i just watched the things listed on the side of the subreddit :)  Asking this question i never really considered dialects and culture differences, i remember learning english and reading about strange phrases like ""I'm just pulling your leg.""  Took me ages to understand what nonsensical things like that meant, haha.  Thanks for some history/perspective."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,tenkal,3,Wed Jan 7 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"It all depends on person's skillset. There are people who can solo (typeset + translate alone) 1h30m episodes in 4~5 days from the show's airing (all hail Bumdy) (or teams doing it within a day, see Running Man (korean)). Also looking at the status page, mickstar (the person who did the livesubbing) doesn't seem to be subbing this year."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,ozmelk,3,Wed Jan 7 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, according to a quick forum search an hour of subtitling is around a day of work, and that would be for professionals, working on basic content  its infinitely harder and time consuming if you're not professionally trained or very experienced with the software  In college I did subtitling for a trailer that was a few minutes long and had a few jokes, trust me it took time, just transcribing it would take time, let alone getting everything right, which includes lenght of subtitles, duration of each subtitle so it's both synched with the dialogue and is there long enough so people can read it.  Just the translation of humor is an immense challenge, without taking into account the time consuming process of captioning a video as long as a gaki no tsukai special.  I'm just a viewer like you though so I dont really know how difficult or not it is for the gaki subtitling volunteers."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,oolongxcha,3,Wed Jan 7 17:47:51 2015 UTC,"First of all there's the translation challenge with dialect and understanding the cultural references, and then the very time consuming process of timing, from my personal experience, timing for the recent weeping competition took me around 4hours for a 23min clip(about 11+ times more than the actual video  length)... It took about 4days or so to actually acquire the raw and split it into parts in accordance to their distribution of subbing plans. Encoding the subs is also excruciatingly and tediously long. Just a guess but I assume it'll take about 2months at most for the complete sub. I think it'd be better if they had already completed 3 or so 30min parts before releasing it one by one weekly so that there's no lag between the releases."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,dokuromark,5,Wed Jan 7 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"Someone here said typesetting is way more time demanding than translation, yet on gaki status page typesetting was done in a day, while translating is still going on for days (part 1-3). And these parts are 10min long as well. So I'm wondering what's going on? Of course as long as it's quality product it doesn't matter how long it takes, but I'm just curious. Also, the 60 sec page refresh is funny."
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,megafilipe,10,Wed Jan 7 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"The reason why everyone's progress is different is because each one of us have different schedules/availability. Some are students, some are full-time employees, etc. For myself, I work full-time and I also participate in other scheduled activities throughout the week, so I can only squeeze in time to translate right before going to bed. I think a lot of people seem to be under the impression that it's like a part-time job, but I treat it like a prioritized to-do list where I only work on translations after I finish all of my other tasks.  Typesetting actually took 2-3 days for the first parts. Mad respect for the typesetters, all that formatting would drive me nuts.  I hope that doesn't come across as defensive, just wanted to answer your questions!"
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,Blackdeath_663,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"I tried my hand at a little typesetting a while ago, and it can be ridiculously difficult. I do a little timing now, and like oolongxcha, I have to fit it in when I can. I work fulltime, have to spend some time doing some side jobs to make ends meet, occasionally hang out with friends (gasp!), and sometimes just run out of energy. Timing is definitely high on my list, but it does have to get superseded by some everyday life sorts of things."

GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,Whittigo,0,Wed Jan 7 22:43:35 2015 UTC,I wish they had broken each part into tiny parts and started translating part 1...so we could get a half hour every few weeks...
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,dokuromark,4,Wed Jan 7 15:55:21 2015 UTC,well the whole game is split up into 30 minute sections and each 30 minutes is split up into 10 minute section for each person to work on so i dont know how smaller part you want
GakiNoTsukai,2rmuoa,The_Paul_Alves,2,Wed Jan 7 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"You mean you wish they had aired the show that way on TV? Last year this is how they approached the translation, they released a chunk at a time, I assumed that's how they would do it this year as well, they have it separated into ""parts"" on their status website, when part 1 is done they release, when part 2 is done, etc."
