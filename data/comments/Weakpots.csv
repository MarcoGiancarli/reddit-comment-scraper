Lower back mostly, a little into my glutes. On both sides. Constant dull ache of a pain. Sitting and lying down hurt the worst. Still have full mobility and standing/walking actually helps the pain.  Been on constant painkillers, they work well, but when they wear off it's really bad.  I think it's sciatica, but it's on both sides and doesn't really go down my leg so I don't know.  I don't have insurance till December, so I'm on my own. Any anecdotal or bromedical advice is appreciated."

A) at the toilet B) not at the toilet

They include but are not limited to the following: tile floor, carpet in front of toilet, wall behind toilet, cabinet to left of toilet, hand towel hanging on right of toilet and of course the piss boy's own feet. Then of course there is the whole toilet itself, of which only a portion of it is the actual target. Aim is not so good at that age, and boys correct me if I'm wrong, there seems to be great amusement at attempting targets AROUND the toilet, rather than in it."

Not me, my husband... is the problem that he doesn't lift? Does he need to lift? Help me internet doctor, you're my only hope"
Weakpots,3e2rzd,Strikerrjones,7,Tue Jul 21 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes just getting educated on how pain actually works can be helpful. His pain is real, but it's probably not coming from an injury, and when he experiences it he's not damaging something in his back.   If he likes reading, this is a good in-depth resource: http://www.noigroup.com/en/Product/EPBII  Your brain learns to experience pain with certain movements just like it learns how to do everything else. If he's had pain for years, his brain has had a lot of time to learn the pain really well, so it'll be a long road to make it go away. However, the first step really is understanding that the pain is essentially just an alarm system gone haywire; it's not working correctly anymore, and a lot of it can be ignored (although it's probably best ignored under the supervision of a good healthcare professional).   Also, pain can have real effects on the body. In people with chronic back pain, multifiduus and transverse abdominus tend to shut down and not work right, so getting those working well again is important.   I was gonna tell you to ask that doc_of_pain guy cause he's literally published stuff on pain, but he seems to have svunted :(."
Weakpots,3e2rzd,LTUTD,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"His pain is real, but it's probably not coming from an injury, and when he experiences it he's not damaging something in his back.    This is actually a wonderful bit of information to hear.  One of my big fears was always that I needed to cool it when things hurt because every time it hurt it meant I was causing more damage... maybe permanent.  That being said, where do you draw the line?  If doing something makes the pain get worse over time?"
Weakpots,3e2rzd,LukeSwolewalker,4,Tue Jul 21 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's probably a good time to stop. If I was going to treat someone, I'd probably have them do things in a pain free manner and then very slowly increase the intensity/range of motion in a continuing pain free manner.   You'll probably want to manage volume and intensity to keep inflammatory reactions down, and then slowly increase those. Right now, even the slightest inflammation that most people wouldn't experience pain with is probably going to be painful for you, and pain will shut down the muscles I mentioned earlier plus glutes (and glute shutdown might be why you're having hip pain, assuming it isn't just referred pain from your back). I'm pretty sure this is actually my issue with squatting... I've hurt myself squatting so often that any sort of inflammation associated with squatting hurts me extra now, so I try not to push things to the point where I know I'm going to be in pain for days afterward.   You're basically trying to teach your brain that these positions and movements are okay to be in without setting off the pain alarm, so you want to introduce them slowly and pain-free."
Weakpots,3e2rzd,eleanor_ramilly,4,Tue Jul 21 18:40:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right now it hurts to tie my shoes, so I won't be lifting and I probably won't try anything until things are feeling a loooot better.  I only have about 10o of pain-free movement in the bad hip, so it's pretty much impossible at this point.  My PT gave me a lot of confidence, so that's good.  He didn't just go ""OK, back problems"" and start making me do bosu ball shit.  Thanks for the information, though.  It's good to hear encouraging things from somebody who knows this stuff and lifts."

Weakpots,3e1xvu,gzcl,7,Tue Jul 21 09:38:33 2015 UTC,I mean it's not awful but those 3x3 deadlifts on week 4 after that other heavier T1 stuff is gonna be murder. But then again if this is your 3rd time through something like this you're well adapted.  Also looks like you're on a bi-weekly increase of sorts?
Weakpots,3e1xvu,cmglifts,4,Tue Jul 21 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"First two cycles have been fine so far - its not easy, but that's the point, right? I like deadlift volume anyway. IDK if it starts to kill me after another month or two I'll reassess.  What do you mean by bi-weekly? T1 is ramping each week. T2 is supposed to be ramping each week as well, but my T2 for OHP is only increasing every two weeks cause its already at a decently high intensity. But I'm taking a somewhat relaxed approach to the weights for T2 cause I've not got them quite right in the first two cycles.  T3 squats and bench are also supposed to be increasing each week, but the other T3 stuff (abs, rows, curls, db raises) is all whatever I feel like on the day.  Thanks for the feedback!"
Weakpots,3e1xvu,greenalleycat,5,Tue Jul 21 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"To explain a few things:   It looks ugly as shit there cause I just chopped it up a bit to make an image. All in kilos, obviously. This will be my 3rd cycle - I started with 90% of my actual 1RMs from my meet at the end of May. Top double in T1 on the final week is always AMRAP. T2 is always beltless. I found that my OHP responds better to heavy triples than it does 5's, which is why my T2 work is 8x3, with a 2mins limit between sets. T2 (5x5) Deadlifts has a AMRAP final set. DB raises are front/side/rear and those are the reps for them. I've basically disregarded the percentage intensity recommendations from Jizzy, and gone with the rep schemes: T1 15 reps; T2 25 reps; T3 30+ (aiming for 40). Turns out I get bored as shit with light sets so everything is based around heavy 3's, heavy 5's, heavy 8's."

Weakpots,3dy9gk,BenchPolkov,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:55 2015 UTC,Super-protip: it really does.
Weakpots,3dy9gk,MasterBalloonier,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, both programs have given a lot of people a lot of success. And I think OP is experienced enough to cope with any deficiencies in TM (benching for example).   As long as he's training hard and eating enough, he'll get results either way. It's not like there is actually a 'wrong' choice here."
Weakpots,3dy9gk,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jul 21 07:28:49 2015 UTC,If he prefers one style to the other then its definitely the right choice. The program you stick to is better than one you don't.  The most efficient program in terms of long term progression is a very different story.
Weakpots,3dy9gk,fitphysics,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like 'most efficient' is a bit misleading though.  Does the trainee get stronger? Does the trainee enjoy the program?  I figure as long as those two criteria are met, then great. If the answer to one of those is 'no', then change what you're doing. It doesn't really matter if its 100lbs on your squat in 6 months vs 100lbs in 10 months.  Unless I'm completely misunderstanding you, which is pretty likely."
Weakpots,3dy9gk,BurgersBaconFreedom,2,Tue Jul 21 12:42:45 2015 UTC,"Read any basic strength theory eg. Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, Siff, or even the beautifully hirsute Nuckols who succinctly defines a lot of the former's work in the linked article. I am purely discussing physiological efficiency here to just to clarify. Sure there are many other factors that influence strength progression too but I am talking on the most refined scale.  Furthermore if you have to refer to a program's deficiencies, and then use methods that actually go against the program's guidelines to improve it then I real issues with it.   TM - Weekly peaking til you stall...   More efficient programming - continual building of work capacity to avoid stalling at all, peaking only for comps...  I can't even compare the two concepts personally."

I was pretty burned out on lifting due to mediocre progress so I didn't feel like putting too much effort into it at the time.

Weakpots,3dy1ss,CoSh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:47:09 2015 UTC,And then I have no idea how to do that part. How much volume? How much intensity? How do I progress? When do I deload? How do I deload?   After TM there's all this stuff about different splits you can do and different types of periodization and all I want is a consistently measurable and repeatable program with reps and sets like Texas Method without having to go back and guess what's gonna work for me based on the retardedly inconsistent stuff I've done in the past.

Weakpots,3dvm8q,Fiarwire,6,Mon Jul 20 01:09:06 2015 UTC,"No, no reason to avoid it as a beginner or at any level though for beginners you have to start small volume wise and approach the progression differently as its likely she will be able to make weight progression a lot faster as a newb lifter but that's not too difficult if you apply a bit of autoregulation which will be easier with you as a training partner.   Let me get back to you with a few more recommendations when I get home and have a glance over the program again."

Weakpots,3dujan,eleanor_ramilly,19,Sun Jul 19 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"Today was my first intensity day in two weeks (due to illness and then terrible lady business). I fully expected to have simply maintained at best but went for the maxes anyway.  DL: 230x5--- edit: I thought maybe being sick would have fucked me up but I still think I'm good for 300 at the meet. I have 7 more training weeks and my 1RM from July 4th was 250.  Squat: 140x5--- my PR from July 4th was 155lbs. Am I crazy for thinking I could get 200 in 7 weeks? The last volume day I did I repeated intensity day before the volume, and I might keep doing that with squats. So next Volume Day would be 140x5, then 4x5 125lbs (vs the 5x5). So I can stay comfortable under ""heavier weight"".  Bench: 125x1 (happy to have maintained this and expect to get at least 3 reps next ID. I mathed wrong and failed 135x1 right before this attempt. So dumb.)  Also, I said ""bless you"" to one of the only two girls I see lift at the gym after my DL set and she told me I should film myself ""next time I do that."" ""Yeah,"" I said, ""because my back was rounded, right?"" She said that yeah maybe a little but that it looked really good and I was surprised. We then got into a whole conversation about lifting/competing (she's planning to do a bikini comp in Jan) and we might train together soon. She told me all the names of the trainers I've seen around and the other girl who lifts and YAY gym friends!"

Weakpots,3dujan,BenchPolkov,5,Sun Jul 19 17:58:44 2015 UTC,Nobody said that it doesn't work. It's just that other methods work better in the long run. It's just short sighted.

Weakpots,3dujan,safe_space_invader,3,Mon Jul 20 13:29:51 2015 UTC,Because it is only focused on that next PR each week and limits volume and therefore work capacity development which play a far more major part in strength progression in the long run.

Weakpots,3dujan,frak8757,4,Sun Jul 19 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"No, they seem at least borderline realistic. If your training goes well, then it should be possible. Right now your estimated max is about 180/125/280, so 200/135/300 seems within reach. If you bench 125 for 3 then 135 is the predicted 1RM I think"
Weakpots,3dujan,frak8757,4,Sun Jul 19 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy with anything over my current 1RM for bench right now. I care a lot about bench, but at the same time, I don't care at all. It never progresses in a manner that makes ""sense"" to me (one week one rep of something feels impossible, then the next week I do an easy five. Then the next week I fail at three?), so, whatever there.  If I got 200/squat and 300/DL I would be so happy. Fuck, even 180 squat I would be psyched."
