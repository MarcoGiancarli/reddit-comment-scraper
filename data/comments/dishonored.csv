dishonored,3e4ipm,Jester_control,7,Tue Jul 21 22:07:46 2015 UTC,"I think it would be interesting if we start with powers, and we're required to use the powers to go through a part of a corvo level.    Something a-la portal, where figuring out how to go through a level without detection involves something like blinking really high, and then blinking mid-air to another location, in order to windblast something blocking a door, before landing, and then going to said door.   It would also be interesting if the Outsider was like ""You're strong and experienced. That's no fun... Let's make it interesting!"" proceeds to wipe all your powers and you have to regather runes, etc..."
dishonored,3e4ipm,cryptosocialist,4,Tue Jul 21 22:17:46 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to see how Corvo's relationship with the Outsider has grown throughout the years. I don't think we'll get a level you can only go through as Corvo, because the only character that you're required to play as is Emily. Is the Outsider capable of removing powers? seems like if he could he would've taken Daud's powers when he became boring. If he did remove Corvo's powers, is there anything in particular he would keep? Like blink 1 for instance."
dishonored,3e4ipm,ErrorNinja,2,Tue Jul 21 22:30:47 2015 UTC,It's implied that The Outsider knew that Corvo and Daud's paths would meet at some point hence why Daud didn't lose his powers since it would be a very one-handed battle if Daud lost his powers.
dishonored,3e4ipm,cryptosocialist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:08:03 2015 UTC,"I meant like if you choose Corvo, then that level requires Corvo's powers, maybe because he's old and not fast enough to do a given thing. And you're right, my thing about the Outsider taking away Corvo's powers is stupid lol."
dishonored,3e4ipm,nerotNS,2,Wed Jul 22 01:54:52 2015 UTC,"I doubt that The Outsider has the ability (or the will) to remove them, since he does say that what the wielder of the mark does with them is completely their own choice. Plus it's never implied that he has the ability to do so. However, maybe Corvo will have combined powers (you know, from years of exp/usage) and get something like Dauds blink for example."
dishonored,3e4ipm,cryptosocialist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:33:41 2015 UTC,True. I'm just trying to think of an in game explanation allowing the devs to strip us back to nothing except (daud's) blink other than Mostly Flesh and Steal being canon.
dishonored,3e4ipm,TheScyphozoa,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"You start The Knife of Dunwall with almost no powers, even though Daud and his bros obviously have level 2 Pull and level 2 Arcane Bond when they kill the empress. So it wouldn't surprise me if Corvo starts with minimal powers and you just have to imagine that it's a case where the story and the gameplay don't match up."
dishonored,3e4ipm,Kill_Welly,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:29:22 2015 UTC,"My guess is it goes back to almost zero powers, either completely ignored as a simple difference between gameplay and story, or hand-waved as the powers growing weaker from years of not being used."

""It's for the Pub Master Room"" There is no pub master room. No room in the building is labeled as such or is big enough to be considered a ""master room"". Since Havelock owns the pub, it could be his room, but the key in question is never used on Havelock's door at any point in the game.

To avoid this you should leave the weeper cages alone until you have spoken with Slackjaw and done everything else you wanted to do there (artists safe code, etc) then grab the bone-charm and whatever else from the weeper cages last, and make sure there is as little interaction between the bottle-street guys and the weepers as possible (preferably, deal with the weepers yourself, and quickly)."

Human Revolution's hub worlds were fun mainly for three reasons:  Firstly the hub was so fun to explore because you had freedom of movement and could use your abilities to find hidden loot, and places. Thief's hub offered little room for experimentation with the game mechanics being so controlled. But this won't be a problem for dishonored with its great mechanics.  Secondly Human Revolution's hubs were neutral areas, where you could freely talk to others and experience the world providing you weren't in an restricted area. The hub must be a neutral area like Lady Boyle's party, you can freely roam and talk to people, or start a fight if you like. Otherwise the hub will feel like a chore after a few visits.  Thirdly, the hub needs to only get a few visits, both Detroit and Hengsha were only available two times during the game, this made going to the hub feel special and less like a chore between getting to missions."
dishonored,3dkyg2,some1stoleit,5,Fri Jul 17 05:31:05 2015 UTC,"For me, it was not the hub itself in Thief, what made it less fun, but the loading screens and animations. I have felt somehow enthusiastic running from the Burrick to the other end, jumping and climbing in a parkour style - only to get stopped by slow crowbar or even loading screen. Oh, also the same reskinned enemies with the same patrolling routes trough the whole game:-("
dishonored,3dkyg2,Olivir2015,5,Fri Jul 17 06:35:04 2015 UTC,"The loading screens and arbitrary walls are one of the issues I have with the hub. But ultimately it may just be that the I personally don't like sneaking through the city itself, even in Thief Gold and Thief 2 I found the levels in the city to be the driest and least satisfying. I'm only up to the Brothel Mission and I'm already getting tired of the hub world. I might enjoy the hub more if the art was more appealing, less dark and gritty and a bit more stylized like Thief Gold/2 or Dishonored"
dishonored,3dkyg2,some1stoleit,2,Fri Jul 17 08:32:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the Thief's City has in fact become a bit boring for me recently, as I have done almost all side jobs which made it more fun. Also, I have uinstalled Thief now and probably will never install it again. Just like previous Thief games, where I did complete maybe  75-90 % and then uinstalled/reformated HDD/whatever and now I just don't have time and energy to to these again to be actually able to finish.  Now with Dishonored, I have found the time although I finished the main game before:-)"
dishonored,3dkyg2,Olivir2015,9,Fri Jul 17 10:08:17 2015 UTC,"Plus, two pro tags mean essentially 4 very different playthroughs right off the bat before you start going into the finer details.   Actually, 6 playthroughs at least, there will be a 3rd way of completing each mission, not just high and low chaos.   I think having a hub is a great idea, but not the    That way you can enjoy some combat and do other stuff without worrying about affecting your mission based chaos rate   part. That wouldn't make any sense logically, why should you leaving corpses everywhere only matter in certain parts of the city?  And if chaos was affected by the pub areas then how would it be checked by the player? how would it affect the hub world? It could work if done right, but then it might take too much effort away from the actual missions. I think it would be cool if instead of having a few side missions to do in the hub, you could talk to random civilians or members of your group (assuming we have one), and get side objectives to do in the main levels. For example on the lady Boyle mission Pendelton shoves the letter to lord Shaw right in your face, no way to avoid it, I think it would be cool if little side objectives like that one were something you had to seek out and find by talking to people in the hub world, not just something you are almost forced to do."
dishonored,3dkyg2,Raysparks38,2,Fri Jul 17 03:47:11 2015 UTC,Oh yes your ideas are perfect! This is the second time in this thread alone that I'm finding a gameplay idea which hadn't crossed my mind earlier and am now looking really forward to.
dishonored,3dkyg2,toomanyhorses,4,Fri Jul 17 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"Been saying this since I finished the first game. The sense of freedom in Dishonored comes from the open level design and lack of gameplay constrictions; an open world lacks the former, and the Hound Pits lacked the latter. A chunk of city acting as a hub world would be able to do both pretty handily. You could practice sneaking, steal resources for upgrades, explore more of the amazingly crafted world, or just cut loose on a city full of innocent civilians  I mean, if you're into that sort of thing."

dishonored,3dkyg2,toomanyhorses,2,Fri Jul 17 07:29:20 2015 UTC,"In any regard, I think Dishonored 2 should have some sections that are truly ""urban"".  As in bustling streets file with both citizens and guards. Obviously the engine can handle it up to a certain extent. From what I know, Karnaca is being described as a bustling city on the brink of plague and destruction, whereas Dunwall was already half dead by the time you started playing.  Perhaps killing people in the hub world would add chaos. But that isn't a bad thing. If you chose to explore a bit and kill some people then you pay the consequence. I suppose having a purely consequence free environment would really hurt the game's lore and narrative.  However, killing guards and stuff does not add nearly as much chaos as killing major targets and completing side missions a certain way.  Essentially, the hub world would act as a ""screw around"" area between missions, devoid of intense planning, scripted pathways and ect, and is simply populated by patrolling guards and citizens with perhaps some side missions and stuff."
dishonored,3dkyg2,Binary-79,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:05 2015 UTC,"Shit, a hub world for Dish2 hadn't even crossed my mind. I do remember being let down regarding hub worlds in both of daud's dlcs, first when i realised in KoD that Daud was not getting a place to cool off between levels. The closest we came to that was getting to roam the floor Daud's office is, but honestly, they could have atleast given us access to the whole building. I strain at the windows there for a better view of the whole base :(  Now you've got me looking really forward to a hub world in Dishonored 2. But I don't think you should have the ability to kill any NPC there (it should cut to an endscreen). The very purpose of a hub world to me is to chill out after a long level, to take a break from killing and sneaking and all that shit. Killing, or the lack thereof in there would definitely have to affect your chaos, which feels honestly tiresome."

This would not be able to kill them though as eventually they'd collapse and stop casting a large enough shadow for you to inhabit. The way I picture the hiding mechanic working is that once you've merged with their shadow, it has a passive sort of pull to it. If you want to leave it you simply walk right out, but if you walk in and release all movement controls you'll be dragged everywhere that NPC's shadow goes. Second tier, out right kill them and pull them down to be torn apart and eaten by their own shadow, destroying the corpse, or go nonlethal by absorbing them into yourself to be expelled at a later date unharmed.

Download the Package decompressor here, and then, read the 2nd and 4th posts on this page.  Follow the instructions on that 2nd link, and you can edit pretty much every power in every way, most bone charms, edit variables built into Corvo himself, and the costs of all Pieros stuff, upgrades included, (warning in advance, the variable for possession's mana cost doesn't work, so don't be surprised).  I found out Dauds code with something more complex the user ""Tautologist"" explains on the 2nd page of that forum, the DLC is not affected by any changes you make, and he hasn't done anything for the DLC, so you'd need to dig deeper to get that going.  TheScyphozoa talks about Blink Step Distance, these ini files, in my experience, can only affect the passive powers, not ones like blink.  But as a bit of trvia, blink step distance refers to how fast Corvo moves during blink (that is, how fast he dashes through the air), this is mostly cosmetic."

As long as you make a copy of these files before you change them, you can always restore the originals and shouldn't be at any risk of breaking the game."

One of the first things I noticed about him is how the Agility power is also slightly different.  Corvo just gets sort of a double-jump effect, like hop-hop, but Daud just has one big jump. And that little change made Daud feel a little older, a little more stiff, like he could be almost as mobile as Corvo, but just a tad less.  Maybe it's just me, but that (and Michael Madsen's amazing voice acting, holy crap Daud felt like a steampunk hard boiled detective in his narration) really sold the character, for me."

I might've not played the DLC if they put some crazy ass mechanic where you choose where in the map you wanna go and then what direction you want to be facing like how The Whalers seemingly do.

dishonored,3dcm9f,Packersrule123,4,Wed Jul 15 08:19:33 2015 UTC,"That is true. It would be nice sometimes to have the seemingly unlimited distance teleportation of Daud's whalers but blink is awesome. Teleporting in games is usually done horribly, now that I think about it.

Time treezes as you hold left mouse button, you look around, objects like walls or balconies with room to teleport to the other side will partially glow if you hold the alt button, this also means your blink reticle will pass through the wall/ceiling/balcony/rubble/person, and you will be able to go through and behind it.  You won't be able to see the room or ground the other side though (you will be able to see the reticle though, so you know relatively how far you're going to go and if you'll have any solid ground to stand on) unless you've laid eyes on that part of the map already (in which case the object will also be transparent), mimicking the ""you know they layout of the room"" thing the Whaler trainer mentioned.  When you blink to your targeted spot, time will still be frozen, but if you try to move anywhere, or press any buttons other than crouch, then time will unfreeze, this means you have time to turn in any direction you want, but can't exploit it to steal things or kill people instantly, or chain blinks.  Bingo, you have a short range version of the Whalers transversals, just by adding a couple of tricks to Dauds current blink."
dishonored,3dcm9f,SnipingNinja,2,Wed Jul 15 11:51:13 2015 UTC,"What can be done is allow the usage of scroll during the blink time stop to decide the distance, so you can directly appear inside a room or as you said the balcony."
dishonored,3dcm9f,Vortex_Gator,2,Wed Jul 15 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"True, that would make it even simpler, although it would disable the use of scrolling through powers, I don't think anyone really uses that when holding blink.  Though we must also keep in mind the limits gamepad controller."

dishonored,3dbqaw,spooply,6,Wed Jul 15 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"Sure these examples are the only 2 we see, but Corvo is charged with assassinating The Empress and his bounty is only 30,000, and they aren't exactly turning in the killer of an empress every month.

dishonored,3dbqaw,MozartInABlender,3,Wed Jul 15 02:15:14 2015 UTC,"If their killing so many people how is Dunwall able to maintain a stable population? And who the heck is paying them if their killing everyone? Also, how would their be that many criminals to generate all this bounty? Basically that means the only people still living are criminals, courtesans, and aristocrats (Oh my!); this means the only people to steal from are aristocrats, but there is only so much wealth. Dunwall would be run dry because their dropping stacks on The Whalers. Food may not be expensive I can agree with that, but we know the price of gear upgrades, and it isn't low; perhaps the base equipment is even more costly. You may have to do one full job to get a single wristbow. Sure these examples are the only 2 we see, but Corvo is charged with assassinating The Empress and his bounty is only 30,000, and they aren't exactly turning in the killer of an empress every month.

dishonored,3dbqaw,Vortex_Gator,4,Wed Jul 15 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"They could also have contracts in the rest of Gristol, depending on how territorial other assassins are (or if there even are that many other assassins)"

dishonored,3dbqaw,Vortex_Gator,4,Wed Jul 15 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"Your bringing up the plague dead tells us a lot that I don't think you've considered. Dunwall is in a state of virtual quarantine, with almost no traffic with the other cities of the Empire. They are blockaded, and nobody wants to go near the city. Take note also that a good part of its population is dead or Weeping. What do you think it does to prices?  Think about it. Dunwall is in economic flux, with prices for certain items dropping and rising unpredictably. Wristbows that might have cost very cheap to manufacture and upgrade would suddenly become very costly when a third of all capable manufacturers, craftsmen, and artificers are dead. What prices we see Daud paying might not actually reflect what the Whalers are used to paying for, but rather what the Whalers are being forced to pay for.  Also, Dunwall is a gigantic city. Hundreds could die in it each day before the plague and no-one would notice or care. With the plague quickly eliminating people in the city, contracts would dry up quickly. The scale of operations we saw from the Whalers is probably scaled down, at that, with them taking whatever contract they can get.  It's also mentioned that they don't exclusively kill. They also steal, spy, and sabotage. The first is lucrative on its own or on contract, and I'm sure many would pay top coin for the second and third."

dishonored,3dbqaw,HolyBatnessFatman,7,Wed Jul 15 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"""Elixir is expensive"" is pretty well-established in-game. The guards rely on rationed elixir given to them by the state, the Bottle Street Boys are diluting elixir so that they can sell it to the poor for cheap, and there's that one woman in House of Pleasure who gets shaken down by the guards because they don't believe a servant could have gotten elixir without stealing it.  And this is just for plague survival, which means maybe one dose of elixir a week. Corvo's the only one chugging the things."

Also keep in mind that they said the story and missions are the same, but with different perspectives, meaning their non-revengish goal is mostly the same.  This tells me that they will survive regardless of who is chosen, and that the other person will probably either be disabled due to injury, captured, or they will be seperated from each other in the panic, and the other person will be doing something else somewhere else, probably re-united later.  Or maybe Corvo was going to go, but choosing to play as Emily means that she gets powers, and decides to do the things herself and sneaks away, and we get a ""what were you thinking?!"" speech from Corvo later on when he finds her.  There are plenty of ways other than capture for Corvo to not fight, whether he agrees to it or not.

dishonored,3dasx7,Jimli_,2,Tue Jul 14 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the key is a big part. Holding people is kind of what cells do, and once it's open it wasn't a big deal for someone as skilled as corvo to take some incompetent lower watch guards who are blind and deaf. Also, the simple music box prison would also keep him weakened so even if he did escape he might be in such bad shape he couldn't go very far before being captured again."
dishonored,3dasx7,screechingpandas45,-2,Wed Jul 15 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"god forbid Corvo ""blinks"" out of the prison. I know in the game you can't blink through bars like that but that's likely got nothing to do with lore and more to do with gameplay. I'm sure it's well within his abilities. The devs just needed a way to get Corvo to meet up with the loyalists and get the narrative going, hence the note and the key."
dishonored,3dasx7,Jimli_,4,Wed Jul 15 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"The music box would disable all supernatural abilities, and also drain his strength somewhat as well. Edit: I just had a revelation involving corvo's blink. Even if there was no music box, he still wouldn't be able to.  Why? Because rather then teleport him like most people think, blink seems to rather slow down time and move corvo quickly between two points. This can be seen as walls of light will still zap you and if you blink so you just pass by a guard you can observe them stumbling, or in some cases being knocked down. This would explain why you cnt blink through things like bars and such, because to do that corvo would physically need to be able to fit through bars normally."
dishonored,3dasx7,screechingpandas45,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"there was no music box in the first level so he could have used any power he wanted. That does make a lot of sense, even though those are more gameplay heavy observations as opposed to actual lore in the game explaining it. If that was the case, I'm sure he could have summoned a swarm of rats then possessed one of them or something at some point to escape anyway"
dishonored,3dasx7,Olivir2015,2,Wed Jul 15 03:23:53 2015 UTC,"As Corvo has met the Outsider after the prison break, this may well be truth - but why would anyone put a musicbox in the vincinity of cell of someone who has no powers. Also, postponing the Outsider mark to Hound Pit Pub is not needed for the gameplay (only), as story dictates it - why on earth would Outsider be interested in someone rotting in a cell, be it an accused mureder of the Empress? It was the well-executed escape - and the first sleep afterwards - that has led to the marking."
dishonored,3dasx7,screechingpandas45,2,Wed Jul 15 05:43:44 2015 UTC,ah I remembered him being given the mark in the prison. Guess I was mistaken! I think the original trailer gave across the impression he received the mark in prison. My mistake!
dishonored,3dasx7,HeyItsLP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:27:58 2015 UTC,"Oh you can blink through bars alright. Look up ""Dishonored slip clip""."
dishonored,3dasx7,Vortex_Gator,2,Sun Jul 19 06:04:50 2015 UTC,"Corvo is much better than that. The guards would have to have extreme training and safety measures.   Good point.   Another theory is that Emily will get marked by the Outsider when this event happens where she gets overthrown. She then will refuse Corvo's help since he doesn't need to protect her anymore.   I don't see Corvo agreeing to this at all. She is both his daughter and the Empress. If she dies, all is lost. It is his duty to protect her."
dishonored,3dasx7,Akashin,2,Tue Jul 14 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"The circumstances are different, in the first mission, it was a case of ""just another high security prisoner to interrogate and keep captive"", in this game, it would be ""highly dangerous threat to our overthrowing the throne, has supernatural powers and escaped coldridge without them"".  That, and I doubt Corvo could ever have escaped Coldridge 2.0 from the DLC, nowhere to jump, he would need to slowly climb down while being shot at, and a simple slipped key wouldn't let Corvo free because of the locking system, and his only path to outside would have had an arc pylon in the way.  Heck, if the Whalers had activated a music box beside Corvos pit in the ground, he wouldn't have escaped that either.  So in summary, way better security measured have been demonstrated to exist, the people capturing him would know the danger he poses and use these measures, and just a music box beside a deep pit in the ground would hold Corvo captive."

dishonored,3dasx7,Ahmed924,5,Sat Jul 18 18:39:14 2015 UTC,"Corvo would never let Emily fight instead of him unless he is dead.   Why?  Emily seems more than capable from what we see in the trailer, and it's her throne they're fighting for.  Why shouldn't she fight?    And choosing to play as Emily doesn't necessarily mean Corvo just sits at home and twiddles his thumbs."

Because she is both his daughter and the Empress. If she dies, Corvo loses his only daughter and the empire loses the leader. Corvo is officially just a bodyguard, he has no way of becoming the Emperor. He is expendable and she is not. She might maybe fight alongside Corvo, but not instead of him."

This means none of them die until the end of Dishonored 2. Corvo dies of old age and Emily is the empress."
dishonored,3dasx7,exegesis,3,Wed Jul 15 06:43:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's safe to take those endings for granted, given that they're choosing their own canon."
dishonored,3dasx7,IK_DOE_EEN_GOK,2,Wed Jul 15 12:04:52 2015 UTC,"Seeing as we see a young/middle-aged woman in the Dishonored 2 trailer, their choice of the high/low endings (Emily survives) will most likely not matter. Seeing as at first the endings talk about what happends after she enters the throne but still a young girl, and suddenly jumps to the ""old age"" and the noticeably older Emily. I base this on only having experienced three endings, High chaos (Emily dead and survived) and low chaos, so if there are more then discard this.  I would recon that, as has been said in another post here, Korvo would never allow Emily to fight if he could help it. Looking at it that way Dishonored 2 can have one playthrough where you choose to play as Korvo and the story progresses as normal (He does the dirty work) or if you choose Emily, something happens to Korvo that disables/kills him and leaves Emily to do the dirty work.  Based on the ending of the first game, Dishonored 2 is and as said by Bethesda, the game is set 15 years in the future (Making her 25ish). The period, where on low chaos, Emily gets the nickname 'Emily the Wise'. The game could quite possibly have three options when you start (Maybe based on previous saves like in the Daud DLCs), one where you start on low chaos, high chaos or an default medium chaos which is their ""You either did not play the first game, or want a fresh start"" setting.  To conclude though, to me it seems like we are at the moment only showed one trailer, which is the ""You chose to play as Emily"" setting, and that the Korvo one will either not be shown, or that they actually work side by side in that setting (Which would be wierd, not having seen Korvo in the trailer and only his mask implying to me that something happened to him).  PS: Haven't played through Brigmore Witches DLC so can't say anything that is added/changed on the main story in that.  Edit: Added small things to the 'conclusion' and rewrote some sections"

Realistically I just don't see her ever becoming as badass as Corvo, because she has an Empire to run - there just isn't enough hours in a day to both become proficient with a sword on Corvo level and to be the Empress her people needed. But even that aside, she is clearly more important of the two. If she dies, Empire loses its Empress and Corvo loses his only daughter.   As in, ""it's your decision, and I'll respect it, but I'd prefer to not put you into danger. If you do go please be careful.""   I can see them maybe fighting together if there's no other way (given that they are both marked), but not her going alone."

The rules for what affected the ghost achievement weren't clear to me when I did this, so I tried to keep everyone in a blissful state of unawareness. I had both blink2 and bendtime2, so I blinked from outside the nearest open doors to the bookshelf next to the sentry by the wall, waited til daud paced forward and the sentry was just turning away from daud, stopped time (which slows daud and stops the sentry), blinked behind daud and choked him out.

If someone saw me and I got in a battle, kill some guards, run then hide and go stealth for a while.

dishonored,3d7dzo,Sir_Laser,2,Tue Jul 14 14:03:17 2015 UTC,There's a checkbox after each mission for whether you fulfilled the requirements for the Ghost achievement or not.

I know i didn't kill the assassins, i might try from daud onwards, i might not have to kill him, because you don't have to eliminate him somehow to continue onwards where as all the other ones you have to remove them somehow, eg brand, mines, creepy stalker you know. Daud you can just leave alive so maybe thats it. Can you get Clean hands and Ghost, on the same run? like do you HAVE to kill the targets to get ghost, or if you do nonlethal options but aren't detected do you get ghost?"

I see him as an uneasy alliance for Corvo should he need backup, but for Emily this is the man that killed her mother. If she finds out he's still alive, would she take her vengeance? That could be a strong dramatic point in the story, with her given the same opportunity for retribution as Corvo.   If I were writing the game, I can imagine it taking place before a major level, right before needing to infiltrate the big bad's lair or something. Her sword is drawn, he's on his knees, head bowed, telling her to take her revenge and end his suffering. And either she kills him and carries on alone, or she could put away her sword BUT say that because he took her mother's life she now owns his. And he'll help you through the final stage because of that debt.   Probably not going to play out like that, but I would love it if it did!"

We can only spit ball the timeframe base on how old she looks in the trailer, but I'm putting her in her early-mid 20s maybe 30ish. This would put Corvo at 49-60 with a margin of 10-20 years. Personally I hope he's 60ish, fully mastered his powers and generally tired of everyone's bullshit.

Story-wise, Corvo would be great, he's trying to get his daughter back on the throne again, and is seeing his home again, and how it's changed, the Masked Heretic has returned.  On the other hand, Emily is getting her kingdom back, and she's been trained up by her father and protector, and from what I can tell, it seems the devs are giving her most of the attention (fucking grapple and hypnosis, and shadowyness).  So, the choice is between a more fresh experience with the first time stumbling around as Emily (pretty authentic, both Emily and I won't have much experience with this new game or any knowledge of the streets), or Corvo returning home with a set of familiar powers that included Dauds blink."

And the other targets were just as rotten, especially when you consider their potential. Pendleton twins? Highborn into a prominent family during an aristocracy. High overseer? He runs a religious faction and a book full of blackmail to keep anyone from ratting him out, the power to guide the people against Hiram was at his fingertips. Boyle? She held a fucking party during a plague while tons of the common folk were starving and dying from plague. Hiram? You don't even need my help with this one. Daud on the other hand, he was raised in a broken home by a brutal women. He sold his skills (nevermind that his skills are used for murder) for coin and isn't that what anyone would do? Mind you this is an aristocracy, there aren't opportunities galore like there is in modern day America."

dishonored,3d32q8,volound,3,Mon Jul 13 04:31:45 2015 UTC,"Corvo doesn't know that, so I find it very weird Daud was saved."
dishonored,3d32q8,CadenFerraro,5,Mon Jul 13 14:16:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Plus Daud threw all my gear off a cliff and put me in a pit (which was astoundingly stupid of him, considering he knew I was marked AND that I was the Lord Protector), he could've just challenged me to a fight when he first dragged me out of the river..."
dishonored,3d32q8,LoM3,4,Mon Jul 13 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"The monologue he gave at the end was sincere, and it's implied that Corvo knew the monologue was sincere. I don't know for sure if canonically Corvo pickpocketed Daud (alternative sparing method) or if he fought him and then Daud begged successfully for his life, but I'm strongly suspecting it's the latter (the canon Corvo is not a complete pacifist, for one). The duel also occurs in the DLC and cannot be avoided. We also know that Daud would have to have pursued a low chaos run throughout the DLC in order to be spared.   It's actually interesting. If killing the empress really did change Daud, then he would have went through the DLC arc peacefully and the speech would have been sincere (and more effectively engender sympathy/empathy in Corvo). If killing the empress didn't change Daud and he was the same cold-hearted cut-throat as he was before, then he would have continued to murder his way through the DLC arc and the speech would have been bullshit, and Corvo would have noticed and killed him. This is what happens. Low chaos DLC run - Corvo spares Daud. High chaos run - Corvo kills Daud.   If, according to canon, Daud and Corvo fought their duel, then the speech was part of canon. The speech preceded and caused the canonical decision to spare his life, which is how it should be (sparing him) according to modern sophisticated moral systems. If, for example, even the most evil and benighted criminal had a guarantee of no recidivism once out of prison, it would be morally imperative to end their captivity.   We shouldn't imprison people to punish them for their crimes (if we have a tenable moral system), we imprison them as a result of them being the person that we know they are as a consequence of their actions. To our fault, we do it for other reasons, like vengeance for those affected, which is morally dubious at the very best.  Daud was repentant and reformed, and Corvo knew it. At least, I'm quite sure that's the case.  tl;dr vengeance models of morality are bad. Killing the empress broke Daud. Daud sincerely repented and was a changed man, Corvo picked up on this.  P.S. It could even be argued (quite strongly, I would say) that Daud lost the duel against Corvo deliberately, as he didn't want to kill Corvo, and actually sought for Corvo to forgive him. With a low chaos (canon) approach, Daud remarks multiple times about how Corvo ""found another way"" and was a better person than him. He is more aware of his errors and accepts his fate more gracefully, a trend that is repeated with the antagonists in the final mission. In high chaos, Daud not only doesn't say these things, but he summons his most elite assassins to kill Corvo as a final desperate grasp. In low chaos, he chooses not to.   All in all, it's a great plot and the chaos system and choice elements are great mechanics."
dishonored,3d32q8,volound,-2,Tue Jul 14 05:57:19 2015 UTC,"First off, let me start by saying that that is your opinion and that isn't fact. But let's keep it real. Daud was saved because he is a fan-favorite and he is a great written character. You only know his speech is sincere after you have played the dlc and got to see he redeemed himself. Secondly, it is very unlikely Corvo found the speech sincere since he gets taken by Daud's when he is found in a boat in the Flooded District and is immediately imprisoned and his gear is taken, and after he escapes he is violently attacked by his assassin's.  Everything you wrote about modern sophisticated morals are irrelevant in a fantasy world about an assassin who's motto is: 'Revenge solves everything.'  P.S. Your opinion that prison isn't a good way to punish a criminal is bullshit. Because a prison is not made to be a punishment it is made with the intention to re-educate that person so it can function normal in society after he/she is set free. (Atleast in Europe)"

I was very careful to couch anything in that comment that was not concrete, with a qualifier. Feeling the need to declare anything in that comment to be ""opinion"" considering I did that, is being completely superfluous. Saying all of it was ""opinion"", is ludicrous.  Your writing is pretty bad, and your apparent grasp of what I was saying is pretty terrible, and it shouldn't be. I was quite clear. You're just not equipped to maturely discuss these issues at this level.  I never gave my ""opinion"" about anything related to morality. I simply stated what the current consensus is with regards to the ethics of incarceration and of retribution, which is absolutely pertinent. I was commenting on the real world judgement made by real people like the OP about whether Daud got off lightly. It has nothing to do with the fact that the character we are judging is fictional and lives in a world with different moral mores and norms. This is completely irrelevant and citing this shows you are struggling to follow the discussion.

If that's your claim, I disagree.  The number one reason people don't buy games nowadays is that the risk of trying a game you're not sure you'll like is too expensive, and nobody wants to wager a large amount of money for a product they might not enjoy. Games do not usually have a refund policy, they're very different from other types of products people can buy.   If anything, Dishonored's discounted prices help new players make a commitment to buying the game and playing it for themselves. Dishonored is also one of the most well-known and famous games of all time - having won Game of the Year 2013. Everyone has heard of it, and if someone's looking at Dishonored's price to begin with, chances are very good they're already thinking of buying it."

dishonored,3cygxz,SparkedSynapse,3,Mon Jul 13 07:29:28 2015 UTC,"It can be compared to pricing widgets higher than the competition. The gap in price can be illusory to the consumer, falsely (or, of course, perhaps truthfully) convincing the consumer of the quality of the product or brand. Additionally, the high price level is associated with the idea of prestige or an assumption of increased social utility.  Now, one can't be too sure of the same being true regarding video games. In my mind the relative objectivity in the quality of the game is significant and readily available to the public. It's difficult to know how this contributes to purchase decisions compared to price, subjective opinion, or consumer-directed research, for example. Most everything is varying shades of gray. So whether consumer opinion et. al or professional opinion matters more is up for both debate or research. However, it seems that they are employing a traditional pricing method to create and sustain the idea of product prestige, this motivated by level of demand in large part.  Sorry, got caught in the writing of this and rambled."

The only reason I can think that you would do this is if you just want the personal achievement of knowing the game better than anyone else. Also semi relevant: in the flooded district when you read The Whaler's bounty ledger it seems like the bounties pay very meager sums, simply not enough for an entire gang of grown and active assassins to live off of and also manage to purchase equipment.

Additionally, the graffiti on the wall says ""Howlers Come Out At Night."" Are they averse to sunlight? Does darkness provide a more comfortable environment for the Bloodflies inside them?

He does nothing that an ordinary human couldn't do, in theory. And like Batman, despite being a figure of fear, he chooses not to kill.  It's Steampunk to differentiate it from regular Batman, as Dishonored's setting is close enough to being steampunk for government work.  And honestly, it's just a name - the real point of the run is that it provides an interesting challenge and gives you a new appreciation for Dishonored's level design. You have to actually look through keyholes and lean around corners rather than just relying on Dark Vision. You can't easily escape from most situations, so you have to carefully evaluate guard patterns and sneak around them. You can't simply Blink straight to the target, so you have to develop a full understanding of each level and the various routes you can take through it.

Here, this explains it much better than i did: http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Chaos  And yes, the lighthouse is the last mission."
dishonored,3craaq,_konvikt_,-1,Fri Jul 10 03:35:43 2015 UTC,"So basically I've played the entire game wrong? I tried to either put guys to sleep or avoid people but there were certain sections where I couldn't find a way out except fighting, especially when guards were alerted and I had to fight my way out of a room killing four or five guards. Maybe there's ways around that but I couldn't ever figure them out, since sleep arrows are expensive and you can only carry a small amount of them, and doing stealth kill take downs was way faster than choke holding people when another guard is standing right there..  And it's the last mission.. wow that blows my mind. Granted it's a three year old game but I'm glad I didn't pay $60 for 11 hours of gameplay. I could understand if there was more...story but as /u/MozartInABlender points out theres info on Void Gods but unless that stuff is buried amongst all the books in the game...there's really no backstory for him, the cutscenes for him I can count on one hand, we get very little insight into how he is a god how he transfers powers why he does what he does. I dunno. I got the GOTY version so I've got whatever DLC came out for it, maybe that fleshes it out more? DH2 got me interested in the series but now I worry it's going to be extremely short on gameplay and light on story."
dishonored,3craaq,MozartInABlender,12,Fri Jul 10 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"You didn't play the game wrong. That's a core message of the game - there are no right or wrong choices. You just pick what you feel you need to do, and you live with the consequences. The Chaos system isn't a reward system, it just reflects the way your choices would impact the world. That's what makes the game so fun to replay. If you took a look at the little details, you'd see what I mean. Campbell's painting, the logbook, and then the bigger picture.  What I tried to say up there, is no, you didn't play the game wrong. You played it exactly how you wanted to, and the result of such is neither better or worse than what would have happened if you had not done what you did.  And yeah, the DLC are amazing. You should play them. And I honestly don't see how the game is light on story. Do you skip cutscenes often? Did you scour the map for everything? There's a lot you can miss here.  Edit: A good way to sum up the Chaos system is a non-spoiler quote from the DLC: ""I'd say I was being punished, but I know the world doesn't punish wicked people. We make our choices, and we take what comes. And the rest is Void."
dishonored,3craaq,MozartInABlender,-1,Fri Jul 10 04:27:02 2015 UTC,"I always watched the cutscenes since they contained a lot of story. And for a while early on I read a lot of the notes and books but a lot of it, early on at least, was related to various whalers or how technology is now based on the whale oil variety. Maybe I missed it but I never found many books that showed a lot of history of the world, or books on the Outsider, or any attempts to cure the plague aside from the exilir which I believe on staves it off with continued usage. I skipped a lot of bone charms and runes cause again they seemed to be in places where I'd need to out wit patrol guards or alarms and my stealth options seemed limited. I wanna learn more about the Void, about the Outsider, how Daud had an entire crew of assassin's with the same / similar powers to Corvo, was Daud a beta test of Corvo or did the Outsider just get bored with him and decide to play with Corvo? I wanna finish it but so many questions left."
dishonored,3craaq,_konvikt_,9,Fri Jul 10 04:41:10 2015 UTC,"The books generally contain the history about the world. The notes generally contain pertinent information about the immediate environment. It does in fact appear as if you missed out on a lot of books, notes, and audiographs. I won't blame you; if I weren't an obsessive reader, I doubt I would have read them all anyway.  In any case, I will answer your questions. But be warned - Spoilers. Do not read past this point if you want to find these things out for yourself.  SPOILERS BEGIN HERE     About the Void: The Void is implied to be an otherworld of the Dishonored universe, described as its beginning and its end. This implies that the world was created with some use or work with the Void, or that the world was created by it. It's also implied that when the whales become extinct, the Void will come and extinguish the night sky, presumably leading to an apocalypse. The Void appears to mirror the psyche of visitors, and also takes features from the real world. Think of it as a bit like Silent Hill, but without the malevolence. It's also implied that the Void is the afterlife, with Chaotic souls doomed to stay there until the world ends, and the more orderly souls sent off instead to non-existence. About the Outsider: The Void doesn't always have a Void Deity, but it always seeks one out if it doesn't. This is not always immediately executed after the loss of a Deity, and sometimes thousands of years pass before one is instated. The Void Deity is functionally immortal, but can die or lose their divinity by abdication, loss of will, or destruction in a calamitous event. The Outsider is not the first Void Deity. He might be the fifth, but I don't know where I heard that, so take it with some salt. He was once a human who lived through abusive power figures. What I read next, I can't recall, but suffice to say he goes on a journey and eventually, either by accident or by some design of the Void, slips through the cracks and finds himself in the Void. His consciousness expanded, and he became the very avatar, interpreter, and executor of the Void's undecipherable will. This isn't to say he's lost all semblance of his personality; it's just that seeing the world the way a god would see it tends to change the way you look at morality and life in general. This is why he takes no sides - the very ideas of good and evil are meaningless to a god. But, up to this day, he feels some measure of resentment to those who abuse their power, and tends to Mark people who he feels could have done great things if the hand they'd been dealt were better. Also, despite his divine powers, the Outsider is incapable of changing his appearance; perhaps he never felt the need to learn, or he simply just can't. In either case, the way the Outsider appears is the way he looked when he first fell into the Void so long ago by canon chronology, and has remained unchanged for five thousand years. About the Outsider's Mark: The Mark is what the Outsider brands onto Corvo's hand. It gives him a connection to the Void and the Outsider, and gives him some Supernatural Abilities. These Powers are not the same for all the Marked, and grow and adapt according to the bearer's personality. In-game, this manifests as Corvo having a very wide choice of ability types from offensive to otherwise. The Outsider is never really obligated to Mark anyone, and only really does so to people who he feels could do great things - if only they had a little help. He is not moralistic in this sense; to him, a benevolent ruler is as great as an autocratic tyrant or a psychopathic toppler of governments. Being a near-omniscient god is boring, and he wants to see you do great things - things that surprise even a god. About Daud: Daud was not a beta-test for Corvo. There are countless people who were Marked before Daud, and countless people who will be Marked after. Remember Granny Rags? She had the Mark. The Royal Torturer? Marked. Daud was marked fairly young, but even before that he was headed for a life of trouble - with his pseudo-witch of a mother and being sold off and all. It just sped him on his way, I think. The Outsider is in fact bored with Daud, but only because Daud became predictable and wasn't living up to his potential. About the Assassins: The Assassins, or the Whalers, as they are officially known, are Daud's colleagues and servants. Daud is different from Corvo in that he can share his Abilities to those who serve him. He doesn't control how much of his Powers they manifest - some don't get any Powers at all. Daud built up the Whalers from a collection of broken men; ex-mercenaries, disillusioned soldiers, street rats, men that the world had turned its back on. Daud took them in and gave them a place and a livelihood, and more important, a way to strike back at the world they feel had spurned them. Daud and his Whalers operate as Dunwall's most feared assassin den, being paid enormous sums for their services - which extend to a bit farther than just simple killing.      SPOILERS END HERE  A lot of what I said here could be gotten from the main story and DLC, but a lot of what I said here was released by developer commentary. If you have any more questions, just ask."

dishonored,3craaq,MozartInABlender,9,Sat Jul 11 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"konvikt made a mistake there.  If you kill over 20-30% of people in a level you will get high chaos. High chaos will have some negative effects like Samuel getting mad at you. He will NOT fire his gun. Some other stuff changes too but I won't spoil.  If you reach ultra-high chaos (not sure how many people you have to kill but a LOT, I'm guessing 50% of enemies) Samuel is pissed ánd he shoots his gun.  Sóme people have bugged games where they can only kill 3 people and they still get high chaos. This is not very common but not very rare either.  It's not wrong.. Many people start at high chaos, if you can next level try low chaos and you will see quite a few differences throughout the game. Definitely worth trying it both ways because that's where the game gets interesting. In the differences."

dishonored,3cj9zf,CaterpillarsNight,2,Wed Jul 8 16:33:26 2015 UTC,But the Overseer and twins were all in it. The Overseer saw Daud killing the empress and blamed Corvo. The twins held Emilie in the Golden Cat. They were all in it. Lady Boyle - as far as we know - wasn't.
dishonored,3cj9zf,olddoubleratbling,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"So was lady Boyle. She funded it directly, by paying the bounty for Doud. Even in the eyes of the law here, that's guilty."

The twins got to where they were by selling their power not that they were involved in plotting to kill the empress and the overseer was a thug they used to support Corvo as the assassin because he didn't know the truth and didn't actually see Daud he could be used as a true witness."
dishonored,3cj9zf,CaterpillarsNight,5,Wed Jul 8 16:55:51 2015 UTC,But the overseer taunts Corvo in the prison and the twins can be seen in the Void mistreating Emily and keeping her hostage. I have the feeling they were all in this just as much as the regent.
dishonored,3cj9zf,StarMagnus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"eh that's all kind of iffy to me. They're almost certainly bad people just like lady boyle but that doesn't mean they helped kill the empress. The game also gives you the opportunity to kill the torturer, slackjaw, and granny rags.

The Pendleton twins were extremely corrupt, cruel, and owned a slave mine with thousands of slaves. It's only just that they should experience what they've brought upon thousands.  And Campbell was also extremely corrupt, was a pervert, and made his way up in The Abbey through bribes and blackmail, which I have no doubt is considered high heresy deserving of the Heretic's Brand. If those things were known, he would have been branded long ago."
dishonored,3cj9zf,StarMagnus,9,Wed Jul 8 17:40:49 2015 UTC,I never said they didn't deserve punishment but that doesn't make their non lethal treatment any less cruel or evil. Even though they deserved it I would not call what Corvo did just since he had no authority to deliver punishment.
dishonored,3cj9zf,LoM3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"Corvo was the one who was framed for Jessamine's death, he's escaped from what seems to be one of the highest-security prisons and is actively working to take down the Lord Regent. I don't think he cares much about being ""just"".   Personally I took the non-lethal options for the kills because I found them more ironic than just killing them outright. The corrupt religious leader is branded a heretic and left in the plague-ridden streets, the political figures who have never done any sort of physical labor sent into their own silver mines, the noblewoman having an affair with the Lord Regent being put into the captivity of a creep, the Lord Regent having his secrets exposed through the same announcement system he used to spread his propaganda and sent to the same prison Corvo was forced to rot in..."
dishonored,3cj9zf,StarMagnus,2,Sun Jul 12 01:27:28 2015 UTC,This is a very well written out backstory for your character. In your version Corvo doesn't care about being just but in /u/Ucatsuton 's version he clearly felt Corvo was being just that's just the difference in how players wanted to interpret events.

The music becomes intense too, so you'll know when you're detected.  One of the things I hate ( strong word ) in Dishonored is that you can see if you got spotted or if you killed someone only at the end of a mission. Save often and make multiple saves. Sometimes I think no one saw me, or I killed no one, but at the end, I get 1 kill or something."

Another hint : make sure you leave any body you knocked out on a higher level than the floor. Otherwise rats will eat them up and it will count as a kill. Leave bodies on a bench, on a mattress, anything higher than leaving them on the ground.  If it's too high though, than can fall down and get killed because of the impact."

Something you might be interested in, in return: 1 petal level means head-tracking, their head follows the point of interest. 2 levels means body tracking, they actually turn and face directly towards the disturbance. The third and final level is full alertness, they call out and sprint towards it. It's then that they detect you (the turning red and disappearing).  P.S. NPCs have random head movement. Sometimes they'll look over their shoulder to the left. Sometimes they'll look straight up to the right. You've always got to be ready to be noticed and to escape before you are detected."
dishonored,3cn2e4,MrPin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"Stealth playthrough isn't that hard IMO even on very hard. Its important to remember you have 10 of each potion and if you find yourself in a pinch, don't be afraid to abuse blink. You'll find a remedy somewhere to replace the little lost mana. Also, Intermission detection doesn't count. you can kill the two weepers in the hound pit's sewers and be detected by them and it won't count for any achievements. Just something extra: Havelock says in one of his audio recordings that he will find a way to test Corvo's abilities for himself. I Speculate he found a way to put the Weeper in the sewers as some sort of test for Corvo."

I then have to end up replaying the mission sometimes more than once playing the exact same way each time before it decides that I never killed anyone, wastes SO MUCH TIME. Really hope in dishonored 2 you don't have to wait until the end of each mission to see those stats"

They said that you play as Emily for the first half hour or so and then 'something really big' happens and you are forced to make a choice, and from that point on you're locked into the character you chose.  The only alternative I can think why the other character wouldn't be around would be them being captured (since neither Corvo nor Badass-Prince Emily would just sit around doing nothing while the other one is in danger), and that would be kinda repetitive, and wouldn't fit Emily's new character at all."

dishonored,3ci9po,TheRecherche,35,Wed Jul 8 03:01:51 2015 UTC,That would be the most abusable skill in the game if you had the mana potions to spam it. You could walk through the whole level and roll back time whenever someone saw you.
dishonored,3ci9po,zephyrdragoon,18,Wed Jul 8 03:21:28 2015 UTC,As opposed to players just quickloading after being spotted? It would atleast be an ingame alternative to people looking to ghost missions.

I think that due to the nature of the powers in the game there will always be abusable things if the player really want to cheese it like that.

dishonored,3ci9po,zephyrdragoon,17,Wed Jul 8 03:43:03 2015 UTC,I think one that speeds up time for everyone else but makes you less noticeable and immobile for the duration sounds cool. Have it drain mana as long as you hold down the button and stop when you release. Use it to watch patrol routes or get guards to go by you faster.   Alternatively its a spell you use on an enemy/object and it jumps them forwards in time by 2 seconds or something.

On another I grew to like games where stealth is the primary playstyle and combat mechanic come just between being caught and dying. I realised that in stealth games where combat mechanic are missing or bad I quicksave/quickload very often: effective but not immersive. Hitman on harder difficulty modes is a good example: the best way to achieve a level is to do it completely unnoticed... but if you're unlucky, since there is limited saves, you feel obligated to at least try to fight your way out."

dishonored,3chtob,MozartInABlender,4,Thu Jul 9 07:56:39 2015 UTC,"Perfectly serious. The Void doesn't always have a Void Deity, but it always seeks one out if it doesn't. This is not always immediately executed after the loss of a Deity, and sometimes thousands of years pass before one is instated. The Void Deity is functionally immortal, but can die or lose their divinity by abdication, loss of will, or destruction in a calamitous event.  The Outsider is not the first Void Deity. He might be the fifth, but I don't know where I heard that, so take it with some salt. He was once a human who lived through abusive power figures. What I read next, I can't recall, but suffice to say he goes on a journey and eventually, either by accident or by some design of the Void, slips through the cracks and finds himself in the Void.  His consciousness expanded, and he became the very avatar, interpreter, and executor of the Void's undecipherable will. This isn't to say he's lost all semblance of his personality; it's just that seeing the world the way a god would see it tends to change the way you look at morality and life in general. This is why he takes no sides - the very ideas of good and evil are meaningless to a god. But, up to this day, he feels some measure of resentment to those who abuse their power, and tends to Mark people who he feels could have done great things if the hand they'd been dealt were better.  Also, despite his divine powers, the Outsider is incapable of changing his appearance; perhaps he never felt the need to learn, or he simply just can't. In either case, the way the Outsider appears is the way he looked when he first fell into the Void so long ago by canon chronology, and has remained unchanged for five thousand years.  Hope that made sense."

And indeed, the Slaughterhouse and Legal district are the best maps in my opinion, and it's a shame you don't get much opportunity for powers.  Perhaps if Daud had started with level 1 summon assassin, and blink 2 only cost 3 runes, then there would be room for a passive upgrade as well as those 2, and you get to summon assassins from the start for some more variety."

dishonored,3ccr3t,deeplywombat,7,Mon Jul 6 22:52:09 2015 UTC,Although Brigmore Witches tells you if it can't find a save file for KoD so that should tip you off about the order of the DLC

dishonored,3ccr3t,OttovanZanten,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well the way it goes is Dishonored and the DLCS happen somewhat simultaneously with Brigmore Witches being more towards the end of the game, personally I'd just play through the main game, go onto KoD, then Brigmore Witches.

That'd mean it probably won't be as overpowered in Dishonored 2 as Blink was, as a stealth tool at least."
dishonored,3cd3xm,MozartInABlender,2,Tue Jul 7 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know. The pull itself seems very fast, but the initial lunge isn't. Do you think seeing the tendril alerts people?"

dishonored,3ceiwu,OttovanZanten,6,Thu Jul 9 06:11:29 2015 UTC,"So... female protagonist, the weird tentacle-blink, location, militarized setting and robots are the same.  That first one was obvious, it's 2015, of course there's gonna be a female protagonist. The location has been named a couple of times and is relevant, so that it takes place there isn't a strange thing either. Since time has progressed the existence of robots aren't too strange either. Clockwork robots are the coolest (dr. Who anyone?)  In DH1 there was a very obvious parallel between real life and the game, specifically about the rapid advancement of technology, the sudden wealth it brings while at the same time witches and sorcerers were seen as a threat to society and are taken care of, while nobody can point out the exact difference of science and sorcery. If DH2 also draws a parallel between RL and the game world, it's not unthinkable that in DH2 there is a militarized setting, considering the Western world has been waging wars constantly for over 200 years.  So all in all the odds that both you and just one person in their huge team has come up with the same aren't that slim if you ask me. Just like you, the developers have thought about this story and have thought about what makes sense in a sequel. If, however, there are some specific details that you put in that file that you saw in the trailer or you know they are working on I am very interested. For instance if you have an old sketch of Emily's ability and it actually looks like what she uses in the trailer, that would be something. But still far from proof since all the other things can easily be just a coincidence.  Edit: Also... Mercedes and Audi once stole my designs. I never sent them my designs though. I thought they were modern and interesting, but now we all know the A-class and the TT and in hindsight they were far from revolutionary. Obviously I hadn't designed them in as much detail as they had, I was just a kid and they were slightly crude, but they looked a Lot like it nonetheless if you focus less on the details and more about the overall shape. This happened in a pretty short time and reminded me that there's about 7 billion people and only so many possible ideas. This kind of stuff is bound to happen."

dishonored,3ceiwu,vampqueen86,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:24:54 2015 UTC,"It's kind of the year of the female protagonist, also diversity is a hot topic in the last years. Especially if the story easily allows it (which in this case it certainly does) the odds of a female protagonist are not slim right now.  (I should have added that there were hints in DH1 about the overseer visiting Emily, it's not the times we live in but also the story that makes a female protagonist likely)"
dishonored,3ceiwu,Aghastated,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really. People praise the 2015 E3 for being ""diverse"" and ""inclusive,"" despite E3 2014 having a greater amount of female protagonists. Funnily enough, those same people were calling E3 2014 a misogynistic trash heap.  A few people may be slinging the buzzwords on Twitter, but the industry isn't exactly bending over to accommodate them."
dishonored,3ceiwu,SparkedSynapse,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:35:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, I saw some video's filled with female-protagonist-game-trailers back to back and it gave me the impression that there's a buttload. Also social media yea... Not sure about exact numbers, but I'd guesstimate definitely more then 3 years ago.  IMO it's going in the right direction in the right pace. If everybody suddenly made female protagonists in every game it would feel even more forced and like they made it more diverse just for diversity's sake, not because it fits well in the games. If you force change you will create opposition."
dishonored,3ceiwu,Aghastated,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:08:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly the main reason I chose Emily to be protagonist is because I really like female lead characters when they're done right. Not that oversexualized or ""bad bitch"" or whiny BS they pull on almost everything. I came with a different character at first, called Alicia Foxburrow, but ended up scrapping that because of some plot holes and chose Emily because it would a bit more sense although a bit cliché."
dishonored,3ceiwu,Aghastated,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"As for the amount of games with female leads, there aren't that many compared to the amount of male leads. Which I don't understand why is it an issue. A character is a fucking character. People can't just ask for female leads and expected devs and writers to just change them for no reason. The sex of the character can really determine the feel and mood of a story especially if it's story-driven (i.e Uncharted vs Tomb Raider)."
dishonored,3ceiwu,Aghastated,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:21:23 2015 UTC,"No there are still fewer then male leads, however I think it's definitely getting evened out over time. Albeit slowly.  Totally agree with the rest of your post. You can't just force it, you gotta give the developers time to adjust the story to accomodate it."
dishonored,3ceiwu,CadenFerraro,0,Thu Jul 9 22:25:00 2015 UTC,"I guess what you're saying makes sense, but it's just so odd seeing something in trailers that you had only imagined was pretty odd for me. I don't really know how to explain it, but I guess you could relate somehow, with your whole car thing. By the way, of course some general aspects could be similar, that would no issue, but the female protagonist is Emily Kaldwin, so it's a specific character. The dark tether (what i had called it) is like a spider-man-ish way to replace blink, the location is exactly the same city and province, military setting vs the dystopian slums-like settings of the first game and robots well, robots lol. It's the fact that those small details are exactly the same that made me think about this whole thing."
dishonored,3ceiwu,_FRANKENSTEIN_,3,Sat Jul 11 10:48:21 2015 UTC,"So you are claiming someone at Arkane Studios stole your fan fiction and used it in the creation of the sequel of Dishonored.  Well if what you wrote was a derivative work of the original game and its mechanics then there was bound to be some overlap in terms of locations and abilities. If you had/have an idea wholly original that has appeared in the media then you have leg to stand on, but until I see something more concrete than a rejection email I'm not convinced."
dishonored,3ceiwu,_FRANKENSTEIN_,-2,Tue Jul 7 16:20:07 2015 UTC,"It's happened before, in most cases they just credit the fan saying 'he contributed' opr they thank ""the community"" saying 'oh this was inspired by our fans' or something along the lines etc.   And I'm not asking for compensation, credit or anything.
