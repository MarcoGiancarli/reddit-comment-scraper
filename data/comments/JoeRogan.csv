JoeRogan,3e1cym,nothumbnails,6,Tue Jul 21 05:09:44 2015 UTC,Rogan plays the Ice House all the time... just isn't a part of Redban's thing anymore.
JoeRogan,3e1cym,thebza451XBO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:35:11 2015 UTC,Redbans thing?  You mean deathsquad?  It seems strange that Joe would stop appearing on the podcast.
JoeRogan,3e1cym,puckfirate,5,Tue Jul 21 11:26:59 2015 UTC,"JRE is more its own thing than being a part of the Deathsquad network.  They're both affiliated at best.  I haven't listened to Ice House Chronicles in some time, but I've heard about a lapse in quality, so that could be an issue.  Plus, I really doubt Joe has the time to be sitting around shooting the shit with comedians on yet another podcast, especially if he is at the Store more these days."
JoeRogan,3e1cym,Petworth_dude,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:49 2015 UTC,"My theory is Redban, Ari, Duncan, and Joey all wanted to seperate their ""brands"" a little bit. They way they grow their own followings and are full self sufficient."

JoeRogan,3e1cym,ButtGardener,2,Tue Jul 21 12:04:27 2015 UTC,"There seems to have been some divergence between Joe and Redban over the past year. And Joe hasn't been on any death squad related podcast that I have heard.   Redban is not on any JRE podcast that has serious guests or guests he does not know anymore. He usually appears when it's comedians that are mutual friends.   It's a shame,  before they had great chemistry.  Yeah,  Redban would say some stupid shit but it was funny non the less.    I feel that Joe just had enough of it and wanted to step up the podcast's quality,  he always references Adam Carolla's podcast and how he looks up to that setup.    Now Joe has brought in Jamie,  he's mentioned he's moving to a new location and the overall quality has been much improved.  I'm fine with Joe trying to make the podcast more professional but I would love from time to time of he just did a Joe and Redban podcast again.. Sometimes when he had no guest he and Redban would just shoot the shit for an episode."
JoeRogan,3e1cym,Petworth_dude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:27 2015 UTC,"There are a couple threads that address this, so a few items:   Brian has a lot of things going on these days, namely his comedy.  He doesn't have the time to be a co-host on every episode. Not sure if Joe and Brian are in mutual agreement on this, but Joe doesn't think that Brian is the best fit for most non-comedian guests, which is why you only hear from him with certain comedians.  I get that sometimes with the more serious guests, Joe gets too preachy and having Redban say something off-kilter is helpful, but sometimes he can just be downright idiotic and a huge distraction.  Not to mentioned that asking a female guest if she squirts is more than a little inappropriate and disrespectful (that being said, I am still a Redban fan - Olive Garden Butthole for life). The podcast is changing and evolving over time.  It's no longer the days and Joe and Brian are recording it from their respective houses.  JRE is one of the most popular podcasts out there, and Joe wants a certain level of quality and professionalism for what he's putting out there.  As a producer, Brian just doesn't have the time or focus to deliver that level of expertise, and he's too prone to screwing around, pulling up pictures of cat buttholes and other nonsense.  That's why Joe now has a dedicated studio and Jamie as a producer, etc. There are still some old-school style podcasts with Brian and Joe.  They're very in frequent and I wish they'd happen more, but they do happen."

JoeRogan,3dpkcr,arbivark,2,Sat Jul 18 12:50:30 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of Shit-Ass Pet fuckers :      An infamous chain of pet stores. They've reached popularity by having the employees be excessively rude to whoever enters a Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers store; the most common greeting being, ""Get the fuck out of here, you idiot!"" that is usually accompanied by being kicked out.  Some have managed to get past the rude employees to find that there is only one can of dog food in each store, and it costs a million dollars. Nobody has ever bought one.  Another calling card of Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers is that they fuck your pet if you ever go into the store. If you didn't bring your pet when going in, they'll find it and fuck it, wherever it is.  All Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers stores have a trademark of having a gigantic yellow sign accompanying each building that reads, ""Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers"" in big letters.  Even though Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers has never made a profit, business is going great for them. Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers has several million stores all over the country and is showing no signs of ever going out of business. They have Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers buildings neighboring other Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers buildings they are doing so well. Every Star-Bucks coffee shop has at least five Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers surrounding them.  Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers has received several complaints and demands of changing their strategies and ethics, all to no avail. It seems that Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers will be around for decades longer.     Damn those Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers. They fuck your pet. Dog food costs $1,000,000! That's clearly overpriced!  Shit-Ass Pet Fuckers may not only be the worst pet store in the world, but possibly the worst store in general in the world.  Don't like it? Fuckin' screw!

I, myself, am a bit of a Fanboy, I do not think there is anything wrong with that unless you make that person who you are a fan of something they are not.  I have been a Joe Rogan fan for about 10 years now and I love his comedy and am a huge fan but I see him for what he is, an Entertainer.  His podcasts are not philosophy lessons and not something I need to live by, they are just pure entertainment and I think the people in JR2 forgot about this and fell into a ""worship"" sort of state and forgot what the podcast actually is, therefore when they snapped out of it got pissed because of there ignorance, thus projecting there very odd emotions onto a comedian."

JoeRogan,3dn21e,vomitshoveru,4,Sat Jul 18 14:29:20 2015 UTC,"I dunno if all of them are hurt but I think the comment has a point.  I first started listening to Joe Rogan around the late 100's.  I was hooked in the beginning consuming every single podcast he put out. It was glorious. Mostly because at the time I was super angry with the world and I had no outlet to have the conversations that were put on his show. So JRE really did help me, the whole be a better person, don't be a hater, live your own life, views on drugs,  different views on society and the institution, we are all just monkeys, type of mentality was awesome. Conversations about cool shit with (what I thought at the time) in depth discussions about pretty much everything. It really helped me calm down and become a better person.   That was probably 2-3 years ago and I've radically changed as a person. I think Joe has changed too. The podcasts have completely different tones to them. As much as Brian is an idiot sometimes, I felt like he was and should still be part of the show. Joe's rants got old, he started being a little more aggressive imo. I would say the podcasts started getting a little cringe worthy for me.   So am I hurt from his change? no. JRE came into my life at the perfect time and I understand all good things don't last. I agree with you that people put him on a pedestal that was shattered from something, thus the buthurtness and the creating and continuation of Joerogan2 is born. Some people are just haters because Joe has gotten a lot bigger, some people just want to troll, some probably do have some deep rooted mental issues against him. The amount of time and effort put into that sub is kinda astounding. My only problem with it, is it does leak into this sub where it kinda starts to become an annoyance. This place has been completely hijacked by that Steal_from_Aspery cat.   TLDR: People change so do podcasts, roll with or don't."

I could be wrong about this, but I think Sfa's comments come from a place of unrequited hope.  I think he looks up to Rogan and wants him to be a hero rather than a villian.  Many of us had high hopes for the JRE (and podcasts/internet in general) to fill a hole in our lives that the people in our hometowns aren't able to fill.  Unfortunately, the pig-headed nature of a comedian shows its ugly head a few times every episode, and Sfa decided to dedicate his JRE time to calling Rogan out.. on all of it.  Incredibly misguided, sure.  But if anything, it takes more courage to criticize than it does to wax poetic about how it makes you feels, so I give him that much.."

JoeRogan,3dfdhb,obvom,2,Thu Jul 16 01:28:32 2015 UTC,"The Chiron Volumes is just stuff from his blog, which you can read for free at chirontraining. blogspot. not necessary. Meditations on Violence should be mandatory. It was his first book and basically a mind dump of the fundamental disconnect between ""self defense"" as taught in many martial arts and violence as it occurs in the world. It outlines the 7 mandatory aspects self defense training, of which knowing how to fight is but one, and how to incorporate those into most martial arts. there's a lot of psychology and criminology in here, which is complimentary to Grossman's On Killing. Facing Violence is a more in depth look on the 7 aspects from both the perspectives of the victim as well as the decisions and influences of a criminal that perpetrates purposeful violence. It's golden just for the Avoidance, the Freeze, and After care sections alone. There's a lot of stuff regarding integrating the 7 aspects into any martial art training which he often stresses. There are details describing how to appear more like a ""hard target"" to avoid becoming a victim in the first place. There's also a good portion about escalation and appropriate use of force, which hardly ever gets taught. It's a very good book. Scaling Violence isn't really necessary, either, as it's just more in depth discussion on escalation of force and appropriate use as it applies to the 7 aspects and their legal consequences, but it's a good book none the less. A lot more about social violence as well as stuff like intimidation and when and how it would be legally appropriate to scalar self defense. A lot more information on deescalation and avoidance, though I prefer Verbal Judo on verbal conflict resolution over this. Drills is mostly a revised and condensed edition of the Chiron Training volumes without the rants. It's good if you want a quick explanation or reference, but most of it can be found on his blog for free. As for the rest, they are either obscure or not self defense related, like 'Working with an Interpreter"". Any other questions, feel free to ask."

JoeRogan,3d71lp,dwarfstar91,19,Tue Jul 14 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, so google has image recognition software that is used to determine what is in an image. the image recognition software has thousands of reference images of known things, which it compares to an image it is trying to recognise. So if you provide it with the image of a dog and tell it to recognize the image, it will compare the image to it's references, find out that there are similarities in the image to images of dogs, and it will tell you ""there's a dog in that image!"" But what if you use that software to make a program that looks for dogs in images, and then you give it an image with no dog in and tell it that there is a dog in the image? The program will find whatever looks closest to a dog, and since it has been told there must be a dog in there somewhere, it tells you that is the dog. Now what if you take that program, and change it so that when it finds a dog-like feature, it changes the dog-like image to be even more dog-like? Then what happens if you feed the output image back in? What happens is the program will find the features that looks even the tiniest bit dog-like and it will make them more and more doglike, making doglike faces everywhere. Even if you feed it white noise, it will amplify the slightest most minuscule resemblance to a dog into serious dog faces. This is what Google did. They took their image recognition software and got it to feed back into it's self, making the image it was looking at look more and more like the thing it thought it recognized. The results end up looking really trippy. It's not really anything to do with dreams IMO Edit: Man this got big. I'd like to address some inaccuracies or misleading statements in the original post... I was using dogs an example. The program clearly doesn't just look for dog, and it doesn't just work off what you tell it to look for either. It looks for ALL things it has been trained to recognize, and if it thinks it has found the tiniest bit of one, it'll amplify it as described. (I have seen a variant that has been told to look for specific things, however). However, it turns out the reference set includes a heck of a lot of dog images because it was designed to enable a recognition program to tell between different breeds of dog (or so I hear), which results in a dog-bias. I agree that it doesn't compare the input image directly with the reference set of images. It compares reference images of the same thing to work out in some sense what makes them similar, this is stored as part of the program, and then when an input image is given for it to recognize, it judges it against the instructions it learned from looking at the reference set to determine if it is similar.

JoeRogan,3d71lp,cross-joint-lover,-6,Tue Jul 14 11:36:34 2015 UTC,"It's been said multiple times on different episodes. He initially bought his own ""game bred"" pitbull off of the monstrosity of a ""person"" who breeds them and being so impressed with this feat of manliness Callen insisted on being brought by Joe to buy one himself. Exact episode numbers I am unsure of, I know the last time it was mentioned was on a podcast with Bryan Callen about 1-2 years ago and it was the part about Joe bringing Callen to buy one and was only mentioned in passing. They discussed it in a lot more detail on multiple older shows with and without Callen though. Once again while I cannot give exact episode numbers I distinctly remember hearing it for the first time when I first started listening to the podcast so when they were sponsored by fleshlight, roughly ep 60-150. I know this is very vague but it was mentioned on at least 3 or 4 episodes so someone on here has to be able to point us in the right direction   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbInhc52Yt8  In the last half of this video he sure seems to know a lot about dog fighting, how they're bred and how they fight them... still looking for exact source though  https://youtu.be/PiNp4E8e9y8?t=1h4m  Proof he gave financial support to the lowest of the low, dog fighters."

Edit: also Tait Fletcher, who was organs bodyguard for years, has said he doesn't see the problem with pitbulls fighting because ""they want to"" on his most recent appearance on punch drunk sports.
