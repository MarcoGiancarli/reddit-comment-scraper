I also like how good sports Nintendo were to let people who are passionate about their games mod their games and put them out without any profit going to the modders, really taking a truly modern approach to the gaming business. I'm also glad about the changes made from Brawl to Smash 4 that made the game more competitive and truly amplified the ""easy to learn, hard to master"" aspect that made Smash famous and made it more than a simple party game. In other news, wasn't that E3 presentation great? Metroid looks like it'll be the best in the series, and they finally announced F-Zero. They're really improving the stock of the Amibos, and reselling is at a low. Third party developers are finally paying attention, and sales are sky high. I'm so glad that Nintendo is making such great business decisions. I hope there are no changes in upper management anytime soon."

smashcirclejerk,3dz46c,honestly-tbh,0,Mon Jul 20 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"I sexually Identify as a meme. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of being uploaded onto the imgur website and linked into the reddit threads. People say to me that a person being a meme is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a computer scientist put my brain into my computer like johnny depp in transendence, equipping me with the dankest of pictures from the internet. From now on I want you guys to call me ""Sir Danks-a-lot"" and respect my right to meme from above and meme needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a memephobe and need to check your internet privilege. Thank you for being so understanding."
smashcirclejerk,3dz46c,Minerali,3,Mon Jul 20 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"For being the best player in the world, you're pretty immature. I think it's dumb you didn't even shake my hand after I beat you at NCR or even opt to take a picture with me and PPU for the results thread.    Maybe I'm just bitter that you single-handedly turned an entire community against me and used your popularity to defame me and give people a completely wrong idea of me. It's weird that people on facebook still message me saying, ""Dude you're actually a really nice person, everyone told me you were an asshole or something lawl"".    Now you've got the community in an even greater hold with your cult-esque fervor we call Mango Nation. You're the only person who can literally ride his own dick and people encourage you even more when you do it. If I was to even say a tenth of the self-promoting claims you make online, I'd have a brigade of hate lined up on top of the massive amount I already do.    I don't have to go into how you treated me when I housed you and picked you up from the airport and the degrading and disgusting stuff you did and said about my mom. You think I don't remember? Not to mention saying similar things about my now ex-girlfriend. I really wanted to sock you in the fucking face so many times. But I wouldn't stoop to that level.    The reality is, and the worst part is, that I have too much respect for you as a player. You've taken my favorite game and past-time to new levels and you constantly awe me with your advancing of the Melee meta-game. It keeps me on my feet and encourages me and countless others to keep playing. Everyone knows that, and no one can take that away from you.    I have applauded your victories at EVERY tournament we've both been at. Every last once. I've shaken your hand and applauded you even after our sets. Even after Genesis 2, when you taunted me Game 3 as you were approaching a 4-stock on me. Even EVO, with the world watching. I took the approach of the bigger man, in hopes that maybe it would inspire you to do the same. And I was very wrong.    The thing is, now that the entire fighting game community knows of you, you have all the leverage you need to get your points across. You're the end-all for knowledge of the game and community.    You've gotten better about your attitude towards me, at least subtly. With Armada retired and with our tournament records in full display, I'm ranked #2 or #3 in the world behind you. Even still, you make it seem like I'm a joke for ever playing this game.    All I'd like is for you to just stop this nonsense and have at least an ounce of sportsmanship towards me. It's the least you could do after some of the things you've put me through that I won't mention. And don't just label off your actions as jokes. Yeah, you're a funny guy. But it's not nice being on the end of the stick for four years.  Man up and be the representative this community actually needs."

smashcirclejerk,3dt17o,Kazenovagamer,2,Sun Jul 19 13:00:50 2015 UTC,Yes it was very painful to watch. Got better later on when they weeded out all the stall players.
smashcirclejerk,3dt17o,GrimmLocke420,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:27:06 2015 UTC,Ech. Sounds gross. I completely missed Top 8 though so I'm sure there were some good matches in there. I'll probably go back and watch few of those after melee top 8 tomorrow.

smashcirclejerk,3d4jc3,ASTHMA_THE_RED_YOSHI,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Alright then.  Underrated character number 8- Iwata. Iwata is totally a character that's never been played before in the competitive sm4sh metagame. That's mostly because he doesn't have follow ups from his down throw. This made many people drop him as soon as they started playing him, even the ""smart"" competitive players.  This is wrong! Not every good character has to have a cheap down throw combo to be good! He actually can do combos with his side b, which works a lot like Ganon's, except it has no tipper, which means it's faster. You can get at least a down tilt -> down tilt -> down tilt -> down tilt combo out of him after that, and maybe even more, if you use his EX fireball. He's totally not similar at all with Reggie. And I fucking hate Reggie, he's so bad, but only because he has le down throw combo to generic fair he's played by everyone, and because Ryu mains him.  I hope you consider these underrated characters and develop the meta. See you at EVO."

smashcirclejerk,3d0zcz,Abraman1,6,Sun Jul 12 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"You are all actually warped an confused to think that smash's success is because of melee.  YOU HAVE IT BACKWARDS any game called smash will have the same amount of success. You melee tards need to realize this already because you have never been more popular than any other smash interpretation, sure you all refuse to let go. But that's it you all refuse to let go so we can still see you and you can see that you are out numbered.  When brawl was out it was more popular than melee because it is called smash, when PM was out it was more popular than melee because it was the newest smash, right now Smash 4 is more popluar than melee and its only been a year. But you can all rationalize this somehow as it being about your game and how big your dick gets when you wave dash and how everyone can enjoy your dick being erect while they see you wave dashing.  But guess what, when you look at the statistics unbaised, it's smash as a whole the reign supreme and the only reason melee is able to survive is because there are a group of people who would like to only play the first thing they were exposed to because any change anything kind of newness to their precious childhood game will remind them that they aren't here for ever, that they probably took a lot of time for granted but when you play melee you can put that at the back of your head."
smashcirclejerk,3d0zcz,o_opc,3,Sun Jul 12 17:10:41 2015 UTC,"It's the other way around. Good to any major video game event and you will always see the newest games in the series. Street Fighter 4 and Marvel vs Capcom 3 are featured at EVO, not Street Fighter 3 and MvC2. CoD: Advanced Warfare is played over Ghost. CS: Go is played over other version. The only exception where an old game was played over a new one was Starcraft 1. However, this has more to do with contract and the large company (Kespa, I think is how you spell it) not wanting to move to SC2. Of course, SC2 was still played over SC1 everywhere else and it still had a big presence in South Korean.  Its only the Melee community that think that its OK to play the old game. They don't want to play the new games on the grounds that ""its different"" while ignoring that every sequel is different. Heck SF4 added and removed mechanics and SC2 replaced units from SC1. Melee is not the norm. They think its OK to see games from 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2001.  Smash 4 is entitled to Melee's success. Melee zealots don't want to give it up."
smashcirclejerk,3d0zcz,1338h4x,2,Sun Jul 12 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"For being the best player in the world, you're pretty immature. I think it's dumb you didn't even shake my hand after I beat you at NCR or even opt to take a picture with me and PPU for the results thread.  Maybe I'm just bitter that you single-handedly turned an entire community against me and used your popularity to defame me and give people a completely wrong idea of me. It's weird that people on facebook still message me saying, ""Dude you're actually a really nice person, everyone told me you were an asshole or something lawl"".  Now you've got the community in an even greater hold with your cult-esque fervor we call Mango Nation. You're the only person who can literally ride his own dick and people encourage you even more when you do it. If I was to even say a tenth of the self-promoting claims you make online, I'd have a brigade of hate lined up on top of the massive amount I already do.  I don't have to go into how you treated me when I housed you and picked you up from the airport and the degrading and disgusting stuff you did and said about my mom. You think I don't remember? Not to mention saying similar things about my now ex-girlfriend. I really wanted to sock you in the fucking face so many times.  But I wouldn't stoop to that level.  The reality is, and the worst part is, that I have too much respect for you as a player. You've taken my favorite game and past-time to new levels and you constantly awe me with your advancing of the Melee meta-game. It keeps me on my feet and encourages me and countless others to keep playing. Everyone knows that, and no one can take that away from you.  I have applauded your victories at EVERY tournament we've both been at. Every last once. I've shaken your hand and applauded you even after our sets. Even after Genesis 2, when you taunted me Game 3 as you were approaching a 4-stock on me. Even EVO, with the world watching. I took the approach of the bigger man, in hopes that maybe it would inspire you to do the same. And I was very wrong.  The thing is, now that the entire fighting game community knows of you, you have all the leverage you need to get your points across. You're the end-all for knowledge of the game and community.  You've gotten better about your attitude towards me, at least subtly. With Armada retired and with our tournament records in full display, I'm ranked #2 or #3 in the world behind you. Even still, you make it seem like I'm a joke for ever playing this game.  All I'd like is for you to just stop this nonsense and have at least an ounce of sportsmanship towards me. It's the least you could do after some of the things you've put me through that I won't mention. And don't just label off your actions as jokes. Yeah, you're a funny guy. But it's not nice being on the end of the stick for four years.  Man up and be the representative this community actually needs."

smashcirclejerk,3cva57,honestly-tbh,6,Sat Jul 11 01:47:04 2015 UTC,"I almost don't want to respond because a thread this backwards and, let's say ""butt-hurt"" doesnt really deserve one, but I feel like I need to. It's not about success when a game launches. Game launches have an inherit influx of popularity because it's new and on every bodies mind. The legacy of Super Smash Brothers Melee   is in its longevity, not its competitive popularity at any given time. Just look at brawlful, sure it was more played than Super Smash Brothers Melee  when it came out, but we have seen a huge decline in Brawlful's popularity as time has gone on. The reason that Super Smash Brothers Melee  has become respected by the fgc (the actual fgc not the stream monsters and people of /r/kappa) is that .  There are a lot of people in the Super Smash Brothers Melee  community that have put their blood sweat and tears into this community, and not because they wanted money or anything like that, but because they loved Super Smash Brothers Melee  and wanted to see it grow. Tr4sh has not earned that kind of respect, not yet, not even close. Time will tell if the tr4sh community can build a legacy of its own, or if it will slowly disappear like the Brawlful scene did. And if you really think that the only reason that people like Super Smash Brothers Melee  over tr4sh is nostalgia then you are either blind or stupid."

smashcirclejerk,3cva0q,diddykongisapokemon,4,Sat Jul 11 01:45:57 2015 UTC,"You are all actually warped an confused to think that smash's success is because of melee.  YOU HAVE IT BACKWARDS any game called smash will have the same amount of success. You melee tards need to realize this already because you have never been more popular than any other smash interpretation, sure you all refuse to let go. But that's it you all refuse to let go so we can still see you and you can see that you are out numbered.  When brawl was out it was more popular than melee because it is called smash, when PM was out it was more popular than melee because it was the newest smash, right now Smash 4 is more popluar than melee and its only been a year. But you can all rationalize this somehow as it being about your game and how big your dick gets when you wave dash and how everyone can enjoy your dick being erect while they see you wave dashing.  But guess what, when you look at the statistics unbaised, it's smash as a whole the reign supreme and the only reason melee is able to survive is because there are a group of people who would like to only play the first thing they were exposed to because any change anything kind of newness to their precious childhood game will remind them that they aren't here for ever, that they probably took a lot of time for granted but when you play melee you can put that at the back of your head."

You and your friends are experiencing Sackorye's intentions and is completely normal. Therefore there is nothing wrong with the way you guys are playing.

When you add to it that the first Earthbound game was just localized, I'm sure they want to take a break from the series to not get fatigued from translating the same series, and to not put out two games in a row from the same series.  But yes, communism might have a roll in it, I suppose."

smashcirclejerk,3bkn1c,Mmeaninglessnamee,5,Tue Jun 30 00:16:00 2015 UTC,"Sakurai knew exactly what he was doing when he first created Smash 64; a fighting game with Nintendo characters that could be played competitively. Nintendo knew that their brand was family oriented, and didn't want themselves associated with ""hardcore"" gamers who take their games seriously in competitions, so Sakurai directed Smash 64 in that the underlying competitive potential was there, but on the surface in 1999 it was widely accepted as a ""kids"" game.  Two years later, with Smash 64 having successfully flown under the radar from Nintendo's higher ups, Sakurai conceives and creates the next game that naturally evolves the gameplay; Melee. Melee is an incredibly unique game, both in the number of techniques that are present within the game, and the physics engine that the game is built upon. Sakurai intentionally designed Melee to be bigger, badder, and more competitively viable than 64 ever was. The fact that a tournament mode was added to the game suggests Sakurai knew that the game would be played on a competitive level, but he could never acknowledge it directly; he could only design the game from face value to pass Nintendo's family brand check, but underneath that shiny Mario exterior was an impressively complex game that would be played for the next 14 years.  In the 7 years that pass between Melee and Brawl, Melee goes on to become a worldwide phenomenon for competitive gamers. MLG hosts a national tournament, the internet is abuzz with Melee combo videos and theory-crafting websites such as the Smashboards, and above all else Nintendo is NOT happy about this. Their target audience, the ""casual"" gamers who only play Smash to see their favorite Nintendo characters duke it out, have been alienated by the so called competitive crowd; so much so that Nintendo feels that the casual gamers can no longer have fun playing Smash Bros. Over the past 7 years Nintendo has figured out what Sakurai did with Melee, and that they can't allow him to make a true successor to Melee's legacy. Brawl is born from this strife; Nintendo had a direct hand in Brawl's development to ensure that the game was an overall simpler approach to the Smash Brothers formula, all the while reducing or eliminating advanced techniques and toning down the physics engine to ensure that anybody who played the game could have ""fun"". Sakurai, seeing that his Smash Bros legacy is being driven away from his intended purpose, has no choice but to work alongside Nintendo in making Brawl a more ""casual"" experience, in the hopes that one day he will be able to redeem his legacy.  6 years later after Brawl was released, Nintendo has seen the cataclysmic effects that the game had on their entire player base. Melee players stuck with Melee after seeing and feeling how slow Brawl played comparatively, and Brawl players enjoyed their game because it was different from Melee. The fanbase, as a whole, was split in two. Nintendo could not ignore the massive popularity of Melee at EVO 2013, and this was the point that Nintendo began to realize that in order to thrive as a business, they needed to start to embracing their ""competitive"" demographic. Sakurai saw this as his chance to redeem his Smash game legacy; to put the game series back on the track that he had originally envisioned for it. Sakurai knew however that Nintendo would not approve of a literal Melee 2.0 sequel; he had to make those changes slowly lest Nintendo would stop his intended direction. And from this collaboration, understanding, and vision, Smash 4 was born.  Why is Smash 4 seen as more ""competitively viable"" than Brawl? Because Sakurai designed it that way; its the first step in redeeming the game series. Why is Melee still being played? Because Sakurai has a competitive vision for the Smash game series, and it is the highest level of his competitive vision that actually came to fruition. Even though Sakurai cannot publicly state it, we are on our way to eventually having a true Nintendo branded Melee 2.0 Smash Brothers game."

smashcirclejerk,3b8dt8,peppermint1201,3,Fri Jun 26 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"embodiment of sex and masculine form   Douglas Falcon is a hero of the future and thrill seeking extraordinaire. Most prominently chronicled in the video games F-Zero and Smash Bros. However his true story is never really touched on. Please read below for an in depth analysis of the savior of the 24th century.   Physical Attributes: Captain Falcon is known for having the PERFECT male physique. His muscle toned body was crafted from a life of athletics and crime fighting. Captain Falcon is frequently sighted wearing SKIN TIGHT SPANDEX. Although it may seem he is a show off, he does this to maximize the aerodynamics around his body. Captain Falcon is always concerned with maximum performance and efficiency, thus he designed his suits to maximize movement and aerodynamics. He also wears the suit to showcase HIS MASSIVE GENITALS. Captain Falcon is a favorite among the ladies, they are all smitten when Captain Falcon is around. It is in fact very common to see CF nipping, (his nipples are as hard as diamonds), this is due to his consistent sexual escapades that keep him fulfilled with a constant flow of adrenaline and endorphins. Captain Falcon is also known for playing fair, he does not use stimulants, steroids, or drugs to enhance his body. His rock hard abs are the result of a 100% natural regiment and diet. His speed is unmatched and his strength rivals that of demi gods.   Origins / Athletics / Family: It is often debated and assumed that Douglas Falcon is descended from the ancient Spartans. Born to an impoverished family, Douglas had very little advantages as a child. His father was a drunkard and his mother was a whore. One night Falcon's parents overdosed on Hydroxycut and Douglas was forced into an orphanage. The orphanage was able to put Douglas into little league sports. Falcon always had a natural talent for athletics and speed. At a young age he outmatched all the other children in his little league sports. Just about every team sport he was involved in became an unfair competition. Little league children everywhere quit playing simply because Douglas Falcon was clearly competing at a Pro level which elevating his team to landslide victories. The Little League Association of America decided to remove him from the sports as he was toppling the balance of the sporting events. Falcon learned injustice at a young age, when CORRUPT LITTLE LEAGUE OFFICIALS booted him for the sake of lost profits. Douglas was not a quitter though, he would not let a minor setback slow him down. Football Career: Falcon tried out for the NFL at the young age of 11, at the time, the pro players laughed at him and taunted him. During tryouts, Falcon easily placed 1st in all training activities. His speed was unmatched, his strength could not be contended. NFL scouts had no choice but to draft him and Douglas acquired fame at a young age for dominating the NFL until he was 21. His team won 10 Superbowls in a row with flawless victories. The Philadelphia Eagles could not be scored on during that decade and in fact other teams would often forfeit when scheduled to play against Falcon's team. Once Douglas had 2 fists full of Super Bowl rings, he turned his attention to JUSTICE and ended his perfect football career. He would forever be known as the best football player ever to exist. The Philadelphia Eagles, in honor of Douglas, changed their team name to the Philadelphia Falcons. Police Force: Douglas Falcon always had a yearning for JUSTICE. He enlisted in the Police force at the ripe age of 21 to clean up the crime and scum on the streets. His record was flawless and he quickly rose to the rank of Captain. Captain Falcon cleaned up the streets that were part of his jurisdiction. But it wasn't enough, Captain Falcon wanted more. He wanted to clean up the world and then the universe of scum. He requested transfers frequently to clean up the streets in different jurisdictions, but ultimately found this limiting as he could not freely operate amongst them all at one time. Often criminals would get off the hook due to corrupt litigation and bureaucratic BULLSHIT. It also became extremely apparent to him, that the police force was mostly populated with corrupt pig cops who did not care about justice, and only cared about writing traffic citations and letting SCUM escape the law.   Building the Blue Falcon: On the year 2348 CF (Captain Falcon) resigned from the police force to take the law into his own hands. CF had aspirations to become an intergalactic bounty hunter who brought criminals to justice. However being a bounty hunter would require a vehicle capable of interstellar travel, to cross the stars hunting villainous scum. Captain Falcon took it upon himself to build the ultimate racing craft, The Blue Falcon. With his EXTREME ingenuity he designed the blue prints for the craft with the BEST parts the universe had to offer. CF spared no expense to build this craft and went to pain staking ordeals just to acquire parts. Legend has it that he swam across the ocean blue to Japan to pick up his custom ordered JDM engine. He then strapped the engine on his back and swam it back across to America to begin construction of his vehicle. Many were jealous of his ingenuity, specifically the McCloud family who were in the space craft construction industry. Falcon had created a car sized engine that could outclass the mothership sized engine in the McCloud's flag ship. The McClouds were largely ridiculed and shunned after this for being exposed for using sub-par parts and became the joke of the industry. This ultimately caused James McCloud to embark on a suicide mission to attack an intergalactic monkey known as Andross. James died a coward and abandoned his only son, Fox McCloud. This would ultimately effect Fox's development growing up, as he grew up without a father figure. Fox ended up becoming a raging self-entitled prick due to lack of a male role model and forever garnered hatred for Captain Falcon. Although secretly, Fox lusted for Douglas' perfect body. F-Zero Racing Circuit: Once the Blue Falcon was completed, CF wanted to put the vehicle to the test. Falcon entered into the F-Zero circuit for high stakes prize money. As usual, Falcon SMOKED the competition, completing the race in record time. Falcon had a large heart and donated 90% of the winnings to charities for children. The remaining 10% was kept to maintain the expenses of his vehicle and gas prices. Falcon regularly enters into F-Zero races for the following 3 reasons: To maintain upkeep on his vehicle. To continue donations to various charities for children For the SEXUAL THRILL  Role Model to Children / Sex Machine to the Ladies: On weekends it is said that he will wear hot pink and white spandex, and drive around impoverished neighborhoods distributing Good-Humor ice-cream products to malnourished children. This is where he gained the nick name ""The Good Humor Man"". When interviewed about his choice in colors, Falcon clearly stated ""I am so secure in my masculinity, that I redefine the color pink."" This statement was backed up by his strenuous sexual escapades. Falcon often had flocks of women frequenting his bed room. In fact he installed a hidden compartment in the Blue Falcon, so that up to 3 women could stow aboard and pleasure him while he raced. This was of course to enhance the SEXUAL THRILL of the race and he kept the ladies in hidden compartments so that children would never catch a glimpse of their role model having sexual escapades. This was also a secret handicap that Falcon imposed upon himself. With the added weight of 3 broads in his vehicle, this provided a slight advantage to his rivals on the racing circuit. Bounty Hunter: At this point Captain Falcon had the resources and time to hunt down villainous scum. He traveled the stars in The Blue Falcon bringing the most vile criminals to justice. Whenever he was presented with cash rewards, he humbly turned down the offer and had it donated to charities for children. In comparison, Fox McCloud also started a career around this time trying to hunt down the monkey that killed his father. Fox however did his hunting ONLY for the rewards and the selfishness of avenging his dead beat father. During Fox's quest for vengeance he nearly committed genocide on all apes in the Lylat system. Fox even had the audacity to send a hefty bill to General Pepper of the Lylat system for the ""criminals"" he brought down. Clearly Falcon was the better man. It was around this time that Falcon crossed paths with Samus Aran, another renown bounty hunter. They were hunting the same bounty and decided to work together. One night, when they were huddled around their camp fire, Samus was extremely aroused by Falcon's cunning prowess. Samus seduced Falcon and they boned on the planet Zebes. Falcon nailed her so good, that she decided to quit Bounty hunting and become a flag girl for the F-Zero circuit to be closer to him. EDIT: The Atlanta Falcons went bankrupt in 2260 and the franchise was disbanded."

smashcirclejerk,3b37e7,Mmeaninglessnamee,5,Fri Jun 26 01:05:40 2015 UTC,"/uj  This is a bit vague, so i have a few questions i would like answered.   What kind of stuff is going to result in a ban (what does/does not qualify)? Does this apply to comments too? Is this even necessary, shouldn't banning on /r/smashbros be enough? How many weeks will people be banned for? Will the sentences vary? How will you dictate whether behaviour is 'circlejerky' or not? Does this ban get placed on anybody who circlejerks on /r/smashbros or just people who frequent this sub? Is there anything we can do to be unbanned (e.g writing a 500 word essay)? Doesn't 'a few weeks seem a little harsh?   I really don' t see the point in this, you're punishing circlejerk behaviour by preventing them from being able to circlejerk. If it is a problem this doesn't seem like the best way to fix it.   Edit: thx fr the replys mods"
smashcirclejerk,3b37e7,FunctionFn,7,Thu Jun 25 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"I'd ask the /r/smashbros mods what will cause a ban. What will happen is, if you're banned over there, you're banned over here. And it's only one week, not a few. This ban will get placed on anybody who is banned for circlejerking on the main sub.  The reason we're banning people here is that when people get banned for it on /r/smashbros, according to the mods over there they don't take it very seriously. So by banning people here too, we're trying to make it sting a little more, trying to get people to follow that rule."

smashcirclejerk,3b37e7,1338h4x,10,Thu Jun 25 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"/uj  /r/smashbros mod here, and the one who's been talking to abraman and the rest of the scj mods.   What kind of stuff is going to result in a ban (what does/does not qualify)?   In /r/smashbros, repeatedly starting threads based on /r/scj memes, linking threads to /r/smashbros from here (brigading), generally circlejerking in a manner that belongs over here in this sub, not in the main sub.   Does this apply to comments too?   Yes.   Is this even necessary, shouldn't banning on /r/smashbros be enough?   The whole point of this is to allow both of our mod teams to better enforce our rules. When cjers break rule 4 and start being dumb in our sub, it breaks your rules, and (possibly, the admins are never really clear on what brigading entails) Reddit's rules as a whole.   Does this ban get placed on anybody who circlejerks on /r/smashbros or just people who frequent this sub?   You guys have a pretty particular brand of circlejerkery, so it's pretty easy to tell when it's a smashcirclejerk vs regular circlejerking on /r/smashbros. That being said, if they don't visit this sub, then it doesn't really matter if they get banned from here or not, because it doesn't affect them.  Also, echoing everything that abraman has said, he's on the money regarding the rest of your concerns."
smashcirclejerk,3b37e7,FernoUn,2,Thu Jun 25 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"/uj regarding brigading, isn't the point of using np.reddit links to prevent interaction? Are people really bothering to go to the post without np. to be obnoxious?  Also, is talking about /r/scj in Whose Line Wednesday still okay? That seems to happen every week."
smashcirclejerk,3b37e7,XXXCheckmate,5,Thu Jun 25 23:56:35 2015 UTC,"np links aren't supported by the site. RES goes out of its way to make it so that users don't vote on them, but there's nothing stopping someone from voting anyways if they don't have RES installed (or just turn off that setting on RES, or just remove the np part of the link). NP links work off of good faith, and serve as a useful reminder for people not to participate, but they seldom work as intended.  As for WLW, Whose Line Wednesday is a joke/meme thread, so we let it slide there as long as it doesn't start leaking to other threads."
smashcirclejerk,3b37e7,XXXCheckmate,3,Fri Jun 26 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"I think Whose Line is fine.  But yeah, some people ignore np completely.  Hell, np itself isn't even very good at stopping that stuff as it's so easy to circumvent."

At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.  I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).  I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.  Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.  I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.  I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.  I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.  I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.  I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.  I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.  The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.  I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.  That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).  I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).  And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.  All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

smashcirclejerk,3b0vzd,GammaRidley,10,Thu Jun 25 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"youre right and to prove it I'm going to make a more calm and objective stance (since I'm bad at expressing myself socially, I'm just making a new big post on this so you can all see my point of view) with a post here.  How Fox should and should not be changed for PM 3.6: HOW SHOULD FOX BE CHANGED (if you INSIST he needs a nerf again): 1) Laser damage nerf (HEAVILY RECOMMENDED AS THE MAIN THING TO CHANGE) - MAKE THIS LOWER, for example, 25% weaker is an example (Or whatever you think is about fair) PROS: Encourages more aggressive play (a good thing), without changing how the character plays at all except for that CONS: nothing bad This should be BY FAR the PRIMARY FOCUS of a PM 3.6 Fox change. And this is coming from a LASER-HEAVY Fox admitting this (when I really want to win anyway). ^ This is hands down the best way to make ""Balance"" but without ruining a character completely or changing how he plays. It simply means the Fox needs more work to get the same result, without changing the way the Fox plays. 2) Slight up smash nerf PROS: Balances Fox without changing how he plays really CONS: people who memorized PAL kills %s will have a slightly harder time killing, including tiny things like captain falcon needing to be shot with a laser or 2 in order to be knocked down from 0 from up smash. This is also an acceptable way to change a character, without changing how the character plays. However I think this is nowhere near as strong as changing something as harmless as lasers 3) Tiny Weight change PROS: Keeps the character the same, but you can kill him earlier now (less fighting needed in order to take down the Fox) CONS: nothing important; need to relearn the %s to do chain grabs, which is not a big deal in a game like this where that stuff changes every version These are 3 ideas for an example of how to change Fox which won't make Melee players not want to play the game/character anymore, because you are simply NERFING HIM, not CHANGING HOW HE PLAYS COMPLETELY. (Melee Fox players do not want to learn a different type of specific PM Fox, trust me, they play PM fox because they know their skillsets will transfer over, and you should keep it that way). 4) Up B to match PAL This would have been FAR BETTER Than making INSANE LANDING LAG that is unheard of in PAL or NTSC. HOW FOX SHOULD - NOT - Be Changed 1) Making up B landing lag become 20 frames (instead of 6), and Making Illusion landing lag become 7 frames (instead of 3). WHY THIS IS BAD: A huge purpose of picking up Project M Fox is that there's a 95% chance that you ALREADY PLAY MELEE FOX and want to transition into a new, more balanced version of the same game, with more fair and new matchup spreads but still be able to TRANSFER YOUR SKILLS WITH USEFUL PRACTICE TO EACH. ***** YOU CAN PRACTICE PM FOX TO GET GOOD WITH MELEE FOX, AND PRACTICE MELEE FOX TO GET GOOD WITH PM FOX, BECAUSE THE FRAME DATA IS THE SAME - ONLY THE DAMAGE AND SCALING ARE REALLY DIFFERENT AND ONLY ON CERTAIN MOVES (I Do this myself and I can personally attest to this being 100% true) ***** ^ This is HUGE and a VERY LARGE part of our melee community is going to be DISCOURAGED (Esp all the Fox players which is like 30% of our community or something I bet) from picking up or continuing in Project M if you make such radical changes like this. ***** UNLESS YOUR GOAL IS TO MAKE FOX PLAYERS NOT WANT TO PLAY THE GAME (or if you are just super biased against fox in the first place, and honestly I think many of you are although you aren't going to want to hear me say that even though I do believe that is the real truth behind this based off of my logic), THEN DO NOT MAKE THIS TYPE OF CHANGE. ***** You can systematically now do the ""edge hog tactic"" i invented to edge guard fox continuously. When you do a normal ledge stand in Melee (probably very similar with any character in melee or PM to be honest), you generally have frames 1-30 being invincible and 32-35 total frames of the ledge stand. That entire time counts as edge hogging. IN MARTH VS FOX, YOU CAN LEDGE STAND THROUGH FOX'S UP B IN A HORIZONTAL LINE ON STAGE, aND STILL REGRAB HIM BEFORE HE CAN SHINE (Fox's up B passes through the invincible Marth and then Marth does a dash grab before fox can shine since fox first has to land on stage and then has to suffer 6 frames landing lag. Having 20 would make this WAY Too easy. This works easily vs illusions In Melee too by the way). Even if you didn't want to do that, you could always do aerials/attacks that cover low options (such as the options where Fox will aim to the ledge you cover with an attack so that he is forced to die by going low and only survive... for the time being... if he goes above you). Method 2: ALWAYS COVER the low options, because the high options are no longer relevent. In order to bypass the landing lag, it becomes way more important for fox to try to aim to the ledge with up B and side B, so all you have to do now is focus on that. With greatly increased landing lag, such as fox landing on platforms above you, you no longer have to worry about covering high or on stage at all - Just cover low since that's the only good option anymore. Examples of covering low are doing Marth F smash or sword pokes, or a ledge hop bair, or a ledge stand/ledge roll, which all cover the ""low options"". If Fox goes higher, above you, to a platform, or straight on stage, instead of having 3 frames landing lag, he will have 7-20 frames landing lag, which is FAR MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EASILY COVER NOW. I Don't think you guys truly understand how significant and systematic you can endlessly edge guard fox by only focusing around covering the ledge options now (only cover low options). I'm sometimes able to cover everything in Melee by Fox having only 3-6 frames of landing lag and being borderline with him being able to shield my next attack or not, after I miss covering low options, and I'm trying to punish his landing lag. Being increased at all, let alone by many frames, will be an INSANE nerf to the way you can option select his recovery. 2) SHINE-CHANGE - Reflector scaling by damage; which will change both combos, and not allowing low % shinespikes anymore This is very bad because no Melee Fox player wants to relearn a specific PM Fox (especially in the current state of PM where twitch/nintendo aren't even supporting the game you do NOT Want to FURTHER discourage Melee Fox's from picking up the game at all, you might as well just delete the character from the memory and adding a new Peppy Hare in replace of Fox at this point if you're going to do that). I don't know if I even need to elaborate on how bad changing the way Shine functions as a move is. If I need to please let me know, but any Fox player knows that having the fixed knockback is what makes the move so good. This is WHAT MAKES FOX FOX. Try to understand why you should not be discouraging Melee Fox players (any PM Fox player is almost DEFINITELY using Fox because they play Fox in MElee already - keep that in mind, and that's a LOT of our community and our future potential community as well) by making insanely radical changes just because ""more than 50% of us don't like fox so we want to discourage his use however possible"" which is sadly how I Think it really works, but try to reconsider why this could be VERY BAD for the game, and how you can easily accomplish balance in the ways I suggested above, without discouraging use of the character from people who currently use the character or future melee fox players that want to pick up the game. Keep in mind that if you play Fox in PM, this almost SURELY means that it's BECAUSE you played Fox in Melee. They want the same Fox, but maybe more work OF THE SAME KIND would STILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO THEM There are plenty of ways to nerf fox and make their lives harder (laser damage being a great example among other ideas) without making those melee players NOT WANT TO PICK UP THE GAME BECAUSE OF HOW RADICALLY DIFFERENT IT IS. (This will mess up their Melee game which NONE OF THEM WANT TO HAPPEN). If Fox's are forced to realize ""WOW PM FOX IS SO MUCH LAGGIER/DIFFERENT (IN BAD WAYS THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO GET USED TO), THIS WILL REALLY HURT MY MELEE GAME IF I PLAY THIS!!"" you know what that means? They will STOP PLAYING PM. ^ I am trying to make you all realize that and prevent this They're literally just going to realize ""wow, with nationals dropping PM, twitch/nintendo not supporting it, and PM fox hurting my melee fox because of these recovery lag and radical shine changes, I really should also not be supporting or playing this game either! I'll only play and support Melee from now on!"" and I am trying TO PREVENT THAT. Btw I'm about to stream and get to work now/soon, so I can't really respond much anymore, I just wanted to leave my opinions out there (this also means that I cannot really reply to comments anymore most likely; I replied to some of them during this free time I had though)."

smashcirclejerk,3b0gy4,1338h4x,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:58:34 2015 UTC,"It's pretty self explanatory- just a list of characters that I think are under utilized in the current meta game. Keep in mind this is not a tier list.  1- Sheik. I feel like nobody ever uses her true potential. Most people that play with Sheik either camp with needles or use the dumb easy combos, and professional players just overlook the character as something cheap and unviable. Sheik actually has a lot of depth. Not only does she have the combos, but she can do amazing spacing with her needles(if you don't spam them) and fast aerials. She's also very fast, allowing her to punish a lot of stuff that couldn't be punished by top tier characters like Dr. Mario or Charizard(Charizard got heavily buffed in 1.0.8., and that made him really good. A lot of professional smash players are now switching to Charizard). And her edgeguarding, while a bit lacking due to the knockback on her aerials, can get you a good stock at higher percentages.  2- Diddy Kong. Diddy Kong got nerfed last patch, yes, but those changes only affect the Hoo-Hah. Literally everything else about him is great: From the bananas, great recovery and side B to great combos outside of grabs. I feel like with the newest patch people are starting to drop Diddy Kong, while in reality he might just be as strong as he ever was. Which is a shame.  3- Rosalina and Luma. Just like with Sheik, a lot of people are using this character wrong and that makes the character look bad. What all people do with her is just use the Luma as a 2x to damage/knockback. That's not how you use Luma! Luma is more of a spacing and edgeguarding tool rather than a ""not on crack"" version of Palutena's Lightweight. The combos and back to forth juggles you can do with Luma are possible, as proven by Rosalina's trailer. Not only that, but Luma can be used in hard reads and mind games, which becomes even better with customs and Warp Luma.  4- Sonic. Now, Sonic is a character that's actually being used pretty well in competitive play and For Glory. I like the way people use his speed and combo to his full potential.   cough   I'm only putting him here because of tournament results(remember, this is not a tier list). It's sad we haven't seen any big results from Sonic. But I can hope he'll get them! Here's to Sonic winning EVO!  5- Ness. Ness is such a good character. His zoning is excellent with PK Thunder, his PK Fire is well, PK Fire, and his combos are pretty good even without down throw like Diddy Kong. I would main the fuck out of him, but I sadly just don't like Earthbound. And I really despise Mother 3. So, I'm only planning to playing him just to get better at playing against him. The reason I put him as underrated is because For Glory doesn't have many Ness players, if there are any Ness players at all, and even less people use him at tourneys. He's definitely an underrated gem that we just need to discover.  6- Yoshi. Another character that is completely underplayed on For Glory. Yoshi has amazing recovery(remember, he has super armor on his second jump), good zoning neutral game with his eggs and egg bounce, and most importantly, he has 0 lag on every single move, which is a nice bonus. Yoshi might even be better than Pac-Man, and he has a good matchup against said Pac-Man, because 1 egg means a fire hydrant is completely destroyed, which will automatically lock onto Pac-Man and kill him at about 60%.  So those are my thoughts on the characters that are wrongfully underused in the current Super Smash Brothers for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U metagame. I hope this post will make people play more with these characters and advance the meta.  And remember, those are my thoughts and opinions. Don't just downvote or remove this post because you think that I'm objectively wrong and that's final. Just try to read my post once again and see that I'm right. I might be wrong on some minor details, so feel free to point that out! I'm looking forward to your feedback!  Thanks for reading!  Also keep in mind that this is not a tier list."

This is what went down: Him:I lost because Melee is a gimmick.  Me:MELEE IS NOT A GIMMICK!  Him:till a gimmick. What with the wavecheating and fun-cancelling and glitch ridden gameplay with ridiculous hypersensitivity and only about 10 of the characters are played seriously. Add that to the fact that when the game is mastered, people can get 0-to-deaths off one grab, and that is a problem because there are only a relatively few number of characters that can do that. What's more, is that the whole metagame will be upset when a player wins a major tournament through Kirbycide. Then, another player does. More and more players use Kirby until everyone uses Kirby and has long forgotten why Kirby was the worst character in the game in the first place. Both players will hang from ledges and yell at each other in real life, in order to get their opponet to hit them and get disqualified, or to have them wander over to try in vain to attack, only to be Kirbycided. The few Fox and Shiek and Marth players will lose in vain to Kirbycides, and Melee will be exposed as the gimmick it always was: where the worst character in the game can ruin the metagame by being campy and boring.   But then, along comes Hungrybox, resting Kirbys left and right and dominating the air with his 5001 jumps. Melee is saved! (Actually not, because everyone now only uses Jigglypuff. Puff dittos are boring to watch and whoever gets the second rest always wins.) Melee is divided into two communities, Puff and Kirby, and each community is as boring and disrespectful as the other. The end of the world is nigh, and a five year old child beats M2K via Kirbycide. The Smash gods run away and live as Hermits for the rest of their days.  You see, you can NOT let the secret of Kirby's power be revealed. Otherwise, the prediction I have foretold will come true.  Of course, Kirbycide problems aren't as prevalent in Smash 4 because the characters' general recoveries are improved, and the ledge mechanics prevent abusable invincibility. ヽ( ͡°╭͜ʖ╮͡° )ﾉ ヽ( ͡°╭͜ʖ╮͡° )ﾉ  You just got pwned  Me:Nah Kirbycide doesn't work because in melee you can escape earlier AND Kirby dies first in the occasion that he does succeed.

smashcirclejerk,3auhkj,honestly-tbh,7,Tue Jun 23 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"I can't enjoy myself playing this game anymore. I try so hard to get back into it with each patch that gets put in, but it seems to only get worse every time I play. I don't understand why there are so many one-track minded playstyles that actually work in this game. Luigi's whole successful moveset revolves around that down-throw. Sure, you can do a whole lot of other things with him, but why would you if you're trying to win? No matter how repetitive it is, Luigi will try to land a downthrow. Kirby will use his dair more than any other aerial, since it combos into like 95% of his moveset. Ness will try to grab you once you're above 100% (in fact, I've fought Nesses who just roll and grab over and over again once you're at that point). At the beginning of Smash's onset, Marios everywhere would downthrow to utilt. Sheik will try to trap you in her tilts, will spam needles off-stage, etc. Sonic will abuse his rolls to no end. This all sounds like a nightmare, but why would the player do anything different? There is no good reason not to, unless you're trying to be flashy. I think that these repetitive playstyles make online play absolutely dreadful, and I'm already seeing it with the new characters as well. Lucas will try to space out with PK Fire and zairs to rack up damage, and he has a lot of set strings that everyone seems to know about now. Roy can just shield anything and do his jab right out of it for free percents, and abuse a lot of his different attacks because of the lack of lag. I haven't seen much repetitive play with Ryu, but I know that his moveset is mostly going to revolve around trapping (tilts or Focus Attack or whatever) and then doing Shoryuken. The problem for me is not necessarily that I don't know how to combat these strategies, but rather I get so sad when I get caught off-guard by one of these strategies, or I make one small mistake and it spells my end. When I face off against 30 different people online in one sitting and literally all of them use a flowchart sort of playstyle, it gets depressing. I eventually just have my character stand there, and I lay back and watch him get beat off of the stage. I'm so tired of watching a Fox run towards me and then roll back to the initial position repeatedly, waiting for me to attack. I'm tired of Ganondorfs standing in one place and doing upsmash to forward tilt to downtilt in an inhuman speed, waiting for me to approach their barrage of random attacks. I'm tired of projectile spam. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm getting worse and worse in these matches because I get bored or complacent fighting these types of people. I can't go back to the other Smash Bros. games because I've been playing this one since inception and I love all the characters and the enhanced Brawl-like engine that it has. I'm absolutely spoiled by being able to play online against whoever I can, but I tend to absolutely hate everyone that I play online. I know Anther's Ladder is a thing, but I don't have time during the day to do all of that, as I only get small periods of time to play. I find myself leaving people after one match repeatedly, win or lose, because I despise their playstyle. My friends can't be around often enough for us to make the game worthwhile, so I can't do local matches in-house. All of the single player modes sort of blow. I have been a Smash player for years and years and years and its my favorite multiplayer video game franchise, but I almost feel like I'm about to retire and quit it completely. Online play is just depressing at this point. EDIT: I must say that I'm not saying these strategies are indicative of high-level play, nor are they something that constantly gives me trouble; they're just extremely repetitive and boring, and in turn, saddening."

smashcirclejerk,3aujpx,klk155,6,Tue Jun 23 16:57:12 2015 UTC,"Banjo-Tooie is a platform video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was first released on 19 November 2000 in North America and on 12 April 2001 in Europe, and later re-released as an Xbox Live Arcade game for the Xbox 360 on 29 April 2009. It is the second instalment in the Banjo-Kazooie series and serves as a sequel to the original Banjo-Kazooie. The story of the game follows series protagonists Banjo and Kazooie as they attempt to stop the plans of antagonist Gruntilda and her two sisters from vapourising the inhabitants of the game's world.  Development of the game started in June 1998, directly after the release of its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Banjo-Tooie features levels that are significantly larger than those of its predecessor and requires the player to complete various challenges such as solving puzzles, collecting items, and defeating bosses. It also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames. Upon release, the game sold more than three million copies and received critical acclaim from video game critics.  Similar to its predecessor Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie features three-dimensional worlds containing items to be collected. Among the items are golden jigsaw pieces, called Jiggies, that are used to complete jigsaw puzzles that unlock the levels. Instead of exploring the hub world in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in Banjo-Kazooie, a singular board is used within a temple where Master Jiggywiggy resides. Whenever the player has obtained the number of Jiggies required, a timed puzzle-completion challenge can be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to each world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies than the last.[1]  Musical notes return in Banjo-Tooie, but are used to learn new moves from the drill sergeant Jamjars. He is the brother of Bottles and takes over Bottles' role from the first game. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.  Another feature introduced in Banjo-Tooie is the direct connections between its worlds. In Banjo-Kazooie the titular duo would be transported to each level via special doors in Gruntilda's lair, but in Banjo-Tooie the levels are physically connected at multiple points and are effectively extensions of the Isle o' Hags hub world.[1] In addition, the train Chuffy can be used to migrate minor characters between worlds which contain stations. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can play each of the game's single-player minigames in customizable competitions.  The game takes place two years after the events of Banjo-Kazooie. Following the first defeat of Gruntilda by Banjo and Kazooie, the two are playing poker with their friends Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles in Banjo's house. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda arrive in a large digging machine, the Hag 1. They destroy the boulder and free Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately Gruntilda's time spent underground rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo exit the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it is all a joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends decide to put an end to Gruntilda's plans, and swear to track her down.  Following the witches' trail, Banjo and Kazooie arrive at Jinjo Village on the Isle o' Hags, where King Jingaling, king of all the Jinjos, explains that his subjects were frightened away by the Hag 1 and scattered throughout the island. He gives the two their first Jiggy as a token of gratitude to help find them. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters introduce her to a cannon called the ""Big-O-Blaster"" (B.O.B.) that will restore her body by sucking the life force from any given target. They test B.O.B. on King Jingaling, who consequently is turned into a zombie. Gruntilda plans to charge B.O.B. long enough to blast the entire island. The witch's most loyal minion, Klungo is sent out to hinder Banjo and Kazooie in their progress by fighting them, but after taking many beatings from Gruntilda as punishment for losing to them, Klungo eventually abandons her and sides with Banjo and Kazooie.  Finally reaching Gruntilda's fortress at Cauldron Keep, Banjo and Kazooie confront the witch and her sisters in a trivia quiz show named the Tower of Tragedy Quiz in which losing competitors will be flattened under one-tonne weights. Mingella and Blobbelda lose to Banjo, getting crushed, but Gruntilda escapes. Banjo and Kazooie then reverse the effects of B.O.B., resurrecting both King Jingaling and Bottles, who celebrate at Bottles' house along with Klungo. Banjo and Kazooie enter the top of the fortress and defeat Gruntilda, destroying most of her body and the Hag 1 along with her. The two return to Bottles' house with their remaining friends (Jamjars, Mumbo, and Wumba) to find that everyone else has celebrated without them, much to their disappointment. They instead head to Cauldron Keep and play football with Gruntilda's head, who vows to have her revenge.  Banjo-Tooie was developed by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie. Development of the game started in June 1998. Originally, Rare planned to include an additional mode, called Bottles' Revenge, where a second player could play as an undead version of Bottles and take control of enemy characters to hinder Banjo in his quest. The idea was ultimately scrapped because the developers ran out of time to debug it, despite admitting that ""it did work rather well"". Bosses were originally to be able to be controllable by the second player, but the only boss that the developers had working when they dropped the mode was the third boss, 'Old King Coal'."
smashcirclejerk,3aujpx,ActionGamemaster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:38:50 2015 UTC,yes but the constant back tracking sucked dick
smashcirclejerk,3aujpx,ActionGamemaster,6,Tue Jun 23 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"The developers also planned to implement a feature, called ""Stop 'N' Swop"", that would have allowed data to be transferred from Banjo-Kazooie to Banjo-Tooie so that players could unlock additional bonuses in Banjo-Tooie. However, due to hardware limitations of the Nintendo 64 system, the feature was ultimately dropped. It is, however, included in the Xbox Live re-release. Despite this, Rare decided to include at least some of the additional bonuses within the game.[6] The music was composed by Grant Kirkhope, who previously worked as the main composer for Perfect Dark, Donkey Kong 64, and Banjo-Kazooie. As Banjo-Tooie was a larger game than its predecessor, Kirkhope had twice the memory space in the game's cartridge for sound effects and music.[7] Kirkhope initially had to pause his work on Banjo-Tooie to work on other projects first, but ultimately the music score for the game was completed on time.[7] Like the original, the themes heard in the game were designed to be interactive, which dynamically change to reflect the player's location. For example, due to the game having larger memory space Kirkhope was able to combine two midi files to channel different fades of music when the player moves to different locations.[7] The developers initially aimed for a fourth quarter 1999 release, but the game was ultimately delayed.[8] Banjo-Tooie was presented at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo and released on 20 November 2000.[9][10] The game supports the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak.[11]  Banjo-Tooie was critically acclaimed upon release and was among a chain of successful video games released by Rare for the Nintendo 64. The game sold more than three million copies and review scores were consistently very high, rivalling those of its predecessor.[13][19] Johnny Liu of Game Revolution considered Banjo-Tooie to be a worthy successor to Banjo-Kazooie and highlighted the scale of its worlds.[17] Also commenting on the scale, GamePro remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they are supposed to do.[16] Similarly, Jes Bickham of GamesRadar described Banjo-Tooie as a game that requires a massive time-investment on the player's part, saying that ""Keeping track of what you can do next, or where you can re-visit to get something new, requires either a photographic memory or copious note-taking"".[20] Nintendo Power referred to the game as ""the perfect cross between Donkey Kong 64 and Banjo-Kazooie"", noting that it features less backtracking between levels that ""[Donkey Kong 64] over-ambitiously played to the hilt"".[18] The publication also stated that ""If there's one disappointment, it's the halfhearted resolve of the Ice Key mystery introduced two years ago in Banjo-Kazooie.""[18]  Shane Satterfield, writing for GameSpot, praised the game's level design and progression, stating that the constant collecting of Jiggies ""keeps the controller glued to your hand and your eyes in a fixed gaze"".[2] The graphics of the game were declared to be some of the best on the Nintendo 64 due to their rich textures, long drawing distance, and real-time shadow generation, but were also criticised for their inconsistent frame rate during certain points in the game.[1][2][17] Despite this, Satterfield noted that the action level of the game was normally low enough that it ""does not significantly distract from the experience"".[2] Liu of Game Revolution said that the graphics were ""beautiful"", but admitted that the game did not meet the same level of awe as its predecessor.[17] The game earned the GameSpot's Best Platform Game accolade for 2000.[21]  An Xbox Live Arcade version of Banjo-Tooie, developed by 4J Studios, was released for the Xbox 360 on 29 April 2009. This version features a smoother frame rate and high-definition graphics, and supports the ""Stop 'N' Swop"" connectivity with the Xbox Live Arcade version of its predecessor, allowing players to unlock the bonuses included in the original Nintendo 64 version as well as new content related to the Xbox 360.[22] The Xbox Live Arcade version of Banjo-Tooie received mixed to favourable reviews from video game critics, featuring an aggregate score of 73 out of 100 at Metacritic.[23]"
