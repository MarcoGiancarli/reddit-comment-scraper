JUSTNOMIL,3dzufx,mollymae83,3,Mon Jul 20 22:17:48 2015 UTC,I thought gifts weren't expected at when its a destination wedding? Or the guests have to travel to attend... I may be wrong but I couldn't imagine expecting a gift from someone who traveled to watch me get married
JUSTNOMIL,3dzufx,mollymae83,4,Tue Jul 21 00:26:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on who you talk to, some say yes, some say a small one is appropriate. I think if it were a shower (where it's a gift-giving event) and you don't show up with something, that's a no-no.    ""9. If I’m traveling to a destination wedding , is it acceptable to give less as a gift? Generally, if you’re spending a good amount of money to get to the wedding, then it’s okay to gift less than you normally would. But make sure that you do give a gift. Although a destination wedding can be extra-expensive for guests, you should give something. The couple will understand you’ve spent a lot between the travel and hotel, so don’t feel pressure to give an overly generous gift.""  It wasn't a huge trip for them, they were coming from Texas to Tennessee...but flew none the less. Driving would have been cheaper and only 6 hour drive.  I didn't care they didn't get us anything (a lot of people didn't, even local ones) but was more annoyed at the constant ""OMGGGGGG it was $150 for us to get here, and we didn't get you anything because our present to you is us being here!"" BIL makes a large amount of money AND they tend to use flyer miles for cheap tickets...plus it's rude to say that to the people who are getting married. Don't come then, if it's such a hassle? BIL's wife flipped at me for the gift we gave them (was a $50 stemware pair off the registry) and said we were supposed to get something a little more substantial than that. Be grateful us broke ass college students got you anything?   We've driven/flown to weddings and still have gotten small gifts or gift cards."
JUSTNOMIL,3dzufx,yw1,10,Tue Jul 21 00:48:04 2015 UTC,"Hm that's interesting. I suck at these things.   But I agree, with the history it sounds like your frustration is justified! I hope they get easier, especially that awful aunt"
JUSTNOMIL,3dzufx,rofosho,6,Tue Jul 21 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"lol. Yeah, depends on who you talk to. I usually ask my grandma what she'd do. (She used to play hostess quite a bit and is still involved in a lot of parties and hosting, etc.)"
JUSTNOMIL,3dzufx,rofosho,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:47 2015 UTC,She complained about how much you spent on a gift?!  RUDE.  That is so so so rude.  The entitlement is strong with that one.
JUSTNOMIL,3dzufx,fruitjerky,9,Wed Jul 22 01:37:51 2015 UTC,"Yup. She's a bit of a brat. She was angry when the family car got passed down from BIL to DH when he was in college because (despite NOT being married at this point) she was ""entitled"" to getting MIL's car. Nevermind that MIL had purchased BIL a brand new car for graduation. (ROTC paid for college, MIL figured it was fair?) Then later on when DH and I were living together in college, she got pissed off that I was driving it more than DH was. I don't even.   She also expects to be reimbursed for food and other expenses when THEY invite us out to visit. Then pretty much the two of them expect us to help pay for their gas/food when they come out here.  (Now they're in another country, and it's been a couple of years now, but after that last time they were out here I lost my shit at DH for actually buying BIL's gas.)"

It's not as though I am telling cousin that is the reason why. If asked, I will say it's short notice and I need more than a month to ask for a week off work.

I'm sorry to play devils advocate but I feel it was necessary. You should speak to your husband on the issue because I'm certain he knows her far better than you ever could. It seems like he may have picked up some bad habits from her also, but that's another story. My suggestion to you is to run up to your MIL, lay all your cards on the table and speak plainly. It often disarms people if you told her ""Your sons baby is growing inside of me and it should be important to you and I don't feel that it is. I want, no, I need you to show interest in this issue by asking questions instead of issuing orders. Also, please talk to him about his delinquency concerning mac and cheese.""

She has some control issues or maybe she is just blatantly clueless as to how she comes across to other people. Either way her behavior is unacceptable and your feelings towards her are completely valid. The next time she tries to boss you around remember that ""No"" is a complete sentence and if you don't even want to entertain her foolishness then don't reply at all.

No repercussion to her for her poor actions, no change in her behavior.Sometimes he just says ""oh, she doesn't know couth, it's why she has no friends."", or ""you're just reading into her actions"". He insisted she apologize for the above, but then failed to understand that she is not sorry, that what she said is not a true apology.   THIS is what the majority of fights and problems in our relationship stem from. Really all fighting in our relationship goes back to her behavior and his reaction to her behavior towards me.

I kept saying, ""I would never go off registry, I don't understand why people do it."" And she just kind of humored the conversation. Maybe she thought she was exempt?  I'm due any day now and a few weeks ago she was like ""how can I help? What do you need?"" And I said ""there are a few things left on my registry we still need."" And she goes, ""oh that's not me.""

I will of course be grateful for any gift I'll get, but to be told to stop buying clothes for my kid (?) because no one will be able to purchase me anything for a shower is simply not true. There are PLENTY of things left to purchase. I'm not going to curtail my own purchases so she can do what she wants. Ya know? The ignoring of the response to the question is what I don't get. And I would personally hate for her to waste her money.  That said, I used to be very anti-registry, especially for the wedding (since most wedding/houseware stuff seems superfluous to me). I am usually one for gifts from the heart and such, but with the baby, I'm not ashamed to admit that we need more than we can probably afford. And I certainly don't expect people to foot the bill for my kid (it's NOT like a wedding where they'll be reaping benefits in the form of free food and an open bar), but it would be so nice to get things I'll actually use instead of 3 separate ""My First Christmas"" onesies."

JUSTNOMIL,3dpbhd,crys279,17,Sat Jul 18 03:48:26 2015 UTC,"You need to clear the air.   First you need to clue your hubs in about this. You're partners. You make decisions together. You have a right to be upset about this, just like you'd have a right to be upset if he made a huge decision that affected both of you without talking to you about it first. He also has a right to know what's eating you.  It doesn't need to be and shouldn't be a laundry list of sleights, just the basic ""this upset me.""  He needs to know, and you need to tell him.   The question you need to ask yourself is what will make this better? Who needs to do what in order to fix the situation? Is it her apologizing to you? Is it your husband canceling the vacation or switching his shifts back? What do you - honestly - need in order to move forward?  If it's an apology from your MIL, you need to be proactive and speak to her privately and tell her how much it upset you - as well as what you need from her to move forward. That is, if you want any shred of a relationship with her."
JUSTNOMIL,3dpbhd,l-x,6,Sat Jul 18 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"I have told him that this upset me, more than once, so I don't want to harp on it. He knows I'm still not over it, but I don't think he understands just how 'not over it' I am.    Him changing shifts is nearly impossible. There are four shifts (2 day/2 night), and six people per shift who do what he does, plus an additional extra group of workers with two people who do his job. The company structure recently changed, and the job he has was revamped, causing everyone who was already in that job, plus anyone who wanted that job, to have to apply and compete. All this happened within the last year. The only way he can transfer to a day shift would be for someone on the day shift his dad does not work on to either quit or ask to be transferred to nights, and for him to be the first in line to have requested to go to that shift.        As for an apology from her, it most likely won't happen. She got all bent out of shape when he told her to stop speaking to his boss about his schedule. He said he's going to speak to her about what she did, so I've been trying to see wait and see if that actually happens. If she apologizes to him, I'll be shocked. As for a relationship with her, I could go either way, honestly. Don't get me wrong, while I don't like her very much right now, I still love her.  I always thought I would have a great relationship with my mother-in-law when I got married, but we are so very, very different that we just don't seem to relate to each other at all. It doesn't help that she doesn't treat my daughter the same as her other granddaughter. I realize my husband is not my daughter's biological father, but he's been in her life since she was barely a year old, and has been daddy to her from day one. God help the person who landed in the shit-storm that would be stirred by daring to say to him that she's not his daughter. I get that the other grand daughter is her biological granddaughter, but they're both 15, and the other one lives in Canada. She calls the other one at least once a week. She only lives 40 minutes away from us, and can't be bothered to call my daughter unless it's her birthday or a holiday. Thanks to her meddling with my husband's schedule she only sees her every couple of months for a short visit. She never asks to spend time with her, plans special outings, etc. However, she constantly hounds the other one's mom to let her visit for a few weeks, come stay with her, etc. Let the one in Canada actuality come down though, and it's plan a special vacation, do anything and everything she wants the whole time, etc.       Sorry, I just went off on whole other rant there. :/"
JUSTNOMIL,3dpbhd,l-x,6,Sat Jul 18 05:21:16 2015 UTC,"your rant is valid, and it's important to vent. it's also important to figure out how to cope and resolve stuff, because it's not ok for you to be holding in all this anger and betrayal. something has to give.    I have told him that this upset me, more than once, so I don't want to harp on it. He knows I'm still not over it, but I don't think he understands just how 'not over it' I am.   this is why you need to clue him in - he needs to know how close to the surface this is and how you don't think you can bite your tongue the whole week. you can freely acknowledge that you want to be over it, but you aren't yet, and until you are, you're at risk of blowing up at her. make him your ally instead of taking him by surprise in a situation where he has to instantly choose between you and mom - especially when you aren't at your best.  you don't think you'll get an apology, but if that's what you need, that's pretty important. if she were to apologize for what happened, would you be able to let it go and (maybe) enjoy your vacation? if you ask her for an apology and she refuses, that's on her.  if not, what needs to occur? basically, figure out what you need, and talk through it with your husband so that he understands and can back you up. or, if he can shed some additional light on the situation that might help diffuse things, he needs to do that as well.   another tactic is for him to go to his mom and instead of shaming her for what she did (which, while satisfying, doesn't really fix anything), he can ask for her help. if she resists, he can bring out the big guns about how he's in this situation to begin with because of her meddling, and this is an opportunity for her to try and make it right.  at the very least, she might be able to bump him to the head of the queue to switch if someone on day shift requests different hours.   the bottom line is that you've been holding onto all this anger and betrayal, and it's working up into something really ugly when it's combined with your anxiety and resentment around this vacation. it's not fair that you have to be holding onto all of that by yourself. this is one of those situations where it has to be resolved, or you're going to do something you aren't proud of, and potentially alienate your relationship with your husband. neither of which are good outcomes.  there is one thing that's been bugging me in reading through all this - what did he to do try and change his hours back, and how did his hours just magically change without his knowledge or consent? is he actually as upset about this as you are? if not, the real issue is that he didn't discuss this with you and get your input. in that case, your MIL is just an accessory, not the root problem.  anyway, apologies for the unsolicited advice - i try to keep my trap shut most of the time. your post just read as like, ""OMFG WTF DO I DO HERE,"" so that's why i'm dropping my 2c. you know the situation and the relationships a lot better than i do - if you just need a good vent and you'll be OK, knock yourself out :)"
JUSTNOMIL,3dpbhd,pamplemousse2,5,Sat Jul 18 14:59:28 2015 UTC,"I really agree that the air needs to be cleared. Or even getting husband on side that work is a NO GO topic, and then saying something like ""Hi MIL and FIL! Wer're so excited to be on vacation. We need you to know, though, that the shift change has been really hard for us, so for this week, there will be no work talk. Thanks for understanding!"" and then husband needs to make sure to stick by that.  Good luck!!!"
JUSTNOMIL,3dpbhd,l-x,2,Sat Jul 18 17:14:27 2015 UTC,"His hours changed because he got promoted. When they offer you a promotion at his job, it's not congratulations, you now have the job off x, it's you are going to be the x on y shift. They give you no choice on what shift. Typically you would stay on your current shift unless there are no openings on your own shift, or you requested a transfer prior to being promoted and there is an opening on the shift you requested.     At that time, there were six slots on his then current shift, all available because with the change over, it was treated like a totally new position. He was the top candidate for the position (his boss's words- he had the job before half the interviews were even finished) and the day shift is a higher priority shift, but her request was treated as if he had requested a transfer. He could have refused the night shift, but that would mean turning down the promotion, which he had been pressured into putting in for by his boss. It would have caused a lot of problems for him at work to turn it down, so he was backed into a corner.  He has put in a request to go back to days, but there are no slots available, and it's not likely there will be any time soon. We live in a fairly poor area, and this job pays extremely well for where we live. He's currently making more than the two of us used to make together. (Which isn't actually saying much, considering i was part time.) People who get a job like this hang onto it if they have any sense.      I do plan to talk to him about this again before we go. We've both been working this week, so I've barely seen him. He's off work tomorrow, so hopefully we can discuss it then.       Right now I think my plan is to simply walk away if work comes up or she starts in on anything work or money related. I know I'm probably being unreasonable about this, which is why I see it as my problem. I don't want to put my husband in a bad position between us, especially since he hates conflict. He'll deal with it if it happens, but I am afraid if he ever really got pushed too far and said anything to her, it would open a floodgate that would cause major family problems, because he very much just wants to be left alone by his parents  (in a let me live my own life and realize I'm an adult kind of way, not I don't want to see you or talk to you).       My parents aren't a walk in the park as in-laws go either, so we've always kinda had an unspoken agreement of you deal with yours, I'll deal with mine. I don't want to make him feel like I'm breaking that. We've been together over 14 years, married 13 next month, so I'm not particularly concerned about our relationship, because we are that couple that other people say makes them sick because we make it look easy. However, a big part of that has always been supporting the other, even if we're not happy about the situation, like the shift change. I'm far more concerned with not making him feel like he needs to do things as work to make me happy even though it would be bad for him, than i am about him knowing how much I truly hate the situation. That's why I'm so hesitant to keep bringing it up. I think I'm just an emotional mess right now. ~sigh~"
JUSTNOMIL,3dpbhd,l-x,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"that makes a ton of sense, and please don't think i'm jumping to conclusions about you or your relationship - you have no obligation to justify anything to me. i just hope i'm being helpful as a sounding board.   from what you've said here, it sounds like she's also not really responsible for what happened. it was a perfect storm of stuff, your husband was going to get the position anyway, and it ultimately was for the best. the hours are hard, but your MIL, for all her meddling, seems like she's taking credit for something that really wasn't up to her at all. which is annoying, but also reassuring that she doesn't wield that much power over your lives.  i think the biggest thing is just to give your husband a head's up that this is tough for you. it's ok if there's no resolution and there's nothing you can reasonably expect in order to fix it. at the very least, if he's got your back to help steer the conversation away from work if it comes up, he'll have gotten the memo and be able to do that.   by no means does any of this need to be a blown out laundry list of grievances - either to him, or his mother. just a ""i'm having a hard time with this, and i want to keep things civil. please help me not get into it on this topic if it comes up,""  but like i said, you understand these relationships a LOT more than i do, so follow your gut, and don't feel like you need to justify anything to me!"
JUSTNOMIL,3dpbhd,fruitjerky,3,Sat Jul 18 19:45:12 2015 UTC,"I understand perfectly what you're saying, but the reason I blame her is because my husband's boss made it a point to tell him he was put on night shift as a favor to his mom and her desire for him to work the same days as his dad, and that otherwise he would have been left on his original shift. His boss thought he had done a great thing for the family by giving my MIL what she wanted, but he never bothered to ask my husband what he wanted. On a good note, I got to speak with him briefly a few minutes ago, and told him I had never said anything to her, but that I'm still pissed off at her. I also told him that I would be walking away from any work discussions, lest I lose my temper. I told him I am angry, but I don't want to put him in between us, so I will try to keep the peace. He told me to feel free to tell her that this had not worked out for us and that I don't appreciate her meddling. This was not any of her business to begin with, but she caused a lot of problems. He also said he hasn't said much yet, but he has his own things to say to her. It sounds to me like he isn't as over it as I thought either. At least we're on the same side."

Night shift really causes a person to lose tons of contact and interaction with normal day working people. It's like all they do is sleep and work.  When husband first started working it was at the same hospital his mom worked at. He worked nights. After 2 years of never getting vacation okayed, minimal raises, and no offer to move to a different shift he got a job at a hospital in my town and moved. MIL kept acting like since he worked with her and she was high and mighty from being there so long that she would get him all these amazing perks that he never saw. Their jobs did not overlap and she had no say or control of what went on where he worked in the hospital but she would constantly talk about how amazing he had it and how great the hospital was. It drove me crazy.   She constantly talks about how they take advantage of him where he works now. Because of how his job is classified he doesn't get benefits and he hasn't been offered a set position/schedule. It's been 2 years so it does suck but we get benefits from my job so it's not the end of the world. Also it's a nonunion hospital so he gets less pay and she constantly bemoans how if it was a union hospital he would get paid more and not taken advantage of. How'd that work out at your union hospital MIL? Better pay but he had no life.  The main reason it doesn't bother us too much is that he will be getting into a training program through his current hospital in January. His pay doubles, he gets a set M-F schedule, and benefits when this happens. After the program is over and he passes boards his pay triples. It's great because he doesn't have to stop work to do this program. He actaully gets paid! And the competition is like 4 other people at the hospital. They do this training at MIL's hospital too but through a state college. He would have to apply to a program in college, get accepted, quit his job, train for a year, pay tuition, pass boards, and then get a job. When we try to explain to MIL how what he has now is a much better deal she gets all pissy. Yes, he could have possibly gotten into the program already and be done with it but it all would have depended on if he got into the college program which is way more competitive than the small program at his current job. And there is no guarentee thst he would get to train at her hospital. She also thinks she would have somehow had the pull to get him into the college program. And who cares if you have to pay tuition since he would then be working at her hospital and be union and make more afterwards. They could have lunch together every day. She could protect him if he just would come work at her hospital again. Urghhhhhhh.......  Wow. Sorry to hijack your post. Apparently I needed to get that out."

A short example: MIL has a horrible habit of just talking over me. She will sometimes ask me a question, then when I'm half way through answering she will just turn and talk to my SO instead.

If you believe in karma, or something like it, then you know that your MIL is digging her own grave, so to speak.  Also, you will gain from not fighting back.  Try putting yourself in your MIL's shoes for a few minutes.  Just imagine making another person's life hell: belittling them, saying bad things, and doing all you can to hurt that person.  How do you think you would feel after doing that to another, innocent, human being?  The average person would feel horrible because deep down they know what they are doing is wrong.  Their misdeeds would eat at them and eventually destroy them.  One way or another, they will pay for their misdeeds.  You can either benefit or suffer the same fate.  When they hurt you, don't hide your emotions.  It is ok to show your hurt and pain.  In fact this is the only way you will get through it.  Never bottle it up, but let it all out.  That will get to them and it will on a subconscious level make their misdeeds sink in more and more: they will know they are doing wrong.  They will know that you are innocent.  They will know that you don't deserve what they are doing to you.  You cannot win by playing their game.  The only winning move is to not play the game at all.  Above all, however, pitty them.  They are not on a good path in life.  They want you to walk the same path.  For the sake of your sanity, your family's well being, and your future: don't do it."

IF he wants to even bother with it, he can put it in these terms:  ""it's hurtful that you want to visit but don't want to see me. instead, you just want to spend time with my wife and my children when i'm not around. i'm rescheduling because i would like to actually see you, my mother.""   this puts the onus on her to quit her fucking bullshit and actually schedule a visit that isn't about her pulling a power trip, but actually seeing her family and spending time with ALL of you.  don't even bother with the rest of it. it's all window dressing for the real issue which is that either you jump when she says jump, or you look like the asshole who doesn't want to see her. address the root issue and it takes away her ability to dictate your lives."

For the love of all that is holy, stop being so easy-going. This is YOUR child we are talking about, be blunt when people annoy you at very important times like feeding.  ""MiL, with all due respect, don't you ever swat my hand like that again. Ever.""  ""Sorry but I am about to feed LO and I want to be alone to do it. I will join you all in a short while.""  ""MiL, I'm feeding LO, please stop tickling. Now.""  ""No, I will not let you take LO on this carrousel.""  Oh, by the way:   (and she demands we hang out with her about once a week)   You are in no time under the obligation to satisfy what looks like a whim.

Of course when she initially told me it was planned for the same day as my shower she straight up told me she couldn't change the date because she had already changed it once so she could accommodate people they REALLY wanted to be there...

JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,bitch-ass_ho,8,Fri Jul 17 13:39:25 2015 UTC,The best part is there is a hefty dose of truth to what you're saying. Why are they so obsessed with baby penises?
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,Trexy,3,Fri Jul 17 13:47:46 2015 UTC,That's what makes it so beautiful!
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,TheEthalea,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:09 2015 UTC,That is fantastic.
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,Syrinx221,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:48:51 2015 UTC,"This is my go to with the whole circumcision thing. I had girls so I didn't deal with it personally. I couldn't tell you if my nephews are snipped or not because I don't care. It's not my dick,it's not my problem."
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,katyrose_,19,Sat Jul 18 20:38:05 2015 UTC,I would not leave your infants alone with her. I think there was a thread fairly recently where a woman's MIL took her granddaughter to get circumcised when the baby was left in her care.
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,-purple-is-a-fruit-,16,Fri Jul 17 05:25:04 2015 UTC,"Wait. Commented, then did a double take. Someone took a granddaughter in to be circumcised? As in female circumcision?! Please tell me that was a typo...."
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,actuallyachick,13,Fri Jul 17 05:46:54 2015 UTC,"I wish I could say it was. I think it was a thread either on twox or relationships. I think the mil of the family wanted the daughter to be circumcised for religious reasons, and the mother was against it. Left the baby with MIL, came home and baby was upset, that's when MIL spilled the beans. Please don't leave your mother in law alone with your boys."
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,l-x,12,Fri Jul 17 08:07:39 2015 UTC,"That's incredibly sad.  She's not quite THAT crazy, luckily. But she is an alcoholic, so she was never going to be allowed to be alone with them. We just added diaper changes to the list of things that aren't happening."
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,pamplemousse2,10,Fri Jul 17 08:26:34 2015 UTC,Not OP but it happens a lot in Europe :/
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,LadyOfSighs,6,Fri Jul 17 05:52:42 2015 UTC,"That thread in particular, I think she said her MIL and FIL were both doctors and STILL took her baby and had her clitoris and clitoral hood cut off."
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,artfully_dodgy,8,Fri Jul 17 10:58:55 2015 UTC,I don't even have words.
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,reneykins,7,Fri Jul 17 12:15:32 2015 UTC,"Actually I think it was implied that, because the parents are med. professionals, that THEY might have done the procedure while she was out. Also this was in California. The Bay Area, I believe."
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,artfully_dodgy,6,Fri Jul 17 14:25:17 2015 UTC,I am beyond horrified.
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,ellovefun,3,Fri Jul 17 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, it was bad."
JUSTNOMIL,3dklxu,WombatBeans,8,Fri Jul 17 19:55:50 2015 UTC,"Oh heck no. She's an alcoholic, so there's no question of us ever leaving her alone with them."

JUSTNOMIL,3dghce,Rosertot,3,Thu Jul 16 02:10:48 2015 UTC,YAAAAY HAPPY DANCE
JUSTNOMIL,3dghce,Bookwormkeeper9000,3,Thu Jul 16 14:01:09 2015 UTC,OMG.. Happy day??? I would die and go to heaven if my MIL said she was fine limiting contact with us. I think I'm depressed now.
JUSTNOMIL,3dghce,MiaMae,2,Thu Jul 16 20:38:26 2015 UTC,"I'm still in shock, but I'm taking it with a HUGE grain of salt."
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,Arghmil,64,Thu Jul 16 00:50:32 2015 UTC,"You are far better than me.  If I heard my MiL calling my baby boy a lard ass I would be grabbing him out of their hands, and passive aggressively begin talking to my baby loud enough for her to hear that ""don't worry sweetie, you are growing perfectly, grandma's just a bitch."" And then I'd just leave..."
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,kiwi1855,23,Thu Jul 16 01:53:18 2015 UTC,"I think I'd want to pick him up and say ""Sorry hunnie, it looks like Grandmas is getting too weak to hold you.  It's ok, momma's got you.""  My first thought was ""looks like you're getting too heavy for grandma"" but no, you want to make it about her.  No blaming the baby."

JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,thisismeER,42,Thu Jul 16 05:52:26 2015 UTC,"Calling a child ""lard ass"" is totally inappropriate at any age. That's actually pretty disturbing. I'd have flipped my shit on her by now."

JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,Ashley777,9,Thu Jul 16 02:56:22 2015 UTC,This- do this!
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,Cupcake_eater,41,Thu Jul 16 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"When I was 8 months pregnant with my first baby, I had an uncle who thought it would be hilarious to greet me at a large family event with, ""Hello, fatso!"" Without missing a beat, my automatic reply was, ""I may be larger than I normally am, but you're a fucking moron. I'm pregnant; what's your excuse?"" He never said anything like that to me or another family member again, pregnant or otherwise.  Body shaming is never acceptable. If I were in your position, I'd say whatever I needed to to nip that shit in the bud. Assholes."
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,PhutuqKusi,3,Thu Jul 16 05:58:15 2015 UTC,He must be a real winner. And unmarried.
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,IncredibleBulk2,22,Fri Jul 17 18:49:23 2015 UTC,"You should probably have a talk with them about this before your baby gets old enough to understand. If they call it fat now, when babies are supposed to be, it's probably not going to stop."
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,nomorechocolatebars,33,Thu Jul 16 05:34:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, the next time she says something like that, take the baby and leave the room. If she's using abusive language with a 3 month old, I can't even imagine what it will evolve into."
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,catnamedbear,9,Thu Jul 16 01:45:43 2015 UTC,"So this hits home for me. My fiancee has exteme body issues because his mom constantly told him he was fat. She was/is acting out of her own insecurities because she is the only one in that household that is overweight.   My fiancee has the sexiest body in the world. He is seriously built like Chris Pratt in Guardians. I tell him that everyday and he still cannot seem to comprehend how attractive his build is.   If my MIL thinks it is ok to make comments like this to my child, I would lose my shit. I will not let her ruin my child's body image like she did to her son."
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,catsarethenewblack,3,Thu Jul 16 13:45:35 2015 UTC,He is seriously built like Chris Pratt in Guardians.   Yum!

JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,7,Thu Jul 16 14:05:36 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks everyone - SO and I had quite the chat about it last night, I had had enough. He thinks it's a misguided attempt at a compliment - we had a bunch of feeding issues and jaundice early on so he thinks she's actually trying to say that the eating is going well? Wrong way to go about it though and if it keeps up I'm not biting my tongue anymore. They will NEVER say things like that when he can understand because if they continue they won't see him when he can understand!!"
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,dartini,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh i think she wants it to play out like that but i think shes actually trying to insult you. When people say stupid shit like that they want you to get mad. Don't get mad and they'll be left frustrated and unsatisfied, trust me"
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,I_RunWithScissors,9,Sun Jul 19 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"Hell no. Tell her that she is not allowed to comment on the size of your child. If she wants to see the baby, she will only say positive things. The end.   GMIL can suck an egg too.   I don't understand why so many people call babies fat!"
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,lila_liechtenstein,3,Thu Jul 16 11:06:06 2015 UTC,"She's horrible, and also she doesn't know shit. I take it your son is still on breast milk / formula only? It's actually not that easy to overfeed a kid that young unless you give him the wrong formula, or worse stuff. At that age they still know pretty well when they're hungry and when they're full, and if he gets a bit chubbier, that's the sign of an oncoming growth spurt. And your baby is the best thing ever. It never stops. Mine is 9, and she still is :)"
JUSTNOMIL,3dg7qd,Aggromemnon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"AAARGH!  Why do people name-call children?  That is a horrible habit to start.  At least he's still young enough he won't consciously remember her being hurtful, but he may develop an instinctual sense of her being a cruel bitch.  In a few more months, if she keeps it up, he'll remember every word.  You might remind her of that."

You can go anywhere without thinking about how much formula you need to take - and if you want to go alone, just pump it down for later with one of those little handy pump things. You can even store the stuff for a while in the freezer."

She started posting it on Facebook and being the keeper of all the old family photos I grabbed my sis's baby picture of the first time I held her in the hospital and a pic of my new niece the first time my mom held her in the hospital. LO is the spitting exact image of my sister as a baby.   I cropped them together, put their birth dates across the bottom, and put ""Like Mother, Like Daughter!!"" across the top. Then I posted it on Facebook and tagged my BIL's entire family who had been gushing about how much the baby looked like him and how they were so glad she didn't look like my sis.

JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,Bookwormkeeper9000,6,Wed Jul 15 18:09:43 2015 UTC,"Husband wanted here there.  Well, she wanted to he there and husband backed her up because he's a big mama's boy.  Complained every time she stepped out about how she was stressing him out but ... fuck it."
JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,ProfSnugglesworth,54,Wed Jul 15 18:18:31 2015 UTC,Your husband's goddamned opinion matters when he's pushing a golf ball through his dickhole.
JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,canderson05,19,Wed Jul 15 19:18:31 2015 UTC,This needs to be a placard on every delivery room wall.
JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,lilbluehair,7,Wed Jul 15 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"ha, you're right, he can have her in the room when he's passing a kidney stone!"
JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,cordsniper,8,Wed Jul 15 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"Normally, I'm of the opinion that fathers should be involved and have their wishes respected when it comes to birth because, hey, they are the father....but to a reasonable extent. I would have bludgeoned this MIL (and possibly husband too) with the IV pole. But I probably would have gone off the deep earlier, right around the wasting a fuck ton of money/ruining a wedding bullshit."
JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,a_jill_sandwich,3,Wed Jul 15 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"My so would not have made it out of there alive. He would be so dead, I can't even begin to articulate it. And then, I would bludgeon his mother with his dead body. You should apply for sainthood for doing that twice."
JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,MissMamanda,12,Wed Jul 15 23:33:49 2015 UTC,"hoooooly shit, why are you still putting up with this? She obviously knows that she can get whatever she wants and you guys won't do anything about it. Time for boundaries!"
JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,rofosho,4,Wed Jul 15 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not so much anymore.  There's still crap but not like it was the first several years.  Can't say that resentment isn't a huge issue for me, though."
JUSTNOMIL,3den5b,MiaMae,9,Wed Jul 15 23:21:10 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain I would have stabbed your MIL at some point.  For sure in the delivery room.

JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,LoneStarTwinkie,8,Thu Jul 16 02:03:29 2015 UTC,Tell her that you heard menopause can cause vaginal dryness.  Has she had that?  Is it true that your pubes go grey as you get older?  How's her pelvic floor?  Any issues with incontinence?
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,yw1,44,Thu Jul 16 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"As someone without children, I'm slowing learning from this sub that when you get married, your in-laws think they take an ownership interest in your lady parts.  Or at least get a timeshare."
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,ohfluffit,18,Wed Jul 15 17:17:17 2015 UTC,I think that's the hardest thing to realize. I'm a very private person and right now I feel like no one is respecting NORMAL boundaries. I just don't understand.

JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,IncredibleBulk2,15,Wed Jul 15 20:21:35 2015 UTC,Tell her it bothers you that she asks about your reproductive health. Just tell her you don't want to talk about it with her.
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,Puffsdangerfield,13,Wed Jul 15 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"Sadly, this is the mature thing to do, but she's already been in tears a few times during my pregnancy, and I'm not really sure that I can say this without completely offending her and having to deal with her in tears. Again.  She cried because I told her she couldn't tell people about the baby until we had. We made a point of telling my husband's immediate family and closest aunt/uncle combo first, so she could talkto someone about it. But apparently that wasn't good enough. When I told her that she had to wait until I told my family (0 people knew at this point), she was in tears and said said she didn't think it was fair, and someone had to be last anyways, so why couldn't she tell?  Reasonable doesn't seem to be her forte"
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,Puffsdangerfield,14,Wed Jul 15 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"Empathy is good, but not to the point where you are setting yourself on fire to keep others warm. The boundaries you set and enforce now will set the tone for the boundaries you will need for when the baby is born.   When a toddler throws a tantrum, if you give in, the toddler learns if they throw a big enough fit that they will get what they want.This is what your MIL is doing. If she throws a big enough tantrum, she will get what she wants. That is enabling her behavior and enforcing it. It will also make it MUCH HARDER to negate when you finally get sick of it and put your foot down. In these situations, you are choosing when you are going to have this battle over your rights of choice for you, your body, and your child. Her behavior is NOT normal or healthy. If she is going to literally cry over you telling your family, how is she going to react when you breastfeed and she can't give LO a bottle?   Next time the manipulative water works start when you say no, leave. Don't give the tantrum any attention, just like you wouldn't with a toddler. ""I can see you are upset by my reasonable needs. I'll go and give you time to compose yourself."" Don't apologize. Don't justify. Just give her time to get over it. If she brings it up again, ""MIL, we already had this conversation. I said no."" And then move on. Change the subject. Ignore the tantrum.   My mother was VERY much like this. I was basically thrust into the role of a parent with her often. She pushed back at first, would cry, tantrum, ignore me (which was a blessing), but when she saw I wasn't wavering in setting what was healthy boundaries for me and enforcing them without discord, she stopped for the most part.   Also, remember. Just because someone is offended, it doesn't mean that they are right. Especially if they are using emotional manipulation. That is the easiest and worst behavior to enable in anyone. And the worst to deal with in adults."
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,JacOfAllTrades,8,Wed Jul 15 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"I know you're completely right. But I struggle because I feel like I'm in their space and some what beholden to them (even though its a separate suite). I think I will feel more confident once I'm back into my own space, just waiting on paperwork for the mortgage. In the short term, it feels like I need to negotiate somewhat carefully, and once we're out it'll be easier. But maybe I'm lying to myself?  I think I""ll just start repeating ""I'll let you know as soon as we have knews about the baby."" and try and redirect away from what my body is doing and back towards what really, we should all care about. Urgh. I think this is really hard too because I'm estranged from my parents, so I've been independent since I Was 18, and never had to negotiate these types of things...."
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,LoneStarTwinkie,8,Wed Jul 15 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"But maybe I'm lying to myself?   So what you are saying to yourself is that because you live with them, you don't have the right to privacy? or that they are entitled to very intimate details about you?   That's not a very healthy viewpoint. Healthy would be thinking you should help with chores and being a gracious guest by chipping in where you can. Not giving her access to your vagina, overrunning your very valid needs and wants, and basically forcing you to give her what she wants on all things.   Negotiating carefully would be stomaching her bad food, eating what she wants for dinner, watching shows she wants to, etc. What she is wanting is for you to lay down and be the doormat. Don't do that."
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,cordsniper,8,Wed Jul 15 19:57:23 2015 UTC,"This is the best advice. It's scary because you're counting on them right now, but you can't give in to the crying or you'll find she will just basically cry constantly. Maybe say something like, ""I appreciate your concern, but it makes me uncomfortable to talk about my downstairs with anyone other than my husband or medical professionals. I trust my doctors to take care of me, and I will let you know what they say."" She's not a doctor, so you're amount of bleeding really means nothing to her. She can't do anything with that info other than use it to ask even more prying questions. Just remember: no means no."
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,ReadingRainbowSix,7,Wed Jul 15 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"I think this is a gentle, excellent way to be firm, reasonable, and polite instead of smacking her with a trout."
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,IncredibleBulk2,7,Thu Jul 16 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"""Then you will be last to know the next piece of information regarding this.""  Stare in eyes, don't blink then turn and walk away."
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,Bobalery,2,Wed Jul 15 18:45:16 2015 UTC,"But, isn't she on bed rest? So maybe more like ""pop in ear buds and zone out"""
JUSTNOMIL,3deg7t,IncredibleBulk2,7,Wed Jul 15 22:29:45 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't offend someone to ask for privacy. Her unreasonableness and tears are her own problem, not yours. Try to establish some boundaries. Or, ask your hubs to shut her down."

JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,brideisblue,21,Wed Jul 15 14:00:14 2015 UTC,LOLWUT. So many whys: why does she want to know why did the hotel give out dates and names why does she think this is ok why why why  How did you find out about this?  Did some poor friend of yours call to say FMIL was interrogating her?
JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,Bookwormkeeper9000,16,Wed Jul 15 14:09:17 2015 UTC,"lol yep. She actually wrote me ""Noooooooooo! The day has finally come that your FMIL has my number. I will tell you all about it tonight!"". I was mad that my FMIL was doing this; she wasn't mad about the privacy breach so much as a little weirded out."
JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,Bookwormkeeper9000,17,Wed Jul 15 14:22:11 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to be patient and understand where your FMIL is coming from and drawing a blank.  Especially since it sounds like you don't have gender-specific items in the welcome baskets.  I could understand if you had like, I don't know, nail polishes that matched your wedding colors or tie clips or something.  Actually, that nail polish idea is super cute and I wish I'd done that for mine.  Now I want to get re-married and do that."
JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,Lockraemono,9,Wed Jul 15 14:34:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried to think of it that way as well. I think a more tactful way to have asked the question is to ask the name of the person in the room, but even then I feel like it's still awkward. There are probably 100 people staying in the hotel; I just don't understand why she takes a simple task and makes it super complicated. And then she gets mad when people don't call her back and tell her. I know she is just trying to be nice but holy crap stop it. Every time she goes too far and someone talks to her she acts like she understands where they are coming from and then she's like ""oh well let me do it again""."
JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,Bookwormkeeper9000,7,Wed Jul 15 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, that nail polish idea is super cute and I wish I'd done that for mine. Now I want to get re-married and do that.   Oh shit. Good idea. I only have a small number of guests for my wedding in November, totally stealing this."
JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,KHeaney,3,Wed Jul 15 17:46:48 2015 UTC,Steal away!  I can't believe I didn't think of that before I got married.  It would be a great photo op to do a hands-in huddle with all those painted nails!
JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,followthepost-its,2,Wed Jul 15 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"Even then, depending on the cost, you can just chuck in two tie-pins and a bottle of nail polish and it'll be fine. If they don't need something, they can keep it as a spare, or keep it as a momento, or give it to another guest.   I don't think the MiL is being particularly malicious or judgemental, but probably has some curiosity itch she needs to scratch (any answer is fine as long as she gets an answer), or she just wants to know everything so she feels organised and matriarchal about something. It's still inappropriate though!  I also love the gift basket with token matching items idea!"
JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,Ashley777,15,Thu Jul 16 10:14:30 2015 UTC,If a hotel freely gave out my information I'd file a complaint. That's insane

JUSTNOMIL,3ddr8z,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,3,Wed Jul 15 19:36:27 2015 UTC,"I can follow her reasoning for wanting to know, I do bag/baskets and it is helpful information to know if you're going for a more ""personal"" type feel.   HOWEVER, she never should have called them. She should have asked you, and you could have either told her or let her know not to be that specific. That is bizarre and if I were a guest, I'd be a little irritated that the hotel gave my info out like that."

She has cried so hard over me not hugging her back hard enough, not loving every single item she buys me, saying I want a different plan than hers, or trying to talk about what bothers me. She taught me having different wants was mean and wrong, leading me to truly believe if I didn't know what someone wants or needs before they say anything, or even before they know, I was selfish and didn't care about others.

JUSTNOMIL,3dck2u,Ashleve,5,Wed Jul 15 13:13:19 2015 UTC,"Yikes! I would've been super creeped out just by the level of her invasion of my personal space let alone her touching me!   Along the lines of assuming everyone's body is the same as hers, my MIL came with me to my wedding dress fitting because my own mother lives in a different town than I do. During said fitting, she felt it appropriate to comment on the fact that I have some chest hair (which I was hella self conscious about). Wtf MIL, I am already super vulnerable, in my wedding dress being poked and prodded with pins and you have to comment that ""oh! You have some hair there!"" No shit, thanks for pointing it out."
JUSTNOMIL,3dck2u,Nikkirich89,4,Wed Jul 15 14:39:37 2015 UTC,Nooope. Omg. I would not be having that. I need my personal bubble.

JUSTNOMIL,3dbdp5,Randallsmom,3,Wed Jul 15 01:18:14 2015 UTC,My fil gets kinda freaked out when the crying starts and a bit panicked but overall handles it well considering. I also want to say I can't handle it at all. If my baby cries for any length of time I panick and get upset. Thankfully I think I have an easy baby but I need to get it together. She's only 2 and half months! Your mil also needs to get it together lol. She could have handled it differently for sure! :(

She then taunted me about it and told me to drive to Kmart to buy some more food. I didn't eat anything all day until the reception at 5 pm.  There's a lot of shit she has pulled, a surprising amount for living 5,000 miles away, but this is the main one I will never ever forget. I was nursing an infant, too, and I needed food."

JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,lakashhar,16,Wed Jul 15 02:27:14 2015 UTC,"My husband and I first started dating when we were 16. He came home from our first date with some kind of bruise on his neck that his mom assumed was a Hickey (not physically possible at that point as I had not kissed his neck, nor gone all vampire on it). So his mom does the only rational thing when your 16 year old teen comes home with an imaginary Hickey. She called my mom drunk at 6am the next day to tell her to keep her whore daughter away from her son. Thanks MIL. She still thinks that was justified.  About a year after that incident she got out of jail (yes, jail, for her 11th DUI). We are 17, and I'm looking at graduating soon, but husband has another year left of high school. We talk a lot about a mutual split at this point so we aren't waiting around for each other. We would very much like a serious relationship, but realized we had some obstacles in the way at this time and so we never took our relationship to the next level. We were both virgins at this point. MIL starts asking when I will give her grand babies. She tells me that she still has all of husbands baby things in storage so I could use them! I can't imagine how terrified my poor teen virgin face looked in that moment. She seems to think she was being nice and we were bonding or something.  After some time apart we agree both our parents are insane and we make a good team. We decided our best shot at a real family was with each other. About a year after I graduated highschool we get married. We were 18 and the news was not well received. We did not, and still do not, care because our parents are insane. We temporarily move in with some roommates in town in an attempt to afford housing. MIL protests because one of the roommates has been in trouble with the law a couple times. Though he never went to jail. She wants us to live with her on an inflatable mattress on the living room floor of a two bed one bath single wide trailer with 3 other people in it. Instead we ended up moving out of town completely, it was a good plan. She doesn't know why I ""hate"" her, she's been nothing but nice to me! Why am I taking her baby away?!  I got hours worth of material here. This is just some of the crap she pulled before we were even married!"
JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,magical_realist,3,Tue Jul 14 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"So... She didn't like that your roommate had troubles with the law, yet she herself had been to jail. Oookay then."

The first weekend I ever stayed with my then-boyfriend at his parents and met them, the moment we were alone she got on the topic of children and brought up how she wished she could have had more kids and that she had a miscarriage before and after my husband. Okay then... She has a habit of speaking before thinking and bringing up uncomfortable topics. But honestly, if that's the worst it gets for me, I'll take it."
JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,ohfluffit,5,Tue Jul 14 13:06:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, if it's something that could effect your kids this might make sense.

JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,Brooderz,4,Tue Jul 14 19:50:45 2015 UTC,I've had that one too. My GF's Dad is a twin and mine is as well and her auntie also had twins so her Mum likes to say we'll have them. She really doesn't like it when I say I might not want kids though.

It makes my mom crazy when I say I may not want them, but I'm 27, I work nights in service, I like going out after. I'm not 100% sure whether we're headed for marriage. I think we are, but we're not even two years in (officially.) I'm not exactly the prime candidate to quit my birth control.   It's weird, because I know he'd be a kickass dad, but I'm a good pet mom.

In the ten minutes before we got there she told my parents all the juicy details of his previous engagement, and wedding cancelled at the last minute.

Two days in and my husband and I completely regretted inviting her to stay for so long. I love my mil and she truly means well, but she is an INCREDIBLY stressful person to be around. She drove me crazy with all her comments criticizing and commenting on anything and everything. I was brand new to breastfeeding and she had absolutely no first hand experience with it, but she had 10 gazillion things to say about what I was doing wrong and how I should feed my baby more. There's no way to measure how much the baby is getting when you're exclusively breastfeeding and she made the process so much more difficult. I'm sure she was just trying to be helpful but I just wanted to scream at her, STFU! You don't know what you're talking about!! All while politely nodding my head and pretending to listen. The worst part was that she was so quick to blame me if the baby cried. Somehow it was always my fault! Oh he's crying because you didn't feed him enough! He's crying because you didn't burp him well! No, he's crying because HE'S A BABY!!!"

After finishing up our fun, I heard my MIL standing outside our bedroom door making loud sex noises at us.  I don't believe in using sex as a weapon, but my husband now knows that when his parents visit, sex is not an option. If we have no privacy, then we have no sex.  She's done other unbelievable things too, but that's one that still makes my blood pressure rise just thinking about it."

JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,Elda30,10,Tue Jul 14 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"Well basically because I'm a socially awkward penguin, I sort of went after my husband about it, to be honest. I should have gone straight to her and dealt with it but A) I'm a believer that each person in a relationship needs to be the one to deal with bad behavior of their own family and B) HOW THE FUCK DO I EVEN BRING THIS UP TO HER?? It was completely unchartered territory. I'm Boston- Irish Catholic, we just don't talk about this kind of stuff unless we're really fucking drunk (and even then it's not a comfy topic).  So I got pretty angry at my husband (then fiance) about it and started a huge fight- he was understandably upset at being attacked about something he hadn't personally done or witnessed. But I was just so over having no sense of privacy when his parents were visiting (this was around the time his father walked into my room without knocking while I was putting on a sanitary pad.... yyyeeeaaahh that happened too) in my own home. It got ugly, really quickly. My husband did see my point but was sort of caught between wanting to keep his parents happy and his wife happy. Therapy ensued. The counselor must have laughed her ass off after every session because if I were on the receiving end of someone telling these stories, I certainly would too! Just listing these gross occurrences of obvious..I don't want to say disrespect because it implies maliciousness on their part...but definitely no respect for boundaries. Sort of a ""Well, we're all family now so no secrets!"" sort of thing.  Anyway. I've made it clear that she's not allowed to clean anything in the house unless I've asked her for help with something. I have a sneaking suspicion she's done stuff without my knowledge (folding undies, putting them away, etc) but that's been OK because I truly needed the help at the time.  And they'll be up for a visit in a couple of weeks so we will see how that goes!"
JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,yw1,7,Tue Jul 14 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would pretty much have a heart attack in either of those instances.

I'm not private, necessarily, but I have some gigantic boundaries from being raised by my own mother, which is another thread. So to me, I'm like ""oh hey, that has to do with my vagina, so sorry, thanks."" You're all fucking saints."

She's lucky your husband is willing to not have sex so they can visit... my husband would have put a perma-ban on visits if it meant no vag access.    Plus, sex is how grandkids are made...you would think that anyone who wants grandchildren would not do anything to discourage sex!"
JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,ReadingRainbowSix,13,Tue Jul 14 14:06:41 2015 UTC,"Oooohhhh both MIL and FIL have overstepped major boundaries in my home (which they stayed in with us before my husband and I were even engaged. They just have no concept of how to behave as guests in someone else's house.) We've had extended therapy sessions, talks, boundaries set. I anticipate more problems in the future.  Oh and she wasn't trying to discourage sex, she was trying to make a ""joke"" about it, like a 14 year old boy would. It really skeeved me out."
JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,Elda30,12,Tue Jul 14 14:27:40 2015 UTC,Why is she still allowed to stay at your house? Maybe they should get a hotel so you can have much-needed stress-relieving sex during their visits. Holy cow.
JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,ReadingRainbowSix,11,Tue Jul 14 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"LOL. Well we may get to that point. I will say that, since that incident and my ensuing freak out that many boundaries have been put into place and nothing quite so egregious has happened since. I did feel ridiculous having to tell someone twice my age that ""We don't hit dogs that live here"" (that was directed at my FIL) or ""Please put on clothes when you walk from the shower to the guest room"" (MIL loooooves to run around naked!) but that's the family I married into. It's tough to come to terms with the fact that these people ARE family, but they are people I would have nothin to do with if I wasn't in love with their son. They do have their positive traits as well, so that does help...and I'm sure there's things about me that bother them as well.   Husband and I have had counseling about this so he's made them aware of boundaries and it's up to the two of us to enforce them."
JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,Elda30,8,Tue Jul 14 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"But you still put up with these people and can't have sex in your own home? It doesn't have to be like that. There are halfway points so everyone gets a bit of what they want.  I don't let my own family stay with us when they're in town simply because my husband and I need space. They get a hotel a block from our house and it works out wonderfully every time. And my family are normal, loving people without boundary issues who want all the time they can get with us and especially the kids."
JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,Syrinx221,5,Wed Jul 15 00:11:13 2015 UTC,I would love nothing more than for them to stay in a hotel when visiting.

JUSTNOMIL,3d800r,Elda30,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"Not to be harsh but, that's their problem. If they're going to travel, they need to budget for lodging.  Other people can't decide they're going to stay at your house without your consent.   We're going on a trip to where half my husband's entire family lives, with two small kids, to celebrate our wedding we're hosting there and we never even considered asking to stay with anyone there, let alone demand it. And it's not because there's not room, it's because that's fucking rude. We are a one-income family and have been saving for this for a while but, we did it and were able to find a decent hotel nearby. See what I'm saying?

While yes, I agree that a hotel would be preferable, sadly it has not always been an option; so yes I had to make some choices that were way less than ideal for me personally.  I do have a child who adores his grandparents and who does not get to spend much time with them; and despite personality quirks that often rub me the wrong way, the relationship between my child and his grandparents is worth more to me than me choosing to die on this particular hill. But thank you for your concern for his welfare as well- I think you'll  probably agree that people who pontificate at you about your issues a bit irritating especially when it comes to raising your kids.  Please also keep in mind that these stories happened roughly 2-4 years ago and I was telling them more as a form of entertainment than as a plea for help. Again, I've got that covered.

Here are a few of the inappropriate things my MIL has said to me over the years:  The first time I went to his mother's house, she cooed over my small wait and insisted on putting one of her many corsets on me. In front of her son. And then make innuendos about how her boyfriend loves them, and asked her son if he liked what he saw on me. This being my first time at her house, I wanted to make a good impression and went with it, but everyone involved was very uncomfortable, except for her.   She has tried to talk to me about my sex life with her son multiple times. I come from an admittedly more conservative family, so this has never felt ok.   The kicker though is when she decided to bring up what sex toys she uses at this past years thanksgiving dinner and then proceed to badger  me about what me and her son use. She could see me blushing. She knew I was uncomfortable talking about this not only with her but in front of the whole family.   Some people have no boundaries"

Have you tried talking to her about how uncomfortable she makes you? Or to your husband? I'm learning how to say ""I'm not comfortable discussing this with you"" though it's hard.

She is super fun, for the most part very sweet, and has taught me a lot about patience and perserverence.  She is deceptively strong (mentally and physically) and raise three great kids, one of which I have the pleasure of being married to. She did pull one stunt (was it a stunt?  I don't even know) a few weeks before our wedding.  She always calls herself a little country girl and our wedding was going to be at a fancy hotel.  She kept stressing about not knowing what to wear or do since it was so fancy (perfectly ridiculous, she has excellent manners, plus, we were surrounded by family and friends, so almost everyone already knew her) and my mother said, ""Calm down!  I think as long as you don't wear overalls and black out a tooth you should be fine!"" as a joke because, obviously, she would never do that.   Well.  The next day she called my husband in tears, telling him my mother was being mean to her and essentially called her a hillbilly.    It took a week of furious phone calls all around to resolve the issue.  My mother has a dry sense of humor but is certainly NOT one to make anyone but her own children feel like shit.   I never could figure out if MIL was genuinely offended and misread what my mom said, or if she was pulling this stunt to see how I would react.  I guess I did just the right thing because we have a great relationship now.  She and my mother rarely see each other XD."

My MIL had asked for photos of myself and husband about a month before Christmas. She compiled a whole bunch of family photos and put together a holiday calendar for her parents (with whom I am fairly close).  We opened the final product on Christmas day with the family ... when I realized I wasn't in ANY photos. Not one, despite how many I sent her. So as we're going through, she's explaining ""Here's a picture of Joey since this month is his birthday.. Here's a picture of so-and-so on Valentines day for February."" So she rolls around to June and says, ""I didn't have any special event in June so I put a picture of a car. I replied, ""My birthday's in June."" and walked out of the room with my head shaking."

I'd be really hurt.  That's just beyond stupid of her.   I have a weird calendar story too. My psycho cousin in law refused to do a family calendar this year for the 60 person strong family because we had a childfree wedding and she (along with everyone else) wasn't given an exemption.

I use a sidecar crib (arm's reach cosleeper). Maybe consider that, because cosleeping is super safe (the cosleeper I use boasts a 100% safety record) but bedsharing with a young infant is not a safe sleeping arrangement."
JUSTNOMIL,3d5n0t,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,43,Mon Jul 13 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"I live in an area that neighbors the city with the highest mortality rate for children in the nation,  until they started requiring that mothers agree to not bed share (the agreement is in exchange for diapers for 6 months- they check with the families to ensure that they are still ABC sleeping ((Alone-on their BACK-in a Crib)) so the families continue to get the diapers) the infant mortality rate dropped 75% and has been consistent for the past 5 years. It's hard to deny that this single step made such a difference, and it's the reason we decided not to bed share with our first after having plans to do so. I understand everyone has their own parenting opinions, and it's our job as parents to take in all the information from every side that we can,  in order to make our own plan.  But maybe that's what she's  trying to do for you OP is give you more info."

People feel passionately about their decisions,  I know I did when I originally planned on bed sharing. There's nothing that we can say to change the minds of some people, I don't think anyone could've changed my mind until I saw on the news that this city had found a simple way to save so many infant lives.   Also in 2013 the AAP said the most common risk from parents who bed shared ""correctly"" was actually overheating. An infant is suppose to sleep on a firm surface in a cool environment, which is why parents such as yourself choose to Co sleep with a side sleeper or similar device. Link"
JUSTNOMIL,3d5n0t,OneRebelYell,11,Mon Jul 13 21:00:36 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure if it'd be considered bedsharing or cosleeping.

It's meant to be used in the bed for overnight sleeping with parents.  If/when we use a snoogle to prop the baby up it'd be much later and I don't see either of us sleeping while that happens, more like a prop for naptimes while we get house/schoolwork done."

She was a new mom in the 80s and early 90s and said it was recommended she bottle feed all three of her sons and with the first two have them sleep on their stomach, second son side sleep. Since her patients are getting implants and such rather than check ups on their pregnancies, it doesn't really shock me that she has some differing information than what my doctor says and what the baby/pregnancy books my doctor recommended say, but I feel like it'd be pretty easy for her to get this information if she really thinks what I'm saying is wrong."

You are doing the right thing by researching as much as possible with books and videos. That's how people in our generation learn. In your MIL's generation, they probably learned from their moms.

The nurses are on your side, and if you don't want visitors, they are willing to fib for you so that you don't get intruders.  One of my aunts wanted to stop by and meet the baby while we were still in the hospital, I was feeling loopy due to meds after an unplanned C-section, and not in the mood for a long visit. So the nurses and I devised a plan that no more than 45 minutes after they got there, the nurses would come in and make up an excuse if I needed one, we had a code word and everything haha. We ended up not needing it, because my aunt never showed, didn't give us a call until almost 2 hours after she was supposed to be there."

They are champs at keeping people out and won't be bullied. Strict no visitor policy and turn your phones off for good measure. :)  Edit: Oh and make sure she is the last one to hold the baby.

We also lived in what I call the ""fuck you zone"".  Close enough we were expected to attend every family get together or go down for three day weekends, far enough away it was a major ass ache.

If you think you're going to have enough going on, between getting ready for the party and balancing your relatives, I don't see the harm in skipping it. But if you do skip out, especially if you have or are trying for a good relationship with BIL, I'd try to do something nice for him, because I'm sure he's not too excited to share a birthday weekend with your engagement either, or maybe he doesn't care and MIL is just being a bitch.  If you're fiancé isn't already on board, just say that you are looking at this as an opportunity for you both to spend time with your families, before everyone comes together for the engagement party.

Plan a brunch with your family the morning of or the morning after the engagement party if you feel it's important to gather with them outside of the engagement party.

I had my cat tested this past year, and she hasn't been around any other cats since. Only one cat of hers is spayed. They pretty much live like a feral colony, minus the feral part. It's just a clusterfuck."

JUSTNOMIL,3d1lw0,prettywannapancake,8,Sun Jul 12 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"Heh... Thanks. It's hard because while she clearly has issues, she goes between doing stuff like this and doing super nice thoughtful things that I really admire. She wants what's best for her kids, but she's really manipulative and gets really aggressive if people aren't doing what she thinks is best for them. She's there for you emotionally 80% of the time, then 20% of the time you get thrown under the bus when you try to lean on her for support... but then if she realizes you're walling her out instead of leaning on her, she acts hurt.  It's hard for me, because she's mostly awesome, but the times when she's not hurt too much. I really want most of what she has to offer, but it's hard accepting her loving side without opening myself up to her harsh side."

My hobbies and interests aren't completely different than hers, but our BIGGEST hobbies and  interests are pretty different. She was kind of a stereotypical ""popular kid"" when younger and still values that kind of thing (fashion, sports, etc.), whereas I'm more of the nerdy sort. I was actually yelled at once for trying to interest a younger sib in one of my nerdy hobbies, with my mom asking ""Do you want her to grow up like you?"" She later tried to backpedal and say she didn't mean it that way - she meant that I'd been teased and did I want my sibling to be teased too... but... eh... yeah.  I don't think she likes me much. I wish she did. I think reducing contact would be more trouble than its worth, especially since it would mean raising tensions between my sibs and I (we're all on good terms atm.).

Honestly, I'd be tempted to never leave her alone with my kid, or lie about how much milk there is - is there a downstairs freezer or something where you can hide it?  I'm pumping too so there's milk if I'm out and kiddo is hungry - I'd be PISSED if someone was wasting my milk!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cy59e,pamplemousse2,7,Sat Jul 11 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"They do mean well and that's why I can only get but so upset.  Still, it just annoys me that in her over zealousness surrounding being a Grandma, she can't cool her jets sometimes.  When Kid was first born, for the first 8 WEEKS of his life, they were over at our house an average of 5 times a week to see the baby.  They would whine that ""We just want Kid to know us"" and ""We want to make sure he has a good relationship with us.""  Omg, he's like 5 weeks old (at the time) with the attention span of a goldfish.   Normally she watches him at their house, so I can control how much I bring.  I think what I may have to do - like /u/Extreme_Blumpkins recommended - is bring my ""extra"" just in case bags over in only 1 oz increments.  That way if it gets wasted, it's not too world ending."

If my husband had siblings with kids, I would swear that your inlaws were my inlaws. They had such a bee in their bonnet about him knowing them when he was first born.  When my son was about 2 months old we went shopping. Of course, he's looking up at me from the pram because I'm still pretty much his whole world at that point. Well, she didn't like that. She shoved her face directly into my son's line of sight and said ""Oh doesn't Grandma exist?"" Welp, she did it so suddenly that not only did it startle him, suddenly he couldn't see me at all. To say he lost his shit was an understatement. She was like ""oh sorry"" and I think she genuinely did realise her mistake since she never tried it again, but I just fucking hated her for it."
JUSTNOMIL,3cy59e,letsgetdissonant,8,Sun Jul 12 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"We're going through that right now. Kid's going through that stranger danger phase and while he's fine around my mom and siblings (I'm guessing since we all look alike), my MIL isn't being tactful about it. She pops in and out of his field of vision and gets way up in his face. She also likes to grab him away from me as soon as we walk in the door to visit, then run off to find Grandpa. Drives me nuts. Well, she pulled that last week and cue the teaaaaaars. She scared the crap out of him. I had to spend the next 30 minutes consoling BOTH of them because she had the biggest boo-boo face about how he ""hates"" her or ""doesn't know her"" and that's why he got upset. My eyes rolled so hard, they nearly fell out of my head."
JUSTNOMIL,3cy59e,letsgetdissonant,6,Sun Jul 12 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"Some people really don't get the whole ""don't get between a baby and mommy"" thing. When my grandmother first met my sister's son, she came shrieking out of the house, yanked him from my sister's arms and ran back into the house with him. Naturally my nephew was terrified by this and spent the rest of the visit avoiding her as much as he could (he was about 18 months old at the time and my sister and her husband took him to meet our grandparents who live in another state for the first time). He wouldn't go near her and would cry if she tried to pick him up after that."

The generation before us was told that formula was liberating, blah blah blah and it was a lot more common not to nurse. Maybe try explaining to her the work and time that goes into pumping. She may not realize the difference between buying more formula at the store and pumping breast milk. So she may see your instructions as suggestions, because it's not a big deal to her."

I've made it known several times we are waiting until AT LEAST 6 months and longer if I just don't think he's ready or interested yet, but my mom is the worst about this one. She's constantly telling me I need to start him on solids, not because she wants to feed him, though, but because ""it's time."" The in-laws are chomping at the bit about it, though, too."
JUSTNOMIL,3cy59e,catsarethenewblack,8,Sat Jul 11 23:34:36 2015 UTC,"Keep fighting the good fight. I'm with you.   My pediatrician recommends starting solids/purées at 6 months, but my SIL started BLW at 3 months. So I know I'm going to have to set a big boundary that this baby is different and this baby will not be eating that early. To each their own, but it isn't about what people want to do, it's about what's best for baby. And we get to make those decisions as parents. ...ugh, I hope. Haha."
JUSTNOMIL,3cy59e,sakurahorror,7,Sat Jul 11 23:55:23 2015 UTC,"I had to exclusively pump because of latching issues, and had supply issues, so I would be in tears whenever we had to dump any breast milk. My inlaws just didn't give a fuck either, like I had certain times I had to pump to keep up supply and they would demand to visit when pumping would have been due (no way was I leaving the newborn with them for 15-20 minutes to do it), or want to ""go for lunch"" or something any delay me by hours, and they didn't understand if I got upset from missing a pump, or not pumping much, or having to dump if he refused it.  The nap thing especially hits home. They would constantly say ""he's hungry, he's hungry"" whenever he was grumpy. No, he's not. He's tired. I'm not getting him any more milk, he's going to bed. Also my son refused to sleep in people's arms from about 5 weeks old, which I would tell them repeatedly but nope, they would insist on trying to rock him and act bewildered when he got more upset.  The feeding thing too... ugh, the feeding. They were determined to feed him themselves and gave me so much shit for not letting them. Well, because he's newborn and we're bonding, get off my back. Eventually I snapped at them that if I wasn't pumping they wouldn't have the option to feed him at all so shut up about it. That sort of worked.  The worst part now is that they will not leave him alone when he eats. My husband's grandparents just stare at him while he eats and comment or laugh at something he does (I hate people staring at me when I eat so I'm worried he'll get weird about it like I am). We went out for dinner (for my birthday) and my husband's uncle decided to try to play and tickle him while I'm trying to feed him. JUST LET HIM FUCKING EAT ALREADY, FUCK OFF (edit: just want to add he's almost 2 now, so yeah they still pull this shit).  Ugh, as always here I've ended up ranting too, sorry! I guess at least we know we're not alone or insane (yet)."
JUSTNOMIL,3cxrex,Honeyforthewin,17,Sat Jul 11 18:56:08 2015 UTC,She's bluffing.  She will change her tune once the holidays roll around.    I hope your husband takes a break from that relationship for awhile to teach her that she can't just say shit and then have everything be cool when she decides it is.  She needs to sincerely apologize and prove to him that she will never pull that again.

Only time I want to be texted that early is if someone died, but honestly, that deserves a call. Most of the time, it's texts about the weather there (nothing exciting.

This call tonight came through on the landline hence having to get out of the sofa and getting annoyed!
JUSTNOMIL,3ctzki,Chronoblivion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:25:20 2015 UTC,Check the settings on your landline handset - some cordless phones have a programmable option where you can set phone numbers in the memory to ring on silent (if you've got caller ID).
JUSTNOMIL,3ctzki,Glittery_Pickle,5,Sun Jul 12 13:37:26 2015 UTC,Mine just messaged me at 11pm to ask if I had heard from her son because he's not texting her back. He's working :|
JUSTNOMIL,3ctzki,WombatBeans,4,Fri Jul 10 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"Is not answering the phone an option, or will that cause more problems than it solves?"
JUSTNOMIL,3ctzki,sayaandtenshi,2,Sat Jul 11 03:42:27 2015 UTC,"I picked the phone up and hung straight back up again, I needed to get it to stop ringing for my daughter. My excuse is that our landline is fucked so she didn't get offended.  Sometimes we don't answer if it's not convenient (yey for caller id) but I still find it intrusive, I think I'm just a bit weird though about stuff like that as it is ok for her to ring once a week really."
JUSTNOMIL,3ctzki,WombatBeans,5,Sat Jul 11 06:25:09 2015 UTC,"I can sort of relate. My wife, with one or two exceptions, will drop what she's doing and answer her parents' call no matter how inconvenient it is for her. Part of her excuse is that if she doesn't, her dad will assume the worst and drive over to check on us, which is probably true, but it ties in to the bigger issue of her not knowing how to say no to her parents and set boundaries for them. In the 3.5 hours between when she gets home and when they go to bed, they typically call twice. Usually to ask how the kids are doing and then talk about something extremely mundane. And she spends at least 20 hours at their house in a typical week, so it's not like there isn't plenty of time to discuss how they want to rearrange their furniture or the neighbor's new car or whatever. At least the calls are typically under 5 minutes, but the frequent interruptions for useless reasons wear on me."
JUSTNOMIL,3ctzki,sayaandtenshi,2,Sat Jul 11 07:35:49 2015 UTC,"That would make me super cross! I'm close to my parents, see them most days and usually text/email my mum if stuff comes up, however they know that when my husband is home then generally we like to be left alone.   We sometimes spend an evening with them or see them on a weekend but not often.   I think it's helped that I've vented to them about my mil 'invading' our time so it's a simple way to get an idea across without being too aggressive about it, now if only we could do the same for mil without her getting all overly apologetic and blaming herself for everything!"
JUSTNOMIL,3ctzki,Ashley777,3,Sat Jul 11 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Years ago, I used to take an old fashion phone off the hook and disconnect the cord from the handset to prevent my MIL from doing just that. Cell phone... Hit ignore on hubby's phone. Sorry lady next time I'll just moan like a whore in the background if hubby does decide to pick up your call at the wrong times."
JUSTNOMIL,3ctzki,catsarethenewblack,2,Sat Jul 11 13:46:04 2015 UTC,Generally husband is pretty good at ignoring her calls if it's too inconvenient but she gets all overly apologetic when she next speaks to him and the missed calls get mentioned and he explains that we were in the middle of something/out and about. So sometimes it's weighing up what's more annoying - having a quick chat at a slightly inconvenient time or listening to the apologies on the next call.
JUSTNOMIL,3ctbfm,imoutofthrowaways,19,Fri Jul 10 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"I was told at age 18 I would find it really difficult to have children, and there was a strong chance of infertility. Not looking forward to that conversation, not that it's a conversation that in laws should ever be a part of, but we live in this universe and not the next one over where MIL's respect boundaries. Oh well!  To answer your OP, yes I did see that earlier. I am so grateful to humanity that this dude is sticking up for his wife, but he should have stepped in when the nagging started, not when it ended in this. What a disgusting piece of shit to make someone feel guilty for something they have literally no control over.  Why do so many women view other women as walking incubators? Surely they would know what kind of social pressure bullshit a young of-fertile-age woman with no kids feels?"
JUSTNOMIL,3ctbfm,Someoneier,7,Fri Jul 10 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   When I found out my one of my sisters was having issues, I had NO idea until other sister told me. (Didn't know she'd had miscarriages or anything.) I felt like absolute shit that I had gotten pregnant and didn't want to tell her. Unfortunately, my mom doesn't understand how that might be tough for sister and was like ""OH, SHE'S PREGNANT AND YOU AREN'T!"" more or less.  (We were all like...jesus, really?)   After I found out, I saw sister had been blogging about things and saying how you need to tread lightly when it comes to family planning and how it was like a one two punch to the gut to be asked why she wasn't pregnant yet when she'd JUST had a miscarriage a few weeks before."
JUSTNOMIL,3ctbfm,Subclavian,2,Fri Jul 10 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your sister :( I'm sure she's really happy for your pregnancy even if she's been having so much trouble. Congratulations on your pregnancy by the way :)  It is like a punch in the gut and I hate how our Western society (not sure about others?) puts so much onus on having children as soon as they get to a certain age or get married. I don't fancy fertility treatments at all and I'm not even sure biological children is something I want to risk as I'm extremely prone to massive depressive episodes, which is not something I want to experience during pregnancy/birth/as a parent or something I want to pass on to my child. I think the hormones/process will wreck me. I'm thinking fostering and adoption more that natural birth, and that's something I don't feel comfortable talking about to anyone except my SO (and internet strangers of course!).  The other day my MIL was pointing out the babies in the crowd at this event we were at. It was hella annoying, I'm sure it was innocuous but I'm never going to give her any information about my sex life if she asks about children and my partner isn't either."

I just had wanted to tell her in a way that would be considerate to HER. Mom ruined that...but meh. Grr.   I was annoyed because the minute we were married, people were badgering us about kids. When I had DD, people were asking when we were having more! (I was like: Calm. Down.) Insane.   I think adoption would be a good thing, especially if you're worried about passing things on or being wrecked by it. I know my sister will adopt if it comes down to it!   My MIL just has been passive aggressive about babies...not just to me, but BIL's wife as well. She talked about it before like she was expecting it, then when either of us were actually pregnant her tune changed totally. So bizarre.

Her MIL didn't belittle her or say that they needed to divorce, but her MIL doesn't understand why it's difficult and how it can't be ""fixed"" easily. She pretty much thinks that painful periods are not an ""issue"" and that SHE had them and was able to have 6 kids no problem. Yeah? So? I had real bad ones, no endo, but I was able to get pregnant/maintain and have kid(to be s soon). So it's like...way to be an insensitive bitch.   I was telling DH about that post, and I mentioned that I was glad his mom isn't THAT bad. However, I did point out that she's said some fucked up stuff. (Tl;Dr: When DH got a DUI back in college because he was dumb, MIL basically said to me that she expected something like that from ME, that I should have covered for him when the cops showed up, and that I should have told him to pull over somewhere and that I'd come get him. A. No. B. I worked for the PD at the time and had I said I was driving, I would have lost my job and god knows what legal shit. Unlike DH, I don't have a rich momma to pay for a good lawyer. So.

But I always blew bubbles for him when I went over there, so for the longest time he called me ""Bubbles"". Which we did manage to train him out of because, well, Bubbles sort of sounds like a stripper name. But I was Bubbles for like a year.

I grew up only calling mine (both sets) Grandma and Grandpa so I figure I'll end up referring to the in-laws by this on a regular basis.

Girlfriend has specifically arranged this dinner because the bride (her sister) was so busy, they had hardly seen each other coming up to the wedding, and Girlfriend wanted a few free hours to spend with her sister. 2. The girlfriend was not only making the Bride's dress, she made 160 cupcakes in my sister's tiny kitchen over many many hours, and hand decorated them all for the Wedding Cake/Cupcake tower. 3. Girlfriend's mom had been continuously bitching at Girlfriend for not using the left over dress fabric to decorate the flower, when the Bride wanted the fabric to be used as a bolero.  Girlfriend doesn't spend much time with her mother."

I mean, she was still annoying (""it's not a real wedding unless it's in a church"" and ""what do you mean you aren't providing transportation for my 30 family members?"" were common themes)."
JUSTNOMIL,3cql15,Syrinx221,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:56:20 2015 UTC,"Mine got mad at me for not inviting her 2nd cousins that neither of us had met. When I said if she wanted to pay for them, fine, otherwise no...that mostly shut her up. It was so ridiculous. She was like ""But you are inviting your great-aunt/uncles and 2nd cousins!""  Yeah, and unlike her 2nd cousins, I actually have a relationship with my great aunts/uncles and their kids."
JUSTNOMIL,3cql15,nervousnell89,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:10:30 2015 UTC,Right!!! She questioned my mom about inviting my first cousins (one in particular who I am very close to).  Apparently that means that my husband's second cousin who lives 500 miles away and whom I've never met needs to be invited. What?! I don't know her. Why would a) I want someone I don't know there and b) she want to come to a shower for someone she's never met?!
JUSTNOMIL,3cql15,nervousnell89,2,Sat Jul 11 01:12:46 2015 UTC,"My husband has a very small family. We invited all of them. Only his mother, sister, and brother came. It was a 14 hour car ride.   After the wedding, my MIL had the gall to say to me that after  her sister's saw the photos that they were upset that they didn't come. They didn't know it was ""going to be such a big deal.""   BITCH, PLEASE?! I'm 34, never married, no kids. He is 27, never married, no kids. We are both professionals who paid for the whole damn deal on our own. Of course it was going to be a big deal. Did you expect something trashy?   My MIL never once in the 6 months of planning asked me anything about the wedding plans. NOTHING. AT ALL.   I want to strangle the whole lot of them. We are supposed to fly out there in a few weeks for a visit. They want to throw me a shower...ummm, like, how the hell am I supposed to get any baby swag home? It better fit in a suitcase."

At this point I think he needs to make a decision on whether or not he is willing to put up with this kind of treatment from her. Especially since it is his mother, I am not sure if there is anything that you can say to her. That might make her treat both of you worse."
JUSTNOMIL,3coqw4,MissMamanda,14,Thu Jul 9 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"I personally feel she needs therapy, she has bluntly told me she doesn't like me and I still continue to be civil with her. She lives 5 mins away and isn't happy unless she is included in all our family activities. I have cut out family vacations and trips since she insisted she go or guilt trip is into inviting her.   I have told my SO that this isn't a healthy relationship and she shouldn't be guilt tripping anyone into do something.   She just aways seems to have a problem with something, kids dirty feet, clothes, them having a bed time ect; I feel there's is no pleasing her unless she gets her way"

Last year, they decided they were going to take me out (it was several weeks after my birthday) and I happened to get some really bad news that same day. I asked my husband to please let them know that I wouldn't be able to make it for dinner. My husband got guilt trip calls from both his mother and his older brother about it. I was not physically or emotionally capable of going out to dinner and besides that, if it's for my birthday, shouldn't I have some say in it?  When we did eventually get together a couple of weeks after that, they chose the restaurant. I didn't get a say in that either."

After he gets off the phone he goes ""she said they'll take you shopping when they get back?""  WTF? I don't want to go shopping. I'll be 31 weeks pregnant by then and traipsing around shopping centres is already high on my list of fucking things I don't want to do. Also it'll be clothes shopping that they mean. Now, I don't need any more maternity wear since we're unlikely to have another baby after this, and after my first kid my weight was bit all over the place for the first year. I explicitly told her at that time I didn't want clothes, and she went and bought me size 10 jeans that Christmas (3 months after I'd had a baby by emergency c-section - yeah, right jeans is just what I need).

JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,BadgerTwo,11,Thu Jul 9 13:22:00 2015 UTC,She's only had sex four times in her life? I beat that on my wedding night.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,yearofthecat,5,Thu Jul 9 13:52:55 2015 UTC,Right??
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,yearofthecat,7,Thu Jul 9 19:38:55 2015 UTC,I'm so glad your husband is supportive of you in all of this. I saw in another comment that you were planning on leaving the state? I'm not sure whether it would be better to tell her or keep it from her. Either way she's going to have a complete meltdown! Jesus I've never read anything quite like this in this sub.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,fivemessymonsters,7,Thu Jul 9 21:07:43 2015 UTC,Videotape her. Show it to her doctor. Ask for a referral to a social worker.   Or just leave and don't look back. But she clearly has issues and probably should be in some sort of care situation. Probably a group adult family home.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,NoFriendsWithSalad,5,Thu Jul 9 05:05:43 2015 UTC,"I know it's a long shot but if you're near Portland, Oregon I'll be your friend.!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,LadyDaemon,10,Fri Jul 10 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wish!  I'm in Southern California.  Does it rain in Portland?  Gosh, I miss rain."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,WombatBeans,11,Thu Jul 9 03:59:18 2015 UTC,Hey I'm in LA!! I'm currently 26 weeks and have a small group of new moms and preggos that I hang with - PM if you need a buddy!
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,LoonyLovegood934,11,Thu Jul 9 04:25:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm in LA too!  That would be so nice!    I feel like I've officially eaten humble pie - I'm begging for friends on the internet.  Honestly, I never thought it would come to this, hahha."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,SGB_Mom,5,Thu Jul 9 07:58:08 2015 UTC,Just PM-ed you!!
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,SGB_Mom,7,Thu Jul 9 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"There's rain but mostly just cloudy all the time. Right now we're in the three months of sunshine phase and then in September back to clouds.  I feel your pain, the last time I was in LA it was February and it was very warm. I was uncomfortable."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,catfish491,7,Thu Jul 9 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"Los Angeles, by any chance?  I have 4 month old twins, but we manage to get out of the house.  Girl friends are a necessity!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,megsandbaby,9,Thu Jul 9 04:29:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am in LA!  Twins are wonderful.  I have twin brothers back home in Aus.  Granted, they're about 27 years past four months, but twin bond is something special.  And twin fights are something to behold.  I imagine you won't have that problem though, you've got girls, and I can't see them chasing each other through the house with cricket bats and BB Guns."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,flyinthesoup,6,Thu Jul 9 14:19:41 2015 UTC,"I'm on the Westside if you'd ever like to get together, just let me know.  We (the twins, mothers helper, and I) usually go out to lunch on Fridays so you'd be welcome to join us.  Or to just come over and hang out some of you like.  I've been an expat myself, so I get how hard it is.  PM me if you're interested, I promise I won't murder you.  I've actually got a boy and a girl so we will see what kind of weapons they wield against each other as they get bigger."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,Lunulae,3,Thu Jul 9 16:30:38 2015 UTC,I grew up in Torrance! I don't live there now though :(

You might be able to create some Internet bonds that could end up in a meet up :) I'm on Australia otherwise I could be your face to face buddy! Your welcome here for sure! Share your crazies with us!
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,MommyDearest30,2,Thu Jul 9 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"The sub babybumps was mentioned, as well as beyondthebump. They  / we also have an IRC channel, and you are very welcome to come hang out in it."

JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,epiceyeroll,2,Thu Jul 9 12:12:24 2015 UTC,Please come to Ohio if you miss rain! 1) I'll be your friend and 2) It rained 19 days straight here before we got a 2 day break for the 4th of July weekend. It's back to raining.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,Goodlittlewitch,4,Thu Jul 9 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"If your husband is still in the Marines, he can beg to be stationed in Virginia Beach. Still has a beach, good seafood and nice places to vacation, all in driving distance. It definitely rains there. And as an added plus, you'll have an entire country in between you and bat shit crazy."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,TigermanHeroMiaoMiao,8,Thu Jul 9 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"Oh he was there for a few years when he was with FAST.  He loved Virginia Beach, always wanted to go back.  But he's enlisting in the AirForce now, hoping to go to CCT tryouts in the new year.  The man hears the call of duty, he does."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,gwenami,3,Thu Jul 9 15:22:15 2015 UTC,Oh I understand. My husband was a corpsman and is now National Guard. Your husband is smart to go Air Force. The Army blows.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,__sesame__,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"Damn, I spent 4 years as a Marine, then joined the AF and became a CCT for 16 years until I retired.  Best and funnest time of my life, he's going to have a blast."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,brmoraisinsdelight,8,Thu Jul 9 17:56:43 2015 UTC,Oh god you poor thing. You win. She is the worst MIL ever. Come back to Australia! Surely putting the entire Pacific Ocean between you is the only true solution.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,Little_birds_mommy,7,Mon Jul 13 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"Damn. From one immigrant wife to another, I feel you. It's harsh when all your friends and family are far away, specially when you need emotional support from someone not crazy. I got freaking lucky, my MiL is the best thing ever, she has helped me (us) so much. I think if I were in your shoes I would have considered moving back to my country, and take my husband with me.   I wish you the best, to your husband and child."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,ohfluffit,3,Thu Jul 9 06:02:32 2015 UTC,"I'm an immigrant wife too.... In alnost the exact position as OP (My MIL isnt nearly as fucking nuts as hers though) We need our own subreddit! It can be so lonely, it would be nice to have other people to comiserate with about your heart being in two places."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,cardinal29,9,Thu Jul 9 08:09:48 2015 UTC,"I feel really sorry for her. I mean, she's totally nuts, and holy hell, you and your husband are saints for dealing with it as calmly as you do, and I absolutely feel for you guys. But she only had sex four times, never figured out it was something people actually enjoy (and probably thinks all the things saying women do are elaborate lies), wrapped her entire life up in her son, and now he got you pregnant so she assumes you will go off with the baby like she did, and she gets to keep her son. What a freaking shock for her that it's not working out like that. All the things she maybe caught a glimpse of on tv or read about but figured were just entertaining stories/lies are happening around her, and she has no idea how to deal with any of it. What a nasty shock.   I'm so glad she's in therapy. If you can, you might want to see if you can help her go more often. Does she have friends who can make sure she keeps going after you move away? Eeg. Good luck. I hope you and Tony make it out of there with a minimal amount of crazy from her."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,WombatBeans,3,Thu Jul 9 14:16:04 2015 UTC,"Oh. My. God. I don't even.... I have no words. ""Show me these apartments"" lol- I love how nonchalant your husband is!!!  She reminds me of the mom in ""Psycho""- well, I mean if the son wasn't just imagining it...."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,SillyJane,3,Thu Jul 9 03:45:03 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry but I laughed so hard at this. How could you possibly want to have sex with her son? It's not like your young and in love or anything. But seriously I think you should probably consider family counselling as well as some serious therapy for this women. That's not normal or healthy. Also probably no unsupervised time with the baby. Good luck.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,hspankow,3,Thu Jul 9 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"""The dog and I are sitting on my bed, shocked and unsure of what to do.""  I'm sorry, that sentence just made me laugh aloud.  Give your poor dog a hug for me.  I hope the dog gets to go to your new home!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,flappybunny19,2,Thu Jul 9 13:53:57 2015 UTC,"You need to read the book ""Little Earthquakes"" you will get a kick out of it  I wish I was close to you so I could be your friend. I'm sorry you're so alone."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,cookies_cat,2,Fri Jul 10 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"You have moved? You're not still living with her, right?"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,ninjajandal,2,Thu Jul 9 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"Holy fucking shit, you sadly win the JUSTNOMIL jackpot.   Please move out of that woman's house as fast as you can."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,ninjajandal,2,Thu Jul 9 04:53:48 2015 UTC,Wow.... imagine your child having to witness that kind of behavior and thinking that it's normal.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,SkittlzAnKomboz,2,Thu Jul 9 08:50:37 2015 UTC,"""so show me these apartments""  You've got a keeper there, even if he comes with a bit of baggage!!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,cordsniper,2,Thu Jul 9 10:21:11 2015 UTC,"Oh holy crap. Go watch Grey Gardens. It sounds like your MIL ... I don't know, she sounds like crazy Little Edie. Also, tell her to stop touching you. Anyway, if you're in NYC, I can advise you on neighborhoods. Get out of there now!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,kaelta,2,Thu Jul 9 11:51:44 2015 UTC,"You had the sex after that didn't you?  You both handled that meltdown very well and if my husband handled that that well there'd be some naked time after.  I mean...holy god.  Btw, don't think she's substituting him for a husband.  Know it.    Honestly, I don't want to belittle this situation with jokes.  It seriously sounds like she needs honest to god mental help. I hope your husband or someone can help her with that."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,hesback_inpogform,2,Thu Jul 9 13:06:46 2015 UTC,"Holy Shit!  This reminds me of the crazy mom from ""Carrie."""
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,PostsWithFury,2,Thu Jul 9 14:59:15 2015 UTC,"Run, run away and never look back!! I wouldn't even let this person have your new address, holy balls.   Have y'all considered moving to Australia? (You moving back)  I feel like I would want a 14 hours (?) flight between me and someone that unhinged.    You're already being punished for ""taking her baby away"" so you may as well do that shit right. An apartment 10 minutes away? No, no, you can do much better than that. ;)"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmntv,reneykins,2,Thu Jul 9 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry you having this crazy lady in you life. I think writing down more incidents like this will help you. Also, you have a real knack for writing, so if you want to write a book in the next 10 weeks... :)"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmnzt,DoxieMonstre,7,Thu Jul 9 02:28:07 2015 UTC,"Your husband sounds very reasonable. Calling the cop was the right thing to do. If you're concerned about your safety, maybe call the police to watch you as well. The safety of you and your family is the most important thing. Hope you are doing ok!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmnzt,catsarethenewblack,6,Thu Jul 9 12:09:32 2015 UTC,"He is far and away the most reasonable person in his family, which is why they always call him with this crap. On the bright side, scumbag boyfriend ALSO knows that, so we're dead last on the list of people he wants to fuck with because of it. He doesn't want to deal with the police.   The rest of the night after the post went by uneventfully. Just need to get through  today and then we leave town for vacation for a week. :)"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmnzt,l-x,6,Thu Jul 9 12:46:39 2015 UTC,"Good to know that your tiny, 11 pound self has my back buddy.   ha! amazing. this stuff IS really nerve wracking, but it's good you still have a sense of humor about it. hopefully it's all empty threats and will blow over soon enough.  good ol' crazy family drama!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmnzt,l-x,4,Thu Jul 9 13:26:19 2015 UTC,It almost always is empty threats with these people. And his mother called this morning to tell us that apparently everything is fine so idk.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmnzt,mhende,3,Thu Jul 9 13:42:30 2015 UTC,"yeah, it sounds a LOT like drama for the sake of drama. but i agree with DH - take that shit seriously. glad everything seems to have worked out ok!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,MommyDearest30,25,Thu Jul 9 02:52:53 2015 UTC,"I would totally take her shopping, agree with all the stuff she picks out and then when we get to the counter to pay, say ""I'm going to the food court, meet me there when you get done paying for everything."" And just walk away."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,Ashley777,6,Thu Jul 9 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, this is hilarious!!!!!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,l-x,13,Thu Jul 9 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"i mean, asking someone to take you shopping sounds like something a teenager would request. if she has 20k to drop on a car, why the fuck is she demanding anyone ""take her shopping""?  when i first read that i was like, ""oh, she wants to go shopping with you,"" like, you each spend your own money on your own shit. or just wander around looking at stuff.  NOT that she's going to spend YOUR money on HER. the ... fuck?  y'all gotta be real careful about nipping this shit in the bud fast. taking her shopping, indulging in her rude as hell wish lists - all of it is a recipe for financial disaster.  use the wish lists as a nice hint for holidays and appropriate events, assuming the items are cost-appropriate for your budget. extravagant gifts are never appropriate unless you and dh are feeling generous (not because someone asks). birthday's, mother's day, seasonal gift-giving holidays, etc. but not whenever the fuck she wants, or when she feels she's not sufficiently the center of attention."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,l-x,8,Thu Jul 9 13:29:25 2015 UTC,Oh! It made it even funnier when she told me she had bought some stuff on her list and she said she updated it- she left everything $80+ on her list. So she left the expensive stuff for everyone to buy.... she's a weird bird
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,JacOfAllTrades,9,Thu Jul 9 14:39:15 2015 UTC,Weird is generous. Entitled asshole is more accurate!
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,fruitjerky,4,Thu Jul 9 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"""Oh, those are nice things, I'll hint to your hubby that you want these.""  Validate her taste, then disarm her request.   Edit: Can you get her husband's email so you can forward him the ridiculousness?"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,Ilovegoku11,9,Thu Jul 16 17:55:36 2015 UTC,I feel like if I had your MIL my face would be permanently set to.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,catsarethenewblack,5,Thu Jul 9 04:48:04 2015 UTC,"Yes but yummy to that man right there, face expression and all ;)"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,beearghcee,10,Thu Jul 9 05:23:42 2015 UTC,"You are not over-reacting. Her selfish and attention seeking behavior is just.. I don't even have the right words to describe it. Her false sense of entitlement is so ridiclous, that it is genuinely laughable. My FMIL is just like this and you know what I do? Distance myself from it and laugh at her dramatic antics. It's the best way to handle it and when you think of the sheer absurdity of some of their actions, it's downright hilarous. Maybe ditch her house warming party because pregnancy sucks? lol"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,MissMamanda,10,Thu Jul 9 04:07:51 2015 UTC,Lol that's what I'm thinking... I have a pic of her in the background of my baby shower with the worst and meanest face lol... It makes me giggle looking at it
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,apotero,4,Thu Jul 9 05:22:58 2015 UTC,MIL sounds very jealous of your lifestyle. I can never understand why a mother would not be proud of their children for doing well.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,cardinal29,4,Thu Jul 9 12:22:41 2015 UTC,"And that's the problem, we aren't even doing ""well"". My SO told me her new husband started a new position at work making more, she has a good job- I'm not sure why she thinks we're made of money. He's in rehab- that alone takes a big chunk of our income"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmr0h,IncredibleBulk2,3,Thu Jul 9 14:37:40 2015 UTC,Is she a toddler? She sounds like a child when they learn they are getting a new sibling? Petty and jealous.
JUSTNOMIL,3cmbtv,catnamedbear,13,Thu Jul 9 00:49:42 2015 UTC,"Bwahahaha, that is too funny."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmbtv,pamplemousse2,11,Thu Jul 9 01:15:06 2015 UTC,"I get you. My MIL always hugs me and tells me she loves me. She tells me she loves me more often than I tell my husband I love him, and I'm just like ""Awkward ellipses!"" And I am soooo not a hugger.    I think it's funny that, because of her usual treatment of you, you can laugh at her accidentally calling you lazy, while so many other people would be like ""My bitch MIL called me lazy on Facebook!"" xD"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmbtv,fruitjerky,7,Thu Jul 9 01:17:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, whenever she tells me she loves me, I'm like, ""..Thaaaaanks"" She also called me yucky!"

JUSTNOMIL,3cmbtv,ohfluffit,3,Thu Jul 9 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"I love this! Everything about it, including the trend/laziness of not shaving armpits. :)"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmbtv,ohfluffit,6,Thu Jul 9 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"Apparently she hasn't noticed they're not shaved, so I feel pretty validated :p"
JUSTNOMIL,3cmbtv,faiora,3,Thu Jul 9 02:22:46 2015 UTC,"First, love your comment to the article.  Next, yeah that is creepy.  I thought I had it bad with mine introducing me as ""my DIL but really she's my daughter"".  Like ""um, back off, lady.  i have 2 living parents who i love.""  The sentiment in both cases is nice, but...just off.  How would you doing it back go?  I'd probably have to make a game of it.  Like how I make a game of incest jokes when she calls me her daughter."
JUSTNOMIL,3cmbtv,IncredibleBulk2,3,Thu Jul 9 13:34:08 2015 UTC,"She calls me her daughter, too, and posts those cheesy Facebook pictures about how wonderful daughters are. The creepiest thing is, she HAS a daughter already!   I was going to be indignant and say, ""Take your judgement elsewhere,"" because she really shouldn't be talking. She's the nastiest person I've ever met, hygiene-wise. Instead, I just pointed out that she should probably re-read what I said. She never replied."

Full disclosure: I do actually shave them when I go swimming or wear a tank top, but only if the hair has gotten really long.   I mean, seriously, shaving is such a load of unnecessary work. And the razor bumps are uglier than the hair, anyway."
JUSTNOMIL,3clvqs,ohfluffit,19,Wed Jul 8 22:41:40 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, yes! Way to use midnight sausage in a sentence!  So, you are totally right that she just had way too much time on her hands, but it's a shame she's driving you crazy while she figures out what the heck to do with herself. Does she have any other hobbies? What about knitting or crochet or quilting or something? Bird watching? Is she at all interested in physical stuff like aquafit?"
JUSTNOMIL,3clvqs,pamplemousse2,5,Wed Jul 8 23:04:25 2015 UTC,"Funny enough, she is doing aquafit.  But at home so she's not getting out and actually seeing people.  I mean, if I had to be with FIL all day I'd go insane too, but I didn't marry him, ya know?  I asked her about knitting and she said that's for ""old people"".  I keep trying and she keeps shutting me down.  Maybe I'll tell her about ceramics or something as I used to make those."
JUSTNOMIL,3clvqs,cardinal29,6,Thu Jul 9 12:00:51 2015 UTC,"You need to clue her in on the ""hipsters knitting"" trend.

JUSTNOMIL,3clvqs,l-x,12,Thu Jul 9 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"how can I busy this woman so I can feel like a functioning person again?    manage her. schedule time for you guys to do stuff together - it also sounds like she's weirdly fixated on you. ask her out under the pretense of needing something, and then sneakily take her out to lunch, or wander around the mall for an hour. something YOU find tolerable but will also appeal to her. but have a standing - consistent - date with her to go out and do something. if she enthusiastically tries to tack on other stuff, just gently remind her about your standing date and say, ""oh cool, let's talk about that on saturday,"" or whatever. or, ""hey, why don't we do that on saturday instead of the mall?"" yes, a trip to the fucking office depot can be one of those things. you're going to subtly get her in the habit of doing all of that stuff at one designated time instead of constantly.   she just retired. she's still getting her sea legs. the hobbies will come. her friends are probably still working or otherwise consumed with their own stuff and don't have time to hang out with her, so she's bored and lonely and probably a little bit scared of rattling around with her own thoughts for too long. because retirement is just one little step closer to death, when you pause for any length of time and think about it.   you can also use your standing date to see how she's doing and what she's interested in. it will give you both a chance to bond more as peers - wives who are family - instead of the mother / child or wife / husband dynamic currently in place."
JUSTNOMIL,3clvqs,TheEthalea,3,Thu Jul 9 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"Totally this, she sounds like she's a bit lost after retiring.   My mom retired a year ago and she is still trying to get her sea legs under her and figure out hobbies and stuff to do in her own.   The biggest problem is my dad built a house out in the countryside. Which would be lovely but everything my mom wants to get involved in is in the city, a 30-40 min drive. And it's just plain annoying having to drive every time you want to look at something that isn't Walmart."

I like the suggestion of the standing date, but at the same time I'm dealing with my own mom's crazy as she's jealous of the fact that we live here and she's 4.5 hours away.  Where we live is hella expensive and my parents can't afford to live nearby.  The other problem is I barely have time to myself.  When I get spare time, I'd like to actually hang out with my own friends.  In all honesty, I want to see ILs a max of once every two weeks.  I know MIL plays candy crush and words with friends a lot.  I always hear about how my mom is always beating her.  I mean...maybe read a book and beef up the vocab, MIL??  H only just told me last night that she's calling him like 6 times a day.  He's been trying to give her suggestions/projects but unless it's directly related to us or the dog, she has no interest."

It would give her something to do, but not commit her to owning a dog since she plans to travel. ;)  Tell her how wonderful she is with your dog and you just know she'd be such a help to a rescue group.

JUSTNOMIL,3clvqs,KHeaney,5,Thu Jul 9 12:02:11 2015 UTC,"I get really defensive about our inbred purebred   FYI there are lots of breed specific rescues out there, so if MIL really likes a specific breed of dog, there might be a _____ rescue in your area that could use her help.  I hope she'll go for the fostering idea.    And there's nothing wrong with purebred dogs as long as you (generic you, not directed at OP) don't buy them from a petstore/puppymill/backyard breeder.  There are good breeders out there that take their responsibilities very seriously.  There are also breed specific rescues (and sometimes they even have puppies available).  And on www.petfinder.com  you can even search by breed."
JUSTNOMIL,3clvqs,GoroTheBastard,5,Thu Jul 9 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah ours is a total puppy mill puppy- collapsed larynx, bad knees.  Whole 9.  Her prior owned even broke her little leg.  At 4 months in a cast she was 1.5 lbs.  We took her in 3 months later when we heard she was living in a crate.  I know there are good breeders, but, given how many awesome mixes/strays/etc are put to death in pounds, I just can't do it.    I checked out PetFinder and sent the husband a list of possible dogs ranging from puppies to 6 years.  He wants the same breed and I'm trying to talk him into similar size because that will be easier to find.  It makes sense because our dog actually likes larger dogs so a dog maybe 15 lbs would be great.  Keep your fingers crossed!!!"
JUSTNOMIL,3clvqs,prettywannapancake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"This is such a good idea!  Gives her an outlet for energy, something to be proud of, and is good for society as a whole.

Tribute to /u/Gorothebastard.  Anyway, try the VeryOwnPuppy TM again? Offer to look after it when she goes on trips? Other than that, maybe give her long term projects to work on, so then atleast she's only annoying you about one thing? ""Oh I would love a home-made blanket/toaster-knife/lazer-mech. It would mean so much from you.""   I mean, she'll call you constantly to ask if you want a ruby or diamond based lazer, but it might distract her in the mean time."

I would love to have a buddy for our dog, but I feel bad enough having ours in an apartment.  Having a dog over only periodically would be ideal!  We could even get one similar is size to ours from a rescue.  I'm honestly not sure why that hadn't occurred to me.  (just texted hub and he loves the idea)  I would super like to get her into knitting.  I mean, I have nothing to do with my grandmother, but it's still special to me that I have a blanket she knit for me when I was little and would love to have someone in our family to be able to do the same."

My SIL who only worked p/t and now is unemployed due to anxiety issues (whole nother story) used to always say, ""Oh, poor Pancake!"" every time I went to, or came home from work. I'm like, it's just my fucking job! Most people have one! It's not that hard!   Also, DH's whole family is sooooo super emotionally sensitive, I have had major issues with them treating me with kid gloves as if I'm going to have a full on breakdown because I think they looked at me funny, or offered to help with dinner. ""I just want you to know, it's not that I don't think you're capable, I just want to help and give you options and make sure that everyone is happy!"" and when I turn down the help because, honestly, I don't need any and I'm happier not being overwhelmed in my own kitchen, then there's tears because I must be mad at them."

If they deny anything, well, you have it on video. Play the ""I'm pregnant and we'd appreciate your understanding on these issues as I'm putting my pregnancy first"" card!

There was no talk about this when we actually saw them.  So I work a 9/80 so I'm off Friday. Which kinda opens up the ""oh you're home? Let's go to lunch and doing other stupid shit.""

The family went out, but my grandfather stayed behind in case I needed anything. Lying in my bed, I could hear my grandfather systematically going through every drawer in the house. On the day they were leaving, my grandfather was rummaging through the drawers in my mom's china hutch, and my grandmom is like, ""Jim! What are you doing?!?"" And my grandfather answers her, ""I'm going through these drawers, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU!"" like my grandmother is being an unreasonable asshole. We found out later that he filled our bird feeder with grass seed and watered down our syrup.  Anyway, someday your child will have fun stories like these.

You're also in need of a backbone.  :) It's OK to tell them, ""No, you can't stay here.""  It is not OK for anyone to invite themselves to stay with you!  Your DH should be the one the tell them no, but if he can't/won't you're certainly within your rights to do so.  Let them know now that any future visits they will have to stay elsewhere.  Period.  You don't have to explain or justify why, especially since any reason you give they'll argue about and think if they can only get around that objection, then they can invade your house after all.

Or, maybe buying it on Amazon as a gift and having it shipped directly to her home anonymously?   Is she American? Other cultures aren't as um, attached to the idea of a seat. My sister told me that in the two years that she lived in Spain that very few public toilets had seats, but most home toilets did. Maybe this is a cultural thing?"
JUSTNOMIL,3cll9h,rbnthrowaway13,2,Wed Jul 8 23:22:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've traveled and know that lots of times toilet seats are few and far between in certain public areas.

JUSTNOMIL,3cll9h,faiora,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:46:18 2015 UTC,How has no one said anything to her before? Doesn't she have friends?
JUSTNOMIL,3cll9h,faiora,0,Fri Jul 10 11:38:41 2015 UTC,"so naturally I assumed that if she was moving she'd be moving up, not sideways   I actually have no idea what you meant by this. There are lots of reasons people move, and even if there was an assumption I would make, I don't know what kind of assumption it is you made.   I also don't know why you expected anything to change. If someone lives in a house full of ""rat piss and droppings"" it isn't something that's just tied to the house; it's tied to the way they live. A clean person in that exact same house would have food stored away properly and the rats would lose interest, for example. I lived in a rental suite for a few years that had a major ant problem when I arrived, and within weeks it cleared up completely on its own, just because we vacuumed and stored food in plastic containers (depriving them of a food source). Rats are a bit tougher to tackle than mice or ants, but it's not generally difficult to discourage them, or to keep items in a house clean. Clearly your MIL doesn't keep a tidy house, and that's not something that's likely to change by moving. Even if she'd moved into a different neighbourhood, she probably would have encouraged a pest problem after some time.  I have no idea how any of this makes her a bad or difficult person. Buy her a toilet seat, or bring your own to use when you visit, is all I've really got left to say."
JUSTNOMIL,3cll9h,puppibreath,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:42:08 2015 UTC,"I mean that her old house was a rental in a terrible neighborhood. Countless conversations she explained it was a temporary situation, she'd be moving soon so she wasn't going to bother to fix up her rental because her new house would be nice. She ended up moving a few blocks away, to a bigger house that she now owns but in the same crappy neighborhood. Based on past conversations I assumed she was moving to a newer area.   This particular thing doesn't make her a difficult person, other things about her make her difficult. I just shared this story because I have no one else to express myself to and this kind of thing is hard for my husband to deal with because that's his mom, and he is the baby of the family. I found it to be a light anecdote that I wanted to share.  I'm not sure she even knew she had a rat problem to be honest, her house was always clean when I went over there so finding that in our clothes was, as I mentioned, both sad and angering. Sad because I knew she wasn't aware and angering because I don't have the luxury of a washer or dryer so rewashing our entire wardrobe was a daunting task, there are no laundry mats where we live).   But yes, the only way she will get a toilet seat is if I get one for her, which I plan on doing."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,baby_purple,33,Wed Jul 8 14:35:29 2015 UTC,"I would love to cut my MIL off. But I won't, because my husband does love her and she's not a bad person.  Just extremely overbearing, no social graces, and no common sense.  My husband does his best to shut her down when she starts in on our family.  I take most of the ""cut her off"" comments or ""your husband needs to get it together"" as support/encouragement.   I don't think it's meant as tried and true advice.  I agree with you that we should be treating each other with respect in this sub.  But I don't agree with the concept that ""that's just how she is, so we shouldn't care about it.""  Common MIL behavior or not, let's still call them out!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,ProfessorMMcGonagall,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:29:44 2015 UTC,"Calling them out and setting boundaries is fine. I have most certainly had to do it with my MIL, and I'm sure it will be an ongoing struggle in our relationship. I just think there are ways to do that that don't involve being as cruel as completely cutting them off."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,cardinal29,54,Wed Jul 8 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with almost all of your post.  But I see two things going on in this sub that are really important, and for those reasons, I am perfectly willing to forgive the hyperbole.  EDUCATION:  There are a lot of people on this sub who are in their 20's and don't really have the life experience under their belt to deal with crazy.  If you were raised in a normal, supportive family with healthy and respectful boundaries, this kind of behavior is baffling.  I have read a number of posts with descriptions of narcissist MILs, and it feels amazing to finally put a name to the behavior that is making your family miserable.  These poor wives can't put a finger on what is wrong.  They don't have the right words, only their feelings that MIL is a trial who brings chaos and discord.  They may not know about boundaries because they've never had anyone in their lives be so rude and oblivious.  A young bride or mother may question herself, and we are here to let her know that her gut feelings are legitimate.  SUPPORT:  If you're stuck at home with a baby and a MIA inconsiderate husband, /r/JustNoMIL is a great place to feel validated.  Yes, we're cranky and hostile.  Yes, some of the suggestions are drastic.  But nobody's running out and getting divorced because /r/JustNoMIL said so. When you are really pissed at DH, there is nothing more cathartic than to hear of chorus of women agreeing with you that he is, indeed, an asshole.  It HELPS them to hear from someone else that they don't have to deal with MIL.  That it really is DH's job to intervene with over-stepping ILs.  A lot of husbands on this sub have been perfecting the art of dodging their moms since they were teenagers, and their response of ""Just ignore her"" works for them, but not for DIL.  Posters here give strategies that help."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,79augold,20,Wed Jul 8 16:01:50 2015 UTC,"I think people without truly toxic people in their lives cannot understand the level these MILs are on either. Before my MIL, I had never interacted on a familial level with someone who can literally make you crazy. My MIL is so sweet acting, but gossips about everyone. She can be told things over and over, but if she does not like what she is hearing, it never happened. She has the emotional maturity of a high schooler. She pouts and whines and speaks in a baby voice if she is not getting her way. My husband, by the way, also sees this behavior, and understands this is not the way emotionally healthy adults act. In the beginning though, it was so unbelievable, I thought I was losing it."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,hulah00per,2,Wed Jul 8 17:28:00 2015 UTC,Maybe there should be a [CAW] tag or something similar to distinguish between people seeking advice and people who are just venting?
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,mhende,0,Thu Jul 9 03:04:19 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. If it is stated in the post that she feels like she's not getting support from her husband or that husband refuses to even acknowledge the problem, then sure some constructive advice is fine. But like you said, no one is getting divorced from comments on this sub. So like another commenter ITT said, she was getting comments like ""Are you sure you want to marry him?"" when her post wasn't about her SO at all, and that just seems inappropriate to me."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,QueenoftheNorth82,8,Wed Jul 8 21:14:12 2015 UTC,It seems like you are trying to control how conversations on this sub go because they make you uncomfortable.

JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,QueenoftheNorth82,17,Fri Jul 10 13:24:05 2015 UTC,"FWIW: Part of the reason I made this subreddit was because of DWIL Nation. It's a great place to stop in and feed your drama hunger but part of the reason I thought a subreddit would be fun was because a lot of the contributors on DWIL are rather hard assed. Yes, they can be a great resource to teach/tell what is or isn't normal or boundary stomping or passive aggressive behavior. But some of them (I felt) were instantly as /u/baby_purple stated instantly advising divorce or cut off.  (as a side note, ranting isn't really allowed there)  for the record I'd fucking looooooooooooove to CO my MIL.  This can be a place to vent or ask for constructive advice as to how proceed with a jerk MIL. And some people are naturally more alpha and go straight to T/O (time out) C/O (cut off) or Divorce. They're gonna do them and honestly, some of those comments are what pushed me to take a course of action to tell my MIL it was time for her to take a back seat in my life. She wasn't my fucking matriarch and she was never going to be, these are my kids, not hers.  I love my husband dearly, and he's a good man and father to my kids.  but sometimes it's nice to hear he's an idiot and needs to rein in his own mom or similar things.  Because really, she shouldn't be my problem but husbands were raised by these women. Their normal meter may be broken because they saw this woman acting this way their whole lives. Not a cop out, but when you're an inch from a situation it can be hard to be objective about it. Not to mention sometimes they don't want to deal with the drama either... >_> must be nice to get lost in a video game or sporting event and tune out his own mother. But I don't have that luxury because I give a fuck how these kids are affected by this woman and her actions/words.  TL;DR: Some ppl gonna vent, some ppl gonna push for action. Take advice from internet strangers with a grain of salt."

My latest post (it was accidentally deleted.), the very first comment was questioning my decision to take my kids to the outer banks.  (It was something condescending like ""my question is why you would want to take your children to a beach infested with sharks?"").  I then had to defend my decision to a stranger and that made me even more frustrated.    My take on this sub is to vent and get stuff out of our system.  Most of us are here because we are already being judged by our mil's and mother's.  The last thing we need is to get crap here."

Someone will post that their MIL wants to babysit and then immediately get 10 responses like, ""NO! Get a REAL babysitter! And if she keeps asking to babysit, give her a 6 month time out!""  Also if the husband doesn't want to cut his mom off he is called a DUH because he's ""choosing HIS MOMMY over you!"" and you should divorce him.  My MIL wants to babysit sometimes and I let her... because she's grandma. Yeah she can be annoying sometimes, but she loves us and she loves my son more than anything. Unless you have a truly toxic in-law, it is just mean and a huge overreaction to cut them out of your life and deprive them of loving on their grand kids."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,jmullin09,5,Wed Jul 8 15:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just can't imagine demanding that we don't speak at all to my MIL because she is a little overbearing and opinionated. Then I'd just be the crazy one. I think in 10-20 years some of these people will realize it can be tough on the other side, too. Imagine your own child cutting you out of their lives entirely because you slightly offended his SO. That would be ridiculous."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,TheOneYouFeed,7,Wed Jul 8 15:53:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of DWIL posts start out like that, though. ""My MIL seemed fine, just a few weird comments here and there and always asking to visit etc, but then..."" and the rest of the post is WTF BSC. Makes us a bit trigger happy sometimes."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,meerkatsass,22,Wed Jul 8 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"I agree and would also like to add, as a husband, it's not always easy for us to side against our moms.  Especially when it's early in a marriage/relationship.    In my case, i always side with my wife.  I might point out what my mother intended when she said something stupid, but i will always side with my wife.  But that is a hard realization to come to and could be hard for many husbands.  We also tend to ""write off"" our mom's a bit more where my wife takes what she says more so to heart.  I have to remind myself that my wife hasn't been dealing with her for 33 years like i have and doesn't know how to interpret her.    I think my point is, even though it sounded way more clear in my head than it does in this comment, is that even when we are siding with our wives, we sometimes need to handle our mothers the way we know how, and that often involves a lot of tact so that feelings on both ends are spared.  I know with my mom, that if i were to lash out every time she was passive aggressive she would then get defensive and the conversation wouldn't go anywhere.  With her, i need to wait a few hours to show that i've reflected on things and then bring it up with her calmly, to which she responds well.  But that makes my wife mad when sometimes i will nod along when my mom is talking, but i will handle it later.  Early in our marriage this caused some rifts until i realized why.  After explaining it to my wife, she's on board and knows i will handle her.    TL:DR  It is a big shift for us, especially newly married gents, to stand up to our mom's, so sometimes give us time.  Also, i love this sub.  You are all great and supporting and a great sounding board."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,13,Wed Jul 8 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's somewhat normal to be kind of used to our own parents crazy. It's not necessarily gender based. I know my mother does things that drive my husband crazy and I'm just so used to growing up with it that even though I don't like it, I've just given up trying to fight it. Same goes for my MIL and my husband just being used to it. I think the important thing is to back up your spouse though (I mean unless they're being completely unreasonable).   It's really hard to go from one primary family unit (your parents, you and your siblings) to your new family unit (you, your spouse, and your kids). It takes time to realize that your family comes before any other family and it's a struggle for most people to grasp the difference. And, sadly, most parents are still in the mindset that their family unit (including you) come first and cannot grasp that you now have a new primary unit.   And now I'm just rambling out my thought process. I hope this makes any sort of sense. Haha."

My comments are always concise and articulate, until i start typing them.  Then its just mental diarrhea.  I totally agree that we all do it.  I think in my case its more one sided so thats why i chimed in, plus this sub is mostly females so i wanted to give a husbands point of view."

JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,pamplemousse2,4,Wed Jul 8 19:00:18 2015 UTC,Had the same thing with my husband and my father. My dad had a brain hemorrhage in his 30's so doesn't act like a normal adult. My husband couldn't understand why we didn't treat him like a normal adult and why we put up with certain things. It led to quite a few arguments in the early days. Took a few incidents before he realised you have to handle him a different way. He still doesn't always agree with some things but we talk about it when it happens.
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,pamplemousse2,2,Thu Jul 9 01:08:43 2015 UTC,"My general advice for husbands is that they have to live with their wives, so deal with your own mom. My general advice towards women dealing with an overbearing MIL is that she isn't their circus. Following my own advice has worked out very well for me and my husband, but it honestly took marital counseling and our counselor saying ""You have to live with her"" directly to his face before it really sunk in. Many people think they are dealing with a problem but in reality they are maintaining the status quo."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,pamplemousse2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:27:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for weighing in. This actually sounds like my husband could have written it, haha. He is so used to tuning his mom out and letting things she says roll off his back, because she is SO intense and SO full of opinions, it's just too overwhelming if you actually take everything she says to heart. I used to be incredulous that he could just straight up ignore his mom when she tried to interject, and now I find myself doing the same. And I agree, there have been times when she was just annoying the crap out of me, or saying things that bothered me, but even in the moment I know she didn't mean them that way, she was just blabbing without thinking. So like you said, lashing out every time isn't the answer, either, because it would just make my MIL get defensive. My husband really does know the best way to talk to her about things, and it's not right then and there in the moment. There have been times when my husband was in a difficult position between me and his parents, and I know it wasn't easy for him, either."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,5,Wed Jul 8 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"it's not right then and there in the moment   Exactly.  My wife and i have a look we share where she can ask me ""You on that?"" and i can answer in the affirmative even in the middle of a conversation.     I know it wasn't easy for him, either.   It took our first real disagreement between my wife, me, and my mom before i realized A)how hard and new of a situation this was for me/us and B)just how much i really am on my wife's side.  Man, you come at my wife for her doing something innocuous and I'm gonna go full papa bear on your ass regardless if you're my own mother or the pope."
JUSTNOMIL,3cjzce,pamplemousse2,4,Wed Jul 8 21:19:32 2015 UTC,I think the important thing as most people have said are family dynamics change and we just can't assume things. Each person needs to learn how to handle their newly joined family (and it can take years) and they just want a place to rant about things. Most people find that they can see a solution after they have had a rant and put it out there.  We need to be more supportive by upvoting if we agree and sharing our own stories so everyone knows they are not alone. And when asked for we give advice.

Actually implementing that in real life is not so cut and dry. It can be difficult blending different family dynamics, and it leads to friction.

JUSTNOMIL,3ck1e6,ohfluffit,7,Wed Jul 8 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"My MIL drives, and is willing to fly, she just doesn't make actually seeing the kids any type of priority. Or more realistically if we don't let her be a control freak and dictate every little detail she won't come.   Us not letting her dictate 100% of everything have been reasons for her canceling visits before. One example she was going to fly out, but I told her she either needed a flight that wasn't super late at night or not to Charleston. We lived 2 hours from Charleston and that drive is dangerous during the day, no way was I driving 2 hours at night to get her from the airport at 11pm. So it was fly to Charleston but it needs to be an earlier arrival, OR fly into Savannah and it can be anytime. She claimed to have booked a flight into Savannah, and then the DAY she was supposed to come, she canceled. Why? There was a hurricane....in NEW YORK. If it's not apparent, we lived in South Carolina, Hurricane Sandy didn't come anywhere near us, we didn't even get clouds from it.   I guess what we were supposed to do when she said to give her dates that were good for us was to tell her we're wide open with no plans for the next 12 years. If she wanted to come down during those 3 days that are bad...cool, but she'd be tagging along with me on super fun (not) errands and appointments, or bitching that I ""used her"" for free babysitting by leaving her at home with my oldest.

JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,taa134679852,29,Wed Jul 8 15:37:48 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. This is toxic, controlling, unbelievably inappropriate behavior. You don't have to love this woman because she's going to be ""family,"" and you don't have to put up with her.  Is there a reason why your FH is still living at home? I presume religious reasons, but good grief.  It's time to have a serious sit down with him and figure out what's going to happen after you're married. Putting up with it now isn't ok, but for the rest of your married lives? No way. I think you know, just from writing this all out, that it isn't sustainable. This isn't something that you can endure much longer, and I can tell you right now that it won't magically resolve itself when you take your vows.  Nope. That woman will be firmly entrenched in your life until one of you dies or you finally snap and leave. Your FH is your ally, your partner, your friend and confidant. There are some MAJOR issues right now:   He's sharing private conversations and statements you made to him in confidence. Regardless of your FMIL's behavior, this is a huge issue. He shouldn't be telling her that information to begin with, and since he is, he's a huge part of the problem. He's not standing up for you, but more importantly, he isn't standing up for himself. Whether or not he agrees with this behavior is moot - the fact that he's allowing himself to be treated this way as a 26 year old adult is not ok. How does your FH see things changing once the two of you are married? Have you discussed this? What's the hard line in the sand for him, and what are his reasons for waiting to draw it?    If you haven't had these conversations, you need to. If you have, and he has a good reason for waiting (finances, less drama, whatever), you need to know that he's going to have your back once you're married and how he expects things to go. Most importantly, do you trust him? Do you trust him to make this work with you once you're married? Because if he thinks this is going to go away, or you can just move out and she'll leave you alone, he's delusional.   Please trust your gut and be careful. There area ton of red flags here."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,l-x,10,Wed Jul 8 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"He is living at home because he's unemployed and doesn't want to strain our relationship by living on one income. That is why his ""job"" now is to do stuff around the house and to be there for the family. We lived together in college.   We have discussed how she will be once we are married and he's completely out of the house. I worry she'll constantly call and invite us over all the time. She says once we're married she knows she has to stay out of things. I honestly don't believe her. She hasn't shown me in 6 years that she can stay out of anything. My FH knows that our relationship is more important, especially once we are married. We have discussed this before.   I think one of the hardest things to convey is how the actual arguments that take place. My FH did stand up for me and defend me. FMIL told me he did. Because he stood up for me his parents thought he was hiding something from them and made the arguments worse. I wasn't there (I usually am for these fights), so I can't be 100% certain how everything went down. But when she goes at him, she yells and degrades claiming that he isn't showing her respect because he's not being truthful to her. She's a major guilt tripper. Hiding things from her makes everything worse. I'm not saying that it was right that he told her about our conversations, but in a way I can't blame him. I would have completely cracked under the pressure. His whole life he's had to share everything with her. When he does fight back to her and defend himself she always pulls the respect card. She'll tell him he's acting selfish. It's so hard for me to explain the dynamic of this house. I really do think she's mentally unstable. I haven't even cracked the surface on how she treats her own mother.   After this point I will discuss with him that from this moment on, it can't happen anymore. And as much as I hate it, I will probably have to tell her myself that I don't appreciate her needing to be involved with everything. I'm sure this will cause its own argument. At this point, everything does. I guess my parents and I should have fought more so I would be more prepared as an adult on how to deal with it. /s"
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,l-x,15,Wed Jul 8 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"That makes a LOT more sense, but it doesn't justify her behavior in the slightest. I highly recommend that instead of giving him ultimatums that you and he both talk to a therapist* about how to set boundaries and get some validation for what's healthy and what's not. The most important thing is that you're both on the same page and in agreement about how to move forward.  This is bigger than both of you, and her behavior is incredibly destructive and toxic. Having a way to talk in a safe place together and with a uninvolved third party (therapist) is a really excellent way to vent and get tools for moving forward. Super important when you're about to get married! I'm not saying there's an easy fix - it sounds like you're both going to have to ""grin and bear it"" until he's employed / you're married, but keep talking about it.   I wish both of you the best of luck.  *EDIT: PLEASE see a therapist who is not a friend or affiliated in any way with your FMIL. Your FH's youth pastor does not count."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,IncredibleBulk2,6,Wed Jul 8 18:05:25 2015 UTC,Do you think it would be a strain on your relationship to live on one income? It sounds like the privacy might be worth the sacrifice in comfort.

How is it more expensive for him to be at your apartment vs at his parent's house? Does he eat that much or take really long showers and never turn off the lights? Are they paying his car insurance and phone bill but only if he lives with them? I must be missing a step somewhere.   As for the problem at hand, I don't really have any advice. It's hard for me to be confrontational so I won't tell you that is the course uku should take. All I can say is stay strong and united with FH. As long as you have that, everything else is easier."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,IncredibleBulk2,3,Wed Jul 8 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"I guess it's because once he moves out they'll stop paying for everything, insurance, phone, etc. They might even stop helping with school. He gets $50 a week from them, but I'm sure that would end once he moves out. He wants to be able to contribute so the stress is not all on me, which I completely understand, but I don't think it would be as big a problem as he thinks.   Edit: It's hard for me to be confrontational as well, I've been that way my entire life. FMIL expects me to just get over that. Easier said than done."

He may know this, but I hope he will be able to follow through. This type of conditioning isn't unlearned at the ""I do"". He's had a lifetime of acquiescing to her, and it will very likely take time for him to learn/ realize things are different. Did you have these issues when you all lived together in college?  I think your stepmom might be a narcissist. Have you checked out r/raisedbynarcissists ?"
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,Puffsdangerfield,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:26:39 2015 UTC,"I think you two need couples therapy. Not marriage counseling - couples therapy. And I'd recommend conjoint individual therapy, too (ideally by the same therapist).   I feel terrible for your FH having been raised in that horror (toxic feels somehow inadequate to convey the magnitude). But here's the thing - because it's his family, he has all the control over how this will affect your lives. If he can't be strong enough to put his foot down with her and cut her off, you will suffer for as long as you're married to him. Until the day she dies, if you have children.  Really think about that. Until the day she dies.   Are you planning to have children with this man someday?  Because if you are, I want you to imagine something.  Imagine this woman with free access to your kids. Imagine your husband sacrificing your helpless babies to make her happy. It happens ALL THE TIME.  This is why I say you need to find out in advance if he has the intestinal fortitude to cut her off. Completely. Because unless you exaggerated in your description of her, this is not a woman who can be reasoned with.   I say again - you have NO power where she is concerned, he has all of it. So he needs the therapy even more than you do (and I agree that you need it too). Needing therapy isn't a bad thing. It's not weakness or inadequacy. Sometimes it's just impossible to see the other side of something when we've spent our whole lives feeling like there's no way out. No other way to be. No other way to live than what we've always known.   I really wish you the best. I hope you post an update because I'm genuinely concerned for the both of you.   Edit because my cat decided to send before I was ready. ;)"

JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,Puffsdangerfield,12,Thu Jul 9 04:23:18 2015 UTC,"2 is company. 3 is a crowd.  Your FMIL is laying down some really unhealthy behavior. Your relationship between your fiance and you is NONE OF HER BUSINESS. As adults, both of you are entitled to your right of privacy and she is not respecting that.   For one, what the hell does she even have to ""reconsider""? You are not marrying her, you are marrying him. It also seems she is infantalizing him. At 26, the parenting is over. He is an adult.   I don't think the therapist is a bad idea honestly. It helps having a neutral party to discuss the crazy with, especially if you plan on having some sort of familial association with them. It would also be a good idea to take your fiance with you. Maybe getting an outside perspective on the whole dynamic would be helpful to you both. He may not see how damaging a relationship like this can be."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,Syrinx221,7,Wed Jul 8 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"At that point in the conversation I'm surprised I was comprehending anything, my heart was racing so fast I'm surprised I didn't pass out. Because of all this with the minister and how she thought I wasn't ""taking it seriously"" she'd reconsider us going forward with the wedding. I finally told her my opinions about the minister's requirements and I think she eased up a fraction. I don't want to go alone to a woman's retreat. If this guy is going to make us do all that, I want to go with my FH to a couples retreat. She understood my fears and said if she wasn't busy that weekend she would go with me. I would rather go alone than with her.   I think that's a good idea about FH hearing an outside perspective. I think he's so used to it that he thinks everything is normal."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,PromiseIWontRapeYou,8,Wed Jul 8 17:37:57 2015 UTC,"I think he's so used to it that he thinks everything is normal.   As someone who grew up in a dysfunctional/abusive family: to him it is normal. That is going to be your biggest hurdle in all of this, and until he sees that it's not and recognize it for what it is, his part in this will aid in the uphill battle.   Marriage is about a lot more than just love. Love simply is not enough to sustain a healthy and prosperous relationship. It takes a lot of work from both sides as well as striving to obtain the same goals while being on the same side. It's also putting each other first. Right now it seems that MIL is trying to decide all of that for him, and that in itself can and will cause the relationship to implode. There is NO ROOM for her, and if she keeps asserting herself, then why are you even there? She is essentially taking your spot and acting as the wife for you.   Personally, I'm not religious in any aspect either, so take this with a grain of salt, but the whole thing with the minister sounds straight up fishy to me. Did you have to buy the books? Pay for the retreat(s)? Is he profiting from this? That isn't marriage counseling, that is a business. It's not uncommon for churches and religions to require some form of counseling, but what is being required of you just sounds like a way for the minister to profit. I've never even heard of a church requiring all that crap. And I was raised catholic!  Definitely hit up the outside neutral perspective."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,Ladybooth,4,Wed Jul 8 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"I have become more religious over the years and we do attend church on a semi-regular basis. I have very liberal beliefs though, and do feel very private about it because of where I live.   One of my concerns, which I spoke with FH about, is the minister's requirements. I'm on the same page as you in regards to everything sounding fishy. The books are very stereotypical in my opinion and yes, both my FH and I have to pay $200 each to attend our 4 day retreats (on top of the 4 hours of travel to get there). He doesn't work so taking time off isn't a problem, but that's vacation time that I need to use to attend and I'm not too pleased. Maybe that makes me selfish to think that. These retreats are based on these books I mentioned. The minister works for men's retreat and holds many retreats throughout the year (and he may partially own the company, I'm not sure. I think he's on the board of directors). None of these retreats/books are about marriage. They are about men and women. I don't feel that this is what marriage counselling should be, it should be about both of us together. I understand the underlying premise of ""attending these individual retreats will help you become a better individual and therefore strengthen your marriage"" but I just can't get on board with it, not this way. We also have 4 sessions with the minister alone that I'm assuming will be the actual marriage counselling. Everything about this is so confusing to me. It doesn't seem normal, and I believe he's asking a lot from us with these requirements.  FMIL took this as me not taking it seriously and that I wasn't planning on attending."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,pamplemousse2,12,Wed Jul 8 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"Has this minister had any education in marriage, counseling, relationships, etc? With everything you said, I really question his creditials and motives. In marriage counseling, its normal to have some individual sessions but this seems ludicrous. Its not about marriage, its about someones dollar. Also, the fact that you are expected to share intimate details with NO expectation of privacy would be a huge no go for me. Its at the very least unethical based on the fact that him and MIL are friends. That is an inappropriate relationship in relation to his position and professional relationship to you two. Before sinking any money and time into this, get a second opinion. From someone with a license and laws they have to answer to."

JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,ohfluffit,8,Wed Jul 8 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"First of all it doesn't sound like anything is wrong with you at all. She sounds crazy controlling. It's not her place to reconsider your wedding and personal questions about your relationship are  none of  her business.  You're both adults. Get your FH on board with setting some boundaries now before before the wedding. Really it's his job to do so, not yours. If she is like this now imagine if you have children! Also you don't have to love her just because you are marrying her step son. If  you don't like her, you don't have to love her. It might  be a good idea for both you and FH to have some counselling on how to handle her."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,Cupcake_eater,3,Wed Jul 8 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"She sounds awful. I actually think you're right - therapy to help you deal with her, and maybe some real couples counseling on how to make the transition to just a family of two, will help you go a long way in making the rest of your life much more pleasant! Good luck - she sounds like a piece of work."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,Puffsdangerfield,3,Wed Jul 8 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"See if you can set up a one on one with the minister to voice your concerns about the mil, see if he can talk some sense into the crazy woman. Seems like she's the type to listen to a minister vs her own family."
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,fruitjerky,3,Wed Jul 8 17:34:08 2015 UTC,Her and the minister are friends. Because he isn't a licensed therapist it worries me to talk to him about her because there's nothing stopping him telling her what I say. But that's probably just anxiety making me feel that way.
JUSTNOMIL,3ck7l1,-purple-is-a-fruit-,5,Wed Jul 8 17:42:02 2015 UTC,"I can't pretend to know every religion but the minister should definitely NOT be sharing anything you share with him in confidence.  Those ""of the cloth"" can't even been compelled in court to share even a murder confession if it was shared in the person's position with the church.  Also, this is all so crazy and so overbearing, if the minister did share with her (which would be awful and a total breach of trust and his obligations) it might help her to see that others think she's out of whack.    How much longer until you two move in together?  I'm sure you've already considered this a million times, but is there any way for him to move in with you sooner?  It might be worth him picking up a part time job for his sanity's sake (instead of the odd jobs and sitting) as I imagine this is all tough on him too."

In the past, we have discussed him moving in and it's just not gonna work out yet. In the summer when he doesn't have classes he looks after his sister a lot more. And during the school year, he's usually the one who takes her to school in the morning. He's in his last year of school in a challenging field so having a job during that time would be very difficult, especially juggling his other ""job"".   It's so hard living alone while my fiance lives at home 10 minutes away. It's especially hard when he has to leave at night because they don't want him to come home too late."

Not at the time, we were just so exhausted and over everything. The following day though it hit and we could not stop laughing. I have no idea what goes on in her head, apparently she still cooks things randomly and gets mad that no one eats it (mostly because no one knows about it?). She also buys bread loaves in bulk despite having coeliac disease, and gets the shits that no one eats them and they go mouldy."

She has constant falling outs/make ups with most (if not all) people she knows. While I am 100% sure there has been bad things contributing to her attitude she has been unstable since childhood (according to family) she will put herself into bad situations often too (stupid things like booking 2 appointments at the same time and panicking that she can't make them, feeding the dog dangerous foods and immediately leaving the house to panic about him getting hurt or sick, driving across town during her 30min lunch break to go to a cafe without adequate time to actually eat/drink her order).  She had been to a doctor before and they did tell her she was mentally unstable. But instead of taking that as a wake up call she argued with him and has not been back since, whenever the topic would come up she would just go on and on about what a horrible doctor he was and how offended she was with his professional opinion. No way would I suggest she see a doctor, imagine how big she would blow that out of proportion."
JUSTNOMIL,3ceion,Rosertot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:21:42 2015 UTC,Yeah now she sounds like my mother. Although mine is generally better at hiding it.   Mine would never get therapy either.

I think she knows she's crazy and basically constructed her entire personality around pretending she's not.   I can't imagine being peripherally involved in that. It sounds like you're handling it as well as could be expected. What a mess!
JUSTNOMIL,3ceion,Rosertot,24,Wed Jul 8 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat with the disabled husband and shitty MIL. I've been the one who has been there every step of the way for him throughout all the shit that's happened since he got hurt. She didn't even bother to come see him while he was in the hospital after the accident (she had a vehicle then and very well could have. Hell, my mom did come to help keep me sane when he had an emergency surgery and helped me clean out the semi, but his mom was NOWHERE to be seen.), but God forbid I didn't answer my phone so she could give me unwanted ""advice"".   Apparently, putting his needs before mine and advocating for him to get the care he needs makes me a ""shitty wife""  and he needs to divorce me. (These were her actual words to him.)

I'm lucky FIL was so helpful, he was so mad about her attitude he put her in her place and he was the one to ensure our requests were enforced.

It usually takes between 6 months to a year after BC to be fully fertile again. MOST women don't get pregnant until then after BC. We didn't actively start trying til a year I was off the pill. After that, I started tracking my cycle, figuring out my fertile days, and used a fertility monitor. Took 2 tries like that but we were aggressive.

I don't want people to feel like they have to walk on eggshells around me, but I guess I thought it was common sense that saying stuff like what my MIL said was not helpful at all.   I know logically it isn't time to be worried that we haven't gotten pregnant yet. Six months off bc isn't long at all, and really the first 3 months hardly count because I just assumed it wasn't going to happen so we didn't time things well, heck one month we were traveling with my inlaws and didn't do it at all in my fertile window.

It's really tough to have everyone waiting and watching.   I think you were wise and strong for not making a scene.   I also think it's appropriate for your husband to pull his mother aside in private and tell her to lay off the pregnancy pressure because it's bothering him. The key is that it needs to be him saying it and about it bothering him. Perhaps then she can respect the boundary.   Men don't understand the societal pressure on women to be mothers and/or to get pregnant. I hope he can better support you through this process.
JUSTNOMIL,3cbf4h,pamplemousse2,6,Wed Jul 8 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"I think he is starting to get it. At the same time, I keep saying things like ""It's not time to worry yet!"" or ""It really hasn't been that long, the first 3 months off bc don't really count!"" because I am trying to make it less stressful on both of us. I mean, he was horrified when his mom started in on asking about getting tested a couple weeks ago, he shut that down real quick without me even having to say anything. I think he's so used to his mom being annoying and badgering with questions and advice about every single topic under the sun, that he didn't realize how personally I would take the comments about getting pregnant."

JUSTNOMIL,3cbf4h,prettywannapancake,5,Tue Jul 7 03:03:04 2015 UTC,THIS. THAT. THE OTHER. Give her waaaay too much info. Ask her for advice! Demand to know what position she was in when your husband was conceived. Gross her the hell out and maybe she'll be so mortified that she'll stop!
JUSTNOMIL,3cbf4h,cant_be_me,8,Tue Jul 7 01:33:38 2015 UTC,"It took us about 20 cycles before it happened. It wasn't until about 6-7 months in that I started to notice differences in my period, like the cramping was more intense than before. I don't know for sure, but I always felt like maybe thats how long it took for the bc to get washed out my system. I also did the temperature taking, and figured out that the whole ""ovulate on day 14"" thing didn't apply to me, I was more like day 16 or so. I know how heartbreaking it is every month. Coupled with the fact that I'm at the age where everybody I know is having kids (sometimes I considered taking an extended break from Facebook and all its ""good news""), and it felt like my body was failing at what it was made to do. But having my girl now, and seeing how awesome she is, I would go through it all over again. All of this to say, don't lose hope. But absolutely protect yourself when people are being nosy assholes. I know a girl who has been trying for 4 years, and she unfriended me after I got pregnant. I completely understood, she needed to protect herself. Tell your husband that every comment from his mother hurts you, and its impossible for you not to take it personally since it is such a personal subject."
JUSTNOMIL,3cbf4h,Trexy,3,Tue Jul 7 02:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't help that my Facebook feed is just plastered with babies and pregnant people. My best friend just had a baby, and she posts on Facebook A LOT anyway, and she's a very gushy over the top kind of person. So it's just constant pictures with captions about how perfect the baby is and what a wonderful feeling it is and how happy she is. I'm happy for her, but it stings a little, too."

That shut him up for a while."
JUSTNOMIL,3cbf4h,Yassssmaam,3,Wed Jul 8 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm an overly dramatic person, but to me, that's one of the best ways of shutting down that kind of issue.

JUSTNOMIL,3cbf4h,Elle345,7,Tue Jul 7 13:24:25 2015 UTC,"I think he will probably say something to her privately. If I had said something then and there, then I'd become ""baby_purple that can't get pregnant so we have to walk on eggshells and not bring up pregnancy around her"" and I don't need people pitying me either. Plus she's just overbearing about everything all the time, so to her sons it's like ""Yeah, she annoys the shit out of us, too"" and they wouldn't get why that one thing set me off.

Each little cut isn't worth calling her out on as it'll seem like you're overreacting and as you say start walking on eggshells around you, but the cuts all add up especially when it's something you're understandably already sensitive about.  Could you make up a minor issue to cause you to tell her you're taking a break from trying? Mortgage renegotiation, restructure/promotion opportunity at work, issues with your family, not wanting to be pregnant for a holiday or maybe a friend's wedding/birthday? Maybe that'll get her to back off and give you some space?  It sucks spending a lot of your adult life actively trying not to get pregnant and then when you're ready to do it, it doesn't happen as quickly as you think!"
JUSTNOMIL,3cbf4h,fruitjerky,4,Mon Jul 6 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"Omg yes, you said it so perfectly. It's just tiny little comments here and there, nothing that's worth getting upset over. And she is the type that even when she is called out or told that something she said upset someone, she gets suuuuuuper defensive about it. So for me to say right then and there that her comment hurt, she would just say ""I'm just kidding! I'm just excited for you guys to have a baby!"" She kept making comments to my husband one day about how fast he eats and how big the bites he was taking were, until he snapped and said ""YOU'RE BEING ANNOYING, I CAN'T ENJOY EATING AROUND YOU"" and she cried and left the table and it was super awkward for the rest of the day.

If she ever brings it up again just keep saying, I'm so sorry. I need to change the subject.""   She's driving you crazy because she's giving you no options. Either you suck it up or you get stuck talking to her about how you are sucking it up. Either way she's going to keep pushing.

JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,LadyOfSighs,12,Sun Jul 5 20:12:55 2015 UTC,I'm laughing so hard right now. Lol. But I will definitely try standing in between them. Hope she doesn't push me aside. Wouldn't put it past her.
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,cakebakingpanda,3,Sun Jul 5 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe water her with a spray bottle while loudly say no?  Ah no, that's for pets. Fill the bottle with something stinky, maybe? :)"
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,LadyOfSighs,3,Mon Jul 6 13:43:22 2015 UTC,So tempting!
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,cakebakingpanda,3,Mon Jul 6 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"Ah well, if all else fails, I can suggest my favorite technique: a cricket bat."
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,LadyOfSighs,3,Mon Jul 6 14:16:04 2015 UTC,I do have a tennis racket.
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,Puffsdangerfield,3,Mon Jul 6 14:24:20 2015 UTC,Might work brilliantly. AND give her a lovely crisscross make-up.  Win-Win. Go for it.
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,Rysona,20,Mon Jul 6 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"If anyone has any advice on how to get her to stop being all on top of him, please feel free to give me some.    Leave. Give her one riot act warning. Just one. ""From now one, no more __________________. Each and every time you disrespect that boundary, we will leave immediately. No matter where we are.

JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,whatthecrump,6,Tue Jul 7 19:37:05 2015 UTC,What do you mean she puts her mouth all over him? She's all kissing his face? Or she's literally mouthing sections of his body.   I know giving a kiss on the cheek is normal but mouthing or sucking on the kid is creepy.
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,TheEthalea,13,Sun Jul 5 20:54:09 2015 UTC,"She kisses him but not just once and not just on his face. Everywhere. Legs, arms, etc. And these are open mouth, slobbering, raspberry ""kisses"" complete with the obnoxious sounds and everything."
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,Syrinx221,12,Sun Jul 5 21:04:50 2015 UTC,Ew. NO MIL. Or anyone really. That just sounds so disgusting.

JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,Syrinx221,11,Tue Jul 7 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"Oh God when you figure it out let me know. MIL met our day old daughter for the first time today and would NOT get out of her face. Like she is hours old, please stop breathing into her mouth."
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,-purple-is-a-fruit-,16,Sun Jul 5 21:33:43 2015 UTC,My FIL kissed my baby on the mouth while she was in the NICU. My husband lost his shit.

JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,-purple-is-a-fruit-,7,Mon Jul 6 03:06:40 2015 UTC,Yup. She was premature and in the NICU. It was classic FIL. The rules don't apply to him.
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,cardinal29,6,Mon Jul 6 14:40:34 2015 UTC,ewww on so many levels. I would murder my FIL.
JUSTNOMIL,3c7x62,watercolorrooster,6,Mon Jul 6 14:01:26 2015 UTC,He very nearly got murdered. There is a good chance that he will die by my hand someday. I can never leave my daughter alone with him. He has no common sense with children. All of my husband's stories about visitation time with his father are frightening. He would regularly be left in a toy store or Sam Goodey for hours. FIL keeps buying my daughter dog toys and choking hazards.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,cakebakingpanda,64,Sun Jul 5 13:35:11 2015 UTC,"If I can't trust you with my silverware drawer, why would I trust you with my child?"
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,agentfantabulous,21,Sun Jul 5 15:40:15 2015 UTC,I'm going to steal this. This is perfect.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,LadyOfSighs,22,Sun Jul 5 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"Is there any way to block her the access to your kitchen?  And as for LO, you're perfectly right. One-year old to take her grandson for a weekend is an insane idea.  You had you own kids to care for, MiL, leave the place to the following generations."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,37-pieces-of-flair,18,Sun Jul 5 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"Normally I follow her into the kitchen but she waits until I take munchkin to change his diaper or go to the bathroom.  It's just so annoying. She thinks I need a break from munchkin, I think he needs his mommy and she can just wait."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,agentfantabulous,17,Sun Jul 5 14:02:32 2015 UTC,"My ex's mom came to our place and started cleaning the kitchen.  Almost lost my shit right there.  Knowing what a neat freak she is (must be easy when you have a housekeeping service) my ex and I cleaned for 3 days. Almost nonstop. And she still had the nerve to try and scrub my counters. Bitch, I know your eyesight sucks, put on glasses and get some goddamn tact and respect the boundaries.  One of the 2 best things about the breakup was never dealing with her again."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,agentfantabulous,9,Sun Jul 5 16:58:26 2015 UTC,Omg right! I also have a lot of special tools that have a special way of being cleaned and she thinks oh this can totally go in the dishwasher.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,rbnthrowaway13,15,Sun Jul 5 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"My MIL is fond of filling up my cast iron pans and my wok with hot soapy water and letting them soak for a few days, and then using my dish sponge to wipe mud off the floor.   Of course, this is after she cuts up some raw chicken and then touches everything in the kitchen with her nasty raw chicken hands."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,weaselbeef,7,Sun Jul 5 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"Omg! I just cried for your skillets! Why, what would possess someone to do those things?"
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,fruitjerky,8,Sun Jul 5 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"She is from another country, she grew up with maids and never learned proper housekeeping-type skills, she was severely abused as a child and suffers from serious emotional and physical disorders as a result.   Basically, she's certifiably insane. She also lives a 14-hour car trip away and has a very busy important job which gives her very little time off, so her visits are few, and short. My husband generally takes care of her, and does a great job of defending me and diffusing her tantrums."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,catnamedbear,6,Sun Jul 5 18:41:41 2015 UTC,At least the visit are few and far between. Good on your hubby for helping with her as well! Mine is 2 hours away and makes her own schedule so she's always wanting to stop by.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,LadyOfSighs,4,Sun Jul 5 18:45:27 2015 UTC,I would cut a bitch for desecrating my cast iron. Seriously! Ask my hubs...he is no longer allowed to use them when I'm not home.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Trishlovesdolphins,14,Mon Jul 6 11:03:08 2015 UTC,Tell her no. Be firm like you would with any other misbehaving immature person.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Trishlovesdolphins,12,Sun Jul 5 13:45:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I am, she isn't taking munchkin until I'm ready. I might start telling her that every time she ask me I'll push my ready date back another 3 months."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Trishlovesdolphins,6,Sun Jul 5 13:59:18 2015 UTC,I did this when MIL was nagging us to have kids. It shut her up pretty quick.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Trishlovesdolphins,5,Sun Jul 5 18:01:31 2015 UTC,Ha! Nice
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,crystal1107,4,Sun Jul 5 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"Every time AND every time she rearranges something in the kitchen.  By the look of it, she won't be able to have munchkin before  he's 40. At least."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,yw1,13,Mon Jul 6 13:07:10 2015 UTC,"She also rearranges my kitchen EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE'S HERE! I like the way my kitchen is set up, it works perfect for me, stop moving my shit mil!    My mom's MIL did that too! My mom is left handed, and my grandma was convinced her kitchen was all wrong and would rearrange everything to the way she liked it. I've noticed that my kitchen is ""left handed"" too for no other reason that I'm used to it that way."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,undeadamerican,5,Sun Jul 5 15:12:01 2015 UTC,Why can't they leave things alone? Just because you don't like doesn't mean it's wrong!
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,undeadamerican,5,Sun Jul 5 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"Well, in her case, she hated my mom. lol So she was doing it to be a bitch."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Bibbityboo,8,Sun Jul 5 15:33:45 2015 UTC,Well that's just not nice.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Bibbityboo,12,Sun Jul 5 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"No, I can't say my grandma has ever been ""nice"" to my mom. They don't get along, especially now. After my mom ""stole"" her first born. They got divorced and ""she"" put him in jail for beating her and back child support. ""SHE"" lied and the police made up the bruises. ""SHE"" called up the state and told them to erase all the records of his child support payments to make it look like he owed her 100K in back support...   My grandma loves her boys to their own (and her own) detriment."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Bibbityboo,5,Sun Jul 5 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm sorry that is horrible. I can't imagine going through that."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,allpregnantandshit,5,Sun Jul 5 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"They've been divorced about 25 years now. I've cut him off and oddly enough, saw my grandmother just yesterday for the first time in 15 years. Her health is starting to fail, and one of my uncles brought her for a visit to see my kids. (I won't take them to their state/town because I don't want my sperm donor anywhere near them.)"
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,carolina_snowglobe,9,Sun Jul 5 16:47:29 2015 UTC,"MIL keeps saying to LO (4mo) ""when mummy stops getting boob out, you can come on holiday with us""  Ugh, no. I'm breastfeeding until 2 (hopefully) and even then, why do you think I'd let you take my child away for up to 2 weeks?   Crazy."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,pamplemousse2,9,Sun Jul 5 17:40:34 2015 UTC,Good luck on the bf until 2. I'm getting pressure to cut him off cold turkey from both sets of grandparents which is just making me want to go longer.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Kinderheart,5,Sun Jul 5 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"Do it!  It's so handy to be able to settle a toddler with the snap of a nursing bra :)  Shots, falls, over tiredness,etc can all be solved with boob.  Plus those antibodies!"
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Yassssmaam,2,Mon Jul 6 03:58:00 2015 UTC,Seriously I got so much pressure to wean my first and I caved and I regret it to this day. Do not wean until you are ready!
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,Yassssmaam,2,Wed Jul 8 13:25:39 2015 UTC,I'm going to try not to. I seem to have everyone against me except my hubby.
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,cardinal29,2,Wed Jul 8 13:32:56 2015 UTC,"Well it's super awesome that your husband is on your side at least. I totally know how you feel. Come join us at r/breastfeeding! :) And also if you haven't already, try a breastfeeding support group like LLL or Breastfeeding USA. There's strength in numbers, seriously. You are doing an awesome thing for your baby, great job."
JUSTNOMIL,3c70hr,cardinal29,2,Thu Jul 9 01:44:48 2015 UTC,I visited that sub religiously when we first started because we had quite a few problems and we almost gave up. We were like 1 day away from quitting and then munchkin decided he wanted it from the tap finally so I didn't have to pump any more our supplement. Working so hard for it makes it that much harder to give up. I will come back though.
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,patientish,23,Sun Jul 5 01:04:36 2015 UTC,What kind of bananas are you cutting if they bend knives??? 0.o
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,RandomBanana007,10,Sun Jul 5 04:14:19 2015 UTC,Yes please explain how a banana can bend a knife.
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,nomorechocolatebars,7,Sun Jul 5 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"Blended, thawed-from-frozen banana for child.  Not super soft, but for real?  AND she instructed me to use the ""bad"" knife that was sturdier.  If it's sturdy and works better, why isn't it in with the ""good"" dishes?  I don't understand.  Then again, maybe I was just trashy before with my mismatched dishes, and reusing a dish for different things instead of having many separate dishes at a meal to wash.  Not that it matters now, she does all the dishes.  Sometimes before I am done using them."
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,_Jane_Doe_,14,Sun Jul 5 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"I hear you, and I commiserate.  I wish I had some advice for you.  I'm in a similar situation, except our baby is due in September, and I anticipate things will get much more frustrating when she is born. Are you looking at moving out any time soon?  That would be my number one priority!  Good luck"
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,_Jane_Doe_,10,Sun Jul 5 02:26:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe in spring.  I hope so.  We had another tale of woe this spring where my husband had to quit his job due to health problems (caused by them) and also them being jerks.  He is newly re-employed and we have no idea whether it will last (supposed to be a 3-month term with possibility of extending).  I think so, but no guarantee.  For me to remain employed at my current job from which I am on maternity leave will probably cost more than I will make.   But we neeeeed to get out.  3 people in one room.  Sharing a kitchen with a perfectionist."
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,cardinal29,6,Sun Jul 5 02:35:26 2015 UTC,"Oh god, that sounds awful.  Two people and a baby in one room.  That must drive you and your husband mad.  How do you ever get any alone time? My MIL announces to everyone that will listen that she has OCD.  She doesn't, she's just a control freak.  I mean, she vacuums the kitchen sink! WHO DOES THAT?!?!?  It's madness.  I hope you guys get to move soon."
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,Syrinx221,12,Sun Jul 5 02:40:36 2015 UTC,"Alone time?  What's that? :P  No, we wait for child to be asleep.  Or leave him with grandpa, who he adores.  Our room is tucked away in the basement so there is a little bit of privacy.    I had so hoped we could move before child was born, but life happens.  It's been an exercise in standing up for myself!  Edit: vacuuming the sink?  That's bizarre."
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,mnh1,6,Sun Jul 5 02:44:10 2015 UTC,vacuuming the sink? That's bizarre.   Whaaaaaat?  Crazy confirmed
JUSTNOMIL,3c5mn4,AusSco,2,Sun Jul 5 02:56:57 2015 UTC,Vacuums the kitchen sink? What the hell is that all about?
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,lindsaytheowl,38,Sat Jul 4 14:37:38 2015 UTC,"From what you said it sounds like your baby hasn't been born yet? If you don't want her to tell everyone on Facebook, tell everyone else first and let her find out from your own Facebook announcement. :D Taste of her own medicine."
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,MyHusbandIsAPenguin,16,Sat Jul 4 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"No, we are due any day :D and that is a great idea!!"
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,MyHusbandIsAPenguin,14,Sat Jul 4 14:47:06 2015 UTC,Especially if she's not with your husband's dad so you can tell all of his family first and yours then let her know at the end.
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,pamplemousse2,10,Sat Jul 4 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"She keeps saying she wants to be there, but with how volatile she is with SOs dad, I don't see how she could be."
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,AppleThrower5000,27,Sat Jul 4 15:04:26 2015 UTC,Do not let her be there when baby is born. Do not tell her when you go into labour. Tell her last when kiddo is born. No good can come of anything else!!!!!
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,wrincewind,8,Sat Jul 4 16:19:15 2015 UTC,That's what I'm planning to do. SIL is going to call her after baby is born.
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,pamplemousse2,11,Sat Jul 4 16:49:46 2015 UTC,"Make sure it is waaaayy after the birth. Like you've recovered and are home from the hospital already. That way if she comes by and you don't want to see her you don't have to deal with getting her to leave, you can just not open the door."
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,MyHusbandIsAPenguin,4,Sat Jul 4 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"and make sure she knows you're planning on giving birth in <insert name of hospital you're totally not going to be at>, so she can't burst in on you uninvited."
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,SGB_Mom,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:03:49 2015 UTC,"Good good good good good. You don't need to be worrying about that. Cumberland on the little one, and gift luck with the birth!"
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,AppleThrower5000,3,Sat Jul 4 17:24:16 2015 UTC,At the birth?! I'd shut that shit right down but then I don't want anyone there... Good luck with it all if you can't get rid of her!
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,Notsocreativeeither,20,Sat Jul 4 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"Just real quick on the credit thing; can't you report the loan as fraud since he didn't take it out? I know putting his mom in jail might be harsh, but that is completely illegal."
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,AppleThrower5000,18,Sat Jul 4 16:25:32 2015 UTC,"They can and they should, I think people who do this to their children are disgusting. Stealing and identity theft are bad enough, but to do it to the little people you were given to protect and love is unforgivable.    That said, fraud cases can be a long process and some people won't turn in family no matter what."
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,nomorechocolatebars,9,Sat Jul 4 18:59:19 2015 UTC,If he was under 18 when the loan was taken  out all he has to due is show proof  of age like a birth certificate  and it will be removed  from his records.
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,Syrinx221,3,Sun Jul 5 02:05:41 2015 UTC,"I think that's the ideal situation but I've heard people say they still had to call multiple agencies to get it completely erased from everywhere. And if he wasn't a minor it's even more difficult. But you're right, that's all the proof you need if you were a minor at the time the loans were taken out."
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,aboutagirl22,2,Sun Jul 5 16:17:02 2015 UTC,I have literally no relationship with my father however I cannot bring myself to report the loans he took in my name. It's hard and I can only imagine how much worse it would be if we had an ongoing relationship.
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,OnyxKnight,12,Sun Jul 5 04:29:12 2015 UTC,"We've had several talks about her not announcing the birth of our baby until we have time to tell family, but we'll see how that goes.   She's already shown that she can't be trusted with this sort of information. TWICE.  Fool me once...."
JUSTNOMIL,3c3tzg,OnyxKnight,10,Sat Jul 4 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"If you don't want her to ruin your chance to let people know important things in your own time stop telling her ahead of time. She is not suddenly going to become a reasonable person and heed your expectations, unfortunately."
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,Myplaidsocks,54,Sat Jul 4 01:19:28 2015 UTC,"So, here's the thing. Congratulations on your baby. She's YOUR baby. The nice thing is that you get to hold her whenever you want. Regardless of what your MIL days. So, when she comes over to get LO? Say ""I want to hold her just now."" If she TAKES her from you, that's your cue to leave. If she goes to take her out of the room? You say ""please stay here in the living room while you're holding LO - we want to visit all together "" if she said no, you take your baby and you leave.  If she's pissed, oh fucking well. Your feelings win, every time."
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,pamplemousse2,18,Sat Jul 4 03:29:41 2015 UTC,"Your feelings win, every time.   Agreed on all fronts. Don't have to be rude (gives ammo for drama llamas), but being firm and polite with these responses can work wonders. Being mother of the baby, you have the upper hand and the trump card. Keep that in mind!"
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,Lockraemono,6,Sat Jul 4 04:16:46 2015 UTC,"You're so right, I'm going to do this!"
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,pamplemousse2,4,Sun Jul 5 12:02:07 2015 UTC,"Good luck! I'd let your husband know beforehand, just in case there's nonsense. Keep us posted?!"
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,Syrinx221,3,Sun Jul 5 12:17:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much. Fuck all that."
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,Rosertot,37,Sun Jul 5 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"She won't let me hold LO at all. The second I finish breastfeeding her she takes her from me. And will leave the room and take her to the bedroom while we're in the living room.   Reading this pisses me off so much. If my MIL ever tries this shit with me, I will take my child and leave immediately.   I'd try to put a stop to this ASAP. I'd be worried that she'd try to unlatch LO during the middle of a feeding and just walk away with her."
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,cordsniper,24,Sat Jul 4 02:35:25 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Why the hell does she leave the room with her?  What is she doing?  That would creep me the hell out.
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,fruitjerky,29,Sat Jul 4 04:22:09 2015 UTC,"My mom has made passive aggressive comments a couple of times--your husband should be calling her out on that shit. ""We load her in the car to come spend time with you as often as we can. If that feels to you like we're 'keeping her' from you then I don't know why we'd continue to put in the effort. Traveling with a baby is hard.""    My mom has commented on there being more pictures of LO with my in-laws. I've told her they do more things then she does. Not my fault she hasn't planned a family gathering literally ever.    My dad tries to get me to bring LO over and then leave. I just told him he was being ridiculous.    If my MIL said those things, though, that's my husband's issue. Not my monkeys, not my circus."
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,wrestlegirl,20,Sat Jul 4 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"And will leave the room and take her to the bedroom while we're in the living room.     This confuses me.  Whenever I read about this, and it's oddly not-uncommon, I wonder what these people feel they need private baby time for.  Last I checked there wasn't anything grandma can do in the bedroom with baby that she can't do in the living room.    Go get your baby when she does it.  Your kid, your rules."
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,Ashleve,7,Sat Jul 4 05:17:36 2015 UTC,So much this! My MIL wanted to take our twins upstairs to the guest room by herself when she was visiting them. We put the  kibosh on that REAL quick.
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,Ashleve,3,Sat Jul 4 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"It's so strange that people do this! And with twins, it isn't easy to take them both away!"
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,LadyOfSighs,3,Sun Jul 5 12:04:29 2015 UTC,She also insists on holding them/carrying them both at the same time. Drives us crazy!
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,these-are-loafers,2,Sun Jul 5 12:12:42 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.
JUSTNOMIL,3c22zv,cardinal29,15,Sat Jul 4 20:12:37 2015 UTC,"My parents are the same. Honestly, now I match their efforts to maintain the ""relationship"" we have.

I would be fuming,  it's one thing to do it to me but I think I would have lost it at her by now for doing it to my kids. It must have been heart breaking when your son came to you. There's nothing worse than someone who is supposed to care and love them hurts them and you have no control over it. Ugh,  I am angry for you!

I've called him Baron Münchhausen behind his back.  When they were younger I would say ""take it with a grain of salt,"" and after a while, they figured it out.  It may seem harsh, but you've got to give them the tools to defend themselves, against relatives and against bad people in the world.  My son recently hung up with Grandpa and said ""Grandpa graduated from (Ivy League School), too!""  Apparently, Grandpa had forgotten that he claimed a different alma mater at another time.  He is also a ""published author,"" ""war hero"" and ""professional golfer""  I was happy that my son could just laugh it off."

He thinks she unintentionally says mean things.   The biggest problem is that my DH wants to just ignore it all. He wants me to pretend that they didn't call me names, and yell at me over a dehumidifier. He couldn't talk to his mom when it all happened and so he feels that it doesn't matter now. He wants me to come to all their family things, and if she is mean to me he will TRY to ""handle"" it then. Ridiculous! (He thinks if he asks politely she will stop.)

It took until I was 22 to really see and understand what my mom was doing to my relationship with my fiance. It took a long time for it to happen, I was close friends with my fiance before we got together since I was 14. Even as he was my friend he was trying to guide me out of that maze. That's how long it took for the emotional manipulation to stop taking a hold and for logic to succeed. It took my fiance snapping at me and telling me the reality of the situation and how hurt he was by the shit my mom was pulling to really see the situation with clarity. Sometimes tough love is the way to go."

I have snapped on several occasions after I discovered he was lying.    For example, MIL came back into town over my winter break (I'm a teacher). She stayed in the house down the street with friends. This was after the big fight but before her big trip was really over so FIL had asked us to stay and continue watching the house.    I kept telling my DH that I thought I was seeing MIL in her car. He said no that is impossible, she is in California! Then she posted to facebook pictures of him and her at his office, and herself with the neighbors down the street.   He let me believe I was seeing things for a whole week! I was furious, and I snapped. It has been the last time that I caught him in a lie about his mother, but I think he just got better at hiding it.   If I stick it out we have to get a better counselor."

The problem here is that he has to be willing to meet you halfway in order for counselling to work. I think him seeing the comments here might be helpful because perhaps he thinks that this is a small problem or that you're over reacting. He's just trying to keep things from boiling over except that the water escaped the pot a while ago. He needs to have that, 'Aha' moment where he realizes how much he fucked up like I did."

JUSTNOMIL,3bz845,modecat,17,Fri Jul 3 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"I hope you let your husband read these comments.  Dear, well Dear Husband,  When you marry someone, you're making a new family. You're not subsuming your new partner into your existing family. You pick a person and say, ""We're the nucleus of this atom."" You move your parents and siblings out to the first electron ring - you don't have to lose them completely, and most people don't, but they're out of the nucleus. If you want to have a functional marriage you have to keep certain things like big decisions, your truest feelings, and secrets within the nucleus. Keeping secrets with your mom from your wife? Lying to your wife over and over until she feels like she's crazy? That's really hurtful and uncool. How could that be okay?   If you think you owe your mom more of yourself than your wife, you don't understand marriage, and you're going to hurt yours. You don't always have to agree with your wife, but you should always have her back. You made a commitment. You need to decide now that you know what it means if you're still up for it.  You need to get your priorities in order. You are not married to your mom. Love her, but remember to which of these women you've chosen to take a vow, chosen to call yourself ""partner."""

If he doesn't improve in how he treats me, and if his relationship with his mother doesn't become less crazy in the next six months then I will leave. He also agreed to my conditions if we stay together, and if we have children. He seems to think that a year is too long to go without seeing his family and I think that is true. However, I really only want him to stay away from his mother and oldest sister. We will see what a therapist says, but I will keep this subreddit updated.

JUSTNOMIL,3byer0,SkittlzAnKomboz,7,Fri Jul 3 21:33:15 2015 UTC,How does your husband explain all of that away to the point he's still willing to let her be near your future children?  He'd prefer to keep the abuser happy than his family safe? I'm so sorry.
JUSTNOMIL,3byer0,modecat,15,Fri Jul 3 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"He believes that it is all an accident, and that she is just absent minded. I point out the letting the boys ride down a steep hill on a cooler, and putting a LO next to a boiling pot of water/hot stove top. He thinks that as long as they aren't dead they are fine.   When he was growing up his brother was left to babysit and he was hung by overralls on a cabinet for an hour or so. He also was left to roam the streets alone, and sent with his big sister even though MIL knew she was doing drugs and having sex when she was supposed to be watching him. He thinks all of this is funny, but I think that he is lucky to be alive."
JUSTNOMIL,3byer0,fruitjerky,7,Fri Jul 3 19:09:36 2015 UTC,"My MIL did the same thing with a baby next to a boiling pot on the stove when she had an in-home daycare. Unfortunately, the baby got hurt and the parents sued the fuck out of her. Hubs has been NC with MIL for over 10 years, before we even met - what put him over the edge was the baby getting hurt. It's my understanding she still doesn't take responsibility for it or admit she did anything wrong - even though the parents won their suit and she was ordered to pay them over $300,000.   My point is you can't reason with narcissistic psychos. Your husband should not even be entertaining the idea of letting your MIL be alone with your future children. Job #1 as a parent is to protect your children as much as you can. Letting MIL have an opportunity to be alone with your future kids is laughable."

I'd never ever let her near my child.   I'd also support my SIL's and share the babysitting among all of you and leave her right the fuck out. Talk to your husband immediately and start laying ground that she will never be allowed to even be behind a close door with you two in the home with your future children.   If it's not malicious then she needs checked for dementia or Alzheimer's because that's not fucking normal at all.
JUSTNOMIL,3byer0,catnamedbear,13,Fri Jul 3 06:09:37 2015 UTC,"Well, SIL #1 is just as crazy, but thats an different issue. I had to stop watching SIL #1 kids when they started peeing in the driveway outside with a bathroom less than ten feet away, and beating up on SIL #2's kids.   Currently MIL claims to have a hormone imbalance (no alzheimers, or dementia) but she doesn't seem to take any meds and she won't see a therapist. The only reason she has this diagnosis is because DH cut contact with her until she saw a doctor."

This woman MUST be discussed about with the police or CPS, and your husband MUST remove his f*cking blinders.   If he seriously thinks there's nothing really wrong with his parents, it might be a good idea to reconsider the idea of having kids with him."

Just because OP wouldn't let her babysit doesn't mean the husband wouldn't let MIL in to see the kids while OP was away for anything. I don't even know if counseling would help though. He thinks kids getting hurt is funny because his mother/family laughed when he got hurt as a kid. How do you fix that?

I would have called the police over that. I wouldn't let this woman take My kid to the toilet, let alone babysit.

JUSTNOMIL,3byer0,wrestlegirl,12,Fri Jul 3 08:59:30 2015 UTC,"We have. His go to phrase now when his mother does something wrong is ""I realize that my parents aren't perfect, and they both have their flaws."" I love that he realizes that she isn't a saint or perfect, but it's hard to have a conversation with either of his parents because he doesn't hear what they say. He misses the backhanded compliments and the thing where they tell us to do something instead of asking. I've been looking for a new therapist.   At the moment I am trying to explain that although they invite both of us to lunches and parties they schedule them at times when they know I am at work. It has always been this way. I have switched jobs three times in three years and my hours change each time. Last year I was student teaching so my SIL and MIL scheduled their homeschool kids birthday parties at one thirty on a Friday. That way my husband could go after he got off work, but I could not. When I can attend things like Thanksgiving/Christmas SIL and MIL avoid me, and say passive aggressive things about my hair, cooking, clothes, presents to the kids etc."

There's no successful way to have that conversation. (If we say she's an alcoholic, she'll deny it. If we say we don't trust her, she will argue that she's trustworthy and start a feud.)

JUSTNOMIL,3byer0,wrestlegirl,10,Fri Jul 3 08:53:27 2015 UTC,"My FIL is a hoarder. The home he lives in is just unsafe for a child. There's mold, trash, and debris. My husband has already told him that unless he gets the house clean and safe, our son (currently 2mons) will not be going to his house. Ever.   When it comes to child safety, you may have to hurt feelings. But child safety is more important than hurt feelings. If I was in your situation, I would never allow my child to be left alone with you MIL. Never. If she asked about it, I would tell her exactly why. There's no reason to sugar coat this. It may cause hurt feelings, but at least your kid's safe."
JUSTNOMIL,3byer0,thenamefits,7,Fri Jul 3 15:03:00 2015 UTC,"This woman is not safe to watch children, and the fact that she lies and hides injuries is VERY concerning. When you have children you need to protect them from her. Shit like this is what kills children. Someone that dismisses injuries so that he/she doesn't get into trouble is the most dangerous.  I went NC with my narcissistic mother because she was abusive and reckless. She would come over reeking of cigarette smoke, when we commented on it, she dismissed our opinions, and wanted to hold my infant daughter. She's a horrible driver, she texts and drives, has a history of drinking and driving (one DUI, but I remember being in the car with her at young ages and her being drunk), and just is not suitable for watching a baby.  You need to be transparent with your husband about your concerns and come up with boundaries. I would not recommend outright laying down these rules, but politely decline when she offers to watch any children."
JUSTNOMIL,3byer0,Chronoblivion,5,Fri Jul 3 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest here. Between this post, your other post, and your comments in both threads, I would not continue in this marriage.  I'm not one to recommend that at the drop of a hat.  I'm not even one to recommend it for moderate problems that could be solved with extensive counseling.    You have a massive MIL problem and you have an equally massive husband problem.  Your MIL will not change.  Your husband continues to defend her and refuses to stand up for you and your marriage even after counseling.    How would I deal with a MIL like this and my kids?  She wouldn't be involved whatsoever.  No calls, no visits, nothing.  Not a part of my life or my kids' lives.  Zip, zilch, nada.  Nothing.  This person would not exist. And I have removed toxic members of my family from our lives for less than your MIL has done, so I'm not talking out of my ass here.  So, basically either MIL goes or you go.  None of what she does is okay or right or acceptable.  If your husband defends that shit and allows her to verbally abuse you, he's nearly as bad as her. Do not get pregnant if she is involved in your lives in any way.    And call CPS about those other poor children.  Jesus fuck."

He gaslights you, LIES TO YOU, and refuses to admit that his mother is a criminally toxic person. He's a momma's boy through and through, in the worst form, and I seriously wonder if he'll ever change, considering the iron grip she's got on him.

I have given the ultimatum already and that was two months ago. But he chose me, and cut contact for about a month and a half. It was awesome, and our marriage was awesome.

Sometimes this works out for the better (better APR, lower payments), but sometimes it doesn't.   I work for a financial institution. It's possible that she was added as a joint owner on the whole account, instead of just as a co-signer on the loan. OP have your husband contact the bank and see if that's the case. If it is, have the bank send him the paperwork needed to remove her as a joint owner on the account, but will keep her as a co-signer of the loan. If she's not a joint owner, then your husband needs to work with the bank to figure out why she can see all of the transaction history.

They told my husband I have a shopping addiction and spend too much on the dogs, and that he should divorce me, because I spend all our money and that's why we can't afford to do anything, when really we were just not choosing to spend our money on exactly what they thought we should spend it on.    It was also partly because the master bathroom was in need of a cleaning, which they had no reason to look in anyway, but I was suddenly a terrible housekeeper and living with me was unhealthy (nevermind the fact that I also work full time, supporting him when he was unemployed, and that my husband has two working hands and is perfectly capable of cleaning a bathroom himself). We didn't have time to clean it before they came to visit, but I assure you it was no worse than anyone else's bathroom has gotten.   But the money thing seriously pisses me off. They are always on their high horse about how they NEVER eat out, and they NEVER go to movies. Good for you, sounds like a boring life to me. I work hard for my money and I'll spend it how I want. Plus, I purposely over-buy when I shop online sometimes to get the free shipping, because returns are also free. My MIL also saw a set of sheets that I bought with a $50 price tag, but she didn't know that they were actually 75% off. So that was another example of my ""over spending"" that was thrown in my face. They just see things and make up their own stories about it, and refuse to even let me explain or give context, and just talk shit to my husband about it.... not to mention I shouldn't even HAVE to give context because it's none of their fucking business!! Ok, sorry, had to co-rant with you there."

Ewww  I'm glad your hubby has your back and the whole ""spite"" thing is genius. Good for him. I would let the hospital know for the birth of your LO that NO ONE is allowed into the delivery room or even the waiting room. They will do that to keep your stress low.   In fact, don't even tell them when you're getting induced or even when you go into labor. Tell them you had the kid once you've been home for a week with your baby!!"

JUSTNOMIL,3bunsk,annagarny,22,Thu Jul 2 09:55:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you're lucky you'll go into labour on Christmas eve, be in the hospital all through Christmas Day, have the baby on the 26th and not have to deal with the BS for ages!  Contact your hospital proactively and request that you be put on the 'no contact' list so that even if she calls them they can't/won't tell her that you're there. Short of coming into the maternity ward and knocking on each door in the place she won't find you.  And seconding the above advice - TAKE HER KEY AWAY. If she refuses to give it up, then the investment in changing the locks is worth it for the sanity-saving!"

There's no way in hell she should be allowed that kind of stunt. Start putting your foot down NOW whenever there's something smelly that's cooking. ""Just letting it go"" is what brought your MiL into thinking that she can do whatever she fancies and go unpunished. For kiddo n°2, give very clear and very strict instructions not only to the family but to the hospital management and nurses. If you don't want anyone bothering you until at least an hour after birth, this must be enforced at all costs.    It is not petty. It is called ""setting boundaries"" and it is absolutely vital for your and your family's sake."

JUSTNOMIL,3brrta,esmetio,2,Wed Jul 1 20:02:49 2015 UTC,Knitting needles might be better
JUSTNOMIL,3brrta,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,5,Wed Jul 1 20:25:47 2015 UTC,"Hooks would be more impressive though. And they'd stick, no getting them out if you stab with the wonky end."

JUSTNOMIL,3brrta,CrymzonDeSade,3,Fri Jul 3 17:11:41 2015 UTC,That sounds gross.
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,SerpentsDance,39,Tue Jun 30 23:29:05 2015 UTC,I would just be speechless.  I guess she doesn't want a relationship with you...  Good for FIL that he went without her though!
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,OodalollyOodalolly,22,Wed Jul 1 00:06:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The thing is she complains about how my husband never calls her, never goes over there, etc..etc..and doesn't seem to make the connection between her behavior and the way he is towards her.   I don't envy FIL when he gets home. I'm sure he'll never hear the end of it. I'm also sure she will badmouth us to all the relatives because we went ahead and had dinner without her."
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,Syrinx221,6,Wed Jul 1 00:39:58 2015 UTC,"Eff her. Seriously, that's so rude and inconsiderate."
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,Syrinx221,14,Wed Jul 1 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"I know. What also pisses me off is that her car is in the shop. When she left, she took my FIL's van. They have one other vehicle that's ancient and decrepit and barely runs, and she assumed that he wouldn't risk driving it. So when she finally called him at 7:30, she demanded to know how he got there and he said ""I guess I took the other van, didn't I?""   From that, I'm guessing that she figured he'd be stuck at home, alone, without the means to come over and have dinner with us."
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,IncredibleBulk2,8,Wed Jul 1 16:58:07 2015 UTC,"WOW. I didn't want to call her a bitch before, but now I think she's really earned it. That's so effed up! ""I'm not going, and I'm going to try to prevent you from going too.""  What, is she resentful that you all haven't invited them for dinner in years and figures she'll show you by making sure you don't invite her for another 10? WTF"
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,Syrinx221,8,Wed Jul 1 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The reason for not inviting them over before was it was a christmas eve dinner. They showed up over an hour late, MIL spent the evening telling inappropriate stories about her oldest grandson's deformed genitals (while he was in the living room), then made shitty comments to her other DIL tearing down her physical appearance (while the poor girl was very heavily pregnant, with a boy MIL was displeased about because she wanted a GIRL baby)."
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,fruitjerky,5,Wed Jul 1 18:04:35 2015 UTC,WHAT?! Who is this beast of a woman?! I'm so sorry you have to deal with this shit excuse for human behavior.
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,l-x,8,Wed Jul 1 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"Luckily I rarely have to actually deal with her. My husband's family is big on Birthday dinners, but that usually happens at a restaurant so I can have a nice buffer between me and her since my husband has a large family and birthday dinners are usually about 8-10 people. They're not huge on holidays either, so we can get away with not seeing them on Thanksgiving and maybe for an hour on Christmas. Other than that, my husband usually tries to time his visits so that his Mom is out and he can just spend time with his Dad."
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,mnh1,2,Wed Jul 1 19:30:48 2015 UTC,OH MY GOD. That's new levels of horrifying.
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,lambo1109,28,Wed Jul 1 18:11:30 2015 UTC,Go FIL!
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,ria1328,20,Wed Jul 1 01:18:07 2015 UTC,I was quite proud of him. If he hadn't come either I would have been quite upset. Especially since by that point I had made enough food for a small army (my husband and my FIL are big eaters).
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,smickles11,12,Wed Jul 1 03:04:13 2015 UTC,FIL has is priorities in order. food > tantrums.
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,luna_echo,15,Wed Jul 1 14:58:44 2015 UTC,Sounds like FIL has had enough of her games in regards to you and your family.
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,redqueenswrath,17,Wed Jul 1 02:41:24 2015 UTC,"He really does try to keep her in check. The problem is for years no one ever tried because that's ""just how she is"", but I came into the picture along with her other daughter-in-law and started fighting against that mentality. It's like suddenly my husband woke up and realized her behavior isn't normal, and my FIL realized that she's creating rifts in the family."
JUSTNOMIL,3boxm9,ligerzero459,8,Wed Jul 1 03:02:58 2015 UTC,Ahhh THAT sounds very familiar!
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,Aoibia,37,Tue Jun 30 11:34:47 2015 UTC,My MIL addresses all mail to me with her last name - meaning I have had to argue with the clerk to actually pick up packages before because my id doesn't match.  It's extra weird since I'm gay and married to her daughter... Why would it be me to change my name anyway?!  It's been 7 years and she will not let it go.
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,doriangreypants,15,Tue Jun 30 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"Mine sends mail to me.. Using my husbands last name. I kind of see it as her being nice and accepting of me? I try to benefit of the doubt it.   I know they are getting on him to change my last name because we are coming on a year and I haven't changed it or anything... And he's asking. Fact is, I really like my last name and the flow. I don't see the importance behind changing it. Nothing personal."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,Throwmeawaycoco,8,Tue Jun 30 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"It's weird how hung up people get on the name changing. I changed mine, but that's just because my husband's name is cooler; my maiden name was Smith, so I was like ""hell yeah, a cool name!"" But if his name had been something just as common or something weird like Wiener, I would've stuck with Smith. (JK, I would love having a goofy last name like Wiener.)"
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,queen_crow,4,Wed Jul 1 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"So I really love my last name.. like REALLY love it. My husband has a lot of pride in his last name too... he definitely wants me to change it but we keep pushing it off because I'm hesitant. I mean we are already married.. why does the name change matter so much? My name flows.   I will eventually change it I think.. I just need more time. I don't like the idea of a hyphen either... my first name is 6 letters and my last name is 8 letters. My husbands last name is also 8 letters... pretty lengthy to hyphenate that shit. Plus his last name is mexican.. nothing wrong there.. he's not even mexican though and I'm like the whitest chick ever so when people see it they are usually put off by it. I know that's wrong but my first name isn't a ""white"" name either so I mean it just looks weird. I feel like by changing my last name I am giving up part of my identity.. racially and in general. (Racially isn't meant in a racist way if it comes off that way. It's hard to explain). I love my signature.. I love my last name. I always get compliments on how exotic it sounds and how pretty it is. I feel like by changing my last name, I'm also changing my first in a sense. It's hard to explain and something I will have to get over.. and that I will eventually get over. I just need more time. I'm pretty sure I would feel this way whether his last name was Rodriguez or Johnson. I'm changing something that has been mine my entire life. It's hard.   I think it's great that you changed yours and were happy to do so. I actually think Smith is a cool name in a mysterious type of way. I'm sure once I finally do it, I'll be happy I did it. I've been thinking about doing it just to avoid complications (you two have different last names, are you really married?, that's unconventional, we don't want to rent to you. etc<has happened)... I just can't bring myself to the court house and we already rented a place so fuck it."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,Throwmeawaycoco,6,Thu Jul 2 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"I definitely didn't mean you when I said I don't know why people make a big deal of it! I meant the people who get upset someone else isn't changing their name - I should've been more clear! If you like your name and want to keep it, you should. I would have! But if you do decide to change it you can take your maiden as a middle name; that's what my mom did."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,queen_crow,5,Thu Jul 2 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"I knew what you meant. To be honest, today was a rough day so I guess I unloaded."

JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,baconandbacardi,74,Tue Jun 30 11:57:45 2015 UTC,"She told us because she casually mentioned in passing the following week that ""I mean I even went to the city office and try to change it as a gift for you. But the advisor said there was absolutely no way, even though I told her I was the mother to your husband.""  I have honestly never encountered anyone so overbearing in my life. If my friends didn't know her themselves they'd think I was making half the things up."

My husband has struggled with me not changing my name and I know his parents talk shit about it behind my back but I would cut a bitch if my MIL even thought about this.

JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,LadyOfSighs,35,Tue Jun 30 12:20:47 2015 UTC,"My husband has grown up with her his whole life, so he's desensitized and doesn't really know how interfering she is being. My mum's a therapist, so has seen a lot, yet can't bear to be in her company for any great length of time.   When my husband and I were dating I broke up with him for a month because I didn't think the relationship could work if he had someone so interfering as a mother."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,Elda30,24,Tue Jun 30 12:43:07 2015 UTC,"Ok but what about you? How did you react??  Had it been me, the whole restaurant would have witnessed the shitstorm. Literally."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,ohfluffit,17,Tue Jun 30 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"Mmmmhhhmmm. My husband doesn't know any better, having grown up with the overbearing behavior. They're just used to it. Any thoughts on how we can help them get better at drawing boundaries? My husband and I went to therapy, and it was helpful having a third (professional) party explain how a lot of his parents' behaviors were inappropriate."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,Elda30,6,Tue Jun 30 14:31:26 2015 UTC,Related- can you tell me how you got your husband to this step?  My husband still needs to see the light!
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,ohfluffit,12,Tue Jun 30 16:57:33 2015 UTC,"Do you mean, how did I get him to therapy? Basically things had gotten so bad between us ( I had a LOT of justifiable anger towards his parents) that I told him my therapist had recommended we see someone together. Like, literally, if he didn't try it I would have filed for divorce. He was open to it but it exposed a lot of pain that we're continuing to work through. He has gotten better at drawing boundaries for his mother (like, ""please don't walk into our house and start cleaning"" or ""I know you didn't mean to hurt wife with what you just said but it was pretty insensitive"") but he's not perfect. Neither am I. :)"

I never realized how passive aggressive my mother could be until i started seeing it through my wife's eyes.  Oh man can she be manipulative.  I hope your husband has your back when it comes to dealing with her!  She's ridiculous!"
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,ProfSnugglesworth,9,Tue Jun 30 15:51:08 2015 UTC,"That's how my husband was. It wasn't until he started spending less time around her and more time around my Mom that he started to realize how badly his mother behaved. He had been convinced that it was his duty as her son to stay with his parents and pay bills because they'd raised him, so it was his responsibility to repay them for it.   When he moved out and moved in with me his mother gave him endless guilt trips about how they'd be poor and living in the streets without him. It's been several years now and guess what? Somehow they've managed to survive without him. He also has little tolerance for her now and will often times just cut a conversation short or walk away from her if she's being crazy."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,ohfluffit,2,Tue Jun 30 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"My parents tried to do something similar with me, and tried to guilt me into a few times-:""we can't afford to have you stay in X"" - well good thing I've been paying my own bills, rent, and taxes; or ""we need help paying our bills and it'd be a big help if..."" - yes, let me break a lease, and move to an area where I'd need a car and there's no jobs locally. They've gotten better about it in the past few years, but I'm still worried about it as I've been working with my dad.

My mother, my wife's MIL, is an incredible narcissist. My family all has various ailments from it. My dad has gotten violent in the past, and again recently (I suspect my mom frustrates him to the point of losing it, although that does not justify nor expunge him).  For the sake of myself and my wife, I broke off all contact with my parents, and have limited contact with some of my siblings.   We're the better for it. It's rough on me, at times (I feel guilty, and I feel as though I should have a ""good family""). But it's worth it in the long run. Perhaps they'll change and heal. Perhaps they won't.

JUSTNOMIL,3bmddd,yw1,10,Tue Jun 30 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"I think you did the right thing.   For a great while, I was under the impression that because we are related, it is okay for my family to belittle and abuse me. It's a free for all because family is family.  Well guess what.. Eventually I realized that my ""family"" isn't so great. I never felt that warm fuzzy feeling. So I made a new family. I have friends that I have had for years and their families know me and love my kids. Family doesn't have to be blood and i refuse to allow anyone to bring me down. Poison is poison.   My mom started being poison again.. Such a bummer because we were actually doing good for a change... So without any debate- I cut her off. I'm happier and questioning everything a lot less. She constantly would tell me to divorce my husband because men will screw you over and if I got into a little argument with my husband my mom would especially push for me to leave him ... Even though she swears she loves him. My step son is difficult so of course I should leave my husband for that. My husband stained his shirt.. Let's divorce!! For christs sake she was ridiculous. She visited and then did everything in her power, failing miserably, to put me down and laugh in my face at my pathetic life as just being a wife. I started counseling and my therapist flat said... My mother and I have an unhealthy relationship and no where does it say that I have to allow her manipulation and humiliation in my life. (I needed to hear this because I was debating apologizing for telling her... In an email... That I needed space and listing what she did... Because it's not obvious and I'm just being 'sensitive' and 'irrational'.) So... Like the horrible daughter I am, I never called to apologize for being a crappy daughter and not allowing her to treat me this way. I'm better for it in so many ways. The past two months have been so nice. :) My husband and I have been better than ever."

I don't know if she's capable of that or not, but I always think about worst case. lol  Plus, the reason I made sure I had a different practice was because right after I got married, I got the flu. Bad enough I needed antibiotics, I went to my husband's doctor since it was closer. My MIL has been using that office for 30+ years. Not only did they accidentally bring out her file (we have the same name, my middle name is different, but our first and last names are the same) but I found out that she called up and talked to one of the nurses she's friends with to find out about my illness. Now, it wasn't like I was hiding anything, but it's none of her damn business why I went to see a doctor. It burns her up that all of my doctors are now at a practice that she thinks is too far away. (I also delivered both of my children at the hospital there since my OB's office is in the same parking lot.)   Last time I took my husband in for a nasty bug, his doctor said, ""PLEASE don't tell your mother when you're ill or when you come see me. She calls me nonstop to ask what meds you should be on or to find out what treatment I provided. I don't tell her, but the calls won't stop."""
JUSTNOMIL,3bmvo0,Syrinx221,24,Tue Jun 30 14:56:02 2015 UTC,"The fact that she called her friend to get your medical info is not cool. In fact, with hipaa, I think it might be illegal. Like, that nurse could and probably should lose her job illegal. It's not about whether or not you were trying to hide anything either."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmvo0,SkittlzAnKomboz,20,Tue Jun 30 16:52:28 2015 UTC,It's super-crazy illegal. The nurse friend could absolutely lose her job over this.
JUSTNOMIL,3bmvo0,Trishlovesdolphins,9,Tue Jun 30 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"The problem is that she didn't tell me the name of the nurse. This was about 13 years ago, I called the office and told them what happened and that I wouldn't be returning to the office for any medical treatment, even if it was just for a cold and they were closer. I even told my husband's doctor about it. That's when he told us she'll call if she thinks my husband should be seen."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmvo0,Syrinx221,4,Tue Jun 30 17:19:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, that sucks! I think I'd have been sorely tempted to escalate things by calling an attorney, just to make a point.   So not cool."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmvo0,brmoraisinsdelight,7,Wed Jul 1 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, in what universe does she think that is acceptable behaviour? How would she feel if you were doing the same back and getting info on her menopause drugs or shit like that?  This kind of thing would make me be even more secretive and private about stuff!"
JUSTNOMIL,3bmvo0,ProfessorMMcGonagall,28,Tue Jun 30 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"Just tell her you've decided not to find out until the baby is born!   I think MILs forget that the questions they are asking is also private health information and they are not entitled to know any of it. Just be prepared.  It sounds like your MIL is the type who will say ""I don't care if I see your boobs and vagina on display, it won't bother me!"" when arguing that she should be in the delivery room.  Not even stopping to consider that maybe, just maybe, you have a right to decide who sees you all exposed.  I mean -- it's not like my mother would ever ask to be present for my husband's vasectomy or colonoscopy."

We found out the gender for our first at the doctors office and for the second we had him put the gender in an envelope and then did a reveal party. Both times were very emotional for me. I wish, in retrospect, that I had found out the gender of my second child with just my husband and then done a reveal for the rest of family and friends. It was very overwhelming for me, especially as everyone is looking at the parents for their reaction.   Btw, boundaries with your MIL now. People get even crazier towards the big show at the end. I very explicitly told my family and my in-laws we did NOT want anyone at the hospital until our first was born. NO ONE listened and it stressed me the fuck out while I was in labor. Second time around we didn't tell anyone what was happening until after our daughter was born. It made everything much easier for us."
JUSTNOMIL,3bmvo0,a_jill_sandwich,6,Tue Jun 30 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"We found out and then told everyone we were doing a gender revel at the shower and only my friends baking the cake knew.

I have been a grade early all of my life so I went in a year early also, but I'm not finishing until after I turn 22, which I still see as awesome because that's the expected age.

Not being mean but I am thinking given how much excitement they must have had on you going early and getting such great grades, they must have been disappointed that you got so close but did not graduate. If you are planning on finishing, I would let them know. Appreciate their disappointment as it does stem from wanting the best for you - college means good job potentials which means more money for you and yours (in most some situations). I say this as my mum was the same. She never finished her masters as she was pregnant and although she didnt regret it then, she did later on. Its why she was so desperate for us to finish our education without distractiond."

JUSTNOMIL,3bkl5n,kitush,6,Tue Jun 30 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"IF OP plans on finishing her degree?  She's taken no leave of absence and has one class left.  She's 21.  Taking an extra semester to graduate isn't the end of the world or even notable if anything extra happened in college (study abroad, marriage, childbirth, working).  Unless OP's parents are paying for the last class, they have nothing to say about when and how OP finishes her degree.  Going so far as to lecture, guilt trip, and attempt to shame OP for being a class short after a complicated pregnancy is absurd.  She didn't take any time off, and is still a year ahead of the vast majority of her peers."
JUSTNOMIL,3bkl5n,mnh1,3,Tue Jun 30 12:36:08 2015 UTC,Some people choose not to go back due to other pressures. You can't assume people will go back to college just because they have one class left. Alot can happen  They were being absurd by their guilt tripping but they are allowed to be disappointed quietly away from op.

But I can't help but think she purposely does that? If that makes sense.   With DD, I did kind of a Totoro theme (more foresty than anything, but yeah) and she kept sending pictures of crib sets that SHE liked, and she eventually sent something that had nothing to do with my theme. She even asked if I liked them, and I kept saying if she was going to get it to do a forest theme one (which I could SEE in the display next to whatever she was looking at). Drove me bananas.

We were super low contact with hubs' parents before and now that I'm preg my MIL is constantly calling, emailing, texting bc I'm a vessel for her latest obsession/reason to shop. Hubs and I are totally overwhelmed.   ""Do you want your bassinet?"" No... Why do you even have that thing? It's fucking 32 years old. ""Do you want your old sock monkey and Jack in the box?"" ... The FUCK?! No!  I made the mistake of trying to be nice and sent her a pic of the baby's room thus far.  She starts frantically texting ""do you need a lamp?"" ""Do you have a changing table?"" ""What else do you need for the room?"" We have a damn registry and none of that is on it. Cuz I have it and/or don't need it! Stop snooping through the photo and trying to see what's missing!  We keep reminding her we have a registry and under strict circumstances do not want anything off registry or anything old of hubs. (You have to be really strict to the point of almost mean with her). So what happens??  4 boxes of shit arrive at my house pre baby shower. About 50 items of hubs' old as ffucckkkkk baby clothes all stained and pilled. Nothing from the registry, just a bunch of random baby junk from Ross and TJ Maxx. To be fair, she has bought us stuff from our registry, but she continues to buy us MUCH MORE random junk than that, and we just throw it away or donate. We get several boxes from her every few weeks. It's really exhausting.   The other day she texted about a hat she was knitting for the baby. Wool hat. He's due in August and we live in Texas. I haven't needed a single item of wool clothing in Texas in my entire life. I've already donated most of the stuff she's given me and I guess this next shipment with hat included will be one of the many goodwill drop offs.

JUSTNOMIL,3bkc8e,cassiopeia1280,3,Wed Jul 8 04:17:07 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the gift thing,  my Mil will ask hubby what he wants for his birthday and then gives him something completely random - usually vouchers for a shop we don't go to because it's really expensive,  and the voucher will never be enough to buy anything. It's so frustrating.   I think to keep yourself sane just let her buy what she wants and then either put it away or sell it. When she buys him heaps of gifts don't give them to him. I know friends of mine who put them away and give them to him when he's being rewarded for something. Apparently they let him open the gifts and then when he's distracted,  they will pop it away. Because there's so much he doesn't even notice. And then when he's being rewarded for something he gets something new to play with. It's your home,  your son,  your rules. If she complains, just say 'well we did tell you not to get that' there will likely be so much that she won't notice either. I suspect my mother will be a bit like this - not ignoring what we need,  she will get things we actually want,  but i think she will get all sorts of other stuff on top of that which will be a pain, but hey,  it's her grandchild I figure let her enjoy the experience. She seems to be pretty good with my brothers kids as hes blunt and will tell her not to do stuff and if she does he will say exactly what I said to say above - so thankfully he's done all the hard work for us.  Hubbies mother on the other hand. Ugh. I don't even want her near our kids either. I think she will break all the rules we decide on. I don't trust her at all. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. I think I'm likely to stop caring and be blunt like my brother is because my kids more important than her feelings if she's going to do things that we have requested she doesn't do. I'm like you,  having a child should be a wonderful time and I desperately want one,  but I'm also dreading the aspect of having to deal with Mil.

Your MIL needs to realize that she's the extended family now. Her son has a new family in you and your baby and unlike when he was younger, she won't come first when it comes to holidays etc. What she seems to not understand is that she won't get her cake and eat it too, in an extended family you can't always all be together cause there are too many people to consider. My mother has 1 child with a German SO and one with a British one and one who's single. Christmas before last they spent with just their middle son because the rest of us were with our partners families. Last year, we were all home, changing it from 3 of them to 12. This year, it might be 3 of them again and I've invited them to come to England to stay with us if that's the case. MIL has had a standing invite to join us in Sweden every year we've gone. (she never has)  Could you invite her to come for a delayed  Christmas if it's so important to her to spend actual Christmas at home? I know the specific date matters to some people but to me it feels like if you're all together, with a tree and presents and Christmas food does it really matter that it's a few days/weeks off?"
JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,Ilezreb,9,Mon Jun 29 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of hoping she'd be willing to do a delayed one and come out for a week. She's in education too so she has the time off. I've been dealing with split families my whole life, my mom is French and moved to the States with my dad when my brother was two. We only had two Christmases with her parents (who were amazing) and my dad's whole family is scattered all over the U.S.  I don't feel like I should have to compromise more just because I'm used to it. But I'm definitely bringing up the idea that she comes out right after, I do like that compromise."
JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,Yourwtfismyftw,5,Mon Jun 29 23:30:31 2015 UTC,For a second I thought you meant you had siblings with parents Europe then got to the end of the sentence and did a double take.
JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,asian_by_marriage,3,Tue Jun 30 10:59:57 2015 UTC,"You're right, that sentence reads really weirdly. I typed my whole message over half an hours time so I must have gotten confused :P What I mean is, my oldest brother (full sibling, I guess it reads like he's my half brother?) has a girlfriend who's German. I have a boyfriend who's English, and our middle brother is single. :)"

JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,followthepost-its,7,Tue Jun 30 11:55:29 2015 UTC,"My MIL is Vietnamese.  My husband grew up without any kind of actual Christmas traditions because this wasn't a holiday celebrated in Vietnam.  My in-laws immigrated to the States in the 70's and really tried to adopt Western culture, but holidays are something that they never really got the hang of.  My MIL's expectations of how Christmas is supposed to go are all pretty much what she's seen from watching Christmas movies.  This has lead to so many emotional break downs from her around the holidays because she's expecting some magical made-for-tv moment that never happens, which in turn leads to some blow out fights where she talks about how she's such a victim, followed by her dramatically sitting in a dark room crying by herself, waiting for everyone to ask her what's wrong.    Both my DH and SIL married American, and both of our families have traditions.  Cue MIL demanding her own suddenly very important traditions which were non-existent.  She's decided that she wants EVERYONE to spend the night at her house together for the holidays.  Granted, she's looking for one night together as a family.  The problem is that she's more on the hoarder side of messy and there really isn't anywhere for guests to sleep comfortably.    My DH laid down the law with her this year and said that there's no reason for us to spend the night since we live within 15 miles of her, and it was important for her to realize that we'll have a new baby this year which meant that we wanted to start our own family traditions.  She's not really thrilled with that answer, but she's looking into alternative dates for everyone to get together."
JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,cordsniper,7,Tue Jun 30 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"She says, and I kid you not, ""she can stay home, you just fly out with the baby.""   WHAT THE HELL?????   My husband insisted she was just joking around   Taking into account everything else you told us, I'm sorry but she sounded totally serious."
JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,RememberYourPass,6,Tue Jun 30 10:14:37 2015 UTC,"I love Christmas but Christmas with mil is hit and miss. She expects to have everyone over on Christmas day despite extended family to consider, wants us to sleep over but there is no where for us to sleep except the floor and her house is too small for the number of guests so my husband and wife eat in the second shift which sucks cause I do all the cooking."

JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,Ilovegoku11,6,Tue Jun 30 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'm due the day after you!   I do not plan to travel for Christmas.

If EXTENDED family want to come visit early January, they are welcomed, but everyone must be up to date with their shots and be healthy.   My parents and in-laws are having a hard time understanding that they are extended family now, more so because this will be the first grandbaby on both sides."
JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,Syrinx221,4,Tue Jun 30 14:38:40 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel, but it has worked out better for us.   We have recently moved away from my family, and to the same city as SO's family. Our daughter is due in late Sept so will be about 3mos at Christmas, so that makes travelling a little easier. There is no WAY I'd be flying with a 3 week old. Or wanting to leave my damn house, no doubt.   I put my foot right down and said that we're going home to my family for Christmas this year, even though we were with them last year too (and SO's the one before).   My family does big, extended family Christmases. They are way more of a big deal for my family than for his. Our kid will be approx 12 weeks old so will have had at least some vaccinations. Most of my family won't have met the baby before we come up for Christmas. It is my parents' first grandchild. SO has been very supportive of this all along. I think his dad is a bit disappointed, but his dad will get to see the kid all the time. Every week. Maybe more. So I don't really care how he feels about it.   Only complication is that SO's mother wants to fly in from overseas for Christmas, specifically to meet the new baby. So he's put it out there that we won't be here and left it at that. Not my problem if she chooses not to listen.   Your MIL sounds awfully self obsessed. As if she would have wanted to be separated from her 3 week old child when your husband was born!!!"
JUSTNOMIL,3bk4pw,originakk,12,Tue Jun 30 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"she can stay home, you just fly out with the baby.   You say that you married into a great family but damn, that is such a self-absorbed and blatantly stupid comment.  What was her reaction after your husband told her no?"

You can be a tough person to please.""  MIL turns to me and says ""but tell them, I'm a great MIL!"" Her awesome friend didn't even give me time to panic, jumps right in and basically says what the fuck are you thinking asking statmama a question like that? There's no way she'll answer honestly!

A is the sort who brings a new girl home every 6 months and B is soooo committed. So she has a lot of hope for them, but is worried about us.

But there's just no reasoning with her. ANYWAY. She is so opposed to us renting that when she comes to our apartment -that we've lived in for two years- she calls it ""the lady's apartment"" (the woman being my landlord, who she doesn't know or hasn't met and only knows its even a woman from something I mentioned)   So we get things like ""oh goodness!

JUSTNOMIL,3bjdxt,notenoughbooks,0,Tue Jun 30 23:12:29 2015 UTC,"1) Got pregnant with #2 when #1 was only 4 months old. Specifically stated she did not know you could get pregnant while breastfeeding. o.O While it works for some people I thought this was widely known to be a fairly unreliable form of birth control.   I've read some pretty good sources stating it's a decent form of birth control (almost as effective as condoms, which granted have their limitations) for the first little while as long as certain breastfeeding practices are followed (specifically, feeding frequently and not missing any feedings). So, personally I think the opinion is reasonable. However, it doesn't mean you can't get pregnant while breastfeeding and it shouldn't have been so surprising to her.    3) Takes no medication like for headaches or colds. Because of growing up like this husband never takes anything either and just complains the whole time he has a cold. If I get a cold I'm over that shit in a few days. Alka-seltzer cold is the bomb! His cold lingers for weeks.   Personally, I find that cold medicines draw out my illness a lot longer. I'll still take them if I'm feeling miserable enough, because in that case I'd rather be less sick for longer, but it's not unreasonable for me to avoid them.    4) Gives people amoxicillin for everything. Gave my husband a pack to take for a cough. I flipped my shit when I found this out. Its a cough! What is an antibiotic going to do?! If you want something for it, go to the doctor and make sure you are taking the right kind of medicine!   Yeah, this is a problem.   How does she even get the amoxicillin to anyone sans prescription? Not cool.   Even if it is bacterial, amoxicillin isn't necessarily the right antibiotic. I mean it's broad-spectrum, but there's stuff it just won't touch.

Right after our rehearsal she bailed we couldn't find her for ages. She sent her drunk daughter to yell at me in the middle of a small argument with my husband. The drunk daughter then tells me I'm stealing their son and that I'm ruining his life etc etc.  I was pretty upset, then my maid of honour finds me and tells me she had lunch with MIL that day and MIL confided in her and said she didn't really think I loved DH.  I get back to my room - reeling and find her there waiting for me. She then proceeds for the next 3 hours (until 2 am) to tell me that she doesn't know if I love her son and tearing apart the last 6 months of bs, like every little thing that has gone wrong and how it was my fault. Including the fact that she thinks I'm a bad mom (my 3 month old daughter at the time who is completely fine and healthy) because I didn't breast feed - another horror story in itself.   After this I was reasonably pissed off but tried to calm her down because she threatened not to come to the ceremony. My wedding day was horrifically awkward. I've never wanted a day to end so badly in my life. Her and FIL made the most passive aggressive speeches. I ended up telling DH what was happening in the middle of dinner quietly because he was so lost. He was obviously upset.  We ended up back in our hotel room for our baby free wedding night and just cried about the whole thing. I told him I kept the peace to save the wedding for him but I would not be making any extra effort when it came to her. I would do what he asked of me so he didn't suffer but no more than that. He agreed that was fine.   At the airport she then says ""look, everything turned out fine!""   I just smiled and left to go home. She didn't think I'd tell DH for some reason. And the more and more I thought about how horrible she made my wedding day for us, the more I realized I was mad.  She expected i'd be kissing her ass when we got back but I was not - I didn't talk to her at all.  I wasn't mean, just didn't talk to her. She lives 5 hours away so we don't see each other which is fine by me   She then told me and DH that I was ""tearing her apart"" because I was upset at what she'd done.

JUSTNOMIL,3bjbq7,a_jill_sandwich,17,Mon Jun 29 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"My FIL wants us all to go camping in the next few weeks with my SIL and her brood: a 1 y.o., a nearly 3 y.o., one teenager (whom SIL doesn't let watch the younger kids), possibly her husband (who is constantly working); my SO, our 2 y.o., and our currently 3 week old; and of course MIL. I love FIL and MIL, but FIL especially is out of touch at times with kids (just last week he told me that he gave my son mountain dew because he couldn't find our juice boxes....not like we didn't have milk or that water is also perfectly acceptable!)  I know FIL is excited, and I do love camping, but I am not bringing our newborn. While there's at least shower and restroom facilities, we'd be in tents and looking at least at 4 adults, a toddler, and a newborn sharing a tent. Dealing with toddlers running wild and a newborn in a tent....pass. SO can take our son, but I am sitting this one out. When FIL first suggested the camping trip for July, I did remind him my due date was June 30th (lil' girl came 3+ weeks early after all), so he was thinking I'd be taking a 2 week old or so baby AND I'd still be recovering....ugh. Love the man, but sometimes he just doesn't get it."
JUSTNOMIL,3bjbq7,ProfSnugglesworth,11,Mon Jun 29 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"That is kind of where my MIL is at. She hasn't been a mom to a tiny human in decades so I think she forgot what it is like. I'm not holding it against her, but I'm still over here like O_o."
JUSTNOMIL,3bjbq7,a_jill_sandwich,8,Mon Jun 29 23:12:04 2015 UTC,"Hell, I haven't taken care of a newborn for only 2 years and I'd forgotten stuff. It's only now that we're expecting our second that we're remembering how tough it was."
JUSTNOMIL,3bjbq7,Moma4,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:34:59 2015 UTC,"Between the decades since his own kids were born and that he wasn't around much when they were babies (working constantly), he's learning and relearning a lot. He was a big help with our first born, as I went back to work immediately and he offered to watch our son as he is now retired. He's been doing great, but every now and then he'll do things that make me face palm (the mountain dew)."
JUSTNOMIL,3bjbq7,dregaron,10,Tue Jun 30 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"Ugh, my husband was the same about germs. His attitude was ""well, we can't keep him from them"". No, you can't, but that doesn't mean you have to invite them in.  My inlaws had gastro a week after my son was born, and they called one day saying ""oh we're okay now, we haven't had any problems since yesterday"". I told my husband that no, they couldn't come over since they could still be carrying something (family members who don't live with them had it, so it was definitely a bug and not something they ate). I asked my husband if he wanted to be taking care of a newborn between running to the bathroom, or worse back in hospital with the baby on a drip because he couldn't keep anything down? That put a stop to it.  I also want to mention that my Chinese neighbour was telling me that typically they don't take newborns out or around big crowds until the baby is at least 6 weeks old. She was surprised to see me out and about with him when he was 3 weeks.  I can guarantee you that not all of those 40 people will be vaccinated (or up to date on them) which is another huge reason not to go."
JUSTNOMIL,3bjbq7,Ilovegoku11,12,Tue Jun 30 00:26:21 2015 UTC,I had two of my babies end up in the hospital with RSV as newborns the youngest twice! That was just from being around school aged siblings that weren't even sick! You don't want to expose your precious baby to anything like that especially if she's small. Luckily mine all came out of it ok but I know at least one mother that had a baby in the hospital at the same time as mine wasn't so lucky. It's better to be safe than sorry.

He doesnt think germs and people handling her are such a big deal but he isnt arguing with me on it either. I think he knows its a fight he wont win. He was just as WTF as me about the whole camping thing though."
JUSTNOMIL,3bjbq7,trublood,6,Mon Jun 29 19:42:56 2015 UTC,My friend was going camping with a 1 year old (also a 7 year old and 2 teenagers) in a tent. That sounded like the worst thing I had ever heard until this.
JUSTNOMIL,3bjbq7,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,-8,Tue Jun 30 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"It's not for everyone, but we took our newborn camping when she was 5 weeks old. However, we own a camper with air conditioning, a bed, and hot water so it still had all the comforts of home. Germs are nothing if you are breastfeeding because the baby is getting your antibodies. But if you just don't want to go, that's different. Tent camping with a baby is only for people who do it a lot and are accustomed to the routine of tent life."

She's doing all the hard work though!""  No shit, and they weren't talking to YOU? I just. No. She'd also give updates that I never gave her. Like saying things ""She says baby is about the size of a cabbage and is kicking her ribs."" I'd even respond with ""When did I say that?"" (Never.)   I was 2 weeks late with DD, and I was constantly getting texts from MIL asking how things were going. If I'd had the baby yet. Turned into, 3 am texts, ""Baby check...""  Eventually I stopped replying, but I didn't want that shit at 3am (MIL is on Eastern time, but even then, there it's 6am!)

Most people got the hint, but MIL was still texting away.   Yeah, the wait sucks! I mean I wasn't doing ANYTHING, and I was HUGE. I kept getting stuff in the mail from things with free samples, and one was some formula with a note that was like ""Congrats on your new baby!"" and she wasn't even born yet.

Ahahaha, this makes me think of what my MIL did this weekend. My BIL's girlfriend is pregnant, it was a surprise pregnancy, and my BIL wouldn't be one to share a whole lot about the pregnancy anyway. I was with my inlaws this weekend, and MIL was looking at her phone and going ""(BIL) and (girlfriend's) baby is already growing hair! And his brain is developing its senses already!"" And I said ""Is he texting you that??"" and she said ""No, I have one of those apps! I just texted him!""  And I just had to internally laugh, (but also cry because this will be me one day) because I'm certain that BIL absolutely hates being inundated with texts about his baby's development from his mom. And I really have to wonder if his girlfriend is annoyed as shit by it. I saw her a couple weeks ago, and asked if MIL had been behaving well, and she said yes but that she also doesn't have her phone number, so BIL was likely just not telling her about the many texts she knew must be happening, and I said ""KEEP IT THAT WAY."" I was so right."
JUSTNOMIL,3bddnv,fruitjerky,3,Mon Jun 29 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha. Oh gawd. Pretty sure my mom had it too, because it was always that kinda stupid comment week to week. Kinda creepy.

The thing that pissed me off to no end is when my Narcissist Sister-in-law commented ""this will really be true come december"". It made me wonder if I'm not qualified as a mother. Do I possess zero good qualities? And besides, WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT THE GENDER YET. There is an equal chance this baby could be a boy.  UGH. Why do people feel they need to devalue us a Mothers?

She is 16 and the biggest manipulator, liar, envious, jealous person I know. I don't trust her at ALL. But because she has [semi-controlled] epilepsy, my MIL has never reprimanded her or called her out on her bullshit.   For example: during the week leading up to our wedding, my SIL expressed to me: ""this is irritating. Everything is about YOU."" Like, duh, bitch, its my wedding... I'm the bride? But then she proceeds to have NINE ""episodes"" of epilepsy within the 5 days. They were bullshit and fake, I knew it, my husband knew it. But my MIL did not believe us when we told her they were faked. Not until I made my SIL tell her herself. And even then, she didn't get in trouble.   Because of this, she is NOT to be around my son alone or unsupervised. And due to the fact that my MIL fails to see her daughters wacked tendencies, I can't trust her to see through her daughters bullshit. If my SIL did something to my son out of jealousy or to get attention (which, in my heart I don't find out of the realm of possibility), I will have a fight with my MIL. I just know it.

Now she's doing the same thing with my pregnancy. She's 21, knows better, and never gets reprimanded for anything. Instead, she is characterized as being ""misunderstood"". That's just ""how she reaches out to people.""    My husband and I are in the process of forming ground rules for her for when this baby comes. If I had it my way (and I might, if things get even worse with her), she wouldn't be at the hospital when the baby is born. As it stands right now, she and the baby will not be alone together unless either my husband or I are with them. She is scarily obsessed with my baby. She keeps commenting cryptic stuff like this is her ""once chance"" and she will have an ""extra special relationship"" with the baby. I know under normal this wouldn't be concerning, but it worries me. I'm terrified she is going to do something to my child to get attention once it's here."

JUSTNOMIL,3baqny,Syrinx221,3,Sat Jun 27 18:49:01 2015 UTC,So true. It just speaks to the lack of education around breastfeeding.
JUSTNOMIL,3baqny,suagrupp,13,Sun Jun 28 00:48:25 2015 UTC,"That's just what a new mum and baby need as they're both learning to breastfeed!   I'm from the UK and it's widely agreed that breast is best, my mum breastfed us too. My mil was a bit funny about breastfeeding but I think it's because she couldn't do it herself (inverted nipples in case you needed to know!!) so firstly feels the mummy guilt of gasp formula feeding despite her 3 adult children being healthy and happy and secondly never having learnt the 'rules' around breastfeeding (on demand, for as long as they want, offering the second breast etc) she didn't really understand. Mil was never negative about me breastfeeding, just a bit caught up in her own hang ups to be supportive.   Good on you for rising above her extremely rude commentary on your tits, if you can keep your cool with this then you're a natural for all the joys of motherhood!"
JUSTNOMIL,3baqny,brmoraisinsdelight,9,Sat Jun 27 16:43:35 2015 UTC,In our prenatal breastfeeding class they taught us that inverted nipples wouldn't prevent a woman from breastfeeding.

Goodness, gracious, no!! 😃   I've no idea what the breastfeeding help and advice was like over 30 years ago so they might not have helped her with it or they tried and it still didn't work for them?"
JUSTNOMIL,3baqny,brmoraisinsdelight,5,Sat Jun 27 19:08:17 2015 UTC,"The problem with inverted nipples is that it's much harder to tell if the baby is getting enough... the baby can look like it's latched perfectly, but if the mom is new to the whole idea she may not know how to count wet diapers to see if the baby is well hydrated and the baby may not gain enough weight. SO inverted nipples do not necessarily mean breastfeeding will fail, but in my personal opinion, there needs to be more time spent educating these moms and close close follow up is necessary while breastfeeding is getting established. I worked under an LC and she was almost terrified of inverted nipples because sometimes, you just run out of tricks in your hat and there's nothing you can do to force this baby to thrive on exclusive breastfeeding... and she's seen sick, sick babies due to inverted nipples (and lack of education and follow up!)"

JUSTNOMIL,3baqny,suagrupp,7,Sun Jun 28 00:41:25 2015 UTC,The stress of her pestering you can't be good for the baby.  Could your husband keep his mother from visiting so often?  Or you could feed the baby in a different room.  (Or make her go to a different room?)

JUSTNOMIL,3ba1lp,hocus-pocus-ocracy,28,Sat Jun 27 05:34:39 2015 UTC,"My in-laws booked their trip out to visit us so that they would arrive the day after my due date with my first baby, without confirming with us that those dates were okay. I had previously told them I wasn't sure how I would feel about visitors within the first few weeks after the birth. Their trip was for 2 weeks. We offered to pay the rebooking fee, they said it was not possible to reschedule since they had to be in the area for other, unavoidable reasons. So we ""established some ground rules"" such as visits would be short, they would check ahead of time whether it was okay to come visit, and if we needed them to leave they would leave without making a fuss. They agreed.   Then I went 9 days overdue and spent 2 days in the hospital (during which we did not want visitors), so they only had a few days remaining to see their new grandchild and I guess to them that meant the ground rules got thrown out the window. My husband was feeling overwhelmed when we were about to head home from the hospital and asked if I would be okay with his mom staying the night at our place to help out, and we compromised on her staying for the afternoon and evening and then going home at nighttime. But I was going to be topless breastfeeding and we were having trouble latching so it involved a lot of grabbing my boobs this way and that to try to get my son to latch, so I wasn't really comfortable with his dad staying all afternoon and evening too, so we asked if his mom could stay longer to help but that his dad stay for the (previously agreed-upon) short visit only. Well, this did not go over well at all. His dad got super offended and didn't even want to stay for a short visit, and when we asked if they could help us out in a couple days by driving us to the first newborn checkup we got a ""maybe, we might have dinner plans that day"". His mom was angry that we hurt his dad's feelings and it was very uncomfortable with her around in our apartment. I tried to explain that I was not comfortable since I would be basically topless and she said ""well, we don't mind"" - as if it was about their comfort! It took my husband having a mini-meltdown over all the drama for her to switch from MIL-mode to mom-mode and actually try and do something helpful. She went and picked up some groceries and then left after dropping them off because she was causing more stress for me, and stress is not good when you're already having trouble with breastfeeding.  Now I am expecting my second in August and they are asking us what help we want from them. Really I just want to tell them to stay away until like 3 weeks after the birth, but my husband seems to think that things will be better this time because they saw how many problems their attitude caused last time. My feelings are that if they agreed to our ground rules last time and then got super offended when we tried to enforce them, why should I trust that they will genuinely listen to my requests for what will go down this time? Last time really the most helpful people were the friends who dropped off food for us with no expectation that they could come in and visit. Those friends also dropped everything to drive me to the ER when I developed a high fever 10 days postpartum (it took like an hour and a half, too, because it was during Pride). So really when my in-laws are offering ""help"" I feel like it's implicitly in exchange for time with the new baby, when really the most helpful thing is to just help and not expect anything. But that's just not going to happen.  Maybe I'm just an entitled bitch but I feel like if they want me to be comfortable enough around them to want them there in the crazy hormone-filled days/weeks after birth then they need to make some concrete effort to make me feel comfortable with them instead of just expecting me to feel that way because they're ""family""."

My husband had to beg her to come see him two weeks later and then I had to take him from her because she started sobbing so hard she scared me.

On the one hand, I wish she would stop trying so hard to be my daughter's favorite person in the whole history of ever.  I just find it really annoying even though she's not really causing any harm.  But, on the other, I do wish she'd show a little bit more interest in my son.  It's been nice to have some freedom from the suffocating kind of attention we got when my first child was an infant but she hasn't even held him more than a handful of times so I'm just starting to worry about the dynamic she's developing with the two of them.

I had gas and air. No epidural, only some codeine about 5 hours before she was born.  In the morning our midwife contacted our relatives and they came. Sister in law and her boyfriend first, my dad and aunt and then the in laws.  The in-laws were attending the same hospital for an appointment for MIL that day.

One of the reasons I specifically called her was to tell her we have cholestasis of pregnancy in our gene pool, which may save any future children's lives now that we know I developed it. Instead she switched the topic to how she lost 80 pounds thanks to her newfound addiction. I don't understand it at all.

JUSTNOMIL,3axza5,baitaozi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"Not telling her anything is why she keeps asking. Shes not going to stop. If you want her to stop just tell your husband to make up a story's about a shared hobby of yours. Say you were both talking on an online forum about whatever hobby. If you don't,  it's not going to stop, giving her a vague answer is WHY she's so insistent, it's giving ever reason to think it's something suspicious.  I was told when you tell someone a plain simple and boring story they stop thinking about it,  if you don't it let's their imagination run wild. It's silly to not just tell her something simple to get the questions to stop. He can just say he was embarrassed you met online or some crap - older people sometimes think this is still weird. So it would be understandable if he was embarrassed hence not wanting to talk about it. It's your life, but it's normal for someone to be interested in how you met and it's normal to think it's something weird,  worrying or strange if you're not given an answer to a simple question."

Prospective employers can ask almost anything; the rumor that they can't ask about certain things comes from the fact that if they do ask about something related to a protected class (race, gender, family status, nationality, a few other things), they run the risk of being accused that the reason they didn't hire is because of discrimination."

JUSTNOMIL,3aqcc4,AshuraSpeakman,14,Mon Jun 22 20:24:06 2015 UTC,"Backstory from a previous rant comment: She became BFFs with his former drug addict, BPD ex-gf (dated and had an accidental baby and broke up all within 1.5 years). Why? Because A) stepmil herself has those conditions and was ""left"" by the man who got her pregnant FORTY YEARS AGO...MOVE ON and B) she's the mother of his grandson and she ""needs to keep the peace for everyone!"" (No, no you don't. There's a court order in place, but nice excuse).    Ex and Stepmonster in law are very high conflict and feel threatened and jealous of me, Stepmonster in law would tell ex everything right down to job offers I got and once she tried to convince her to move to the town where my new job was. I turned down the job regardless. She was nosy and at first I thought it was her way of bonding, and her ragging on my then BF was her attempt at advice. Then it hit me she was trying to break us up, and our ""bonding"" was so she could funnel info to ex.    We went low contact and tried to establish boundaries and it resulted in her saying mean things to us and not apologizing, she cried when we announced our engagement (not happy tears, she then gave us her NA/AA ""God bless me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change"" prayer as she ran to phone to call ex to ""talk to my grandson"" right after we announced it), she's told me my kids won't matter as much because grandson was here first, blew off my bridal shower, went to my parents the week before the wedding to try to turn them against my husband and call off wedding and get them to agree that ""he left the mother of his child, so he doesn't deserve a life and bride comes second/won't have important kids"" (that backfired on her so hard as my parents love me and my husband and did NOT like hearing some lowlife whacko spew that vitriol on their first meeting and it made everyone aware of her previously subdued crazy that she hid so well that I thought I was the crazy one, not anymore!), then she spent the wedding crying and telling me that if ex-gf ever gets married she will be so beautiful and finally she left early and hasn't spoken to us since the wedding.    I think she's waiting for us to cower to her and say ""what's the matter?"" But LOL no!!! She thinks it's a punishment, but her giving us silent treatment for months can continue forever. I've already fallen victim to her, ""let me make a half assed, tearful apology then walk all over you again"" schtick before, and now husband is on board with my feelings towards her as well. It took couples therapy for him to see the light and I felt so bad for him once an unbiased third party laid out why what she is doing is abusive, not normal, and no, she doesn't love him or care for his best interests/ she's punishing him. We used to use her a lot for babysitting (she'd always beg to babysit then get mad if we asked her to or shed offer to take him all weekend then call us one day in and make us get him so she still had ""control"") and before we dated husband would live there in days he had custody, so she knew we needed her and we've found other work arounds now. His ex only works nights and weekends when SS is home from school so she never sees her son despite being the primary custodian, she ships him off to stay with crazy Stepmonster on her weekends where she has custody, but for some reason she's lauded as a super mom who stepmonster will babysit for no problem however we are awful abandoners for previously needing her on a night occasionally?  Stepmonster in law did a lot of damage to golden child stepson with her coddling, spoiling, overfeeding...he will watch the Ipad for 2 days straight, eat whatever he wants, get babied, and never reprimanded and unfortunately it's left a permanent mark as it happened SO MUCH from when he was 1-6... the other day he got caught trying to start a fire so they bought him a magnifying glass so he could start them the right way rather than disciplining him! Then they got mad we wouldn't give the glass back to him when he was at our house!  Holy crap this was long. Sorry!"

If she wants light makeup -- Estee Lauder counters at the mall.  Make a day out of it!

Most of those kids graduating grade 8 aren't going to graduate high school. Some will have kids and be unable to finish, others will have to get full time jobs to help their families out, some will simply flunk out, etc. So the grade 8 graduations are huge to make up for the fact a lot of those kids won't get a high school graduation.

To be fair, my mom's family pulled her out of school before she finished, but that was 40-50 years ago, and they probably only got away with it because they lived in the middle of nowhere.   some will simply flunk out   I'm unfamiliar with this concept. The school system must not be very good there? That's unheard-of here, for more than maybe a couple people in a given graduating class.    So the grade 8 graduations are huge to make up for the fact a lot of those kids won't get a high school graduation.   So it's a participation award? ""Look you've done good enough, you don't need high school after all""?

Our school systems have junior and senior kindergarten, and grades 1-12. Elementary school ends at grade 8, high school grade 12.   Some drop out before graduating because of problems at home, drug or alcohol use, because they are being bullied or because they have learning disabilities that aren't being met.   Some of these kids instead switch to an online program, a school that is specifically set up to help kids with diverse needs or complete a GED which proves they have met the learning requirements of a high school program.

It isn't illegal. At 16, grade 10/11 depending, it's totally legal to leave school.  I say flunking out, but what I really mean is some kids simply don't care enough and don't show up, or they fail and then seek alternative schooling like correspondence or they choose to get their GEDs or something. Few legitimately flunk out, but it still happens.  No one is illiterate, the school system isn't like horrible or anything... things are just different here than one would expect in places like Toronto or Vancouver or other metropolitan areas. Babies having babies (I was a very old FTM at 24 if that helps), bills have to be paid, some kids prefer to get right into the work force... all very normal here.

Whether they come to visit us, or we go to see them.  They just don't do it.  And they don't show any interest in participating in meal times. They just expect me to cater to them and make sure they get fed.  Which is extremely annoying when I am the only one with a job (and pregnant with twins, and I have a toddler to boot).    Last time they visited, I worked a 10 hour day, and came home, and the first words out of their mouths were ""what are you cooking for dinner.""  My response was ""I'll have whatever you all (my husband, and in-laws) are planning on making.""  That really pissed them off and apparently I am a bad hostess.  Whatever.  My parents -- I have to argue with them that it's okay to split the bill.  They have three daughters, all married with children, footing the bill is a multi-hundred dollar affair when we all go out together. But they always offer because ""that's what parents do.""  Now, we have it stipulated ""you are allowed to buy one meal of your choosing, and that is it, for the entire length of the visit, no matter what."""
JUSTNOMIL,3aq96z,allpregnantandshit,18,Tue Jun 23 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"No! This is craaazy! Pregnant with twins, have a toddler, just worked a ten hour day and they ask you what you're making for dinner as soon as you get home?! HELL NO. What the hell were they doing all day?! This is insanity. There are times when I wish this would happen to my hilarious and loud-mouthed sister. Her response might be something like:  ""What are you making for dinner?""  ""Oh, HI! Am I alright after working a ten hour day pregnant with twins, you ask? Yeah, I guess so, though growing two humans and two extra organs is pretty difficult, not going to lie! Really takes a lot out of you! I'm sorry, what was that you said? You wanted to know what you could make me for dinner so I can focus on (toddler) for a moment and get off my feet?! Gosh that's so nice of you! It's reasons like this we love having you guys around... WAIT. I just blacked out and imagined some decency and consideration. That was weird.""   Cue silence from everyone while she stands there beaming. I wish I had those balls."
JUSTNOMIL,3aq96z,ProfessorMMcGonagall,12,Tue Jun 23 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Nothing! The three of them did nothing all day! My toddler was in day care, my in-laws and my husband hung out at the house all day.  That's what drives me up the daggone wall!  Then, MIL has the gall to tell me that she went in MY room and made MY bed, (and ""straightened up"" my dresser and nightstand) and that I should be grateful. Bitch, don't touch my stuff, and don't invade my privacy.  There is a reason I keep my doors shut, and it's because I don't want you in there."

Literally sat at home and visited all day and expected you to make dinner when you got home from your shift?! I would have said exactly what you said. Who the hell do they think they are?! AND PREGNANT WITH TWINS NO LESS. I don't care if you were two days or eight months pregnant, being pregnant is hard as shit and with twins?! Double hard! UGH."
JUSTNOMIL,3aq96z,ohfluffit,3,Tue Jun 23 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"My parents are similar to yours.  We pay when they visit here and they pay when we visit them at home.  My ILs?  I've never seen either reach for the check.  FIL sits back picking his teeth with a toothpick (no matter how nice the restaurant) while MIL... I don't even know.  For her birthday, mother's day, etc only restaurants with min $40 main courses will do.  So, yeah, that's fun.  She, at least, usually says ""thank you."""
JUSTNOMIL,3aq96z,Glittery_Pickle,18,Tue Jun 23 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"Not quite sure how it started.  It's been about five years and it's just how it is now.  I think we'll try going to their place right after a late breakfast and stay until it's almost time for dinner.  (It's an hour drive each way.) The kicker this weekend was them inviting two others to come with us - and us still having to pay for everyone. (FIL's birthday) FIL's reaction to dinner ""meh - it was allright."" (This happens often.) As we're driving them home - MIL shows me a birthday coupon from the place that would have give us $10 off his dinner.  Her response - ""I didn't want to use it today - just in case we go back before it expires next week.""  We just dropped over $100 - but no problem."

I'd stick with everyone else's idea of ""it's not in our budget"" and make it clear before going that any meals will be split from here on out. I'm pretty sure they won't be happy about it, but they need to stop acting like spoiled children. Don't forget about the amount of money you spent on gas and tolls to go see them (if they get whiny over you having a budget)."
JUSTNOMIL,3aq96z,originakk,14,Tue Jun 23 08:16:20 2015 UTC,"Wait, WHAT???  Ok, now it is official, your parents-in-law are blatantly using you.   Forget about bringing homecooked food, I seriously doubt they are even grateful for that.  And, for the love of all that is holy, stop paying anything for them; that stunt about your paying for two extra guests would be the last straw, for me.  Where does your husband stand about all of that?"
JUSTNOMIL,3aq96z,baby_purple,5,Tue Jun 23 09:19:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, so first off, your MIL and FIL definitely suck! But also....  I can't believe their friends didn't insist on paying! At least for half of the meal. If I saw my friends's kid and their spouse paying I'd feel sooooo awkward."

If it were me, I'd make a rule right now that anyone who isn't supportive of your child doesn't get to be a part of their life.  When I had my son, my husband and I said right away that if you want to be a part of his life, YOU have to make that happen. We both grew up being forced to hang out with aunts and uncles and grandparents who couldn't care less about it and it sucked. Our son has 3 sets of grandparents and one of them sees him MAYBE twice a year, and for less than 2 days at a time. We don't have the money to go visit them whenever we'd like, while they have been making close to $500K for a while, and are now both retired young.   We've told them from the get-go, just give us a little warning that you want to come, but feel free to come whenever. And yet, they don't.  I ranted a little there. Sorry about that. But seriously, OP... live your life for yourself and that baby you're bringing into the world. You can be a perfect, happy little family of 3 without the negativity that comes with family who would rather preach than love."

I am not sure how this will change when the baby gets here. I do not intend on have negative people around my child at all.   Thankfully, his aunts and uncles are so excited to have a little nephew. This is the first child on both sides of the family."
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,agentfantabulous,20,Mon Jun 22 19:52:04 2015 UTC,"This is one of the major reasons my husband and I eloped. Our pregnancy was unplanned, and we decided several months in that we wanted to marry. But after so much pressure, mostly from his Catholic family, we did not want a wedding or even for anyone to attend. So we crossed the state line on a Thursday morning, two weeks before my due date, found a courthouse, and got ourselves hitched.   That said, pregnancy hormones are no joke. I'm on my third pregnancy, and sometimes my husband breathing the wrong way is enough for me to think he's terribly mad at me and ready to leave and I'm sitting there on the verge of tears, and he's like ""Damn allergies. Let's go get donuts for breakfast.""  So yeah, trust him when he says he proposed because he wants to get married, and get married on your own terms, not because people tell you that you should."
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,diastataxic,10,Mon Jun 22 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"This is one of the major reasons my husband and I eloped.    Us, too. I wasn't pregnant, but we had been together for ten years in a well-functioning, profoundly healthy partnership. We weren't legally married and that was fine by us.  Meanwhile, our families kept up the ""WHEN ARE YOU GETTING MARRIED?"" barrage for five of those years. We heard everything from ""You must not really want to commit"" to ""There must be something wrong with [him], since he won't propose."" This was coupled with plenty of ""When you get married, your wedding is going to be like this, because we say so.""  We finally threw in the  towel and had a tiny civil ceremony. Our families were shocked that, after badgering and nagging and needling and putting us down for years, we didn't invite them to our wedding. Shocked!  Cue weeping, moaning, and gnashing of teeth. My mother refused to speak to us (but she sure spoke to everyone else about what awful human beings my now-husband and I are).  It really hurt. My parents especially said some things that hurt me very deeply during this time. We're on fine terms now, but they still think they were justified. I really don't like thinking about our wedding, or celebrating our anniversary. It's kind of poisoned for us now.  But I have my partner and husband, who is a wonderful person. We still have a very healthy, happy, wonderful relationship. And now we can be on each other's health insurance, and no one gives us shit anymore for not being married.  It's not easy, OP. But do it on your own terms, for you. Your guy loves you and he wants to be married to you. Go with it.   Congratulations on your engagement, and on your pregnancy! I wish you every good thing."
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,Syrinx221,9,Mon Jun 22 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"I'm pissed for you that those fuck holes managed to ruin your anniversary date, even though they weren't even there for the ceremony."

The wedding is one day; the marriage is for ever.  Plus, we've always celebrated ""our anniversary"" as our first date. We have twelve years now, and we're still each other's favorite people."
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,GingerCookie,2,Tue Jun 23 02:26:06 2015 UTC,"Similar story here but I went through with an actual wedding and invited people (even those who had said hateful things) because we wanted to move on and hopefully prevent hurt feelings.

I personally do not care for a big wedding anyways, especially if his parents are going to use it as an excuse to have a party. They threw my SO a graduation party and invited maybe 100 people. Only 20 or so were actual friends of my SO. Lesson learned.  So we are thinking of eloping next year; however, we are planning a trip to Cabo next month. So maybe a secret wedding will be in the works..."
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,carnu,4,Mon Jun 22 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"A secret wedding in Cabo would be amazing! My husband and I eloped over 6 years ago, no regrets. We thought we would have a small wedding but both our families became monstrous during the planning. One afternoon we said to hell with them and called the courthouse, got married the next week. Plus, how funny would it be the next time his family is snarky and tries to shame you or nag you about the wedding you could just go ""we already had a wedding (X) months ago and it was perfect!"". If they try to be nasty about the baby you could also whip out ""We got married without you and we can live/raise this baby without you too""."
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,carnu,8,Mon Jun 22 22:15:39 2015 UTC,"I'm so sad for you that these downright nasty people have tarnished two beautiful moments in your relationship. Success is the best form of revenge - I know its easier said than done but try to put them out of your mind and concentrate on your wonderful fiance and growing pregnancy.   I dont know which culture or country you live in but his parents, your grandmother and your employers actions are not acceptable or normal. Someone needs to tell your grandmother that he wasn't some one night stand from round the back of the club (which incidentally shouldn't matter either) - he's your partner and common law husband of 7 years! Would your parent on grandmothers side not tell her on your behalf she needs to apologise? You definitely should pursue your HR dept for an apology/public retraction. Could your fiance tackle his own parents? This might take some pressure off you.   My bet is that once baby comes they will want to ooh and aah over her/him and they might just find themselves with a door slammed in their face. how dare they ruin these two amazing, joyful experiences for you and your fiance?  Enjoy, plan, prepare and relish everything and every second! You deserve it."
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,fruitjerky,5,Mon Jun 22 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"Sadly, my grandmother is late 90s and recovering from a recent stroke. I do not think I will ever get an appology from her. When she called me I did tell her that her words were hurtful and I wish she would be happy for us. I am going to have to learn to let that one go.   He has been working with his parents for years. They are uneducated and lack the proper social skills to know how to interact with people. They also get very defensive when you call them out of their behavior. So this one is difficult.   On a positive note, HR at my company is no joke. My senior manager appologized to me in person within a week. I was able to voice to her how embarrassing her publically sharing her personal values was to me. I think she feels really bad for what she said.  And thank you for you kind words. I decided to lay by the pool this afternoon and my ring was blinding because it was so sparkly. I have so much to be happy for that I cannot let the negative get me down."

It's none of their business; I just enjoy making people uncomfortable for being insensitive. For example, I probably enjoyed it a little too much when I told my dad that my daughter can't walk because she had cerebral palsy, not because I ""never put her down."" Try to blame my parenting when you see her twice a year! I'll show you, jerkface!    Congratulations on the baby and the secret Cabo wedding! It all sounds very dreamy!"
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,SerpentsDance,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:58:27 2015 UTC,"His mother knows about the organs but I have never shared my anxiety of conception with her. Mainly because I am a private person. I also do not want her thinking about her son and I having sex. It is possible that she forgot. If something is not directly about her, she has no concern. When I was upset with the news from my doctor and called her, she actually would not stop talking about her health to listen to me talk about mine!   Sorry your father made that parenting comment. That's terrible! I'm sure you are a great mom!"
JUSTNOMIL,3appgr,mnh1,3,Wed Jun 24 16:12:28 2015 UTC,"When I told my father that my husband and I were getting married he was all excited and asked about the ring. I told him we were skipping a ring because we wanted to use the money elsewhere (a house, the wedding, other financial obligations that had delayed us getting engaged already) and he made the snarkiest comment that I still get upset when I think about it: ""What, he doesn't think you're worth a nice ring?"".   It had already stung a little that we had decided to skip it and I ended up being so upset that my husband bought a much less expensive vintage ring than what either of us had in mind just for the sake of having it for the wedding. It was nice enough but ultimately was a waste of money (he just gave me a ring upgrade this mother's day) and really served as a reminder to me of my father's nasty comment than it did of my wedding day. I honestly stopped wearing it and just wore the plain band (like we had originally planned).   It's so hard not to let people get into your head, especially when it's your family who you really want to be excited for you. I want to say to let their negativity (or lack of positivity) roll off your back and to just focus on the loving relationship that you have with your fiance but I know how hard that is in practice.   Congratulations on the baby and the engagement! They got to live their lives they way they wanted, don't let them boss you or judge you on how you're living yours."

The lady over there - her way is the right way.  That asshole over there... His way is the right way - for him.  Don't let the morality police cloud over your pregnancy, your proposal or your engagement.    My husband and I weren't engaged when we had our daughter.  We didn't even get engaged till she was 2, just to spite his parents.  And we waited until two years later when I was pregnant with our second to get married.  We were going to elope, but I had a wedding just to spite the in-laws.  Don't dare tell me I can't wear a white dress while I'm pregnant, with one kid out of wedlock already, that is just going to make me invite every person you've ever known to watch me do it.

I am slowly getting over the negative comments by sharing my engagement news with actual friends. Everyone has been really excited for us. They know his parents are difficult, so people usually ask how his parents took the news which leads to us all making fun of how selfish and backwards they are. Not that I take joy in making fun of people, but if you can laugh at negative comments, you tend to get over them faster.   I would LOVE to share a pic but I am like an tolder on a computer.

JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,Ioethe,3,Mon Jun 22 18:31:31 2015 UTC,Fair enough :)
JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,rbnthrowaway13,4,Mon Jun 22 18:22:55 2015 UTC,How long between the chest surgery and the estimated conception???
JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,carnu,3,Mon Jun 22 17:55:05 2015 UTC,I thought a baby was just too convenient. Sorry you have this witch in your life.
JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,mnh1,11,Mon Jun 22 17:18:31 2015 UTC,You don't sound like a horror for venting.  She sounds like a nightmare.  Your poor brother is stuck in an abusive relationship (controlling when he can talk to his family!).  She also sounds terrifying to be around with her constant search for lawsuits.
JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,allpregnantandshit,4,Mon Jun 22 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"Jeeeeesus. She sounds horrible. I can only see this ending in tears for everyone involved. I never thought I'd say this on this sub, but holy crap your poor MIL."
JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,rnng05,5,Mon Jun 22 17:04:25 2015 UTC,"Wow. What an epic failure of a decent human. I feel sorry for your BIL (but not too much, since he obviously got himself into this mess) because once that baby comes she will have total manipulation power over him and his parents. And I bet she's gonna use it to her full advantage. How sad."
JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,cman_yall,5,Mon Jun 22 16:21:54 2015 UTC,"I think so too. It just sucks because she's all nicey nice and butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, but when you stand back and took at it you can tell she's a master manipulator, but my husband's family are very very naive and can't see it, and at this stage I don't think they ever will. Of course my BIL has made his own bed, I just wish my MIL etc weren't roped in. My son used to love going on adventures with his gran and gramps to the zoo, little one night vacations and my inlaws are too broke to continue this until they get themselves on their feet again. So it's innocent people like my son who are feeling the brunt of this also in a way (note: my son loves his gran and gramps just as much when they're taking him to the park and money-free fun things, so don't think I'm complaining too much about that!)  She's claiming as a single parent to social security, so committing fraud against the government also."

JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,lilbluehair,5,Mon Jun 22 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"Your BIL is being abused. Please, please have him contact a domestic abuse line or something.  If it was your sister who was dating a guy who controlled how she talked to her own family, would you stand back because she ""made her own bed""?"
JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,rnng05,8,Mon Jun 22 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"I feel sorry for your BIL (but not too much, since he obviously got himself into this mess)   WTF?? Would you say that about a woman who was dating a man that convinced her to drop out of college, stop seeing all of her friends, and controlled how she could talk to her family?  This is textbook abuse."
JUSTNOMIL,3apu32,faiora,2,Mon Jun 22 20:37:32 2015 UTC,"Well, that would depend on the situation. I obviously don't know enough about her BIL to truly make a judgment on whether he's a victim of abuse or not, so I guess I shouldn't have said that."

JUSTNOMIL,3anzi6,mnh1,6,Mon Jun 22 13:48:11 2015 UTC,"She and my husband dated for a few months close to 10 years ago, WAY before I was even in the picture."
JUSTNOMIL,3anzi6,Glittery_Pickle,2,Mon Jun 22 18:40:12 2015 UTC,What MIL thinks about SIL's emotions is irrelevant.  The fact is she was telling people she expected the husband to drop everything to leave his marriage with OP just because SIL had a rough patch in her marriage.  That's a nasty thing to say.
JUSTNOMIL,3anzi6,ohfluffit,2,Tue Jun 23 02:54:21 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunately relevant. MIL has been meddling in both relationships since the very beginning and almost succeeded in splitting both up. Both relationships have since been repaired, and all 4 of us are tired of her shit."

JUSTNOMIL,3afqxs,Ilovegoku11,7,Fri Jun 19 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"I think she is getting the idea that we are not going to help anymore. It like she is asking to get turned down so she can have a pity party, she loves the attention. We have two kid under two, binging them over to help is just the kids undoing things. It's pointless to ask people with kids that young to do anything last minute."

JUSTNOMIL,3ac55h,andewonderland,9,Thu Jun 18 23:33:05 2015 UTC,"My husband would agree.   I once peed in my suite mates shampoo bottles. Those bitches terrorized and bullied me.   Then, my stepdad pissed me off by emptying an ash tray into my brand new sneakers. So, I pissed in his shampoo bottle, too. Every day for a week! My mom called me a month later after I had moved out. He asked her to if shampoo goes bad when it gets old and had her smell it. She immediately knew what I did, b/c I had told her about my suit mates.  Good thing is after a few years, he forgave me. My mom divorced him a decade later and he still chooses to be my dad. I love him, and he still loves me even though he bathed in my revenge piss!"

JUSTNOMIL,3ac55h,TheEthalea,26,Thu Jun 18 22:51:02 2015 UTC,Trying washing her fingers and hands several times with dishwashing liquid like Dawn. It says it lasts about a week with normal washing. With heightened washing it should get clear faster.   Piggy Polish is one of the only safe polishes for babies. I would watch my mom if I were you. She's being sneaky and I hope it doesn't spread to actively doing more stuff behind your back.
JUSTNOMIL,3ac55h,mnh1,11,Thu Jun 18 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And, yeah she has a hard time understanding how people can have opinions different than her own.  Even if I go through and refute her arguments she looks confused then says ""but why don't you just..."" And restates her suggestion.  I'm trying to limit her alone time with the kids without being rude. She wouldn't understand why I think there is a problem."
JUSTNOMIL,3ac55h,Trishlovesdolphins,7,Thu Jun 18 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'd be tempted to paint over the nasty polish with a non-toxic nail polish like Piggy Polish to cover up whatever's left of the nasty tasting polish, kinda like sealing concrete, so your daughter could suck her thumb again."
JUSTNOMIL,3ac55h,fruitjerky,6,Fri Jun 19 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"Well, they list it as being removable with nail polish remover, are you sure the nasty taste isn't the nail polish remover at this point? That shit tastes nasty too."
JUSTNOMIL,3ac55h,mmm_egg,11,Fri Jun 19 13:18:08 2015 UTC,How unfortunate that you don't have an older child to do your parenting for you like she did. And how horrible of her to put that on your daughter's thumbs without asking! I want to flick your mother right on the forehead.
JUSTNOMIL,3ac55h,cassiopeia1280,10,Fri Jun 19 00:05:45 2015 UTC,"When my mom used that nail polish on me, I just painted over it with regular clear nail polish. If it won't come off, try covering it up."

JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,MommyDearest30,38,Thu Jun 18 02:45:58 2015 UTC,"WHAT?? SO should have told her where to shove it.  Your MIL should just be grateful that they are getting your old set for free. And last time I checked, 11 year olds were pretty resilient. She can sleep on a couch or something in the meantime if she doesn't want to sleep on her mattress/box spring or whatever. Ridiculous."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,whatthecrump,18,Thu Jun 18 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"She has a perfectly good bed, they just don't want to move it just to have to switch it out... Ummm, her mattress is on one of those metal frames that collapse. That wouldn't be too hard to switch out?"
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,followthepost-its,18,Thu Jun 18 04:05:54 2015 UTC,I can't believe your husband didn't set her straight. Why tell her to talk to you? He should have manned up and handled it.

JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,MadamNerd,9,Mon Jun 22 10:34:55 2015 UTC,How exactly does she think you will be getting in and out of this bed. It's not exactly easy to get up and moving at 34 weeks. Sil can sleep on the floor she's 11 it will be new and exciting for her.
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,NeedsTeaStat,3,Thu Jun 18 06:37:38 2015 UTC,"I can barely walk at this point due to SPD, I do not see myself rolling myself out of bed to cater to her lol"
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,faiora,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:47:24 2015 UTC,I never had any major pain while pregnant and it was still hard as hell to get out of bed at 34 weeks. Your MIL is a bit coo-coo.
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,7,Fri Jun 19 02:27:34 2015 UTC,"I slept on the floor, no mattress at all, at one point during my pregnancy. It was quite comfortable at 38 weeks. I was running hot and the floor was cool, which was an added bonus. :)  That being said, it was my choice to sleep on the floor! Her volunteering you to do so is disgusting."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,Cyannide_Bunnies,3,Thu Jun 18 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"When I lay on the floor, I can't get up because my back locks up. I would literally have to roll myself on the floor and crawl to something to lift me up lol. Screw the bed- when is this baby coming out!! Haha"
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,Cyannide_Bunnies,6,Thu Jun 18 14:44:38 2015 UTC,"On one hand, I don't see any problem with the height or feeling of a mattress of a boxspring on the floor.   On the other hand, in my experience, having a bed directly on the floor like that causes air flow issues and can result in being overhot or overcold very easily, because the air that would go under the bed instead goes over it, and airflow is generally restricted.   She probably just wasn't thinking. I get where she was coming from.   Mind you, she is wrong."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oyz,Ioethe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:26:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be able to get up.. I have a fairly high bed and I still have to roll myself off of it. The only difference is that my feet eventually hit the floor now versus having to either pull myself up or crawl until I find something that I can use to pull myself up LOL
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,Mostly_me,37,Thu Jun 18 02:45:40 2015 UTC,You and your husband need to be on the same page but it doesn't sound like you are. The bottom line is that your daughter's health comes first and your in-laws should acknowledge and respect that.
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,Ilovegoku11,8,Thu Jun 18 03:48:13 2015 UTC,"He is on the same page, he just also doesn't know how to get it through to them..."

He gave me the explanation but of course that's not the only thing he does.... He also talked to them about it, again, both together and to his mom and dad alone. He is on my and our side here..."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,leipa,10,Thu Jun 18 07:10:19 2015 UTC,"You are being downvoted but you are correct. Talking didn't work, so it is absolutely time to lay down the law. No matter how inconvenient it is to not let her in-laws watch their child, that is the next step. It isn't an accident, and it isn't okay. They cannot watch the child unsupervised and their child cannot be alone with them for any amount of time. They are making their own grandchild sick and lying about it. This wasn't an accidental exposure. They actively and knowingly gave their grandkid food that makes her ill."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,13,Thu Jun 18 14:17:39 2015 UTC,"Have they seen her sick, or do you have to deal with that afterwards alone? I wonder if they ever saw the direct consequences of their actions if they would finally get it."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,l-x,10,Thu Jun 18 14:26:51 2015 UTC,"The thing is they shouldn't have to see the direct consequences of it. It is fucked up to do to a child. If anyone gives my child peanuts or food with trace amounts of it, she could die from anaphylaxis. They need to respect it because not sickening another person is simply the right thing to do. Just because a child won't die from allergen exposure doesn't make it okay to expose them."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,statmama,4,Fri Jun 19 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's lucky or unlucky but the consequences are not that immediate and severe. She just stops eating (which they have seen) and if it continues she gets a cold with fever (which they have seen as well). Long term the consequences can be more severe, but that's invisible.  I've send them a message explaining again how important it is, and so has my husband, and we agreed that for the immediate future I'll just send them over food and candy and that's what they'll give her and nothing else."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,misschelsea,24,Thu Jun 18 10:03:44 2015 UTC,"the problem is they don't believe it. they think she's just being a kid and that you're being delusional. i can tell you that's exactly what it is, because if they thought for one second that the food they were giving her was hurting her, they'd be reading that shit with a magnifying glass."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,DreamingCannibal,13,Fri Jun 19 12:33:55 2015 UTC,"Is there any way that you could get a note from her pediatrician saying ""hey, this isn't just a preference, it's a real medical issue""? My family has tons of food allergies and sensitivities, so I'm used to dealing with this, and sometimes ""because doctor said so"" is the only way to get people to take an allergy seriously.  That situation sucks, though. It would almost be easier if they were straight up telling you ""lol nope we don't check!"" rather than constantly lying."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,DreamingCannibal,4,Thu Jun 18 14:15:28 2015 UTC,"This pisses me off. As someone with a legit gluten allergy people just don't respect it. People try to feed me all kinds of shit I that will make me sick. Until I go into my celiac sprue blood test and million gastro doc appointments; then it's a different story. Get a Doctors note and maybe they will stop being jerks. Then I would lay on the guilt, she is a kid they should be looking out for her."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,starla79,5,Thu Jun 18 16:04:50 2015 UTC,"Get the exams that need to be done, done. If she does in fact have a gluten allergy you can make them acknowledge and understand better that your child cannot have it."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,2,Thu Jun 18 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I'm not going to put my 2 year old through a biopsy just because they won't pay attention.  We've solved it for now. They'll only take her out to where we've been before, and at home I'm buying her candy and giving her food for the freezer. So far it seems to be working"
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,virgulesmith,3,Fri Jun 19 02:35:32 2015 UTC,"It obviously is your decision, however I think you should get the exams done. I believe there is another way to test for gluten allergy than with a biopsy that is not as intrusive/painful. In the long run it would be better to get it over and done with while she is younger seeing that you're probably going to introduce her to the school systems and what not."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,OodalollyOodalolly,2,Sat Jun 27 07:45:15 2015 UTC,"Luckily she will go to a school who has experience with another child who is gluten free. And they don't need a doctors paper.  Just last weekend she accidentally ate some gluten, and since yesterday she's very ill. A very bad cold with fever...   Yes, it could be coincidence, but how many coincidences should there be before it's not anymore?  The thing I'm worried about, is that when testing I have to put her on gluten for a while. And since she's still growing so much and is already a bit behind compared to when she was born, I don't want her to be ill for a few weeks.  There's a blood test which I don't really get, because of the amount of false results, no matter the outcome, they still recommend doing the biopsy.  I'm lucky that living in Mexico it makes it a bit easier to be gluten free, bread never was a huge part of our diet, and I've found good tasting corn pasta."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,DirkDieGurke,4,Tue Jun 30 11:33:38 2015 UTC,"Your inlaws sound like mine.  For the longest time i wouldn't let them feed my son anything because of his peanut allergy.  They'd rather do what's convenient for them than what's right, and as long as they don't have to pay for the consequences or see them directly, that's what they're going to continue to do."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,3,Wed Jul 1 06:00:16 2015 UTC,"Allergies are treated so flippantly by a lot of people. There is an IgE blood test that can be run that will help prove your point to them, so it isn't invasive like a celiac disease biopsy at all. Lots of people assume that if you have an allergy you can have small bits of it or must be bellyaching. This is not the case at all. Some allergies are mild enough that trace exposures are okay, but many aren't. This is a huge deal, and as a parent of a child with severe food allergies I suggest you make it clear that their lying is harmful. Make it clear they will not be allowed to watch your child unsupervised. What they are doing is not just undermining you as a parent but actively sickening your daughter for whatever fucked up reason. Even doing it because it is inconvenient is malicious. Anything other than following the food guidelines set by you and your husband is malicious. Accidents happen but should be rare and rarer as time goes on."
JUSTNOMIL,3a8oy9,DirkDieGurke,3,Wed Jul 1 13:46:03 2015 UTC,"I write ""Gluten"" on the things in our pantry that have stealth gluten in  them. My husband has accidentally fed me large amounts of gluten because he thought the magic brand that made the awesome gluten-free pancake mix ONLY made GF mixes, so didn't think anything when he made their gluten-full mix. It did say organic on it, so confusing. But he's also done it with pasta (thought I'd thrown out all the gluten-full pasta). Ooopps. Though it did validate that I am truly sensitive, and he got to take care of things while i got a migraine and took some pills.  It sounds like you've provided them with the list of what's safe, provided the right stuff and they are still not seeing it. I think you have to just keep making lists of the things to look out for (wheat, flour, semolina, wheat starch, malt, etc.), it's so easy to find gluten-free indicators now, but damn, people who love me still keep offering me gluten-full cakes and soy sauced items. They mean well, it's just tradition to offer up those things, to share food. It's harder with a 2 year old though, because she can't be expected to be vigilant for herself."
JUSTNOMIL,3a75ip,apotero,37,Wed Jun 17 19:26:29 2015 UTC,"Of course she omitted it. She knows she was being hurtful and what she said was wrong, but she doesn't want to admit it because she would have to stop making ""jokes"" like that. This isn't the first time, trust me. It might not be that phrasing but she says things like this and sees no problem so long as she doesn't get in trouble.  She is hurting your sweet boy and causing so much anxiety just for the easy/funny way out and can't be trusted to just stop.  Your husband needs to put his foot down quick"
JUSTNOMIL,3a75ip,MrsMagnum,28,Wed Jun 17 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"Hubs has already told me and FIL that he's sick of this.

She wouldn't have been ""just kidding"". I'm unsure about older child's age but happy to hear she thinks he/she is old enough to understand sarcasm (if we can call it that). Way to try to sabotage the family mil!!   I hear this from my mother all the time... Usually paired with ""Stop being so sensitive"".   No. How about you stop being an asshole.   Im sorry about your MIL.. She sounds all too much like my mother. I'm happy your husband is on your side and not allowing her to play him against you."
JUSTNOMIL,3a75ip,l-x,8,Thu Jun 18 04:56:38 2015 UTC,"jesus. seriously, how emotionally stunted and immature do you have to be to not own up to upsetting someone, especially a fucking child?  it's not even a matter of being like, ""you're right, DIL, that was wrong,"" you tell the child that you fucked up and explain to them that it was wrong to say something like that and you're sorry. AHHHHH!"

JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,SerpentsDance,52,Wed Jun 17 19:50:30 2015 UTC,Damn. Making wedding plans behind your back and expecting you to foot the bill. That has to be the most bullshit move ever.
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,__sesame__,12,Wed Jun 17 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"I know. I don't know how she thought that would work. Especially since most places require a deposit. She had also recruited SIL to make the wedding cake and my husband's aunt to put together flowers. I even put a stop to that. SIL made the cake when my husband's brother got married. They have two diabetics in the family and SIL decided to make the cake and frosting with Splenda (rather than making a smaller cake for the diabetics). It tasted nasty and the frosting was gritty and the trash can at the reception hall was full of pieces of cake with exactly one bite taken out of them. As for the aunt doing the flowers, she did the flowers for BIL's wedding..very cheap looking silk flower arrangements put together very poorly. I've seen beautiful arrangements done with very nice silk flowers, but these were not nice at all. Our wedding was in October so I used potted Chrysanthemums and little pumpkins for the arrangements, and my sister made the cake since she's really good at baking."
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,l-x,3,Thu Jun 18 13:33:12 2015 UTC,"oh that sounds lovely (what you actually did, i mean)."
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,allpregnantandshit,35,Thu Jun 18 15:59:08 2015 UTC,I just want to slow clap your husband for a minute for shutting that shit down.  I'm glad you guys got the wedding you wanted... DH and I eloped to avoid all that bullshit! I know where you're coming from.
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,Glittery_Pickle,8,Wed Jun 17 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"He's really good about shutting her down. If he didn't side with me when she's being difficult then he wouldn't be my husband right now. She steamrolls over her other children and they pretty much let her do it. My SIL (my husband's brother's wife) has had endless trouble in regards to MIL and lack of boundaries because BIL doesn't stand up to her. The only time he did was when they had their first baby, and MIL was behaving so horribly in the hospital that he made her leave. She told everyone that BIL had slapped her and told her to ""get out and never come back"" and she'd done ""nothing so deserve such treatment"". In reality he never laid a finger on her and told her that she needed to go home because she was stressing out SIL."
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,EverydayNovelty,12,Thu Jun 18 12:25:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, she's the selfish one! She wanted it her way. I hope your wedding turned out beautiful. I was very relieved to read your husband stood up to her and the FIL too."

JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,l-x,8,Thu Jun 18 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty much her reaction to everything. She was upset when we moved in together, because he was still living at home when we started dating. So when he decided to move out and get a place with me, it ruined her fantasy about how my husband would never ever leave his parents and would live with them and support them forever. Then later on when we bought our house together and she realized that he was never going to move back home, she kept telling us that we had to make sure the house had a spare room she could move into. My husband shut that one down pretty fast as well."
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,l-x,10,Thu Jun 18 12:12:44 2015 UTC,"He's pretty good about putting his foot down as far as his mother is concerned. His dad is pretty reasonable and tries to keep MIL in check, but it doesn't always work and so all he can do is warn us so we're prepared for her various fits. The wedding was beautiful, and MIL looked like an idiot because all she'd done is complain to everyone how horrible our wedding would be. The Justice of the Peace we got to marry us said our wedding was one of the best ones he'd ever done because it was so small and everything was so pretty."
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,shhnobodyknows,8,Thu Jun 18 12:16:49 2015 UTC,"Even if your husband's attempt doesn't work, a fair warning is awesome. You can prepare yourself for the craziness ahead. Better than going in blind!"
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,faiora,7,Thu Jun 18 13:20:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We've been blindsided by shit she's pulled before and it's not fun..she once called up several family members and told them I was pregnant. I wasn't, and she had no reason so suspect such a thing aside from us deciding to buy a house. In her mind, buying a house = I must be pregnant because there was no other reason for my husband to want to buy a house with me. We got a phone call from one of my husband's siblings asking about me being pregnant and why we hadn't announced it ourselves."
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,faiora,4,Thu Jun 18 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"i'm still in awe over your genius seasonal floral and pumpkin idea. it sounds gorgeous, and probably saved you a mint in the process."
JUSTNOMIL,3a78wf,reneykins,7,Thu Jun 18 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The best thing is that I planted the mums afterwards and then used the pumpkins as part of our Halloween decorations. So my wedding flowers are still growing in the garden to this day, and the pumpkins lasted all the way through the end of October. This was my actual bouquet: bouquet, which I put together myself. We saved a ton by doing things that way. I bought the roses and mums for my bouquet from Sam's Club, of all places, and the total cost was like $10 for all of those, and $30 for the pumpkins and potted mums."

Look on the bright side, you can now use it as a decoy. MIL is going to be bitching about something, you've given her something insignificant to bitch about. You don't have to care about this argument, and you can string it out as long as you want to. Hell, you can even get a real maid for a bit. Or post a picture later on of your husband in a maid outfit, assuming he's ok with it. Just troll her as hard as you can, is my suggestion.  But I'm probably a bad person, so you should ignore most of that advice if not all of it..."

JUSTNOMIL,3a7a8a,allpregnantandshit,15,Wed Jun 17 22:09:33 2015 UTC,Honestly speaking....if you have the money get a maid even short term. Pregnancy exhaustion is horrible and if you work too...the house does get left behind.  We got a cleaner this pregnancy because I struggled too much and was so exhausted I just coyldn't do everything.   I would also suggest you put your inlaws in the limited group in fb so not all of your updates are so dramatic!!

JUSTNOMIL,3a7a8a,baconandbacardi,7,Wed Jun 17 20:38:02 2015 UTC,"My MIL would go around telling all her friends my son was always sick, making it sound like she's chronically ill or something...when he had the daycare sniffles. We only found out because we ran into one of said friends at the store and he got this sad look and asking how son is, like he's on his deathbed or something, and how ""MIL told us how he's been so sick."" She's no longer allowed to say that he's anything other than ""great"" or ""fine"" or ""just being a toddler"". Seriously. I hate the drama."
JUSTNOMIL,3a7a8a,baby_purple,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"This is why I block my MIL from a lot of my posts. You can set Facebook to block specific people with each post. She doesn't get jokes and takes things on facebook way too seriously, too. One time she and FIL were going on and on about something horrible my SIL's husband had posted and the things people were commenting, and then I looked at it and it was just people joking around about something (although I do think it was slightly off-color) and they just didn't get it, and that's when I thought ""Ohhhh... so you've probably said shit like this about stuff I posted too... right... gonna block you now."" So unless it's like, a picture of us at the beach or something innocuous, I block the status update from her."

JUSTNOMIL,3a6hbx,cordsniper,6,Wed Jun 17 19:46:36 2015 UTC,I think there is a part of it that's ignorance too. My family also didn't really know anything about adoption but learned so they understood what was happening for us. She was not in any way there for us during the process which is hard going and when family support is crucial. She is missing out on our children as they are amazing.
JUSTNOMIL,3a6hbx,dabeezkneez,5,Wed Jun 17 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference between ignorance and willful ignorance. The sad thing is though that it's not just her loss, your kids are missing out on one of their grandmas."

I am starting to angry cry over how mad I am at your mother-in-law. I know a lot of the trials you went through to get those beautiful, wonderful boys, and I just want to punch her in the face for refusing to do her tiny part of just being a positive presence in their lives.

Both my cousin and her husband are white. The funny thing is, their baby girl looks SO DAMNED MUCH like her Mom that most people just think the baby is super tanned. It's unreal how much they favor. They adopted her when she was only days old, and in NICU to wean her from all the drugs in her system from what her birth donor had done while pregnant. They had no idea what she would look like in the coming years, but it's really cute when people see them together and mention how much they're alike. My cousin just gets this big goofy smile on her face and says thank you.   Bless you for adopting your children.

JUSTNOMIL,3a6hbx,LoonyLovegood934,-4,Thu Jun 18 01:54:27 2015 UTC,"Well she hasn't exactly told them ""I don't care at all"" either... she's just not dropping everything to come and meet the child. Obviously there are terrible things she could do if things continue this way, but equally obviously she hasn't done them yet."

They, presumably, can handle it. If she starts treating the children like lesser people, that's when shit will get real."

JUSTNOMIL,3a6hbx,Tygria,-13,Wed Jun 17 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"Our children are an extension of us. Biological or not.   You believe this to be true, and I support your right to believe that. I personally wouldn't feel the same, and wouldn't choose to adopt.   And frankly even if they didn't, they have enough grace not to treat the children like they are less than fully fledged members of the family.    That's the important distinction, I guess. The way she feels doesn't make her a bad person, but treating them differently because of it probably does. Depending on how bad it gets of course.

JUSTNOMIL,3a6m7g,Katzchen,16,Wed Jun 17 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"I have cats too, so just to prepare you:   One of them is skittish and tends to stay an arms length away, but the older one is extremely friendly. I'm not scared about her becoming aggressive out of nowhere, but I try to watch out when LO is playing near just because you never know what might happen if LO suddenly decides to grab a handfull of whiskers and kitty can't get away. I couldn't blame her if she felt trapped and lashed out from pain, but I still don't want LO to lose an eye for the sake of a lesson. The cats always had free reign of the nursery but the older one (Judy) wasn't interested in the crib until I started to put LO to sleep in it at around 6 months. The first night, I had to kick Judy out about a dozen times. It was like she wanted to cuddle with her buddy, which is sweet but still, just no. I still find her in there once in a while after LO wakes up from her nap and it annoys me so much! I don't want her to sleep with a face full of cat hair! I don't like closing the door though because that makes the room 10 times more interesting and the cats would rush in every time I opened it.   Your MIL sounds like a nasty piece of work. You guys are hardly the first people to have a baby with pets in the house."
JUSTNOMIL,3a6m7g,Bobalery,9,Wed Jun 17 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! My cat, while sweet, is skittish so she will probably end up avoiding the baby for a few months. Your points about baby being grabby and the cat lashing out in self-defense is a good one, once baby comes, will definitely keep an eye on them both.  The skittishness is why we are allowing her access, when new things happen, she doesn't eat.  So we figured we have to let her in so she gets used to the new environment.  I believe my MIL comes from a good place, but she just doesn't let things go and sees only ""her way."" Worse, she goes around to her extended family and tells them everything I'm doing ""wrong"" so family get-together conversations usually consist of me defending myself. I'm dreading letting her watch the baby already. I see many fights in our future. Ugh."
JUSTNOMIL,3a6m7g,MustacheBus,13,Wed Jun 17 18:14:19 2015 UTC,There was a post on this sub a month or so ago too about a momma who brought home baby and when the cat got close they started to cry and the cat was instantly scared and scratches the baby. I would try to prepare your cat ahead of time for the sounds of a baby (easy enough to YouTube baby cries) and bring home a blanket from the hospital for the cat to sniff before bringing home baby. :-)
JUSTNOMIL,3a6m7g,HarlequinBunny,7,Wed Jun 17 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"Playing youtube videos of a baby crying is a good idea! We figured letting the cat having access to the nursery would be good so she can explore and sniff before baby comes, but adding the sounds would help even more. Thanks for the suggestion!"
JUSTNOMIL,3a6m7g,Bobalery,6,Wed Jun 17 20:19:08 2015 UTC,I've heard tinfoil scares cats so before we brought baby home I had laid tinfoil in the cradle(which was in our room and low enough for ther cats to get into). One day I saw tiny paw prints in the tinfoil and then it was never disturbed again
JUSTNOMIL,3a6m7g,prettywannapancake,4,Thu Jun 18 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"Just thought of another one: scope out a place to put the cat dishes for when baby starts crawling, cause guaranteed he/ she will be drawn like a magnet."
JUSTNOMIL,3a6m7g,l-x,7,Wed Jun 17 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"I had 2 cats when my baby was born (and now have none due to circumstances :( )   One was small and skittish but after she had a few weeks to get used to the baby she would sit on the arm of the couch while I nursed like a body guard, occasionally bending down to lick baby's head.  The other was huge, relaxed and super cuddly. He looooved baby a little too much. Did not understand that he was twice her size and couldn't lay on her. Did not understand that kneading her was not allowed. Did not understand why suddenly jumping all 17 lbs of himself onto my lap while I was trying to nurse and nearly crushing the baby would get him thrown out of the house. Poor big buddy.   Oh, and your MIL is cray cray. I just wanted to talk about my cats. :D"
JUSTNOMIL,3a6m7g,catnamedbear,13,Thu Jun 18 04:36:20 2015 UTC,"basically. if the cat shows any sign of aggression or marks the baby as her territory, then you know it's time to restrict access. if the cat has no problem acclimating to the wailing little baloney loaf, then there's no issue.   it's not like you're going to sit by and watch the cat maul your sleeping precious innocent baby.   i think it's time for DH to have a pointed chat with MIL. i had a frank conversation about trust and confidence and how these kinds of insane worries undermine me as a competent person, and how i seriously wonder how i'm seen if these are actual concerns that plague the people in my life. i'll bet you anything that she has no idea how this is coming across. then again, maybe she does. this sub is full of stories about asshole. but hopefully this story will have a happier ending!"

If he can't stand up for himself, at least stand up for you :(    Not on the same level as you, but I snapped at my FIL in defense of my then FH when FIL said that if he was just a guest he wouldn't come to our wedding because the wedding was black tie (husband's requirement).

JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,Yassssmaam,15,Thu Jun 18 02:21:03 2015 UTC,"I totally relate. My MIL got upset because we were having homemade tarts instead of cake. She kept trying to make me add ""a nice sheet cake from Costco"" (note that I love Costco but this was NOT a Costco sheet cake kind of wedding).   The day of the wedding she refused to allow staff to put out the tarts at all! I found out later she just kept saying ""people should wait for dessert."" I didn't quite realize what was happening during the reception, so I sent three people to ask where the tarts were. They all came back saying things like, ""Just don't worry about it."" I finally got suspicious and told one of my sisters to ""Get some f---- tarts on a plate right the f~~~ now!"" (I'm so classy).   Then my mother in law yelled across the reception, ""You're the Queen of Tarts!"" And I just smiled while the hatred in my heart solidified to a cold black mass.   So the only advice I have is: She knows what she's doing and she will not get better. Start setting up allies to deal with her now!"

JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,baby_purple,7,Wed Jun 17 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"oh definitely the same. She sent out her Christmas letter three months after our fall wedding and she had squeezed one sentence ""My son got married in a beautiful ceremony"" into the middle of the second to last paragraph, which was all about how the weather was so pretty this fall. She gave a full paragraph to her garden, a trip to see her other son, more stories about the weather, and one grandon's grades. We didn't even get a paragraph :)   When she came for Thanksgiving she told me ""Wives come and go, but mothers are forever.""   And then I got pregnant... lets just say I don't exoect to be featured in her Christmas newsletter ever again.   Fwiw, she is slightly easier to deal with when she's mad at me. It's only horrible if I temporarily lose sanity and try to get along with her."
JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,Ioethe,12,Wed Jun 17 21:05:54 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, neither the grooms cake nor the baked goods are at all necessary. We did different flavored cupcakes as well, this way there was sure to be a flavor that pleased everybody. And we still had TONNNSSSS of cupcakes leftover. Even more sad, we went on our honeymoon and they were no good by the time we got back. :(  Maybe you could say that because you're spending money on cupcakes, you'd like to be sure that people will actually eat them and not have a ton leftover, so other desserts just aren't necessary?"
JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,Ioethe,2,Wed Jun 17 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That is exactly what I was thinking. I am paying for a lot too so to have double the amount of sweets feels like I am just throwing away money.   And that is what I told her. Adding a ton of baked goods just really isn't necessary. We have a conference room at the hotel and I suggested she put them in there. I am sure people will eat them other days, but I don't want them at my wedding. She doesn't compromise but just whines until she gets her way and i'm at my limit. My limit! lol"
JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,fartist14,12,Wed Jun 17 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"I seem to say this a lot on wedding threads :)  I used to make wedding dresses. I can tell you stories which would make your hair stand on end. Your vendors have Seen It All, and far worse, than your FMIL can throw. Let them know that there's a problem and that she's not involved in any of the decision making. I can assure you that being icily polite to mothers and mothers in law of the bride is one of the better aspects of the job. Your vendors are on your side.  Take a trusted friend (preferably not your Maid of Honour, she'll have a lot to do) and give them MIL Wrangling Duty. Their job is to keep her away from you as much as possible on The Day. You know those people who are always hovering around asking if there's Anything They Can Dooooo? Rope them in.  And prior to saying the vows you need to have a chat with future husband. It's fair enough that in the past he's wanted to keep the peace, work around the crazy, etc. But it is not OK now. It's his job to stand up for you, for your marriage, and your kids if that's the plan. Couples counselling before the wedding is an excellent idea.  Have a wonderful day and a happier marriage."
JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,Ioethe,7,Wed Jun 17 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you so much for your advise! It is good to know; I was hesitant to tell any vendors about this for fear of bringing them into the drama but now I feel a little better about doing it."

My icy ""I'm sorry, but I agreed all changes to the dress would be made in writing - surely you remember signing the contract? I can provide a copy."" (to the mother of the bride who phoned up pretending to be her daughter so she could swap to a different dress design and colour two weeks before the wedding) cost me nothing at all."
JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,baitaozi,4,Wed Jun 17 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I guess after reading this sub I shouldn't be surprised, but I can't believe people actually do that.

JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,79augold,4,Thu Jun 18 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"That particular MOB was a nightmare, she would talk over her daughter to me as if her daughter wasn't there. The daughter wanted a very simple knee length (vintage) style dress in a very pale bluey green colour, it was very pretty and suited her. Her mother wanted...well, I can only describe it as ""more suitable for a night club than a wedding"". She brought loads of pictures to the first fitting and when I told her that I didn't make that kind of dress, it wasn't my style, and it wasn't what her daughter chose, she just sort of stuttered for a second and then carried on as if I'd never spoken. How her daughter didn't lamp her one I'll never know. I would regularly get phonecalls after each fitting where she'd try to change the dress, the styling, the colour, etc etc etc, all in this sort of syrupy sweet tone which suggested that we adults had to do the best for children like the bride! (bear in mind I was at uni at the time, so sub 21, and this bride was in her thirties).  Oh, and she kept dropping hints about trying to seduce the groom and being better in bed than the bride."

JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,baitaozi,6,Wed Jun 17 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"I think because they are such a new idea everyone has different opinions on them. So, maybe I shouldn't have been so annoyed when she asked me to do it. It was mainly that she didn't ask, but told me to do it without giving me the money for it. Like, if you need something you go ahead and pay for it. And we have a few different cupcake flavors and my fiance picked some of them so I felt like the table reflected both of us and what we like. And he picked the little cake we are going to cut too, but I like raspberry and chocolate as well :)"

JUSTNOMIL,3a61ot,esmetio,5,Thu Jun 18 22:58:59 2015 UTC,"The idea is that it is a richer, stronger flavor, like chocolate, than a traditional wedding or bride's cake.

JUSTNOMIL,3a5qvs,catsarethenewblack,8,Wed Jun 17 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"My MIL is the same way about gender. Except she wanted girls, not boys. Her oldest daughter only had sons.

BIL's wife just had another baby and it was a girl, so I guess she finally got her precious girl grandbaby. SIL has said that she wants to do gender neutral clothing for the baby, and MIL rushed out and bought a pink frilly shirt for the baby (just out of spite, I suppose). Meanwhile my husband and I are trying for a baby and I'm praying we have a boy when we do have one, because I don't want to deal with her craziness about girls."

Anyway, it was probably about 40-50 items deep and just all the frilliest, pinkest, most covered in lace shit you've ever seen. Not one thing that could be for a boy. I was totally silent bc I thought this was weird for a million reasons, but especially because she has one child- a son. And she makes comments like ""I raised him like a girl!"" all the time. So awk.   Anyywayyyy I'm 32 weeks pregnant. With a boy. The first thing I thought when I found out was HAHAHHA THAT'S WHAT MIL GETS FOR BUYING ALL THAT SHIT. She has actually given me what are obviously girls clothes and shoes for him since finding out he's a boy.

If he can't manage these things then he asks me.  But he should be able to do these things.  I had to do a lot of teaching when we first moved in together because of her behavior.  How to clean, grocery shop, get essentials, check mail.  Exhausting.  We constantly get guilt-tripped because husband moved 2 hours away to live in MY city.  It's 2 freaking hours!  I think her dream was to have all of her boys literally live on the same street and eat dinner at her house every day.  The best was when I learned she didn't speak to her mom for a year because MIL moved away at 18 to go to school.  MIL told her mom ""well that's what people do when they grow up.""  Umm.....can you please apply this to your life now MIL?  FIL is a huge baby and MIL is an enabler.  She does what he wants when he wants because otherwise he pouts.  Told us a story about how FIL played tennis then golf one day and when she came home after running pointless errands (buying shit for us we didn't need/want because we were coming to visit) all day he was sitting in a chair complaining he couldn't take his shoes off and was hungry.  What did she do?  She took his shoes off and made him a sandwich.  And then laughed like it was cute.  She gets flustered when I don't jump to husbands desires.

My SIL had a baby last year, and my inlaws bought a house near them, but even then they bought the house with the intention of fixing it up and flipping it, not to be their forever home (that's what they do). Six months after having the baby, SIL and her husband decide to move back to where her husband is from, which is only one state away.   You'd think my inlaws, who took their parents' grandchildren halfway across the country and never live in the same place for more than 2 years, would understand, right?? NOPE! They lost their minds. They were so upset that they were ""taking our grandbaby away."" I even defended SIL, I said how they move and change plans all the time, how could SIL make life plans based on where they are living when it always changes??

They didn't have any kids together (they were older), but they do not differentiate between kid vs. stepkid. My MIL is the nicest person on the planet, but if you ask her how her stepson is doing you get a VERY curt, icy response, and it's always the same. ""I don't HAVE a stepson.

JUSTNOMIL,3a29d8,CharistineE,10,Wed Jun 17 14:27:38 2015 UTC,My MIL gave my DH the silent treatment when we got engaged. (After her moaning and crying did not get him to come to his senses about me.) We ended up not getting married for 2 years. She only started talking to him again when it became clear that she was not getting a wedding invite.  I wish she had maintained that silent treatment.   Fast forward two more years and we're expecting. She's talked to me once in those two years. That's fine with me. Her and my husband talk about once a month now but we haven't seen her since the wedding where my entire family wanted to murder her.  It's not the complete silent treatment but good enough. Hope it continues like this after the little guy gets here. Luckily this will NOT be her first grandchild so there is hope.
JUSTNOMIL,3a29d8,CharistineE,9,Tue Jun 16 22:24:21 2015 UTC,"I really can't understand how any woman can give her own son the silent treatment; as if that is somehow the moral high ground or proving a point. As a Mom, a cold war with my sons is unthinkable.  If you are making her son happy and pregnant with his baby, your MIL should be kissing your ass and thanking God you exist.  My DIL makes my son happy and that's all I ever wanted for him.  Try to keep your MIL at arm's length if she has that kind of toxic personality. Make sure you and hub are on the same page about this. Don't let her get a foothold where she might try to drive a wedge between you.   Best wishes for a healthy pregnancy and easy delivery."
JUSTNOMIL,3a29d8,l-x,2,Tue Jun 16 23:27:56 2015 UTC,Thanks. He keeps his distance too because she is a pretty toxic person.  On top of that there is a cultural difference because she is from India but my husband was born and raised in the usa where there was almost no other Indians. She a) cannot accept that he is not culturally Indian and b) comes from a culture where you never accept or treat any kind of mental disorder so she is perfectly fine and it is all of her children's faults that they don't have a good relationship with her.

She just made the entire wedding about her and took every opportunity to put me and my family down since she was unhappy that her son choose me instead of a nice Indian girl. Played the victim and then tried to sabotage the wedding by leaving things necessary for the Hindu wedding in her hotel room, losing the car keys to the car with my sari,  etc.  For the most part, she's not in our lives so at some level it's not a big deal. But I wish she would get help. It's just not acceptable in Indian culture to do so and she is still very Indian despite living here since 1972."

JUSTNOMIL,3a29d8,beaglemama,2,Wed Jun 17 05:43:24 2015 UTC,"My MIL gave us the silent treatment when we were planning our wedding, because our wedding wasn't up to her standards (we had a small intimate wedding, she wanted us to invite over 60 additional people and to have a big fancy wedding) and we refused to give in. She even went so far as to try to plan a wedding behind our backs that we would then be expected to pay for. When my husband found out about it and told her to knock it off, she didn't speak to us for a few weeks. It was glorious."
JUSTNOMIL,3a29d8,ohfluffit,3,Wed Jun 17 16:34:57 2015 UTC,Real reason MIL wants the dozens of cousins is payback.

JUSTNOMIL,3a29d8,-purple-is-a-fruit-,2,Wed Jun 17 00:24:47 2015 UTC,Sounds exactly like my MIL as well.  Weddings are for celebrating.  Not settling perceived debts.  So lame.
JUSTNOMIL,3a29d8,baby_purple,2,Wed Jun 17 12:41:28 2015 UTC,So she was mad that she didn't get to invite a ton of people to another person's wedding? And then she hasn't talked to her family in 4 years?
JUSTNOMIL,3a29d8,l-x,3,Wed Jun 17 01:04:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. There are so many other stories about this woman's bizarre behavior over the years. She is just one of those people who thrives on negative energy. She loves nothing more than to sit and complain about other family members who (she believes) slighted her in some way. Jealousy, gossip, mockery and paranoia were constant patterns in every conversation. She always had a war going with someone in the family. When we became the focus of her rage we shielded ourselves with the strength of our own nuclear family.  We are open to healing the relationship, but we will not take the blame nor apologize as we have nothing to apologize for. It's all in her head."

Are you able to sit down and chat with her about why she wants these things to happen? In a non judgey, non confrontational way, just so you can understand it. It may be that she sees these things as a mum's badge of honour and wants them with your son - that shit needs to be locked down now as he's YOUR son and she should know her place as Granma. It may be that she has a friend who has had this happen to her and she's caught in a Granma war.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if perhaps she was this inappropriate witty our husband when he was little, and that's part of why he doesn't see it as strange. This sounds like very inappropriate sexual behavior toward your infant. If your husband is hounding you to let her behave the way she has been, then I would say you need to go behind his back and talk to a professional about these things. This behavior from MIL and the acceptance of it from your husband is NOT OK. it's not normal. This is your child we are talking about here. If you feel something is very wrong, which it definitely seems like in this case, then you need to take action to protect yourself and your son now! Don't wait.

JUSTNOMIL,3a1aya,ohfluffit,23,Tue Jun 16 13:22:24 2015 UTC,"We all know it isn't just about a vet.  It's about a lack of respect.  If we have a child and choose a pediatrician, does she think if I ever allow her alone with our child that she can just take the child to whatever pediatrician?     My MIL was like this with our cats. She would never change their litter boxes even though we cleaned them once a day, then it was our fault if they peed on her bed. She refused to feed them the food we would leave for her and buy them friskies, which would cause weight gain in one and weight loss in the other (among other bathroom problems).  I can tell you that now with a 14 month old, I was right when I used to say that if she couldn't be trusted to listen to our cat care instructions, that she wouldn't listen to baby care instructions. She has proven to be a dangerous, manipulative person around my kid. With #2 on the way, I already told her she either starts listening to hubs and I on child care or she will just not be allowed around our kids at all. She is already not allowed to even be in a separate room with our daughter.   Sorry for the rant. There really is no nice way to tell her that she needs to listen to you on doggie care. You need to be firm and follow through with consequences. Good luck with your MIL!"

My husband, unfortunately, didn't get the memo every other married couple does that when you get married, your own new family you just made becomes #1.  His parents won't come to me because I shut them down so it's all hidden which infinitely frustrating. One or both of them manipulated my husband into thinking we hadn't seen them in over a month when we'd had dinner with them 2 weeks earlier."

Trying to find a therapist but it's a lot harder than I thought it would be to find a male therapist near us (we tried a woman before and he would never go back).  The ILs have gotten super territorial since we got married and it's hard to really do anything about it when they won't try it with me directly and he feels this need to protect them.  I should have figured out MIL's over attachment when MIL was shocked(!!) to learn that MIL's cousin's two daughters (who I had met once) wouldn't be in my wedding party.  MIL's cousin apparently had this delusion as well and flipped out when that didn't happen.  I could write a novel on that whackadoodle."

MIL used to drive me crazy with my dogs (use a high-pitched voice, got them very excited; and the smallest one is about 50lbs) to the point where we won't even have the dogs in the house when they come over (we also have a cat who runs & hides every time he hears her & he's actually very social).  Now that we have a baby (I have a 9yo from a previous relationship that they have been around since she was 5)....holy. Shit.  She cries (as in sobs, not a little teary-eyed emotional but actual sobs) every time she holds him.  She tries to tell us what medical procedures we need to do and not do (actually lecturing my husband about vaccines - he'll get them when insurance kicks in, dammit!).  Tries to rename him.  Calls him ""my baby"" at every opportunity.  Keeps holding him while he cries for me no matter where we are (this has happened in the middle of a restaurant) saying ""I just LOVE it when they cry.  Isn't it cute?"" (No, goddamnit).  And she ignores my daughter.  I hate that woman with the fire of a thousand suns."

I see the battle on the horizon where if we go to have a baby and I want my mother there for my own medical procedure of giving birth, MIL will go behind the scenes like she always does (or, another preferred method, use her husband to do it) to whine to my husband about it not being fair.  We're talking about a 70 something FIL talking to my mid 30's husband about how things ""aren't fair to mommy"" I shit you not.  Husband doesn't even call her mom.  Ugh /rant."

My husband corrected her & said ""mom, we're calling him  Sunny"" - she looked at him & said ""no, his name is lil syl.""  It's amazing I had the restraint to let her keep her eyes at that point.  She's got some serious emotional issues but won't seek treatment; the whole family knows it but just ignore or enable her.  Luckily my husband isn't under any delusions about her and we can keep our distance (though a battle is brewing over where we go on the 4th, I know it's coming)."

It already came up last month.  So awesome that your husband can see what is happening and help out.  The name thing must get absolutely exhausting!!  I've read about other MILs battling over names.  Omg, you already raised your (kid).  Let it go, woman!    I'd like to say I'd tell her ""call my son the right name, or don't see him"" but, by me not knowing how to get boundaries with our dog, it's pretty clear that in practice I'm a wuss.

I banned her from my recovery room.  It. Was. Glorious.  And my family has always had a big to-do on the 4th (it was my grandparent's anniversary), so not only am I making the three hour trip up there for that, I'm staying the rest of the week, too.     With the name thing, MIL hates her middle name, Louise, so much that she dropped it when she got married.  She has requested to be called Grandmother X.  The next time she calls my son Syl she will become Granny Louie forever and for all time.

We'll make a decision and one of them will get upset and he'll change his mind.  They've become seriously territorial and possessive since we got married.  I'm not sure who it is more- FIL or MIL- but most recently one or both manipulated him into believing we hadn't seen them for over a month when we had just had dinner with them 2 weeks before.  That's why it was hard to write before because it's all behind the scenes.

I have two sets of inlaws (husbands parents are divorced and remarried) and have been married for 14 years.  I have had to manage their drama on a case by case basis.  Im not saying you should apologize.  Your note should say something like ""How awful that you have been upset about this all this time with out us knowing"". ""I am a new mother doing the best that I can"" ""It is very upsetting that you have taken this so personally at a time when I just want to focus on my newborn"" ""you are welcome to visit on [specific weekend after your mother leaves] as my mother has already made travel plans.""

This is a relationship killer, not a financial problem. Rent and wait it out until you can buy a house. Keep the distance needed to keep your family's sanctity and sanity. You're rushing things even though it is clear you know this is a bad idea. A marriage doesn't last when you let people in, even uninvited. Especially uninvited."

JUSTNOMIL,39w5oh,mymagicalbox,3,Wed Jun 17 11:10:32 2015 UTC,"To your husband, the behavior is normal. He grew up with it. It's also his mother so I'm sure he is convinced that either she can change or the dynamic will get better if only he does (insert reasoning any sane person knows won't work).   Point blank, she isn't going to change, and you already know what is coming. If it damaged or strained your relationship once then it most certainly will happen again. The money may sound like a good idea, but it's not. 6 months is a very long time to deal with crazy.   There are other things you could do to save money that don't require resenting your husband and plotting your MIL's murder. Find a room to rent, rent out a room in your apartment, go college style in a house with a bunch of roommates, look into loan options not requiring any money down (it does exist!!), look into rent to own options, go visit the personal finance subreddit, etc.   But moving into a bad situation with a person who has no boundaries or respect for any of you is a very bad idea and you already know it. Your husband is basing the idea off of the person he wants her to be and not the person she is.  Don't. Do. It."
JUSTNOMIL,39w5oh,Puffsdangerfield,3,Wed Jun 17 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"You pretty much already have your answer. You lived with her for three months and your relationship suffered. Now you are considering living with her for double that time? Oh hell no. Instead you could probably save a bit more here and there by making sacrifices on non essential goods/services.

Living with your in-laws could destroy your marriage.  It's just not worth it."

Still, with all of that, your husband will be in the middle all the time, your relationship with him will suffer (shit, i dont live with my in-laws, yet my MIL still somehow manages to make my husband and i fight cause she cant keep to herself) and you might walk out of this with no good relationship with your in-laws.

But it was a while ago and, if you factor in baby brain, I wouldn't bet the house on anything...  Edit to add:   I remember this bit because the author talked about when they cross a horse and a pony. The resulting adult is an intermediate size, but the size of the newborn foal depends on of the mother is the horse (bigger foal, but not as big as a horse/horse foal) or the pony (smaller foal).

JUSTNOMIL,39vlna,mnh1,3,Tue Jun 16 10:59:20 2015 UTC,"I was just about to add this. It's the same thing I was told by my doctors. My daughter (3 weeks as of yesterday) was 6lbs 7oz, and I was about 5 or 6 pounds when I was born. We were both a little early (early term).   I'm on the petite side (5'4"", size 4). My husband is a huge guy, but as he was born extremely early (as in, it's a miracle he survived and didn't have serious lifelong issues early) there's no way to know on his side. I'm an only child and all of his siblings are halves, so no more evidence."

JUSTNOMIL,39s1et,throwawayrandom7,3,Sun Jun 14 04:59:32 2015 UTC,"For the most part, it sounds like your mom isn't a great person to be around and I can understand why there are unresolved issues there, which may never warrant resolving if you've grown past her as a person.   But I did just want to point out:   She raised me in that situation even though she had multiple opportunities to get away,  My issue is the fact you still blame her for your shitty childhood 30 years later   Your situation with your mom sounds very similar to her situation with her mom. She's using resources from her parents, for whatever reason (perhaps she feels it's owed to her or something)... and you're doing the same, taking resources from your mom. You seem to blame her for your childhood issues too—probably legitimately.   The way to get out of this situation is simply to leave.   And I understand you're angry your mom is taking from your grandparents (I am too, just reading about it!), but that's their decision to make, and it's not your business that your mom isn't helping them in return. So again, the best you can do is leave so you're not participating in using those resources.   You say you're having trouble finding a job, but I assume that's because you're looking for something in your field after school. The fact is, sometimes you have to take something lesser to get your own life going, and keep applying for stuff in your field while working somewhere else. If you are really determined to get out of there, you can do it. You might have to move further away or something, but it sounds like that may be a good idea anyway.   And as an aside, if you have to take loans to go to school, there's no shame in that. And you'll have better earning potential afterwards than you do trying to save up for it now. So I don't really see a reason to wait, if it's something you're definitely planning on doing. Get some roommates and live near campus, or something. It'll still be better than your current situation."
JUSTNOMIL,39s1et,faiora,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  I will address some of your points, just because I felt you wrote it up so well!  1) I honestly don't blame her. I really don't. I blame her for her own life being in this state, and in essence how it affects me now. When in fact she should be the one helping me instead of the other way around. But I really don't blame her, it's in the past and I did have chances to get away but I stayed trying to help her.   2) I both disagree and agree. It's not my business that they help her, and I know I don't have any control, but I think I'm still within my right to comment on it. Because she's also affecting me, making it harder for me to do what I need to, and has also lied to me about how she would help.  3) I have applied to over 50 jobs, from state level to city level. From Human Resources to sales. From state jobs to fast food chains. I've had two friends look over my resume one who works for Human Resources at Amazon and the other who does recruiting at another Fortune 500 company. I'm looking for ANYTHING. I just don't have any job experience really, but when I've talked to managers at fast food places I've been told they are hesitant to higher me because they can't see me being there long. Every place I've interviewed at has offered me a job, unfortunately no where has really invited me to an interview since moving to this new state. Moving further away without a job lined up is not possible. I had to wipe out ALL of my savings when I had a surgery a few years ago, I have no capital to just move and hope I find something. I'm next to a major city, so I don't know where else I could go.  4) I agree, I just don't know if I want to go to Grad school. I'm not comfortable taking out a ton of loans for something I'm not 100% about, especially considering the higher earning potential is REALLY not there. I'd love doing that job I think, but the current average wage for it is around 45000. It's just not something that pays a ton unfortunately.   I really am okay being at my Gma's. They need me. And they are helping me pay bills and everything. Even after getting a job, I'd love to stay here for awhile and save up. My Gma and GreatGpa, have done so much for me, I can't justify leaving when they need me now."
JUSTNOMIL,39s1et,faiora,2,Wed Jun 17 21:45:35 2015 UTC,"1) Fair enough.   2) The only reason your mom is able to affect you is because you're putting up with it. You're sticking around. There is a point where letting someone affect your life becomes your problem, not theirs. That's kind of what I was getting at with the whole post.   3) Perhaps this is just something I don't have experience with, because I've never had problems finding a job, either before or after going to school, and I've had the luxury of turning down jobs along the way. The unemployment rate is slightly better in Canada than the US, so perhaps that's why... but it's not so different.   My suggestion at this point is to look at temp agencies in the city. If you start taking on some last-minute work for them with open availability, that could eventually lead to a full time placement, even if you only get a couple hours here and there at first. You can also continue to apply for jobs on your own, and the agency should have permanent placements they can put you forward for.   4) Also fair enough. It's not worth getting into debt if you're not sure.   You're living at grandma's? Does everyone live together? I thought from reading your post that you were living with your mom, and grandma was giving your mom money for rent and other living expenses, and presumably lived nearby. If you're all living together that's... yeah, even worse of your mom. And I understand why you want to stay and help grandma.   It's a tough situation, but there really is a point where you have to do what's best for you. It might ultimately be good to have a sit-down discussion with grandma about your difficulties being around your mom. Not necessarily to issue an ultimatum (mom leaves or you do), but to put the thought out there and make it clear you want to be around to help her. If she's giving your mom $3k/mo, then your mom can afford to live on her own. Not nicely, necessarily (depending where you live), but even where I live (very expensive city) that would pay rent and food without a problem."

JUSTNOMIL,39nkq7,allpregnantandshit,5,Sat Jun 13 12:47:24 2015 UTC,"Technically the dress is hers. She wore it to her own wedding 40+ years ago.  SIL can't afford a new dress so MIL is altering her old one. But MIL feels bad for staining it and promises to make sure it's cleaned out. Granted she didn't care enough to just, you know, protect it properly... The whole family is pretty careless about stuff (common sense apparently does run in families... Or in this case, doesn't) so it really wasn't a surprise. But then with the wedding in a week she can't get it dry cleaned between now and then in time so it really has to stay clean now."
JUSTNOMIL,39lyfm,SansPantsAfterWork,43,Fri Jun 12 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"Sounds like she needs to be taught how to speak to you.  I frequently use the response ""Are you asking me or are you telling me?"" With my 5 year old son. If the answer is (and almost always is a sheepish) ""asking"" I say ""then try again and ask this time."" And my son knows how to politely ask. If he doesn't, I'll usually spoon feed him how his question should go ""Mommy, may I please go outside?/ Would you please get my toy?/ May I please have a drink?"" And we can move on from there.  If the the answer is ever ""telling"" then all negotiations shut down and I say ""No, that doesn't work for me."" And leave the conversation.  I've used this on adults as well, varying use by how close we are and they'll usually get the picture. No one in my family tells me to do anything. I expect them to ask."

It's why I feel so conflicted about my birth choices, to be honest. There are areas where I don't feel trusting of my doctors and that's hard on me. I don't like thinking my doctor might have ulterior motives behind suggesting induction or a c-section, for example. And I don't think doctors (or even dieticians) are well enough educated in nutrition (with unbiased education) to provide solid and individualized advice to patients. But at the same time, I want to think ""my doctors keep up to date on this stuff"" and ""my doctors' advice is best.""

Of course, my experience was just the experience of one person meeting one dietitian.  Basically I was handed a bunch of pamphlets and literature with info about the Canadian food guide, and given some instructions to eat low fat dairy products. This after making it clear I'd like to eat foods with minimal processing, so low fat dairy wasn't really in the cards for me.   If that dietitian was as helpful and educated and able to personalize diet plans as she should have been, she could have done a number of things to help me:   She could have discussed other ways I could get the same benefits as the Canada Food Guide diet she was recommending She could have explained to me the importance of low fat dairy products instead of just telling me I'm wrong for eating full fat dairy products instead She could have discussed the actual vitamins and nutrients I should be trying to put in my system, instead of focussing on a group of foods she recommends to every person she meets with.    Also, funny thing, since switching to my current whole foods diet (whole grains, whole dairy, etc.) I've been meeting my body composition goals for the past ~year without using her advice, and surprisingly without having to make other changes (aside from not eating processed food). Turns out we don't need low fat dairy products to thrive. Go figure.   Doctors have to work with special patient requirements all the time; it's an expected part of being a doctor. If a patient declines a certain procedure, a doctor is expected to know the next best thing for that patient."

JUSTNOMIL,39hvse,fruitjerky,4,Fri Jun 12 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"I grew up with a piano, I took three years of lessons. I STILL can't play it. I have the musical talent of a turnip. If your kid has musical aptitude, that's great. They'll start Orchestra or Band and they'll be good at it. Or, they might not. And if they desperately LOVE piano, you'll get a keyboard. Or, hey, you'll fork over the money yourselves several years down the road.   Learning an instrument is hard and it has to come from a passion. I took violin, piano, and saxophone and I sucked at all three. I mean, I was BAD. I have no rhythm. Don't break the barriers over a thing that might not end up being practical for your family. Plus, if it turns out no one CAN play the piano, what the hell are you going to do with it?"

Is she showing any other signs of dementia?  I'm not sure she's competent to watch anybody.

You're home, so even if it's a 10-12 year old, they will keep the kids occupied while you get work done.  Lots of young tweens want to babysit to get experience and at that age, they still love to play.  It's not as expensive as an experienced older sitter, but you're home, so it's not as important.

At my MIL's house it's completely different than Mom's.  Can't add salt or pepper(even though it's on the table) because you will be interrogated... Was it not seasoned properly?  Did you not enjoy? You have to eat enough, but not too much.  You cant leave food on your plate because you'll hear about it.  You have to try everything or you'll hear about it and possibly be called picky.  You have to keep the kids spotless(they are almost 3 years old).  If you go out to eat she will suggest what to order...  The so and so is x amount.  Its good and won't be too much food...  Why did you only order water and that meal are you watching your weight now?  I would cook dinner but I didn't think y'all would eat it.  Why did you bring fruit we have food here(no fruit the kids will eat).....  My stomach and brain hurt when we make plans to visit or :::shiver:::: they come here(because my house has to be spotless and everything just so the entire visit) even if its weeks in advance.  High anxiety kicks in.  Edit: and while I'm venting because it felt good to get that out... Last visit she flat out said to my face I got fat when I was pregnant.  I was pregnant with twins, gained 42lbs and lost all the weight 6 days later.  It was a really hard pregnancy and I have medical issues still from how much stress it put on my body.  My kids weighed 7lb7oz and 6lb6oz.  I try not to let anything the in-laws say bother me but goodness I just wish I could get through one day without feeling like total ass or angry after it because something they said."

JUSTNOMIL,39ft82,catsarethenewblack,9,Thu Jun 11 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you but it wasn't anything I did.  I think carrying so much baby and them having separate placentas and everything made it use a heck of a lot if energy to maintain.  I was chugging water constantly and eating constant(had to limit salt because swelling so I ate a lot of protein, veggies and fruit).  Couldn't get full or feel hydrated."

JUSTNOMIL,39ft82,pregornot,11,Thu Jun 11 16:06:42 2015 UTC,I hope you're not my MIL because if you were I'd hear about posting this for the next 10 years....  And probably get the silent or very short treatment.  Although that might be nice... I had that happen during the first 5 years of marriage.  You may or may not be wondering what caused that.  It was because I asked her to stop opening our mail and paying my husband's bills because I needed to know what our finances were.  I entered marriage with no debt and he had credit cards and some other things that needed paid off.  She went ballistic.  Then she started in on how I drove a wedge because he didn't call often even though I would ask a few times a week if he talked to his parents because I call my mom almost daily.  It took him 4 years to stand up to them and another year for them to back off.  I still catch the shit end of it more often than I care to.  Sometimes I screw up and don't even know I'm doing it.  Once she got livid because I wore my light jacket in the house.  She said I didn't want to be there is why I didn't take off my jacket.  The real reason is I was cold and didn't honestly think anything about offending someone.  It wasn't like it was a huge coat that looked like an Eskimo.  It was a light jacket.  Lol.

""oh no, this isn't for eating!"" don't be absurd, you stupid cow!  as for the fat comment, i'd totally laugh in her face and straight up be like, ""luckily i was able to lose it. it gets a lot harder with age, though, doesn't it? and you don't have the excuse of carrying twins."" it 100% doesn't matter what her weight is.   i don't actually advocate doing any of these things, but fantasizing about doing them can make you a happier person."
JUSTNOMIL,39ft82,l-x,4,Thu Jun 11 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for making me laugh.  I imagined her pursed lips, crossed arms and her nose up... I have imaginary retorts after the fact.  It kind of makes me stew wondering wtf I've done to make them be that way but again I try to tell myself they had to be born that way and I try* to let it go.  I really just hold it in.  One of these days though I'm terrified of when I can't hold it in anymore and all these years of keeping quiet just comes out at once.  Really hope I can just keep it in because if I break there will be a smear campaign and I'll be the talk of the family and never live it down and it will be worse.  Her one daughter is like a bulldog.  I once got my head bit off for saying ""yes ma'am"" when she asked if i wanted coke to drink.  I keep it civil for my kids but once they are older if it starts happening in front of them I will have to stand up and won't hesitate.  Mess with me, let me be the ""verbal punching bag"" for the family keeping the heat off everyone else but don't bring my kids into it."

JUSTNOMIL,39ft82,tardisgater,3,Thu Jun 11 17:54:16 2015 UTC,"Her daughter gained over 100 with one and she doesn't say mean things about it.  Bodies deal with pregnancy so different.  Its not fair to comment on a pregnant persons weight unless its encouraging because pregnancy already comes with so many worries in my own opinion.  Her oldest daughter's middle girl just had tests ran because she isn't as tiny as the first daughter.  Everything came back normal but because she wasn't a size 2 they all thought there was a medical issue.  I stand up for her every time they try to talk to me about it.  It is so unfair to treat a teenage girl like that or anyone else.  I make sure to tell her she's so beautiful and looks great every single time I see her because she is beautiful and looks great, they are just warped.  Some people are just mean as hell.  Would you believe me if I said they go to church every time the door is open?  Then they tell me about every 3rd visit me or my kids are going to hell because we don't go to church.  It's exhausting trying to rationalize it or cope with it.  I try to stay no contact in between trips(we live far enough away it takes a weekend to visit) so it makes it more tolerable.  I should take her advice she told my husband last time when she was voicing her opinion of me to him... That I shouldn't care what other people think.  That story was my husband wanted to take our toddlers on a dinner cruise.  My thought was if they meltdown it would be disrespectful to the other passengers so we should go to an earlier family cruise and prepare well(books, crayons, snacks, cell phone games) in case there was an issue or they hated being on a boat.  She hated the fact I cared about the other passengers and said my kids are so good I shouldn't put that on them.  They are good kids, they are still toddlers and shit happens.  Tantrums happen.  Its a part of it, I've never known a kid to not have a meltdown ever in public.  Shew!  Is it normal to feel a weight lifted after letting go of things?  Just writing it out makes me feel better and you guys support makes me feel normal for being upset about these things.  I should have spoken sooner."
JUSTNOMIL,39ft82,havinabadtime,9,Thu Jun 11 18:57:24 2015 UTC,The only difference if this meal were at my MIL's house is that she'd insist everyone eat at least two full sized donuts and half a pound of gummi bears. Apparently it's not a meal unless you feel like you want to die afterward at her house!
JUSTNOMIL,39ft82,golocalsportsteam,2,Thu Jun 11 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"Lol, mine, too. I love her, she's very sweet, but she will shove an entire Sara Lee pound cake at you and expect you to eat a good sized hunk of it while talking about how it's so bad to eat unhealthy things.   But she does this in other areas as well. In the same breath, she will tell you that you'd better go take a nap and get some sleep while she's shoving food at you and demanding that you eat something. And she will acknowledge that she is over-stimulating my toddler seconds before sweeping him up and swinging him around until he's so dizzy he literally throws up his breakfast of blueberry French toast all over our newly-cleaned rug. And then when one-week-postpartum me sticks my head out of my room where I've been breastfeeding my newborn to see what all the commotion is about, she will chide me for not sleeping, and try to shove food at me.   Sigh...I really do love her so much, she's so wonderfully sweet...but sometimes she's so desperate to take care of everyone that her wires get crossed."

JUSTNOMIL,39g0kt,Yassssmaam,10,Thu Jun 11 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"Can I suggest ""I was hurt and upset by the news being leaked on Facebook?"" She needs to know specifically what she did. It will help avoid her using the situation to create more drama for you. Because she sounds like the type to run to everyone else with something like ""she's mad at me for no reason and I don't know why!!!""   Also make a suggestion for what you'd like to see ""in the future I need to know you will respect me when I ask you not to share something. This was very hard for me...""

Also, the referring to herself as mummy thing is super gross and totally inappropriate. You are the mother, not her, and if she wants to relive her early motherhood, get a puppy. I'd get your husband to talk to her about that one next time it happens.

JUSTNOMIL,39f8y9,l-x,12,Thu Jun 11 10:02:28 2015 UTC,"i wonder if it might make sense to:    get a lock installed - (not like a deadbolt, but a privacy lock). this way, if you need privacy, or are sleeping, there's an easy way for her to know and not bother you without making it an issue. ask before installing it, obviously, but it might make it less of a ""YOU need to stop doing this,"" and more of a ""WE will just keep the door locked when we're napping / changing / need privacy / whatever."" the door being closed isn't enough. if she unlocks a locked privacy knob, y'all got bigger problems. as someone else suggested, DEFINITELY buy a mini fridge for breast milk. that way it's not an issue. offer to cover the difference in the electricity bill. you can frame it as more convenient for you and as a way to conserve space in the shared fridge/freezer.  find out what the cleaning schedule is like. if she's cleaning because that's just her routine, offer to do the vacuuming throughout the house, not just in your room. it's almost certainly a pretense to get in there and invade your privacy, but make it a moot issue by insisting that you help with chores. that way, if she tries that shit again, ""oh, we already vacuumed,"" might shut her down."
JUSTNOMIL,39f8y9,l-x,23,Thu Jun 11 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your reply.   We are going to get a lock. This post is more about the principle that we even need to go to those lengths to keep her out! I posted this to someone below but my story was my husband and I had got the baby down and were DESPERATE for just a little kiss and a cuddle. I knew there was no way his mom would be able to survive half a hour without barging in so I put a dresser infront of the door. Sure enough, about ten minutes later, the door opens and hits the back of the dresser. Instead of realising like A NORMAL PERSON that we were clearly wanting a bit of privacy she continued to try to open the door and saying ""Why do you guys have a dresser in the way?"" I honestly think the woman has a few screws missing but nobody in her family sees it.  Oh and I'll for sure be getting the fridge!"
JUSTNOMIL,39f8y9,fruitjerky,7,Thu Jun 11 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"oh, it's totally fucked that you have to go to those lengths, but it's 100% worth it for your sanity. if she starts picking the lock, then y'all know it's time for a more serious chat to figure out what's realistic for the next few months, cos that's bananas. it's a good middle step between ""yo, this lady is INSANE and dangerous,"" and like, no, she's just a clueless asshole.  so like, serious and important question, how the fuck did your husband live there as a teenage boy? did she like, casually observe him masturbating while she vacuumed? i thought moms of boys had a better sense of personal space and privacy because of the whole ""I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR WEINER.

My SO's mother has barged in on us a few times before while we visited her and one time she did it when I was sitting on top of him kissing him, as we were about to go to bed. Nothing more than that was going to happen, but I think walking in on that made her realize "" oh, my son is in a relationship and needs more boundaries now"". It's not that she didn't know that before, but seeing it with her own eyes helped her understand it with a clarity that a simple explanation or conversation never would have achieved.   So let her barge in on your private cuddle/kissing time and get an eyeful. Maybe she will get it then.

We'd really appreciate it if you left the breastmilk alone, and we promise to keep track of it and throw it out ourselves when it's expired. Thank you."" Be prepared that she may ramp it up and push back at first, and may even go as far as to threaten with kicking you out. It may be helpful to make sure that everyone is present when you talk to her/reprimand her (as in FIL and DH) so she can't turn you into the mean unreasonable DIL. If you don't do this though, there's a good chance that you'll either move out suddenly after you just can't take it anymore or you'll stay and resent her for years to come, even after you're in your own house."

It's difficult for me because I have usually asked my husband to reinforce the boundaries, because if I do it (even nicely) I'll sound like I'm a horror. Also, I'm very bad at confrontation. He's a soft touch though. Like I said she isn't a bad woman at all, probably the nicest friend you could have, she's just a nightmare of a MIL. Thank you for your response. It was a very good solution."

I knew there was no way his mom would be able to survive half a hour without barging in so I put a dresser infront of the door. Sure enough, about ten minutes later, the door opens and hits the back of the dresser. Instead of realising like A NORMAL PERSON that we were clearly wanting a bit of privacy she continued to try to open the door and saying ""Why do you guys have a dresser in the way?""

JUSTNOMIL,39d2qe,rbnthrowaway13,9,Wed Jun 10 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"First off, you and your husband sound like wonderful people to be willing to take care of your grandmother's needs when the rest of your family has done nothing but abuse, neglect, and take advantage of her. They should honestly be reported to the authorities. But I digress.  I'm not sure how you should relay this to your grandmother exactly. I can understand not wanting to hurt her feelings or set her off, but you also need to make sure that it is perfectly clear that she is not, under any circumstances, to attempt to care for your child unattended. And if she is falling often, I would even caution you to be wary on that front. I don't think I have to make it graphically clear how damaging and/or lethal being fallen onto from an adult's height could be for your newborn.   So yes, there's surely a tactful way of relaying the information. But I would keep a close eye on her around your child if she can't seem to accept your rules. Your child's safety is more important than her feelings.  Also, have you or your husband considered a retirement facility of some kind? It sounds like she could use at least some short term physical therapy for her balance issue or she could end up with a broken hip or worse."
JUSTNOMIL,39d2qe,whatthecrump,5,Wed Jun 10 23:54:41 2015 UTC,"Those are great points, thank you. I have looked into assisted living situations, and she just doesn't make enough to cover the cheapest place that I can find. They are pretty pricey.   Suggesting rehabilitation for her falling and unstable walking is a superb idea! I will look into this stat.   I have told her that when this kid comes that I plan to nurse. I had hoped that she would have gotten the picture, but she just hasn't.   My Nanny is a handful, but bless her heart. I just puked up dinner and she is in the kitchen doing dishes. She insisted, and I didn't put up any kind of fight about that!   I may have to steer her toward more house-chore type help when the time comes. That way she can still be useful and busy, and not potentially dropping the baby.   Thank you."
JUSTNOMIL,39d2qe,allpregnantandshit,7,Thu Jun 11 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I might subtly let her know that ""helping with the baby"" is more like doing dishes, folding laundry, tidying up and other small and doable chores so that mommy can focus on the real infant care."
JUSTNOMIL,39d2qe,starla79,4,Thu Jun 11 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, this. Let her know how she can help you out around the house so you can spend more time with the baby (especially if you're nursing)."
JUSTNOMIL,39d2qe,Syrinx221,3,Thu Jun 11 03:25:54 2015 UTC,"Fantastic idea! And not just blowing smoke up her ass either. I have a two and a half week old and my husband and I are looking to hire a good housekeeper type - we like taking care of our daughter, but the house is a disaster zone."
JUSTNOMIL,39d2qe,baby_purple,3,Thu Jun 11 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe she doesn't actually mean that she thinks she'll be left alone with the baby. She might just mean helping with things like, holding the baby while you throw in a load of laundry or something. Or she could just be saying that to save face to her friends and family members, because it's less embarrassing than saying that none of her other family members will take care of her anymore."

JUSTNOMIL,39d2qe,ReadingRainbowSix,2,Thu Jun 11 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"I realm agree with /u/baby_purple. Your grandmother may not even realize she isn't ""taking care"" of the baby. Simply being around you and the baby together might be enough. I wouldn't bring up the fact she wont ever be alone with your child until she explicitly asks about it.

JUSTNOMIL,394gdu,bermyWHAT,19,Tue Jun 9 14:16:29 2015 UTC,"You can tell her that story about the man who stayed in his house when there was a flood.   The man was watching TV when the news broke that the rivers were flooding and disaster was imminent. His neighbor came to the house and said he could give him a ride out of town before the flood hit but he said no, ""God would save him.""   The waters rose.   He climbed on his roof. Another neighbor rowed by on a boat and asked if he wanted to get in but he declined saying, ""God would save him.""   The waters continued to rise, they waves were coming over the roof of the house.   A helicopter swooped overhead and told him to climb the rope, but he once again declined saying, ""God would save him!""   The man died.  When he was in Heaven he asked God why he didn't save him when he had so much faith.  God replied, ""I sent you a fucking car, boat, and a bloody helicopter! What more did you want!?"""

I'm a lawyer and half my job is persuading people that their plans are ridiculous and wrong and won't work. The other half is doing the simple things that people were too emotional or misguided to handle themselves.   And trust me. No lawyer will be surprised that she just froze and watched the oncoming train of foreclosure. It happens all the time. A good lawyer will have a quick plan and should be able to get her out of the house. Also a great lawyer will know to use references to God (I know that sounds cynical, but we are talking about dragging someone out of the oath of a disastrous life ruining train... You have to do what works).   PS - you could even tell her God told you to hire a lawyer. She needs something to make sense in terms she understands. Otherwise she will just stay frozen with fear.   I hope this doesn't make me sound like an awful person. I really just hate to see old people lose their house for no reason, and I know from experience that the more right you are, the harder it can be for some people to understand. I just had to have three separate meetings to explain that paperwork filed after the deadline resulted in default. The client would go away, talk to a moronic relative, and come back with a complaint like ""well ianreallyb should not matter when the paperwork was filed because you can get Forbearance."" (Sure. But only if you file your paperwork on time so you qualify). So I explain again. They trot off looking doubtful...

JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,Ilovegoku11,27,Thu Jun 4 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"He doesn't think she's sincere, and doesn't really want to have a relationship with her. I'm an only child, so I desperately wanted to believe that she's coming around. But deep down I know he's right. She's not sincere, and she doesn't care about me. The more I read these posts and am on Reddit, the more I'm convinced she's a narcissist. I know my husband sometimes is conflicted about what kind of relationship and contact he wants to have with her, but I think that's because he wants to please his parents. She really is horrible. His best friend died of cancer a year ago, and she texted him her condolences. He happened to be shaving his beard at the time so he didn't respond right away. She tried to start a war with him, I kid you not. She was ""trying to reach out to her brother, and he was ignoring her"", and even got their mother involved. She then tried to do the same thing five days later when we were at his funeral. More recently, she posted a ""happy 2nd anniversary"" post to us on Facebook. We weren't on our phones/Internet at all that day. We were out celebrating. We went to parks, the conservatory, dinner...you know, things couples might do on their anniversary. We didn't see the post until 8 that night, then she took it down and went on a rant about ""rude ass people"" and how it must be exhausting to be that rude all the time. Every time we bring up her behavior to his parents, we aren't being understanding, that this is how she is and how she reaches out. UGH."

JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,alexgodden,15,Thu Jun 4 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"Okay, serious question time:   Why does she feel entitled to a relationship with your children in any way? Whether or not she likes you, she would have to be the kind of person you want to have access to her children in order for that to happen. But it sounds like she thinks that, because your baby now exists, she has some form of claim to it? I really don't get it at all. Why do other people think she is entitled to see you or your children? Even if your MIL thinks it's a miserable, crying shame that her children aren't close, that literally means nothing. If your husband wants no contact with her, then it's his AND YOUR choice. Also you're not obligated to let anyone into your lives that you don't want there, regardless of other peoples' creative rationalizations as to why you are. NOT TO MENTION, she is openly shitty to you? Why would any one on earth think it would make sense for you to want to have anything to do with her after she flagrantly treats you that way? Again with the baby. Whyyyyyy is she so obsessed with getting to know the baby and not bothering to repair/maintain a relationship with you? Doesn't that strike anyone else as weird? Like, she is strictly, specifically focused on the baby as if somehow it isn't going to turn out to be something that eventually grosses her out or becomes tiresome. Why the fixation on that?"
JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,alexgodden,11,Thu Jun 4 18:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to answer your questions to the best of my ability.   1 I'm assuming she feels entitled to a relationship with my children for the same reason that she felt she was entitled to make my wedding into her own dream wedding. That this is her ONLY BROTHER'S CHILD (she would always scream at me in all caps that it was her only brother's wedding whenever I asked her why she was trying to undermine me). Because Husband is her only brother, she feels she has a claim.  2 Because she's family. And ""family is forever."" 3 She's a ""baby whisperer"". She loves babies. Believe me, it strikes me as weird, too, that people find it acceptable for her to have a relationship with this baby, but not with the baby's parents."
JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,alexgodden,13,Thu Jun 4 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, regarding #2? Let me tell you right now, that is a bunch of bullshit. Family is only forever if the family treats you like family. She's not doing that, so she forfeited her rights as a family member literally the very instant that shitty behavior began. Not to mention, you don't actually want anything to do with her? People need to mind their business and fuck off.  I'm really sensitive about that ""family is forever"" attitude because I went completely no-contact with my own mother 5 years ago and people still give me shit for it to this very day. They don't know that she allowed me to be physically, verbally, and sexually abused in my own home (usually by/including her presence, though not sexually) from the time I was 4 until I moved out at 17, and that she blames me for all of it and for ruining her life. I'm sure that, if they did, they would not be so trite about ""but she's your MOTHER"", blah blah blah.  So anyway, the point is, I cut her off, chose/created my new family, and THEY are my family now. You are the architect of your own life, and you have a right not to feel guilty about building a safe and happy ecosystem for yourself, your husband, and your child(ren). I implore you to do this.  As the old adage says, ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.""  Tell this bitch to GTFO and never come back."

It's none of their business how you conduct your life.   SIL is really mad that we have friends that we refer to as family, because it pisses her off that these people might be called aunt or uncle by our children some day. How did she put it, again? oh yeah...it pisses her off that we put friends before her period end. Well maybe if you were a decent human being we wouldn't have this issue. Maybe.    Thank you so much for the advice and support. I really appreciate it."
JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,AmberRabbit,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"1) So he's her ""only brother"" when she can get something out of the relationship, but ""her parents' other child"" the rest of the time.  2) If you're only ""family"" when it helps her then she isn't family.  3) It doesn't matter how much she wants to be around babies.  If she's unhealthy and malicious then she doesn't get to be around this baby.  She doesn't sound safe let alone like a good candidate for someone to spend time around your child.  What she wants weighs nothing against your baby's right to safety and your emotional health."
JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,AmberRabbit,9,Fri Jun 12 00:39:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah that's a big effin NOPE. No way dude. People can't treat you like dogshit for years and then expect you to just hand over your children like ""here ya go! Try not to talk shit about me to them or completely undermine my parenting because you're a crazy vindictive bitch!""  Seriously I would NEVER trust someone who feels this way about me with my kids. She will make you look like an asshole every chance she gets and then sign off for your kid to get a tattoo when they're 14.  Keep her at bay. Poor little baby doesn't get everything she wants. Maybe she'll get that it's a lesson in treating people how you want to be treated."
JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,AmberRabbit,12,Thu Jun 4 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I am terrified of letting her babysit for that reason. Who knows what kind of poison and thoughts she is going to put in my child's head.   And that is why I have vowed never to leave my children unattended with SIL. I posted on another thread that Husband's cousins have this arrangement with the grandparents. The oldest gets to go to Grandma and Grandpa's one weekend a month to spend time together and bond. My MIL wants us to have that same arrangement when our child is born. There are many reasons why that's not happening: 1) As of right now, I plan on breastfeeding so my child can't be that far away from me, 2) Husband's cousins may be comfortable doing that, but I am not, 3) SIL still lives at home. MIL brought this up at a family picnic last summer (so well before I got pregnant), and it was tense and awkward. Becoming pregnant has just strengthened my resolve that this will not happen."
JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,carnu,4,Thu Jun 4 19:13:23 2015 UTC,Has she ever even apologized for the rude stuff she says? Can you call her out on that? Say - in public - that you are not responding to anything except her apology for [x specific thing]?
JUSTNOMIL,38iypn,LadyOfSighs,5,Fri Jun 5 12:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. She has ""apologized"" to me. Her apology was via text, and she said, ""I'm sorry for everything and whatever happened in the past two years. I'm sorry for how you felt I did or said anything that was worth breaking our relationship....""  There's more to her apology but it's just Bible quotes, and how she wants us to invite her to our city's pro-soccer games again. I told her I was sorry, too, for everything that happened, and that if I could go back I wish I could have handled some things differently. I told her I would like to work on our relationship, but I don't think it will ever go back 100% to what is was before all this happened. And she played dumb. She asked me what she could have possibly done aside from calling me a bitch. So I told her some of the things that came to memory at that point in time. I reminded her that she told Husband to choose between us and if he chose wrong, he would lose her forever, she insulted my friends, said I would never be a part of the family, and then there was that whole fiasco where she held our house key hostage for over a month.  And, you know, we did work on our relationship a little bit after that. But then she reverted back to her old ways of social media sabotage. I found out that she told people when she was at culinary school that Husband DIED so she could be excused from classes and her job. WHO DOES THAT?! She has also continued to tells lies and rumors to his father's side of the family about Husband so much so that that family has taken her side, and won't speak to us.   I could try calling her out in public, but that could also potentially backfire if the family comes to her defense."

I just said that if that was what he wanted to wear I didn't see anything wrong with it and it's not our choice to make. She shut up for a good ten minutes.

I'll avoid the topic with MIL. She's all super generous and kind, but she's also a fundie so her kindness does not extend to LBGT folk. When San Fransisco was in the Super Bowl she rooted against them because ""they like the gays there!"""
JUSTNOMIL,38arvv,squirrelscout,9,Wed Jun 3 01:35:27 2015 UTC,I keep checking my MIL's Facebook (I unsubscribed from her constant updates about missing dogs and how abortion is murder) to see what kind of hateful article she will choose to share under the guise of being a sweet Christian but so far- nothing!

I've been slightly rabid about Caitlyn for the past day or so because my Spouse is MtF and I'm having a difficult time not taking internet transphobia personally. I feel like I am defending my family every time I stand up for Caitlyn.   FWIW, my mom is unaware of Spouse's status but loves to use religion as a way to swing around her bigotry and ignorance.

JUSTNOMIL,38arvv,plasticcastle,7,Wed Jun 3 11:06:58 2015 UTC,"I think its possible to be feminist and want to look prettier. Its a question of ""do I want to look this way, or do others just want me to look this way?""."
JUSTNOMIL,38arvv,SansPantsAfterWork,7,Wed Jun 3 11:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never understood how feminists ""aren't allowed"" to have cosmetic surgery.

JUSTNOMIL,38arvv,-purple-is-a-fruit-,3,Wed Jun 3 13:26:13 2015 UTC,I agree. I didn't get into the reasons she wants to have plastic surgery - she doesn't like the idea of other people thinking she looks old.

I saw on facebook last night that my MIL liked an extremely bigoted article calling Bruce/Caitlyn a monstrosity and how evil and wrong it was. A crime against God and nature and a ploy for attention and publicity. I cried. I am 4 months pregnant with my first and I do not want my child to be raised (or help raised in this case) by people with such closed minded views.  She is extreme Catholic, and it just annoys me to no end how ""love your neighbor"" turns into ""love everyone except different people who may be hurting in a way you can't understand.""  I would love to tell her I am completely ashamed of her, but I am a wuss.  But I am more than prepared to put my fut down that I don't want her discussing anything like this with my future kid.  My own mom hasn't said anything yet, but I will definitely speak freely about my views on the subject to her."

We've chatted about it, so DH knows that unless we are REALLY hard up, not to let her give us any more money.)   She also treats him like he's still 15. Drives me batty. If she knows that we're driving to Seattle to see BIL or whoever, she'll text every 10 minutes to ask where we are/why aren't we there yet/why is no one responding to her. Did that when we came home for a wedding we were in, said we'd be back at Midnight. 10:30 or so, I started getting txts asking why we weren't back yet/if we were okay/if we needed a ride because we were drunk/why hadn't we left yet/where are you/what's happening/the house is locked (we had a key/garage code...moot point)/etc. Then BIL would start texting saying that we needed to answer MIL because she was asking HIM if he knew.

Its extremely civilised until the outskirts, then it abruptly becomes bush. It's the same as Sydney, just smaller.  In my entire 20 years in Sydney I only met two scary spiders, and one scary snake. Everything else was as harmless as your average wildlife on other countries.  We also only have two scary large animals. Who both stay in and around the water. If you want to be super paranoid, just limit your non pool swimming to netted beaches and you won't encounter any of them.  I've lived in both Australia and the US, and I'd say that everyday life in the Midwest is much much more dangerous than Sydney. There's ice and blizzards, people with guns, and I'm not sure if there were bears there but we saw some within a few hours driving distance of where we were staying."

Here, all suburbs have footpaths and relatively frequent buses to the city and other suburbs, and dedicated bike paths as well as bike lanes along most arterial roads.  Your ""dangerous animal"" concern is almost totally baseless, by the way. That's mainly people on reddit who have never even been to Australia talking it up for fun.

I suppose this person's in-laws are crazy and could choose to go on their separate netflix profiles to silently judge her or to mess with her...

On ours, my husband and I have separate profiles, and we have a ""shared"" profile for watching things together. It's helpful to keep track of where we are in a show together which we might have previously watched by ourselves, for example. Also, I think it saves settings like subtitles.   Also, subtitles are awesome. We always have the subtitles on. Partially because I mis-hear things sometimes, partly because they're hilarious.

They even sent him an email saying that if he stopped cleaning up after me, that would ""send the message"" and that I would start cleaning up after myself.

Consequently we went back and forth for the last 3-4 years and the last convo was basically him saying it wasn't right for us to have a child. We have 4 between the both of us 3 mine, 1 his, and no child that is both of ours. He has many good reasons why but I feel like his mothers negativity played a part in it as well."

She's one of those custodial parents who likes the check that comes from my DH each week, but manages to fill up all of her time with her son with babysitters and poorly timed work shifts (doesn't work while he's in school all day, leaves for work right when he gets off the bus in the afternoons)"

She had been in SDs life since my SO had won custody of her and did pretty much what you're going through with BM. She wanted to exert her will like a BM and used SD to control SO and his family. She had SD and Mil pretty brainwashed and after having issues with her all the time she was with SO, all of a sudden, she was the favorite.

My SO's exgf didn't even spend time with SD until she found out he was dating me. Then she started asking for overnight visits and more and more days during the week. My SO felt bad for SD because she was so attached to exgf even though she wasn't her BM. For awhile everyone led SD to believe ex gf was her BM (at the insistence of my MIL)! What kind of craziness is that! My mother would never chose and ex over the wishes of her own child. Shit! I even found out that my MIL would tell my SD, ""Let's call your mom so you can talk to her."" So SD wasn't even asking to talk to her! Ex gf once even had the audacity to say my SO should pay her child support! She even told SD that if she said lies about me SO would eventually get tired of me and she could ""come back home"" WTF!

JUSTNOMIL,37okf3,natidread,1 point,Fri May 29 17:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure my in-laws have ever managed to get my birthday right. They always think it's the day before or the day after.

JUSTNOMIL,37nx6h,Kryssanth,38,Fri May 29 00:58:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think the longer you continue to just let them behave this way with no consequences, the harder it's going to be to get them to change.

JUSTNOMIL,37nx6h,symfonies,8,Fri May 29 01:28:15 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree about not punishing them, that's entirely counter productive. But establishing boundaries and keeping firm on them is not a punishment. It's a way of making sure your child doesn't get left in the car to nap, or have blankets put in the cot. It's about making sure they aren't telling your children what a terrible mother you are in the future, or ignoring your wishes and introducing food they shouldn't be, or a thousand other things you trust someone will do when you entrust your children's well being to them, you know?"
JUSTNOMIL,37nx6h,baby_purple,9,Fri May 29 01:42:39 2015 UTC,"Husband (who has been reading this thread, btw) is establishing the boundaries, and I think they'll respect that (at least for a while). I'm half avoiding them at the moment because I know they'll grovel a bit next time I see them, and I'm not ready for that.   FIL has been guilty in the past of the old talking to the baby routine: ""Oh, is your Mummy depriving you of X?"" That one hasn't happened for a while, since I said something like, ""No, Mummy is making sure that baby doesn't choke to death on X."" Good grief."

JUSTNOMIL,37nx6h,Tygria,5,Mon Jun 1 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should take this woman aside and politely explain that her joke isn't funny or ok to you. My mom loves to make jokes about me being a bad student and didn't see anything wrong with it until I told her how hurtful it was.   Even if your MIL does know how hurtful it is, it seems like it would be better to fix this now, in a one time conversation, than go through the drama of cutting her out. Tell her that while she may find it funny, you find it hurtful and rude and would appreciate that not being something that's joked about anymore."

It wasn't even that which really pissed me off, it was when I realised that they had intentionally left that piece of information until the last possible minute, when he was being loaded into the car.   Honestly, I think it should be the thing that ""really pissed [you] off.""  You do not leave a baby in the car, whether you live in the Desert or the North Pole. Do you know how many babies die from that every year?  Whether from the heat or the car seat, babies die from being left alone, even briefly, in vehicles.   So, calling you negligent and leaving info to the last minute, while not nice, should be the least of your worries.    I'm officially letting him take the lead with them for a while, because my inclination is to punish them as well. Except that punishing them also means punishing us, cause the kids love them and they're our best source of babysitting.   It has nothing to do with punishment, it has to do with the safety of your children. If your kid dies in the back of MIL's car it's going to make everyone a lot more unhappy than any potential solution to this issue. I say this requires a good, straightforward talk with them and possibly not leaving the child with them until he's old enough to get out of the car by himself if necessary."

Although I'd probably be willing to deal with a cranky baby if I needed the time and someone else was looking after it for a bit.   Now I get what you're saying about being more annoyed about other things.   And at this point, my priority would be having a sit-down chat about how it's not funny to joke that you're a negligent mother. You clearly love your kids a lot and you're making decisions about what's best for them. Perhaps there's some way to put that in perspective for her, so she can understand how it makes you feel.   I don't have any advice on that front, at the moment, other than to talk to her seriously about it."

I don't know in what world she lives in that this would be a funny joke.  Personally, I wouldn't let them babysit tomorrow. I know that alobe time as a couple is priceless, but I wouldn't be able to reward that kind of behavior. Just tell them that you wouldn't want to NEGLECT your kids by getting them babysat too often."
JUSTNOMIL,37nx6h,l-x,7,Fri May 29 02:42:25 2015 UTC,"Husband has been reading this thread (we freely stalk each other's Reddit accounts) and he made the point that he is intentionally letting them have the kids tomorrow, while this is all still fresh, to give them the chance to improve while the drama is still fresh in their minds. If we wait a month or two and then try again, the whole thing will be forgotten (by them) and they'll just keep on with it. Calling them up and saying, ""We're not letting you have the kids because you've been jerks"" seems like an over-reaction, at this point. But he is fully prepared to pack the kids back into the car and nope them back home if they step out of line.   I just wasn't prepared for it. They've been pretty good grandparents up until now, and I've just trained myself to benignly let them have their quirks. This whole ""Hahaha, you're negligent"" crap has come out of nowhere, and I'm often busy dropping the kids off to stop and realise they're being jerks. But yes, I'm on the watch for it now.

I seem to feel best when I don't actually defend myself but just repeat some short phrase. ""The pediatrician told us to do this"" is good. Also ""she slept fine, thanks"" is a good one - those sleep questions SUPER stress me out. So I just say they slept fine no matter what happened."
JUSTNOMIL,37jvu0,undeadamerican,11,Thu May 28 15:10:11 2015 UTC,"Do you value her experience and knowledge? Is she sometimes helpful, despite being annoying most of the time?   I think you have two options. Either:    iron clad ""I'm the Mom"" boundaries. ""Is she too warm?"" ""No, she's fine."" I'm the Mom. etc. No wiggle room, and Grandma keeps her hands off while you're parenting Throw her a bone. Maybe speak to her about it and say, ""We're new parents and we need to learn by doing. We can't learn if you try and do everything for us. When we move, you won't be here all the time to do it for us."" Then maybe ask her for advice when you want it in baby-downtime. Maybe when the baby is asleep, or has gone out for a walk (edit: with someone!). Maybe if she has an opportunity to voice her advice (I'm sure she's bursting full of it and just wants to help) she won't feel the need to thrust it upon you while you're actively trying to parent. It would be a gentler boundary of ""Your opinions and feedback matter to us, but we're still the parents.""   One small grace is atleast she is the over cautious kind, and not the ""Well, I strapped my son to the roof rack of my car and he turned out just fine!"" kind."
JUSTNOMIL,37jvu0,KHeaney,3,Thu May 28 08:03:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I agree that she's fundamentally great and not remotely Danny DeVito. I was hoping to establish, ""She's kind of over the top which is making it hard for me as a new mom, but I'd never want to say something to hurt her or our relationship,"" in the OP.   The pediatrician thing is good, but without anticipating every question, there's like, a month delay between her bringing up an issue and me having it answered at an appointment without having the foresight to ask ahead of time, and since we live together, there will always be subjects I don't anticipate. I feel like even when I have a solid foundation for why I'm doing something, she's still really skeptical and shares that skepticism if it's not something that makes her comfortable and that's challenging.   And it's just hard to always feel like you need to justify your choices,even to someone who loves you. I don't feel like I get to say, ""That's just what we think is right,"" but instead have to always be ready to bring evidence in favor of our choices. I just want to go a day without being questioned on whether something I'm doing isn't somehow harmful to our baby, and since I can't change her behavior, I'll settle for tips on how to help make this shit roll off my back."

It's just a white lie kind of thing that makes it easier for you to defend your boundaries. I use it, too. it would be better if we could just say we've decided we're doing it this way, but that's hard to say and hard to hear, too.

MIL isn't irrelevant or unimportant, she's absolutely needed and wanted, but her constant advice is tweakin' you out, and it's making parenting, which is already not easy, harder than it needs to be.  criticism is always hard to hear, so i think it's important that you really try to couch it in what you know about her and her intentions. it's not a time for you to vent and get the last word in, but to stress to her that you need her to support you as a mom by giving you the confidence you need to parent. give her the tools to step back and let you take on that burden. and that's really what it is - she's so in the habit of being the only one who stresses, that she doesn't see it as stressing you out. she sees it as her supporting you and making sure you don't have to think as hard or worry as much, without realizing that you absolutely do. you can't not. you can't turn that off or decide you don't care. it's not an option.   all of that said, you know her and your relationship a whole lot better than i do. this might be a message that's better coming from your husband, or a better message might be something different entirely. i suggest a lunch between the two of you because i think, from the very limited info i have about her, that she would respect you for it, and appreciate you speaking to her directly.   i hope it all works out!"

JUSTNOMIL,37gvby,dregaron,9,Thu May 28 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"Oh God, don't get me started on the damn UTI. I had pre-eclampsia when I was pregnant, in the hospital for 7 days after delivery. After this, I think it was a UTI that I was symptomless/didn't see the symptoms.   I haven't had any pain, no burning when I pee, nothing. All I had was some odor when I peed. I went in for my yearly check up, and after a month of on/off odor I had them check my urine since I was in there. UTI. I had no idea. I have such a high pain tolerance, and things sneak up on me, so I didn't notice a damn thing. After I started the antibiotic, that's when the burning started and when I noticed the backache that I was attributing to carrying around 40lbs of kid was gone.   Oddly enough, the treatment has made me more uncomfortable than the actual infection, lol."

JUSTNOMIL,37ciua,OnyxKnight,7,Tue May 26 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"""You're huge"" were legit the first words to come out of her mouth when she saw me. I'm 22 weeks pregnant and definitely showing earlier this time, but damn, bitch!"
JUSTNOMIL,37d414,baby_purple,18,Tue May 26 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your MIL wants a shower involving her side of the family-which is extremely self-centered (especially if the mother-to-be is unaware of the location and arrangements). I would nope right out of a 16 hour car ride at 7 months pregnant personally. And I also agree with you that asking/telling this lady to use up her precious vacation time for such a venture is ludicrous.  If the people in Georgia really want to send a gift, then they will. End of story."
JUSTNOMIL,37d414,whatthecrump,12,Tue May 26 20:24:50 2015 UTC,"That's another thing- my FIL was a contractor/house builder so only ever worked for himself, and she was a housewife/real estate agent who sold his houses. So they have never worked for ""corporate America"" or for any company at all really, only themselves. They have NO CONCEPT of how precious vacation days and weekends are. Like, at ALL. When they lived in Georgia, she wouldn't understand why I'd want to leave at like 7am for the drive home, saying things like ""Well it's an 8 hour drive, so if you leave at 1 then you're home by 9, in bed by 10!""  Uh, no, I need to do laundry, make my lunch, iron work clothes, relax a little in my own home so I can go into the work week feeling mentally rested. My husband sometimes will take work home over the weekend because he has deadlines to meet for clients, and she'll say things like ""What kind of company makes you work on a Sunday??"" No, lady, the company didn't say ""You have to work on Sunday or you're fired!"" he just has deadlines he has to meet! They do not get it. She will likely say something like ""Your company wouldn't let you take time off even when your family is throwing you a baby shower??"" It's not that the company literally is saying ""NO YOU CAN'T GO TO YOUR BABY SHOWER"" it's that we have to pick and choose when we use our days off. It's like she thinks if we ask or explain our reasons for wanting time off, we'll just be given the time off. Ugh, I could go on and on about how much this annoys me, lol. Her latest thing is saying how all of us ""young people"" need to come together and demand four day work weeks, because it's not fair how hard we work. Which really means she wants all her kids to be able to spend three day weekends with her, lol."

She visited over memorial day, and left on Sunday to beat traffic and have an extra day at home. My MIL thinks we should spend every last possible second at their house, even if it means only getting a few hours of sleep. She even seriously once was trying to convince my BIL to stay for dinner once even though she hadn't started cooking, it was already close to 10pm, he lives 1.5 hours away, and he had work the next day. He said ""I don't want to get home at 2am and then go to work..."" and she scoffed and said ""Oh, like you've never gone to bed at 2am on a work night before??"" and he replied ""No.... no I have not, that is crazy."" She does get called out on it sometimes, and then just pulls ""Ohhhhh I'm just being a mom!""

JUSTNOMIL,37d414,suagrupp,8,Thu May 28 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"Hi! I think I have a very similar MIL to you - she's definitely not horrible, but also not someone I would chose to spend my time with given the option.  Also, I'm due on Monday, so I can definitely relate to pregnancy aspect of it!   I think Sally (and you) have every right to not want to travel out of state for a baby shower for MIL's family, especially that late in the pregnancy.  I traveled 16 hours round trip in my 7th month and it was HARD -- my hips were really sore and I had to pee a ton. I was also exhausted from all the traveling. I would not recommend it. I think you can use the traveling that late in pregnancy as a very legitimate reason to not have it happen then (or at all). Obviously Sally's opinion in this will be the most significant, as it would be a shower for her, but I think it's reasonable for her to say she doesn't feel comfortable traveling that far, that late, or doesn't feel comfortable receiving gifts/having a party about her from people she doesn't know well. Depending on how comfortable she is with MIL, she could also say she wants to celebrate with people who would put in the effort to be wherever the shower is -- not just 10 minutes from their own house.   So, my MIL wanted to throw me a baby shower in her home state (we don't live there, I'm not from there), for all of her family/friends in my 7th or 8th month of pregnancy. She threw me a similar bridal shower and it was not my taste at all - nice enough that she did it, but not something I needed to relive but ""baby-fied"". This isn't something you mentioned, but for all of the showers we had (our friends, both of our jobs), it was really important to me to have them be co-ed. In my opinion, it's just as important for my DH to be involved as it is for me -- she is both of ours! So, I was able to get around the MIL shower issue by stating I wanted DH there (it's his family, after all), and suggesting that we do a 'meet and greet' when our baby is around 3 months old. My MIL said she had never heard of a co-ed shower and had no idea how she'd convince men to drink punch in the basement of a church (why this is something women would want to do is still beyond me). I suggested a casual BBQ or something similar, not baby-centric, and hopefully that's what we'll have come September! Anyway, this way, I don't have to endure the over the top baby-ness that would ensue with her throwing me a baby shower, and she still gets to do something. Would it be possible to suggest that MIL could help with a Florida shower? Or if the Georgia family ""can't make it down"" in her pregnancy, maybe they could come down after the baby is born and MIL could host that?  Our situations are definitely different because MIL doesn't live in Georgia, so it's not like you'd be going to visit her anyway, but I still think neither of you should have to shlep up to GA just because your MIL has family there. If they care enough, they can come down.   Sorry, I feel like I rambled a lot, but hopefully something in here will help. Regardless, I support your feelings on not wanting to have there be a shower/have to attend. Your vacation time is also a good reason for you to be able to bow out gracefully! Does she have to know you have any time left, couldn't you say you used it all on the intl travel? Or, you could say you don't feel comfortable taking off work anytime right after being gone for so long. Good luck!"
JUSTNOMIL,37d414,Graendal,5,Tue May 26 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"If she goes forward with this, then I will definitely say that I'm out of vacation time and that it's just too much to travel again the very next weekend when I'd have to be back for work on Monday. I mentioned this in another comment above so I won't go on another mini-rant, lol, but MIL is kind of not understanding/sympathetic to how precious vacation days are.   I think the meet and greet is a good idea, if Sally wants a way out maybe I'll suggest that to her, that she and BIL can offer to go up to Georgia a few months after the baby is born. I've been with DH for 8 years, married for 2.5, and even I don't feel like I'd owe it to these people to go up to where they live because they don't feel like coming to Florida. I don't see why they need to be catered to like that. People have baby showers where they live, if you can't make it because you don't live in that state people will understand. Sally has only been dating BIL for 1.5 years, and I don't even know if she's met this whole side of the family, if she has it was once maybe twice? Like you are saying, I think the concept of a co-ed shower would be cahhhh-razy talk to this traditional southern family, lol. MIL was definitely talking about it like it'd be JUST me, Sally, and her, no men. So yet another reason I think Sally would be like ""WTF, I can't even bring my boyfriend to act as a buffer around all these people I don't even know??"" I'm secretly hoping she says no to it, because I don't want the expectation of me having to do the same thing when I'm pregnant, haha."
JUSTNOMIL,37d414,Graendal,2,Tue May 26 21:40:35 2015 UTC,"I'm due in a couple weeks, and my MIL is exactly the same and I just want to say... Do this version of a shower! Seriously. I did it and it was awesome. We had a nice coed shower with friends and family, crock pot sliders and Mac and cheese, a little bar, bag toss and poker and euchre and (for whoever wanted to) onesie decorating. It was awesome and everyone was glad there was no punch in basements of churches. It was legit fun. I'm not a ""omigod life revolves around baby and everyone has to love baby and baby is all that should matter everyone"" person, and this was a super nice compromise. We just asked everyone to bring a cloth diaper or book if they felt like gifting. One word of caution: tell MIL you don't need any help! (See my previous post on this sub...)"
JUSTNOMIL,37d414,HerVoiceEchoes,2,Wed May 27 13:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yep! I had a co-ed shower because, even though my husband couldn't make it, my dad and grandpas wanted to be there and like 75% of my close friends are dudes. (Some of the dude friends even brought their moms because I've known them so long that their moms were as excited as mine was!) I would not want to be trapped in a church rec room with only old ladies. Ugh."

She just kept saying how she was in shock, and it was such a surprise.  We were in our late twenties.  It can't have been that much of a shock.  She's just upset you guys didn't consult her or ask her permission first.  Mine then went around behind our backs telling other family that we had ""no idea what we were in for"" and ""they'll be in way over their heads.""  So, watch out for that.

He and I aren't married, and when we told her I was pregnant, less than a week later (the next time we saw her) she happily told us ""I talked to Father whateverhisnameis and he said he'd be happy to marry you guys!""  We were like, uh, no?   First off, we're not getting married JUST BECAUSE we're having a baby; babies are stressful and expensive enough without having to plan a wedding also (nevermind that I'd like to actually fit into a dress that isn't made for a baby bump and be able to have champagne at my wedding...).   Secondly, just because YOU'RE Catholic doesn't mean that we'll be married in a Catholic church. I'm an Anglican and my SO was pushed into his mom's extreme Catholicism which eventually made him lose his faith entirely. When we DO decide to get married, it certainly will NOT be in a Catholic church.   We also later found out from SO's dad (he and SO's mother are divorced, SO never really saw him because he moved to Florida and remarried) that SO's mum got pregnant before they were married also. Nice."

JUSTNOMIL,37bqe3,Aloena,8,Tue May 26 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"With my first pregnancy, MIL asked my husband ""was it planned"" too. I was fuming (it was planned, not that it was any of her business). Unfortunately I had a miscarriage a few days later. She told my husband how sorry she was when he dropped by their place, but not a word to me when she saw me.  Neither inlaws showed any excitement at all when I was pregnant with my son. I guess maybe they could have been cautious after what happened with the first pregnancy, but I dunno. The only times it was acknowledged was in the last few weeks, to tell me how huge I was (I'm pretty slim so the bump was overwhelming, but no need to tell me that) and to begrudgingly host my baby shower with SIL (for which I sorted out almost everything).  When my son was born, FIL barely acknowledged the kid for the first 6 months. I don't think he more than glanced at him the day after he was born. MIL more than made up for it, expecting shopping trips and lunch dates despite the major fucking surgery if just had.  Ugh, this turned into a rant, sorry! I think your MIL and mine might be related though. My way of dealing with it is to almost entirely ignore her."
JUSTNOMIL,37bqe3,faiora,6,Tue May 26 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry to hear about your miscarriage.  That is terrible that you had to go through that.  I do agree that our MILs sound related. It's crazy how some adults are basically children that can legally take care of themselves.  I do not plan on having any home visitors for a few weeks after birth so there won't be any shopping trips on my end. But similarly, she and her husband have yet to congratulate me directly.   I had a talk with my SO today and we agreed that all further questions will be answered with ""it's none of your business"". If that means that they think I'm a spawn of satan, then so be it. He also agrees to keep all negativity away from me. He is so amazing."
JUSTNOMIL,37d1he,EvaIsSherlocked,16,Tue May 26 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"I don't have too much advice to give. I just recently found out that Husband and I are expecting Baby #1. However, I will share some advice I have heard time and time again...Your baby, your rules. You may come off as being bitchy or whatever, but if you set limits now during the pregnancy, and you and SO enforce those rules, your MIL will hopefully realize that you mean business. She has to realize and accept that there are consequences to her actions.   Now on to your nephews....again, I don't have much advice to give, but I will share an observation with you. I have a friend that has 3 sons, and she just had a daughter. The boys, while adorable, were super rowdy. When they are interacting with their sister, though, they are so sweet and gentle. Your nephews my surprise you when your Daughter is born."
JUSTNOMIL,37d1he,LoonyLovegood934,8,Tue May 26 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen that too, my best friend has twin two years olds and while they play rough with each other and are like two little hurricanes, they're beyond sweet with my baby girl. They bring her toys, show her how they work, give her kisses and last time we saw them they were feeding her their apple sauce.  As an aside though, its ok to observe and file away info on the dynamic of your boyfriend's family, but I would advise against making constant criticisms of his nephews and their parents. You'll come off as judgy, and it won't be long before he asks you why you hate his family. If nephew's mother didn't stop MIL from giving him more sugar, that's her deal. Just make a personal note, mentally practice how you'll respond to boundary stomps if and when they happen with your own child, and watch her like a hawk until you can be absolutely certain that your rules will be respected."
JUSTNOMIL,37d1he,Bobalery,5,Tue May 26 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"Just saying that you are nervous about raising your kid to be a good person shows that you will make a great parent.

JUSTNOMIL,37d1he,catsarethenewblack,5,Tue May 26 20:01:35 2015 UTC,Sit down with your boyfriend before the baby is born and set ground rules for the grandparents. My mum and her partner were the problem for my first born (my in-laws are fantastic) as they were always too lenient with treats and her partner would always try and pick holes in our parenting (even though he is not the greatest parent himself).   We found it much easier dealing with them as we could be a united front against any problems and made sure that they knew we were the parents and that was the way we wanted to do things.

My grandma hated that she couldn't spoil us with presents like she did my cousins, but she didn't want to get us in trouble and knew that if she kept buying presents, my mom would stop bringing us over for unsupervised visits.  Let her know your expectations, make sure BF is on the same page and will stand by you, and then stand by your decisions and the consequences you've said will happen. She will learn to abide by your wishes or she wont see her granddaughter."
JUSTNOMIL,37d1he,XBlueYoshiX,2,Wed May 27 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"I might not have too much advice on your boyfriend's mom, but I would like to share something my uncle did with my younger cousins. About two years ago he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and started really living his motto, 'Live Your Life, Not Your Fears.'   He also became the Gratitudinator for his youngest nieces and nephews. When they received a present, they had to show their gratitude in a creative way; once, the two little girls received puppets, and were required to show their gratitude creatively. They decided to put on a musical show for the whole family, which was fun all around. It may not fit your dynamic, but perhaps when your little girl is old enough, you could teach her to be creative and use her toys in showing her gratitude to the giver, whether it be sculpting something in new play-doh for them or creating a song for them on a new instrument."

It's a three hour drive to grandma's, which I'd totally do if my dad ever remembered to invite me.    One time he called from the local theme park and asked if I wanted to come. Two hours before it closed, after they'd been there all day. It's a two hour drive from his house but a fifteen minute drive from mine! AHHH!!!    Put a spider in your MIL's dinner for me."

I enjoy those things... maybe you could invite me some time or we could make plans ourselves?"" Then he'll get a call from BIL at like, 3pm on a Saturday when he's already 2 hours away saying ""Hey, I'm surfing, you said you'd want to come sometime."" and DH is like ""Uhhh, well, yeah I would've loved to but now I'm already doing something and by the time I get there it'll be getting dark....""

JUSTNOMIL,37642z,l-x,3,Mon May 25 22:19:01 2015 UTC,boundaries is key   Yes! My story is extreme. I've seen good results with others when boundaries are not respected to not just draw the line but to withdraw until it improves.

JUSTNOMIL,37454j,Ilezreb,40,Sun May 24 21:17:57 2015 UTC,"You have to advocate for your baby. It sounds like your MIL means well but hasn't read up on what has changed in childrearing. It's not that long ago that children would travel in cars without car-seats but no-one would think of doing that today just because they happened to survive traveling like that as an infant.  I'm not sure why your SO was getting mad at you? Were you getting agitated with MIL? You say your SO knows about not giving them water or tummy sleeping, I'd have a talk with him and emphasize how important it is and that you both need to agree that your child=your rules, MIL does not get to decide what to feed the child or how she sleeps. You then need to have your SO explain carefully to her that things are different and just because her children were fine doesn't mean it's worth the risk. Like I mentioned earlier, just because you travel a 100 times without crashing doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a safe car-seat for your child if you do crash. :)"

I think that he wants to listen to his mom because she has experience with three children. But you're right in saying that research has changed since she had her kids twenty years ago. I will try explaining that to him, thank you for your help."
JUSTNOMIL,37454j,thisismeER,27,Sun May 24 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"I would even put him on the phone with your pediatrician and have them explain to him how important this is.

I understand lots of people over react to vary things they read online, but that doesn't mean there isn't any truth to it. And yes maybe it wasn't a big deal years ago and kids grew up fine, but you want to make choices with updated with new research that help minimize the risk of hurting your child.  Your MIL likely meant well and is clearly not updated with the times. It was how many years ago she last cared for a baby? I'm sure it's safe to say it's been at least 20 years for her? LOTS have changed since then in the medical field. And it'll keep changing. By the time we become grandparents, we'll be faced with similar issues. How our kids will raise their kids will be a little bit different than how we raised ours.  Your husband needs a good smacking to knock some sense into his head."

JUSTNOMIL,37454j,acinomismonica,3,Mon May 25 01:43:32 2015 UTC,"The local Mexican ladies will offer their babies water during the summer because they worry about dehydration because of the heat (they'd be better off drinking the water themselves and just nursing).  This might be as simple a fix as pointing out that you have air conditioning or it's too cold to be giving water.  That let's you stop that behavior without offending her or arguing about who knows best.  It's harder to reason with someone who's offended or thinks they know better than you.  That also eases the way for the second conversation about tummy sleeping.  The highest risk isn't until after 2 months and lasts until 4 months.  When you MIL was having babies they were telling moms that back sleeping meant their babies would vomit and choke and die, and if they didn't then they'd still have terrible gas.  After 3 kids, that's a hard thing to change.  I've caught my mom doing it a couple times.  It's almost funny, because we'll be talking when she sets my son down and she usually makes it halfway across the room before it clicks and she races back to flip him over.  I'll admit at this point I just watch to see how long it takes her to remember."
JUSTNOMIL,37454j,dregaron,14,Tue May 26 16:38:06 2015 UTC,She just came and told me that LO needs to sleep on her stomach to help with her gas. I explained that our pediatrician told us she is able to lie on her stomach when awake and supervised but she needs to sleep on her back. Hopefully she will respect that so I don't have to wake the baby as I flip her over.
JUSTNOMIL,37454j,mnh1,7,Sun May 24 19:42:51 2015 UTC,Maybe put this through google translate for her: https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sts/campaign/science/Pages/backsleeping.aspx  There is also evidence that it may be inner ear related.

It used to really upset me. I couldn't understand why someone would want to do that. I used to worry that other family would buy into her lies and also hate me for made up reasons. But as time went on, I realized if they were going to hate me without even seeing my side, they weren't worth the trouble. I have too many positive things in life going on that need my attention to spend energy worrying about pleasing someone who doesn't care about me.  As for MIL herself, I stopped being upset; in fact, my sadness turned into pity. She is clearly so insecure about her life that she has to make up all these lies to make herself look better. She wanted me to be upset because she needed me to be dragged down to make herself feel good, and I was not going to give her the satisfaction. It's tough, and sometimes if I'm having a bad day I waiver in my resolve. But in general, I'm not going to let MIL be happy by making me feel sad. She can say anything nasty about me she wants and I treat it like a fart in the wind.  Focus on the positive people - the people who love you for you, the real you, and not the poison MIL tries to spread. Again, if someone is going to turn on you without even considering your side, they aren't worth your being upset. MIL is not deserving of that level of power."

Then has the brass ones to tell everyone that I keep her from her grandchildren...conveniently leaving out the fact that it's a result of her own actions.    I used to be upset about it, but I figured that I'm never going to be able to make everyone happy-so I will make myself happy and just be the giant Bitch she says I am!  She's going to talk shit about me anyway, why not give her something to talk about?

JUSTNOMIL,371s67,Glittery_Pickle,4,Sun May 24 04:06:38 2015 UTC,"Then the sad truth is she probably knows. I think in this instance id rather her know than be that clueless. If she was clueless and making such terrible remarks, woah. That's some pretty epic narcissism."
JUSTNOMIL,371s67,-purple-is-a-fruit-,2,Sun May 24 04:12:21 2015 UTC,"clueless happens once, and the person is horrified to find out someone was upset or inconvenienced. Malicious happens repeatedly, and the person freaks out and becomes angry and makes excuses if anyone confronts her, even in a small way.,"
JUSTNOMIL,371s67,Yassssmaam,4,Mon May 25 03:42:16 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your personality and the level of the issues you have to deal with. In general, I never got over it. I do go through periods of time where I'll forget about all the crap that happens, once I see my inlaws than it all comes right back to me. The aggravation has been fully reset and reminded. ಠ_ಠ"
JUSTNOMIL,371xfd,LoneStarTwinkie,5,Sun May 24 02:34:07 2015 UTC,"Hopefully its getting warmer where you live and you can take her to a park or somewhere you can walk and enjoy the fresh air because that helps sometimes. When my grandma first starting developing Dementia she liked going to parks, doing puzzles, and going to Bingo. Maybe go try a new ice cream place, or get your nails done again. Since she still cooks, the two of you could spend the day baking and making anybody's favorite meal for dinner. Basically anything that still shows that she is capable of doing things for herself. I would avoid planning activities around the evening because that is when people with Dementia tend to get more confused and agitated, like you said with the sundowning (at least that's what happens with my grandma and it's much harder for her to do things when she is sundowning). I would also ask your husband and FIL about what your MIL used to do before the onset and try to do those things with her. This sounds really bad, but don't get worried over entertaining her too much because she will just enjoy spending time with someone else other than her husband. It's really great that you are trying to find things to do with her to give your FIL a break; you are doing a great thing!"
JUSTNOMIL,371xfd,fallen-inferno,3,Sun May 24 04:22:32 2015 UTC,Thank you! I totally forgot that this neighborhood has a park so close - we just moved last week. Wonderful suggestion. I work til 5 but she's usually ok until 6 or so.
JUSTNOMIL,371xfd,fallen-inferno,1 point,Sun May 24 04:33:19 2015 UTC,"Good! And you might also be better off now that the sun is setting later in the evening. It seems really strange, but with my grandma her sundowning is really whenever the sun sets. It's earlier in the winter and later in the summer. I hope you have a great visit with your inlaws!"
JUSTNOMIL,371xfd,acmspirited,3,Sun May 24 04:53:06 2015 UTC,"Check and see if there is a botanical garden near you, that's a great outing."

JUSTNOMIL,371xfd,l-x,3,Sun May 24 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"I used to bring my grandma to art galleries even when she was pretty far gone. She could look at the same 20 paintings for hours, and it gave me a it of a break too."
JUSTNOMIL,371xfd,mnh1,2,Sun May 24 17:25:05 2015 UTC,"Another great idea. Definitely had not thought of that, thanks!"

JUSTNOMIL,36w50b,allpregnantandshit,7,Fri May 22 22:56:39 2015 UTC,Her voice is the boiling point of my blood.
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,MyHusbandIsAPenguin,37,Fri May 22 14:14:22 2015 UTC,"I think next time she says anything about you changing your baby decisions to benefit her, you need to be polite but blunt. For instance: ""Look, it's pretty common knowledge that breastfeeding is best for the baby. I would really hope you want what's best for your niece/ nephew and not necessarily what's most convenient for the adults in her life. We're going to be making these decisions based on what she needs and what we want as parents. Not to mention we probably won't be having babysitters for a while... Also, the house can get pretty messy with a newborn and I know how you like things VERY tidy, so we'll probably be keeping visitors limited.""  ... After reading this it sound passive aggressive AF but that's how I roll I guess. Sometimes they just gotta hear it."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,allpregnantandshit,17,Fri May 22 14:47:34 2015 UTC,I might have to send her something like this on Facebook.  I'm not sure I could keep my shit together long enough to say it to her face!    I wouldn't mind but her own bedroom is a tip and she lives with mummy so she doesn't do a single chore.  She's 22 I might add and only a year younger than me but the difference in maturity is staggering...
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,noahsmommy12,15,Fri May 22 14:50:56 2015 UTC,"My mil does the same thing. How i handle it is basically this. I pay my bills, i pay for the things we have, you do not contribute constructively/financially therefore your input is rude and quite unwanted. This is my child, this is my home. You are merely a guest here. Thw decissions about both things are for me and my SO to decide. Not you. We appreciate your ""support"" but we are doing whats best for us and our child. What is convenient for you is of little concerm to us when it comes to our child. Our home is just that, our home. Not yours. If you ask to use something within our home, then feel free to keep your critcism to yourself. I do not come into your home and make rude, disrespectful comments about it, therefore you will not do it to us. I appologize if my outburst has offended you, but i will not have you blatantly disrespecting me in my own home and undermining the decisions me and my SO have made for the safety, comfort and health of our child. I hope that we can put this behind us and start off on a different foot. One with respect for others decisions and personal belongings."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,noahsmommy12,8,Fri May 22 15:36:06 2015 UTC,That is an excellent response. It sums everything up nicely and politely. If that's not being the bigger person whilst still standing up for myself I don't know what is!
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,beaglemama,4,Fri May 22 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"My mil is an awful person, but she is still my SO's mother. So while i will not let her walk all over me, im also not generally a confrontational person. But after years of dealing with the abuse, an explosion is bound to happen. Maybe this will help your sil to see that she needs to respect yours and her brothers decisions and your home."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Ilovegoku11,15,Fri May 22 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"t H always does his ""do it for me,   Why can't he do something for YOU and tell his sister off?"
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,MustacheBus,4,Fri May 22 16:48:40 2015 UTC,I'm working on that right now. It's a sore point at the moment but I've done it enough times to start putting my foot down...
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,MustacheBus,3,Fri May 22 16:55:02 2015 UTC,Show him this thread. Maybe that will show him how absolutely ridiculous his sister is being. He should be more concerned about the comfort of his wife and child then making his sister happy.
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,LadyOfSighs,8,Sat May 23 04:16:32 2015 UTC,"I would wait and see what happens. Maybe his family will just gloss over it and not freak out. Maybe she'll freak out, but she was very rude. Maybe your husband can talk to her and use specific examples where her lack of tact has hurt your feelings."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,LadyOfSighs,7,Fri May 22 14:47:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, in their eyes she can do no wrong.  Or when she does they pretend she didn't so if I maintain radio silence eventually it will be turned into why it's my problem...  Perhaps no one will ever mention it.  I still have to go to her wedding in September... would it be childish of me to refuse?"
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Rysona,5,Fri May 22 14:52:37 2015 UTC,You should definitely try to resolve it prior to her wedding. I would still start by having your husband discuss what she is saying and how it is an issue.
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Rysona,5,Fri May 22 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"I would have flipped my shit, then taken a cricket bat, dipped it into broken glass, and then very minutiously beaten the crap out of this sorry excuse of a female human being.   And then I would probably have borrowed one of these Marauder vehicles (like this one) and rolled over her, back and forth, until she blended beautifully with the tarmac.   And finally I would have rolled her up and given her back to her mother so that she remakes her.  As for your husband's ""do it for me, it's not the rest of the family's fault so why should they suffer,"" sorry but this is totally unacceptable. Why on earth should YOU have to suffer the antics of this apocalyptic twatwaffle so that your family-in-law, HER OWN FAMILY, wouldn't have to suffer?  Was it written in the marriage agreement that you would have to become your husband's family's official scapegoat when putting a ring on his finger? No? So they can keep their crap and deal with it.   If you don't step your foot down now, you will have to endure that nonsense for the rest of your life.   Make this your mantra/motto and repeat it, to yourself or to others, as much as necessary: MY house, MY child, MY rules."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,LadyOfSighs,8,Fri May 22 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"That was beautiful, you should write for a living. :P I'm taking twatwaffle for myself!   I've told him that it's rude and he couldn't see that it's rude if it's true... I mean I've been at work all week and I don't clean the bathroom until the weekend (we decide chores equally and this week is my bathroom week) so of course it's a bit dusty and there's toothpaste on the mirror but when you turn up unexpectedly at someone's house should you really expect it to be spotless?   He thinks it's not rude if the bathroom does actually need cleaning... He doesn't even LIKE his sister because she was unbearable during their childhood but still tries to avoid any scenario where she gets told. It's starting to grate on me."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,hopefulmachines,9,Fri May 22 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"It's starting to grate on me.   Which is now it is now vital for you to stand on your ground and step your foot down right now. If you don't do it right now, you will have to suffer all this nonsense from your SiL and her totally permissive family until you totally lose your rags.  Next time she tries to influence your decisions about your child, a nice ""this is my child and I, not you, will decide what's good for them"" should do the trick. [ ""Back off, bitch!"" works as well, but I've been told it might be a tad too colorful.]  As for her wedding, frankly, knowing me, I'd really demand a change of tone from her to even consider going. We are talking about a twatwaffle who has blatantly said that she wanted to know how fat you would then be so that she can be photographed next to you and look thinner. That is utterly pathetic.   If no effort are made by her or her family before the time of the wedding, let your husband go if he really wants to be such a bum-licking yellow-belly, stay at home, and enjoy a nice tub of Ben & Jerry's ice-cream while having a Netflix marathon. Or any other nice leisure time.  Then don't like that? They don't like that their official scapegoat refuses to take their crap?   Fuck 'em.  Your house, your kid, your rules."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,canderson05,4,Fri May 22 19:58:00 2015 UTC,Why can't she just lose weight if she wants to look thinner? I mean really.
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,LadyOfSighs,2,Fri May 22 23:07:24 2015 UTC,If she lost any more weight she'd probably die. She's a UK size 8.
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,WinstonBucksworth,6,Sat May 23 06:21:17 2015 UTC,"Well that would solve a lot of things, wouldn't it?"
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Little_birds_mommy,3,Sat May 23 10:25:51 2015 UTC,"It might be terribly uncharitable but I can't say I'd mourn the loss of her... Not sure many people would. Surprisingly, she has no friends!"
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,LadyOfSighs,2,Sat May 23 10:57:03 2015 UTC,"Which makes it a French size 36. Good grief, she's already a twig and she still wants to look thinner? Talk about a shallow person..."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Little_birds_mommy,2,Sat May 23 13:59:26 2015 UTC,"She is very vain. Her fiance is fat and not a looker, she somehow ends up with friends who couldn't change a lightbulb and she made a massive deal about being a vegetarian until it became too easy so swapped to being vegan.   I'm sure it's so they make her look better. Her brother (my H) is very clever and into body building and she's always had a complex about living in his shadow so it seems a bit of a coincidence that everyone in her life makes her look better.   I used to feel sorry for her that she is so hung up on what people think of her that it makes her unhappy. Now I hope she's miserable all the time..."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Little_birds_mommy,3,Sat May 23 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"If no effort are made by her or her family before the time of the wedding, let your husband go if he really wants to be such a bum-licking yellow-belly, stay at home, and enjoy a nice tub of Ben & Jerry's ice-cream while having a Netflix marathon. Or any other nice leisure time.   Seriously! Besides, OP, you'll be 36 weeks pregnant. It'd be completely understandable if you didn't go to a wedding at that point anyway - let alone for a shitty little fuckass you don't even like."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,LadyOfSighs,2,Fri May 22 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to get out of it before anyone has paid anything towards my going so they can't guilt me for it.  I've already on multiple occasions said (and childishly sulked :D) about how I don't want to go but I get the ""sometimes we have to do things we don't want"" or ""but I don't want to go without you,pleeease?""."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Citruslatifolia,4,Sat May 23 06:43:20 2015 UTC,"My answer to the latter would be the repitition of ""sometimes we have to do things we don't want,"" in a sickly sweet tone. And the fact that you're even considering it makes you a saint in my book. Blame the baby, get a pedicure and a mocktail with your girlfriends and let him deal with the family handful."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Cupcake_eater,3,Sat May 23 07:12:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm already finding it hard to walk and I'm only at 20 weeks. Perhaps a legitimate reason like ""sorry, I'm crippled"" might come up! If it weren't so early it would be just perfect retribution if the baby arrived on her wedding day... He'd have to come with me then. :P"
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,Cupcake_eater,4,Sat May 23 08:15:07 2015 UTC,"A more direct appoach might work, perhaps?  ""I am not going to that wedding.""  ""Sometimes we have to do things we don't want.""  ""You misunderstood me, it seems. Whether you like it or not, I am not going to that wedding. End of.""  You're not fussy or whimsical, you're about to give birth to a baby. It's about time your husband set his priorities straight. And his priority is you and the baby."
JUSTNOMIL,36vo2x,baby_purple,3,Sat May 23 13:53:41 2015 UTC,"Done that a few times. I said he could go if he wanted to but I was staying at home. It hasn't worked so far.  Unfortunately her behaviour as a teenager was so much worse that everyone lets everything she does now slide because ""she's not as bad as she used to be""...  Table-flipping anger is induced!"
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,MiaMae,36,Thu May 21 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"She's coming over this weekend for a belated Mother's Day..... I can only imagine how she's going to react when I tell her the date of my shower and simply say, ""Hope you can join us.""   No, don't invite her!"
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,beaglemama,23,Thu May 21 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"Seriously - ice her out of the baby shower. Do not invite her, and if she shows up anyway, do not acknowledge her presence. She has no reason to change if you all let her get away with this behavior over and over."
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,KatharticHymen,8,Thu May 21 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"I can't really complain. We stiffed her on Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, and Mother's Day this year. So when she asked to get together on Memorial Day- I figured I'd give in and throw some dogs on the grill and call it a day. Mostly, it'll be nice seeing my sibling-in-laws. If I give in on the really small stuff, it kind of gives me a pass on other things. A pick-your-battle kind of thing."
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,beaglemama,15,Thu May 21 17:57:38 2015 UTC,I meant don't invite her to the shower
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,HenrySellersBBC,8,Thu May 21 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"Oh hahaha .. Yeah .. if she acts up, let's say it won't be too hard for me to make the cut, if necessary.  I try to do the right thing though. As much as she's an awful troll; I'm pleasant with her for my husband's sake. And while he understand she's a nut, I know he feels badly about the whole situation. And because MY mother would never act up or allow my MIL to cause a scene; I think it'll be fine. But I'll put the kibosh on any drama before hand. I have no problem calling her out on that now :)"
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,ludecknight,8,Thu May 21 18:22:33 2015 UTC,"If you want to have someone around you who will issue death threats to families and babies at the drop of a hat via third parties, that's your call, but you have a baby coming who will rely on you to protect them from that shit. Don't let them down.   P. S. Way to show your sister in law you don't give two fucks about her. Anything for a quiet life, eh?"
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,ludecknight,3,Thu May 21 23:41:58 2015 UTC,"My husband and I have been extremely supportive of my SIL. We speak to her almost daily and offer them a shoulder, a place to stay, and constant love. And when this whole thing went down; of course we came to their aid and were on their side. We have a very nice relationship. I didn't mean for my story to come off as callous; here it's more of a comedic story, but it is a very sad situation that we all deal with, but we do it together.  And yes, keeping our child away from her drama is our #1 concern. The reason these stories are about my siblings and not about my husband and I is because he's very good at keeping his mother away from our nucleus family. He's protective over our privacy and home. If it wasn't for that, we'd be in a totally different boat!"
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,SGB_Mom,8,Fri May 22 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"I think they meant that your SIL, her husband and baby don't have anything to do with MIL, right? Inviting MIL to your shower isn't supportive of their decision to leave her out of their lives. So if you invite SIL, do not invite MIL and vice versa.   If it were me, don't bring it up around her ever. If she asks, just say you don't have a date set yet, then after it passes, tell her she missed it cuz she's a selfish bitch."
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,hotsy__totsy,1 point,Fri May 22 02:33:28 2015 UTC,"As of right now my SIL and her husband are speaking to her; but it's by no means a good relationship (never was). I think MIL has seen her grandson twice since the ""Carl"" incident. Because we're still about 4 months away from my shower so I'll call the audible once we get closer.   Now don't judge me on this one -- if my mother did that, I'd probably cut ties or have a serious heart to heart to discuss her behavior. But my husband's family is FAMOUS for brushing things under the rug and moving on without resolution until everyone quietly hates each other. I can't stand it, personally. I have no problem standing up for myself though; so if she had done something to us, I wouldn't stand for it and I'd take action. But because it's not my ""fight"", I'm letting SIL call the shots and we'll support it.  But believe me.. if MIL pulls BS like this again and my SIL isn't speaking to her at the time of my shower; I will not have MIL there. Our loyalty rests in my husband's siblings, not his troll of a mother."
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,allpregnantandshit,2,Fri May 22 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"No judgment here. I'm the same way. Last year, I decided to cut ties with my sister just for her constant disrespectful behavior and then acting like nothing happened. I can't stand people just brushing things under the rug. My in-laws do it for their oldest son. Makes me so frustrated.   Good on you for supporting your SIL against her mother. Not a lot of people would. Just like the rest of her family."
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,fruitjerky,5,Fri May 22 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"Why can't you just cut her out permanently? We cut off my MIL because she disrespected us, leeched off of us and continues to say that she ""should have called CPS) on me (eye roll. She didn't even have custody of my husband and BIL). Which isn't even half as bad in comparison...."
JUSTNOMIL,36rytq,AmberRabbit,1 point,Fri May 22 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"While I wouldn't mind- that's my husband's decision (to an extent). My husband is a very good judge of things. I know that when it's time to make that call, he'll make it. He's already stepped in and given us distance from her. We see her once every few months, for the most part (and she lives 5 minutes away). I just don't want to force that on him; not seeing his mother. Unless it really comes down to it and I feel my family is in jeopardy; I'm going to leave the final decision to him our of respect."

I was sending one to his grandma, so I knew that would cause a ruckus if I just sent one to her and not his mom without telling him. I asked him if he really wanted me to send her one, and he said he really did. He's not ready to tell her to fuck off permanently, like I am."
JUSTNOMIL,36m06j,baby_purple,10,Wed May 20 11:51:46 2015 UTC,"I hate it so much when anyone thinks I can ""make"" my husband do things. My FIL accused me once of having my husband ""whipped,"" but actually it was just that he agreed with me and wasn't going to automatically take their side on everything. I've even gotten this from female friends, ""Well why don't you make him...""  Um, because he's a fucking adult and I don't ""make"" him do things? I can ask or explain my side of the story, and he can choose to do the thing I'm asking or not. He is also incredibly stubborn, so I've even joked to him ""Oh my God I wish I could just make you do things, that would be amazing."" I'm stubborn too so, we joke about it. He doesn't ""make"" me do things either. ;)  But yes, it sounds to me like your MIL is trying to get on your good side to get back in with your husband. Maybe she's realized that pissing you off is only going to push her son farther away, too, so this is her manipulative way back in. I'd probably keep her at arms length and let husband deal with it (if he wants to, don't ""make"" him. ;D )"

From an outsider's pov, I'd say that she has major control issues. Someone else may have already posted it, but: r/raisedbynarcissists/ might be able to help you.

JUSTNOMIL,36i8w3,faiora,-5,Wed May 20 11:55:06 2015 UTC,"Well... she doesn't sound like a nice/likeable/worthwhile person. However:  Your SO is an adult. And his mother's choices now have nothing to do with either of you. It's nobody's business what her relationship is with his dad, or with her hippie in Vermont, or whether she sells any paintings or not, or even whether she helps your SO with school in any way. And seriously: expecting help from anyone that way (and especially from someone with known/past issues with alcoholism) is not only selfish, but kind of stupid.   I would never expect any of my family members to help pay for my education now that I'm an adult. Ever. Yes, the help would be nice and appreciated, but if my mom decided to pay for herself to go to college instead, or even just to go on a big fancy expensive four-year-long vacation, that's none of my business. Not even if she mooched the money off her husband. Their relationship is their concern, and I'm the worse person if I go sticking my nose in it.   By all means, ignore her advice and keep her out of your life as much as you have to. I'm not saying she's nice or worth spending any time around. Just that most of your rant is about things that aren't any of your business."

I'm glad that after explaining it, at least someone can see it too!! And like I said, I just can't bring it up to my husband...far too sensitive, and would defer the focus from where it should be, which is on his feelings, and how we're going to handle the situation. Oh, and he doesn't think of things that way, I've had to go through things with him before, because he'd not be able to put together the fact that she was messing with us!   Once I explained it, he'd see it...but I really don't want to have to this time!    I'm just so fucking tired if her, like she really couldn't be decent about THIS?!?

The last time I was willingly in the same room as her was three years ago, I was standing in the corner of my own kitchen, listening to her talk to my husband about me.   Was I visible? Yes! I was less than 10 feet away from her, staring daggers at her while she (as if I wasn't even fucking there) told my husband that I was a liar, and I should stop trying to cause trouble between he and his sister...he stopped speaking to his sister because she had by then given her first child away to her baby daddy, and wasn't taking care of her or seeing her.  The  sister had, a few weeks prior gone on to rant to me about how much of a jerk he (my husband) was, and that the world needs to stop revolving around him. How she wants to ""knock him down off his pedestal"" and the only reason mom does anything to help him is because she feels guilty for giving him away (MIL had just loaned him his tuition. And SIL was Pissed because she needed a new vehicle) oh, and out of the goodness of our hearts, we had let her and the new boyfriend stay in our basement rent free so they wouldn't be homeless, with a child (that she didn't even have but would use to garner sympathy)..all of which I obviously told my husband...so Mil decides to intervene, saying that SHE told me about feeling guilty in confidence...because she and I have all kinds of heart to heart confidential chats?!? .. so yeah, she basically stood there, not looking at me, or acknowledging my presence, and told my husband how big of a liar I am, and how I had betrayed her trust by telling him that...WHAT???   this woman is so fucking crazy!! At the end he told her she SHOULD feel guilty, and that all she's succeeded in doing was was making herself look like an idiot, he told her we (his actual family) would always come first, and he would always believe me, because she's done nothing but lie to him his whole life.. she left in tears, I fell even more in love with him that day..."

Why she decided to do it right then, and fuck both me and her friend over, is a mystery. Her sister purposely got laid off because they changed the hours for her position and she used that as a reason to exit the company. Because, ya know, you don't get unemployment if you quit.  Yes, the operations area is pretty poorly managed. Because of the ties so many people have to each other (friendship & familial), some people have a hard time being a strong manager. Case in point, the shift boss. My MIL should have been written up, sent home, etc. Instead the shift boss covered for her and put up with it because of their friendship... which seems to be a bit of a burned bridge now. The shift boss looks bad because of this, but she also should have stood up to my MIL about her behavior."

JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Throwmeawaycoco,71,Fri May 15 21:10:34 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't just with your MIL, it's also with your husband. The fact that he makes you go to church when you have different beliefs is disrespectful and absolutely ridiculous. He let his mother tell you that you couldn't have his child because you weren't ""saved"" and didn't come to your defense at all. He also allows his mother to berate you for your religious beliefs?  There are other things that show he doesn't respect you but these are the main things that stick out in my mind. You shouldn't have to be respectful when they clearly don't give a fuck about respecting you. I'm ready to punch something and I don't even know you."

JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Ilovegoku11,14,Sat May 16 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"I'm seriously so beside myself..   Next time she texts me it's going to take so much inside me not to say : Sorry this bitch isn't yoked. Wouldn't want you getting caught talking to this devil bitch by your holier than thou god. BYE FELICIA.   But instead, I'll likely just answer right away to avoid problems. IF we end up going through with the baby.. and at this point I'm just so incredibly hurt... I am going to do everything in my power to keep her away and be short with her. Blame it on the pregnancy and hormones.. it's not personal at that point right? I am seriously tearing up writing this.   My hubs previous 'wife'-if we can call her that- was a violent schizophrenic. She isn't in the picture because she abused her newborn (drugs during pregnancy and he was taken from her at 2wks old and surrendered to dad) to the point where he's five and still suffering from the consequences from his womb-donor... which I offer patience and love in return and take care of him as if he were mine. In fact, he'll see a picture of me when I was pregnant and he assumes it is him I am carrying. I am such a perfect wife to their son. I am just beside myself that after everything I do for their son and grandson- they would throw that out there. Just because someone believes in Jesus, doesn't mean they are any better than a non-believer. I've had enough Jesus and god shoved down my throat that I can feel myself drowning! I know for a fact-per their little bible book- that they should be ashamed of themselves and their behavior. Jesus wouldn't spew hate like this.. at least that's what I hear. Ugh I'm so beside myself. Maybe it's hormones.. but I'm shaking from it all."
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Ilovegoku11,11,Fri May 15 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"Lmao I like you. That is literally the perfect response when she tries to talk to you. But why do you want to be so nice to her when that witch can't even stop pushing her religion onto you? If you want I'll pour some water on her so she will melt. But seriously, just because he has an awful ex-wife doesn't give him the right to disrespect you. You are better than that nonsense."
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Ilovegoku11,4,Sat May 16 00:12:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for that! I'm glad I don't sound crazy to everyone here. UGH.. I wonder if water would work?? Worth a shot hahahaha.   And I mean you'd think his horrible ex wife and everything that happened with her would help his parents see how great I am. I mean that in the most humble way though. They always tell me I'm a ""blessing"" blah blah because of how I handle and work with their grandson.. and son haha. BUT- it's always bitter sweet two sided and backhanded compliments because things would just be better if when I died I went to the same heaven as them. It's just a bunch of ridiculousness. Moments like this make me so happy ""god"" granted us the ability to move 900 miles away from the crazy."
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,wrincewind,10,Sat May 16 00:33:34 2015 UTC,"YOU don't sound crazy your MIL does, and quite frankly your husband sounds like an ass. The religion thing is absolutely bonkers, I honestly can't believe you haven't let them have it yet. I can't stress enough that you both need marriage counseling. Maybe an outside perspective would make your hubs understand how despicable his actions are. I also would completely understand if you never wanted to talk to your MIL again."
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Puffsdangerfield,8,Sat May 16 00:36:44 2015 UTC,THANK YOU!! I'm going to press for counseling. I have let them have it before.. last November really... it was rough. Supposedly we came to an agreement of compromise but it's always a battle to keep it that way lately. I do have a signed piece of paper that he wont push his religion on me but it seems like there is a very very thin line between casual conversation and pushing and I mean technically it was just something his dad said to him versus said to me. So I mean maybe he shouldn't have told me? But regardless... I'm offended and hurt and he was just taken back by the whole thing. But didn't seen as offended... the way it came out at least.
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Puffsdangerfield,5,Sat May 16 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"a thought for you - or for DH. if heaven is a place of eternal happiness, and hell is a place of eternal torture, and saved souls go to heaven, and sinners go to hell, and he loves you... how can he be happy in heaven, knowing you'll be burning in eternal hellfire? Either heaven isn't a place of eternal happiness, or he'll somehow stop caring about you when he's up there, and i'm not sure which is worse."
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Ilovegoku11,2,Sun May 17 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"He at one point told me.. that's why he wants me to believe. He is leaving it alone for the most part... hoping that one day something clicks and I believe. I mean I'm 25 so by his logic... we've got time. And shoot.. maybe one day something will just change in me and I will believe. Who the hell knows... but at this point I am who I am and it's so hard when people keep shoving crap down my throat. It's not even just his family... I get it from all angles here where I live... and I keep my beliefs private. I'm a ""christian"" for all intensive purposes. If anyone found out.... my ""god"" all ""hell"" would break loose. I don't wear a cross... I don't talk like I'm a believer.. but people somehow think I am because I'm guessing I look like a christian or something. How effing rude is it to just bring up your religion on others and talk about it? It's got to be a small town thing... and we aren't like 5,000 small... we have a university here lol. But I digress... this post isn't about that. I guess I just feel suffocated from all angles so I'm a little sensitive on the subject... but his family has been doing this to me since I've met them. To be honest.. they ought to be ashamed of themselves and back the fuck off. Husband is trying to back off in a sense. Just asks for church on sundays and it's only an hour... lately he's been bringing up bible study.. .which I mean is okay.. you just study the book I'm assuming.. but fuck me sideways... this is the most boring crap of my life. It doesn't speak to me... I don't like it and it just confuses me because it's like magical nonsense that means nothing to me. I don't understand and have too many ""why""s to count. And here I go again on a rant lol."
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Puffsdangerfield,23,Sun May 17 03:40:44 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go with it's probably not a good idea to have another child if you two are in this much of a divide. Though I do think some counseling to work through these issues would be a good idea. The thing is, you brought up some major issues. Not small ones.   You are not being respected by MIL. In fact, she has started to wedge herself in between you and hubby. She, and your husband, may want to review the wedding vows and re-read the part about forsaking all others. Because he isn't taking your side like he should, and that's not healthy.   With the kids, that is just disturbing. Kids are smart. They know when one is being favored and it will cause problems. If she is willing to do that much when you are present, imagine what she does when she is not around.   Nothing in this world is free either. All that MIL gives is ""things with strings"" and the dynamic is not a healthy one.   Course, I gotta agree with /u/Ilovegoku11 here. He is more of the problem than she is. I would HIGHLY recommend you two going to a counselor and hashing this out. Sure, you may be great in all other areas, but these are kind of big issues here. They need to be addressed before they are the last straw on the camel's back."
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,Syrinx221,3,Fri May 15 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"You're right.. these are all some major issues. It's hard to bring things up to him because religion.. he feels like he's doing me a solid and his parents feel the same. I was raised Catholic and they think that's why I want nothing to do with it and feel like if only I could see how truly great god really is.. then I would understand and come to the bright side.. for a lack of better words. It's ridiculous and annoying. my hubs and i really do great in all other areas and we've come to a compromise on religion. I'll respect his ... but... he has to respect my views too in the sense that he doesnt go crazy with it. God stays at church on sundays.. that's it. He doesn't belong at our kitchen table etc..   And I agree... things with strings!! Which I hate.. supposedly because they are Christian.. things don't come with strings. I was born.. just not yesterday. My husband on the other hand may have been.   Supposedly the kids don't see it or notice it.. they used to and it was painfully obvious. She was given an ultimatum. She said it's not fair to her that she has to love those other kids and it's not fair to her grandson. I lost it. Told her to basically fake it till she makes it or I'm done trying for her. What kind of person does that to children. Added bonus.. her precious grandson wanted nothing to do with her and would lash out when she treated him like he was better than the rest. Once she showed equality.. he started acting human again and enjoying her company. Funny how that works...   How would he lash out you may wonder? Hitting her, throwing glass.. yes glass.. he loves to throw her collection of wine glasses, saying mean things, telling her hes happy shes gone, hopes she never comes back, that he doesnt like her... making her cry.. mean kid stuff. When we woudl skype.. he wouldnt sit and talk to her.. just go scream in a corner or throw things.. which isn't acceptable in my house but was okay in hers.. in fact, time for timeout? how about grandma reads you a story while youre in timeout. yep. sounds like a punishment. SHE DRIVES MY SIDEWAYS.   It's not just my MIL but my FIL too... unfortunately.. they both ride the crazy train. Equally victim to the god complex and seriously have a glow around them with how much faith they have and spit on everyone. My husband re-found his faith last November and we almost split because of it but we were able to work through it.   His solution/his family's solution: Just believe in god and everything in life will be perfect and amazing.   pft. i hate them sometimes."

That is the biggest load of bullshit I have read all day. And I'm subscribed to a few subs with a lot of bullshit in them. That's not how reality works. I don't care who you are.    just go scream in a corner or throw things.. which isn't acceptable in my house but was okay in hers.. in fact, time for timeout? how about grandma reads you a story while youre in timeout. yep. sounds like a punishment. SHE DRIVES MY SIDEWAYS.   How in the hell is any of that healthy or okay? And reading them a story? Dear god. Sounds more like she has herself a captive audience for her wants instead of instilling discipline for his needs. You might want to check out /r/raisedbynarcissists or /r/ACON_support.

She's still bad but I intervene and if she doesn't like it- she can deal with me and look like a lunatic telling me that I'm being unfair and awful for pulling her grandson out of the room who just decked her. Come on.   As for the religion thing. Yep. I've said it until I was blue in the face and keep it going. They press and press and living 900 miles away is a definite plus that's for sure. Ugh I talked to my hubs and he says I misunderstood. Bullfuckingshit. Clearly it's going to be a process and a huge thing we'll have to work through. You can say so many things about why a couple shouldn't have a child... But for the first to be because she doesn't believe what you do.. Religion wise? I mean I'm not having a baby with his dad!! But clearly his dad is concerned... ""He just wants you to believe"" #barffff"
JUSTNOMIL,363pe8,silver_eyed,6,Fri May 15 22:32:39 2015 UTC,You and your husband need counseling ASAP. He can't just dismiss your thoughts and feelings like that.

JUSTNOMIL,3639ir,imoutofthrowaways,29,Fri May 15 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"This happened with my wedding. My parents pulled the we are paying for everything so we choose everything card. I had to go into debt to get the dress and cake I wanted and those were the only 2 things I enjoyed. Nothing else was mine or my husbands tastes. We had horrible photos we never made copies of or shared with anyone, we didn't eat because we didn't like the food chosen, just an all around unhappy day. Our 10 year anniversary is this year and we both still hate our wedding day. It was a bitter start to a beautiful relationship. Bottom line, if she's not happy now, it will never go away. She should elope. I wish I had. Biggest regret of my life."
JUSTNOMIL,3639ir,Amiliz,4,Fri May 15 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"I was just unhappy because I think I was trying to make everyone happy and not mad at me. I also planned my wedding in 3 months, very rushed and not quite what I wanted. We only had $3000 to spend because we were also moving across the country a few days later. I managed to get our student union ballroom(which is gorgeous, and basically the only thing that I wanted) for $300 for the WHOLE day, then pretty much spent the rest of the money on food and cheap random stuff. I had to get a $100 dress at David's Bridal that was a POS because my mom refused to help with the one I really wanted. (It was $500, not a LOT considering, but I would have been SO happy.) Dad wanted to do dances and speeches, which I didn't want to do. I just wanted to have food/drink/dance. Dad managed to butt his way in to the DJ and next thing I knew, a speech was announced then followed with a daddy daughter dance that I was not a part of planning. (I am not close with my dad at all, so I was NOT amused.)   I wish we would have eloped for numerous reasons. Including the BS drama with MIL's asshole BF being a prick. Could have spared all of that."
JUSTNOMIL,3639ir,finallygoingtopost,18,Sat May 16 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how that much control could possibly be ceded to this lady that it would even be remotely appropriate. You want to put together a wedding? Have your own. You want to try to control mine? You're not going to be welcome, regardless of the money you would have helped with. If the bride can't have the wedding her way, I'd tell the mother in law thanks but no thanks for the money, we will find a way to have our wedding day the way we want. It's just not her day. Remember this is laying the groundwork for her future involvement in the marriage, put this old codger in her place now, rather than later and it will be a much better life.   She needs to get her groom on her side and he needs to be involved with the conversation, on his wife's side. Is he a mommas boy? He needs to stand up for his bride and emphasize that the day needs to be special for her, regardless of how much the mil wants it to be hers."
JUSTNOMIL,3639ir,finallygoingtopost,1 point,Fri May 15 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"I think he is a bit of a Momma's boy. FMIL also basically paid for FBIL's apartment and everything in college. Kind of has him in her pocket.  I'll refrain from my thoughts on him, but he at least has a nice job lined up after graduation...thank god. (Petroleum Engineers make a loooooot. Which, I think they need to wait a bit and save up then pay for their own wedding. Would save a LOT of trouble. I just wonder if FMIL would still butt her fat face in though.)"

She needs to put her foot down now, or this will be the case for their whole marriage."
JUSTNOMIL,3639ir,allpregnantandshit,3,Fri May 15 19:36:31 2015 UTC,"I've only met the woman once, and I can say that I like my MIL waaaaay better.    Yeah, I've told her she needs to say something. I think she's scared since FMIL is paying that she'll back out and they'll have nothing. (In which case, they need to save up and pay for it themselves. That's a whole other thing.)   Story time! Sister's FMIL loves turtles. Collects these things in a cabinet that she displays them in. Sister gave her this cute little one that our g'rents got her from Thailand. Was something special to her, but thought that FMIL would like it. FMIL acted like it was the stupidest thing she'd ever seen. A few months later, it's in the cabinet and Sister says something about it. FMIL says basically ""Yeah, Son got that for me, isn't it just the CUTEST thing?"""
JUSTNOMIL,3639ir,mnh1,8,Sat May 16 01:26:07 2015 UTC,"My husband and I chose to have a destination wedding, just the 2 of us. Not a true elopement because we told our family and friends what we were doing, but literally no one was invited. This, in part, was due to my MIL and her drama. She tried to have her own guest list which really bothered us and stressed us out.  She had this entitled attitude about the wedding and clearly wanted to make it about her. I'm so glad we did things our way. It was perfect. It created a lot of drama with MIL for a while afterward, but we showed her that she will not be controlling our lives. This woman has a problem with almost everything we do and tries to manipulate with guilt, temper tantrums, and threats. Dealing with her is pretty awful. Anyway, I recommend that your sister does not accept her MIL's money for the wedding. She should do things exactly the way she and her future husband want. It's their wedding and about their love for and commitment to each other.  If they want a wedding they can't afford, they should delay the wedding and start saving $."

Our brother has been telling her this as well, and she just gets more stressed out.   The food thing really bothers me.   It's like when my MIL told me it was stupid that I was pandering to the few people that had food allergies, or diabetic (type I) , etc. (Our baby sister is allergic to EVERYTHING. I'm talking from common stuff to random things, like lettuces. She has to carry an epipen at ALL times. In fact, I ended up bringing in her own dinner from a place that was okay because nothing the caterer had would work. I didn't want to have her going into anaphylactic shock, excuse me.)"

It sucks for people with legitimate allergies...it seems like they are being grouped with people who are going gluten-free because they think it's healthier or cool.    A month away makes things tough. If she goes through with giving in to MILs wishes and takes the money, she is at risk for MIL holding it over her head that she paid for the wedding forever and trying to exert control over their lives because of it. This kind of thing makes me very uncomfortable. Hopefully she won't accuse them of being ungrateful every time they do something she doesn't like..."

JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,peek0,15,Thu May 14 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"I know my MIL about as well as I did before I got married, which is to say, not much at all, but just enough to make me sigh and roll my eyes occasionally.   My MIL only speaks Spanish, and I don't speak Spanish, so we don't understand each other all that well. Most of our conversations are simply ""I love you!"" ""I love you too, Mami"" when I visit. The eye-rolling on my part is mostly about stuff my husband translates which she said on the phone. Unfortunately no good examples at the moment.   My mom is actually the most irritating and difficult of either of our parents."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,faiora,13,Thu May 14 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"I have a soon to be MIL. She basically hates me but refuses to own up to it. Blames me for why SO and her aren't best friends, even though they have been having problems for longer than I have been around! I don't really care what she thinks of me, because I have a wonderful Mom.   As for how it will change after the wedding, I can see SO and I not having much of a relationship with them anymore. They are borderline verbally abusive to SO and myself, so why should we deal with that anymore? She literally acts like a 14 year old who is ruled by her emotions and zero logic. Gah. Just thinking about her makes my blood boil. Like she ruined SO's college graduation by throwing a hissy fit the morning of and then leaving in a huff after the ceremony. shudder  All I know is A LOT of changes will have to be made by her if she wants anything to do with SO or myself. Especially if she wants anything to do with the future children. Good god. I wouldn't even leave them alone with her."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,Honeyforthewin,6,Thu May 14 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"I share a lot of your feelings here! My SO and his sister had a falling out a little over a year ago, and his mom sort of injected herself right into the whole thing and he stopped speaking with her as well. It then gets flipped around as if he is the only one who's had a problem the whole time. I'm really bad at dealing with gaslighting, I just don't know what to do or say when it happens."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,Honeyforthewin,6,Thu May 14 22:37:27 2015 UTC,"Oh that's just fucked up. I will never understand why some people feel the need to be in the middle of everything. Like for fucks sake, let's let these people talk it out like adults rather than picking sides like children.   Idk the MIL is just so self centered and so self serving. I just don't understand how a mother could do such rotten things to their child. I don't get it. Does not compute."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,Honeyforthewin,7,Thu May 14 22:47:29 2015 UTC,"This is where I struggle, because she would say she's a fantastic mother and that if we're offended by something she does, then it's our problem because her intentions are always great. But we can't prove her intentions are shitty. It's just... sdfoashdflsjflksjdf."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,victoriaweaver29,3,Thu May 14 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"Aw shit. I think I'd start taking detailed notes, like ""on August 25th, you were an asshole because djishoxjsbhalne"". That way you can call back on shit she did.   Mines just one of those ""self proclaimed bitches"". and it's like okay, I get it, sometimes everyone can be a bit of a bitch. But don't be an over exaggerated bitch 24-7 just because you freaking can. There's a difference between the two. And yours is gonna wind you up on your ass, all alone."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,Honeyforthewin,3,Thu May 14 23:58:24 2015 UTC,"I can definitely relate to having a teenager for a MIL! About a year ago, my now BIL was having trouble with his medication (he is schizophrenic and bipolar, brought on by fetal alcohol syndrome from his birth mother, not MIL), and was having violent episodes. When DH and I sat down with her to talk about what she was planning to do, what was going to happen, etc., she sat on the couch, playing with her phone, texting people! I mean, we were 20 year olds trying to have an important conversation with a woman in her 50s, and all she would do is sit there on her phone and say, ""I don't know."" in the same kind of teenager-y tone her teenaged twin daughters do! Since then, things have only gotten worse, and I'm pretty sure we're going VLC after we move out her property."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,victoriaweaver29,3,Fri May 15 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"Oh goodness I think I would have lost my shit if she kept texting. It's like come on, face the scary adult stuff and lets talk about it. Sheesh.   My MIL just can never figure out what she wants from us. In some way, we are always fucking up and usually it's because she thinks I'm this grand puppet master. I promise you, my arms aren't that long. Me and SO just talk a lot and value each other's decisions. Maybe it's just easier for her to blame me for everything."

You took her baby, so now everything is your fault. /s   When my now husband called her to tell her we were engaged, she asked why he did that. Like wtf? The wedding was a whole other mess when it came to her (though thankfully she didn't wear white, lol). Also...   usually it's because she thinks I'm this grand puppet master. I promise you, my arms aren't that long.   ...that is a hilarious mental image, and I may use that idea in the future. Perfect."

JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,undeadamerican,18,Thu May 14 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"I knew mine was emotionally manipulative and extremely clingy of ""her baby"" (ie my husband) before we got married, but she was manageable. It was during the wedding planning she started to show herself - trying to control it, insulting my relationship with my father as being ""less important"" since he and I aren't blood-related, and ultimately wearing white to the ceremony and pouting a lot. I figured it was the wedding.   Then we had a kid. That's gone about as well as you could expect. Meaning we're pretty much no contact at this point. She just kept ignoring boundaries and requests, contradicting me in front of the kid, and spreading all kinds of (totally made up by her) nastiness about me to the rest of the family. She would put my son in danger just to go against ""mean old mommy's"" rules."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,Yassssmaam,6,Thu May 14 23:34:04 2015 UTC,"I totally get why you're worried about this, but the only thing that really matters is that you and your fiancee are committed to being on the same page with each other, no matter what the MILs say or do. Yes, it may be difficult, being related to them, and yes, having kids may make them even worse. It's good that you realize this now. The question you need to ask yourself before you marry is if he is going to be willing to make things work, to be committed to YOU, not to their craziness."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,veggiesaur,6,Fri May 15 02:28:39 2015 UTC,"I knew. I have a theory that you can always predict the next thing a person is going to do by the last thing they did. She wasn't warm. She made some nasty comments. I could see she wasn't going to be a positive for me.   I gave her a chance because my husband asked me. I'm glad I did that. Now it gives me a buffer. I can say ""you asked me to include her, and she complained the whole time. You asked me to depend on her, and she flaked. You asked me to be patient, and I am. So let's be realistic.""  our relationship did not improve, per se. I got better at dealing with her. It can actually be a lot if fun to sort of treat her like Jim treated Dwight in The Office. Kind of ""I know you're crazy. I know you can't help doing this. I find it funny...""  But then I got pregnant and now that I'm tired and sick and I just can't have her around.   So i guess I have no real advice. It helps to find the funny side. It won't always help enough. Whatever you do, don't expect her to change. You'll just drive yourself mad trying to find the right way to talk to her. But it will never make a difference..."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,anothermuggle,6,Fri May 15 08:45:31 2015 UTC,"I knew how she was, but as it turns out I did not actually understand the extent of it all. She unleashed a whole new bunch of crazy after we got married, and went completely off the deep end when we had our son. We also live four hours away from her, although my husband has some naive (yet sort of noble, if you're into that sort of thing) sense of responsibility to keep up a relationship with her... so she is constantly involved in our lives in some way. But she is quickly going the way of her mother; bitter, deluded, and the queen of pushing people's buttons in the exact right ways to either get her way or make herself appear to be ""above"" them. When we were dating and engaged, she was just sort of this snooty, entitled drama queen... I always knew I wasn't good enough for her, basically. But she really kicked it into high gear after we got married."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,anothermuggle,8,Fri May 15 13:01:11 2015 UTC,"I knew my mil was difficult. She doesn't have the warmest disposition and doesn't exude warm fuzzies. But I had no idea just how difficult, mean and crazy she would/could be. Her craziness really came out after we got married, and it has continued to worsen over time. We were able to move to a different state this year which has helped tremendously. and at this time she is digging her own grave with her antics/actions."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,LRGinCharge,3,Thu May 14 22:40:24 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm worried about, I think. They're both absolutely crazy now, I almost can't imagine them getting any worse... We live 4 hours from them currently, so there is a good buffer there and we always have good excuses to not have to be around them."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,anothermuggle,2,Thu May 14 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"you're lucky...that will be your saving grace. We lived 30 min away and my mil expected us every sunday for dinner, wanted me to call 2-3x week. she was relentless. There were some sundays I couldn't make it and she threw temper tantrums etc. my parents live in another state and bc of my husband's job holidays were always spent with his side of the family. fun story...last thanksgiving we spent 10 hrs w his side of the family and the next day i get a VM from her and she is yelling at me. telling me what a horrible disrespectful person I am, asking if my mom taught me any manners...all because i didnt CALL her the morning of thanksgiving to wish her a ""happy thanksgiving"""
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,LRGinCharge,2,Fri May 15 01:42:56 2015 UTC,"WHAT??? So you spent the entire day at her house, she acted like everything was fine, and then the next morning left you that message?? That is so freaking weird."

It actually came to a point a little bit after my husband (then BF) and I had just moved in together where i had enough and it was basically, ""you tell your mother to back the fuck off, or I'm out"". I think that was a good turning point in my husbands and I's relationship, we both got on the same page and can handle it much better together."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,whatthecrump,3,Fri May 15 14:03:37 2015 UTC,I knew my fiance had a difficult relationship with his parents before we got married and honestly the bugged me to but I really realized what I was in for when she cornered me after we moved our wedding up because of pregnancy and told 4 months pregnant me that our (my husband and mine) relationship would never work because we had nothing in common and that I was corrupting her sweet son because Jesus wasn't a big enough part of my life. Her son is an atheist.
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,fruitjerky,3,Fri May 15 06:22:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not married to my SO yet (soon hopefully :) ) but we've been together 7 1/2 years, lived together for almost 6 and have 2 children together. I feel like she is my MIL, just like my SO is my partner in life.  I think some families might go crazier after weddings but I think with mine it's just about spending long enough around her. It took me a while to surmise fully that she's crazy and narcissistic, but while I have many years in front of me of her being horrible, I don't see her disposition changing after our wedding. It will however probably give me plenty more horror stories because I know she'll find a way to make the day about her like she did with my sons first birthday and every Christmas since I've met her."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,allpregnantandshit,2,Fri May 15 09:08:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, there was a falling out that involved her and SILs. But my DH is just too wonderful a person to miss out on b/c of them.  So we cope by mostly being low to no contact."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,honeydee,2,Thu May 14 23:21:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did. She didn't change at all after the wedding or after the kids. But as long as her Xanax prescription doesn't run out we're good."
JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,imoutofthrowaways,2,Fri May 15 09:14:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize quite how babying she was of him, or how over the top jealous she was when he showed me affection. I did realize she was generally annoying AF.  I think the most important thing is you guys remaining a united front. She has to realize marriage is the death of I and Me and the birth of Us and We, so if she wants something or whatever the fuck, she needs to go through both of you and you both need to agree. When she realizes she can't slither in between you, it'll make her manipulation a lot harder."

She's been horrible since the very beginning. The first time we met, she accused me of selling my now husband drugs and tried to attack me. That day ended with her telling his whole family that I called her a bitch and was screaming at her even though I never said two words.  Our whole ""relationship"" has been her harassing me. Threatening phone calls, passing my numbers around to the family every time I changed it so they could all call and harass me, her trying to attack me, kicking her son out for dating me, being horribly abusive towards him, etc.  My husband cut her off sometime this past fall. He stopped caring about her a while ago, but he has a little sister that he loves dearly and we tried to stay civil so we could protect her.    I'm actually pregnant with our first child and all of a sudden MIL wants to love me. My husband told her she will never see this kid and she'll have to die knowing its her own fault for being horrible to his other half(me)."

JUSTNOMIL,35zro1,PoniesRBitchin,1 point,Fri May 15 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"DH and I dated in high school, and I knew MIL right off the bat. She was really nice, at first. After 2 years she started realizing that we were serious. Started being more cranky/rude towards me. I think it was more when DH decided to stay in town for college. (I had nothing to do with that decision. I was going to switch schools if need be.) Started more or less acting like I was a monkey on his back and that the man can't make his own decisions. She reacted in the same way to BIL and his wife. The womens control her babies. Obviously. Drives me insane because she's 50% nice and thoughtful, then does the rude/down taking/condescending shit she does.   Since getting married, she's more critical of choices I apparenty make. She'll ask me a question about what I want for where we end up after DH finishes his PhD. When I say something, she'll respond with something like ""Well, it's more about what's best for his career. Not about where YOU want to go."" I respond with places that are what options HE has! Not like I'm pulling them out of my ass. Then she'll turn around and say she's had nightmares about us deciding to stay in Australia. Who's it about now? Hmm?   She's been pretty good with kids being thrown in. Once they've been born. She threw a slight fit with DD #1, since we were both in school. She gave BIL's crap with their DD#2 because BIL moves around A LOT because of his new Army position (is a major, and he's taken this post in the Middle East and they'll be moving every 9 months for 10 years...or something insane. It keeps changing, but that was the most ridiculous plan they told him at first.)   Drives me crazy. When she's nice, she's helpful and she IS very giving (which makes me feel terrible) but I cannot stand her most of the time."

I have been raised in the south and while I don't consider myself a ""southern girl"", I just can't bring myself to be rude to her, even when she gets dramatic and ridiculed. She is deserves respect in lots of ways. And she is sometimes very kind. But she is also so so so crazy.

Thankfully my parents where all ok you'll apply the same rules I do to my child. The only difference was they'd let certain things slide and spoiled her, as most grandparents would. Anything major, they'd let me handle it. All was good.   Now my inlaws.... Sigh.... They'd do everything different than me. It's worse now that my daughter is almost 12. This angers me and I need to get it off my chest. She took school online for a whole year and just finished a month early with straight A's (we moved out of the country and online schooling made things so much easier for all of us, not to mention she cannot speak the language enough to do well in public school). Anyways, before she finished, she was working on her assignments, my FIL walked over and said directly to her, ""You NEED to get off the computer. You SHOULDN'T be on it all day. You need to go to a regular school with other kids."" He went right passed my husband and I to tell my daughter what to do.... I almost had a nervous breakdown. Not to mention, it wasn't her choice to take school online. It was mine and my husband's decision. She actually wanted to go to middle school and be with kids her age. After that, the over tempered FIL got into a fight with my husband before understanding why we made our decision. I HATE that man. I really do. My husband had to explain why. He wasn't happy with it. Well eff off!!! She's NOT your child, never will be, excuse me that you hate my American ways of doing things and you have ZERO RIGHTS to parent my kid. Just eff off you old grumpy man."

My son will ask for a snack like an apple or cracker while I'm finishing up dinner and I'll say no because we are going to eat. Next thing I know my son is walking by with at least two crackers in his hand; this is in my house or hers.  Then when I or my husband say no or correct him she does the ""saving"" routine like yours.  I also love the ""Oh sorry sweetie, your mom said I can't give you that."" Yep I’m cool being the bad guy. What I've found is the confrontation of don't parent my child or contradict me in front of him doesn't really work with her.  She acknowledges you said it and promptly forgets like a teenager.  What I've found to work is treating her just like my two year old.  If I see her sneaking a candy or snack before dinner with him, I talk to her just like I talk to him, ""No, no Nana.  You can't have it either.""  She then does the side step like a toddler and I threaten her with a time out.  She gets pretty butt hurt about it but it curbs the day right quick.  It also helps that my husband and FIL would back me up if she complained.  It also helps reinforce the rules to my son; he is not getting it and asking Nana behind my back will get them both in trouble. I love that I found this sub.

You have done absolutely nothing wrong, she is just a psycho, and she pretty much admitted it with that statement.

My husband got so much chastisement for dating me, a white girl! So he dumped me according to his moms wishes and got with am Ecuadorian girl instead, which seems better than a white girl to me but his poor mom nearly had a heart attack. White girls are apparently a better choice to bring home to mom, she begged him to go back to me which thankfully he did. Thankfully because I love the bastard, not because I'm the preferred race. Its silly, she loves the ex as a person but could not stand the idea of him marrying her or even dating her because of old ideas in their culture. I'm fine with it since they opened up to me after that and my kids are going to date whoever they want, within reason."

But her disability does not mean she gets seconds before you get served your first helping.  You should not have to eat cold food because she can't wait, or can't fathom the idea of someone else preparing her plate.  And a 2 year old and a 5 year old should be served first, or else the meal will be miserable for everyone!"

I think this is what bothers me the most. I mean, I have 2 kids, a cold meal is not new for me. lol   If she'd just let me finish the kids', I'd be done and help her. It literally takes less than 5 minutes to make their plates, especially on nights where I've made something like steak or chicken because I just toss sides on their plates and my husband is in charge of cutting up meat. Then, the kids are sitting at the table, they're not arguing, they're not being obnoxious because they're hungry. Every single dinner I've ever been to/hosted parents go first to make kids plates, then the adults go through.  Last night, I didn't even announce that dinner was ready, I just started the kids' plates and I thought I'd get around this shit by saying dinner was ready as I was putting the kids' on the table. I have an open kitchen, and she saw me grab the plates."
JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,l-x,17,Wed May 13 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"New rule: no one goes in the kitchen except you and the hubs. Everyone's plate comes out at the same time, and everyone gets to wait patiently at the table. Hubs can help get drinks going or carry plates out."

No more you being the bad guy. Yes she needs help, but she is not the only person who needs help, nor the highest priority for help either! It also might not hurt to have your husband just tell her that either he helps her so you can help your kids and eat, or she doesn't eat because she can't do it on her own. Lay out her options to her like you do a child. You can do this or this and that is it!"
JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,WombatBeans,22,Wed May 13 16:01:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, last night, as soon as the kids were in bed I said, ""The next time your parents are over for dinner, it would be nice if I could eat before dishing up 2 other plates AND seconds for your mother before I even get to sit down.""

JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,fruitjerky,18,Wed May 13 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"See, this is what I'm really wondering. More of an ""I'm the elder grandmother, I come first."" She's always done this, usually I'm at the table trying to dish up, and she just shoves her plate in front of me and tells me what to put on it. Then, she'll start telling me what to put on FIL's plate. Luckily, my husband is usually right next to me so he'll help manage her while I continue what I'm doing.   She's also started ""correcting"" my kids more, and it's not for stuff that has to be corrected. For example, last night my 2 year old, who just learned the word no and hasn't figured out what it means yet, was saying ""no"" over and over. Now, this kid will say no to ""do you want a cookie?"" Then get mad if you accept no as his answer. Anyway, he's in his high chair, happy as a clam saying ""no"" while eating. She gets after him and tells him ""you do NOT tell mommy no. It is NOT NICE."" Or likes to tell me when I should have given a swat, then in the same breath tell me that I should just let the kids do whatever they want as long as they're not hurting someone.   OH, and here's one I still haven't gotten over. When my now 5 year old had his 2nd birthday party, he didn't want to hand paint. Not a big deal. I was ok with it, he doesn't like to get messy, and the birthday place has PLENTY to do, he doesn't have to paint. But, it was about 30 minutes past his normal naptime, and he was a bit fussy about it. Not a tantrum, not a scene, but just a bit whiny and crawled in my lap. She got into his face and yelled ""HEY!"" My mother was right behind me, and if she hadn't been there, I may have made a scene. She got between us and told her that she didn't appreciate her grandson being yelled at during his birthday party. I pulled my son away and took him for a diaper change because I was so pissed, I knew I'd have a scene if I opened my mouth.   She's one of those ""old school"" church ladies. The ones who like to sit in the front pew, and be ""Godly"" but talk shit about everyone. The shit she says about how my brother and sister inlaws parent their kids... I don't tell her anything I don't want everyone else to know."
JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,agentfantabulous,8,Wed May 13 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"It certainly sounds like she oversteps her boundaries; the good news being that you do have family to help buffer her behavior. And good for your mom for saying something to her on his birthday. How ridiculous. He was 2 for goodness sake!  Unless you think it would cause some sort of altercation; I might just start saying, ""No."" and sticking to my guns on it. My MIL is a horrible human being and a worse mother. Once I started not fearing ""No,"" I felt more liberated and much less like a chump who just went along and gave her the upper hand. Just a thought!"
JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,dregaron,6,Wed May 13 16:47:00 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need them to come over far less often
JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,MrsMagnum,6,Thu May 14 05:21:25 2015 UTC,"I keep reminding myself that they are old, and we do this so that my kids will know their grandparents. In all reality, due to their age and health, I have serious doubts on whether they're going to be around long enough for the 2 year old to really remember them."
JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,WombatBeans,19,Thu May 14 14:49:40 2015 UTC,"No.   Learn to just tell her no.   ""I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait until I've served the kids.""  ""I'm sorry, but you'll have to get your son to help you this time.""  And if she shoves her plate in the way, just set it aside. If she rants about it, just ignore her.   If she's not willing to wait, and not willing to let your husband help her, then she's clearly not being reasonable. This is not remotely related to her disability and there is no reason to accommodate her inconsiderate requests."
JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,LoneStarTwinkie,17,Wed May 13 18:24:37 2015 UTC,OMG STAHP. Tell your husband that if he doesn't take her plate out of her hand and take care of this hag he's going to be doing weekly dinner on his own! I can't even deal with this!!

JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,Yassssmaam,9,Wed May 13 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"See I would take the plate from her then move it where she can't reach and tell her she can wait for the small children to get food. It sounds horrible and bitchy but that is how she is acting to you. Completely disrespectful to both you and your children and no one else is going to get it through her head. This seems so wrong to me, but I'm one of those who makes sure the kids have food before a single person can start plating their own. And demanding to be first and get seconds before the person helping even gets a chance to eat? How about fuck no. Nope, she would have had a cuss free but harsh no thrown at her and a demand to act like a damn adult. I understand you may not want to do that, it is bitchy, but you need to be respected by her."
JUSTNOMIL,35ttik,Yassssmaam,10,Wed May 13 20:22:50 2015 UTC,"O_o  I couldn't deal with this. Seriously I would have yelled at her by now guilt trip be damned.   ""YOU need to wait your turn, the kids get served first, if you can't wait 5 minutes like a big girl have your son or husband help you, I'M busy."" And seriously her sticking her plate in your face demanding seconds? FUCK THAT SHIT, I would tell her ""You need to wait until everyone has had their first plate, before you can have seconds.""

Next time she shoves her plate OVER your child's plate, take it from her and toss it in the sink. Tell her to wait her fucking turn or go to a restaurant. Maybe I'm a bit harsh, but there's no way in hell I'd let my own mother, or my MIL, do that to my wife without laying down the law. Your husband needs to grow a pair and put his mom in line. Disabled or not, have some damned manners.  I thought my bi-polar bitch of a MIL took the cake, but after reading all the stories here I'm thinking maybe she's just in the top 80% of shitty MIL's.  *Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not saying your Husband is spineless, but it's his mother, he should handle it. That's from a husband who has a recently reformed uber-shitty mom. Mostly because I flat out told her to stay away until she got her shit together and stopped playing games.

JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,fruitjerky,4,Wed May 13 03:37:51 2015 UTC,"Some of her more selfish moments are epic. When I was going to college, she'd spent all summer telling me that they'd match funds on a computer for me. I had $900, and an $1800 laptop would be super nice. Day comes around, we go to the store. I pick out something that's $1200. $300 for her to chip in. She balks at the idea, says she doesn't want to put $300 on her card after I say you can split the purchase cash/card. I give up and ended up with this crappy one for about $700. We walk to Staples to see if they have Microsoft office for any cheaper. While there, mom spots an $1100 laptop and buys it for herself as I'm checking out with my stuff. I was pretty pissed. Don't say you'll chip in, freak out when you are faced with it, tell me that you can't even, then litterally turn around and buy yourself something that's nearly 4x the amount you spazzes about. She HAD a brand new Mac at home too. No need for this laptop.   She did similar a couple years later when previously mentioned shitty laptop failed on me. I asked if they'd help out, was told no by her...was not surprised but thought I'd ask. Mom finds out I got a clearance Macbook for $700 (they were getting the new gen in and had tooooo many old ones, was fantastic!) and about a month later, I pop by and mom has the same laptop I just bought.   She also claimed me on taxes 2 years after I moved. Since she filed first, the IRS basically told me tough shit and that I owed some $500 to them. I was not a dependent, they only paid for my health Insurance, and I was paying for everything else. I still don't know why I didn't fight it, should have, but I was 21 and dumb. I remember her saying that they needed that $1000 tax credit more than I needed the $500. Didn't need to pay my rent or tuition or anything like that. Nope. Not my fault she does dumb shit with her money (the laptops, or buying shoes/purses/makeup she NEVER WEARS.)"

JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,wrincewind,12,Wed May 13 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, he stays out of it. It's incredibly obnoxious.   We had a relative who got hit by a car (it was a bad accident) and my mom searched for the local new's FB page, found the story about it and then posted it to his wife's wall. (Along with all the nasty comments people were making assuming he was drunk and how he deserved to die. He wasn't drunk, it was dark and the car that hit him didn't have their lights on.)  I had to call her and tell her to take that down ASAP, otherwise I'd hack into her account and do it myself. Still didn't take it down."
JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,vanillavodka,29,Wed May 13 03:16:32 2015 UTC,"Good grief. I'm calling it now. Your Mum doesn't have a ""touch of Aspergers"". She's a full blown asshole."
JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,vitaminDdeficiency,9,Wed May 13 03:21:54 2015 UTC,"I question it. At times it seems deliberate, other times she seriously is clueless to what she's doing.   She asked me on a status once around the time DD was born if I was progressing at all (dilated or effaced) and my friend who's aware of mom, was like ""I don't think that's something that needs to discussed on FB. More for a phone call or something, ya think?"" Mom then deletes her comment and likes friend's comment."
JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,l-x,7,Wed May 13 03:32:07 2015 UTC,"Okay. I have higher functioning autism, a lot of my friends have aspergers, and all but one of them knows that shit like this isn't remotely okay. She sounds like a narcissistic ass."
JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,l-x,6,Wed May 13 10:38:54 2015 UTC,"She does other things that point to it, has no self awareness (like she rarely showers), she gets uncomfortable with clothes that are itchy (which... Idk if that's a thing), she had a lot of odd hand flailing/flapping when she talks (and it's generally about super specific things, like Amtrak schedules) and she has issues controlling her voice volume (gets all high pitched at times or she laughs at this stopping everyone in the room volume that people are like wtf) she approaches people even though it's super awkward and she has 0 clue that she's awkward. (Recent example was she went to someone's funeral that she barely knew the girl's mother, and dragged my sister along to. Sister said mom just talked the mom's ear off at the recieving line about work (and this woman is a freelancer for mom's company). Sister had to drag her out.   Then again, she'll do things that are totally normal as well, but yeah. I dunno. This is why I say touch."

JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,Glittery_Pickle,3,Fri May 15 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"My GOD! You've basically just described my mother! Although my mother actually does love the babies, and tries to be helpful sometimes....but it's the times when I say;""oh, poor baby N is really sick with a terrible flu"". or ""I can't talk mum, I'm really sick/tired/busy etc."" and her response is; ""oh, I was SOOOOOO sick last week, I mean you couldn't be any sicker than I was, I was almost going to go to the hospital, but I couldn't walk to the car, so I stayed home alone with no one to look after me, I even though about calling an ambulance)"". Or ""you think you're tired? I'm way more exhausted than you've ever been in your entire life, you don't know what tired is, I was a single mother, remember?   I didn't have your father helping me, I had to do it ALL by myself...you have your husband's help every day!"" (never mind that I basically was raised by my dad/grandparents!).   And after this one-up conversation with me, she goes on to post on Facebook ""oh, my poor granddaughter is very sick"" or my daughter is just exhausted, and has the flu, she really should take some time for herself, being a working mommy can be very exhausting, I wish I lived closer so I could help out by talking the kids for a weekend!"". (really? What the hell? You just minutes ago on the phone told me to suck it up, it could be worse, I could be a single mom like she was!)  I do think she genuinely does love her grandchildren and me, but she's such a narcissistic weirdo that she doesn't know how not to be jealous or feel empathy and the need to one-up every negative thing that happens because she thinks it'll get her some extra sympathy...I held off telling her about my MS diagnosis for six months because I knew the moment I told her, she'd tell everyone in our extended family, and want loads of sympathy because her poor sick daughter had been diagnosed with a terrible  disease...she failed to tell them that I'm fine and am in remission."
JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,rbnthrowaway13,1 point,Sun May 17 17:55:21 2015 UTC,"Good on your friend and your mom for being to the point and taking care of the situation graciously. It sounds like you need someone to run interference with her in a kind but to the point way. Like, in the situation where she sat down with your hubs, he needs to gently say, no, wife is going to sit here - you can sit over there.  I can understand why she might gloss over these messages from you (that's not to say you're wrong or anything). Mom and daughter communication is tough, and she may not register that you are telling her as an adult what's appropriate rather that being a petulant daughter who just rags on her mom.  edit: to be clear, i'm not saying OP is ""a petulant daughter who just rags on her mom,"" i'm saying that some clueless moms just take it that way by virtue of the fact that it's their daughter talking."
JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,rbnthrowaway13,2,Fri May 15 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"Well, even when I'm using kid gloves, it glosses over. I don't continuously rag on her at all, hell, I hardly get a word in when I try to talk to her about anything.   With the comment she deleted, I honestly don't think she got the point, asides from needing to delete it because someone gave her crap. Liking friends comment was a little ironic, if that makes sense.   Husband did say something to her when she sat down like that, and she just glazed over and continued eating and watching the movie that was on.   When we brought DD home, I had been up all night with her. I brought her out in the morning, and went into the kitchen to get something to drink. Mom was 2 ft behind me, and eventually trapped me in the corner to the point where I couldn't move. I asked if she could move back a bit, politely, and she said ""okay"" then got even closer. I had to shove past her. Then I went to put DD in the swing hoping that'd make her sleep. It worked and I started to pass out only to be woken up by my mom talking at me about who knows. Took me asking her nicely to let me nap, my husband, AND my dad all telling her to let me sleep. Dad eventually had to take her out of the apartment to run errands. All 3 of us weren't rude, she just doesn't GET it."

I would understand it if someone was clueless but could pick up social cues when bluntly told (and appreciated them), but damn. I don't even know what that is.  And to be clear, I wasn't saying that you DID rag on her, just that I know some moms (cough...) can take it that way, no matter how polite or reasonable. It's the source, not the message, y'know?"

JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,kaelta,3,Wed May 13 01:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think she does. I mean, she doesn't clue into social cues at all. She'll talk at people forever and not get that people are like stfu. (You can't launch into the middle of a thought, talking about people at your work...dropping names and what not...to someone who has 0 clue. I don't even know anyone and she does this to me all the time. My sister says she'll put the phone down and walk away for 30 minutes, and she'll still be yapping away about whatever and not even know sister wasn't there.)   She also tends to mock people without realizing it pisses people off. (My aunts/grandma/cousins used to go shopping the day after Christmas for sales and mom would come along. Dad's sister would buy something, and when we'd meet up for lunch, my mom would notice what aunt had bought then would go to the same place and buy the same thing. Aunt would be so irritated, but never said anything. (She'd only be around my mom for the last 30 years...so haha.)"

JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,Yassssmaam,1 point,Wed May 13 09:47:22 2015 UTC,"Her sisters say she's always been like that (aunt said when they were in high school, they were at a friends house and a girl had passed out and my mom just kept talking away, completely oblivious to the fact that the girl was ASLEEP.)  We went through some drama about 15 years ago, where my aunts called my mom out on her BS (knowing she's got SOMETHING going on) and threatened to take us kids away from her. Mom cried about it like she didn't understand that she needed to take us to the dentist/doctor/clothe us (pretty sure my g'ma bought all of our clothes that were remotely wearable.) My dad works all over the place and was rarely home, so that was part of why he wasn't involved much. Aunts told her she needed to get evaluated and she never did.   Among other things, the aunts stopped asking her to chip in on Xmas presents for g'ma because mom wouldn't chip in (would give excuse, then buy something for herself). Gma raised 5 kids on her own and put them through college. Mom kinda glosses over it like that was expected and never seemed very appreciative. Aunts feel like g'ma deserves a lot. They also don't like how my mom thanks g'ma for things. (She does it because she gets yelled at if she doesn't, so it's this ""blah came in! Just letting you know!"".) pisses my aunts off.   To this day, she acts like she no idea why aunts aren't speaking to her.   My sister has called her out a few times, and again, the glossing over. I've asked, and she starts talking about flipping trains again or work."
JUSTNOMIL,35rtqk,Yassssmaam,1 point,Wed May 13 12:23:53 2015 UTC,"Again, WOW.  Again, so many hugs.  Things will never be typical with her, but I'm sure you've already come to that realization long ago.   I have a step-Aunt who is 65 and intellectually disabled. Her diagnosis is classic MR, but throughout the years it seems more and more to be simply lowish IQ AND classic autism.   When I asked my stepdad why nothing had ever been done to treat/alleviate her symptoms that COULD be addressed, he responded that at this late in life, what's the point?   What's the point in upsetting her with more testing, new doctors, and therapies? What's the point in getting her a more accurate diagnosis at age 65?   At first it pissed me off...she is WORTH having her life possibly improved. The family just knows that it will be hard on everyone involved.   I say this because it's hard to want to help someone change and know that things never will for them. Things will always be status quo. I'm sorry that you have to live in that status quo.   I chose to have no communication with my own mom recently (1.5 years ago at the age of 33) after years of bullshit treatment, neglect, and abuse. I tell you that it is MUCH easier for me to simply avoid a relationship with her than to constantly deal with the fallout and consequences of having said relationship.   I'm feel for you. More hugs."

JUSTNOMIL,35ogvs,l-x,18,Tue May 12 08:07:25 2015 UTC,"I can go along with his theory that people are crazy and no one wins when you try to change someone. We are still working out details. He gets upset if I'm upset about it. I get upset when he pressures me to stop her criticism (for example it's easier for him to ask me not to work so much than it is to just tell her I'm only working because I'm avoiding her).   And she's treats everyone like she treats me. I'm not getting it worse because I married her precious son. I'm just there for more of what she dishes out on a regular basis because he isn't going to disown her.   There are two kinds of people in her life: the people who take what she dishes out and the people who she won't talk to. There's no coping strategy that's going to get her to do anything but be as crazy as she's been her whole life. I've met her father, and he's worse.   Also my husband learned some nice things from having a crazy mom. He's very tolerant of others. He's nurturing and forgiving. He can roll with weirdness. He's great with kids. He respects boundaries (because he knows how it feels when they're overstepped).   In a lot of ways, my crazy MIL is a gift to me. i am working on making it more fun to deal with her in general -I'd rather humor crazy than fight with it. And I really hate her after this weekend. But overall having a husband who can put up with crazy because he loves the person isn't the worst thing that's happened to me, if that makes sense?"

JUSTNOMIL,35ogvs,whiskeywishes,7,Tue May 12 08:31:34 2015 UTC,"I had a boss who was similar and deal with the public a lot. I pretty much do the same thing. Find the funny side and make a joke of their most pressing concerns. I actually am annoying for this type to be around too, because they want a specific reaction and they can't quite understand what's going on.   For example, she gave me two consecutive self help books as gifts. (One about learning to appreciate literature - I have a grad degree and she doesn't- and one about listening to the wisdom of old people). So I offered to buy her a self help book that I liked (Brene Brown) because I ""know she likes that genre. Because you keep giving them to me...."" She not only stopped giving me self help books, she ""punished"" me by withholding suggestions about things I could improve for six months. She's phasing the suggestions back in now, but still quite a bit more respectfully than before.   It isn't perfect and I do take too much bs from people. But I also get an amazing husband out of it. And she's old and widely disliked. She's not going to kill me (I don't think anyway). She's just going to be a constant source of eye rolls..."
JUSTNOMIL,35ogvs,baby_purple,6,Tue May 12 16:16:40 2015 UTC,"as long as your strategy works and you and your husband aren't disagreeing over it, it doesn't really matter what it is. you aren't on trial here, the peeps in this sub just like to make sure that everyone knows that this behavior is crazy, it's not ok, and there are strategies for dealing with it effectively (rather than just dealing with it).   i think that's all that /u/HenrySellersBBC was trying to get across - it's important not to just put up with this shit, because eventually you will blow. if you're able to deflect and vent and move on, more power to you!"

JUSTNOMIL,35ogvs,allpregnantandshit,2,Tue May 12 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. My mom can be crazy and hard for me emotionally. Luckily she respects my husband, but she just doesn't respect me so much on things.   It isn't like what you're dealing with, but I get where you're coming from. Life isn't black and white and some things are worth putting up with and gritting your teeth about. At the end of the day if she isn't going to change she is not going to change. If it doesn't affect your marriage negatively in a way y'all can't deal with etc. Then some battles are just not worth fighting.   Occasionally I have to step away from my mom for awhile.

And then he told her bye and hung up. We are trying a method of trying to communicate with her and the minute she turns nasty we hang up.

JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,thejills,10,Mon May 11 22:33:59 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, it totally was. He also got me a bag of dirt to plant them in. Haha. He said that he thought I would appreciate these more than regular flowers. I love gardening (And also, the smell of dying flowers makes me sick right now)... so it was perfect."
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,MustacheBus,3,Mon May 11 23:19:54 2015 UTC,You do know hooha is one of my favorite words right? You. I like you.
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,adaki02,5,Tue May 12 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"It's probably in my best interest to tag you as ""hooha girl"" now.   I'm glad I could be of service."
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,allpregnantandshit,6,Tue May 12 02:31:56 2015 UTC,"What the hell?! I would be livid. More so if I was your husband. Your sweet, thoughtful husband. I would tear my mom a new one and then I would tell her to take a hike. I'm seriously seething for you! What a bitch!"
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,Little_birds_mommy,6,Mon May 11 15:21:17 2015 UTC,Nope. Cut her out now.
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,SundaesAreHappiness,5,Mon May 11 15:00:19 2015 UTC,This made me FURIOUS. Who in the ever loving fuck does she think she is?!
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,Truth_hungry,3,Mon May 11 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"Sincerely, why do people have to go out if their way to be mean? What did that really get your mother in law but the joy of upsetting a pregnant woman... One carrying her grandchild.  Cut off ties with this woman. She is toxic."
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,ScuttleBucket,4,Mon May 11 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"I'm 33 weeks pregnant with my first. My mom told me Happy Mothers Day back when I called her yesterday. My MIL said, ""next year, we'll both be moms!"" My MIL is actually quite great so I don't think she meant it how it sounded but it still peeved me a bit. Your MIL took it way above and beyond the next level...good grief!  And those flowers are beautiful...you deserve them :)"
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,friendlymellon,4,Mon May 11 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, fuck. her.  It's one thing to privately disagree - but to berate you for what you choose to post on your social media is way over the line.  Not to mention that you were also bragging on your husband (her son!) for being wonderful & the intention behind the flowers was to celebrate you as a mother.  Looks like MIL is already having issues sharing the spotlight."
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,ScuttleBucket,5,Mon May 11 21:14:30 2015 UTC,Ugh. Sounds like my MIL.  She texted me happy unmothers day when i was pregnant the first time.

JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,Notsocreativeeither,2,Wed May 13 19:54:39 2015 UTC,That really isn't the worst thing she's ever said or done. It's kind of midline really.

JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,WombatBeans,5,Fri May 15 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Wow by that logic, she shouldn't celebrate either! After all her children are adults, so she has no real babies!! /s"
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,BlueberryFaerie,3,Tue May 12 01:29:16 2015 UTC,OMG.... did your husband put her in her place? I hope so! What a horrid bitch.
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,CruxSacraSitMihiLux,3,Mon May 11 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"What a gigantic C U Next Tuesday.

Just because your baby is still on the inside doesn't mean it's not a baby!"
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,Syrinx221,2,Mon May 11 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"I know I'm just some stranger, but I think you are a mom. If taking care of a growing child within you isn't mom material, well...that sounds absurd, no? I hope you had an otherwise happy mother's day :)"
JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,blueharpy,2,Mon May 11 21:03:40 2015 UTC,"What a bitch! I'm glad your husband did something super sweet for you, you are growing a baby and that absolutely does count. I know everyone doesn't agree, but man, there is NO reason to be rude. Someone has a stick shoved up her ass.   My father in law still tells the story of how he didn't get my MIL a card when she was pregnant with their first (29 years later, she still won't let him live it down). aways made it clear to his boys that it definitely does count. My husband got me a card, a mug, and an amazon gift card. My inlaws were super sweet and sent me an e giftcard as well. And we went to lunch. It was awesome and sweet and made me feel so special. I'll be sure to make sure my husband feels the same next month!"

JUSTNOMIL,35lngo,themadchild,2,Tue May 12 00:23:00 2015 UTC,I read my husband this story and he was irate.  He wanted to know what the husband did to stand up for you.  What a complete and utter bitch.

Although I have seen some people/family members who are pro-abortion and do not like to consider pregnant women mothers yet because that would mean its a baby in there not just a fetus. I read a few stories where family members were telling her ""you should just get and abortion, thats what I did, you can just have one later!"" They do not realize that to you, it IS a baby.  She sounds like a bitter old meanie ;)"
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,MiaMae,17,Mon May 11 17:04:01 2015 UTC,Wow.  That is insane.  I'm sorry you have a MIL that is such a raging psycho.  Who stalks their son out with this his in-laws?  I feel even worse for your husband; if my mother did that I would be so embarrassed.
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,Jug_Band,13,Mon May 11 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"My MIL does this.  Constantly asks to be included since ""we're all family now!"" Funny how when it's their turn to visit, they never want to invite my family.  They just do it to take away from quality time with other people, not because they actually want to spend time with us."
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,ProfessorMMcGonagall,12,Mon May 11 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what has happened in our family. Every time my family has a get-together, my MIL comes out of the woodwork with how we're all family and should be together. But when she throws something; my mother and/or parents are the only ones excluded. It's so hypocritical. And now, she gets invited nowhere."
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,Syrinx221,3,Mon May 11 18:44:04 2015 UTC,Wait - they let her in while you were having an exam without checking to see if it was okay with you??!?
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,Syrinx221,7,Mon May 11 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"OMG, the nerve!!! What is wrong with people?"

I got DH to swear to me today we weren't calling her until after the baby is born, because I know for a fact she'd show up and try to get into the room, and knowing she was there would make my cervix tighten up, guaranteed."
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,Trexy,4,Mon May 11 22:08:35 2015 UTC,Sphincter rule ... It's a real thing.
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,allpregnantandshit,3,Mon May 11 22:52:32 2015 UTC,Sure is!! I try to explain it to everyone: How easy is it to poop when someone who makes you SUUUUPER up tight is standing outside the door? Let alone when they're in the room?
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,l-x,5,Mon May 11 22:31:37 2015 UTC,"i mean, it could be a coincidence, but jesus christ. you know it isn't. what kind of tiny world does she live in that she has to be that petty and paranoid and self-involved? it's a rhetorical question. reading all of these horror stories answered it for me a long time ago.   at least you had a nice day with your mom!"
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,poptartaddict,6,Mon May 11 23:06:14 2015 UTC,Exactly! Like it COULD be just a random occurrence .. but it's just not.  She will go extremely far out of her way to make someone upset. And apparently now her radius has expanded to an hour's drive.
JUSTNOMIL,35m3z0,kaelta,2,Mon May 11 23:19:14 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how this ended. Was she just like, ""Ok, restaurants booked let's go back home...AN HOUR AWAY."" Or did you guys just leave her there to figure it out. Lol She is so weird!"

Changed the way my mother treats me DRASTICALLY when I made that point.  The horror, I imagine, of being a grand parent (let alone great grand parent) is that you know your days are numbered, and it must be difficult not to act like your current state is eternal.    Being clued in to the fact that it isn't might be a harsh wakeup call, but it might be the harsh wakeup call that she needs."
JUSTNOMIL,35jpss,beeasaurusrex,5,Mon May 11 02:02:00 2015 UTC,This is good advice. Something has to give!

JUSTNOMIL,35jpss,fruitjerky,4,Mon May 11 10:30:14 2015 UTC,It was really hard this time. I did give her a super disgusted look the second time when she spit on my arm and she put her hand over her mouth but didn't apologize. Just plowed right through.

Does your guy still not recognize her patterns well enough to not be a participant in making you feel shitty?  In not recognizing the behavior and actively going along with dinner, he is doing NOTHING to alleviate her dastardly deeds towards you.   Have you ever played in to her shirty behavior to highlight to everyone else what a shit she is to you?   Like, just show up and announce that you must have missed the formal invitation, but you are so glad that you could make it.   I be the crickets would chirp for a while after something like that."

JUSTNOMIL,35fqil,Zeckos,4,Sun May 10 03:27:50 2015 UTC,I gave mine away for free for that reason. I was moving and couldn't justify the expense of moving it.

JUSTNOMIL,35fqil,Amy_MUA,3,Sun May 10 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"No, sadly I want it. The price will probably be my DH helping her move. She is downsizing and moving. Not far enough away. But I know her tricks.  Once we get there she will expect him to help her move. She puts the nice gesture out first and then expect follow up.  My DH knows how it works and will tell her he can't help. Once it is done she won't hold it over us. And it is selfish of me but it is the first time she has given us anything of value. When we moved into our house my parents help us paint, gave us some furniture and a few other odds and ins. His dad gave us money several times to buy things for the house and help with renovation cost. His mom has never done anything with the kindness of her heart."

C'mon meow."
JUSTNOMIL,35fqil,allpregnantandshit,13,Sun May 10 12:55:19 2015 UTC,I think it's because she's not navigating so much as cutting her off until she wants something (piano) and then playing along until she gets it.
JUSTNOMIL,35fqil,Bobalery,10,Sun May 10 15:03:42 2015 UTC,And falsely assuming that taking the piano wont eventually bite her in the butt.
JUSTNOMIL,35fqil,Luthien_Tinuviel-,6,Sun May 10 22:16:12 2015 UTC,"I guess, but it's kind of a rule on this sub not to give advice unless it's asked for and she was responding to advice given unprovoked.

A lot of them were free, you just have to pay to get it moved which you will probably have to do anyway with your MIL's. Might be worth a look, the cost of professional movers could be worth not having to ""pay"" for her piano forever."

JUSTNOMIL,35fqil,l-x,8,Sat May 9 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Story time:  My DH and his mom have never gotten along. His parents divorced when he was a teen. Almost 15 years before we even met. He moved away and eventually cross country. When he moved back, a couple of years before we met, she said he could live with her until he got back on his feet. So he moves back cross country anticipating a place to stay. He shows up at her house, the door is locked and is empty. When he calls her, she was ""oh, yeah I moved out, you can't stay with me."" WTF who does that?! Luckily his dad still lived locally and let him stay there. He didn't talk to her for a while after that. We met a couple years after that incident and I tried to make things work with her. I figured that she was his mom and should have a good relationships with his mother. Nope. He has other amazing mother figures in his life that are great and we love.   One of my many encounter with her was our years of Christmas debacles. After we had been dating a couple years we agreed to go to her house on Christmas eve. She went to church, so we had ""dinner"" after. The first time was normal.  We ate, visited and handed out present.  My SIL insisted on watch a Christmas Story as we are trying to visit.  Blah. Next year we agree to go over again.  They show up to their house super late. 10pm late, over an hour and a half past when they said they would be home. Then there was no food. MIL said not to worry about bringing anything they had it covered.  Bullshit. SIL stopped by Burger King to get food. I don't eat fast food. And not Burger King.  We chit-chat and are ready to go.  Oo no we need to watch Christmas Story.  And then open presents.  I was agitated.  We finally get out of there after explaining we had to be up early the next morning. Fine. nothing to crazy. The next year I decided to host. We had dinner before they went to church. I had to work later that night. They showed up late. Completely disrespect me and my parents who came. My MIL was rude. My SIL was almost 2 hours late because she had to color her hair. WTF. I think we hosted Christmas Eve dinner one more time.  Then gave up.  At some point we had to attend a wedding out of state for DH family. His mom and sister show up with no reservations for a hotel. They had months to plan. They   insulted the host. They discussed how rude and shitty the locals were and how much better everything is back ""home"". At the reception MIL sat down with me and was ""let's chat and get to know each other."" Umm I had been with DH almost five years at that point. I had talked to her several times, called and chatted. Met up with her for lunch.  At this point I was insulted that she had no clue about me.   She constantly would call then complain about the woos of her life. It got to be depressing to hear her complain. There was never anything positive. She would never do anything to improve her life. She just spews filth and negative comments. Talked down about my DH. There just was a point we realized we didn't want the negative manipulation in our life anymore.  These are just background stories.  I have more detailed examples but I'm on my phone and typing this out."
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,kmn12,28,Sat May 9 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"I only brought up her daughter because the reason she wet the bed is because they didn't potty train her at all. The daycare did it, I helped train her (I watched her during the day for nearly a year)  and they just were too lazy to do it. She never wet the bad at my house. Only at home because MIL and FIL didn't take the time. They only bought pull ups, they used them as diapers and never taught her to use the bathroom."
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,catnamedbear,15,Sat May 9 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"Oh geez, that's like abuse/neglect"
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,redqueenswrath,5,Sat May 9 05:41:20 2015 UTC,Another common cause of prolonged bed wetting is an undersized bladder combined with a heavy sleeper. It's shockingly common.
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,redqueenswrath,1 point,Sat May 9 06:07:57 2015 UTC,My doc told my mom that it would catch up on it's own and it did. I can't imagine having it forcibly stretched!!! That seems like absolute torture.
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,Boredfromnotworking,6,Sun May 10 00:29:20 2015 UTC,Don't do it intill she is ready! Easier on you and her. Do you want to walk around all day and ask if she wants to go to the potty? If she is ready than she will tell you she wants to go. If you start to early bladder problems and bowel problems will come up. What's the point. She is only 2. Give yourself and her time.
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,WombatBeans,5,Sun May 10 11:30:36 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, I didn't do any of that potty training nonsense. My definition of potty trained is you handle it yourself or you come ask for help. Not me following a kid around all day asking if they need to pee every 10 minutes, and cleaning poop out of underwear and off the floor. It's not a war I was keen on fighting.   Both of my kids went from diapers to underwear in a day. They were both 3 when it happened (oldest a couple weeks before she turned 3, and my youngest a month or so after she turned 3), but in the grand scheme of things it's not a big deal. They knew where the bathroom was, they knew what it was for and I let them decide when they were ready ""when you want to use the toilet you let me know and I'll get you big girl panties"". It really was that easy. People give themselves ulcers trying to potty train a kid that isn't ready because other people have decided it needs to happen.   Technically I had an extra year of diapers, but technically not...if a kid is still having multiple daytime accidents and relies on pullups you still have a kid in diapers.  Nighttime accidents depend on the kid, but with my 2 they've never had a single accident night or day since the day they told me they wanted to wear underwear and use the toilet. Maybe I did it wrong, but my results were awesome so whatever."
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,Boredfromnotworking,4,Sun May 10 12:32:02 2015 UTC,That is exactly what I did! Both my kids were 3. My mom would bitch that I needed to train them they were to old. How is it training when you are running after them begging them to go to the bathroom? Everything you said is what I did! I was told by my mother I was doing it wrong too. Oh well it is much easier when you trust yourself and your kids.
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,WombatBeans,4,Sat May 9 15:54:24 2015 UTC,"I had another mom tell me that if kids weren't potty trained by 2 at the latest they were a ""lost cause."" Funny because my lost causes never had an accident and her kids that she did EC with from birth had multiple accidents a day still at age 4. So...I think in that scenario I'd rather have the lost cause. ;)"
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,Boredfromnotworking,5,Sat May 9 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who was the same way. Force potty trained her boy. Multiple UTI and accident. Forced trained her girl. Girl got so nervous about pooping that it caused a shitball that tore her anus. For the next two months she had to manually pull shit out of her kids ass. I was in the same position, had a two year old a newborn. No thank you, I would wait! Of course my second kid decide he was done with diapers when I was out of town with out my husband! My husband pretty much taught them, I always said since I don't have a penis how was I supposed to tell them how to use it! LOL"
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,LRGinCharge,3,Sat May 9 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"A ""lost cause""?! Lol, did she think they would be going off to college in diapers??"
JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,WombatBeans,3,Sat May 9 16:30:57 2015 UTC,"Oh a lost cause wouldn't go to college, they'd work their dead end job where ever in diapers."

JUSTNOMIL,35cx1l,Jug_Band,2,Sun May 10 22:35:33 2015 UTC,I'm currently at 30 weeks with my second and my two year old had his regular checkup last week.  He is interested but not real excited to use the potty and his pediatrician specifically told us to either go hard core before the new one shows up or wait until the baby is at least a few months old.  She said that with schedules and the craziness of a newborn there is absolutely no reason to put any of us through the stress of potty training.  You are being a good mom and your MIL is an ass.
JUSTNOMIL,35a06q,Ilezreb,9,Fri May 8 10:37:02 2015 UTC,In a month she'll be howling that you NEVER let her spend any time with her grandbabies and you're just so mean. There is no winning with crazy people.
JUSTNOMIL,35a06q,WombatBeans,5,Fri May 8 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"Yea, we have gotten a lot of whining from her about how our oldest doesn't love her etc, and she got really upset when she found out that he rushed to my mum and gave her a massive hug after not seeing her for 6 months. Well, maybe if you spent your time playing with him and making him like you instead of shouting at him about everything he would like you :S"
JUSTNOMIL,35a06q,WombatBeans,3,Sat May 9 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"My MIL blatantly favors my oldest, and then bitches that my youngest doesn't like her. Well, if someone treated me like a pebble in their shoe my whole life I wouldn't like them either! She seriously doesn't know why my youngest wants nothing to do with her. -_-"
JUSTNOMIL,35a06q,allpregnantandshit,16,Sat May 9 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"You did exactly what I would have done. Exactly. Like sure, that's fine, you don't ever have to watch my kids. On the flip side, do not EVER expect a favor from me. Ever, ever. We are parents of two kids and whatever bullshit thing you think you need or want help with does not take even an iota of precedence.   Also, have fun willfully killing your liver and trying to derive sympathy from it."
JUSTNOMIL,35a06q,missamberlee,11,Fri May 8 13:01:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) Yea, I'm at the point where I really don't want any help from her at all because she'll hold it over my head for years. I recently mentioned how I need to buy a stage 2 carseat for the baby, she then gets mad cause apparently she saved my sons carseat from when he was little (I didn't know she'd done that) and now she's been storing this chair that I won't use. Sorry, I'm not using an old chair that's been in your attic for years just so you can feel good. Since this was mentioned she's tried to guilt me about it several times. (she's not low on storage space, she's got a whole attic that's empty.)  And yea, I have no idea how to respond to the drinking problem comment. Pretty sure she'd deny it if we brought it up."
JUSTNOMIL,35a06q,trianna-uk,12,Fri May 8 13:35:08 2015 UTC,"Here in the US, car seats have expiration dates on them. If you have that there, perhaps you could blame that as the reason you need a new one?"
JUSTNOMIL,35a06q,celest3alove,4,Fri May 8 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"I think she has accepted that I want a new one, she's just taking an excuse to try and play martyr over the fact that she's been saving the old one and her nice gesture isn't being appreciated."
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,apotero,30,Thu May 7 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"Meh. If it were me, I would roll my eyes and go get a pedicure while my husband took kiddo. Sure it may be a little weird but I really pick my battles and try to limit them to stuff that wastes my own time/money, or that is unnecessarily harmful/risky."
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,jules0072,6,Thu May 7 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm thinking. I don't like the idea, I don't want her to think we're going to pander to her but I do want to choose my battles wisely and since hubs is the one who got asked I feel like me saying no is more of a spite thing than an actual concern. But I do think she's weird with this behavior, and some others."
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,poptartaddict,3,Fri May 8 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"It is kinda weird. I mean my MIL and my mom live in the same town as I do. They both work literally, 10 minutes from my house and they have never asked me to go out of my way to show my kids off. I mean I have stopped by for other reasons and if course they'll show whoever's around, but other than that they use pictures like normal people. However, I agree that you should probably let this one go. If it starts to turn into something more then you put your foot down."
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,dtowngirl18901,8,Fri May 8 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"One thing I'll point out is that your son will probably be so overwhelmed by all the new people/faces cooing over him and coming at him. Nobody will be malicious, of course, but they will all come close to say hello to him. I'm not sure how old your son is, but my daughters are 2 1/2 years and 15 months. My mom loves to show them off to friends and colleagues, especially since we live on the other side of the country. When we visit, I have to set some restrictions, otherwise my mom would plan ""meet & greets"" every day of our weeklong visit. I always suggest that the first three or four days we don't see anyone but family. This allows my daughters to warm up to the grandparents and feel more comfortable in their surroundings. Then I allow two meet & greets spread over the next 3-4 days. I paint it as being better for my parents, because it is most important for my daughters to bond with their grandparents, not their friends and colleagues. So, if you allow your husband to take your son, I would just let the discomfort happen organically. Your son will play shy, he will hide in your husband's arms, and your MIL will be embarrassed. So you can say, ""I told you so."" And just say ""Not again until he's older."""
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,faiora,13,Fri May 8 05:05:40 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't be okay with it. If my kid was a baby at the time I wouldn't want him exposed to so many unknown people (MIL's co-workers), and if he was a toddler or young kid, I think he'd be horribly bored and/or upset by the event and the long drive. MIL's co-workers have no importance in your son's life, so why should he make a special trip to meet them?  If your MIL wants to show him off to her co-workers and friends, I'd say send her some pictures, or meet up with her at some point and she can take her own pictures. Whichever."
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,allpregnantandshit,5,Thu May 7 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"I think this is what confuses me. It's like why do you want to show off to co-workers? She has plenty of pictures, I email them to her and FIL/SIL so it's not like she has to go without. I just don't get why they have to meet my child. He's just shy of 5. Is she just that lonely or have nothing else going on with her own life that she has to show off my kids?"
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,silver_eyed,15,Fri May 8 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"Not to mention her coworkers probably don't give a shit. Nothing against your kid- I'm sure he's great- but when they're not related to you it's kinda like ""Huh, cute kid. Next conversation..."" Driving 40 min one way for that? Brutal."
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,trianna-uk,6,Fri May 8 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"My parents both like to show off my daughter to their coworkers. However, they both work in the same town I live. I think it's pretty silly to drive that far just so she can show him off.   But since it's your husband doing it and not you, I think you should just take the time to do something relaxing for yourself and just let them be ridiculous."
JUSTNOMIL,3583rm,cordsniper,4,Fri May 8 04:00:44 2015 UTC,"My mother found out I changed shifts to an early morning instead of afternoon.  First week she asked if we could swing by her church so that the congregation could see my child.  It's an hour drive away and due to finish at about the time we would manage to get there if hubby threw child into the car and I sprint in without changing to civvies.  No mum, it really isn't feasible for me to pander to your needs to pretend you have a very close relationship to my child.  And no, I am not meeting some random church minister in my area just because you ask every week.  (NB: I do feel like I'm a lapsed Christian, believe in the message just not the delivery.  Husband believes there is something but hasn't found a description that fits yet. So we want our daughter to choose a religion when she can make an informed choice.)"

JUSTNOMIL,354hhu,catnamedbear,17,Thu May 7 16:05:25 2015 UTC,Your description made me laugh so hard. I'm sorry she's so inept at communicating with your babe. I've never experienced an adult who talks to a toddler like they're also an adult. If anything I observe adults misremembering how advanced kids can be
JUSTNOMIL,354hhu,allpregnantandshit,13,Thu May 7 01:44:05 2015 UTC,"Like, my kid talks a lot for a 2yo? But not about costco, or 4 wheelers, or fucking pheasants.  I seriously don't even think I've ever even said the word pheasant out loud in my life until I met this woman. She's cool and everything (compared to some of the Monster-In-Laws you hear about in here), but seriously, know your audience, wtf. 2yos don't give a fuck about anything."
JUSTNOMIL,354hhu,allpregnantandshit,15,Thu May 7 03:01:50 2015 UTC,This was hilarious. Especially number five.  Damn I can't believe your daughter lasted 20 minutes through all that bullshit. At least you know she doesn't have ADD. I would've zoned out before the pheasants even arrived on the scene.

Mine didn't work out that well but sometimes it's a nice way to compartmentalize your thoughts before you actually have to speak to the person. You can lay out some of the things the doctor has told you about his weight: (risk for diabetes, social problems at school, delayed puberty...there are a million reasons...) and ask her ""mother to mother"" if she can please understand how much your child means to you, and how you want him the healthiest and happiest he can possibly be. If you come at it from a plea rather than a pissed off bitchfest it might go over better.  The other thing you can do is tell her that because you're working so hard on his health, he won't be able to come over until it gets under control.  If she rubs your nose in the dirt, remember that's where flowers come from and breathe deeply. Seriously. If anyone approaches you about it, tell them your very reasonable perspective. Your kid is more important than your reputation. And most people will probably know she's just being a shitty MIL anyway."
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,allpregnantandshit,16,Thu May 7 01:53:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your suggestions. I will write down my thoughts to help me be ready. Unfortunately I am horrible at confrontation but, I will talk to her when she come homes from work tomorrow.  You are right, my son is more important than my reputation. That was a hard reminder. Thank you"
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,l-x,14,Thu May 7 02:09:30 2015 UTC,"Great advice above. I'd just add that moreso than the plea (which makes it seem like the ball is in her court - it isn't), make it more like a ""he's a kid, he can't regulate his weight or choose his diet on his own. He needs help to do that, and I need your help to make sure he eats healthy food. It's not fair to him to make it a choice between having fun with grandma and eating healthy. Let's make it both, and let's agree that fun and healthy food don't have to be mutually exclusive."""
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,allpregnantandshit,9,Thu May 7 14:52:28 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! You articulated what I couldn't. That is a very nice and gentle way of saying what needs to be said. My MIL is my son's special person in life. Me and her have a strained relationship but I never let that get in the way of them. This response is perfect. Her reaction will show me how much she is willing to help me out on this. Thank you again!
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,allpregnantandshit,2,Thu May 7 15:18:38 2015 UTC,Great advice! Worded very well.

I know mothers and MIL's love to the the ""grandma of the year,"" but when it comes at a detriment to the child, mama bear has to bring out the claws. :)"
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,allpregnantandshit,2,Thu May 7 02:14:58 2015 UTC,If anyone approaches her about it she should tell them to fuck off and worry about their own goddamn children.  You don't owe anyone an explanation for wanting your child to eat healthily.
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,unsanctimommy,3,Thu May 7 15:12:20 2015 UTC,Agreed! Since OP doesn't seem like the type to tell people to fuck off I tried a gentler approach. I on the other hand would tell them to eat a bag of dicks. :)
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,apotero,2,Thu May 7 15:38:19 2015 UTC,I love saying that! I once told my elderly neighbor to go choke on a damn dick. (He deserved it.) I found out later that day I was preggo with my firstborn. No regrets
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,redqueenswrath,8,Mon May 11 19:44:38 2015 UTC,"How does your husband feel about all this? You're absolutely right to be upset at her undermining all your work with your son to teach him healthier habits. Your husband needs to point out to his mom that this isn't okay and if she can't be trusted to follow guideline for his health, your son won't be going with her."
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,fruitjerky,1 point,Thu May 7 04:18:53 2015 UTC,He agrees with me and is upset also. When it comes to standing up to his parents they have the bluff on him. He works out of town 4 to 5 weeks at a time so it is up to me since he isn't here.

I'm twitching.    I remember when I was a kid and spent every other weekend with my dad and stepmom, and they just fed me junk. It was awesome! I love junk! My mom hardly ever gave me junk! ...But I got so sick.  Every weekend, without fail, I'd feel sick. I hope your little dude's tummy wasn't too outraged with what it was fed."
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,WombatBeans,13,Thu May 7 05:17:00 2015 UTC,"You absolutely have the right to be upset.  She's disregarding his current and future health for her own convienence. She needs to stop.  Although she will claim that the one day couldn't have done any damage,  she's wrong.  It'll increase his desires for the bad foods, and make his regular diet seem like a punishment."

Had it been just the oreo blast, or just the McDonalds...okay whatever, everyone gets a cheat meal, but to feed him nothing but crap ALL day? I'm amazed he didn't get sick honestly."
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,rocknrollnicole,2,Thu May 7 16:08:20 2015 UTC,"I would just straight up tell her that what she did was wrong and that you are not okay with her blatantly ignoring your wishes for your son.  I tried writing a letter to my MIL but she misread part of it and got really upset. If she does talk crap about you to everyone else, its really she who will wind up looking bad."
JUSTNOMIL,354jcv,megsandbaby,3,Thu May 7 15:24:26 2015 UTC,"I'd be pissed. You worked hard on something important and she's just threw it out the window. Occasional junk is ok, but not binge eating junk all day like that. Your husband will need to step in and set her straight to help offload the pressure from you looking like the bad guy. If she resists and gives a lot issues, than maybe a doctors note would help? As silly as it sounds, it might make more of an important impression if it came from a doctor (since DIL's can't be taken seriously). Seriously though, great job on your part to make sure your son eats right. That's smart of you to pack foods for him when he's with your inlaws."

We don't want them to think your weird so add them!), and then yells at their daughter for posting ""inappropriate"" things in case their friends see it and disapprove.   Edit: Same mother is now posting pictures of her daughter to her own page and tagging her while she's trying to get ready for work.

As far as getting. Help, just because she refuses counseling doesn't mean you have to. Going to counseling to discuss your MIL's situation might help you and your husband tremendously.

She expects a card for all holidays, made up or not (including Valentines day). I once entertained the idea of actually looking up a bunch of random bullshit days and sending her cards for them...Talk like a Pirate Day for example. I could make them myself (I digi-scrap) and get them printed just for her, but I'm not sure it would be worth the hassle. I guess since she doesn't celebrate Talk like a Pirate day I could send that card (and a pirated themed gift) and then act butthurt that she didn't send me chocolate coins and an eye patch in return.

They both expect that we will spend every single holiday (or as close to it as possible) with them. Except, we've got to visit them each seperately.   My mom has been hesitant to spend too much time with MIL since the wedding as well, when MIL was whipped into a fenzy with her friends and started accusing my mom to be a theif and a ""gold digger"" after her son-in-law to be.   We will be moving soon, so the expectation to spend all holidays with each parent will decrease tremendously and hopefully earn us some breathing room."

But who knows, maybe he likes it that way.  I don't think she thinks she needs any help, I mean, right now what's the incentive? She has you guys tiptoeing around her emotions and doing everything humanly possible to avoid tantrums. That must make her feel pretty damn important!"
JUSTNOMIL,351bdq,SkittlzAnKomboz,10,Wed May 6 15:55:09 2015 UTC,"I'll set the scene for you.   During our engagement, DH and I were hanging out late in the evening. We were likely planning out details of the wedding, being lovey dovey, that stort of thing.   It was 2 AM. MIL calls DH and demands that he go pick her up a patty melt from ""24hour restaurant"". DH replies, no, it's late, and he was spending time with me. After a screaming fit from MIL, she hangs up and DH began to drive me back to my house where we continued to hang out until we received a phone call from her.  It turns out she had driven herself to ""24 hour restaurant"" Blubbered the whole time while inside about her terrible son (her words) until the waitstaff felt bad enough for her to comp her meal (she bragged). Then she wandered outside aimlessly in a mess of tears and began to force herself to throw up. Apparently she was in full view of all patrons inside because the waitstaff rushed to help her. Her point of telling DH all this was to tell him that other people thought he was a horrible son and 'poor pitiful me'.   Sadly, that wasn't the first or last time she worked herself into an illness because DH wouldn't give in to her. There was another vomiting episode, as well as an incident that went on her permanent medical record, that she cannot expunge and is furious over."
JUSTNOMIL,351bdq,SkittlzAnKomboz,6,Wed May 6 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, just wow. My bet is that the waitstaff comped her meal as a GTFO, and was probably like ""yeah, sure, he's awful"" while secretly thinking poor guy.

JUSTNOMIL,351bdq,LadyOfSighs,11,Thu May 7 03:25:01 2015 UTC,"I think you're making the right decision, and you have been a saint all these years. Lord knows I would not have been as nice as you. I used to pick out the gifts for MIL for the various things, because my husband won't or forgets, then I realized that nothing is ever good enough for my MIL, if I'm going to get a heap of shit anyway I may as well save the money.   The thing to keep in mind (and it seems you do know it) is that she can have her explosion, but you don't have to deal with it. You don't have to answer your phone (or door) or listen to those voicemails. You can take the step back that your husband seems to have.  It does sound like she needs professional help, but if she refuses to get it and instead insists on alienating the little family she does have, well... it's her loss."

I gently nudge my husband to call his dad, invite my FIL over, bring him with us to family holidays (FIL is single, DH is an only child by his father). FIL knows.

You end up at the ER ""what did he eat?"" Uh...a cupcake which has about 40 ingredients so good freaking luck figuring out what he's allergic to now! That's why pediatricians say to introduce new foods one at a time spread out every few days.

Find a pediatrician/advice columnist to help you make a food schedule (ie, we won't introduce food x till age y), show it to MIL, and tell her if she violates it she's done. The enforce it."
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,faiora,20,Tue May 5 19:27:59 2015 UTC,"By trying to forcefeed sugary treats to a very young baby, your MiL proved that she is absolutely not to be trusted.  Please, please, please tell us you won't let your baby with her again."
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,KHeaney,18,Tue May 5 18:54:05 2015 UTC,"Holy shit.  I'd never let the kid out of my sight with MIL.  In fact I didn't, because i knew she'd pull shit like this."
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,kitush,13,Tue May 5 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't leave my kids with anyone who had their own obese children, until my children were old enough to make smart food choices for themselves.   I get downright angry when I see people with young, obese children. It's one thing to have problems with your own self control (in fact, I'm guilty of this myself and I'm overweight), but it's another thing entirely to make unhealthy choices for someone who isn't capable of preparing their own food or making healthy choices for themselves.   When you have a child, you are in control of everything they eat. And if your kids become obese under your care, it means you're doing something wrong. (I'd like to qualify this by saying I'm generally referring to people with multiple obese children. If there's only one, or if one in the group is obese, it's difficult to tell whether there's some other health problem causing the obesity... but that's very rare anyway)  Anyway. Long story short, I'd tell her outright that her kids are fat and unhealthy, and you'd rather raise a healthy child. But, I'm seeing red so it's probably better not to listen to me."
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,Never_Really,7,Tue May 5 21:29:46 2015 UTC,"""you're going to be a bad mom if you look up every little thing.""   That is such a tantrum thing to say. ""I didn't get what I want so I'm going to make you feel bad. Logic be damned!"""
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,kitush,6,Wed May 6 07:46:27 2015 UTC,"That one made me so pissed. My baby was a week old and I was pretty vulnerable at the time. It was in front of her husband and a family friend, but luckily my SO called her out in front of everyone so she had to awkwardly apologize. Hehe"
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,apotero,5,Wed May 6 09:29:49 2015 UTC,Just as a sidenote - there are two types of diabetes. Type 1 which is childhood and is NOT  related to consumption of sweets and chhcolatez and obesity. Type 2 tends to be in adult years and tends to be related to diet.  Eating sweets at such a young age will just give kids the taste for it and encourage bad eating habbits.
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,Cyannide_Bunnies,5,Wed May 6 06:09:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saying this. I'm a Type 1 Diabetic (aka Juvenile Diabetes) and was diagnosed as an infant. My immune system killed off the islet cells in my pancreas that produce insulin, amylin, and c-peptide. It had fuck all to do with what I ate. I'm not obese and never have been."
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,kaelta,3,Fri May 8 03:39:01 2015 UTC,It's in the family and I hate it when ill informed people make comments on our diet being the reason for it. They once made my mum cry for their stupid comments.
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,monster_bunny,3,Fri May 8 08:35:09 2015 UTC,He had type 2 :(.   Edit: as a kid she'd buy him whatever. Even multiple energy drinks at a time. The kids they have now are the same. Hell they eat donuts for breakfast if they have them in the house.
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,monster_bunny,3,Wed May 6 09:23:36 2015 UTC,Fuck this bitch in particular. I'd flat out ban all sweets from her.
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,nomorechocolatebars,2,Tue May 5 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Ugh! Your MIL is as bad as my FIL! Granted, his kids and grandchildren don't have diabetes (the older men on both sides of the family do), but the kids weren't fed like that and the grandkids aren't always there. Anyway, when I saw him FEEDING A 6TH MONTH OLD SODA I told everyone I didn't want him to feed my son sugar until at least 1 year. Their reaction?  ""Oh, he does that to all of them and won't change."" Told my husband his dad is not to be alone with our son and he agrees. God! My just barely 1 year old nephew KNOWS  the difference between soda and other drinks and will cry and cry if he sees a soda and doesn't get it.  I'd stop letting your MIL alone with him until you are okay with him getting sugar like that."
JUSTNOMIL,34yt06,mnh1,3,Tue May 5 22:56:49 2015 UTC,No more watching the kids for that MIL. She's the bad mother.

JUSTNOMIL,34yhra,allpregnantandshit,8,Wed May 6 02:58:13 2015 UTC,Okay...why exactly? I'm legitimately confused.
JUSTNOMIL,34yhra,monster_bunny,11,Tue May 5 22:01:21 2015 UTC,In posted last week about how my MIL is an entitled snot about her fake gluten intolerance.  http://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/349ukb/my_mil_is_rude_and_insulting_xpost_from/.compact
JUSTNOMIL,34yhra,monster_bunny,12,Tue May 5 22:34:52 2015 UTC,"Oh My God. Don't even get me started on fake gluten intolerance. I was misdiagnosed with it TWENTY years ago, when nobody knew what the fuck Gluten was- it was literally HELL on my social life and caused me to have unhealthy eating habits. I'm so glad I had a second opinion five years later and went in for the upper endoscopy and colonoscopy to confirm it from a GI MD, and not some neighborhood quack doctor. The one thing positive I can say about the Gluten fad is that it has brought a tremendous amount of new products and awareness to those who legitimately have Celiac. But for people who snottily claim they don't eat gluten because they are ""allergic"" to it, need to shut their gluten pie-crust holes. I feel really awful for your family member that has Celiac Sprue. Shit is no joke and can easily land you in a hospital if you skipped over ""modified food starch"" on the label.   Your MIL would drive me insane."
JUSTNOMIL,34yhra,WombatBeans,7,Tue May 5 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"I think you might enjoy this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oht9AEq1798   My MIL also can't have gluten when it's inconvenient for everyone else. She also can't have dairy, unless not having it will inconvenience her of course. Jokes on her, my kids are lactose intolerant and my oldest kid has Celiac Disease, I can work around her fake allergies no problem. I'm waiting for her to develop another allergy, since she can't inconvenience me with her current ones."

JUSTNOMIL,34vvmw,WombatBeans,9,Tue May 5 01:30:08 2015 UTC,"Well...you did offer her something to drink. ;) But yeah she should have gotten it herself, and said please/thank you.   When people come to my house for the first time I tell them where things are and that they can help themselves to whatever they need/want. 2nd and subsequent visits, you know the drill, do your thing.

She then proceeds to scrape a piece of pizza into the salad I made for her and put the naked crust back into the pizza box. What the hell."

JUSTNOMIL,34vvmw,monster_bunny,12,Tue May 5 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"So let me get this straight- YOU OFFERED your MIL something to drink, and you're offended that she took you up on it?   I think you might be in the wrong here. Perhaps if you said something like, ""Would you like something to drink? I have sodas in the fridge- please help yourself while I sit down and rest my legs while I can"" would have been more appropriate."
JUSTNOMIL,34vvmw,monster_bunny,-1,Tue May 5 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, you bet - my phrasing was definitely responsible.  I guess I just couldn't believe that my MIL actually expected a woman who'd given birth recently to get up and get her lazy ass a drink.  :)"
JUSTNOMIL,34ui5j,8_of_my_dollars,28,Mon May 4 17:49:17 2015 UTC,She sounds like a malicious moron.
