sailormoon,3e1tib,BlazingSakura,18,Tue Jul 21 08:31:08 2015 UTC,lol @ the percentage who hate Chibi-Usa
sailormoon,3e1tib,khasiv,7,Tue Jul 21 17:54:48 2015 UTC,Some questions are repetitive. I had to answer favorite villain and character multiple times?
sailormoon,3e1tib,SailorMooooon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:16 2015 UTC,"I tried my best. I tried to group the characters differently, like I wanted to know who people's overall favorite main character was, but I also wanted to know how they did relative to others. For instance, if your favorite Senshi is Uranus, I still want to know who people's favorite Senshi is among just the Inners, so I get a feel for that. I apologize if it is repetitive."
sailormoon,3e1tib,andre_bluesman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:25 2015 UTC,"it's not that bad, actually."
sailormoon,3e1tib,Magnum__PI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't think they were repetitive.  You were asking the same questions, but with broad v. narrow response options.  Don't worry about it.  More data never hurts.  :)"
sailormoon,3e1tib,Curse-10,18,Tue Jul 21 22:41:16 2015 UTC,I find the last question annoying since it only has one choice.
sailormoon,3e1tib,Chilloa,13,Tue Jul 21 11:40:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was already on the fence about submitting my answers because the questions were a bit repetitive, so I started scrolling down. I saw the final question and figured it was a joke survey. Closed tab."
sailormoon,3e1tib,SoulCrystal,5,Tue Jul 21 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"Its just something cute the author left in, whats wrong with that? Surely you've seen similar things on other surveys, or even teacher exams?"
sailormoon,3e1tib,rainbow-sailor,13,Tue Jul 21 13:32:48 2015 UTC,It's just annoying. Mercury is actually my LEAST favorite Inner Senshi.
sailormoon,3e1tib,khasiv,3,Tue Jul 21 14:14:47 2015 UTC,Is it because she's a Wesley?
sailormoon,3e1tib,rainbow-sailor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:50 2015 UTC,Reference pls.
sailormoon,3e1tib,khasiv,2,Tue Jul 21 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, now that I'm reading about it again, it doesn't fit her. But it's a TV tropes thing."
sailormoon,3e1tib,rainbow-sailor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:29 2015 UTC,I can't go on TV Tropes right now I'm at work I'll get super fired.
sailormoon,3e1tib,quaileyeforthefatguy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"A ""Wesley"" is a major character that's hated by the fanbase. It's named after Wesley Crusher from Star Trek."

sailormoon,3e1tib,miasmal_smoke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:29 2015 UTC,Wasnt Mercury the fan favourite in Japan by a wide margin though?
sailormoon,3e1tib,rainbow-sailor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:28 2015 UTC,Yes. In Japan during polls that are probably really outdated. People don't generally seem to be too fond of her on this sub.
sailormoon,3e1tib,carouselunicorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"Now that I'm at home, no, not cause she's a Wesley or anything. It's just that she's the 'smart' character so everyone IRL assumes she's my favorite and ""OMG SO ALIKE!!!11!"" and just...nope. She's boring. Give me Minako or Mars any day. Or Haruka. She can kick some ass."
sailormoon,3e1tib,rainbow-sailor,2,Tue Jul 21 22:06:03 2015 UTC,Same! I noticed someone hates Minako and my heart broke.
sailormoon,3e1tib,Bellexandria,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:00 2015 UTC,How can anyone hate Minako?! She's Best Girl.
sailormoon,3e1tib,KalmiaKamui,3,Tue Jul 21 20:35:59 2015 UTC,It is in no way a serious question. Soul pretty much hit it on the mark. Can't I have just have a little fun?
sailormoon,3e1tib,KalmiaKamui,6,Tue Jul 21 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"It would be cute if it weren't required, but I personally find it annoying to click a one option thing thats required (I'm lazy). I did like the question though."
sailormoon,3e1tib,rainbow-sailor,5,Tue Jul 21 15:13:24 2015 UTC,"It's not required, though."
sailormoon,3e1tib,sjwoah,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"It was, but I changed it."
sailormoon,3e1tib,SoulCrystal,4,Tue Jul 21 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"Well, thank you for that, then!  I'm not terribly fond of Ami myself.  >.>"
sailormoon,3e1tib,sjwoah,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:34 2015 UTC,"That sounds fair. I can do that. In fact, I'll just take all the requirements off."
sailormoon,3e1tib,eclipse278,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"I never said it was a serious question, just an annoying one."
sailormoon,3e1tib,ryouchanx4,0,Tue Jul 21 16:41:00 2015 UTC,It is just a little joke. I intentionally put that there as a little jab at you all.
sailormoon,3e1tib,RPPUTC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:12 2015 UTC,It gave me a good laugh!
sailormoon,3e1tib,StevieSpade,5,Tue Jul 21 20:06:43 2015 UTC,Its so hard to pick a favorite chapter and episode ;_; I love S and Stars so much.
sailormoon,3e1tib,StevieSpade,4,Tue Jul 21 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"To whoever put ""69 (LOL)"" as their favorite chapter, I laughed way too hard at that. Very unexpected, well done."
sailormoon,3e1tib,Magnum__PI,5,Tue Jul 21 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"Alright, you can review the results as they come in here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LvfuacM-HRSWEnFDE3NT7Iwbf_BGK2RIw7JrV4D0LpI/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm  I understand some of you were a bit upset by the repetitive nature of the questions, and I apologize, but I've been finding all the results pretty interesting anyways.  Edit: I should probably also apologize for my joke question at the end. I'm used to subs like these not taking that stuff so seriously, but I guess that is not the case here because apparently Sailor Moon is serious business."
sailormoon,3e1tib,ansley114,5,Tue Jul 21 15:53:12 2015 UTC,Not sure what this joke you're referring to is?
sailormoon,3e1tib,ExLenne,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:38 2015 UTC,I like you.
sailormoon,3e1tib,madhattergirl,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:19 2015 UTC,A bit mm repetitive but I didn't mind. I love surveys that deal with Sailor Moon.
sailormoon,3e3hv0,Rook-walnut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:03 2015 UTC,"No idea, but I'm curious too. The ball joint on my SH Venus's ankle doesn't quite fit its socket, and it makes one of her legs longer than the other."
sailormoon,3e3hv0,WeekendWerewolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"I've never had any cracks, but one of Uranus' shoulders has a difficult time staying in ever since I took it out to switch out to the static arms. And one of the pig tails on my first edition Sailor Moon won't click in either, so it falls out anytime there's movement. :("
sailormoon,3e3hv0,princessDB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:32 2015 UTC,My Sailor Chibi Moon's left hair poof comes off if I handle her too much.

sailormoon,3e3hv0,princessDB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:17 2015 UTC,My sailor moon snapped at the wrist ball joint. Like hairline snap. So tiny I don't even know if I could get in there with super glue or of that would even be worth it

sailormoon,3dt2ir,sjwoah,4,Sun Jul 19 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for an authentic Samantha Vega x Sailor Moon bag, I think they're all sold out at this point. They were originally sold on the Isetan website.   You can try finding them through the Yahoo Japan Auction website here using the search ""美少女戦士セーラームーン"" which is ""Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon"" in Japanese.   Ebay might have them too, but be aware that 99% are fakes. Anything under $200 is likely fake, and anything from China is DEFINITELY fake.  If you find one you want, and it's on a website that's in Japanese / only ships in Japan (darn you Bandai), you can use FromJapan as a courier service to ship it to you. They will charge a fee, but I bought the Sailor Moon Locket and it shipped to me safely.   Good luck!"

sailormoon,3dqczy,poppy-picklesticks,4,Sat Jul 18 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"More like they need to bring in a new director and new writers, not give the existing ones more freedom.  They're the ones that came up with the whole Shitennou debacle and killing Beryl by shattering her necklace.    I'd say the only additions to the manga that are unique to Crystal that are really good came from the Mercury and Jupiter episodes.  Both of the Jupiter episodes were outstanding.  Keep whoever was responsible for those."
sailormoon,3dqczy,OtakuD50,0,Sat Jul 18 17:43:54 2015 UTC,"The Jupiter one is probably far and away my favourite of the first arc.  They just captured the essence of the character and what makes her so unique and charming at the same time.  That Youma did not stand a chance. Boom.  Gurl bai.   The Mercury ones were good for similar reasons as well: they both fleshed out Ami's vulnerabilities and hidden strengths at the same time.  My favourite episode of the second arc was easily the Berthier episode, as I think she is probably the best example of a well used villain in Crystal or the best used villain that is not top tier rank like Beryl, Metallia, Demande and Wiseman: she appears throughout the episode and maintains a considerable threat throughout it, building up her presence.  Whilst she of course lacks all of the complex characterisations of her R counterpart, she has unique quirks that have become so rare for Sailor Moon Crystal characters, especially the villains: namely her fondness for chess metaphors and similes, and the way she sweetly and coldly dissects her opponents psychologically.   Her powers were also extremely unique, namely her use of the pendulum and her water powers that showed how horribly Ami outclassed was. Seriously Berthier's water attack is easily one of the most gorgeously animated things in Crystal, and they added a supernatural feel to it that her original Dark Water lacked, by having ghostly illusions appear in the water, linking the sisters to their name of Ayakashi, a type of water spectre.   Berthier had a great deal of potential as a villain due to her design, powers and personality that is often lacking in the manga/Crystal villains, and as the reviewer on IGN notes, it was a shame that she only lasted for one episode."

Unless the episode ends with a message saying ""Sailor Moon Crystal will return!"" or they formally announce that it will continue, I will temper my expectations.  I'd love for the series to continue. I'd love to see the remaining three arcs animated (though I love the entire series, Infinity, Dream, and Stars are my favorite story arcs of the manga).

She also noticed that the voice actress for Sailor Moon says (2014 - ) for how long she's been on the show (same as imdb). She she's thinking that maybe it means the show will continue on."
sailormoon,3dkczu,MRS-SATAN_MD,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"For example, the spiral heart wand proplica was announced and she pointed out the proplicas tend to line up with where the anime is at right now.   Interesting, though that could have just been coincidence up to this point. It could be as simple as they planned to release one every certain-amount-of-time and it just happened to line up with the series since the releases were coming in order.   She also noticed that the voice actress for Sailor Moon says (2014 - ) for how long she's been on the show (same as imdb)   This is a really common practice for television shows while they're running, and doesn't really mean anything more than ""the show is currently airing.""   I'm not trying to poke holes. Once again, I'm just trying not get my hopes up until something legitimate happens. Neither of these things in particular are things that would lead me to believe the series is definitely continuing."

sailormoon,3dducw,indigosnowflake,32,Wed Jul 15 14:25:42 2015 UTC,I have never understood this.
sailormoon,3dducw,dig_the_dead,36,Wed Jul 15 15:12:29 2015 UTC,That combined with Usagi's obvious jealousy of a little girl when chibi first shows up on the scene...  ...just weird.
sailormoon,3dducw,thilardiel,22,Wed Jul 15 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"I grew up with the 90s anime in the US. Chibi annoyed the crap out of me! This whole issue made it worse and grossed me out, yuck."
sailormoon,3dducw,Faydre,6,Wed Jul 15 17:04:17 2015 UTC,I grew up the same way. Just...yeah.
sailormoon,3dducw,thilardiel,19,Wed Jul 15 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"And how the jealousy continues even after the whole future daughter thing is revealed. Obviously I love this show to death, but this story arch had so many ""oh god, no!"" moments"
sailormoon,3dducw,highly_animated,23,Wed Jul 15 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's a very real thing for spouses to feel jealous of the time their partner spends with a new baby. The whole Oedipus part where Chibi wants to steal her daddy is what creeps me out."
sailormoon,3dducw,Magnum__PI,24,Wed Jul 15 18:48:53 2015 UTC,Agreed.  That whole... issue is seriously the weirdest thing in the entire series (in my opinion).

sailormoon,3dducw,DtheEvilQueen,13,Wed Jul 15 16:34:35 2015 UTC,Mamoru in the anime was just creepy. A college student picking on and dating 14-year-old girls which looks like it was the only thing he could do in his free time.
sailormoon,3dducw,ShellBeeShallBe,34,Wed Jul 15 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"I always took this as Chibiusa completely denouncing her family and just being corrupted by Wiseman. Like, she's now so evil she's going to take away the love of her mom's life away (or that she's just taking her mom's place and taking the king while she's at it), but it doesn't bug her as much because she doesn't see herself as a part of that family anymore. Its still weird but a little understandable? And I just figured Usagi acting jealous of Chibiusa and Mamoru just showed the contrast between how young and immature she was to the Neo Queen Serenity she becomes, plus her misunderstanding her instincts of Chibiusa being her daughter."
sailormoon,3dducw,kinyutaka,32,Wed Jul 15 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"Also, Chibiusa is mentally six. I had a crush on my cousin when I was that young. There's some fruedian theory that when little girls and boys are little, our first ""true love"" is our parents and we want to marry them."
sailormoon,3dducw,Magnum__PI,23,Wed Jul 15 18:12:50 2015 UTC,That is part of it. Black Lady is a combination of evil intent and childish aspirations.
sailormoon,3dducw,underthund3r,23,Wed Jul 15 19:31:21 2015 UTC,"I think you make a fair point - it's probably supposed to be representative of ChibiUsa's desire to be ""just like her mother"".  I just wish it was done in even a MARGINALLY less literal manner..."
sailormoon,3dducw,KeepCalmAndNikon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:54:12 2015 UTC,Ikr. When i was little watching this... even i knew this was weird. truly an OH GOD WTF moment. How could u kiss ur daughter dude :'(
sailormoon,3dducw,underthund3r,10,Wed Jul 15 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"at these moments isn't he under her control tho? I know in Crystal he's just a puppet being controlled by Dark Lady, it's been years since I saw the original or read the manga but I think it has the same thing...  I remember at one time, I was told that chibi chibi was Mamarou and   Dark Lady's daughter.. but again.. years."
sailormoon,3dducw,KeepCalmAndNikon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:25:20 2015 UTC,yes he is.  I think its chibiusa/ dark lady who is kissing him XD
sailormoon,3dducw,underthund3r,2,Wed Jul 15 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"that's what I said... Chibiusa is Dark Lady, and she's the one controlling him, kissing her..  My point is he's not aware, he's being controlled."

sailormoon,3dducw,rqnadi,15,Thu Jul 16 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"her misunderstanding her instincts of Chibiusa being her daughter.   Exactly. I mean, Usagi is told that Chibiusa is her future daughter, but... Usagi is 14-15 at this point? And she hasn't actually gone through having Chibiusa, so there's none of the biological bonding yet.  I can see how, to Usagi, Chibi was more like an annoying little sister."
sailormoon,3dducw,Creamofcelery,2,Wed Jul 15 18:34:08 2015 UTC,But if she took her dad away from her mom wouldn't she not exist anymore? Wasn't that a rule in back to the future? I feel like she should have faded away at this point.
sailormoon,3dducw,oeuvre,15,Wed Jul 15 19:30:41 2015 UTC,When I was younger and watched it in English I always assumed it just didn't translate well so it came off creepy. Now that I've seen the Japanese versions I realize it's just creepy.
sailormoon,3dducw,lornetc,11,Wed Jul 15 19:40:52 2015 UTC,"Chibiusa is a firm believer in ""incest is wincest.""   That said, it always disgusted me."

I always see her earrings as a more mid-tone, not hot but not delicate pale, warmer pink without any purple hint. I bought these and I think they're just right, color and size. There are a BUNCH of this style on etsy (the rose cabochon is very common, lots of colors) if you search for ""pink rose stud earrings"" or even ""sailor jupiter earrings"". (That second one's technically a copyright violation though.)  But if you like those, then yeah, absolutely!"
sailormoon,3db71d,Druston,5,Wed Jul 15 01:20:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like they're just a bit too dark but other than that the size and style are similar. I might buy another pair and try my luck painting them!

sailormoon,3db71d,five_inch_heels,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"I love finding Jupiter rose earrings. I've had some different pairs over the years.   I actually went looking more recently for ""everyday"" earrings and less cosplay types. Something I could wear to work or to a function without it being cheap or huge.  A lot of the ones I've had were great for fun hanging out or for actual con cosplay, but frankly cheap or gaudy for normal wear.   Here's what I found: https://www.naturesjewelry.com/itemdy00.aspx?ID=20,425&T1=J5A012  I like that they're a little smaller. They're about half to 1/3rd the size of earrings I'd wear for cosplay. They're sturdy. They fit the spirit of Jupiter rose earrings while being a little more age & situation appropriate.   Edit: Hmm. Link's a little borked on mobile.

Green is also my favorite color.  I loved the series, a lot of that stemmed from not being allowed to watch it, so it was at once a girl power fantasy and a rebellion, and all of the scouts had aspects I could relate to.  Now of course I still love it. Maybe even more for it's nostalgia benefit.   Thanks for sharing your thoughts though, even if people down voted them."

I couldn't believe they had the audacity to air another magical girl series and say that it was better. Hikaru Shidou was my idol. So I refused to watch Sailor Moon. Then one day my best friend tricked me. She told me there was a new ep of MKR that we hadn't seen airing at a different time slot. I thought it was odd but I wasn't about to let my skepticism make me miss a new MKR episode. My hunch was right. It took me a while to figure out it wasn't MKR but it was a moment too late, I was hooked. I still remember the episode, it was when they were at the day care trying to save the little kids from being drained of their energy.  My Sailor scout was Rei. Being an Aries I was proud to say that she was my favorite. Hot headed and tough love are definitely traits I associate with."

sailormoon,3dbatc,BillyKonstantine,5,Tue Jul 14 23:03:29 2015 UTC,I can't see the difference due to the person filming their computer screen of all things. Does someone have a legit comparison I can look at?
sailormoon,3dbatc,CJtheWriter,3,Wed Jul 15 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"And this is why people stopped complaining.  All that Toei did for the HD broadcast was upscale it from their original masters (and badly IMO).  The ghosting is horrible, and the colors are not very vibrant at all. You can't really tell here, but there is also a lot of shaking for the frames as well.  I was quote surprised, as I thought Toei would use the masters they used for the R2 DVD release, but apparently not."
sailormoon,3dbatc,ClearandSweet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:51:07 2015 UTC,"If this is what Toei will use for a future Blu Ray release then go with the ViZ version. Although Toeis HD is just slightly smoother than Viz, the ghosting is SO much worse."
sailormoon,3dbatc,ClearandSweet,2,Wed Jul 15 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"From what I am lead to believe, Toei no longer has any masters without that terrible ghosting. Like, they fucked it up and they no longer exist. So when Funimation was going on about doing the best they can on the ANNcast for the NA re-releases, they weren't lying.  Shit sucks. Should get the Italian raws, or whoever has the good footage."
sailormoon,3dbatc,ClearandSweet,3,Wed Jul 15 04:31:11 2015 UTC,"It does suck .... But to be honest for an animated show that's 20 years old, the ViZ Blu Ray looks good."

sailormoon,3dbu4o,GirlUneedAShotofB12,4,Wed Jul 15 01:33:48 2015 UTC,I think any Sailor Moon fan would be excited to get a Figuart! Most of them are under $40 on Amazon.

I'd suggest browsing through the Merchandise News section of that website all those link to and I'm sure you'll find something! =D"

sailormoon,3d7wsm,reseph,9,Tue Jul 14 05:14:52 2015 UTC,I suspect they're taking a break and more episodes will follow later. I believe this because the episodes will start airing on Japanese television relatively soon. there'd be no reason for them to release new episodes online when they're premiering the new series on TV.
sailormoon,3d7wsm,jekyllcorvus,6,Tue Jul 14 12:35:08 2015 UTC,"there'd be no reason for them to release new episodes online when they're premiering the new series on TV.   THIS. I'm already sad seeing people on Tumblr and Twitter saying ""SEE?!! This is what 90s purists get for complaining about Crystal's quality, they canceled it!"" I hope the war between Original-vs-Crystal going on in other sites doesn't get worse with that rumor spreading.  They didn't cancel it. It's just a good business strategy to take a break.   It allows time for some of the S merch to start coming out and selling -- we have the Super Moon SHF coming out in October, along with the Spiral Heart Moon Rod Proplica. Wouldn't it make more sense to have these come out as Crystal's S arc kicks off? The first two arcs will air on TV. Wouldn't it make more sense to wait, so those who are discovering the show just now through broadcast TV can catch up? It gives the S musical it's time to shine, too. They might have realized that having 50+ things going on at once stretches the fandom too much. Yes, it gives them time to listen to fan feedback from the first 27 episodes.   I think it might do them well, in the long run, to wait until the winter season (December/January) for the S arc. I think that's what they're doing."
sailormoon,3d7wsm,OhHiAndie,2,Tue Jul 14 13:29:30 2015 UTC,"you exactly right. people seem to forget that when the original anime aired, they went too quickly before naoko could finish the Black Moon arc and we wound up with those aliens and the tree thing (which was the worst storyline of the series)  they also are producing a better quality animation for the blu-Ray so they've been busy with that, too.   people seem to also forget that we didn't even have a definitive answer if Crystal was even going to be made. it took them forever just to confirm the rumors and then it was pushed back.   I have the upmost faith the series will continue, as long as the blu-Rays and everything sells. which it has been and let's not even mention how expensive some of it can be!"
sailormoon,3d7wsm,jekyllcorvus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:23 2015 UTC,Which is also why Stars was so divergent from manga.

sailormoon,3d7wsm,VikingHedgehog,3,Tue Jul 14 05:58:10 2015 UTC,Noooooooooooooo!   I mean. I have no information. You are probably right. I just don't want to accept that yet. Stars is my favorite arc and I really really wanted to see it get that far!

sailormoon,3d7wsm,CJtheWriter,3,Tue Jul 14 12:03:35 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't continue, it's certainly not the fault of the people who complained. Otherwise, series with problematic animation like One Piece and Naruto wouldn't be continued either. People complain about those two more than Crystal and nothing happened with those. And besides, criticism should never be put down. I have an animation student friend who adores Crystal but isn't afraid to comment on poor storyboarding and animation flaws. She can like it but she can also be fairly critical too.  I think at this point it's about a fifty/fifty chance of it coming back. If anything killed Crystal, it was the low views toward the end and perhaps the lack of merchandise sales. All of the Petit Charas and Figuarts are based on the old series. So are many other products. It almost makes me wonder if Toei Animation was too unsure that Crystal would sell products of its own.  If Crystal does come back, I hope Toei puts a better team on it and a way bigger budget. If Stars is going to be done properly, it needs to be done right."
sailormoon,3d7wsm,SpikeRosered,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:42:54 2015 UTC,The big difference between those two shows and Crystal though was there was a strange lack of commitment for Crystal right from the beginning. Crystal didn't originally air on Japanese television whilst Naruto and One Piece had prime time spots.
sailormoon,3d7wsm,ithinkimightbegay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:14:24 2015 UTC,Whaaaat?  Are ratings low?  Why wouldn't they finish out the series?

sailormoon,3d7wsm,Hemansno1fan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:41:25 2015 UTC,Didn't Toei start Dragon Ball Super? Is that why it's ending?
sailormoon,3d7wsm,Visor2040,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:34:02 2015 UTC,I think that it is doing well enough that there will be more episodes.   Attack on Titan was widely successful and it originally premiered in 2013 and the next season won't air until next year.
sailormoon,3d6vgy,batdalek,2,Tue Jul 14 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Sailor Venus! Kind of easy to do.

As long as people know what they are getting I don't care either way to personal prefernces about real vs. fake and bootleg etc. I just don't want people to be taken advantage of.   Yes. There are fakes of these bags. LOTS and LOTS of fakes. Yes, many of the fakes are still a good quality. BUT they aren't official. They aren't licensed, so if you want to be technical about it - the appropriate artists aren't getting any cut of these. I'd just hate for people to be thinking they are getting the real thing and then be devestated when it's not. Especially for the prices some of the fakes are going for.

sailormoon,3d573b,VikingHedgehog,2,Mon Jul 13 22:01:31 2015 UTC,How can you tell if it isn't authentic?
sailormoon,3d573b,VikingHedgehog,2,Mon Jul 13 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"Little things. The stitching, material etc. On this particular bag it's the color of the inside lining is more of a periwinkle blue and the fake is more of a concentrated blue. The inside pocket has the trade mark is in the middle of the pocket, the sides are flat on the bottom so it holds the shape better, the clamps for the shoulder strap have a hole on the real ones, the pattern is flawless, the fake one could have imperfections, there's a lot of little things that give it away."
sailormoon,3d573b,Wicked_Lady,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"So my bag fits everything you've mentioned, does that mean it's a fake or is it real? Lol I'm super confused now xD  Meaning it has the holes on the strap clamps, the lining color is periwinkle blue, no imperfections in the pattern, the logo is in the right spot, it retains its shape perfectly due to the construction, it has metal detailing.   Edit again: so I am noticing some skipped stitches, hmm. Either way! I love this bag legitimate or not :)"
sailormoon,3d573b,hurting4asquirting,2,Mon Jul 13 20:46:54 2015 UTC,Well another good tell is the price and where it was shipped from but so far it sounds like it's authentic
sailormoon,3d573b,Wicked_Lady,2,Mon Jul 13 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you don't mind that it's not real and love it either way, but it's almost certaintly a fake.   Here's a really great video where you can see the differences. By your pictures your bag doens't quite have the plushness to it that the real one does. Still, you like it so that's what really matters.   Just posting this to help some people with the general confusion about these bags and the real vs. fakes ones. I was super confused about it too just a few weeks ago. I've learned a lot since then and want to share it so other people don't unwittingly pay WAY too much for a fake or in some other way become dissapointed.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-5GTZg6fT4"
sailormoon,3d573b,milenah,2,Tue Jul 14 09:51:59 2015 UTC,"Sailor Moon Collectibles posted a really great vido on youtube that compares a real and fake Luna bag. When you watch her video and see them side by side it becomes pretty obvious which is real and which is fake. The real one is a little more plush and just overall finished a little better. Not that some of the bootlegs are terrible. Some are actually very good quality. Better than something cheap you'd buy at Walmart. But still, not the quality of the real ones. OP definantly got a knock off. The price is also a HUGE indicator. These bags real are NOT $60 or less. Try a few hundred. And even some of the bags asking that price are not necessarily real. Also, having the appropriate cards and tags doesn't even mean it's real. I've seen fakes come with the printed Samantha Vega cards and everything."
sailormoon,3d573b,Wicked_Lady,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:48:33 2015 UTC,"Great, thank you so much for taking the time to thoroughly explain the differences. I really appreciate it! :3 I am looking for a legit bag as well and have been worried about purchasing a fake on accident.  Hopefully we can both find the real deal soon!"
sailormoon,3d573b,shortcandy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:13:38 2015 UTC,Yeah me too. I found a couple of listings on eBay that are exporting from Japan and I'm hoping those are the legit ones I'm just really scared to drop the money on one of them without knowing for sure
sailormoon,3d573b,hurting4asquirting,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"I think I saw the same auctions. I'd have no problem with dropping a couple/few hundred on one as long as it is in fact authentic. If you stumble across some legit ones after you acquire yours, please let me know where I can get one too. :3"

sailormoon,3d573b,sjwoah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yup! If the prices looks ""too good to be true"" it almost certaintly is. These real bags aren't cheap by most people's standards. I know a lot of people were assuming a real luna bag was like $60 some bucks and a fake like $20 some bucks. I just hate to see people taken advantage of like that. If it's $60 it's almost without a doubt a fake as well, just an overpriced one.   These all seem to be the REAL bags. I just want everybody to know what they are getting and not get taken advantage of. Also to note - as far as I know these real bags are a pretty limited run. They shouldn't be as widely available as the fakes poping up everywhere are. I don't have any real numbers but weren't they only avaialble for a short time?"

sailormoon,3d72i4,seishin17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"in the manga's dream arc, pegasus lent sailor moon and chibi moon enough power for them to achieve 'super' form. this was because at the end of the infinity arc, the outer guardians retired. without the presence of all nine sailor guardians, sailor moon was unable to call forth the holy grail. this changes by the end of the story arc when all ten guardians are reunited and lend sailor moon the power of each of their sailor crystals. this brings the holy grail back and upgrades it to the holy moon chalice. with that, she is able to transform into eternal sailor moon."
sailormoon,3d72i4,ryryguyXOXO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:03:40 2015 UTC,"That's interesting input I'd never actually heard before. So manga-wise it still kind of supports that Moon Crisis Super Sailor Moon might be a little less powerful than with the Holy Grail, but obviously still Eternal Sailor Moon is the most powerful form?"
sailormoon,3d6vvg,Emhew,2,Tue Jul 14 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"So lucky! I love the Atsumete collection, but if I were you I wouldn't stop collecting, the Petit Charas are super adorable too ;)  Edit: Wait, there's more! LOL"

sailormoon,3d6u18,marisel402,8,Mon Jul 13 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"Kind of an oddball choice, but my favorite moment is in episode 97, where Ami and Michiru race. It is so simple, but both times in the episode say a lot about Ami as a person, which I just find so fascinating."
sailormoon,3d6u18,BlazingSakura,2,Tue Jul 14 00:17:22 2015 UTC,It's a really great scene. I totally agree with you.
sailormoon,3d6u18,katechized,2,Tue Jul 14 00:25:22 2015 UTC,I love that scene too. It was really inspiring to me at the age I first saw it. I did lots of things just because I didn't want to cause a confrontation. Michiru's reaction to Ami is absolutely the best.
sailormoon,3d6u18,ShelbyFrancis,7,Wed Jul 15 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"The scene in the manga and SMCrystal where Usagi basically tells Tuxedo Mask ""wait right here babe, I got this"" before running off to fight.  I forget what episode it is exactly, but it's right before her identity as Princess Serenity is revealed.  The old anime always had her hesitating to fight and only stepping up to the line in dire circumstances, so I liked seeing scenes like that where she shows that she IS a warrior, and it's just her priorities that are in question not her ability"
sailormoon,3d6u18,leeskizz,7,Mon Jul 13 23:55:55 2015 UTC,Sailor moon not even needing the grail to transform into super sailor moon to go after sailor Saturn and help to defeat pharaoh 90. The emotion in both the English dub and original Japanese voice acting is unparalleled in any scene in my opinion.   Also usagi jumping off after Nehelenia throws chibiusa from the sky. And the resulting fall between the two of them.
sailormoon,3d6u18,hollowmoon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"My two favorite moments as well! Just unparalleled in tension and emotional impact.   On that same note I hate the final two filler episodes of Super. Uranus and Neptune fighting Sailor Moon saying she's not the real messiah... Jesus, don't get me started. They should have just cut the season short two episodes than shovel that slop onto our plates."
sailormoon,3d6u18,leeskizz,2,Tue Jul 14 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on that 100%. The moment where Sailor Moon somehow magically forces neptune to let go of her causing uranus and neptune to crash into one another felt very cheesy, but for what its worth, it was somewhat cool. Could've done without it altogether though."
sailormoon,3d6u18,mightymouse513,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:46 2015 UTC,"The fall is one of my favorites too. I bought a bootleg off eBay a while back, and I was super pissed when that disc decided to have an error right when chibi-usa gets thrown off. I can't wait for that episode to get on Hulu so I can properly watch it again."
sailormoon,3d6u18,Cocoa-Break,4,Tue Jul 14 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"My favorite scene has to be the R movie's end scene where they stop the asteroid! When Moon Revenge kicks in, awwwww man. And the little flashbacks! It's a very captivating scene to watch, and this was the first SM movie I saw as a kid, so this has a special place in my heart :)"
sailormoon,3d6u18,emeraldlights,2,Tue Jul 14 07:07:04 2015 UTC,This one for me too. Sailor moon's voice right before the crystal shatters gives me goosebumps everytime...brb going to watch it right now!

sailormoon,3d292y,SailorSpaghetti,19,Sun Jul 12 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"I bought this puzzle while in Japan.  The box came with a little paper you could fill out and mail in to get a missing piece sent to you, but the offer expired in January.  My husband is going to try writing an email to the company, but I doubt that will accomplish anything.  I think I've decided to just print a scaled copy of the image, trace the outline of the missing section, cut it out, and stick it in the empty space.  It won't look the same, but it will at least look less jarring, especially when viewed from afar  (my plan is to frame and hang it).  It's really a beautiful puzzle.  The pieces are like stained glass."
sailormoon,3d292y,Digitalwings,11,Sun Jul 12 23:04:50 2015 UTC,"If there is a way to contact the company, take a picture, write a letter asking for this missing piece (in which ever language is your native tongue), and wait for them to send it.  Most puzzle makers understand the potential for a lost or missing piece and will usually replace it. Even if its long after you bought the puzzle and the nth time putting it together.  How big/how many pieces was that puzzle?"

What's the date on the postcard? I just finished a different puzzle by the same company (luckily no missing pieces), remembered this thread, and checked the postcard that came with mine. The date stamped on the card is the date the puzzle was manufactured. You have until 1 year after that date to send in for a new piece. After that, they can't guarantee availability. I'm not sure if they'll ship overseas (I doubt it), but if not and you want that piece (and it's been less than a year since the puzzle was manufactured), I can act as a middle-man as I live in Hiroshima. PM me if you're interested!"

Beautiful puzzle! Sucks you have to replace that one piece!"
sailormoon,3d292y,RaeLynnShikure,3,Mon Jul 13 12:13:40 2015 UTC,"If the company won't go good for the piece, what I've done in the past is cut a new one out of the box the puzzle came in to get a good color match. It's not a perfect solution but it works in a pinch."

sailormoon,3cym18,katechized,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:34:38 2015 UTC,You'd never know it wasn't the prop Luna they used in PGSM. >.>
sailormoon,3cym18,katechized,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:58:23 2015 UTC,"Saw lots of these at a convention a couple months ago, so I don't think so. Still a nice addition to both my stuffed animal and my Sailor Moon collection."

sailormoon,3cygdd,RaeLynnShikure,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:03:38 2015 UTC,What did you use to stick down Luna P? The little bugger is constantly rolling away on mine. :(
sailormoon,3cygdd,RaeLynnShikure,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"I used a small piece of sticky tac - they sell it in the stationary aisle of most department stores, or you can find it at Staples. It's the same stuff I use in doll heads to hold eyes in (resin and vinyl) - it's oil-free, so as long as you get the white kind and not the blue, it won't stain or damage the plastic (blue has dyes that can leech into the figures over time)."
sailormoon,3cy5q6,heart-station,3,Sat Jul 11 21:01:32 2015 UTC,Simply lovely.
sailormoon,3cxy47,OhHiGCHQ,4,Sat Jul 11 19:54:02 2015 UTC,Sailor Big Mac. Makes me think of something completely different.
sailormoon,3cxy47,katechized,2,Sat Jul 11 21:53:39 2015 UTC,The best part was how the music was a soundalike of the Japanese Moon Prism Power theme.  Based Ingram.

sailormoon,3cxy47,Spookychilies,0,Sun Jul 12 00:02:36 2015 UTC,What episode is this from?
sailormoon,3cxy47,Blue_Yoshi2015,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:58:09 2015 UTC,The very latest one: the season finale. Go to /r/mylittlepony and there's a link in the sidebar.

sailormoon,3czj7e,SoSoSoulGlo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:50:52 2015 UTC,"They had too many people sign up, and started looking for a new venue. I don't know what's going on with that anymore. Besides, 8/15 is the epic lightsaber battle, so I'll be doing that instead. hah"
sailormoon,3cwo79,pikachuman,7,Sat Jul 11 12:32:24 2015 UTC,I thought it was pretty good. I didn't realize Crystal would get dubbed so quickly.
sailormoon,3cwo79,Aqito,3,Sat Jul 11 16:32:18 2015 UTC,"Oh cool! It looks like it's the same cast as in the re-dub of the old anime, which I've really enjoyed so far! :) I think I remember that being announced way back when, but I'm excited to see them take on Crystal!"
sailormoon,3cwo79,Glitzville,4,Sat Jul 11 20:54:11 2015 UTC,I really don't like this lol
sailormoon,3cwo79,hurting4asquirting,4,Sat Jul 11 22:05:49 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one. I really can't stand Usagi's voice, but maybe that's because I'm so attached to the original."
sailormoon,3cwo79,Noble_Panda,6,Sat Jul 11 22:12:37 2015 UTC,Yeah that's probably what it is for me. I feel like this voice actor is over the top and too childish
sailormoon,3cwo79,hurting4asquirting,3,Sun Jul 12 03:26:43 2015 UTC,I'm kinda attached to it too but there's just something about her voice that literally makes me grind my teeth when I hear it. They showed us an episode of the re-dub last year at NY Comic Con and I just walked out because it irritated me so much.
sailormoon,3cwo79,the_mixtape,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:46:02 2015 UTC,I'm just not a fan of english dubs in general. It's just clunky and not quite right.
sailormoon,3cwo79,DevoutandHeretical,2,Sat Jul 11 23:48:24 2015 UTC,Any idea when it'll be released?
sailormoon,3cwo79,chknqwn,3,Sat Jul 11 21:35:44 2015 UTC,That actually wasn't as painful as I thought it'd be.
sailormoon,3cwo79,MiniGoober,4,Sat Jul 11 16:06:22 2015 UTC,Huh. Not bad at all. The out-loud thoughts while she was holding Luna was kind of clunky but I could stand do hear how they do the other sailors.  Hearing her say otaku was kinda strange. I love that we just assume everyone who might be watching knows what that is. :3
sailormoon,3cwo79,katechized,2,Sat Jul 11 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"The otaku mention reminded me of when I watched Haruhi Suzumiya for the first time in English, and she said the word ""moe"". Definitely kinda weird to just say it like that."
sailormoon,3cwo79,mikachuu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:34:58 2015 UTC,They do it in Madoka too. It's jarring. O.O
sailormoon,3cwo79,katechized,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound bad to me ,I'm not a purist and I find the DIC/cloverway dubs really dated sounding compared to modern dubs ."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,jillymoeers,12,Sat Jul 11 09:13:58 2015 UTC,"Lycentia's graphic website. I'm pretty sure I checked it weekly for updates for a while there. I couldn't find anything for it when I went looking today, but there's a web archive of it."

sailormoon,3cwbwd,katechized,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"It's a small world, I guess! I'm on  MahouMUSH ( www.mahoumush.com )  (which is, as it sounds, about Mahou Shoujo in general more than just Sailor Moon) and I've played other places in the past."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,Iceciro,3,Sun Jul 12 22:02:29 2015 UTC,"Awww, I had a fansite on Angelfire! I think it might actually still be there!"
sailormoon,3cwbwd,rainbowblight,2,Sat Jul 11 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"I made a fan site too! Mine was on tripod though, so it's no longer alive."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,katechized,2,Sat Jul 11 15:05:14 2015 UTC,Have you checked the wayback machine for an archived copy?
sailormoon,3cwbwd,rainbowblight,2,Sun Jul 12 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"I did! I've noticed they don't have a lot of saves from before 2000 though, so it makes sense it's not there."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,katechized,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:04:10 2015 UTC,"Awww, I'm sorry that all your hard work was lost to the abyss.  I've heard that some scholars are actually nervous that most of our data is housed online these days.  If we experience another dark age (somewhere, somehow), it's likely that a majority of our recent history would be completely lost. :o"
sailormoon,3cwbwd,rainbowblight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:40:44 2015 UTC,I decided to try my hand at the sailor moon quiz on your fansite - it's really hard! ( ﾟдﾟ)

Hehe  In Brazil, there were some chat rooms dedicated to anime and movies, and I spent so much time on the Sailor Moon chatroom, rping with the people there. One of my dearest friends I met there. :) Those were the days..."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,andre_bluesman,3,Sat Jul 11 20:29:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely yes! A friend of mine and I ran a fansite for a little while. She did all the work and I wrote terrible fanfiction."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,totallyarogue,2,Sat Jul 11 20:53:06 2015 UTC,"I definitely remember those early Internet sites. I was about 9 or 10 when the Internet became a household tool in my Canadian hometown (ol' 28 dialup). Some of the sites I visited had all of this information from the Manga and the original Japanese anime that was mind blowing to me. The formating of those old sites was so archaic too, but they were always loaded with pictures!"

sailormoon,3cwbwd,ebEliminator,2,Sun Jul 12 00:04:52 2015 UTC,"Geocities and Angelfire, those were the days. I spent a lot of time on a site called SailorMoonChat, I even made my own site although it was kind of crummy and I didn't know much about HTML. There were so many good sites in those days."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,dal_segno,2,Sat Jul 11 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"I totally had sites on Geocities and Angelfire. Was in all sorts of web rings, too (damn, I'd completely forgotten that those were even a thing until now).  I browsed the hell out of any Sailor Moon gif/midi/wav collection site I could find, and even auditioned for a couple of fan dubs (yeah...good luck with that, 11-year-old me)."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,SlugHeart,2,Sun Jul 12 00:52:58 2015 UTC,"I had a few gurrlpages sites, lol! I used to save sailor moon images on floppy disks, I had a disk for each scout, haha"
sailormoon,3cwbwd,cipher_six,2,Sun Jul 12 06:39:57 2015 UTC,"Yes! Miss Haruna's Homeroom was my destination for clips, especially unreleased stuff in Japanese. Castle in the Sky: Sailor Moon was where I read summaries with screencaps of all of the episodes. There was also the Anipike full of stuff. ASMR was where I found Lianne Sentar and Jen Wand, masters of SM fanfiction. Of course I had my own pages at GeoCities, FortuneCity, Xoom, etc and wrote bad fanfic (Sailor Antique was me).  Definitely a fun time to be online."
sailormoon,3cwbwd,LollerskateDJ,2,Sun Jul 12 08:20:01 2015 UTC,"I never really got to use them, being a kid with dial up and a mother always on the phone, but I did spend a lot of time on SMUncensored.
