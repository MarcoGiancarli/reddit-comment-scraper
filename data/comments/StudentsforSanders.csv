StudentsforSanders,3dxyl3,pplswar,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:27 2015 UTC,"My home state is New York. As an entering freshman in college, I researched for months if it was possible for me to register in Virginia, where i'm going to school. i feel i would have a larger impact in VA than NY. unfortunately, it seemed like if i registered in VA my parents would lose me as a dependent on their tax forms (costing them thousands), which is not an option. it also seems as if registering as a student in what is basically a temporary home would have become a huge headache with paperwork and communications, so in the end i registered in NY. not the outcome i hoped for, and sorry to break the bad news (from my own experience)"
StudentsforSanders,3dxyl3,netflixncuddles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:12 2015 UTC,"I think for college kids it's more important to vote where you feel like you truly live. It's a more accurate representation of voters for the area, and depending on the election ballet or voting day, affects what and who you are voting for.  I understand the desire to make your vote most effective, but voting where your heart lives is the only moral way, since doing otherwise is a form of voter fraud ethically if not legally.  In fact, depending on the state, there may be only one option either way for voting purposes as to not commit voter fraud, which needs to be the decision maker.  When I was in college, I knew my heart was in my dorm, and I knew I would choose to live in the same area after school was done, so I didn't vote where my parents resided which I used for permanent mail, but did not consider my permanent residence (although on paper it was for legal reasons, which did not go against voting rules for my state).  When I did national school exchange in a different state, I did an absentee ballet, even though my mail and residence and work was in a different state, but I knew I was returning.  SHORT ANSWER: Check state laws and vote accordingly, but if either is an option... go for gut/home."

StudentsforSanders,3dbgfp,DO_NOT_TIP_ME,2,Wed Jul 15 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that the moneybomb's important. Currently, the /r/SandersForPresident mods are entirely focused on the moneybomb, and will start emphasizing the July 29th events (and Bernie2016 events) afterwords.   I am not in the position to donate currently, so I have been largely ignoring the moneybomb, probably against my better judgement. Thanks for mentioning it, though."
StudentsforSanders,3dbgfp,DO_NOT_TIP_ME,2,Wed Jul 15 00:16:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly,   The moneybomb isn't just about the money. Sanders has made that clear. He knows he won't be able to receive as much funding as Clinton and the other candidates. This is about spreading the word. Many students would probably agree with Bernie's ideas and values, it's just that they haven't heard of him. The moneybomb is our chance to Sanders known to students across the nation."

StudentsforSanders,3dbgfp,n01sytz,2,Wed Jul 15 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"One major problem is the voting rates for young people (aged 18-24). In the 2012 election, only 38% of 18-24 year olds voted. If we can bring that number closer to 45-50%, I think we can truly make a change. But young voters aren't usually involved in politics. I believe that if we can spread the word about Sanders, they may be motivated just enough to go vote."
StudentsforSanders,3dbgfp,DO_NOT_TIP_ME,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:41:28 2015 UTC,Another major problem is that the younger voters don't have the money to contribute in the same way that people who have graduated college with careers etc can contribute.

StudentsforSanders,3d0yf2,availableoregon,2,Sun Jul 12 18:18:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I'm a regular attendee at the Ann Arbor Sanders group meetings and have been to the state-wide ones a couple of times.  I have an idea (this will require some networking) wherein all the campuses with a Sanders group will (at the same time) hold a protest/rally at the center of campus or where there is the most foot traffic on campus. Though it could just start with 20-50 people gathering on each campus, these things get around quickly what with Yik-Yak and curious people wanting to see what's going on or wanting to get involved. The crowd could quickly grow to hundreds at each campus within hours.  State and local-level media are always incredibly desperate for stories. If we were to get a gathering of people to come out at UofM, MSU, GVSU, etc on their respective campuses at the same time across the state, they would eat it up."
StudentsforSanders,3d0yf2,availableoregon,2,Sun Jul 12 18:45:07 2015 UTC,Yik-Yak   Brilliant idea. I didn't even think about that app.
StudentsforSanders,3d0yf2,Ian1732,2,Sun Jul 12 22:10:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely!   However to note- talking politics itself on there is a little toxic and counter-productive. However, if you want to draw attention to something going on campus you can have a few posters talk about something different going on somewhere on the campus and it'll start drawing attention to people otherwise not interested. Like the protests over David Brandon and Hoke was fueled by social media and interest was piqued through Yik-Yak. The whole page was nothing but that for a day!  Yik-Yak is kind of the skeleton in my closet, so this is how I know these things. I would write one-liners that I thought of but once I got enough Yak karma it turned into a social experiment (if you can't tell, I'm PoliSci) for me where I would see what's effective. 130,000 Yak-karma later.... you get the picture, hah!"
StudentsforSanders,3d0yf2,Nickxk,2,Mon Jul 13 03:34:38 2015 UTC,Yik-Yak is kind of the skeleton in my closet   I choked on the water I was drinking.
StudentsforSanders,3d0yf2,nvne,2,Mon Jul 13 03:38:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose if there is a skeleton in the closet to have, something as benign as Yik-Yak isn't so bad. I did get a flag out of it and a bunch of free stuff as well when I walked up to their booth and showed them my score.  Anyways, the thing about Yik-Yak is that it is very immediate in its scope and reaches people you otherwise normally wouldn't. The issue with having your friends convert to Bernie Sanders is that they're the easy ones to get interested as they have an investment in your life and (likely) probably have very same political views as you.  If you go ""Hey, there's some cool shit happening on the Diag"" (posing as someone not affiliated with the event) you can draw attention to people who may otherwise not even bother thinking about going. People love the controversy or the idea of running down to a developing situation on campus!"

If you do, I think you can check the status of your voter registration online in New York State.  This site has more information.  As does this site.

I'd advise you create the social media pages now, and then start organizing this fall.  Looks like you should have registered by May 1st to create an official student organization, but it doesn't matter. Organize an ""informal"" one if necessary.  For campaign materials, instructions on how to hold meetings, tips on how to canvass, and a link to a free Bernie bumper sticker, be sure to check out the Grassroots Organizing Guide, which should  provide all the information you'll need.

It's real important to remember that while we all have our own personal set of views and values, that this campaign is about Bernie and everybody has a different reason for voting for him. Try hard not to be divisive and negative, but instead positive and receptive. People love to talk about their own opinions and ideas, and especially if we want to win an election, this might mean certain opinions contrary to your own.

Hosting it at a high school like this one would be a great idea in my opinion as it would encourage young people to hear him talk and form an opinion on what they hear, while also allowing for eligible voters in my primarily red area to make a big showing in such a crucial battleground state."

We don't need the best idea, or the most effective idea, or the most cost-effective idea. It's like exercise: you could have the best workout video ever but as long as you never watch it, it's worthless."
StudentsforSanders,38wu7a,pplswar,2,Mon Jun 8 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course. But, you cannot take actions without ideas. Any high school student can refer to this thread for possible actions to undertake."
StudentsforSanders,38usey,pplswar,3,Sun Jun 7 00:29:08 2015 UTC,"I was surprised (pleasantly) by the cheers he received at the mention of Bernie Sanders. Reminds me of meeting up with some friends today, politics came up and they all already knew (and liked) Bernie Sanders, if we; the generation of the internet, can just move our support to the real world, we can achieve great things, by only being active on the internet we isolate ourselves."
StudentsforSanders,38usey,dftba-ftw,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"There was definitely a very loud, very vocal minority there; everyone else seemed jarred/stunned, but not hostile."

You guys are the most organized state specific grassroots campaign and subreddit I have seen! Keep up the good work.  Here's a list of campaign materials you may find useful.

I set up a Facebook page and we're being processed by student administration, and likely to get accepted in the next few days!"
StudentsforSanders,38t41x,Nickxk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:47:08 2015 UTC,What is the name of your facebook page? I would love to join
StudentsforSanders,38t41x,availableoregon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:05:17 2015 UTC,Are you still wanting to start a Sanders group this fall at Michigan?
StudentsforSanders,38ov6o,pplswar,2,Fri Jun 5 16:57:01 2015 UTC,Get 10 people to know about him and get 10 more to vote at the primaries.
StudentsforSanders,38ov6o,sesstreets,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:01:17 2015 UTC,"This is good. Bernie needs to outreach to minority voters, especially blacks, if he wants to win the Democratic Nomination. I think he can pull them away from Hillary with proposals like these, and reminding everyone of his SNCC activism."
StudentsforSanders,38h121,Cheesus_Crust666,2,Thu Jun 4 03:51:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I can vote, I am an Illinois resident, but when the primary happens I will be living  in Michigan ( for several months at that point). So am I just screwed?"
StudentsforSanders,38h121,dftba-ftw,2,Thu Jun 4 12:10:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Illinois and Michigan law specifically, you'll have to look it up, but most states (where voting rights aren't under complete attack) have led requesting you to register where you ""consider to be your home."" I think you're good registering almost any state of you have an address there. Most of the time problems only arise when you are registered in two separate states simultaneously, which is also the thing voting laws are suppose to be protecting against mainly."

StudentsforSanders,38c25m,silentstawk,3,Wed Jun 3 06:38:17 2015 UTC,"I think that Bernie's campaign shouldn't be treated as a revolution. It makes us seem like extremists, and turns off political moderates. I think this type of rhetoric would hurt us in the general election.  I think that creating a progressive movement that extends beyond Sanders, and organizes and campaigns for statehouse races, house elections, senate elections, and governorships would be great, but organizing million man marches seems like an extremely inefficient way to get legislation that we like passed."
StudentsforSanders,38c25m,availableoregon,6,Thu Jun 4 00:27:22 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying but I think the term ""political revolution"" is pretty central to Bernie's campaign motif. Maybe if we leverage that concept we can actually make a positive impact on voter turnout for young people and that would go a long way for all the elections you mentioned. It seems like a win-win."
StudentsforSanders,38c25m,funkalunatic,2,Thu Jun 4 02:43:31 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, Bernie has pretty much said that we're going to need to march on Washington to get Congress to capitulate if he's elected. And he has T-shirts that say ""Join the revolution today"" or some such"

StudentsforSanders,36indg,revolutionaryds,3,Tue May 19 17:47:50 2015 UTC,"Once again this man does something that many politicians avoid, he speaks the truth. Yes this is an expensive plan; and balancing these expenditures is detrimental to its success, especially as we recover from the 2008 recession. We cannot have economic growth without first achieving a balanced budget.  I also love that he pointed out that the estimate is not 100%. Many politicians tote plans that claim to spur the economy, and create thousands of jobs; yet these same politicians consistently fail to remind the public that these figures are not set in stone."
StudentsforSanders,36k592,samalterman,2,Tue May 19 23:53:37 2015 UTC,The /r/SandersForPresident page has subreddits for all 50 states. I think it might make more sense to have students look for/join up with existing efforts in those subreddits than try to sort that out here (we are still a rather small sub). But I could be wrong. Thoughts?
StudentsforSanders,36k592,revolutionaryds,2,Wed May 20 03:46:44 2015 UTC,"That makes sense for now.  However, as students we are part of Bernie's key demographic (he really needs the youth vote to have any chance of winning) so it might make sense to have our own list as well.  Teens in these key states are probably more likely to listen to us than ""real adults""."
StudentsforSanders,36k592,taygo0o,3,Wed May 20 04:13:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like students seeing an organization for students may be more receptive to joining the effort as well. I think it'd be awesome to have some sort of closed facebook group type thing that students could join and link up with others in their area, if only to find someone in a similar age demographic to go volunteer with."
StudentsforSanders,36k592,revolutionaryds,1 point,Wed May 20 09:05:34 2015 UTC,"There is a Students for Sanders FB page we (meaning this reddit) are trying to link up with, but a closed group would be good too."
StudentsforSanders,36ht4z,PublicServant42,4,Tue May 19 14:18:02 2015 UTC,"Heyo from Appalachian State, I'm all about helping start a massive student thing. I've been looking around online for things that can be handed out, such as informative pamphlets that can be stapled to stickers, but I can't find anything. Do you have any resources?   Also, here's a great table on preliminary voting that I kinda don't understand: https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/347kp9/you_want_sanders_but_will_you_be_able_to_vote_for/"
StudentsforSanders,36ht4z,poodooloo,3,Tue May 19 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"Two resources that I do have are: The People for Bernie is organizing a lot of meet ups around the nation and have provided a google drive full of useful stuff for people just starting out.  Women for Bernie Sanders has also put together a list of not only all the events that they could find related to Bernie Sanders, but also all the organizations/groups doing stuff about Bernie Sanders. It's found here in an editable google drive  and here in a view only google drive  Okay, so what don't you understand about that? Maybe I can help answer whatever questions you have?  I looked at North Carolina's information. It is kind of unusual. It sounds like people, when they register to vote, can choose to register for a party. If you register as part of a political party, you can only vote in that primary.  If you don't register as part of any party, you can vote in whatever party's primary that you choose."

The Mods here do not actually control the Students For Sanders Twitter handle (which was created a few days before us). We would very much like to collaborate with the Twitter handle, and we're working on contacting them.  This subreddit is still under construction, and we're still gathering resources and people, but it's great to know you guys over at Facebook are willing to partner with us.
