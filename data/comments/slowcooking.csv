slowcooking,3dyayl,Videttab,36,Mon Jul 20 15:03:23 2015 UTC,"How do you not get much liquid after 8 hours in the slow cooker (pic 17)? I always end up with about a third of the crockpot filled with liquid, and the ribs end up more like boiled meat."
slowcooking,3dyayl,xjmdmj,7,Mon Jul 20 18:12:22 2015 UTC,"There was a decent amount of juices in the bottom. I had to go back and look at pic 17 and it does sort of disguise how much liquid there in fact was. I would say the entire bottom rib was mostly submerged in liquid.  I ate that one (as I didn't want any family members getting to that one) and honestly I couldn't tell the difference in texture or taste compared to the other 3 half slabs.   Also, I think broiling them quickly evaporates any H2O moisture near the outsides of the ribs which just leaves you with the succulent pork juices remaining."
slowcooking,3dyayl,smacksaw,14,Mon Jul 20 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"I layer them sideways. If I add any liquid at all it's liquid smoke.  I do them on high for 4-6 hours, but leave them 24.  I don't do like OP. No BBQ sauce at all, just rub. And I don't bother broiling them. I just brush them with BBQ and leave them in the warming cycle for at least 30 minutes.  Eventually the liquid will mostly evaporate. I sometimes need to add it.  Also you might try propping the lid ajar slightly. The seal could be too tight. You also may have too many ribs for your pot, which is why there's the longer cook time. If you have liquid, cook it again.  I'm about to put some ribs in right now.  We'll have them tomorrow night, 25+ hours from now."
slowcooking,3dyayl,Teflon-Viking,10,Mon Jul 20 20:53:49 2015 UTC,Do you leave them in the crockpot for 24hrs on warm or you turn it off?

Cut slab(s) of ribs in half. Rub down both sides with spice rub. Layer into slow cooker placing BBQ sauce in between each half slab of ribs. Cook for 8-10 hours on low setting (I only cooked them 8 hours and they were perfect). Carefully remove from slow cooker and place the ribs onto a baking sheet.

I also make a beef Rogan Josh, and I'll see how I go with butter chicken and Tikka masala at some point too.   Here's a photo of my freezer bags: https://instagram.com/p/2cyLZznOzy/"
slowcooking,3dxifd,canibuyatrowel,7,Mon Jul 20 23:17:38 2015 UTC,"has anyone had any luck putting these in frozen?  I leave the house at 7:00 and get home at 6:00, so many of these ""6-8 hours"" won't work for me.   I have a newer model so I can tell it to only cook for 6 hours, but then it's on warm for 5 hours..."
slowcooking,3dxifd,pushad,3,Mon Jul 20 14:20:42 2015 UTC,Really depends what you're cooking.  Root vegetables + tougher meat cuts (not chicken) will do fine at 12 hours at low.  Softer veggies and chicken will turn to mush.  Experiment a bit!
slowcooking,3dxifd,theevilmidnightbombr,5,Mon Jul 20 17:49:32 2015 UTC,Could you get one of those light timer plugs? I've never used one but see them recommended all the time - apparently you can set it to turn on at a specific time of day.
slowcooking,3dxifd,FuckImOnRedditAgain,4,Mon Jul 20 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with the newer models is they need to be programmed once turned on. When it turns on, you pick the time and heat.   So unfortunately this doesn't work :("
slowcooking,3dxifd,theevilmidnightbombr,3,Mon Jul 20 15:50:57 2015 UTC,"I think he means the timers that plug into the wall, so it kills the power completely at a certain time."
slowcooking,3dxifd,canibuyatrowel,9,Mon Jul 20 16:20:09 2015 UTC,So instead of on warm for 5 hours its just sitting on the counter for five hours.   I would not recommend course of action.
slowcooking,3dxifd,pmf1985,20,Mon Jul 20 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"Nor would I, just looked there was confusion happening above.  Me training the cat to operate the slow cooker is also proving to be fruitless. I try to show her how, saying ""Mittens, this is the start button"", but she just stares at my finger, waiting for god knows what. I say ""Mittens, imagine a world beyond the tip of my finger, think of the possibilities that await you!"" ...As she cleans herself, I stare defeated at my still-frozen chili."""
slowcooking,3dxifd,tsterTV,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"No, I was saying that I thought there existed a separate device that you could program to start at, say, 1pm if the recipe takes 5 hours and you'll be home at 6. I've seen something like this recommended when these subjects come up, and I thought it was called a light timer, but I hadn't realized they wouldn't work with the newer models of crock pots. You'd think these newer models would have a programmable start time setting built in, if they won't work with the older ""hack."" I wouldn't recommend leaving a cooked meal sitting on the counter for hours, either!"
slowcooking,3dxifd,CherryDaBomb,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:55 2015 UTC,"Again.... food safety is still a concern here, because slow cookers heat up so slowly.

slowcooking,3dxifd,caspian56,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"I have a question about this too, not in regards to timing but more putting it in frozen. Once I did this and forgot to defrost the bag first and couldn't get it in frozen because it was a big 'ol rectangle!! Has anyone forgotten to defrost, and if so how do you get the stuff in the cooker? Put underwater for a few minutes until it is soft enough to shove in there?"
slowcooking,3dxifd,kay_money,4,Mon Jul 20 15:50:21 2015 UTC,"Different answer, but maybe before you freeze you could put the Ziploc your food is in, inside a Tupperware which would fit inside your slow cooker. Then once it's frozen, you remove the Tupperware and you have a nice square frozen package that you know will fit inside. Only works if you have a big freezer, cuz I imagine that would take up a lot more space."
slowcooking,3dxifd,VROF,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:15 2015 UTC,"I usually run it under hot water for about 10 minutes with the water hitting the middle of the bag. That way the ice thaws enough I can ""break"" it in half and fit it in my crockpot."
slowcooking,3dxifd,reol7x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:58 2015 UTC,I had the same problem. Now instead of putting the bags flat on their side in the freezer I keep them upright (open end up) so everything sinks to the bottom and makes more of a cylinder/log shape that does fit in my crockpot.

slowcooking,3dz8lr,Ekozy,3,Tue Jul 21 08:14:48 2015 UTC,"Recipes with real tomatoes need adjustment. If there's any call for water, forget it! You can add it later, but you have to boil off too much. Defeats the purpose of one pot.  The #1 most important ingredient is corn/masa flour/harina. It serves two purposes: one, it's like flour as a thickener. But two, it binds your grease.   In chili, all of the flavour is in that orange coloured fat. All of the spices are there. If you were making gravy, it would be the pan drippings. It kills me to see people skim that off or use overly lean meat. Masa harina thickens the chili and binds the water and fat. It's really a magical dust.  If you have too much water, try not adding any and letting the tomatoes do the work and then learn to adjust as needed. If you have water and oil, add masa. Add it regardless, but you don't want to add half a bag of it. When it tastes like a wet corn tortilla that means you've gone too far."
slowcooking,3dz8lr,thehumble_One,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:13:15 2015 UTC,"I've only ever used chopped tomatoes, and have tried not adding water but still ended up with a lot - I suppose from the veg/meat etc.  Masa harina is corn flour, right? Sounds ideal as I brown the mince/sear the beef in oil beforehand. They must carry over some level of oil. I'll have to get a box and see how it goes. Thanks!"
slowcooking,3dz8lr,ss0889,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:15 2015 UTC,"Are you using pre-cooked beans or canned?   As dried beans cook they absorb moisture and thicken the sauce.  Canned and pre-cooked have already absorbed a ton of moisture.   Also, how long are you cooking?   I usually add a 1/4 cup of dried red/brown lentils to a 4 qt chili for a 4-6 hour low temp cook when using pre-cooked or canned beans.  They absorb a lot of moisture and flavor and add protein."
slowcooking,3dz8lr,LucyDelMonte,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"Canned, for the most part. I could get beans and soak them but I've never done it before so would be worried about getting it wrong...that's a good point though, I hadn't considered that would be the difference.  I'm cooking for 7-9 hours, depending on how organised I am in the morning. I don't have a high/low option from what I can tell. Lentils are a great idea, I should've thought of that today.

slowcooking,3dx2av,NineteenthJester,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:33 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a tried and true recipe. I've kind of perfected my own in my head based on other slow cooker lasagna recipes I've found online.   Typically, I use a combo of ground pork and mild Italian sausage cooked with onion, garlic and seasonings, then I mix in tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes and a little tomato paste and cook it down for a bit. That's the sauce layer.   For the cheese layer, I mix cottage cheese with shredded mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese and some thawed frozen spinach.   For noodles, I use regular lasagna noodles. I don't recommend using the ""no boil"" noodles because they get mushy. Regular noodles are just fine and will definitely soften. Feel free to break up the noodles to get them to fit, too. Sometimes I'll even double up on noodles for each noodle layer.   Start with sauce on the bottom layer, otherwise the noodles will be really stuck on to the crock. Top layer should be the sauce mixture with maybe some extra shredded Parmesan cheese.   It's usually better the next day after it's been refrigerated and the layers kind of set up firmer. It makes a lot and I would recommend using a larger size slow cooker.  TL;DR - I believe this is the recipe I used as a base, but I make a lot of ingredient modifications to suit my own tastes."

The bottom of the ceramic pot had cracked and sauce was leaking out on to the burner and oozing everywhere.

Think of it this way: would you eat raw meat that someone left out on a warm day for 10 hours?  Hopefully not.  That way lies food poisoning.   Cooking kills bacteria.  Warming does not.  Even if we had brought that meat up to temp, by that time it was surely full of bacterial waste products -- toxins.  Cooking food that has spoiled won't unspoil it.  In essence,  it's safer to eat raw beef straight from the fridge than a pot roast that was never cooked and merely kept warm."

However nobody had ever taught me the difference between a clove and head of garlic. I thought a clove was a head, and the recipe called for 3 cloves. I chopped up and put in two heads before I thought ""thats a lot! Ill just do two..."" This is when my husband walks up and looks in the crock pot and says ""Did you put corn in this?"" Then we went shopping at best buy while it cooked.  You could smell the garlic on me. I radiated it, I had to apologize to the lady selling me a cell phone. It was terrible. Several hours later we got home and the smell in the house almost knocked us down when we opened the door. It was just god awful. At that point I had realized my mistake and went on facebook for help. Now we were young and broke so we were very hesitant to let all this chili go to waste. Someone on facebook told me that if you make chili too spicy you can stir in peanut butter to cut the heat. So I tried it and it did cut some of the garlic flavor...  So we ate it. We got some nachos out and ate each bite on a nacho to try and mask the peanut buttery garlicky flavor. It was pretty bad. Then we both had the runs for like a day and a half. I didnt save the leftovers.  And thats how I learned what a clove of garlic was."

slowcooking,3dvt2u,tourdefranz,4,Sun Jul 19 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"Recipe since I fell asleep in a food coma after posting-  Ingredients:  3-4lb bone in country style pork ribs  1tbs vegetable oil  1tbs minced garlic  ~16oz stock made from rib bones (simmer in stock pot for 3-4 hours with your choice seasoning, I used dried minced onion and rosemary)  2-3 sprigs fresh whole rosemary  5-6 sprigs fresh whole thyme  A squirt or two Italian dressing   5-6 whole red potatoes (enough to prop up ribs in your slow cooker, I used 6 medium sized ones for my 3qt cooker)  AP flour as needed  Salt and black pepper to taste  Sear the ribs on a pan set to high heat on all sides, this will lock in the juices and give you great flavor during slow cooking. Dat Maillard reaction. Set the ribs on top of the potatoes, divide each layer of ribs with rosemary and thyme. Salt and pepper each layer of ribs.  Fill bottom of crock with stock until potatoes are completely covered and the first layer of ribs has about a quarter inch of stock covering. I had some zesty Italian dressing that needed used so I squirted that down below the ribs.  Put some stock in your pan while it's still hot to deglaze the delicious fond from the pan on medium heat, add tasty liquid to slow cooker on top of the ribs. The bottom layer of ribs should be mostly covered in liquid now.  Place your crock covered in the cooker and set to low for 6-8 hours.  When the time is up, remove ribs with wide tongs or a turner as they'll want to fall apart with ease. Potatoes should pass the toothpick test too. Set ribs and potatoes aside for now.  Strain all liquid from crock into a saucepan, set to medium-high heat until a rolling boil forms. Reduce the liquid to the consistency you like, I wanted more of a gravy-like sauce so I added some flour as it cooked until it was thick.  Plate ribs and potatoes, spoon gravy over everything and garnish with smacked thyme if you want to be fancy."

slowcooking,3duxwd,claire22bahr,16,Sun Jul 19 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"Never cook pasta or rice in a crock pot -- it'll turn into mush.  Safest bet is to cook the rice/noodles separately, then serve the contents of the crockpot over the rice/noodles.  Plus it freezes and reheats better separately.  I tend to make big batches of stuff in the crockpot and freeze most of it, then make small amounts of noodles or rice just for that serving, so they're fresh.  Ground beef/turkey, I generally brown it in a pan first on high heat, and I don't worry too much about whether it's cooked all the way through. It gives it more firmness so it won't come apart with long cooking times.  I've never had good luck with chicken, so I tend to boil it outside the crockpot, then dice it and throw it in for the last hour or so.  I've tried shredding chicken and adding it, but it tends to turn out tough.  The hearty vegetables tend to work best -- bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, celery, carrots, and so on.  Potatoes work great too.  You can cook all of these them first, but I generally don't bother.    Never do shrimp in a crock pot -- buying frozen pre-cooked/peeled/veined shrimp and tossing them in for the last 15 minutes works fine though.  I do that when I make cajun food.  Cheap cuts of pork or beef work great of course.  Don't use good cuts of meat as they tend to get tough.  If you like cajun type flavors, those pre-cooked aidell's andouille sausage adds great flavor and they hold up well. I just slice em up and toss em in.    I've not tried raw sausage, but my instinct would be to brown them first, just like ground beef.  I tend to add my spices and garlic later on  in the cooking process (say 1 hour before finish), as they can get ""earthy"" if you leave them in there cooking for 8 hours.  Jalapeños can work at any time, but I tend to throw them in with the spices, for the same reason.  Strong flavorful spices tend to work best -- Most crockpot stuff turns out very... umami?  So delicate spices tend to get overpowered by the meat and vegetables."

slowcooking,3duxwd,gooseliquor,3,Mon Jul 20 00:09:44 2015 UTC,"Couple things.   Most ground meat releases a lot of liquid during cooking. Cooking it prior and draining off any excess fat or liquid does wonders. Using canned veggies? Did you drain them? I never use any packing liquid for canned goods, but I normally avoid them altogether. Water + onions -> chilli. You lost me there. Most chilli will have a tomato base. If you're using canned this is one of the times it's okay to use the packing liquid, although on their own tomatoes contain a significant amount of water. You want flavor in your food; don't use only water as your hydrating agent.   Overall, learn as much as you can from this. Don't skimp on your prep. Read up and use the resources you can to make sure you get it done right and don't waste a bunch of food. It gets a lot easier!"
slowcooking,3duxwd,TiSpork,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"I think you might have to cut your losses on this one & learn from your mistakes.  You should always par-cook (brown or sear) your meats first (in this case, cook the ground beef, then the chicken), to get the maillard reaction, in the same pan or pot if you can. Take out the meat, drain excess oils/fats (leave about 2 oz in). Leave the brown crusty bits that are stuck to the bottom of the pan, in the pan; this is called the fond, and has a great deal of flavor waiting to be released.  Put the onions in the pan, cook those until they start to turn transluscent, then add your corn, herbs & spices & seasonings, and a little bit of stock or water (and maybe some minced/chopped garlic, if you want). When you add the liquid, scrape the bottom of the pan to start getting the fond doing its thing. After about 1 minute, add your meat(s) back in, pre-soaked beans (if any), and the rest of your liquid. Mix this thoroughly, then start your slow-cooking process.  Pasta in chili sounds kind of weird... but no problem. For the pasta, I would recommend leaving it out until shortly before you're ready to serve. In that case, I would boil the pasta until it's JUST al dente (possibly even JUST SLIGHTLY BEFORE al dente), then add the pasta to the amount you are going to serve for that meal, cooking the chilli & pasta together for about 5-10 minutes for the flavors to mingle. This will keep the pasta's consistency the way it should be, and not overcooked & mushy.   What I ended up with was this homogeneous mass of ground beef, chicken chunks, corn, and mushy pasta. It wasn't even cooked in the middle after 8 hours on low!   You also might want to be careful with this, from a food safety standpoint. I'm really hoping you didn't add raw ground beef AND raw chicken to you water, then tasted it... that's literally a recipe for disaster. I'm especially hoping you would not serve that to someone else."

Most of these support timers which most other slow cookers don't which is super nice and mine allows you to steam veggies and meat at the same time you make rice, so I can basically cook my entire meal at the same time in one machine. Whether it's right for you depends on what you will use it for, but I've been super happy with mine, especially considering the deal I got on it.

I'd like to get more dishes with beans in my regular mix, since its an easy way to add substance to a dish and stretch it out. also, i like making potstickers but i usually dont just because steaming followed by frying in one pan tends to be annoying and messy with splatter, so id prefer to steam it in a steamer before.  I'd also really like to increase my list of recipes, especially if i can prepare a baggie of crap the night before and dump it into the slowcooker the morning of, or stick it into a pressure cooker an hour or w/e before dinner.  im more of a cook by feel guy but my wife really likes exact measurements, and if she can easily stick crap into a pot and click the ON button, she loves it."

Sweet potatoes especially come out great for wrap/burrito filling. Regular potatoes too have a pretty solid texture out of the slow cooker. Actually, any root vegetable or other hard/crunchy ones work well. Softer veggies like eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, etc., I prefer in the oven. But again, if it's going in a recipe it is just fine.

slowcooking,3djbl1,tyronomo,9,Fri Jul 17 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"I live in Japan and currently my favorite way to prepare this kind of curry is the following:  Gather: Large onion, four/five garlic cloves (I love garlic), vegetables of choice (I often do potato, carrot, peas, pumpkin), and a dark beer.  Set a bunch of water to boiling. Once it's boiling put in the potatoes and carrots. Cut up the onion into thick slivers and saute it with the garlic with butter until the onions become half translucent. Put the onion/garlic lovelies to the side and boil the carrots and potatoes some more. Then put in the softer veggies (the pumpkin/onions) and boil that for a little bit.   When the potatoes get soft and the carrots lose their crunch take out HALF of the water. You can play around with the thickness of this curry, but I tend to prefer curries that are thicker. After I take out half of the water, I pour the dark beer in. I throw in the roux cubes and the peas and I mix until it's all done.   So good. To die for good."

slowcooking,3dikis,jokergod382,6,Thu Jul 16 21:46:12 2015 UTC,No I use mine all the time for uhm recreational butter. I like to use coconut oil instead of butter though
slowcooking,3dikis,i_am_not_12,3,Thu Jul 16 22:43:23 2015 UTC,Recipe for uhm coconut oil please?
slowcooking,3dikis,Self-Aware,2,Fri Jul 17 11:21:54 2015 UTC,I grind about a 1/2 oz of my best product and decarb it in the oven at 135°f for about 20 minutes. Then I melt half a cup to a cup of coconut oil in (depending on how strong I'm going for) on high in my mini crock pot. Throw in product let cook for 4 hours. Strain through cheese cloth and freeze over night. Check out r/treedibles for more information. I follow a varied guide of the old hippies cookbook
slowcooking,3dikis,i_am_not_12,0,Fri Jul 17 11:32:38 2015 UTC,Ta very much :)
slowcooking,3dikis,Self-Aware,0,Fri Jul 17 11:42:14 2015 UTC,Coconut oil is the way to go. That saturated fat content! I use essentially the same recipe you posted below except we just collect our vape leftovers.

slowcooking,3dikis,Ghotimonger,2,Thu Jul 16 21:06:49 2015 UTC,I've tried slow cooker bread before and it did not turn out well.  It was barely edible and certainly not bready.  I've been super successful with apple sauce and apple butter though.
slowcooking,3dikis,notanotherjenn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:01 2015 UTC,"Cooking a whole chicken isn't advisable, according to food safety experts.  Spends too much time in ""danger zone"" temperatures.  Same with other large pieces of meat, unless you sear them first.  If I were to try it, I would preheat the crock pot on high for 20-30 minutes, rinse off the chicken well, then maybe drop it in some boiling water for a few minutes."

slowcooking,3di9ba,JohnnyBrillcream,3,Thu Jul 16 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"Good question.  Hard to say for sure exactly what you're going to have when you remove the lid in eight hours.  Depending on the ratios of empty space, meat, liquid and humidity you could have a lot of outcomes.  I'd say pretty much anything fully immersed in cooking liquid on low for eight+ is going to be too tender to handle much and will require a fork.  If they were placed in mostly dry and allowed to slowly generate most if their own liquid they could be less fally offy but maybe a bit dry and thirsty for a thorough saucing.  The good news is, whether the meat in your cooker lines up directly with your expectations or not, it's going to smell wonderful in your home when you return and it will certainly be delicious.  I'm invested now, I have to know how this story ends."
slowcooking,3di9ba,weiss27md,4,Thu Jul 16 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"I will have to update with my findings. They are actually mostly dry, so I still have hope fora cohesive rack, but we will see.  As most have said, the consolation prize for messed up ribs is a steaming pile of delicious tender meat. Not much I can complain about there."
slowcooking,3di9ba,weiss27md,3,Thu Jul 16 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"If you have the time try this method. I know this is slow cooking but sharing cooking tips is important as well.  Set your oven to 300. Clean/Trim your ribs, remove the silver skin from the back if present. Rub with your favorite spices, or salt and pepper or nothing. I use salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. If you have liquid smoke put some in, if not not big deal. Put ribs in a tray that you can seal tight with aluminum foil, I just use the aluminum ones you can get at the store. Don't over crowd the pan. Seal tightly with aluminum foil.   Bake at 300 for 3 hours. Take out and let them cool completely, this is important. You are letting the fat solidify again, this gives you a rib that won't fall apart but is fall apart tender.  At this point you can broil/grill with a sauce or wrap them and put them in the fridge for later use(I take them out to warm up a bit before saucing them). I can do about 8 or so racks of baby backs at a time in my oven. Perfect if you are going to have a party for a bunch of people or tailgate."

I'm sure that this could be slow-cooked, but it definitely would not result in nice crispy skin and would take considerably longer.  I would say brine the chicken according to the recipe and then cook it in the slow cooker according to directions for whatever chicken parts you use.  You could try broiling it to crisp the skin, but be aware, especially if you're using legs, that the slow cooker may make the meat so fall-off-the-bone tender that it might fall apart before you can broil it."
slowcooking,3df40e,britcat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:29:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for your thoughts.  My lamb dish tonight even turned out a lot more fall-off-the-bone than I was anticipating. I will probably continue to never cook chicken in my slow cooker from now on.
slowcooking,3dev2w,Xpress_interest,6,Wed Jul 15 18:50:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, they work. There's a whole subreddit dedicated to this style of cooking - /r/sousvide , and you can get combo slow/sous vide cookers if you're short on kitchen space.   Sous Vide's brilliant for proteins - beef, chicken, lamb, even eggs. Meat's level of ""done-ness"" (rare, medium etc) is based on temperature, not time. Because sous vide gives you more control over the temperature, it means you can do tricks like holding a steak at medium-rare for 18 hours, breaking down the collagen in the meat (like a slow cooker) without over-doing the meat.   I have the Anova, and a combo slow/sous vide cooker. The Anova works well and is cheaper than the competition, but the Bluetooth is a gimmick (it's got a 15-foot range, so it only works when you're within easy walking distance anyway, unlike wifi) and the app is poorly designed (it's really easy to reset the timer/stop the circulator by accident). The units got a thumb wheel for setting temperature, and a start/stop button, so usually I just use that to control it."

I wouldn't blanket say that it's ok, because you can't just toss any old insert in there at, say, 450 degrees. Obviously it can withstand the temp it can reach under normal operation, but beyond that I'd check the manual."

If you own another slow cooker brand, please refer to your owner’s manual for specific crockery cooking medium tolerances.   Let me just add that as someone who actually cooks, stoneware is usually fine in the oven, you just don't want to shock it with ridiculous temperature differences. Some manufacturers say to not put their cookware in the oven, but that's usually more precaution more than anything.  Tell me how heating a crockpot on the counter is really that different than an oven? As long as the temperature range is the same, it's still basically indirect heat. An oven isn't magically different and stoneware is meant to take heat, that's the point of it."

slowcooking,3d2zde,MamaTR,2,Mon Jul 13 23:46:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry if Im dumb but do you mix the stuffing and liquids up before cooking or just layer it like that? And you put the stuffing stuff in at the beginning correct? What do you mean ""stir the stuffing in a few minutes before serving""?"
slowcooking,3d2zde,potacho,3,Mon Jul 13 13:27:38 2015 UTC,I mixed the soups together then put that over the chicken cutlets. Then I layered the stuffing directly on top of that. A few minutes (like 10-15) before I served the chicken I mixed the stuffing in just to make sure every bit had gotten moist.

slowcooking,3d2zde,ss0889,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:42 2015 UTC,This recipe doesn't include your veggies. Did you just add frozen or canned?
slowcooking,3d2zde,briamble,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:14:19 2015 UTC,"I did not even realize! Yes, I added my own and they were frozen. I think like a pound of mixed veggies to kind of make it like a pot pie type of dish. Probably could go in towards the end as well to not overcook them."
slowcooking,3d2zde,mercfh85,10,Mon Jul 13 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"looks like a fantastic recipe. might i suggest putting a basic rub on the chicken and giving it a quick sear in a pan first? seems like this would be a really bland recipe without any form of seasonings.  i'd say just get some italian seasoning, turn a cast iron skillet up to high, drop in a dollop of butter and dump the chicken in. right after you get some browning on one side, flip it over, then put it into the slow cooker. might reduce cooking time as well.  though at that point id just turn the stove to low and put everything into the cast iron itself."

slowcooking,3d4i33,TheJadedRose,4,Mon Jul 13 14:09:13 2015 UTC,You can definitely do it in the slow cooker and 8hours is probably enough. Just I think you are going to want to cut the amount of water by maybe a quarter to a third. Slow cookers don't allow for much evaporation. Maybe just use enough to cover all the ingredients.

slowcooking,3d1fkk,HittingSmoke,6,Mon Jul 13 02:07:25 2015 UTC,I like some potatoes melting to thicken up the stew a little bit and some with some texture. So I throw in two batches of potatoes. One at the start and one an hour or two before they're done. Best of both worlds.
slowcooking,3d1fkk,ddragggon,2,Mon Jul 13 02:38:21 2015 UTC,I prefer to them super tender and fall apart on the fork.  Adding them later would be the only way to make that not happen though.

It's tasty either way.  I think I prefer seared but I couldn't tell you why beyond ""we've always done it that way"" but not searing the meat first didn't change the flavor in any noticeable way.

If you sear the meat first it will impart more of that flavor into the meat instead of the flavor you'd get from boiled meat. Especially if you dust it with a bit of flour to dissolve into the fluids as it cooks. This is the same reason when you deglaze a pan after searing meat it doesn't taste like boiled meat. It tastes like seared meat.  You're talking out of your ass here with no evidence. If you change the flavor of something then put it in a stew the flavor it imparts is going to be different.

Place the pork in a slow cooker (fat cap up), top with the onion, jalapeño, minced garlic (don't worry about spreading it) and squeeze over the juice of the orange.  Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours or on high for 6 hours. The meat should be tender and falling off the bone.  Remove from the slow cooker and let cool slightly. Then shred the pork using two forks.  Skim off the fat from the juices remaining in the slow cooker and discard the fat. Then if you are left with a lot more than 1½ to 2 cups of juice, then reduce it (either in the slow cooker on the sauté setting with the lid off, or in a saucepan). Set aside.

I've previously been a frequent user of a couple of $17 special 5qt Hamilton Beach and they did well.  Besides the one where the crock mysteriously cracked in half.  Obviously I have no future as an appliance salesman but for most stuff in slow cookers I consider it an imprecise art of chucking stuff in the thing, turning it on, fiddling with whatever recipe til it tastes right, and turning it off when its done."

Most recipes call for 8 hours of cooking on low, but as I work full time half an hour away from home, I'm out of the house for at least 10 hours on weekdays. My options are cook overnight and reheat for dinner, let it sit and cool down for 2 hours before dinner, or only use it on the weekends."
slowcooking,3d1yhq,twentyfoureight,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:51:37 2015 UTC,"I asked specifically for this crock pot for my birthday and have been very happy with it:  http://smile.amazon.com/Crock-Pot-SCCPVI600-S-Countdown-Stove-Top-Stainless/dp/B00IPENZK0/ref=sr_1_20?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1436975228&sr=1-20&keywords=crock+pot&pebp=1436975267583&perid=10DWS13MYP18HBPJREZN  You can put the pot itself on the stove top to either brown your meat first, which is great and you get a lot of flavor off the browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan, or to finish off the liquid after you take the cooked meat out, say to thicken or reduce it.  So far I've browned a tri-tip roast in there for fajitas and cubed stew meat for a carne guisada, and both turned out great. Dusting the stew meat with a little flour before browning made the carne guisada nice and thick instead of watery and turned out so well that it's going to be a go-to recipe."
slowcooking,3d1d6y,weird_in_chicago,19,Sun Jul 12 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"*protein. sorry.  As per this guy ,  ""Slow cooking does not destroy more nutrients. In fact, the lower temperatures may help preserve nutrients that can be lost when food is cooked rapidly at high heat. What’s more, food cooked slowly often tastes better. I recommend slow cooking (in what used to be called crock pots) to those who say that the biggest barrier to healthful meals is lack of time. New versions of the crock pot have programmable functions that allow you to put fresh, healthy, organic ingredients into them in the morning and have a delicious soup or stew ready to eat when you get home. The cookers can keep the food hot and fresh even if family members have to eat at different times. Slow cooking can even help you cut grocery bills (and is much more economical than take-out) because you can use inexpensive ingredients such as dried beans that have been soaked overnight rather than more costly canned beans. There is no end of healthy recipes that lend themselves to slow cooking."""
slowcooking,3d1d6y,roscoesdead,15,Sun Jul 12 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"If there is a problem with cooking beans in a slow cooker it's that some beans, particularly red kidney beans, are high in phytohemagglutinin,  which is toxic at high doses. Boiling temperatures for just a few minutes destroy the phytohemagglutinin.   It's possible that a slow cooker would not be sufficient.  If you are concerned, boil the beans for ten minutes before transferring to the slow cooker.  I used to make black beans entirely in my slow cooker. They're pretty high in phytohemagglutinin too. I never had a problem, but switched to a 10 minute boil first out of caution."

I give all my dried beans a good boil before I toss them in the slow cooker now, after a pretty bad night of food poisoning.

slowcooking,3cx04s,WinterCowboy,76,Sat Jul 11 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"All right, all right, I like my slow cooker as much as the next person in this sub, but Tikka Masala is one of those recipes where I'd rather not cook it in the slow cooker because it's just so, so much better on the stove if you have the time. Because, when actually making this you:   Grill/broil the chicken, getting some nice char/browning Brown the onions, getting much better flavor out of them than just leaving them in liquid at low heat for hours Get much better garlic taste from sauteing in oil Reduce the curry, making it a lot thicker and more flavorful   Also, it's okay to add the coconut milk in the beginning because coconut milk doesn't curdle like dairy milk does. My Thai dad who cooks a lot of Thai curries (most, if not all use coconut milk) puts it in right after stir-frying the paste and then simmers it for the rest of the day.   A lot of what's great about chicken tikka masala is that it's super creamy, and you'll find that most restaurants here in the US use heavy cream to make it creamy and orange and it tastes delicious. If you're going to use cream, definitely do it at the end because you don't want to boil that for too long. If you're going to use coconut milk, I would just use the normal one instead of light, but I've never opened up a can of light so I don't know if it's thinner. Though I'm guessing that you're using light coconut milk for health reasons (calories/fat compared to heavy cream), so it's definitely understandable.   Sorry, I'm not trying to dump over your recipe, OP. Just trying to give tips for anyone new to making this dish who got inspired by your post!"

I just have to go to practice 2-3 times a day on top of taking a class and having a job so setting the slow cooker when I go to bed and taking it off when I go to bed is easiest. About the cream/coconut milk, I had no idea what I was doing so I just added it at the end just in case. I have to eat large amounts of calories, but try to limit my fat intake.     This was eaten with brown rice, which I do not know if that's ok to eat with this dish. Maybe I can cook it with your suggestions when I have a little more time on my hands."

slowcooking,3cyfzo,mustangsarah,3,Sat Jul 11 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"Ingredients   3 chicken breasts, thawed 1/2 jar peach preserves 1 can crushed pineapple 1 cup applesauce, unsweetened 2 T olive oil 1-2 cloves minced garlic 1/2 cup diced onions 2 T soy sauce 1 T dijon mustard 3 T brown sugar 1 t cumin 1 t pumpkin pie spice 1 t paprika salt and pepper, to taste   Directions   Cut chicken into cubes (I cut each breast into 6 chunks). Combine brown sugar and spices (cumin, pumpkin pie, paprika, salt, pepper) until the brown sugar is evenly integrated. Coat inside of crockpot with olive oil. Add minced garlic, onions, and chicken. Evenly distribute the brown sugar/spices over chicken (there should be enough for a thorough coating). Add soy sauce, dijon mustard, and pineapple. Add peach preserves by dolloping it into the crockpot (roughly 10 spoonfuls). Fill in the spaces between the peach preserve dollops with applesauce.   TL;DR: Throw all of the ingredients into the crockpot, it will probably taste the same either way.   Cook on Low for 4 hours (my crockpot is 6 quarts - adjust accordingly). Stir contents of crockpot. Cook on High for 1 hour without the lid. This helps the sauce thicken. Serve over rice (I added garlic salt to mine). Enjoy!   Tips   In hindsight, I also would have added a diced apple for texture. I'm sure other fruits (mango perhaps?) or sweet potatoes would taste lovely as well. This is a great recipe to pair with various rices. In the future I'm going to try it with either cilantro-lime rice or cranberry-almond rice. If rice isn't your thing (?), quinoa or a spring green/arugula mix would make a great substitute."

slowcooking,3cy04y,NoSleepTillTacos,4,Sat Jul 11 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"I know this isn’t traditional chili, but I love it and it goes over well with guests. This is my basic chili recipe. It’s an ongoing project, but here it is as it stands now.  Meat: Ground Turkey, and hot italian turkey sausage. These are my go to meats. Less fat, less grease. Sometimes I’ll use ground beef and cube some steak up, but I always use the turkey sausage.  Veggies: Onion, Green peppers, garlic, jalapeños. I’ll also add other assorted peppers depending on what the store has. this time it was Jalapeños and canned chipotles. When I’m going all out I’ll get some dried peppers, char them boil them for a few minutes and then make a paste out of them. this really adds to the chili, and I should do it more often, but I don’t because I hate cleaning the food processor.   Spices: Chili powder, cumin, brown sugar, Tomato paste, oregano, bay leaves, salt and pepper.  Kidney beans, canned whole peeled tomatoes roughly chopped with the liquid, red wine or beer. I prefer using an Oktoberfest/Marzen style beer, used wine this time.   Process: Brown meat and veggies. Add to crock pot and stir in spices. Add everything else."

slowcooking,3cxbp6,powerlifting_dude,3,Sat Jul 11 16:39:23 2015 UTC,"Either the water from the chicken is watering down the Alfredo sauce or the cream in the sauce is seperating after being cooked so long,  (which I doubt).   This isn't a dish that I think is really suitable for slow cooking but if you're dead set on it try cooking the chicken in a skillet until it's halfway done or more then throw it into the crockpot like normal. Reduce the cooking time by about half and you should be good."
slowcooking,3cxbp6,Wallawino,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"I am no pro, but I might try butter flying the chicken breasts then cooking the chicken in hot sauce by themselves. About a half hour before they're all done, drain out the liquid, add more hot sauce directly on both sides of the chicken breasts, then add the Alfredo.   I agree with the above comment that unfortunately this might not be the best recipe for a slow cooker. SO much water comes out from chicken when it's cooked. I'll keep an eye out for a waterless version of an Alfredo-like cream sauce... At the moment all I can think of is using a can or two of Campbell's Condensed Cream of (whatever you like) soup."
slowcooking,3cwl8m,unctracc,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:52:15 2015 UTC,"I would cook them as you would chicken thighs, then crisp the skin under a broiler afterwards, preferably with a glaze or sauce of your choice (anything you'd glaze chicken wings with would work well).   Super simple recipe.. roughly chop onions, carrots and celery to line the base of the pot. Pepper the turkey wings and place them over the veggies. Pour in a few cups of broth or stock of your choice, chicken or vegetable both work well. Turkey stock might be even better.  If the stock is low sodium, you might want to add some salt to taste.  Cook on low for 5-6 hours, or high for 3ish hours. Then finish them under the broiler (glaze is optional, but recommended)."
slowcooking,3csgjs,KidQuestionz42,49,Fri Jul 10 12:09:54 2015 UTC,"It's better to have none of the meat touching the bottom. Lay down a layer of something else first, like onion or potato or some type of veggie. If the meat rises above the liquid you can give it a good rearranging halfway through cooking and bring the bottom pieces to the top."
slowcooking,3csgjs,MedicineMan81,33,Fri Jul 10 14:24:47 2015 UTC,As far as liquid goes it depends on what you're cooking doesn't it? When I'm cooking a pork shoulder I add no liquid at all. Absolutely agree with keeping it off the bottom though. I took a tip from Nom Nom Paleo and put strips of bacon on the bottom. Just gives that hint of smoke flavor that's worth the extra dollar.
slowcooking,3csgjs,garner_adam,34,Fri Jul 10 16:35:50 2015 UTC,put strips of bacon on the bottom. Just gives that hint of smoke flavor that's worth the extra dollar.   I kind of feel like an idiot for never having thought of this.

slowcooking,3csgjs,Akanderson87,5,Fri Jul 10 20:09:34 2015 UTC,Nothing goes with pork quite like more pork. Particularly if that pork is bacon.
slowcooking,3csgjs,liberal_texan,10,Fri Jul 10 23:38:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yes it is wonderful.  I put bacon down on sweet onions then laid the shoulder on top with my last batch and it was awesome.  About to be lunch, too.  Had a couple extra strips so laid those on top."
slowcooking,3csgjs,agoia,5,Fri Jul 10 17:38:13 2015 UTC,I'm intrigued. What's the rest of the recipe?
slowcooking,3csgjs,SnowRidin,10,Fri Jul 10 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"Rubbed with stuff (whatever you feel like), refrigerated over night, pulled out, grilled briefly to get some color on the sides, laid on bed of onions (half slices) and bacon strips.  Splash a teeeny bit of liquid smoke on the top.  Lay excess bacon on top (I used maybe 1/3rd of a pound total aka what was left in the open pack in the fridge).     Turned on low.  About 2-3 hours in it still looked a little dry from the grilling so I splashed it with some cider vinegar and put a layer of brown sugar on top.  Drained and pulled at about 7.5 hours, reserved some liquid and added some of the juice back after skimming the grease.  Made a sauce of Sweet Baby Rays + Sriracha + dijon mustard + Worcestershire to eat with prepared pork.  I'm a hack, I know, but the 5+ lb shoulder is almost gone between 4 ppl and I cooked it 2 days ago.  Also forgive incongruent verb tenses, kinda out of gourd atm"
slowcooking,3csgjs,agoia,7,Fri Jul 10 20:32:39 2015 UTC,Oh yeah the liquid you get as a by product of that sweating pig is very useful. After I pull the meat out and shred it in a separate pot I like to throw a bunch of veggies in the liquid and cook it on high for 90-120 minutes. I come back throw in some cayenne pepper and now I got some killer soup to boot.

slowcooking,3csgjs,agoia,3,Sat Jul 11 02:51:01 2015 UTC,So you didn't actually add much liquid huh? Sounds delish
slowcooking,3csgjs,SnowRidin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:51:15 2015 UTC,Typically from a 5-7 lb roast I will pour off about a quart of liquid. 1-2 vidalias give some liquid as well but generally you need little to none.

slowcooking,3csgjs,SnowRidin,6,Tue Jul 14 12:27:08 2015 UTC,"You're right. If the meat isn't submerged in any liquid, no point in moving anything around. Great idea with the bacon. I'll have to give that a try."
slowcooking,3csgjs,MedicineMan81,5,Fri Jul 10 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"I just throw it in there. Sometimes its on the bottom, sometimes it gets to the middle. Its never just on the top though.  Generally you're going to end up mixing or stirring your pot around so in the end it doesn't matter too much. I stir mine quite a bit and everything moves around quite a bit during cooking. I rarely just let it 'sit' for the full duration of cooking without stirring (of course, depends on what you cook!)"
slowcooking,3csgjs,Stone-Bear,3,Fri Jul 10 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"Depending on what I'm making I put the firmest vegetables on the bottom first. Like Carrots, Potatoes, Onions, then meat on top. Seems to work out for me."
slowcooking,3csgjs,Teri102563,2,Fri Jul 10 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"It's best if everything is submerged.

slowcooking,3cphln,kvw260,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"I never have.  I mean, a one-pound pork loin will cook just fine over 7-8 hours provided you can resist opening the top of your cooker to give it a sniff more than once or twice.  If it's of great concern, just add about a half-cup of water to the bottom of your crock; that way, you can ensure the steam that's produced will fully cook it.  I've done it both ways plenty of times and I've never had undercooked meat.  What I usually do is let it go untouched for six hours with about a half-bottle of whatever sauce you like; then, I pull the top off, shred it with a couple of forks, put in another quarter-bottle of sauce, and let it go for another hour or two (I find it's a little juicier if you pull it off the heat after an hour, but to each his own)."

Chicken thighs, canned pineapple, Hawaiian BBQ sauce, cook for 8 hours on low, shred and serve over rice.   I love honey garlic chicken. Chicken thighs, several cloves of garlic (chopped or whole but pressed so they release some of their flavor), honey, soy sauce. Cook for 8 hours on low, shred and serve over rice. I tried this variation recently and it came out super tasty too.   I make ribs in the slow cooker too. I throw in a rack of ribs, cover them in BBQ, cook for 8 hours, then broil them for a few minutes at the end. If you don't have an oven, just serve.

Place one can adobo chili over top. Cook 12 hours or until pork internal temp is over 195. Separate from liquid and let rest. Dump most of liquid and onion out. Return pork to crock with two ladles of broth. Add sauce and or peppery ACV.   Buy bag of slaw and buns.  Add slaw to ACV a bit of sugar, bit of oil, salt and pepper.  Add all things.  Meal will feed 4 people for like 10-12$"
slowcooking,3cphln,SmashesIt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"Pot roast: Get a cut of chuck roast, add a can of french onion soup (Campbell's condensed works well), add carrots and potatoes if you like, and leave it alone all day. It'll be so tender you'll pull it out of the crockpot in bites.  Vegetable soup: Chuck roast again, but cut it into cubes before cooking. Whatever sizes you like (you can use leftover pot roast if you want). You can sear them in a pan if you want some extra flavor. Throw your beef chunks in the slow cooker with some beef broth and a can or two of V8 juice (the little cans of straight tomato juice). A can of that french onion soup works well here too. Dice up a lot of potatoes and throw those in. Carrots work great as well. Go for a few hours (4+) then add other, softer veggies that don't need to cook for long such as corn and peas. You can't over cook this. Leftovers only get better. I hate leftovers, but I'll eat this all week long."

slowcooking,3cphln,notanotherjenn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:27:13 2015 UTC,Cover the bottom of the crockpot with ribs. Cover the ribs with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Use the whole bottle so the ribs stay wet.  Set the crockpot on low. come back in 10 hrs.
slowcooking,3cphln,NatenLogansDad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:35:59 2015 UTC,"Beef roast. I like to cut it up in to 2"" fillet pieces. Rub Lipton onion soup mix all over the meat. Grab a bowl. Stir 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and a can of tomato soup together. Dump it all on the meat. Cook for at least 8hrs on low. Shred the beef with two forks( it will fall apart easily.) Serve the beef and the sauce  over white rice. It's so much better than I thought it would be, and I don't like mushroom or tomato soup."
slowcooking,3cphln,NatenLogansDad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:41:15 2015 UTC,My favorite:  1 can Pepsi 1 beef roast 1 pkg Lipton onion soup mix 1 can cream of mushroom soup Optional can of drained mushrooms  Pour everything over the roast.  Turn on low for eight hours.  Come back to awesome pot roast in its own gravy.  Thicken with arrowroot if needed.  Serve with mashed potatoes and green peas or whatever you like.
slowcooking,3cphln,biggreenfan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:46:39 2015 UTC,"Here are some of my ""so simple you can't possibly screw them up"" slow cooker recipes.   Chicken and a jar of marinara. You can add onions, carrots or bell pepper if you feel like it. Meat and a jar of curry sauce. Vegetables optional, based on whatever you think will taste good with your sauce. Serve with rice and/or naan. Chicken and a packet of Cincinnati Chilli mix.  Add onions and/or carrots if you want. Pulled pork. Add a big boneless pork shoulder an onion and enough cola (coke, Pepsi, root beer, Dr Pepper, etc. DO NOT USE DIET!) to almost cover the meat.  Cook on low 8 hours. Move meat and onion to a bowl and mix with a tangy BBQ sauce. Serve with raw onions and cheap yellow mustard on an onion bun. pot roast with a packet of french onion soup. Potatoes, carrots and onions are borderline essential.   I generally don't bother with measuring anything in these recipes.  The quantities really don't matter very much as long as it looks okay going in to the pot."
slowcooking,3cphln,LemurianLemurLad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"From ATK Slow Cooker Cookbook-A roast beef from a slow cooker that actually comes out like a roast beef-not pot roast.  Pay attention the the temp of the beef-I put a steak thermometer in it the entire time.  This really does only take a couple of hours-perfect for when you need/want a roast beef but it's too hot to turn on the oven. In Market BAsket, where I shop, the cut of beef is also called a Spoon Roast.  http://i.imgur.com/OanUZuP.png?1"

slowcooking,3cl276,VROF,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:19:57 2015 UTC,If you have a library card you should check your your library's digital catalog. I found a ton of great slow cooker cookbooks on mine. A near one was for slow cooking for two which is great for my college kid. Several freezer meal books too. I just screen shot the recipes I want and print them out for later.

slowcooking,3cl276,FercPolo,2,Wed Jul 8 19:13:18 2015 UTC,One of the best slow cooker cook books I've found is 300 Low Carb Slowcooker Recipes by Dana Carpender.  300 Low-Carb Slow Cooker Recipes: Healthy Dinners that are Ready When You Are https://www.amazon.com/dp/1592334970/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_IwCNvbCM2A1NP  No canned soup or soup packet ingredients. I choose to ignore her Splenda use and substitute sugar but there are a lot of good recipes here. I checked it out digitally from our library and found myself copying sonny recipes I just got the whole book.

This reminds me of the time my SO thought the still-liquid bacon grease from breakfast was probably cool enough to pour off into a solo cup without melting it. (Spoiler: if it's still liquid enough to pour, it's still hot enough to melt the plastic cup.)"
slowcooking,3cnaat,thatjenn,0,Thu Jul 9 11:52:10 2015 UTC,"You gotta save the grease!!!!!  Bacon Balsamic Reduction  2 tbsp bacon grease  1/4 cup brown sugar  1.4 cup balsamic vinegar  Combine in small pot and reduce by half at low simmer/boil, about 10-15 minutes. Drizzle that on top of blue cheese or ranch dressing on a salad. It will keep in the fridge for over a month, just heat it up in the microwave when you need it."
