sonos,3du24i,Unbathed,11,Sun Jul 19 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing the big deal here. Literally all they did with the Tone is change the color. Adding a different dye combination to the materials. No retooling involved. No major design effort. No physical dimensional changes.  The design, manufacturing and marketing changes would be minimal cost (comparatively). If this change cost them more than $150k, I'd be surprised.  I'd say half that is much more likely.   In my opinion, it seems rather gimmicky. And I'm sure I'll be down voted to the fiery blazes of hell.   That said, I mostly like my 1 the way it is. Now the app is a different story..."
sonos,3du24i,tjhenn,6,Sun Jul 19 16:31:57 2015 UTC,It feels too much like a gimmick to me as well. They lower their standards everytime they do something like this.  Problem is they need to sustain business and they have an extremely niche product.  Slow and steady ensures they sustain business.  It sucks.
sonos,3du24i,shadowjig,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"... change the color ...   If SONOS designers are like Apple's designers, or like any of the interior designers I have met personally, choosing which shade of white would have been a big deal all by itself, involving mockups and prototypes and testing to assure that the white of the speaker matched exactly the white of the Ethernet and power cables. The cables, the grill, and the speaker trim are all different materials and will take color differently. These are very fussy people.  Prototype Apple Watch bands which Jony Ive had lying around, which he brought with him to a show in Switzerland.  The post-manufacture QA needs to be higher, because there will not be an unlimited inventory of replacements for a (rare) dud unit."
sonos,3du24i,D0M1NATE,3,Sun Jul 19 17:26:32 2015 UTC,Completely correct. Probably had to spend time making sure the new colors stay consistent. That they aren't damaged in manufacturing or packaging. It's simple people of you don't want to pay the $50 more. Dont.

sonos,3du24i,minodude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:42:22 2015 UTC,"the gross marginal revenue is capped at $500,000   Nitpick: this assumes that they only sell to people who were planning to buy a PLAY:1 anyway, i.e. those 10,000 units 'replace' 10,000 other 'regular' PLAY:1 units, whose sales drop by 10K.  This isn't necessarily true."
sonos,3dsmbn,jsvb1977,7,Sun Jul 19 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my feedback is that you are solving a problem that does not exist.   If you don't start the group from the portable speaker, your music will not stop for the whole group. Just unplug it, move it, plug it back in and tap a button or two to join the group again. Probably less work, quicker and more convenient than moving a battery back as well as the Play 1."
sonos,3dsmbn,parkerjh,4,Sun Jul 19 02:21:39 2015 UTC,"Well how about that!  Although the speaker was not auto added back into the group... The music didn't stop playing.   Then, when I added the speaker back into the group , it started playing the music.   No interruption in music.   Nice."

sonos,3dmquc,frunt,2,Fri Jul 17 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. I mostly try to listen to BBC stations, but I've practically given up - tunein is awful.   My long term problem is that the ""recent"" programmes doesn't work well (shows missing or wont play), so I usually end up listening to shows via an app on my phone.   Recently live radio (any, not just bbc) starts to stutter and then stops after perhaps 10 minutes? Doesn't happen all the time, other Internet use isn't affected so it would appear to be a tunein problem."
sonos,3dmquc,goneforaburton,4,Fri Jul 17 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not alone, I emailed support earlier. Reply below;  Good Evening,  In reply to your email today regarding BBC Radio.  The reason for this issue is that the BBC have stopped supporting the WMA format and have replaced it with HLS – a format our and some other devices do not currently support. To get around this they have made a lower quality stream available (Shoutcast MP3) so Sonos users will still be able to stream BBC stations through Tunein, but there are two implications of this change:   - You can no longer listen to live sport / events where there are territorial rights limitations - The streaming quality is lower  Our Product Management team are aware of the need to support HLS but we do not as yet have a timescale for this work.  Information from the BBC about this can be found on the link below :- http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/977a1954-658f-4fb2-a23c-71680c49882f  Sonos have also added workaround information to our ASK.SONOS website :- https://ask.sonos.com/sonos/topics/bbc-radio-no-longer-provides-this-service-in-the-windows-media-format-how-do-i-listen-to-the-bbc-on    https://ask.sonos.com/sonos/topics/support-for-bbc-radio-hls-streams?topic-reply-list"
sonos,3dmquc,NotEqual,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.   I find it disappointing that with over a year notice sonos are still only on the early stages of developing support.   BBC and Spotify support are the two most important streaming services for me, and I'd guess quite a few in the UK. I feel let down on both of these fronts, especially given the cost of the system. BBC is poor quality, Spotify has been clunky, but is finally getting some small improvement.   I expected sonos to be better, to just work, not (kind of) just work."
sonos,3dmquc,goneforaburton,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't imagine the change is that great in terms of implementing a new protocol - I'm sure BBC aren't the only ones using it after all. It's also a little sad that unless you're aware of the issue there's no notice given/automatic fix for the problem."
sonos,3dmquc,NotEqual,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, no. Have you tried a wide selection of stations? Is this only since the 5.4 update? There were updates to the TuneIn support."
sonos,3dmquc,phillip_u,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"It varies, I've had my Sonos a bit over a year, had a weekdays radio wakeup alarm set for most of that time.  Some days it randomly wouldn't play at all - if you've never encountered this, the Sonos falls back to an alarm clock-style beeping alarm.  Some days it stuttered as you described and/or dropped out constantly, requiring re-starting the stream 3 or 4 times in the half hour I'd have it on for.  Other days, perfect.  Of late, it's been great, I don't think I've had a single drop-out in the last 2 or 3 months.  The other extremely variable thing is the delay from wall clock time - I have a news station on the alarm that has ""pips"" on the hour.  At some points in the past the stream would be delayed by up to 90 seconds.  That suddenly came right about 6 months ago for this particular station, when it suddenly started being <10 seconds late, again for the last few months it's been as good as you're ever going to get, about 3-4 seconds."
sonos,3dmquc,qupada42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"all the time on BBC, it's a pain the arse.   and I dont understand the 'no live sports' thing, I've been listening (with dropouts) to the cricket pretty much non-stop but then if I've got 5 live on and football summaries come on, it drops out.   I guess it only applies to sports whose lawyers are paid enough to watch all the different streams."
sonos,3dmau2,PadCooter,4,Fri Jul 17 12:45:42 2015 UTC,"Log into your wifi router and see what channel it is using for 2.4Ghz (1, 6, or 11) and then check your Sonos settings and see what channel it is using. Make sure you are using a different channel for Sonos then your wifi (choosing from 1, 6, or 11). It's also worth running a wifi scanning tool to see what your neighbors are running and choosing the least polluted channels. Check out this article for more information."
sonos,3dmau2,MisterTwo,2,Fri Jul 17 14:26:33 2015 UTC,"I second this. SonosNet runs in the same frequencies as WiFi and other 2.4 GHz gear. You've got to avoid interference for optimal performance. Channels 1, 6 and 11 have no overlap with each other and are usually the best choices. If you're in a densely populated area where you'll have to use a scanner to make sure it isn't a neighboring signal causing the problem."

They point towards an open plan dining area where a play 5 sits behind dining table. I'd draw a diagram but on mobile..   Soundbar in living room. Which is where the router is. Still have a bridge plugged in but not sure it's necessary anymore?  I also have a 'roving' play1 that's our alarm clock/radio/ music in the bedroom and sometimes moved to the garden with a long extension cable during summer :)
sonos,3demol,Knew_a_queens_legs,0,Wed Jul 15 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"There has to be a better solution for outdoors than a rover play1 on a extension cord or spending the cheddar on on a connect for outdoor speakers. I don't want to feel duped by purchasing the connect and then an update comes out that allows me to stream from 3rd party apps outside of the Sonos ""preferred apps"" or a cheap line-in solution for the play 1's"
sonos,3demol,Knew_a_queens_legs,3,Wed Jul 15 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"I don't understand -- a roving play1 works great. They're not waterproof nor are they outdoor permanent speakers.

sonos,3demol,phillip_u,2,Thu Jul 16 13:46:43 2015 UTC,"But what's wrong with spending to get a Connect or Connect Amp for outdoor speakers?  I mean, you'd pay for whatever Sonos speaker you use outdoors anyway, right?  Outdoor speakers run a wide gamut of pricing.  I got a pair of TIC GS3s and a GS50 sub and it cost under $200.  Hooked it up to a Sonos Connect Amp using just direct bury 14/2 wire (the GS50 sub is passive) for another $20.  Aside from the amp being a bit under powered for those speakers, it works well and makes a lot of sound.  If I'd gone with two Play:3s to match the output of the TIC speakers, I'd have spent less for sure but I'd also have to bring them in and out all the time during the summer.  And they're not designed to run in the full sun so I'm not sure what the effect would be on them."
sonos,3demol,fengshui,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:27:53 2015 UTC,My guess is that someday they'll do a battery-powered Play:1 equivalent.  Logitech had one in their Squeezebox Radio and it worked great.

Why 2x play 5's in the office?"
sonos,3demol,Kllian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:32:55 2015 UTC,"Before the latest purchase I had the following:     Office 1: Nothing Office 2: Play:3 Drinking Room: Play:5 Kitchen: 2 Play:1   I wanted to add sonos to my office, so i brought in all the speakers to do a side by side comparison.  The play:5 sounded the best, then play:3, then play:1 but it was only when i did a side by side comparison could I tell the difference.  So I decided to pickup another Play:5, Play:3, and Play:1.  That way I could upgrade the speakers in the kitchen (it's an open kitchen to a eating area to the living room), I could add stereo to the drinking room/dining room, and I could put a speakers in the second office.  I work from home and spend most of my time in the office, so I wanted the best. I don't mind paying the premium if it's something I'll use for hours a day.  For the Office 2, my wife doesnt use it very much so a Play:1 works well in there, and for the kitchen, we listen to music a lot since we cook a lot.  I can say with certainty for me that stereo > better single speaker."
sonos,3demol,phillip_u,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:06:25 2015 UTC,I think that 2 separate speakers paired together sound better.  It's a wider sound stage and the stereo effect is much more pronounced.  I went with two Play:1s in my office instead of a single Play:5 for this very reason.

Google chose to include that functionality (as well as functionality to choose different lock screens, launchers, whatever), while Apple did not. The license the code is under is irrelevant.  In fact, Google is not a big fan of their own AOSP."
sonos,3dcq8l,D0M1NATE,0,Thu Jul 16 03:05:58 2015 UTC,Upvote I tried explaining the closed APIs to  u/Tinototem yesterday. Sonos has made it clear in forum it needs the tech giants support to implement this functionality

You have a guide for Lock screen controls on iOS that seems to explain a feature that does not exist? http://www.sonos.com/support/onlineuserguide/en/SonosUserGuide/iPhone/Chap01/Lock_screen_controls_-_iPhone.htm  And its also a requested feature, specially considering that the built in control options are not usable. (like how spotify is integrated)  Create an iOS 8 lock screen widget https://ask.sonos.com/sonos/topics/create_an_ios_8_lock_screen_widget  This two examples were for me as a first time user features that i really liked and missed within the first few hours of using my new Sonos system.

sonos,3dal58,D0M1NATE,-2,Tue Jul 14 21:36:22 2015 UTC,As for the lock screen. Apple hasn't provided support which is why the feature is available on android through Google play service and not on iOS.  It is important to understand that Sonos has to work on tons of devices with over 60 music services.  It takes work from all ends to make a feature like this work.

sonos,3d4vzp,phillip_u,2,Mon Jul 13 20:58:33 2015 UTC,One would think that Spotify should be able to do that with the Sonos API.  The Sonos Voice App for iOS does something similar - it injects itself into whatever zones you pick.

sonos,3d5g2n,thecw,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:12 2015 UTC,And the Playbar input is limited to optical. I think your cheapest option is to go with a used Connect/ZP90.  But a Play:5 is worth considering if you don't have an existing stereo system for the Connect to run through since you'll then at least also have another speaker.    It should be noted that you do not have to listen to the line in on the player that it is connected to as far as I know.  I've got a Connect:Amp powering my outside speakers and I play music via AirPlay on an Apple Airport Express through it all the time while the outside speakers are either off or playing something else my wife picks.

I believe all old speakers are still supported, but there used to exist a standalone handheld controller that is (as far as I can tell) no longer supported in the latest updates. There should be no problem performing a reset on any Sonos speaker you buy, and then just joining it to your network.  If you're willing to pay a bit more for some assurances about the quality and a return period, Best Buy usually has some like-new Sonos returns at a ~15% discount, although the selection obviously depends on what has been returned in your area. You might check their website if you're interested, as you can search what's available in your area under ""Open Box"" items."

sonos,3czvtf,phillip_u,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:15:38 2015 UTC,I've bought some open box Sonos gear through Best Buy and the only thing to note is that more likely than not the gear has already been registered (since the stuff automatically is registered when it is first set up or added to an existing installation) and you'll only get a warranty starting from the date it was originally registered.

sonos,3cnf5v,brophyd,2,Thu Jul 9 06:55:39 2015 UTC,"In networking a bridge connects two different network mediums together.  In this case the Sonos bridge connects a wired network to a wireless network (SonosNET).  All Sonos devices talk to one another via SonosNET which is a separate wireless network that's running and you have no control of it.  SonosNET is Sonos' solution to ensure that all the devices are in sync and can communicate seamlessly to one another.  Also in networking you don't daisy chain devices together because it impacts performance.  In your case connect the bridge to your router.  You don't have to connect the ZP100 to Ethernet, as it will talk directly to the bridge wirelessly.  If you do connect the ZP100 to Ethernet then connect it directly to your router.  In the latter case the bridge is redundant (as it's purpose is to bridge the SonosNet to Ethernet and thusly the internet)."

I think the 'add-rest-of-the-album' thing only got popular in the last few years, with the rise of online streaming services and how they more or less treat albums as seperate playlists. Sonos is around for quite a bit longer, so there might also be an element of not changing the way it works too much to not confuse existing users. Might well be wrong though.

UI: All the Sonos speakers in your network will be represented in each row (cafè, rainy or fireplace). Each speaker works as a volume control and play button at the same time. When you press one of them sound will start playing based on what row the speaker is in. You adjust the volume by dragging and holding the white background color of the speaker. I'll upload a video of this, easier to understand that way.  Technical: uPnP packets for discovering all the speakers and SOAP requests for activating the sound in specific speakers + volume adjustments.   Hope that made some of it clearer :)"

If you have no devices connected to your router, Sonos will communicate over your wifi network.  There's no need to connect more than one device to your router.  And for surround sound, the playbar is the left, right, center, and sub channel.  In the Sonos software you can join the 2 other speakers as surround speakers.  The recommended way to connect a game console is to connect audio and video to your TV and connect your playbar to the audio output of your TV.  This will work but the vast majority of TVs output stereo sound so your playbar will do its best to split this into 5.1 channels.  The better way is to put a HDMI hub in between your TV and devices and connect the digital audio out of that to your playbar.  It may take some configuring on your game console to ensure your game is outputting 5.1 dolby digital (and not DTS)."

sonos,3b8y9y,phillip_u,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"No change.  I've dug deeper into it and the underlying problem isn't obviously / directly networking related. First the app frees a value that was never malloced - which is a bad enough bug in itself - and then the error handling around that doesn't handle mutexes correctly and waits for ever before exiting.  Front line support at sonos seem to be convinced it's a network issue, judging by the ""power cycle your router!"" advice they're giving, but from the stack traces that seems very unlikely.  (OK, it's possible that the original free without malloc bug is triggered by something like there being too many network interfaces or some such, but even if so that's not the cause of the bug, nor a fix.)  It's not unusable - you just have to hard kill and restart the app each time you want to use it, and the charm of the Sonos architecture is that you can do that without interrupting the music or losing a current play list. But it's a fairly crappy user experience."
sonos,3b8y9y,phillip_u,2,Thu Jul 2 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  My use case is such that I almost never even leave the app running because the music keeps playing.

I'm betting the will have Sonos integration by the time the trial is over. Either way, I'm not paying for a service that doesn't not integrate well into the Sonos platform. I can survive on Soundcloud, internet radio, Mixcloud, Hype Machine, etc until one of the services gets it right. Apple Music is my preference at this point due to the super cheap family plan and the tight integration with iOS. I'm not trying to change minds here..."

AirPlay provides the same essential multi-speaker sync as sonos. Will Apple put out a Beats speaker? Maybe, but I think their numerous AirPlay partners will not like that   I do think they will make airplay from android easier.  I think AirPlay has a good chance of upsetting the Sonos ecosystem."
sonos,3aasy0,DaveIsLame2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:42:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, but AirPlay really doesn't compare to Sonos. For me it was a night and day difference. AirPlay requires a source, and if it's a phone then you have to worry about what happens when you walk away with it or if you get a phone call, among other things. Secondly, I always found AirPlay to be extremely buggy. It would cut out or fail to start all the time. I don't have these problems with Sonos."

sonos,39xzdv,jswilson64,2,Mon Jun 15 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"To your secondary question, it is possible to set ""alarms"" in your Sonos controller, which will then be saved to the devices themselves.  That may not help your specific situation, as if the player's stream gets interrupted, I believe it simply stops and doesn't automatically restart until another alarm ""goes off"" (or you manually start it), but that may still be of use to start the audio if you want it at the same time each day."

sonos,39xzdv,shadowjig,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"If you are using the routers wireless and LAN interfaces you'd first need to add a different router and connect everything to it.  Then run a local PC or small server to share the music and finally get some MP3's of white noise to play.  Then you can tell Sonos where the music is on the local PC/server and it will index it for use within Sonos.  But my guess is that that's not really an option for you.  Do you rent the current router from AT&T?  If so, do they offer a list of routers that you can purchase yourself and setup?  If so, I would go with that option first and see if the weekly resets stop.  You'll at least need the new router to go with the first option I mentioned above, so it's worth a shot."
sonos,39xzdv,shadowjig,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the router is part of the internet service and has to be leased. There is no option to buy something and replace it. The upside is, I can make them keep coming out and replace it.  I'm on my second ""new"" gateway in a month."
sonos,39xzdv,Mbgt72,2,Mon Jun 15 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"So the router is broken causing the resets?  Or the firmware is updated 2-3 times a week by AT&T?  The former would seem like a hardware issue and getting them to replace the router should take care of it.  However, the latter would seem like AT&T SUCKS at updating their router software and doesn't test anything.  Honestly, I don't think I've ever ""noticed"" my ISP updating their routers, they shouldn't be doing it often and if it breaks, people know quickly."
sonos,39xzdv,thehaguys,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:52:17 2015 UTC,"I would really look into the fact that you can't ""buy your own"". I don't believe this is correct as I believe they have to give you an option of approved routers that you can purchase.   Typically a new top spec modem will run you $40-$65.   Also, regardless of whether or not ATT lets you buy a new modem or not, you 100% can buy your own router which may help your problem dramatically.   If you buy a new router, you'll simply put the ATT modem/router into a ""bridge mode"" or some sort of mode where it does not assign ip addresses anymore, ie DHCP. The new router will take care of that.   Ive found a lot of times in cases like this, it's the provided modem/router is that is screwing up the DHCP not the modem aspect and thus has to be reset. Once you take away the assigning IP's from the provided modem they tend to run much smoother.   So I'd step one try finding a good cheap router to meet your needs to buy. If my theory doesn't work then just return it after a week and call it a day.   And as an alternate option you can always use the alarm feature on Sonos which is something I love and use frequently."
sonos,39xzdv,fakename23,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"AT&T U-verse is a strange animal. I believe the ""have to let you buy your own"" router thing is for ""cable TV"" providers, which U-verse (technically) is not. It's a fiber VDSL service with VOIP and IPTV. I have heard that if you drop the TV, you can ""buy"" a gateway from AT&T. But if you have the IPTV part, you have to rent the box. It sucks.    I might try using my own router and just use the U-verse gateway as a modem, as you suggest. Any excuse to buy new hardware!"

If you add a third speaker, all it will do is play mono sound (albeit with superb sonos quality!). At worst it could create an echo. You could double up with four speakers and go quadraphonic but that's totally overkill for the size of your room, and if you place 2 speakers far enough apart you'll get the same  surround effect. I'd definitely recommend getting 2 play 3's for the size of your room, or a single play 5 (or two if you can afford it/want to annoy your neighbours)"

sonos,393bgm,svideo,0,Wed Jun 10 01:23:41 2015 UTC,Without the microphones I can't imagine that it would be that helpful.  I'd far prefer Amazon buy Sonos and add Sonos technology to every Echo speaker.
sonos,393bgm,subterraniac,2,Wed Jun 10 11:27:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant by the Echo technology.  If they did that I would put at least one speaker in every room.  They would have to do some improvements so it behaves as one coherent system rather than a bunch of single Echos, but imagine: that system could know who you are and which room you're in by the sound of your voice.  It could understand context based on that, so when you ask it stuff it could reply just in the room you're in, play music just in the room you're in.  It could keep track of you via your phone or maybe RFID tag as you move around and move your music with you.  It could enable star trek stuff like ""Alexa, where is <kid>?"" (If I could do that I'd have RFID tags implanted in the whole family!)"
sonos,393bgm,svideo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:38:25 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, occupant tracking would be awesome.  It would also allow ""follow me"" music as you move from room to room which would just be great.  Having whole-house voice response (Echo in every room) would be great from an HA perspective.  I'm already using Echo in our main room for HA control and the whole family loves it.  edit: OK I just realized that you already mentioned the follow me music thing :D"

sonos,38z4pd,kellyzdude,2,Mon Jun 8 01:49:45 2015 UTC,Congrats and Welcome!   I can't tell you how amazing the play:1 is in the bathroom. Grab a play3/5 for your kitchen (depending on size) and you'll have an amazing whole home system.
sonos,38z4pd,bananagrammick,2,Mon Jun 8 02:29:18 2015 UTC,I bought one a few weeks ago and my sister also got a set. I am listening to music all the time now and love it. Looking forward to getting a play 5 for the family room and also maybe a playbar once I get a new tv. Software/ease of use is well worth the cost.
sonos,38z4pd,bomberman447,2,Mon Jun 8 17:54:27 2015 UTC,Definitely experiment stereo pairing the play 1s too.  It's really a game changer!

Would check that before getting Play 1s. If Playbar + Sub + 2 Play 1s are connected as a surround system, I believe you won't get any sound from the rear Play 1s when streaming music."
sonos,38w0vw,dasarp,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:15:37 2015 UTC,I have this setup and depending on the quality of the recording I do get surround sound from say tune in radio. :)
sonos,38w0vw,ansedd95,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:16:44 2015 UTC,That's fair. I suppose very few streaming music services output 5.1 though.

sonos,38w0vw,dasarp,3,Sun Jun 7 17:56:51 2015 UTC,You can change the settings to have the surrounds play music at regular volume and not ambiently. Settings - room settings - living room - advanced audio - surround settings
sonos,38w0vw,DannyWood,2,Sun Jun 7 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly this, its the only issue i have. For movies i turn on the app and change to ambient. Music, switch to FULL"
sonos,38w0vw,DatBizzy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"You can set the surrounds to ""ambient "" or ""full"" when playing music.  You definitely get audio from the play:1s."
sonos,38w0vw,mjbnz,2,Thu Jun 11 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"In the sonos app you can change how your surrounds sounds. You can have it set to ambient noise, this will make the play 1s only play a little. Or you can select full, here the play 1s will be more audible a give a more surround sound."
sonos,38w0vw,MrGhostly,0,Sat Jun 20 05:28:12 2015 UTC,"That setting is called ""Music Playback"" and is only for music playback, it will not effect TV playback.  Most audio tracks are recorded in stereo, and not 5.1, so normal the surrounds will not be used when playing music.  Setting the Surrounds to ""Full"" makes it so the Surround Speakers play the full audio of a track. Effectually making the Surround Speakers act like normal speaker when playing music.  If set to ambient, the Surround Speakers will do very little during since they are acting like 5.1 surround speakers."

sonos,37yw7f,sev45day,3,Sun May 31 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"After doing some more research I started to have some concerns that I may have bit off more than necessary given my wants and needs.   Try it and see if you're happy with the sound. If you think you could've got a better receiver + surround setup for less money, then return it.   Are the other features worth it?   Do you ever listen to music from places that are not your TV?   Wireless is available up there, but will it be strong enough? DO I have to have one of the units in the system hard wired?   I don't know your house, so I can't really tell you. Do you get a good wireless signal? If not, hard wire or bridge it."

If you think you could've got a better receiver + surround setup for less money, then return it.   Well said, I just bought my playbar for my Samsung TV and I was messing with all the settings and worried if it supports 5.1 etc  But all that matters is how I like the sound, and so far pretty good."
sonos,37yw7f,darwindeeds,3,Wed Jun 17 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"/u/thecw has some good comments, I just wanted to chime in on the WiFi vs hard-wired option. Until recently, it apparently wasn't possible to do the home theater setup (specifically, surround sound from a Playbar, I believe) without any of the components wired to Ethernet for some reason.  That restriction has been lifted in a new beta, so if you want to give that a shot, you should sign up for the beta and see if it works. If the WiFi isn't reliable there, you may prefer to wire any one of the speakers to Ethernet.  I will comment that for a home theater system, it is at rather pricey setup, but the reviews have generally been quite positive. If you don't think it's worth it after you try it, though, you can just return it within a few weeks (depending on your store's policy, of course)."
sonos,37yw7f,apschmitz,3,Sun May 31 16:27:11 2015 UTC,"Sonos is expensive.  As others have said here you're getting a premium product at just such a price. Could you have gotten more sound from another system for less money? yes. The speakers would not be wireless, nor would they stream the array of things that Sonos does. The wouldn't be built as well and will not offer the ease of use that Sonos can. These systems will also not be as flexible as the Sonos system can be as it's able to split apart and function completely separately.   I find Sonos to be most valuable when adding other rooms. Maybe the home theater piece isn't completely worth it but adding a speaker to your kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom make it all worth it as a complete sound solution for your home.  There isn't anyone here who can tell you that it's money well spent or not. That is up to you alone.   As others have said, the Boost is the best way to go for extending the wireless Sonos network."
sonos,37yw7f,bananagrammick,5,Sun May 31 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"This guy knows. Everything he's said completely represents my own experience with my new Sonos system. I'll add that the ability to have a sound system with such good sound and WITHOUT the need for a massive amplifier and cables everywhere is a dream come true. I got rid of a shit-ton of unnecessary equipment and, resultantly, got rid of a lot of unnecessary furniture and clutter in my living space. Now, my 70"" is mounted, with my Playbar, on an articulating mount, and all the stuff I had to stick underneath it before is just gone. Sonos has a lot of great features, but my favorite might just be the space I reclaimed in three different rooms."
sonos,37yw7f,oneanddoneforfun,3,Mon Jun 1 12:11:11 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that for a 5.1 home theater experience that doesn't take advantage of a multiple room set, it's not really a premium product.  In fact, it's an inferior product to many 5.1 systems that cost a fraction of the price.  It doesn't support DTS and converts 5.1 digital to PCM stereo if your TV doesn't support optical audio pass through."
sonos,37yw7f,icerink,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:16:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I have a Playbar only setup in our TV room, and for that, it works great.  If true surround sound was important for me, I'd get a traditional HT system and add a CONNECT if I wanted the Sonos integration.  It would be cheaper with the benefit of not having to worry about which TV supports 5.1 over optical, do I need an optical switch, etc.     Yes, you would need to run more wires so it's more work up front but worth it in the end."
sonos,37yw7f,YankeeATZ,2,Wed Jun 3 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. Good feedback.  I understand no one can make this decision for me, and I have no problem spending the money if the system is worth it. I jumped on it without doing as much research as I might normally because I got (what I think is) a great deal. Playbar, Sub, and 2x Play 1 for ~$1600 (including a $150 merch card at the store, which I will use for other components). And I already knew the system has great reviews and sounded fantastic in the store.  I want a great sounding system (surround) for Movies/TV, I want wireless, I want the option of pumping music through it. If I get all these things with no issues I will be happy with the purchase. I just hope there's not an aspect that I am not aware of which will limit the products value to me personally.  In any case, one issue that keeps popping up is lack of support for DTS. What I can't seem to get a handle on is what this means to me. No sound? Bad sound? I'll keep trying to figure that out.  Thanks again"
sonos,37yw7f,bananagrammick,2,Sun May 31 20:46:45 2015 UTC,"I think with the goals you outlined you will be very happy with the system and will hopefully end up being money well spent for you. If it ends up not being the right system for you, as others have said, hopefully you can return without hassle.   As far as DTS goes I believe the answer is no sound but I can't test it right now as I don't have a playbar at home. The official language used from sonos is:  If DTS is a requirement for you, there are some straightforward ways to get the audio playing on your system by transcoding DTS to Dolby Digital. Note that your TV must be capable of passing a Dolby Digital signal through its optical port.   Certain Blu-ray players are capable of converting DTS to Dolby Digital output during playback. Some players capable of this conversion are the Samsung BD-F6500, Samsung BD-F5900, and Samsung BD-F5700. In addition, the Xbox One can transcode DTS to Dolby Digital 5.1. More information for setting up the Xbox One can be found here.   Also here is the link to the official DTS thread which may contain more information: https://ask.sonos.com/sonos/topics/please_add_support_for_dts_for_the_sonos_playbar    Either way, let us know how it all goes. We like pictures of new setups! Welcome to the community."

sonos,37yw7f,Laoracc,1 point,Sun May 31 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"straightforward    I think their definition of this is different than mine.  My understanding is the Samsung BD players they mention only transcode DTS to DD over their optical output, not the HDMI.  So you need to connect the BD optical out to the Playbar directly (or via a optical switch, which adds complexity).  If I'm wrong and those Samsungs will transcode over their HDMI out, let me know!  Just going off what others have reported on Sonos forums."
sonos,37yw7f,icerinkslim,2,Wed Jun 3 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"You effectively got the Play:1s for free (plus the $150 card). Frankly, that's a phenomenal deal. The best ive seen, really. For comparison, Black Friday last year was offering a $50 card with the purchase of a Playbar or Bass.  I've had issues getting the Play:1s to work in surround mode with the Playbar,  without using Ethernet. Getting used to using an app for your volume, instead of a remote (this isnt true for all setups, since the Playbar can read your remotes IR codes) has been a slight learning curve. Other than that, I've had very few complaints."
sonos,37yw7f,chadtill,3,Mon Jun 1 04:36:41 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Sonos 5.1 have significant drawbacks because of the design choice (defect) to use optical audio?  My understanding is that many/most TVs do not allow for 5.1 pass through via optical.  So Sonos downgrades to PCM stereo and pipes it through the rear speakers.  Also, no DTS support.  Check Sonos Forums for more info.  Don't want to cause you anxiety, but I think Sonos is a poor choice for single room TV 5.1 unless you absolutely can't hardwire back speakers.  On the other hand, Sonos is great for whole house audio."
sonos,37yw7f,MojoCP,4,Mon Jun 1 04:38:22 2015 UTC,"Sonos is not cheap, but it's a premium product in build, features, and quality.  Ultimately, if you're not a audiophile, chances are a cheaper system would meet your needs of surround sound for your TV.  I'm guessing something as simple as Vizio's 5.1 system would meet your needs ($350).  I have the same setup as you plus a Play:3 in the bedroom.  It's a lot of money, but it was basically a splurge on having a nice quality premium product.  I believe it's possible to go all Wifi using the beta release, but I would personally just get the Boost."
sonos,37yw7f,10weight,11,Sun May 31 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I'd call Sonos ""audiophile"" equipment, as such people would undoubtedly have the skills and means to assemble a superior dedicated system, complete with speaker placement balancing adjustments, EQ adjustments, etc. to suit the listening environment perfectly.  What we have here is the ability to get very very good quality audio with absolute minimization of common hurdles to actually enjoying your system (setup hassle, finicky controls, long multi step start up process, educating family on use of system)  What good is a nice setup if you're only using it sparingly? You will enjoy your Sonos much more frequently than such a system, and perhaps in more places."
sonos,37yw7f,Delbitter,2,Sun May 31 19:50:59 2015 UTC,Nice setup. Buy a bridge and CRANK DAT. All anxiety will melt away.
sonos,37yw7f,Martytoof,2,Mon Jun 1 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"I have the same set up plus a play:5 and another play:3 in other rooms.   Yes, it is a premium price and if you go over to r/hometheater you will see people slating SONOS for its cost. For me though, SONOS is a lot like Apple. I like good sound and an easy to use product that is well built. I have no idea about technicalities of sound systems and don't have the skills to hard wire a 5.1 system into the lounge therefore I went for this setup.   Things I love:   The app is great and super simple to use. This includes setting up! My wife can use it easily! She puts on the SONOS in kitchen while im listening to Lounge system. Looks great! Sound amazing! Well built   Things I'm not so keen on:   Cost Need a boost. I had to get a boost for mine but it was not a huge extra cost and does take away pressure from the router's network. You need to use it for music. In your case it seems like it may just be used with the TV and quite honestly, it would be overkill for that purpose. Our lounge system is used when we stream from media server, play netflix, watch normal TV and to stream music from spotify!"
sonos,37yw7f,Bill_Money,2,Mon Jun 1 07:46:58 2015 UTC,"I'm investing in the Sonos ecosystem because I like having central control over everything. Right now I have the 5.0 setup (missing Sub), but I plan to expand to bedroom, den, and bathroom speakers so it made sense to me to drop money for what is essentially a nice 5.0 system right now (playbar, two P:3s).   The features alone are worth the price for me. Ability to control the system from any device in the house (even my old iPad 1 came out of retirement to act as a Sonos controller). Hooking the system into the music collection on my NAS without any fuss, local radio stations, and google play streaming are so convenient that it's ridiculous.  There are likely cheaper solutions which will accomplish what you want, but in my case I was happy to pay for a known quantity that would do what I wanted and have room to expand.  About the only thing I dislike with the 5.0 system is that I can't easily ungroup the playbar from the P:3s to play music on the 3s and have TV running from the playbar. Sometimes I don't need a full 5.0 and I'd give up the rear channels to play music if I've got a video game going through the playbar, for example. Just a small nitpick."
sonos,37yw7f,Twymx,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:40:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. After some soul searching, I ended up returning the Sonos and went with a more traditional 5.1 setup in the room with an Onkyo AVR and Klipsch speakers. You can read more here if you're interested.   In the end all I really wanted was a theater system, all the other connectivity features just don't matter to me right now, add that to the DTS discussion and the price, it just wasn't for me. The wireless aspect really is a discriminator for the Sonos though, I wish there were more wireless options."
sonos,37yw7f,MooMaddy,2,Sat Jun 20 03:23:37 2015 UTC,Honestly you probably could have done a receiver + 5.1 speakers + Sonos connect for around the same price which would be better on the sound depending on the speakers you chose.

sonos,37q8y6,Twymx,2,Fri May 29 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"Multiple rooms are great to start. But the best use of 2 Play:1s is as a stereo pair. Sounds amazing. I have a pair on the fireplace mantle in my living room, and a Play:1 in each of my 2 bathrooms. So it works great as both uses, but if you have the bigger room, a stereo pair sounds great!"

While there might be different hardware versions of the Play1, you will not know when a new hardware version is available.  The only way to tell is to get it home and setup it up (then you need to compare it to another unit).  New hardware....say a Play2 might be on the horizon.  But we wouldn't know until it's available.  Sonos is a very guarded company and are extremely hush until products are launched."

sonos,37fs7a,kellyzdude,3,Wed May 27 16:18:50 2015 UTC,"Not every room in my house needs a stereo pair. I could quite happily run a Play:1 in the bedroom and a Play:1 in the dining room. The core reason I love Sonos is the multi-room synced music experience, I feel a lot of contributors to this sub either don't realize or don't take advantage of that enough and only want to get a surround setup for their TV.  The key is ""Starter set"" -- can always expand/upgrade/replace/reuse later."
sonos,37fs7a,10weight,-4,Wed May 27 17:06:56 2015 UTC,"Let's agree to disagree... When music is recorded there is an assumption that people listening will have a good listening environment, which is almost never true.   The way music is mastered assumes that people will listen to music through a shitty mono speaker but also appreciates that there could be people with a semi-decent set up.  Mono sucks. Even a single Play 5 is mono in practice as you need speakers separated further than your ears for OK separation.   Ideally (don't want to get in to details) each speaker will be a point of an equilateral triangle with your head being the third point.  So, yes not every room needs one because the listener doesn't want optimal sound.  However the flip side is that for someone looking for a representation of the sound the artist and engineers would like you to hear, a single Play Anything is sub optimal.  EDIT: in addition, a 'starter' should be a stereo pair. What Sonos is selling is a 'starter' into their extremely convenient but insanely over-priced speakers. It's like, IMHO, buying a car that can only turn in one direction."
sonos,37fs7a,kellyzdude,3,Wed May 27 17:23:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. While I'm a fan of audio, and definitely appreciate quality stereo, I don't necessarily agree that every room in the house needs an optimal Stereo balanced configuration. If you're going for perfection, it's really only perfect in one place anyway, so if you sit in a different spot it will be slightly off. You're also more likely to have an existing audio setup, so buying a Connect is the more logical choice vs. two Play:1's that don't do surround on their own.  For me, it comes back to the reason why I'm buying Sonos -- the near-perfect synchronization of audio output throughout the system. I can walk from the bedroom into the bathroom, back out through the kitchen to the living room and then down to the basement and never be out of sync. Or I can separate the basement and listen to my heavy rock while the wife has the upstairs to herself listening to NPR, and then separate the bedroom so that the ambient noises can play for the little one in an effort to keep her asleep a little longer.  The audio quality in each room may not be perfect, but I save the better setups for the rooms I spend more time caring about the sound quality in.  So now I'm wondering, when is this deal coming to the US?"

sonos,37eyjd,DomPhotography,6,Wed May 27 03:20:23 2015 UTC,The audio is going to be out of sync.  If you want Sonos speakers to play TV audio then you need a Sonos playbar (then you can add other Sonos speakers). Any other method isn't going to work without hacking and probably won't work well
sonos,37eyjd,Christofftofferson,3,Wed May 27 05:43:22 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer, the input port on all Sonos's have a delay for re-encoding of the signal that causes video sync issues. The exception to this is the Sonos Playbar which can input a digital toslink signal with no delay."
sonos,37eyjd,MisterTwo,2,Wed May 27 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"Actually the PlayBar has a 40ms delay, but comapared to the rest of the Sonos's gear at 70ms, 40 is pretty good.

Also, I would definitely change you audio setting to uncompressed like power78 suggests.

I'm pretty sure that none of the Sonos speakers has to be wired to your router.  If one device is wired to a router, Sonos communicates on its own wireless network.  If not, Sonos communicates on your wireless network.  There's no difference in functionality between the two.  At first I had just 2 Play 1 speakers and neither was connected to my router and it worked fine on my wireless."
sonos,36s848,kmcg103,3,Fri May 22 02:16:47 2015 UTC,You will need a boost I believe connected to the router. Not sure if the bridge is still available or not. Boost is much better anyway. You just need to get an optical signal to the playbar. Not sure if roku has that or not. You could go from your TV to the playbar with optical but not all TVs output 5.q signal over optical unless you are using the built in tuner or apps. Still doable though with an HDMI switch if needed. Each playbar can work independently if given two different optical sources so 2 rokus or 2 TVs is what I assume you are doing. They will act as completely separate zones and can play independently or grouped to play the same thing. And you can add a sub anytime. Just like you can add any other Sonos player at any point down the road
sonos,36s848,Twymx,2,Thu May 21 20:21:17 2015 UTC,You won't need any kind of Boost with the newest beta update (5.4 I believe). So that should save you some money!

sonos,36mzzw,ryanscott6,1 point,Wed May 20 15:59:12 2015 UTC,If you are only getting the Connect for your turntable I would look in to using the a Play5 for line in instead. That way you can use it for not only your turntable but also another speaker. That is unless you were planning on keeping your own speakers for the connect  I currently run my turntable in to a Play5 and have no complaints :)
sonos,36mzzw,defybass,1 point,Wed May 20 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"I have play 5's everywhere.  I can't imagine downgrading to a 1 or 3.  Go to BestBuy and listen to them individually to make sure they will be what you need.  Maybe even buy one to test.  You're talking close to $1800 for a SoundBar, 4 play1's, and a Connect.  Personally, I think the convenience of Sonos is to get synced music in a room with one device.  I think 2 play1's, soundbar, and connect are expensive to outfit one room with Sonos.  I suggest, getting 2 play5's (one for kitchen and bedroom) and a Connect (connected to 5.1 system in Living Room) which will cost about $1200.  You can find deals on 5.1 systems pretty easily these days without spending too much.  I suggest starting here and expand as necessary."

sonos,36g1r8,teknubic,0,Tue May 19 07:08:18 2015 UTC,"I have this configuration for my projector setup, as well, and it performs very well compared to my old 2.1 cone setup.  There was some funny business when I hooked them up the first time because the instructions are ambiguous. I connected the optical and tried pairing the playbar to the sub wirelessly but it said I needed a $100 boost bridge to do that. I connected the playbar and the sub with ethernet; same thing. Then I connected the playbar to the ethernet switch and only then the sub paired.   I would like to see some more configurations documented somewhere. It seems the ones available push you into buying equipment you don't actually need."
sonos,36g1r8,Delbitter,1 point,Tue May 19 14:41:43 2015 UTC,I have the boost actually as I was worried about pushing my net too much with all the wireless activity we were sendings its way. It was not too simple to set up with the boost as I had some issues too (I have two play 5s and a play 3 as well). All in all I found it pretty easy and sounds great but all at a cost!
sonos,36g1r8,Kllian,1 point,Tue May 19 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, a playbar is a must for the TV.  The playbar comes with an eq setting for speech enhancement.   The playbar also makes it easy to control the IR volume for the TV.  The playbar has an optical in, the play5 has an aux input.  If you decide to use a Play3, you need something to connect the TV to the sonos network like a Connect."

I was always dealing with 2 different remotes and powering on the HT receiver and toggling between devices and volume settings.  I must say this is much more seamless and the way to go.  I have 2 play1's but keep them as their own zones as well as a Play5.  I'm pretty much done with my system as I have more than enough for the size of my house.    My friend has a Playbar and loves it on his TV, but really wants the sub and will be getting one soon.  Neither of us have the need for 5.1.  I may toy with it but only on occassion."

sonos,36bqwi,Twymx,1 point,Mon May 18 18:22:34 2015 UTC,It's fine. I totally agree. I knew it had an input but I didn't realise it was only optical. I've only got the connect and a mate has a 5 so I know they both have line in. So I Just assumed playbar was the same.
sonos,36bqwi,jrddit,1 point,Mon May 18 21:12:18 2015 UTC,Yes you have two options. The Connect will allow you to connect RCA from your pre-amp and then play it on your other Sonos speakers. It also has RCA out that can go into an amplifier or powered speakers and those also become part of your Sonos setup.   The other option is the Connect Amp. It also allows you to connect a line in device via RCA and make it part of your Sonos setup. This unit is an amplifier as well and can power a set of speakers using just speaker wire.   I suppose a third option is to also get a Play 5 that has a line in option as somebody else mentioned. I don't have one of those though so I can't speak to it as well. I have both a Connect and Connect Amp.

The turntable I'm adding has a built in preamp.  It seems silly to me not to get the Play 5 for 50 dollars more than the Connect.  Does getting the Play 5 make sense or am I over thinking this and stick with the Connect?  Thank you in advance for your help and advice."
sonos,36bqwi,Laugh_Now,2,Mon May 18 18:11:36 2015 UTC,"The way I think about it, it really only makes sense to get the Connect if you already have (or are planning to get) a set of speakers that's better than the Play 5. The Play 5 is my main speaker for listening to records on, and it's much better than the speaker I was using for it before.  My next purchase is going to be a Playbar.

First you have to set up one main router to be the DHCP server and the main network with an SSID.  Next step is to set up each extender (im assuming you have powerline adapters with wireless AP's built in). For each extender, turn off DHCP and set the SSID and security (authentication type and passcode) exactly the same as the main router. If you do this, the whole house will be one big network and devices will handoff as you walk through the house. The Sonos (and any other devices like your iphone) should connect all over the house."

sonos,35uspp,rjgw,2,Wed May 13 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm maybe I'm wrong in my terminology, but I see that the play:1 has one mid-woofer and one tweeter, so my conclusion is that the left and right channels have to go through the same speaker, ""flattening"" the sound.   The play:3 has two mid-range drivers so when it's oriented horizontally will separate the L and R channels."
sonos,35uspp,Twymx,6,Wed May 13 19:13:55 2015 UTC,You are correct. Technically a single Play:1 is mono. A Play:3 is stereo when placed horizontally. If you orient it vertically it becomes mono (meant for when stereo pairing with another Play:3)
sonos,35q7zv,whodun,7,Tue May 12 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"The connect has an analog output, to connect to an external amplifier. It also has a digital output for connection to a stereo/surround receiver. Lastly, it has an analog input, so you can make your PC/Mac/CD player/AV system/record player/Airport Express a source on your Sonos system, available across all zones. The Play:1 can do none of those things. They are two separate devices for two separate functions really. One is designed to be integrated with higher end amplification, the other to stand alone as rears in a surround config, a single unit, or a stereo pair."

I imagine the speaker series share components (such as ports and chipset) so can probably get them a lot cheaper than the ones they have to have for the connect additionally they don't sell as many connects so maybe have to make smaller batches (at higher costs).

sonos,35hn1r,cloughie,2,Sun May 10 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"Without having tried it myself, the ways I've considered fixing this problem before are:   Using a WiFi router in ""client bridge"" mode to attach to the wifi, then plugging the Sonos into it with Ethernet.  Attaching a laptop should allow you to authorize the MAC of the router which will implicitly give the Sonos Internet.  Problem is that you need multicast to control it, so devices not connected behind the router's NAT can't connect to the Sonos.  You need to re-broadcast your own wifi if you want that to work - it seems you can buy devices that do simultaneous client/access point wifi, as I've posted before on this topic, the TP Link ""WISP Client"" mode might work, I've not tested it personally. Spoofing the Sonos' MAC address to authorize it.  Should work, except if the wifi network has client isolation, in which case even once your phone and Sonos are connected they won't be able to talk to each other.  If client isolation is off, anyone would be able to steal control of the Sonos from you.   If there's any option to have your own wifi network it will always be the option you want to take in this scenario."

sonos,35c8z5,iamthespyorami,1 point,Fri May 8 22:54:58 2015 UTC,you can configure it to join your wifi with the sonos software (do this before you unplug is obviously)
sonos,35c8z5,Bill_Money,2,Fri May 8 23:15:59 2015 UTC,When you set it up on your phone it copies our wifi setting from your phone. I'm assuming your phone is connected to wifi
sonos,35c8z5,thecw,2,Fri May 8 23:49:27 2015 UTC,It uses wifi auto-discovery to set up an ad-hock network for initial configuration. The Sonos app tells your phone where it is. It's the same technology that powers AirDrop and Handof on Apple machines.
sonos,35c8z5,Christofftofferson,1 point,Sat May 9 13:26:01 2015 UTC,If this is your second Sonos then it will use the mesh network (sonosnet) created by the 1st Sonos you already had set up.

sonos,34zoyi,nickdanger3d,3,Tue May 5 22:41:51 2015 UTC,"Well you said you were offline, not that you were connected to your phone :P  Sonos doesn't have an AirPlay or chrome cast style way to send stuff to the speakers, the phone app connects directly to your device's audio. But it does have upnp so you could use a raspberry pi or other computer running airsonos, an open source AirPlay adapter to bridge that. Or if you have android there's probably a way to route your phone's whole audio to the upnp server, I know there's a way to do that for AirPlay speakers anyway."
sonos,34zoyi,shadowjig,2,Wed May 6 00:07:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I was a bit snarky. I should have been more specific.  The Sonos is inside our boat and we cruise the Bahamas for a month or two at a time where data is expensive.  Our boat has a Wi-Fi network, so devices can communicate with the Sonos just fine.  I plan on expanding our Sonos system as long as I get the user experience we are looking for.  I did a bit of searching this afternoon.  Apparently there are apps available to send the android audio directly to the Sonos, but require the android to be rooted.  Then... I discovered Google Play Music.  Turns out I can just click on the ""casting"" icon and select which Sonos speakers to play it to.  Perfect!  Looks like I can play downloaded tracks offline too, so it might be time to switch from Beats to Google Play Music. :)"

See Sonos Support for instructions on setting it up.  What I did with my playbar is to get an optical switcher, I think I ordered this one. Using this, the TV outputs 5.1 from OTA channels, I have my PS3 outputting 5.1, and the chromecast I only get stereo from unfortunately."
sonos,34k4zo,171819,1 point,Fri May 1 22:18:15 2015 UTC,Your TV will only output 2 channel for HDMI sources. I have my Xbox and TV on an optical switch so I can switch to audio for the TV apps.

sonos,34k4zo,KG_Inc,1 point,Sat May 2 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"I've run into this issue with a handful of my customers who've done the setup you described.   Samsung's do not output 5.1 audio as I found out the hard way. You'll have to play around with the audio settings on your cable box if you want to get 5.1. And even then, it won't be true 5.1.   When you set up the audio within the Sonos app, ensure that in your settings the audio is set to full vs ambient. That's generally taken care of the problems for my clients."
sonos,34k4zo,swingbaby,-1,Tue Jun 2 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"Edit at top: it seems you CAN use a connect:amp!  You cannot use Playbar and connect:amp in a 5.1 system.  The only way to run a 5.1 system with a Playbar is to mate it (group it) with the sub and a pair of Play1 or Play3 for the rears.  So, that is your first problem that is insurmountable for your purposes.  I will let others speak to the DD+ issue.  I run PCM out of my TV optical and into the Sonos 5.1 I have (Playbar, sub, pair of Play1), and while I cannot attest to it being TRUE surround, the rear channels are definitely putting out a surround rear channel discrete left and right signal to the Play1's.  That is playing Netflix through my Roku.  Good luck!"
sonos,34k4zo,Twymx,2,Fri May 1 21:39:57 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you can use a connect or connect amp as surrounds for the playbar but I'd contact Sonos Support to make sure. Also dolby digital 5.1 is supported but DTS is not. Hope this helps.
sonos,34k4zo,Twymx,2,Fri May 1 21:58:42 2015 UTC,Also about your pass through concern... most TVs will output 5.1 from their own sources. So netflix on the TV should work. I'm not sure if it will pass through 5.1 from hdmi. That's a tough question to answer. There is a page on Sonos support website that lists some TVs that do pass through 5.1 but it is far from an exhaustive list. Worst case scenario you can get a $50 hdmi/tos switcher. That's what I use to get all my sources 5.1 signal to my playbar

SmartRules is great because it's a simple interface for putting together rules (Example: IF both phones leave house, AND it is between 7-9am M-F, THEN turn all Sonos speakers off).  I'm also waiting to take delivery on a set of Flic Wireless Smart Buttons which will either work directly with Sonos, or act as a trigger through SmartThings.

Additionally, you can use Sonos speakers as a verbal alert system with SmartThings alarms -- for example, if any of the water leak sensors in my house trigger, all the Sonos speakers will speak an alarm message indicating such.  Or, if I am in ""Home - Overnight"" mode, and any of our door sensors trip I can have just the Sonos in our master bedroom state ""A door has been opened!"""

sonos,32rwk3,Twymx,2,Thu Apr 16 13:11:51 2015 UTC,Do you use Stitcher? Can you tell me how to listen to anything but the most recent episode of a podcast? I tried for like 20 minutes.
sonos,32rwk3,JustPraxItOut,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:59:09 2015 UTC,Sorry I haven't used stitcher yet myself. I knew it was on Sonos but didn't realize it was for podcasts until just a week or so ago. There may be a limited to how back you can go. That doesn't seem unreasonable.
sonos,32rwk3,jaymz668,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"I think it seems unreasonable. :) And it's not a limitation in the Stitcher mobile app.  Joking aside, RSS feeds have been around since 1999.

sonos,32rwk3,brandonmat,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"This can be done!  It's totally non-intuitive, but I just figured out how to do this a few days ago.  My scenario - I wanted to add the NPR show ""Wait Wait! Don't Tell Me"" into Sonos ... but given that they are a weekly show they have a tendency to throw little 3-minute snippets in from previous shows into their RSS feed every couple days.  So, it was frustrating when I went to Stitcher to try to add it ... and all I could get was a 3-minute clip from a few days ago with Paula Poundstone ranting about passwords.  Here's how I think[1] I did it:   Go into Stitcher Go to ""Stations"" Hit the magnifying glass on top Change the type from ""Stitcher All"" to ""Podcasts & Shows"" (this probably doesn't make a difference, but can't hurt) Search[2] for your show   That should get you there.  I'm not sure if you can auto-play through all of the shows in a feed ... but you can select past episodes.  So, here's the [2] caveat above ... the ""Search"" is somewhat broken.  You may or may not find your show this way - there's something weird about single word versus multi-word show titles, etc.  This caused a problem for me when I wanted to add ""Planet Money"" in as a podcast ... it couldn't find it.  My solution was to find the feed description text and pick out a rather unique word to search on.  They use the word ""brainy"" in their show description ... so I searched on that, and it worked!  [1] I'm just walking through this on my iPhone right now, trying to remember the steps.  It definitely wasn't intuitive how I did it ... so hopefully I'm remembering right, but I'm hear to tell you that it can be done!  Good luck!"

sonos,32rwk3,maracle6,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:08:48 2015 UTC,"I use Pocket Casts for Android and I can never get the podcasts to appear in my Sonos app. There is a setting in Pocket Casts called ""Allow apps to see episodes"", but that doesn't seem to do anything for Sonos. I sort of suspect this issue might arise because I store my podcasts on an SD card instead of in the system memory, but I could be wrong.  Pocket Casts allows for casting to my TV's Chromecast, so it would be great if I could do something similar with Sonos. It would allow me to more easily manage what I've already listened to and pick up where I left off on podcasts I've already started."
sonos,32rwk3,guicane,2,Thu Apr 16 17:47:54 2015 UTC,"It works for me. I believe you have to change the directory you save your podcasts into. Go to settings, storage, then store podcasts on ""Custom Folder"". Custom folder location ""/storage/emulated/0/Podcasts""."

You will get phenomenally better sound on your budget by using a Connect and getting 'real' speakers.  I have a stereo pair of Play 5s with a Sub and a Play 3 in a room that's about 30 x 20 feet and yes, it's crisp but it cost me circa £1,500.  I have a single pair of KRK Rokit 8s upstairs with a £100 Audio interface into my PC and while they obviously don't have the same power and can't compete on the extreme low bass the detail beats the shit out of Sonos. They are far more enjoyable to listen to and the set up cost me around £400."
sonos,32oq1e,10weight,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:19:24 2015 UTC,do you mean getting a connect:amp as getting a connect you would still need to buy the receiver/amp to power the speakers.

All you need is a computer but not sure how convenient you could make this (hence Sonos has a business model).

I've been using cast with the GPM app since I bought my Play5 a year ago and it's been great, certainly pushed me toward their monthly subscription over Pandora/Spotify/etc.  The most glaring omission at the moment is you can't do the same from Chrome on the desktop with GPM's web interface and the Cast extension but hopefully they will add that."

As can be seen here, Sonos is choosing not to integrate Spotify Connect.   Hey there, Thank you for the feedback. Spotify has a way of doing this called Spotify Connect which we aren't currently planning on supporting.   -- Jeff S, Official Rep   Second: Spotify has an API and it is not closed. Sonos could add more features to the Sonos app with the currently available Spotify API. Have a look for yourself: Web API Endpoint Reference Take a good look at Get a list of featured playlists, Get a list of categories and, Get a category's playlists.

I did press on with a trial subscriptions to Rdio and it does seem to work closer to what I had imagined: Being able to select a genre, playlist or station and from there, having the service recommend or find music that fits my preferences.   Though, I will certainly check out Slacker and Songza as free alternatives.   As a hoarder of MP3's, i'm still not sure how I feel about subscription music services,  but I'm certainly willing to give it a whirl.  The Sonos 5 unit itself has been pretty good.   Initially I wasn't too pleased with the sound, but after a few hours, it's starting to sound alright.   I supposed this is due to being so used to my 2 channel setup in my office which I spend the majority of my time listening to."

I even  considered returning my Play5, but I found out, that the Sonos app is OK-ish for me.   It would be so much better if we could use Spotify Connect, but honestly? I assume, Spotify is too demanding. I don't get why they don't make Connect a free API, it would only boost Spotifys sales. Of course we don't get any details on their deals, but I suspect Spotify wants exclusivity. Since Sonos is very popular and rather pricey, I assume, they could just spend the money to get Spotify Connect. But if that would require them to drop other services? If I was Sonos, that would make me refuse Spotifys demands.  But I really, really wish Sonos would reskin their desktop apps. The Android app is pretty nice but the Windows app looks amateurish and the MacOSX app gives you eye cancer. Some investment into a new UI (or two new UIs for Win and Mac), would make the user experience so extremely much better.  The existing functionality isn't that bad, it doesn't look as sleek as the native apps but is sufficient. It only hurts badly to use it on desktops and that frustrates me, because it looks like every other startup can hire a designer but Sonos skimps on this."

Sonos will say ""Well, Spotify has a much larger user base than we do."" Which is true, they have a much larger user base than anyone else.... and it is exactly why they should be bending over backwards for their support.  All it will take to get the Sonos world to come crumbling down is someone big, like Samsung, to lock in exclusivity with Spotify. (The Spotify subscriber base of about 12.5 million users is 3.5 times as big as Pandora's subscriber base of 3.5 million.)"

You can adjust it later as well if it is too high or low for you  It definitely adds a lot if you are able to feed Dolby Digital to the Playbar.

sonos,32fwsa,mattsmith428,3,Mon Apr 13 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"I also have player + 2 pay 1's - for my room, it works great.  The biggest determining factor is the space your in. I had to put the surround volume to ~70% for it to feel right (this is under the advanced room setup in settings)."
sonos,32fwsa,celosia89,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:28:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing your findings.  I've asked another commenter this as well as I couldn't find anything online: is there anything that specifies how far the rear speakers should be positioned from each other?
sonos,32fwsa,Kllian,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:32:40 2015 UTC,As part of the configuration you can specify the distance you are from the speakers.  It's not rocket science (if I recall correctly there are 3 settings).  Definitely not a highly-sophisticated setup BUT it worked for my needs.
sonos,329gez,BCent,2,Sat Apr 11 20:04:38 2015 UTC,You would need a DAC & it might not sound right. I wouldn't recommend it. You're better off getting a playbar

sonos,3292o7,jossdude,2,Sat Apr 11 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"I have a play 5 and play 3 in opposite corners of an open kitchen/living room in my cottage, and it doesn't sound strange at all, it actually sounds and works really great.  The room is about 15 ft x 25 ft, so it's a decent size, but not huge.  I started with a single play 5, but to hear it in the kitchen, it had to be turned up and then it was too loud in the living room, so we added a Play 3 in the kitchen.  There was no space in the room (or budget) for a 2nd play 5.  They can not be stereo paired, but I find it works better that way.  The 3 is by the kitchen table so if we are eating at the table, we turn the 5 up a bit louder.  The 5 is in the living room area, so if I'm in there, I bump up the volume on the 3.  Once I set up the eq on them both, if you stand in the middle of the room, you wouldn't know they are different speakers.  Besides, I think the 1 is just 1/2 of the 5 minus the subwoofer.  I think they use the same woofer and tweeter combo.  Besides, you can always pick up a speaker and try it out, you've got nothing to loose!"

sonos,31r6mx,answerguru,7,Tue Apr 7 20:07:27 2015 UTC,Sonos isn't at fault for this. Trust me when I say point the pitchforks at Spotify. They won't release the new API for their latest integration because they think they can do a better job or something. Sonos has gone on record stating they're doing everything they can but are getting strong armed by Spotify just like everyone else who wants Spotify on their devices.
sonos,31r6mx,arethius,2,Tue Apr 7 22:36:18 2015 UTC,I understand (and agree) and have researched the issue a bit.   I'm just miffed that it doesn't work period.  Spotify is being a total ass.    My hope is their other platforms won't be strong performers and they'll cave to reality.   Bastards.

sonos,31r0i7,Rimbodie,3,Tue Apr 7 14:17:33 2015 UTC,I have this setup and it sounds incredible.   The sub adds a punch and richness to the mix. I use the pair of play5 as a stereo pair in a room about 25x20 and it creates a nice blended sound throughout (meaning you don't sit there feeling like one speaker is blasting in your face).   You won't be disappointed. Especially at $500 purchase point. Worst case you have 45 days without obligation
sonos,31oky7,kenbonowitz,3,Mon Apr 6 22:48:37 2015 UTC,So you can't pair 5's w/ a sub or playbar only w/ each other.  Play 1's & 3's can be paired w/ playbar and/or sub
sonos,31oky7,Bill_Money,2,Mon Apr 6 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for setting me straight on that. So take back the 5's, get 3's. Use the difference saved to purchase a playbar or a sub....which do you think I should go with?"
sonos,31oky7,Bill_Money,4,Mon Apr 6 23:25:10 2015 UTC,I would tell you to get the Playbar w/ two 1's as rears. If you can get the sub too.  Remember you need a boost as well if you want to add play 1's or 3's as rears and/or a sub to a playbar

Knowing Sonos (not really) I doubt they would go for this and I really doubt Amazon would go for it. I think Amazon would rather make upgraded models and compete, it already has support to stream on Amazons music services and has a few internet streaming services supported. Personally I think Sonos should add microphones to all units across the board even if there is no plan to use them any time soon."

It does well but it won't separate out the center channel from the left and right quite as well as if you sent a 5.1 signal to it. Same issue with the sub. It does a great job and sounds great, but it will sound even better if you get a 5.1 signal to it.   I had the same issue with my TV. It didn't ouput 5.1 from outside sources. So I bought a $50 HDMI switch and I have my 3 sources (cable box, PS3, WiiU) coming in to the switch with HDMI, then one HDMI out to my TV, and one optical to the Playbar.

sonos,31bknf,Twymx,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:26:21 2015 UTC,I believe that should work. I use one from monoprice. A logic tech remote should be able to learn the switch remote I would think and the playbar will work with just about any remote I believe. The playbar does try to make things easier it's just that the TV manufacturers don't all output 5.1 unfortunately. I'm not sure why. The Sonos support website has a list of TVs that should work with it well if you need it. Don't have the url handy on my phone.

However, if using the PLAYBAR independently, without a SUB and/or rear speakers, you can connect it directly to your router's wireless network. This will allow the Sonos PLAYBAR to work with Sonos applications for control. Your network must have a high-speed Internet connection, as the Sonos system is designed to provide you with online software updates. Your Sonos system must be registered to receive these updates, so be sure to register during the setup process.

The fact that they've taken a decent amount of Private Equity money means that they likely don't have much longer before they go public in an IPO.  I think that's significant, and will likely lead to a much larger marketing presence, potentially more frequent updates/upgrades, and hopefully the same commitment to quality.

However there are some acceptable (depending on your expectations) work arounds/alternatives. Here's what I did: I push everything through optical out of the TV. I split the optical - one to the full 5/7.1 receiver, and the other to an RCA converter which goes to Sonos connect, which is also fed into the receiver. This way, if I just leave the input on receiver on the Sonos, I get TV sound through Sonos (also giving the added benefit I can listen to TV on any Sonos room). When I really want to hear true 5.1 (movies and stuff) I switch the input on the receiver to the optical input. It's not quite the clean solution I'd like, but it works well and I don't need the true surround sound very often."

Best to lookup the reset instructions directly on the sonos site.   Once configured and updated to the latest update, you won't need a boost or have it plugged into the router.

And make sure you have a bridge/boost or you have Ethernet plugged directly in. I don't believe the play 5 supports direct wifi (only the play 1 & 3)

sonos,30dba4,thesbrown,3,Thu Mar 26 13:48:09 2015 UTC,"Just one note for you, on the hard wired bit... All you would need to do is wire 1 Sonos unit, so if you did a pair of Play:1, which ever one that was easiest to wire is all you would need to do. At that point, the second Play:1 would connect directly to your wired unit, so range wouldn't be an issue. This type of network is exactly what a Bridge or Boost would do for you as well.  Edit Note: Also, Play:5 is capable of stereo on it's own, since it has 5 drivers, so there's no ""lack"" if you go with just that. (I have 2x Play:5, 4x Play:1 and I love them all)"
sonos,30dba4,wimpitron,2,Thu Mar 26 19:44:46 2015 UTC,Sounds to me like you would miss the line in more than the stereo separation. Go with the Play:5. Once you are bitten by the Sonos bug it will start duplicating on it's own anyway!

Of course, it would be a huge undertaking to build Sonos-like software from scratch, with their quality and feature set - but if you ignore all the music streaming services and primarily just want to play files from a NAS via maybe a web-based controller, and aren't too fussed about audio sync, it could be a fairly manageable project."

We upgraded because of the family plan feature. Both accounts become effective Premium accounts, verified by the lack of commercials when using Spotify elsewhere. So it definitely does work.  If I remember correctly, we did have to remove, then re-add her account. I don't know what the problem was, honestly. That's just a knee-jerk reflex for when stuff doesn't work.  I'd also double check to make sure you have the at least the 5.2 upgrade."

Play 1's 3's 5's, etc. are wireless & only require power. The Playbar (soundbar) requires an optical connection from your tv.  So if you have a receiver powering any speakers get the connect. If you do not have a receiver in that room use the connect AMP. If you have more questions let us know"
sonos,2zyxkf,Kllian,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your response - I have no receiver, so I would be going the route of the amp, which was my inclination. Would one connect amp be enough for all of those speakers?  So the connect amp allows the non-sonos speakers to be controlled within the Sonos environment, right? As in, I could use the app on my phone to play Spotify through those existing speakers?  What about using those same speakers as auxiliary speakers for my TV/BluRay? Is the audio input on the connect amp right for that job?"
sonos,2zyxkf,parkerjh,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"So for you're TV you would need either to get a receiver & connect or you would need to get a Playbar, Play Sub, & two Play 1's or Play 3's (play 5's cannot be used as surrounds) for it to sound correct as you can't set L, R, C, SL, SR, etc w/ just a connect amp.  The connect amp allows for two speakers to be connected to each amp. You could wire in them in pairs or a variety of other ways if needed. It also depends on how many speakers you actually will be connecting to each connect amp. You may need a receiver anyways depending on the wattage.   Depending on size of your home & location placement of the bridge you may want to upgrade to the new boost. Boost replaces the bridge & is twice as strong."

I have a 1 and 3 and I believe there is a big difference in output, but the I tend not to use the Play3's extra oomph because the rooms I use it don't require it (The Play1s have been perfectly adequate for me). Perhaps a paired set of Play1s would be a good option for a workout room.  I think you'd need more than 2 Play1s to justify the sub. I reckon paired Play3s and a sub would be awesome.

sonos,2zkwd6,burriko,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what you listen to. Neither of these setups has the very best bass possible (subwoofers do earn their keep), but there is no question that you get nicer low frequency sounds from the 5 than the 1. That said, there are situations where channel separation is much appreciated, and there a pair of 1s does very nicely. In the room where I use our 5, seating is such that stereo separation is less important, so one 5 is obviously a better choice.  But after a proposed renovation, that could flip around, in which case I would buy one more 1 and the subwoofer and move the 5."

sonos,2zkwd6,Kllian,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"I guess that's kind of what I'm wondering.  I'll admit, I haven't dug into the techspecs for each to understand their frequency ranges and if there is any variance, but I would expect the 5 to be able to reach a bit deeper into the bass ranges just because of its size.  The difference between the 1 and the 3 became obvious as soon as I got the 3 - that has a left and right channel right in the box.  So, I almost assume (perhaps incorrectly) that a 3 is simply two 1's together.  EDIT: So, the 5 does have an integrated woofer, so it should be able to get some better bass overall.  Not really surprising.  Here's the definition specs that Sonos lists for each:   Play:1 - One tweeter creates a crisp and accurate high frequency response.  One mid-woofer ensures the faithful reproduction of mid-range frequencies crucial for accurate playback of vocals and instruments, as well as delivery of deep, rich bass. Play:3 - 1 tweeter creates a crisp and accurate high frequency response.  2 dedicated mid-range drivers ensure the faithful reproduction of mid-range frequencies crucial for accurate playback of vocals and instruments. A bass radiator is tuned to use the energized air volume inside of PLAY:3 to provide deep, clean and surprisingly powerful bass from such a small package. Play:5 - Five driver speaker system – two tweeters, two 3” mid-range drivers, and one 3.5” woofer. Each driver of the product is individually powered by a dedicated amplifier."

It is possible to encode mono/stereo in DD. As for the boxes, (which is not covered from what you posted) If the TV Decodes DTS 5.1, then you will get stereo, if the TV just passes through the DTS, you will get NOTHING. If the TV transcodes DTS to DD (doubtful, but possible), you will get true surround. If the box can transcode DTS to DD (like @TexasTigah said, the XBox will) then you will get 5.1."

The caveat here is that the PLAY:1 and PLAY:3 do not have line-in jacks, only the PLAY:5 does for the stand-alone speakers.  The SONOS CONNECT and AMP also have line-inputs.  I've also been told that there is some latency when using the line-in jacks, so you may have audio sync issues when playing from the BenQ.

I think you should have only Play:1's in the bedrooms that you want music, and Play:3's in the other rooms. No need for a play:5.  Also, the Sonos playbar and woofer are very overpriced and overrated.  You are better off getting a better sounding home stereo system for cheaper, and if you still want it to connect to the rest of the Sonos, get the Connect."

The Connect is criminally overpriced (especially now that the Play:1 exists)   Sonos can be a great system.

And the playlists are on the Sonos.  I've already tried setting up the shared music collection for iTunes home sharing from the same location that Sonos accesses it - but quickly found out that - iTunes Home Sharing is hopeless/broken if you've got any significant amonut of music (couple of hundred albums).  From a computer, I can access the share directly, and play music via any media player - but that lacks any Sonos playlists. (A Sonos<->m3u playlist sharing/syncing tool would be fantastic)  I haven't found a nice solution for playing ALAC files from an SMB share on an iPhone yet - but there may well be something out there...."

Yeah, my Play:1s are nice, but if they hadn't given them to me for free there's no way I would use them.  I could have replicated the functionality that I actually use w/ a $40 bluetooth adapter and have saved myself $360.  Sure, there's features I wouldn't have w/ that model - moving around between rooms isn't quite as easy, can't start music on my PC and then control on a phone/tablet, etcetera, but oh well.  Instead of replacing my speakers, they are a second set of speakers that are sitting on top of my first.  If you fit into the use model that they envision, they're very useful.  If you have a more traditional use of speakers, though, they're unsuited for use unless you get the Sonos Connect or Connect:AMP.  The Playbar and Play:5 aren't good options (esp. Play:5...hi, I like actual stereo sound).  For me, I'll probably be selling the speakers that they kindly gave to me.  They aren't as nice as the ones I have, some music doesn't sound that good on them, and I really don't use them much.  What they should do is set the software up so that at least Windows Vista+, Mac and Linux can 'see' the Sonos controller as a valid audio output source, so you don't need the input connection to play to them."

Plug everything back , connect your Android device to the router and make sure you have a working internet connection and then try to pair you Sonos back again with your device . Whenever  I've had issues with my Sonos units and my Android phone or tablet this has always fixed it.

sonos,2wzxsc,YankeeATZ,2,Wed Feb 25 20:11:48 2015 UTC,However you can fool the Sonos by using a programable remote which sends the same signals. Eg: I have a harmony remote programmed to send the same tv volume up commands as my tv's remote and they both work.
sonos,2wzxsc,mekon,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:59:08 2015 UTC,If you set up the Playbar with your Dish programable remote then the Samsung remote should work as well.   I have a Samsung TV as well. After configuring the Playbar with my Comcast universal remote I was pleasantly surprised to find out that my Samsung TV remote still worked as intended.

sonos,2wckww,xot,2,Thu Feb 19 11:14:16 2015 UTC,"It's not possible, no. As others have said you can use airsonos, but it has latency of a second or two.  I've successfully used a connect: amp with a PC/TV, and the play:5 has a line in.  I believe its also fairly reliable hooking an airplay hardware device to the line in on the play:5 and connect/connect:amp"

I've got a Synology and it seems to be a bit of a complex task for someone like me with not much coding/programming chops. You mentioned Airsonos can run in a raspberry pi (which I never knew) ... Do you have any more info about that and do you know whether it'd be easier to install on that than on a Synology NAS?

Prior to this new beta, there was another service called MyMusicToMe that allowed integration but it was flaky and cost $50/year.  Now, just toggle Sonos on in Subsonic settings and it will magically appear as a music service. I have not tested extensively, but the first hour or so of listening and it was as stable as regular music library. A huge leap ahead of MMTM.  Shame that Sonos still hasn't figured out a solution without relying on a third party service. Regardless, thrilled with this new beta from Subsonic."

sonos,2vtjxk,TXCV,6,Fri Feb 13 23:39:52 2015 UTC,Short answer: yes. Long answer: if your music is stored on your computer and the computer is on this is very straightforward by using the sonos software. If it's stored on the computer and it is turned off then you won't be able to stream.   My iTunes library is stored on a NAS which solves this problem.

I don't have the optical cable plugged into the TV, but it works similarly to how I ran the HDMI cable through the wall. If the cables bother you that much I bet drilling a hole would be the best solution, but I bet it could be pretty small considering how tiny the cables are.  This is mine."
sonos,2vf4ko,SpatialFX,1 point,Tue Feb 10 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have the TV mounted. It sits on the entertainment center. If I can't elevate the TV on a small shelf, run the wires under it and push the Playbar back against the shelf the wires will be hidden"

sonos,2v6x17,Fontcrew,4,Sun Feb 8 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"Every sonos product I own has been an open box from Best Buy and I'm up to 8. My most recent play 1 I got for 139.00 and  I found a playbar they had opened and talked them down to 450.00.   Another trick at best buy anyway, if you put them on your best buy card (and pay it off of course) they have a record of your purchase and have to honor the price you bought it at before. For example, bought an open play 5 for 299 and then saw another open box later for 380. I talked to the manager and they said that was the lowest they could go, so I explained that I bought one a few months earlier for 299 and they asked if I had a receipt I said I used my best buy card so they could look it up, they did and honored that price.   I say if you have the time and patience its a great way to go.  Also ask if that's the lowest they can go, they always can go lower with the open box."

sonos,2uxxw0,COtter7,4,Fri Feb 6 02:34:11 2015 UTC,That is what the connect amp is for. Though it will be pricey if there are many speakers
sonos,2uxxw0,mezzrricki,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:04:42 2015 UTC,"To clarify a bit. It requires a Connect or Connect:amp for each ""zone"" you want to separate. Depending on the speaker specs you may be able to run 2 or 4 speakers off the Connect:Amp. If you have more speakers than that per zone you'll want to get the Connect and a separate amp."
sonos,2uxxw0,bananagrammick,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:36:58 2015 UTC,Awesome. So if there are ~8 speakers I will need the connect and a couple amps to support the speakers?
sonos,2uxxw0,drzowie,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:01:05 2015 UTC,Depends on what you want.  You can just connect 4 speakers in parallel on each terminal and you will get sound through the whole system -- but you won't be able to drive them as loud as you would if the speaker load were matched to the amplifier.
sonos,2uxxw0,ansedd95,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:38:57 2015 UTC,Well. Verify first the impedance (ohm) of your speakers. If you parallel-couple 4 speakers you might harm the Connect:amp. But if you parallell-couple two speakers together and put them in serial with to other parrallel-coupled speakers you're good to go.

If you have a receiver connected and powering the speakers then all you need is the Sonos Connect.  If you don't have anything connected to the speakers then a Connect:AMP will power up to 4 at a time.

sonos,2uh0ub,V1nD1cA7e,6,Mon Feb 2 02:36:28 2015 UTC,I think you have misunderstood the whole concept of Sonos.  The speaker system is a self contained network for playing music.  You place speakers around your home and control it via the software interface [mobile or desktop controller software].  The Sonos unit's themselves house the software to build a library of music or connect to internet for streamed music and stores it in it's database.  The Connect also contains the software that manages the music library so it can be independently activated and music streamed through your existing Stereo Equipment.  Connect:AMP also does this but has a built in amplifier.  Sonos equipment is expensive I find but I love the quality and how well it lets me move my music around the house.  What your are asking to do isn't possible as far as I know.  You would need the Connect to accomplish what you require.  I don't have one so I cannot comment on its capabilities but it should assist you unless your speakers are directly attached to the sound card on your desktop.  It's more for connecting your existing home theater to the SONOs network  I hope that helps
sonos,2uh0ub,redditphantom,1 point,Mon Feb 2 03:37:12 2015 UTC,"I think I have the concept right.  The speakers basically contain a WiFi card that allows them talk among each other and remain synced on my network.  I was just shocked that the Sonos application on my desktop computer won't utilize the speakers connected to the desktop.  That they want me to pay $350 for a box that is basically just a WiFi card.  Unless I'm mistaken, I don't see how the speaker units ""build a library of music"".  I thought the software interface [mobile or desktop controller software] connects your music library to the speakers.  I didn't think the speaker units or the Connect contains much software at all besides what is needed for playing the tunes that get pushed to it from the software interface.  I too have been impressed by the quality and simplicity of the product so far.  I knew that I was going to pay a premium, so maybe I need to just suck it up and starting saving my pennies again.  I guess I see the benefit of the Connect if you already have a 7.1 surround sound system and wanted to be able to control it wirelessly as well.  For my particular scenario, I think my money is probably better spent on either the Play 3 or saving up for the Playbar TV."
sonos,2uh0ub,seans23,3,Mon Feb 2 04:17:57 2015 UTC,"The desktop app is just a client of the sonos system. The devices contain all settings information including any external accounts you have set up, such as Rdio or soundcloud. The sonos 1 would still be usable if you had your desktop shut down.

sonos,2uh0ub,Unbathed,2,Mon Feb 2 05:55:59 2015 UTC,"You could try to check out the Jamcast application for streaming sound from your PC to a Sonos player. However, since it does that by pretending that the PC sound is a radio station there will be a delay of 3-4 seconds. Obviously not suited for video, but for music I guess it doesn't really matter.  Your Audioengine speakers will then be 3-4 seconds ahead of the other speakers, so I guess this suggestion is only suitable if you have your computer in a separate room."
sonos,2uh0ub,Unbathed,2,Tue Feb 3 22:28:34 2015 UTC,"a box that is basically just a WiFi card.   Each box is a Linux computer with WiFi and Ethernet ports. The Connect can encode audio input, setup connections to your other SONIS units, and stream it synchronously."
sonos,2uh0ub,redditphantom,1 point,Wed Mar 4 13:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right, it is more than just a WiFi card.  My point is that a $199 Play 1 has all the technology inside of it for synchronously streaming music with other Sonos units.  The Play 1 has all of that technology in addition to the actual HiFi speaker.  Take away the speaker (which for a luxury ""HiFi"" system should be the bulk of the cost), take the connectors to the speaker and make it a line out, and now you basically have the Connect.  At least, that's all I need.  I simply cannot understand from an engineering prospective how they can nearly double the price for the product.  Of course, it makes plenty sense from a business prospective.  More so, there is also no reason why the Sonos application running on my computer cannot communicate and work along with the Sonos units to simply play music from my desktop speakers."
sonos,2uh0ub,dasarp,2,Wed Mar 4 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"no reason why the Sonos application running on my computer cannot communicate and work along with the Sonos units to simply play music from my desktop speakers.   There is a reason, and it has to do with co-ordination of multiple speakers.  SONOS controls the entire stack, software and hardware, on the PLAY: and CONNECT units. The system receives audio data from the Ethernet or WiFi port, possibly multiple feeds such as NPR for the kitchen and Beats for the living room; redistributes this data to every speaker who is subscribed to each feed, possibly separating left and right channels; waits for each speaker to confirm that it has buffered sufficient audio to provide for unbroken playback; then sends the Start Playing command. The user experiences smooth multiroom music. When the user presses the Pause or Skip Track buttons on a left-channel speaker, the music pauses or  advances on the right-channel speaker too. The quality of this experience is based on SONOS being able to control playback exactly.  The Controller application on your desktop computer cannot talk to your computer speakers directly. It requests audio services from your desktop operating system and sends audio content as the desktop operating system permits. If the desktop computer has other higher priority tasks to accomplish, the audio service may be suspended or delayed; such delays will not necessarily feed back to the Controller.   SONOS could in principle write software for OSX, Windows, and Chrome which would have all the functionality of the software they have for their speakers, but it would require a level of access to the OSX and Windows computers similar in depth to what SONOS has on its own units.   Keeping the different versions of a low-level audio engine current would complicate all future software releases. Look at the difficulty Microsoft has with shipping a web browser which runs on more than one OS. Look at the difficulty Apple has with iTunes. By limiting the problem to the Controller, SONOS has an achievable multiplatform goal."
sonos,2uh0ub,dasarp,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your insight.  Whenever I am playing music through Windows Media Player, VLC, Spotify, etc., I have never noticed a suspension or delay from when I press the play button to when sound starts coming out of my speakers.  I imagine these applications go through the process of ""requesting the audio services and sending the audio content as the OS permits"".  I could see it being delayed a fraction of a second, but I'm not sure if that would be noticeable for me.  Even if the computer became out of sync, couldn't one of the units just send out a packet every second or two that has the current spot in the track?"
sonos,2uh0ub,acer589,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:45:28 2015 UTC,The speaker units house a database as well that saves all the settings to.  The controller app is just an API that talks to said database to pull that information.  You could start playing your SONOS without the app on just by hitting the play button on the Play:1 speaker and it would play the queue that was last loaded.  Also it allows you to control the system from your phone/tablet/Desktop simultaneously.

There's even a prompt letting you know that Standard Setup uses your existing wireless network, rather than needing to connect via ethernet.  Your Sonos speaker then created a temporary wireless network. You just switch your controller (phone, iPad, whatever) to that temporary network, return to the Sonos app, and enter the credentials for the wireless network you're connecting to. From there, the speaker will join the wireless network, and you're good to go without a single ethernet cable."

My advice would be to connect the ethernet cable coming from Router 1 into another ethernet port on router 2.

It doesn't integrate with it but if you set up the Sonos app on the computer that has all your music the app can look for and index up to 65k of your songs ( I believe this limit is overall across your computer and your phone (s) )  the Sonos app on your phone allows you to play music from your phone to the Sonos system too.

sonos,2sqhoe,digitalhuxley,3,Sat Jan 17 14:45:31 2015 UTC,Do you ever listen through headphones?  You can do that with your current setup. You can't with a Connect:Amp
sonos,2sqhoe,bluescrn,1 point,Sat Jan 17 15:28:42 2015 UTC,Aah hadn't thought about that.  Thanks.  No I don't... although I do have a nice DAC with headphone socket and headphone amplifier inside it.  I used that DAC as the source for my amp before I got the sonos connect.  I'm guessing I could plug the optical out of the connect into that DAC and plug headphones into that.  Thanks that totally is a consideration.
sonos,2sqhoe,svideo,2,Sat Jan 17 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"Do you have a computer near that amp that could handle sending IR commands to power on and select source when the Sonos turns on?  I'm doing something similar with a Windows program called EventGhost.  It picks up the command on the local network to start playing on my Connect, and then sends the command to my receiver to turn on and select the input."
sonos,2sqhoe,svideo,3,Sat Jan 17 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about a Raspberry Pi or something for that... a while back I got a harmony hub and I found it could control the sonos, but as far as I can see it can't detect when the sonos is being used and switch the amp on to aux, then detect when it is not being used and switch the amp to off.  Agreed that would be a way of making the system more simple to use in the same way as having just a connect:amp.  Good idea!  I had half a mind to ask on some harmony related sub about that but hadn't got that far yet."
sonos,2sqhoe,svideo,2,Sat Jan 17 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"Having a Harmony hub nearby will greatly simplify things.  If you have a Windows PC that's on all the time, you can run EventGhost with the Sonos plugin and have it kick off activities by running something like HarmonyHubControl to get Harmony to send the commands to your NAD C352.    Checking online, that amp also has an IR input so you could run a cable from the Harmony Hub direct to the amp which should make the setup pretty reliable.  Further, I've just checked in the MyHarmony app and they have discrete power on/off codes for the C352 which greatly simplifies automation.  The CONNECT:AMP seems like decent enough hardware but I suspect your NAD is probably pretty good and if you have Harmony you should be able to handle the automation with a Windows (or maybe Linux) system running somewhere.  If you do have a Windows machine running, you should have everything you need right now to get this going.  edit: I've done some further digging and I think you might be able to do all this with OpenHAB running on rPi along with the Harmony and Sonos bindings.  I've not yet had an opportunity to work with OpenHAB but continued problems with Smartthings has me looking at moving some of my automation over to it."
sonos,2sqhoe,sophware,2,Sat Jan 17 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"Hey svideo thanks for this and doing all that digging, this is very interesting.  I'm all mac now so your OpenHAB on rPi idea might well work well.  I had a look at the Harmony and Sonos bindings and on the face of it they look like they could do the job. A pi would be quite a bit cheaper than a Connect:AMP and then I don't have to worry about it not sounding as good.  I've got the Harmony hub switching the amp on to aux when I select music so it looks like OpenHAB would just need to run in a loop checking if sonos is on and amp off, or sonos is off and amp on, and just keeping them in line with each other.    Good idea!"
sonos,2sqhoe,svideo,1 point,Sun Jan 18 14:28:39 2015 UTC,"Sonos actitivies get broadcast on your network with upnp so, at least with EventGhost, no polling is needed.  It just waits to see a Playing message on the wire for the Connect and sends the power/source commands to the AVR.  In your case I'd suspect that OpenHAB would work the same way.  My setup with EventGhost works very reliably and took a surprisingly small amount of screwing around to get going.  Good luck!"

sonos,2sq1e4,MarackObaba,1 point,Tue Jan 20 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"you need to install the proper node with n  check the version on the readme that you need, install n, and then install the required node.  This will get it to run, but it won't allow it to play from iTunes. It will make the sonos available to iOS devices including Apple TV"
sonos,2sp81i,maracle6,2,Sat Jan 17 03:20:18 2015 UTC,"A couple things about your music library through Sonos:  Once you select ""Update Music Library Now"", the system then has to scan your shared folders and rebuild its index of your music library. This can take anywhere from 1-15+ minutes depending on how much music you have. In the advanced section of your Music Library settings, you can schedule a daily update of this kind to occur automatically at any time you choose.  Beyond that, a lot of podcasts also have soundcloud streams, which you can access directly from Sonos via soundcloud - Such as This American Life: https://soundcloud.com/this-american-life"

sonos,2sp81i,Christofftofferson,2,Sat Jan 17 22:15:46 2015 UTC,"The way that I ended up getting around this, was to setup airsonos and then AirPlay my podcasts to the Sonos speaker. For me, this has been the best way to deal with the issue. It's also good for things like audiobooks or anything outside the scope of the Sonos app.   The downside is that you need to be somewhat technically inclined to get it up and running."

Currently, it's not random, and it's not shuffled. By their own admissions it plays the same queue in the same order.   If it's so difficult, why does every music playing software for the last 15 years manage to solve this?  They can have this if they like  $playlists = array(); $tracks = array();  function makePlaylist($tracks) {     $played = array();  while (count($tracks) > 0) {     $rnd = array_rand($tracks);     $played[] = $tracks[$rnd];      unset($tracks[$rnd]); }  return $played;   }"

sonos,2sadw2,10weight,2,Tue Jan 13 17:46:44 2015 UTC,"Don't want to come across as an arsehole but if you are on a budget, Sonos isn't for you. You can get a much, much, much better sounding set up for less. Sonos is very convenient but the quality is only 'pretty nice'.  £169 won't get the set up you want, however £338 will get you ver close to some very nice active speakers that will sound much better than Sonos.  Sonos is great if you want to fill your house with sound and have minimum fuss.  If you are only realistically looking at a stereo pair or two it's a waste of money.  I mean £600 for a sub...."

sonos,2sadw2,Christofftofferson,0,Tue Jan 13 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"IMHO one speaker is not enough. There is a very noticeable difference between a single speaker and a stereo pair.   Also, the sub is pretty much essential if you want a decent sound.  At a minimum you'd need two Play 1s and a Sub which is an eye watering £940!!!!!!!!!!!  If you are a student buy the Connect and get yourself some better quality speakers.  I started with a single Play 5. It's like crack. Not even once.   The software is also a bit pants except on mobile which recently go much, much better. However it's best for when you have multiple streaming subscriptions as you have universal search. I have Xbox Music, Spotify and DI.fm which is another circa £300 per annum.  Don't do it. Buy some decent speakers and enjoy life."
sonos,2sadw2,10weight,2,Tue Jan 13 19:33:22 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they adopt google cast (as they did with google music) On my Mac I use airsonos so I'm relatively happy with the software. I would still recommend them to friends and family
sonos,2sadw2,Unbathed,0,Tue Jan 13 21:53:08 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I am not 'dissing' Sonos. I have spent a lot with them and intend to spend more. I also have much cheaper 'regular' speakers that sound ten times better. Just saying that Sonos is a luxury and if you are working to a budget (eg unable to afford meaningful stereo separation) then there are better options. Convenience is great but ultimately it's about listening to music. You need a £600 sub to come anywhere near what a £400 pair of active monitors can deliver as far as quality goes. Sure, they wont melt the foundations of your house/soul like the sub will but even a pair of Play 5s struggle to deliver anything near the quality you could get for 2/3 of the price."

sonos,2s5gm4,xanderharris13,3,Mon Jan 12 09:45:09 2015 UTC,"The volume control on Sonos works independently of the volume control on your receiver (it doesn't control the receiver's own volume settings).  So if the Sonos is set to half of full volume and the receiver is also set half-way up, you are only getting a quarter of full volume.  I set the volume on the Sonos connect to 80% of full and adjust volume up and down on my receiver.  If your receiver has a spare audio output you may also want to connect that to one of the connect's inputs, so that you can send your TV audio round the house."
sonos,2s5gm4,doodlelogic,1 point,Mon Jan 12 10:54:01 2015 UTC,"I set the volume on the Sonos connect to 80% of full and adjust volume up and down on my receiver.   You can also set the output to ""Fixed"" in the zone settings (instead of variable), which will basically disable the volume control on the zone and provide optimum output from the zone to the receiver. You would then use the receiver volume control as normal."
sonos,2s5gm4,rcharliesam,1 point,Mon Jan 12 13:59:38 2015 UTC,It's one of the biggest drawbacks of the Connect. In order to control volume with the Sonos app you must set it to variable volume. Which means you have to set your receiver to full volume. Not a big deal until you forget and switch to a different input at full volume and blow your ears out. The key is to set your receiver to turn on at acceptable volume and turn system off then back on to switch imports that way you don't make yourself deaf our blow your speakers. It's also hard to train the rest of the family about this feature.

sonos,2rj4wi,nickdanger3d,1 point,Wed Jan 7 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"I recommend a Playbar + Sub + 2x Play:1s for your living room (I assume you have your couch against the wall in the yellow room where it says ""362"".)  You'll get 5.1 surround sound that way.  It should be plenty of sound to fill the living room and kitchen area, but you could always get another Play:1 for the kitchen.  If you feel like having sound in the bathroom, another Play:1 for there.  For the bedroom you could do a pair of Play:1s for stereo.  I'd recommend starting with the surround system in the living room and whatever system you want in the bedroom, then expand into the kitchen and bathroom if you find out you need it.  For streaming from your computer, you could get a Play:5 and use the line in, but I've heard of people having issues with that, plus that one is older hardware that's likely to be out of date soon.  You could also get a Connect and use it's line in.  But, what do you want to stream from your computer?  If it's music from a hard drive or a popular streaming service, Sonos does that without needing your computer at all."

sonos,2rfb66,xani92,4,Tue Jan 6 08:53:40 2015 UTC,There is already a thread on ask Sonos to request the feature.   https://ask.sonos.com/sonos/topics/will-sonos-support-google-cast-for-audio
sonos,2rfb66,wessyde,1 point,Tue Jan 6 09:42:24 2015 UTC,"competition in this market is going to blow up, IMO. Hopefully Sonos realizes that easy, seamless, and wireless integration across all services (including Airplay, Google Cast, and whatever else pops up) is what their customers want.    It seems silly that they haven't integrated Airplay already (and I'm talking about a wireless integration, not plugging into a Play 5 or whatever) yet, especially since I see people asking for it all over the place."
sonos,2rfb66,Blappi,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:16:40 2015 UTC,AirPlay integration seems tough for them to consider with it not being multi-room. I don't know much about casting but is it more multi-room than Airplay's sole desktop capability?

Add in a source, DAC, and amp + stands if he's got bookshelves and you're looking at $3500+ easily.   Be happy with the sound that you like that's all that matters.

sonos,2rbauc,tboxer854,2,Sun Jan 4 17:32:12 2015 UTC,I did the same today and I found that a couple of things improved the sound incredibly. I have a you view box (DVR) and a changed the sound output on there to surround from stereo. I also adjusted my settings on xbmc and it now sounds a hell of a lot better than my TV. Particularly at the low end.
sonos,2rbauc,squeezycheeseypeas,1 point,Sun Jan 4 20:16:35 2015 UTC,I just checked my DVR settings and they are already on Dolby. I will try and play around with it.

sonos,2rbauc,Mr_Namaste,2,Sun Jan 4 20:43:08 2015 UTC,"The Playbar WITH sub is what makes it great sounding. Hard to say ""OP, just add the sub"" because quite frankly, it's an additional $700... But it truly does make all the difference. I can only imagine a select few soundbars not paired with a subwoofer that would sound noticeably better than just the TV"
sonos,2rbauc,jasongill,3,Wed Jan 7 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"Other than a bass & treble slider in the Room Settings, there isn't any other tuning that you can do. And if you can see the SONOS logo from where you sit on the couch, it is set up properly.  Unfortunately, the Playbar is the most dissapointing product in the lineup - I would agree that it doesn't sound wildly better than a nice-sounding TV or a higher end ""mass market"" soundbar. The issues with it's lack of support for HDMI or DTS and other higher-quality codecs only add insult to injury.  You do get the other benefits of Sonos, however, like being able to group it with other zones, but ultimately if you are looking for a seriously good sounding TV and movie experience, the Playbar probably isn't your best bet (not even if you buy a Sub an 2x Play1/Play3's to use as rears, unfortunately)"
sonos,2rbauc,xraycat82,2,Sun Jan 4 19:03:27 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think HDMI switching or handling DTS audio is a negative though. The Playbar is meant to be connected to a TV where the TV handles the HDMI switching and the audio is always output as PCM or Dolby Digital. I don't think there is a single TV that outputs DTS. For those that connect a Playbar directly to source components with an optical switch they're using it not as Sonos intended when they developed the product.
sonos,2rbauc,jasongill,1 point,Mon Jan 5 05:29:46 2015 UTC,"You're correct, the Playbar does great when you look at how it was intended to be set up (connected to the TV's optical audio out). The problem is that most TV's only output stereo audio, and almost none pass any advanced audio formats like DTS.  Almost every other soundbar on the market, from $99 to the price of the Playbar, use HDMI and the audio return channel feature to allow for 5.1 (or better) sound, DTS, etc.  So while you're correct in the fact that the Playbar functions as intended, but they basically designed the product to be tied to the weakest digital audio output on the TV (admittedly, for simplicity sake)."
sonos,2rbauc,xraycat82,0,Mon Jan 5 18:58:22 2015 UTC,"I think there is a significant number of TVs that support DD 5.1 through the optical port though. I know there are a few threads around where people list if their model number that supports 5.1 out because it isn't commonly documented in manuals. I have a two year old 55"" Toshiba and it works. From what I can tell nearly every Sony and Toshiba TV made in the last few years does."
sonos,2rbauc,jasongill,2,Mon Jan 5 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that Sonos is using a connection method so poorly documented that you have to resort to looking online to see if your TV supports it is the issue here - if they had ponied up for HDMI+ARC, then they would have been able to support every TV with HDMI produced since 2009, with full support for DTS and everything else.  I'm not saying the Playbar is a bad product - I love mine - but it's the one part of the Sonos family that I honestly shy away from recommending to friends who are getting Sonos gear as it just has so many ""yes, but..."" stipulations."
sonos,2rbauc,Matthew9559,0,Tue Jan 6 00:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yea thats kinda what I have realized. When I play music out of it, it sounds amazing, but with the TV on it literally sounds identical. I might as well of bought the cheaper Sonos."
sonos,2rbauc,Matthew9559,1 point,Sun Jan 4 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"I definitely noticed that the sound was better with the Playbar than with the TV but I would agree, it wasn't mind blowingly better. I used that setup for a couple days and then I added two Play 1's and now it sounds much much better. I cannot wait to add the sub. I didnt have to do any tweaking, just bumped up the back speakers slightly. I just follow the online setup for Xbox One for proper setup too."
sonos,2rbauc,xraycat82,1 point,Sun Jan 4 23:47:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I actually have it boxed up and am about to return it. I spoke with a specialist from where I bought it and they pretty much told me the Sonos Playbar isn't meant for TV, its meant for playing music, which I found pretty ironic.  The adding two Play 1's is an interesting thought and not that much of an investment, but do you think its going to make that much of a difference? I have a Sharp Acquos TV, which is probably about 4-5 years old and after setting up the Playbar, I literally thought it was still playing through the TV."
sonos,2rbauc,chrulri,2,Mon Jan 5 03:04:45 2015 UTC,"To me they added a lot to the experience. My favorite part though is that I can move them easily out of the way or move around apartment for when people are over. If I had room for a traditional home theater, I would have went that route for sure."
sonos,2rbauc,Martytoof,2,Mon Jan 5 05:09:31 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with your sales guy. The Playbar only has a single optical input which matches what TV's normally only have as an audio output. It's meant to be used with a TV that handles all of the input switching. If it were meant for music it'd have RCA SPDIF and a 3.5mm stereo jack, common on audio-only sources. Our Playbar has allowed us to listen to a lot more music though. It was used on its own for most of this year and it was significantly better than my Toshiba's speakers. I just added two Play1's as surrounds though and it's much better with a 5.1 source."
sonos,2rbauc,bebopblues,1 point,Mon Jan 5 05:24:11 2015 UTC,"I went for the Connect:AMP and a pair of Denon SC-8N instead of the Playbar+Sub. It's stereo only (no 5.1 or so), but at least it sounds decent, even for movies/games."

sonos,2r3k2u,MRGEN7LEMAN,3,Fri Jan 2 13:25:37 2015 UTC,I've had the Playbar for the past two days by itself and really enjoyed the step up in audio quality from TV. It sounds much nicer and did a good job at spreading out the sound I felt like. I spent all day today though with having added two Play:1's and I'm much happier now. I really was missing the atmospheric aspect of the sound so getting these before the sub was a big deal to me. They really add the dynamic I was missing and sound pretty great.   I moved recently and didn't want to clutter up my apartment with standard full 5.1 (was in a house previously with a decent 5.1 setup) so going wireless with Sonos has thankfully been everything I hoped for. I can easily move the two speakers to other rooms or turn into stereo purely for music which is great. I can't wait to get the sub. :)
sonos,2r3k2u,Matthew9559,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:49:03 2015 UTC,The sub really is incredible.
sonos,2r3k2u,Matthew9559,1 point,Sat Jan 3 08:09:26 2015 UTC,Hah. That's why I'm kinda worried it may be too loud for my apartment. :P I'm sure it'll be fine though and I do have a subwoofer raiser around still. I am really excited to complete my setup with it though in the near future.
sonos,2r3k2u,ansedd95,3,Sat Jan 3 19:00:08 2015 UTC,Me have 2 play:1. Me be very happy. Me can also use them outside for parties.

sonos,2r3k2u,swingbaby,2,Fri Jan 2 13:38:30 2015 UTC,Oh. Sorry. I meant that i have them as rear sorround in conjunction with playbar and sub.
sonos,2r3k2u,ansedd95,1 point,Fri Jan 2 13:44:26 2015 UTC,"Okay so since I'm looking for the best possible sound, would getting the play 3's be better? Let's see...would playbar, sub, plus two 3's in the front and two 3's in the rear work? All this being connected with a Boost hardwired to my router? Should a Connect: Amp be used as well?"
sonos,2r3k2u,171819,5,Fri Jan 2 13:53:57 2015 UTC,"No can do. You can only get 5.1 at best (right now) with Sonos.  That's the Playbar (front right, center, front left), rear right and left with either Play1 or Play3, and Sub.  Notes: The rears have to be both of the same variety (can't mix and match Play1 and Play3), and cannot be a Play5 (it lacks the 5Mhz band for low-latency 5.1 surround sound).  We have the Play1's in the rear, and by boosting the individual levels on the rears it provides great surround volume.  Play3's would be major overkill in my opinion.  And when you use the full system to play streaming music instead of optical TV, the Play1's set to go at ""Full"" instead of ""Ambient"" give HUGE sound combined with Playbar and Sub...enough to fill our great room (25 x 15 feet) with cathedral ceiling.  You need not have a boost unless wiring the system to one of the players is not convenient (we wire to the Playbar and don't have or need a boost)."
sonos,2r3k2u,subterraniac,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"I dont think you can use more speakers in the front. Its just the playbar for that. And 1 or 3 in the back in probably wont make a real difference. Sonos is not super hifi, more like super easy hifi."
sonos,2r3k2u,thedoofa7,2,Fri Jan 2 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"You have 3 options for surround sound with Sonos: A pair of Play:1's, a pair of Play:3's, or a Connect:AMP that is connected with ethernet directly to the Playbar. If you have something like in ceiling speakers, the Connect:AMP option might be the way to go. I personally don't hear a big difference between the Play:1 and Play:3 when used as surrounds, and my space fits the Play:1 better, so that's what I use"

sonos,2qymlb,zwicklestick,4,Wed Dec 31 23:01:25 2014 UTC,"I think you might find the transition from a soundbar and a sub to a playbar a little underwhelming in the bass department. With that said, the playbar alone sounds good and can suffice in your situation.  Don't get me wrong, it has good bass, but going from a sub to no sub, you can tell the difference."
sonos,2qymlb,tw627x,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:54:01 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the insight.

sonos,2qymlb,lschenko,2,Wed Dec 31 23:47:20 2014 UTC,"It's expensive, but that sub is flipping fantastic. Seriously under rated. It sounds better than sibs I've heard that cost more then twice that much easy. Personally, I would get the sub over the surrounds. It does a good job even at low levels and I would rather hear the full range than noise behind me. That being said, if you can swing it, do it all, it's really good given the flexibility and even the cost. I don't think I have heard anything better that was not a full cabinet speaker (although I have by no means listened to everything, I'm sure there are things out there)."

I ended up returning the sub and got a play 1 and a play 3 and still had money left over. Some people say the sub makes all the difference and i would disagree. The playbar is were it's at and the sub is the frosting on the cake.

From the Sonos.com FAQ:   RANGE: 50% greater wireless range than BRIDGE.    COVERAGE: Three antennas for flawless 360 degree wireless coverage through walls and ceilings.    POWER: Advanced wireless interference rejection.   The Play:5 (like the Bridge) uses an older wireless G chipset. Those Atheros chipsets support wireless N with 3x3 MIMO but I don't think beamforming is supported.
sonos,2qvfht,quadraphonic,2,Wed Dec 31 01:11:39 2014 UTC,"A few things to remember: If you want to do a surround sound setup with in ceiling speakers, it has to be with the Connect:AMP, not the Connect. The Connect:AMP also must be physically wired to the Playbar. This will probably require some planning if the Connect:AMPs are going in the basement. If you want the sub channel, you must use the Sonos SUB, a third party one won't work. The connect sounds like the right solution for the main bonus room"

With the Boost its supposed to be easier to setup a surround system with the playbar, but the Sonos technology is not currently in the optimal state for surround sounds applications.  Personally, I have a Connect feeding my receiver when I want to listen to music in my living room.  Xmas morning just turn on the receiver and play music while opening presents.

We'll have a main TV room upstairs that will have a wired 5.1 system and an a/v receiver on the tv.  There is a possibility I'll go Nuvo, but both seem to be roughly the same cost for the size of install I'm planning.

sonos,2qrtha,chedda27,1 point,Tue Dec 30 04:00:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah I've just been using Spotify and on the play on device feature which works rather well. The bose sounds good, not great, but good. Their app, however, terrible. The whole deezer promo didn't work at all."
sonos,2qrtha,hitmyspot,6,Tue Dec 30 11:57:12 2014 UTC,"Sonos is designed around digital music. It's about wireless and streaming. The quality of the speakers is very good, but not excellent. It is the ability to rearrange and repurpose them that makes them great. You can spread them around the house and have them all playing the same thing, or all playing something different. They allow you to directly log in to most popular music services and they can be Ashly controlled with a smartphone, tablet or computer.  Bose used to make high quality equipment. Then they turned to mass market and the quality dropped. Their addition is more like wireless streaming as an afterthought. Hopefully they catch up, because competition keeps songs innovating, but at the moment I wouldn't dream of getting a Bose."
sonos,2qrtha,hitmyspot,1 point,Tue Dec 30 04:08:27 2014 UTC,Awesome thanks for the great input. How hard/easy would it be to pull 2 play 1s from a 5.1 configuration with a play bar and relocate them to a stereo pair elsewhere?
sonos,2qrtha,raxel82,2,Tue Dec 30 11:58:44 2014 UTC,"I don't have a play bar so I'm not sure, but I've found other pairings easy. Hopefully someone else can contribute."
sonos,2qrtha,mfryan,1 point,Tue Dec 30 12:27:07 2014 UTC,"It's very easy. I have a play bar and 2 play 1s (so not really a 5.1 configuration, but, whatever, it should be the same). Just go to the room portion of the app and click to remove the surround sound. Then you'll have two new groups created for the 2 play 1s. They're ready to be paired up with other speakers immediately."
sonos,2qqkqf,th12eat,2,Mon Dec 29 19:37:47 2014 UTC,"My settings on my xbox one do not reset whenever I turn it off. Do you have your xbox set to go into standby or power saving mode when you turn it off?  I know you have a wii U, but I really get the best sound by plugging my playbar directly into the Xbox One. and then maybe just suffer through using the TV speakers when using the Wii U?"
sonos,2qqkqf,SpatialFX,1 point,Tue Dec 30 01:00:56 2014 UTC,"To clarify, the settings don't reset. It's just the audio is muted and I have to toggle the settings to force it to work.  I read a lot after posting about TV's optical outputting stereo sound. So, I plugged it into the Xbox directly like you said and all is well. Just a pain. Wish I knew why it was acting up this way."

Additionally, the switched will extract the audio from the HDMI source and send it to the playbar with a single optical cable so all your devices can have 5.1 audio."
sonos,2qohve,sup_reddit,3,Mon Dec 29 04:15:07 2014 UTC,"Should start by asking is this for music or tv.  If tv id go play bar.  If its for music Id go with two play ones and speaker stands. IMO 2 play ones sound as good as a play 3 or even 5 and have good use after you expand.  My second step would be the play bar and third the sub.  But for now, 2 play 1s will fill your room very easily."
sonos,2qohve,tw627x,1 point,Mon Dec 29 04:57:35 2014 UTC,It is for music. I don't have a tv currently. Thanks for the info and advice.
sonos,2qohve,nightauthor,1 point,Mon Dec 29 06:34:21 2014 UTC,I dont quite understand why you mention the issues with netflix/prime/HBO if you are not using this for tv. Are you wishing to play audio from your phone to the speakers while watching on your phone? This seems odd to me.
sonos,2qohve,ChrisTheRazer,1 point,Mon Dec 29 07:18:44 2014 UTC,"I watch those on a laptop or tablet currently. The sonos would be primarily for music, but if I could also use it for that stuff instead of headphones or onboard speakers that would also be nice."
sonos,2qohve,bananagrammick,1 point,Mon Dec 29 09:03:38 2014 UTC,"The Play 5 has analog line in, which you could connect to your laptop. I'm not sure if there is any lag though."
sonos,2qohve,dasarp,3,Mon Dec 29 13:54:58 2014 UTC,"I think this isn't going to be too popular but the really great part about Sonos is using it in multiple zones. I think if you are just going to have a studio apartment for awhile that you might get a lot more bang for your buck using regular speakers.   I'm a huge fan of studio monitors for this kind of work, paired with a bluetooth receiver to work with your tablet too. I think you'll get better, bigger sound for less money."
sonos,2qohve,Leeanderthal,3,Mon Dec 29 16:24:59 2014 UTC,"Also, I was in a similar situation once and I went with $400 white Audioengine A5+ with $40 Logitech Bluetooth receiver plugged in to make them Bluetooth.  Those speakers sound as good if not better than any Sonos speakers (and I own all of them). Later when I moved into a house with multiple rooms and got a bunch of Sonos speakers for other rooms, I purchased a $350 Sonos Connect and made the Audioengine my primary speakers in the living room for Sonos and the TV (the A5+s take two inputs - one Sonos Connect, other TV).  Just another option."
sonos,2qohve,dasarp,2,Mon Dec 29 17:23:12 2014 UTC,"+1 on the A5's, did almost the same as you but started out with a Connect Amp and the A5's. All down hill from there as I've picked up another Amp, two One's, two 3's paired with a Playbar and Sub, and a Play5 all in the past year or so."
sonos,2qohve,Brewshound,1 point,Tue Dec 30 15:40:52 2014 UTC,"Agree with this. If you are going the Sonos route though, I'd go with the Play 5.  It'll cover a studio room perfectly, and the additional bass you get is worth it over the stereo separation you can get with two Play 1s or Play 3s in a single room."
sonos,2qohve,EnhancedR,2,Mon Dec 29 17:17:34 2014 UTC,Play5 has a line in via headphone jack that would be your best bet for your Netflix/Amazon/HBO from your laptop as the line in probably has the little to no lag.  I used it once and don't remember being a lag.  I can test later.  http://blog.sonos.com/tips-and-tricks/tip-using-line-in-on-sonos/
sonos,2qohve,EnhancedR,1 point,Mon Dec 29 17:31:57 2014 UTC,Yeah I would definitely be curious whether there is noticeable lag for you. I thought I remembered reading that there would be due to a technical detail of how the sonos processes the audio. i can try to find the link later.
sonos,2qohve,lost_adonis,2,Mon Dec 29 23:26:21 2014 UTC,You're probably thinking about the information given here: https://sonos.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/240/~/line-in-audio-not-in-sync-with-video  So there will be around a 70 ms delay at a minimum.
sonos,2qn17q,more-monitors-plz,2,Sun Dec 28 19:43:35 2014 UTC,"Double-NAT is generally bad, but seems like the simplest solution. Another router that connects using its WAN port to the main network, then you connect yourself, the Play:5 and any other devices to that router. You can get out, but your flatmates can't get in.  I'm sure there are better way to do it, but this seems the easiest. It doesn't take into account any other things on the rest of the network that you need to access."
sonos,2qn17q,kellyzdude,2,Sun Dec 28 19:49:04 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your speedy reply, correct me if I'm wrong, this is how it'd work:  Internet connected to Network A.  Network A keeps the servers, and flatmates devices.  Network B gets internet through network A, and I connect my devices AND Sonos to this.  From network B can I still access the servers on network A?"
sonos,2qn17q,kellyzdude,2,Sun Dec 28 20:11:12 2014 UTC,"Right. The answer really depends on the servers and how you reach/access them -- so, maybe, maybe not.  If you rely on NETBIOS or similar to ""discover"" the server, it likely won't work. If you connect directly via IP, it should continue to function.  Again, no guarantees."
sonos,2qn17q,projectself,2,Mon Dec 29 04:12:13 2014 UTC,"Add a second SSID on your wireless network, do not give the passphrase to anyone else.  Use it as your phone/pc preferred wifi.    You will have to be on the same wireless ssid to ""find"" the sonos, but no one else will find it either.  As for connecting to servers inside, as long as the IP addressing is valid your router will sort it out.  (That's what they do).    I do quite a bot of wireless networking in my job and discovered this feature by accident as I have multiple SSID's enabled and if I am not on the one configured for sonos I cannot control the app even though all devices are on the same ""network""."
sonos,2qn17q,kellyzdude,3,Mon Dec 29 00:10:24 2014 UTC,I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest this strongly depends on the wireless router/access point you're using to safely segregate that traffic. If you can suggest specific router models you've been able to do this with it might help :)
sonos,2qn17q,thecw,1 point,Mon Dec 29 04:11:12 2014 UTC,"Will you be in control of physical access to the Sonos? Eg will it be in your bedroom or a common area? If it's in your bedroom, someone needs to be able to press the buttons on the unit to pair a controller."
sonos,2qn17q,xani92,0,Mon Dec 29 05:11:45 2014 UTC,I think the easiest way is to      give your Sonos a static IP give your phone a static IP block all IPs except the one of your phone to connect to your Sonos   Upside:     No new hardware needed Easy to configure You don't lose the ability to connect to the servers on the current network/still have internet   Downside:     This is only useful if the other people cannot change the firewall settings   otherwise you should use /u/kellyzdude 's advice

sonos,2qjfb6,cookiesvscrackers,3,Sat Dec 27 16:21:19 2014 UTC,You'd have to use the line-input on a Connect or Play5 to get all the audio from your Android phone. To do it wirelessly use a Bluetooth audio receiver.
sonos,2qjfb6,xraycat82,2,Mon Dec 29 23:36:11 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately as of now, you are limited to the Sonos app. That app does not support Youtube. However I believe it can support audiobook downloads, and I've listened to NPR/podcasts through the supported app Stitcher. I believe a Play: 5 also has line-in access, so you can connect your phone to it directly to play whatever the phone would be playing.  I do not like the Sonos app, and I hope they update their software so we can play whatever we want directly from the phone. For what it's worth, I've seen a lot of reviews saying they like the Sonos app because it aggregates all of your music and sound sources, with the exception of a few."

sonos,2qjfb6,nightauthor,1 point,Sat Dec 27 17:55:04 2014 UTC,"My understanding is that the Sonos system provides many of the features and stability by not using your phone as a source for sound at all. Your phone is just a remote control for the system, the Sonos device actually goes out on the internet and grabs the source directly. This is why you can play something, and still listen after turning your phone off. Having a line-out type function would be a whole other type of stream, and may even require root/jailbreak to have that kind of access to the phone's audio."

Note that your TV must be capable of passing a Dolby Digital signal through its optical port.   Certain Blu-ray players are capable of converting DTS to Dolby Digital output during playback. Some players capable of this conversion are the Samsung BD-F6500, Samsung BD-F5900, and Samsung BD-F5700.  In addition, the Xbox One can transcode DTS to Dolby Digital 5.1. More information for setting up the Xbox One can be found here."

Two Play 3s in a stereo pair are better than a single Play 5.  Furthermore...  Two Play 1s and a Sub is, pretty much indistinguishable from a sub and two Play 3s or Play 5s...  I did it arse over tit. Got a Play 5, then another, then a Sub, then a Play 3.  I would have been better off with four Play 1s and a Sub.  But fuck it.

sonos,2qg5rs,10weight,3,Thu Jan 1 12:13:56 2015 UTC,I think it depends on the size of the room. If it sounds good in the room you have it in now then I wouldn't upgrade. The sound quality probably won't be noticeable from the 3 to the 5 at normal volumes.   Either way you can't go wrong. Sonos are the best!

sonos,2qg5rs,peaceshark,1 point,Fri Dec 26 15:42:14 2014 UTC,I have both. If it is only $60 I would clearly recommend the upgrade. Sound is way better on the 5.

So in the end, it's more of a $90 upgrade, because I'm guessing you'd have that $30 deducted from your trade-in.  It depends on how you want to expand your Sonos set-up. If you eventually want a home theater, consider staying with the Play:3 because you can pair those as rear speakers (not possible with Play:5). If you have a large room you really want to fill with noise, upgrade to the Play:5. Also just consider if your Grandpa will care that you traded in his gift."

When you've got 5 players and 2 WiFi access points (connected by powerline networking), getting the whole thing working without dropouts seems to be more art than science... Although I now know about the Sonos diagnostics web interface, which is useful!  Seems to be working well after adding a Boost, moving one of the access points, and changing the wifi channels around, and letting SonosNet use the channel that seemed least congested by neighbours wifi...  (Was also comparing the sound of a Play:3, Play:5, and a pair of Play:1's.  Is it just me, or does the Play:3 sound awful compared to the others? - I think even a single Play:1 sounds better...   And yes, I've messed with the equaliser and 'loudness' setting)"
sonos,2qeq5v,bluescrn,1 point,Sat Dec 27 11:40:07 2014 UTC,Got a Sonos Connect:Amp and replaced the bookshelf stereo with it.  Super happy.    The only niggle is figuring out the time delay with the line input and scripting VLC to resync the video that comes out of the computer.  I don't think I'll be able to watch normal television though as I can't just add in a video buffer for broadcast.  Not a terrible thing.
sonos,2qeq5v,superdefence,1 point,Mon Dec 29 12:48:49 2014 UTC,"In reference to the delay, it seems that all Sonos sources play with a delay. Probably to allow a buffer for syncing all the devices around the home. Since your connect will allow you to use the TV source to play in any other room on the SonosNet, they build in a buffer/delay for syncing. Just odd for the TV use-case."

sonos,2qe9xg,penskyc,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:44:49 2015 UTC,It does both. It can take in an existing sound source (computer) and output that to the rest of the Sonos system. The output of the connect can then also connect to your computer speakers and make them part of the Sonos system as well.

sonos,2qbdkl,bananagrammick,2,Thu Dec 25 05:09:00 2014 UTC,"I would say it depends on your budget and your style.   If this is all going to be 1 zone then best bang for your buck is going to be the Connect:Amp and a couple of decent high efficiency bookshelf speakers.   If you have more to spend, want more speakers, or speakers that need more power than the Connect:Amp can push you can get a Connect and hook it up to an external amp that fits your needs.  As for bookshelf speakers here is a list of my favorites under $500 to keep things inexpensive:   B&W 686 Klipsch RB-61 II AudioEngine P4 Cambridge Audio S30 NHT Absolute Zero  PSB Image Axiom Audio M2 Polk RTI A3 Wharfedale Diamond 10.1   I believe all of these should work with the Connect:amp but just double check"
sonos,2qbdkl,bananagrammick,2,Thu Dec 25 06:36:09 2014 UTC,"Sweet, thx for the reply.  So I don't need a sub then if I get a couple nice speakers? I'm a bit restricted with the cabinets so will have to measure and check out your list. Also the connect amp only supports two speakers, correct?"
sonos,2qbdkl,bananagrammick,3,Thu Dec 25 06:46:54 2014 UTC,"If you have the budget for a sub then I would probably get one. Most people don't say ""I'm really hate that I have this sub"" but you can live without one and add one later if you feel you need it. The Connect:Amp has a sub out built in for an easy addition and some of these speakers will need more help than others in the bass department.   I would only hook up 2 speakers into each Connect:Amp, if you want more speakers I would just get the Play, an amp, and the speakers you want. As I said before it all comes down to budget and what you can put in the space (layout, desired look, kids, wife approval, etc).   To show what you could do in a space that size, with a mid level budget, I would get Sonos Connect, a multi channel amp (Emotiva XPA-5), 4 or 5 speakers that fit the area with at least 2 being full range towers (Dynaudio excite X34, x16 surrounds) and a play 5 for the kitchen. Grouped most of the time but being able to separate or play only 1 if desired.   Pricing on that Sonos Connect $350, Sonos Play 5 $400, Emotiva XPA-5 $900, Dynaudio X34 $3500, Dynaudio X16 $1400 = $6550 + cables, stands, and a DAC if needed/desired  You could do it for a lot more or a lot less. All up to you."
sonos,2qbdkl,bananagrammick,1 point,Thu Dec 25 07:29:17 2014 UTC,"Wow, that's a mid budget :)  So i can get any sub with the connect amp? Also I just measured the speaker compartments...12x12, would that change any of your recommendations? Also this going into speaker cabinets I should look for everything coming out the front of the speaker, correct?"
sonos,2qbdkl,bananagrammick,2,Thu Dec 25 15:37:28 2014 UTC,"The B&W 686 sounds like your guy although it is listed as 12.4"" but is closest in size and is front ported. They usually carry them at Magnolia Best Buys (and even some non-magnolia ones) so you can listen to them before you buy.   Any sub that has a mini-stereo or RCA in will be fine with the Connect:amp. The BIC F12 seems to be a budget favorite around /r/audiophile and can be had for under $200."

sonos,2qbk1n,CaptainOblivi0us,1 point,Wed Dec 24 23:26:31 2014 UTC,Nope. Maybe try turning on night mode as  well?  Adjust the equalizer settings?  Are you getting a 5.1 input from your source or just stereo?
sonos,2qbk1n,ctjwa,1 point,Thu Dec 25 10:39:39 2014 UTC,this is with stereo only. I have not tried messing with the equalizer yet just felt odd that I'm having this problem.  I guess this is not too common.
sonos,2qbk1n,dukeu03,2,Thu Dec 25 22:11:30 2014 UTC,Stereo may be bypassing the center channel which is responsible for almost all voice audio in movies and tv. I bet if you change the mode you may have better luck - note that I do not have a play bar so I'm just hypothesizing based on a common problem in 5.1 setups lacking a center channel
sonos,2qbk1n,ctjwa,1 point,Tue Dec 30 12:42:53 2014 UTC,I always run audio straight from the cable box so my playbar only has 5.1. Maybe the stereo loses some of the sound quality

sonos,2q8u98,peaceshark,1 point,Wed Dec 24 04:30:17 2014 UTC,Most music services do this. You just have to either have a playlist or the service set to that zone. It will pick it up where you left off.

sonos,2q8u98,qupada42,3,Wed Dec 24 15:39:31 2014 UTC,"I was really hopeful that the Cast extension for Chrome might work with the web-based GPM player and the Sonos, but it looks like you need an actual ChromeCast.  I filled in the feedback form to try and get an answer about when or if they might support it, but no response.  I've got quite attached to using Cast from the GPM Android app to the Sonos, it's not a perfect solution but I still prefer it to using the Sonos app.  I've thought about buying a cheap(ish) Android tablet and using the guest feature for non-passworded access to the Sonos and GPM apps so I don't have to keep unlocking my phone - the lock screen play controls for GPM are OK most of the time but lack the thumbs up/down buttons, switching that for the Sonos app's lockscreen widget inexplicably requires unlocking the phone before making volume adjustments.  Double-clicking the play/pause button to skip a track also helps when your phone is over the other side of the room.  I don't run Windows on any of my machines, perhaps someone else can say whether you get the same level of control of 3rd-party streaming services with their desktop Windows application as you do through the Sonos Android app, I'm not sure if that would be a happy medium.  I've tried the audio loopback methods that record what's playing on your PC and stream it to the Sonos, but using FLAC causes dropouts and crackling and MP3 has far too much latency for it to be usable.  So yeah, for better or worse I'm sticking with GPM, it's what I'm used to now anyway.  Best of luck with your hunt."

sonos,2pz9s1,raxel82,6,Sun Dec 21 16:01:16 2014 UTC,"I would recommend the Sub.  I can't speak for the Play:3 but while the Play:1 is an amazing speaker, it simply can't reproduce that room-shaking bass that the Sub can do.  And if you're going to spend that kind of money for a home theater / whole house mesh audio solution, why not get the Sub too :)  FYI if you buy through Amazon and you're not in a rush to get all the components, you can do what I did.  Order the Playbar first and get the $50 electronics credit when it ships (usually the day after you order.)  Then order the Sub with that $50 credit and you'll get another $50 credit when that ships.  Then get one Play:1 and use that $50 credit, and you'll get another $20 credit when that ships.  Then order the final Play:1 and use that $20 credit, and at the end you'll have saved $120 plus have a $20 Amazon credit left over.  Another method I used is Best Buy Outlet (www.bestbuy.com/outlet) where you can search nearby stores for open box items by brand.  There have always been both black and white Play:1s available for $177 (or cheaper if they've got a scratch or something.)"

IMHO, the play:1's do a better job, BUT I've always had a sub in the mix so I may not be able to address your specific question about the bass. However, I don't think a lot of bass gets sent to the surround channels so it may not matter in TV mode.  Positioning is important. If you can get the surround channels behind you and offset that is best. Having them more than a few feet away and more to the sides yielded crummy results in comparison."

And like many.. once you add that sub, you'll wonder why you didn't do it earlier!  It's expensive but worth it!  Would also agree - check best buy open box! I think I got my playbar for $575? 1s for $169 and the sub for $500 something. I used to work at best buy, and 99% of the time people plug it in, don't know what they're doing and they return it..

Fortunately I've got a friend at best buy who will give me an employee discount on them so it's no where near as bad as it could be.   I'll save some money for the play:3 in an area that won't get the benefits of the sub. Anything else I should know with a surround sound setup and others for streaming?

Compressed has a higher delay but is less bandwidth-intensive, uncompressed has a smaller delay but risks audio dropouts. I believe automatic tries to pick the best one.  In your case, you only have a PLAY:1 which has no line-in, so changing the setting will have no effect on your network."

It's been a bit variable for the station I use the most, usually the stream is about 45-60 seconds behind NTP time, but on occasion it has randomly dropped to only 15-20 seconds for a few days.  If you look at the diagnostic page on the Sonos (http://sonos-ip:1400/support/review) you can see the URLs it's played under "" Radio Station Log"".  For the one I'm using it turns out after being redirected a few times the stream is played straight from the station's own website, so I could probably have just added their streaming URL manually:    Timestamp Type URI    2286183 playlist http://legato.radiotime.com/Tune.ashx?id=s25645&partnerId=Sonos&serial=B8-E9-37-xx-xx-xx:G   2286183 playlist http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/live/national.asx   2286184 stream mms://streaming.radionz.co.nz/national-mbr   2286184 stream rtsp://streaming.radionz.co.nz/national-mbr   2286184 stream mms://streaming.radionz.co.nz/national-mbr?MSWMExt=.asf   2286184 stream rtsp://streaming.radionz.co.nz/national-mbr?MSWMExt=.asf   2286184 stream mms://103.14.3.137:80/national-mbr?MSWMExt=.asf   2286184 stream rtsp://103.14.3.137:80/national-mbr?MSWMExt=.asf   2286184 stream x-rincon-mp3radio://streaming.radionz.co.nz/national-mbr"

It does work but the sound quality was significantly worse than streaming the same songs from Spotify/google and you will have to name the connect as a room, even if you only use it as an input, which is minor but annoyed me.  I also tried plugging my phone to the connect instead of the rega and stream the songs from Spotify and the quality was still bad so it wasn't a problem with the turntable.

sonos,2phi2k,thebugswillbite,2,Tue Dec 16 21:15:14 2014 UTC,I kept the playbar for the TV but I sent back the connect and decided to use an old amp and speakers for the turntable instead. If the connect were cheaper I might have kept it but I felt it wasn't worth the price just to be able to plug in a turntable and get mediocre quality sound.
sonos,2phi2k,thebugswillbite,1 point,Tue Dec 16 22:01:50 2014 UTC,Agreed but latency wasn't a problem for me anyway. I did that!

But if you ever choose to get off the updates merry-go-round, it's very difficult to impose discipline.  Every SONOS controller app will ask, every time you fire it up, if you want to update.  All it takes is one person saying ""OK"" and the whole system will force an upgrade.  That is normally OK -- most upgrades are innocuous, and even when the user interface has changed at least it has usually maintained its function (even if the GUI design is a bit broken in recent revisions).  But some updates have removed important functionality, so if you get used to (say) using old iPads to control your stereo, you may find that a stealth SONOS update initiated by your kids makes them incompatible and they just stop working one day."

It's a racket that's old as the hills, and everything thinks they are going to get away without paying, and they inevitably get called out on it with some stupid fines attached.  It sucks, it's a total racket, but there's almost no way around it unless you are able to source music that isn't covered under their contracts.  If you're going to let your patrons select the music, there's almost no way to ensure that the music won't be infringing."

sonos,2olirl,myopic1,2,Mon Dec 8 00:22:14 2014 UTC,There's an option that comes up when the player is receiving audio from the tv which enhances dialogue. I've also had good luck reducing the volume of the sub. There's also another tv sound option called night mode which I find also helps improve the dialogue levels. I suppose you could also change the EQ settings and teakettle overall level of the sub down but I find the first option is generally enough.

I've been through the settings and connections, and can't find any way too boost it. The function to reduce the dynamic range doesn't help much.  Does the Playbar have any options for the downmix from 5.1? - is it possible to turn up the center channel/turn down the rest? - it might be an option for them, as they've already got a Sonos system, including a pair of Play:1's in the living room with are reasonably placed for rear speakers."

sonos,2ohpsv,Turdferg4life,1 point,Sun Dec 7 15:17:54 2014 UTC,Correct: The Connect:Amp came out well before Playbar and lacks the 5GHz chip needed for HT sound. This is also why Play:5s can not be paired for rear surround speakers.

I got the playbar for the tv, loved it and then bought the sub (had the buying bug). It's elegant. I get great sound using my connect with Thx Logitech speakers, But the system doesn't look as good and isn't as neat. If you're using it with a tv then it's a good choice, that also works well with the Sub upGrade. If you're using it only for music there are other solutions that work with sonos and will sound as good but won't look as elegant.  It holds its own with music, even without the sub. If you're looking for a sonos speaker to live with your tv but is mostly for music it's a good choice. Without a tv you're wasting a bit of the functionality you're paying for. A stereopair of 3s or 5s would be more versatile. 5s have that lovely line in but lack 5ghz connectivity, that can hurt. The connect is another option but you're tethered to another system that's generally ugly and there's some discussion about the quality of the stereo output. (But the line in is again so handy).  Edit: re reading your post I realise you're looking for a tv speaker too -_- the playbar is definitely the way to go. It's got the bass response of the 5s, so you don't neeeeeeed the sub, but you'll want it :P"

sonos,2nykez,PonyDogs,1 point,Mon Dec 1 19:50:02 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your response! I realise now that they are much of the same thing. I think the bridge would work fine. I suppose I just wasn't sure if they were bran specific items, if you see what I mean. Thanks again!"

sonos,2nunrq,Tildah,2,Sun Nov 30 16:21:05 2014 UTC,Looks like it's UK only.
sonos,2nv3q3,hubbahubbadingding,3,Sun Nov 30 18:58:52 2014 UTC,"I can answer some of those questions.  Streamed radio channels? Yes, via TuneIn Radio.  Connect across 50 feet? A boost should be powerful enough, but I'd confirm the range by emailing Sonos (its a new device). The bigger problem will be controlling the music if the entire setup is connected to the internet via a router/network in one of the houses as your phone/tablet/controller needs to be on the same network as the Sonos players to control the music.  A better solution IMHO would be to dump your music mp3s on the cloud (via Google Music or some other service) so you can access it from any network or even on the go."
sonos,2nv3q3,dasarp,1 point,Sun Nov 30 19:39:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the advice about contacting Sonos to see if the Boost will work, I will do that.  You bring up a good point about controlling the set up - which leads to another question, if there is a Boost in play, does the phone/tablet/controller use the Boost mesh to control things or does it use the wifi network from my router?  On getting everything to the cloud - I am using iTunes Match - not sure if that works or not thought.  I would like to reduce dependency on streaming from a cloud environment for music I own as internet access is coming from DSL in both locations and I want to dedicate as much bandwidth as possible to things other than music downloads, so if I can sync between two networks and have a local version on a NAS or something, or bridge the locations with a Boost I would rather do that."
sonos,2nv3q3,dasarp,4,Mon Dec 1 00:54:16 2014 UTC,"Next time, try replying to my comment instead of your own post - that way the conversation is threaded and I get notified.  Not sure about the NAS, haven't used that yet, so someone else can answer that better.  About controlling the set up - for most phone/tablet/controllers you have to connect to your wifi network from the router and the controller must be on the same network as the Sonos devices. Only for Android devices, you can have it to connect to the Sonos network/boost directly, but you can't connect it to the Sonos network and your home wifi simultaneously which might cause other problems."
sonos,2nv3q3,dasarp,1 point,Mon Dec 1 04:07:47 2014 UTC,"Also, on another thought - can iTunes Match sync music between two machines? If so, then your problem is solved, no? You can just have a computer in each house running iTunes. The music gets synced via iTunes match (a one time thing), and then you can later stream that from the local machine."
sonos,2nv3q3,dasarp,1 point,Mon Dec 1 04:20:23 2014 UTC,Your suggestion about two computers was what I was trying to get away from.    I am doing that now but was looking for a cheaper way (NAS or something) than buying a new computer to replace one that is failing but that may be the easiest way to do things.    Buy and replace instead of mess around trying to get something going that may or may not work.  Thanks for the advice and helping me sort through this.

sonos,2nt2rd,Salamanagement,1 point,Sun Nov 30 02:46:30 2014 UTC,"I know that if you connect an analog audio device (cd, tape, etc) via stereo RCA to a Connect or Connect:Amp, you can play that signal throughout your Sonos network in stereo. Is the experience the same for the aux. input on the Play5? Are there any downsides to sending a signal through the aux. input and sending that signal to your entire Sonos network?   There's no functional difference between using the input on the CONNECT:AMP and the input on the PLAY:5.   Another thing I'd note - to use surrounds or a SUB with a PLAYBAR, you need to have a unit wired, but it doesn't necessarily have to be the PLAYBAR or any of the satellites."
sonos,2nt2rd,crummy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 03:07:25 2014 UTC,"My Playbar is laying on its back, too. It sounds awesome.  First I had only the Playbar because it was in stock.

sonos,2noylo,bluescrn,1 point,Fri Nov 28 20:32:38 2014 UTC,Current state is just getting the basic frontend set up (layout).

sonos,2no4be,red1284,3,Fri Nov 28 14:44:28 2014 UTC,I have the Playbar (with Sub and 2 Play:1 surround) and an Xbox One in my living room.  I have the optical cable coming from my TV.  Went from the One to the Playbar directly and didn't notice a difference.  I think the limiting factor will be how and what formats your TV passes the audio out in.

sonos,2no4be,rjgw,2,Fri Nov 28 20:01:49 2014 UTC,"You should definitely plug into the Xbox then enable Dolby 5.1 on the Xbox. Most TVs output PCM from the Optical port and that's not as good.

sonos,2nmbdu,soundcounsel,3,Thu Nov 27 23:27:41 2014 UTC,"The connect for your sweet living room system is exactly what you need, I have the same setup and I love it. Same goes for the Play 3 in my small kitchen.   The only place I have a play 1 is in the bathroom and it's perfect there but I would suggest for any or the larger rooms to stick to the play 3's (or 5) as the sound is much more full.  Something will need to be hardwired to the router. If none of these are close enough to the router to be wired pick up a Boost. That gets wired up to your router and creates the sonos wifi mesh network. Setup is super easy."
sonos,2nmbdu,bananagrammick,2,Fri Nov 28 04:30:03 2014 UTC,"Good advice, but I just thought I'd mention that there's no longer a requirement to be hardwired to your router.

sonos,2nlw6t,Christofftofferson,3,Thu Nov 27 22:08:54 2014 UTC,"I would advice against bluetooth, it makes it more complicated in setup and use.  To be honest it's a pretty strange usage case you have. I mean, I understand it, but you don't want to play the youtube or phone videos so that everyone can see (i.e. on a TV) but want everyone to hear?  If you changed it to ""I want to stream videos to my TV and want it to come out of sonos"" then playbar works great and there is no bluetooth hackery required.  I'm not trying to be nasty it's just i'm trying to be helpful :)"
sonos,2nlw6t,PonyDogs,2,Fri Nov 28 09:02:05 2014 UTC,"I get what you're saying about it being a seemingly strange use, but the biggest thing is that we listen to a lot of our music via YouTube. For instance, some of the music I like is very obscure (think SiriusXM ""chill"" channel)... They Rent very well known or popular songs that can be found on spotify or anything like that, but 99% of the time they can be found on YouTube. I don't need to watch any music videos or anything, just want to listen to a specific song when I want (and for free because it's youtube)"
sonos,2nlw6t,shadowjig,2,Fri Nov 28 17:00:12 2014 UTC,"For now I'll just plug my phone into the ""line in"" on my Sonos connect (or better yet - find a wireless bluetooth adapter to plug into the line in)..."

sonos,2nlw6t,Your_ImaginaryFriend,1 point,Sat Nov 29 00:06:44 2014 UTC,"I think the TV output is the best advice.  To expand on that, you can get a Chromecast and plug it into your TV and setup a Youtube playlist from your phone and push it to the Chromecast.  TV can output to Sonos or your Denon audio receiver.  Chromecast is $23 right now at Amazon.  I love my Sonos (I have 6 devices), but since you have an extremely specific taste in music and it's hard to find music you like on widely available services....you might not enjoy a Sonos.  Unless you're buying tracks and storing them on a network device for use on Sonos.  I personally buy the music I love and store it locally on a Synology NAS and I use the NAS mobile apps to download the music to my phone and play it (best setup ever, and I total control of everything).  NAS also comes in handy with the Chromecast....I can store movies on the NAS and push them to Chromecast via my phone."

sonos,2ndx3d,Theonetheycalljane,1 point,Wed Nov 26 04:29:54 2014 UTC,I've worked with SONOS a decent amount and I've always found it to be fairly expensive for what it adds.   I think the better questions are:  What do you not like about bluetooth? and What do you want your system to be able to do that it currently can not do?  Also - what do you stream your music from? Phone (what type)?
sonos,2ndx3d,Theonetheycalljane,1 point,Wed Nov 26 03:58:32 2014 UTC,The pairing process between my receiver and my phone is kinda a pain.   I'd be 100% set if my receiver supported Google Music   Samsung Galaxy S5 stock.
sonos,2ndx3d,drzowie,1 point,Wed Nov 26 05:10:11 2014 UTC,"Fair enough. I have the same phone that I can pair with my receiver via my wife network using Samsung link. Similar to apple airplay, and very similar to how SONOS connects as it also uses WiFi.  Does your receiver have this ability?  Another option for WiFi streaming would be a western digital TV.  Again, much cheaper than SONOS."
sonos,2ndx3d,drzowie,1 point,Wed Nov 26 12:58:45 2014 UTC,"The main advantage the SONOS has over other systems is that it synchronizes playback between zones.    There are some disadvantages too.  SONOS periodically updates their firmware over the net, and while it is ""optional"" their controllers will hound you with dialog boxes every single time you use your stereo, until you upgrade.  Sometimes you lose functionality with an upgrade.  I just posted about how my family's iPads stopped being able to control our stereo, because someone (can't tell who) agreed to upgrade the system, and the newer software locks out old versions of SONOS' controller software.  The upgrade is non-reversible."
sonos,2ndx3d,projectself,1 point,Tue Nov 25 17:42:48 2014 UTC,Cant you just upgrade the software on the devices and then you're good to go?
sonos,2ndx3d,nickentendo,1 point,Tue Nov 25 17:46:50 2014 UTC,"Usually.  In this case, they dropped support for iOS 5, which is the last major revision that Apple supports on iPads.  So it's not possible to run newer versions of the controller software on old iOS hardware.  SONOS locks out old versions of the controller software, which is sort of a dirty trick since it is all controlled via universal-plug-and-play, an open standard.  There are some third-party open source apps we can probably use, so there's probably a workaround.  Our issue is just an example of the more general problem that you are trusting a company with access to your stereo for long periods of time.  If their business model changes, your stereo could degrade or become useless.   (e.g. Zune)  That said, we've owned a SONOS system for a decade, and it delivers awesome sound and a good user experience. Except for the business about iOS 5."
sonos,2ne0m3,TimothyGonzalez,10,Tue Nov 25 17:29:16 2014 UTC,"When you say your flat has no wifi, does it have wired internet connections? You could connect a Sonos component to this, or connect a router to it.  If you have no internet at all, and you want to put your PLAY:5/CONNECT/CONNECT:AMP into autoplay line-in mode, connect an ethernet cable between a computer and your Sonos component. After a minute your player should show up on the controller (assuming they've been set up previously), and you can access Manage > Settings > Room Settings > Line-in, and set the Autoplay room.

sonos,2na0ox,nickdanger3d,1 point,Mon Nov 24 19:42:21 2014 UTC,"Yep.

Yes.   If I didn't have the BOOST, I would have to wire at least one of them to my switch (probably the PLAYBAR)?   Yes.   That only makes me wonder if this TV will output true 5.1 or not, which I can't seem to confirm.   That one I don't know, sorry."
sonos,2n3p5j,crummy,1 point,Sat Nov 22 22:02:07 2014 UTC,"Your playbar will accept optical in from your tv. Typically most tv's don't do dts out via optical. However, you can get an hdmi splitter which will route your audio from your hdmi signal to your playbar instead of your tv. It sounds like a pain but it's not bad. That being said, most folks are more than happy with the playbar, play 1s as rear and the sub taking all the low frequency. It's a clean, strong surround sound without any complications and just an easy setup. Exactly what Sonos is designed to do.  Feel free to pm if you have any specific setup questions. Your boost will eliminate any potential lag."

sonos,2mzwuc,Twymx,2,Fri Nov 21 22:56:26 2014 UTC,How long did you wait after wiring it to add the surrounds? And what did you wire your PLAYBAR to?  Check the About window in one of your controllers and look for WM:0 under your PLAYBAR to ensure it's in SonosNet mode.
sonos,2mzwuc,crummy,1 point,Fri Nov 21 21:43:47 2014 UTC,"I think, I may be wrong but don't you have to set up speakers first then add too the surrounds?   See if you can get them to play on there own.  Then add to surround system."

sonos,2mzwuc,bTrixy,1 point,Fri Nov 21 22:41:13 2014 UTC,As I remember correctly from the site you need to have a bridge or boost if you want a 5.1 surround sound. Just connecting a play system doesn't work for that.

sonos,2mrkoy,LastOfMen,6,Wed Nov 19 12:36:04 2014 UTC,"A turntable with no integrated amp at all will provide a 'phono level' output - this cannot be sent to any Sonos product and produce a good balanced sound.  A turntable of this kind should be connected to a receiver or amplifier with a 'phono in' - many cheap receivers do not have 'phono in' these days, only different 'line in' inputs.  Some turntables these days include an integrated phono amp / pre-amp which modulates the EQ of the phono signal to produce a line-level output.  If the one you are looking at has this (like the Vinyl Play, but there are others) then either you can connect it up to the back of your Play 5 directly, or to a Connect Amp if you want an extra pair of speakers running directly off the record player."

sonos,2mmrcz,dantheflyingman,3,Tue Nov 18 03:58:23 2014 UTC,You can put 2 pairs of 8 ohm speakers on a connect:amp.
sonos,2mmrcz,nickdanger3d,1 point,Tue Nov 18 13:36:09 2014 UTC,Great. I might just go with 2 connect amps in this case
sonos,2mmrcz,LandlockedPirate,2,Tue Nov 18 13:41:29 2014 UTC,"Personally I would go with the connect:amp.  I've always found the volume control fiddly with the connect.  The reason for that is obvious, the connect doesn't actually control the volume on the output amp, it just alters the output signal to control volume.  The other issue you mentioned (leaving the amp all the time) is a consideration too, and it will also affect the longevity of the amp in my experience."
sonos,2mlsku,josborne31,2,Mon Nov 17 22:39:54 2014 UTC,"short answer yes.  As long as you download the sonos app for pc then whatever the connect amp is hooked up to, you can stream it to those speakers."
sonos,2mlsku,Inferno13,1 point,Mon Nov 17 22:57:24 2014 UTC,Gotcha. I can definitely download the app for pc (or Mac/iPhone).
sonos,2mlsku,LandlockedPirate,2,Mon Nov 17 23:03:46 2014 UTC,"When you say stream, what exactly do you mean?  You could share a folder of music from your laptop and play that on the sonos.  You could connect the sonos to your spotify/pandora/whatever account and stream music that way.    If you mean can you just stream the audio out from your laptop to the sonos... That is not really what sonos is designed for.  I did find this thread where people found that they could ""play to"" the sonos using DLNA if your laptop is windows 7+ so that could be an option.  If all you want is is to stream your audio out, you might consider something like airfoil and an airport express + amp.  You could do that for less money than the sonos (but it also doesn't do all the things sonos does, like synced up multiroom audio etc)"
sonos,2mlsku,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Tue Nov 18 03:26:54 2014 UTC,I'm looking to steam music either from Pandora (from laptop/iPhone) or from iTunes. I'm not looking to have my laptop's sounds playing over Sonos.
sonos,2mlsku,LandlockedPirate,3,Tue Nov 18 14:03:37 2014 UTC,"Pandora, no problem. iTunes... again, it depends.  You want to have Sonos play your local drm-free music lib via file share, no problem.  You want it to play iTunes radio or DRMed itunes music... problem.  Sonos does not support airplay etc (without 3rd party apps).  Basically don't think of the sonos as a means of playing a stream from your computer, think of it as an independent music player.  All the apps really do is control it (couple caveats, the mobile apps can stream local music etc).  I love my sonos, but honestly the main value of the sonos system for me is multi-room audio.  I think in most cases, if you're not doing multi-room, there's probably a cheaper solution than sonos.  As much as I like to talk up sonos, the last thing I want is for someone to buy it and find out that it doesn't do what they want it to do, and it kind of sounds like that might be the case for you."
sonos,2mip48,devianteng,3,Mon Nov 17 01:56:56 2014 UTC,Get the boost. Set for the future. No lag no latency no drop offs. Easily doubles any range you had before. Def segregates any prior congestion with sonos net. Retail on it is 99. Drop us a pm we give a reddit discount with free shipping. Play 1 s are the most underrated speaker out there. Pair them up and they will truly surprise you. Ton of sound from a small cube.
sonos,2mip48,Soundtekgroup,1 point,Mon Nov 17 02:49:33 2014 UTC,"Regarding the Play:1, you are absolutely right.  Multiple trips to Target and Best Buy, I'd spend easily 30-45 minutes playing with all 3 models.  Personally, I didn't see much gain between the 1 and 3, but that's just me.  I'd love to check out a pair of 1's in stereo, but I think that would be overkill for a bedroom!  I can definitely see a playbar, sub, and pair of 1's for a living room setup, though.  So send you a pm when I want to order a new device from sonos' website and I can get a discount/free shipping?  That's pretty sweet!

Now the 3 is definitely a great sounding speaker, but I'd rather save the $100 and get the 1.  I'm probably going to be buying a BOOST today, and my next purchase will likely be another PLAY:1 later this week for stereo in the bedroom. :)  After that, I dunno.  I wouldn't mind a PLAY:5 for the living room, but I think I'd rather get a PLAYBAR, SUB, and 2 PLAY:1's for a living room TV setup, and also use that for music.  Probably a single PLAY:1 for the home office (who am I kidding...it will probably 2 PLAY:1's), and something for the garage (PLAY:3, maybe?).  Gah...new addiction!"

sonos,2mip48,crummy,1 point,Mon Nov 17 18:00:27 2014 UTC,"I don't really understand why you'd get the BOOST if you're not having any wireless problems?  Like you said, wireless coverage in your house isn't a concern."
sonos,2melu9,eXeler0n,1 point,Sat Nov 15 20:16:11 2014 UTC,"Hi,  I can't give a ""real"" opinion on the two Play 1's being better than a Play 5 but I'm presuming yes as it would  give wider stereo.   If your wifi is not great I would recommend buying a boost to plug directly in to your router. This gives the Sonos a dedicated network that is 5 x stronger than the bridge did.   Also, obviously, nothing is certain this life but I can't see Sonos struggling anytime soon, they dominate the ""Everyman"" multi room speaker market."
sonos,2melu9,biggysnax,5,Sat Nov 15 21:03:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the Play:1 vs. Play:5 argument isn't easy.  The Play:5 has much better sound in my opinion. Deeper bass, better highs and mids. Very nice all around sound. The Play:1 definitely does good sound, just not like the 3 or 5. However, it depends what we're talking about here. One Play:5 vs. two Play:1 in a really big room? The Play:1 may be a better option because of the ability to distribute the sound with different points off dispersion. The Play:5 would still sound better though."
sonos,2melu9,calidoc,2,Sat Nov 15 22:46:47 2014 UTC,"Play:5 just has bass you will never get from a Play:1. If that matters to you, choose Play:5 for sure. Overall, the sound from the Play:5 is better as well, but, obviously, you don't get stereo separation. My unorthodox opinion here is that you will notice and appreciate the better sound more than the stereo unless you are a ""listening room"" kind of person.  To me, the disappointment is the Play:3. It is better than the Play:1, but not by so much that I wouldn't just buy two Play:1s or a Play:5. To my ears, the Play:3 is just kind of a tweener."
sonos,2melu9,Throwaway_bicycling,1 point,Sun Nov 16 00:12:52 2014 UTC,"Hi,  Thank you for this comments. I would use the speaker(s) in a 24 square meter room. The play 1 would be around one meter away from each other. I'm not sure because of stereo.  UT as I could hear in shop has a better sound (cause of low mid and high speakers?).   For WiFi I thought about a normal booster, not the Sonos one. It's much cheaper and would improve WiFi for all devices. Also normal LAN is available, if this is an option."
sonos,2melu9,Twymx,3,Sat Nov 15 22:53:37 2014 UTC,The thing with the Sonos boost is that it creates its own proprietary mesh network and leaves your regular WiFi for other traffic. So all the media streaming is not clogging up your home WiFi. It's more robust and has greater reach for when you expand the system later. Its not a necessity anymore but if you know your WiFi is spotty it would probably be worth the purchase
sonos,2melu9,Throwaway_bicycling,1 point,Sat Nov 15 23:48:30 2014 UTC,"Twymx beat me to it. The points of Sonos here are Mesh+not your regular network. Reviews have been very positive, so I am planning to replace my bridge with a boost like tomorrow. I will post impressions."
sonos,2melu9,brakingitdown,2,Sun Nov 16 00:09:24 2014 UTC,"A couple of points: 1. If you can easily wire lan 1 speaker, it will create its own mesh separate from your wifi. You only need Boost if other components are far away, or lots of interference. 2. Sonos really is most useful in multi zone, so I would recommend 2 Play:1s if that is your current budget limit. Because they are simple to move, they give you flexibility to try things out with 2 zones, or as a stereo pair."
sonos,2melu9,ChrisTheRazer,1 point,Sun Nov 16 11:19:37 2014 UTC,"Hello, I like to use the speakers as a start. Later I'll buy more for TV (5.1) and for different rooms. I think, the Play 5 is a good speaker for my current room and later can be used as single speaker for a room like a kitchen. On the other hand, two Play 1 would be a start for TV speakers (later bar and sub).  As LAN is possible, I could use Play 5 as bridge? Play 1 too?  Thanks for your help."

sonos,2laqz2,Twymx,2,Wed Nov 5 21:01:07 2014 UTC,I have the same setup. I have a Connect attached to my home theater and a play 5 in my philosophers room (aka the drinking room) the only problem is that I have the Connect set to variable volume and my receiver has to be turned up to max volume in order to hear it and control volume from the Somos app. If I switch to a new input such as cable TV it about blows me out of the room. If I set Sonos to fixed volume I have to use two apps to control the volume. I prefer variable volume and set my Receiver to a high volume and instead of switching inputs turn off the system with my Harmony remote and then pick watch TV and have the receiver set to 30% volume every time its turned on.  This keeps me from ear piercing volumes when switching inputs. Hope that helps. If I had to do it all over again I'd just get the Playbar and a sub for my home theater.

I am having trouble understanding your network topology. From your description, it sounds as if your wall ports could be going through a different router, that is controlled at the building level. Your wireless clients are on your own office router, one hop below the wall ports..  It may be as simple as changing the wireless router for a wireless access point. But who knows...it's hard to say without actually seeing it or jumping on the machines and doing some ping testing."

sonos,2kopci,seantrowbridge,3,Wed Oct 29 20:51:27 2014 UTC,"Let me ask you a question.... If you disconnect the router completely, do your wired computers remain connected to the internet? If so, then it is likely the only thing your router is doing is getting people on via WiFi.   If the above scenario is the case, you should try out a wireless access point - which is really what you should be using anyway.  Fully disconnect the router, bring up the access point and configure the SSID with the same name and password.    If it does work (everyone connecting to Sonos AND internet), then stop using the router. It is doing a bunch of things you probably don't need, like NAT, firewall, etc.     If it doesn't work, simply put your router back in and return it in a few days. Then you will call in a local IT resource to help.  Note that you will probably need to set up your wireless printer again for everyone at the conclusion of this test - successful or not, since it will probably get a new IP address."
sonos,2kopci,crummy,4,Wed Oct 29 21:35:38 2014 UTC,"Essentially, you need to make sure that all your Sonos components and any devices that you want to control your system get an IP address from the same router. In this case it sounds like you've got some central wired network router, and a wireless router.  I'd suggest modifying some settings on your wireless router so instead of handing out IP addresses, it just behaves as a wireless access point for your existing wired network. To do so: * Log into the router * Disable DHCP * Ensure its IP address is outside the DHCP range of your primary router (though preferably still in the same subnet) * Connect an ethernet cable from one of the LAN ports on the wireless router to the existing wired network  Edit: You can verify this by comparing the IP addresses on your Sonos system and wired computers. And, not sure what kind of an office environment you have but this could possibly tick off your IT department."

I would guess from your description that the people on the wired and wireless networks are on two different subnets. Because of this, they can't really talk to each other. If you really want to make it happen, I would suggest you talk with your IT person, as the changes needed would need to be documented"

sonos,2kopci,nickdanger3d,1 point,Wed Oct 29 21:23:21 2014 UTC,"I work with networks.. a few questions.    It sounds like the wired network is different from the wireless network, in that they have different routers and perhaps may not be connected.  However, you say the wireless printer is reachable by the wired users.  If that is the case, there is a good chance you can get this working.    Let me ask a few more specific questions.   Confirm the wireless printer is reachable by wired users, and also reachable by wireless users?    Can you determine what wireless network the printer is on?  Usually the have a test button to print out configuration.  Look at the connection details of the connection, note the ""SSID"" which is the wireless network name.  Is it the same as your wireless users?  Also note three things, the ""IP address"", the ""subnet mask"", and the ""default gateway"" from that paper.    On a wired machine, get the same 3 pieces of information from a machine.  ip address, subnet mask, gateway.  google for how to do this as explaining it is simple, but awkward to describe.    Then on a wireless machine, do the exact same thing.      From the above, if all three networks have identical ""subnet mask"" and identical ""default gateway"", you can either confirm or deny 100% if they are on the same network/share the same router.    If they are, then there may be security practices in place on purpose to keep wireless users segregated from the more secure wired network.  Maybe fixable, maybe not.    If they are not, then we would look at how the printer is functioning, there may be a static NAT in place to map the device.    Go find out details about your setup and report back."

The files are DRM protected (m4p) - less common now The files are in a format Sonos cannot play (WMA lossless, not much else) You've indexed ~65k tracks already and there's no more room in the index"

sonos,2jzbyp,easytiger,-1,Wed Oct 22 12:14:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. Really ashamed of Sonos on reading this.   Sonos not only helped to invent the wireless speaker category   well that's not true. Any Bluetooth speaker could claim this. Wireless RF home entertainment solutions also existed long before Sonos.   Sonos is the owner of nearly 40 U.S. Patents related to modern audio technology, as well as nearly 250 pending U.S. patent applications.   Granting a patent in the modern world is almost meaningless.   Defendants are merely copying Sonos’s system.   Give me a break.    For example, Defendants’ use of the “HEOS” name for its wireless audio system is similar enough to “Sonos” that it led one industry publication to remark that “we can’t help but feel the similarity was deliberate.” See Ex. J (from www.avhub.com.au)   Are consumers being mislead by this? I don't think so.    closely resembles Sonos’s naming convention for its line of wireless speakers (e.g., Denon’s HEOS 3, HEOS 5, HEOS 7 vs. Sonos’s PLAY:1, PLAY:3, PLAY:5)   Using numbers to name something? Revolutionary.   Defendants’ website for the HEOS products also has a layout that is similar to Sonos’s website, as shown below.   Err... fucking hell. Did a child come up with this? If this is true then Sonos have stolen that design as it is the same as every other online retailer   which is configured to operate either in a “no pairing” mode or in a “stereo pairing” mode—embodies one or more of the devices, methods, and/or computer-readable media claimed in the ‘080 patent   One of the most obvious things to do is the stereo mode. The product is worthless without it. You can patent basic requirements. You can patent the method you use to achieve that. Have they stolen the method? Or is the method driven completely by the requirement thus leading to simultaneous discovery?   Additionally and/or alternatively   Definitely written by someone pretending to be a lawyer   Defendants intentionally cause, urge, or encourage users of the HEOS system to directly infringe one or more claims of the ‘080 patent by promoting, advertising, and instructing customers and potential customers about the HEOS .. (c) Defendants know (or should know) that their actions will induce users of the HEOS system to directly infringe one or more claims the ‘080 patent, and (d) users of the HEOS system directly infringe one or more claims of the ‘080 patent.   Sonos are now threatening users of the system with patent violation for applying a configuration. That isn't on.  And it goes on in the same manner. Silly. We should welcome competition as users."

A common example is my playbar is wireless but provides two Ethernet ports I use to get the Xbox and TV connected to the network.   A less common setup I'm using is a bridge located in an outdoor box by my pool equipment to connect it to my network so I can operate the pool with wireless apps. The pool equipment has a 900Mhz wireless radio but it costs $300-$500 when i checked.  A leftover bridge with the pool equipment ""protocol adapter"" connected by Ethernet has worked flawlessly for almost 2 years now."

sonos,2jqq2i,BigWesternMan,2,Mon Oct 20 14:50:39 2014 UTC,Yeah it's a little bit more straightforward - plus the Sonos app is a little more difficult to use than the Spotify one - easier to just let it play through a playlist and let Spotify do the hard graft :)
sonos,2jqq2i,andrewrobinson,5,Mon Oct 20 15:02:35 2014 UTC,"Well the feature isn't available natively in Sonos, so your only option (as far as I can tell) would be to create your own Web App that wraps the Sonos API and handles Queueing/user management/logging etc...

This guy creates an Airplay source and pipes it to his Sonos and possibly this sidebar linkmight be relevant.  So presumably you need to do a similar thing but with just line in (or USB audio in).

sonos,2jgq1i,digitalhuxley,1 point,Fri Oct 17 12:51:39 2014 UTC,"Using a play:5 for that wont work because there will be unavoidable lag. Only the playbar can do tv sound without lag.  Now, if youre using xbmc or plex home theater, that can be mitigated since they can put a delay on the video, but for a roku, bluray player, game system, or cable box you NEED a playbar for this."
sonos,2jgq1i,nickdanger3d,1 point,Fri Oct 17 12:49:18 2014 UTC,"If the TV is directly connected to the 5, as an auxiliary speaker to make the sound better then there wouldn't be any lag surely?

Play a smooth jazz channel; get Richard Cheese three songs in. Artist radio is just as bad.   I moved to Google Play music and it's a night and day comparison.  Still - it's free.
sonos,2j8zce,biggysnax,3,Tue Oct 14 20:18:15 2014 UTC,"It depends mainly on where you would be mainly listening to it.  Smaller rooms (bedrooms, office, bathrooms) then a play:1 is good. Larger rooms then go for the play:3.  You can always add more & move them around as you expand your system!"
sonos,2j8zce,amellors,3,Tue Oct 14 20:33:52 2014 UTC,"My concern is over room size, bit hard to answer but what sort of size room would a Play 1 be good for?  I wish the 1 and 3 had a line in as well as the 5!"
sonos,2j8zce,amellors,2,Tue Oct 14 21:05:16 2014 UTC,"If you are concerned I would lean towards the Play:3.    Since then it should fill most rooms well (with the exception of very large areas).

sonos,2j8zce,amellors,2,Tue Oct 14 21:07:59 2014 UTC,Thanks.  I am wanting to use the line in for my tv and then be able to stream the sound from my tv around the house.

sonos,2j8zce,rjgw,2,Tue Oct 14 21:15:16 2014 UTC,"In order to get the TV audio from the Playbar to other players, they need to be grouped.  This is unlike the like line-in on the play:5.  That linein can be played by player in the system.  But the linein on the play5 is the 8mm jack like a normal headphones.  The linein on the Playbar is an optical in."

sonos,2j8zce,rjgw,3,Wed Oct 15 00:15:45 2014 UTC,"The Play:1 gets a bad rep round here and I just don't know why. I've got (in order of purchase) two Play:3s, a Playbar and two Play:1s. The Play:1s are amazing for the price and make a great place to start. I don't care what anyone here says, using two Play:1 in a Stereo pair beats single Play:3s and single Play:5s hands down.  I even did a side by side comparison of the Play:3s and Play:1s in stereo pairs and I was convinced the Play:1s sounded better. I don't know if it's because they're newer or have better tech..  At the end of the day, you can buy from Sonos.com on a 100 day trial. Buy a bunch of stuff and try it out!"

I'm looking forward to more next year, maybe a 5 or bar for upstairs, but I don't think you can go wrong with a 1 - if you expand in the future there will always be a room for it!"
sonos,2j8zce,Soundtekgroup,2,Wed Oct 15 10:31:16 2014 UTC,That to me sounds like a good plan. Definitely give the Play:1 a chance. I'd replace both my Play:3s in bedrooms with Play:1s if I was starting from scratch.  Are you anywhere near the North west?

I was planning to buy a 5 for my bedroom, but now I'm interested in pairing two 1's instead. How is the bass level with the two 1's paired together. Of what I've heard of the 1, it sounded too tinny for my taste."
sonos,2j8zce,Kllian,3,Fri Jan 2 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"Start with a pair of play 1s. Pair them in stereo and then unpair them and move them around the house. You don't necessarily need a bridge but, I'd add one just to separate the bandwidth from your existing wifi. Worst case, if the mrs doesn't like it, the resale is quite strong on a pair of play 1s. Just keep the boxes and materials etc. I've seen that set on used ebay go for 80 to 85% of retail. So, you will be safe.  Load up spotify, pandora, iTunes etc and show your wife. Trust me she will love it.  The play 3s are great as well but, starting off a lot of folks start with the play ones which pack a surprising amount of sound.  We are a dealer for sonos and other audio products. You can get them online, best buy, target or dealers. But, like others said next thing you will want a playbar and sub etc. just to warn you!"
sonos,2j8zce,10weight,2,Wed Oct 15 02:05:35 2014 UTC,"Depends what loudness you're looking for really.  I convinced my mom to get a play 5 for her dining room kitchen and it can easily fill out the whole apartment with sound ( open space kind of apartment ).   I'm sure the play 3 could've done the job too but it lacks in bass personally for me even compared to the play 1.  I have two play ones for my basement and I normally don't turn it over 40% volume otherwise my dad can hear it upstairs. Especially if you turn on the bass up.  Definitely go for a play 1 in my opinion. You can then go and set them in stereo or use one in each room. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."
sonos,2j8zce,10weight,1 point,Wed Oct 15 19:01:53 2014 UTC,Thanks mate. I think I'm going to go for a 5 just in the lounge purely so that I can use the line in to stream the TV sound around the house. So frustrating about the lack of line in on the three at least.
sonos,2j8zce,ChuqTas,2,Wed Oct 15 19:49:27 2014 UTC,"Yes, pretty annoying indeed. I wish all there speakers had one, but it kind of defeats their purpose of wireless I guess hehe. I plan to get a Play 5 so I can use it as my PC speaker as well.  You'll love the 5 for sure!"
sonos,2j8zce,AMidgetAndAClub,2,Thu Oct 16 19:05:59 2014 UTC,"I personally would hold back on the Play 1, especially as it seems you are looking at a single speaker.  I bought my parents a play 3 and it fills the (largish) room well but I miss the true stereo separation.  If you buy (over time) two Play 3s you will kick your self for not waiting to get two Play 5s.  One Play 5 is probably what I would recommend as an entry level speaker so you can grow. I appreciate it's a high bar on a budget. You can't pair a Play 3 with a Play 5 though and stereo separation makes a huge difference.  Play 3s lack bass.  Saying that Play 5s do when you have a sub...  Shit, it's like crack.  Not even once.  Get out before you're in."

The Airport Express is not part of that path.  3) AirPlay (the audio tech delivered by the Airport Express) is a way to deliver exactly one audio stream from one device (iPhone, iPad, desktop computer, notebook computer) to one or more receivers, where the receiver is a WiFi-enabled speaker or an Aiport Express.

sonos,2iq2ho,dumplinghead,1 point,Thu Oct 9 09:43:17 2014 UTC,"Is is but if you think about it, a system to handle 260,000 tracks needs a lot more hardware (cpu and memory) than what's inside a sonos. They could release a bridge type device that had the provisions to handle a larger library, but i doubt they will due to the amount of customers that are anywhere near the 65,000 track limit, cloud streaming services are now far more popular. The best result at the moment would come from offloading the DB management to another service like subsonic or cloudplayer."
sonos,2iq2ho,garywoo,1 point,Thu Oct 9 09:54:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I guess. I just use sonospy. Free, open source, and runs fine on my 4 year old celeron has that also hosts my music. Can also customise folder structure and integrates into the global search in the sonos controller now. Not sure why I'd want to pay for mmtm? I still can't quite figure out how that works. Is the music streamed from a local subsonic to their service and then back to a sonos?"
sonos,2iq2ho,dumplinghead,1 point,Thu Oct 9 10:55:32 2014 UTC,"Sonospy is a good alternative for MMTM. I think what you've described is how MMTM works, and is therefore not free as they have to handle your music on their servers and could potentially use a lot of bandwidth. Since you're offloading this to your own server, Sonospy is a great free solution if you have the provisions to run it."

sonos,2iq2ho,dumplinghead,1 point,Thu Oct 9 11:06:09 2014 UTC,"Local Playback - I think that would be a bad idea for them as it would essentially allow you to turn any speaker into a sonos with something like a  raspberry pi, or any ipod dock speaker, or any PC connected home theatre, while it would be great for consumers, it would seriously hurt their sales as most people are buying for the software rather than the hardware."
sonos,2iq2ho,garywoo,1 point,Thu Oct 9 09:26:59 2014 UTC,They could solve that problem by not allowing remote control of local playback. So using the controller you can play music through the current controller.
sonos,2iq2ho,YM_Industries,1 point,Thu Oct 9 10:29:36 2014 UTC,"That would be a completely different app in that case. Why would they go to all the trouble of re-making the current (much better) existing apps for the likes of spotify, google play music and all the rest, within their own app. At current the sonos app does not even handle music or receive any streams, all it does is send a command to the speakers, and has the ability to stream from the devices storage. It would be like re-inventing your TV remote to actually to watch TV on."
sonos,2iq2ho,garywoo,1 point,Thu Oct 9 10:55:48 2014 UTC,"I don't see it that way at all. It would be a cross-platform app/program that I could use to play music from almost any source both locally and to my remote speakers. Like OP said, ""Sonos could become your ONLY audio app."" That would be a very healthy position for Sonos to be in.  As for being a completely different app, as you mentioned, the existing app already has media server capabilities as well as remote control capabilities, media player doesn't seem too far fetched. From an implementation point of view it wouldn't be too difficult, and it certainly makes sense as a business move."
sonos,2iq2ho,YM_Industries,1 point,Thu Oct 9 11:32:58 2014 UTC,"I don't think many of the streaming providers would allow it, why would they want customers to use another app for the same service they already deliver, that is not in their control. With their own apps they can serve ads, collect data, control the user environment way more than just letting sonos make a consolidated experience for all services. Its fair enough if they are integrating it with hardware like their speaker range, but just recreating services is not terribly useful for anyone. There's hardly any effort required as it currently stands if you want to use spotify (or any other streaming service) and sonos, play spotify, use sonos, same device, same time."

sonos,2inw45,fadetogloss,2,Wed Oct 8 16:38:33 2014 UTC,Start with the playbar. Good bass response. Then at some point grab the sub. You can always pair the 3s later on when you get a sub for surround sound. The sub will do amazing sounds for your system.

I'm sure it will be the same for when your computer puts out sound. I would warn you though... if you are trying to make a permanent connection to the sonos and your computer, the sonos will likely switch over anytime any noise is made on your computer (such as an error message).

I have a Sonos Connect and an HK BlueTooth dongle turning up tomorrow, then the BlueTooth dongle works on the line in for the Connect.  The 5, Connect and Connect:Amp are required as they have the line in ports that the 1 and 3 don't have. Sonos may release BlueTooth in the future, may be not."
sonos,2gt1q0,ansedd95,5,Wed Jan 28 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"In the morning when I hit ""I'm awake"" in GentleAlarm my Tasker fires a trigger to my Macronos app on Android. This starts an Internet radio station on my Sonos with groovy 70-disco.  Also, when I plug in earphones on my way to work the same setup silences all audio sources.  Simple, but a nice-to-have feature. Recommended!"
sonos,2gt1q0,jrddit,1 point,Fri Sep 19 09:26:38 2014 UTC,So does macronos work as a Sonos plugin from tasker? I've been trying to figure out using tasker + pushbullet to automate some sonos but didn't want to fork out for the paid version just to experiment.
sonos,2gt1q0,ansedd95,1 point,Sun Oct 12 10:34:04 2014 UTC,"Yes. You can create any kind of actions, like start playing radio on the playbar at 10% volume. And then activate from tasker like any other plugin.   I haven't tried more complex stuff like change volume as a variable from tasker.   Buy it. :)"

sonos,2ge2uh,PurifyWithFire,3,Sun Sep 14 19:12:47 2014 UTC,Maybe get another Play:5 and a Play:1.  Make a stereopair with both Play:5's and add the sub. That combo beats the playbar any time. Use the play:1 where ever you like.
sonos,2ge2uh,milanbourbeck,1 point,Mon Sep 15 07:36:43 2014 UTC,"Ok, that is a good idea! Getting a second Play:5 is an idea I hadn't thought of for some odd reason. I will definitely consider!"
sonos,2ge2uh,milanbourbeck,1 point,Mon Sep 15 17:58:14 2014 UTC,I have 2 Play:5 a Sub and 4 Play:1. Since i sell Sonos at my work i know how all those speakers sound in and out. 2 Play:5 in a stereo pair just kick the Playbars ass. Its not bad at all but if you dont use it for a TV then get the Play:5's You have way more freedome with that. Also the Sub is just balls. I love it. The Play:1 are great in the kitchen or bathroom. You put them somewhere and forget about them. They are so small and have such a great sound.
sonos,2ge2uh,bananagrammick,2,Mon Sep 15 18:07:24 2014 UTC,"I have a couple of questions before I answer the question, Why do you want more speakers? what do you hope to achieve? do you watch movies or listen to music more? what type of music/movies? what is the room setup like?  Also I'm sure this might be blasphemy on this sub-reddit but sonos has great features and useability especially for multi-zone setups but isn't the best sound per dollar. For both of the computer setups in my apartment we are using near field active studio monitors (Mackie MR5MK2/Audio Engine A5+) and in my opinion you can't get anywhere near the sound out of Sonos for the price. A pair of Mackie's can be had for $240 or less and destroy my play 3/play 5 in both volume and range. Just a thought but if you would let me know more about what you're doing I would be happy to try and point you in the direction I feel would be best for you.  FYI - I own a play 1, play 3, and connect at home and use the entire line of sonos at work."
sonos,2ge2uh,bananagrammick,1 point,Mon Sep 15 14:20:19 2014 UTC,"I'm looking for surround sound (3.1 or 5.1) in my room. I'm just looking to expand it so it has an office/home theater feel depending what I'm doing. I play music while I study or work, but it's also where I play games and watch movies (when I have time). The reason I have chosen Sonos is the wireless ability and how compact it is. I do own (for now) a Harman Kardon AVR 2600 along with speakers (Infinity's), but having that takes up a lot of room. Next year when I have an apartment I will have speakers in more than one room. I would say I listen to more music than movies. As far as genre goes, it's a large range. I appreciate many different styles: from metalcore (probably most common), to rap, to instrumental, and classical/orchestral. Movies is also a very broad range, I watch a lot of movies with friends and it depends what kind of mood we are all in as well as who I am with. Sorry if that is a very vague answer, I just have broad taste."
sonos,2ge2uh,nickdanger3d,1 point,Mon Sep 15 17:55:28 2014 UTC,"So this is where things get a little tricky from a Sonos point of view and what you have already. I will try to lay out my thoughts as best I can with any downsides I can think of:  A second play 5 - Two Play 5's are great for music and can be put in different rooms when you move into your apartment which is a huge plus but I'm assuming you're using the line in for watching movies currently and while you could split that and feed it across the wire moving them far enough apart to get a good stereo pair would mean wires everywhere and probably not what you want. Sending the audio wirelessly to the speakers introduces lag as others have said. If you are unhappy with the bass on the play 5 you have a 2nd one isn't going to add too much more and you will have to pick up the sub which may be handy in the future but is fairly expensive. (price: $400/$1100 with sub)  2 Play:3's - not quite as nice for music from a quality prospective but if you have a large space you're trying to fill up then this could be the better option. This does limit you to using your computer audio over airplay/upnp which isn't great. I think you'll be able to get about the same amount of bass out of the three speakers as the two above but coming out of more locations the upper register will seem more full. You could get the sub to help fill in the audio keep the play 5 up front and use the 3s as a stereo pair in the rear. Then, when you move, put the play 5 in another room and pick up the sound bar as you'll (probably) have a living room. (price: $600/$1300 with sub)  Playbar - For what it sounds like you're trying to do, without seeing the space and knowing more, this is probably my least favorite option. The Play 1/3 have a 5Ghz channel that allow it to work the Playbar but the Play:5 doesn't. The playbar and Play:5 have different tonal and spacial sounds that to my ears sound like very very different speakers that shouldn't be played together. I think in this case getting a Playbar might mean moving the Play:5 to the kitchen or something. I think the playbar is only worth it when hooked up to a TV.  music notes - metalcore is pretty easy music for speakers as the range isn't usually huge and speed of the speakers is most important, this is easy for all of these small drivers. Rap basically just needs bass and the sub would do wonders. Orchestral is the real pain in the ass here as getting the detail and soundstage correct is the hardest."
sonos,2ge2uh,peaceshark,1 point,Mon Sep 15 20:23:59 2014 UTC,"music will be fine with 2 play3s, but movies will not.  How do you plan on sending the movie audio to the speakers? Without the playbar's optical input there is a small (but very noticable) amount of lag.   Potentially, you could devise a system to send your computer's audio to the sonos using airplay or upnp, but then you'd need to be able to fix the lag.   XBMC and plex home theater (and probably vlc etc too) have audio lag adjustments to delay the video to match it up, but its not automatic and its not perfect (you can only adjust in 25ms increments, for example, but that should be enough to get you within a frame or so.)"
sonos,2ge2uh,calidoc,1 point,Mon Sep 15 17:55:52 2014 UTC,Just get a Playbar over 2 1s or 3s. You will NOT be disappointed.
sonos,2ge2uh,peaceshark,2,Sun Sep 14 22:39:47 2014 UTC,"I feel like since they don't own a TV, that two of another speaker may be a better option. Especially down the road where you may want to split them up into different locations. Not to mention the footprint issue."

sonos,2g8raw,hangoverprone,4,Fri Sep 12 22:38:36 2014 UTC,"The way I do it is by using airsonos to make my speakers show up as airplay speakers, then just set my phones audio to output to that.   I have an iphoneso this works for me but i know there are apps to give you airplay output on android if youre rooted. Alternately, sonos has upnp support, and i think theres probably an android app that could skip the airsonos step and just output directly. One thing to keep in mind is that the audio probably wont be synced."

sonos,2g8raw,completeturnaround,1 point,Fri Sep 12 22:39:05 2014 UTC,I use a roundabout way. I have a play bar and a couple of play 3s. I Chromecast YouTube to my TV and then group my play bar with the other speaker to get the desired effect
sonos,2g074r,bananagrammick,2,Wed Sep 10 13:55:32 2014 UTC,I think the price is pretty high at $20/mo but it's exciting to see people take streaming audio quality more seriously. I'm not sure how much benefit this will bring to the smaller Sonos speakers as the play 1/3 I have don't have a real benefit from flac files. The biggest thing is I hope it brings better support for lossless audio on Sonos.

sonos,2fw4ct,neoraptox,4,Tue Sep 9 09:03:45 2014 UTC,"I'm going to assume you know the basics of how Sonos operates.   from what I understand they will do what we want but I am not quite sure what we would need to set up a system across the house,    The only thing you really need is a router, and a Sonos product hooked up to it using an internet port. This could be a speaker, a bridge or Boost (see below)   especially with a potentially dodgy Wi-Fi system in a house that big.    Next month Sonos will release the Boost, which should take care of that problem.   Once you've done that, the only thing left to do is scatter some speakers across the house where you see fit.  If you're really going to listen to them for long periods of time, I suggest buying one or two play:5's (400$ each), which can be put in stereo mode, and possible add a Sub (700$). If you are buying Sonos for some easy listening or background music, placing some Play:1's(200$) or Play:3's(300$) in your bedroom or kitchen might already do the trick.  If you want to have the possibility to stream your TVs audio to Sonos, you're going to want to buy the playbar(700$), which combined with the Sub produces phenomenal 3.1 surround sound. This can be upgraded to 5.1 using a pair of Play:1s or 3s. This does not work with the play:5.  I found your question to be a bit vague, but I hope this helped. You can always PM me or post more questions in the sub if things aren't clear."
sonos,2fw4ct,Rimbodie,3,Tue Sep 9 11:42:49 2014 UTC,"If youre putting sonos in every room and you use a bridge, it probably wont be an issue since sonos creates its own mesh network. But if there are large gaps between speakers, you might want to include an extra bridge or two as repeaters.  The Sonosnet is separate from your home wifi as long as you have one speaker or bridge plugged in via ethernet."
sonos,2fw4ct,nickdanger3d,1 point,Tue Sep 9 11:07:42 2014 UTC,"As of last week or so, the Sonos speakers can work without any bridge at all. They use your home WiFi to reach places where their own mesh network cannot.   This gives you some added flexibility in terms of placement as they can talk to one another or your home network.   edit: I do understand OP said they have dodgy WIFI, but just wanted to be clear for others. As /u/Rimbodie said, boost should help take care of that once it's out."
sonos,2fw4ct,mmcnama4,1 point,Tue Sep 9 22:21:46 2014 UTC,"I still recommend using a bridge, avoids using bandwidth on your network, which for most people is already plagued with devices. Plus, $50 and a small footprint is very little for what you get.   Or, if you use another device in the area, use that instead."
sonos,2fw4ct,calidoc,2,Thu Sep 11 17:45:57 2014 UTC,Decent arguments.
sonos,2fw4ct,mmcnama4,1 point,Fri Sep 12 12:27:24 2014 UTC,I just got a play:1 without any bridge and it works brilliantly - router on a different floor and it's fine.  The play:1 is enough for a small room.  I'd suggest getting a play:1 and then expanding to more play:1s and possibly play:3s for other rooms or stereo pairs.
sonos,2ft379,FabricatiDiemPvnc,3,Mon Sep 8 14:01:08 2014 UTC,"The sales that I have seen are generally something along the lines of ""buy x speaker(s) and get a bridge for free.""  I haven't seen much discounting if that is what you are looking for."

Then you have to plan on what you need. Most people buy a play 3 or a play 1 to start there system. It takes a few minutes (2-3) to install the app and recognize your first speaker. You will spend your first hours playing music from spotify, pandora, Sirius, xm, slacker and even your own music collection. You will be amazed at how easy and intuitive the Sonos system operates with music. Your wife will sigh at another tech purchase. That is, until she uses and realizes how simple it really is. Next, you will consider additional speakers and even home theater options. Bottom line, every Sonos component works seamlessly with the next. No lag. No skip. You can stream hip hop to the garage, kids music to the pool, country to the kitchen and watch a blu-Ray in the media room. Sonos stands behind there product.

sonos,2foqsu,AMidgetAndAClub,4,Thu Sep 18 04:56:28 2014 UTC,"Your first mistake is thinking you could start off with a Play 1. If you are just looking for music to play in your home and a really good sounding speaker you can move around, just bite the bullet and go for the Play 5.  In my honest opinion, it blows all other speakers out of the water in this category. I personally think the closest in sound quality was the Bose units. But they couldn't do what I wanted.  Start with a Play 5. Play 1's only have their space as rear fill for a 5.1 setup. I couldn't be happier with my Play 5. I plan on picking up another Play 5 soon.  Don't start with a Play 1. It's just a bad idea."
sonos,2foqsu,Throwaway_bicycling,2,Sun Sep 7 02:37:07 2014 UTC,"It depends on what you need to do. We use a Play: 1 in the kitchen as a replacement for an HD radio where it's small size is a big plus, and the fact that it doesn't fill a big room is irrelevant.   The Play: 5 is much, much nicer than the Play: 1, and can be used pretty much anywhere you need a decent sound. The unit I couldn't find a real place for was the Play: 3. It does have better sound than the Play: 1, but not by lots and lots and the price point is awkward."
sonos,2foqsu,xot,1 point,Sun Sep 7 17:04:48 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I have play:1's in my bathroom and office to give me fill through my apartment, and they also make a good little stereo pair in a small space or at low volume. No substitute for a Play:5 or a Connect:Amp with decent bookshelf speakers, though."
sonos,2foqsu,ShibbyChongo,1 point,Sun Sep 7 20:11:17 2014 UTC,Yeah I started with a Play 1 for my bedroom because I live in an apartment and it easily fills the room with quality sound.   Looking to get the 5.1 Playbar setup but I'm just being cheap because it's a ton of money.
sonos,2foqsu,AMidgetAndAClub,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:27:02 2015 UTC,That does make sense. It would probably work well as a rear speaker but individually it isn't very good (quite unlike what I had expected).  How does Play:3 compare with the Play:5?
sonos,2foqsu,ChrisTheRazer,3,Sun Sep 7 05:30:35 2014 UTC,"To me...   Play:1 - Like computer speakers or rear fill surround speakers. No low end reproduction. The mids and highs are great. A pair should be coupled with a sub. Play:3 - Like a good bookshelf speaker. Covers some of the mid bass range. Say roughly 100hz up. But if you prefer the full spectrum with your music like me it will feel dull. But if you're cool without the lower end reproduction you will be fine. Should also be coupled with a sub but could get away without it. Play:5 - I thought this was equal to Bose's ""waveguide"" radio. Very good lower end to pull the music down. Still not earth shattering bass, but the full musical spectrum is covered except the sub bass range.    Nothing will replace having a stand alone sub woofer."
sonos,2foqsu,Twymx,2,Sun Sep 7 12:57:31 2014 UTC,"Have you used a Play 1 at your home? I find they produce a surprising amount of bass. Not mega deep, but amazing for the box size."
sonos,2foqsu,YM_Industries,0,Sun Sep 7 19:32:16 2014 UTC,I find it depends on the room they are in and the surface they are on. I think they sound amazing in the bathrooms. I have two in stereo pair on my fireplace and they sound amazing.
sonos,2foqsu,Rimbodie,2,Sun Sep 7 22:56:53 2014 UTC,"Hi, I have 2 Play:3s and a Play:5. The Play:5 has noticeably better bass reproduction as well as crisper sounding audio at high volumes. The Play:3 is a fantastic speaker if you have a medium room and don't need huge amounts of bass.  For casual listening around the house the Play:3 is fine, but if you want to have a party or something you should probably get the Play:5.  EDIT: I don't own a Play:1, but I've heard them in stores and they sound awful. Rest assured that the quality of the higher end Sonos speakers blows the Play:1 out of the water.  The Connect is also really good if you have an existing audio system. If surround sound is a huge goal for you, it might be worth buying a mid-range surround sound system and then just using a Connect, or buying speakers and using a Connect:Amp."
sonos,2foqsu,YM_Industries,2,Sun Sep 7 07:22:57 2014 UTC,"Also note that the play:1 you listened to was placed in a fairly large room, and they aren't really build for that. My play 5 sounds way better in my bedroom than in my living room, which is significantly larger."

The demo switches between ""all zones"" and selected zones for comparison which let's you compare individual performance of each speaker."

sonos,2f5cz5,shayonpal,2,Mon Sep 1 08:57:31 2014 UTC,In a word; cost. I already have a Sonos connect so I don't really require a play bar. I'm in aus so the play bar goes for $950.

You cant just add details in to the form to get beats to work, that soundcloud implementation worked because the dev was running a parsing service that essentially translated the soundcloud api into something that sonos could handle.  I don't know much else about the beats service, perhaps there's a way to gain access to it by registering your sonos in the US?"
sonos,2epwcn,garywoo,2,Wed Aug 27 13:22:49 2014 UTC,"Another idea might be to buy a router with vpn built in, so your entire home network is vpn'd to think it's in the US.

sonos,2epwcn,lakeweed,1 point,Wed Aug 27 14:26:17 2014 UTC,"You're right, partially. Beats checks your IP when you log in via a new web browser, and when you first log in to a Beats app. I used a VPN to log in to the Beats app and now I'm logged in and subbed, no VPN required.

Since the beta software allows for sonos to work without a bridge there are some places where the wifi network would need a 'boost'. Purely speculation though. I'm interested what a base would be though.

With the codes you can order Sonos online for a max amount of 1500€ per code and you only pay the half price.

I gotta say that selling Sonos really is the most fun thing to sell at work. It is a safe, easy and great working system and basically all i need to do is telling them ""Yes you can controll everything with your phone, there is only 1 wire if you have a bridge and this is what it sounds"" and they buy it.

But Sonos has been doing it for years, has proven their quality, has large PE money backing them, recently updated their app, and most importantly won't put your system at risk of being obsolete because they continue to support all the speakers they sold years ago."

sonos,2e50ic,Brewshound,1 point,Fri Aug 22 02:30:32 2014 UTC,"The only way I'd consider this would be if it was significantly cheaper than Sonos, and open enough that I felt it would stay alive once LG drops it.  Odds of either of those happening?  Probably 100:1."
sonos,2e3ckb,trevorburbank,2,Wed Aug 20 16:20:10 2014 UTC,"There's a best way to do this, but it's still not great.  If you use the apple TV, it has a separate optical out that you could plug into the playbar. Then you could run a loonnng HDMI from the front of the room where the playbar is to the projector. That's probably the most straightforward way.   To use a chromecast instead you'd have to get something to split the audio signal out, like this. Kinda kills the cost effectiveness of the chromecast vs the appletv.  The other issue is you'd NEED to use a playbar if you're interested in hearing the audio from the appletv in sonos - the playbar has a low-latency input that the play:5 connect and connect:amp just don't have."
sonos,2e3ckb,nickdanger3d,1 point,Wed Aug 20 18:15:09 2014 UTC,"This may be a silly question, but if I plug audio into the playbar without ethernet cable, but with a bridge, will I be able to send that music across to other speakers?

It might seem like a strange suggestion, but is it worth putting an Xbox One in-between? You'd connect the Projector to the Xbox HDMI out, the Apple TV or Chromecast to the Xbox HDMI in, and Sonos to the Optical out  on the Xbox. Then you'd get the added bonus of Web Browser, Skype, Media.. and of course games!"

sonos,2dsvjf,Brewshound,2,Mon Aug 25 14:41:39 2014 UTC,"Skip the Play:3. I have a handful of 1, 3, and 5's, and the Play:1 and Play:3 are nearly identical in sound. The Play:3 may have slightly more bass but the considerably lower price and smaller footprint of the unit more than make up for it.  You can pick up Play:1's for ~$150 on eBay or go to your local Best Buy and check the clearance/open box area - apparently people buy the Play:1 thinking it works with Bluetooth, then return it and they often pop up for cheap as open box items.  Or - don't bother with the Play:3 and bridge at all, and instead just get a Play:5. It has enough sound and power to fill your entire apartment many times over, so you can stick it in the corner near the router without issues (and just hardwire it, as opposed to using a bridge)"
sonos,2dkeu0,spyroboss,2,Thu Aug 14 19:15:56 2014 UTC,"The subwoofer is wireless and doesn't appear to have any line-in connections. A quick search of the forums suggests it will not pair with a Connect, so you'd need to check the website/support it determine which devices it can be paired with, and whether you can connect a regular sub to the Connect. Perhaps give sons a call to discuss it.   If you want to keep your JBL's I'd recommend a Connect for them, otherwise sell them to fund a second Play:5. If you like the sound/setup of your JBL's, then get a connect and keep them. Sonos has the concept of Rooms and Groups. You can group all of your devices together and they'll play in sync, or you can split them out and play different things on each group (of one or more components). It only takes a couple if clicks each time, and its pretty seamless. You don't have to remove a device from a group to silence it, just mute it via the app. I really like being able to walk around the house and have balanced volume all the way through, so personally, I think its worth it.  Creating a stereo pair out of your Play:5's is a little more detailed  (though I haven't actually tried) so not something you'd want to do and undo every day, but fine if you want to put both your play:5's in the living room for a party and then move one back out afterward."
sonos,2dkeu0,xot,1 point,Thu Aug 14 20:11:11 2014 UTC,"That makes sense, I dont think giving up my JBLs is a good idea, because a second play 5 will not match the sound quality of the active monitors, so I opted to buy a Connect and maybe a subwoofer later on."
sonos,2dkeu0,nickdanger3d,1 point,Fri Aug 15 11:40:46 2014 UTC,"You can't use the sub with a connect. The stated reason is that they don't know how loud the system you pair it with will be.  But you can pair the sub with the play:5, and if they're grouped together it will all work great."

sonos,2d9vfo,nickdanger3d,2,Tue Aug 12 13:47:43 2014 UTC,"The connect just outputs line-level audio (like when you hook up a super nintendo/n64/gamecube to a tv, the tv being the amp in this analogy) so the app can't control it.  In your car example, the sonos would be an ipod plugged in to the aux input jack. You change the volume on the radio it plugs into, not the ipod.

If you set it up as prescribed, optical audio out from your TV, chances are extremely likely you'll only ever get 2.0 stereo. If you only have one source you're ever going to use, like a ps3/4, you could probably cable straight from the player to the soundbar and avoid issues that way, but then any time you want to switch to your wii or laptop or any other devices you're back to normal tv audio or you're switching cables.  yes, sonos is technically capable of working the way it's designed to, but you have almost 0% chance that your TV is capable of working the way sonos wants it to.

You have the right idea that each Sonos network needs to have its own wired component.   The problem is that although the Sonos systems could be happy, spanning tree won't. STP requires 1 root bridge, even if there are multiple Sonos systems. If the components can't decide because the routers won't pass the STP packets properly, you'll have problems.  If these are truly routers, and not switches, then you could daisy chain them so that it went like: Modem===Wan Of router 1-----sw port 1====wan of router 2---- swport 1====router 3.

Since I'm placing the speakers in a fairly small room, and since I rarely watch TV anymore, going for stereo might be the smartest move right now.  Here's to hoping Sonos will one day come up with a way to integrate a third play 5, or an entirely new speaker, to upgrade the set to 3,1. But from what I've heard, that will likely never happen.   Edit: something like a Play:7 that would function as a centre speaker would be the best thing ever."

Highly recommended to just use their support system.

I've had similar problems streaming Spotify when on a bad internet connection, or streaming from a bad source. It would be nice to have an option to control this somehow (either enabling infinite retry, or adjust buffering) so perhaps contact their support, and/or post something on their feature requests portal.  My suggestion for right now would be to download the podcasts to your music library or your phone (you can use PocketCasts if you have Android) and play the downloaded copy locally."

He called Sonos support they ran wire shark and noticed one of the Play 5's kept dropping due to interference which was causing his systems to lose connection to the internet. It ended up being a bad power surge protector he had his play 5 plugged into call support and they'll narrow it down for you.
sonos,2cblex,ualip,1 point,Fri Aug 1 09:17:29 2014 UTC,Or you could buy a Play 5 and plug into the line-in of that. Gives you an extra speaker and would probably cost less than the converter / switcher route.
sonos,2cblex,doodlelogic,1 point,Fri Aug 1 11:53:04 2014 UTC,"I thought about your solution as well, what did you end up doing? The ADC and optical splitter can both be quite cheap, like 10% of a play:5, so definitely worth considering.  Of cause some signal loss is to be expected, especially with a cheap ADC."
sonos,2cblex,aheilemann,0,Mon Jan 12 10:20:52 2015 UTC,"You definitely need the phono preamp to get a line level input. Have you considered something like just the Connect? It has RCA in like the Connect:AMP but is $150 less. That'd probably be the best solution, or as /u/doodlelogic suggested get a Play:5. If you went that route, you'd have basically the Connect with a really good speaker attached for only $50 more than the Connect. I would avoid getting the Connect:AMP unless you plan to use the AMP part of it."
sonos,2bs1eb,Smadja,2,Sat Jul 26 13:49:37 2014 UTC,Set it all up in a location where you have a router and internet access .  Then move it to the Dorm  It would be helpful if you had a router and created a little network even if it can not access the internet.
sonos,2bs1eb,lost_adonis,1 point,Sat Jul 26 17:20:05 2014 UTC,Sonos retail expert here. This might work yes. But if he disconnects them then there is a chance that the settings get reseted. I recommend to use a router or bridge but as in this case this might not work. He can give it a shot tho.
sonos,2bs1eb,milanbourbeck,1 point,Sat Aug 9 17:01:28 2014 UTC,As long as you don't FR the devices they will remember their HHID and remember who they are bonded to. It should be fine. If you press buttons on power up or otherwise FR the devices then they can become un-bonded.
sonos,2bs1eb,lost_adonis,-1,Sun Aug 10 16:12:06 2014 UTC,I don't think the sub can connect to a five. It needs the playbar or a connect amp to connect to. You might want to check with Sonos.   Edit: added the word amp

You just have to first setup the network at a play that does have a connection. It worked out fantastically! Perhaps this may be an option for you?

sonos,2borxb,tdmoreno,1 point,Fri Jul 25 13:50:40 2014 UTC,I would hold off on the bridge. You can currently connect a play 1 directly to your router. I know this might not be ideal but sonos is currently beta testing direct connection to the wifi network that would not require a bridge. The bridge is rumored to be suggested for use in areas where wifi is very poor due to saturation and also in huge homes.
sonos,2bcybp,Marobrown,6,Tue Jul 22 02:57:11 2014 UTC,"I'll try and help.  All Sonos needs is one device, either a speaker or bridge, plugged in via ethernet to your router. I have my bridge plugged into my router. I think they're fixing the need for this in a future release.  If you move a speaker around, you don't have to reconnect it every time. It'll detect the Sonos network and off it goes.  No you don't need a computer. You get the Sonos app on your phone/ipad and then it'll stream music from that onto your Sonos speakers."

sonos,2bam39,Rimbodie,3,Mon Jul 21 13:49:35 2014 UTC,"Hi Rimbodie,  To answer your question, the Play:5's were designed before the Playbar came onto the scene as a Sonos unit and never had a 5Ghz transmitter placed in them. When the Playbar came out, it was designed to pair with the Play:1 and Play:3's built-in 5Ghz transmitters which were added during their design, and as such, the Playbar will only pair with the 1's and 3's for a surround sound system.   As a side note, you can use 2x Play:1's or Play:3's as rear speakers, but they will only produce the audio stream of what is sent to them via the Playbar during surround mode, but at full volume when playing music. But, as many people are curious about, the Playbar has built-in 9 individual speakers, grouped in 3's so as to be a Left, Center and Right channel producing unit."

sonos,2as5kz,Unbathed,2,Tue Jul 15 19:46:36 2014 UTC,"there's something called Plex   How does Plex send music to a speaker?    putting a freaking aux-in on PLAY:1 and PLAY:3   It would be nice to have.   Please note that on SONOS, an aux-in is a first-class network capable source, not just a freaking aux-in. A PLAY:1 in the kitchen can play audio from a device attached to the PLAY:5 aux-in, while the PLAY:5 is playing music from Beats."
sonos,2as5kz,Unbathed,1 point,Tue Jul 15 19:50:36 2014 UTC,"Plex is a media server. You can use practically a dozen different wifi speaker receivers, or go cheap with Bluetooth for mediocre audio."
sonos,2as5kz,Unbathed,1 point,Thu Jul 17 17:29:15 2014 UTC,"From my reading of the Support section of the Plex website, Plex requires a server in addition to the speakers. Is that correct?"
sonos,2as5kz,Unbathed,1 point,Thu Jul 17 19:31:10 2014 UTC,"The Plex server is a service that runs in the background. It can be installed on Windows 7/8 and probably most Windows Server releases, as well as Mac OS X."
sonos,2as5kz,Jhix,1 point,Fri Jul 18 14:14:31 2014 UTC,"The Plex website lists system requirements for the machine which will run the service:    Check the Getting Started section for the base requirements. If you intend the HTPC to run more applications than the Server and Plex Home Theater, you should take that into account if you're building or purchasing new equipment. Source   Does the current version of Plex allow different music to play in different rooms? SONOS solves this architecturally by making every device a server with a WiFi and Ethernet stack, including 802.1 (Spanning Tree Protocol) for least-cost routing. I think something like that can be done with Plex if the user hooks up each speaker to a Raspberry PI. Apple solves it architecturally by limiting AirPlay to exactly one stream at a time: the same music in multiple rooms, but not different music in different rooms."
sonos,2as5kz,CerebroJD,1 point,Fri Jul 18 15:34:45 2014 UTC,"Plex can have as many people as wanted connected to to it.   The idea behind my thinking is as follows:  Plex Server: Serves up media via a Service Application Handset: Plays media from Plex Server Handset: Has setting/application to choose speakers as ""audio out"".  If Sonos was just a wifi speakers selector on the handset, it'd be brilliant."
sonos,2as5kz,brakingitdown,2,Fri Jul 18 17:23:11 2014 UTC,"Can a single Plex server play different things in different rooms at the same time?   Here is a screenshot of SONOS playing Kaiser Chiefs in the kitchen and living room (synchronized) and Beck on the patio:  Imgur  I have not been able to find the equivalent in Plex.  There is no equivalent in AirPlay, because AirPlay (as of today) is a single stream to one-or-more speakers."

sonos,29urhw,jensm,4,Fri Jul 4 21:03:12 2014 UTC,"I think you're asking if it would be possible to take a copy of a Sonos image (either from the device, or one of the updates) and run that on a Raspberry Pi - right?   In theory, its possible to grab and extract one of their standard images from an update server. We know the devices run linux and utilise various open source apps but its a hell of a lot more work than just obtaining the image, and at that point you're still going to need a better bit of hardware than a Pi to get decent audio quality from it.  Hypothetically, yes, you could reverse engineer their platform to build something compatible (or maybe get their OS running on your own hardware - though thats not so likely).  Realistically, no. Releasing anything compatible would get you in a lot of legal trouble, meaning you'd have to do it alone (or in a super-secret group) and you'd have to redo it every update, and every hardware change - and you'd only be creating a poor quality version of the Connect, which is the last place you want poor quality given its use case. Do the math, and you'll likely conclude you're better off either working extra hours to buy the real deal, or using one of the open source alternatives."

The wattage (Ah) supplied by the battery-pack should  be able to power it way more than 20s, totally depending on the volume.   What impresses me is that he seems to be able to use just 5 volt.

sonos,29mcl1,garywoo,1 point,Wed Jul 2 15:16:20 2014 UTC,"I can't see why it couldn't be using 5V internally, I would have assumed that 12 would have been more likely, but you never know.  What I'm surprised about is that it can run off the likely 2.1A that is about the maximum these USB battery packs will handle.  It's possible that it isn't enough current and loud bass or higher volume will cause drop-outs, I didn't have headphones so could only watch the video without sound so I can't judge how loud it was being played.  Judging by the size I'd say that's a 10Ah battery pack, if it's got the usual 3.7V LiIon in it, losing something for inefficiency of the 3.7->5V converter let's say you'll get 30Wh out of it.  The max ~10W output is then only ~1/3C which shouldn't present an issue, can't see why you wouldn't get at least 2 and possibly closer to 3 hours out of it.  Whether or not this kind of back-of-an-envelope math is at all applicable in the real world is an entirely different matter.  Really what we need is for Sonos to just make a Play1 with a battery.  I like the idea of the humidity-proofing for music in the bathroom but my bathroom is lacking in power outlets.  That or something to use while gardening or similar outdoor activities within wifi range of the house.  Thinking of such a battery as a clip-on base with roughly the footprint of the Play1 itself, I can't see why you'd not be able to get six to eight ""18650"" size LiIon cells (~55-75Wh) which should be more than enough play time for all of the uses I can think of for such a device.  Give it a charging stand you can just drop it onto rather than having to plug anything in so it's a grab-and-go device, it'd be great."

I've written small scripts to control the app. You can then use event scripts mobile to trigger the script. This is all Mac based of course.  I use airfoil speakers + nicecast to create a local stream so I can airplay to sonos without going through a analog step. So I suppose you could use any web streaming software with a mic as your makeshift PA.

I use a sonos bridge connected to my router. That creates the sonos network which your playbar and play 1's connect to.

sonos,27s3zd,ScurvyDawg,1 point,Wed Jun 11 06:11:34 2014 UTC,"Hey Lusen,   The guys at Soundlab here. We've got a few different solutions for you, but here's the most basic one, and one we find a ton of retailers at the moment forget to mention.   With ANY Sonos system setup, you need a bridge. This is the be all and end all of all Sonos systems. While yes, you can hard wire units into the network, you will never get the ease of setup that comes with a Bridge.  That only needs to be hard wired to the WiFi Access Point, such as the router, and once that's done, every other Sonos unit, from the Play:1 to the Playbar becomes truly wireless.   At that point, the Playbar and any other units you get will only need power, and in the case of the Playbar, an optical connection to the TV.  The other solutions range down to connecting one of the devices hard wired, but that can still lead to issues in the long run regarding solid and stable WiFi connections, and if at all possible we'd suggest against it.   Check us out online, as we've currently got the Bridge amazingly cheap, and can ship that globally if needed - want to make sure you can get the most of your system!   If there's any other questions we can answer, send us an email, or get in touch on here - will get back to you ASAP - Cheers Mate!"

sonos,278yzc,DJRQuick360,4,Wed Jun 4 00:10:29 2014 UTC,"Hi DJR,  Adam from Soundlab here. Know the guys here have given you the answer, but just wanted to explain why...  Firstly, the Play:5 is reasonably old in it's hardware compared to the internals on the Play:1 and Play:3 - to this end, the 5 doesnt have a 5Ghz wireless transmitter built in, which is required for the seamless rear audio transmission.  Also, as the Play:5 contains a line in, it's only able to take in a stereo signal, produced in mono through a single, or stereo pair if the Play:5 is connected with another speaker.  The only solution i could imagine, would be connecting a direct audio out of the TV into the Play:5 as a mono, group this with two play:3's side mounted, but if you grouped this with the Play:1's as rear, you would only be able to get the same audio output as the stereo front, albeit with a significant lag as the output is coming from an analog source.  Hope this helps explain a little more, but again, this is purely why the Playbar was created :D  Cheers, and if you've got any further questions, please flick us an email!"
sonos,278yzc,SonosSoundlab,1 point,Sat Jun 7 04:42:09 2014 UTC,"You're saying that the play:5 is quite an old unit in Sonos catalog. Is it still worth the money, or is waiting a wiser alternative?"
sonos,278yzc,Krusty_B,1 point,Wed Jun 11 18:13:09 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say that the unit is old as far as the Sonos catalog goes, as we have far older units still being used still today, such as the Connect:AMP being a modern iteration of what were once the ZP units.   However, i reference the unit as ""old"" in the sense that it doesn't include the 5GHz transmitter enabling it as a rear 5.1 speaker pair, which can be achieved through the Play:1 or Play:3.   Regardless, they're definitely worth the money as the response out of the Play:5 compared to a Play:1 or 3's is massively different. Each unit we have currently has it's place in our range, with the Play:5 supplanting 5.1 support to be the only speaker within the Sonos range to include a Line-In input. As such, it fits perfectly for the capabilities, however it is purely that the Play:5 hasn't been given the adaption to work as rear 5.1 surround speakers."
sonos,278yzc,SonosSoundlab,1 point,Thu Jun 12 04:20:02 2014 UTC,It would work but all the units would have the same output. Currently the only surround option is to pair a play bar (combined the centre unit and the front left and rights) with two rear speakers (either play1s or play3s). Whilst this system does not always give true surround sound it comes close.

sonos,278yzc,wimpitron,1 point,Wed Jun 4 14:31:33 2014 UTC,"Also considering that the Play:5 only has a headphone jack in (vs the Optical input of a Playbar) it wouldn't be able to handle a 5.1 signal. As someone who uses the full setup of Playbar + Sub + 2x Play:1s, it's fantastic, but quite expensive (though it's on par with many quality surround setups). No receiver needed, your TV just needs Optical out (which most HDTVs have)"

sonos,26s97c,vrkr,2,Thu May 29 13:32:22 2014 UTC,"Hey guys!  I work at Soundlab in Perth, Australia - we're a dedicated Sonos retailer for Oz. This is going to be huge for us, as it has a few benefits that most people with Sonos units have yet to discover.   Firstly, Sonos and Google decided to partner up in a sense, to offer the services that Google Play can give to Sonos users, namely, access to a premium music streaming service, straight off the bat. This, for many new Sonos users is a huge benefit, and a great way to get them into the music streaming scene. the other benefit of this, is giving them the capability to access music that is often behind a pay-wall, or simply not offered by the free services that Sonos can access.  Secondly, the other major point is that through the Google Play App itself, users will be able to play direct to Sonos systems. This eliminates or provides an alternative way to connect with a Sonos system without using the Sonos App if that's how they wish to connect, or prefer to play their music purely from that source.   With these two benefits in mind, Google, and their Play Music service have seen and recognized what Sonos as a music system can offer, and  decided to run with it.  So, to that end, while there are many other free services that Sonos can use, as we're not dedicated to one service or another, the 6 month free subscription gives new users that boost, to see what the paid services can offer.   Cheers guys!  Edit: Grammar"

I would love to see a comparison of each of the Sonos offered platforms and what their niche is, aka why should I choose that one to pay for."
sonos,26s97c,ctjwa,1 point,Thu May 29 23:46:44 2014 UTC,"Well Sonos can't be in the business of recommending one service over another. I'm sure you could find comparisons online somewhere. Songza is just a radio type service that has playlists made by them. Google Play is sort of like Amazon Cloud Player where you can upload all your own music to them and store them there and play from there, as well as use their On Demand (search for a song and play it even if you don't own it) as well as a radio-like feature. Spotify is similar, but doesn't have the cloud player feature where you can upload your songs to them and play on your Sonos. Just on demand. Try out the free trials from some music services and see what you think. I started off using MOG because when I'm at work I like using the desktop player. But with MOG going away and Beats not having a desktop app, I switched to Spotify, but might switch to Google Play. Haven't tried it yet."

I don't have any real need for cloud music, everything I have downloaded and would want to listen to is on my iPhone and capacity isn't a problem.    The benefit of Spotify to me is that I can search for almost anything, but even better I can follow my cooler friend's playlist, since he keeps up with new music more than I can."

I have a Borderlinx account so that's all good, but the catch is I have to pay VAT!   So far I'm saving about A$140 (US$130, UKP77) on a Playbar, but that is before Borderlinx ships it to Australia so I'm probably not saving anything in the long run!"

sonos,25nul2,brophyd,4,Thu May 15 21:57:09 2014 UTC,"ZP100 is a much older model that was replaced by the ZP120 then Connect Amp.   The ZP100 is larger, and slightly lower wattage than the ZP120/connect amp (50w v 55w). The ZP100 also had a line in/out, where the ZP120/amp only have line in. ZP100 had 4 Ethernet ports, 120/amp has 2 ports. ZP120/AMP also have sonos net 2.0 connectivity.   I think that's pretty much it.   Edit - I have two ZP100's and they are great. I had to have one repaired, would continually shut down after warming up. Otherwise, I have had no problems with them. I have no problems with them dropping off the network or anything like that."

sonos,25hzwh,ChrisTheRazer,1 point,Wed May 14 06:29:53 2014 UTC,"Hmm that does make sense now that I know the bit about the Sonos system acting as a hub. It seems like an interesting design decision on their part since the devices should in theory only need to act as endpoints rather than a bridge. I wonder how recently they implemented that, as now that I think back the issue only cropped up after I did an update on the Sonos system, the one immediately prior to the rollout of the new UI.   In any event it could open up some interesting use cases such as using the system to provide connectivity to areas of the house that aren't adequately covered by the standard wifi network in the house. Of course, the cost of the sonos system vis a vis a home router might preclude someone from choosing to do this instead of going the traditional route but I can think of a few situations where such a solution would be viable."
sonos,25hzwh,SonosSoundlab,1 point,Thu May 15 00:08:53 2014 UTC,"Just be aware that as Sonosnet is designed for distance and robustness, rather than speed, you won't get the same speed as wifi. I tried it for connecting my TV, but Sonosnet couldn't provide enough speed for HD on Netflix."
sonos,25hzwh,ChrisTheRazer,1 point,Thu May 15 06:28:20 2014 UTC,"Hey Lifes, I work at Soundlab in Perth, Australia - we're a dedicated Sonos retailer in Australia.  Have an update for you regarding this issue, as it's one a ton of our users have experienced, and one that anyone with any networking or IT background will confirm. This is knowledge that was imparted to us by CEDIA, a home theatre and networking organization.  Essentially, with every device that you plug into a network that propagates Wi-Fi, a reduction in HALF of the network's speed will occur, even if signal strength remains the same, so as to account for the lowest common denominator of hardware with access.  As such, you will be able to connect to a network with the Wi-Fi being produced at the same strength; however the speed will continually be reduced by half with each additional connection hard wired in.  To this end, we recommend that all devices, including the Play:5 be removed from being hard wired, and utilize the Sonos Bridge to connect to the network.  Hope this at least provides a bit of an understanding regarding the issue….  As for a solution – the best thing we recommend is for all of the Sonos devices to be left wireless, and to grab a Sonos Bridge, and hard wire that to the home router. Will make everything nice and smooth again.  Let us know how you go!"

sonos,25eilx,IgnoreAmos,3,Mon May 12 23:26:47 2014 UTC,"I would have liked to have seen the figures before we got our 2x Play1s, but Sonos don't publish them. I think this may be something to do with the fact that they have an active crossover which means you can't really compare RMS figures with normal systems.   To help give you an idea though, they are impressively loud for such small boxes. We rarely have ours over 1/4 from day to day, and 1/2 to 3/4 is plenty loud enough for a party, eg can't hear people talk. And most importantly, there is no distortion."
sonos,25eilx,ChrisTheRazer,1 point,Tue May 13 06:28:01 2014 UTC,Thanks for sharing your impressions.
sonos,25eilx,US_Hiker,0,Tue May 13 07:15:10 2014 UTC,"Specs - yeah, unpublished.  The reality is that they are louder than the 50W set of speakers I've been using.  They are very crisp, and the bass response is quite shocking from speakers of this simply miniscule size.  The only real shortcoming that I've found is when listening to somebody like Isaac Freeman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUtHe2agREs).  The lack of resonance chamber, I presume, is what makes it a bit flat.  When they were new, they couldn't handle what I'd call ""open"" bass as well as I'd like.  The second song from Einsturzende Neubauten, here, was likewise flat.  After about a week or two though, as the cones ""wore in"" a bit, the reponse feels like it has improved to match what I'm used to it sounding like.  Overall though, I'm very impressed with these.  The engineering is quite good.  I may pick up a Dock so that they can fully replace speakers from my computer."

sonos,24zslu,Tildah,6,Wed May 7 23:05:35 2014 UTC,I think it depends on how many zones you ultimately want to have.   I would take one play5 over two play1's in the same room for music purposes.
sonos,24zslu,ctjwa,3,Wed May 7 23:22:52 2014 UTC,"There is no best option. Just opinions, and they depend on finance, your house, audio expectations etc. It depends on what you dream the end system will look like in say 1 year, 2 years & 3 years. How much you want to spend now, compared to later. How you handle if in year 2 or 3 when there is a Play 2 or Play 7 that turns out to better, than the speakers you filled your house with.  Personally I bought 2 Play1s, bedroom and kitchen/living, they are nearly constantly on. It was the cheapest step into the Sonos world, and if expand the system (which I now think I will), they will still be used, with the flexibility as two zones or as a pair (they sound great to me as a pair, and obviously have great stereo separation compared to single box speaker)  You obviously need to get out of your 1 speaker 1 zone setup, as you are missing most of what a Sonos system is. A bit like a unicycle compared to a bicycle."
sonos,24zslu,brakingitdown,3,Thu May 8 07:41:59 2014 UTC,"Excuse the awkward phrasing here, but you really don't want to separate a stereo pair between rooms at all. You'll hear one channel much louder than the other at all times. Bad times on boats.  I grabbed 2xPlay:5s and a Play:1. I keep the Play:1 in the bedroom. It is awesome. And portable. Great for long showers. Haha  The Play:5s are much more well-rounded in terms of sound reproduction. If you're interested in fidelity, grab one. Though the Play:1s are nothing to scoff at. I personally love how big the little guy actually sounds.  I do not, however, have experience with the PlayBar. I have read that it doesn't do DTS, though. Not sure how important that is to you.  Hope this helps."
sonos,24zslu,Glyphic,2,Thu May 8 14:13:26 2014 UTC,I ended up going for 1xPlay 5 for my own room... I think I may have made a mistake as it sounds too compact by itself. (Room is about 350sqft). maybe 2x Play 1s or Play 3's in stereo are the better option.  Ultimately my recommendation would be to try the other options instead of getting the 5 unless you're willing to get 2 for a larger area (multiple rooms for you).  2x Play 3's are only a bit above the price of a 5 though so maybe that's one of the better options.   One thing to note: The play 5 has a Line-In 3.5mm jack which the play 1 does not. I'm not sure if the play 3 has it.
sonos,24zslu,darkpyro101,1 point,Thu May 8 17:18:59 2014 UTC,Thanks! I ruled out the play 3 because I didn't there was a huge difference between it and the Play1 in terms of sound. And the play1 has an active woofer (apparently the 3 doesnt?)  I cant afford much more than a play5 at the moment. I could stretch to 2x Play1 or a playbar but I'd have to justify it.   Would 2x Play1s playing the same thing in both rooms (there's an open arch between them) be better than 1play5 playing for both rooms?
sonos,24zslu,darkpyro101,1 point,Thu May 8 18:49:29 2014 UTC,"I would say so. Throughout my parents' house, they have embedded speakers in the ceilings with sonos amps powering them. They sound better in pairs for sure instead of 1 source.   To my ears, one play 5, even though it has multiple speakers in it, just isnt enough sound to fill a medium-large room properly. It sounds very 1 directional.  One other thing to note as well, the Play 1s are water resistant and can be placed in washrooms and humid areas too."

As an aside, try not to factory reset any devices unless you're absolutely certain you need to in future - it means you'll lose data like playlists, and for troubleshooting purposes rebooting a unit serves the same purpose most of the time."

sonos,246z6a,Glyphic,3,Mon Apr 28 15:43:44 2014 UTC,The power cable sticks out on purpose - it's to prevent you from placing the unit directly in front of the wall where it won't get any airflow.

sonos,246z6a,Aypse,2,Tue Apr 29 21:54:21 2014 UTC,"I have two play 5s mounted with those high on a wall.  I mounted them near corners, about 18 inches below the ceiling, and then I used zip-ties to neaten up the excess power cords.  They mount pretty flush and the power cords are hidden by the speaker itself.  Looks good I think.  Edit to add:  At first I was pretty nervous that those mount don't attach to the speak itself in any manner.  I thought that maybe the speaker would vibrate itself off.  It doesn't.  Even after regular use over the last 45 days, they haven't moved at all."

sonos,2410at,TeamOggy,4,Sat Apr 26 13:00:34 2014 UTC,"Hey TeamOggy,  I work at Soundlab in Perth, Australia - we're a dedicated Sonos retailer for Oz.  We've experienced tons of this over the years, and have a few simple steps that can often clean this right up.   Firstly, our biggest suggestion is to bring in a laptop or PC to the wireless network, download the Sonos App, and move all the wireless devices to Channel 11 - most home wireless networks operate on Channel 6, and can often cause some interference between devices. This essentially moves the frequency rotation of the Sonos units to a completely different channel, and works 90% of the time for us and our customers.  Second option you can try, is a new router. This is a worst case scenario, as it will require an additional purchase, but Netgear or TP-Link routers are specifically designed to operate on a frequency that Sonos doesn't use on any of it's channels. They weren't purposely designed for this, but through testing we've found these brands to be the best for stopping any wireless network interference.   Lastly, as with any additional component on a sonos network, make sure that they aren't hard-wired into a network. Start your system with everything apart from the Bridge connected to the router by CAT-5, and do a hard reset, adding each component separately and one at a time. As the Playbar has the same tech as the Bridge in-built, sometimes the networks can get confused as to which unit to talk to as a hub.   Hope this helps mate, and please feel free to get in touch with us if you have any more issues - always glad to help :D"
sonos,2410at,SonosSoundlab,2,Mon Apr 28 06:23:32 2014 UTC,"Just want to chime in and say that you can also try to configure your own router, before going as far as purchasing a new one. A lot of routers are set to operate with Automatic channel selection. You should make sure to set the routers channel to manual 1 or 6 in the above example. The main point is to separate your routers channel from your Sonos systems channel.  Why channels 1, 6 and 11 you might think, have a look here for a great explanation."
sonos,2410at,Merius,1 point,Tue Apr 29 10:58:26 2014 UTC,"It's hard to say, but at least if you turn those all into the 5.1 config, I think they are running IMF on 5GHz.  On my setup, I check from time to time for the least congested 2.4 channel and things seem fine."
sonos,2410at,kaszkasz,1 point,Sat Apr 26 14:45:14 2014 UTC,"I have two Play:5s, one Play:1, and a Connect. I live in a townhouse community, which I imagine has more wireless networks than a standard detached home but less than an apartment. I have had significant interference issues ever since I added the second Play:5 (which was before we got the Play:1). Frequently, the units will drop out one at a time or all at once. It's gotten better for no explainable reason, but generally it's really bad between 5-10pm on week nights. I've always wondered if my neighbor's baby monitor is to blame, because the timing of the baby seems to coincide with the time when problems began. The Sonos tech support, while friendly, has been unable to resolve the problem."

sonos,23sssw,completeturnaround,2,Thu Apr 24 05:00:55 2014 UTC,Has anyone added a pair of play 3s a rear speakers? I have a playbar and am considering getting a pair of play 3 which can double up as room speakers when not being paired in the living room
sonos,23sssw,ctjwa,2,Thu Apr 24 05:11:09 2014 UTC,"I went with play1's for the tv setup, and a separate play5 for a different room.   The reason for this is mainly because it's kind of a pain in the ass to link and delink the surround speakers from the tv when you want to play music. Of course, you can use the playbar plus the 1's all linked to play music in that room, but not with tv audio at the same time."
sonos,23sssw,simpleasitis,2,Thu Apr 24 05:22:02 2014 UTC,"I have play3s bonded with Playbar. The play1 wasn't on the market yet when I got my Sonos setup. It's awesome with movies and music. For the movie part as rear speakers they are clearly overqualified and play1s would do the job as great. When playing music I think the play3 are justified. I never unbond them as rears by the way but turn their level as surround speakers to the max. Like I said its awesome. But this ""problem"" with bonding and unbonding when switching between music and movies will be solved with the next major update anyway. It should be live in the next few weeks. Then you can toggle between ""ambient"" and ""full"" for the rears. But with Sonos Playbar and full surround sound (for movies, especially from blu-ray) be aware of the missing DTS support. I don't know if you are into this specific subject."

sonos,23e9ed,peaceshark,4,Fri Apr 18 23:10:19 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately that is not possible right now for true 5.1.  The reason currently only the 1's and 3's can act as rear speakers is that they also include the 5ghz bands, which is what the playbar uses to send out the 5.1 data, whereas the connect/amp/5 are strictly 2.4ghz bands.  You COULD set up the play 5's as a stereo pair and just group them in the same zone, but it would just be stereo, they wouldn't be acting as true rear speakers for a 5.1 signal."

sonos,23e9ed,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Tue Apr 22 22:28:40 2014 UTC,"You can add them to the same zone, and the connect will play the same thing as the playbar front channels, but I do not believe there is any way to have a connect act as ""true"" 5.1 surround rear speakers."
sonos,23e9ed,dasarp,3,Fri Jun 20 06:20:46 2014 UTC,"IMHO, there's not a strong reason for this. The main advantage of the Play5s over the Play3s or Play1s is the larger cone in the center which adds more bass.  However, Sonos expects you to add a Subwoofer for the bass, not upgrade your rear speakers. Also, bass isn't directional as it's meant to be felt more than heard - it usually doesn't matter very much where a sub is kept for example, so there's no reason to have the deeper bass be part of the directional rear speakers."

sonos,239mrq,10weight,1 point,Sat Apr 19 16:57:53 2014 UTC,Appears to be a good change.  Eliminates some of the cost of entry and some steps in the setup.
sonos,239mrq,Aypse,1 point,Thu Apr 17 17:52:42 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure I like the change though, and probably won't use it. Having one device hard wired into your network means there is no bandwidth usage of your wifi network.  This new setup will mean that music will be streamed via wifi to a hub unit then from there to other devices via the Sonos mesh network."
sonos,239mrq,calidoc,1 point,Thu Apr 17 23:39:38 2014 UTC,"There are some large homes, where all players are not in the range of the WiFi signal or challenging network environments, that will still benefit from the Sonos BRIDGE   What's interesting is it seems like without a bridge, all units will be connected through WiFi (it's not like one unit is connected to WiFi, and the rest are connected to each other through Sonos-net).   With constant music playing through a ton of speakers, I wonder if that'll affect your internet speeds due to WiFi traffic. If that's the case, I really hope they don't drop Bridge support (which it seems like they'll need for large houses anyways)."
sonos,239mrq,dasarp,1 point,Thu Apr 17 21:28:27 2014 UTC,"I highly doubt they'd drop bridge support, especially since the units themselves are bridges. The system is still operating the exact same way except instead of a hardline to the router it is now wireless."
sonos,239mrq,calidoc,1 point,Fri Apr 18 01:38:09 2014 UTC,"That's not how I read it. In fact, in this new system it seems like the entire system is operating on regular WiFi - there is no SonosNET unless one unit (such as the Bridge) is hardwired.   Note that the article mentions that they will ""maintain the core functionality of SonosNET"" (group playing), but doesn't mention that they will maintain SonosNET itself. In fact, it specifically says that in large houses, a hardwired Bridge will be useful. This would NOT be the case if SonosNET were to be maintained in the Bridge-less communication, as simply having one Sonos player in the range of the WiFi signal would be sufficient (the others could communicate via SonosNET)."
sonos,239mrq,dasarp,2,Fri Apr 18 02:12:50 2014 UTC,"That's actually just it. By connecting directly to each other as stated:   We will maintain the core function of SonosNet so that – when several players are linked together as a group – they continue to communicate directly with one another, keeping your music in perfect sync.   It is actually using SonosNet.  In order for Sonos units to communicate DIRECTLY with each other, they are required to use the SonosNet. That's the beauty of the Sonos system as it is: the lack of a central data processing point. By having each unit connect to each other directly and daisy chain information throughout the network they not only communicate faster without using network bandwidth, but also allow for a stronger network than allowed by wifi. Running the amount of information that Sonos users (especially those of us who use FLAC) use would tap out a wifi network if it can even support it. SonosNet is the only way that Sonos devices could communicate directly with each other.   A normal wifi network works between two devices by having device A talk to the router and then the router talk to device B.     SonosNet allows devices A and B to communicate directly with each other bypassing the router. This is possible because each and every Sonos unit has a BRIDGE unit inside.  They can't get rid of the SonosNet . This solution simply removes the requirement for having one unit hard lined to the router by having a ""central"" sonos unit communicating wirelessly to the network.   My worry is that this will cause the music to stream from the internet/server and actually using the network bandwidth. Which avoiding this was a major selling point of Sonos."
sonos,239mrq,calidoc,2,Fri Apr 18 02:47:00 2014 UTC,"Solid argument. I suppose what confuses me is, if they maintain SonosNET, and simply have one device communicate directly & wirelessly with the router, then why they state that houses where all players are not in range of the WiFi network will benefit from the Bridge. If what you say were true, then shouldn't you need only one player close enough to the router?"
sonos,239mrq,dasarp,3,Fri Apr 18 03:10:47 2014 UTC,"Honestly, that part confuses me. I've tried to contact a friend of mine who is one of their reps.  My guess, for what it's worth, is that they tried to eliminate the SonosNet but realized they couldn't because SonosNet range is so much better than wifi."
sonos,239mrq,calidoc,1 point,Fri Apr 18 03:15:11 2014 UTC,"Cool, keep us posted if you learn something!"
sonos,239mrq,dasarp,3,Fri Apr 18 05:11:26 2014 UTC,"In nearly all configurations, if you have a Sonos component wired to your router, SonosNet will be used. If you don't, then all Sonos components will connect over wifi directly to your router.  You could build an odd configuration where this isn't the case - if you wired one unit at the end of a very long ethernet cable (out of wifi range of the router), zones near that will use SonosNet, but zones near the router will use wifi.  I'd guess this is largely aimed at easing people into Sonos - we don't expect many people with existing wired systems to use this functionality.  (source: I work for the company)"
sonos,239mrq,crummy,1 point,Fri Apr 18 17:03:17 2014 UTC,"Oh thanks! That clarifies that up, and I agree finding a way to work without the Bridge makes a ton of sense because it severely reduces barriers to entry for people buying a WiFi audio system for the first time.  One follow-up: if all of your Sonos components are within WiFi range, is there any reason for those of us who have the bridge to still keep using it? (Perhaps such as better sound quality, faster internet/WiFi speeds around the house because the router's bandwidth won't be consumed by a bunch of speakers, etc.?)"
sonos,239mrq,dasarp,1 point,Fri Apr 18 17:38:45 2014 UTC,"SonosNet may be more reliable, especially with larger households or with weaker routers.  Edit: To answer your question, if you can easily wire a bridge or other Sonos component, there's not much reason for you to use this feature."
sonos,239mrq,crummy,1 point,Fri Apr 18 17:41:56 2014 UTC,I suspect that Sonos will suggest users adjust their QoS settings on their routers to guarantee some minimum level of bandwith devoted to the Sonos system.

The Play:1 would be our suggestion as well, especially for the kitchen, as it's technically the only Sonos unit that's also water-resistant, and can take a few random splashes and still work perfectly.  However, we'd suggest against involving the unit in a food fight...  While the Play:3 would give you a much broader listening experience in terms of having a better volume output and frequency response given the 3 speakers, we'd still say go with the Play:1 :D"

sonos,236mb0,SonosSoundlab,2,Thu Apr 24 14:19:00 2014 UTC,"Hey NathanJT,  While not branded or sold as a product that is completely waterproof, we've had a customer or two drop them into a pool or sink full of water for less than a minute, and still work fine (not powered at the time).  The most common use by our customers is mounting a pair of Play:1's outside under an awning. As we also do installations in customers houses, we've never had a pair (of Play:1's) damaged from this setup.    For example, last night here in Perth we had a reasonable amount of rain. The pair of Play:1's that we leave outside the store are mounted flush against the outside wall, next to a pair of Mariner 5"" waterproof outdoor speakers. Both of these are still working perfectly fine today.   While we don't recommend that any electrical equipment gets purposely wet, they are able to handle a reasonable amount of water, and still function. If you'd like any more specifics, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us :D"

Play 1 seems great, but in the shops the play 5 sounded utterly amazing. I wasn't so sold on the difference between a Play 1 and 3.   So I dont know if I should just get a play5 for downstairs/living/kitchen area. Or get a 2nd play 1 and make do?  As an aside, if I play the same song to two play1's, is that different to making a stero pairing and doing the same? If I have two play ones in rooms next door, will it sound better as a stereo pair or just two separate speakers?"
sonos,22s9p4,jibjibjib,3,Fri Apr 11 15:39:25 2014 UTC,"From the official support forum:  "" We hear you and understand where you’re coming from.  We also understand that our communication on this thread hasn’t been up to standard and apologize for that.    The request to change the mute button to a pause button was both long-running and popular. Many people wanted a way to quickly pause (and then resume) their music without having to open and use a controller.  At the same time, we understood that the mute functionality was used and loved by many, so it was moved to the volume minus, which now quickly mutes the player when held down.  The PLAY:1 was the first player to feature a button labeled as a pause, and we’re progressively rolling out this change to the full product line.  We don’t intend to revert the play / pause button change, nor do we intend to add an option to toggle functionality at this time.  Play / pause provides more functionality while keeping the same usability as the old mute button through holding volume minus.  That said, we understand that there are two main issues with the play / pause button that have been raised over the course of the thread:  It’s too easy to disrupt other members of the house when using play / pause and grouped players. The mute behavior from volume minus isn’t quite right.  We’re looking at ways to address both of these issues in the future and will share more information here as it becomes available."""

sonos,22qddb,calidoc,4,Fri Apr 11 03:44:58 2014 UTC,"Any Sonos device can take the role of bridge as they all basically have a bridge inside them. So, if your connect unit can be connected to the bridge, then no, you don't have to have a bridge.  The bridge is generally used because it's a low cost alternative connection to a router since most routers are hidden away in a place you may not want/need the music."
sonos,22qddb,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Fri Apr 11 05:01:01 2014 UTC,"Right on, the only downside is that it's going to be analog stereo RCA from the Onkyo to the Connect.  The only Sonos that has an Optical IN that I'm aware of is the playbar, but I'm guessing if you've got an Onkyo there you'd have no use for a playbar.  That being said, I do exactly what you're describing all the time and it's great to pipe the game all over the house via the sonos."

While you can get a Bose speaker that will beat a Play:5, it's the functionality of Sonos allowing you to create a home-wide wireless audio system that will allow it to be a step above the competition.  If you are wanting just one, then pick any. If you want to possibly add more in the future, pick Sonos hands down."
sonos,22dt22,ctjwa,1 point,Mon Apr 7 01:24:02 2014 UTC,"The fundamental difference is if you want to play music over wifi (sonos) or Bluetooth (jambox). Both have their advantages.

sonos,22dt22,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Mon Apr 7 09:11:23 2014 UTC,"If what you want is a single unit that you can ""airplay"" to, then the sonos system's networking setup will seem contrived and over complicated to you, however, if multi-room audio is something you want then it absolutely cannot be beat IMO.  In terms of reliability I can think of maybe one time in my 3 years of ownership that I hit play and it didn't play, and I'm pretty sure that was because my internet connection was down.  It is rock solid, and very simple to use."
sonos,22dt22,dasarp,1 point,Mon Apr 7 14:45:22 2014 UTC,"I listen to music on Sonos way more than I did when I had a bunch of bluetooth speakers around the house.  Two things make it so:   Ability to play from any device - I often don't play music from my laptop (in case I turn it off or my laptop is in my laptop bag), or my phone (in case a call comes and the speaker ""rings""). So I used to play it from my tablet. To play/control it with Bluetooth speakers, I'd have to hunt for my tablet. With Sonos, I can start it from whatever device happens I happen to be nearest with a couple of clicks (and later control it from another device). (As an added benefit, my girlfriend can control the music from her phone too if she needs to.) Multiple device streaming - cool to stream to your whole house at once and have the music follow you to each room. You won't get this benefit with just one speaker, but if you add more over time, this is pretty neat."

I would however appreciate a heads-up on their direction rather than radio silence.  The desktop and iOS app are OK but certainly don't feel like 'premium' software.  Sound quality is very good, however convenience is driving sales, not sound quality. For what I have spent I could have got significantly better quality. That said, the Sub is truly orgasmic (but £600...).  If I could get a Spotify app on Xbox One with integration to Sonos I'd be very happy.

sonos,1ziiv7,lost_adonis,2,Sun Mar 9 05:28:46 2014 UTC,TuneIn Radio which is available by default has most of the publicly available pod casts. You can also listen to any podcasts that you have downloaded to your library by indexing and sharing that library.
sonos,1ziiv7,srmoore4638,1 point,Fri Mar 7 23:04:00 2014 UTC,So the sonos app will play podcasts that you have downloaded to your phone via the apple podcasts app. That's how I've listened to a few.
sonos,1ziiv7,NeophileFiles,1 point,Wed Mar 5 02:30:55 2014 UTC,"Pocketcasts doesn't work. You can use the standard Apple podcasts app, but it still doesn't sync, so you have to manually find your place by checking the time on the status bar of the podcast app, then using the slider in the Sonos app to attempt to go to the same place you were in your car/headphones, which never works well because the slider is so imprecise.   It's a pain in the ass and definitely a drawback of going with sonos, in my opinion. I got the Play1 as a gift and, to be honest, I'd rather have a high quality portable speaker with a line-in. I only use speakers for three things: 1. itunes library 2. podcasts 3. music/comedy/talk shows from youtube. I can't even do 1 of those 3 things with sonos, and the other two are inconvenient because podcasts don't snyc, and itunes library doesn't update automatically or snyc playlists. The Play1 sounds and looks good, I just don't like being so restricted by the software. I find myself using my shitty old bluetooth speaker far too often."
sonos,1ziiv7,metajames,1 point,Wed Mar 19 20:02:27 2014 UTC,"Not all my podcasts are on tunein/stitcher, on iOS I use Downcast, soon to be replaced with Overcast when it finally comes out.

The Airfoil/NiceCast combo runs 24x7 on a spare mac mini. Also great for guests who come over and want to play music over the Sonos."

You have found all of the discounts I know of but keep in mind that purchased from Amazon or Ebay is not technically covered by warranty.  The Sonos team is very loose in the interpretation of their warranty and if you call them they will often run the serial number and let you know what they are willing to do.

sonos,1zf9n9,BigWesternMan,2,Mon Mar 3 12:23:04 2014 UTC,"My friend bought it broken off of eBay with the understanding that the WiFi wasn't working and you wouldn't be able to connect it over WiFi to your network. I actually couldn't really get it to do anything, namely connect over ethernet, connect through optical out, or connect over WiFi, or even mute or get sound out at all. I still am not completely sure what the issue was - never did find anything wrong with the boards - but I'm guessing it was a bad connection since once I buttoned it up again everything started working fine."

sonos,1zf9n9,ctjwa,2,Mon Mar 3 12:26:02 2014 UTC,It is indeed great to see such a detailed teardown - good work! I've only seen a Play 3 teardown before.  It looks like behind the woofers is all one big enclosure? With some kind of foam covered opening along a long strip?   How well sealed was the enclosure that effectively seals the front from the back of the woofers?
sonos,1zf9n9,duckman_1991,1 point,Mon Mar 3 18:53:53 2014 UTC,"The woofers are all sealed to a composite block, yah. It's a rubber gasket between the woofers themselves and the composite block, and a pretty decent o ring style seal between the composite block and the base assembly. Overall I would say pretty well sealed, which went along with my overall impression that the playbar is very high quality and easy to work on, it's a pretty decent engineering friendly device. Id probably rate it a 7 or 8 out of 10 for repairability, not better because of a decent amount of epoxy and hot glue used."
sonos,1ze2lb,Throwaway_bicycling,2,Mon Mar 3 00:38:41 2014 UTC,"Sonos does not actually use the iTunes database. It just scans your music folder and creates its own database. It routinely scans that directory for new files and automatically updates the database but in no way does it work with iTunes. That means no iTunes Match. If your PC with the music on it is off you can't play your music.  However, you could connect your iPod Touch to the 3.5mm input on a Play5 and use that as a source for all your Sonos gear but it's not very elegant.  I've got a Play5 and a Connect. I use the Play5 daily as an alarm clock / Radio and the Connect sparingly. Ultimately I will be getting a Playbar and two Play1's for the living room and realistically my Play5 is too big for the bedroom and it'd make more sense if it was a Play1 as well. Once my basement theater and office spaces are complete I'll get much more use out of the Connect."
sonos,1ze2lb,xraycat82,1 point,Mon Mar 3 05:24:24 2014 UTC,"Ouch. So would it be possible to move the music folder to our Time Capsule and have that do the job without having a computer always on in the middle? I really don't want to have the iPod touch, which goes missing, necessarily in the loop.   Sucks to hear that iTunes Match doesn't work, and the Internet tells me that Google All Access also doesn't...I have to say that this is getting more complicated than I expected. (And, yeah; now that I think of it, I was expecting something magical to happen, so there's that.)  Interesting to hear that you can use a Sonos device as you clock radio; that would be appealing."
sonos,1ze2lb,xraycat82,1 point,Tue Mar 4 03:44:42 2014 UTC,I don't know anything about Time Capsule. My guess would be no but unless you can make a folder on Time Capsule shared to your network just like a Windows shared folder then it would work. We currently use Songza and TuneIn and previously used Sirius XM for a trial on our Play5. I'd like to use Sonos more but until I get a Playbar for the living room it won't happen.

We could presumably move the iTunes library to the Time Capsule (will check up on how to do that), and, so far as I understand the system, access it without a computer needing to be ""on"" at the time; same thing with TuneIn and Amazon Cloud Player?"
sonos,1ze2lb,xraycat82,2,Tue Mar 4 23:13:33 2014 UTC,"As someone that's done both Play:5 and Playbar for TV, I recommend strongly against the Play:5 with Aux.  It works great for something else going in, but trust me when I say that it's annoying as a TV output, especially vs how nice the playbar is.   1: TV's output, if it's optical like many modern TV's, you'll need to do an adapter to get it to something else; which means the adapter will be powered and you cannot use the ""autoplay on input"" feature because the powered adapter is always giving a signal and you'll walk into the room to loud hissing. Playbar has optical in, solving this problem.  2: volume change for TV gets annoying when you have to pull out your phone or tablet to do it (Playbar can do volume from TV remote, whether or not the TV is on).  3: Playbar is awesome.  The sound of the Play:5 was great, don't get me wrong, but after switching from the multi-adapter setup to make the Play:5 work to a playbar, Sub and 2x Play:1s for full surround sound, I haven't been happier. (The play:1's are frigging awesome on their own for said kitchen/office use).  Final note is like you said your current setup is ugly.  The Play:5 will look better than that setup, but not as nice as a playbar hiding discretely at the foot of your TV.  I also know I'm selling the playbar hard, but this is from someone that did exactly what you're talking about doing and I wish I'd sprung for the playbar a year earlier."
sonos,1ze2lb,wimpitron,1 point,Mon Mar 3 22:49:51 2014 UTC,"Thanks; this makes sense. But we would be likely to get the PlayBar before the new TV, and it isn't clear you can set one up without a TV.  Thanks all for the feedback; looks like I might need to consider other options."

sonos,1z7suy,kaszz,2,Sat Mar 1 08:42:21 2014 UTC,"I am actually seeing problems with components appearing and disappearing from the controller. It varies significantly during the day. When I change WiFi channels from 6 to 1, most of the components vanish altogether. Two PLAY:5 and a SUB within ten feet of each other sometimes appear as a stereo pair and sub, sometimes as (L + ? + S), sometimes as (L + ? + ?).  I have an Airport Express wired by Ethernet to an Aiport Extreme and by 3.5 mm to a Connect. The Connect is driving a pair of AudioEngine A5s. There is never any problem playing the A5s through the Connect via AirPlay, even when the Connect is invisible on the SONOS Controller.  That is my evidence for WiFi interference: inconsistent visibility of unwired components + consistent performance of the same components when driven by a wired Airport Express.  PS: The non-SONOS 2.4 GHz devices include five laptops, six smartphones, four tablets, five HUE lights with controller, at least eight BlueTooth devices, at least two printers, and a Nest Protect Smoke Detector.

sonos,1xwq4q,thecw,3,Fri Feb 14 16:50:21 2014 UTC,I achieve this all in software using airfoil speakers and nicecast both from Rouge Amoeba software. Basically I airplay to the airfoil speakers running on a Mac and then stream using nicecast on the same Mac using the airfoil speakers as the audio source. Then in Sonos I make a custom streaming station with the nicecast URL.   Same concept as the OP but can be done with any PC or Mac and doesn't require any Unix skills or a rasp pi.

sonos,1xm7gp,tashinorbo,2,Tue Feb 11 15:06:12 2014 UTC,The only way to have lag free sound on the Playbar is using the optical input. If you use the input on another Sonos speaker (like a Play 5) to stream to the Playbar you will have lag. That said once the input is connected directly to the Playbar it can stream to the sub or rear speakers (Play 1 or 3) without lag.
sonos,1xm7gp,MisterTwo,1 point,Tue Feb 11 17:10:52 2014 UTC,the Sonos Bridge doesn't act the same as a Playbar in directing sound?  I need a solution that allows for a soundbar to be connected to nothing but a power source and not have lag
sonos,1xm7gp,MisterTwo,5,Tue Feb 11 17:18:11 2014 UTC,"There is no solution that will work for your scenario, unfortunately you have to use the optical input for low latency sound."
sonos,1xm7gp,Stensby,1 point,Tue Feb 11 17:29:32 2014 UTC,So Sonos can send low-latency streaming audio from the Playbar to rear speakers but not the other way around?
sonos,1xm7gp,simpleasitis,3,Tue Feb 11 17:33:21 2014 UTC,"There's no way to get audio to the actual playbar in your scenario, unless you have a really long optical cable"
sonos,1xm7gp,simpleasitis,0,Tue Feb 11 17:35:13 2014 UTC,"Sonos says that only one component needs to be connected with wires. Can I not connect a Play 3, or Bridge unit?"
sonos,1xm7gp,ctjwa,3,Tue Feb 11 17:39:23 2014 UTC,They mean that only one device needs an Ethernet connection to your router. All other devices only need a power cable. But this is only viable for the streaming music part of the Sonos infrastructure. To connect a play station to the Playbar you have to use the optical out of the PS and the optical in of the Playbar. Afaik the play5 are the only Sonos devices besides the Playbar that have a line in and I don't see this working for you.
sonos,1xm7gp,Stensby,2,Tue Feb 11 17:58:02 2014 UTC,"I see. The Sonos Connect accepts analog inputs, would that resolve it?"
sonos,1xm7gp,MisterTwo,1 point,Tue Feb 11 18:06:02 2014 UTC,"Possible. But I don't know about the lag though. Also I think you would have a significant quality loss in your audio with this analog in. I have my PS3 and PS4 directly hooked up to the Playbar and two play3 as rears (don't follow Sonos on their stupid idea to drag all signal through the TV  downgrading every native 5.1 surround signal to 2.0 and then being emulated to fake surround by the Playbar again). The sound from movies and games with the direct connection is absolutely amazing (uncheck DTS in the playstations audio setting because the Playbar sadly doesn't support this sound format that's so common on most Blurays, the PS converts DTS to DolbyDigital then). I would not go anything down the optimum when purchasing such expensive hardware. Especially if you are having huge set up with projector and stuff. How long is the room. Perhaps if you get some really long and good isolated optical cables? May cost a bit..."

sonos,1vvpu2,mikexdoom,2,Wed Jan 22 20:44:26 2014 UTC,"1: As to if its the best first to buy, that depends entirely on what you're trying to do with Sonos.  If you're looking more for the music streaming to any room of the house, you might be better to start with any of the Play:X's.  If you're looking for ""Home Theater"" setup, the playbar is where to start, for sure.  2: It all depends on the receiver.  Playbar has an Optical input, that works best when run from the TV (so from there, any device that runs to your TV, can run through Sonos).  I'd probably reccomend skipping the receiver, put everything into the TV and do optical out from TV to Sonos, that'll be all the receiver you need. Also, with this setup, your TV remote is very easily paired with the PlayBar to handle volume you so dont have to open your phone/tablet just to watch TV or play a game.  3: Playbar itself doesn't quite stand up to a full 5.1 setup, but you can get up to 5.1 of Sonos Awesome.  Playbar + Sub + 2x Play:1s (You can do Play:3 also, but its not really needed).  This is the setup I currently have for my home theater and I'm in love with it.  It's a lot of money to spring all at once though but Sonos is piece-modding friendly in that you can add the components bit by bit (ie, sub second, then 2x Play:1s later.  You can also do the rear speakers and forego the Sub, but you'll miss the WUB power that makes it so purdy).  It's also pretty easy to unbond the play:1s and do something else with them for a while if you want to have music elsewhere then just bring them back into the fold.  Once you have all of those setup, it is a beautiful 5.1 system."

My idea was put the Play3 in the kitchen, the Play5 in my daughter's room (total over kill considering she's 4 and a half) but get 2 x Play1 for my bedroom (the idea of having proper stereo separation is tempting and it's one zone where the volume is almost always kept very low) but I don't know if the sonic experience of 2 x Play1 vs 1 x Play5 would leaving me disappointed, better stereo separation or not.

Also, the Xbox 360 cannot decode DTS from DTS Audio CDs. PlayStation 3 consoles can bitstream DTS over HDMI. The newer ""slim"" models are able to bitstream DTS-HD MA as well.  As a personal aside I have not found a reliable blind study that shows any evidence that DTS is anything more than a gimmick licencing ploy as the quality seems to be the same as DD5.1. I would be happy to change that opinion if anyone could link me a blind study.

Some say it sounds better than DD, it's a bit higher of a bitrate.  Edit: Everything that has DTS audio, will also have DD audio most likely. DD is the standard, DTS is a step up optional standard."
sonos,1ve834,old_wired,8,Thu Jan 16 23:56:38 2014 UTC,"That's wrong! Check the backs of your BluRays. 90% of them are DTS only. DTS is the common sound format nowadays in home cinema. If you hook this directly to the Playbar, it remains completely silent. So what Sonos wants you to do is connect the BD player to the TV and the TV to the Playbar. The result is that the BD player sends its DTS signal (capable of true surround sound because its 5.1) to the TV but almost no TV surpasses DTS (which is the reason Sonos claims not to implement DTS), so the TV sends a 2.0 PCM to the Playbar. The Playbar then emulates a fake surround sound out of it which can obviously never be as good as true surround. That's just ridiculous for a system worth 1800 €. For further information read my earlier comment when the issue was still ""under consideration"": The Sonos Playbar and the things you can do with it, like upgrading it with Play1/3s and the Sonos Sub to a 5.1 setup and the overall sound quality are outstanding. But also outstanding - outstanding embarrassing - is the lack of DTS support and the communication from Sonos regarding this issue. Nowadays most of BluRays have their audio coded only in the DTS standard. The Playbar only supports DolbyDigital. So what that means is, that if you dont have a BluRay-Player that is able to put out a DTS coded audio file as a DolbyDigital signal like the Playstation 3 (other than that this is a very rare feature on BD players), you get from those movies just silence out of the Sonos playbar. The only workaround is to drag the sound signal of your BluRay player through the TV instead of hooking the player directly on the Playbar. The result is a upmixed fake surround sound because the majority of TVs does not support outputting 5.1 signals from external sources. For a 2000$ surround setup this is absolutely unacceptable. I absolutely love my Sonos equipment but this is making me angry. The DTS support is wished by customers in the ask.sonos forum for 9 month (!) now and it's still only marked as 'under consideration' with no clear statement from officials. In a AMAA chat session before the Playbar was released a developer said that it can be included via firmware update, but the kind of behaviour from Sonos regarding this issue raises the questions if they a) stumbled over a hardware issue while trying to implement DTS support and would have to release a Playbar2 for it or b) have problems with the license which could be caused by the DTS company planning to release their own wireless surround system (or something like that). Anyhow it's very frustrating for many people and I ask you to support this demand by adding your voice and/or upvote in the following thread: https://ask.sonos.com/sonos/topics/please_add_support_for_dts_for_the_sonos_playbar?topic_replies[filter]=all Dont ask me how to see the recent posts. It seems that since an update of the forum you have to click 'view more' 30 times to reach the bottom of the thread.....

sonos,1utxac,fernballs,1 point,Thu Jan 9 22:04:16 2014 UTC,"You basically gave the answer yourself. It depends on the room. Have a seat in your usual place, turn on the sound and play with the settings. Choose what sounds best for you. I, for example, had to limit the sub quite strongly to get smooth sound."
sonos,1utxac,lost_adonis,1 point,Sat Jan 11 10:50:02 2014 UTC,"I keep my SUB at +1, So you really just need to play a variety of Music and find the sweet spot. You can also just go in and adjust the SUB on the fly depending on the music.  Using the Sonos Controller for Mac or PC    Select Manage -> Settings (PC) or Sonos -> Preferences (Mac).  Select Room Settings.  Select the room that is associated with the SONOS SUB. It appears as Room (+SUB) on the Room Settings menu.  Select the SUB tab."
sonos,1urhxy,banks19,6,Thu Jan 9 02:14:26 2014 UTC,"Without using a playbar as well, there isn't a very good way of doing this.  I had a Play:5 setup to run my TV for a while and it was disappointing. Couldn't use TV remote for volume, the Auto Play caused issues because of the weird setup I had to use with adapters to get to the Play:5 and stuff like that.  I have since splurged on the playbar/sub/play:1s for full surround and am in heaven. I know that's HUGE bucks to drop, and you're hoping for a cheaper method but trust me when I say, without at least the playbar, it isn't worth it to try the TV output."
sonos,1urhxy,wimpitron,2,Thu Jan 9 02:51:11 2014 UTC,I also splurged. I never realised how much I was missing due to the built in tv speakers

sonos,1urhxy,Only__Zuul,3,Thu Jan 9 11:04:01 2014 UTC,"There is no way to pair a PLAY:1 with a TV, on its own. If you use a CONNECT with a PLAY:1, you will experience audio delays. The best option for getting audio from a TV is the PLAYBAR. You can stereo pair two PLAY:1's to a PLAYBAR for surround sound.    It's just really hard to get the video and audio synced up wirelessly, that's why you need to use a PLAYBAR. It uses the 5GHz wireless range with the PLAY:1's and PLAY:3's to get the sync right."

sonos,1uokdp,PzzDuh,1 point,Fri Jan 10 15:36:53 2014 UTC,it's most likely placement. The bass radiator on the play:3 needs to be close to a wall to get the most out of it.
sonos,1uokdp,mfryan,2,Wed Jan 8 20:41:57 2014 UTC,My play:3 is as close to the wall as the power cord out the back allows.
sonos,1uokdp,mfryan,1 point,Wed Jan 8 21:01:54 2014 UTC,have you tried moving them about 6 inches out from the wall. the bass needs something to reflect off of. I have read quite a few reviews that put a properly placed play:3 against a play:5 for the low end. The play:3 is the only speaker i don't have in my setup.

sonos,1uoy43,ChrisTheRazer,1 point,Wed Jan 15 19:34:25 2014 UTC,Considering how little the rear speakers are used during 5.1 playback I would go with 2 PLAY:1s. I have 2 PLAY:3s and 2 PLAY:1s and I have tried both setups. Save the money and go with the PLAY:1s

It accomplishes this without assistance of server-based configuration mechanisms, such as the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or the Domain Name System (DNS), and without special static configuration of a network host. SSDP is the basis of the discovery protocol of Universal Plug and Play and is intended for use in residential or small office environments. It was formally described in an IETF Internet draft by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in 1999. Although the IETF proposal has since expired, SSDP was incorporated into the UPnP protocol stack, and a description of the final implementation is included in UPnP standards documents.     about | /u/BigWesternMan can reply with 'delete' if required.

If connect is used, you can connect it digitally to the soundbar via it's digital output or analog with the line out.  If Play 5 is used, you'd use it's line out, but that'd defeat the whole purpose of having the play 5.  You'd end up muting the play 5 to play through the soundbar.  The TV's sound can be sent to the play 5 or connect by connecting the soundbar's line out to the play 5 or connect.  Questions?.. please ask"
sonos,1swvc7,brophyd,1 point,Tue Dec 17 00:22:13 2013 UTC,Looks like you'll be using the digital out of the connect to the digital aux input on the soundbar.... to clarify...  just looked at the manual.

Anyway, if you install this application, BubbleUPnP, and enable the Xposed module you can use Audio Cast to stream directly from the Spotify app. I have premium, but it works on free too (and many other music players). This is awesome because the UPnP render (Sonos etc.) do not need support for Spotify, the application simply streams the music output from your phone to the render."

At that point, you could even set up guided access so it never left the app. She will also have the option to play and pause on the speaker itself, so if she spends most of her time on one station or playlist, she wouldn't need the controller very often.

The real question is, will your TV pass through surround sound from an HDMI input to toslink? Most TVs do not, even high end models. If it does, the next question is, will your TV decode DTS to another surround format and send that via toslink? The answer is most likely no for both questions leaving you with pseudo surround.   If you want true surround sound I would get a nice conventional receiver setup. If you are like me and just want your living room TV to sound good, I would get the playbar + sub and not even worry about the surround speakers.

Personal preference would be to have 2 Play1's.  Their app handles the streaming.    Install it onto your computer, sync your music library.  I don't have experience using any networked storage for it yet."
sonos,1rd85r,riggity,1 point,Sun Nov 24 20:55:12 2013 UTC,"Thank you for clearing that up, i thought the play 1 sounded more bass heavy but i guess i needed a second opinion to validate that ! And with the sub i have no doubt it will be perfect.   @power78   I know the best way would be to use the connect but it's just so expensive only to stream from my pc ! I play a lot of games and watch netflix on my pc so i need to be able to do this from the get go. I will try it and report back my experiences here ! thanksw"
sonos,1rd85r,AdamWillis,1 point,Sun Nov 24 21:33:58 2013 UTC,"I just got the play 5 and it has a line in. I recommend spending $400 on the Play 5 over $350 from for the Connect. At least you'd get another nice speaker out of the deal. Also if you buy now, the play 5 comes with the bridge for free... so consider that the extra $50 you spent for the 5."
sonos,1rd85r,Soundreview,1 point,Tue Dec 24 01:34:01 2013 UTC,"Ok so on my first listen, i can say i am definitely impressed !  Even with the bass only at +1 ( it's slightly to the right, instead of being in the center ) and wow.  I have the day off so i will be running some tests all day and will be back with more impressions. Even thought i am very satisfied loudness/bass wise so far, i will buy the sub anyway at some point in time.   Still trying to configure the stream from my pc to sonos tho."

I'd get spotify/rdio as well, but this is the one thing I'd like to be able to do (we both listen to different streams) but can't with either service. We'd have to buy two plans, can't register them both to sonos, no other options available."
sonos,1qfzcp,metajames,5,Tue Nov 12 08:09:03 2013 UTC,"1) Yes. I'm listening to iTunes Radio on a Play:1 in my kitchen while Pandora plays on a pair of Plays:5 (named East and West) in my living room.   Setup:   Airport Express connected to Play:5 East via Ethernet and audio cable. Airport Express connected to AirPort Extreme via WiFi. iPhone connected to AirPort Extreme via WiFi. iPhone connected to iTunes Radio via internet. iPhone output directed to AirPort Express via AirPlay feature. Play:1 connected to Sonos Bridge via WiFi. Play:5 East connected to Sonos Bridge via WiFi. Play:5 connected to Pandora via internet. Sonos Bridge connected to AirPort Extreme via Ethernet. AirPort Extreme connected to cable modem.   I think that's everything.   2) I have autoplay enabled for the AirPort Express --> Play:5 East cable. It has never surprised me and I do not want to mess with the settings just to find out what breaks if I disable autoplay.   Edit: yes, autoplay is something that can be enabled or disabled in the Settings section of the Sonos controller app for IOS and OS X.  Edit: Crikey I can't resist fiddling. It turns out I can set the Play:5 East Line-in to autoplay in the Living Room, the Kitchen, or None. When I set it to None, I must use the Controller to set the Play:1 to use the Play:5 East Line-in before sound emerges. That works OK at home because the Controller can interact with the speakers via WiFi. The purpose of Autoplay is to let it Just Work when someone says ""output to Sonos"" in AirPlay."
sonos,1qfzcp,Unbathed,1 point,Tue Nov 12 14:08:59 2013 UTC,"That autoplay feature was the clincher for me. Means it can be an airplay system when needed and the sonos net streams the sound around much more effectively. Only problem I have now is the ThX speaker on my computer. You want to airplay system sound but can only choose one target, might have to get airfoil going again..."
sonos,1qfzcp,G-0wen,1 point,Tue Nov 12 15:03:41 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response! Final question, your Play:5 is connected via ethernet, do you know if this can all be done wirelessly? Is Play:5 East connected to the LAN via hardwire or just airport express in bridge mode?"
sonos,1qfzcp,Unbathed,3,Tue Nov 12 18:05:25 2013 UTC,"The two gizmos are wired to each other and to wall current, but not to anything else.

sonos,1qfzcp,scirio,2,Tue Nov 12 19:46:11 2013 UTC,"Just a quick update, I decided to implement this in software instead. I have a MacMini that does a handful of other tasks so it is on 24x7. I installed airfoil speakers and nice cast, both from rouge amoeba software. Airfoil Speakers allows my mac to act as a airplay target and then I capture and rebroadcast that stream with nicecast. Inside the sonos app I add the local nicecast url and sonos handles it like a internet radio station. Now I have a Airplay input into sonos that is all software and all digital path. Yes, there is recompression but since I use this mostly for podcasts I'm not stressing about the audio quality."
sonos,1q3tbl,simpleasitis,5,Thu Nov 7 15:36:57 2013 UTC,"I have the Playbar paired with a Sub and I agree with your point. DTS should be included as a matter of principal simply because not having it makes this premium product feel like it's missing something.   That said, I believe the whole Playbar architecture is not conducive to a true surround sound setup. By removing HDMI from the Playbar and relying on the TV to send the audio via toslink to the Playbar greatly simplifies setup and use which I'm sure was the goal. Like you mention you can connect your Playbar directly to the bluray player but then you would need a fiber switch or have to move the cable every time you change input devices. Sonos had to know when they launched the product that basically no TVs support 5.1 output via toslink so I can only assume they want people to use the product in a 2.1 configuration? If getting the 5.1 signal to my playbar was easy I would buy two Play:1s today. Even with all that I would still recommend the Playbar in a 2.1 configuration, it sounds fantastic, but I did lots of research beforehand and knew I wasn't going to get 5.1 sound. I would think they have lots of customers who expected true surround sound and are disappointed."
sonos,1q3tbl,MisterTwo,2,Thu Nov 7 17:16:56 2013 UTC,"I have the Playbar + Sub + 2 Play3s as rear speaker. The TV and PS3 are hooked up via toslink switch. As stated, with the PS3 I have true Surround from all my movies even when the BluRay is DTS-only and the sound of the full setup is mindblowing. I also get the idea of Sonos to simplify the setup with the solo input choice. But they introduced and advertise the 5.1 setup heavily. And with that they entered this market on which a DTS support is absolutely mandatory."
sonos,1q3tbl,bostondmb,2,Thu Nov 7 18:21:47 2013 UTC,Which toslink switch do you use?  I have a Monoprice HDMI 4x4 switch with toslink out and everything works perfectly.  Like you I have a playbar and 2x Play:1 setup... still waiting for my sub to ship to complete the setup.
sonos,1q3tbl,ChuqTas,2,Thu Nov 7 18:55:10 2013 UTC,I have a simple mechanical 3-to-1 toslink switch from amazon for 10€. The third line in is for my future PS4. ;-)

Hook up a target to the headphone jack of a play:5 and then you can set up autoplay to play at the play:1 from the line-in source. Expensive solution if you don't already have a play:5...

sonos,1p5kiz,amooandaroo,1 point,Fri Oct 25 22:08:56 2013 UTC,Not sure this would work (well) since Sonos doesn't sync the audio (via sonosnet - most likely witha delay from your tablet) with the video playing on the tablet itself....?

sonos,1p5kiz,amooandaroo,1 point,Fri Oct 25 16:53:24 2013 UTC,Yes that works - but I haven't seen it work yet where a single sending device syncs video and audio (eg watching youtube video on your ipad and the run the audio via sonos - that doesn't sync); only the playbar lets you play with audio/video synching I think?

My daughter likes to watch pixar films in the bath on her ipad with the sound piped through sonos connect (ZP90) we have an Airport Express connected to the Sonos and we just select Airplay on the ipad and the line in on the ZP90 via de control app. With animation-type movies, the out-of-sync speech is not a big issue (Remy and Wall-E lip movement are not critical) but when I try it with my own movies it murders the experience... There is like a 1 second delay between audio and video. Do you have any advice to solve this issue?"
sonos,1p5kiz,garywoo,1 point,Fri Oct 25 17:50:52 2013 UTC,"On shareport you can change the buffer length, just halved the default on mine and it syncs perfectly with YouTube on my iPad.

sonos,1okxcm,Rickmasta,3,Wed Oct 16 16:30:22 2013 UTC,"First, I rely strongly on Spotify. [...] Though, I do have some songs that I wasn't able to get through spotify so I either bought them on iTunes or Downloaded them then added them to spotify [...]. Will Sonos be able to play those files?   The SONOS can connect to your Spotify account (more info on the Spotify website). Additionally, the SONOS can play most local music formats, as long as they're not protected by DRM.  iTunes no longer DRMs most (all?) of their music, so if you do find a few old ones that are protected, you'd swap them out for DRM free.  /u/NoeticIntelligence is right - you can upload these to the cloud and play them from there instead.  If you elect to use Amazon, you can also use their mobile apps to stream or download that music on your mobile devices.   For those of you who have the Play:3 and recently purchased the Play:1, how does it compare? I don't need anything huge for my room, but if the Play:3 is far superior, then I'll just go with that for the extra $100.   I've only had the Play:1 a few days, but the Play:3 is far superior for me.  I wouldn't imagine the Play:1 in anything larger than a master bathroom or small office.     How does the Airplay work?

I recommend adding that playlist from Spotify and the pulling those tacks from the Music Library, then save it as a Sonos playlist. You can merge songs from any service and save them there.   As far as the Airplay, Sonos will stream any (non DRM) music right off the device onto a player right from the app, no AE needed."

I think it's is not as full sound wise as a Play3 (makes complete sense), but it was great in my bathroom. I did try it in my living first and it did a great job filling it up but if I kept it there I would buy another Play1 to pair with it to fill the room out. All in all I'm very happy with it.

This Arcam DAC is a legitimate alternative to the one in the Sonos units. Some feel there is a substantial improvement in sound. If you have a cheaper receiver with digital in, the sonos or arcam DACs are almost certainly superior."

sonos,1no58d,sputnikcdn,2,Thu Oct 3 22:35:41 2013 UTC,"Hi. No, its a stereo integrated amp (Naim) all analogues in.  So yeah, you're right, technically one could connect the sonos directly to it via its analogue out (and I tried) but the quality was not as good, I guess there are limitations in the Sonos internal DAC compared to a (high end) out-board DAC. For the price sonos is great though"
sonos,1no58d,HaMMeReD,1 point,Thu Oct 3 23:26:51 2013 UTC,"Yeah, but I already bypass my Sonos DAC by Using my Amp's DAC, because I use the optical plug.  If you can use the optical/spdif you can bypass the dac, and you can find any number of quality DAC's to act as the middle man if your AMP happens to be analog only with no DAC, or has a shit DAC"

sonos,1nbjg7,garywoo,1 point,Sat Sep 28 17:50:00 2013 UTC,Oh wow. I wasn't aware of that. That's good because the bridge was creating problems - or maybe having the playbar and bridge connected was. Either way thanks for the info.

sonos,1mknb9,rjl_,5,Tue Sep 17 14:20:49 2013 UTC,I'd imagine people buying the remote could be purists/collectors.  Realistically you could pick up a really cheap android smartphone and just keep that on hand instead.
sonos,1mknb9,Missionrh21,4,Tue Sep 17 14:22:52 2013 UTC,"There actually is one singular advantage of the remote: it operates on the Sonos mesh network instead of your WiFi. This allows it to communicate directly with your player instead of using the router as a hub like a mobile device does. Android devices can be made to have this ability as well, but not Apple devices."
sonos,1mknb9,Missionrh21,1 point,Tue Sep 17 16:55:58 2013 UTC,"Oh, very good point. Especially because I have two wifi access points in the house (for the same network), as coverage gets spotty throughout."

sonos,1mknb9,calidoc,1 point,Tue Sep 17 17:24:20 2013 UTC,You're right. Water resistance is one of the biggies that explain why the first gen are such coveted items. There is another reason that applies to all generation of sonos remotes but that's an important one
sonos,1mknb9,BigWesternMan,1 point,Wed Sep 18 11:55:24 2013 UTC,"This, this, this.  When I used to be a vendor we had several clients who had a part of their home out of reach of wifi. Several of them upgraded wifi systems to wap systems or multiple routers - but some of them were perfectly fine with a controller in that room that operates directly through the unit."
sonos,1mknb9,ahz,2,Wed Sep 18 12:35:56 2013 UTC,"I can't think of a single advantage...perhaps maybe that controlling Sonos is all they can do, so might be better if you have kids? (i.e. if you don't want them accessing other features on a phone/tablet)  Other than that, simply buying something like an iPad mini makes much more sense; regular Sonos controller updates for one!  That said, I have often watched a few on eBay.. :-)"
sonos,1mknb9,amooandaroo,2,Tue Sep 17 15:26:21 2013 UTC,I always have my phone on me. And so I have the app. Still I would buy one if it wasn't so unbelievebly expensive. Why? Because it has one touch keys. Want to pause? Want the music louder? Want to skip a track? Just one button. On my phone (and iPad and so on) I have to swipe it open and maybe close another app before opening the Sonos app and then interact with my Music.
sonos,1mknb9,llamalauncher3000,1 point,Tue Sep 17 19:22:01 2013 UTC,I bought my 6 sonos zone players about 6-7 years ago and have 3 of the old remotes (one for each floor of our house).   There is one advantage to the remotes: they work in spots where my wifi is unreliable. In our house that is e.g. In our gym which is in the basement - sonos remote works fine but my iphone app is very sluggish there. For the rest no advantage - indeed for the price of a remote you can buy an ipod touch PLUS an extra wifi access point which would solve the poor wifi reception if that is an issue.   Second benefit: my kids are 9 and 7 - they can work the sonos remote and they don't have their own smartphones so it's handy to have the remotes as otherwise half the time they either couldn't use the sonos or they'd be bugging my wife or me for our device etc.  But both of these benefits are nice to haves - I wouldn't buy a remote now anymore myself! But seeing I have them already - we do use them every day...
sonos,1mknb9,amooandaroo,1 point,Tue Sep 17 20:05:13 2013 UTC,"Don't you think the Sonos remotes have an edge over the smartphone/ipod touch solution in terms of response speed (e.g. wake up)? Those 2 seconds that usually takes a smartphone to engage seem negligible but in every day use, they seem to have an impact in user experience"
sonos,1mknb9,felixrohrbach,1 point,Wed Sep 18 11:56:33 2013 UTC,"Not really - where i have solid wifi reception the performance is pretty much the same; where my wifi is weak it is crap to use my iphone. In the garden it's actually the opposite - there I have better wifi reception than sonosnet so my iphone works fine but ky sonos remote drops in and out.  Where both networks are strong, both remote solutions are equally responsive.  And the app is better than the remote i have - I have the first gen ones - and e.g no option for 'favourites' on the sonos remote and i use that a lot on the app (for radio stations in particular)."

sonos,1m3r23,BigWesternMan,2,Tue Sep 10 13:57:56 2013 UTC,"Looks like the 5Ghz mode will enable better wireless surround, currently with Playbar + 2x Play:3 you'll get a noticeable delay."

Delay happens when adding a PLAY:5 or older Zoneplayer into the group  From the SONOS forums:   SONOS PLAY:5s cannot serve as rears because the PLAY:5 only contains a 2.4 GHz card and the PLAYBAR Audio wireless transmission between the SUB and the rears uses 5 GHz.      For technical reasons SONOS has decided that PLAYBAR will use (only) the 5.8GHz band to communicate with SUB and the PLAY:3's when in surround mode. Since PLAY:5 does not include a 5.8GHz radio, it cannot be bonded to PLAYBAR in surround mode. Stereo mode uses 2.4GHz."

If you like to (constantly) tinker with the set up to make it work, and you have the know-how, I am sure that there a few options beyond Sonos (e.g. Raspberry) but Sonos is incredibly robust, in a just-works style. It is also true that you will struggle to find massive deals on them, but after having a 5 zone set up for a few years (no playbars or sub, just Play3s, Play5, and ZP90s) I can say, that you know where the money goes; 1. to make it work and 2. to give you top class free phone and email support when you need it. that's all I can say"
sonos,1l6023,llamalauncher3000,2,Tue Aug 27 09:41:05 2013 UTC,"Was looking for wireless speaker solution. Airplay is handy but not always reliable. I liked the idea of sonos but locking into their system seemed like a big decision. When k found out the play:5's had an Autoplay line-in I realised I could hook an airport express up to it and have airplay when I needed it but sonos at the other times. To me this meant no downside. Now I have two play:5s, sub and soundbar. Definitely a good decision."

Edit: some comments:   Leaves a 'SonosVoice.wav' in the queue, can it be removed once you stop the app? Stops the currently playing track when you want to speak (good) - would it be possible to resume once you're done talking? Would be nice as a universal app for those with iPads!   Other than that, this is a really nice app! Are you using a third-party library for the SSDP and Sonos Control?"

I should be able to do this. Right now it clears the queue so I'll have to throw in some logic to remember the queue and then rebuild it. Shouldn't be too hard though. I'll look into it. Lol. I actually have it programmed as a universal app believe it or not. The reason why I didn't launch it with the iPad interface is the iPad interface currently looks like crap, so I'm going to need to do some redesign work on the interface before I feel good about launching. It will definitely be there in the next update or two though.   I'm using a completely custom built library for both the SSDP and the Sonos Control, though in full disclosure the Sonos Control library gets a lot of inspiration another open source Sonos iOS app out there.

I once had a long support chat with a sonos guy about this and he could see on his end, which sonos zones had the strongest signals and which the weakest, so depends where they're placed, they'll be more or less robust.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that not all units receive the same signal strength and might be more prone to drop outs than others... hence my suggestion for hardwiring, especially if you live in a house with stone or concrete walls.  So yeah I only have one unit directly wired, from the router in the utility room and going under the floor boards to a ZP90 in the living room. Although I do have a bridge somewhere in the house (unused) and although I could've used this bridge to save myself the hard wiring to my main music rig,  I thought it was better have the robustness of cat5 over wireless..."

sonos,1ewerb,smkelly,3,Fri May 24 05:04:34 2013 UTC,"It's similar, but Songza playlists are created by the company, while 8tracks playlists are created by users.  I prefer the user created content, because it tends to be more diverse and eclectic.  Songza employees are probably great guys, but they're sitting in an office in new york and probably aren't going to be in touch with underground southern rap music like a kid in Alabama"

sonos,1eb1q3,williamsOwen,4,Tue May 14 10:25:30 2013 UTC,"I'd say most people use a NAS (Network Attached Storage). Google it ""SONOS NAS"" there's a lot of stuff out there. It does not need to be more than one bay but two bay is better for redundancy (RAID1). They're not dirt cheap but they're like mini computers in essence and it's plug-and-forget. The idea of a 32GB card is very interesting ... although your music collection would be limited."
sonos,1eb1q3,llamalauncher3000,2,Tue May 14 12:17:13 2013 UTC,I use a 1TB WD NAS.   Best addition to my system yet.    I dare say it's made my Sonos incredibly stable.
sonos,1eb1q3,detroitcity,4,Wed May 15 00:07:40 2013 UTC,I have a 32GB microSD card in a small USB adapter that is plugged into my wireless router that hosts my music for the Sonos devices. Works fine.
sonos,1eb1q3,draimus,2,Tue May 14 11:59:42 2013 UTC,Definitely recommend doing this.   They don't make my brand anymore (Hammer Storage) but definitely go with at least a Raid 1 (mirrored) array.   Over the last 5 years I've swapped out 2 failed drives with no loss of data.
sonos,1eb1q3,answerguru,2,Tue May 14 13:08:49 2013 UTC,"I've always struggled getting iTunes to deal with a NAS based library... I rely on itunes in the cloud for playing music on my laptop. Sonos works fine with my setup, which is a mybooklive. It's also host to all my movies, though it's not very fast. Would recommend a Synology if you're looking for a super NAS. But my WD is much faster than it needs to be to host music for Sonos."
sonos,1eb1q3,G-0wen,1 point,Tue May 14 15:25:07 2013 UTC,Yeah I use a WD NAS 3TB drive I bought for less than 200 bucks. Best addition to my network.

sonos,1eb1q3,llamalauncher3000,1 point,Wed May 15 02:09:24 2013 UTC,I use a 4-bay QNAP NAS device - using RAID for redundancy to protect against hardware failure.  It also has several other features - see TS-409 specs - which may or may not be useful to you.  If I only needed storage - and didn't worry about redundancy - some DSL routers (such as my Fritzbox 7270) allows you to plug a USB storage device into it which can then act as a media server.
sonos,1eb1q3,ChuqTas,1 point,Wed May 15 09:27:00 2013 UTC,"I use a HP Microserver running Ubuntu Server, essentially a homeserver and NAS in one. I wanted it to do more than most off-the-shelf NAS could do, got a great deal on it and had the time to set it up. I wouldn't recommend this route if you want it to Just Work and aren't well versed on linux, filesystems and networking.  If you want quick and easy then get a QNAP/Synology/etc NAS to put your files on and share them to your network. Tell Sonos where the music lives (like I assume you did with your laptop) and you're done."
sonos,1e4gr5,maxandersen,1 point,Sat May 11 11:11:37 2013 UTC,Sadly no and I have no idea why not. I did see a third party web app with universal search. The search part was awesome but the rest was mediocre so I don't use it.

sonos,1e4gr5,parkerjh,2,Sat May 11 18:01:28 2013 UTC,"That's misleading what Sonos says. They imply one seach/one box but not really the case. While it is one search box, you need to pull down for your own music library and each other service you want to search. I'd like to be able to search once, and have all my results across all services without having to search each one. I'd also like to see all results in one field without having to toggle between artist, album and track.  If there's a way to do Universal that I am unaware of, I'd love to figure it out, but I haven't."

sonos,1e3fbr,parkerjh,1 point,Tue May 14 21:52:43 2013 UTC,Thanks. I noticed that service but think ill pass on that. I realized spotify is probably a simpler solution and allows me to reduce my need for keeping all tracks local.

sonos,1d91n9,ctjwa,2,Sun Apr 28 02:23:17 2013 UTC,I recommend signing up for a service like MOG or Spotify. You'll have pretty much every song ever at your fingertips.

sonos,1d91n9,MisterTwo,2,Sun Apr 28 06:14:17 2013 UTC,I'd recommend MOG over Spotify based on my personal preference and the higher bitrate streaming. But it's probably worth trying them all out as Sonos supports pretty much everything.

sonos,1d91n9,parkerjh,1 point,Mon Apr 29 02:17:44 2013 UTC,Huh? TuneIn/ (Sonos Radio) lets you connect to hundreds of thousands of different stations from across the country and across the world. I never listen to junk much less Top 40. Find some cool programs or stations.    And yes- that's what I use Stitcher for: to subscribe to particular podcasts.
sonos,1d91n9,parkerjh,0,Mon Apr 29 03:04:50 2013 UTC,The radio isn't really any different in any American city you go to since clear channel owns them all. I guess you could listen to other city's morning shows and hear their traffic and weather if that's your thing.

sonos,1aq3qy,Khaelas,2,Thu Mar 21 10:11:22 2013 UTC,"Ok, let me try and answer all of those!   TuneIn is free to use on Sonos, and it's awesome.  I know of no way to lock access to the Sonos network. Joining it involves pressing a button on one of the hardware devices, so if they can't get to that, you're ok.  To use Spotify requires a premium subscription. It's well worth it imho, as with Sonos + Spotify + iPad/iPhone you basically have your own touch screen jukebox.  What do you mean by 'locking' playlists? Being able to edit them? There is no way to do this. Any sonos controller on the sonos network can edit, add, remove songs etc.  Any tips you should know? You should know that since you're getting a bridge, your Play:5 will be able to connect wirelessly to your network. But did you know you can use the ethernet ports on the back of your Play:5 to access your network for other devices? You can go ahead and plug your xbox into it, for example, to get it on the network. Neato!"
sonos,1aq3qy,BigWesternMan,2,Thu Mar 21 10:23:56 2013 UTC,"Thanks!  That's answered everything perfectly. I didn't realise the Play:5 could be used as a switch! I thought only the Bridge could, so that's good, as it'll be next to my consoles, thanks!  Eagerly awaiting delivery of the unit now, can't wait to get started.  I think I may go with Spotify, I have a huge library myself so there's a good chance I've already got the music... But it's nice if other people come round and have a Spotify playlist setup I suppose! Only annoying thing is Spotify doesn't seem to have Pink Floyd!"
sonos,1aq3qy,BigWesternMan,3,Thu Mar 21 11:12:37 2013 UTC,"Well if your friends come over and connect thier iPhones/Androids etc to your Sonos network they won't be able to play their own Spotify playlists, rather, they can just browse yours. You configure just one Spotify account and that's what you browse in the sonos controller software. They CAN however, send their own music stored on their own phones to the Sonos devices. As an example, YOU might be playing a Sonos playlist comprising of a couple of songs from your iTunes library, perhaps a couple from Spotify...they can come over and add some of their own music onto that playlist, but only if it's from their own phone. Otherwise they are limited to accessing the same music you have access to; YOUR spotify account, YOUR music library, etc.  The Spare Ethernet ports are awesome, I have my XBOX hooked up to them rather than paying for a wireless dongle."
sonos,1aq3qy,BigWesternMan,1 point,Thu Mar 21 11:20:26 2013 UTC,"Sounds great!!!  In regards to them adding a song from their phone to a playlist of mine, when they leave, does that song get removed, or does it just state it can no longer be found?  EDIT: In regards to the Spotify thing, I meant they should be able to share their playlist with my account, and then I can access shared playlists on the Sonos-spotify app?"
sonos,1aq3qy,somephotographs,2,Thu Mar 21 11:49:53 2013 UTC,"You know, I've never tried it. It simply won't be able to play it I think, so will likely just move on to the next song."
sonos,1aiffs,crazyg0od33,3,Mon Mar 18 06:26:25 2013 UTC,"I started off with  Play:5 for my small apartment a year or so ago, so maybe I can help answer your questions:   Am I correct in assuming that a college sized apartment would be a good sized room for a single Play:5 (it's a ""medium"" sized room i guess)?   Yep, A Play:5 is great for most rooms. Remember it's just one power cable, so you can move it around as you like very easily. Mine is in a room that is a combined lounge/kitchen, something I would call a fairly large room, and it fills it comfortably.   Most of us listen to various rap artists, but it really varies. I have heard that the bass isnt very good without the Sonos sub, which I dont have the money for. Those of you who have this - is the bass an issue?   I find the bass just fine, and I normally listen to a lot of House and electronic music. Placement is going to help though due to the rear facing vent. You'll get more bass effect if that rear port can fire against a wall or something.   Can my 3 other roommates use their own apps and hook their phones up to the Play:5?   Yep, if they download the app and link it with your Sonos system they can control it too. You can all sit there and add songs to the currently playing playlist, for example.    Is there ANY way to stream from my macbook pro as well?   Not sure what you mean here...If you have music on your macbook, you can configure your sonos to target iTunes, or a simple folder, or a NAS drive etc. If you mean 'can I stream youtube videos', you'll need to run a cable from your macbook to the line-in on the Play:5. Alternativley, do what I did and buy a Raspberry Pi and set it up as an Air-play target that I have plugged in the back of my Sonos.   The sonos also does airplay streaming now as well, right?   No. If you want to do this, you'll need to plug an airplay reciever into the line-in. As above, I did this by setting up a Raspberry Pi as an airplay receiver. I can provide instructions if you want to do this.  Hope that helps!"

sonos,1aiffs,BigWesternMan,1 point,Mon Jul 15 18:16:23 2013 UTC,"Ah I see what you mean. That's not using Airplay at all, it's simply exposing your music on the device as another share to stream from. If Sonos truly supported AirPlay (which will never happen, as it's a closed system by Apple), then you could be watching a YouTube vid on your iPhone and send the audio from that straight to a Sonos speaker. That's what I was able to achieve with my Raspberry Pi (still using the line-in however)"

I've seen people rock to a single Play3 The bass is more than plenty sans sub. the sub (I think) was really designed to complement the playbar... not that it doesnt work well with anything else... it's just that the play 5 really doesnt needed... but I guess if you're used to dual 15"" subs in a car stereo... nothing will be enough Sonos does not do airplay per se but you can stream whatever is stored on an ios device too Yes.. friends can used their apps but they have to log in to your wifi network first"

Could you just find a cheap android phone and go down that route? It doesn't even need a sim card if you're just going to be using it for controlling your Sonos speakers. I'm no Android guru but I'm willing to bet there are things you could do to have the Sonos app launch every time the phone is unlocked? Failing that, have a look on eBay, the older style dedicated Sonos controllers/remotes sometimes go cheap."

sonos,1a9e13,BigWesternMan,3,Thu Mar 14 08:35:17 2013 UTC,I have a couple of play:5s. It has very similar response to them. Which makes sense because the sound bar uses the same drivers. It's a huge improvement over the tv speakers and having a sonos in the living room is handy for listening to music. Other than that the demo in store with the sub has got me thinking. I used to think the play:5 had enough rumble for me but.... :P
sonos,1a9e13,BigWesternMan,2,Thu Mar 14 11:24:51 2013 UTC,"Yeah, when I heard a Play:5 paired with a sub the difference was amazing.  Still no sight of the cheaper, matt sub though..."

For cranking up with music it is amazing. My living room is the typical open concept living room / entry way / kitchen is all one open space setup. Previously with the play:5 it sounded great in the living room but didn't really have the power to fill the kitchen and entry way. With the Playbar the whole downstairs is filled with sound, I was really impressed."

And I just love them and how easily everything works and integrates, but I'm not sure if that's a good enough reason if one already has a good stereo setup (which includes a ZP90) in the TV room   So far I haven't contributed anything here) ill post it and ask another question separately.   Wanna share your thoughts on the dilemma?"
sonos,19uq2a,llamalauncher3000,1 point,Fri Mar 29 12:52:47 2013 UTC,"Here's the specific question No.1. Does the sound bar have a DSP to emulate surround sound? If not, what's the level of signal processing that it adds? I know you can add a pair of Play3/5 and or a sub to get either full 5.1 or 3.1 but what does the sound bar do on its own?"
sonos,19uq2a,llamalauncher3000,1 point,Fri Mar 8 14:50:03 2013 UTC,"Which is interesting isnt it? You wouldve thought they wouldve gone done the DSP route... most sound bars are bought by people that dont want the hassle and/or the intrusion of a full 5.1 set up... and will settle for an emulated version of it.  Now, the Soundbar, putting all the advantages of Sonos aside for a second (multi room, streaming, etc) doesnt provide the full home theatre experience unless you're willing to invest on a pair of Play3 and a sub."
sonos,19uq2a,llamalauncher3000,1 point,Fri Mar 8 14:51:51 2013 UTC,"I see what you're saying. Not for me then. On of my Sonos zones already connected to HiFi Stereo amp in that room, tv and mac mini already connected to said HiFi amp. So my TV sounds 1000 times better than standard already but still very very good product for those Sonos users who have a crappy sounding flat screen with no external amp.  Now, if I had the money and the space the Bar + 2 x Play3 + Sub is a different proposition altogether... pricey but still better than the hassle of wiring (and operating) a 'regular' 5.1 system"
sonos,19uq2a,llamalauncher3000,1 point,Fri Mar 8 16:54:19 2013 UTC,"I have 2 Play 5s, and have been seriously considering adding the playbar to my system. Can you compare the sound quality of the playbar to the 5? To the 3 as well?"
sonos,19uq2a,jasopen,2,Sat Mar 9 10:41:21 2013 UTC,"On a side note, you can't hook up the play:5's to the playbar for surround sound. Only the Play:3's :( This doesn't stop you from grouping all the speakers together though, just not 5.1."
sonos,19uq2a,G-0wen,1 point,Sat Mar 9 23:43:26 2013 UTC,I've also just found out that the pLAYBAR has the same large speaker cones that the play:5s do. That would suggest similar bass response.
sonos,19r0em,friend_in_rome,3,Wed Mar 6 02:36:34 2013 UTC,"The search on sonos is instant on my system; I have 6 sonos zoneplayers, 3 sonos controllers + iphone and ipad controller apps; my music library is 35Gb and resides on a maxtor NAS. Sonos makes its own index so I don't think it searches the songs on the NAS it just looks it up in its own index. There are limitations - no free field search - you have to select a field to search - options are Track, Album, Artist, Composer. But works fine for me.   Had the 6 sonos players for 6 years now and still v.happy with them and see no need to change them for another system.   My 2cts worth  - hope useful input!"

sonos,19r0em,answerguru,1 point,Sun Mar 17 08:18:41 2013 UTC,"Yes.  I don't like having to tell it what field to search by, and I'm close to the 65k limit, but I like it a lot.  Much more well put together than the Logitech Duet."
sonos,19r0em,bugabago,2,Sun Mar 17 12:51:43 2013 UTC,I recently switched from a Logitech Squeezebox with the same server backend.  The difference in search and user interface is quite remarkable.  I am so glad I switched...
sonos,19r0em,parkerjh,2,Wed Mar 6 13:39:34 2013 UTC,"Another data point: I have ~10k songs on my Synology NAS and the search is instant for my library.   You can also search your other services (TuneIn Radio, Pandora, etc) and that is a bit slower, but I assume that is an internet-based query and is dependent on the service.  I agree with the idea that Sonos has probably catalogued and indexed all of my songs locally in the device."
sonos,18to3t,mgtzx,3,Tue Feb 19 16:22:40 2013 UTC,"Sonos as a whole home audio solution is top notch, taking price out of the equation I couldn't ask for a better system from a sound quality, ease of use, and streaming options perspective. Sonos + Pandora and MOG and you'll never run out of music. It truly lives up to the hype.  That said, I'm not sure the Playbar is going to be for everyone. If you look at the Sono's forums there are a lot of upset people due to some design decisions Sonos made regarding the Playbar. The Playbar only accepts an optical audio (TOSLINK) input, no HDMI input. It also only supports stereo and DD5.1 surround, DTS (used in most bluray) is not supported. Sonos has stated that they believe they home theater receiver is a thing of the past for most people now that TVs have tons of HDMI inputs and switching abilities. Because of this they expect all HDMI inputs to be connected directly to the TV with the Playbar attached to the TV's optical audio output. This is fine except for one huge problem, a very high percentage of TV's will only output 2.0 stereo audio out their optical interface even if it is coming into the TV as DD5.1 via HDMI. I have a fairly nice 2012 model Samsung TV (ES7100) and it will not output surround sound via the optical port from an HDMI source.  That said... I've already ordered the Playbar because I do not care about surround sound in my living room and I have no doubt that the stereo sound will be top notch. But if you were expecting to pair two Play3 speakers to use as surround channels it is worth doing some research to see if that solution would work for your TV."
sonos,18to3t,MisterTwo,2,Tue Feb 19 16:51:39 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the quick feedback; that is a lot of useful information!  I'll have to do some more research regarding my TV, because my intent was to pair the Play3 speakers with the Playbar."
sonos,18to3t,llamalauncher3000,2,Tue Feb 19 17:08:12 2013 UTC,"Pairing the Sound bar to a pair of Play3 and a sub is a really appealing solution... especially because you make do without a) A dedicated AV amp with all its associated head aches (settings, cables, etc) and b) no speaker cables to run back and forth... just power cables for each unit.  I did consider it for my home but I already (and Im really happy with) with a 2.0 set up for tv, movies and obviously music in the living room.. so id be a bit redundant.  For people that dont have that, it's bang on."
sonos,18to3t,BigWesternMan,3,Tue Feb 19 18:22:00 2013 UTC,"Everyone on this subreddit will likely tell you that Sonos is great, and the sound quality is great, but ultimately, you really owe it to yourself to hear the speakers for yourself before dropping that sort of money. Find a local audio dealer (Here in the UK I went to Sevenoaks I think) that can give you 10 minutes alone with the Sonos speakers, with YOUR music, so you can judge for yourself. It's what I did when I was trying to decide between the Play:5 and the Play:3's :-)"
sonos,18to3t,llamalauncher3000,2,Wed Feb 20 08:45:53 2013 UTC,"It's not the first time people ask about Sonos' SQ/Value.  I see Sonos as this very talented and witty woman. She's really fun to be with and a great cook (sorry for the chauvinistic take but it works here) but she's not incredibly pretty and/or with a great body. Spend a couple of weeks with her and you really forget that she aint a stunner.  Same happens with Sonos; SQ-wise is not mind-blowing (at the end of the day, most of it's solutions are basically plastic boxes with a lot of cheap(ish) drivers inside them... BUT the convenience quickly makes you overlook it's weakness in absolute SQ.  Even the ZP80/90/100/120 or whatever they're called now, yeah, you can pair them with top notch amps and speaker but still they're not a really high end source... BUT, as said before, the system is so so convenient and user friendly that you soon forget."
sonos,18to3t,temporarily_screwed,2,Tue Feb 19 18:19:13 2013 UTC,"That's perfectly stated. For sound's purists Sonos is not the right choice, but it is so versatile and easy to use/setup that quality of the sound is not key anymore."
sonos,18to3t,ScurvyDawg,1 point,Wed Feb 20 13:08:23 2013 UTC,I love my 5 and my 3. I have plans to add another 5 a connect and a sub. Then I'll have a pretty freaking awesome system that will offer us amazing flexibility.
sonos,18dncs,BigWesternMan,5,Tue Feb 12 14:50:50 2013 UTC,Engadget has an 'ears-on' here
sonos,18dncs,ChuqTas,3,Tue Feb 12 14:51:52 2013 UTC,"This is cool.  I currently have my TV output going to a ZP90, which outputs to a Klipsch 2.1 system (which I actually received as a gift years ago for a PC).  So at the moment, I already can have TV audio in any room.  This would just look a bit prettier though.  But it would have to be pretty good for A$1000...  (or US$700 if I do an online special).  I can't seem to find what else it does?  I thought it might emulate some sort of fake 5.1, but the spec sheet says it does 3.0 (or 3.1 with the sub, which is another A$1000 ...) and I guess Play3 or Play5's can be paired with it for 5.1 ?"

sonos,18dncs,bahuuba,2,Tue Feb 12 16:27:15 2013 UTC,How do the sonos devices used for surround know which channels to play? I.e. how do they know they are left/right rear speakers?
sonos,18dncs,yosoyelalex,3,Wed Feb 13 13:10:42 2013 UTC,"You add them the same way you create a stereo pair, i.e. it asks you to press mute on the left one, then keeps the setup. You can reset it at any times if you swap the PLAY:3's."
sonos,18dncs,cbharwood,1 point,Wed Feb 13 14:18:37 2013 UTC,thanks for the answer! so this is about the rear channel(s) right?
sonos,18dncs,PzzDuh,2,Fri Feb 15 23:41:23 2013 UTC,"This thing is beatutiful but the deal breaker for me is its lack of DTS support.   They have marked it ""under consdieration"" on their website.  Please support the idea to add DTS to the PLAYBAR.   You can do this from the ask.sonos website.   According to SONOS it can be added via software update."

sonos,18dncs,bahuuba,2,Tue Feb 12 17:34:42 2013 UTC,"Are you sure this is a feature?  I don't see that list anywhere on the SONOS pages, it looks to me like it'll either take input from the TV's optical out, or it will take input from your SONOS mesh network.   Edit: I suppose you can pair the other speakers with it, so sorry - this would obviously work.  My bad!"
sonos,18dncs,cbharwood,1 point,Tue Feb 12 17:54:12 2013 UTC,"From the Verge hands-on:  ""...in a nice touch, you can route the audio from your television to a Sonos speaker in another room if you need to step away"""
sonos,18dncs,PzzDuh,1 point,Tue Feb 12 18:01:31 2013 UTC,"As I understand it, the TV would be the ""line in"" source for the Playbar, which would be available as a source just like the ""line in"" on any Sonos device?"
sonos,18dncs,PzzDuh,2,Wed Feb 13 02:04:00 2013 UTC,"Correct, well it's actually a new source, where you have Radio, Services, Playlists etc, now there's a new item called 'TV' as soon as you add a PLAYBAR to your system. You can then group the rooms you want to the PLAYBAR and get the TV sound anywhere you want."
sonos,18dncs,smkelly,1 point,Wed Feb 13 08:59:01 2013 UTC,There will be a slight delay that you can manually adjust. The only time that would be noticeable is when you can hear multiple zones in one spot while watching.

sonos,18dncs,ChuqTas,2,Wed Feb 13 03:55:48 2013 UTC,"From what I've read they've significantly beefed up the internals in terms of processor, memory etc. perhaps with this added speed they've been able to remove most of the latency you typically would have seen if you were just piping the TV audio in to one of their older devices?"
sonos,18dncs,therenat,2,Wed Feb 13 07:03:08 2013 UTC,There's a Sync Slider in the PLAYBAR settings of your controller that will allow you to manually sync sound/video in case you experience delay.
