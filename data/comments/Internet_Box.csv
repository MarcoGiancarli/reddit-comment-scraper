Internet_Box,3e2w0z,imDudekid,15,Tue Jul 21 15:21:24 2015 UTC,Nope. Besides they are doing a season 2. Allegedly.
Internet_Box,3e2w0z,IHaveNoIdeaWhatTooDo,7,Tue Jul 21 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"I wish this could happen, but where would they place them? I can see Mike ""trying"" to help the Adams with the site and tech stuff, but that leaves Dylon and Andrew out as talent for the camera. Andrew is almost finished with his communication major and would probably work with live action productions. Dylon could edit podcasts and videos. I just speaking from what I've heard from recent events. It would take a lot of convincing of Matt and Burnie to bring them on board. Remember that they were unaffiliated with RT to not have a negative image of the company."
Internet_Box,3e2w0z,AH_Orlando,8,Tue Jul 21 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"Michael even made fun of this idea in an IB podcast, something along the lines of walking up to Burnie and saying ""Hey, could you hire this random Canadian teenager. He's a good guy, I know him, so get right on that.""  It would be great if it happened, yes, it's just not very likely at all."
Internet_Box,3e2w0z,TheDeadManWalks,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"Well, Andrew is their new intern..."
Internet_Box,3e2w0z,HackedtotheFuture,3,Tue Jul 21 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"They could make videos and do the podcast since Michael, Barb, Kerry, and then would be together."

Internet_Box,3e2w0z,Dualmilion,0,Tue Jul 21 20:50:18 2015 UTC,Mike and Dylon will never happen. all Mike could offer is tech stuff but there would be way more qualified people for that position. Dylon though. Afaik doesn't really have anything to offer

Internet_Box,3c1409,sqyguy,3,Fri Jul 3 21:56:03 2015 UTC,The ice tea one was actually funny because he was parodying a chicks video.

Because some how every thing he says and does always brings out a new level of me leaving with just ""what did I just view"". There's no shock factor anymore, when it comes to Mike the universe is an open and possibilities are endless.   In a way this makes him the greatest Youtuber and Internet person ever."

It is true that over the last couple of years I have grown increasingly unhappy where I live and almost constantly wished I was in Austin. Not to cut up some onions in this thread but every time I would visit Austin, Monty would always ask ""So when are you moving here already?"" I always responded with ""Soon"" not actually knowing when I would actually be able to move. Now that it is a reality it saddens me that I could never give him a good enough answer.  I am excited to finally be close to many of my good friends down there and although I miss having a voice on the podcast, I just missed hanging out with some truly wonderful people, even if it was only virtually. I am overjoyed to be able to have some screen time and help produce content, but above everything else, I am happy to be surrounded by my friends again.   Thank you and to everyone else for the kind words and support. <3"

When he would tell stories of visiting Austin you could hear how happy he was there and how much he wished he could stay.   My only fear that he might be too rough around the edges for the entirety of Roosterteeth's audience.  Andy isn't afraid to get a little mired in controversy and while I don't personally care about what he says, jumping your exposure from 10's of thousands to 100's of thousands of people affords a lot more opportunities to offend and upset your audience.  He's a great guy, but I'm sure he knows this and will probably be pretty reserved if he is given the spotlight for anything."

Internet_Box,3820xw,SovietMaxx,3,Mon Jun 1 20:36:06 2015 UTC,I loved that episode cuz I work at a legoland and its 100% true we don't let anyone in without a kid. So many people come in wondering if it's true or not and some are even shocked that it is. I remember one couple came in and said they saw that on the website but thought it was a joke.
Internet_Box,3820xw,IrishGamer,0,Tue Jun 2 06:02:23 2015 UTC,"thats fucking stupid, little kids cant even appreciate legos in the way a mature person can"
Internet_Box,3820xw,SpippyBadger,2,Thu Jun 11 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"That makes no sense. All the sets have an age group recommended for the set, that being said I'm 21 and I agree that kids maybe 4 or 5 can't but around 9 and up they can appreciate it just fine. Still the point is to avoid pedophiles being allowed in or having kids kidnapped. There is an adult night should you want to go in and ""appreciate it like an adult"" but otherwise it's a kids attraction. There are more kids out there interested and willing to go to Legoland than there are adults who would do the same. Would you rather be safe or sorry? Granted it's the parents responsibility to watch their kids but that wouldn't hold up in court and that also isn't a good enough reason to clear the company of any responsibility if something like that were to occur. So instead of chancing it, they make a rule to stop it from ever happening."

Internet_Box,36won0,InLackOfABetterName1,36,Fri May 22 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"A brilliant opening to what should be a fantastic sophomore season. The first season definitely had it's flaws but it showed some great potential. I can't wait to see what will happen next.  I think that this episode really shows Kroon's development as a writer and director. You can really see the emotion in Bill's face when he realizes that he can suddenly see his world in a whole new light. Kroon has given great direction to the actors here and I think that it is important that these young actors have such a young and energetic director to guide them.  The scene when Tom enters and tells Bill about how in the real world everyone can see in ""1000k"" it subtly opens up the future possibilities of trips through the multiverse. Honestly Kroon may be over-extending himself a little with a show that has historically been so grounded in reality. Nonetheless Kroon has yet to disappoint us with the twists and turns in the first season of Tom and Bill.   Overall a very solid episode and quite the set-up for the rest of the season. Stay tuned!

Just imagine the most vulgar,dysfunctional people you have ever known/assosciated with, and make them Bronies. Boom, Internet Box. But seriously. Internet Box Has 8 main members, Andy, Michael, Mike, Lindsay, Ray, Dylon, Kerry  and Barbara. Mike is fucking weird man. The dude is absolutely  out of his fucking mind, not like a cool kind of way either. This dude dreams of getting anally raped by girls from his high school and his favorite things are furries and Fluttershy.https://www.youtube.com/user/CrazyJezus .Andrew, better known as the Red Faced Fuck, is a rascist homophobic and jizz wall wiping gas station attendant who is stalked and molested by his retarded work colleague, Patricia.://www.youtube.com/user/MisterSr1240  Michael is from RT so you may know him best as the Jewish Jersey shore guy who yells alot. /www.youtube.com/user/LtMkilla .His wife is Lindsay who was introduced about 20 episodes in. She takes joy from spoiling movies and shows for any and everyone. Ray used to work at Achievement Hunter with Michael, but recently quit to pursue full time streaming. http://www.twitch.tv/BrownMan . Dylon is powerful as fuck. He started doing the podcast when he was 16, so he is by far the youngest. Kerry started appearing in the podcast about 40 episodes in. He loves Pokemon and Works on RWBY. Barbara is the community manager at RT. She also frequently appears on the RT podcast. She is currently trying to win the heart of her one true love Sonny88P. By the way, the Internet Box won the Podcast awards 3 years in a row now, so they are going to make 12 more episodes! So you are not completely out of luck.  So in a TL:DR it is a buch of charming, fucking idiots who talk about MLP and shit for an hour and a half and fucking excel at doing so."

Basically they made the podcast because they had nothing better to do. Then as time moved on, Michael, Ray, Kerry, Barbara, and Lindsay became more and more involved with projects at RT and Andrew, Dylon, and Mike did... stuff.  They basically made a podcast with their friends for fun and over time, life just kinda got in the way. That said, new episodes are coming soon."

Internet_Box,34rk2t,loganlightcap,3,Mon May 4 10:35:06 2015 UTC,"I thought it was odd too, but somehow a lot of people thought Internet Box would, or at least might... get lumped in with RoosterTeeth as things he was walking away from..? I didn't see the logic.  But I guess in their defense, time spent recording a podcast is time not spent streaming, so it was a possibility."
Internet_Box,34rk2t,mcqtom,1 point,Mon May 4 13:07:20 2015 UTC,i'm p sure they don't want to be part of Rooster Teeth because Michael said IB was an outlet to say whatever and not have it come back to Rooster Teeth. which is a really good idea because we got the stories and content we have now. yay!
Internet_Box,34rk2t,Gravax,1 point,Mon May 18 14:34:01 2015 UTC,I know. He was on the podcast way before he got hired. Same thing with Barbara and Mike (as an intern).
Internet_Box,34rk2t,MarksNutt,1 point,Wed May 6 13:04:52 2015 UTC,"I thought Barbara was already hired at that point? She and Michael being the initial two RT employees ON the podcast to begin with, joined later by Ray when he was hired, Lindsay when she was brought onto the podcast and Kerry when he was futurecast into the mix."
Internet_Box,34rk2t,Blood_13,1 point,Tue May 19 02:28:32 2015 UTC,"That is incorrect. Michael was living with Jack at the time IB started. If you listen a few podcasts in, Barbara mentions that she just got hired and will be moving to Austin shortly."

However, so much of their comedy is self referential that even missing one episode is bad. I would definitely just listen to as many as you can starting from the beginning. Going into the new season it's going to be more important to have as much knowledge as possible. Even though those ""key""  podcasts are great they reference other podcasts just as much."

Internet_Box,33ap5j,dailyapple,60,Tue Apr 21 00:05:55 2015 UTC,50/50 as Mike would say. Either he does or he doesn't.
Internet_Box,33ap5j,BeamRifle,7,Tue Apr 21 03:30:23 2015 UTC,Either Ray is in a mariachi band or he's not.
Internet_Box,33ap5j,TrexJesk,33,Tue Apr 21 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"I don't see why he wouldn't. It's got nothing to do with Rooster Teeth, so why would leaving RT change anything. Sure it would be time he could spend streaming, but it was a waste of time before too.  On the other hand, if the rumours are true and he's actually dying, it may be too complicated to commune with his spirit to get him on the podcast.  In any case: roy pls"
Internet_Box,33ap5j,mcqtom,17,Tue Apr 21 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"He might, he might not. He is probably the least likely, as he was the one who had already stopped caring about the podcast the most obviously before they ended their first run and he only appeared in one of the three X episodes. I expect he'll show up for some but not many."
Internet_Box,33ap5j,randomguy000039,16,Tue Apr 21 03:56:33 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that he would come back, he has probably been to busy with everything going on to tweet about it."

Internet_Box,33ap5j,Bravo777,13,Thu Apr 23 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"I hope he will, but I kind of doubt it. If he does, he'll probably be on only about one episode."
Internet_Box,33ap5j,Imdill3,7,Tue Apr 21 00:23:43 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this is what I'm expecting at this point."
Internet_Box,33ap5j,NymeraZ53,5,Tue Apr 21 00:30:50 2015 UTC,I couldn't imagine why he wouldn't be on a podcast. Logging into Skype (IB) vs. going outside and traveling to a physical location on a day-to-day basis (RT).
Internet_Box,33ap5j,tibbers_and_annie,4,Tue Apr 21 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"He also got paid for RT because it was an occupation, the IB podcast seem more like a ""just for fun"" kind of thing, and Ray didn't seem to be having fun near the end."
Internet_Box,33ap5j,automatic_shark,5,Tue Apr 21 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, but if you think about it, they were doing weekly podcasts on top of their respecrive work schedules.  With the arrangement they made for the awards we'll only be getting one a month.  Which should make the conversations come a little easier."
Internet_Box,33ap5j,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,7,Tue Apr 21 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"as much as i hate to admit it, he probably won't be. at least not often, seeing as how the end of the last run was nearly ray-less and he kinda gave up on the podcast in the middle of the finale to play plants vs. zombies, but i really hope he comes back, i hope they all do, there's too much chaos in my life without them. but especially ray now that he left AH, im gonna miss his humor since it's 90% likely that i'm never going to be able to catch his stream :/"

Internet_Box,33ap5j,chookslol,-12,Tue Apr 21 11:22:29 2015 UTC,Out of all of the IB and AH people Ray is the one who cares the least about the community and the most about himself. He most likely will not be back.

By the way, I think a lot of people who want it to happen have no real grasp on how this sort of thing works. It's one thing when you get together with a bunch of your bullshit friends to make a bullshit (award-winning) podcast, but this is Rooster Teeth and there's a business model, and stuff."

Internet_Box,2zmt24,DeschainDuGilead,-2,Fri Mar 20 13:48:08 2015 UTC,Dylon is the worst IB member. So a podcast with just him pretty clearly is going to be the worst IB episode.

Internet_Box,2z7din,Bravo777,2,Tue Mar 17 04:48:43 2015 UTC,Just as possible protection you might want to look into a creative commons license. It would give you guys the ability to go after someone if they are shitty and profiting from the podcast if they refuse to take it down. Trademark might be good too on the logo but you have to apply for one of those vs just inputting the correct info on the ccl website.
Internet_Box,2z7din,LastHoboStanding,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:24:04 2015 UTC,I'm sure you have reasonable cause to get the app at least taken off the market or something if you so felt inclined. And if not its whatever but I figured it was better to let people know that this whole thing was fishy

Ten days ago Monty suffered a severe allergic reaction during a simple medical procedure that left him in a coma. Although he fought bravely, his body was not able to recover. During his time in the hospital he was well cared for and never in pain at any time.   Monty is survived by his wife Sheena, his father Mony, his brothers Woody, Sey, Chivy and Neat, and his sisters Thea and Theary, as well as a countless number of fans and friends. We were so proud to be a part of his life and we will miss him greatly.  Your generosity during the hours after the public statement on Friday will help his family deal with the costs of his care and his passing. You made an incredible difference during a difficult time and we cannot thank you enough.  As for honoring Monty, we will do that in our own way. In lieu of flowers or gifts, we ask that you simply do something creative. Use your imagination to make the world a better place in any way that you can. If you know Monty like we do, then you know he would certainly be doing that if he were able to.   Monty was 33 years old.   We love you, Monty."

Internet_Box,2n8xti,findingemotive,3,Mon Nov 24 10:35:44 2014 UTC,It's a totally different style of humor. Watch a hand full of videos first. Not even necessarily the video game ones that they put out for their shows but try shit like Todd and Aaron or Site Freak for more accurate representations of the weird shit they just enjoy doing (also my personal favorite more out there ones are Dr. Rex's Animal Hospital and the one they did several years ago during the PSN security breach).   The nice thing about Mega64 that you won't run into like we did with IB is they love what they do. Clearly at the end of the podcasts run some of those guys just didn't want to record any more. The Mega64 Boyz love what they do and like their fans so much that their podcasts are done live every week with an after show you can call into and shoot the shit with them. I loved IB but that's just not something that was possible when they didn't have a whole group together like Mega64 does.   Okay. I'm done sucking their dicks now. Hope some of that was helpful!
Internet_Box,2n8xti,Bravo777,1 point,Mon Nov 24 17:29:40 2014 UTC,"If you don't know who they are or what they do you probably won't like it. They talk a lot about what they're up to, give updates and a lot about themselves. You should look into their sketches and/or show first.  That being said, it's one of my favorite podcasts and it is awesome. For the full experience, meaning the after show, watch the podcast on their Twitch channel directly, cause the actual podcast is only an hour but the after show goes for one to several hours longer with calls from fans and everything."

Internet_Box,2mlfvu,promyy,-1,Mon Nov 17 21:55:04 2014 UTC,I'm not necessarily a fan of this idea but getting paid usually helps with both of those things.
Internet_Box,2mlfvu,NCR-Patriot,11,Mon Nov 17 22:04:04 2014 UTC,"If I recall, I think Michael said one episode that they've gotten no money for it, and that's not the real intent. Michael is extremely busy with Lazer team, and everyone else has jobs/other events now. If they wanted to make a podcast, they would, and they haven't completely dismissed the idea. Money could maybe have them push out an episode or two, but is that what we want? I like the episodes earlier on because they all (mostly) seem to enjoy recording it, but in the end, it because seemed to become tedious. Let's just wait for them to make more content on their own accord, whenever it may be, because that's what the podcast was originally about, friends getting together and bullshitting around for an hour and a half or so and then putting it out for us."
Internet_Box,2mlfvu,Gzideck,5,Mon Nov 17 22:39:35 2014 UTC,"This is an idea, but I have a feeling too many of us are ass holes to contribut. Prove me wrong."
Internet_Box,2mlfvu,Medichamp,4,Mon Nov 17 21:01:53 2014 UTC,"This. Also they did 123 podcasts without being paid. I doubt its a money thing. Especially when they specifically stated it was because no one had the time anymore. People love the podcast, but they have jobs and lives. A patreon account split between seven people who already have paying jobs isnt going to somehow make them start back up if they don't have the time for it. Also im pretty sure at that point they would get less than minimum wage for their time."
Internet_Box,2mlfvu,CatzPwn,2,Tue Nov 18 04:36:55 2014 UTC,People like Ray and Micheal have no competes in their contracts so they couldn't be on if it accepts payment.

But every time I checked your twitter it was just more or the same, you being mean to the people. You dont care what I think, I dont really care what you think. I just dont care for you and I don`t find you entertaining."
Internet_Box,2m4vzr,Stuartdjspence,1 point,Fri Nov 21 17:19:40 2014 UTC,"That's a real shame because I never really go out of my way to be mean to people.. regardless, sorry you don't like me for whatever reason. Also telling someone your going to unfollow them for being mean, then subsequently posting something extremely rude about them online is super hypocritical.  In the future give real criticism not just blatant hate.  People also seem confused by one fact, we're ALL dicks to each other on the podcast. On episodes I really liked because the energy was positive and it felt like a bunch of friends hanging out (RvBTO podcast) people hate them. Some listeners get mad at me or Andrew being an asshole to Mike, but when Michael does it it's the funniest thing on the planet. We don't hate Mike, it's just us joking around for the podcast's sake."
Internet_Box,2m4vzr,AHDylon,0,Sat Nov 22 00:22:50 2014 UTC,"When youre mean to people on the podcast it doesnt feel like joking around. When the other IB members are ripping on each other its always followed by a laugh or a naw we have fun. Again, I could go into a whole rant about things I dont like about you but I dont care about you enough to do that. Keep doing what youre doing. I`m just not gonna watch it and or listen to it. Or post on this subreddit anymore."

Internet_Box,2h5zvj,NymeraZ53,7,Tue Sep 23 01:47:09 2014 UTC,I completely agree. I'd be fine with 1 episode a month. So everyone make sure to vote for them everyday! I love the RT podcast but if they don't win we get both:)
Internet_Box,2h5zvj,Welcome_to_Earf_,3,Tue Sep 23 02:04:10 2014 UTC,I would love one episode a month! It makes me so happy that they made two (soon to be three) new episodes.

There was this other guy in the chat who was playing it along with them, to warn them when to censor their screen. They would then have a window of Hearthstone cover most of the screen. On more than one occasion, they slipped up and either skipped too far, or their guide failed to warn them either because of a separate version or something else. There was at least 1 report or threat of report, and to fake out the twitch mods, Westy played Hearthstone in the foreground while Mike read the fucking hour and a half long sex scene in the background (voices included).

To be honest, thought it was more detailed than that when I wrote it. Simsoy is their guide for these things, and he plays ahead so that he can warn them before sex scenes. Due to a combo of Simsoy using a pirated copy and Mike and Westy completely skipping a few scenes, something on a women's body that was gaping and also bleeding was shown. Westy minimized it, and then accidentally expanded it and showed it again. Somehow, no one reported and twitch never noticed. Then, because of issues with pirated copies, boobs were shown live. Again, avoided the banhammer somehow. Then, Mike got mad that it was 2 AM their time and decided to skip some stuff, missing Simsoy's warning not to skip so that you don't accidentally land on the sex scene. Low and behold, they land on the sex scene, and show a cowgirl sex scene just as someone who thought they were playing hearthstone joined, saw it and said that they had reported the channel. Chat, Mike and Westy decided the best course of action would be to just play Hearthstone while they read the dialogue, that way the Twitch Reich would think that the report was fake. Apparently it worked. Long live thisismylifenow."

These friends were:  Michael ""Rage Quit"" Jones Ray ""The Red Baron"" Narvaez Jr. Barbra ""Best Community Manager"" Dunkleman Dylon ""Dy-lon"" Saramago Andrew ""Redface"" Blanchard Mike ""Fluttershy"" Kroon  Some of these people would eventually become employees or affiliates of Roosterteeth.  They were also joined by Kerry ""Dragonface"" Shawcross and Lindsay ""Tugglife"" Tuggey.  After about two years of podcasts, they all decided to end the podcast.  Andrew was busy with school and work, the RT employees were more busy, and Mike was hiding his identity as a furry.  They remain friends, but the Internet Box podcast has ended.    RIP in Peace"

It is coincidental that 5/8 of them work at RT, but IB is not directly affiliated with RT or its podcast. Lindsay joined later than the first 6 after it was announced (on the RT Podcast 156) that she and Michael were dating (albeit not the reason for her joining), later followed by Kerry in the 40s, where a fan-submitted intro stated Kerry as a member, when at the time of that particular Podcast being recorded/released, he was actually not.   The IB Podcast was then confirmed dead by the gang when they collectively decided they had better/more important shit to do. Michael said they may do the occasional podcast (which I believe is another way of saying they will release new episodes on a very, very irregular basis).   Hopefully we'll see a panel at RTX 2014, and at the many RTXs to come after that."

Internet_Box,26f91e,PlasticSoul1297,6,Sun May 25 08:48:43 2014 UTC,I scheduled the first Halo 3 one and I can attest that its an absolute pain. Sorry that you have to put up with it dude. What GAIMZ were you guys playing? I haven't seen any of the posts with any recent playdates so I had no idea any of these were still going on.
Internet_Box,26f91e,meeyore,3,Sun May 25 06:51:10 2014 UTC,"I wrote down that I wanted to play last time so I sincerely apologize that I fell asleep before having a chance to play GTA 5 with you guys. I suppose the only problem is that living in the UK, the times you guys start the playdate, is like 2am+ where I live. I don't know how many people here who live in Europe but if people reply to this with interest I would gladly setup a Europe playdate in a couple of weeks. I currently have exams to revise for but anything after Mid-June and I'm 100% ready to do this.  EDIT: It would be on Xbox 360 and obviously people outside of Europe can join if they're interested."

I live in the U.S., so I won't go to the measures to start a Europe play date, but obviously many would be happy if someone did. Since IB is heavily related to Achievement Hunter, I think we'll stay with the 360 for most playdates. For some, I'd like to play Cards Against Humanity, for its replay value and that almost everyone should have some sort of PC. If we're going to keep doing this thing, I'll need to have some real commitment from you guys. I don't want to do it if people sign up and don't come. For now, it sounds like we'll probably do GTA this weekend and Cards Against Humanity two weeks after that."

Not that the other four don't have their moments (I love me some Dylon from time to time) but those four together are truly the All Star podcast.

I will admit that he is one of my favorite cast members, but I don't think that it takes away from any other podcast episodes just because he is not present."
Internet_Box,25ie9b,snooow,2,Wed May 14 17:25:57 2014 UTC,"He's easily the best speaker of the group. If it's a podcast with just, say, Barbara, Dylon, Mike, and Ray, there's a lot more pauses and the energy is generally lower. Michael is used to vamping by himself for an hour, so he can keep things moving."

Not for a while. They're all busy with their own stuff now I can't imagine why they'd want to do another episode. Maybe in the forseeable future?   Also they confirmed they will be doing a panel on RTX. I'm (99%) sure they said this on the last episode. Like a big reunion thing. I'm going through old podcasts right now. I'm at 69. (Ha..)

Internet_Box,21vz4s,PlasticSoul1297,3,Tue Apr 1 07:16:20 2014 UTC,"Heard about it through the Rooster Teeth website, journals, etc, back when it first started but didn't listen as I wasn't a huge fan of Michael at the time (turns out I just didn't like Rage Quit, which was all he was doing back then).   After the Rooster Teeth Podcast started focussing on video and live production, I lost interest. The RT podcast is broadcast super late at night here, so I can't watch it live. I also didn't watch the podcast, I only listened to the audio podcast which got worse and worse as the focus changed to video/live.   I found myself with a podcasting void in my life, and once again saw mention of the Internet Box on the RT website. At this point I'd realised that Michael was more than just Rage Quit and I was now familiar with more of the cast (Ray, Barbara, Mike & Lindsay), so I decided to give it a try. It was (more or less) a perfect fit and I listened to it almost weekly until it choked and died."

Internet_Box,1zql6g,Kevtotheoh,17,Thu Mar 6 19:18:48 2014 UTC,"Early on Michael made a disclaimer that IB was completely separate from RT, and they kept it that way.  Obviously RT was aware of the podcast (over the next few months they hired 2 people from the podcast, and had another as an intern), however IB was always kind of ""on their own time"", not on the clock."

The internet box guys didn't want loads of 13 year old RT fans getting drawn to their podcast because they wanted to be able to say whatever they wanted without offending people.

Internet_Box,1zql6g,Magnus77,9,Thu Mar 6 23:09:21 2014 UTC,"I'm going to be honest, whenever they would plug future events for RT, it was all around really annoying."
Internet_Box,1zql6g,zleek,3,Fri Mar 7 05:23:09 2014 UTC,"I thought burnie overruled Gus and got it in for an episode, but overall plugging another podcast while on one without permission is poor form.  The internet box is also pretty filthy, and not even remotely PC. As RT has grown, for business reasons they've had to toe the line more than before, and usually avoid real controversial topics as to not alienate anyone. Hell the Drunk Tank got dropped as the title because businesses have policies against sponsoring anything alcohol/drunkeness related.  So a mixture of not wanting to push a competing podcast, plus not wanting to be attached to something that might reflect poorly on them."
Internet_Box,1zql6g,shinobi201,2,Fri Mar 7 15:38:49 2014 UTC,"I think it was mainly sponsor stuff and it's detrimental to mention another podcast on your own. They would plug RT stuff on IB because they worked there and wanted fans to know what's up, but they don't want to plug IB on RT because IB is generally more offensive, or at least consists of more offensive subject matter and could cause some ruckus with the sponsors of RT. for example (as stated in the other threads) Onnit or Audible.com probably doesn't want viewers/listeners learning about A Serbian Film. Most people understand that the podcasts are separate and aren't associated with each other and each others sponsors, but people on the internet are dumb and would bitch about it which isn't good for anyone."
Internet_Box,1zql6g,TheVanguardBandit,1 point,Fri Mar 14 07:07:42 2014 UTC,"I always thought it started with Michael saying they wanted to keep it separate and not mention the RT Podcast, so it became a sort of joke of the two never mentioning the other."

Internet_Box,1zklny,robinofree,1 point,Wed Mar 5 01:17:52 2014 UTC,"But wouldn't be easier to have multiple podcasts though. I feel with the large number of people wanting to do this that doing just one podcast would get hectic and that multiple podcasts could help with this. These podcasts are not intended to be separate from each other, but to be connected by people who have varying schedules and and varying chemistry. Plus, we already have multiple people willing to edit these afterwards."
Internet_Box,1zklny,Hankyman,3,Wed Mar 5 01:47:05 2014 UTC,"I have a little experience in managing podcasts, and the problems I have had is getting people's schedules to work out. IB had this problem and is one of the reasons they stopped; there were very few times that their schedules allowed more than just a handful to do the podcast. The solution is to keep the members base at a higher number so that if three people can't record you don't have to skip a podcast. However, hosting should be rotated around to account for time zone differences.  TL;DR larger pool of people to call on for podcast recording = less podcasts skipped. Hosting job should be rotated to account for our time zone differences. Then, whoever can record will, and podcast A: comes out on time and B: more inclusive."

Internet_Box,1zh2ta,LordMillennium,5,Tue Mar 18 04:00:33 2014 UTC,"To be honest, the only way I can describe what I feel right now is to draw a comparison to something else that I love dearly, Mass Effect. At the end of Mass Effect 3 I didn't want it to finish, I wanted to keep on having adventures with the people I'd grown to know and love over the course of all three games, but no matter what happens, it has to end sometime. I hated that it had to end, I really did, but it did anyway, and that's how I feel about the Internet Box as well. It ended, and that's that. All we can do now is look back fondly on the times that we've spent listening to them banter, and yell at each other, and hope that we're lucky enough to get some more in the future."
Internet_Box,1zh2ta,TheBause,5,Wed Mar 5 00:38:09 2014 UTC,"Welp... Thanks to everyone everyone at the podcast for two and a half years of great entertainment. I'll probably wait about three months, then start over at episode one again. Its been quite a ride. Goodnight sweet prince.  PS. The singalong/gong at the end sealed it. Perfect ending."

Internet_Box,1zh2ta,solidwolf,47,Tue Mar 4 05:15:40 2014 UTC,"The way they handled this whole thing was really unprofessional. To go from acting like it was a joke to actually doing it. People care about this show, but it doesn't feel like they were really worried about that. Make a formal post announcing the end, not a bunch of cryptic tweets."
Internet_Box,1zh2ta,Magnus77,15,Mon Mar 10 04:18:33 2014 UTC,"They probably didn't know themselves. They joked to prep everyone and too show displeasure at feeling obligated to do the show. To ask a bunch of amateurs to act professional in something like this is kind of ridiculous. The podcast was never professional, and that's part of the reason people liked it.  Nobody was entitled to the podcast, or needed it, they haven't done anything to you other than hurt your delicate feelings, which they've always been up front in saying they don't give a shit about."
Internet_Box,1zh2ta,doppledeaner7,46,Mon Mar 3 23:14:29 2014 UTC,"THIS. We can blame people in the community for making a big deal of all this drama, but if they didn't make all of their shit public on twitter, that wouldn't have happened. If they really weren't having fun with it anymore and they were not getting along, they could have privately found a way to fix it, and if they couldn't, just announce when the last show would be."

Internet_Box,1zh2ta,ReuInuzuka,2,Tue Mar 4 03:26:00 2014 UTC,"I listened to the RT podcast since day one, but I lost interest after the switch in focus to live streaming and video podcasts. The Internet Box filled the void perfectly - it was a podcast first, and not a live streamed video production. It was a group of friends shooting the shit and hurling abuse at each other, not a ""performance"" with an audience. They didn't have to worry about upsetting sponsors or offending people (for the most part), and would talk about almost anything. I never knew who Andrew, Dylon or Mike were before I started listening, but now they're definitely more interesting and entertaining to me than a lot of the RT podcast regulars.  We've had a snapshot of the IB crew's lives and what's happened to them over the course of the podcast. There's been some rough patches, but it's all part of life and for the most part it's been fun watching them develop into who they are today.   I'm definitely very sad to see the podcast go, but as they've said they no longer have the time or the drive to keep it up. Much better to end on a high note (or gong, should I say) than to drag it out. And hopefully we'll still get the occasional update, whether it's through rare reunion episodes or RTX panels.

Why not Just take a few months off or something.  They say they don't enjoy it anymore but yet they are constantly laughing every cast.   I'm just confused, and sad, and in denial.   Internet Box helped me through a lot of trouble in life an opened me up to the personalities of Dylon, Andrew, and Mike. I've got to know them in a way.

I'd say episode 50 is brilliant, episode 21 purely for the 'Barbara kick my ass', episode 69 (don't even need to explain this one just listen to the intro for all the proof of its greatness) and any episode with Garrett from mega64 are highlights for me.  I'd also say if you like pokemon/3 hour podcasts/drunk Kerry and Michael then episode 81 is a must too."

Internet_Box,1zflg4,AMeowingCat,1 point,Mon Mar 3 22:29:00 2014 UTC,I'd say fight through it for episode 9 because there's so much classic shit in that one the by 21 the quality is a lot better I think.

I started with the RT podcast (which is graciously still continuing), became a fan of Michael Lindsay and Ray through Achievement Hunter (also continuing) and found IB about a year and a half ago, and it's become as much a part of my weekly routine as anything else. This is the first time something's ending on me like this, and I gotta say it really, really sucks. I loved getting introduced to Andrew, Mike, and Dylon and I hope they stay visible after IB. When it comes down to it, they're all creative people and the last thing we would want is for them to continue on doing something they don't want to and drain the charm and chemistry that makes IB so great. It's gonna be weird not looking for a new IB every Monday (with the occasional sabbatical) but worse things have happened and the world still turns. I REALLY, really hope that this is just a very elaborate prank they're all in on, but if not thanks for everything guys, look forward to whatever you do next."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,thekylun,6,Mon Mar 3 07:42:44 2014 UTC,Mike is an AH Community Hunter and has his Mikecasts he does with Westy. Dylon has his streams he does. Andrew is good friends with Michael/Lindsay so I'm sure you'll appearances by him in the community.

Internet_Box,1zf26m,Wookiee72,10,Tue Mar 4 16:35:57 2014 UTC,I am profoundly sad. I have been listening on a week to week basis since they started the damn thing 2 and a half years ago. IB was an incredibly personal podcast where I felt I was hearing a genuine conversation between good friends. I will miss the insanity. I will miss the hilarity. I will miss everything about it.

I am not known for caring about things hell i didnt even care when my sister was giving birth to my neice, i just stayed home and played fallout 3. but this is making me care i kind of feel like i'm losing a friend but may occasionally see them at walmart or something but im sure im over reacting.  Any way im going to go drink some bleach (and by bleach i mean lemonade, and by drink i mean sell on a street corner to pay for my medical bills for getting my stomach pumped so i wont die from the bleach i drank)"

Two choice memories from recent podcasts I won't forget anytime soon are; ""oh man all those poor Germans in the Holocost"" and ""street-lamp salad""  I really hope this is all fake, but as it's looking likes it's not; so long IB and thanks for all the fish."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,lelandachana,3,Mon Mar 3 11:58:49 2014 UTC,"Y'know even though I listen to the RTPodcast still, you hit the nail on the head. As much as people really miss Geoff being on the podcast, I'm kinda glad he didn't last long past the drunktank era. That was the best era tbh, it was just shenanigans about their lives and shit they did, stupid or otherwise and it was the most fun to listen to. It genuinely just felt like a group of friends shooting the shit, and we cared because they were funny, it was a look at the people behind red versus blue, and that was it. Now though, it's all ""can we get that on the screen"", ""here's the upcoming news, also RTX"", and ""this is a thing reported on by a dozen other gaming sites"". There's still occasional moments that the original feel leaks back through, and it's funnily enough Gavin who'll go completely off the rails (When you use the term ""off the rails"" to describe the usual dynamic of the RTPodcast, that is 'nuff said) and off on wonderful tangents that gets everyone interacting normally, at least until Gus snaps it down and goes into a sponsor read.  All things must end in time, and of course I don't begrudge them the number one slot and the ad revenue that comes with it, but...it doesn't change the nostalgia for the older style that IB had."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,HolyDman,1 point,Mon Mar 3 15:50:08 2014 UTC,I don't know. I feel like the patch is great for gaming news. Thats what I watch it for. Plus its short enough that if its lack luster I don't feel cheated out of my time.   But the RT podcast was running thin for a while. I still love it but what made it great was all these friends getting together and talking about their lives. You can only do that so much before you start to retell stories or have to edit heavily because of hurt feelings. And I think thats what was happening to IB. Better to end it now than limp on.   And everyone always tried to bring a list of things to talk about before. They were just fucking terrible at it and got off topic. What I would love from the RT podcast is to bring in Mat and Joel some more. Fuck I would love Geoff to show up again but that's not happening.
Internet_Box,1zf26m,lelandachana,2,Mon Mar 3 21:56:32 2014 UTC,"Actually I will say I do enjoy the patch. The most actually when it's Ryan, Burnie, and Ashley on it. They're a great team and super knowledgeable."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,HolyDman,1 point,Tue Mar 4 18:50:25 2014 UTC,I agree. I like how Gus brings the vinegar but Ryan bring a new outlook for the podcast. I always felt a little uncool because everyone is on Xbox or PS and I wasn't as much as I was on my computer (Runescape/WC3 am I right?). But I never saw Ryan as a counsel guy he was always a PC guy to me. Lord knows Gus is into PC and I love Blizzard but I can only hear so much about it.

But i understand that maybe they have lost the energy and its best to stop.   I wont hear much of Andy, Dylon and my favorite Mike again, at least with each others. Michael isnt the same in AH videos, i'll miss him railing on Mike and imitating Andrew. I'll miss Ray talking at least a little bit and i'll miss Lindsay and Kerry being included.

If you listen closely to the last 20 or so, their passion for it has dwindled, and like someone else said, it seems more like a chore for them to arrange recording it now. Gone are the days when less than half of them worked at RT and all they had to do was hit record.   But man, remember when Bunny's artwork was on the front of the iTunes Podcasts tab? And remember when that guy touched butts with Kerry at the panel last year? And remember when it became an award, then awardS, winning podcast? The point is, the good will always outweigh the bad.   I'll miss you, IB. The whole was more than the sum of the parts."

Internet_Box,1zf26m,Byrdboy,3,Mon Mar 3 14:17:54 2014 UTC,"Listener since episode 15, and it's pretty shitty that it's ending, but I'm glad that they are ending it before it becomes flat out terrible. Ever since the podcast with just Dylon I knew it was on a downward spiral.  TL;DR: Sad but Glad."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,Jackbee23,2,Tue Mar 4 01:36:37 2014 UTC,"It sucks that it's ending. I started listening last January and it has been one of the few things that I continuously enjoyed and never grew bored of it. Although no new episodes will be coming out, I will still re-listen to them all like I already do and hopefully all of the IB crew continue to be great outside of the podcast :)"
Internet_Box,1zf26m,synsofhumanity,4,Mon Mar 3 08:47:27 2014 UTC,"It's something unpredictable  But in the end it's right  I hope you had the time of your life   Strange how well this fits...  And I did, Billie. I had the time of my life :)"
Internet_Box,1zf26m,kingofuslesinf0,3,Mon Mar 3 23:43:05 2014 UTC,I just hope that they might do a random episode every now and then
Internet_Box,1zf26m,Neumann79,1 point,Mon Mar 3 16:11:20 2014 UTC,They might but they will probably be far and few between
Internet_Box,1zf26m,Bradboy,3,Mon Mar 3 07:43:48 2014 UTC,"It sucks yes, however it was going to end at some point. Keep in mind they all have lives and don't have time for it as they (might) have did before. So yeah it sucks, but it was one hell of a ride."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,rhillam,3,Mon Mar 3 15:53:06 2014 UTC,It was time. I hope they send it off with a bang.
Internet_Box,1zf26m,Bardlar,3,Mon Mar 3 07:44:21 2014 UTC,"Honestly it had not been as good since about 50, there were still a few gems but its still sad"
Internet_Box,1zf26m,Byrdboy,7,Mon Mar 3 13:03:36 2014 UTC,Yea I think since then because I think it felt like a chore to them instead of an escape or something fun to do
Internet_Box,1zf26m,AppleTStudio,6,Mon Mar 3 07:39:57 2014 UTC,"Well early on, for all of them it was essentially a bunch of AH community people who were bored and stuck in a rut, and they were just cutting loose, with the exception of Michael who was already working at RT.  Now Dylon is engaged, Andrew is making his way through school while working, Mike has finished school and found legitimate work, Ray, Barbara, Michael, Kerry and Lindsay are all super busy working at RT; it's sort of a 7 day a week job, because they always have to be ""on"" in some way or another given their massive public presence. Barbara is crazy busy organizing RTX, alongside managing a lot of community stuff. Ray does a lot of streaming on his evenings and weekends. Michael and Lindsay are getting married now, and Michael does recordings of Full Play on his weekends. And Kerry has times of just completely drowning in all the creative processes of RWBY.   They have really just reached critical mass. It's a time schedule and a community dedication that is hard to maintain. I would say if there was a time things started going downhill, it was when Dylon started editing. Not because he was bad at editing, but because that was the time when Michael, who had essentially held the show together, stopped having time for the podcast."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,AppleTStudio,3,Mon Mar 3 08:28:42 2014 UTC,IMO 48 was the last best one.
Internet_Box,1zf26m,MrWarMachine,1 point,Mon Mar 3 16:59:57 2014 UTC,"So... Should there be a thread started for people who want to possibly replace the podcast/advertise their own? Because about me and 9 other people are working on making a podcast inspired by the Internet Box, where there is a rotation and it's pretty off the cuff. Now, whether or not it's good and funny would be another thing entirely, but I feel like now would be an opportune time for people to get out there and try and fill in the void.  Sorry if I sound like a jerk for suggesting that."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,tzilla98,2,Mon Mar 3 08:45:07 2014 UTC,Well there is a sub for that it's called podcasts lol
Internet_Box,1zf26m,lemonylemon93,1 point,Mon Mar 3 21:36:46 2014 UTC,TIL Thanks!
Internet_Box,1zf26m,TAC0J0E,1 point,Mon Mar 3 21:50:17 2014 UTC,"On one end, I'm incredibly sad. This was easily one of the funniest podcasts to listen to and it had an incredibly colorful cast of characters to go along with it. I started listening at around episode 3, and I was only a fan of MIchael's at the time, I didn't really know who Ray was and while I was well aware of who Barb was through the RT Community, I had never actually heard anything from her before. What really impressed me right out of the gate was that it wasn't the ""Michael and Friends Podcast"", they all were really funny and made me laugh the entire way through the podcast. They felt like a unit, a group of friends just bullshitting that I got lucky enough to sit in on.   Of course time rolls on and people change, they all have their own lives now and it makes it incredibly difficult to schedule and manage all of this shit. I'm glad they are ending it now so that way it doesn't become a shell of it's former self and as the old saying goes: ""I hate to see her go, but I love watching her leave.""   Thanks IB, for being hilarious your way (and for putting my intro in on 44), being the most painfully honest podcast ever, and for just being around. It was a great ride."
Internet_Box,1zf26m,radsherm,1 point,Tue Mar 4 00:33:14 2014 UTC,"Sad that it's ending, but if they genuinely don't want to do it anymore, than they shouldn't. They should do what they want to do."
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,Iron_Panda,6,Mon Mar 3 07:54:19 2014 UTC,"For people who cant read the post:   It is, and we just recorded the last episode. We explain it a bit there, but it all chalks up to some of us just not having fun with it, a few personal beefs, or just being plain busy. We’ve been through a lot as a group and although some of us might not like each other as much as when we started, I still think it was an amazing journey. And it really opened my eyes to a LOT of nice people out there.  Sorry, everyone that eagerly waited every week for the new podcast to come out and enjoys them so much. I’m sure I speak for everyone when I say, you mean the world to all of us."
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,dooblett,6,Mon Mar 3 07:55:29 2014 UTC,"Does anyone know what the ""personal beefs"" are?"
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,Wookiee72,5,Mon Mar 3 07:58:08 2014 UTC,Ray/Dylon and to a lesser extent Andy/Mike.
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,Benas360,3,Mon Mar 3 08:20:10 2014 UTC,what's wrong between Ray and Dylon?
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,TrexJesk,7,Mon Mar 3 08:44:34 2014 UTC,"EDIT: In retrospect, it was a bad idea to try and explain.  None of us really know what happened, and it's a personal issue.  I apologize."
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,SabakuNoChad,7,Mon Mar 3 12:01:15 2014 UTC,"Wrong. First off, that was Michael who called out Dylon for asking donations to get him to RTX 2013. It was something entirely else that happened between Ray/Dylon. Something that's been over with for a long time so I don't think we need to rehash it."
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,chubbychampion,5,Mon Mar 3 13:28:17 2014 UTC,What am I going to listen to during my daily walk to college? Jokes aside it's a sad day for Internet Boxers. I hope they know how much we'll miss it and how grateful we are
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,theSeanO,2,Mon Mar 3 14:18:40 2014 UTC,"I did the same thing man, this sucks. I can't go back to music, its just not the same. I guess I'll start listening to the back catalog."
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,bucklau,5,Mon Mar 3 16:49:56 2014 UTC,"Personal beefs? Good God, I thought all that shit was finally over and done with."
Internet_Box,1zf3d0,99landydisco,-4,Mon Mar 3 14:28:14 2014 UTC,If there are personal beefs does that mean they aren't going to have a RTX panel?
