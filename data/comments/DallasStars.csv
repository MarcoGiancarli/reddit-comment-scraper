DallasStars,3e5ct0,MrBananaGrabber,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:09 2015 UTC,But Vancouver had Desjardins.  What happened when we had Desjardins?  Calder Cup.    Love the numbers!  There is no factor for injuries.  Look at all the injuries announced at end of season.  Just take Stars and Senators for example.  Major players with major injuries in the end.
DallasStars,3e5ct0,OrganicRedditor,3,Wed Jul 22 02:15:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely, it's a really simple model to start with as a foundation. My eventual goal would be to make a multi-level model can factor in both player and team characteristics but that will take some more time (and data collection)."
DallasStars,3e5ct0,OrganicRedditor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:20:49 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the coaching data.  There are so many people behind the scenes we never hear about.

The old team is gone, all of them. Daley was the last member of the 08-09 team, and he was just traded.  We have a great crop of d-men just coming out of the minors with veterans Johnny Oduya and Alex Goligosky leading them.  We have the most expensive goalie tandem in the league.  2 starters, Lehtonen and Niemi.  And our situation with forwards is going to be the envy of the league."
DallasStars,3dzfj5,chasermann94,3,Mon Jul 20 22:57:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not totally sober right now but I'm gonna try to write this out. Key players:  Jamie Benn #14: Our captain, the latest Art Ross trophy winner, and my personal favorite player. He is the best left winger in the league right now. In addition to his great offensive skills, he is highly physical and will steam roll anyone who gets in his way. An interesting fact about Jamie is that he was originally drafted in the 5th round, 129th overall.  Tyler Seguin #91: What a fucking beast. Originally drafted 2nd overall by the Bruins, he was traded to the Stars in 2013. He has insane speed, silky hands, and a wicked slapshot. Tyler and Jamie are a dynamic duo and the faces of the Stars organization. Interesting fact: He has five hat tricks since joining the Stars. The record for most Stars hat tricks belongs to Modano with six.  Valerie Nichushkin #43: Val is a 20 year old Russian who was drafted by the Stars in 2013 in the 10th overall pick. He had a good rookie season posting 34 points. However, five games into the 2014-15 season he opted to have surgery due to hip and groin issues. He came back and played a few games near the end of season and seemed to have recovered well. Everyone is hopeful and anticipating a strong performance from him starting this October.Here are some highlights. Interesting fact: He is Val Nichushkin.  John Klingberg #3: Originally drafted 131st overall by the Stars in 2010, however his rookie season with the Stars did not start until November 11, 2014. And what a rookie season it was. He had 40 points which put him first in rookie defenceman, and seventh among all rookies. His first NHL goal shows the type of offense that he brought to the team. Not only can he score, he also makes some sexy passes. He is a great young defenceman that is set to be part of our top pair for a long while as he was just signed to a 7 year contract. Here's a good highlight video. Interesting fact: He now has corn rows.  If anyone wants to add on this feel free, but for now I'm going to bed. #GoStars"

Which seems to be the trend here. God forbid anyone get anything other than a $250 officially licensed, game worn jersey with a name that everyone approves of.  It's not just you, and I wasn't trying to single you out. It's a sub wide problem.  I saw the same thing the other day in a thread about a game worn jersey where the dude that bought the 30 dollar jersey at dicks got called out for no reason. It's just a fucking shirt."
DallasStars,3durre,ineedatossout,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:11 2015 UTC,Not crazy about the Cross Check Jersey.  I wasn't begging for green to come back just to go buy a jersey with muted colors.  Although I do like how the shoulders and stripes kind of look like carbon fiber.  It reminds me of the Black Ice Jerseys they did a few years back.

Right after this goal is the sexy backhand pass which was pointed out by /u/scoutjustice  Same thing again. ""He's gonna shoot!"" ""No he isn't!""  Perfect backhand in tight defensive coverage. Suck it Blackhawks!  Klingberg finds jamie after the facoff. This is actually one i'd like to use to point out his killer instincts. Jamie did a great job of winning the faceoff and in doing so he broke Gaustad's stick. Klingberg picked up on that and made a quick pass to the un-defended Jamie who would put it in the back of the net. Love u Klingon"

DallasStars,3ddz4n,andybmcd,8,Wed Jul 15 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"What do we do about our logjam at D then? We still have Benn and Oleksiak and both are waiver eligible.  Despite them not being the most heralded players, they are still serviceable bottom-pairing defensemen.  Would suck to lose them for nothing. We also have Johns, Backman, Honka and Lindell knocking at the door."
DallasStars,3ddz4n,StephasaurusRexy,19,Wed Jul 15 15:07:06 2015 UTC,"Probably trade Oleksiak for another forward prospect or picks or something. Benn is super cheap and reliable as a 7th Dman, and Oleksiak isn't really going to get the kind of play time to develop"
DallasStars,3ddz4n,Rubb3rDucky,10,Wed Jul 15 15:11:09 2015 UTC,Especially with Johns coming in and theoretically replacing him as the big man on campus.
DallasStars,3ddz4n,motu147,-4,Wed Jul 15 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"Benn is super cheap and reliable as a 7th Dman.    Cheap yes. Reliable? That's questionable. He stepped up once or twice, but I'd say he's anything but reliable."
DallasStars,3ddz4n,Cravenater,7,Wed Jul 15 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"His advanced stats were pretty promising with Demers.  One thing i always think of is the effect any move with Jordie might have on Jamie. If we mistreat the older or ship him off, Jamie could be pissed and play elsewhere. His contract is up in 2 years. I would say from social media observations that the two are very close, so it's definitely a tread lightly sort of thing."
DallasStars,3ddz4n,bonk_a_donk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:44:05 2015 UTC,"I really hope Jamie is more mature than that. I doubt the Stars organization is going to be held hostage, at the expense of winning and moving forward."

Because by my count, we have 8 defensemen that are for sure NHL ready, let alone those who are contenders... We have:  Klingon  Goose  Jokipakka (btw I vote his sub-wide nickname is 2Pakk)  Nemeth  Benn  Demers  Oduya  Oleksiak  And plenty of others who could impress in training camp. What do y'all think?"
DallasStars,3ddz4n,LuckyEulogy,5,Wed Jul 15 15:29:30 2015 UTC,"Oleksiak was just signed to a ""make-or-break"" one year contract, my guess is that he's not gonna make it and will be dealt for picks. Demers I feel like was a sort of temporary fix, I can't see him staying with this team much longer. I'd love to see Honka pair with Goose or Klinger, but he's still got a season or two of development left."

They see the young talent. Benn and Seguin in their prime. Good coach and management. With some cap space left, it wouldn't surprise to see maybe one more ""solid"" signing this off season."
DallasStars,3ddz4n,OCJeriko,6,Wed Jul 15 16:41:22 2015 UTC,I think my head would explode if Nill shipped off a couple of our less necessary D for cap space and signed Franson.

These Nill moves are fantastic on paper, but if these players can't get their heads out of their collective asses, we've got a bigger problem."

DallasStars,3ddz4n,JPSonOfJohn,6,Wed Jul 15 18:25:11 2015 UTC,Does anyone else want Klingberg and Oduya to be paired? The Adventures of John and Johnny.   Edit: clarity  Edit 2: Craig Lundquist just said on XM Radio NHL Network that it seems likely that this pairing will happen to start the season.
DallasStars,3ddz4n,injun_head,5,Wed Jul 15 21:13:06 2015 UTC,"Well, congrats on landing Johnny.  He is a warrior.  All the crap he took for a bad season last year needs to be in the context of having a badly broken foot from the 2014 playoffs, which he played 2 or 3 games with against LA.  This year in the playoffs, he played with a broken wrist.  It must be the beard cause he is hard to kill like Castro.  But seriously, good guy who will help your blue line.  Wish we could have resigned him in Chicago.    It will hurt having to eliminate Sharpie and Oduya from the playoffs, but I digress.  Take good care of them."
DallasStars,3ddz4n,dschneider,12,Thu Jul 16 01:28:19 2015 UTC,Say goodbye to Oleksiak though. :(
DallasStars,3ddz4n,Green_Colossus,20,Wed Jul 15 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"That's a good thing. He couldn't earn his way into a starting job, even with last season's injuries."
DallasStars,3ddz4n,LiamMcFearson,4,Wed Jul 15 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"I thought Oleksiak was good? This is from another fan's look, I just thought he played good defensive hockey"
DallasStars,3ddz4n,andybmcd,10,Wed Jul 15 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, it was the opposite.  He had good offensive instincts, but struggled in his own end.  He also consistently fails to use his size to his advantage.  He's been frequently described as a player who plays smaller than he is from what I've read about him."
DallasStars,3ddz4n,yaba01,6,Wed Jul 15 15:50:16 2015 UTC,This x100... the dude was a whimp in his own end. I often found myself screaming at him for being the biggest guy on the ice getting pushed around by much smaller forwards from the opposing team. He never used his size.
DallasStars,3ddz4n,heftyporpoise,3,Wed Jul 15 17:01:43 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if I was as big as him I'd be the biggest bully on the ice ever"

DallasStars,3dfa04,TylerGuest1,2,Wed Jul 15 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"He has done a great job, no doubt.   I don't think he's been fleeced in any trades. In fact, I usually ask myself how he pulled off what he does, and how he continues to year after year. Shouldn't the other GMs treat him with suspicion by now? Like ""wait... you're the guy that got a 21 year old Seguin and Peverly for Loui Eriksson and some dudes?"" He doesn't give up top prospects. He seems to treat players with a great deal of respect and this has become a place free agents actually want to come. He's patient.   However, he's also had some good luck:   Boston loves trading away top-end talent just before they peak, but just after they have proven their talent at the NHL level. This is better than the draft lottery. Lecavalier turned us down before he went after Seguin (although, given 20 min/night with Benn, maybe even Lecavalier would look okay-ish?) Everyone else is afraid of drafting Russians. He inherited a team in the right direction. Dallas was already on the playoff cusp, had top-end talent like Benn, a deep prospect pool without requiring an Edmontonian half-decade lottery tire fire to get it. Klingberg is literally Jesus.   And some bad luck:   Signing 40 (may be off on the number) backup goalies that can't play near league average.   There is a good chance the #1 shutdown defender problem has been solved and we just don't know yet. I can't remember the last time we had so many good D prospects.  Every time Nill makes a move, I'm ultimately happy. If he gives up a quality player I like (Eriksson, Daley, and Robidas), he waits until their value is really high, gets even more in return, and he even does it humanely, sending them to a Stanley Cup contender.  Whenever he picks up a player I don't really want (such as a 65 year old Gonchar), he only gives up money, but the cap has been managed well enough that it doesn't even hurt.  We win 2 playoff games since 2008 and I still couldn't be happier with the team."
DallasStars,3dfa04,rws,2,Thu Jul 16 04:19:27 2015 UTC,"Lecavalier turned us down before he went after Seguin   Lecavalier turning us down was fortuitous, but Seguin was still a target regardless of what Vinny decided. Seguin was not plan B when we missed on Lecavalier."

I don't know if we'll be able to afford a true #1 shutdown defender. It would cost us like crazy and probably involve a really great prospect or a Nichushkin-type."

DallasStars,3dej73,ItsReallyOregano,4,Wed Jul 15 17:28:55 2015 UTC,Sounded like Sharp convinced Oduya to come to Dallas. Even Jim Nill's trades are making moves now.
DallasStars,3desy0,P1aybass,2,Wed Jul 15 18:35:20 2015 UTC,Either somebody is getting traded or they continually swap scratches every game between the kids
DallasStars,3desy0,ItsReallyOregano,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm sure right now Jim Nill thinks Oleksiak will be in the top 8, but who knows what he'll think in September. A few weeks ago Jim Nill didn't want Patrick Sharp either."

DallasStars,3desy0,OrganicRedditor,6,Wed Jul 15 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"Please dear God no. He's so solid and one of our few RHD. I really, really don't want to give up Demers, especially since he plays well with Jordie and Jordie is probably not going to go anywhere,"
DallasStars,3desy0,thestarsarebright,4,Wed Jul 15 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"Demers isn't going anywhere.  Top 8 is enough spots to include all our waiver-eligible defensemen, so technically nobody is out. We'll just have an extra defenseman on the roster, so 2 scratches a night instead of 1."

DallasStars,3desy0,KanyeExcuse,3,Wed Jul 15 20:00:57 2015 UTC,I think Johns is in Austin for the season.   Edit: barring any injuries on defense
DallasStars,3desy0,TylerGuest1,3,Wed Jul 15 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"If he's as ready as they claim and as he looked in the playoffs, he has just as much of a case as Jokki or Oleksiak.    He's definitely getting called up at some point this season to the big leagues if he does start the season in Cedar Park."
DallasStars,3dcn5l,Brockaloupe,5,Wed Jul 15 05:50:22 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool? Our first set of boards and glass from original AAC? They were revolutionary at the time the place opened.

DallasStars,3dbrfv,jeuno2,5,Wed Jul 15 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"Up until a moment ago I haven't bothered to look at a picture of him. I just said to myself a few minutes ago, let me search this guy in images and see his face, see his build. I immediately thought this dude reminds me of Matvichuk. And he is supposed to be a defensive defenseman. If this kid ends up being  anything like ol' Matvichuk this team is looking seriously well rounded."
DallasStars,3dbrfv,otherBarry_,5,Wed Jul 15 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"Not sure Johns' head is quite as perfectly rectangular as Matvichuk's, but other than that you may be on to something."
DallasStars,3dbrfv,bonk_a_donk,2,Wed Jul 15 06:12:29 2015 UTC,"He ""slipped by Oleksiak"" in more than one way, I think."
DallasStars,3dbi7d,OrganicRedditor,4,Wed Jul 15 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"Johns looks like he could be a very solid top 4 dman.  The Hawks fans sure seemed sad to see him go, and most of them seem to have a good knowledge of their prospects especially dmen since they called up half of their reserves in the playoffs.  And we all know the Stars are in need of good stay at home defenseman who can win physical battles in the corners and in front of the net.    I think one of the many reasons our goaltending was so porous last season was the Stars inability to clear the slot and crease in front of our goalies.  I can't even count the amount of times Kari lost a puck in traffic and got beat 5 hole or low stick.  So hopefully with Nemeth healthy and perhaps Johns making appearances with the Stars we can form a defensive corps that is able to more effectively impose their will on the other team."
DallasStars,3dbi7d,otherBarry_,2,Wed Jul 15 06:20:01 2015 UTC,"I live in Rockford and seen a lot of Icehogs games, a lot of us were more pissed losing Johns than Sharp if that tells you anything."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,ItsReallyOregano,11,Tue Jul 14 15:22:17 2015 UTC,I don't want any of the UFAs on the market. I'd rather send Oleksiak elsewhere in a trade for a good guy and make Benn the 7th D.
DallasStars,3d9ghg,StephasaurusRexy,5,Tue Jul 14 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone is down on Oleksiak.  He's young.  He's considered soft, but he was 4th on the team in hits despite splitting time with Texas.  I'm not giving up on this guy, especially since his upside rivals his size."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,HeisenbergKnocking80,5,Tue Jul 14 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"I watched him a lot last season in Cedar Park and he seemed to make a bunch of mistakes that were costly, getting stuck in the offensive zone when the play was going back the other way. That, plus his bad attitude and lack of effort when he was sent back and Jokipakka kept up really soured me on him."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,StephasaurusRexy,3,Tue Jul 14 20:01:29 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I'm done with Oleksiak, all he has is size, and it looks like he's afraid to use it. I also think people are high on him just because of where he was drafted, but let's face it some draft picks just don't work out."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,pitcher_10,2,Wed Jul 15 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"Considering our track record in the first round, completely agree. People just don't want him to become the next Chara, which if he gets a change of scenery / changes his game its a possibility."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,Dallas_Stars_Fan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:17:35 2015 UTC,Bad attitude? Can you elaborate?
DallasStars,3d9ghg,wesdub,3,Tue Jul 14 23:58:47 2015 UTC,"I think Sean Shapiro, who covers the Texas Stars, was tweeting about how Oleksiak just wasn't trying in the games right when he came back, had to be benched on the PK after allowing 2 goals on it previously. I was there myself and his play just seemed to have the air of ""I'm too good for this"" and it was a critical time for Texas in their playoff hunt."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,StephasaurusRexy,4,Wed Jul 15 00:02:21 2015 UTC,"people are down on Oleksiak because since he was first given a shot, he's had at least 3 defenseman in our system play their way straight past him. His development has stagnated, and it's something that happens. He's had 3-4 major chances to stick with Dallas, and has played himself back into the AHL every time.  This wouldnt be so bad and I would be preaching more patience, if it werent for the fact that we have so many young guys gunning for playtime to continue development. Running a pure sub 25 defense is damn near suicide, and Nemeth, Klingberg, and JJ all need time.  This doesn't even include the fact that Cedar Park is about to get another injection of really high potential defenseman including Lindell, Honka, and Bystrom.   Oleksiak still has a small chance of putting it together and growing into something great with his size. People love to cite how long it took Chara to get his act together. The problem is it's substantially more likely he fizzles out than becomes the next Chara, and we have too many other promising defensive prospects who need the time and are still growing at a better pace."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,kilios75,2,Tue Jul 14 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"But his numbers aren't horrible, both in the NHL or AHL.  Thing is, is the window hasn't closed on him.  If he was bad, I'd agree with you, but that isn't the case."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,HeisenbergKnocking80,3,Tue Jul 14 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"Last i saw, his NHL fancy stats showed him being heavily sheltered and still underperforming drastically compared to our other defenseman, and that's saying something with how our defense was last year before the adjustments."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,kilios75,2,Tue Jul 14 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"That point is certainly fair, but I think also, that he is a product of a system that do have young up and comers, and by that dynamic, he has been lost in the crowd.  His numbers, by themselves, are not indicative of the type of player he's been, nor the type of player he will be."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,HeisenbergKnocking80,2,Tue Jul 14 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"How can you say his numbers aren't indicative of the type of player he is?!? He has well above the minimal sample size to judge his play, you literally just said statistics don't matter in regards to performance.  I don't think we should quit on the kid just yet, but the numbers are telling a story that isn't what we wanted/thought it would be."
DallasStars,3d9ghg,Cravenater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't ""literally"" just say that his statistics ""don't matter,"" and saying that is disingenuous.  My post was about putting his stats in context."

DallasStars,3d9ghg,wesdub,3,Tue Jul 14 17:11:53 2015 UTC,Everyone always compares the two because theyre black...  Oduya is a drastically different player from Daley. Oduya doesn't have Daley's wheels. He doesn't contribute as much offensively.  But Oduya is not atrocious defensively. He is solid in his own end and was an excellent complement to Seabrook's offensive game. He is a defensive minded player would be a top pairing penalty killer and a solid 2nd pairing defenseman who averaged 20 minutes a game last year.
DallasStars,3d9ghg,FlayvaFlayy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:06:10 2015 UTC,I'm having a hard enough time figuring out who I want of the 8 D-men we already have. The only guy who really concerns me now is Oleksiak and he might still have one of the highest ceilings of the guys fighting for the last pairing.  Oduya may have looked better than he is playing with Hjalmarsson.
DallasStars,3d9ghg,rws,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Franson to Oduya, personally, but only if we really actually need that ""veteran"" Dman."

DallasStars,3dao2n,MatNik1,6,Tue Jul 14 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"Nothin on you bud. It's the fair weather folk that jump ship at the first sign of change they don't like. Hockey is not just about the guy you like, if you're gonna say I am a fan of team X. It's about being a fan of that team regardless of who's filling a spot on the roster. Otherwise say ""I'm a fan of dude, so right now I'm following whatever team dude is on"" ya know? In the case of this individual it's their statement that the entire team ain't worth shit to them just because one guy bounced. That's fair weather/bandwagon shit. Make sense?"

Sadly, Modano was a rookie during that failed time that card manufacturers made these things in bulk so they aren't worth much. This one may be slightly higher priced ($2-$3ish) because it's got French on it, meaning it was only released in Canada."

I guess every line gave up bad goals at times last season though"
DallasStars,3d5k60,T-rom,6,Mon Jul 13 18:36:25 2015 UTC,He shoots right and prefers the right wing.  Chicago's just had him on the left.

Then moved to Virginia for a while and a few years ago moved to Dallas. I kind of always told myself that if I settled in to a major city and they had an NHL team, I'd pour myself in to them. So, that meant the Stars.   There's a lot of promise with this team, and a lot of upside. We. Can. Score. Goals. My word. We're working on keeping them out of the net, but that's a different topic for another time. :)   If you're in the panhandle, you're probably in an area where you could get a game center subscription and watch every stars game on your phone or whatever media device GC works on.   Do you have any questions about the team? It's players, personal or history? Holler!"
DallasStars,3d0deo,Dudemanbro88,4,Sun Jul 12 16:49:11 2015 UTC,hell yea. who's the guys to watch this preseason? rivalries ? got any good sports personalities associated with the team? like commentators etc ....
DallasStars,3d0deo,DoctorBreakfast,6,Sun Jul 12 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"Art Ross Trophy winner Jamie Benn is our captain. Young superstar Tyler Seguin is our go-to scorer. We also have tons of young talent in winger Valeri Nichushkin, defensemen John Klingberg and Stephen Johns, and minor leaguers Julius Honka, Jason Dickinson, and Esa Lindell. We also have a large veteran presence in former Ottawa Senators Jason Spezza and Ales Hemsky, newly acquired Cup winner Patrick Sharp, and Finnish goaltending duo Antti Niemi and Kari Lehtonen.   We don't have too many strong rivalries within our division, the only one probably being with Chicago. But then again, nearly every Western Conference team considers them a rival. Our biggest rival stems back to our Pacific division days: the Anaheim Ducks. It's perfectly normal to want to kick Corey Perry in the nuggets and swear at him. We also have a pretty good rivalry with Los Angeles and San Jose (both from our Pacific Division days).   We recently lost our long-time play by play man, Ralph Strangis. However, we have found a solid replacement in Dave Strader, who has lent his voice to NBCSN. Our color commentator is the best in the biz. Daryl ""Razor"" Reaugh. You'll hear some of the greatest lines and analysis from Razor.   That covers some of what you were looking for. Feel free to ask as many questions as you want.

They clearly want to build a winner and are willing to take risks to get there. They also seem very committed to being in Dallas. If any team in the south is going to stick, it'll be the Stars. A wonderful history too. Modano, Zubov, Hull, the Hatcher brothers, Eddie Belfour, Jere Lehtinen, Brendan Morrow, the list goes on. On the ice the team is exciting to watch. They score goals, they play fast. Now the defense is starting to take shape with Kilimgberg and Johns. They will be competitors in a couple of years, and it's always fun to be invested early, not jump on once they get good. As someone who lived in Chicago in the mid 2000's, I can tell you nobody could give away Hawks tickets. I think Stars fans are committed to not being that petty."

The Cowboys always carry the biggest stick in town and the Mavs and Rangers jockey for #2.

I have followed them since I was a kid and never turned my back.  through the qcar and chutch days, the back to back to back 5-11 seasons, all of the ups and downs, I have not turned my back on that team once.  the level of fairweatheredness (yea its a word) that the fans of that team display is what makes me hate fairweathered fans as much as i do.  its ridiculous how quick people are to talk shit when that team loses a game, no matter how well they are doing.  and as i said, i am die hard, and don't give up on them.  which leads me to my next sort of agreement...  jerry jones is a fucking asshole that is ruining that team, and everything those before him built up.  and he squandered what he was gifted by jimmy johnson, and bill parcels, so fuck him.  but as far as you hating on the team itself, you can eat a fucking dong shitbag.  the cowboys are one of the greatest, most storied teams in american sports history.  so fuck you, and anyone else that hates on the boys."

DallasStars,3cxtga,MickeyMoorrow,6,Sat Jul 11 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"Goligoski or Spezza.  I'd favor Goose because they seem to like an A on defense and an A on offense, and he's been with the Stars for a long time.   Next time though, I think Seguin will get it, but I think he needs to mature a little more first. If they gave it to him now, I wouldn't be surprised, but I think with Spezza's experience and age, he would deserve it more.   I don't think Sharp would be considered because it's his first year with the Stars, and I think they usually award it to guys who have put in their time with the team."

DallasStars,3cxtga,deObb,3,Sat Jul 11 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"When playing NHL14, I always make sure a defensemen has one of the ""A""s. So Golig or Klingberg.    When the captain is off the ice or unavailable for the game, any alternate captain on the ice is responsible for fulfilling the captain's official role as liaison to the referees.   It would make sense to have a defensemen, who possibly plays more time in the game, as an Alternate on the ice when the Captain and other Alternate is not on the ice."

Goose maybe, if we're going to keep him as part of the org for a while, possibly Demers if we're wanting to go (slightly) younger and also keep him part of our plans? They're both UFA next season, however.  Spezza is probably an easy choice, but I'm hesitant to give him or Seguin an A. Not because neither has leadership qualities, but because they both spend a fair bit of time on the ice with Jamie, and it seems silly to have one of your A's on the same line as your captain. Fidds currently has the other A, so I think it makes sense to give it to one of the D, and games-in-the-NHL-wise, Goose and Demers have the most experience, and with the exception of Jordie (also UFA next summer), everyone is really, really green in terms of experience."

I mean, that's the obvious downside is that you're trading away a young defender with potential, probably for not much value. But if you think Oduya is a significant enough upgrade in the short term it might be worth it.

DallasStars,3cv55i,MickeyMoorrow,16,Sat Jul 11 02:01:08 2015 UTC,"any time Roussel or Garbutt do something every troll on /r/hockey crawls out from under the bridge to turn the thread from a discussion of what happened into how the Stars are a basement team with no defense and an offense full of goons. Every trade thread is exactly the same and this is no different, Any non Stars fan in that thread had the same response. Oh look more offense in ALLAS HAHAR GET IT NO D LOLOL TROLLOL. Even Jamie's Art Ross thread had it's fair share of haters calling him classless. /r/hockey is brutal on non-traditional market teams and the perpetual rebuild teams, the only team that catches more flack than those two groups is Toronto."
DallasStars,3cv55i,twentynineotters,13,Sat Jul 11 02:14:44 2015 UTC,"I saw the Art Ross hate firsthand. The zetterburg punch garnered a lot of hate for Jamie. And hell, even in this thread we have some snarky comments."
DallasStars,3cv55i,MickeyMoorrow,2,Sat Jul 11 02:59:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, I just stay in this reddit and never venture into r/hockey"
DallasStars,3cv55i,UncleBoody,5,Sat Jul 11 04:08:41 2015 UTC,I'm doing my best to personally kill that no defense circle jerk but it's hard
DallasStars,3cv55i,hardcoreotter,2,Sat Jul 11 03:50:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I posted a few replies explaining losing Daley for what some Hawk's fans have referred to as their top D Prospect is only a good thing, but after last season a trade like this is just too low hanging fruit for most of them to pass up on.   I knew something was up when I saw Hawk fan after Hawk fan say they were more disappointed in losing Johns than Sharp. Personally it gives me the feeling that Sharp wasn't the actual target of this trade for Nill. Freeing that cap space for the Hawks was the hit he had to take as fluff to get a trade done for Johns. /shrug though. That's just my theory."
DallasStars,3cv55i,twentynineotters,5,Sat Jul 11 04:01:37 2015 UTC,"As have I. I put a post on /r/hockey exhaustively demonstrating why our defense isn't crap, we'll see how far that goes.  Your theory makes sense, but Sharp definitely brings a lot to the Stars next season. Although I love that Johns is right handed"
DallasStars,3cv55i,hardcoreotter,3,Sat Jul 11 04:03:53 2015 UTC,And it's a damn fine post. Made me feel a lot better. Haha!
DallasStars,3cv55i,bonk_a_donk,3,Sat Jul 11 04:35:26 2015 UTC,Thank you sir!
DallasStars,3cv55i,hardcoreotter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:37:53 2015 UTC,I was wondering about that too. Nill was giving a lot of praise and had been watching Johns during the AHL playoffs. His comments make me think it was more about Johns then Sharp.
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,2,Sat Jul 11 13:31:30 2015 UTC,October needs to be here already.
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,3,Sat Jul 11 01:45:18 2015 UTC,"It's not an immediate upgrade, but getting Johns in return could help out on the defense as early as next season (but otherwise shortly thereafter). Supposedly a very good prospect to have kicking around the system."

DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,8,Sat Jul 11 01:34:10 2015 UTC,He's gotta be using the Jedi mind trick on the other gms.
DallasStars,3cv55i,MachReverb,4,Sat Jul 11 01:38:53 2015 UTC,Nill a Jedi? I believe it.
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,3,Sat Jul 11 01:41:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it baffles my mind, he pretty much gave up our 2 worst players."
DallasStars,3cv55i,pitcher_10,2,Sat Jul 11 02:12:29 2015 UTC,I honestly had to re-read the title several times before I believed it.
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,5,Sat Jul 11 02:45:14 2015 UTC,"It's been a few hours, and I still can't believe it. We got rid of our worst defeseman, and arguably our worst forward for Sharp and a young promising d-man. Are you fucking kidding me!?"
DallasStars,3cv55i,pitcher_10,2,Sat Jul 11 03:10:34 2015 UTC,Like how. I want a video or a recording of how Nill actually did this. I'm just so amazed.
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,39,Sat Jul 11 03:17:57 2015 UTC,It scares me how excited you guys are to dump these two players....
DallasStars,3cv55i,jazzman13,24,Sat Jul 11 01:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yeahhhhhh. Daley's not the greatest dman, he's good offensively, but defensively he has issues. We got better last season when he was out with an injury.  And Garbutt likes to take the stupidest fucking penalties all the time. He gets in his own way."
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,13,Sat Jul 11 01:37:09 2015 UTC,He was benched several times during games last season for taking shitty penalties.
DallasStars,3cv55i,unique-name-9035768,8,Sat Jul 11 02:03:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he'll likely play in the bottom 2/3 dmen for the Hawks (both in terms of ice time and quality of competition) and will be well insulated by the likes of Keith, Seabrook, Hjalmarsson, etc.. He's in a position to succeed there."
DallasStars,3cv55i,Omega613,5,Sat Jul 11 02:33:34 2015 UTC,I meant Garbutt.
DallasStars,3cv55i,unique-name-9035768,2,Sat Jul 11 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"Carcillo definitely went from goon to decent human being whenever he played with us. I think he only fought once, and assaulted zero refs this season!"
DallasStars,3cv55i,Phridgey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:11:58 2015 UTC,"Oh! Hah, well the same could likely be said, but yeah their bottom-6 forwards probably can't be sheltered quite as well as their depth dmen. So yeah, that could be an issue for them ;)"
DallasStars,3cv55i,Omega613,2,Sat Jul 11 02:43:13 2015 UTC,"truth be told, we have some nerds on our roster who love to take dumb penalties. IM LOOKING AT YOU ROZI"
DallasStars,3cv55i,HollowImage,6,Sun Jul 12 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think Daley bounces back defensively (his offensive numbers will regress though). He'll be more sheltered in Chicago and be working in a solid system. I think he'll do fine as a 4th d-man up there.  And really, if Coach Q can reign in Garbutt's stupidity, he's actually a very effective bottom 6 winger. I dunno if that's possible though."
DallasStars,3cv55i,scoutcjustice,6,Sat Jul 11 02:27:02 2015 UTC,"exactly i don't like this. sharpy, come back, we still love you."
DallasStars,3cv55i,Lameduck57,6,Sat Jul 11 02:34:30 2015 UTC,"Both former DAL players had their issues, but they weren't as worthless as the fanbase on reddit would have you believe.   Daley has become a scoring OFD an occasional defensive liability. We have so many smallish-to-regular offensive minded defencemen, we don't miss much offloading him.  Garbutt has his troubles with rules and getting scratched, but he can turn things on by himself when hes properly motivated. Skilled 3-4th liner.  Trade is a solid win for the Stars- but both could fit in and look great in Chicago."
DallasStars,3cv55i,JeffPeppers,4,Sat Jul 11 03:39:41 2015 UTC,"its not that they're bad players or anything, their time with the stars was just up... Daley has been a stud for us in the past, and he could be a stud again, he just wasnt working out here anymore, same goes for garbutt, he's had his flashes of good play, but he is just a little bit box prone. Might just come down to them needing a change of scenery"
DallasStars,3cv55i,ARandomWhiteBoy,6,Sat Jul 11 03:48:53 2015 UTC,these were not the comments i wanted to read coming in here tonight...FUCK
DallasStars,3cv55i,bud1316,8,Sat Jul 11 01:53:59 2015 UTC,Garbutt was pretty good a couple years ago. He seemed frustrated this past season. He is fast and scored some clutch goals. Maybe the change will do him good.

DallasStars,3cv55i,TexasLizard,2,Sat Jul 11 03:11:40 2015 UTC,Sounds like it was a rollercoaster of emotions lol
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,9,Sat Jul 11 03:16:52 2015 UTC,"I know most people didn't want to take on his contract, but I'm pretty excited about this.  I like Sharp's game."
DallasStars,3cv55i,flashbang217,14,Sat Jul 11 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"It's not even a bad contract. The dollars are high, but it's only two years. Which means it comes off the books at the same time we need to re-sign Jamie."
DallasStars,3cv55i,scoutcjustice,5,Sat Jul 11 02:27:40 2015 UTC,Nill has got the timing on contracts down to near perfection in terms of re-signing Jamie and Tyler. If I remember from the last time I checked pretty much everyone ends right around the time we have to re-sign those two.
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,7,Sat Jul 11 02:44:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Hemsky (4M) and now Sharp (5.9M) come off the books when Jamie is up. Spezza (7.5M) comes off when Tyler is up. Nill is good."

DallasStars,3cv55i,R0GERTHEALIEN,8,Sat Jul 11 04:50:29 2015 UTC,"Holy shit Nill is a god. We got rid of Daley (the problem with our D IMO, after he got hurt our D got better) we also ditched Garbutt, a player who hasn't been productive since last year's playoffs. And in return we got a player who is capable of being on our 2nd line. Love this trade!"
DallasStars,3cv55i,Brolympia,4,Sat Jul 11 02:09:04 2015 UTC,Brings a lot of playoff experience and leadership.. Think he makes a good impact in the locker room with this team's stars being young?
DallasStars,3cv55i,stydolph,4,Sat Jul 11 01:35:31 2015 UTC,Are we going to get any value out of Daley and Garbutt? I feel like I remember Garbutt playing pretty well against us in one game and everyone liking him.
DallasStars,3cv55i,jacksonvstheworld,20,Sat Jul 11 02:00:44 2015 UTC,You'll enjoy him maybe 5 games out of the season. You'll hate him roughly 60. The remaining 17 he'll be suspended.
DallasStars,3cv55i,BaconInMyPants,9,Sat Jul 11 02:22:24 2015 UTC,Best fucking answer. Absolutely Nailed it.
DallasStars,3cv55i,twentynineotters,7,Sat Jul 11 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"Garbutt has a great hustle to him, but he takes silly penalties at bad times. I'll miss his grit, but I love this trade."
DallasStars,3cv55i,laxintx,0,Sat Jul 11 02:18:43 2015 UTC,"We must have got him for his ""grit"" then. I think the Black hawks will expect more out of him or he will be gone."
DallasStars,3cv55i,Mikeydoes,0,Sat Jul 11 02:24:06 2015 UTC,"If he can cut back on the stupid ass penalties, he'll be a pleasant surprise for y'all.  He's money on the breakaway and has the speed to get those chances pretty regularly.  One of the fastest guys on the team with a motor that doesn't quit.  I honestly think he has quicker feet that Seguin.  He's good along the boards and in the corners.  Draws a lot of penalties and kills em, too.  He's an ideal third liner.    Then you get into the stupid, occasionally dangerous penalties.  Elbows, knees, dives, just stupid shit.  He got suspended for kneeing Talyor Hall.  Also got suspended for a slue foot and followed it up with the wonderful thought, ""I can't change the player I am.""  He reminds me a lot of Steve Downey."
DallasStars,3cv55i,tasteofflames,2,Sat Jul 11 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"People here will irrationally hate Garbs because of a few dirty plays, but it's just a consequence of his style.  When he's on, he's a perfect third line winger.  Fast, relentless forechecker, and can score simple goals.  Not to mention, he's a great penalty killer and will drop gloves if need be.  You'll like him for the majority of the season.    However, he'll have his dumb penalties in the midst of the good times, and if you're unlucky, he'll stop thinking again and do something to get him a call from the league office."
DallasStars,3cv55i,KanyeExcuse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:44:35 2015 UTC,"I think Garbutt has value, especially with half of his salary retained. He isn't a special player, and he will take some remarkably stupid penalties, but as a third/fourth line player with some penalty killing duties, he can be productive at a very nice cost.  I think Daley is worthless. His defense is awful, and it more than counterbalances the nice offensive numbers. His cap number is pretty good, and in a sheltered role with some powerplay time, maybe you can get enough out of his offense to counterbalance the defense. But the defense is very bad."
DallasStars,3cv55i,FaceF18,3,Sat Jul 11 06:35:08 2015 UTC,:( enjoy the handsome man while you have him
DallasStars,3cv55i,drinkbeerneverfear,6,Sat Jul 11 02:03:24 2015 UTC,"Dude, Nill is the fucking best. I think this trade gives us another push towards the cup. Garbutt gone?! Fuck yes! Daley will be missed, but his D skills sucked. Go Stars!"
DallasStars,3cv55i,Dallas_Stars_Fan,7,Sat Jul 11 04:03:00 2015 UTC,"Why all the hate for Daley? He just came off a career season. Oleksiak is a big mediocre softie, and Benn is a liability with spurts of competence. Daley has been far from our weakest link. At worst, he disappears--which isn't bad. It means he's not doing anything tragically wrong.   I know more about goalies than any other position, so my opinion is flawed and i know it but...daley wasn't awful--and he wasn't our weakest link."
DallasStars,3cv55i,Unit1224,4,Sat Jul 11 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"daley wasn't awful--and he wasn't our weakest link.   Defensively he was if you put any stock into advanced stats. Like, far and away worst. Maybe worst in the league."
DallasStars,3cv55i,scoutcjustice,2,Sat Jul 11 02:30:17 2015 UTC,Ah fair enough. Not stats guy. Thanks for the knowledge.
DallasStars,3cv55i,Unit1224,6,Sat Jul 11 02:35:23 2015 UTC,"Look at his plus minus. He brings down everyone he plays with. Yeah he puts up goals, but he makes too many mistakes that lead to opposing goals. This trade is a good thing.  I literally jumped up and down when i seen this trade."
DallasStars,3cv55i,blarc212,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"The problem with Daley is exemplified by the recurring question this year of whether he'd actually be better for us as a winger than a defender. Whether meant entirely seriously or not, it serves to illustrate how much Daley's game is so biased to the offensive side that it ends up hurting us more than it does helping (also as evidenced by his +/-)."
DallasStars,3cv55i,btharveyku08,2,Sat Jul 11 02:39:23 2015 UTC,Do you think he could function as a legit LW?
DallasStars,3cv55i,Patrick_Kane,2,Sat Jul 11 06:38:09 2015 UTC,Some of us were actually asking toward the end if the year last year. The answer is that we really don't know. Kinda thought it would've been cool to put him on a wing I'm preseason and see what he could do.
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:52:57 2015 UTC,"For how  much he's getting paid, I'd rather put an actual LW, young and eager to improve, out in a lower line."

DallasStars,3cv55i,scoutcjustice,2,Sat Jul 11 01:39:50 2015 UTC,We gotta change the sidebar picture again with Nill.  It's that fucking mustache man.

DallasStars,3cv55i,MickeyMoorrow,2,Sat Jul 11 05:17:38 2015 UTC,I've heard nothing but great thongs about Honka. I just need to check out some of his playing.
DallasStars,3cv55i,MickeyMoorrow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:06:18 2015 UTC,I would look for video but they're all scoring and that really doesn't tell Honka's story - although he did get a goal against IceHogs in playoffs.  He's frightening every time he gets on the ice.  It's like he goes to an alternate universe.  There is nobody else on Stars like him.  Do you go to games at CPC?
DallasStars,3cv55i,OrganicRedditor,2,Sat Jul 11 21:07:12 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I wish. I had to move up in the panhandle so rarely get to even go to Stars game. I'm seeking a job down there where I can attend more. The Stars are a big part of my life so its worth it."

DallasStars,3cv55i,brendan87na,3,Tue Jul 14 03:48:24 2015 UTC,Less needed but more attainable.
DallasStars,3cv55i,GTI-Mk6,2,Fri Jul 17 00:18:32 2015 UTC,Good point. And we got rid of 2 players who seemed to drag down their partners and their team. 10/10 would trade again.
DallasStars,3cv55i,MickeyMoorrow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:34:20 2015 UTC,What top minute eating d-man are you getting with a package centered around Ryan Garbutt and Trevor Daley?  Those talks begin with Valeri Nichushkin and only escalate upwards from there.
DallasStars,3cv55i,KanyeExcuse,2,Sat Jul 11 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"Frankly, if Nill is saying ""the time to win is now"", I don't think Val is off the table.  There have been rumblings since last year that he's bit of a pain in the ass with some fitness/motivation issues (not necessarily that he's out of shape, but that he doesn't do what is asked of Stars trainers)...so, I wouldn't put it past the organization to move him for a big defensive piece."

DallasStars,3cv55i,brickwall5,2,Sat Jul 11 05:45:55 2015 UTC,Nothing published...just folks I know close to the team.  I've heard the same from other people with contacts within the organization. I don't claim that it's truth...only that it's a rumor that's out there.
DallasStars,3cv55i,MaverickTTT,2,Sat Jul 11 08:44:32 2015 UTC,Never trust anything the Stars say unless it's announcing a move.
DallasStars,3cv55i,Untjosh1,2,Sat Jul 11 16:21:50 2015 UTC,I literally lost it. I now need to meet Mr. Nill to thank him for our yearly gifts. Praise the Nill :)

DallasStars,3cv55i,1205k,2,Sat Jul 11 02:31:46 2015 UTC,"Good riddance to Garbutt, but I'll never understand the outright hatred of Daley in this sub.  Good dude who has been a loyal soldier for 11 years and a serviceable defenseman that, in a different system, may very well thrive.  I wish him the best."
DallasStars,3cv55i,MaverickTTT,2,Sat Jul 11 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know that people actually hate Daley, at least I never have. He was great at times with the offensive aspects but the stats are there to prove that he really did bring everyone down whenever he's on the ice. I'll miss having him as a star but I think this is a great move that helps the blue line a lot."
DallasStars,3cv55i,btharveyku08,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"In what's recognized to be his most productive year ever, Daley was more of a liability to our game than a help, due to his defense being so sub-par. I'll miss him for his long-tenured nature, but there's no question that him leaving improved our defensive corps."
DallasStars,3cv55i,thestarsarebright,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:38:17 2015 UTC,"I do love the man for that and I defended him so many times, but it was so hard to watch him last year. He's defense was all over the place. I really do hope he does well in Chicago."
DallasStars,3cv55i,KikiFlowers,2,Sat Jul 11 16:30:20 2015 UTC,"Take good care of Sharpie, may this trade hopefully help you guys advance into the playoffs this year."
DallasStars,3cv55i,sin_bin_pilgrim,4,Sat Jul 11 14:01:52 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone want to just believe Daley is garbage? Of course his defense regressed last year, but who's on the team didn't? It's a great move on Nill's part, but don't just write off Trevor like he was nothing at all positive to the team. The guy was dedicated like no other to the franchise and wanted to retire here. He handled a lot of community events with the kids especially after Ott was traded. I went to a Q&A he did at a bar in Dallas a few weeks after they missed the playoffs in 2012. Somebody asked who he was rooting for in the post season (games were on the bar t.v.'s), and he couldn't even look at the screens. He just stared at the floor and said ""I don't even care"". The guy gave our team everything he had. I'm excited to see what Sharp will bring, but Daley will at least be missed by me."
DallasStars,3cv55i,ShenaniganCity,10,Sat Jul 11 14:03:08 2015 UTC,Daley isn't garbage but his trade value is high for an aging dman so trade him now and get value from him. I love Dales and am sad to see him go.
DallasStars,3cv55i,sin_bin_pilgrim,3,Sat Jul 11 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, it's an incredibly smart move by Nill and it makes sense that he was traded. I just hate how so many people this season wanted to blame him for everything that was wrong with the team defensively. At least I know there's a second person that'll be bummed to see him wearing red next season."
DallasStars,3cv55i,twentynineotters,5,Sat Jul 11 02:28:59 2015 UTC,"He was the worst player on the team defensively. Whether it was Ruff's coaching or him just being over zealous his offensive posture left his partner hanging far too often last season. His offensive numbers don't even begin to cover what it led to in rushes the other way or failed keeps breaking a cycle. We're all sad to see him go, He's the last aside from Jamie from the Modano Era, but he had to go. His offensive d-play isn't what the team needs and his value will never be higher. On top of that Nill managed to get, according to Hawks fans, their top D Prospect. This trade is nothing but gold, even without taking into account all the positives of having Garbutt off the roster."
DallasStars,3cv55i,avodrocyelir,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"He wasn't only the worst dman on the Stars possession wise, he was the worst in the NHL."
DallasStars,3cv55i,KanyeExcuse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:42:55 2015 UTC,"Daley made every one of his partners worse.  Practically every advanced stat used to analyze defensive play showed he was the biggest liability out of the team.  He's not being picked out unfairly, he was worse than others.  The only way the Stars could shield him is by giving him an insane amount of offensive FO starts."

DallasStars,3cv55i,Austin_hohlt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:42:01 2015 UTC,I am ecstatic about this trade! But don't we really need some help on the blue line? Like I said I'm so happy with this trade! Does anyone else think we need to add to the defense aside from Niemi and now Stephen Johns? Who could we get?
DallasStars,3cv55i,starman32,3,Sat Jul 11 03:19:29 2015 UTC,We've got a lot of good young Dmen that I think will continue to develop and we'll see that next year. Also having a 1a-1b goaltending situation improves the defense to a certain extent as well

Across the starry sky flashed scenes from the star's 2015 post season.  For each scene he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand:   one belonging to him, and the other to Jim Nill.  When the draft flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand.  He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints.  He also noticed that it happened at the trade deadline and start of free agency.  This really bothered him and he questioned Nill about it:  ""Jim, you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way.  But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times of the post-season, there is only one set of footprints.  I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me.""  Jim Nill replied:  ""My son, my precious child, I love you and I would never leave you.  During your times of trial and suffering, I was dealing with Chicago to get mother fucking Patrick Sharp."""

But Jordie needs to have a really good start this season (barring any trade or move beforehand). We can't afford him only being decent later in the season. Two seasons of that is enough."

Seriously, our defensive prospect pool is not only deep, but also talented. We still have Honka and Lindell absolutely striving in their roles. I also like the fact that people that aren't Blackhawks fans on r/hockey are LITERALLY not even paying attention to the fact that we acquired their top fucking defensive prospect.

DallasStars,3cxtu6,scoutcjustice,3,Mon Jul 13 02:31:50 2015 UTC,"They're fine and they're getting better. Everybody always says we need to improve the defense, but they never suggest how (and they're usually the same people that mock other teams for giving multi-year contracts to 30+ year old defenders).  Kinda sucks that Nill hasn't been able to swing the big deal on a defenseman yet (Hamilton, Boychuck, Stralman... any of those three woulda been great adds), but I'm very happy he hasn't given big money to marginal free agents and instead trusted a deep prospect pool to develop. We're gonna have a competent blueline now and a really good one soon, and it's gonna be very cheap for a while.  So as long as Nill has enough flexibility in cap and moveable assets that he can pounce on a deal for a true impact defenseman if one is out there, I'm fine with his internal development plan."

Big, strong and a right-shot is pretty much exactly the sort of guy we could use patrolling our blueline."
DallasStars,3cvcry,scoutcjustice,8,Sat Jul 11 02:20:00 2015 UTC,"Solid pickups for Dallas.  Sharp is a volume shooter, that if you can feed him the puck he can get open for a shot, time and time again.  Really good at finding the backdoor seams.  His expirience will add to your already talented cast of forwards.  And keep in mind that he led the resurgence of the Hawks from early on.  He is a leader and has worn the A for years.  We needed to move him due to the cap, not becasue anyone wanted Sharp to leave Chicago.  He will be missed.  Johns is the real gem.  He is a solid prospect who will be good on your blue line for years to come.  Many Hawks fans though he would be a 5/6th D man this year.  Given some NHL expirience it is very reasonable to think he would move up to a 3/4 slot.  Treat them well."
DallasStars,3cvcry,injun_head,3,Sat Jul 11 03:33:49 2015 UTC,"I wish we could say the same for Garbutt. I highly doubt many will miss his play or thuggery on ice, off ice though he'll be missed for sure. Great presence and good with fans too.   Daley's got a very quick and accurate shot for a defenseman. If you utilize him on the powerplay and as a bottom pairing d-man you'll absolutely love him. Try to get him to play deep minutes and you'll loathe him. He's a great guy, been with the Stars for his career and is going to be sorely missed by all.   You're the umpteenth different Hawk's fan to talk up Johns. It seems Nill knew exactly what he was getting out of this trade. He's mentioned before his faith and willingness to develop the blueline from the ground up and picking up Johns only reaffirms his faith. It seems he's content with picking up hired guns to round out the forwards but he wants to build the franchise back up around Jamie, Tyler and the Defense.   In Nill We Trust."

DallasStars,3cv55k,dbarkcasa,3,Sat Jul 11 01:02:18 2015 UTC,We are shipping Garbutt and Daley to Chicago for Sharp + prospect.
DallasStars,3cvi4y,DoctorBreakfast,10,Sat Jul 11 03:02:41 2015 UTC,Benn-Seguin-Nichushkin Sharp-Spezza-Hemsky Roussel-Eakin-Eaves McKenzie-Fiddler-Ritchie Moen  Goligoski-Klingberg Nemeth-Demers Benn-Jokipakka Oleksiak    Niemi Lehtonen  Dat top-6 tho!
DallasStars,3cvi4y,scoutcjustice,3,Sat Jul 11 03:09:24 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I envisioned it in my head. Good work!
DallasStars,3cvi4y,TylerTheHutt,3,Sat Jul 11 03:16:05 2015 UTC,"You've got it. Also include Sceviour next to Moen as a utility player.  Goligoski isn't exactly a top line defenseman, and they've got a good amount of cap space left to sign one more player, so I wouldn't be surprised if they add Oduya, Franson, or another top veteran to pair with Klingberg."
DallasStars,3cvi4y,scoutcjustice,2,Sat Jul 11 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"Also include Sceviour next to Moen as a utility player.   Gah! How could I forget Scevs?!? Yeah, he probably goes as the other forward healthy scratch. Though maybe Ritchie stays in the AHL to get a little more seasoning in with top-line minutes and powerplay time.   Goligoski isn't exactly a top line defenseman   He totally is. By pretty much any metric you want to look at. He's not one of the elite top-pair defenders, but he's a solid one.   I wouldn't be surprised if they add Oduya, Franson, or another top veteran to pair with Klingberg.   I would be (and Goligoski is better than any of those guys... like... easily). I think Nill is serious when he talks about letting the impressive amount and talent of the youth develop on defense and not being active in free agency. Same way he did last season when most thought we'd be active in the free agent defense market. I think he's still open to trading for an impact defender, but I doubt he's keen on adding a middle-pair guy that's not a huge upgrade over what we have for the kind of money defensemen get in free agency (though admittedly, the free agent market has been much cheaper this year than in the past couple years, so I could be wrong)."
DallasStars,3cvi4y,TylerTheHutt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:53:21 2015 UTC,"I guess I worded it wrong Goligoski is, and has been, our best veteran player. Goligoski is definitely top line capable, and if this is the roster for the 2015-2016 lineup, he's the go-to guy for the top pairing. But, I feel like compared to other top defensemen across the league, he seems to better fit the mold of a second line defenseman.  I think a bigger veteran like Franson would also be beneficial for the development of our defenseman like Oleksiak and Nemeth (and now Johns as well), to show them how they're supposed to use their size."
DallasStars,3cvi4y,GTI-Mk6,3,Sat Jul 11 05:01:19 2015 UTC,I'm actually most excited for that 3rd line. That thing is going to be going 110% all the time.
DallasStars,3cvi4y,GTI-Mk6,2,Sat Jul 11 04:53:15 2015 UTC,"Wow I didn't realize that! Especially with his linemates, that is very impressive."
DallasStars,3cvi4y,yesBISONsey,2,Sat Jul 11 16:55:55 2015 UTC,"Other than how I thought Benn and Demers are always on a line together, this is awesome! Eaves literally fits on any line and the Ritchie-McKenzie line was fucking awesome when they were with Horcoff, it'll be just as good, if not better with Fiddler! Gahhhh IS IT OCTOBER YET!??!?"
DallasStars,3cvi4y,scoutcjustice,2,Sat Jul 11 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Other than how I thought Benn and Demers are always on a line together, this is awesome!   Yeah, that was actually one of the tough decisions to make. They were a really good pair last year. I was tempted to keep them together, but I kinda wanted to get a veteran on every pair so there wasn't an all young'un pair. I also think Nemeth-Demers makes for a pretty good shutdown second pair if Nemeth progresses the way we think he will."
DallasStars,3cvi4y,scoutcjustice,2,Sat Jul 11 05:00:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, I just realized this, but Nuke is a left-handed shot and Sharp is right-handed...Nuke could move to the 2nd line LW spot and Sharp could land the top line RW slot. That would provide a decent veteran-youngster balance in the top 6."
DallasStars,3cvi4y,Pilfdominy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:05:07 2015 UTC,I kinda figured Nuke was a candidate to move to left wing this summer before the trade. I'm less inclined to think that now.   Part of why Sharp is a great addition is that he's also a very good defensive forward in addition to his scoring ability. And that seems like something a line with Spezza and Hemsky on it could really use.
DallasStars,3cvi4y,GTI-Mk6,2,Sat Jul 11 07:31:40 2015 UTC,"Holy fucking shit. Not just that top 6, that top 12."
DallasStars,3cvi4y,Geoslug,2,Sat Jul 11 10:49:10 2015 UTC,Also curious- who gets Daley's A? I'd guess Spezza. Goligoski would be a good candidate but he is usually on the ice with Benn so no need.
DallasStars,3cvi4y,MickeyMoorrow,2,Sun Jul 12 02:09:38 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my guess since he has Captain experience with Ottawa.
DallasStars,3cuvrg,k1279,2,Fri Jul 10 23:40:06 2015 UTC,is Shore #61? I think that was him that had a pretty nice looking goal in the first minute or 2
DallasStars,3cuvrg,T-rom,2,Fri Jul 10 23:47:06 2015 UTC,61 is Shore.

But Strader is a super solid play-by-play guy. And solid and straightforward is kinda what we need, so that Razor's color commentary can be as eccentric as possible."
DallasStars,3cva33,scoutcjustice,2,Sat Jul 11 02:22:10 2015 UTC,"But Strader is a super solid play-by-play guy. And solid and straightforward is kinda what we need.   This is why I like Strader.  His calls are crisp, not overdone (looking at you, Emerick) and seemingly non-biased.  That could change slightly now that he has a home team, but that's normal."

DallasStars,3cqi75,ItsReallyOregano,6,Thu Jul 9 23:32:05 2015 UTC,"In what way is he a great fit when we already have 8 on the roster for next season? Benn, Daley, Demers, Goligoski, Jokipakka, Klingberg, Nemeth, Oleksiak ... I just can't see how we acquire a FA defenseman without a move in place for at least two that are currently on the roster, especially after signing Oleksiak."

DallasStars,3cqi75,Pilfdominy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:20:41 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion on it. Klingberg has all the tools to be a top pairing d-man, but no one on the left side has showed they can play with him to the level of forming a true top pair. Oduya could fit that perfectly, and Nill probably doesn't want to miss his chance to grab top-end talent if he doesn't have to overpay. If he's signed, that almost definitely means Daley is out. I also understand that we have way more left handed defensemen than right handed, but Honka isn't far from the jump, and he would even things out."
DallasStars,3cqi75,scoutcjustice,4,Fri Jul 10 02:10:42 2015 UTC,but no one on the left side has showed they can play with him to the level of forming a true top pair   Uh... Goligoski?  Who is pretty easily better than Oduya.

DallasStars,3cqi75,btharveyku08,3,Fri Jul 10 07:06:38 2015 UTC,"Easy to say like that, but Daley probably has rather minimal value right now, and the players they'll want are players it front office likely don't want to give up.   Like any of them or not, all of our current young NHL defenders have much more upside than Jordie (though admittedly perhaps not as much upbeard). Not saying you don't like dnt of them or anything like that, but this sub has been really divided on how we fix our defense problem, and everyone has an idea."
DallasStars,3cqi75,HooDooOperator,5,Fri Jul 10 12:35:43 2015 UTC,"ya think oduya would be a got fit?  Oh, do ya?  sorry had to.  i can't help but here is name in the form of a question."
DallasStars,3cqi75,EndsLikeShakespeare,2,Fri Jul 10 13:07:03 2015 UTC,"I think it would result in an upgrade, but I'm not sure who you cut, or if you can get a trade. A team might give up a mid to late round pick for Daley. I'd like to see some consistency in the pairs so they can learn and grow with eachother."
DallasStars,3cpuwd,StephasaurusRexy,2,Thu Jul 9 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"With these raw looks at the game I am actually getting fatigued by watching them do the work. Looks more draining at this level.

God I am out of shape..."
DallasStars,3coq5j,ItsReallyOregano,6,Thu Jul 9 15:35:29 2015 UTC,I think this is a make or break year for him. He really needs to show his game this year or I think he might get traded.
DallasStars,3coq5j,TheOnlyLlamaGod,8,Thu Jul 9 16:05:14 2015 UTC,"We now have 8 active defensemen on our roster. Meaning we will have to automatically have 2 scratched defesemen every game. Also, this gives us 0 room to see what Lindell and Honka could bring to the table until the 2016-2017 season. We also will not be able to send Oleksiak or Jokkipaka down to the AHL due to an inevitable waiver steal.    A trade on defense is absolutely certain."
DallasStars,3coq5j,Hungry_Ducks,5,Thu Jul 9 16:09:58 2015 UTC,Even if it is a two-way deal for Oleksiak he will still need to pass through waivers to go to Austin
DallasStars,3coq5j,Deltrozero,5,Thu Jul 9 16:19:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're aware, but one-way or two-way contracts don't say whether a player can move back and forth between the AHL and NHL. A one-way or two-way just says what kind of money they get. A one-way says that they get the same amount of money whether they're playing in the AHL or NHL. A two-way says the players gets two different salaries based on which league they're playing in. Generally, it's a lower salary in the AHL and a higher one in the NHL.   A player on a one-way can still go down to the AHL. They'll just get paid the same amount as they would in the NHL."
DallasStars,3coq5j,thestarsarebright,2,Thu Jul 9 17:45:37 2015 UTC,No problem! And I think we have the depth to cover defense and offense. It should be a good season! :)
DallasStars,3coq5j,thestarsarebright,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:47:12 2015 UTC,"With Oleksiak it won't matter, since due to his age and games played, he will have to go through waivers to go back and forth. It's either the NHL roster or a trade for him."

It sure would be nice to actually have room for them... Imagine both of them coming up and at least one of them performing near to what Klingberg did. That's a franchise changer... Have to make room for their possibilities, i believe."
DallasStars,3coq5j,Hungry_Ducks,2,Fri Jul 10 18:16:21 2015 UTC,For an opportunity they have to move 1-2 guys though. Currently there are 8 on the Dallas blue line
DallasStars,3coq5j,StephasaurusRexy,2,Fri Jul 10 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"Well, then we will need to let 2-3 of these defensemen get traded. I do see this happening."

I think they new Buffalo wanted a D prospect but at the time NJ was still sitting at 9 and they are not opposed to taking russians. Also NJ had a relatively weak group of forward prospects, so I assume Nill though they would take Nuke at 9.  Then the Vancouver trade happened and everybody an their mother though Vancouver traded up to grab Nuke but they didn't (yay). Going from 10 to 8 likely would have cost us out later second round pick and we might not have gotten Desro."

DallasStars,3cfr46,Dfine321,7,Tue Jul 7 16:13:27 2015 UTC,The light rail option really is best.
DallasStars,3cfr46,fillmont,4,Tue Jul 7 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear about the tickets, we have a similar deal here so I was hopeful. And thanks for the parking tip, I'll definitely check that out!"
DallasStars,3cfr46,nathanhardy,4,Tue Jul 7 16:45:18 2015 UTC,Parking pro tip from an ex-Dallasite. Park at the Hard Rock Cafe parking lot at Victory and Continental. Five bucks and just a couple of blocks from the arena. Super easy to get out of too.
DallasStars,3cfr46,ShenaniganCity,3,Tue Jul 7 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"To add to this, if a team like Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Montreal, Toronto, etc. comes to town, show up there at Hard Rock if you want a spot because it fills up fast. That also depends on the days of the week and sometimes you can luck out."
DallasStars,3cfr46,m2515,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"We always park another block away right under the bridge, and we're always to our cars before the traffic starts flowing. $3 or $5 depending on weekday vs weekend.

DallasStars,3cfr46,Rubb3rDucky,15,Wed Jul 8 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"Benn & Seguin are on of the leagues top duo's. Behind only Perry and Getzlaf IIRC (I actually think they were top last season as the ducks had some injuries) Everyone hates Rous, but if you watch him play you will learn to love him as he gives 110% every shift. Klingberg is our upcoming #1 Dman Garbutt went from being good and a good pest to being bad and a bad pest. Hopefully that will change. We have two #1 goalies now. This was mostly because we went some 0-9 in the back ups last year. If the backs could of even won  a couple we would of probably been in the playoffs People love to shit on this team, even some people here as well, but what most people don't realize is despite that bad D and horrible goal tending last year, we still finished with more points than the season before where we made the playoffs. ""Fuck the Central"" I avoid Minnesota vs Dallas GDT's as a lot of them are some salty mother fuckers Uhhmm....We finished 2nd in goals scored last year behind Tampa Bay by I think 1 goal overall? Could be wrong here. Oh oh oh....Nichuskin will be back this season. Missed the whole last season due to hip surgery. Speaking of. Benn, Daley, and Hemsky all got hip surgies this off season.  Speaking of Daley, he's great offensively, however that leaves bad things to happen and is a liability defensively. Mostly due to pinching and leaving his other D all by his lonesome. I personally would like to see him play a wing position in the upcoming pre-season games just to see how he does. Oleksiak is huge. He is nick named the big rig. However a lot of us are saddened that he doesn't use his body to become a shut down D guy.  Spezza I dont live in Dallas so I don't go to a lot of Dallas games, but I do live in Austin and hit up quite a bit Austin Stars games along with Stephoawijefefioeaj. Another user here. I think her and myself can pretty much answer any questions regarding the Austin stars and how players are doing from a fan perspective.   EDIT: Considering your a fan of CBJ, you can expect a yearly ""Jamie Benn schools the entire CBJ line on the ice for a goal""  EDIT2: I dont know why I keep calling them Austin Stars. I think I'm inadvertently combining my hockey league team with them. Texas Stars."

DallasStars,3cfr46,oringe,7,Tue Jul 7 20:33:08 2015 UTC,Jordie Benn is Jamie Benn's old brother and is often the butt of the joke. Jordie is our 7th Dman. He's known for his perplexed looks and listless play style that has been improving as of late.

DallasStars,3cg31s,TheOnlyLlamaGod,2,Tue Jul 7 19:12:11 2015 UTC,Morin has two more years so I think Morin.  I think Rallo would get A.  Who gets the other A?  At first I thought Ranford but not him if he goes up and down from Dallas.
DallasStars,3cg31s,StephasaurusRexy,2,Tue Jul 7 21:38:33 2015 UTC,"I'd guess Hulak or Dowling? Agree with Morin getting the C, since I think he had it when Fortunus was out last season."

DallasStars,3c89i4,Durbanpoisonyo,4,Sun Jul 5 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"As long as the understanding was that we would never give him a multi-year deal no matter how good a season he had, then I'd be okay with it.  But honestly, he's not really what I'd be looking for if we want another forward to fill out the top-6. I'd rather get a better two-way guy."
DallasStars,3c89i4,scoutcjustice,4,Sun Jul 5 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"i see no need to sign the guy when we have a lot of very young players that are projected as top 6ers. i mean, brett ritchie is teh same position and he's a monster and he's still probably not gonna be a top line guy because of nuke. we got the offense, need better defensive forwards and defensive D men."
DallasStars,3c89i4,hiddenstuff,3,Mon Jul 6 09:31:11 2015 UTC,"One year deal would be very low risk/high reward and there is cap room. They don't really need another scoring winger, but I can't see it hurting that much."
DallasStars,3c89i4,rws,3,Mon Jul 6 18:17:59 2015 UTC,One year deal might not be bad for a low price.  But remember what happened the last time they signed a guy that had a reputation for being a distraction in the locker room.
DallasStars,3c89i4,bashurst,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"Semin is one of the most lazy and arrogant chuckleheads in the NHL. We're better off without him. The one time I looked at his twitter feed, it was just ridiculous."
DallasStars,3c89i4,Kgaines,-3,Wed Jul 8 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude at all but no discussion needed.  EDIT: Amazing, we do not need more offense. Adding him would not make any sense. Don't care how cheap he might be, he would eat up a roster spot of someone who might actually work/scrap out there. Also this guy is on the decline in this league. The KHL is certainly eyeballing him and definitely willing to throw gobs of money at him. He would be able to make more money over there in a league of danglers and less physical contact and he would do well. Might as well bring Gonchar back because that's what you're going to get, laziness, unwillingness to work, a liability."
DallasStars,3c89i4,jeuno2,5,Sun Jul 5 21:16:57 2015 UTC,"The guy has a ridiculous shot and when he's on, he's on. Had an off year last year but is a proven player who is looking for a one year deal, so the liability is limited.   I think that if you find somebody to feed him the puck (Spezza) then he would put pucks in the back of the net. He's undervalued right now so we could get him very cheap and we have the cap space. What he was missing in Carolina is somebody who would pass him the puck and set him up, and he isn't the best at generating chances all on his own. So, yeah - there is a dicussion, not to be rude.   Just look at his stats and then compare it to a player that we have on a one year deal like, oh I don't know - Patrick Eaves  The numbers speak for themselves."
DallasStars,3c89i4,idontbelieveinbees,5,Sun Jul 5 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"Patrick Eaves is a known, affordable commodity. He's also had a year in the locker room and on the ice with all the players. He had great chemistry with Benn and Seguin. Also, Nichushkin is returning and is bound for the top two lines. Who would you bump to the third line for Semin? Hemsky? Ales would look even worse than he has already if he was playing third line minutes and situations."
DallasStars,3c89i4,T-rom,3,Sun Jul 5 22:27:04 2015 UTC,"I would leave the third spot on the second line open to competition. Semin would look great on our roster, his contract would be short and cheap - worst case scenario he ends up a scratch or on waivers. Best case he jumps back from his one slump year and puts up another 30-40 goals with Spezza. He has a talent for finding the back of the net that you can't teach. For a cheap rental he has a toooon of upside that makes it hard to ignore.  Edit: I need to find the video where NHL players discuss who has the best shot on the league and it was pretty unanimously Stamkos, Ovechkin, Semin, and Kessel."

DallasStars,3bttdk,idontbelieveinbees,2,Thu Jul 2 11:15:43 2015 UTC,"This one hurts a little, especially seeing as its only $1.75 mil which I thought we might be able to spare.   Just a thought...maybe we got our utility guys yesterday who fills this role (Eaves & McKenzie) for a bit cheaper...maybe this will allow us to go after someone like Cody Franson (or Oduya, although I'd take Franson first)..? I know he was a little out of our range, but with the signings of McKenzie and Eaves, maybe Nill was able to make some room for a bigger signing. Just spit-balling...  Gonna miss you Horcoff, all the best in Anaheim!"
DallasStars,3bttdk,Modano1509,2,Thu Jul 2 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"Shawn was solid while here, but he's too damn slow for our team. Great locker room presence, but overall we knew he wouldn't retire a Star"
DallasStars,3bttdk,Dallas_Stars_Fan,3,Thu Jul 2 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"Alright everyone, repeat after me: Fuck Horcoff.  But on a serious note: I just knew not retaining him would come to bite us in the ass. He's pulling no punches by signing not only in the conference, but to the hated Ducks."
DallasStars,3bttdk,Kitten_Hammer,3,Thu Jul 2 03:43:07 2015 UTC,Not sure if you're serious. But players signing with a rival team very rarely has anything to do with them not being re-signed with the team they played for. I very highly doubt that Horcoff went to the Ducks because us fans hate them.
DallasStars,3bttdk,pitcher_10,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:57:14 2015 UTC,"You say that now, but try whistling the same tune after Scorecoff wrenches victory from the jaws of defeat against us in a regular season match up while we're on a playoff push.  It will happen, and for once I will feel what those other team fans felt when it happened."
DallasStars,3bttdk,Kitten_Hammer,2,Fri Jul 3 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"If it happens it happens. Nothing you can do about it. It would be pretty foolish for an NHL player to not go to the team that offers the most money solely because that team is his former teams' rival. And retaining a player for the sole purpose of him not going to a rival, and possibly scoring a goal against our team, is a terrible business model, teams who did that would never win anything. It is a business after all, and sometimes the best business decision goes directly against what you emotionally want."
DallasStars,3bttdk,pitcher_10,3,Fri Jul 3 03:04:31 2015 UTC,I think you're completely misreading my tone. You're responding like I'm dead serious about everything I'm typing.

DallasStars,3bttdk,jalepenocheddar,3,Thu Jul 2 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"Ours wasn't not wanting to take a chance, it was just he was going to get pushed down the lineup and nearly out because we have so many ready prospects and he thinks he can still play more minutes than that. Anaheim might not have that problem."

Going to the Texas Stars games is also a great way to get into the team, because their younger players will be going right through there on their way to the NHL. I also recommend finding a good blog to follow, my favorite is Defending Big D.  The team's training camp is in Cedar Park in September, so if you want to see all of their players up close and probably get to meet some of them...that's a great time to do it."

You will scream ""Stars"" at the top of your lungs every time you hear the national anthem. The Bromance is real. Embrace it. Klingberg is our lord and savior.  You will learn to praise the glorious stache that is Jim Nill."

DallasStars,3bsp7n,Ccollin,5,Sat Jul 11 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, long time Stars fan living in Austin here, hope you make it down here!  The Idaho Steelheads feed into the Texas Stars, so if you know any of their roster/former players you'll recognize some of the players on the Texas squad.  In fact, the Texas head coach, Derek Laxdal, used to coach Idaho a few years ago. (Our previous head coach ""Whiteboard"" Willie Desjardins is now the head of the Vancouver Canucks)  As of last year, Texas is now officially owned by the Dallas Stars ownership group, so there is a very good synergy between the two clubs.  Recently this has meant more access down in Austin such as the training camp behind held here -- last year it was a preseason intra-squad scrimmage.  I believe they also run discounts for Dallas Stars tickets sometimes during the year.  It's about a 3-hour drive to Dallas.  About 70 of the regular season Dallas games are on NBCSN or Fox Southwest (or some sibling), which means you'll need cable to watch them live on TV.  The others are on TXA-21 which is a DFW-only station, and usually means you have to find a stream online."

The hockey scene is really fun here too -there are C-league pickup games going on almost every day at lunch, a few leagues at various levels, etc. Hell, Troy Vance showed up at our rink today at the end of our pickup game (didn't play though) - was going to skate afterward.   Austin is crazy expensive to rent in btw, so be prepared. Rental capacity is at 99% or something insane like that. Cool place, but definitely some issues."
DallasStars,3bsp7n,TheOnlyLlamaGod,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:41:33 2015 UTC,Thanks. That's cool about the hockey scene. We've actually been talking about living somewhere outside of Austin. I don't remember where though.

DallasStars,3bsp7n,Rubb3rDucky,2,Thu Jul 2 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I currently live in Austin.   most games are televised on fox sports south west so it's really easy to keep up to date. Alternatively, I use hockey streams.com. I wouldn't recommend nhl live as half the games are generally blacked out. the Austin Stars (Dallas' minor league team) play in Cedar park which is an outskirt city north west. Tickets are super cheap and it only takes me about 10-15 to get there from Parmer/i35. the hockey scene in terms of playing is surprisingly well. They have ice hockey and inline hockey teams that you can play on for funsies. I'm unsure about ice, but inline is $200 for 10 games + playoffs if you make it (goalies play for free). And is year round (4 sessions a year)    Let me know if you have any other questions."

There are fans, and they do go out from time to time, but this is cowboy/mavs/rangers territory right now. The lack of love for the stars is clear. We're a front running state and don't really follow teams that lose (sans the cowboys). Fortunately, the stars are on the brink of being a real playoff regular and we have a marketable guy in seguin, so there's been a noticeable pick up in interest. You may be getting here at the perfect time.  I really don't know how Austin reacts to the stars as I live in Dallas. On the one hand, the Texas stars live there. On the other, a very large portion of Austin prides itself on not being sports fans from my experience, other than the very obvious burnt orange longhorn lovers."

It is almost always a Saturday, with the Stars playing a matinee game around 1 and then the Mavs playing that same evening usually around 7. It happens at least once a season, and usually twice. If you are having to travel from Austin up to see them, may as well make it a 2 for. It's about roughly a 2 and a half hour drive Austin to Dallas, nothing unbearable!

D D    Free Agent Klingberg   Goligoski Nemeth   Benn Demers    Stars need to pick up a top veteran to pair with Klingberg. Goligoski is currently our best veteran defenseman, but shouldn't be top line. Trade Daley to a team that needs offensive defensemen, his defensive numbers are atrocious and detrimental to our team's defense. His offensive stats don't matter, we would have done just fine in scoring without him.  Work Oleksiak and Jokipakka into the third line.  (If we sign a big Defensive Defenseman like Franson, it might make sense to keep Goligoski and Klingberg together and pair him with Nemeth and on occasion, Oleksiak.)"

DallasStars,3bnjf5,jeuno2,2,Tue Jun 30 18:00:51 2015 UTC,Maybe Nill goes real low risk and gets Jackman. He would be signed real cheap of course but it would be someone that wouldn't be afraid of playing actual defense. I know the thoughts are on using the young guys but if we are adding 1 guy definitely this would be cheap as hell. Just sign him to a year. What you think?
DallasStars,3bnjf5,scoutcjustice,3,Tue Jun 30 19:56:29 2015 UTC,"I'd pass. I don't think he's a significant upgrade on the youth, and I'd rather see the youth getting development time."

How far away from Dallas is the closest non-Central division opponent? I'm guessing it's the Coyotes.  How far away from Chicago is the closest non-Central division opponent?  I'm guessing it's Detroit or Columbus or Toronto or Buffalo.  Whichever it is, it's closer to CHI than Phoenix is to us.  Now I'm not an expert on NHL scheduling,  but I imagine that there's some kind of rules in place about back-to-backs involving long travel or time zone changes.   I think Chicago is just well-located."
DallasStars,3bn74p,carys,2,Tue Jun 30 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"I considered geography being the major influence, but the fact that Minnesota and St. Louis are close by and yet have marked disadvantages in scheduling makes me think geographical considerations don't mean all that much."

DallasStars,3bnzg6,scoutcjustice,2,Tue Jun 30 20:08:00 2015 UTC,"You are correct. He'll be a free agent, so any team could spend whatever they wanted on him, but given his performance last season, he'll sign a much smaller deal in both dollars and length.  I still don't really want him though. He's a more talented but even more lazy/enigmatic/[derogatory Russian/Euro stereotype goes here] Hemsky. One Hemsky in the top-6 is enough."
DallasStars,3bnzg6,lapscrew,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:57:45 2015 UTC,Not really looking too much into it. I just figured it's worth looking at for the Stars if they could get him for cheap.

DallasStars,3bl5lq,Cadian,2,Tue Jun 30 10:14:29 2015 UTC,"We have enough competent young guys to give various people days off and cycle through everybody. You look at how many guys go through surgeries at season end and I think some of those should be avoidable. As much as we like to see Seguin and Benn every single game it's just not worth it in the long run for getting to the playoffs healthy and getting that Cup. Coaches know this too but the only problem is that players are adamant about playing every game they can. Hopefully we see some healthy scratches used wisely this year and we can just not worry about these back to backs. They may even help us if we healthy scratch strategically, keep winning, and give experience to the young dudes. Much of this scheduling crap is due to sharing arenas with basketball teams. None of the back to backs start until November, when the NBA starts. So we can just blame basketball. : )"
DallasStars,3bl5lq,jeuno2,2,Tue Jun 30 11:36:14 2015 UTC,"I would experiment with doing more of these healthy scratches for road trips. Keep a top player back home, say, during a two game road trip. Only 2 games (book ended by 2 home stands) for that player but that ends up being more like 7 days or more where they are in Big D resting up and doing casual skates to just stay loose. Then next road trip you do the next top player and just cycle around. It's not a bad idea considering with an injury a player might be gone for weeks or months at a time so it's not like they can say oh he's not contributing enough. I think each player should expect to play 74 games while sitting out 8 scattered games and maybe don't start this until December where they actually begin to need it. I don't know. I just think they do a little too much at times, especially with our travel schedule."

We just, we‚Äôre in a tough situation with our travel. We have as much travel as anybody in the league and back-to-back games.  He's absolutely right. Dallas traveled the second-most miles in the NHL and played 12 back-to-backs. Our schedule last year was pretty brutal and all of the second nights of the back-to-backs were almost always division games.   I hate to go tinfoil hat on it, but last year's schedulers had it out for us. If it's anything similar this year, I'd begin to give serious thought that the NHL is hoping not to have an up and coming team disrupt the bigger, traditional market guys in our division (CHI, STL, COL, MIN)."

No-name's steal the show every season, while big names fall by the wayside in dud seasons, and sometimes, or often, come back with a great season later. I remember reading about how the goalie position, according to long term stats, is very inconsistent and the stats don't always speak to the player's popularity and success over the course of their career.  My point is, I can easily see a team taking a chance on Lehtonen because of his past abilities and tendency for once-great goaltenders who are going through slumps to be great again."

DallasStars,3bk7hs,deObb,3,Mon Jun 29 22:07:05 2015 UTC,"I think we'd all love a slight tweak to the defense, but I wouldn't get your hopes up for anything too major. Free agency is weak and expensive this year and there aren't too many solid trade options we can realistically achieve.  With our 10M in cap room I expect us to sign or trade for another winger, as I don't think our young guys can truly compete in the top six yet. Getting Eaves back would cost us no more than 2M aav so that's what I expect to happen.  For those who love out there speculation, the door on Phaneuf isn't closed yet. Imagine something like Daley Oleksiak Hemsky Sceviour for Phaneuf Lupul?"
DallasStars,3bk7hs,Geoslug,3,Mon Jun 29 22:59:20 2015 UTC,A friend of mine mentioned moving Daley to wing. Haha
DallasStars,3bk7hs,MickeyMoorrow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:44:55 2015 UTC,We've been advocating for that here on this sub since halfway through last season.
DallasStars,3bk7hs,pitcher_10,2,Tue Jun 30 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"Really? I had no clue. I've been watching last season games again and he had his back turned on so many goals. If we don't make a deal involving him, I'd advocate the same. A D-man can play wing but not vice versa. It would be a fast, defensive minded forward."
DallasStars,3bk7hs,MickeyMoorrow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:12:39 2015 UTC,"I'd like for Eaves to stay with us a couple more years. And I wouldn't be opposed to Antoine Vermette hopping aboard, even though we have tons of depth at centre.  Picking up Mike Green, Marek Zidlicky, Christian Ehrhoff or Eric Brewer would be neato."
DallasStars,3bjalq,Mr_Romo,27,Mon Jun 29 18:09:19 2015 UTC,"I am happy. Niemi may not be a high-end starter, but he's a super consistent, solid starter.   It's an expensive fix, but it guarantees we have a starter-caliber goalie if Kari falters again. And we still have plenty of cap space, and the free agent class sucks this year so there's wasn't a whole lot to spend it on anyway. This is probably the most impactful 4.5 million we could spend in free agency."
DallasStars,3bjalq,scoutcjustice,13,Mon Jun 29 18:13:37 2015 UTC,"I'm happy.  After years of questionable backups, we may actually have a solid goaltending tandem. A signing like this probably would have enough to get us in the playoffs all those years that we missed by just a few games.  I think Kari will make a return to his old form and if they let Nemo take the pressure off him we're going to see better performance from them."
DallasStars,3bjalq,bashurst,24,Mon Jun 29 18:27:14 2015 UTC,I'm not writing the checks and they have the cap space. Fuck it.
DallasStars,3bjalq,Untjosh1,7,Mon Jun 29 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"My exact sentiment!  No more shitty Raycrofts, old Tim Thomas, Linbacks, we finally have a guy that actually played better than Kari. 5 points behind the Flames/9 behind the Peg. A competent backup and we might've been in the playoffs!"
DallasStars,3bjalq,Cravenater,7,Mon Jun 29 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"Someone brought it up in the other thread, but I love that term. This deal expires a year before Seguin gets paid and only a year after Benn does. One of Kari or Niemi (maybe even Dero?) might have established themselves as the clear cut #1 by then, so there is only really one year where it might put us up against the cap."
DallasStars,3bjalq,minigogo,7,Mon Jun 29 18:38:25 2015 UTC,"I am so happy that we can all at least breath a sigh of relief every single night. Hopefully. After such a longtime of less than stellar back-ups, this feels very good. And we still have some cap to make some updates in defence. Maybe pick up a top 4 defence, and trade for another (Daley and Oleksiak perhaps?). Our offence is solid. Our net minding is now patched. And with the leftover room for potential defence improvement? I like where we are."
DallasStars,3bjalq,MartinGlow,7,Mon Jun 29 19:20:52 2015 UTC,Not bad considering all it cost was a 7th rounder.
DallasStars,3bjalq,Splitz300,4,Mon Jun 29 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"I like it. Would have preferred someone like Talbot, but this works too. I hope this either lights a fire under Kari's ass or Niemi just takes the #1 job and we still have a good albeit overpaid backup in Lehtonen."
DallasStars,3bjalq,pitcher_10,3,Mon Jun 29 19:09:00 2015 UTC,"Kari and Niemi are both solid starters if they are at least ""on"" their game, not above or below. A 4.5M/yr ""safety net"" is an expensive haul. I would've liked to see Kari traded (probably salary retained) for a nice D-man, Niemi given the sole #1 position that way when the season rolls around he knows he's the new main guy in town."
DallasStars,3bjalq,Hungry_Ducks,2,Mon Jun 29 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately Kari would be at his lowest value ever right now, so he would be pretty hard to trade for a nice defenseman. He has a few more years left with a pretty substantial cap hit. I can't imagine any teams would be interested in an underperforming goalie getting overpaid."
DallasStars,3bjalq,Cravenater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"We would certainly have to retain salary or spiffy up the deal, if not buyout. But I would say there are teams out there desperate enough to gamble on grabbing Kari and potentially getting him back on his game."
DallasStars,3bjalq,Hungry_Ducks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:19:35 2015 UTC,"Who would trade a nice defeseman for Kari though honestly? It seems like you're better off keeping your good defenseman, then signing a UFA like Rammo etc. A buyout would work, but kind of defeats his point of wanting to trade Kari.  Kari is 39/40 on this list sorted by SV%. There are much cheaper/attractive options all around him.  36/40 in GAA."
DallasStars,3bjalq,Cravenater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"You mentioned my point. If a trade isnt there, if theres not a team wanting to take the risk, then we can buyout. You're completely right with me. It's just odd that we are going to have 4.5M and 6M sitting on the bench every single game with a baseball cap on."
DallasStars,3bjalq,Hungry_Ducks,2,Mon Jun 29 19:38:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but if that bench baseball cap gets us into the playoffs I think we'd all be pretty happy, especially when we are a fringe team that was only 5-7points out. (Calg had 97 and Peg had 99).  I mean i guess the only counter would be it seems even stranger to have 15 mill in cap space and not address the backup problem, especially when our owner is willing to spend. Why not improve if you can? It might not be orthodox, but it has some pretty great potential! (I'd also rather have Niemi than Kari in the playoffs)"
DallasStars,3bjalq,Cravenater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"I believe a ""new environment, team, system"" Niemi will completely outplay a ""hanging by the thread"" Kari. Would you agree? Why not just cut the cord, tell Niemi ""you're our guy. You are going to be the Dallas Star's #1 goalie"" and start fresh."
DallasStars,3bjalq,Hungry_Ducks,2,Mon Jun 29 19:46:57 2015 UTC,Because Kari has put up great numbers until this past season. I think it would be a disservice to what he's done behind crappier teams to not give him the chance to bounce back.
DallasStars,3bjalq,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"Also if Niemi goes down to injury, sickness, whatever, then we are screwed."
DallasStars,3bjalq,Cravenater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"He was statistically the worst all-around starting goalie last year. And really, you don't even have to look at numbers. Assuming you're a pretty devout fan and you watched every game; you, as well as I, saw that he mentally just didn't seem in it. It started with that first goal of the season from Keith that went right through him. Carried on during that red wings game where he was noticeably and mentally checked out. So yes, he was the worst starting goalie in all of the league last year. He hasn't got the job done in previous years and looked under mediocre in the playoffs. So how many years do we keep twidnling our thumbs saying ""ah, this year will be the year"" until we say ""lets just get some new blood in net?"""
DallasStars,3bjalq,Hungry_Ducks,2,Mon Jun 29 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"Enroth is not going to sign with us now. He wants a starting job. No way he signs to be a 1c, if that would ever be a possibility."
DallasStars,3bjalq,YouShould_FeelBad,2,Mon Jun 29 23:26:13 2015 UTC,"I'm happy. The more I think about it, the smarter it seems. Other teams gave up assets at the draft for unproven goalies. We gave up nothing but cap space and a 7th rounder, and we have two veteran goalies. There's a fair amount of risk involved, but it's an aggressive move to address our biggest need, which is what we wanted. I mean...if you believe the goaltending was a bigger problem than the defense, which I do."
DallasStars,3bjalq,shaky_but_nice,2,Tue Jun 30 01:02:54 2015 UTC,I'm happy. Maybe now we'll be able to win more than 3 games with a backup.
DallasStars,3bjalq,TheToeTag,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:54:48 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to be honest. 2 bonafide starting goalies, so now if one needs a rest or something, we can put the other in without feeling like chalking the night up to an automatic loss. It's an expensive fix, but we tried the cheap and easy way."
DallasStars,3bjalq,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:13:06 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say I chalked it up to an auto loss with Enroth in net.  He showed promise as a starter even I thought.
DallasStars,3bjalq,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"I think other teams took advantage of his size and we're not physical enough to move guys so he can see. But he only won a game he started after we were already out of it or that team was resting their best guys for the playoffs. When it mattered against Minnesota, Colorado, Tampa Bay, etc he failed big time."
DallasStars,3bjhoz,medicmarch,18,Mon Jun 29 18:59:45 2015 UTC,whispers - Jordie was actually one of the better possession players on the team last year.  runs away

DallasStars,3bjhoz,mightymattii,2,Mon Jun 29 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Go to defendingbigd and look at their most recent possession graph. He might have had a career year offensively, but his advanced stats make you cringe.  I don't know how many times i've watched a game and said, ""Daley tie up your man in front of the net"" and then two seconds later their guy taps in a rebound. Watch Nemeth aggressively annoy the shit out of people in front of the net, then watch Daley. Or the puck guys by you and you can't play it because he constantly stick lifts the crap out of you.  I'm not sure if you play, but guys like Daley are the best and easiest to score on. Guys like Nemeth make you cry every time you go back to the bench because you just got manhandled trying to get position."
DallasStars,3bjhoz,Cravenater,2,Tue Jun 30 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"If we're talking stats, I'd like to get an accurate count on how many times ""replay of Jordie Benn staring up at the rafters after fucking up"" was on our screens last season."
DallasStars,3bjhoz,minigogo,2,Mon Jun 29 23:04:53 2015 UTC,Yeah because after he was put on the same line as Demers he would pass it to him as quickly as possible since Demers is actually a competent d-man and can clear the zone.

DallasStars,3bjhoz,ComBendy,3,Mon Jun 29 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"We're paying 10m for average goaltending until proven otherwise.  Let's not kid ourselves, it's not anything close to an ideal situation."
DallasStars,3bjhoz,KanyeExcuse,4,Tue Jun 30 00:59:41 2015 UTC,The team from the all-star break on last year is probably a top-5 team in the league with average goaltending. It's definitely a step in the right direction.
DallasStars,3bjhoz,scoutcjustice,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:14:39 2015 UTC,"That's the problem.  Good teams are pretty consistent.  Bad teams aren't.  The Stars, in the recent last few years of mediocrity, have had plenty of stretches where they look like a really good team.  Then, they inevitably fade away."
DallasStars,3bjhoz,KanyeExcuse,3,Tue Jun 30 02:33:46 2015 UTC,"Well half a season is more than just a good stretch. And incosistency is a hallmark of youth, which the Stars have plenty of. That works itself out on its own."
DallasStars,3bjehc,bashurst,8,Mon Jun 29 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"I am not. He's gonna get way overpaid and is at the age where his game will probably start declining quickly.  Also, you could copy and paste my answer there for any free agent defenseman this year to be honest."
DallasStars,3bjehc,scoutcjustice,3,Mon Jun 29 18:44:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We also just had a season of defensive development, so why waste that on aging players."
DallasStars,3bjehc,Pilfdominy,3,Mon Jun 29 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"We've got 7 (8 if you count Oleksiak) NHL defensemen right now. I'd really like to see us pick someone new up, but I feel like it's going to have to come from a trade with probably Daley and Oleksiak going the other way. Which is a shame, because I think Paul Martin would have been a great fit."

DallasStars,3bh57j,Rubb3rDucky,3,Mon Jun 29 15:26:13 2015 UTC,I think that's about right. It's what I was thinking was going to happen.
DallasStars,3bh57j,thestarsarebright,2,Mon Jun 29 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"It's assuming he excels at the AHL level. If he is, I can see a few call ups going to him as well to gauge his nhl performance."

DallasStars,3bh57j,thestarsarebright,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:05:37 2015 UTC,He might stay in Russia until he's ready for the NHL. KHL guys (and their teams) often don't like coming over to play in a minor league.
DallasStars,3bh57j,scoutcjustice,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:00:36 2015 UTC,The one reason I could see him playing in the AHL for a year is to adjust to North American ice.

DallasStars,3bb1eq,ShittyForeplay,9,Sat Jun 27 14:38:35 2015 UTC,Is trading for negotiating rights better than a 3rd and 2016 7th for Lack? It seems like Carolina got the better of the goalie trades today imo
DallasStars,3bb1eq,maybe_its_bird,7,Sat Jun 27 14:50:14 2015 UTC,"I would agree, also probably rather would've given up what Esmonton did for Talbot."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,pitcher_10,3,Sat Jun 27 14:58:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'd rank the goalie deals 1. Edmonton, 2. Carolina, and 3. Stars. The only way this makes sense for us is if, first, we think we can get Niemi on a friendly-enough deal for us that will last until, second, either of Campbell or Desrosiers has developed enough to take his place. Or both of them, since we now have two goalies on the wrong side of 30."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:57:12 2015 UTC,I think it could be a good move for the cap. About $10 million in relief after a few years when it's time to pay up
DallasStars,3bb1eq,shaky_but_nice,0,Sun Jun 28 02:43:30 2015 UTC,Or we we can move Kari.
DallasStars,3bb1eq,HeisenbergKnocking80,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"Certainly more likely the later we get into his current deal (if he cannot return to past form), but his trade stock is arguably the lowest it's ever been right now."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think Nill must've been leaning this way.. and the pickup is to allow Lehtonen to at least bring his stock back up some so we don't sell super low.. its an insurance gamble.. :\  We've purchased time here imho. :)  (It does freak me out a little bit tho, we need defense yesterday.. I suppose Wed/Thurs/etc will tell)"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,JeffPeppers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think the only way we move for defense is if someone is willing to do a 2-for-1, since we have SO many young NHL defenders. Otherwise, I think they're planning on optimizing our current personnel and rolling with it."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,6,Mon Jun 29 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"Well, we didn't have a third to give, so there's that. And if we did, it would have been like 7 picks behind Carolina's. And you can't count out the notion that maybe some teams don't want to deal with us right now"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,shaky_but_nice,4,Sat Jun 27 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"depending on how much we were able to talk to him before the deal was made, trading for negotiating rights means we've already got a contract worked out"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,ARandomWhiteBoy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:35:30 2015 UTC,"also vancouver may be more willing to trade  to carolina instead of dallas since they are out of conference AND pretty bad, whereas dallas with a good goalie will be downright scary"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,adidaht,6,Sun Jun 28 02:13:06 2015 UTC,"I've watched Kari self destruct and lose a lot of confidence, especially after being streaky, letting up 5+ goal games this season. I've also seen him come thru with some incredible moments of dominance and shutout some of the leagues best teams. At time when our D was nowhere to be found I've seen Kari put the team on his shoulders. There was a lot of Kari hate this season and I was never on that train.  We were what with Lindback, like 0-9-1 at one point with games starting him? I feel like with a competent backup in Niemi, new goalie coaching him, and a better D core and team confidence heading into 2016, this could be Kari's bounceback year. He's never explicitly been TERRIBLE, although not in the ranks of Crawford/Price/Rinne/Scrivens, I feel like along with one of the best offenses in the league Kari could make this HIS season.  I can dream."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,Dynamics21,2,Sat Jun 27 20:30:44 2015 UTC,i agree completely. people should not give up on kari at all
DallasStars,3bb1eq,adidaht,5,Sun Jun 28 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting move. Nemo isn't as good as he once was, but this is very low risk. Either he signs cheap or he doesn't and it barely cost us anything.   Still think they should go after someone younger. Jones is just chilling in Boston now and Boston is gonna need to unload him or a goalie at some point. It'd be nice to get him."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,thestarsarebright,5,Sat Jun 27 14:58:48 2015 UTC,...this is very low risk. Either he signs cheap or he doesn't and it barely cost us anything.   Precisely why I'm good with this move.
DallasStars,3bb1eq,MaverickTTT,4,Sat Jun 27 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"We tried the cheap fixes in Lindback, Tim Thomas, Dan Ellis, Enroth, RAYCROFT, Bachman, and Nilstorp.   I'm alright with finally getting a proven guy, it's going to cost us, but hell we have tried to get a cheap option to help Kari and they ALL have sucked. (Tim obviously was good in his prime)."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,Cravenater,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:22:16 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with wanting a finally proven goalie, but if we can't move Kari, would you really want $10-12M tied up in our goal alone?"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,2,Sat Jun 27 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"It's either that or they go into next season with a very weak group in goal.  Until Kari is off the books, the Stars will have to pay up.  No way around that unless they can get lucky and another team with a good cap situation is desperate to trade for prove yet flawed goalie."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I think we'll have to either pay up in one of two ways unless Kari miraculously returns to form: 1) pay up by keeping him on the roster until the contract expires, or 2) pay up by eating some (or a lot) of his contract in a move.   Kind of why I think we needed to move for Talbot or Lack, since they could be controlled for cheaper than ""the going rate for a starting-caliber NHL goalie"", whatever that ends up being for Niemi. Sure, we have some cap space available, but this gives up a lot of that flexibility, so we'd better be fine with it for a few years."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"Those guys were in the driver's seat on their trades though.  Neither one may have been receptive of what Nill was offering or neither one wanted to commit to playing in Dallas past this season.  We'll probably never know on that end.  I would have loved to see a Talbot trade.  Not as big on Lack, but he cost peanuts so that would have been great too.  One thing in favor of Niemi is his experience which may be better for Kari and this team as a whole than another young backup."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,Cravenater,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"Sure, as a fan, we only know so much about the inner workings of these deals. I just cannot help but think we now might have to overpay for a goalie and if Niemi's agent knows anything, he should know that. As will any team at this point. There was a glut of goalies available for a while, but if we miss with Niemi, we're either standing pat or wading into a seller's market. Sounds like Nill really wanted Niemi out of all available goalies, though, see here's hoping it works out!"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:48:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly Nill said he wasn't going to be active during free agency so I don't see any harm to it. I'd rather spend the money and have the option of either goalie then extra unused cap space.  Now if we were to pursue some #1 Dman like Weber I'd like the money available, but at this point I don't see why not spend it if our owner is willing."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,mrmexico25,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, as long as Niemi's new deal isn't long enough to impair our ability to re-sign any of our upcoming FAs in the next few years, I guess I'd agree with that reasoning."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,Kitten_Hammer,7,Sun Jun 28 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"Amazing pick up for a 7th rounder.  Even if it doesn't pan out, it didn't cost jack shit."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,lockedge,5,Sat Jun 27 14:55:57 2015 UTC,"I like this move. I don't think the stars would blindly trade for Niemi if they weren't absolutely sure they could sign him. Antti will bring a fresh perspective to this team's goaltending.  It's easy to dismiss his years in San Jose, but people forget he was integral to Chicago's 2010 cup win.  Goalies talk to each other constantly, with Antti here to provide criticism, techniques, and successful playoff experience to Kari, coupled with our new Goalie Coach, I can ONLY see this as a positive move."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,TweetPoster,4,Sat Jun 27 17:58:32 2015 UTC,"Sharks fan here, I think this move could be pretty good for you all. He's a slightly above average goalie, and his only consistent weakness is that when he goes long stretches without facing a shot, he can lose his groove.  Last year our defense was an absolute dumpster fire, our coach wouldn't let anyone skate the damn puck out of the zone (leading to Brent Burns alone giving up around 1 or 2 odd man rushes a game), and some of the guys who were supposed to be our better 2-way forwards (Marleau, Wingels, Nieto, Desjardins) fell off a cliff in that respect. Our team was an absolute mess last year defensively, and he held down the fort (especially in the games Vlasic missed). Probably had his best year aside from his Vezina-contender one. If your defense can be even remotely more mobile and effective than San Jose's was across the last 2 seasons, and if your coach has a brain, he'll be fine. His play didn't suffer by splitting time with Stalock, I can't imagine it'd suffer splitting with Kari. And he's been pretty great for us in the playoffs, with the exception of when the team in front of him blows up spectacularly (but he's generally good at going into each game fresh and not carrying frustration or whatever from one game to the next...he's not really a streaky goalie for better or worse)."

DallasStars,3bb1eq,HeisenbergKnocking80,8,Sat Jun 27 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"From what I hear, he was EXTREMELY underappreciated in San Jose. Definitely not a bad goalie, honestly could be better, but is still a good netminder."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,scoutcjustice,3,Sat Jun 27 17:50:43 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good move, too. Not necessarily the piece that will lead to a cup, but with a Lehtonen/Niemi combo, it's very likely a team that can make the playoffs."

DallasStars,3bb1eq,YankeeBravo,3,Sat Jun 27 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"Him and Kari are pretty similar, except Niemi's game didn't fall off a cliff last season. Both guys are typically above average-to-good starters that occasionally have really good years.  Niemi is probably a little more consistent than Kari, though Kari may have a bit more upside."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,scoutcjustice,3,Sat Jun 27 18:57:06 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Kari has more upside.   Niemi actually has playoff success at very high competition levels.   Kari....not so much.
DallasStars,3bb1eq,minigogo,2,Sun Jun 28 00:56:27 2015 UTC,"that is not a fair comparison, as niemi also had a WAY BETTER TEAM in front of him."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,scoutcjustice,2,Sun Jun 28 02:19:05 2015 UTC,Kari has never had playoff success. That was the big question when he came from Atlanta.   He's had opportunities and has just never managed to deliver in the high pressure situations yet.
DallasStars,3bb1eq,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:44:37 2015 UTC,"Huh... I did not think we would be in the market for Niemi unless we moved Kari. Niemi isn't gonna be cheap, and that's gonna be a ton of money tied up in goaltending that may be good but almost certainly not spectacular."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,shaky_but_nice,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:00:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly after last season I would settle for ""good but almost certainly not spectacular."""
DallasStars,3bb1eq,Cravenater,2,Sat Jun 27 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"True. It just seems like you can get that for cheaper.  Though of all the goalies flying around the last couple days, Niemi is the only one that is a bonafide starter (and has backstopped a team to a cup)."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,StephasaurusRexy,-3,Sat Jun 27 20:05:44 2015 UTC,I am not happy with this at all. We could've had Lack for seemingly nothing. Yet another struggling goalie for Dallas which is just what we needed.
DallasStars,3bb1eq,shaky_but_nice,18,Sat Jun 27 14:53:14 2015 UTC,"You know that we're talking about actual humans doing the negotiation, right? Some of you act like this is a goddamn video game. Maybe we offered a better return for Lack and Vancouver decided they didn't want to make our team better...this obviously wasn't the Stars' first choice, but they had to do something to figure out the goalie situation"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,3,Sat Jun 27 16:16:37 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people don't realize some teams don't want to make teams they play against better.
DallasStars,3bb1eq,shaky_but_nice,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, Talbot was had for picks which we could've given too. My point is there were way better pieces to be had and we had the assets to purchase, but didn't."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,3,Sat Jun 27 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"I don't see Talbot or Jones or Lack or Lehner as being better pieces, just different options. We bought low so we can sell low if we have to and we kept those other assets. These are two veteran goalies that have been good before handling big workloads. One of them should be able to play well enough to finish their contract, and the other we can trade for nothing if we have to.   Best case scenario, both goalies play pretty well and we can trade one of them and actually receive assets in return."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,adidaht,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"You might not see them as better pieces, but they were pieces that we're actually controlled beyond the start of free-agency, which is the only reason we got Niemi for as cheap as we did.  And ""trade for nothing"" only works if someone actually wants a goalie competing for league-worst starter's statistics at an annual salary of $6M. Your proposal in the first paragraph suggests one of them playing well enough for us to keep, while the other gets shipped out because they don't improve. The kind of deal Kari has is not one that you can simply trade for nothing especially if the player isn't performing well. Something in line with a more realistic approach to that sort of trade would involve roughly negligible pieces in both directions + Kari + us eating some of his salary.  And sure, your final note might be the best-case, but the worst-case scenario is we fail to sign Niemi at all and Kari doesn't improve."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,Kitten_Hammer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"I like the chances of being able to unload one of those contracts if need be. Every year it seems that there are teams trying to get to the salary floor.  I think both goalies will improve, considering their situations. Kari's being that last year was his worst, Niemi's being that San Jose has lost some steam. Neither goalie has played for a great defensive team either.  If we don't sign Niemi, then I guess we see what's in free agency. I think the fact that we were willing to move the pick is a good sign though"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,btharveyku08,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"I think we could unload one, but as I suggested before, I think even if the deal just consisted of shipping off a goalie having a bad season (no other pieces moving), we'd have to eat some salary.  Here's hoping we get Niemi, though! Sounds like he was the one Nill wanted out of all available."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,scoutcjustice,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:53:16 2015 UTC,"talbot and lack went to absolutely terrible teams who would not threaten the teams they came from. dallas is a threat to everyone if we get good goalies or defense. this will definitely make people not want to trade with us. simply looking at the literal value someone was traded for does not mean ANY team could have just ""offered more"" and guaranteed to get that trade"
DallasStars,3bb1eq,medicmarch,5,Sun Jun 28 02:17:21 2015 UTC,"It may be the unpopular opinion, but I would rather have Niemi over Lack any day. Goalies are always overpraised in Canadian markets. Lack isn't half as talented as the media makes him appear."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,Cravenater,3,Sat Jun 27 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"Looks like the Canucks fans that came over here have to be pretty bitter about it, considering they thought a first-rounder+ was the going rate for Lack."
DallasStars,3bb1eq,medicmarch,4,Sat Jun 27 15:31:24 2015 UTC,Niemi isn't really struggling. He's bascially just a solid starting goaltender.

DallasStars,3bb1eq,StephasaurusRexy,0,Sun Jun 28 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure who down voted you, I think your fears are valid. Luck and Talbot were probably better choices. Hopefully between new coach and  Niemi  (if he signs) we will be okay. Dont forget we want to upgrade the D too."

DallasStars,3bbsaa,Timlightyear,5,Sat Jun 27 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing... Our defense is young but stacked full of players deserving of an NHL roster position. With no additions our lineup could look something like  Goligoski-Klingberg  Daley-Nemeth  Benn/Jokipakka-Demers  Adding anyone means one or more of those guys get scratched or sent back down to Texas to play. The only way I see us making an addition on D is if we can move Goligoski or Daley. Everyone speculates Daley leaving, but honestly I feel Goligoski is the more realistic option in terms of getting a solid return. Maybe he'll be in a package with a forward for a proven top pair D?"
DallasStars,3bbsaa,Geoslug,3,Sat Jun 27 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"With DBD's Seabrook comparison to Goose, I don't think he'll go anywhere. Someone has to see the stats that Daley pulled everyone down last year, and that we did our best work without him. Someone has to go though, as Oleksiak is waiver-eligible this season and someone will pick him up. We also have Lindell and Backman who are both going to be fighting for a spot, too."
DallasStars,3bbsaa,StephasaurusRexy,2,Sat Jun 27 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the talk is everyone being worthy of an NHL spot, but if we'd actually be making ourselves better defensively by shipping out Daley, why not see what we could get for him and rotate everyone else up? Addition-by-subtraction for someone worth at least a few draft picks (though maybe not high ones). And hell, those picks don't even have to be for this year, IMO.

YOU GUYS HE LIKES US: ""Gurianov said he knows a lot about the Stars and the city. Watched Nichushkin play with Benn and Seguin. Very excited to be picked by Stars.""  Also is speaking through a translator.   Info:    Stars Scouting Report And his interview after being drafted. Elite Prospect Page  Wiki Page Scouting Report from Red Line Scouting Report from TBL w/Video Scouting Report from CBJ Per Shapiro: ""From what I‚Äôve read & been told, Gurianov could be best natural scorer in the draft. Quick release on a hard shot, also has quick 1st step"""
DallasStars,3b97wx,thestarsarebright,9,Sat Jun 27 00:33:51 2015 UTC,"A highly skilled forward who intimidates with his speed and proficient puckhandling ability, Denis Guryanov may have one of the highest ceilings as a forward prospect for the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Very strong on his skates and uses his size to protect the puck well. Drives the net hard and knows where he will shoot before he is even in a position to do so. Possesses a heavy and accurate release on his shot, which he likes to get off near the faceoff dots; if he can't shoot from there, he will either dangle or bull his way through to the blue paint. While he is proactive and aware defensively, he still needs to work on consistency in his own end. All-in-all, a dynamic offensive threat that has room to grow defensively.   Sounds pretty great to me!"
DallasStars,3b97wx,djmastermind,5,Sat Jun 27 00:37:39 2015 UTC,Is this a Nuke insurance pick?
DallasStars,3b97wx,HeisenbergKnocking80,6,Sat Jun 27 01:08:28 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it the Stars are/have been high on him. There's a lot of people saying he's got the one of the best shots in the draft, but people were worried about 'the Russian factor.' Teams were worried he wouldn't come over to the NHL, but stay in the KHL. I actually think having a young Russian on the team makes it more likely for him to come to the NHL, so Nuke might actually be insurance for Guri to come over.   Edit: Basically the Stars are taking a risk. A lot of people didn't have him going until the late 20's because of the 'Russian factor,' so I guess we'll see. He's either gonna be a steal or stay in the KHL. Either way I don't think it hurts us too much because offense is not our issue, so he works out, then fantastic and if not then we move on."
DallasStars,3b97wx,thestarsarebright,5,Sat Jun 27 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"Just watched some footage.  Wow, that shot is intense.  Skates very well, too.  Can't believe I haven't heard of him."

DallasStars,3b97wx,thestarsarebright,-1,Sun Jun 28 01:49:56 2015 UTC,wow...what a fucking waste of a pick
DallasStars,3b97wx,robak69,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:03:14 2015 UTC,"Why is that a waste?   Most of the draft is going to be playing in a league other than the NHL with the exception of maybe the top 5 (really it'll probably only be McDavid and Eichel, if Eichel decides to go to the NHL next year and not back to college for another year).   Guri actually is in a good position because he gets to play against men instead of other kids is age, which means better competition. That should help his development tremendously. It's not a waste, but a good chance to watch our guy develop."

Crazy, but there aren't a lot of 18 year olds that instantly make it to the NHL, especially picking outside the top 5. The guy has an elite shot and good speed, except he has the classic ""Russian defending"" and a KHL contract. If he didn't want to play in the NHL, i'm surprised he flew to Florida to get drafted. Definitely an intriguing pick."
DallasStars,3b97wx,languidlurker,4,Sat Jun 27 01:49:39 2015 UTC,They must simply not get that the vast majority of draft picks in the NHL are not expected to be immediate-impact players. It's a lot closer to MLB in that regard than the NBA.
DallasStars,3b97wx,btharveyku08,3,Sat Jun 27 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"It's a lot closer to MLB in that regard than the NBA.   Actually, outside of the lottery, most NBA picks don't really make much impact either.  Hell, look at the Mavs.  Since drafting dirk, the Mavs have drafted a collection of players headlined by Jae Crowder and Devin Harris."
DallasStars,3b97wx,SeniorSophomore,2,Sat Jun 27 05:08:11 2015 UTC,"The point I was making is that the expectation with the vast majority of draft picks in hockey is that they will need further seasoning in the minors, a system that the NBA largely doesn't have. Hell, in baseball, even once-in-a-generation talents start in the minors before they're called up.  However, in the NBA, if you haven't made an impact by the time your rookie contract is up, you pretty much won't. Because there isn't a legitimate mechanism for bringing players along to develop them. Getting sent down to the NBA's D-League has a rather negative connotation."

DallasStars,3b97wx,Commandant1,4,Sat Jun 27 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was a little bit despondent before the pick because I thought we'd be taking Barzal or Connor. Nothing against those players, but the prospect of drafting them just didn't excite me.  But reading up on this kid and watching footage is exciting the hell out of me. This is exactly the kind of somewhat risky, potentially high-reward picks we need to be making at this point (only risk being the KHL's desire to do what it takes to keep their guys). It shows that we're comfortable with our organizational depth and can take a chance on a player with huge upside.  Considering that Dallas hasn't been able to pick in the top 10, this is a great way to try and get that elite talent that other teams pass on because of other reasons. They may not all hit, but the ones that do should make it worth it.   And now Nichushkin has a Russian buddy :) both of these guys playing together and even some friendly competition between them could just maximize what we get out of them. I love everything about this pick now."

We're gonna pick up a top line guy to pair with Klingberg either through free agency or through a trade.  Also lower priority, but still a possibility (especially after that reach for Sharp) is to get a more consistent, higher-caliber LW for the Spezza line. Eaves is good on that line which is why it's low priority, but he can fit pretty much anywhere on the team, and an upgrade to the LW on that line might increase scoring outside of Benn/Seguin.   Sceviour, Morin, Daley, Demers and Oleksiak are all possible trade bait, should Nill need to trade for either that top defenseman position, or a LW."

Nuke is a left shot, has played some LW before, and gives a (hopefully) legitimate offensive winger to pair with Spezza's playmaking skills. Moving him to LW seems to be the easiest fix to balance the lines.   If we re-sign Eaves, I could see him taking the top line RW spot, bumping Ritchie down to the 3rd line and making one of Garbutt or Sceviour expendable in trade for whatever.  The defense pretty much is what it was at the end of last season except hopefully Joki (or Oleksiak) improves enough to take a job from Jordie.  In net I feel like the price for a guy like Lack or Talbot has gone way too high, so the best option (as sad as it may be) is to sign some random backup goalie (I like Thomas Greiss) off the free agent scrap heap and hope Kari (with a new goalie coach) bounces back in a big way.  (btw OP, you got every single defensive pairing backwards in terms of side)"
DallasStars,3b9u12,scoutcjustice,2,Sat Jun 27 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best bet.  Also even if Eaves re-signs I'd rather just put him on the third or fourth line and scratch Sceviour.    I'd rather give Ritchie the chance to develop than watch Eaves try to ricochet Benn/Seguin's (and most painfully, Klingberg's) shots of his body toward the net.  I like Eaves just don't see him as a top 6 player.  At the end of the day John Klingberg is a hockey god and Jamie Benn is everything you could ask for in a hockey player. As long as Jordie Benn isn't in the top 6 I'm happy.  He's fine as a 7th d-man."

DallasStars,3b7vop,thestarsarebright,9,Fri Jun 26 18:00:52 2015 UTC,Hmmm. Do they want a Daley?
DallasStars,3b7vop,medicmarch,11,Fri Jun 26 18:02:30 2015 UTC,Can we trick them in to taking Daley is more like it
DallasStars,3b7vop,ComBendy,7,Fri Jun 26 19:00:20 2015 UTC,Please fucking don't.  Also stop chasing backup goalies with upside and get your head in the defenseman game. Calgary just got a 22 year old franchise defender for a song.
DallasStars,3b7vop,scoutcjustice,3,Fri Jun 26 19:36:54 2015 UTC,I fucking blame Boston for this. Why the fuck wouldn't they at least make a bid or make it a bit open to GMs they're open to moving dougie..  I wouldve gladly paid that price and more
DallasStars,3b7vop,ItsReallyOregano,4,Fri Jun 26 19:47:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with the reports coming out that some teams didn't know and Boston even turned down higher 1st rounders than 15, it seems less like Nill dawdling around and more like stupendous incompetence from Boston.  Cause 12th overall and 2 2nds (admittedly one in 2016 instead of both in 2015) is a no-brainer. And I would've gone much higher (Nuke and 12th to be honest)."
DallasStars,3b7vop,scoutcjustice,2,Fri Jun 26 19:50:51 2015 UTC,9 mill / year is what he's asking also . . .
DallasStars,3b7vop,Goregutz,4,Fri Jun 26 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'd rather we didn't give up a ton for him.  He's kind of unproven behind a defensively weak team, which we are."
DallasStars,3b7vop,OCJeriko,3,Fri Jun 26 18:57:08 2015 UTC,I hope it's not this years 1st round in that case. I'm so looking forward to the draft.
DallasStars,3b7vop,deObb,3,Fri Jun 26 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"Talbot if he's really positive about staying on, and a solid defenseman and I would give our first. I'm kind of in win-now mode."
DallasStars,3b7vop,StephasaurusRexy,3,Fri Jun 26 19:26:46 2015 UTC,Nill doesn't give up a pick in the top half of the draft for Talbot. He's much too smart for that.  Pls.
DallasStars,3b7vop,minigogo,2,Fri Jun 26 20:24:41 2015 UTC,SJ offered the first. Initially offered the 2 2nds too.

DallasStars,3b8pvf,Brolympia,3,Fri Jun 26 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"Lucic used to be really damn good a couple years ago.  He is just a bruising pile of muscle that also happens to score.  Recently though, he's gone from imposing and scoring to dirty(er) and not a lot of points.  If he reverts to his former self then yeah he's a guy you want on your team, otherwise he's just a guy who is more likely to injure someone on the opposing team.  That's just my take on him though, I'm sure someone else can give a better perspective than me."
DallasStars,3b8pvf,vtaenz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:09:07 2015 UTC,Milan Lucic? Is that a real question?
DallasStars,3b8pvf,ShazbotSimulator2012,2,Sat Jun 27 00:09:27 2015 UTC,If you're a Stars fan who doesn't watch a lot of other hockey it's a reasonable question. We play the Bruins twice a year at most.
DallasStars,3b55kd,stydolph,9,Fri Jun 26 01:33:30 2015 UTC,"Cool I guess. Though if the report that the Rangers turned down 2 second round picks is accurate, then I'm not that interested."
DallasStars,3b55kd,scoutcjustice,3,Fri Jun 26 01:39:26 2015 UTC,They probably want players. Ship a B or C prospect and a pick then. We have 8 or 9 dmen already
DallasStars,3b55kd,Web_Sheriff,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"Olesiak, Daley, and...something else?"
DallasStars,3b55kd,medicmarch,3,Fri Jun 26 04:01:28 2015 UTC,"The Rangers have been asking for a first. No way they would want any of our defenseman, especially with their defense being a huge strong suit."
DallasStars,3b55kd,Pilfdominy,2,Fri Jun 26 04:26:31 2015 UTC,If the Stars trade for Talbot Oleksiak will be in the package
DallasStars,3b55kd,Untjosh1,3,Fri Jun 26 06:22:18 2015 UTC,"Trading a first rounder should be completely out of the question with this years draft. I think Talbot could be a good NHL starter, but this could be one of those trades we look at 5 years from now and really regret it."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,medicmarch,7,Fri Jun 26 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"I don't blame Kari all the times for losses.  I place that squarely on the defense. I'm sorry, but, Daley just isn't a good enough defenseman. It's frustrating to watch it."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,Splitz300,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:19:32 2015 UTC,"Klingberg is the standard, the rest are inferior and continually make mistakes.  Positioning and mental hockey i.q. mistakes."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,svecer,7,Fri Jun 26 23:42:05 2015 UTC,"Goaltending. Kari has never won anything worthwhile in his career. He is talented, but he'll never be able to win that game when it really matters. But who fills that spot if not Lehtonen? We have no heir to the throne. Our D isn't terrible, just inexperienced. You put a plug back there that gives them confidence to play their game with a little swagger and not puckered butt holes, I think people would be pleasantly surprised with how talented our young D actually is."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,JoshP12285,5,Fri Jun 26 06:49:01 2015 UTC,"There is something to this. When the D is constantly on their tiptoes knowing that if any single shot gets through it might go in, they tend to play timidly rather than tenaciously. When you can trust that only the most dangerous shots have a chance, you can play a little tougher."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,CaptainBayouBilly,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:54:32 2015 UTC,"Kari is a lot like Turco for me.  Love him, but they only seem to do well in low pressure situations.  Every defense will have moments were the other team is beating them to the puck and getting good chances in the playoffs.  You aren't playing scrubs.  That's when you need the goalie to keep his calm, track the puck, trust his team to help him, keeps rebounds out of the middle of the ice and, the hardest part for Kari, stay in position.  Just like Turco, he loses focus at the most inopportune times like halfway through the third period in a close game."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,ItsReallyOregano,8,Sat Jun 27 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"Our defense is terrible imo. We have a lot of depth in youth on the back end, but apart from Klingberg I'm not sold or high on many others. Nemeth provides a fix to a necessity right now but I don't see him becoming much more than a #4(which there's nothing wrong with). We have a ton of youth and its encouraging(honka and lindell primarily), but we need to compete now.   We need a top pairing d man so fucking badly. And a young goalie and stuff. I unno"
DallasStars,3b5lrp,Pilfdominy,11,Fri Jun 26 04:09:58 2015 UTC,"Our goalie situation is pretty scary. We have one good prospect who hasn't played a single professional game, a prospect who still has hope almost solely because he went 10th overall, and an aging goalie who, even if he does bounce back, has a tendency to fall apart in some big games. I think with our young defense and a few minor moves to shore it up, we will be set for a while."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,R0GERTHEALIEN,3,Fri Jun 26 04:31:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah i agree. Kari really had a pretty rough season last year, so im really interested to see how he plays this season. Howd it end with enroths contract, i thought he was a nice addition to the team for the end of the season."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,scoutcjustice,5,Fri Jun 26 07:16:59 2015 UTC,I wasn't that concerned about goaltending because it seemed like a good market to pick up a goaltender or two.   But then Buffalo gave up a 1st for a goalie coming off a .906 save percentage and a severe concussion and now I'm all panicky...
DallasStars,3b5lrp,pitcher_10,8,Fri Jun 26 14:32:24 2015 UTC,"Our goalie situation. I just don't trust Kari anymore. Who knows he might have a bounce back year, but I sure as hell don't want to bet on that. Imo goaltending was the #1 reason we didn't make the playoffs last year. We really need to get a guy who can step up and take Kari's job. I don't think Enroth is that guy."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,grufftech,3,Fri Jun 26 05:58:07 2015 UTC,fffuuuccckkkk
DallasStars,3b5lrp,mrspistols,4,Fri Jun 26 14:21:12 2015 UTC,Biggest fear is that Nill isn't ballsy enough to trade for what we need. I believe in Nill but he taken caution in trading prospects which I don't think we can do this offseason.   Other worry is Benn's hips. The ortho group the Stars have is incredible and with the connection to the Hospital for Special Surgery they are receiving high level care. It's mainly how he recovers which has some risk attached.
DallasStars,3b5lrp,Sib_Sy,5,Fri Jun 26 19:54:52 2015 UTC,If he can come back as good as Klingberg did I'd be pretty happy.
DallasStars,3b5lrp,grufftech,3,Fri Jun 26 13:57:33 2015 UTC,"biggest fear  That we've squandered our Benn&Seguin power year by struggling with defense all last season.  going forward  That it could realistically take 2-3 more years before our defense is in its prime, and the magic years for our offense might then be gone."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,StephasaurusRexy,2,Fri Jun 26 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"Well, hopefully this year will be their power year since now Benn won't be playing injured and Seguin should hopefully be back to 100%"
DallasStars,3b5lrp,grufftech,2,Fri Jun 26 20:00:40 2015 UTC,that's what i'm hoping.   with an semblance of a defense it could be a mighty exciting year.
DallasStars,3b5lrp,StephasaurusRexy,2,Fri Jun 26 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"At first I didn't like it, but Talbot + Klein for our 1st is very tempting for me, and if they, Nuke, Hemsky and Nemeth are all healthy... it could be a good year."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,grufftech,2,Fri Jun 26 20:21:34 2015 UTC,I'd consider it...   I'm honestly not sure who we'd be able to take with our first that I'd really be happy with more than a AAA goalie.    Most 1st goalies aren't going to walk into the NHL and bolster the team's confidence this year.    that said i'm not playing the long game like Nill and our staff has to.  I just want the stars to stop giving away the games we score 7 points in.   Let's atleast not be the bottom for GAA.
DallasStars,3b5lrp,chenzo512,3,Fri Jun 26 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"I guess goaltending is a position that worries me as of now.  Another thing that comes to mind is having a situation like Nashville had this season. I love to see this team succeed in any manner but I wouldn't wanna be the team that kicks all sorts of ass in the regular season and then sees that early out route in the playoffs. Idk, all I'm saying is I want to make a deep run in the postseason. Prove we're to be taken seriously and ready for championship contention.  I'll take any success though. I love this team."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,StephasaurusRexy,3,Fri Jun 26 21:27:56 2015 UTC,To be fair they lost Weber which was a big loss and still took Chicago to 5 or 6 games
DallasStars,3b5lrp,chenzo512,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:38:24 2015 UTC,For sure. We also went six games with the Ducks in our last appearance but it was still so short. =/

DallasStars,3b5lrp,amgrulz,3,Fri Jun 26 12:51:02 2015 UTC,That they'll trade away my man-crush and break up the beautiful Bennguin bromance.
DallasStars,3b5lrp,Sib_Sy,9,Fri Jun 26 15:03:08 2015 UTC,I think your safe there. Bromance for at least 3 more years.
DallasStars,3b5lrp,StephasaurusRexy,5,Fri Jun 26 13:54:43 2015 UTC,Bromance for ever at least 3 more years.   FTFY
DallasStars,3b5lrp,Sib_Sy,5,Fri Jun 26 14:20:09 2015 UTC,I like the way you think. Thank you.
DallasStars,3b5lrp,StephasaurusRexy,4,Fri Jun 26 15:21:35 2015 UTC,"That we won't sacrifice some of the future to win now because with like 2-3 moves we are contenders, and Bennguin won't be young forever."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,DoctorBreakfast,2,Fri Jun 26 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"That we won't get deep in the postseason in the next four years. If we're gonna have any shot at the Cup, I think we have to have Spezza and probably Hemsky. I'm not sure if Spezza will be worth re-signing at the end of his contract. Plus if we end up trading Eakin and don't re-sign Spezza, we don't have a number 2 center."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm like ""OK, if we have to give our 1st for Talbot and Klein (top 4 D, cap friendly contract) let's do it"""
DallasStars,3b5lrp,Brolympia,2,Fri Jun 26 18:47:44 2015 UTC,Our goalie situation is a mess. Kari is insanely inconsistent.
DallasStars,3b5lrp,svecer,2,Fri Jun 26 20:18:22 2015 UTC,Roussel doesn't score.  Goalies are good at best.  Defense makes too many mental mistakes.  Defense is too scared to skate the puck and immediately tries to pass out of the D zone instead of skating it.  Consistency.

DallasStars,3b5lrp,CycloneTWF,2,Fri Jun 26 17:51:20 2015 UTC,"I pray to God if we don't get Enroth back next season we can get a reliable back up. I have faith in Nill, but I think our biggest concern right now is a backup tender."
DallasStars,3b5lrp,HooDooOperator,2,Fri Jun 26 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"holy shit i totally agree about roussel.  i love the guy, but he needs to actually beat someone up if hes gonna start fights with everyone!  talk about being french!  send that guy to a fighting gym or something."

DallasStars,3b3gbl,scoutcjustice,3,Thu Jun 25 21:46:56 2015 UTC,I was kinda warming up to the idea to be honest. Sharp would be a big upgrade for the top 6.
DallasStars,3b3gbl,Cravenater,3,Thu Jun 25 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe if we moved Hemsky, but a 33 year old Sharp with a cap hit of 5.5+ mill doesn't make me too excited.

DallasStars,3b2oiv,lngrshnk,2,Thu Jun 25 21:20:14 2015 UTC,Back to back wouldn't be so bad if they weren't mostly home-away or away-home.  I swear all of our games against Chicago last season were on the second night of those bastards.

I know we're not the only team affected but if you're giving a team 9-18 sets of B2B, atleast make it outside the division. Division games are so pivotal in the new format."

DallasStars,3b20ih,jeuno2,7,Thu Jun 25 09:30:18 2015 UTC,My reaction when I woke up this morning in the UK to see the cover
DallasStars,3b20ih,SmItH_197,6,Thu Jun 25 10:20:14 2015 UTC,"Next year's cover athletes will be Quenneville shaking hands with Pierre as they wink at each other as if to suggest some underhanded shit just went down. This really pisses me off. When I heard the vote was taken away I was excited because I thought, great, this will certainly help in not having a Hawk on the cover. If left to a vote it would have been a Hawk, but only one. Gotta hand it to EA. What better way to make sure one Hawk doesn't make the cover by simply putting two of them on there. Bravo EA you really stumped us and fucked us this time around. Curtains over our eyes, well done EA, well done."
DallasStars,3b20ih,Deavs,3,Thu Jun 25 11:12:14 2015 UTC,This is why I'll be getting the digital version.
DallasStars,3b20ih,ARandomWhiteBoy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:22:14 2015 UTC,"Considering the awful release of last year, this year's release is anticipated to be quite good or at least better (which shouldn't take much). My theory with last year's release is that EA decided with it being the first next gen release and having digital downloads coming to the forefront they could put most (pretty much all) of their selling points into the look/graphics and all around presentation of the game. Additionally, that is sad because the jerseys flap like a cat 2 hurricane is inbound and their faces look like The Incredibles, which in and of itself is quite alarming. Most of the awesome features and modes we've seen in the past were not included. EA found they could take the easy way out and rake in cash on a minimal effort once again, which certainly happened. It was a bare game that's for sure. Here you can see what is to be included in the upcoming game. I will wait until a little after release to get it but totally with you, getting digital version. Honestly if they put Keith on it I pretty much would have been kind of okay with it. Just seeing those two...on it...again...just felt wrong, like it was so intended to get that reaction. Keith was their best player, hence Conn Smythe. I am so ready for the days to come around again where the Hawks are in the cellar and I hope they stay there for a good long time. But as one evil dies another emerges. I just hope that evil is us."
DallasStars,3b2rp5,jkoho,17,Thu Jun 25 14:32:20 2015 UTC,I'm glad it's reported we're not in on it anymore.  We don't need another winger like Sharp.  Address the D or the G plz!
DallasStars,3b2rp5,ComBendy,10,Thu Jun 25 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"In the French mini-documentary about Roussel, Nill said that Rous is a big part of the stars future. I'm thinking Nill heard what the hawks wanted and said ""nah"""
DallasStars,3b2rp5,trapthemandkillthem,8,Thu Jun 25 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"This is not true according to a Stars source, as reported by Heika"
DallasStars,3b2rp5,ojodelmono,6,Thu Jun 25 15:11:42 2015 UTC,So that'd be beat writer with an inside source vs beat writer with an inside source.  Wonder where the truth lies with that one... I'm guessing the Stars kicked the tires on Sharp and backed out quickly.
DallasStars,3b2rp5,scoutcjustice,11,Thu Jun 25 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't want Rous to leave, but can you imagine what the blackhawks fans would think if they saw this guy all the time?"

DallasStars,3b2rp5,jeuno2,5,Thu Jun 25 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"Looks like they want Roussel, our 1st round draft pick, and a prospect. What are your thoughts? I would hate to see Roussel go. I just bought his jersey last season."
DallasStars,3b2rp5,scoutcjustice,4,Thu Jun 25 14:36:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't add a 1st to Roussel. But for a 2nd and an expendable prospect I'd be on board with that deal.

DallasStars,3b2rp5,SmItH_197,4,Thu Jun 25 17:23:26 2015 UTC,No Stars need more grit. Roussel is one of the few gritty ones. Torn about this. I don't like the idea of reloading Chicago's gun. I want to bury them not help them live.
DallasStars,3b2rp5,jeuno2,2,Thu Jun 25 15:16:49 2015 UTC,I would of thought that the hawks would of wanted to trade Sharp outside the division
DallasStars,3b2rp5,Brolympia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"He's 33 at 6 mil-ish. Maybe that's exactly what they want. They get  Rous, a 1st, and whatever else. They get a future when we get an aged winger. It would be sabotaging us from within, glad we are looking away from that BS. I am not against Sharp. He is awesome but just saying for what is asked for in return."
DallasStars,3b2rp5,qpHalcy0n,2,Thu Jun 25 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"No, not like this. Not my Frenchman in a red jersey."
DallasStars,3b2rp5,sgtkibble,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:16:06 2015 UTC,I think this is just a case of any tiny blurb of a trade involving a huge name player (like Sharp) is going to spread like wildfire if any amount of anything leaks out. It's entirely possible that the Stars are just kicking the tires on one or more Blackhawks players just to gauge what the price is and the interest....then it leaks out and turns into some huge thing.

DallasStars,3b2sq6,scoutcjustice,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:08:17 2015 UTC,"i don't think potential franchise superstars are available right now.   Maybe. But it doesn't necessarily have to be superstar. If, for instance, San Jose goes full derp with their ""rebuild"" and puts Marc-Edouard Vlasic on the block, there's not a prospect in the organization that would be off-limits for me.   why is that? **specifically Honka and Ully.   Ully is more a personal bias thing. I really like him. But also because I think he's got huge potential but as a former 5th rounder he's probably not going to fetch a return worth that potential.  Honka is just a stud. Admittedly, Klingberg might make him a bit redundant, but Honka has huge upside and is one of our only right shot D prospects of note."

I don't really have a problem with voters taking age/experience into account (though it woulda been nice if they'd done it for Modano back in the day). What Ekblad did this year is definitely more impressive than what Klingberg did.  That said, the bit that really does get under my skin is the general assumption that Ekblad was better defensively when the stats just don't bear that out at all. There's just this ""well he's bigger and Canadian so he has to be better defensively than this smaller skilled Euro, right?"" mindset, and there's nothing you can do to show people how wrong they are."

DallasStars,3awjd3,scoutcjustice,6,Wed Jun 24 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree I think Sharp would fit into our system well with his speed and skating ability, and give Spezza a legitimate offensive partner on his line.

I'd rather spend a year slotting say, McKenzie in for the long-term. Figuring out if Val is best with Jamie/Tyler or if he can get some chemistry and scoring going with Spezza. Bouncing a hopefully healthy-and-signed-with-us Eaves around the lines as we need him.  If we're going to spend, I'd rather do it on a young d-man that can work with (preferably Klingberg) the rest of our D-corps."
DallasStars,3awjd3,carys,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:00:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like McKenzie didn't really impress Nill last season and so he's going to be a primary trade chip. For that ""Needs of the Central Division"" thing the NHL did, they actually listed our greatest need as depth scoring, as outside of Benn/Seguin we only had 1 player break 60 points."
DallasStars,3awjd3,StephasaurusRexy,2,Thu Jun 25 03:49:53 2015 UTC,"Chicago had three break 60, their highest at 66 points.  Pittsburgh had the two you'd expect.  Anaheim only had Getzlaf at 70.  Tampa Bay had four, with Stamkos and Johnson topping at 72.  Rangers had two, with Nash at 69.  Montreal had three, but two of them had exactly 60.  I guess I just don't see the need to go out spending when we compare favorably top most offenses in the league. Perhaps a better scorer to go with Spezza, but Hemsky or Nuke could easily fit that mold with a healthy year in the system."

I say if we can get him for less than 6.3 for 2-3 years (until benn on seguin contracts are up - IIRC they're up at the same time), I'm reluctantly OK with this. Otherwise, I would vote no."
DallasStars,3awjd3,Rubb3rDucky,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:30:46 2015 UTC,"Well he's already under contract at 5.9 AAV for 2 more years, which has him coming off the books when Benn is up for a new deal. So that part is okay (though the money maybe could be better spent elsewhere).  I'd be more worried about what we'd have to trade for him."

If anything it's just the red on it that blemishes it. Picture that red being white and it would be supreme imo. Not a photoshopper myself. Can anyone change the red to white?

DallasStars,3avfhx,Untjosh1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"That's a little harsh. Guerin may not have lived up to the expectations of that contract (though I think the blame for that lies more with management for offering it), but he was still a good player while here. Played at a 60 point pace, had a 34 goal season. Racked up a ton of PIMs.  Though I admit, not re-signing Hull so they could throw stupid money at Guerin was a dumb move. But again, that's not really on Guerin."

DallasStars,3apsq6,Slacker52,7,Mon Jun 22 23:33:48 2015 UTC,With ya there. Some in our fan base are very impatient. He's not going to ruin our team by playing on the third pair or rotating in as the 7th D-man. I think he has more potential value to our team than any other at this point.
DallasStars,3apsq6,shaky_but_nice,3,Tue Jun 23 01:52:12 2015 UTC,"I'm just worried he has Chara syndrome, where it'll take till he's 26 or so to get it figured out, but turn into a beast.

In a dream scenario I'd like to see him play a 60 game season with the Oilers played out in 60 minutes before my eyes. A game per minute. That would give us a much better idea.

My love of Hockey has not subisded in the off season and I had the pleasure of attending this match driving over 6 hours from my town in country WA to Perth. While it wasn't an NHL quality game it was still an amazing experience watching decent quality hockey in a sold out stadium (around 20,000 people) in my home state of Western Australia.  The game ended with Canada 6 to USA 3 but it was close enough to remain exciting till the last minute of play. I saw some threads in /r/hockey complaining about the earlier games in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane that the players weren't giving 100% and the crowd wasn't in to it, im not sure whether that's true for those games, but in Perth the Atmosphere was amazing, almost as good as a AFL game, majority of fans where barracking for Canada but it was all very exciting stuff. And while you could see the players not being fully into the physical side of the game the way the Canadian players celebrated should so you they where pretty keen to win.   I had an amazing time and I hope to get to Dallas next season for a couple games"

When I watch basketball I feel like the (ex- üò™)Top Gear guys when they watched it in the US  Edit: also if you're familiar with Football Manager there's a game called Eastside Hockey Manager that's basically the same thing but for hockey and you can download the real rosters for it. However, it won't really help with learning the rules as much, more so with learning how the management and coaching works for a team."
DallasStars,3aiz4j,BryanW94,5,Sat Jun 20 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"Welcome to being a Dallas Stars fan!!! They are a great team to root for. For your first game, go to a busy game (as mentioned by /u/ROAR_BEAR) so that you get the true spirit of Star's fans.  Be sure to yell ""Stars"" during the national anthem.    For more about the game, I would try to learn the rules by using this lovely video rulebook from the NHL.  It has descriptions, penalty minutes, and a video of each infraction.  It's how I've introduced others to hockey.  Otherwise, welcome and enjoy the ride!!!"
DallasStars,3aiz4j,ChiDaddy123,6,Sat Jun 20 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I always love the atmosphere at pro games during national anthem so that tip is cool!   Oh man, so many videos haha. This is great because I've heard quite a few calls that I had no clue about so now I can learn about those calls - thanks! Hopefully I'll be able to follow a game better after watching those.  And thank you, I look forward to it!"
DallasStars,3aiz4j,ChiDaddy123,2,Sat Jun 20 19:09:00 2015 UTC,No problem! The NHL video rulebook is pretty awesome!
DallasStars,3aiz4j,Timlightyear,2,Sat Jun 20 20:42:58 2015 UTC,I personally don't like to tell them to tell stars when someone has never been to a game so i can see their surprised expression.
DallasStars,3aiz4j,Timlightyear,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:52:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on how good a friend I take to their first game... If they are a really good friend, I don't warn em, and I'm pretty damned loud... Muahahaha."

DallasStars,3aiz4j,ROAR_BEAR,4,Sun Jun 21 22:26:18 2015 UTC,"My first recommendation is to watch the Dallas Stars 1999 championship DVD. It's on YouTube. I'm on mobile and I don't really know how to use reddit very well, but I'll put the link at the bottom. That will get you familiar with the success the team has had.  As far as the current lineup, it's probably going to change quite a bit over the course of the summer. I would pay attention to what moves are made during the offseason.  Key players to know are:  Jamie Benn - he's the captain and he won the Art Ross trophy this year (trophy for most points {goals and assists} in a regular season.)  Tyler Seguin - he is the ""star"" player. He's a bad ass. Him and Jamie are bros and they play extremely well together. You'll have fun watching them I promise.   Val Nichuskin - he's big, he's fast and he's also a bad ass. He was injured for a lot of the year, but if he's healthy he is dangerous.  Kari Lehtonen - Kari is our current starting goalie. He had a really bad year and a lot of people are thinking he'll be traded. I personally don't want him to be traded because I think he just needs to be pulled out of the slump he's in.  John Klingberg - we just signed him to a 7 year deal. He is our up and coming D man. Watch for a lot of bad assery coming from him.  The main thing I'll say about our team is that we are young, fast, score a lot of goals, but have lacking defense and goaltending. I think we have a good shot at the cup within the next several years. A lot of potential, but moves need to be made for better defense and/or better goaltending if Kari doesn't work out.   If you go to a game, my advice is to go to a Stars vs ducks game. They are one of our rivals and it's always fun to yell at Corey Perry for being a little baby back bitch.   I'm not the most knowledgable, but I hope I was helpful.  Here is the video from YouTube:  http://youtu.be/K-P6PHgFNBs  Good luck and sorry if my formatting, spelling, was garbage!"
DallasStars,3aiz4j,SeniorSophomore,2,Sat Jun 20 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"Sweet, I'm definitely gonna watch that! I downloaded the Stars app and I'll continuously check this subreddit to stay informed on what's happening with the Stars. Thank you for the info about the lineup, sounds like Dallas has a great group.    it's always fun to yell at Corey Perry for being a little baby back bitch.   Haha! Sounds like a plan, I'll look into that game - thank you!   I'm not the most knowledgable, but I hope I was helpful.   Any Stars fan's insight is helpful to me!"
DallasStars,3aiz4j,shaky_but_nice,2,Sat Jun 20 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"One other thing that's slightly unrelated- If you have an Instagram you should follow the stars, NHL, and any players you like. I follow Val Nichuskin and he posts unintentionally funny, extremely Russian pictures that make me laugh every time. Just a thought."

DallasStars,3aiz4j,StephasaurusRexy,3,Sat Jun 20 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"First, download the Stars app it gives you all the news and stories going on with the Stars. As far as rules go, you ought to be able to go in YouTube and find some videos explaining the rules better for you. I'd imagine they have something on there that explains the rules. I know they do for cricket, so they ought to for hockey also.   As for what games to go to, if you're looking for cheap then any games against Edmonton or Buffalo or low interest teams like that are generally cheaper. Games against Chicago, Anaheim, or San Jose are always a lot of fun though since they're in our division and big rivals. Those are typically a bit more expensive though."
DallasStars,3aiz4j,StephasaurusRexy,3,Sat Jun 20 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"The app by DSE Hockey Club? and alright, I'll see if I can find a nice guide on YouTube. Do you know when tickets usually go on sale? I'll probably make my decision once I see the prices, haha."
DallasStars,3aiz4j,NormGreen,2,Sat Jun 20 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"Anaheim and San Jose are in our conference but they're pacific division rather than central  (for obvious reasons). I'm not trying to be a dick, I just wanted to point it out so that OP wouldn't get confused about things."
DallasStars,3aiz4j,StephasaurusRexy,3,Sat Jun 20 18:54:11 2015 UTC,You're right. I muffed that up.

Everyone here is friendly but it's a bit empty at the moment as nothing BIG is happening at the moment.

DallasStars,3aiz4j,jeuno2,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"Welcome!   Watch some of the fun games from last season to learn the players, lines, stuff like that. The best ones are the 4/11 Jamie Benn Art Ross 4-point night, the October game vs the Penguins, the 11/22 game vs the Kings, the 2-0 win vs the Kings also in November, and the shutout against the Blackhawks in March.   As for games to attend, opening night is really fun, and New Year's Eve (nearly always against the Coyotes) is a blast (there's also the Dallas NYE party right outside the arena). The last game of the season is also pretty good (especially this past year!). There's also the Alumni game night where Stars alums play against the Blues' Alumni team, so you can see 2 hockey games for the price of 1.   Watch some games from this season and pay close attention to the penalties/whistles when they are called, see if you can figure out why the whistle was blown.    The 4 most confusing rules are:   The puck must be the first thing to enter the offensive zone (not any part of the skater is allowed) - this is being offside.  A player cannot shoot the puck from their zone (the one their goalie is in) across the red line and past the other team's goal line unless they are killing a penalty. Otherwise that is icing.   You cannot have 6 skaters on the ice at any time unless you pull your goalie, or you are doing a line change and the player coming to the bench is within 6 feet of the bench and does not interfere with the play in any way (and the puck hitting his skate will count). Otherwise that's a too many men (or too much man) penalty.  If a player in his zone shoots the puck out over the glass into the crowd, that is a delay of game penalty.    If you have rule specific questions I'm happy to answer any."
DallasStars,3aiz4j,trex20,2,Sat Jun 20 21:28:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, lots of good info thank you. I'll try to find those game streams (any idea where I could watch them?). And I didn't know the Stars played on NYE, that's awesome. If the prices are right, I'd like to go to the games you mentioned. They all sound amazing. and yes! those were some of the calls I heard that confused me. Thank you again for your post and I'll keep your offer in mind if I ever come across something I'm not able to figure out w/ Hockey."
DallasStars,3aewkg,ItsReallyOregano,17,Fri Jun 19 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"I really liked Horcoff, sad to see him go. It makes sense why they let him go though."
DallasStars,3aewkg,pitcher_10,12,Fri Jun 19 16:40:38 2015 UTC,As much as I like Horcoff this makes sense. Fidds can be the ole goat for the youngsters to pal around with. Everything else falls into place.
DallasStars,3aewkg,medicmarch,4,Fri Jun 19 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, #38 is the man, if we could sign the fidz for a 4 year contract i'll be content.  The guy just brings a lot of awesomeness to the team:  he is an old man on a young team relatively, and he can haul ass up and down the ice and can egg out a penalty at will with ease.  Despite the more obvious talent on the team, watching Fiddler play is a joy and I'd like to keep him on the team for a long time"
DallasStars,3aewkg,jonnyvice,4,Sat Jun 20 00:28:24 2015 UTC,Wish we could get Horcoff for really cheap. He goes well with Ritchie.
DallasStars,3aewkg,Brolympia,3,Sat Jun 20 07:07:01 2015 UTC,"But where would he go? Already you have (probably) Benn-Seguin-Eaves(?), Nuke-Spezza-Hemsky, Roussel-Eakin-Ritchie, McKenzie-Fiddler-Sceviour and Moen."
DallasStars,3aewkg,StephasaurusRexy,3,Fri Jun 19 23:03:02 2015 UTC,"Very appreciative for what Horcoff has done for this team. Hard worker and he was a great mentor to Ritchie and McKenzie when they were line-mates this year, bummer he had to leave but business is business"
DallasStars,3aewkg,ARandomWhiteBoy,5,Sat Jun 20 00:49:46 2015 UTC,Poor Glennie could never stay healthy
DallasStars,3aewkg,kromaey,4,Sat Jun 20 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, either the guy doesn't put enough time in the gym or he's just too fragile for professional hockey"
DallasStars,3aewkg,Dallas_Stars_Fan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:12:16 2015 UTC,It's his own fault. Lots of off ice issues over the years.
DallasStars,3aewkg,Untjosh1,-5,Fri Jun 19 16:19:02 2015 UTC,Sounds like that enforcer defenseman we had last season that would always be injured because of stupid shit he did in games.
DallasStars,3aewkg,Atheist101,-10,Tue Jun 23 06:08:35 2015 UTC,Finally got rid of Borecoff :P
DallasStars,3aewkg,Atheist101,9,Fri Jun 19 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"He served his purpose, passing insight on to the younglings. Nill always like to have a veteran presence sprinkled about. His showing in the playoffs was quite good actually. The man wanted to win, you could certainly tell. However much similar to Morrow's decline, Horcoff played through a more physical era that now has culminated in his current level of speed and production. Just too slow for the game now. I'd say resign him for dirt cheap but there are just too many other players chomping at the bit to play with Benn and Seguin and make a name for themselves. I am not upset he is leaving but I certainly didn't hate the man. Gonchar on the other hand..."
DallasStars,3aewkg,jeuno2,5,Fri Jun 19 15:56:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agree with this. He did his duty and guided the young kids and was great in the playoff series with the ducks, but I don't think he is worth the 5.5 mil (iirc) that he's getting anymore. Sad to see him go, but this opens up doors for younger and faster guys to come up or sign someone that's less expensive."
DallasStars,3afu3m,ItsReallyOregano,7,Fri Jun 19 20:09:16 2015 UTC,"Eaves, baby come back. The rest of you, I'm OK with losing."
DallasStars,3afu3m,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:34:37 2015 UTC,Enroth as well?  The Ewok did well for us in the few games he got last season
DallasStars,3afu3m,rpgFANATIC,5,Fri Jun 19 21:27:44 2015 UTC,"Well, sometimes he did. He only won against teams resting their best guys, and only won after we were out of the race. But when we were still in it playing vs Minnesota, Colorado, Tampa Bay (I don't remember all his starts) we just needed competent goaltending and he either melted down or they took advantage of his size."
DallasStars,3afu3m,StephasaurusRexy,3,Fri Jun 19 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"Not surprising that they made an offer to Eaves. I'd like to see him back if he's still cheap. Surely he's gotta have better luck injury-wise next year, right?"
DallasStars,3afu3m,scoutcjustice,2,Fri Jun 19 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"I wish we could keep Gaunce, I really like him on our blue line in the AHL."
DallasStars,3afu3m,TheOnlyLlamaGod,2,Fri Jun 19 22:53:49 2015 UTC,"Still a chance he could sign a contract with the Texas Stars, I suppose. I don't imagine he'll be getting an NHL contract"
DallasStars,3afu3m,shaky_but_nice,4,Fri Jun 19 23:08:37 2015 UTC,I think Gaunce is looking for a team where he'd be higher on the depth chart for a call up to the NHL. He's down the list with the Stars.
DallasStars,3afu3m,k1279,3,Sat Jun 20 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I went back and read the press release and that's exactly what Nill said. Makes sense, hope he gets a call-up sometime"
DallasStars,3afu3m,shaky_but_nice,4,Sat Jun 20 04:55:03 2015 UTC,I want to see McKenzie up but Im not as sold on Oleksak yet.
DallasStars,3ad5xc,rafael_araewwwjo,15,Fri Jun 19 03:42:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think I would do this trade.   We don't really want Phaneuf, as he isn't suited to the type of minutes/role we're like for him. His contract is also not one I think we'd really like to take on, especially with needing to resign Benn and Seguin in the next few years.   JVR would be nice but we're not lacking for offense.  Bernier is pretty good and I would like him.   We already have no 3rd this year, or next, and our second is with Ottawa (we have Detroit's 2nd instead) so I don't know how much a late round pick really interests me.   I think adding our first this season and our second next is too expensive since only one of the things you're sending is really something we need/want (Bernier).    Additionally, Desrosiers I would take off the table, as we are very thin on our goaltending depth, and he is the best-looking goalie prospect in our entire system.  Lehtonen has had 1 bad season so I don't know if I'm ready to sell him after he's been solid for us for years.   Overall, I'd say it's way too expensive to us for the return we'd get. Now, 12OA+Daley for Bernier+JVR I'd consider but that might be too lopsided in our favor.   Edit: I'd especially not do this if Bernier could walk before he even plays for the team (can't agree on a qualifying offer for whatever reason)."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,StephasaurusRexy,2,Fri Jun 19 04:44:09 2015 UTC,"we actually could really use a good 2nd line winger, Spezza needs some better players than ales hemsky and we lost the cole train."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,Fox_and_Otter,3,Fri Jun 19 14:53:13 2015 UTC,"We do, but not for this much. Like I said, I'm interested in JVR and Bernier, but not at the price mentioned. We did fine after we traded Cole, and Hemsky should be better as he was injured last season.  1st + Daley (+Sceviour if we have to) for Bernier + JVR and I'm all for it. The rest? no thank you."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not as optimistic about Hemsky, Though i think Spezza is amazing, I really think we need to give him some better players to play off of. And I hope we get a LW before the season starts so they have time to build up some chemistry."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,Fox_and_Otter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:20:24 2015 UTC,Do none of y'all think a healthy Nuke could fill this void next season?
DallasStars,3ad5xc,AustinAustin,3,Fri Jun 19 15:34:34 2015 UTC,I figured Nuke would slot in at 1RW unless we resign Eaves who will either be 1RW or 2LW. Nuke could be 2LW also I guess.
DallasStars,3ad5xc,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:49:56 2015 UTC,I really hope we resign Eaves. He played well on the first line and I think it'd be good to allow Nuke to ease back in on the second line under the wing of Spezza instead of having the pressure of playing with Jamie and Tyler. I also think Nuke's big body will help more on the second line since we already have Jamie to police the ice with the first unit.
DallasStars,3ad5xc,AustinAustin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:00:38 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly
DallasStars,3ad5xc,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:23:13 2015 UTC,nuke will probably play 1st line RW
DallasStars,3ad5xc,Fox_and_Otter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:13:55 2015 UTC,If we resign Eaves you think they'll still put Nuke up there with them despite the chemistry Eaves developed last season?
DallasStars,3ad5xc,AustinAustin,2,Fri Jun 19 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"I think they'll try it, but Eaves fit so well with them (they all benefited from being together instead of the RW benefiting from being with Bennguin) that I would totally love to put Nuke on 2LW to be the power forward with the skill guys."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,StephasaurusRexy,6,Fri Jun 19 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna kinda break this down into chunks to get at the value. I see it like this:  JVR for 12th OA, Hemsky  Phaneuf, late round pick for Daley, Lehtonen, ""B-level"" prospect  Bernier for 2nd, Desrosier  You know, I think I do it. I like all of those deals individually. I wouldn't retain on Kari though, not with the Stars taking all of Phaneuf's deal."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,scoutcjustice,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:19:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much how I had it yeah, although looking at it again, I might not want to give up the late round pick in the Phaneuf deal. I actually think he would do really well with you guys and he gets killed by the media/fans in Toronto a bit undeservedly. Him and Goligoski would be really good together.   as far as the prospect  goes I don't really know what the Stars prospects are like after Honka, Ritchie, Campbell, Oleksiak (and I would imagine they would be untouchable).   Jason Dickinson intrigues me a little looking at his stats. Know anything more about him?"
DallasStars,3ad5xc,scoutcjustice,3,Fri Jun 19 05:11:28 2015 UTC,"Dickinson is A-level. Kids got all the tools to be a high-end, two-way 2nd line LW/C. One of those high ceiling and high floor guys. I wouldn't be willing to trade him as part of that deal. I'd rather part with Oleksiak to be honest.   Though I'd try to talk you down to maybe one of the Mattias'. Mattias Janmark-Nylen is a high IQ two-way center that's been doing very well in Europe. Mattias Backman is a solid all around defenseman with good size who's also been doing very well in Europe. Both guys are getting close to NHL ready."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,lineenil,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:42:38 2015 UTC,"We're really close on a deal here for sure. I would probably pull the trigger...those three guys and we're an official contender. I like the way you're thinking, seems like an even trade."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,L3DFac3,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"That's a HUGE trade with a lot of pieces moving.  But I'd say yes to this, I'm not sure the Leafs would find it all that attractive, but possibly.  It's a pretty well thought out deal if you break down the pieces like  /u/scoutcjustice did. And he's right, with Phanuef's contract I don't see the Stars retaining any of Lehtonen's salary.  I think a change of scenery could give Phaneuf and JVR a bit an uptick in production so it could benefit the Stars tremendously."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,HeisenbergKnocking80,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:38:47 2015 UTC,"I do it but instead of Desrosiers, I would add another late round pic, and not retaining Kari's contract if we're taking on Phaneuf's load."
DallasStars,3ad5xc,btharveyku08,2,Sat Jun 20 06:56:24 2015 UTC,"I'd like that more as well, but Desrosiers is showing potential to be worth far more than a late-round pic."

Maybe make the center stripe Victory green on the black jersey... give it a little pop to make it stand out from all the black.

Did I miss the part where this girl went to the police, or did she go straight to the civil trial to try and force a settlement?  I'm dubious over anyone who would go straight for getting paid, but there is always the possibility that a prosecutor refused to pursue a case due to lack of evidence.  But I'm also confused about why someone would suffer through 6 years of sexual harassment and then figure it would be fine to move in with the family for 2 weeks to get them settled in.

DallasStars,3aarjx,SexyOmlet,7,Thu Jun 18 16:21:30 2015 UTC,Why Florida?
DallasStars,3aarjx,StephasaurusRexy,9,Thu Jun 18 16:21:25 2015 UTC,Lu is 36 and Montoya is 30 - they are going to need someone else there soon.
DallasStars,3aarjx,SexyOmlet,3,Thu Jun 18 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but Lu is doing fine now and it just creates another controversy. A younger guy that may not be ready yet would be better in my mind."
DallasStars,3aarjx,StephasaurusRexy,2,Thu Jun 18 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"Well they might get rid of Montoya if they got Talbot, until Lu starts to decline"
DallasStars,3aarjx,SexyOmlet,2,Thu Jun 18 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured. I meant that because talbot would want to be a starter next year."

Kind of a shame but if he wants to leave so be it.  I think Talbot could be a good move but I don't know if we will be able to swipe him over some of the other teams that have expressed interest."
DallasStars,3aarjx,jeuno2,8,Thu Jun 18 17:49:35 2015 UTC,"Not Enroth. He doesn't want to be in Dallas. There are a number of reasons he shouldn't be in Dallas. He doesn't want to be a backup, has that weird beef with Ruff, and is just a fucking midget. I am sorry for actual tiny people out, no offense, I just don't want the guy simply based on size. I want these boys to win. I want them to knock of Chicago. I don't see Enroth being that guy. He's going to get shredded. He's got some talent and some athleticism, granted, but it's just not enough, not if you measure what he is against what we need in net to beat the best. Kari is far better imo."
DallasStars,3aarjx,yesBISONsey,3,Thu Jun 18 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"Size doesn't matter, the guy was pretty solid in the last however many games he was in for during the season. If we had him as a ""backup"" from the start, things may have been different for us"
DallasStars,3aarjx,StephasaurusRexy,4,Thu Jun 18 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he was only solid after it didn't matter for us anymore.  He couldn't steal a game we desperately needed when we were still hanging on to the playoff hunt."
DallasStars,3aarjx,scoutcjustice,7,Thu Jun 18 19:39:24 2015 UTC,He couldn't steal a game we desperately needed when we were still hanging on to the playoff hunt.   Not even steal a game. Just provide competent goaltending. The team outside of the net was pretty much kicking everybody's ass at that point.  I'm not totally opposed to Enroth coming back. We've certainly seen Dallas go through worse backups recently. But I'd rather look elsewhere and I don't get the love because he had a small streak of good goaltending at the end of the season when it didn't matter.
DallasStars,3aarjx,StephasaurusRexy,6,Thu Jun 18 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"Just provide competent goaltending. The team outside of the net was pretty much kicking everybody's ass at that point   Exactly. He won against a defeated San Jose, and the rest were playoff teams resting their best guys.   I think there's a lot of love because he finally came in and won a game he started, and we forgot what that was like."
DallasStars,3aarjx,StephasaurusRexy,3,Thu Jun 18 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"I like Enroth, but I want someone bigger as his size leaves too many vulnerabilities that won't necessarily be there with a larger goalie. With our smaller defense, we need a goalie who can see around and over screens as our D might not be able to clear them out. He also has a losing record and I would prefer a goalie with a winning record.   And, while he did win at the end, he did it when it didn't matter anymore, and had a spectacular meltdown in Minnesota that cost us a very important game."
DallasStars,3aarjx,chenzo512,3,Thu Jun 18 19:41:43 2015 UTC,After watching this dude have a BEAST season last year with the Rangers I'm all for seeing what we could do to get him.

DallasStars,3a8m4l,StephasaurusRexy,3,Thu Jun 18 03:56:53 2015 UTC,"I think factoring in that Lack played 41 games with a .921 and a 2.45 GAA, he would probably be pretty costly since his cap hit is only $850k. I can't see the Canucks letting that sweet deal walk away"
DallasStars,3a8m4l,Cravenater,5,Thu Jun 18 13:00:22 2015 UTC,"Well, their GM has said Miller is staying, so they're trading either Markstrom (who was phenomenal in the AHL) or Lack (1 year left on contract). Been chatting with a Canuck who said Daley or Oleksiak would be tempting for them if we did a straight up trade which is encouraging, since we haven't re-signed Oleksiak."
DallasStars,3a8m4l,StephasaurusRexy,3,Thu Jun 18 14:11:45 2015 UTC,"i'd love to get a better back up, but giving up some of our prime trading pieces like Daley (i'd love for him to be moved) and Oleksiak seems like kind of a waste. I guess if Lack takes a considerable amount of starts from Lehtonen I could see doing that, but otherwise i'd rather sign Enroth or another UFA like Karri Ramo and package Daley/Oleksiak/Hemsky + more for a defensive defenseman upgrade."
DallasStars,3a8m4l,Cravenater,2,Thu Jun 18 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"Well I would hope Lack would start to take over for Lehtonen, especially if he starts putting up the wrong kind of numbers again. Lack is young enough to where he could be The Guy for us until Campbell or Desrosiers is ready. I'd be OK with trading Oleksiak for that, especially if we can resign Lack"
DallasStars,3a8m4l,StephasaurusRexy,3,Thu Jun 18 15:10:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind signing him depending  on the term he wants.

DallasStars,3a77dk,DaRabidMonkey,5,Wed Jun 17 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"Assuming the reports are accurate, this gives the Stars 7 signed defensemen (Goligoski, Klingberg, Demers, Daley, Jokipakka, Benn and now Nemeth) for a combined cap hit of $16.86 mil.  Only Oleksiak needs to be re-signed, and he'll probably get a two-way deal."

DallasStars,3a77dk,aggieinoz,4,Wed Jun 17 22:36:35 2015 UTC,"We definitely need a young dominant core to pan out. It's pretty much impossible nowadays to trade for good defensemen. You gotta draft and develop your own. Klingberg certainly has worked out, and I think Nemeth should, as long as his wrist is all right. End-of-season Nemeth didn't look at solid as beginning-of-season Nemeth, which was certainly expected."

DallasStars,3a8nfr,bashurst,5,Thu Jun 18 02:31:19 2015 UTC,No thanks. If he actually did take a 4.5 million per for 3 year deal I'd be totally fine with that. But there's no way that's all he gets.   Brooks Orpik was about half a year younger during free agency last year (and also not as good) and he ended up with 5.5 by 5. I'd say that's the conservative price for Martin. Zero way I want the Stars to spend that kinda cash and term on a 34 year old defenseman.

DallasStars,3a8euj,Fox_and_Otter,3,Fri Jun 19 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"Well, our problem last year wasn't scoring goals :)  Part of what makes them great is their chemistry with each other. Spezza centering Benn really only worked well for one game (Benn's first hat trick @ STL) but didn't seem to do much in the rest while Seguin was out, and we don't have another great LW or RW to set up Seguin. Plus I'd rather them grow together since they are the true future of this team.   Spezza's no slouch in the scoring department, and seems to be a bit more confident in his role coming into this season so I don't really think he's going to be off the board as much as he was last season (where he still had over 60 points)"

DallasStars,3a3zxl,ineedatossout,5,Wed Jun 17 15:17:46 2015 UTC,Worse than Jordie?  Basically he is getting paid a couple 100k more than Jordie.  I upvoted you but I disagree with every point you made.
DallasStars,3a3zxl,grufftech,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:42:58 2015 UTC,I disagree with every point you made.     Isn't that what down votes are for?   /s
DallasStars,3a3zxl,Mortecai,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:39:42 2015 UTC,"I've played defense my whole life and I couldn't count the times that Joki was out of position. Jordie is no saviour, his mistakes are more blatant, but he definitely does SOME things right, puts him just a hair above Joki tbh."
DallasStars,3a3zxl,ineedatossout,3,Wed Jun 17 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  But Dallas while the bottom of the barrel, was not the worst D in the NHL.  There were a handful that were complete jokes Buffalo and Edmonton come to mind."
DallasStars,3a3zxl,Mortecai,2,Wed Jun 17 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"Actually you're right. Our defense did seem to pick up once Nemeth returned and Daley got hurt (oddly enough). Also, our goaltending left a lot to be desired. Still, considering we were the second highest scoring team in the league our defense still needs to improve. Like I said I hope Joki gets better (he's young so he totally could)."
DallasStars,3a5v73,Brolympia,7,Wed Jun 17 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"What arguments would you make   Good luck defending against both Benn/Seguin, and Spezza/Kane"
DallasStars,3a5v73,MacerV,3,Wed Jun 17 14:37:11 2015 UTC,"The only thing i've noticed is it usually really helps to have a guy that grinds along the boards in the dirty areas. For example Kunitz with Crosby or Burrows with the Sedins. Even Backes with Oshie/Perron/Steen.  Benn throws the body and is very physical, which makes him pretty damn special since he's kind of a sniper/power forward/ playmaking hybrid. Toews is very similar in that he does it all.  I think that line would be pretty potent, but it always helps to have a guy that wins the puck/gets dirty in the corners.  With the pace that the game is today I think Segs/Kane would be pretty fun to watch, but adding a guy like Benn really rounds out that line."
DallasStars,3a5v73,Cravenater,3,Wed Jun 17 16:56:41 2015 UTC,I think its pretty cool that you have dreams like that.  My dreams are usually weird nonsense.  I'd like to have some hockey/Dallas Stars dreams that I could talk about with other fans.
DallasStars,3a5v73,ineedatossout,2,Wed Jun 17 19:02:05 2015 UTC,No such thing.

DallasStars,3a2tri,DougSR,6,Tue Jun 16 20:03:01 2015 UTC,"They did last year. They offered 4 different packages with 10 games each. Some were either weekends only, weekdays, some mixes. You cannot pick the games yourself, so each package usually has some great big name opponents and some games when they know it will be hard to sell out. I think it was 700 per package."
DallasStars,3a2tri,gosha1988,2,Tue Jun 16 20:10:20 2015 UTC,Great. Thanks for that. It's a little steep but probably about as much as I spent on seats last season.
DallasStars,3a2tri,unique-name-9035768,2,Tue Jun 16 20:22:07 2015 UTC,They usually do a 10/12 game plan. I remember at one time they even did a 12+1 plan where you buy 12 games and get a 13th (non premium game) free.
DallasStars,3a2tri,fillmont,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:21:13 2015 UTC,Ok. Cool.
DallasStars,3a2tri,YankeeBravo,2,Tue Jun 16 22:29:20 2015 UTC,"I just got a call from a sales rep yesterday about ten game packages. So it is definitely happening this year.  Edit: details won't be released until later this month when the schedule is released. For super upper terrace seats I'm being quoted tickets at 15, 27, or 43 dollars per seat. Nosebleeds basically, but hard to argue 15 bucks a ticket."
DallasStars,3a2tri,fillmont,3,Tue Jun 16 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"The AAC doesn't really have ""nosebleeds"", though.   Sitting in the lower bowl's fun every now and then, but the upper bowl is really the best view to watch the flow of the game and how plays are working or breaking down. After losing my semi-permanent seat in the pressbox, that's why I bought season tickets on the back wall, center ice. Best view in the house."

DallasStars,3a1h5z,TheOlig,5,Tue Jun 16 15:32:00 2015 UTC,Trade Daley for something useful and sign Oduya for 3 years?
DallasStars,3a1h5z,TheOlig,3,Tue Jun 16 21:13:10 2015 UTC,"Lehner, Raanta, Berra, Reimer or Lack/Markstrom. And that's pretty much it. Should be cheap to get one of them given all the options. Daley or Garbutt, anyone?"
DallasStars,3a1h5z,Sib_Sy,3,Tue Jun 16 18:18:12 2015 UTC,Id love to dump Garbutt
DallasStars,3a1h5z,shaky_but_nice,5,Tue Jun 16 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"I loved Garbutt for what he brought: energy, depth-scoring, penatly killing scoring threat. But his dumb-assery last year really turned me against him :("
DallasStars,3a1h5z,StephasaurusRexy,2,Tue Jun 16 19:57:37 2015 UTC,Not a trade but could we offer sheet Holtby?
DallasStars,3a1h5z,Sib_Sy,2,Tue Jun 16 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"Of anybody off the Caps' roster, I would want John Carlson. But there's no way that happens. He's locked up 3 more years at 4 mil apiece, and he put up 55 pts last year. That's a steal"
DallasStars,3a1h5z,Brolympia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:33:30 2015 UTC,Caps would match. No way they're letting him get away.
DallasStars,3a1h5z,scoutcjustice,2,Tue Jun 16 18:37:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I forgot they aren't up against the cap.
DallasStars,3a1h5z,shaky_but_nice,2,Tue Jun 16 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"Can we give like Daley, Kari, and Garbutt for Holtby?"
DallasStars,3a1h5z,scoutcjustice,3,Wed Jun 17 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's too many great options for dramatically improving the defense. I don't think Seabrook is really going to be traded, and even if he was Chicago doesn't trade him to Dallas unless we massively overpay. Ditto Dustin Byfuglien. I'd still be okay with Phaneuf. I think Toronto comes down off their asking price, especially if they don't want to retain salary, but I don't know if they come down enough. I don't like any of the free agent defensemen for what they're gonna end up making. They'd be marginal upgrades for stupid money.  I hate to be a downer, but I think last summer was the time to get your big defense acquisition, either in trade (Boychuck) or free agency (Stralman). Of course, the Stars managed to screw themselves with the cap coughGoncharcough, so I'm not sure they had the room to pursue those guys then (we were reportedly interested in Boychuck, but I'm not sure that ever got very far).  I think we just ride the defense as is and count on more improvement from the youth. As long as they can avoid the putrid start, the defense is actually not that bad.  So basically I'd just like them to trade for a goalie. Probably somebody like Lack or Talbot that has shown starter potential."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,shaky_but_nice,4,Tue Jun 16 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"There is no way in hell the Stars bring in Phaneuf and pay him more than Benn, Seguin and Lehtonen, in my opinion. Talk about a franchise-crippling contract. I don't think they would have shelled out the money for Stralman either. He's the kind of guy you want to bring in as a final piece to the puzzle, not build around.  I agree about letting the defense settle for awhile. A deal for a good young defenseman may come along, but I imagine it will take time. They really played well at the end of the season, too."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,languidlurker,2,Tue Jun 16 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"There is no way in hell the Stars bring in Phaneuf and pay him more than Benn, Seguin and Lehtonen, in my opinion.   This doesn't matter at all.   Talk about a franchise-crippling contract.   Not for a smartly run franchise, no. Whether we are smartly run remains to be seen, but 7 million for a player is not a huge deal these days, and at some point you gotta pony up for the players to make the team better.   I don't think they would have shelled out the money for Stralman either. He's the kind of guy you want to bring in as a final piece to the puzzle, not build around.   Stralman at 4.5 is a freakin' bargain. And no, he's not a build around guy (though he's damn close, Stralman is great), but build around guys get way more than 4.5 in free agency these days if they're available at all. This team would be massively improved with Stralman on the roster."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,Fox_and_Otter,8,Tue Jun 16 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"Paying Phaneuf 7 mil/year over the next 6 years is NOT something a well-run franchise does. If 7 mil for a player is not a big deal, and Phaneuf is worth that price, why are they so eager to move him? 7 mil for a player that might maybe kinda make the team better can ABSOLUTELY be franchise crippling. The last thing I want to see is the Stars start making deals like that out of desperation.  I agree that Stralman at that price is a great addition (I never suggested otherwise), but the timing just didn't work out. Such is life."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,Untjosh1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Get Lack if he's available for relatively cheap.  Other than that, hold on to what we have, hope for Arizona to tank again, and make a run for OEL at the deadline.  We didn't miss the playoffs by much and we don't need to blow up the team.  If there is interest in players like Garbutt/Daley you can entertain them, but I wouldn't be actively shopping anyone.  Maybe I'd attempt to clear out Garbutt or Moen so I could resign Eaves, who seemed to be the best fit this past year."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,T-rom,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:40:17 2015 UTC,"Seabrook would be great, JVR would be great to play 2nd line LW, God please dont let us pick up phaneuf and that awful contract.

DallasStars,3a1h5z,ItsReallyOregano,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"Lack, another top six forward that doesn't have his head up his ass in his own end, and some way to fire Daley into a distant star."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,scoutcjustice,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:12:27 2015 UTC,"If we could trade for anyone- I'd say Seabrook or Keith from the Hawks, with our 2015 first round pick, a lower round pick, Daley and a prospect, maybe Ritchie I'd be okay with Phaneuf as well, but in that case the Leafs better eat some salary"
DallasStars,3a1h5z,AustinAustin,12,Tue Jun 16 15:35:32 2015 UTC,"Keith   They will never trade Keith. $5.5 million is a steal for him, and the only way to get Seabrook will be if he hits FA. Hawks wouldn't be so foolish to trade either within the division unless we overpaid"
DallasStars,3a1h5z,snorfdorf,7,Tue Jun 16 16:40:17 2015 UTC,It might be easier to get Toews or Kane out of Chicago than Keith...
DallasStars,3a1h5z,T-rom,3,Tue Jun 16 16:43:27 2015 UTC,Keith just won the Conn Smythe. There's absolutely no way they're letting him go.
DallasStars,3a1h5z,snorfdorf,6,Tue Jun 16 17:39:45 2015 UTC,I dont think Phaneuf would fit well with the stars to be honest.
DallasStars,3a1h5z,T-rom,2,Tue Jun 16 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"Either way I don't think it will happen- I feel like Nill was asked about Phaneuf and said no the Stars aren't interested or something to that extent. Whatever happens, we need a minute-eating defenseman who can play against the opposing team's best players"
DallasStars,3a1h5z,Pilfdominy,2,Tue Jun 16 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, I feel that anyone who could fill that slot right now would be very expensive for us. Who knows though, Nill has a magic hand with this stuff."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,shaky_but_nice,2,Tue Jun 16 15:55:59 2015 UTC,"There are some pretty decent UFAs out there that would take plenty of $$$- I wouldn't mind seeing Nill go after Beauchemin, Ehrhoff or Franson. Of course we already have too many NHL d men so he'd have to make a trade at some point."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,Pilfdominy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think Nill is interested in the free agency at all. Every single d-man that would be beneficial will get overpaid, and when teams get close to the cap they end up losing some of their core (see the Hawks this coming offseason). All of the affordable guys are getting old and in a game that is progressively getting faster and younger, 32+ old dmen are becoming less and less valuable."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,jeuno2,3,Wed Jun 17 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"That's a lot to give up for a guy you still have to pay next summer...and his cap hit would probably end up being the biggest on the team. If we were ready to contend right now, I'd say go for it, but that's just not the position the Stars are in right now.  Talking about Seabrook, btw."
DallasStars,3a1h5z,T-rom,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:30:24 2015 UTC,There is no way the Hawks would ever even consider trading Keith. As stated by /u/scoutcjustice the Hawks would want more from a competing division rival for Seabrook.
DallasStars,3a1h5z,jeuno2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the Stars could sign Martin and Sharp, then if we can get Raptor Jesus back in there, holy hell. Stars have cap space and all 3 of those guys would be taking less than their previous contracts (maybe Sharp at about the same, just take for less years), Sharp on lackluster season, Martin (34) getting older, and Pevs with the health issue. OR Nill pulls another psycho trade 3 years running by acquiring Letang by unloading some of our young pups, getting us that right handed D man. I think na there's no way, just wishful thinking, but I would have thought the same about Seguin. I think Nill hypnotizes opposition GM's into making fools of themselves. I love it."
DallasStars,3a09pv,aggieinoz,24,Tue Jun 16 05:32:34 2015 UTC,"Truth? I don't hate the Hawks. Great team for the most part, that plays damned good hockey.

COME ON OCTOBER, and LEHT'SFUCKINGGOOOOOOSTARS!!!!!!!!!!!"
DallasStars,3a09pv,ChiDaddy123,6,Tue Jun 16 13:44:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. I think most people are in agreement on this. It is the fans that ruin it, just ruin it. I love their players, despise their fans. When the Kings won their two cups their fans were nowhere near as bad as Hawks' fans. Every little bump against their guys and their whole building is just like OH MY GOD PENALTY WAAAAAAAAA. Tampa only got 1 PP at the very end of the game and when it happened the fans were just like NOOO CAN'T BE BOOOOO, our team is made up of innocent angels. Makes me sick. I wanted the Hawks to lose just so their fans wouldn't be happy. You see how many of them there are now on social media and in other people's buildings but where were these damn bandwagoners during the late 90s and early to mid 00's when the Stars (and many other teams) were trouncing their asses on a regular basis."

I was rooting for the Hawks to the final and once my Rangers were out I was all in for the Hawks.  I'm happy they won it.  If you dont like Hawks fans at the AAC then get your butts to the games and rock the victory green. I know not all of us are there but i make the trip up to dallas as much as i can to watch.  It was special to see the Hawks make history. To me there would have been nothing special about Tampa winning.
DallasStars,3a09pv,chenzo512,0,Tue Jun 16 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"Fuck the bandwagon. Remember when the arena had three Hawks fans for any given game five years ago? The fanbase sure doesn't.

The whole Clint Reif equipment manager death, and hell even Scott Darling coming in to make such an impact this postseason. Especially in regards to his own past issues to go through his adversity to be a great player. It all come together for a team that has such depth and personality.  But seeing Morrow also get it would be great as well."

He was mired in some controversy in Philly, but that was more due to the conflict between Berube and Mason. Reese stepped in when Berube was overplaying Mason while hurt, and it ended up costing him his job. But he was right and he has balls to stand up for his goalies when needed.   Good luck and I'll see you at the AAC this fall."
DallasStars,39y0d1,Hambone76,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:38:24 2015 UTC,So the controversy was mostly due to playing times? Or are there some off ice issues?
DallasStars,39y0d1,Cravenater,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"I started to type up an explanation and I realized I was already 5 paragraphs in before I got to the crux of the issue. That's probably more background than you're looking for.   Basically, Mason came in after the Bobo/Bryz debacle and was put behind one of the worst defenses in the league. He suffered some serious confidence problems and wasn't playing well. Enter Jeff Reese, who Mason credited with turning his career around. If you look at the stats, Mason was 3rd in SV% and 7th in GAA this season. Imagine what he could've done with a real defense!   Then he got hurt. Here's a story that does a good job explaining how things went from there."

DallasStars,39y0d1,loflower,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:20:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a cheaper way to help motivate Kari back into form and to avoid overpaying on the market, i like it Nill!"
DallasStars,39y0d1,Cravenater,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:02:04 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistic, but...  Think it's evidence that Mike Valley really does have leverage in the form of photos or knowing something.  WTF, he's a colossal fuck-up, and rather than getting replaced after a season that saw a monumental breakdown of Kari, he's promoted?  EDIT: Incidentally....Heika's writeup is absolutely hilarious when he lists Jeff Reese's background and professional accomplishments in comparison to Mike Valley's experience."
DallasStars,39y0d1,YankeeBravo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:24:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it a promotion, more of a sideways move.  You can't put a bad season of goaltending all on his shoulders. He's done good work with Kari in his time here, he can probably help the other goalies in the system in some capacity."
DallasStars,39y0d1,shaky_but_nice,7,Mon Jun 15 22:42:23 2015 UTC,"We've discussed Mike Valley in past threads, but to recap...  I absolutely can and will place the goaltending problems the Stars have had squarely on Valley's shoulders.  In his 6 seasons with the team, he has accomplished absolutely nothing. Kari was out of shape when he got here, but the trainers and conditioning coach got him in game shape.  He's been good, but he's never been a solid goalie. He's streaky and doesn't handle pressure well. When he has a shitty game, he gets in his own head and off his game. It's exacerbated when he's playing hurt, in situations where an actual goaltending coach wouldn't ask his goalies to play hurt.  And it's not just Lehtonen.  Valley hasn't been able to ""develop"" any thing. Our backups have sucked (up until Nill got Enroth) only to miraculously become pretty decent once they get somewhere that has an actual coach.  Bottom line. Look at Heika's post.  Mike Valley was hired because Tom Hicks was a cheap asshole who cared nothing about the Stars, nothing more, nothing less. His sole qualification was that he was cheap as dirt.   How he's managed to say on after getting ownership willing to spend is a mystery."
DallasStars,39y0d1,YankeeBravo,2,Mon Jun 15 22:51:37 2015 UTC,"C'mon. This organization's personnel in goal has been dogshit, and you know it. Who are these goalies you speak of that left Dallas and miraculously became solid players? Mike Smith, for a while?  I'm glad the Stars have a more qualified guy, but to put all of the Stars' goaltending woes on the shoulders of one guy is asinine.   He may have been in over his head in that position, but now that we have solid ownership and management, he's still got a role with the team...obviously they think he has something to contribute."
DallasStars,39y0d1,shaky_but_nice,3,Tue Jun 16 05:58:04 2015 UTC,Actually Lindback went to the Sabres with basically no team to speak of playing in front him and looked like a decent goalie.
DallasStars,39y0d1,T-rom,2,Tue Jun 16 15:40:05 2015 UTC,"He also faced about 10 shots per game more with Buffalo than with Dallas, which is also going to help his SV% go up significantly."
DallasStars,39y0d1,shaky_but_nice,3,Tue Jun 16 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"True, but the year he played in Dallas was by far the lowest SV% of his career, out of 6 seasons total. He didn't play very often since Ruff likes to ride his starting goalie, so consistency could have been the main issue."
DallasStars,39y0d1,T-rom,4,Tue Jun 16 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"How many goalies has this organization flopped on developing this last decade? It's a bad mix of both, our group of scouts not being able to dictate the right goalie picks and the  developmental side of not being able to develop.  Albeit Rynnas and Lindback are far from NHL calibre goalies. With or without Valley/Stars"
DallasStars,39y0d1,shaky_but_nice,2,Mon Jun 15 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"He was in over his head in that position, but that's reflective of the state of disarray this franchise was in for a while. The goaltending issues run much deeper than Mike Valley.  And if you think the goalies in Cedar Park ""choked"" in the playoffs or that being swept really had anything to do with them, you're way out of touch. Besides, it shouldn't fall on the Dallas Stars' goalie coach to oversee everybody coming up through the pipeline."
DallasStars,39zx4h,happygetaway,4,Tue Jun 16 03:30:51 2015 UTC,"Oduya is a free agent, so not a trade but likely won't be re-signed.  I think they'll do everything they can to keep Seabrook for the last year of his deal, so Sharp, Bickell and Versteeg are more likely to go.  Even if they did trade Seabrook, I doubt they'd offer him inside the division unless we payed something absurd. I don't see any cap casualties from Chicago making their way to Dallas."
DallasStars,39zx4h,scoutcjustice,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"Damn, I would have liked to have seen Oduya on our team. Seems like a dynamic defenseman, and Seabrook was invaluable this playoff run"
DallasStars,39zx4h,scoutcjustice,2,Tue Jun 16 04:29:08 2015 UTC,"Well technically we could sign Oduya. I think he's gonna end up costing a lot though, and he'll be 34 next season. Giving a guy like that a big contract at that age, especially when we have as much youth on defense as we do, probably isn't the best investment."
DallasStars,39wskh,hd_6050,3,Mon Jun 15 13:08:36 2015 UTC,Pretty amazing that this team is so successful in little ole Allen.   Been to a few games and the crowd seems to enjoy the hell out of it.
DallasStars,39wskh,cgeezy22,2,Mon Jun 15 20:08:55 2015 UTC,"I have had season tickets for six years, and most every game has been great entertainment. I expect many more to come because of the great recruiting power Allen has."
DallasStars,39wskh,tpdg38,3,Tue Jun 16 00:22:07 2015 UTC,With both the Steelheads and the Americans team affiliation contracts up we need to get the Americans back in our fold
DallasStars,39wskh,NormGreen,2,Mon Jun 15 21:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at least split them with San Jose like Boston and Washington do with the Stingrays."
DallasStars,39wskh,tpdg38,3,Tue Jun 16 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"Idaho though is so much closer to San Jose and they could just swap jerseys like has happened in the past. Although, do you think it'd be putting our USA club teams too close together?"

DallasStars,39xw1o,jeuno2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:52:31 2015 UTC,"What is going to be great is Strader commentating in a more comfortable be yourself kind of style. It's like when we hear Razor on FSSW for non-national games we get the real Razor. When Razor does NBC games he becomes sort of this rigid, I need to appeal to a generic audience Razor which is great for that purpose. Strader, Razor, all these guys do the same thing for national games because they are asked to. We are going to get to see a Stars representing Strader personality along with Razor and I am excited to see that. What you are hearing in this is Strader's rigidness being applied to NBC. It's not bad but it's not exactly what we will see. I can't wait to hear it. At first it may sound a little like this but as the weeks go on be aware of his transition to a natural feel for being a Stars guy. Going to be sweet."

DallasStars,39ky76,THland,17,Fri Jun 12 13:26:42 2015 UTC,Here's a sample of his work
DallasStars,39ky76,bashurst,16,Fri Jun 12 14:35:46 2015 UTC,"While Ralph's voice has kind of been iconic with us, it was his longevity with the club that was special to me. He was an average commentator and I'm happy to have a fresh voice in the booth.  If Razor left though I'd probably have to curl into a little ball and cry."
DallasStars,39ky76,chenzo512,2,Fri Jun 12 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"It's not even necessarily the level of quality from either guy that made Ralph and razor so special, but their interactions and chemistry really brought out the best in both men.  A large part of that is how long they had been together, so I feel some of that chemistry will be built over the coming seasons, but another portion feels inherent to the two and I'm not sure we'll ever really get back to that level.  That said, there's always the possibility for a pleasant surprise, so I'm still extremely excited to hear the broadcasts come October, if a bit unsure."
DallasStars,39ky76,tasteofflames,2,Fri Jun 12 18:22:11 2015 UTC,Rumor has it that razor and Ralph hated each other

DallasStars,39ky76,DougSR,8,Fri Jun 12 14:57:47 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there was more to it than just ""wanting to do other things"" (I think the relationship with the organization, while not completely soured, wasn't nearly as strong as it used to be), but I think a big factor was that he woke up one day and realized that he was about to be completely untethered for the first time in his life.  He and his wife divorced amicably a little while back, his daughter graduated high school this year & is headed off to college (honestly, if not for the daughter and wife who stayed in the area, I think he might've left sooner), and he has nothing keeping him here other than the his gig with the Stars...a gig that took up a lot of time he could dedicate to other interests.  When you have the financial means to pull the parachute and try something completely different for a little while, I think it's perfectly reasonable to do it and I can't begrudge the man for moving on."
DallasStars,39ky76,MaverickTTT,5,Fri Jun 12 15:59:57 2015 UTC,Nor can I. I'm happy for him. Let's hope his old habits stay old habits.
DallasStars,39ky76,DougSR,3,Fri Jun 12 16:03:30 2015 UTC,He wanted to do other things. He writes for NHL.com now. He had a good article about Morrow before the finals began.

He's still got plenty of medical hurdles to clear, but it does sound like he is looking into it.  His contract with Dallas will be up this summer though, so he will be a UFA free to sign anywhere. If he does come back, he'll probably end up going the professional tryout (PTO) route with a team for training camp and preseason to see if he can make it through those, and then sign a regular contract if he can. He could sign anywhere, but I expect the Stars would probably be his first choice if they were interested."

I think Rynnas to the KHL or elsewhere is far more likely than Rynnas as Kari's backup. Rynnas was good against AHL-level guys, but even then couldn't keep us from getting swept in the CC Playoffs.   Also, why would Desrosiers go to the ECHL? Kiviaho is doing OK down there but I'd rather see the CHL Goalie of the Year come to Cedar Park if he's able. Push Campbell to take that starting spot and run with it."
DallasStars,39cnup,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:02:11 2015 UTC,I don't think it's really right to get rid of Kari after one bad season.   Particularly because I don't see a) how we'd get any kind of return on him and b) what we'd do about the position if we traded him.
DallasStars,39cnup,trex20,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:20:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think the playoffs is entirely Rynnas' fault, didn't he and Campbell split the goaltending during playoffs?"

DallasStars,39bam8,ItsReallyOregano,12,Wed Jun 10 16:23:44 2015 UTC,Lehtonen is at an all time low in value. It would be wrong to trade him away for pennies on the dollar. We should hang on to him for another year and hope shoring up the D core and adding a backup will help fix him.

DallasStars,39bam8,Krumm,2,Wed Jun 10 21:49:44 2015 UTC,I agree so I would have to wonder if letting this kind of story get out might be a motivational move from the Stars front office.
DallasStars,39bam8,zeusjous,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"Head games seem to effect Lehtonen for a game or two.  He needs to go, but we aren't going to get anything for him.  The whole league knows he is flaky."
DallasStars,39bam8,svecer,2,Thu Jun 11 04:17:17 2015 UTC,I agree - we need to work on some better Defense before we let go of Lehtonen. His numbers will improve with some better D. I have no doubt about that.
DallasStars,39bam8,FarmboyCletus,9,Thu Jun 11 00:12:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think it really matters who's in net as long as the defensive core is so poor. I don't think Kari's what he used to be, but I still believe he can be successful if he had help. Besides, I really don't think he has much value to trade anyways."
DallasStars,39bam8,BigGupp,5,Wed Jun 10 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"The defensive group of Klingberg, Goligoski, Nemeth, Jokipakka, Benn and Demers were pretty solid in March/April though. If they could keep that up, along with the forwards doing some solid backchecking, I think we wouldn't be too bad."
DallasStars,39bam8,StephasaurusRexy,-2,Thu Jun 11 06:08:54 2015 UTC,"Can you name 10 teams who have a worse defense than that group listed there?   So that puts the stars, best case scenario, in a bottom 10 defensive talent standpoint. What do you really expect to accomplish with a bottom 10 defense? Even with the amazing offense the stars have, you're a one round and out team at best. Aim higher."
DallasStars,39bam8,bruins4777,4,Fri Jun 12 05:33:37 2015 UTC,"Bruins, buf, Avs, phx, Canadiens, Sens, CBJ, Pit, SJ, NJ, CGY, EDM, TOR, and Carolina all come to mind. A couple of those have a star defenseman and hot garbage with him.   STL, chi, Ana, min, NSH, lak, van, NYI, NYR, WSH, Tampa are clearly better.   You're significantly underselling that group. When Trevor Daley isn't on the ice they're pretty legit. When they don't go balls out for offense they're legit. That's a structural issue - not talent."
DallasStars,39bam8,Untjosh1,-4,Fri Jun 12 08:19:45 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you're being serious. I don't even know where to start if you are.  I'll address the star dman quip first. Do you understand the value of having this star dman? He allows the rest of your lineup and your ""hot garbage"" to be tasked with much easier assignments. It's a tremendous value that is nearly unmatched. It's something the stars don't have and it's why they have such trouble with top lines.  As for your list here. There's not a chance in hell the stars have a better defense than Boston, Montreal, Ottawa, San Jose, Calgary, or Columbus. Phoenix, Pitt, and New Jersey are arguable depending on off season moves.  I really am not sure if we're watching the same team. Not only is that defense insanely young, but theyre extremely raw, unpolished, and honestly not even that talented outside of klingberg. They're incredibly inconsistent and make all sorts of over aggressive plays and in zone mistakes. Sure part of it is structural, but what makes you think Lindy is going to hone that talent properly? Furthermore, are we watching the same jordie benn?"
DallasStars,39bam8,bruins4777,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"Not even that talented outside of Klingberg? We have nothing else to discuss then. Patrik Nemeth, Jason Demers, and Alex Goligoski are a quality group. Opinions vary on Jordie, but I think he does more good than bad."

As far as trading him...the guy is good. He needs to get his mind correct and that to me, may be the biggest issue. Really though i would like to have a good, solid backup. Watching this season showed that all successful teams need to be able to rely on a backup for more than just a couple games here and there. It seems to be a big piece in today's game.  I say keep him for now.   Are we still doing the fire Mike Valley thing?"
DallasStars,39bam8,N0tBr0keJustB3nt,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"No they shouldn't. The Stars were amazing in the last couple months of the season. Kari played too many games and it caught up to him so we couldnt quite make the playoffs, but he was great nonetheless. Just look at his wins column. We're taking a gamble whether we keep him or trade him and get lack/talbot. Lehtonen's proved he can be borderline elite when he's on, if we could get that Kari next year the Stars will be extremely dangerous, but he could have another year like this. But if we get a new guy he could be great, but he could end up being only a backup caliber goalie. Unless we somehow got a proven guy, I think keep Kari"
DallasStars,39bam8,Brentinho,-1,Sun Jun 14 00:20:15 2015 UTC,Simple answer: Yes.
DallasStars,39bam8,Brolympia,-4,Wed Jun 10 19:38:25 2015 UTC,"He's ridiculously inconsistent to the point of not being able to keep ANYTHING out of his net some nights.  So yeah, as far as goalies go for a team that should be in the playoffs, yeah, he's fucking worthless."

DallasStars,38tvt5,R0GERTHEALIEN,2,Sun Jun 7 04:54:41 2015 UTC,"He certainly does have recognition outside of Dallas. If anything he doesn't have enough recognition IN Dallas, due to it being a city largely focused on Cowboys, Mavs, Rangers then Stars in that order. Canada knows full well of Benn and since EA Canada division makes NHL they know full well once again of Benny. To me it has to be down to Price and Benn. After research I did a few days it would seem the vote is actually gone for this year's title. So if EA is just handpicking the cover man Benn's chances go up. If there is a vote it would be a Hawk...again. They know that so they took it away. Last year I said Benn or Seguin purely on bias for wanting to just see it. However this year Benn is legitimately the top name to be the chosen one. There have been a handful of other elements that have contributed to this being more realistic. Finally getting an owner, a GM, the new jersey/logo, but most important having Seguin on the team has boosted his popularity. Then coming off the Art Ross season where Seguin was out for 12 or 13 total games including that last suspended game he was certainly pushed even more out into the spotlight. I don't necessarily believe it has to be a playoff team's rep that makes it. I truly believe it will be Benn. If it's Price I won't be surprised either. He had an amazing season as well and a goalie hasn't been on the cover in some time. If anyone else gets the cover I will be just a little ticked off to say the least lol."
DallasStars,38tvt5,N0tBr0keJustB3nt,2,Sun Jun 7 08:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're probably right,  he probably does have more name recognition outsideof dallas than inside. Hope th at changes this season"

DallasStars,38ps6n,coltpoa,3,Fri Jun 5 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"This is a deep draft, which is great for us being that we have a mediocre draft position.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of consensus among mock drafts, other than #1 and #2.  I'm hoping that one or two teams ahead of us draft for a needed position, and it lets a ""best player available"" fall to us kind of like Nuke did.  I did see 2 days ago that the Flyers said they plan to take the best available at #7, so it won't be them letting someone slip down to us.     Craig Button has Noah Hanafin, who was once seen as the solid #3 falling to #12.  I was once hoping Povorov would fall, but his star is rising. I'd love to see Werenski or Pavel Zacha fall, but they are still probably pipe dreams.  Barzal, Connor, and Meier seem to be the consensus of likely picks available at #12.  I think I'd lean toward Barzal (I'm in Seattle so I'm biased) or Connor for the potential elite playmaking ability."
DallasStars,38ps6n,drlari,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:33:57 2015 UTC,If Zacha drops to us my bet is we'll take him

DallasStars,38ps6n,drlari,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:55:10 2015 UTC,I think we have a good shot at Povorov.  I didn't realize Hanafin's star falling.  I'll have to read your link as to why.  Edit:  And he doesn't explain why.

If by some chance Werenski is still there, I'd take him in a heartbeat. I think he'll be gone by then though so I'd be a fan of taking Meier, Konecny, Connor, Zacha, or Barzal. Bob McKenzie's final ranking tends to be pretty damn accurate and he has Werenski, Meier and Connor at 11th, 12th and 13th so I bet one of them will still be available when the Stars pick."

DallasStars,37znul,jeuno2,9,Sun May 31 20:17:02 2015 UTC,Indeed after his tenure with Tampa Richards became more of mercenary in my opinion. He literally chose everywhere he wanted to go (not Dallas) whereas Morrow got traded a few times then chose to sign with Tampa. I am glad we didn't sign Richards with a huge contract. We wouldn't have Seguin at this point.

DallasStars,37znul,neverender158,5,Sun May 31 20:17:59 2015 UTC,This is the main reason I am for TB. Other teams have great fans. Even the Detroit fans are cordial. The Hawks fans tend to be drunken messes who are half bandwagoners and the other half boisterous braggers. There might be a 2% awesome Hawks fanbase that I have met at the AAC.  I also really want TB to win because they have shown a lot of heart and I heard so many people say that they weren't going to make it and the Rangers were going to slaughter them. They held their heads up and played a hell of a game 7.
DallasStars,37znul,dalstars81,5,Sun May 31 23:46:26 2015 UTC,I was pulling for the Rangers during the playoffs. But now that TB has beaten them I would love to see our former captain raise the cup.  I couldn't give two shits about Brad Richards. He was in Dallas for a very short period of time and to me it seemed he never really wanted to be here.  In the west I hate the Ducks and the Blackhawks. I hate the ducks more so I wanted the Blackhawks to beat them. But I want the Blackhawks to lose for beating the Bruins in 2013. But more importantly I really want to see Morrow raise the cup and skate it around the rink. He deserves his name on the cup.

They're a fantastic organization and have a truly skilled line up, but I'm ready for a shift in league dominance.

DallasStars,3807tr,Brentinho,8,Sun May 31 21:53:05 2015 UTC,Canucks want a 2nd rounder for Lack...   Do you guys think the Stars could nab him for potentially less or do you guys feel comfortable trading 49th overall for him?
DallasStars,3807tr,jeuno2,4,Sun May 31 21:53:34 2015 UTC,That actually seems pretty fair. The expectation is that Enroth is wanting to get out. That is fine by me. He's okay at times but I don't like his size. We would be better off with Lack versus having Enroth. Lack might be able to thrive in a small market like Dallas versus being in that psycho city of Vancouver with those fans. I know we have seen Nill dish out some picks but in the grand scheme of things he is quite conservative with draft picks in general. He generally likes to use them for drafting players unless the class seems like a dud so I don't see this actually happening.
DallasStars,3807tr,Pilfdominy,4,Sun May 31 21:59:30 2015 UTC,"Something tells me that there's a team out there that will give up a 2nd. If no one does then I could see Nill pulling the trigger for a 3rd, but in this draft class a 2nd is tough to give up. Plus SOMEONE will probably just give up the 2nd."
DallasStars,3807tr,KniveySpoony,2,Mon Jun 1 01:40:45 2015 UTC,Lack loves it here and the fans love him. There's no lack of development going on here for him.
DallasStars,3807tr,btharveyku08,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:31:56 2015 UTC,"The fan-favorite stature of Lack is all well and good, but is there truth to the article's Markstrom discussion? If so, 1) how would you personally solve the franchise's goaltending logjam, and 2) do you have any reasoning better than the author to suggest Lack wouldn't be an odd man out in this situation?"
DallasStars,3807tr,KniveySpoony,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:43:13 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you asked, friend! :D  As for Markstrom, yes, our goalie coach, who is not a fool, really loves Marky. I believe there's also some pressure to keep him as Matthias, the other piece from the Luongo trade, is undoubtedly going to be left to walk this off-season. Tie this in with his AHL playing I think there's a desire to keep him as he will be waiver eligible after these playoffs.   Personally, I'd trade Miller for beans and make Lack and Markstrom the duo. They've played together in Sweden, are great friends, and would make an excellent duo. In years let Marky go and bring up Cannata. After he's done as a backup, Demko will be ready to start and Lack can ease into being the backup. All we have to do is get that Miller ball rolling and I believe most Canuck fans would be quite happy with Lack/Marky.   As for your second question, oh no. I'm sure he'd play well for a team that needs a starter. Like I said, he just personally loves it up here: he gets huge 'Eddie' chants after literally every big save and is a colossal fan favorite. The enthusiasm I saw for him in Rogers last year was phenomenal.   So I'm probably overrating his value a tad bit but a low second rounder is still not enough. There's discussion of possibly packaging him and Bieksa for a first rounder, something I wouldn't mind."
DallasStars,3807tr,btharveyku08,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"With the second question, I meant more along the lines of do you know anything that would be at odds with the author's assertion that the higher ups in Vancouver are bought in on Miller? I mean, there is a solid contingent of Stars fans that would really like to get out from under Lehtonen's contract as well, but the AAV means we're far more likely to ride it out for its duration.  I got what you meant about him being well-liked amongst the fans up there. But what I meant was more of a combination of these issues: 1) Miller is probably the most difficult to move out of your three goalie options due to his AAV, which suggests why the front office might be bought in with Miller, as suggested in the article; 2) other teams know you won't be rolling into the season with the goalies on your NHL roster; and 3) knowing what we do about issue 1 and 2, other teams are far more likely to conditionally bid lower on your two more desirable options because they know you are more or less needing to move one of the three.  I'm willing to bet that's why the second-rounder price tag is what's being bounced around right now for Lack. He might be worth more to another team, but they all know Vancouver needs to move someone, and like Lehtonen, it probably won't be Miller unless you eat a bad move for him. Which no front office wants to do, especially after just having signed him the previous off-season.  With that in mind, put yourself in our shoes. We know with the waiver eligibility that Vancouver needs to move a goalie. No one wants to pay Miller's AAV. So then, in terms of picks and/or generic prospect levels, what's the most you'd offer Vancouver for Lack? I can see what you mean about a low second-round pick being not enough, but from where I am sitting, I can't see Nill (or many other GMs) offering much more than that. Maybe he could throw in a prospect projecting as high as a third-liner or something, but not much. If Vancouver is hoping for more, it's because they're going for a desperate team to blink and offer more than they probably should."
DallasStars,3807tr,KniveySpoony,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I can't see it any other way than us getting rid of Miller for beans or getting hefty return on Lack.   Management has one straw of faith left. We literally chased our old GM/President out because he ran out of good will. If Lack goes for a low second or help us a third, Vancouver will once again burn, though metaphorically this time, red with the intensity of a load of pissed off fans.   We traded our second for Sven Baertschi because Benning said he sees nothing worthwhile in the second round to draft. We don't want second rounders.   So that's why it's very unlikely to see Lack go for just a second. It'll be a package deal for a first or Miller for literally a John Scott."
DallasStars,3807tr,btharveyku08,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"I see where you're going with it, but I just don't see them coming out ahead with an offloading of Miller, after a big contract and only one year; the fans that aren't in favor of the management won't we happy with having Miller stick around, and any weak return for him will just be a sign that the acquisition was a mistake in the first place.  That only realistically leaves moving one of the two backups (even if currently in name only). I'd like to see you guys get something good in a move, especially since it's always nice getting a good conversation like this going, but Canucks management backed themselves into this very corner with the moves they made, and from an outsider's perspective, it doesn't appear like they have a lot of flexibility. Really, I think they just have to hope Lack drums up some interest in several teams, to get a bidding war going.  This is a great year for a first-round pick; it'd take more than a backup goalie to prize one of those away from someone. For instance, we have the 12th pick.What would you think is fair including Lack for that pick?  (This is purely academic as there's probably nothing you could throw our way that would tear Nill away from a first-rounder ... At least nothing you'd be okay parting with, haha.)"
DallasStars,3807tr,KniveySpoony,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"Fans totally wouldn't care if the return for Miller is weak. We'd take a 4th rounder and be happy, it's all about shedding his contract. I don't think it was much of a mistake as it was getting someone in there. Lack was not ready for a starting position last year, he burned out after 20 games in a row after Lu went. Now, he's ready, and shedding Miller is the main objective. I don't get why it was initially three years on his contract but whatever, as long as we dump him ( even though I love him).   I think Lack, Hamhuis, Hansen, and our first rounder would be close to what we'd offer. That's a starter, an Olympic Dman, a solid bottom sixer, and the 23rd. I'm not sure what else Dallas wants or needs so I could amend that if need be."
DallasStars,3807tr,btharveyku08,2,Mon Jun 1 21:47:20 2015 UTC,"Simply in terms of playing out your proposed trade, the Stars are flush with bottom-six attacking talent, even bottom-sixers that project higher with age. Hamhuis would be interesting, though I don't know how interested Nill would be in making our defenseman corps older. I'm honestly interested to see where we'd go with our pick, assuming we went 12th. Most draft projections having us seemingly go with best-available, which I suppose makes some sense.  Ultimately, IMO, the Stars need to come away from this off-season with a notable positive impact on defense (or two), and a backup goalie good enough to push Lehtonen for starts.  Either way, I'd think your proposal would at least get the higher ups with Dallas talking a lot. :)  Good luck with y'all's moves this summer! What sorts of things would you say Vancouver needs to do to get better for next season?"

DallasStars,3807tr,kilios75,3,Mon Jun 1 18:13:12 2015 UTC,"Only 25% of second round draft picks even become career NHL players. Lack has played a full season worth of NHL games and put up quality numbers for a starting goaltender. He loses value for still being under 100 games, but the guys shown hes good at this level. I think a 2nd rounder for him is a great deal and would jump on it, especially because I believe his cap hit is only around 1 mil next season. He would be an affordable option to keep as a quality backup, and someone you could trust to move into a starting position if kari declines again."

DallasStars,3807tr,romosgotthis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"Eh. I wouldn't hate it. Lack would be a huge upgrade as a backup and has the potential to be a starter. But a 2nd round pick is getting to the territory where the goalie should be a starter (and has more upside as well). Lack is almost there, but I don't know if he has those kinds of skins on the wall yet. Vancouver certainly didn't think so after giving 6 million a year for 3 years to a 34 year old goaltender last summer. Plus, lack is a UFA after this coming season, which ain't great.  I'd be willing to reserve judgement until it played out, but I'd be skeptical of giving up a 2nd for him. If Nill could swing it for less I'd be on board."

DallasStars,37subh,kilios75,-32,Sat May 30 04:05:57 2015 UTC,He was never my captain. I'd rather watch the Stars leave Dallas than admit he did anything of merit for this club. I was never more happy in my long history as a Stars fan than I was reading about his trade.
DallasStars,37subh,twentynineotters,6,Sat May 30 04:08:55 2015 UTC,And what meritorious things did Steve Ott do for the club?

DallasStars,37subh,DoctorBreakfast,-19,Sat May 30 04:38:11 2015 UTC,I made no claim that Ott was better than Morrow. In fact no one spoke of Ott until you did inciting me to lash out. Congrats on that btw. You must feel so proud you got the nobody to freak out. Mission accomplished.
DallasStars,37subh,twentynineotters,9,Sat May 30 08:56:46 2015 UTC,"While i dont much care for comparing the ott and morrow thing, i am genuinely curious what you have against morrow. Youre the first stars fan ive ever heard have such a distaste for him. What did he do that you disliked so much?"

DallasStars,37subh,Green_Colossus,10,Wed Jun 3 03:59:02 2015 UTC,Hope Morrow grabs the cup. The alternative is seeing Perry raise it or hear Hawks fans talk about how they are the defending champs when they come to AAC.

DallasStars,37subh,medicmarch,4,Sat May 30 02:58:49 2015 UTC,"Tampa has had much higher quality opponents on their run to the cup, and this Chicago/Anaheim series has been more about one of the teams falling apart in a game rather than two quality teams playing it out.

DallasStars,37subh,laxintx,1 point,Sat May 30 07:47:45 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely rooting for Tampa, but it's because I really don't want Chicago or Anaheim to win. I'm pretty ambivalent on Morrow. His last couple years kinda soured his legacy for me."
DallasStars,37subh,scoutcjustice,1 point,Sat May 30 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, though Morrow was an awesome captain for us he kinda coasted in his final years. I just want Tampa to win it all, I could care less about Brenden."
DallasStars,37subh,Dallas_Stars_Fan,5,Sat May 30 15:57:59 2015 UTC,Not fair to say he coasted. I remember saying this to someone before in defense of Morrow but that man was in a lot of pain in his final years with the Stars. You remember the crap Steve Nash pulled with Lakers in his final year with them. He just sat there earning I recall 22 million which was graciously accepted. Morrow actually played and was most likely in a shit more ton of pain than Nash. Morrow gave what he could which is more than can be said for others.
DallasStars,37rkw3,thestarsarebright,2,Fri May 29 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"I don't really care who wins, which means I can just root for an exciting game. So that's nice."

These guys vary in what they do compared to the powerful right wingers we have coming up through the ranks.  McKenzie is on the cusp, Ranford got a cup of coffee... but they both do the same job.  I've written Molin off. He's got another year, but there's been very little progress.  Then we've got the super short name duo of Remi Elie and Cole Ully who begin their pro careers next season in Texas. These guys are different players and I'm really excited to see what Ully can do at the AHL level. What about you guys?"

Probably the most offensively creative and talented forward in the Stars' system.  And for a guy that went so late partially because of his size, he's not actually that small at 5'11"". He's too light right now, but he's tall enough that he should be able to add some bulk. He could be the next 5th round steal for the Stars."

Don't get me wrong, he was great in the games he played with Dallas, but he was also playing to prove a point that he's nhl ready. May not perform the same if he's a dedicated player.  I personally would rather see Hemsky get another shot in the 2nd line (about 10-15 games?) with Spezza and then Ritchie replace garbutt on the pit bull line since he's a more physical and defensive player then ales....at least for the start of the season."
DallasStars,37cevj,Pilfdominy,2,Tue May 26 23:19:44 2015 UTC,You're doing awesome with these. It's cool to get some in depth analysis of the system at each position.

DallasStars,37acmc,DoctorBreakfast,7,Tue May 26 03:52:46 2015 UTC,I think Jokipakka is the better defenseman right now and Oleksiak has more trade value with his potential
DallasStars,37acmc,dalstars81,7,Tue May 26 04:03:48 2015 UTC,Oleksiak should be traded. Keep Jokkipakka. I feel like Nemeth and him are going to be sticking around for quite awhile. Just have this feeling or should I say hope.
DallasStars,37acmc,Sib_Sy,6,Tue May 26 05:31:52 2015 UTC,"I said this to someone else in the comments below, but everyone wants Oleksiak to be a stay-at-home, mauler in the Derian Hatcher mold. But I don't think that's his game...he's at his best on the rush and creating chances because of his skating ability. He's been pretty adequate on the back end and knows his defensive duties but he can stand to get better.  As for potential trade value...Oleksiak by a mile. Jokkipaka may have gotten the minutes this year, but I don't think any other clubs see him as anything special."
DallasStars,37acmc,wesdub,2,Tue May 26 14:31:58 2015 UTC,You're completely right. The Stars fanbase fetishizes bruisers when they are becoming more and more useless in today's NHL.
DallasStars,37acmc,brickwall5,3,Wed May 27 08:36:24 2015 UTC,Won't be a popular opinion but I'd keep Oleksiak. Yes Jokipakka looks better right now but Oleksiak has the potential to be a much better defenseman in the long run. Honestly both of them made their fair share of mistakes last season but people like to focus on Oleksiak because he carries the first round tag on him.  Jokipakka looks to be a solid bottom pairing defenseman while Oleksiak has the potential to be a top pairing guy if he gets it together. You just don't trade that this early. The islanders learned that with Chara the hard way.
DallasStars,37acmc,MrFluffyFingers,1 point,Tue May 26 08:18:08 2015 UTC,Can you name any other player besides Chara that this happened to? They aren't even comparable players besides height.

DallasStars,37acmc,shaky_but_nice,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:23:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, use the relevant guy. But he was always decent, much better than Oleksiak. I mean he was drafted 2nd overall."
DallasStars,37acmc,Sib_Sy,3,Wed Jun 3 14:32:37 2015 UTC,"The whole ""Oleksiak is big so he should be checking all the time"" argument is complete bullshit to me. The advantage he has in size should be used for pokechecks and just taking away space from defenders, not running around bulldozing guys. In today's league, where the emphasis is on speed and skills, guys who focus too much on getting big hits get victimized and found out of position all the time. Oleksiak is good at using his long reach to break up plays and his body for positioning people in the defensive zone. He should continue to work on that and his defensive awareness and then be good. He should NOT work on becoming a slightly smarter Mark Fistric."
DallasStars,37acmc,brickwall5,3,Wed May 27 08:35:09 2015 UTC,"Could not have said this better myself. I think Oleksiak's play actually suits the way the NHL is moving quite well. I'm not saying he's showed much in the NHL by any means, but his skill set looks good for the future as long as he can stop looking so damn scared to play in the big leagues."
DallasStars,37acmc,Pilfdominy,1 point,Wed May 27 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think a big part of it is that really this was the first season he should have seen an extended look at NHL action. He was called up way too early in the past due to injuries, which leads to being scared now because he was over-matched then. I have a feeling he'll be much more comfortable this coming season."
DallasStars,37acmc,brickwall5,2,Thu May 28 05:22:45 2015 UTC,"I would say it might even be the opposite problem. I think he could've used more AHL time to get more confident at the pro level and become more consistent before trying to have him make the jump. Who knows, though."
DallasStars,37acmc,Pilfdominy,3,Thu May 28 20:58:44 2015 UTC,"Jokipakka had 2 goals no assists for Finland and played a solid defensive game. After this past season showing he can hang and his confidence boost from worlds, we have to keep the kid. Really large defensemen in the NHL don't develop until they are about 27-28. Think Chara. We don't have that time to wait, he'll be out of contract. Trade Big Rig."
DallasStars,37acmc,Geoslug,1 point,Tue May 26 04:52:44 2015 UTC,"Those who follow Oleksiak in the AHL will be mostly the only people who think he should be kept. The bottom line is that Oleksiak has been given 3 opportunities to stick with Dallas, and has played himself back into the AHL all 3 times. JJ was given 1, and never looked back.  Some players just don't have games that translate to the NHL level. Oleksiak seems to be great down in Cedar Park, but unless he figures out what he needs to change to perform in the NHL, he's not going to be valuable.  Maybe Oleksiak deserves another training camp and a 4th chance at the NHL, but right now his game just hasn't been there. His main upside is his size, but as most will point out, his game has never been about using his size."
DallasStars,37acmc,kilios75,3,Tue May 26 14:21:30 2015 UTC,2 of those 3 opportunities came way too early when everyone knew he wasn't ready and was only up on an emergency basis. Last year was his only real chance of sticking with the club.
DallasStars,37acmc,brickwall5,1 point,Wed May 27 08:37:04 2015 UTC,Why do you think we can't keep both?  That's a presumption with no evidence to support if and why we can't.
DallasStars,37acmc,HeisenbergKnocking80,3,Tue May 26 19:18:20 2015 UTC,Can't look it up right now but I'm pretty sure they're eligible for waivers next season. Hopefully Daley is moved and Jordie is set as a #7
DallasStars,37acmc,ItsReallyOregano,2,Tue May 26 20:13:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't think about the waiver situation.  Hopefully, Oleksiak pans out and we can keep both JJ and him, and get rid of Benn the Elder and Daley.  I just think Oleksiak's upside is too good to trade.  He's only 22, and we know it takes a few years for defensemen to break out."
DallasStars,37acmc,HeisenbergKnocking80,1 point,Tue May 26 21:54:28 2015 UTC,"Dallas has an abundance of young defensemen. If they both become decent we won't have the cap space to keep them both if we still want to have the high powered offense we have. Pittsburgh had a similar problem a few years ago and they ended up trading or not re-signing several of them. Even if we could keep them, it'd make more sense to trade one of them for prospects that aren't defensemen.   Here's an article outlining Dallas' current defensive system.  http://otwinner.com/?p=156"
DallasStars,37acmc,HeisenbergKnocking80,1 point,Tue May 26 20:31:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the link.  I'll check it out.
DallasStars,37acmc,btharveyku08,1 point,Tue May 26 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"IMO, we should be expecting some turnover in the next few seasons. That said, we could potentially end up with some room for both, assuming some other players move on.  If I HAD to pick one of the two right now, I'm right there with you about Jokipakka. But someone else could easily move on / get shipped out beforehand. At least I hope so."
DallasStars,37acmc,StephasaurusRexy,1 point,Thu May 28 01:41:00 2015 UTC,I'd rather have Jokipakka with 10 points in 51 who plays a safe defensive game than Oleksiak with 8 points in 36 but is all over the map. We have enough defensemen that are good at scoring.
DallasStars,37acmc,Untjosh1,1 point,Tue May 26 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"Neither one is that great, though Id keep Jokipakka over him without hesitating."
DallasStars,37acmc,DaRabidMonkey,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:04:34 2015 UTC,"Oleksiak has no hockey sense. He should be better by now. He's improved, but he'll never be good. Jokipakka for sure. I have a feeling Jokipakka's in the range of tradable Dmen, though. If only some organization were to be stupid enough to want Oleksiak over him."
DallasStars,37acmc,wesdub,2,Tue May 26 06:10:27 2015 UTC,"Oleksiak isn't the mauling stay-at-home guy i think everyone wants him to be. in the A he's allowed to be an offensive defenseman and create chances. this last year he had 16 points (4 G, 12 A) and was +26 in 35 games played.   he has a ton of upside with his size and ability to skate, he just needs to be involved in the offensive game."
DallasStars,37acmc,Pilfdominy,1 point,Tue May 26 13:47:26 2015 UTC,Offensive defenseman might be a little far. His game is definitely 2-way though.
DallasStars,37acmc,Untjosh1,2,Fri Jun 5 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"He really doesn't. He can't just react to plays. He always has to think and it slows him down below the pace of NHL play.   Edit: that's part of what makes Klingberg so good. He just ""does"" things. He rarely takes hits and turnovers when they happen are from trying to do too much. He's always ahead of the play rather than behind like Oleksiak."
DallasStars,378o6w,primetimey,2,Mon May 25 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"[B]ut that hasn't seemed to be a major problem during his two seasons in Dallas, during which time only Sidney Crosby¬†has scored more points¬†than Benn or Seguin.   Amazing.  Also mentioned that Klingberg had the best PPG for any rookie defensemen in the past 20 years.  Wow."

DallasStars,378tve,ARandomWhiteBoy,2,Tue May 26 20:31:29 2015 UTC,I like how Tolleson's saves are so boring. So much better than almost having heart attacks when Feliz tries to save games.

DallasStars,37609r,Abbbjk,7,Mon May 25 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"It was a a good bit of both, but I feel like it also has a lot to do with going the entire season without a decent backup goalie. Kari may have been off his game a little, but an almost guaranteed loss any time he didn't start doesn't help the situation. Lindback was a mistake right out of the gate, but if Enroth can find his groove with the team and share some of the load I think Kari will bounce back."

Of course, Buffalo had Ryan Miller then, so I don't know what playing time Enroth thought he was gonna get. Enroth ain't that good."
DallasStars,37609r,scoutcjustice,3,Mon May 25 19:22:05 2015 UTC,"Bit of everything.   I think the rough start without a lifeline (backup goalie) got into his head a bit and caused a bit of tailspin.   That and we're already not an amazingly defensive team, Kari had a HUGE weight on his shoulders with very little support.   Rough Start Defensively + No Backup + No opportunity to get his head on straight lead to a situation he couldn't recover from.   Get a solid backup/secondary goalie, Get our defense to stop making foolish ""I wasn't where i should have been"" mistakes, and (IMHO) get a new goalie coach.  Mr Elitegoalies just isn't doing the trick.  Sitting at 240-260GA and thinking we can get into the playoffs is just crazy.  That number needs be to sub-220.  He's had a great run but hasn't made magic happen.    Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dallas_Stars_seasons"
DallasStars,37609r,grufftech,3,Tue May 26 09:32:30 2015 UTC,"Here's my breakdown:  60% of it was bad defense. Even as the defense improved later in the season though, there would still be 3-4 really good chances that we'd give up that are hard shots to stop. People point at how dominant the Stars were in Corsi in the second half of the season, but the defense was still exceptionally prone to allowing really good scoring chances against.  20% of it was Kari. He had a down year, sure, but he still stole some games for us when he was on his game.  20% of it was bad luck. There were quite a few goals that went in on Kari that were just crazy weird. The first goal he gave up during the season literally went through his pads. It looked like Kari had it, but it just slipped through some hole that shouldn't be there.  Overall, I'm not worried at all. He's going to bounce back next year, and with a better defense, the Stars will be in the playoffs. I'd put money on it."

DallasStars,36y4wg,benday,2,Sat May 23 15:38:20 2015 UTC,I think Hemsky is a decent player but honestly instead of a player like that I would rather see a Dominic Moore or another kind of Patrick Eaves like player in his spot. He's too fragile. He does some offensive things occasionally but that's not what we need. We need a few extra crash test dummy style role players who can scrap. I don't like bashing on him because he's one of the more gentlemanly like players in the league but we need some more rust through the lineup.

DallasStars,36n8fh,Rubb3rDucky,4,Wed May 20 18:37:22 2015 UTC,9 is probably the most significant IMO  edit: in case you didn't know. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Modano
DallasStars,36n8fh,chasermann94,7,Wed May 20 16:59:26 2015 UTC,But 9 is also retired so he might not like that. Perhaps the year OP's son was born?

DallasStars,36l1cw,tbryan987,7,Wed May 20 07:32:31 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous to hear Dallas Stars fans prefer the Ducks over the Hawks. The Ducks knocked us out of the Playoffs last year and Cory Perry is the biggest douche on and off the ice. The ducks were long time division rivals for years! The Hawks fans nonsense is just that, as a season ticket holder I have never heard an overboard Hawks fan yet, maybe I sit in a friendly section, I call a spade a spade... it's really just envy and jealousy, have some confidence in the Stars and don't be so butthurt. Do you think Kings fans cry over the Hawks? NO! because they have 2 cups recently so they don't have the envy. I never heard a word about the Hawks from 1998 until they won a cup... tells me all I need to know right there."
DallasStars,36l1cw,NicKaleo,3,Wed May 20 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree.  We have real, recent history with the Ducks.  Aside from Roussel's domination at United Center, what real beef do we have with Chicago?  They're just a really, really, really great club, which makes them easy to hate?  I guess?    That said, I'm guilty of hating the hawks, too.  Whatever.  And fuck the Ducks."

As it's been stated elsewhere, if Roussel was doing this.. we'd be chuckling & defending him.  The reason I think a lot of people don't like the Ducks is because they play a very face paced game, similar to ours, but they do it better (arguably) enough to beat us on the ice (at least last season).   I wouldn't be opposed to the Ducks winning a Cup this year, just so it's that much sweeter when we beat them on the ice next year. Just my 2cents."

Hate Perry and the Ducks but also loathe Blackhawk fans. I hate cheering for the Ducks but the thought of the hawks fans and their snarky attitudes at the AAC next season if they win the cup is enough to make me lean towards the Ducks side. Which is the lesser of two evils?

DallasStars,36jvwa,jeepsasquatch,3,Wed May 20 19:18:24 2015 UTC,"I don't have cable, I would only be watching stars games and I don't want to pay for a package just to get one channel. Instead I use nhl gamecenter and a very easy to use service called tunnelbear. Tunnelbear allows me to browse the Internet as if I am in another country. Basically I just set my location to Russia and I get around all the blackout restrictions that come with nhl gamecenter. It also makes the yearly subscription cost of nhl gamecenter somewhere around 79 dollars instead of 169 it usually costs. Idk if you are set on getting cable but this could serve as another option and you get every single  NHL game all season long for only 79 bucks. I used this trick for every stars game this year and didn't have any issues. However, the qulaity isn't what cable could provide but it's fairly close."

DallasStars,36dzps,nathanhardy,-1,Fri May 22 05:27:03 2015 UTC,Yeah fuck me for wanting another human being to remain in good health for the sake of his family and own well being. I'm such a dick.
DallasStars,36dzps,PezRadar,2,Fri May 22 06:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yeesh... Talk about taking a joke comment a bit too seriously.  I'm kind of known for being a giant Rich 'Raptor Jesus' Peverley fan... so I'm totally kidding.  http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/rich-peverley-legend-raptor-jesus-212904353--nhl.html  And now to address the original comment...  The way you worded it, you made it sound as if it was risky for the team and it's scary for the team as opposed to the general player and his health so you'd rather another team deal with that burden which kind of comes off a bit wrong.  I understand you didn't mean it that way but your original comment doesn't exactly specify that and can be taken a few different ways.  Obviously he won't come back if his doctors clearly say it will be bad for his health.  He has stated numerous times that his family and being around for them is the most important thing."
DallasStars,36dzps,chenzo512,0,Sat May 23 04:13:46 2015 UTC,"It expires at the end of June.

And, as the podcast explains, they won't let him come back unless the doctors think there is NO chance of it happening again."
DallasStars,36dzps,nathanhardy,2,Mon May 18 23:33:58 2015 UTC,I'd like to have him around with coaching or management with either Dallas or down here in Cedar Park. Idk if playing would be the best thing for him...

DallasStars,36dzps,HoboMasterJCP,1 point,Mon May 18 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"My worry is why he has the ICD (defibrillator)? They are typically used when treatment has failed or the individual is not a candidate for ablation. He failed medical management which is why he collapsed and why the ablation was done. I could understand the reasoning of covering his butt with it just in case he converts to a shockable rhythm. If in a year he hasn't had a problem, I could see why they would discuss maybe removing it. It's all so contingent on ""what if"" and there are few cases to compare with. Ablation and meds work but nothing is 100%. He was lucky to have quick attention with his collapse. Would he be if it happened again? He's also at risk of blood clots and may also be on anticoagulants. Too many questions left open for me."
DallasStars,36dzps,mrspistols,5,Tue May 19 14:48:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry to pick on you a bit, but you hit a lot of the same points I keep seeing places. People keep saying he shouldn't play because THEY don't know the answers to these questions. The problem is that his doctors DO know the answers. If he's looking at returning, then the medical route did succeed and he's not on anticoagulants. He's not insane and neither are his doctors. If there were a risk of him having further heart problems, they wouldn't even be talking about it. The Stars get some of the best medical care in DFW and Peverley does have options as far as coaching, so it's not like he's just doing it for the money. Trust in the system."
DallasStars,36dzps,HoboMasterJCP,2,Tue May 19 15:38:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for hitting on this. This was one of the big points from the podcast that I'm sure many people didn't listen to. It's up to the doctors. I'm not saying I want to see him come back for my own personal pleasure at the risk of his health. But he is a hockey player at heart and he wants to play hockey of they determine it is safe for him to do so. And I say good for him. Either way, coaching or playing, he has my support."
DallasStars,36dzps,mrspistols,2,Tue May 19 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"I agree to trust in his doctors but this isn't an easy issue at all. There is little comparative literature or guidelines for managing atrial fibrillation in athletes. I want him to return but the risk of a repeat emergency is present.  There are many ""ifs"" to consider and if his team feels they can safely control ventricular rhythm, decrease risk of thromboembolism/stroke and other complications, and maintain normal sinus rhythm (this is the least needed of the 3) then I'm all for it. He's being managed by Cleveland Clinic and UTSW which does open opportunity for experimental/new treatments which would definitely give him the absolute best chance at returning. I also don't have 100% information as the doctors do so it may be better or worse than what I can guess.   Ablation is about 70-80% effective after one (only 50-70 if chronic though), and 85-90% for two at one year. An implanted device is also an option to treat a-fib, may be needed after Cox-Maze procedure due to the procedure itself or sinus node problems, and is used post ablation when ventricular rate control is needed. I don't know why he has it but it's a good sign they are discussing removing it. It's also a good sign that he has been able to skate consistently as that tests his heart.  Another big question is what level of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is needed to prevent stroke as that is one of the biggest complications faced (others include heart failure, heart attack, death, hypotension, bradycardia). If his CHADS2 score (nifty tool that helps evaluate stroke risk) is low he may only need Aspirin and would be able to play.   I hope he returns. They could definitely monitor his heart rhythm as they did before and with dedicated team doctors he's got better and more rapid care than most if problems arise. Precautions such as having an AED by the bench and all staff CPR certified are simple measures that appear already in place and would benefit any player.   If his ablation was successful and he's able to increase his exercise intensity without problems over the summer I could definitely see him getting the green light to return.   I'm a nurse practitioner and medically manage A-fib patients, but he's with a medical team that helps write the guidelines we use. I'm fascinated by his treatment and if he returns to play it could have benefit to others. I'm also glad I'm not the one making the decision."

DallasStars,36avw3,lolhaibai,1 point,Mon May 18 12:10:13 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with the backups issue, Kari definitely didn't have the greatest of seasons but when you go half the season only having like 1 or 2 wins from your backup, it just puts way too much pressure on Kari and he can't be expected to have a 50 win season. If Enroth can keep up what he was doing at the end of the season, I think the goaltending situation will be just fine next year"

DallasStars,36auzu,Geoslug,4,Mon May 18 01:37:53 2015 UTC,Kane and Toews are far more likeable than Perry and Getz. And I like Hossa. A Chicago-Tampa final with Tampa winning would be my preference.

Not sure what we'd give up to get him - certainly not Honka, but maybe Jokipakka or Oleksiak and a lower pick or something since the Leafs want picks and young guys for the rebuild."
DallasStars,367f57,kinetek,3,Sun May 17 03:05:53 2015 UTC,"How about we DONT trade Oleksiak, Honka, or Jokipakka. I for one would prefer two strong D lines (with the Berger) than to trade for a goalie that may or may not be any better than guys in our system (Campbell)."

But I think it's not playing to his strengths. The play-by-play guy has to be a little more ""straight man"". There's no time to get verbose and you can't get too eccentric without distracting from the play.  The analyst job affords Razor the opportunity to be the eccentric linguist we all know and love during the little breaks in action. I'd much rather see the Stars keep Razor as the color guy and get a new play-by-play voice in there."

DallasStars,3656ib,bigblueballz77,2,Sat May 16 06:45:37 2015 UTC,"We had a thread about this the other week shortly after Detroit was eliminated. The majority opinion seems to rest near a snowball's chance in hell, with a vocal minority in favor of a knee-jerk booting Ruff after a single playoff-missing season purely because ""muh Red Wings dynasty"" and ""The totally obvious connection"" with Jim Nill.  I will say now what I said then: If Babcock's contract had been up right after we booted Gulutzan, then it might be a real possibility. The fact is that Ruff is a perfectly respectable coach who is only two years into his contract, he's 50/50 at making the playoffs, and we're still in the midst of a rebuild. I don't think Babcock is coming to Dallas, at least not as a franchise employee."
DallasStars,3656ib,Kitten_Hammer,4,Sat May 16 08:38:19 2015 UTC,"Dallas is a definite possibility drawn up due to the obvious detroit connection between our GM and Babcock. We're also a team that feels like were in a similar place Babcock might be looking for with loads of potential and players hes coached on Team Canada.  I put us in contention for Babcock, but at a under a 5% chance something actually happens."

No sense in dumping Ruff if Babcock isn't a sure thing though. And with as many teams that are going to be heavily pursuing Babcock, I doubt it's ever a sure thing. Ruff is fine."

DallasStars,35v9wk,thestarsarebright,10,Wed May 13 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have him back if he got the all clear (from multiple doctors). His two-way game is exactly what the Stars need more of in their forward group, particularly in the top 6. Plus, his faceoff ability would take the Stars from good faceoff team to scary good faceoff team (though both their ""aces"" would be right shots).  And this is kinda callous, but you figure he'd be available for way under market for his skills given the health risks involved."
DallasStars,35v9wk,scoutcjustice,5,Wed May 13 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"Can we re-sign him contingent on a comeback so he doesn't go UFA? I'd love to see him play again, and I'd love it even more if it was with us."
DallasStars,35v9wk,trex20,5,Wed May 13 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's possible to make a contract contingent on something like that.  Technically we could go ahead and re-sign him and if he couldn't come back his cap hit would go under LTIR. But there are downsides to LTIR cap hits and the team is still spending the money (unless they got insurance on the contract, but I'm guessing insurance would cost a ton if it was available at all considering the circumstances).  If a comeback happens, I'd expect Peverley to get a professional try out contract for training camp and preseason with a team (hopefully us) and then get signed if he makes it through that. So he'll probably hit UFA. But I think the Stars get the first shot if they're interested."
DallasStars,35v9wk,scoutcjustice,3,Wed May 13 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"He seems to like it here, working with the Texas Stars and everything. I hope he stays."
DallasStars,35v9wk,trex20,1 point,Wed May 13 23:52:17 2015 UTC,Personally I'd like to see something in his contract where if he has problems again he becomes a coach for Texas or something.
DallasStars,35v9wk,Rinnosuke,4,Fri May 15 03:30:37 2015 UTC,"All The Info Per McKenzie:   * It's been 14+ months since Rich Peverley's life was saved when heart stopped during NHL game. He MAY now be in position to consider comeback  * Peverley's agent Allain Roy said M.D.s suggested Peverley's implanted defib device may be able to be removed, paving way for possible return  * Peverley still needs to see more doctors and there would need to be work done with NHL and NHLPA on insurance waiver issues...  * ...but, for now anyway, the story is that some encouraging medical news has Peverley at least looking hard at the possibility of comeback.  * Peverley's contract with DAL expires June 30, so if he can overcome medical/insurance hurdles, he could be UFA this summer."
DallasStars,35v9wk,k1279,2,Wed May 13 20:25:06 2015 UTC,"Those first two tweets no longer exist. I wonder if McKenzie deleted them for some reason. I found it interesting he capitalized ""MAY"" in the first one and then said Peverley's agent ""suggested"" in the second one. That's some pretty careful use of emphasis and language. Maybe he wasn't careful enough."

DallasStars,35spen,salapeno,6,Wed May 13 12:50:13 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's the plan. Shared facilities for both teams. Minor renovations required behind the scenes, and scheduling will probably be a bit nuts, but hopefully it doesn't negatively affect the ice quality or anything."
DallasStars,35spen,K_ARRRR,5,Wed May 13 13:09:31 2015 UTC,Is this not supposed to be a temporary arrangement until a new location is found?
DallasStars,35spen,salapeno,4,Wed May 13 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"Originally the plan was temporary stop in Winnipeg until Thunder Bay could build an arena, but the funding there fell through and it doesn't seem like there's a prayer for that arena now.   Once management started looking at it as a potential long term move, they started seeing the value in it as a permanent solution, and now I believe the intent is to keep it here unless it ends up being a financial liability, but it sounds like it should be break even or slightly profitable."

DallasStars,35ket4,SeniorSophomore,13,Mon May 11 05:19:51 2015 UTC,"Sit down because this is gonna be a wild ride.  Benn/Seguin are the big two, as you are clearly already aware. Since I assume you know a fair amount about them I'll sum it up with the fact that they're both top-ten (top-five when one of them is not injured, looking at you Seggy) scorers with a Big Texas Bromance and Benn the Younger is the heart and soul of the team. I could honestly go on about either of them forever but we'll move on.  The following is a list of most of the players, the order of which I made up as I went along.  The big players:  Jason Spezza (C): Spezza was last summer's big offseason acquisition. He's the 1b center to Seguin's 1a, although at times he's served on the first line and Segs was shifted to RW to create the Superline. The Superline is not really a feasible long-term solution to some of the holes we've faced, but it is very, very fun to watch. He took a little time to find his groove with the younger, faster system, but his leadership is very valuable and he's found his stride imo. He's signed on for 4 more years so go get your #90 jersey today. Seriously, right now. I'll wait.  Val Nichushkin (W): 2013's first round draft pick. He's big, fast, and scary. He was out with a hip injury for approximately 99% of the season so we haven't really gotten to see what he's capable of this year but he was great last year so suffice to say it's exciting, especially now that he can speak English at a reasonable level. Also, if you're a twitter fan you should immediately go to @ImValNichushkin because it is comedy gold.  John Klingberg (D): Beautiful cinnamon roll too good for this world, too pure. I honestly really want to leave it there but I guess I'll explain that he's something of a defensive wunderkind and is the future of the Stars D line. His composure is out of this world, especially for a rookie. Also he's a Right-Hand Shot, which makes him a Rare and Precious Unicorn. I love him. Everyone loves him. You will love him. We just signed him for 7 years on the cheap and I literally wept tears of joy. Forget that #90 jersey, go get a #3.  Cody Eakin (C): Traditionally our third line C but the Ginger Ninja has been getting some play up and down the lineup in the last year. He's adaptive, which is his major strength. He can center Benn and Seguin or the Pit Bulls, he fights for the puck, and he's got a pretty decent shot. Importantly, he's been consistently improving in the faceoff circle. I like Eakin a lot but also personally feel as though he could be a highly-valued trade chip.  Antoine Roussel (W): Rooster is a fan favorite because he's a gritty, hard-working agitator who (usually) knows what lines not to cross, unlike frequent linemate Ryan Garbutt, who we'll get to. He goes hard to the net, will drop the gloves when he needs to, and he's a genuinely nice guy off the ice. Once I was in the team tunnel before a game and he fist bumped me and my friend and said ""Ladies, how's it going?"" with a wink so I've got that going for me.  Kari Lehtonen (G): Our number one goalie, for now. I'm pretty much as hard core of a Kari supporter as you can find (I have a signed Kari jersey), but I'm pretty disillusioned with him at the moment. He has stretches where he makes elite saves and stretches where he might as well not be in net. He's got limited playoff experience and sort of choked last year (I don't want to talk about it). I'd love to see him make a comeback, but I fear his time with the organization may be drawing to a close (assuming we can ever find a new number one goalie which is, frankly, not all that likely anytime soon so we're probs stuck with Lehts and everyone's just gonna be kinda butt hurt about it).  Trevor Daley (D): One of our nominal top-two D-men. He's pretty productive offensively, but leaves something to be desired defensively. For some reason no one in the actual Stars organization seems to be able to see that he's not good defensively because they're blinded by his shiny 16 goals, and it's becoming a bit of an issue.  Alex Goligoski (D): Our other nominal top-two D-man. He's less problematic than Daley, and a pretty serviceable top-four D-man, but we probably rely on him a bit heavily.  Ales Hemsky (W): The other big offseason acquisition from last summer. He had a very hard time hitting his stride and producing with us this year, despite preexisting chemistry with Spezza. However, he started to get better at finishing towards the end of the season, and his full year of chemistry-building will ideally help him start off next season a bit more quickly. I still have high hopes for Hemmer as he's got a lot of skill and had so, so many instances of almost-but-not-quite and just some really bad luck. I'm rooting for you, Hemmer.  Some other guys:  Jason Demers (D): Acquired from the Sharks near the beginning of the season for Brendan Dillon. He's a pretty solid D-man and, excitingly, a Right-Hand Shot. These are Rare and Precious, as mentioned above. For some reason, his nickname is Daddy. We inherited this from his time with the Sharks so there's no point trying to change it, like when you adopt a dog that's a few years old and already knows his name and won't respond to anything else. He also once wore an all-pink suit to an event, and it's iconic.  Vernon Fiddler (C): Vern is a great veteran presence on the team and still manages to be relatively productive. He usually hangs out on the fourth line but has been known to shift around a bit. It feels like he's always there when you really need him. Plus he took a bit of a pay cut to stay here in Dally after testing free agency last offseason. He went to George Strait's last concert and caught George's cowboy hat, so he is, by extension, Texas Royalty.  Shawn Horcoff (C): Another great veteran presence who is still semi-productive. Towards the end of the season Horc was a fixture on a line with Ritchie and McKenzie (see below) and essentially took on the role of their personal coach. He's doing wonders for those kids' development and imo he's worth it essentially for that alone. Plus he's a great guy to have in the locker room.  Jordie Benn (D): Benn the Elder, also known as the Bearded Benn. Jordie worked his way up from the ECHL to the AHL and finally to join his baby brother in the NHL. Jordie is... not as good as his brother. He's a pretty serviceable bottom-pairing D, and he's been much better since spending most of his time with the more defensively-responsible Daddy. He typically has some trouble at the start of the season, and he has some really terrible luck. He tends to get scapegoated a bit (I am personally real guilty of this) but he's not, like, terrible, or anything. He cleaned up his act a bit towards the end of the season.   Colton Sceviour (C): Scevs is a pretty promising young forward who often hung out at wing as the third wheel on the Benn-Seguin line, when he earns it. He's fun to watch and will probably be a perenniel third-liner eventually.  Patrick Eaves (W): Eaves was sort of a throwaway acquisition who turned out to be really awesome. When not injured, he was up and down the lineup filling in wherever he was needed. If I remember correctly I think he only has a 1-year contract but I'd personally love to see him come back for round 2.  Ryan Garbutt (W): Ah, Garbutt. The third member of the Pit Bulls (see Roussel, Eakin), he is a bit problematic. He takes much stupider penalties than Rous, and he takes them more often, and he gets suspended with frustrating regularity. When he's not getting into trouble, he's a pretty useful forward but he isn't worth the hassle.  Jhonas Enroth (G): Our rental backup goalie. He's pretty good but was not the cure we were looking for at the end of the year. Not sure if he'll stick around or not.  Travis Moen (W): Another offseason acquisition that went pretty well. He's nothing particularly special, but he's been useful.  The Young Guys:  Jyrki Jokipakka (D): Possibly the funnest name to say in all of hockey. He's a promising D-man who's had his ups and downs this season, but I'd say he's on the upswing.  Jamie Oleksiak (D): He is a very large human, which may be why his nickname is Big Rig. His big drawback is that he doesn't know how to use his size effectively, and a little under half a season at the NHL level was not enough to teach him. I'm getting a little disillusioned with him, but if he can figure it out he'll have a nice future ahead of him.  Brett Ritchie (W): Brett Ritchie is Bae. While not phenomenal, he had a pretty strong showing with the Big Club and he's gonna be a big part of our future going forward. Kid's fun to watch and has some size on him.   Curtis McKenzie (W): Curtis is like Antoine Roussel, Jr. He's gritty, hardworking, ready for a fight, and a lot of fun to watch. While maybe not possessing as much raw skill as some of the other kids, he's a great piece to have.  Patrik Nemeth (D): Nemeth was one of the most exciting defensive prospects, having had an impressive run in playoffs last year. We were all hella excited to see him this year... until his arm got grotesquely slashed in a really early game. He fought hard to get back to the ice in time for the final stretch of games, but nearly a full season in physical therapy stalled his development a bit and he didn't quite live up to the hype. I'm excited to see what he's like next season once he's had some time.  Jack MF Campbell (G): To date, JC has only played one game with the Big Club, but he's the Goalie Prospect of the Future. He's had a rough go this year, once even being assigned to the ECHL to kick him in the pants a bit. He's an even more mental goalie than Kari I think, and keeping him mentally healthy can be challenging. But he's promising, and exciting, and young."

DallasStars,35bv6u,rws,3,Sat May 9 04:42:53 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù, ‚ÄúI'm‚Äù, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

Late round pick, bit of a slow developer but then evolved into one of the best defensemen in his European pro league.  I don't know if he has Klingberg's upside, but it's hard not to be excited about Lindell."

DallasStars,34pyvb,DanielTheFreak,3,Sun May 3 15:03:11 2015 UTC,GINGER NINJAAAA!   I turned on the game and he scored twice. Gonna have to watch more games! :)   Also thanks Grizzy. You're the best!

DallasStars,34pyvb,OrganicRedditor,2,Sun May 3 22:49:12 2015 UTC,Where has Seguin been hiding?
DallasStars,34pyvb,brickwall5,1 point,Sun May 3 23:02:11 2015 UTC,He's playing.  There aren't any pics and he hasn't scored.  Here's the game sheet: http://stats.iihf.com/Hydra/414/IHM414A13_74_3_0.pdf
DallasStars,34pyvb,OrganicRedditor,2,Mon May 4 07:47:15 2015 UTC,"I know, I just meant it doesn't seem like he's been doing all that much."
DallasStars,34pyvb,brickwall5,1 point,Mon May 4 14:57:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think he has either.  He's had the ice time.  Spezza has been the gem for the team, he and Eakin.  Maybe today will be his day."
DallasStars,34pyvb,OrganicRedditor,1 point,Tue May 5 06:02:40 2015 UTC,Bottom of the barrel scoring 2 goals in a game... Must be a fluke  /sarcasm
DallasStars,34r808,StephasaurusRexy,3,Sun May 3 21:28:55 2015 UTC,I feel like the answer is a resounding no...
DallasStars,34onoz,grapesourstraws,6,Sun May 3 02:53:24 2015 UTC,He had a nice series of tweets right after it was announced
DallasStars,34onoz,glacierfanclub,3,Sun May 3 03:38:17 2015 UTC,"Oh! Wow totally forgot about Twitter, thank you!"
DallasStars,34onoz,StephasaurusRexy,6,Sun May 3 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"Also, bonus Razor question. Is he doing any work for the playoffs this year on NBC or anything? I have mainly been watching the Sportsnet feeds on gamecenter (and boy some of the announcers, like the play-by-play guy from last night's Chicago/Minnesota game, are so boring and weak)."
DallasStars,34onoz,YankeeBravo,5,Sun May 3 02:55:23 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I think he's just enjoying his offseason for now. He'll probably be involved in the search for Ralph's replacement
DallasStars,34onoz,StephasaurusRexy,2,Sun May 3 05:39:20 2015 UTC,I don't think there's going to be much of a search.   I suspect they'll just move Owen Newkirk from the intermission/post-game show to Ralph's seat.
DallasStars,34onoz,YankeeBravo,2,Sun May 3 12:00:42 2015 UTC,"Did he do the PXP for the Texas Stars last season (2013-2014)? I can't remember. If so, I can see them doing that though Dallas is a big place and there may be someone with a bit more experience."
DallasStars,34onoz,pitcher_10,1 point,Sun May 3 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"Owen did call plays for the baby Stars, yes. So he has some experience with it."
