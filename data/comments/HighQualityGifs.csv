HighQualityGifs,3dv2vz,nuinbot,3,Mon Jul 20 04:58:50 2015 UTC,A pre-congratulations on getting your friend fired.
HighQualityGifs,3dv2vz,oscar2hot4u,5,Mon Jul 20 03:51:31 2015 UTC,That's one way to look at it. I prefer to think of it as an avenue for self advancement.
HighQualityGifs,3dwggb,__PETTYOFFICER117__,9,Mon Jul 20 02:41:02 2015 UTC,"I've been around this sub for about 8 months, and I'll admit, in that time I've become a gif-snob.  When I browse the rest of the site I talk mad shit to myself about the plethora of shitty gifs that get posted everywhere else."
HighQualityGifs,3dwggb,ChemicalOle,6,Mon Jul 20 03:00:09 2015 UTC,That is why I have so many remakes posted.  I'll see on over in /r/reactiongifs or some other sub and I will look through the comments for the source or I'll try and find it myself.  An Example: http://i.imgur.com/LvgjLpv.gifv  From : http://redd.it/3dri55
HighQualityGifs,3dwggb,Butcher_Of_Hope,5,Mon Jul 20 03:13:09 2015 UTC,It's like they've never heard of a frame rate > 15.
HighQualityGifs,3dwggb,ChemicalOle,3,Mon Jul 20 03:22:23 2015 UTC,It's like they don't even care.   Question for you: Is there a reason you prefer gfycat to imgur for your uploads? Just curious.
HighQualityGifs,3dwggb,ifindkarma,3,Mon Jul 20 07:05:57 2015 UTC,"When the html5 thing was just catching on, there were still problems with .gifv working correctly with my browser, mobile, and RES. So I started using gfycat because it seemed to have the fewest bugs.  I also prefer the user interface of gfycat and the fact that you can upload video directly. Imgur requires you to link video from a web address. I've started converting all my work to .webm and skipping the .gif step so I don't have to dither/index to 256 colors (the dithering in GIMP is really crappy), so gfycat is much more convenient.  I use gfycat for gif/webm and imgur for static images."
HighQualityGifs,3dwggb,ChemicalOle,3,Mon Jul 20 07:16:39 2015 UTC,"Makes sense to me, Ole. Thank you!"
HighQualityGifs,3dwggb,ifindkarma,3,Mon Jul 20 07:33:55 2015 UTC,Thank you for the Grace Helbig remake.   I never tire of your remakes.
HighQualityGifs,3dwggb,ifindkarma,3,Mon Jul 20 07:04:54 2015 UTC,What drives me insane is the use of a shittier gif over a HQ gif that's been posted in the other gif subs where just about everyone can see it.

HighQualityGifs,3dtye8,Ishnuporah,47,Sun Jul 19 13:04:16 2015 UTC,I'm always curious when I see this version of this scene to know where the OP got it. The US version of this scene has the letters F U C K Y O and the inverted tooth makes the U. Maybe this is the TV edit or does N O M E T A U mean something?  Maybe the OP was going to NO META U? Only /u/Ishnuporah knows.

HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,caldera,5,Sun Jul 19 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"But yishan did not say it was a conspiracy. Yes, it was a gross misunderstanding by Redditors that Ellen was solely to blame for Reddit's problems but that does not mean that people within Reddit conspired to have her take the fall for their decisions or to make Redditors hate her."

HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,NovaeDeArx,81,Sun Jul 19 23:45:51 2015 UTC,"The board was behind the removal of hate subs, like FPH. Pao was actually against removing them because she knew how the community would react. She was forced to do it anyway and then the people threw hissy fits and started spamming the site with misogynistic, racist, and downright hateful things about her without knowing what the facts were to the point of her stepping down as CEO.   Now that she is gone, and there's nobody at the top fighting to stop the removal of hate subs, they are planning on doing a sweeping cleanse of the site.   TL;DR: self-entitled redditors who want reddit to be a bastion of free speech shot themselves in the feet and made matter worse, and they only have themselves to blame."
HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,godot-3000,49,Sun Jul 19 03:36:24 2015 UTC,"You're giving Yishan a ton of credibility here, given that he was pretty close to Pao and may also be disgruntled after his own firing for unprofessional behavior..."
HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,rootoftruth,18,Sun Jul 19 04:15:50 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but he decided it would be a good idea to not bring up highly relevant information when it was most important?  Did he think it was better timing to inform the community of Pao's lack of involvement after she steps down?  He actually hasn't supplied any evidence (to my knowledge) -- just made assertions, which redditors with a sympathetic ideology are taking as fact (i.e. this thread)."
HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,nomofica,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:40:20 2015 UTC,"He might not have been able to discuss the issue until her firing for professional reasons. The board might have accused Yishan of operating as a proxy for Ellen Pao to get her side out. Of course, both sides are based on assumptions right now. It's certain though that reddit took the anti-Pao comments way too far since we barely had anything to support our accusations."
HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,HAL9000000,26,Sun Jul 19 12:54:29 2015 UTC,He has more credibility than 99% of the people on this website. I'd put more weight on his words than the words of some random person on the internet with no actual knowledge of how reddit is managed behind closed doors.
HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,CameraMan1,6,Sun Jul 19 04:46:49 2015 UTC,He may have skewed knowledge of what goes on behind closed doors.

HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,hextree,3,Sun Jul 19 14:47:24 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking they got Pao fired so that they could publicize to the news in a more interesting way, and have them criticize our website giving the admins an excuse to put more rules in place."
HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,nothinbuttherain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:33:14 2015 UTC,"and they only have themselves to blame   Why? They acted on what information they had. If they genuinely thought that Pao was behind this, I don't see why the shouldn't have reacted so."
HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,probably2high,3,Sun Jul 19 10:44:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the key might be to not assume you have all the information regarding what goes on in corporate planning sessions and board meetings just because you've been given a few of the pieces and extrapolated the rest.  I'm neither pro nor anti Pao.  And as the figurehead of the company she may still have been the correct focus for the ire of redditors.  But I suspect that for many people she was the target because she was the name and face they knew, and it was cool to hate her for awhile."
HighQualityGifs,3drqzm,nxqv,3,Sun Jul 19 12:21:11 2015 UTC,"They overreacted based on what little information they had, as per the usual behavior of a group of salty teenagers.  The subs that will inevitably be banned contribute relatively nothing that will be missed."

HighQualityGifs,3dhknz,skai762,5,Thu Jul 16 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"A) that's not how acronyms work. PETA isn't pronounced Pehta, JPEG isn't Jayfeg, and SCUBA isn't Scubba. Please stop using this stupid, erroneous argument.  B) he doesn't have to be a linguist, it's his invention, he gets to call it and pronounce it however he wants. If you tried to go to Google.com by typing in Googol.com because that's how it should be spelled, you'd be just as wrong as trying to pronounce Gif like gift. If you mispronounce a manmade technology nearly 30 years after it's been made and christened to be pronounced a certain way, you're wrong.

HighQualityGifs,3dhknz,onedrummer2401,19,Thu Jul 16 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, from a linguistic point of view, you're wrong that he's objectively wrong about the pronunciation, just like he's wrong that you're wrong.   just because someone coins a word or term, that doesn't mean that they get to prescriptively decide how it is pronounced in perpetuity. Usages evolve and change. the majority of people (by about 2:1) pronounce it with a hard G instead of a soft G. This indicates that if we were to incorporate this as a word in a standard dictionary, such as the OED, they would take the most popular spelling and pronunciation and list it first (hard G gif) and then the next most popular second (soft G jiff). Words can have more than one accepted way to pronounce them. There's even popular sayings to that effect. Potayto Potahto, for example.   So, the other guy isn't ""objectively wrong"" just like you're not ""objectively wrong"".  Both pronunciations are acceptable. Now would everybody just SHUT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK UP ABOUT IT because it's possibly the least important discussion in the history of the fucking universe."

HighQualityGifs,3dihwm,Aethelric,5,Fri Jul 17 05:30:33 2015 UTC,"The reason this is a joke, and a funny joke, is because there's an exaggeration. A huge exaggeration. This takes it out of the realm of the real and into the realm of the humorous. Therefore, you don't have to be offended or afraid. The purpose of this joke isn't to trivialize what transgender people go through any more than the purpose of a knock knock joke is to trivialize what it's like to be a door."
HighQualityGifs,3dihwm,3jt,14,Fri Jul 17 07:23:40 2015 UTC,"So if I say ""literally all black people love watermelon and fried chicken"", it's not offensive because it contains an enormous exaggeration that puts it in the ""realm of the humorous""?   purpose of this joke isn't to trivialize what transgender people   The origin of the joke was to make fun of trans and non-binary people. I've repeatedly seen trans people recognize the ""joke"" as yet another attack on their identities.  It's not as though trans people receive so much support and reassurance about their gender identity that a joke told a million times at their expense is really justifiable."
HighQualityGifs,3dihwm,Aethelric,3,Fri Jul 17 08:58:18 2015 UTC,I think this is more a joke about attention seeking behaviors of tween otherkin-style self-identification. It can be read as offensive by the trans community but I read it in an entirely different way.
HighQualityGifs,3dihwm,stuperdude,3,Fri Jul 17 11:37:30 2015 UTC,Read the link! It was never about otherkin; that's just a justification added well after the fact. Not that tween otherkin-style self-identification even really exists beyond a handful of people on the internet.
HighQualityGifs,3dihwm,Aethelric,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:30:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, the link doesn't say any of that. It says it's making fun of ""gender identity politics"" which reasonably includes the context I mentioned. I'd be willing to bet that my interpretation is the most common, especially in the halls of reddit."
HighQualityGifs,3dihwm,stuperdude,3,Fri Jul 17 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"Otherkin have nothing to do with gender. The fact that you think the two issues have any relation is precisely why this ""joke"" isn't as harmless as Reddit wants to believe. The joke constantly comes up in situations regarding trans issues, women's representation, and other things that have absolutely nothing to do with otherkin. Conflating trans and genderfluid identities with otherkin is definitely transphobic, and patently ridiculous."
HighQualityGifs,3dihwm,Aethelric,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:08:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, calm down. It's a gif. I'm not trying to conflate trans people with otherkins. I'm just trying to relate to you the way I read the joke so that you could get off your high horse and try to have a laugh."

HighQualityGifs,3dj7ts,jimlast3,3,Thu Jul 16 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"During the resizing you used cubic interpolation. Do you know what's the difference between the dotherones ?  Optimize difference compares each pixel, optimize for gif compares ~9x9pixel blocks and. I think you can use it before you convert to indexed colour but I'm not sure exactly."
HighQualityGifs,3dj7ts,Karbonatom,2,Thu Jul 16 22:10:49 2015 UTC,"Interpolation. This drop-down list lets you choose the method and thus the quality of the transformation:  None. The color of each pixel is copied from its closest neighboring pixel in the original image. This often results in aliasing (the “stair-step” effect) and a coarse image, but it is the fastest method. Sometimes this method is called “Nearest Neighbor”.  Linear. The color of each pixel is computed as the average color of the four closest pixels in the original image. This gives a satisfactory result for most images and is a good compromise between speed and quality. Sometimes this method is called “Bilinear”.  Cubic. The color of each pixel is computed as the average color of the eight closest pixels in the original image. This usually gives a good result, but it naturally takes more time. Sometimes this method is called “Bicubic”.  Sinc (Lanczos3) The Lanczos3 method uses the Sinc mathematical function and performs a high quality interpolation. This is usually the best method but if you are not satisfied with the result, you may give “Cubic” a try.  You can set the default interpolation method in the Tools Options Preferences dialog.   http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tools-transform.html  Some things I've read say use linear when shrinking an image and cubic when enlarging.   Other things I've read say use cubic all the time for best results.   I've never really noticed a difference, so I just always use cubic."

I'm sure when Ellen was just a middle-income undergrad at Princeton, living in a tiny dorm and surrounded by kids more privileged than her, she was a decent human being. She's a horrible person now, she was horrible before she got hired, and whether or not she was a scapegoat doesn't change any of that.  I don't think anyone could do a worse job than yishan, and a McDonald's manager is held to a higher standard of professionalism than the reddit CEO. What they need to do is drop the salary to something under $100k and hire a normal person, no stock options or profit sharing. incentive to monetize the shit out of reddit as fast as possible, because when the place turns to shit and everyone leaves it's game is over.  Yeah then we can trust someone to just do a normal fucking job. Of course this won't happen, meh."

HighQualityGifs,3dd108,sg_med_student,9,Thu Jul 16 00:49:04 2015 UTC,"What happened to reddit is what happens to all social networks (even offline ones). At first, it can be appealing because it's novel and stocked only with other people who caught on to a good thing early, but it's too small to be of much use. Then it hits a golden age where it's big enough to be useful, but still too small and little known to attract a big, mainstream audience.  But, if a social network keeps growing, like reddit has, eventually a wider audience becomes aware of it: trolls, bigots, wackos, etc. In Usenet slang this event is known as Eternal September, in rememberence of September 1993 when AOL started offering usenet acces to its users.  Today, you have to retreat to smaller subreddits to hide from the unwashed masses. This place has become so big and well known that it's basically unavoidable now that it will either be monetized or collapse (and possibly both like Digg). I think it's highly unlikely to become self-policing or self-owned (although that would be nice). But, netizens like me will do what we've always done. Tossed away our comment history and set out in search of greener pastures. And then the cycles repeats.  edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQD-dXfHrvk"

What a raw deal."

In addition, the popular quote of Ellen saying ""they'll take this company from my cold dead hands"" comes from him and solely him, casting doubt that she ever said that, either."

HighQualityGifs,3dg7dj,ChemicalOle,7,Thu Jul 16 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"So if you make gifs in GIMP, you probably know that before you can export as a .gif you have to convert from RGB mode to Indexed mode due to the 256 color limit of the gif format.  The problem is, the dithering tool in GIMP is inferior to what Photoshop can do and your gifs can end up looking kind of crappy (depending on the color pallete).  I figured out a way to skip that step!  Actually you will export frames from GIMP to .avi then use a video converter to go to .webm which you can upload to gfycat without a loss in quality.  NOTE: This will only work where you can use "".webm"" or gfy. If you have to post something as a "".gif"" you'll have to do it the old way.  You need the Gimp Animation Package (GAP) plugin.   First split your video into frames and import as layers in GIMP like usual. Do your normal scaling, cropping, and text/effects. Then when you get to the point where you would normally convert from RGB to Indexed (256 color dither), instead convert straight to video. Go to ""Video"" --> ""Master Videoencoder""  http://i.imgur.com/taYt5Ee.png   Be sure to adjust the framerate... it defaults to 1 fps. You can set the input mode to ""layers"" or ""frames."" If you choose frames your layers need to be named ""frame####"" e.g. ""frame_001"" ""frame_002"" etc."" Click the ""parameters"" button and use these settings:  http://i.imgur.com/Lat2ENW.png   Be sure to adjust the quality to 100 (it defaults to 84). Use the video converter of your choice to convert the .avi to .webm (I'm on Linux so I use ffmpeg).   Cheers!"
HighQualityGifs,3dg7dj,jimlast3,8,Thu Jul 16 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"...inferior to Photoshop   The best dithering for .gif would probably be imagemagick (also open source)   For avi with GAP ,somewhere in those parameters or maybe the extras tab if you set the keyframe interval to 99999999 and b-frames to 0, you'll have an avi ready for breaking in avidmux or whatever  You should post this in /r/giftutorials"

HighQualityGifs,3d9kus,nothinbuttherain,3,Tue Jul 14 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It started in the 80's and grew in popularity in the 90's. I'm not exactly sure why, but it was just another form of entertainment in a time when the internet wasn't really good for much entertainment besides just chat rooms. Not much you can do with dial-up and a 28.8 bps modem. I guess slam poetry was a popular form of interaction and expressing yourself then like making memes and gifs are now. I'm a 90's kid (36 y.o. now) and saw it performed, but was never interested in doing it myself."

So I'm just getting that out there ahead of time.  Does your answer essentially boil down to ""There wasn't much to do on the internet back then so slam poetry made more sense as a pasttime""?  I mean - it wasn't the 1890s.  (Child of the 70's here - and there was lots more to do besides slam poetry even then.)  :-)"
HighQualityGifs,3d9kus,Carter52,3,Fri Jul 17 18:55:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that there wasn't much to do.

HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,whycuthair,56,Mon Jul 13 15:53:42 2015 UTC,I'm relieved the top post is some stranger. This sub is basically a circlejerk surrounding the same people
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,Dharmasabitch,20,Mon Jul 13 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression this was basically an 'official' circlejerk sub in everything but name. Which is great, it's definitely the best circlejerk sub."
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,AOBCD-8663,11,Mon Jul 13 23:12:57 2015 UTC,It was very different when it first started.  Then a few guys really ran with it.  Yada yada yada. Here we are.
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,matt01ss,8,Mon Jul 13 23:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yea, back when there were only a handful of us making the gifs, now there are dozens and dozens, it's grown so much."
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,AOBCD-8663,5,Mon Jul 13 23:52:09 2015 UTC,"There are still the few power users that fill out most of what I end up seeing and meta content seems to get disproportionately lifted.  I'd love if the meta gifs were kept more to giftournament or to a certain day,  but as long as the source is in the comments,  I'm not looking a gif horse in the mouth."
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,jimlast3,6,Tue Jul 14 00:20:01 2015 UTC,There's [no meta Tuesday] now the titles are still meta but the gif it self isn't I usulty don't read titles anyway
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,elfa82,2,Tue Jul 14 02:42:33 2015 UTC,You really should sort the sub by new and check out all/most posts daily. There's some seriously great stuff that gets posted but because someone else's post got the top spot it mainly goes unnoticed.
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,matt01ss,10,Tue Jul 14 06:58:16 2015 UTC,"At some point I'm going to write a copy pasta to use in reply to these comments, but to sum it up:  Browse the sub, look at all the other posts here, 80% are not meta posts, but these posts don't get upvoted. The #1 post for the day will probably be meta with 2000 upvotes, while post #2 which is non-meta will have maybe 80 votes at times.  The community upvotes these meta posts, we can't control the content here (other than establishing non-meta tuesday). The non-meta posts simply do not get the love they deserve and then everyone complains that meta posts are dominating the sub.    You can even use me as an example. Here's my recent post history here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/search?q=author%3Amatt01ss&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all  The top is the most recent post. Look at the vote numbers and the first one you see over 1000 is a meta post about E&L."

HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,ifindkarma,6,Tue Jul 14 02:05:18 2015 UTC,It would be... Magic!

HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,beagleboyj2,3,Tue Jul 14 00:44:10 2015 UTC,They could easily enforce a repost rule. Anything reposted in the last 6 months will be removed? Tons of subs do that and it usually keeps the OC up and the meta posts down to a comfortable level.
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,elfa82,2,Tue Jul 14 02:50:03 2015 UTC,"While I see where you are coming from in regards to non-OC, it also helps us make sure that sub isn't over run by users that constantly post other people's content. If that was the case, we'd have power users posting gifs made by users that only used imgur, rather than forcing those users to expand and start becoming part of the community here."
HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,beagleboyj2,2,Tue Jul 14 02:51:28 2015 UTC,That makes sense.

HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,badmonkey0001,3,Tue Jul 14 07:16:48 2015 UTC,"The OC only rule helps us maintain a community of creators here. That's why it's vital. In fact, if you wanted to learn how you'll find this sub full of creators willing to give you advice and help. It's what got me into making HQ rather than just shit GIFs.  The meta GIFs actually reflect that sense of community among us creators. We help each other out as much as we razz each other. There are very few subs for a GIF creator to go to that have such a genuine and constructive core membership. If that changed, I'd be done with this place just like I'm done with /r/gifs and /r/funny.  Also, /u/ifindkarma is a special case because he supported many of us in very meaningful ways as the sub grew. He earned that privilege through hard work, good critiques, helping us deal with hosting at times, and generally being a shining example of a good user. In fact, when I first got here he acted as a greeter to me and helped introduce me to the sub way early on. I can pretty much guarantee no other users will ever be granted that privilege. You insulting a cherished member of this sub and a good friend to me because you're annoyed with something else offends me. That's the only bullshit I see on that point."

HighQualityGifs,3d4hup,badmonkey0001,2,Tue Jul 14 07:14:36 2015 UTC,I'm willing to call a truce. :) Sorry. You really touched a nerve with that bit.  I'm all for discussing meta. The idea of losing the OC rule would be tragic for this sub IMHO. I come here to get away from the defaults and such. It's a really solid creator community and there's nothing else like it online.

If I might make a suggestion, you should check out THIS POST  Your Gif was hard to read because of the speed of the text. I might suggest using a simpler font and simply separating the line ""People"" and ""what a bunch of bastards.""

She actually skips annunciating a little in there, so sorry if it comes off sloppy looking.  Here's one with timed text for Aughra and a quick shot of Jen to help keep it legible. Here's one with two chunks of text and just Aughra. Enjoy!  If you want the Conjunction bit in there, let me know and I'll get it done later this week.

HighQualityGifs,3d4ox1,AdrianBlake,34,Sun Jul 19 04:20:11 2015 UTC,"In 2010, my daughter was diagnosed with Leukemia. She's doing great now after having gone through chemo treatments for over 3 years. When we first found out that she was sick, I was working for a private company that didn't offer health insurance. I was told by the social workers at the hospital the conditions that I would have to meet to qualify for Medicaid. I made a decent salary, but the end cost of her treatment was 1.25 million dollars! I didn't have a choice and needed the Medicaid, but they had all of these really tight restrictions. I realize that many of their rules are to prevent fraud, but the screening process should be changed and everyone should not just fall into one blanket rule. I had to quit my day job, work part-time nights, and we scraped by for years until she finished her treatment. On top of the worries of taking care of a sick child, the financial strains nearly tore my family apart and only until recently were we able to pick up the pieces and work things out. We're just about back to the way things were before this all happened, but I'm sure the system is still stressing people out to this day."
HighQualityGifs,3d4ox1,smartalecky,19,Mon Jul 13 14:31:36 2015 UTC,"Before someone replies with the question ""Why didn't you just keep your job and get health insurance"", I'm going to take a stab at pre-answering for OP.  If he didn't have insurance when his daughter was diagnosed, then she would fall under the old pre-existing conditions clause in any and all private insurance programs and be ineligible for coverage. Medicaid didn't work that way at the time and would provide coverage for her.  With the current changes made by the ACA, OP would have been able to get a marketplace plan that eliminated pre-existing conditions and would have been able to keep his job and avoid most of the secondary hardships this illness caused."

HighQualityGifs,3d03px,oeberg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:39:50 2015 UTC,it's not even an option on many new car models any longer.   What models? I have a feeling that these are American cars or that American dealerships don't import manuals. I'm not trying to be an asshole or say that automatic sucks or anything. That just sounds so strange to me.
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,RandomRageNet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"The American car market is an entirely different beast. Think about the fact that a good chunk of the country is mountainous or very hilly, where driving a stick is kind of terrible. Then another very large chunk of the country lives in dense urban areas. Driving a stick in NYC, Chicago, or LA traffic would be rage inducing.  Another factor is the popularity of big cars like SUVs and pickup trucks. These are almost never available in a standard -- I think for practicality reasons, since trying to move a vehicle that size with a manual transmission would require a lot more work than your typical compact sedan.  Finally, the American car market is such that many ""Domestic"" vehicles are produced elsewhere (often Mexico), and many ""Foreign"" models are actually built in the US (Toyota and Honda both have extensive manufacturing plants in the country). Plus, cars have to be made specifically for the US market because of regulations, configurations (left-hand drive models with imperial speedometers, please), badging and marketing (What's a Toyota Hilux?), and other concerns.  Sticks are generally most commonly available on compacts and subcompact sedans, and occasionally sports cars (although a lot of those are switching over to flappy-paddle shifters too). But they're not incredibly popular (remember, most of us don't know how to drive them) and you can usually only find a handful in a particular dealership -- they generally exist to bring the starting MSRP of a car down."
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,austin101123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"Uh... Car noob here, what are gears? I think those are the things on the PRNDL?"
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,lemoncaxe,17,Sun Jul 12 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"Imagine riding a bicycle. Your legs are the engine. The tires are on the ground... but how do you transfer your energy from your legs to the road?  So you put your legs on the pedals and start pushing. You're on flat ground and moving the pedals is really easy 'cuz you're in First Gear. It's the little gear. You spin your legs round and round but you don't go very fast, right? You push your legs round and round faster but still.. you just don't go anywhere. Okay, so you shift up -- now you're in Second Gear. It's a little bigger than First so it takes ever-so-slightly longer to spin your legs around but you go a little faster because the energy you're putting out with your legs is spread out over a bigger distance -- it's efficient. Third Gear is a little bigger, Fourth Gear.. Your legs actually move slower because the gear is physically bigger, but you still move faster. If you want go up a hill though, that's super tough in a high gear! So you go back down to First.. your legs have to move a little faster, and you go a little slower, but you can go up the hill because you're not trying to spread out all that leg energy across a big gear. You're doing it in smaller segments.   Okay.. let's turn this bike analogy back to cars. When you're in an automatic, the car takes care of the thinking for you -- but you should always know what's happening with your car, so allow me to explain.  Your legs were the engine, remember? RPMs = rotations per minute = how fast the engine is working. This is different than MPH = miles per hour = how fast the tires are going.  You're in First Gear. You see the little RPM meter at about 2K RPMs and it's super happy to be there. You're on flat ground, going pretty slowly, but you want to speed up. So you push a little more gas into the engine and the needle on the RPMs moves up to 3... 3 1/5.. You can hear the engine working harder (RPM), but you're not really going faster (MPH). So you shift up to Second Gear. The needle goes back down to 2K and you feel that little jolt of the gear shifting and nowwwww you're going faster more efficiently. Move up to Third.. Fourth.. and now it takes less pushing on the gas pedal to keep the car going at high speed. Things just got a ton more efficient. But if you're climbing a big hill, you're car will bog out. It's trying to take a little energy and move it across a physically bigger gear and it just can't do it. So you shift down to First and now it's spinning that energy across a smaller field and taking that hill in smaller chunks of energy.  And that is how it works.   Edit: I realized I should have added that the goal is to keep the bicycle chain/RPMs moving at a constant speed. Small gear = your legs put out a little energy to turn the gear. Big gear = your legs can move slower to keep the chain going at the same speed."
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,WILLYOUSTFU,5,Mon Jul 13 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"Somebody took their adderall today. Hah, just kidding, me too. Good, accessible explanation. I just wanted to add a slightly more technical note that not only does rotational speed get multiplied through the gear ratio, but torque (twisting force) as well. e.g. In my car, 1st gear has a ratio of 3.3 to 1, and the differential is 3.1 to 1, so if I'm in 1st with an engine speed of 4500 rpm (pretty high), my wheels are turning at 4500 / 3.3 / 3.1 = 440 rpm, or with a tire circumference of 6.5 feet, 33 mph. If I make 135 lb-ft of torque at that rpm, I'm delivering 135 * 3.3 * 3.1 lb-ft to the wheels, or 1381 lb-ft. Higher gear ratio at low gears means more torque to get the car moving, and keeps the rpms in a more fuel-efficient range."
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,lemoncaxe,3,Mon Jul 13 10:20:24 2015 UTC,"ha, no Adderall. Just a girl who listened to her dad growing up. Torque has always boggled me mind, though..."
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,WILLYOUSTFU,4,Mon Jul 13 13:19:19 2015 UTC,"Just a girl who listened to her dad growing up.   That's good to hear. A girl I knew once called me about changing a flat tire since she had never done it before. She asked me to teach her instead of doing it for her. People who stopped at the light yelled  awful shit at both of us, like it was some kind of mortal sin for a woman to change a tire. It's weird that people could get so upset about someone doing basic car maintenance."
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,austin101123,2,Sun Jul 12 15:56:24 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they make all cars automatic then?
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,lemoncaxe,6,Sun Jul 12 17:20:54 2015 UTC,"In the US, most cars are automatic. Most people don't want to think about their driving. I have an automatic, but find myself wanting to shift manually because -- as a driver -- I can see that big hill in front of me and know that I need to downshift to get up it. Automatics can't anticipate; they can only react. So as a driver, you have to find a way to increase or decrease the gas you're adding to maintain your speed since you cant force it to change gears."
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,frenchfriedenchilada,8,Sun Jul 12 18:11:35 2015 UTC,Not to mention it's debatably more enjoyable to drive a stick. I recently switched from an auto to a manual transmission and I'm really loving the control I feel.

But with regards to the ""not being able to change gears"", mine had a switch under the accelerator where if you quickly pushed it all the way in, it would shift down to 2nd/3rd and allow for overtaking or epic hill traversal. Handy dandy, do they not have that with autos over there?"
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,Structure3,2,Sun Jul 12 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"The switch was under the accelerator? Can you describe it more, was it paddles you could hit to shift up or down that were on the steering wheel? Or was it like a button? It sounds like something you push with your feet. Could you go up and down the gears and pick which gear ya wanted?"
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,aon9492,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:22:27 2015 UTC,"There wasn't as much choice as that, and it was mostly for accelerating. Say you were doing 50mph in 5th and wanted to overtake, I'd press my foot down quickly on the accelerator (gas pedal, throttle for my friends across the pond) and the transmission would shift down to 3rd to give you more power to accelerate away. Handy feature, I just assumed it was standard in automatics."
HighQualityGifs,3d03px,lemoncaxe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"Like paddle shifting?  Sure,  some cars have it...  It's generally a pricier add-in,  though.

HighQualityGifs,3cw4lm,LTman86,3,Sat Jul 11 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"I think I saw the Top Gear episode on it. I think the main problem was that it was half a door so it was blocking the feet, causing you to have to lift your feet over it. The difference was the disappearing door goes into the chassis below. I think in the Top Gear episode, the problem they were highlighting, was that women wearing dresses or skirts were more likely to flash the paparazzi or people outside due to how they would have to move their feet to get in/out.  The sideways opening door of Kaiser Darrin seems pretty awesome as well.  From the intense online searching I did (quick 5 minute google search before losing interest), I think the main reason these kinds of doors aren't as popular is because they have to make room in the chassis to store them. I believe this affects the protective ability of the chassis. Also the problem of opening door in case of an emergency. In normal cases, rescuers can use the jaws of life (giant cutters thing) to cut the hinges of a door to remove it, whereas these doors kinda slide on a rail into the chassis. Although, I suppose the sliding door on vans present the same problem.  But the website for the Disappearing Car Door says all those problems aren't an issue for their door (crash tested, manual unlock inside & out, structural integrity, etc.), and that was copyrighted in 2008, so I'm curious what they've been up to since then."

HighQualityGifs,3cse39,gunzor,5,Fri Jul 10 17:31:03 2015 UTC,"It has become a shitmeme, you're right. But the basic point is legitimate. Like the Easter Bunny and Santa Clause, many Christians believe the Bible because they've been told it was the word of God from a very young age. Childhood, the brain barely developed, has profound effects on your future beliefs. This is why, despite absolutely no physical evidence for the existence of the Christian God, they can have faith. Because the alternative, that everything they've ever been told is false, is terrifying."
HighQualityGifs,3cse39,36DD,2,Fri Jul 10 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"In this case, I didn't see it as ""god is just as dumb as the tooth fairy,"" which is a crap argument. Instead I thought it was funny play on the fact that parents want their kids to trust and believe them, but also spend their childhoods lying to them and getting them to believe in things which we all know aren't real.  Am Christian, laughed. Well, smiled anway."
HighQualityGifs,3cse39,--Petrichor--,2,Fri Jul 10 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"Were you raised Christian, repeatedly told that the Bible is the word of God? The parallel between Santa and Christianity, is that they both rely on children's half-developed brains to plant the idea. That's why it is much more difficult to convert someone once they've reached adulthood without it."
HighQualityGifs,3cse39,benatat12happy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"1st: That children are willing to believe what they are told is irrelevant. If the two situations were comparable, then adult belief in Santa ought to be relatively close in prevalance to belief in god. Obviously, this is not the case. Plus, the argument is just as applicable to anything else children are told. Not only does that mean that atheist kids are probably not reaching that position through rational thought, it also applies to things like climate change.  2: Converts are almost exclusively adults. Unless a family converts as a whole, not many kids become religious when they weren't before. Many people do become religious later in life though. To deny that is silly.  3: Seriously, you're going to argue that religious people only believe because of underdeveloped brains? As though great minds have never found god, and no sane, rational person can come to a conclusion you disagree with. Wow. Just wow."

HighQualityGifs,3co54h,tburn1,4,Thu Jul 9 15:44:28 2015 UTC,"Basically its a big roundabout with a small one at each entrance/exit.  The idea is you can go either clockwise or anticlockwise, round the big roundabout, by using the small roundabouts. So if you're turning right you can go right at your small roundabout entering the big one, and turn off at the next one you come to, instead of going all the way around.   It does work.

HighQualityGifs,3co54h,dart22,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:00:00 2015 UTC,Basically if you want to go clockwise you go on the outside circle. If you want to go counter-clockwise you go on the inside circle. Before entering one of the five roundabouts you look right for oncoming traffic and then enter when it's clear. It's probably easier to see driving through it than looking at the entire thing.

HighQualityGifs,3co54h,Saigot,2,Thu Jul 9 19:49:40 2015 UTC,round abouts have surperior traffic flow since you don't need to stop as often to enter and exit. The traffic you linked to would be just as bad at a 4-way.  Also round abouts are actually much more difficult to use correctly than 4 way stops.  http://www.treehugger.com/cars/mythbusters-roundabouts-vs-4-way-stop-intersection-which-more-efficient-video.html  http://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/63/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-a-traffic-circle-versus-a-traffic-light-intersecti
HighQualityGifs,3co54h,happycrabeatsthefish,-2,Fri Jul 10 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"The traffic you linked to would be just as bad at a 4-way.   That much traffic would merit a traffic light. 4 way stops are for low traffic areas that could require a traffic light if traffic increased. Round abouts require a larger loop as traffic increases, making them only    useful until they're not big enough. A four way stop simply needs to be upgraded to a traffic light system that can be adjusted depending on the maximum direction of the traffic flow.  I've seen small round abouts in Austin Texas. 18 wheeler Trucks can't use them. The idiots that put it there should go back to Europe and take their euro loop with them and take notes from the country that invented this shit. Murica"
HighQualityGifs,3co54h,Saigot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"round about can support traffic lights as well, the radius of the loop is determines the speed not the capacity. If a roundabout is small enough that an 18-wheeler cannot turn around it then clearly 18-wheelers should not travel on it, like they should not travel on many road surfaces."
HighQualityGifs,3co54h,happycrabeatsthefish,0,Fri Jul 10 12:10:59 2015 UTC,If a roundabout is small enough that an 18-wheeler cannot turn around it then clearly 18-wheelers should not travel on it   Why?

I like the open-source Ness of it and it's possible to write your own scripts if you want. PS might be slightly more user friendly. AE seemst to be the most popular now and the easiest to do cool stuff. Example being in my BigL gif there the parts where his hand passes through the text , I had to mask frame by frame, I think with AE you can like detetect the hand and glass and mask it more automaticly and stuff, same goes for like animated text and stuff.

HighQualityGifs,3clugw,Omenofdeath,10,Thu Jul 9 11:15:20 2015 UTC,"Bronco team member here.   The little bot VERY cleverly got under us, wedging all of our wheels off the ground. (They even managed it from the side opposite the drivers - from our perspective we couldn't see the their small bot at all.) Then they used the flamethrower to try to roast us, which sure is a good show.  We escaped by jumping off them, though if the little bot had stayed under it would have been much harder to get away, as we would have come back down in about the same spot, on top of them again. But as you can see in the gif the jump pushed them slightly out from under while we were in the air."

HighQualityGifs,3cpy8a,XxClover13xX,2,Thu Jul 9 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I figured I'd give you some feedback as to why your GIF didn't go over well here. Please take this as constructive criticism. I'd like to see you keep making stuff.  The bad:   You left in the letterboxing. Some folks try to get away with using the black letterbox areas for putting text in, but even then it doesn't really belong in a GIF. Crop that out. The color, though decent, got butchered in some very noticeable places. The candle is a background element, but it's also the brightest element in the entire GIF. What are you using to export the GIF itself? There are a lot of us who could advise you on this point depending on what software you use. The original source seems a bit blurry. Did you find it online someplace? If you can, always use the original footage (like a rip from the DVD or a high definition copy). Pretty much everything here in HighQualityGifs is an OC GIF. No need to say so in your title. I did that when I first got here too (many moons ago). :)   The good:   It's a beloved scene with memorable characters. Recognizability and nostalgia are on your side. The GIF is succinct and to the point. Thanks for not making something three minutes long. You picked good edit points. Your instincts on the text are good. You timed it well and it's very legible. I'd like to see what you do with a scene where the text is more of a challenge to make legible, but good job this time.   Looking forward to watching you hone those skills. ;)"
HighQualityGifs,3cpy8a,badmonkey0001,2,Sat Jul 11 19:31:02 2015 UTC,Very cool of you to take the time to write that all up!  Honestly it's my first attempt at a gif.  I did a YouTube to gif conversion to get to scene I wanted.  Then I used an online tool to add text.  Great point with the letterbox next time I'll strip that out.  I'll also try to work off a higher res video sample and maintain quality throughout the gif.  I'll go back to the drawing board on my next attempt :)  Again thanks for the great feedback!
HighQualityGifs,3cpy8a,badmonkey0001,2,Sat Jul 11 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Just carrying on the courtesy that was given to me when I first got in here. One day, you'll be doing the same.  If you make the jump to Photoshop or After effects I'll keep an eye out for when I can give you tips. If you go the free software route (The Gimp and such), there are plenty of folks here to help as well. Good resources are the sidebar links here in HQG and outside of HQG /r/GifTutorials."
HighQualityGifs,3cnxdg,enilyxx,2,Thu Jul 9 11:11:17 2015 UTC,"This is one of those teach a man to fish situations vs giving him the fish.   You need to edit the video and reduce its size. Its 21MB and making it into a gif usually makes it many times larger. After I rendered the video from my editing software and made it smaller, it was 1.8MB. If you dont have editing software and want to make gifs, you will need to download that first. Or just forget about gifs if you have to worry about size issues.  Editing is the most important step in the whole process and most fun.  Depending on your system, you can use aftereffects or a few other systems listed on the sidebar on PC, I am a mac guy so I use ScreenFlow. Its $90 to download full version, or a free version with a trick on youtube to get around the watermark. ITs a lot of fun to edit and I recommend you def try it out.  From there you can take the video you made to gfycat.com if its long, or if its short to imgflip.com. Upload to there and those locations make it into a gif or webm. Check the size and if needed make adjustments to length of video or crop the top and bottom or sides. The more rectangle the less MB, the shorter time, less MB.  From there you can either directly upload to Stream, or use a host like imgur.com  And just like that you have a gif! Yours turned out to be 8MB as a gif and 1MB as a webm on gfycat. Here is the link for the webm. http://gfycat.com/CoarseVibrantBufeo And here is the link to its gif version. http://giant.gfycat.com/CoarseVibrantBufeo.gif  Gfycat doesnt make the best gifs, but they are one of the only ones you can use easily for long vids up to 15 seconds. Otherwise you need to be at around 5 seconds for a gif on imgflip.   You can take the webm link to imgur and upload it to their video to gif tab and they will make a much cleaner gif for you. But the size usually gets very large again with them. Also if you do the imgur step, it must be an even amount of time, no fractions of a second. Like 13 seconds, not 12.4 or 13.3 seconds. Imgur will round down and you will lose the end of the vid. This is the link for the imgur version http://i.imgur.com/u05qTf2.gifv   Its much cleaner than the gfycat gif but the file is now  29.1MB, however if you compare the imgur gif to the gfycat webm, you will see gfycat gives you a slightly better looking picture. So if you can, try to upload to Stream as a webm from gfycat. You do that by simply copying the url over the video when you first make the it in gfycat and then pasting that into Stream's appropriate location. If you can upload webm to Stream, then you might be able to directly take your large video file to them and skip the editing process. But that is truly the most fun of the whole gif making process, so its worth playing with editing and getting good at it.  The only way to get good at this is lots of practice. So be patient and keep trying. And before you know it, you will be posting gifs in /r/highqualitygifs.  Good luck and enjoy!"
HighQualityGifs,3cnxdg,soapyartgif,2,Fri Jul 10 07:44:31 2015 UTC,"Dude. :( I am really sorry, I had no idea you had replied to my post. I would've replied instantly if I knew. Thank you for explaining me the process, really cleared it up, I thought it would be much more complex.   However, Steam requires me to upload the video specifically as a .gif, so .webm or .mp4 is not allowed, sadly. Anyways, thanks again for the reply, not many people would take the time to write such a long and informative reply."
HighQualityGifs,3cnxdg,soapyartgif,2,Sun Jul 12 21:44:10 2015 UTC,"oh ok right on... glad it was just a mix up....   And you are very welcome :) Your only options with a gif only post at 8mb is to make them very small and short then. you will need to do them on imgflip.com and try to keep them at 5-6 seconds max. You can do up to 10-12 secs there but the quality is shit at that point. OH! I forgot about ezgif.com That is a useful site for beginners, you can make longer versions there and use their tools to make the file size smaller. It will only be 10fps but sometimes you gotta do whats needed to get it done. There you can learn lots of details about the gif process and tools you can apply to your gifs.  Just click tabs and play around with stuff, thats how I learned.  I am glad the info helped you out and I am sorry for my comment too ;) Happy giffing!"

Like, is everyone supposed to be subbed to all subreddits? Are subreddits not allowed to have overlapping interests? If something corresponds to the interests of two subs, why the fuck would you not post it to both?"
HighQualityGifs,3ciysr,Teraka,2,Wed Jul 8 16:30:13 2015 UTC,So it's only a repost if he reposts it twice?

Funny story: Both reddit and Imgur claim to be the origin of that and they are actually both right. The Image was uploaded to Imgur and shared on both. Same thing for the safe and a few other pieces of fairly recent Internet history.  It's fun to watch people argue about it though. Reminds me of when I was a kid and I got into a fight with my cousin over who won WWII - the US or the British. Turns out the only things we were wrong about was our own mis-understanding of the larger context."

HighQualityGifs,3cha64,HORSE_SIZED_DICK,2,Wed Jul 8 21:16:37 2015 UTC,It's actually not that strange. Imgur was originally designed for Reddit as a platform to post. Then Imgur took off and became its own community. The two are still intertwined.

I'm sad I didn't get After Effects though. I did get a copy of AE CS3 for my birthday way back in 2007 or something. But nowadays that program is ancient history and no where near as powerful.

HighQualityGifs,3cervn,badmonkey0001,12,Tue Jul 7 10:09:02 2015 UTC,"I wanted to try to ""restore"" some old source video (yes, 90s sitcom sources). To figure it out I did this experiment. I chose an old Nutrigrain ad since all the online copies suck (that one is 320x240). I thought I'd share the GIF here to see what others think, though the final video quality I got is a little sub-par even for my taste.  I added several blur, noise, sharpen, and color correction effects in AE to try to clean this up. I think the color turned out pretty good. In the end, fighting the pixelation proved to be the worst part (yes, I upscaled the video - ew). I managed to get rid of some of the blotchiness in color, but the rough edges are still apparent. If anyone has tips on that, I'd love to hear them.  The challenge for what I added to the GIF became trying to match the low-definition some. Normally I'm pretty good at that, but since the text goes by so damned fast the more I messed it up the more illegible it got. The upvote I snuck in fits pretty well though.  Here's a before-and-after GIF. I also uploaded a before-and-after to Youtube with the audio intact. I don't think I'm going to bother adding in the original text (though I could change my mind).  Finally, thanks for the sub /u/ManWithoutModem and /u/EditingAndLayout (plus the rest of the mods of course). I've learned tons in this sub."

Leave it to a guy like Miller to include something that would have been fine just for its balls-out-awesome factor, but then to work in like, an anthropological/sociological reason for its existence.  Easily my favorite part of the movie was how much culture that there was. It just existed, and didn't feel the need to call attention to itself. (Also makes the film great for repeat viewings. There are INFINITE details for you to notice and pick up when you see it a fifth and sixth and seventieth time.)"

HighQualityGifs,3capm5,XeneizeNZ,9,Mon Jul 6 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"Aw, c'mon; that's like saying Jurassic Park didn't have a plot.  Mad Max = Furiosa steals the wives, must escape from Immortan Joe.  Jurassic Park = dinosaurs get loose an island, people must escape from dinosaurs.  Just because a plot is simple or easily boiled down doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Also, you don't need a complex plot to have a story that's rife with subtext, social commentary, and layered meanings. Fury Road has all those things in spades, but the movie demands a good bit of participation if you're willing to parse all that out.  Doesn't mean that has to be everyone's thing! It's OK to not like any movie - there is no rule about that. But I think that maybe saying Fury Road was without plot is a bit of a misstep."
HighQualityGifs,3capm5,newo32,7,Mon Jul 6 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"I think that was the whole point. There isn't a whole lot of plot to any of these movies. Just a lot of awesome visual effects, car chases, fights, explosions and a cool setting."

I can't imagine her being able to keep the citadel as the leader for long, without it just being taken over again by an Immortan Joe type. She could also go out to find a new green place maybe."

HighQualityGifs,3capm5,XeneizeNZ,6,Mon Jul 6 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"It's a post-apocalyptic action movie, not a drama. It's expected for the plot to be a bit lacking and to make up for it in exciting action, which is why so many people enjoyed it."
HighQualityGifs,3capm5,Whats_a_narwhal,-13,Mon Jul 6 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous. In any post apocalyptic world there is a tonne to explain, a million opportunities to bring nuance and develop the world these people are in if only for the fact that it's a world we can't possibly understand. There are dozens of post apocalyptic action movies yet I can't think of another one that turns a blind eye to plot and treats the hour and a half as a glorified music video like this one does. Hell, even Waterworld had a storyline."
HighQualityGifs,3capm5,XeneizeNZ,8,Mon Jul 6 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"Whoa, no plot?  I mean, I get that it's mostly given very indirectly, but.. I mean, isn't that what we want from a movie that's supposed to be a balls-to-the-wall action movie?  IMO that's what separated this from other similar movies... it didn't treat me like an idiot and try to force-feed some story down my throat, it gave me very basic goals for the characters, and then gave all the plot details in the subtext and in the background, and let me figure it out myself.  Hell, I'm not going to argue that this movie wasn't style over substance... but it's not like there was no substance...  I mean, if you said ""I didn't like the plot"" I'd suppose it'd make more sense, but ""lack of plot""?  I dunno man... you gotta work a little bit for it I guess..."
HighQualityGifs,3capm5,ibanez-guy,3,Mon Jul 6 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"It seems like a lot of peoples complaints with this movie was that there wasn't enough exposition explaining the movie, but that's what makes Mad Max so good imo.

HighQualityGifs,3cc6nx,Grachamoncha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:55:38 2015 UTC,It's even bigger than what you think then. Every dot is the sun at the centre of a solar system. Every single one of those dots have their own amount of planet sized planets as well. The game is unfathomably massive.
HighQualityGifs,3cc6nx,Dark_Ethereal,3,Thu Jul 9 11:03:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is there is a different between a massive amount of variation and a massive amount of MEANINGFUL variation.  Procedurally generated planets are all well and good, but unless they can massively vary what a player has to do on a particular planet, then it's going to get boring fast.  It's like zooming through a fractal like a mandelbrot set. You can keep zooming through the fractal and every bit will be different, and you can zoom infinitely and still find new stuff... But eventually you see the pattern in the variations and while each one is different, it's not meaningfully different and you get bored eventually.  I believe that a game requires the human element to generate challenges and narratives that keep a player interested.  Procedural generation is a use tool for the developer, but it shouldn't be used to sell a game.  When they tell you that there are more planets than you are ever going to be able to explore, then you know there's a problem, because the amount of planets that they actually added a human element to will be small.  Caves in Skyrim are procedurally generated, but then they are tended to by a developer, and compelling naratives are given to them. In each cave you may find it's own little plot-line. Maybe it's a main quest, maybe it's just a story about a person you never met that you infer through their cold dead remains, arranged in a particular way to imply the cause of their demise."
HighQualityGifs,3cc6nx,Grachamoncha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:19:22 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, if that is the case then the game could get boring fast. It's games like these where we'll just have to wait until it comes out to find out if there are secrets worth discovering. At the very least we know that the central narrative is to get to the centre of the universe. I reckon the dev's intention is that as the game gets older each solar system will have their own player generated story if you know what I mean?  Actually, now i come to think about it, is the game multiplayer? I actually have no idea."
HighQualityGifs,3cc6nx,Dark_Ethereal,2,Thu Jul 9 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"I think the short answer is no.  The long answer is ""Sorta maybe"".  It sounds like they intend it to be primarily a singleplayer experience, with some interaction with other players.  You'll never be able to find your friends. You can't see people's names. You can't communicate in a live capacity apparently. You can leave messages in places, but you can't chat.  A lot like dark souls really.  So don't expect a vibrant player economy or players sitting in organized factions trying to raid or be raided or stuff like that. It sounds tailored to lone operators...  I don't really like that. I don't think they're doing it because they want to. I think they're doing it because they can't technically, while others can.  I feel like they've put the bare minimum amount of multiplayer in to actually call it such.  In fact the more I read about this game, the more that I feel like it's ""Space Simulator Lite"", made with procedural generation to cut costs, limited scope of gameplay, minimalist graphics, and bare minimum multiplayer.  I just feel like Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous are going to end up as far more compelling games when they are all finished.  Everyone is going to need at least one space simulator when VR comes out, but I'm not sure this is the one to get.  And I really don't appreciate the hype train games like this get when really people should wait for it to come out.  When I was younger, I got caught up in the Spore hype train when they overstated the scope of that game looooots. Never again. That's the game that taught me that random variation =/= meaningful variation."
