I filled it in anyway (I'm in Canada), but put my address as 1 Canada Alabama 00000 to see how far the verification process goes.

If let's say 17.9% of the commentators actually do donate, the winner SHOULD get something around 7 thousand dollars (give or take) on this draw.   Some notes to mention, the comment counted are EVERY comment, meaning replies and entry comments were counted. So the percentage donated is a little lower than it should be.

However, this account is around a year old and obviously has had activity prior. Maybe they've taken a break from the Internet for a while, maybe they've been lurking.  The mods will be in contact with them and decide if they are eligible, which in this case I would guess is most likely."

millionairemakers,3ds7ug,alystair,2,Sun Jul 19 07:10:36 2015 UTC,You can still donate to the last winner. It's never too late and he's not going to complain.
millionairemakers,3ds7ug,WilliamBott,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:01:28 2015 UTC,My rationale for not doing so I that it's via PayPal and the person would require a minimum amount in his account to transfer it to his bank. Not worth the effortt IMHO over a single dollar. I'll double my donation to the current winner as a feel-good thing but otherwise I got notifications working properly :)
millionairemakers,3ds7ug,alystair,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"Aren't you overestimating the number of people who donate at least a dollar? A lot of people who do donate give more, right? If the average donation is even $1.50, the percentage of people who donate drops significantly.   None of this undermines your point, of course, but I would guess that the percentages of participants who donate is actually smaller than your estimates suggest."

millionairemakers,3ds7ug,Im-Probably-Lying,5,Sun Jul 19 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. Who knows, maybe they are starting to take this a little more seriously. The fact that they still haven't posted the official winner's thread for him makes me think that maybe they are finally starting to understand why the donation rates keep plummeting (they keep allowing clearly non-active winners) and as a result, people refuse to donate to them.  A lot of changes need to be made if this sub is going to expand and truly succeed.  Hopefully they do a re-draw for this one instead of letting it slide like usual.. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it though :P"

I donate directly via Bitcoin which could be entirely silent and draw the same ire, but I publicly congratulate the winners to make it obvious. Plus, I post the Bitcoin address I intend to use in my entry so anyone can verify that I put the $1 aside before the drawing and can see the instant I donated to the winner. Not 6 months later if I won.   I will donate, but the winner played and appeared to walk away from an earlier drawing. We don't need them here if that's the case."
millionairemakers,3ds7ug,moronmonday526,11,Sun Jul 19 04:30:33 2015 UTC,I have been donating each time directly via bitcoin and not posting that I have been. I guess I should make my donations more public in case I win...
millionairemakers,3ds7ug,astanix,10,Sun Jul 19 04:34:43 2015 UTC,"I have an issue that it looks like either an alt or a nearly completely inactive ""redditor"". I also saw the previous entry and lack of acknowledgment, though.  I donated to the previous winner but will not be donating to this one. Way too many red flags, sorry."
millionairemakers,3ds7ug,WilliamBott,6,Sun Jul 19 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"Why should we have to post a congrats and a bitcoin address so people can verify that we donated? Seems like you just want to do that so that if you win people will look at your history and say ""oh he's a good guy"" and give you more money."
millionairemakers,3ds7ug,PENIS_VAGINA,6,Sun Jul 19 10:16:50 2015 UTC,Do we wait for the winner to post their PayPal info and whatnot?

millionairemakers,3ds7ug,moronmonday526,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:01:20 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that's why I asked. I couldn't figure it out initially."
millionairemakers,3ds7ug,casualpocahontas,2,Sun Jul 19 09:20:14 2015 UTC,"Tbh I've been confused this whole time, but doing my best to read everything. Having a bitcoin wallet just gives more ways for a person to donate. Bitcoin is just an unregulated e-currency. I don't use it all that often.   What I saw from the last winner's thread was that PayPal and Google wallet both stalled out, which gave an additional way to donate. I'm sure they send the winner a message with some tips/suggestions as to what they should say/include in their winner's post."

I always donate in bitcoin, which has the added benefit of being completely anonymous."

In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero.

millionairemakers,3dlpau,coozyorcosie,3,Fri Jul 17 14:32:57 2015 UTC,The third Friday of every month :)
millionairemakers,3dlpau,Paltry_Digger,2,Fri Jul 17 20:37:43 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason why it's on Friday nights? I agree with /u/coozyorcosie, on Friday night reddit is usually the last thing on my mind."

millionairemakers,3dlpau,petulance,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:14 2015 UTC,"If you want this to ever work there needs to be consistency, I've said this plenty of times and it gets ignored. Its part of the reason why MM isn't too successful. I've missed a handful of drawings because I didn't know when it was happening because it's always different every month. I understand the mods are busy with there lives but maybe they shouldn't be doing this if they can't do it the right way."

millionairemakers,3dlpau,_mindpalace_,10,Fri Jul 17 08:47:44 2015 UTC,I think if we got rid of all the random little mini contests and just kept to the official ones in this sub then it would be more visible.
millionairemakers,3dlpau,xdig2000,2,Fri Jul 17 11:30:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, focus on the main thing 100%. Other contests will distract the attention of the reason this sub is created."
millionairemakers,3dlpau,_mindpalace_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I think everything else just dilutes it."
millionairemakers,3dlpau,Behavioural101,3,Fri Jul 17 22:14:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree, the amount of upvotes that mini contests get don't compare to the official drawings. Official drawings will always be on top for that reason, no matter how you sort.  After consulting with the mods some time ago, I decided to have the last round of my experiment end today. So it ran the week leading up to the drawing. I think the only influence that my (and other) contest had on the official drawing, is that fewer people miss the drawing. The people that saw my contest in their feed will have been reminded of the coming drawing. People that didn't see my contest won't miss the drawing because of it, since the official drawing will always be way more visible due to the amount of upvotes and due to being an official thread. I'm curious why you think that smaller contests would decrease visibility. If you are right, then I wholeheartedly agree that mini contests should move somewhere else and this sub should only host the official drawings.  EDIT: People obviously disagree with me, which is fine, but could someone explain to me then how exactly the smaller contests would lower the amount of participants in the official drawings? I honestly don't see how, for the reasons I stated above."

The money is more of an incentive to get more people to play, and I think with 1000ish people There will be plenty of coverage. If the winner got a set amount, the distribution would be heavily skewed towards the low end, but this payout system encourages a more even spread of guesses."

millionairemakers,3ct81s,gtavshit,29,Fri Jul 10 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"It is a great idea, but lately controversy and lack of donations makes me think this will die out in a few months.  There will always be generous people who donate, but people coming in expecting to win a million bucks, are sadly mistaken.  I just hope the next winner will get at least $1,000."
millionairemakers,3ct81s,KillerCujo53,7,Fri Jul 10 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"Gotta try and stay positive and not let the negativity influence you.

millionairemakers,3ct81s,Chexytime,16,Fri Jul 10 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"Of course it will die out.  The mods keep insisting that alt accounts are ""active"" even though they are clearly not active at all, and they are clearly alts.  I'm not donating to those and I know I'm not the only one.  Oh well."
millionairemakers,3ct81s,Im-Probably-Lying,8,Fri Jul 10 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"Although it is extremely unlikely I would end up winning a draw, each time I read about the alt problem in this sub I feel like if I was selected, I would be accused of using an alt.  My account is 3 years old but my karmas are almost non-existant because I am a major lurker. But this is really my only account. I just don't contribute or say much...  I don't mean to minimize the alt account problem, because since people can get away with it, some must be trying to increase their chances that way. I just wonder, besides low karma and # of comments and submissions, what are the obvious indicators of alts? Or is that all?"
millionairemakers,3ct81s,heartshapedhole,2,Sat Jul 11 06:03:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't think your account was an alt. You have varied subs posted in and a decent amount of comments over the past 5-6 months (I didn't feel like going further than that). The alt accounts usually have two pages of total comments and they are all in a specific sub. Its usually pretty easy to tell just by comment type and frequency.
millionairemakers,3ct81s,Hideout_TheWicked,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:50:36 2015 UTC,This is my only account as well.
millionairemakers,3ct81s,Damien__,5,Sat Jul 11 14:43:48 2015 UTC,The last winner was so obviously an alt account it was painful!
millionairemakers,3ct81s,Sanjispride,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:00:50 2015 UTC,It wasn't just the last one either. There have been plenty of obvious alt accounts that they let slide.  I can't force them to pick a different winner though. I can only choose who I donate to and who I don't.
millionairemakers,3ct81s,Im-Probably-Lying,9,Sat Jul 11 01:12:47 2015 UTC,So real talk: who gives a shit? It's a dollar to donate. $12/year. Just donate it any way.
millionairemakers,3ct81s,ZeOppositeOfProgress,2,Sat Jul 11 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"Right? Its $1! I've donated to each winner after the first 2 (wasn't around for those) and even though I agree that some of them shouldn't win, I was like its a $1. Normally I donate $2 but for those that I think are alts I don't go that extra. (Baby insanity wolf meme or what?) Its how the sub is supposed to work. If you enter, you're supposed to donate. Guess I'm a goody two shoes and always follow the rules."
millionairemakers,3ct81s,AlmostxAngel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"You say it's only $1, but that just incourages people to create alts. They know people don't care and they'll get the money."
millionairemakers,3ct81s,CodeJack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:24:10 2015 UTC,Hyperbole much?  There have been exactly two suspected of being Alts (the last two). The first was proven to not be an Alt. I don't remember the exact specifics of the second.
millionairemakers,3ct81s,nspectre,3,Sat Jul 11 05:56:07 2015 UTC,"Personally, I felt like the last winner just purged their comment history. Probably because people feel the need to dig through every winner's comments looking for an excuse to pull out the pitch forks. He was probably trying to play it safe and it backfired.   I think if you enter, you should donate. No excuses."

It was simply deduced that the true result of the values inducted in this estimation competition would strongly correlate with the man behind it all. /u/Behavioural101. 101 is the basis; for both learning and this specific experiment. The number is easily divided by 6, the number of characters in the obscenely obvious fake name  ""Melvin"". Yielding 16.8333333. Although, that would be exceedingly simple.    2 more integral steps were taken to arrive at my final response. The thought process behind which must remain a guarded secret to protect my personal interests.    Actually, I just picked a number I liked near what I thought the answer would be and repeated it in the decimals."

millionairemakers,3cjwvi,redheaddreadhead,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"First assume that no one will guess anything over 66 because it would be impossible to win. Next, assume that everyone makes that same assumption and therefore no one guesses anything over 2/3 * 66 = 44. Then assume everyone keeps making these assumptions until the limit approaches 0. If only machines were guessing with these rules they would all choose 0 as their answer, and they would all tie. However, it's all people, and people are stupid. So just guess a number and roll with it."
millionairemakers,3cjwvi,Jiecut,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:29:50 2015 UTC,"That, however, only gives you the ""correct"" answer, not the winning one.  We can only have one winner here; it's not beneficial for everyone to say ""0"", and nobody will even do that knowing that we're all humans.  But I do notice that for these contests, the correct answer seems to be always 0."

Charitable giving is associated with higher levels of health and happiness, increased prosperity and strong community organizations.  Just as significant is the way that giving and receiving gifts shape our moral vision. Given the numerous ""spillover effects"" of private giving for larger society, government has a strong interest in ordering society in such a way that charity can flourish.  Researcher Arthur Brooks examines the benefits of giving in his new book, ""Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth about Compassionate Conservatism."" In terms of physical health and happiness, Brooks notes that people who give more charitably are 43 percent more likely to say they are ""very happy"" than non-givers, while non-givers are three and a half times more likely than givers to report they are ""not happy at all.""  In addition, several large studies have also found that senior citizens who volunteer have a 40 percent lower probability of dying in a given year than people of the same age and health level."

Reddit will thrive if AMAs go away. I certainly won't miss them.   Reddit may be ""just entertainment"" for you, but it's a business for other people.

Sure, Reddit thrived before AMAs and it will without them, but IAMA us a really big subreddit (maybe you won't miss it but I'm pretty sure that its 8.5 MILLION subscribers will) and that's the situation right now, and there's no reason to believe they don't want to keep it big and growing.  Now about the mods-self-entitled thing. Reddit is first and foremost a community driven site, and when mods work so much for free, it's understandable that they want not to be in the dark when things like that happen and in my opinion that ABSOLUTELY doesn't make them self entitled.  I didn't really understand what you meant in your last paragraph but anyway I'm pretty sure that Reddit wants to make as much money as they can."

Your sense of entitlement is coming through again. They are practicing their hobby, or leisure time activity or any number of other things. Reddit owes them nothing. Anything Reddit gives them is a gift, including the website service to begin with... which I think after 10 years still operates at a loss.  That's the idea behing Reddit Gold... give something to the company because the company has given you so much. Instead, people bitch and moan because an employee that Reddit was crazy to hire in the first place for these whiners was let go. BFD."

millionairemakers,3bz6z5,Heavenfall,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, it's not just that, but also last month we had fewer entries which = less donation. The drawing is two weeks away but if people just decide to give up on reddit or just stay away, they'll probably forget to enter again. That was the problem last time, people just forgot to enter. There's no hype, there's no big reminders... I don't know thats just my two cents."
millionairemakers,3bz6z5,Heavenfall,6,Fri Jul 3 10:00:25 2015 UTC,"Arguably having the major subs set to private would drastically increase the odds of this drawing reaching the frontpage.

millionairemakers,3bz6z5,nolo_me,-3,Fri Jul 3 10:49:52 2015 UTC,"That's the official stance, is it? ""We're not a lottery and take pains to point that out at every opportunity, but we're going to push the lottery-esque element and downplay the donation bit that the whole thing was supposed to be about"".  Strikes me as a very mixed message, and not one I'm particularly comfortable with. Quality matters, not just quantity. Every single drawing I've seen people donate enough to cover 10, 20, 30 freeloaders in a single donation and still the number of entries is orders of magnitude greater than the total donations.  Pushing the drawing thread as a vehicle of publicity for the sub is only going to increase the problem. I was in two minds after the posting history witch-hunts, but this attitude from someone with mod flair has convinced me that this sub isn't worth supporting any more."
millionairemakers,3bz6z5,Mudokon_Tears,3,Fri Jul 3 12:24:52 2015 UTC,"Ideally, both the drawing thread and the donation thread should be upvoted as much as possible. Sure we will get people who never donate, but we already get that even when we don't reach front page.   By downvoting the drawing thread, we are denying potential legitimate people who would have donated but wont because they have no idea this sub exists.   Remember this sub is about giving, not receiving. Downvoting the dawing threads may give you a better chance at winning, but it is only harming the aim of the sub of more people giving."
millionairemakers,3bz6z5,nolo_me,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"Which would be true, except upvoting the donation threads gives the genuine people exactly the same chance to get involved while reducing the influx of people who enter without ever so much as intending to donate."
millionairemakers,3bz6z5,Mudokon_Tears,2,Fri Jul 3 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"You assume upvoting the donation thread will only be seen by the legitimate donators? People will be wondering what they are donating to and how they can be a part of it, be it a donor or receiver.    except upvoting the donation threads gives the genuine people exactly the same chance to get involved   Except it doesn't. If only the donation post gets to the front page, that's one chance for someone to see what this sub is about. If both threads get to the front page then that is two different chances for people to see what the sub is about.  This sub will never reach parity with the same number of people entering and same number of people donating. However we should still be trying to grow the sub at every chance to get the overall number of people donating higher, even if it means taking the bad with the good."
millionairemakers,3bz6z5,nolo_me,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:18:46 2015 UTC,"One chance being ""comment here to win $$$"", the other being ""let's make a difference to somebody"". Which is the best message?"

Why would you think people would be given more money with less entries?"

millionairemakers,3bz6z5,nolo_me,-2,Fri Jul 3 11:07:55 2015 UTC,For how many entries? And how does that compare proportionally with the ones that didn't?
millionairemakers,3bz6z5,doktaj,2,Fri Jul 3 13:07:46 2015 UTC,"Who cares about the proportion. We are trying to give someone money, not trying to limit the deadbeats."

As I've said before, we're going to need to get through a good 10 or 15 drawings before we can get even a glimmer of a guesstimate as to how this fun project is going to pan out over the long term.

You can make as many as you want, some use it for different reasons like visiting different subs, porn accounts, stuff like that. There's tons of people who have several accounts, or 'alts', and they can use that to enter in the drawing.  So basically one person could enter 5 accounts and have 5 times as much of a chance of winning than you or I who only use our main account to enter once.

It's nice to think people get more out of altruism than they do a chance of personal gain, but it's probably not realistic. You may well get a better response if you ask people to donate a dollar to enter the draw (perhaps paying into some sort of holding account), rather than donating after the fact - people are often happy to buy a chance at winning something, especially if it's only $1, but if they're paying for no chance of winning they just don't have the same incentive, even though they're spending an identical small amount. If people don't win, they're also less likely to remember to donate. Limiting winners to those with at least a certain number of posts would probably also help."

millionairemakers,3b3maq,chriswen,2,Mon Jun 29 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"And that is the risk they now take when doing so. I don't see why people delete their comments. It doesn't really matter, but they should be aware that if they continue, many people will not know or really care and won't donate. They're giving them an excuse to not donate."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,atechnicnate,0,Mon Jun 29 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"for the last two drawings, the winner's thread never made it high enough on my frontpage, and I subscribe! Had to track them down.  Hell, the entry threads haven't been showing up recently.  Having to hunt is hard, and the dates to hunt aren't always super clear."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,DriftNugget,3,Fri Jun 26 08:19:24 2015 UTC,"if you have more than 50 subs, then reddit just picks 50 random subs every half an hour to show you on the front page."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,WilliamBott,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:04:43 2015 UTC,I hear that!  I also keep going to enter only to find out that it's too early in the day and then I forget about it.  :(
millionairemakers,3b3maq,havoc3d,6,Fri Jun 26 16:07:44 2015 UTC,"The bot didn't remind me, which was probably a widespread issue. Luckily, I remembered to donate anyways. It's very frustrating that people don't donate when they enter."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,canotila,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"The bot forgot to remind me, too. I just tonight remembered and was able to send him a dollar. It's not the bot's fault if I forget, but it's a possible issue as to why donations were low."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,HateUScuzdeyANUS,3,Sun Jul 12 06:20:51 2015 UTC,"I just never know when they're going to happen.  Look at the dates on the right.  Apparently there was one yesterday and I was totally unaware.  24th, 22nd, 19th, 26th, 26th, 7th, 28th, and apparently this month the 24th?  How are people supposed to regularly be involved if no one knows when it's going to be.  There's probably a sticky or something a few days before hand, but I've given up going out of my way to try to figure out when I need to 'be here'."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,supah,3,Fri Jun 26 03:16:55 2015 UTC,It was actually the 19th. I think the 06/24/15 date is the latest update to the winner's thread. They've been trying to do the draw on the third Friday of the month.
millionairemakers,3b3maq,TheLastTrial,2,Mon Jun 29 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"It should be on a set day. The 20th of every month or whatever day, but every month it's the same day."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,mamadex26,3,Mon Jun 29 13:47:03 2015 UTC,My best guess is that the drawings are only once a month. People forget about it. It sucks really bad but mods don't want to change it.
millionairemakers,3b3maq,almost_asifta_say_,9,Fri Jun 26 22:41:51 2015 UTC,This subreddit would be a genius way to launder money.
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Whats_a_narwhal,4,Thu Jun 25 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"For me.... I didn't get the reminder so clearly I rely on that.  Additionally I feel like the donation thread went up later than usual (am I making this up.. I haven't been back here since the drawing).  I think I usually come back sometime on Sunday and donate and I couldn't do it. Once Monday comes.. forget it... my mind is elsewhere entirely.  I also wonder about the correlation to paydays... are people paid every Friday, every other Friday, 1st and last day of the month???  I know if the donation was closer to my pay check I would be inclined to be more generous.     I am sure much thought has gone into the day of the week for the entry and drawing.  Trying to coordinate around pay periods or benefits payments would be a nightmare but perhaps a poll could help us understand if the community is not donating because they don't want to or because they can't.  Don't assume that everyone has $1 available every day of the month."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,mamadex26,3,Fri Jun 26 03:58:09 2015 UTC,I want to play bit always miss the donation/entry posts. Is there a way to be reminded without checking the individual sub?
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Dan_Keane,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:01:48 2015 UTC,"The drawing thread stayed open two hours longer than it was supposed to, and the livestream took even longer, so the drawing didn't finish until almost midnight."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Klatelbat,2,Wed Jul 1 22:34:37 2015 UTC,"Gotcha -- just me being a creature of habit.. enter, come back, find winner, donate, put next drawing in Outlook calendar, on to the next thing.. :-)"
millionairemakers,3b3maq,zethyrx,5,Wed Jul 1 22:41:33 2015 UTC,"I'm more than likely never going to win, so the other half (other 95%) of this sub is the idea that you are going help change a life.  I was donating at first, and it was cool to see ~$10k going to the winner.  But when the numbers started to drop, the fun kinda wore off.  Also, the fun part is feeling that you helped, which means the winner (for me) needs to be engaged with the sub, which is hit and miss. Plus all the drama, as others have said."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Klatelbat,10,Fri Jun 26 12:04:10 2015 UTC,"This past winner is almost definitely an alt account, and if it's not an alt account, it is definitely someone who barely spends any time on Reddit. Although the account is over 3 years old, if you take out his MillionaireMakers posts, he only has 12 posts (i counted, it wasn't hard), and the oldest post that he made was 6 months ago.  Also, the majority of those 12 posts are also giveaway or contest posts in other subreddits. If you take out those, he only has 6 posts total.  Either way I still donated, but did feel a bit cheated. The thing is, even if it's not an alt account, people don't want to donate to someone if they aren't actually a real member of reddit. Even for a lurker, he averages 2 non-contest posts per year. That's a bit ridiculous."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,zethyrx,18,Thu Jun 25 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"I am sorry that you feel 'cheated', but if you actually compare my karma to my posts, you will see that they do not add up. This is because like another user mentioned above, I like to go through my old posts and delete them. I just never thought that it would bite me in the ass. Yes, even then it's not a lot of karma, but that's because I like to read and browse more than post. I actually spend more time on reddit than I'd care to admit :P. I love reddit and its wonderful communities (including this one), I just don't often have a lot to say, and when I do, I have the tendency to go back and delete them months later.  Had I know I would ever win a drawing, I would definitely not have done so."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,icameforthecookies,6,Thu Jun 25 20:00:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, I stand corrected, I did not think about the possibility of deleting old comments, probably because I have never done so myself. However, my reasoning as to why people aren't donating to you as compared to others still stands.  In almost every aspect, with the exception of your ""alleged"" donations to previous winners, your account looks like an alt. I always donate before looking at the person's account for this very reason. If the moderators of this subreddit deem your account to be active enough to win, then I should respect their judgement. However, after donating I did look at your account and was VERY skeptical.  The majority of the people on this subreddit, although they have been very generous, are also very paranoid about alts winning. They want to make sure that the winner had an equal chance of winning as they did, and as you can tell with the past winners as well, the shit hits the fan at the first glimpse of alt potential.  The idea behind this subreddit only works under 2 circumstances, everyone has an equal chance of winning, and everyone has to donate. As of now, we have no chance of making those two things actually happen, so we are all paranoid about it, and unfortunately, it looks as if you were hit with the worst of it."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,jimbolic,4,Thu Jun 25 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input and understanding, and I do understand that some people will have their doubts about donating to an account that they suspect might be an alt. I respect their right to have their reservations. Unfortunately, there is no direct way for me to prove that this is my main/only account, and that I do spend a lot of time on reddit.  However, the generosity of those that have donated (even if the total was less than that of previous winners) is very overwhelming, and a lot of them have including very personal message of thanks and tips for me visiting HK/Japan, and I appreciate each and every one of them.  Thank you again for your post, as it does bring up very important points. I just wish that I could go back in time and undelete my old posts."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,SammaATL,2,Thu Jun 25 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"Fyi, I just haven't donated yet. I will. I'm just busy and hadn't gotten around to it."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,zethyrx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:39:24 2015 UTC,I donated to the winner before this one three weeks after the drawing. That person was grateful and it's not uncommon to donate late.
millionairemakers,3b3maq,HateUScuzdeyANUS,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:22:47 2015 UTC,"Do you think the google wallet snafu reduced your total as well? Like people that donated there, then got it returned, never re-donated?"
millionairemakers,3b3maq,slowpoke2013,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is definitely a factor, but I think the biggest reason were users that were hesitant to donate because they suspected this to be an alt account (and they are well within their right to have that belief). I just hope that those same users will be donating to the next winner, as I will defintely be. :)"
millionairemakers,3b3maq,henriettagriff,2,Wed Jul 15 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"I think if you didn't do that, you'd have more than $1,500. Still a good amount of money to get from strangers. I donated to you. Congrats."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Klatelbat,0,Mon Jun 29 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"I've been a Reddit lurker for a couple years, checking out stuff people share about video games I play, computing platforms I work with, finances, and god knows whatever else catches my eye along the way. It was only recently that I've become more interactive and only really commented on posts in /r/GoneWild because (obvious attention whoring excluded) I think it takes guts for women to post themselves online so I play along - offering supportive and positive and naughty comments. Over the time I've been on Reddit, I've learned a lot about so many things, and so many contributors. The ones I've particularly enjoyed reading from I've messaged directly to let them know I appreciate whatever topic was being discussed. I stumbled upon this sub a couple months ago, and hopped right in because I think this is an amazing concept. 2 months subscribed and 2 winners donated to. I will continue to donate as long as I enter the drawings - only fair. However, if you read my comment history you'll see that most of my comments are tongue-in-cheek remarks about nudity. I'm sure I'll be judged by that if I were ever chosen as a drawing winner here, and I'm okay with that. If I wanted to hide that I'd be pruning my history. People do what zethryx and many others here have done with their history for any number of reasons. And that's their prerogative. I can see the argument from both perspectives - and there are valid points to both. I like to think that people act honorable but also realize that ALL people are not always honorable. Greed is a powerful motivating force. Though I am replying to the latest winner's post - I am not condemning him (or any other winner) for doing or not doing something, or for whatever sort of account they have. I will continue to participate in /r/millionairemakers because I believe in the concept, and will do so until it is no longer serving the purpose for which it was intended. Like /u/Klatelbat stated above, there is, and will always be, skepticism."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Atlfalcons284,4,Mon Jul 6 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"I don't see what's wrong with that.  He (He?  probs a he) seems to have come every month to this sub to participate in the drawing.  Presumably, he donates to winners.    And if you don't like contributing in forums, that's okay too.  Not everyone has a strong stance on things/a desire to compete in the reddit atmosphere  It's a dollar, dude."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,iseeyouasperfect,3,Thu Jun 25 20:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I agree, but you have to look at it in the perspective of a skeptic, which the majority of reddit as a whole is.  If you look at his non-millionaire makers posts, it does not seem like he is active at all, which makes the possibility of his account being an alt jump out and make you think that he is in fact an alt-account.  Plus, like you said, ""presumably, he donates to winners"". He's only said he actually donated once, and said he did so via PayPal, which can also be faked.   That being said, the same is true about me, I have donated at every drawing, but haven't actually said so until this one, due to a post a previous winner said about preparing yourself for winning, and I said I donated via PayPal, granted the payment was very specific so that the winner could verify that i actually donated, but to the rest of the subreddit, I could be completely lying.  This is what's wrong with this subreddit. I love this community and think that it is doing something truly awesome, but at the same time, it just doesn't work. If you read my response to Zethyrx's response to me, I talk about the fact that this subreddit will only work if people don't use alts and donate, but there is absolutely no way that we can force that as of now, without this whole thing turning into a lottery, which is not the point. Even if people aren't doing these things (which the majority of people aren't donating), the skepticism will still be there."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Mark_q,2,Thu Jun 25 21:05:54 2015 UTC,"I was a hardcore reddit lurker for 2 years before making an account. I just never really felt the,desire to comment and post stuff. But I was on reddit every single day."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,icameforthecookies,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"As someone who has participated in this subreddit since before the first drawing, your post, and the many like it, are exactly why I've been wanting to unsubscribe.  I no longer enter the drawings and feel no excitement in the giving anymore. It's the same mentality that allows my country to not take care of the poor; Let the real poor suffer because some people are gaming the system."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,HateUScuzdeyANUS,8,Mon Jul 6 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going to post this here, in case Anyone goes through my history.  AHEM  I prune my comments; constantly. If I comment on something then a week later I will delete it.  So  far my posting on the Harley sub have survived, but even those I am getting tired of.  I just don't like leaving a cookie trail."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Heavenfall,4,Thu Jun 25 19:36:16 2015 UTC,That's right. When I win I don't want people hating on me because of my love for Julia Ann.

I will donate, but I have a strong feeling many other will not if you only have a handful of comments. That's just the reality of the situation."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,FastBit,2,Mon Jun 29 13:43:52 2015 UTC,"People don't donate for a huge list of reasons but a few strong ones are......  No personal connection to the user  Lack of updates from user  No sense of worth in donating, people like to be recognized when they donate."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,ZenZibbeh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:21:26 2015 UTC,Maybe make a special joinable drawing by people who have donated X times?
millionairemakers,3b3maq,wheresdangerdave,4,Sun Jul 19 00:30:13 2015 UTC,"The totals are not always updated, tho?  I've seen comments here and there saying ""I've just donated to winner #3"" or ""I went and donated to the previous winner"", but we won't see them reflected forever.  If people would only just donate blindly $1, and be done with it... But until we don't have blood samples and fingerprints as requirements, the complaints won't stop. And by then nobody will be able to participate, because nobody will be ""worthy"" enough.  It's sad, because I thought the spirit of this sub was to just trust in people and help them."
millionairemakers,3b3maq,Neesai,2,Thu Jun 25 19:46:27 2015 UTC,I'm not able to donate till a bit later due to how my bills and pay works out. But I always give the winner a bit extra due to this.  Check old threads.
millionairemakers,3b3maq,RBetoGT,2,Thu Jun 25 19:41:08 2015 UTC,I've donated in every drawings since I found out. Although the one before last never accepted my dollar. What needs to happen is more upvoting of the drawing and winners thread.
millionairemakers,3b3maq,mizzlebizzle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:01:36 2015 UTC,I almost missed the last drawing if I hadn't decide to check it out after being away from the sub since the drawing in May.  I think it's due to people not remembering when the next drawing is going to be.  Having it on the same day every month would be such a convenient.

I'm not sure how much that would help, but I'd venture to guess that most people get paid on Fridays and would be more inclined to donate immediately on payday rather than waiting through the weekend to donate on Sunday or Monday (or whenever the winner's thread is posted - it seems like it is usually at least 2 days later though)."
