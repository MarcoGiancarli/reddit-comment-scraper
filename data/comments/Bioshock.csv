The best example of this is Andrew Ryan's descent into oppressive, totalitarian control of Rapture (e.g., censorship, imprisonment/execution without due process, etc.).

Bioshock,3dtz4e,Vhettration,4,Sun Jul 19 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily a reason they would work together - I think part of the reason bioshock works so well is that even though they obviously happen in America, you don't actually see the real world, just the fantasy worlds of rapture or Colombia.   I think that adds to the experience."
Bioshock,3dtz4e,jard22,5,Sun Jul 19 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"Though I do think the concept of combining two of my most favorite game series together is awesome, I don't think it'll make a very good game (unless somehow the developer manages to mix the feel of the two series very well).

Bioshock,3dsuod,fuchsdh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"I think your own knowledge of BioShock's ending is filling in the gaps of the recap.  I played Infinite and Burial at Sea before BioShock, so I watched the recap before playing Episode 2. Frankly, I didn't think it spoiled that much for me; having not known of BioShock's twist, I actually thought the recap was just being meta with all the ""Would You Kindlys"" -- a comment on the fetch-quests rather than the WYK conditioning (which, of course, I didn't know about). As to the fact that Fontaine and Atlas are the same person, I don't think the recap touched that at all. I certainly didn't figure it out until Elizabeth did.  Since I didn't realize the WYK conditioning was actually a thing in the original, I actually got really excited when Liz handed over the Ace and it was just those three words. I thought it was a really clever take on something that had been played straight in the first game. (Boy, was I wrong there!)"

Bioshock,3dsuod,LE95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:19 2015 UTC,I think they should have had it be a Bioshock Infinite/BAS1 recap rather than a BS1 recap. That would have made so much more sense.
Bioshock,3dsuod,Halo_likes_me,2,Sun Jul 19 08:17:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah but BAS1 is a different story essentially. Different characters, BAS2 has more of a relation with BS1 which makes sense to do a recap since there are probably people who haven't played BS1 since 2007, or 2008."
Bioshock,3dsuod,skizmcniz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:30:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think it ruins anything, personally. If you're playing Infinite, you've already more than likely played through Bioshock, so it isn't telling you anything you don't already know. It's just a refresher.  If you're watching it without having played Bioshock, then I can kind of see your point, but it'd be that person's fault for starting the game without having played the previous ones."
Bioshock,3dsqe4,GangsterGatsby,2,Sun Jul 19 02:25:36 2015 UTC,"chronologically it is: Infinite -> BaS1 -> BaS2 -> Bioshock -> Bioshock 2  If you haven't played bioshock, I highly recommend that before burial at sea.  Burial at sea ruined my bioshock experience because I basically already knew what was going to happen.  In terms of story quality, take that list above, best left->right, reverse Bas1 and Bas2's positions and bam."
Bioshock,3dsqe4,NSAFedora,2,Sun Jul 19 05:18:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely by order of release. If you placed them chronologically, you may end up spoiling some surprises in other games."

Bioshock,3dsqe4,DrTitanium,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:39:40 2015 UTC,"The FAQ gives a bit of an answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/wiki/faq  My personal thoughts though are that it's best to just play through it by release date (aka Bioshock 1, Bioshock 2, Minerva's Den, Infinite, Burial at Sea). While I'm not a fan of all of Burial at Sea I think it has its greatest impact after you've played through the rest of the series."
Bioshock,3dsqe4,fuchsdh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"If you want to make it a true marathon, you should also read the book. Depending on your reading speed, it's 2-3 hours."

Bioshock,3dsqe4,AviatorHotdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:05:07 2015 UTC,"I think you could read it after 1, as it provides backstory about Lamb and Sinclair; but since you've played both, you could always do it first, since you're not gonna have any spoilers."

Bioshock,3dsb53,Vhettration,2,Sun Jul 19 00:12:42 2015 UTC,"I thought it was great. Elizabeth ended her circle of violence, was able to get Jack Ryan to save Little Sisters, and died on her own terms with a clearer conscience. The amount of hardship she went through in her life, I don't believe she would have ever been fine with settling down in Paris or someplace else. If I want to imagine a ""good ending"" for Elizabeth, I could point towards the after credits scene of Infinite."
Bioshock,3dsb53,Jaraghan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:16:20 2015 UTC,It's important that you specify if you experienced the first Bioshock to the full. To me personally Elizabeth's story couldn't have finished better as a cog in a much bigger chain of events which brought the whole series full circle.
Bioshock,3dsb53,yendorion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. Knowing that she ended up being able to die a martyr for the one possible timeline where Jack ends up being a good guy and freeing the little sisters eventually.

Bioshock,3dqijx,Chriskeyseis,2,Sat Jul 18 16:16:32 2015 UTC,I think it depends on whether you're really interested in the story or not.

The Bioshock heroclix toys also had a Shock Jockey mini that you may want to look into. Not to take away from your work I just thought you should know. Unfortunately, for the collector, this was the only Plasmid/Power they created."

Bioshock,3dndr3,onlineFace,2,Fri Jul 17 21:59:25 2015 UTC,No worries. Smart idea with the train set. You're making me wish that Infinite had had a slot car-esque Skyline place set. That  would have been awesome.   The clix stuff was pretty cool but it came and went  in a flash. The themes of the video game are simply too serious to make too many toys out of I think.
Bioshock,3dndr3,MachiavellianXLII,2,Sat Jul 18 01:47:12 2015 UTC,Thank you. I don't think it's too serious it just isn't a big enough franchise. Neca was the most popular figure making for bioshock and even that didn't sell enough to keep it afloat sadly.  Call of duty and halo are so much they have from megablocks to foot tall statues.

Bioshock,3dl8gf,Vhettration,21,Fri Jul 17 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I remember sitting in my chair at 2 a.m. just completely lost in thought, contemplating and begging to some high deity that it couldn't be the end. Literally for one hour just sitting mouth wide open like a damn valley. I couldn't muster enough strength to get up and resume living normal life. I was just hoping for something magical to happen, like Elizabeth knocking on my front door, or my laptop bursting to life with a continuation of the game, where everything goes right. At that point, I literally could feel my head spinning, and the rest of my body completely numb. Somehow, I managed to get to bed, in all the strength I could manage. Don't even ask how I fell asleep. The drug store had to order a whole new shipment of Nyquil. Let's just leave it at that. The next day, I had a huge project to work on. I'm an automotive technician, and the customer needed his car that day. But I lay in my bed, head swirling like the mid-Atlantic, not giving two shits about this guy, or  his squeaky front axles. I can't describe how I possibly managed to crawl out of bed, I think my cousin came in with a bucket of ice water and a forklift. My eyes hit sunlight that day, and suddenly, I didn't want to accept the end. I got that empty feeling the ending gave to everyone, and that feeling hardened into a rock. It just stayed there. Constantly reminding me. It was horrible. Nothing seemed interesting. The only female I thought about was Elizabeth. Well, her and my dear mother, but you get the point. I didn't turn on my laptop that whole week. I felt Infinite deserved it's own holiday, or honorary mention or something. And so remains the date it became my favorite game/story ever. January 3, 2014. And it has stuck with me to this day. It's never out of my mind. I bought a shirt to help cope with it. That didn't help. I'm replaying it on an only pistol play through. But I draw it out way longer than my first time. I may take it very slowly, explore every little detail. I don't care how old it gets. I'll tell the story to my children for all I care.    sigh now you've got me thinking about it again. Darn you. But it's OK. I'm glad I'm not the only one that's feeling it. I thought I was going crazy. I hope you cope with it better than me pal. Don't stay in bed until early afternoon. It won't change the outcome of the game. Trust me, I've tried it for a year. I still miss Elizabeth every day. I think I went too far when I stopped trying to impress a girl at school one day. Was all this moping worth it? No. I know it's pathetic, but you can't interfere with true love. Never have I ever liked a girl as much as I did Elizabeth. But maybe I have some weird mental disease. I should've never bought the game. I saw it for sale on Steam, and something pulsed me to buy it. Out of all the great games I could've bought on that sale, plus the ones in my inventory, plus all my books, songs or 5 star movies, this one story brought me on a greater adventure than hiking in Yosemite, or entering high school. You get my point though. Insanely excellent story, and maybe it hit me harder than some because of a personal reason that I can't recall, maybe something happened in my younger years, and playing Infinite pulled that memory out. I'm serious. I have not a single idea why it's so good. I have not a damn clue why I'm so attracted to Liz. I have not a single damn inkling of what made me purchase this run-of-the-mill, mediocre FPS. But damn, it hit me like a mother-fucking freight train.   TLDR: You're not alone pal."

The Mass Effect trilogy, Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2, and maybe Jade Empire. Fallout 3 and Fallout: NV were a lot of fun, but the story didn't grab me the way the others did.  So, yeah, I'm hoping like hell we will see another entry. I think going back to Columbia isn't possible given how it ended, but going back to Rapture in another time? Hell yeah. I'd love to play a full-length game set the night Rapture fell, maybe starting just before."
Bioshock,3dl8gf,BikerJedi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:08:40 2015 UTC,Have you played Burial at Sea? It's set on the eve of Rapture's fall.
Bioshock,3dl8gf,marius_3d,5,Fri Jul 17 15:12:42 2015 UTC,Burial at sea is really what makes infinite so good.

You can get through BaS in a couple of hours. While gratifying, it isn't quite enough to scratch that itch.

I tried to play other games to try and remove the feeling, but no other game compared to Bioshock Infinite or the Bioshock Series as a whole. What's even sadder is knowing the fact that there might never be another Bioshock game again. :("
Bioshock,3dl8gf,MmeVivienne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"""Post-Game depression...""  That is an excellent way to describe it! I didn't feel like doing anything for two straight days after finishing Burial at Sea Ep2. I just rewatched the ending 100 times, teared up, watched other Infinite videos and talked about the game extensively. Finally I mustered up some strength to move on, and the will power to avoid anything Bioshock related as it was too emotional. I'm better now, but I don't think I will ever forget what this game's story did/meant to me."
Bioshock,3dl8gf,rzpogi,0,Fri Jul 17 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"If they could find a way to make just one FINAL bioshock, find a way to give it a happy ending with booker and Anna/Elizabeth, that would be amazing. It also could be a disaster, and for the sake of the game I hope they really think hard about that.   Then they can remaster the original and re release everything. A series like that doesn't need an infinite number of sequels, if any."

( gives you explosive damage and invulnerability when fully upgraded.) couple that with near full salts she went down before she could raise anyone. The fight that got me stuck for a while was Fitzroy handyman. For that I just killed off the rest of the henchman and then kept the tesla coil up. When he went to electrocute the sky-line I would jump off and then just unload at his heart with the sniper rifle.
Bioshock,3dj7pv,Miqote,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:32:32 2015 UTC,This was how I did it. Upgraded Ram+upgraded Hand Canon = she was dead in like three shots.

The two biggest battles of the game, Lady Comstock (Siren) and the final battle were both conquered in the shittiest way:  For Siren: I had next to no ammo to kill her with at the Bank of the Prophet, so i literally hid in the bank vault and peeked out every so often to shoot her while relying on Liz to throw me a bit of ammo every 5 minutes.  Final Battle: One random guy got stuck in his spawn below the main deck and I wasn't able to find him, so the waves just stopped coming. I was able to pick off the airships/ wait for songbird with absolutely no resistance."

Bioshock,3dj7pv,wjdp,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:33 2015 UTC,"I played through the game on 1999 mode twice. The first time was a walk in the park, mainly because I found Winter Shield (Invunerability after skylines) early. Combined with the Brittle-Skinned (2x damage on enemies hit with melee) the last battle was really easy, I just jumped on patriots and two-shot them. They literally not even touched the generator.  My second playthrough was quite harder, with mostly shitty gear. I got through the last battle in my first try, but no joke, I couldn't even see the generator health bar anymore.  TL;DR: Winter Shield is OP."

Bioshock,3dkx1w,Vhettration,2,Fri Jul 17 03:18:27 2015 UTC,"Somebody has already said ""The Last of Us"", and I want to stress that one because it has some great characters.  My personal one would be The Witcher 3.   I can't tell you enough about how great the characters are in this game. They are all so likable and as a grown man I've cried at least 5 times throughout that game. Geralt, Ciri, Triss, Yen, everyone has their own character and unique traits. Even more minor characters have a ton of little things you can pick up on. I could go ON and ON about how fantastic this game is, but I just don't have the time. If you want to learn more about it, check out Angry Joe's review. There are some weird scenes in the review, but once you finish the game they make a lot of sense and are actually pretty funny. Also, sexy time scenes.  At least check it out, it's probably my favorite game of all time. Yes, even above Bioshock as ""shocking"" as that may be. (lol get it i am funny)  One more thing, the company that makes The Witcher, CD Project Red, is one of my favorite companies of all time. They listen to everything the fans have to say. In fact, just a couple weeks back there was a thread about how a certain character didn't get enough screen time, so they got all the voice actors back and are writing more dialogue for that character. They really do care.  EDIT: Also, a couple more cool things about the game, 16 free DLC, the 2 paid DLC it's coming out with is about the size of The Witcher 2 (30 hrs), and it's DRM free. Also should mention I'm on my second playthrough and have 215 hours on the game. That's ~100 hours a playthrough, not to mention it's highly replayable. Even if you play on ""Just the story"" difficulty and only do the main quest and maybe a couple side quest that effect your relationship with other important characters, you should at least get around 50 hrs in.   And finally, check us out on /r/witcher if you have ANY questions, or if it's a simple little question, feel free to PM me. I love this game and can help you with almost anything."

Bioshock,3djqws,NaturalPanic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"not trying to be mean or anything but i think if you played the game 3 times you should know how traps work. if you hold down you absorb the bullets and then you can throw the shield to an enemy or on the ground. if you throw it on the ground it will stay there until an enemy walks over it like any other vigor trap, after which it will trigger. the dmg of return the sender depends on how many bullets it has absorbed."

Bioshock,3dep3k,_Foraii_,31,Wed Jul 15 18:09:20 2015 UTC,This is a pretty accurate timeline of the game.
Bioshock,3dep3k,Rustyfeathers,36,Wed Jul 15 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"This chart is pretty decent, but it leaves out what I think is one of the most important points in terms of understanding the ending:   Throughout the game, over and over again, Elizabeth and Booker essentially invade another timeline and then overwrite the copies of themselves which previously existed there; they acquire some of the native versions of themselves's memories and such, which is occasionally traumatic, but the point is that the version doing the invading replaces the version which was already there.   Elizabeth takes ""our"" ""modern"" Booker back to the moment before his would-be baptism, and thus while he retains the experiences of the entire game up to that point and all the years before it, at that moment he IS his own younger self, having replaced that pre-baptismal Booker/Comstock.   So when Elizabeth murders him there in the pool, she's not just killing modern-day Booker, but the young Booker and any version which might have branched off from that moment, including, she hoped, any version which might have become Comstock, leaving only versions of Booker in the multiverse who never came down to that pond at all."

Bioshock,3dep3k,Somethingfishy4,10,Thu Jul 16 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"The way I saw it:  Elizabeth became omniscient when the siphon was destroyed. She regained full use of her powers (which she has because her pinky was left in one universe, and she is in another). She is now able to see all universes and what is in each one.  She explains this to Booker when they are going through the lighthouses. She shows him his past, before he went to Columbia. He was a Pinkerton who was thrown out of that organization. He accued a massive gambling debt, but had no way to pay it off. Robert Lutece is Booker Universe version of Rosalind, and he enters the picture now working for Comstock.  You see, Rosalind was experimenting with quantam physics and particles and stuff, and so was Robert. They were able to communicate via morse code through universes. They worked together and built the tear machine, and Robert came to Columbia.  Comstock knew of this, and he used the tear machine to predict the future (hence his nick name, Prophet). He sees in the future, Elizabeth burns down cities from Columbia. But he is sterile because of all the times he used the machine. So he decides to take his daughter, but from another dimension (Bookers).  Robert is sent to get Anna from Booker, and he will wipe away Booker's debt. Booker accepts, but has a change of heart. He encounters the tear with Comstock and the Lutece twins, and struggles to take Anna back. However, Comstock gets away with her, but Anna's finger was lost in the process. Now Anna lives in Constocks universe, but she has special powers now because her body was seperated.  Comstocks wife couldn't live with the guilt, and she wanted to tell Anna the truth (now renamed Elizabeth). Comstock is having none of that, and kills his wife and blames it on Daisy. Robert is having guilt as well, and tells Rosalind they are going to reuinite Booker with his daughter. Comstock figures it out, and sabotages their tear machine. When the Twins used it, they are killed in this Columbia and are seperated through time and space. They can travel any universe, any time. They cannot interact with the universe they died in, unless they want to become quantum supercomposed or whatever it is called. That is explained more in the Burial at Sea DLC.  So while Elizabeth is locked up because Comstock fears her powers, the twins bring Booker from his Universe to Comstock's. The transition makes him lose his memory, and he fills in missing spaces with ""bring the girl, wipe away the debt"" even though the meaning is different from the original.  Elizabeth shows Booker all of this. They decide to make sure Comstock is never born, so none of this evil transpires. They need to kill the idea of Comstock.  Elizabeth goes back in time with Booker, to the time where Booker is alive after his battle at Wounded Knee. He is presented a choice (variables), but he is always there with a choice (constants). In one path, Booker declines the baptism, and lives on as a Pinkerton and has a daughter Anna. In the other path, Booker accepts the baptism and changes his life outlook and name, to Comstock and he goes on to create Columbia. Booker and Comstock are the same person, but from created from different choices and therefore from different universes. The Multiverse Theory.  Elizabeth drowns Booker as he accepts/accepted the Baptism, killing him. This ensures, at the EXACT point Comstock was made, that he died. Therefore, there are no Universes where Comstock is alive because the original Comstock drowned. This creates a paradox, as Elizabeth cannot exist with a Comstock.  The end credits scene shows a Booker back in his Pinkerton office and he goes to check on Anna (who may or may not be there).  I hope I cleared that up for you! I highly suggest playing Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2 as well, as I thought they were amazing."

Bioshock,3dep3k,DudeItsVolcom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:07:53 2015 UTC,"The tie-in is more with the DLC itself. Infinite only shows a small portion of Rapture, and that is at the end where Elizabeth is taking Booker through the lighthouses. ""There is always a man, and always a lighthouse."" she tells Booker this. Ryan + Rapture, Comstock + Columbia.  The scene itself, in Infinite, is rather short. Elizabeth and Booker go to Rapture right before it falls. They are in the same area as Jack Ryan was when he took his first plasmid!  As for Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2 (massive, MASSIVE spoilers ahead for the DLC and how it ties into Bioshock 1)  As for the DLC though: Elizabeth from Infinite wants to cleanse the universes of all Comstocks. She thought she did this at the end of Infinite, but there was one universe in which a Comstock survived.  This specific Comstock was after Anna, as usual. Except, the way Anna was pulled through the tear was different. She was decapitated. Infinite Elizabeth was there, trying to stop Comstock. She could feel it everytime an Anna died or was in pain, so she traveled to this universe to stop this Comstock. This Anna was decapitated, and (I assume) that Infinite Elizabeth decided to leave that universe to grief or something.  This Comstock that decapitated this Booker's daughter went into full on grief mode. He turned away from his life as Comstock, and he wanted nothing to do with Columbia or his universe. So her hired the Luteces to use their tear machine to bring him into another universe were he could forget everything. The twins brought him to Rapture (Bioshock 1 Rapture).  Now this is debated, but I believe this Comstock was saved by the purge made in the Infinite Ending because he traveled to another universe, and was therefore safe from the purge Elizabeth and Booker performed.  Anyways, that Comstock went to Rapture but lost his memories, and took on his old name, Booker DeWitt. He became a notorious private detective in Rapture. Infinite Elizabeth got over her grief, and decided to hunt this Comstock down. She found him, and created a plan so this Comstock would feel pain and remember who he was.  Elizabeth ended up using a Little Sister named Sally to get back at Comstock. Sally was Comstock's adopted daughter in Rapture, who was stolen when Comstock was at a gambling table. Sander Cohen stole the child, and eventually had her turned into a Little Sister. Elizabeth knew of this, and used it against Comstock.  At the end of Burial at Sea Episode 1, after Comstock and Elizabeth found Sally after searching the entire DLC, Comstock sees that Sally has been turned into a Little Sister. This, coupled with Elizabeth's explanation of who Comstock used to be, was a massive revelation for Comstock. He remembered who he was before in the previous universe, and what he did to Anna there. Elizabeth got her revenge, and Comstock died shortly after by a Big Daddy.  Cue Episode 2, where Elizabeth died shortly after as well at the hands of the same Big Daddy. This only kills her in this specific universe though, as she is omniscient and able to go anywhere and everywhere. She dies, and lives out a fantasy in Paris. But the guilt of using Sally (she turned up the heat in the vents to a ridiculous amount to lure Sally out in Episode 1, basically ignoring the safety of Sally and exploiting her just to get back at Comstock) was too much to bear, and Elizabeth started to see hallucinations of her. So Elizabeth decided to go back into the same universe she died in.  This is a major, MAJOR problem for Elizabeth. It is explained by the twins. As I explained in my previous post, going into a universe where you already died is called: ""quantum supercomposed"" I believe. The all powerful Elizabeth had her powers stripped, and is now a regular mortal girl in Rapture. No more tears or anything. She has memories, but is unable to access them.  She wakes up to see Atlas (Frank Fontaine) kidnapping Sally. Elizabeth is imagining Booker (from Infinite) in the background. He is obviously not real, but just a way for her mind to get her the information she needs. She tells Atlas exactly what he needs to hear, and that is known to her through the Booker hallucination. She knows exactly what to say, because she remembers what lies beyond this door. Essentially, when she was all powerful, she knew everything. She knew there existed a universe where she would end up by Atlas, and she knew what to say to get him to comply. But she forget all her memories when she was quantum supercomposed. Throughout the DLC, she remembers some memories. As an example, she remembers what happens in this universe sometimes. And that memory is shown/told to her by Booker.  Anyways, she tells Atlas she can get his building (which was sunk by Andrew Ryan to the bottom of the ocean beneath Rapture) back up top by using a quantum particle. Frank Fontaine and Andrew Ryan were enemies before, and Ryan had enough of Frank's shit and basically sunk his building (Fontaine Industries).  They made the deal, one quantum particle in exchange for Sally. Elizabeth travels through Rapture, remembering some memories from before and talking to her imaginary Booker (her only true friend). She needs to get the particle from somewhere, but Rapture doesn't have that technology. But Columbia does.  She uses a tear machine in Dr. Suchongs office (who built it by communicating and watching through tears from Columbia + Fink) and travels to Columbia. This Columbia is the same Columbia as the one in Bioshock Infinite. Some argue why this Columbia exists if all Comstocks are dead, but I believe that it is from her past and wont properly disappear until Elizabeth dies.  She travels through Columbia, learning about the origins of the Songbird, and more info on Daisy Fitzroy. She grabs the particle, and hauls ass back to Rapture. But Suchong doesn't let her until he gets a piece of hair from the subject Fink used to build his tears. Suchong doesn't know that Elizabeth was the person the hair was from and the person he wants to have to help him build all his crazy tears and stuff.  She comes back to Rapture, gives Suchong the hair, and gets ambushed by Ryan's henchmen. She escapes, and puts the particle in the proper place in the building and the building floats back up to Rapture. Cue spliced up enemies attacking Rapture: the fall of Rapture. Atlas doesn't hold up his end of the bargain though, as he doesn't give Elizabeth Sally. He wants something more important than bringing his building up from the depths. He wants his ""Ace in the Hole"" aka Jack Ryan.  Jack Ryan is the offspring of Andrew Ryan, and a stripper by the name of Josephine I believe. Ryan didn't want the kid, but Josephine was contacted by Frank and Suchong. The kid was given to Suchong. He was experimented on, and was absolutely 100% loyal to the phrase: ""Would You Kindly"". The kid was genetically modified to mature quickly, and was sent topside earlier before the DLC. He was given false memories of a family and a life, but in reality was just waiting.  Atlas wanted Jack Ryan, because he knew he could get Jack to kill his father and then Atlas would take over Rapture. Earlier in the DLC, when Elizabeth first met Atlas, I explained how she said the right things to get Atlas to help. She told him she was Suchong's lab assistant (Suchong, after the experiments, went on to work for Andrew Ryan). Because of that, Atlas thought she would know where Jack Ryan was being kept.  She obviously didn't have the answer because she never worked for Suchong, but through Booker again she remembered what to say. She remembered the key to finding Jack Ryan was in Suchong's office, and she told Atlas that (after a scene which rivals Dead Space 2's eye surgey scene).  But she didn't tell him because she was worried for her life. Elizabeth wanted to die at that point. She became like her two fathers (Booker, selling his daughter for a debt. And Comstock, using his daughter) by using Sally. She experienced a tremendous amount of hardship in her life. She was ready to die when she was quantum supercomposed, and she was ready to die know. She just wanted Sally safe in the end, to atone for her sins. She wanted to break the cycle of violence that plagues her family.  So when Atlas threatened her life, she didn't even flinch. But Atlas then threatened the life of Sally, and Elizabeth folded. She agreed to help Atlas get his Ace in the Hole.  She wanders over to Suchongs office, and learns the nature of the bonding that happens between Big Daddys and Little Sisters (the Big Daddys need the ADAM the Little Sisters give them). She also witnesses the death of Suchong himself, which can be also seen in Bioshock 1.  She finds a note, which explains where Jack is and what his activation phrase is (Would You Kindly). The final scene of the game is Elizabeth walking down a dark tunnel, with Atlas and his thugs at the end with Sally. But she already knows what is going to happen.  continued in my next post"
Bioshock,3dep3k,Jaraghan,2,Sun Jul 19 06:08:37 2015 UTC,"She remembers from a memory what ultimately happens in this universe, the ultimate reason why she risked her life becoming supercomposed: Jack Ryan, in the end, kills Frank Fontaine and saves the Little Sisters, including Anna. Jack Ryan, the ultimate hero of the series.  Elizabeth remembers this was the reason why she came back to clear her conscience and her guilt. She gives Atlas the note, already knowing she is handing him his death sentence. Atlas then cheers with his thugs, and hits Elizabeth over the head with a wrench a couple of times. Atlas then goes on to send Jack a message to hi-jack a plane and come to Rapture. Bioshock 1 stars there.  Elizabeth relives all of the moments she saw in Bioshock 1 (Jack killing Andrew, Jack killing Fontaine, Jack rescuing the Little Sisters topside, etc.), all the while Sally was singing to Elizabeth ""La Vi En Rose"", and Elizabeth touching Sally's cheek. Elizabeth then dies with blood dripping down her head, and the camera pans outwards. After the credits, the ship Jack forces down is seen crashing into the water above Rapture.  And then there was no more Comstocks or Elizabeths, and the fate of Rapture happens in Bioshock 1 (the good ending is canon). Bioshock 2 was sort of left out in the dust, and there are some popular theories out there that say Bioshock 2 was never canon.  Anyways, the DLC is what really connects Infinite with Bioshock 1. I'm sure I missed a few plot points, but that is the jist of it. If you plan on playing through Infinite and Burial at Sea, bring a box of tissues because god damn does it get emotional. The Bioshock series is one of my favorites! Great writing, great characters, great settings. You should really try out Infinite and the DLC for it!"

You see the corruption inherent in Booker/Comstock and his progeny, but that they can sacrifice themselves to achieve some good.  Elizabeth, being the omniscient force she was, couldn't go on existing and not stress the multiverse.  The ability to see all like the Luteces, but also to physically mettle with all, is a recipe for a Icarian downfall."
Bioshock,3dep3k,mightystu,2,Thu Jul 16 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't like the ending and thought that it was trying to be more clever than it actually was. As a result, I think this video from Matthew Matosis actually describes the ending fairly well. That said, he does have a negative opinion of the ending (""I understood it, and I didn't like it"") so it is a bit biased towards that."
Bioshock,3dep3k,Chronis67,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:31:10 2015 UTC,"Comstock is an alternate version of Booker Dewitt who in his reality accepted the baptism (unlike the Booker we played in the game who declined the baptism) , and went on to build Columbia. However his exposure to the lutece tear device rendered him sterile. Wanting an heir, he goes into the alternate reality of our Booker who declined the baptism to make a deal: bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt. So our Booker gave anna/elizabeth away to pay off his gambling debts. It doesn't take long for him to regret the decision, and he gives chase to bring her back before Comstock enters the tear back to Columbia. He fails however, and Comstock for the next few years, grooms Anna to be his daughter and heir.   However, the lutece twins foresaw with their tear device a horrible future of an older Elizabeth burning down New York ( drowning in flame the mountains of man). Robert convinces her sister/alternate counterpart, Rosalind to fix what they had done by bringing our Booker into the Columbia reality. In a drunken and depressed state, our Booker began creating new memories from his old one. In this case, he believes that he has been sent to Columbia by men from New York to pay off his gambling debts, unable to recall the memories of his deal with Comstock until at the end of the game where Elizabeth showed him.  Infinite operates on a mostly deterministic world. While there are many worlds generated from your choice, there are things that will always remain the same. This is where the ""constants"" in the constants and variables line comes in. Much like the choices you make in the single-player campaign, the infinite possibilities are in some cases an illusion. For example, after you see the other Booker and Elizabeth coming out of the lighthouse, you have three lighthouses you can enter in, but no matter which you pick, you end up with the scene with Robert coming to take Anna from Booker on behalf of Comstock. Not only was this an example of the illusion of choice, but this was also an example of a constant. There is no reality where a declined Booker didn't sell his daughter to Comstock. There are other examples of constants in the story, such as how it is constant that a Booker who accepts the baptism becomes Comstock and builds Columbia.  The only way to prevent Comstock from ever existing is to go to the root of the alternate Comstock universes and prevent the fatal choice from ever happening. The baptism is a choice-based incident that creates an infinite number of alternate universes as a result of that choice. Therefore it is impossible to hunt down and kill every Booker or every Comstock in every universe . The only way to eliminate ALL of them is to go to the origin of each branching Comstock realiy, which is the baptism. By killing Booker at the baptism( whose sub-concious was merged with the pre-Comstock Booker), which is a seed for an infinite number of worlds, none of those worlds exist.  The killing of Booker at the baptism is not a choice, so it does not create alternate universes where the Elizabeths don't drown Booker. There is only the single outcome.  Any conflicts with this theory are remedied by the fact Elizabeth is a quantum dimensional superbeing with complete and absolute control over every universe that exists, will exist, or can exist. It stands to reason that Elizabeth could be ""closing all the doors"" herself."

I thought the gameplay was a little repetitive but the last 30 minutes or so made it all worth it. Pretty mind-blowing as you can see by some of the explanations in this thread."
Bioshock,3dep3k,Obi_Wan_Benobi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:12:34 2015 UTC,"In it's simplest form, the ending is debated for being a paradox. elizabeth kills booker before he becomes comstock, therefore killing all comstocks. but without comstock, there would be no elizabeth, so she couldn't take booker back to kill comstock, etc. the multi dimensions and tears and anna being elizabeth and booker being comstock makes for a really cool video game, but you can't avoid the paradox. a majority of stories involving time travel or multiverses usually end up in a paradox too. i absolutely love the game, and the DLC chapters expand on the whole story a little bit too. but the ending of infinite is simply a paradox, plain and simple."
Bioshock,3dep3k,raulduke05,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially because in an actual infinite universe system like the game shows, there would be so many universes where Comstock comes to exist later in Booker's life, or earlier, is baptized somewhere else, etc.  I know the whole constants and variables is meant to explain it away, but I don't feel like that really does it adequately.  Why are they that way?  It kinda just introduces the idea without elaborating on it or leaving the player any room to expound or interpret, just kinda says ""it's like this, because it is."""
Bioshock,3dep3k,mightystu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:27:52 2015 UTC,"I know the whole constants and variables is meant to explain it away, but I don't feel like that really does it adequately. Why are they that way?   Because the creator, Ken Levine, is all about the illusion of choice and has expanded that idea from the first Bioshock to the multiverse. in Infinite. That is where the ""constant"" comes to play in the whole constants and variables. Despite there being so many choices, there are some things that will remain the same, such as Booker selling Anna to Comstock."
Bioshock,3dep3k,snyderman567,0,Thu Jul 16 02:55:48 2015 UTC,"But they already established a previous variable in the universe, which is that Lutece is either born a man or a woman.  In the game Rosalind is in the Comstock timeline and Robert in regular Bookers, but there would also be timelines where that is reversed which is never touched on.  To actually be Infinite in the way the game seems to suggest, it's simple ""solution"" wouldn't actually solve anything.  Also, the previous Bioshock games were not about the illusion of choice.  Your choices had a very real impact, both on the story and the gameplay as you limited your ADAM collection, but got access to unique plasmids and gene tonics.  This was expanded upon in Bioshock 2, but is reversed in Infinite.  I can understand Ken's attempt to set up a meta narrative on video games, but it's not really a continuation of previous themes, but rather a departure from them.  Ultimately though, I don't feel like the notion of constants and variables is adequately presented or implemented, and isn't really explained much either.  They just kind of say they exist, but make no effort to explain why the things that are constant remain as such.  This would've been an excellent point to expand upon, but the game essentially just says ""because I said they are.  Don't think about it."""
Bioshock,3dep3k,mightystu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:04:48 2015 UTC,"But they already established a previous variable in the universe, which is that Lutece is either born a man or a woman. In the game Rosalind is in the Comstock timeline and Robert in regular Bookers,   Its never said that Robert is from the Booker universe.It was also my interpretation that much like choice in Infinite, the idea of infinite possibilities is in some cases an illusion.   Also, the previous Bioshock games were not about the illusion of choice. Your choices had a very real impact, both on the story and the gameplay as you limited your ADAM collection, but got access to unique plasmids and gene tonics.   Well  the choices you made in Bioshock  only impacted the story in regards to one of the lackluster endings you got, which Ken Levine has stated that he did not wanted to do alternate endings and that he was demanded to by 2k.   ""It was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me. One of the reasons I was opposed to multiple endings is I never want to do things that have multiple digital outcomes, versus analog outcomes.""- Ken Levine interview by bitgamer  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=JwsjALh2vYA#t=3191s  That is why Infinite only has a single ending and Bioshock 2 which was not made by Levine built upon the impact of choices, since it was made by the publisher that demanded the endings. This would make sense considering that the end of BaS seems to make the good ending to Bioshock canon.  Regardless of whether or not you save or harvest the little sisters, the story is going to play out the same until you get to the end cutscene. There are no branching narrative paths or other real impact on the story based on your decisions.  Also the illusion of choice is present within the narrative of Bio 1.   The power of this scene is because it calls out the player. Most games centered on player choice are about the illusion of choice and supposed control, but by playing a game and indulging in its instructions you are actually letting a game control you. If the game says run, you run. If the game says kill, you kill. You don't question is because that's what you're supposed to do. That's what you're told, and you do what you're told, and that makes you a slave.  Take the scene with Ryan for example near the end of the game.   Spoilers for Bioshock 1!!!  What is incredible about that scene is that the game takes control away from you. You don't have a choice to kill Andrew Ryan, but the game calls you out and says you would have done it anyway because you do whatever you're told.   Then Atlas tells you to put the genetic key into the machine. And even with what you were just told, and even with what was just demonstrated to you, what do you do as a player? Even when you KNOW that performing the action screws you, what do you do?  You obey. You are a slave. You have been a slave for the entire game. Even after that you are still obeying orders from Tennenbaum until the end.  Also by illusion of choice I really mean in regards to the narrative, not gameplay."

Bioshock,3dcpkb,vansc14,3,Wed Jul 15 10:34:44 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, I haven't read the linked files yet, but here are my ideas/thoughts so far.  I think the idea of having a city on the dark side of the moon would be a great place to put it. A space station would be very cliche, but the dark side of the moon is something j can definitely seen Andrew Ryan doing. I noticed several Russian souring words and names, so I think it should take place during the U.S./USSR race to get to the moon, but happen earlier, say mid 1950's at its high point. This being a side project of Ryan's that he put in charge of someone else before permanently going into rapture, maybe even going as far as to have a genetic clone of Andrew Ryan being the leader of the moon city. With Jack it is shown that cloning is possible in Rapture, or at least to some extent. Another possibility would be Ryan having a half brother or half sister that he didn't know about, possibly that his father had an affair or his mother got raped or had an affair. Since the john Shirley novel confirmed that Andrew Ryan was born in Russia, Ryan having an unknown half sibling still in Russia could be a possibility.  Anyway, aside from all that, I think that the whole idea sounds great, and I would love for an official bioshock game to be released."

Bioshock,3d8hof,Lwsrocks,15,Wed Jul 15 06:20:39 2015 UTC,"The moon theory sounds absolutely amazing and I would love it if we got to explore space in Bioshock style (who could say no to a space version of Big Daddy/ Songbird, right?). It's also worth mentioning that in the early chapters of Infinite at the Raffle, when Booker's first introduced to the Possession Vigor, you can overhear a couple talking about the Automated Stallions in awe, obviously admiring the advanced technology, and mentioning how Fink and Lutece will soon send people to the moon, calling them ""moon people"".  For the record though, making another Bioshock will be an extremely challenging task. As much as I want to see another lighthouse, another man and another city, there's a lot to a successful Bioshock game formula and I guess we're all worried about how will that be pulled off without Irrational :(.

Bioshock,3d8hof,Storm_Cutter,2,Wed Jul 15 08:34:45 2015 UTC,"I hope they make a giant moving city. The city would exist out of multiple gigantic walkers, carrying the city's different parts. Each walker would exist out of different layers.  The city would be permanently shrouded in fog (which would be generated on one of the walkers), to mystify it's existence. Picking up people happens with moveable watchtowers (there must always be a watchtower)  The bottom one being the dangerous mining/gathering supplies zone, where they hang out of the moving legs to take things from the earth. (or gigantic nets to catch fish, birds, animals).  The next layer would be the machinery, where they fuel the gigantic legs, and where they stabilize the movements so the city doesn't fall apart or shake at all.  In front of the cities would be control centers to steer the gigantic city, and the main communication center.  One Walker would be a mining facility with giant drills attached to its legs. Here would they be able to harvest rare ores (which would also serve as mystical powers comparable to Vigors and Plasmids.  There could be one giant walker walking in the middle of the others, where the commander would be. He controls the walkers, but he gives the command of the other walkers to generals on those part of the cities. This walker would also contain the houses of the more priviliged citizens  Traveling between the locations could be with the use of cannons which fire necessary goods and supplies.  People don't travel between them, expect the higher commanding officers, but the rest of the people live and die in their Walker. This is also a sort of segregation. Each Walker has it's own main product for the other Walkers.  The theme's would mostly be about apartheid and segregation"

Although it does have a connection to Rapture in that they would draw their energy from the Earth's heat, I love the idea of a city built on fire. Perhaps a move away from Western culture would suit this idea more, I'm not sure, but a massive volcano would be the perfect cover for a city to remain hidden.   There's something about that symbolism I really love. However the space ideas are really exciting. A shame that they're only dreams..

Bioshock,3d8hof,Storm_Cutter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:36:21 2015 UTC,"Return to Rapture.  The original Bioshock being built off of the book of Atlas Shrugged, the next will be based off of a book aptly titled ""Future Shock"" by Alvin Toffler. The game will be a free-roaming, fully evolved city under the sea that the player can interact with through its array of amazing 1950's super-technologies.  Imagine the massive difference between Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 being done to Bioshock. (For what we have seen of Fallout 4)  The year is 1970.  Much of Rapture is a dilapidated mess, though remnants of its regality show the slightest hint of return. What does roam are the splicers of course, either organized or not. Now, there are Big Daddies that have also mutated in lacking their Little Sister counter-parts - curiously so. Along the darker lines are mummers and fearings of a new terror in the deep: The Big Brother.  Imagine the fear inspiring figure like this, but with a blow-torch-drill-arm. Nothing stands in its way, whichever direction that is.  Entering the world of Rapture is The Granddaughter of Andrew Ryan, who was born upon the surface world where Jack Ryan settled in his house provided - with a newly wedded wife and a lot of orphans. Of the little sisters saved from the original bioshock, most were adopted with one being the exception who dreams of Rapture.   With the evolved DNA of the Granddaughter, you as the player can combine plasmids under dual-wield; access Ryan-only areas; and swing a bigger wrench. With the key to the city - anything is plausible to violence, silence, or voicing your way through Rapture. In the nostalgia of the Orphan, she returns in hopes of finding her past identity which is but a mysterious dream to her. Still discovering her poltergeist-like powers in tandem with psychic-paranormal mentality that allows the orphan to see Rapture's ghosts and the vision of little sisters, her becoming identity - along with the Granddaughter's - is parallel to Rapture's return or downfall.  Amidst the chaotic downpour that is current state of Rapture, a last bastion of humanity remains to a remnant testimony to the ""good"" of the city. The rules of this Refuge retain to the regulations of biblical order from what was surface-world smuggled to and fro, prior to the civil war that tore down the city's organized societies. This is where the Survivor comes into view - with a history of deployment in the Pacific Theatre, then hired to protect the secret of Rapture's existence by force, this character survives the hectic hallways of the undersea city by means of tinkering, inventing, hacking, and exploring.   By such means does he discover the Prototype: a secret project forged for the sole sake of creating the perfect protector of not only the little sisters, but Rapture itself. Mentally constructed to recognized problems and solve them, the prototype is everything glamorized about the Big Daddy and potentially all the worst. He was, and now is, the only known of his kind in a series of an apparent attempt to create a figurehead of Rapturian ingenuity and science. Will his programming become his ultimate undoing, or will the knowhow and knowledge instilled within shed light on a very dark place.   With Rapture mapped out and fully explorable, there are foes, villains, and masterminds to find. The undersea city is barely maintained by a super-computing machine that has neither negative nor positive connotations, The Thinker as it is referred to. It is that which has connections to much of the city through live feed cameras and security robots that has neutralized much conflict and threat through mollification. The setting includes the Atlantic Express and Austen Bathyspheres, along with sewer tunnels, walkways, elevators, escalators, etc. as means of travel. What remains of Rapture is yours to discover and play with, the city is at your disposal for a revival to succeed or to rescind into the ultimate doom. Choose your character, choose your choices, and let the rest choose you."

And you know she's going to make Elanor and the Little Sister's life hell. Sinclair was an awful morally bankrupt person during most of Rapture, but he turned around at the end. Plus he clearly could empathize with others and treated Delta with real kindness the farther along you got and the more he saw you as a ""friend"" and not just a tool. Sinclair had the BEST chance of actually helping everyone's situation, (making money for the care of the little girls, hiring doctors to fix Delta and himself, giving Elanor a private island base to launch her first world domination)  and if I had to bet I'd say he'd have the good sense not to sell off the idea of ADAM especially considering there's no access to the sea slugs except in the Sister's bodies and there's no way in hell he'd be allowed to harvest them. He's a smart businessman after all, if a previously morally bankrupt one. I had real hope that he would have turned around and never repeated the past mistakes. And LAMB DIDN'T DESERVE TO LIVE BECAUSE SHE'S CRAZIER THAN A ROIDED UP BEAR AND I WILL BET MY LAST DOLLAR IS 100% GOING TO FUCK SOMETHING UP IN HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BLOOD SPLATTERING WAYS.  Also I'm sad that no matter what you chose, the people you ""saved"" still died when the bombs went off. Grace didn't deserve that.  I have a lot of Bioshock feels.  Edit: Removed some swearing.

Bioshock,3d240e,Tiggex,8,Sun Jul 12 22:20:39 2015 UTC,"pretty sure it's supposed to be ""will the circle be unbroken"" a song that's used later in the game"
Bioshock,3d240e,johhny_topside,5,Sun Jul 12 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely a piano reprise version of Will the Circle be Unbroken, it's pretty noticeable with the next scene having it sung in the background as well with its original lyrics."
Bioshock,3d240e,alishock,3,Mon Jul 13 01:27:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah you are right, it is probably a piano variation of Will the Circle be Unbroken which would makes sense. This all seemed a bit too good to be true so I had least had to ask :)."

Bioshock,3d397l,VIsForVoltz2,18,Mon Jul 13 04:16:47 2015 UTC,"Most people here do love Infinite, but it doesn't make you wrong for disliking it. It also doesn't mean everyone that does like it is wrong either. It's just a matter of differing opinions is all."

Bioshock,3d397l,Raggedy-Man,9,Mon Jul 13 15:59:23 2015 UTC,I thought the combat was boring and the story was a convoluted mess.  The feel and atmosphere of the first two Bioshock games is what made me love them.
Bioshock,3d397l,PatrickBearman,3,Mon Jul 13 13:05:07 2015 UTC,Different tastes. No reason to feel bad about it.
Bioshock,3d397l,davis98,6,Mon Jul 13 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same boat, even though I like Infinite. I just can't get into it as much as I can Rapture."
Bioshock,3d397l,USBM,-2,Mon Jul 13 05:20:47 2015 UTC,Well of course
Bioshock,3d397l,CaptnAwesomeGuy,5,Mon Jul 13 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"I liked Infinite. My thoughts on it were that it was a good a game, but a bad bioshock game.  As in if it had been released as just ""Infinite"" I would have liked it a lot more.  I personally thought it was just lacking too many of the features that I had associated with the Bioshock series.  Rapture was very claustrophobic and there was a constant feeling that everything was about to coming crashing down any moment.  As we know from the opening sequence Columbia (for the majority of the game) is very open with lots of space.  Rapture had a very uneasy atmosphere.  While I'm not sure I'd call it horror It absolutely has those moments where you just want to crap your pants.  For the most part I never really got the same vibes from Infinite.  There was that level with the boys of silence but after that there isn't much else thats scary.  Resources also felt very different.  In 1 and 2 I felt like a scavenger.  I was looking for scraps just to survive. Bullets, eve, and health could get scarce.  In Infinite Elizabeth keeps you topped off when you start to get too low. This isn't huge by any means but I really missed how weapon upgrades visually effected weapons.  It completely makes sense that they'd have to scrap it because Booker is constantly picking up and dropping weapons as opposed to Jack and Delta who pick em up and use them for the remainder of the game but I miss it nonetheless.  The macgyvered weapons reinforced the idea that you were a survivor who was using whatever bits and bobs they had available to keeps themselves alive.  In a way I always felt that it embodied the rapture spirit.  You're one the best and brightest who is using their wits to upgrade guns with garbage. And because I'm starting to get tired I'll just bring up one last point.  I think Elizabeth was absolutely amazing.  Never felt like an escort mission where I was stuck baby sitting some brain dead AI.  I love Elizabeth.  But in some ways in my mind it felt a little off not being alone in a bioshock game.  Sure while Jack, Delta, and Sigma had people guiding them in their quest and occasionally giving them supplies but when they walked the halls of rapture they did so alone.  It was them against the entire city.  It fed into the feeling the despair that followed you through out the game.  If things took a turn for the worst the person of the other side of the radio could maybe say a few kind words of encouragement but you couldn't turn to them.  All that said I want to really drive home that I dont hate Infinite or thing it was a bad game.  I thought it was great for what it was.  My one gripe came in that (in my completely subjective bias personal opinion) it didn't feel much like a Bioshock game to me.  They certainly share many themes and elements (as they should) but the atmospheres felt pretty different in my mind.  BaS felt like it was returning to it's roots but not so much for the base game.  tl;dr -  Infinite is a great game, but i dont think its a great bioshock game."
Bioshock,3d397l,BioshockedNinja,7,Mon Jul 13 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"I thought it was magnificent,  but no it didn't feel like a bioshock game,  there was no scares,  no psychological thrills,  no terror only drama, it felt like an experiment,  a fantastic one,  but not a deep dark exploration of a broken utopia"
Bioshock,3d397l,Spidertech500,-6,Mon Jul 13 13:20:52 2015 UTC,I don't understand the downvotes.  It didn't have any of those things.
Bioshock,3d397l,mightystu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe its because we are tired of hearing purists saying over and over again "" this doesn't feel like a Bioshock game""."
Bioshock,3d397l,AlphaBigmomma,0,Wed Jul 15 03:44:24 2015 UTC,That doesn't make it any less accurate.  Everything he said was accurate.  Are you just saying because you don't like it it isn't true?  Maybe we're tired of hearing how a series we love lost a lot of what made us first love it in the first place.  That doesn't mean we can't discuss and debate and share ideas.
Bioshock,3d397l,mightystu,7,Wed Jul 15 04:00:45 2015 UTC,"I liked it, but I didn't love it like I did BioShock 1 and 2.  I felt the tears just made the scenery messy, yes theyre a nice combat feature but overall wasn't a fan."
Bioshock,3d397l,sir_wiggum,2,Mon Jul 13 12:53:48 2015 UTC,Nah.  I loved the story but both gameplay and (can't for the life of me remember the word but the aesthetic feel) of Columbia was way worse than than Bioshock 1/2 and rapture.  Edit* although I loved the story it drifted into meh territory after a while  and didn't feel as genuine until the very last bit where the multiverse bit came.  Edit2* When I think about it I don't even think I would rank it above BS2 in terms of story...
Bioshock,3d397l,RoadRunnerdn,2,Mon Jul 13 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't like they got rid of having different ammo per weapon (minus the crossbow in BaS 2) or tonics (yeah, there's gear, but you don't get to choose what you want really). I did like how upgrades to vigors actually added new features, whereas plasmid upgrades only made them stronger (i.e Electro Bolt 2 was just more powerful than 1, while one of the Shock Jockey upgrades allowed you to chain bolts across enemies). Everything else I'd say has already been said multiple times in relation to the story."
Bioshock,3d397l,AviatorHotdog,2,Tue Jul 14 04:15:27 2015 UTC,It's okay.
Bioshock,3d397l,NotBookerDeWitt,2,Tue Jul 14 17:40:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, it really did not feel like a Bioshock game. It was a good game for what it was, but I really missed going to Rapture. I really like the city of Columbia, but I think that I would feel differently about it if it had the same feeling of Rapture, I missed all of the batshit crazy splicers and the only (supposedly sane) person you never see until the end of the game. I really enjoy Elizabeth though, but the whole multiverse story with her seams kind of out of the blue, and the whole thing with Booker being her father felt kind of forced in to me.  It would be like if at the end of The Last Of Us Elle turned out to be the ghost of Sarah or something like that. But I think I would have enjoyed the game if it was entirely its own thing (Not a Bioshock game), but that is just my opinion."
Bioshock,3d397l,Kuvasz,2,Fri Jul 17 12:34:10 2015 UTC,"I whole heartedly agree to your points raised about Bio shock Infinite. To add to that, I would rather have played the outcome of the Gameplay trailers instead of the miss mashed overkill of American exceptionalism that is Infinite.   Indeed, Infinite is over-hyped and I have found that there seems to be a type of Infinite-Exceptionalism amongst fans for Infinite and Burial at Sea."

Bioshock,3d397l,infiniteloooop,3,Mon Jul 13 18:01:01 2015 UTC,"If you strip the sound out of Bioshock 1, you wreck the game. Same with Infinite. The appeal of the Bioshock games has always been, for me, the sound design. It's some of the best I've ever seen in any game, and I've been gaming for a long time.  1 had that wonderfully creepy, you-are-in-a-giant-insane-asylum feel almost entirely because of what you hear, from the off kilter music to random screaming and angry shouting.   Infinite took you, through sound, from initial paradise right down into hell. When I first launched the game and rode the elevator down into the cathedral with ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" playing, I stayed in there for 15 minutes just listening. I knew the game was going to be another smash hit, soundwise. And it was.   From that perspective, Infinite was every bit as good as 1.   But I can certainly see where people who are more attracted to good combat mechanics or puzzles vs combat would be at least mildly disappointed."
Bioshock,3d397l,Eslader,2,Mon Jul 13 18:31:39 2015 UTC,Its all a matter of opinion. There is nothing wrong with liking or not liking a game. I personally loved Infinite and its my favorite entry in the series.

Bioshock,3d397l,johhny_topside,2,Wed Jul 15 07:10:57 2015 UTC,"Infinite does not continue the story. Does it develop the theme? That's more debatable, depending on what you consider the theme of Bioshock 1 to be. At most, it barely qualifies."

Bioshock,3d397l,whiteface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:03:44 2015 UTC,I'm just upset because the Multiverse Theory seemed like we'd be getting a whole bunch of other DLCs where Elizabeth and Booker are living alternate lives.

Bioshock,3d397l,snyderman567,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:22:48 2015 UTC,"One of my two biggest issues was the save system (no manual save and autosaves that were way too spread out. I often lost 5-10 minutes of progress just because I had to leave for work and hadn't saved recently).  My other problem was the weapons. Only allowing us to equip two weapons at a time was OK, but the problem was there were so many different guns in the game and the ammo was spread out really unevenly that it just didn't work. I often found myself running out of ammo because the area I entered provided different ammo than I needed for the guns I brought. I honestly think they should have just combined or cut a lot of the guns (too many similar weapons like pistols and submachine guns that could have been alt-fire modes or upgrades). It didn't help that the melee attack was really weak and the ""finishing move"" wasn't really worth it since they had to be at low health anyways. I also didn't like that turrets couldn't be permanently controlled like the could be in the original Bioshock, which led to awkwardly wasting ammo on a friendly turret to kill it before it reverted."
Bioshock,3d397l,stealthfully,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"Well since this is being brought up again, I will simply give my opinion on this : I think Infinite is both a good game, and a good bioshock game. There are a few differences, but not big enough to take away other staple elements of the franchise."
Bioshock,3d397l,AlphaBigmomma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:39:06 2015 UTC,"so I'm going to be honest here, the combat and everything that wasn't the very beginning or very end of the game were so boooooring... but the ending made it so worth it imo. with how it tied everything together and proceeded to viciously mind rape you as you tried to wrap your head around all the loose ends that were now intertwined."

It does a good job showing how it breaks down a lot, and doesn't do well enough with pushing forward the new things it adds to the series."
Bioshock,3d397l,bartfart1,6,Mon Jul 13 16:44:58 2015 UTC,"Its not an accurate  nor good critique of the game. Also we get it already, you don't think Infinite is a bioshock game."
Bioshock,3d397l,mightystu,4,Mon Jul 13 17:10:44 2015 UTC,I don't know why many people direct to his critique when he gets a few things about the game wrong ( particularly how the ending worked).
Bioshock,3d397l,mightystu,0,Mon Jul 13 17:12:27 2015 UTC,How did he get the ending wrong?
Bioshock,3d397l,Bookahdashit,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:52:50 2015 UTC,"He really didn't, he even lays it out quite well.  Folks just don't like that it highlights how little it actually works."
Bioshock,3d397l,mightystu,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"He definitely and clearly understood how the ending worked (though it mostly doesn't work, which is the problem), it's just what everyone who wants to think it is especially deep point to.  Unfortunately, it doesn't stand up to any scholarly or rigorous analysis, but most people are just applying their amateur arguments.  While fun and interesting, these are often clouded by fanboyism, which I was a part of for awhile.  I wanted to find a way for it to be as brilliant as I first thought, but it really just doesn't hold up.  I really wanted it to, but it just does not."

Bioshock,3d2a6w,sailboatsare,7,Sun Jul 12 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"It'd be a Bathysphere ride, duh:  The entry is pure Rapture recreation goodness. The front (where the line is) is a recreation of the lighthouse. Rider's hop in one (8 seats maybe? Probably bigger than actual Bathyspheres to serve more passengers). It begins very slowly, as you descend down a very deep (trickery of course) tunnel into the same introduction as the first game. It has to make you awe-inspired, full of wonder. Make it so it feels like you're actually travelling through Rapture. Through the front window and some Disney magic, it's totally feasible to believe you're travelling throughout the city.   It's an exaggerated version of the Rapture Civil War, which gives the story a kick of action while also providing a reason for the riders to never actually dock. So, they'll wiz past a bomb blowing up, shootouts, whales, Big Daddy's working, plasmids, etc. Maybe even crash through some stuff.   In the end, you resurface safely, having escaped the Civil War, and you exit into the gift shop (fit to look like the wharf or something) where you can buy plush Plasmid Slugs or whatever."
Bioshock,3d2a6w,richieg7777,3,Mon Jul 13 04:05:45 2015 UTC,"I would like to add that it should be one of those rides like the Buzz Lightyear ride or the Midway Mania at Disneyland where you can shoot out at enemies. But obviously, it would be a bit more violent for Bioshock.  I suppose a ""gun"" would work best, but adding in a glove with some holographic lightning, fire, or bees would be amazing. It would probably have to be stationary and in a glass box to aide the technical flim-flammery but that would be amaaaaazing."
Bioshock,3d2a6w,Hereibe,2,Mon Jul 13 05:20:21 2015 UTC,"And for an Infinite Ride, maybe an overhang coaster to represent a skyhook, Set indoors, but with special lighting tricks to make it seem outdoors, while you swish through a summerized version of booker's journey.   In the beginning, you approach a lighthouse in a (fake) storm in your coaster, and you get shock up inside, like the tower of terror, and you make your way to elizabeths tower, while a songbird robot ""attacks"" you, and after that, you plunge down, with the songbird chasing you into battleship bay, and make your way to the hall of heroes, then find shock jockey and then the blimp with the Vox Populi and elizabeth runs away, you ""fight"" with a handyman...

Bioshock,3d3dc3,davis98,4,Mon Jul 13 17:11:08 2015 UTC,Hell yes. Like /r/HalfLife :http://i.imgur.com/qVTjvYG.png  The reason is because Half Life and BioShock are two franchises that are very linear so the chances are most people have replayed the games so much and there is very little differences between people's play-throughs. I think the only time it's necessary to post gameplay is if some type of funny glitch happens or something new that most players may not have seen before. Straight play throughs of the game that many people have already replayed hundreds of times is just not interesting to watch for people.

Bioshock,3d0775,acidityregulator,2,Sun Jul 12 11:22:40 2015 UTC,Yay! Those are my dogs. I just got the actual sketch today.
Bioshock,3d2073,Tischlampe,11,Sun Jul 12 21:50:18 2015 UTC,It is canon.
Bioshock,3d2073,tonywartooth,7,Sun Jul 12 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"BaS is considered to be non-canon by a large group of people for two reasons   Its existence does not line up with the end of Infinite which negates the possibility of this dlc and much of the main campaign of Infinite.   The happenings and revelations in BaS are not referenced in the first Bioshock ( Elizabeth's involvement with Cohen or Atlas, Booker as a private detective in Rapture, Sally, Suchongs discovery of tears and collaboration with Fink, the air grabber).   This is why some people either believe or personally consider BaS non canon or in an alternate universe."
Bioshock,3d2073,snyderman567,5,Mon Jul 13 01:32:56 2015 UTC,"The thing that gets me is why would Booker be in Rapture in the first place? He was a disgraced soldier, hardly the type of man that would  receive an invitation. We know he's been there for a while since he's got a business and everything.  I think Suchong would be the type of guy to hide his involvement with Fink and if you wanna stretch it a bit it could be entirely possible that Jack simply never found those recordings. Elizabeth pretty much just a girl doing a job to Atlas and why give her credit when he can take it anyways? So you can kinda let those inconsistencies slip.  Also, In BaS Suchong dies two weeks after the Civil War, but we know from Bioshock 2 that Subject Delta, the first of the Alpha Series was already fully functional the day the Civil War started. The problem is that Suchong never made a ""true"" Big Daddy, the one that developed them (and Subject Delta) was Gill Alexander after he took over Suchong's position. That was probably months after the Civil War too, considering he had to catch-up to Suchong's research and then finish it."

I'd expect only that Booker to die and all the others to remain untouched..."
Bioshock,3d2073,Cyntheon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:28:54 2015 UTC,"After all, why would killing that specific Booker suddenly make all universes go ""back in time"" and thus kill all Bookers when they're taking their baptism?   The baptism is a choice-based incident that creates an infinite number of alternate universes as a result of that choice. In this case, many universes with Comstock in them. Therefore it is impossible to hunt down and kill every Booker or every Comstock in every multiverse scenario. The only way to eliminate ALL of them is to go to the origin of this set of  branching realities, which is the baptism. By killing Booker at the baptism (Elizabeth merged our Booker's subconcious with the pre-Comstock Booker) which is the root for an infinite number of Comstock worlds, none of those worlds exist because the fatal choice was never made.  The drowning of Booker at the baptism is not a choice, so it does not create alternate universes where the Elizabeths don't drown Booker. There is only the single outcome."
Bioshock,3d2073,snyderman567,2,Mon Jul 13 14:11:34 2015 UTC,"The Big Daddy stuff was always a bit messy in terms of timeframe, though. If Suchong was dead and Alexander had time to perfect the bond between Subject Delta and Eleanor by the end of 1958, does that really mean Suchong's corpse was left drilled to a cabinet for the better part of three years? (Admittedly this could be said about a lot of the convenient corpses and audio diaries in the game.) I think it's pretty clear from the original game and the Rapture novel they thought Suchong probably died during the Civil War."

To me, I just consider it one multiverse that was not the same as the Rapture players fought through to explain away the inconsistencies (and to deal with the fact that it treats Jack saving the Little Sisters as a fait accompli.)"

In the fallout series they have to place Bill the tax collector somewhere in the world in order to get the ending narration to play.

Bioshock,3d0205,Halo_likes_me,2,Sun Jul 12 11:59:16 2015 UTC,I love the twins. The whole idea of having the same person from different universes with different genders is just great.
Bioshock,3d0205,Tischlampe,2,Sun Jul 12 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"/u/Halo_likes_me is right. To elaborate: the Lutece twins have, prior to the start of the game, been stealing Bookers from different realities, and setting them on the path they've set you (the player) on. They keep an eye on you at several points, and to amuse themselves they play with choice and causality along the way; most explicitly when you play the coin guessing game with them. You are just the latest in the series of Bookers they've sent on this mission, and all the ones before you failed. Elizabeth notes at some point that Songbird killed them all. The twins are very apathetic and cynical about the whole process because they have infinite universes from which to pull more Bookers. That is to say, given an infinite number of chances, they will eventually succeed, and are thus unworried about each individual attempt.  They lampshade this many times, but the big one is when you kill Comstock, Booker's nose begins to bleed as he suffers a bout of the dimension-sickness, whatever that entails, where his vision blurs."

Comstock is an alternate version of Booker who in his reality accepted the baptism and became Comstock. The Booker we played as was a Booker who declined the baptism.  As for the killing of Comstock, Elizabeth merged our Booker's subconscious with the pre-Comstock Booker at the baptismal site, and drowned him before the fatal choice could be made. Because the choice was never made, this prevented alternate Comstock timelines. It is important to keep in mind that choices in the world of Infinite create branching timelines. Also the drowning of Dewitt was not a choice, so there was never a reality created where Elizabeth didn't  drown Booker."

Check the script http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/605053-bioshock-infinite/faqs/69191   Elizabeth: Go away. It wasn't my fault. I didn't do anything!  [She imagines Sally trapped in the heated vent from Episode 1.]  Sally: Hot! Hot! Hot!  Elizabeth: No...no, no...no! It wasn't my fault! Leave me alone! Can't you just            leave me alone? I'm sorry! I'm sorry...I never should have left...I            never should have left you there...   She went to Rapture because of Bookerstock accidentally beheading a version of her during Bookerstock's and other ordinary Booker's fight over Anna on the portal.  2. Maybe.  She might have accepted her fate that in order to be with Booker again she has to die as an Elizabeth raised by Comstock. Her death will destroy all of the realities that Comstock exist.  There are some who says she will be revived via Vita-Chamber to make Jack save all of the little sisters including Sally that will encounter.  But Nobody really has a definite correct answer. Devs aint talking yet.  3. Check #2 possibility answer 1.  Another answer is as her punishment to herself of leaving Sally in those vents. In order for Sally to be freed, she has to sacrifice her life. She got Sally free but in exchange for her life.  4. Nobody has a definite answer.  Some say they're all dead since she's the last one since she wasn't there at the last baptism.  Some say she's cut off from the rest of the Elizabeths. The Elizabeths that are left might be those who weren't at the last baptism.  One thing for sure, the Elizabeth that assisted Booker in the main game and then went to rapture is dead.  5. It's the connection Infinite to 1.  According to majority, Infinite especially its DLC Burial At Sea closed the possibility of another Bioshock series. Making another one is milking the franchise. It's really very hard to create games with stories as deep like bioshock.

Elizabeth was pissed about what happened to that version of anna ( she got her head decapitated). She blames that version of Comstock who fled to Rapture to forget what he had done. Elizabeth who already despises Comstock since the events of Infinite, plans her revenge. Elizabeth did not kidnap Sally, though using her as bait when Bookerstock and her find Sally ( burning her while she was in the vent), was out of character imo.   If Elizabeth was going to die in Rapture couldn't she or of the others have seen it behind a door and prevented it?    She probably could. Some have theorized that she had a death wish ever since killing Booker at the baptism. The same could be said as to why she allowed Atlas to kill her, but that scene is a little problematic regardless.   Are all the Elizabeths dead or just the one that entered that reality?   All Elizabeths are gone.   What does this DLC as a whole mean for the series??

If Elizabeth was going to die in Rapture couldn't she or of the others have seen it behind a door and prevented it?   Elizabeth HATES Comstock. Never forget that. While I don't believe she had a hand in Sally's kidnapping, she did use it to her own benefit, making her just as guilty in her eyes. Its also probable that Elizbeth did see her death, but didn't care anyway, blinded by her hate for Comstock. She does go to extreme lengths to make sure he pays, very personally.   In the end why does Elizabeth simply accept her fate and let Atlas kill her? Are all the Elizabeths dead or just the one that entered that reality?   Probably because she feels like she deserves it, and she knows (feels I guess, without her powers,) it will set off the events of Rapture. At the end, the total death count is 2 Elizabeths. Impossible to know if there are more, since, well, paradox's and all that.   What does this DLC as a whole mean for the series??   Really your take man. For me it was a way to connect Rapture and Columbia, and all of the extreme similarities, while also telling an personal story from Comstocks' and Elizabeths' point of views. Also, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And maybe a quest for repentance in there too, just like Bookers' ending as well."

Bioshock,3cr61z,Hereibe,14,Fri Jul 10 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"It was more intentional than a witch's tit is cold, boyo."
Bioshock,3cr61z,Hereibe,3,Fri Jul 10 08:27:52 2015 UTC,"I'll treasure it forever. To answer your question, I love Bioshock 2 and really recommend it. Some of the world building details get a bit lost in BaS or they directly contradict themselves, but I love the lore of Bioshock 2!  Also, if you enjoy being lead around by a man with an accent, Augustus Sinclair 10/10 would pick up a wretch for him. I'm assuming you find accents amusing because of your title haha. Have fun!"
Bioshock,3cr61z,Shadowgown,7,Fri Jul 10 21:01:32 2015 UTC,"It's not necessary, but 2 deepens the lore from the first game. Personally, I would advise you to play it before BaS."

Bioshock,3cr61z,Tischlampe,3,Fri Jul 10 03:07:42 2015 UTC,"Go ahead! 2's story is not as good as the first one, but the gameplay feels a lot better. The biggest flaw imo are the escort missions, but overall the game's really good!"
Bioshock,3cr61z,davis98,0,Fri Jul 10 12:53:53 2015 UTC,Also you should read the book. You can read it once you played through all the games. It provides some useful information about the major characters but reading it before playing the games might spoil you.
Bioshock,3cr61z,snyderman567,4,Sat Jul 11 10:23:34 2015 UTC,"The story of Bioshock 2 doesn't directly affect BAS, but there are a tons of references you'll miss out on."

If you want to play it, play it before BaS  BaS was made to be an epic conclusion to the series, and if you play Bioshock 2 afterwards, you may be let down by some small lore contradictions, old gameplay mechanics (they're still fun though), or an anti-climatic ending (compared to BaS's ending at least), and it may leave a sour taste in your mouth"

Bioshock,3cuiua,snyderman567,2,Fri Jul 10 22:54:28 2015 UTC,"Because there is no evidence whatsoever or hints within the story of those two games to back up your theory. There are similarities between Elizabeth and Eleanor, but they are not the same character."
Bioshock,3cuiua,DeltaDeWitt,-3,Sat Jul 11 02:07:48 2015 UTC,"Not the same character, but parallels of each other? Perhaps, perhaps not. It's up to the individual fan's head canon.

Bioshock,3cuiua,Sithsaber,-1,Sat Jul 11 11:50:23 2015 UTC,"They are the same character type, which would make them archetypal peers. Honestly I thought this is what the metanarrative was going for before Levine nuked the franchise."
Bioshock,3cuiua,Halo_likes_me,-3,Sun Jul 12 06:59:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're crazy. The games aren't related at all. Ken had nothing to do with BioShock 2 he was just making his own game. Just because there are slight similarities doesn't mean anything. Also as you said, you didnt even play Infinite, so stop guessing."
Bioshock,3cuiua,MoneycatLOL,3,Fri Jul 10 23:03:45 2015 UTC,Because two different writers could NEVER created material that was related to each other. That's definitely never happened ever.  Additionally...to say that any two Bioshock games are not related in any way is the most absolutely absurd statement I've heard all day.
Bioshock,3cuiua,Halo_likes_me,-1,Fri Jul 10 23:12:36 2015 UTC,"Then you must be in denial. BioShock Infinite has little to NO connection with BioShock 1 or 2. It's a completely new and separate story. There are only brief references and mentions to BioShock 1. Also people have already posted threads like this multiple times ""blah blah blah is Eleanor a different version of Elizabeth?""  Oh wait you didn't play Infinite yet, so why are you even making assumptions.  SPOILERS LOL  Here is the thread bro. A lot of people can agree they are not in any way shape or form related to each other.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/2x1x6y/trying_to_settle_an_argument_are_eleanor_and/"
Bioshock,3cuiua,MoneycatLOL,4,Fri Jul 10 23:15:06 2015 UTC,"Have you not played Burial at Sea? Or seen the ending of Infinite?  Either way, my point was more so that they are all part of the same franchise, and share the same name, and have similar gameplay and motifs throughout the entirety of the series.  By definition, they are all related."
Bioshock,3cuiua,Halo_likes_me,-3,Fri Jul 10 23:19:11 2015 UTC,"wow, guess what. How can Elizabeth AND Eleanor be in rapture at the same time? must mean they aren't the same person. Just face it bro, they aren't connected. Just because you want your theory to be right doesn't mean anything. There is no connection. Two seperate people in two separate universes"
Bioshock,3cuiua,Hereibe,3,Fri Jul 10 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair to the OP, the Bioshock universe has time travel and Tears. Anything is theoretically possible. It would be quite easy to have a copy of yourself in the same area- just look at the Lutece's."
Bioshock,3cuiua,Halo_likes_me,-1,Fri Jul 10 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"no. If that were the case, Eleanor would be the same age as Liz during BAS"
Bioshock,3cuiua,Hereibe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:14:01 2015 UTC,"Just like how Booker was the same age as Comstock?  Time is more flexible and wibbly wobbly, and biological aging even moreso in the Bioshock universe. It's interesting to consider, though OP hasn't sold me on it. But OP is also asking to prove a negative- you can't prove it's not possible in Bioshock lore because anything can happen there. You must admit they look remarkably similar."

Bioshock,3cuiua,7idy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"I know it won't be a popular theory and many things don't line up, but I have been thinking about the similarities between Elizabeth and Eleanor..  Both are chosen to be very special, saviours of their cities  Both possess impressive powers and can be very dangerous  Both have rocky relationships with their mother figures  Both are caged for the majority of their lifetimes  Both have fathers who turn out to be the protagonist  Both are worshiped in a religious/cult like manner  Both are rescued from their prisons by the protagonist  Both accompany the player upon being released  Both are 'lead astray' according to their captors  Both are known as 'The Lamb', as stated previously.   That's 10 things that are exactly the same about Elizabeth and Eleanor. It was only playing through Bioshock 2 again recently that I realised just how similar they are!"
Bioshock,3cqn9f,Jaraghan,2,Fri Jul 10 00:12:15 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people, myself included, had that question when they finished BaS 2. The one theory that seems to make the most sense regarding that question is this : Since that tear is the one when you see the Booker you played and the Elizabeth you played with, it is safe to assume that it belongs to Elizabeth's past. Since her past can't be erased, the only way for that tear to close definitely is for Elizabeth to die, which, sadly, happens at the end of BaS 2. For that reason, Suchong had until Elizabeth's death in 1959 to access the only remaining tear with Columbia in it."

Bioshock,3cqn9f,PraesumoDiscrepo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:11:08 2015 UTC,"No problem. I didn't think I could manage that - the story became a lot more complex with Infinite and the DLCs, and I spent so much time looking for answers, so I couldn't just leave you in the dark like that."

Bioshock,3cn5ej,Jaraghan,3,Thu Jul 9 05:04:05 2015 UTC,"This is what I got out of BaS 1. I did a lot of research, but at the end, some things remain subjective, so feel free to correct me.   This Comstock didn't get erased because he escaped to Rapture (another timeline). Therefore, the baptism only destroyed his old timeline (Columbia). u/Sillyjones pretty much answered it. To add to that, they were ""scattered across time and space, able to appear wherever and whenever they wanted"" from Rosalind Lutece's Wikia Page. That is because Comstock, before Booker arrived in Columbia, ordered Fink to sabotage the Luteces' tear device, but he failed. (and 4) I think these questions can be answered together. The only Elizabeth that remained after BioShock Infinite is your Elizabeth, the omniscient being that can see all the doors and what's behind all the doors. She brought you to the baptism, but stayed in the Sea of Doors so she could survive the drowning. That, while being only a theory, supports the fact that she didn't have a necklace when she drowned you. She effectively survived and got to keep her powers. So, the Elizabeth you see in BaS 1 is the one you saw in Infinite. We answered it! This one is tricky. She tried to prevent Comstock from pulling Anna, but she failed, and Anna was decapitated because of that. A possible answer to your question is that she was so in shock from seeing herself die like that that she simply retreated. Then, when  she saw that Comstock remained alive, she devised a plan that was meant to kill him, but ultimately to make him remember what he did to her/Anna.   Hope I helped!"

Bioshock,3cev9r,spork7426,26,Tue Jul 7 11:44:03 2015 UTC,"My issue was before that, when Elizabeth realized they were going to New York instead of Paris. All Booker had to say was, ""Yeah, I need to get some stuff from home before we go.""  BOOM! A completely plausible and effective explanation to keep her from losing her mind."
Bioshock,3cev9r,Raichu93,5,Tue Jul 7 12:36:50 2015 UTC,Plus before that even happens he does explain to her that people paid him to get her and wipe away his debt and she doesn't seem to really care. So why all of a sudden does she?
Bioshock,3cev9r,westernspaceviking,7,Tue Jul 7 13:41:25 2015 UTC,"She didn't know she had a choice, she just wanted to get away from prison. Then when Booker told her he would bring her to Paris, she realized she had that choice. But of course he lied to her. If he had never told her Paris was an option, she wouldn't have been mad about New York."
Bioshock,3cev9r,Tischlampe,3,Tue Jul 7 16:31:48 2015 UTC,You. You're what we need to make a happy ending DLC for Infinite
Bioshock,3cev9r,westernspaceviking,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:57:42 2015 UTC,cough there is a happy ending SA fan made game on the Internet.
Bioshock,3cev9r,Tischlampe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:29:27 2015 UTC,What? Where? I've never heard of it. What's it called?
Bioshock,3cev9r,westernspaceviking,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:33:12 2015 UTC,Biocock. Just Google Biocock.
Bioshock,3cev9r,Brizkit,2,Sun Jul 12 20:08:15 2015 UTC,Oh... Well. I think I'll stick with the normal ending then.
Bioshock,3cev9r,crypticthree,18,Sun Jul 12 22:08:47 2015 UTC,Well didn't he arrive at the gun makers shop and the guns were not there but there was a tear that showed the guns on the other side? So in a desperate attempt to get the guns they take a leap of faith through the tear (I think this was the first time they used a tear in this way) and accidentally end up in the alternate dimension where the vox have successfully gotten the guns already and Booker is somehow dead and a hero to the cause. There's also no way to go back through the tear once they are there so they just have to roll with it. It's kinda strange but if you consider the pace of the story and the characters' ignorance as to what would happen when crossing dimensions it makes a little more sense.
Bioshock,3cev9r,NaturalPanic,8,Tue Jul 7 12:53:08 2015 UTC,I never got the impression that Booker was very smart. The the Luteces are the real planers.
Bioshock,3cev9r,crypticthree,2,Tue Jul 7 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"well the luteces kinda brought up the whole idea in the first place. they were like: ""hey just use this magical doorway and the gunsmith will be alive"". but they didn't mention anything about the tools not being there or the fact that booker might not have made the same deal with daisy in that universe, which im sure they could've known."
Bioshock,3cev9r,PenXSword,2,Wed Jul 8 09:06:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think they needed to know, they're just running through every iteration til something sticks. That's the benefit of being a multidimensional consciousnesses."
Bioshock,3cev9r,VerbingNoun3,8,Wed Jul 8 14:38:57 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to be missing the central conceit behind the tears, so I'll try to explain what I think Booker and Elizabeth took for granted. Booker is easy enough to explain. He's relatively  new to the whole jumping through worlds thing, and his memories are all scrambled from his first jaunt, thanks to the Luteces, and from all the alternate Bookers whose memories he's trying to sort through. For example, burning down The Hall of Heroes with Slate when he had defeated him there in gameplay instead.   Now as for Elizabeth, she's more used to the tears, having been able to open them when she was a kid. And even now, whenever she's nervous they just have a way of appearing to help her. Enough so that she considers them ""A form of wish fulfillment."" Elizabeth is operating under the illusion of control. That she controls the tears, that they work FOR her. An illusion that starts to crumble as they go through the trouble of getting to Chen Lin, and his eventual death.   So Booker, having no idea how this all works, just goes along with it, whereas Elizabeth is simply taking for granted how tears actually work because she believes they are operating under her control. Hence her attitude about ""...redeeming the things that we've done."" She still believes that she's creating these worlds, to a point. Hence why she expected the deal to still be there, to be a constant amid everything else she's changed. Because when she needs ammo, money, salts, she finds it in a tear. But it's not that simple when she opens a tear into a whole world."
Bioshock,3cev9r,Andykbrown,3,Wed Jul 8 03:24:20 2015 UTC,I think about that every play through. But I  always shrug it off because its fun.
Bioshock,3cev9r,shoeless_sean,2,Tue Jul 7 11:26:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, his plan was crap, but that doesn't matter because there are tons of bookers to take from other realities and replace the current booker if he does. Booker is the guy who gets it all done but the luteces are the real people pulling the strings, and they will use both Elizabeth and booker to accomplish their mission on restoration. The DLC's are more about Elizabeth making her own choices, but as far as booker is concerned, he is a total tool for them to use. Even at the end of infinite Elizabeth says that booker is always stopped by song bird, this just goes to show how shitty his plan is, he always fails."
Bioshock,3cev9r,NaturalPanic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:21:13 2015 UTC,My question is how the hell did they think they were going to lift manufacturing equipment back to the shop!? And don't say tears because at the time Elizabeth could only open tears that already existed not create new ones.
Bioshock,3cev9r,Jerod22,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:56:34 2015 UTC,well booker did probably kill ALOT of his brain cells with alcohol. not to forget the fact he has probably fallen on his head during the story quite a few times aswell.
Bioshock,3cev9r,Xz0mb13killaX,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:08:40 2015 UTC,Fuck I need to play this game again.
Bioshock,3cev9r,AdviceFromSatan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:33:28 2015 UTC,im surprised liz didn't realize this either since she knows a bit more about multiverses
Bioshock,3cev9r,pamelakd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:57:00 2015 UTC,"Booker is an idiot. The story most certainly has emotionally merit but is not logical.  Why not use all those barges you keep hijacking and just leave Columbia, why do you need an airship."
Bioshock,3cev9r,verdatum,-9,Fri Jul 10 09:48:45 2015 UTC,I think most of the plot of Infinite makes very little sense if you apply some logical thinking to it. It's why I found the game such a disappointment.
Bioshock,3cev9r,Raichu93,4,Tue Jul 7 12:19:41 2015 UTC,"I agree that lots of parts of it fall apart when you think about them.  But hey, time-travel & parallel world plots are hard. The trick is to not overthink it, and just enjoy the drama as it unfolds."
Bioshock,3cgurd,ikolit,2,Tue Jul 7 20:24:49 2015 UTC,"Most likely brought up by, yaknow, Comstock. That tower wasn't there before they brought her in. She most likely lived a normal life for some time. I don't know how to word this. Booker knew he had to pay debts. After he gave Anna away, his debts were paid, hence what Robert says. You also have to take into account that a lot of his memory is wack as fuck and a lot of what you see at the end of the game is what actually happened. What you just described is most likely how Lutece conversed with Booker over the deal."
Bioshock,3cgurd,47L45,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:29:52 2015 UTC,"I believe somewhere it said that Elizabeth was, I believe 12 or maybe a bit younger when she was brought into the tower. The only reason she was put into the tower is that it was a siphon for her inter-dimensional powers, and she only started to show her powers when she began to go through puberty. I'm positive she spent a period of her early life outside of the tower, because I remember when Lady Comstock believed that Comstock cheated on her with Rosalind to create the baby, she said she ""wanted that bastard child out of her house"". As for Rosalind, Elizabeth never saw a single soul other than songbird in the tower. That was what the one-way glass was for when you first go through the tower. Rosalind, probably Robert, and a small select unnamed crew were tasked with studying and attempting to destroy her powers, but never revealing themselves to her. Elizabeth didn't even know people were studying her. It's possible, but unlikely, that Rosalind and Elizabeth met before she was put in the tower, but even if they did, it would have been easy for Elizabeth to forget about her after spending years alone in the tower.  As for Comstock and Booker's relationship, Booker knew Comstock wanted to buy his baby, and that Robert was just the messenger. Booker had no idea who Comstock was, (and he definitely didn't know he was a parallel dimensional version of himself), he just knew he was a high ranking man of religion. Booker needed money, but what he needed more than that was forgiveness for what he did at Wounded Knee and during the Boxer Rebellion. That's why Robert said that. And when Robert and Rosalind pulled Booker into Comstock's dimension at the start of the game, Booker lost all memories of all of that. His mind became a clean slate version of itself, only remembering what made sense for that universe. He made up the idea of another debt that he had to pay, and he thought that the reason he had to get this girl, is because people (that once again, he made up) were going to pay him to bring her to them. Selling his daughter and seeing her being pulled through another dimension by someone else simply didn't make sense to the story he made up, so he 'forgot' about it for the majority of the game."
Bioshock,3cg9je,SMS450,4,Tue Jul 7 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"The Vox rebellion, in my opinion. It's a major change of scenery- before, the city is pristine and you're the troublemaker, but after, everything's gone to hell and the city is literally falling apart. It's been way too log since I played for me to say whether or not that occurs at the half point time-wise, but I felt these sections of the game were very visually distinctive."
Bioshock,3cg9je,JPS_TEAM_B_6905,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty close to the point where you enter Finkton. That's pretty close to the total game's half way point, and it's about where the emotional halfway point comes in to in my opinion."
Bioshock,3cg9je,runaholic13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:09:20 2015 UTC,I think it would be around the part where Daisy dies. I always considered Elizabeth's make over to be something a symbol for that..
Bioshock,3cg9je,ikolit,3,Tue Jul 7 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"See, I thought that at first, but I feel like there's a lot before Daisy, and not as much after. But it's hard to decide."
Bioshock,3cg9je,whybotherman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"After Daisy dies and Elizabeth cuts her hair, which shows a major mentality change to her, she forgets almost entirely about Paris, and has a more experienced look to her. Even the sky becomes cloudy and stormy afterwards, conforming to the general mood of impending  doom."

Bioshock,3c9um3,remek4x4,2,Mon Jul 6 05:55:12 2015 UTC,I love these videos. I used to watch them all the time leading up to the release of Infinite.
Bioshock,3c9um3,espen7,2,Mon Jul 6 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely great. The ""Rapture: A Modern Day Atlantis"" video solidified my desire for setting a sequel in the late 70s/early 80s. Would be great to have more of that classic video look."

Bioshock,3c7ntb,Hereibe,67,Sun Jul 5 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"Rule 34 has, of course, made it's way into Rapture :)"
Bioshock,3c7ntb,rodrikes,18,Sun Jul 5 18:00:26 2015 UTC,And Dr. Sofia Lamb is a confirmed shipper.
Bioshock,3c7ntb,GreatPhail,9,Sun Jul 5 18:42:00 2015 UTC,What exactly is the dude saying?
Bioshock,3c7ntb,Evans0305,24,Sun Jul 5 20:27:05 2015 UTC,"That he's being pressured by Ryan's thugs to produce proof that Lamb is running a cult, but he's going to need more time to produce evidence. Their threats are ramping up, so to steady himself he reminisces about Johny Topside (the guy who eventually became Subject Delta) and how brave he was to find Rapture through deep sea diving and not crony connections with Ryan.  Thinking about how brave Johny was gives Poole a sort of idol to look up to. He pretends to actually be Johny, like a little kid pretending to be Superman to be brave.  Then he says he's glad he can't tell Lamb about it, because he's sure Lamb will tell him he really wants to have lots of wild sex with Johny."
Bioshock,3c7ntb,G1nplus,3,Sun Jul 5 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"Then again, its Rapture, so Rule 34 (or the equivalent of it) would have already been as acceptable as Little Sisters."
Bioshock,3c7ntb,NaturalPanic,62,Mon Jul 6 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"On the Bioshock wikia it says that when the Big Daddies and the Little Sisters were introduced, it scared the living shit out of the inhabitants of Rapture, I think this poster may have been propaganda used to help make the citizens assimilate the creatures into their society"
Bioshock,3c7ntb,GammaGames,19,Sun Jul 5 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"yea i read it in the novel. no one actually wanted the big daddied and little sisters around. they were simply needed because the sisters didnt make enough adam themselves, so with the big daddies they could drain adam from corpses aswell without.. dying."
Bioshock,3c7ntb,NaturalPanic,21,Sun Jul 5 22:10:14 2015 UTC,"It really would have made more sense for there to be a squad of body removers to bring the corpses to the Little Sisters. They wouldn't be attacked because you couldn't harvest ADAM from them or the corpses without a Sister, and it would be much more palatable to have someone respectfully clean up the corpses and bear them away on a stretcher than to have a little girl stab a giant needle in them and cheerfully start drinking."
Bioshock,3c7ntb,hatsnatcher23,10,Mon Jul 6 00:27:28 2015 UTC,That would require some kind of order. This way they essentially had slaves that would go around and do it for free. The reward is far more than the risk
Bioshock,3c7ntb,Wyatt1313,7,Mon Jul 6 08:04:16 2015 UTC,"this. also it was nearly impossible for anyone to kill off a big daddy except for jack and delta. well that and splicers in big groups, but thats why the ""rumbler"" ( the one with mines, rockets and mini turrets) was made."

Bioshock,3c7ntb,hatsnatcher23,20,Sun Jul 5 18:41:53 2015 UTC,Equal opportunity porn. The same location has a gay couple and open prostitution.
Bioshock,3c7ntb,whybotherman,21,Sun Jul 5 22:19:51 2015 UTC,"That gay couple is adorable too. Just quietly hugging, they're very poignant part of Raptures story. How amazing would have been in the 50s to find such a place of acceptance? With just a few quiet characters the developers added so much depth to the history and reason of Rapture."
Bioshock,3c7ntb,barney-mosby,6,Sun Jul 5 23:31:59 2015 UTC,Can we talk about how much I want a poster of that in my room?
Bioshock,3c7ntb,whybotherman,3,Mon Jul 6 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"I have one- unfortunately they don't show up on the store anymore, but they still have the other two posters (Gender-bender and Midwest girl)"
