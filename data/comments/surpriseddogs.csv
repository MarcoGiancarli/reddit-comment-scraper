surpriseddogs,3dtyxk,Carter52,16,Sun Jul 19 14:57:39 2015 UTC,Unfortunately yes. He's happy as can be and lives an extremely spoiled life for a dog. He's just a little.... Slow. Lol
surpriseddogs,3dtyxk,rawrzapan,8,Sun Jul 19 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"What does it do if you dont mind me asking? Like was he harder to train, does he just do goofy things?"
surpriseddogs,3dtyxk,PancakeZombie,3,Sun Jul 19 21:06:56 2015 UTC,I'm curious as well. How is his behaviour different from other dogs?
surpriseddogs,3dtyxk,Carter52,2,Mon Jul 20 10:51:46 2015 UTC,He's more skittish than most dobermans I've seen and he thinks he's a lot smaller than he is. Aside from all that he's clumsy and has issues keeping his balance. They've still managed to house train him and he knows his name but not much else.
surpriseddogs,3dtyxk,freemoney83,7,Mon Jul 20 13:42:22 2015 UTC,It's good to hear he's happy and healthy. That's all that matters in the end.
surpriseddogs,3dtyxk,KengPinky,4,Sun Jul 19 19:22:03 2015 UTC,Thankfully dogs don't know (or care) if others think they're different! I'm sure he's very happy!

surpriseddogs,34ozsn,BrainOnLoan,8,Sun May 3 07:16:28 2015 UTC,"Our dog got attacked by a cat while walking through the neighbourhood. But the cat didn't just swat him like in the gif, she got mad as hell. She jumped out of a bush and clinged to his head. We had to get rather physical with her to get her off our dog. We later found out, that this beast was known by other dog-owners for her behaviour. Our dog was a puppy back then and still has a cat-phobia. He won't even go near the tiniest kittens."

surpriseddogs,32el6e,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:10:59 2015 UTC,"Cavalier King Charles Spaniel:       The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small spaniel classed as a toy dog by The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club.  It is one of the most popular breeds in the United Kingdom, where it also originated. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 18th most popular pure-breed in the United States (2013 Registration Statistics).  It has a silky, smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail. The breed standard recognizes four colours: Blenheim (brown, red and white), Tricolor (black/white/tan), Black and Tan, and Ruby.  The breed is generally friendly, affectionate and good with both children and other animals; however, they require a lot of human interaction. The expected average lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is under ten years.
