gaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy,2tssbx,Free_Blowjobs,6,Wed Jan 28 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"Two things:  1) Your gaydar is unrefined. There are plenty of gay guys that run the entire spectrum of ""gay"" from the Chris Colfers to the Wentworth Millers. the Colfers just stand out more because they make you feel uncomfortable.  2) Even gay guys have to learn to get past the ""gay"" in gay guys and see them for who they are as people. I'm sure your first impression of me is ""gay"" but I'm also a geek and a programmer and I work in Video Games.. I like musicals and sci-fi (although most gays like Sci-Fi for whatever reason.)  Date a drag queen, you get over it really quick. ;)"
gaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy,2tssbx,majeric,5,Wed Jan 28 00:23:43 2015 UTC,"Like, no regular straight guy would list that as something he likes—even a geeky/nerdy one.   I know plenty of straight guys that like musicals. I picked it because it's a silly stereotype.   who is truly, unequivocally masculine, who gives me the same feeling of masculinity that a random straight guy would.   Ya know. No one's ever really nailed down what ""masculine"" is other than an empty list of stereotypes that does more damage than good.  The thing is no straight guy is ever going to sleep with you... and if they do, you'll lose interest in them.   I know you're going to baulk at this but it's internalized homophobia. I'm not taking hate... or fear or anything so extreme. I'm just talking a knee-jerk dislike because you value this socially-conditioned behavioural bag of confirmation bias. Lots of gay guys have it in the beginning. Lots of gay guys get over it... or they find some compromise. /r/gaybros is one such group that lives in denial...    Hopefully, you stop seeing ""gay"" and you see the person behind the ""gay""... or you're going to be one lonely sexless man. :)  I can honestly tell you the moment I got completely over it. It was about 30 minutes into a conversation with a guy who was a drag queen (He wasn't in drag at the time). My thought process was ""Wow, this guy's cute. Shit. He's kind of flamey."" 30 minutes later ""This is one of the best conversations I've had in years. I'd date him in a heart beat"".  You can get over it if you want to... Like I said... what's the alternative..."
gaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy,2tssbx,majeric,2,Wed Jan 28 00:35:49 2015 UTC,"You are making so many baseless assumptions about me and my views that I want to cry.   Sorry, I'm honestly not trying to make you cry and it's not at all about how I perceive you but how I find that 90% of the newbie gays react. You're just defending a stance that i take objection for some very specific reasons that obviously don't apply in your case.   I'm transitioning to a girl, so I do hope you're wrong about that. My last boyfriend was straight (until he met me, I suppose, since I was still presenting as a boy), and I never lost interest in him. Please don't tell me whom I'm going to lose interest in. That's just rude.   Clearly, this is a separate circumstance. Trans-woman's experience is going to be different than gay men's experiences.   the portion of bi guys who are traditionally masculine is comparable to that of straight guys   Bi guys have it difficult. They're probably fighting hard to be part of both communities where as gay guys have abandoned all things gender-stereotypical. Bi guys probably fight harder than straight guys to ""defend their masculinity"".   the gay community has a notable lack of masculine guys   We conform to fit our communities. I'm not saying that being gay isn't culturalized on some level. It is. Geeks abandon the ""superficial"" to avoid being percieved as unintelligent.   Although I find it more honest when gay guys relax and are more comfortable in their shoes.    I can be attracted to masculine guys without it meaning I have internalized homophobia.   Again, I'm back to the ""What the heck qualifies as masculine"" that isn't just a social construct. I mean what's masculine in south-east asia isn't remotely the same as North America, isn't remotely the same as British, French, Australian etc...  You're attracted to a culturalized stereotype. A arbitrary definition of gender.    So, please, for the love of all that is fabulous, stop literally preaching to the drag queen.   Alright alright..."

Honestly, I thought we were kind of at the gender neutral point as a society already for the most part, but maybe I just have a really good location/social group.   Anyways, I'd be more concerned about the fact that you're asking your BFs permission to cut your hair, then the ""Gender Neutral"" thing.

(but first, do yourself a favor and buy some American Crew pomade-- you're gonna need that shit.) being and presenting as androgyne is really, really hard. gender is so much in the eye of the beholder that most people will see you as a weird version of whatever they want to see you as, but that's not a reason not to do it. because of that, though, unless and until you are really, really good at presenting that way, you kind of find yourself asking others to see you the way you want to be seen-- and that will include your boyfriend. in the future, consider looking for bisexual partners and / or queer allies. being in a relationship where your partner expects everything to adhere to gender norms can feel INCREDIBLY constraining-- especially compounded with the exhaustion of finding yourself shut down by people who want to put you back in the box where they think you belong. relationships that are agendered in their dynamics are maybe the best thing there has ever been.   tl;dr: do you; date bisexuals; make your intimate relationships as genderless as possible for maximum androgyne comfort."

And I stand by anybodies right to decide how to look, or what to wear, and be validated in that.  It's cool that you're willing to do that for your GF, because you've chosen to. But if she said she would break up with you because you have a beard, then I am afraid that we have very different standards for relationships.  Especially when it comes to things like asserting your gender identity. Would you be so compromising if your GF wanted you to wear a dress? Or Naruto cosplay all the time?  The important thing here is    but as far as wanting me to look a certain way...she gets it, man (for the most part).   There's that line. OP is implying at least that her line is being able to have her hair short because she identifies as gender neutral, and doesn't want to be seen as feminine or masculine.

Then following up by thanking him for listening and understanding.   There's no reason this should be a big deal. You have to remember that if he cares for you he will accept your preferred pronouns. (and let you cut your hair, which isn't his decision anyways)  Just remember that if he starts acting in a way that doesn't make you feel safe. Tell him you don't feel safe and ask to take a break. If he says no then get the hell out of there."

They are just words, and by taking control of them you remove the negative power associated with them. But by avoiding them and trying to just have them go away, you will achieve nothing, because people will continue using them, just like people use any other word that someone says not to use. I just personally feel that its not that bad, and helps more to not be hyper sensitive to words, but again, just me."
