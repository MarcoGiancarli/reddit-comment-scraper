youngjustice,3dybtj,suss2it,4,Mon Jul 20 23:25:14 2015 UTC,Damn I feel like Greg Weisman's talents are wasted on a Nick Jr. children's show. I wish he was still on at least Star Wars Rebels.

youngjustice,3dlas6,Gusblack1,5,Fri Jul 17 04:49:37 2015 UTC,"going to be a little bit spoilery but you should be fine  ok so Season 1 starts with Aqualad, Kid flash, and Robin teaming up to investigate Cadmus. Speedy, who becomes Red arrow is also introduced but does not join them yet. They find superboy and free him introducing him to the justice league. The team becomes official and Miss martian joins. So now there are 5 members. Then later, Artemis joins so there are 6 for a while. After a few episodes where she fights with the team Zatanna eventually joins up making it 7. Towards the end Red arrow joins the team as well putting it at 8. Red arrow then leaves to do other stuff so 7 again. Then the last episode or two has Rocket join the team putting it at 8 when that season ends.   the next season is 5 years later (what!) Rocket and Zatanna basically graduated to the Justice league. Aqualad does other other stuff and is not on the team. Red arrow does other other stuff and is less present. Kid flash and Artemis retired in the time so they arent on the team either. Dick grayson who was robin in season 1 is now nightwing and he leads. Superboy and Miss Martian also stay. new recruits include beast boy, a new robin, batgirl, Bumblebee,  blue beetle, lagoon boy,and Wonder girl.   and that gets us to ten. they are all on the team at the start of  season 2 and therefore don't get much explaining. (perhaps the only bad thing about an otherwise fantastic show) other's join the team in this season though warning they are spoilers.  Impulse comes from the future to join Arsenal joins and Mal becomes the next guardian, also a few new and old faces come back at the last episode"
youngjustice,3dlas6,Csantana,5,Fri Jul 17 05:36:31 2015 UTC,"what the literal fuck, I have seen all of season 1 and most of season 2 but I never got the 5 years in the future part. God. Damnit.  Thanks for the reply, it really helps."

youngjustice,3cq09z,wievo,2,Fri Jul 10 04:43:22 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time, so I don't recall who's actually taken/available. The sub has been completely dead for a couple years now, so I don't know if any of the old players are still around and interested. The problem with that is that therefore I don't have an easy way, barring 'reading through every last post from the old sessions', to find out.  I know that the people who aren't members of the Team or the bad guys are generally reserved for moderator accounts (hence why Batman - aka our mod /u/shiniholum - and Red Arrow - aka me - are mods), I remember interacting with Blue Beetle and Beast Boy, and I know that Deathstroke as well as a couple villains that never made it onto the show (Harley Quinn and Zsasz, at least) were taken on the villains' side. Beyond that, it'd be a bit of a digging episode to find out the rest, but I'll have a look and see what I can find.  Mostly, other than 'the heroes who were on the show but weren't part of the Team', we had an open policy (as in if it's a DC character who you can conceivably fit into the universe, but mostly teen heroes and any villains, you could 'apply' via PM to the mods - at the moment, unless the other mods return and are still interested, that consists of me, myself, and I - with a character name, main Reddit name, and small writing sample, and there's a good chance that if no one else wants that character, you'd be approved).  Just did a preliminary check, and so far, aside from the ones I mentioned, I've noticed Kid Flash and Tempest both being spoken-for (unless their original players have totally lost interest and are able to remember and willing to donate their account login info for their RP accounts). EDIT: Also what with the fate of Kid Flash in the show... unless the original player/someone who takes over can figure out a believable way to bring him back. Also, if you're not a comics fan, I believe Tempest was the Garth version of Aqualad, the one that was in the Teen Titans animated series and the comics.  EDIT 2: Apparently also Inertia (Impulse's 'Reverse Flash') is claimed if his player wants to come back or can't remember his login for that account, as well as someone I'm not familiar with called 'Fright'.  EDIT 3: Fixed the part where I called my mod account the wrong hero. Not sure why I remembered it as Nightwing, especially after logging in on that account just a few hours ago."

Once we know, and perhaps if it is happening, once we've worked out a bit of a better system for applications/keeping storylines straight, I or another RP-mod will get back to you on that."

youngjustice,3cgoym,Csantana,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"So I just started watching the show last night, I'm about half way through the first season.  Getting a little tired of the ""villain of the week but mysterious master-group is responsible"" formula.  Still a lot of fun and it makes me yearn for a return to the justice league on TV.  IIRC this was the first episode where they really come out with the KF/Artemis thing, right?  Before it was just the little hints with their personality clashes.  I also liked the addition of Sphere to the group, although as far as I've seen he's never been used.  My biggest take away from this episode is a possible Apokolips connection to ""the light""  Edit: Not Apokolips, just the Power Rangers  Second Edit: Black Ranger just mentioned apokolips"

youngjustice,3b89u8,WW4O,-11,Fri Jun 26 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"Also, YJ does not compete with Daredevil at all   Thats because JY is far superior it isnt fair to DD to compare them."
youngjustice,3b89u8,danielr1341,16,Fri Jun 26 20:59:53 2015 UTC,Or Daredevil is a live action show aimed at an older audience.   It's a safer statement to say that Arrow and the Flash compete with Daredevil
youngjustice,3b89u8,billychuck,9,Fri Jun 26 22:50:26 2015 UTC,"As much as it pains me to admit, Young Justice is done. The DC animation division of WB isn't going to go back and spend time and effort on reviving the series, seeing as all they really care about are toy sales which Netflix doesn't garner. Even if they did, the team that made it so great are all off doing new and different things and wouldn't likely leave those for YJ. It's sad, but just try to find solace that we got two fantastic seasons."
youngjustice,3b89u8,CookiePoster,4,Fri Jun 26 20:10:13 2015 UTC,That toy sale rumor I just don't see. I don't even see toys advertised for Teen Titan go.
youngjustice,3b89u8,sockmess,4,Fri Jun 26 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"For the toys; it wasn't WB animation team, it was Cartoon Network. WB had the show on point, we all know how amazing it was, it had a high viewer count each week and a ton of fans, but that's not what Cartoon Network is wanting. The show was pulling in an average viewer age of 12-25(a lot even older), even a ton of girl viewers(that tumblr squad), but the younger children weren't watching. The younger children buy the toys, and what toys were selling? Uncle Grandpa's, Chowder, Flapjacks."
youngjustice,3b89u8,Chriiiiiiiiisss,2,Sat Jun 27 04:32:44 2015 UTC,"I have not encountered a single fan of Uncle Grandpa, nor have I seen one toy or any piece of merchandise floating around. I don't think that it was the usurper in any way, particularly since it didn't air until 6 months after Young Justice concluded. Chowder and Flapjack both ended in 2010.  Honestly, I don't know how Cartoon Network makes their money. They seem to treat hit shows with wide appeal as a plague that must be cured (cancelled). GLTAS and Young Justice were great shows, and CN couldn't handle them. Adventure Time is critically acclaimed, has amassed a huge following, and has embedded itself into the pop culture yet it receives maybe 15 minutes of airtime a week.  They just don't seem to know what to do with an adult audience, other than show them reruns of Family Guy and American Dad."
youngjustice,3b89u8,lord_terrene,2,Sat Jun 27 05:45:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Uncle Grandpa was just an example of the type of show I was talking about.  They make their money from Toy Sales. GLTAS, Young Justice, were not selling toys. The viewers were an audience of teenage boys, girls, and adults, who dont usually buy toys.   The little kids like the horrible over the top-disgustingly-stupid-shows. Like Spongebob, but more extreme. Those shows sell toys, since their market is the young boys who want the toys.   The cancellation due to lack of Toy Sales was confirmed by Bruce Timm(Creator for just about any DC animated film or show you can think of). I'm sure he brought it up in other interviews, but I listened to him on Kevin Smiths podcast 'Fatman on Batman' talk to Kevin about it and how DC animated was trying anything they could to please Cartoon Network(I believe this was his first time discussing it, then interviews came later when news broke)."

youngjustice,3b89u8,ResidentRedMage,2,Wed Jul 1 13:08:24 2015 UTC,First you would have to see if WB would allow it. They done some shit back during Justice League by not allowing the use of Batman rogues because of the batman movies.

While Netflix is a giant right now their marketing for a kids show is incredibly low. Look at things like their ""Riders of Berk"" and ""Inspector Gadget"" lines and you'll see low quality and not a whole lot of word of mouth.

youngjustice,3b1cjs,DearKC,2,Thu Jun 25 04:23:44 2015 UTC,"WB will sell to whoever will buy. The problem is that most girls (of any age) aren't as apt to buy action figures and superhero related merchandise as boys (of any age) are. That's becoming somewhat less true for certain Marvel brands with the very well done Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the fact remains that boys are usually the ones who will buy superhero toys, so they try to appeal to the boys more in order to make more profit.  Also, WB isn't against viewers of certain demographics. They don't really care that much who watches their shows. They just want money."
youngjustice,3b1cjs,Serapius,3,Fri Jun 26 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"What they car about IS money, but it'd be pretty easy to convince girls to buy their items. They just don't want to try and get the girls. Why work hard if we already have a cheap and easy, proven method?   But that argument is applicable in so many places. Video Games, for example. Why bother trying to make anything cool when we could just re-hash the same Halo/CoD/Assassian Creed etc etc formula?   It just annoys me that we can't have anything nice because all that matters is the money."
youngjustice,3b1cjs,Serapius,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:32:08 2015 UTC,"While that's true of pretty much any business, the things that break from the formula aren't usually made by the businesses.

youngjustice,3awlj2,LukeBullfrog,3,Wed Jun 24 05:54:59 2015 UTC,This was my favorite animated version of Amazon. He was a badass but no so much so that he didn't seem unbeatable.
youngjustice,3awlj2,thesagaconts,2,Wed Jun 24 14:04:11 2015 UTC,"He also seemed not OP, like in Justice League/Unlimited. Seems like Amazo can only access one power at a time."
youngjustice,3awlj2,moelester518,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:25:57 2015 UTC,Him being OP in JLU was the point of the character.
youngjustice,3awlj2,suss2it,2,Tue Jul 7 00:13:24 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or did the escrima sticks look super lightweight, I would think they'd be made of wood, or maybe some kind of metal and/or carbon.  I think I'm gonna chalk it up to animation, just needs a little flick of the wrist"
youngjustice,3awlj2,Wozrop,2,Thu Jun 25 04:50:41 2015 UTC,"This episode makes me wish there was a JL show that ran along side of YJ. Like the episode of JL would have had the league take down Amazo, then this episode has the team disposing of the android."
youngjustice,3awlj2,moelester518,2,Wed Jun 24 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean. I forget which specific episode , but it was when Wally had to run to deliver the heart (or something else I forget), and it showed Green Arrow's perspective."

youngjustice,3awbcz,OffenderJersey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:24:18 2015 UTC,"Didn't know sports master could be taken seriously u til this episode.   Also I really like how M'gann and Connor both didn't want the position of leader, and why Robin wasn't chosen."
youngjustice,3awbcz,moelester518,2,Wed Jun 24 19:29:07 2015 UTC,I think M'gann is too passive and Connor is unstable so they said no. I feel bad for Robin though because he's use to working in silent so having communication on the team is a con.  However they still believe robin is a leader
youngjustice,3awbcz,moelester518,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:31:51 2015 UTC,There's just so much thought put into this show and it makes me feel the mode whenever I think about it. Any other reason for Robin not being captain would've been a cop out IMO.

youngjustice,3ao34j,Wozrop,6,Mon Jun 22 04:00:22 2015 UTC,"Good lord. The begining episodes. I remember thinking the things were called Genomes, not G-nomes.  So here's a compiliation of my thoughts throughout the episode.  15s in: I like that sick ponytail.  The silhouttes of the light were cooler back then.  1:10. Why does it always have to be cloning with these people?  2:10. Forgot Wally had green eyes.  2:30. Those G-nomes are cute. Almost makes me want to have a shoulder G-nome.  4:23. I wish people would offer me a meet up with superman.  5:11. Really appreciating the Shading and animation here.  6:13. Hey, I recognize that sound from Star Wars.  6:33. Helping is my only option? I liked that.  7:40. Hey, they said 42. I wonder if that means anything? Probably not.  8:12. Superboy is already jobbing.  9:53. I like how they still end up in the Men's room.  12 min. All this Freedom is making me produce patriotic tears.  12:50. I loved how the muscles  and skin ripped with project blockbuster. Really tiny detail that builds overall look.  13:56. How do those double punches even work? I see them used in Superhero stuff all the time, but it seems so cartoonish to have two superheroes synch a punch.  15:08. Got to admit: that Got your nose joke was hilarious.  16:55. I remember seeing a parody on Conan about this scene with the justice league. That was kinda funny.  18 min. Green Arrow's Goatee!  18:48. The number 52. So integral.  20 min. I really liked how it was introduced as covert ops.  Overall great intro episode. Indeed gets you hyped to the series. One of the best first episodes I ever seen."
youngjustice,3ao34j,Stormygeddon,3,Mon Jun 22 03:33:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for  that! Just wanted to let you know you wrote 42 instead of 52 at 7.40

youngjustice,3ao34j,theathleticjew,6,Mon Jun 22 02:54:46 2015 UTC,"So well written. I was so confused and emotional after that scene. Superman is in an unique position, a difficult one. He was cloned without his knowledge or consent. Then this biologically engineered weapon that looks like him wants to be him? I completely understand Superman's discomfort and I know he doesn't have any responsibilities to Connor. But! He's Superman, I want him to be the guy that understands all that and becomes a father figure anyway."

youngjustice,3afs29,theathleticjew,15,Fri Jun 19 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"CHESHIRE! By far the most developed villain, if you have to give her a title. She's part of the two best relationships in the series, the first with Artemis and the second with Red Arrow. Cheshire in YJ was my entry into actual DC comicbooks. I wanted to learn more about the real her so I looked up some of her runs and bought the comics. All the new characters I met while reading about her, I did the same thing. Looked up more of them, bought the comics. That's the cycle! All thanks to Cheshire.    I watched Season 2 (and every other cartoon) on kisscartoon.me    *Btw mods, can we get a Cheshire cat mask flair?"
youngjustice,3afs29,Nylese,2,Fri Jun 19 20:44:53 2015 UTC,"I agree, but mostly because I knew nothing about her at all beforehand and her design instantly fascinated me. The cartoon really built her up."
youngjustice,3afs29,Nylese,5,Fri Jun 19 22:07:11 2015 UTC,I think DC missed a huge opportunity by not giving New 52 Cheshire the cat mask. Crazy how part of a minor character's redesign nearly became iconic.
youngjustice,3afs29,OffenderJersey,9,Fri Jun 19 22:54:23 2015 UTC,Black Manta was really well done in the show.
youngjustice,3afs29,Adekis,6,Sat Jun 20 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"Luthor, of course. Something about his perfect mixture of arrogance and intellect, coupled with the fact that I can see he and the Light's point of view, and why they're doing what they do- even though, of course, the way they're doing it means they have to be stopped.  Also, I just love how manipulative and brilliant Luthor is."

I like the other versions but this Lex is how he is in my mind."

youngjustice,3a84w5,SahirPatel,8,Wed Jun 17 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"Oh and another thing I forgot to mention was how much I loved the script. Robin from season one was brilliant. ""Why isn't anyone just whelmed"" ""definitely feeling the aster"" (can't remember who said that), ""there will always be a world to save"" (Artemis) and many more. Impulses future slang was pretty crash too."
youngjustice,3a84w5,Bardock_RD,3,Thu Jun 18 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the show was very awesome, I wouldn't compare it to Avatar because this seemed like only a fraction of the DC universe while the Avatar shows contained all there is and was all encompassing. But for the surprising maturity and well done animation it was great. I watched the show as it was airing, I was quite annoyed at the time skip and big group break up, the reasons of which we didn't find out till much later. But yeah all the new characters they introduced were superb and adding Static Shock to the lore was awesome.   Have you watched Justice league? It is also very good."
youngjustice,3a84w5,moelester518,3,Thu Jun 18 00:24:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for overall originality, Avatar takes the crown as it was wholly original and as you said all encompassing. A lot fewer characters too which helped gain some good character arcs. But for something that's taken from comics it was refreshing to see how brilliantly it was done.   As for the time gap, if it got another season I have a feeling it would have continued and we would have learnt more. Probably Arrow style flashbacks. Anyway, I doubt we'll ever see it back, but it was certainly fun whilst it lasted. Just wish there'd be one more season or two to last me till September when I start my master's but more importantly good old tv shows are back.  And no I haven't, I definitely will now though!"
youngjustice,3a84w5,Starpryme23,3,Thu Jun 18 00:34:59 2015 UTC,Seeing these threads pop up occasionally always makes me feel the mode. Glad you enjoyed it but I definitely feel a hint of disappointment every time.  It took CN 3 years to air two seasons. That just goes to show how much CN wanted to have it on their air instead of adventure time.

youngjustice,37zwz9,Serapius,2,Tue Jun 2 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"No offense taken! I have taken a lot of time and research to come up with this timeline so I am pretty sure their aren't any blatant contradictions BUT I am human so I may have missed a few things. If you would care to elaborate, that would really be helpful so I can move things around for a more seamless timeline. Thanks!"
youngjustice,37zwz9,autowikiabot,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"Well, in Crisis on Two Earths, the say they're in the process of building the Watchtower, which is already in use during Doom and is seen in Young Justice (though it obviously looks different).  I haven't seen Superman: unbound yet, but it seems to introduce Brainiac who is already introduced in the Young Justice comics Volume 4 (issues 20-25) which takes place before Season 2 starts.  I've also not seen JLA: Trapped in Time, but I'm fairly certain it wouldn't fit in any timeline well after All-Star Superman. In fact, All-Star Superman is a tough one since it makes a big deal of Superman deciding to tell Lois that he is really Clark, but in several other DC animated movies, they're already a couple (unless Superman manages to survive, but the ending doesn't leave a whole lot of ambiguity in my opinion).  Also, I would definitely include DC Showcase: Green Arrow earlier as it seems to establish that the little girl (her name eludes me) is just in the process of becoming the queen, where in Coldhearted she is already Vlatava's queen. I might also squeeze Return of Black Adam a little closer to Young Justice considering how similar Billy still looks during Young Justice. Maybe just make it take place in 2009 on your timeline?   Gotham Knight, Assault on Arkham, and Vixen are all parts of other, already established continuities and universes, but you're welcome to do with them what you will.  And this last part is a question, near the end of the Post-Paradox section you have something labelled Nightwing and Robin. What exactly is this? A comics series?  EDIT: Another piece I just noticed, I would make Batman: Year One and Wonder Woman happen before Green Lantern: First Flight (I would also say Batman: Year One should be the first of those two, but that's personal preference). It's mostly a nitpicking thing since Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman are the Big Three, so I typically would equate them as the modern superheroes who started their careers first.  And Emerald Knights should probably have a larger gap between it and First Flight. They aren't actually related and there are some continuity issues between them, but given a large enough gap, some can be somewhat overlooked (in my personal timeline, I placed Emerald Knights right around the start of season 2 of YJ since it helps explain the lack of GL Corps in that season).  Other that those, the timeline is definitely serviceable. It fulfills what it needs to fulfill, there are just a few things that one could clean up about it. And perhaps with a small bit of trimming."
youngjustice,37zwz9,Serapius,2,Tue Jun 2 20:00:04 2015 UTC,"OK Let me address each point, you make some great points here and most I have an answer for so here goes...   Well, in Crisis on Two Earths, the say they're in the process of building the Watchtower, which is already in use during Doom and is seen in Young Justice (though it obviously looks different).   In my headcanon, during the events of Superman/Batman: Public Enemies (which takes place a few years before Crisis in my timeline) Lex Luthor breaks up and disbands the JLA as President. Either the superheroes work for him or they are rebels (like Batman and Superman). Over the course of that time, Lex destroys the Watchtower (or confiscates it for US Government). So the JLA doesn't get back together for a few years until shortly before the film Crisis On Two Earth's start. So in my timeline, Batman is funding and building a brand new watchtower that is the same model as the one seen in Justice League Doom. Also, Batman is noticeably older sounding and looking in that one. Superman also has an older voice so that's why that film is placed later in the timeline. In Doom they all look almost exactally the same as in Young Justice Season 2 AND the last scene of the finale sets up Vandal Savage as a major villian for that film. I'd like to think Vandal was working for Darkseid and then when Superman/Batman: Apocalypse happens a few films later, Darkseid has his plans unleashed (Doomsday clones).   I haven't seen Superman: unbound yet, but it seems to introduce Brainiac who is already introduced in the Young Justice comics Volume 4 (issues 20-25) which takes place before Season 2 starts.   For my timeline, I do not count comics of any kind so those are out. Superman Unbound serves as a great sequel to Apocolypes because Supergirl has only been around for a few months, and we finally learn the true story of why she was sent to Earth. Her ""memory lapses"" in Apocalypse explain why her original story and perception of her parents was indeed wrong and are corrected in Unbound.   I've also not seen JLA: Trapped in Time, but I'm fairly certain it wouldn't fit in any timeline well after All-Star Superman. In fact, All-Star Superman is a tough one since it makes a big deal of Superman deciding to tell Lois that he is really Clark, but in several other DC animated movies, they're already a couple (unless Superman manages to survive, but the ending doesn't leave a whole lot of ambiguity in my opinion).   A few things, All Star Superman is a part of the ""post paradox"" timeline so Lois finds out for the first time in that film that Clark is Superman. I wrestled with the ending for awhile to explain JLA Adventures being after (Supes looks and sounds older than he does in All-Star) so I've come to the conclusion that the original Superman is transformed into a being of pure energy. At the end of the movie, when Lex is in his cell, he gives Quintum a complete map of Superman's genetic code and the method to replicate it. So I say that Quintum ""creates"" a new Superman and implants the memories of the original into the new one. The new one is rapidly aged (through unknown means) to the same age as the Original one was before he ""died"" in the sun. So the world thinks Superman never actually died, he just ""repaired the sun"". That explains his appearances in Trapped in Time and Dark Knight Returns, a clone.   Also, I would definitely include DC Showcase: Green Arrow earlier as it seems to establish that the little girl (her name eludes me) is just in the process of becoming the queen, where in Coldhearted she is already Vlatava's queen. I might also squeeze Return of Black Adam a little closer to Young Justice considering how similar Billy still looks during Young Justice. Maybe just make it take place in 2009 on your timeline?   Green Arrow was tough but I figured it out to the best of my knowledge. So my headcanon says that Perdita's father died the night before, making her Vlatava's new Queen. She is actually the young sister of ex-Queen Perdita – the blonde 16 year old niece of Count Vertigo we saw in YJ. I say that Merlyn has already assassinated the blond older sister so now this girl is the last survivor of her family, and now Queen. Black Canary also accepts Oliver's proposal at the end and they are only dating in YJ. And last, Green Arrow has a more modern looking costume by this point. The only thing that slighly bothers me is Wally West's phone number being in his cell phone, but we can say that that incident was still recent and Oliver didn't get the chance or remember to delete the contact, minor thing.  I'm fine with where Black Adam is because Superman looks slightly younger than in YJ, Billy looks the same but is living alone, not with his Uncle. Black Adam technically gets ""killed"" at the end (ages 5 thousand years in a single second) but I say it’s possible that Wotan used his sorcery to bring him back for YJ.    Gotham Knight, Assault on Arkham, and Vixen are all parts of other, already established continuities and universes, but you're welcome to do with them what you will.   I am aware these aren't intended to be in this, but that's why it's called ""headcanon"". Gotham Knight serves as a great sequel to Batman Year One. The only thing is James Gordon isn't a Captain, he's a Lt. despite being promoted at the end of Year One. My explanation is he may have been promoted, but it hasn't taken effect yet, which can happen. Assault On Arkham fits with no contradictions that I can see. Vixen, well I'll have to find out!   And this last part is a question, near the end of the Post-Paradox section you have something labelled Nightwing and Robin. What exactly is this? A comics series?   It's a short film included on the Throne Of Atlantis Blu Ray that bridges the gap between that movie and Batman vs. Robin.   EDIT: Another piece I just noticed, I would make Batman: Year One and Wonder Woman happen before Green Lantern: First Flight (I would also say Batman: Year One should be the first of those two, but that's personal preference). It's mostly a nitpicking thing since Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman are the Big Three, so I typically would equate them as the modern superheroes who started their careers first.   Batman Year One, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern First Flight all happen when they do based on the official YJ timeline Greg Weisman came up with.   And Emerald Knights should probably have a larger gap between it and First Flight. They aren't actually related and there are some continuity issues between them, but given a large enough gap, some can be somewhat overlooked (in my personal timeline, I placed Emerald Knights right around the start of season 2 of YJ since it helps explain the lack of GL Corps in that season).   This was confusing since the animation style is the same. BUT I figured it out. The events in this film and the previous film (First Flight) take place within a span of 4 days due to Arisia mentioning thats how long ago it was since she was selected to be a lantern. Sinestro has been returned to the Green Lantern Corps, albeit under watchful eye. Hal Jordan seems to have learned quite a bit about the Corps since he began a few days ago.   Other that those, the timeline is definitely serviceable. It fulfills what it needs to fulfill, there are just a few things that one could clean up about it. And perhaps with a small bit of trimming.   I hope I helped explain this well! Any more questions would be great!"
youngjustice,37zwz9,Serapius,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"Savage's inclusion in Doom is exactly why I would place it before Young Justice. His plans with The Light seem much more elaborate and thought out, so I'd assume they all come together AFTER his attempt with the Legion of Doom.   For the Arisia thing, I find it easier to just believe those are two different characters who just happen to look similar (just like how Boodika died in First Flight, but a character who looks just like her appears in Emerald Knights).  I understand this is headcanon, but I feel like the All-Star Superman thing is a bit too much self-interpretation. Again, you're welcome to have them however you want, but shouldn't the order be determined by what takes the least explaining?  And can you source that thing about Greg Weisman giving a rough timeline? I haven't heard of that before! It may make me reinterpret my own timeline. :)"

But then he says something along the lines of ""Be careful, I fear we leave the more dangerous task to you.""

In season 2 when we see Dick as Nightwing and Tim as Robin at first I assumed they skipped Jason to go with the two most famous Robins, but then in the cave where they honored the dead you can see a shrine to Jason Todd. I think it shows the writers attention to detail and that they didn't want to tell stories, they wanted to create a universe. I got the feeling that the world of YJ was huge and that I was privileged to be a part of it, even if it was a small part."
youngjustice,34g31l,Narissis,9,Fri May 1 05:50:51 2015 UTC,"The way YJ builds a world is amazing.

youngjustice,34g31l,Leooel9,13,Fri May 1 19:38:35 2015 UTC,"I love lots of things about it, but something that stands out is the attention to detail and the way little hints are written in that you pick up on during a re-watch.  For instance, there are a few very subtle hints dropped about the ""Hello Megan!"" show before the reveal in episode 21. In a much earlier episode, Superboy gets upset with Megan and accuses her of living in a fantasy world where all her problems can be solved in half an hour. A few episodes later, Billy Batson gets home and his uncle (I think that's his uncle, anyway) is watching TV. The screen is never shown, but the music playing is the ""Hello Megan!"" opening theme. I think there were a few other little hints, but I don't recall off the top of my head.  There's also the fact that I loved Gargoyles and Greg Weisman called back in a lot of his old contacts for voice acting. Mongul is Goliath (Keith David), Queen Bee is Demona (Marina Sirtis), Red Tornado is Brooklyn and Owen (Jeff Bennett), G. Gordon Godfrey is Dr. Anton Servarius (Tim Curry)... etc., etc.  And I like the version of Beast Boy they created in YJ. He amuses me. ""Tell me something we don't know... yet! When do I join the Justice League?! When do I become leader of the team?! When do I get my own reality series?!"" I wish he'd gotten more screen time."

youngjustice,341e06,suss2it,1 point,Tue May 5 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"Well, if one decides to include Flashpoint Paradox at the end of the timeline I've given, then it would lead directly into the DCnAU which, as far as I know, have been released in chronological order and are very obviously linked. That means that the Justice League formed chronologically later in the DCnAU as opposed to my proposed Earth-16 timeline since Dick was already acting alone as Nightwing when the JL formed in Justice League: War.  That means that after Flashpoint Paradox, the movies would follow thus:   Justice League: War-  This movie is also a possible explanation for the end of Young Justice: Invasion since the comics have revealed that there is only one Darkseid in the New 52 Multiverse (though I'd guess the one seen here is separate by default). Son of Batman- Which solidifies the idea that the JL formed later since Dick is already Nightwing and Damian shows up to become Robin. Justice League: Throne of Atlantis- Introduction of Aquaman in the animated New 52-niverse. Batman vs. Robin- I haven't gotten to watch this one yet, but it seems to be vaguely reminiscent of the Court of Owls storyline (though I hear it isn't a direct adaptation)."

youngjustice,33j4f3,WW4O,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:00:33 2015 UTC,"How much money could they have lost from a comic? Fuck, even a web comic woulda done the trick"
youngjustice,33j4f3,MarBakwas,3,Thu Apr 23 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"It's not about how much it costs to print. They have to pay the writers, artist, colorist, inker, letterer, editor, and asst. editor. DC doesn't make ""web comics,"" and they also don't make decisions based on the logic ""Eh, how bad could it be?"" They had a comic series running parallel to the show. They look at how many people watched the show, how many read the book, and how many are buying things related to YJ now, and it's a no-brainer. A smattering of fanatics on the internet isn't enough to justify launching a new title."
youngjustice,33j4f3,WW4O,2,Thu Apr 23 15:39:13 2015 UTC,Reality sucks :(
youngjustice,33j4f3,MarBakwas,2,Thu Apr 23 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree.  Well, kinda. I think part of it is also that DC has a book that resembles YJ. It's called Teen Titans. And they have The Outlaws. And Gotham Academy. There isn't as much more room for young characters written for older audiences."
youngjustice,33j4f3,WW4O,2,Thu Apr 23 15:47:05 2015 UTC,How's Gotham academy
