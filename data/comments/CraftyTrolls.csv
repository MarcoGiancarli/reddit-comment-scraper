CraftyTrolls,3dqwh2,Belgara,4,Sat Jul 18 16:18:30 2015 UTC,I really need this in my life.
CraftyTrolls,3dqwh2,cupreous,4,Sat Jul 18 21:58:01 2015 UTC,Here's where I bought the pattern.  The framing I did myself because getting it framed by someone else is ludicrously expensive >_<
CraftyTrolls,3dqwh2,Fynaly,2,Sat Jul 18 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"This is great! The frame is perfect for it, too."
CraftyTrolls,3dqwh2,NeverNix,2,Sun Jul 19 11:27:43 2015 UTC,Yay!
CraftyTrolls,3cfw07,IStillNeedaSong,2,Tue Jul 7 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"I love these! My sister made me a pair for Christmas a couple of years ago, but they started cracking with wear :( Any preventative tips for my next pair?"
CraftyTrolls,3cfw07,ansible_jane,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:38:20 2015 UTC,I haven't figured out how to make a good every day pair. I made myself some and just wear them sometimes and used a waterproof shellac
CraftyTrolls,3cfw07,Upstagemalarky,2,Wed Jul 8 12:01:16 2015 UTC,"These are awesome!!!! I want a pair in each of my fave comics!!!!  I have a pair of Wonder Woman 6"" stiletto heels done like this. Is this modge podge collage stuff?  Your post said you have worn shoes like this out, how did they hold up?"
CraftyTrolls,3cfw07,DramaDramaLlama,2,Wed Jul 8 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"Mine are still fine a year later! I don't wear them out often though.   Yeah! It's just mod podge. It's super easy, just a bit time consuming."
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,ptera_tinsel,7,Sat Jun 27 20:00:33 2015 UTC,My giftee posted an adorable pic of her son playing with it here!  x-posted to /r/dinosaurs and /r/somethingimade
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,ceralyn,3,Sat Jun 27 20:02:36 2015 UTC,I wish I was motivated enough to be crafty (beyond the little bit of knitting I can accomplish)!!  I would make the hell out of that Triceratops as it is my namesake.
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,pulpfriction24,2,Sat Jun 27 22:40:12 2015 UTC,It's so cute! How long did that take you?
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,pulpfriction24,4,Sat Jun 27 20:22:47 2015 UTC,I'm not exactly sure. It was piecemeal over two weeks and my family helped with some parts (the water was especially time consuming because I wanted everything handstitched for effect). A lot of that was just futzing with the patterns and proportions though. I didn't have a pattern for the mat or volcano and I wasn't happy with the three dinosaur patterns I bought. I not only modified them but changed two into patterns for the Plesiosaur and the Iguanodon.
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,emberlyc14,2,Sat Jun 27 20:30:48 2015 UTC,Incredible! Good Job!!
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,emberlyc14,2,Sat Jun 27 20:33:51 2015 UTC,That's incredible! Do you have a pattern for the dinosaurs?
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,emberlyc14,3,Sat Jun 27 21:14:27 2015 UTC,"I bought a pattern for the Triceratops, Apatosaurus, and Stegosaurus. I can't recommend it because I had to modify it to get it to look right. The Plesiosaurus and Iguanodon I modified from the patterns I derived from the Stegosaurus and Apatosaurus.  I'm making original patterns for all with more pleasing proport ions this Sunday as another redditor has comissioned one!"
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,eviespet,3,Sat Jun 27 21:23:20 2015 UTC,Congratulations!! Will those patterns be for sale?
CraftyTrolls,3bc1jd,bonifate,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:48:36 2015 UTC,I'm unsure. My mother (seamstress for 20+ years) and I are trying to figure out the viability of selling some of these on etsy right now.
CraftyTrolls,3b6o0b,sessyda,8,Fri Jun 26 12:09:14 2015 UTC,That is stunning and gorgeous and I am just wondering if you are currently accepting applications for new bff's?
CraftyTrolls,3b6o0b,cupreous,3,Fri Jun 26 15:07:23 2015 UTC,"There was an error in casting (I think I didn't have the torch focused properly so the metal cooled a bit and I got a weird pour), so one of the back legs became an accidental set of balls.  Best possible accident."
CraftyTrolls,3b6o0b,GenericGropaga,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:12:17 2015 UTC,very cool! What is that bronze?

CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,yarboa,8,Sat Jun 20 22:37:30 2015 UTC,Isn't there a way to use sharpies or some other marker on porcelain dish ware then bake them to set? Maybe do that with plates or bowls or something?
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,CrazyWithACat,8,Sat Jun 20 23:58:43 2015 UTC,Penises. Penises everywhere.
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,digitalyss,3,Sun Jun 21 12:33:15 2015 UTC,"THIS!!! We did this on Friday! Admittedly I was the only person drinking, but we got a bunch of white mugs and a pack of sharpies, drew em then left them in the oven at my friend's house, they're now baked and we're collecting on Monday :)"
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,PhoenixGrey,2,Sun Jun 21 08:38:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was thinking about something like that, that sounds like it could be a lot of fun"
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,CrossEyed-FishFace,5,Mon Jun 22 05:01:35 2015 UTC,"Some friends and I invented a game. (at least we think we invented it) It's called Draw Game.   Once we're all a little drunk, we all get some paper and draw whatever we want for 2-5 minutes. Then pass it to the person on the left. You keep drawing and passing until you get your original paper back. The best drawing at the end wins a beer."
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,CrossEyed-FishFace,2,Sun Jun 21 16:26:00 2015 UTC,"That sounds kind of like pictionary telephone! Rather than whispering a phrase around a circle, each person has a pad of paper and draws a phrase/scene on it, the next person draws what they saw on the next page, and it goes around the circle where each person only sees the most recent drawing. It's hilarious seeing how they change.. the worse people draw the better it gets :)"
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,Whatsername_,2,Mon Jun 22 05:14:45 2015 UTC,"yeah! And since everyone is drawing on every page, no one gets left out because of skill or lack there of."
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,ptera_tinsel,5,Mon Jun 22 09:12:43 2015 UTC,"Baking/decorating cookies or cupcakes.   Making book safes for keeping flasks. This requires knives and a steady hand though so maybe in the beginning of the night.   After carving all those pages out of a book, you could use the paper to make papier-mache and do all kinds of things, like sculptures of each other (or you) or dicks or whatever.  Papier-mache literally just required paper and paste, the latter you can make with flour and water."
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,koh522,2,Sat Jun 20 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"Haha, one of my friends that will be there has cut soo many old books into flask hide-a-ways. He's got a collection going now.  I like the papier mache idea, I would never have thought about that"
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,__Shadynasty_,3,Mon Jun 22 05:03:28 2015 UTC,"Haha, one of my friends that will be there has cut soo many old books into flask hide-a-ways.   Perfect! People will think I'm an eclectic lover of literature on the surface but once they open me up they'll realize I'm just a lying, shallow drunk."
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,AppleSpicer,4,Sat Jun 27 20:17:41 2015 UTC,One of those drink-and-paint classes! There's a ton of them all over the US now (hopefully that's where you are) and I've had tons of fun over the last ten+ years. ... I also have a stack of paintings in my closet. It's kind of addictive.
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,WeddingShit,2,Sun Jun 21 14:35:34 2015 UTC,also there are plenty of groupons for them
CraftyTrolls,3ajwi1,WeddingShit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"When I searched for adult art ideas that came up a lot, and I love the sound of it! For a bachelorette party we went to an art studio and made splatter paintings - everyone made small personal ones and then we did one big one for the bride to take. It was lots of fun and they let us have our champagne and wine and food and everything which was so fun!  I think we might do some variation on the same and just do some painting all together, my friend and I have lots of paint between the two of us, plus brushes and paper/canvases.. so low cost is nice - more money for food and booze, haha"

CraftyTrolls,3aeufw,NeverNix,2,Fri Jun 19 15:34:23 2015 UTC,Is the shape something or just a neat pattern?
CraftyTrolls,3aeufw,adibidibadibi,7,Fri Jun 19 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a long story, but the fanged kitten head is the symbol for a collective of people claiming to be a fascist state (very sarcastic and and silly and tongue in cheek.) They're actually all very hardworking and kind. This subtle nod on the back of a baby blanket with unicorns and rainbows on the front is meant to mess with the heads of the Mad Max-esque looking group. Trying to troll them a little :)"

There!"" while I load the coupon.   We could totally be friends."
CraftyTrolls,37yra7,Never_Really,3,Sun May 31 20:58:28 2015 UTC,hahah i have done the same thing. I've also had to go into the parking lot to get enough service for it to load...

CraftyTrolls,37wvpk,PocketHippo,2,Sun May 31 04:20:23 2015 UTC,How lovely! Is this on a tea towel? Did you use a transfer or did you freehand?
CraftyTrolls,37wvpk,PocketHippo,1 point,Sun May 31 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"It's on a piece of linen.  The linen was sheer enough I could see the pattern on a piece of paper behind the fabric so I could transfer it.  I don't know exactly what you mean by a transfer, but that is what I did."
CraftyTrolls,37wvpk,PocketHippo,2,Sun May 31 15:10:18 2015 UTC,"I meant the iron-on kind of transfers specifically. Envy would have ensued if you had free-handed that design cuz mine come out ""quirky."" :-P    I love the little bird. Your stitches are so tidy."

She knows I'm slightly allergic to my cat, but she also knows that I am a weird hippie who hoards crafting supplies like there's going to be a yarn apocalypse.  Last Christmas she wrapped all of her gifts in the most glitterific ribbon ever, which shed everywhere, and I am still finding teensy tiny glitter bits in the most unlikely places.    Be nice to your younger sisters, trolls. One day they will figure out what's up and begin their subtle, artful revenge."
CraftyTrolls,37wmz7,elizalemon,2,Sun May 31 00:43:15 2015 UTC,I thought it was only the dander of the pet hair people are typically allergic to? Maybe you could wash it so it wouldn't hurt you anymore. I'm sure this solution is in the internet somewhere.
CraftyTrolls,37wmz7,SammaSunshine,1 point,Sun May 31 02:02:30 2015 UTC,I am hoping that's true. It must be if I can wash a thing and it doesn't make my eyes itch anymore?

CraftyTrolls,36r5wc,cheesemeow,2,Thu May 21 13:48:39 2015 UTC,"I get inspiration from Pinterest and have found good tutorials that way.    For Cross Stitch I like using this site to map out my letters, but usually modify the font a bit because I am not incredibly fond of their free ones. http://www.stitchpoint.com/eng/tool/alph/cross-stitch-writing-tool.php  If you want to cross stitch your own drawn or photograph pattern there are also sites that will create a pattern for you. http://www.pic2pat.com/index.en.html http://www.myphotostitch.com/ These give you the option of how detailed you want to be, but can get complicated.  Good luck! :)"
CraftyTrolls,36r5wc,tara6jade,2,Thu May 21 14:46:52 2015 UTC,Paging /u/immigrantpatriot to the white courtesy phone.
CraftyTrolls,36r5wc,NeverNix,3,Thu May 21 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"I've never been mentioned before, this is the apex of my reddit experience thus far!   So to answer OPs questions, I can highly recommend any of Jenny Hart's/Sublime Stitching beginner kits.  All the stitches you need are covered, but if you get stuck you can always watch a YouTube tutorial, I've yet to hit a stitch I can't find help with there.  There's also a ton of a little ""sassier"" designs than is usual in ""learn to embroider"" books included.    This is totally a personal preference, but I moved on pretty quickly from the above style when I discovered ""needle painting,"" for which I can recommend any beginner book by Trish Burr.  I've been working through that book for months & I'm only halfway through the projects - definitely worth the $20 cover price.  It's extremely picky & intense, but I love the results.  I've posted most of my projects to /r/Embroidery, or I just started an Instagram account (b/c I'm going to start branching out & personalizing some designs) that has them as well: @stclareembroidery  OP (or anyone), please feel free to PM me if there's anything else I can tell you/help with!"
CraftyTrolls,36r5wc,immigrantpatriot,1 point,Thu May 21 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"That sounds like fun, and I bet you're going to have some awesome bags when you're done (are they for something in particular, like project bags, or for gift/sale?).   Are you planning to do cross stitch style embroidery or just... whatever you call the other kind, non-counted? I've seen a lot of awesome stuff in the embroidery hoop swaps on craftsty (and by searching for them on pinterest), but if you're looking for sassy then I recommend the style of Subversive Cross Stitch. The combination of classic sampler lettering and borders just makes the dirty language so much funnier."
CraftyTrolls,36r5wc,captain_apostrophe,1 point,Thu May 21 14:42:35 2015 UTC,Just my own personal project bags so they can be as awful as I want! I was planning on doing the more non counted embroidery because the grid is too small for cross stitch (which I have a little experience in). I love the subversive book but it won't work with this fabric :(
CraftyTrolls,36r5wc,captain_apostrophe,2,Thu May 21 14:46:47 2015 UTC,"You can get stuff that lets you do cross stitch on non-counted fabric, I've used both kinds and if you like the style of cross stitch it could be worth a try. There's one type that is basically waste aida you baste on and then, when you're done stitching over it, you grab some tweezers and pull it out from under the stitches. There's also a kind that is a bit like plastic but when you soak the fabric it dissolves. Either way they give you a way to cross stitch on plain fabric.  But for non-counted embroidery you can still do the same designs as the subversive stuff, you'd just need to use non-grid based fonts to stitch the words. There are heaps of stitch dictionaries that can show you stitches that are great for wording, I used this one myself. Padded satin stitch is my particular favourite, for example I used it in these hoops to make sure the embroidery really stood out from the cloth and didn't just kinda disappear against it like drawn lines."
CraftyTrolls,36r5wc,May_of_Teck,1 point,Thu May 21 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"Online tutorials will give you everything you need to get started, but I just have to recommend the Reader's Digest Guide to Embroidery.  I picked this up when I started embroidery, and it's awesome.  Very clear, easy to follow instructions and illustrations, on every stitch under the sun.  It has beautiful photography, and offers tons of inspiration.  Honestly I think every crafter should have this on their shelf!  ...and that's my rant; I swear I don't work for Reader's Digest!! :D"

CraftyTrolls,36n5tb,zorgtron,2,Wed May 20 20:43:18 2015 UTC,This looks like the perfect skirt! Did you use a pattern or tutorial? I love me some handmade skirts.
CraftyTrolls,36n5tb,zorgtron,4,Wed May 20 20:01:49 2015 UTC,Simplicity 2226 was the pattern. This tutorial really helped as well. I didn't make the belt or belt loops that came along with this.

If you put some little photos around it and then some cork tiles or tiles somehting painted with blackboard paint it could be a combo of displaying photos and notes/nice words/future birthday cards. If you have any small items, wine or beer corks, bits of ribbon or wrapping paper you could incorporate those into the border.   Lovely photo by the way :)"
CraftyTrolls,36nsea,captain_apostrophe,2,Wed May 20 18:59:52 2015 UTC,I'm one sleeve and one cuff away from finishing my first ever steeked knitting: a cardigan with a bit of stranded colourwork added in (from the Knitty 'Shapely Boyfriend' pattern) (ok and maybe it needs some sort of finishing on the neckline but I'm not sure about that). I've made a cardigan once before and it was kind of an abomination - but this one fits perfectly and I'm so excited to be able to wear it and show it off.

CraftyTrolls,345w8m,savbee23,3,Tue Apr 28 17:37:20 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I actually have been working on getting my walls thinner so I'm glad you said that!  Last night I started using a different clay and I was able to get things to be SO thin.  It was awesome.  So I think the things that I start to make now with this new clay will definitely come out lighter.  My last clay was just too soft for super thin walls (and before that I just wasn't good enough to get things to be very thin).  This new clay is a bit sturdier.

CraftyTrolls,33wjod,crabballs,2,Mon Apr 27 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I just used regular acrylic paint that you can buy almost anywhere. As for a basic tutorial first I taped off the bottom rubber part of the shoe. Then I used red and yellow for the base sunset colors and blended them together with a soft sponge around the whole shoe.  For the giraffes I looked up ""giraffe silhouette"" to get an idea of how I wanted them to look and freehand painted them. Another way to do the giraffes is to print out a picture of the silhouette and cut them out with an exacto-knife. Then tape the paper down onto the dried shoe. From there either you can paint over it with a sponge or even use spray paint. When you carefully lift the paper up you'll have nice clean lines. Hope this helped, craft on!"

CraftyTrolls,30epgi,Voyeuristicintent,2,Fri Mar 27 04:57:39 2015 UTC,Did you cast the bracer? What is it made out if? Curious Trolls want to know?
CraftyTrolls,30epgi,Voyeuristicintent,3,Fri Mar 27 16:15:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I cast it! I made the master out of wax clay and used a mix of fiberglass and autobody filler to make a mold. After it cured and I scraped all the clay out (which is an exhausting process, btw!) I poured in some fx-grade silicone. Then I cut the cast siicone to fit my wrist/forearm, trimming scales to disguise the seam, glued with more silicone, and painted it with yet more silicone mixed with pigment and thinned with mineral spirits. I wish you could see how intensely sparkly it is in person! I used cosmetic-grade pigments like you use to make eyeshadow or nail polish so the glitter is out of control!"

I tried other mold materials before getting the body filler/fiberglass tip from another mermaid tail-maker. What kind of mold material you need really depends on what you plan to cast your final piece in. Stiff material = flexible mold, flexible material = stiff mold. If you want some brushable plastic, I have almost 2 gallons of this stuff called Shell Shock that didn't work for my applications. It's good stuff, it just set up a little too fast to do what I needed."

CraftyTrolls,305e4r,GretaX,8,Tue Mar 24 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"Backstory: When she was a Brownie, I would sew patches on sashes/vests for the whole troop, because all the other moms were like, ""Oh, I don't know how to sew! flap flap"" Or they would try to iron them on, which lasts about 30 seconds with most Girl Scout patches.   Fast forward to Juniors, and I no longer sewed them on for everybody (put my foot down). Daughter knew how to use the sewing machine but getting her to actually do her own patches was like pulling teeth. She preferred making doll clothes and skirts for herself.  But NOW! Now is the time! She just went and did it.   Cheers cheers cheers cheers cheers"

(Alternate account just because it links to real life identity)  I'm at a point in my life where I am trying to figure out what really makes me happy and keeps me present in my life. I have been stressed, frustrated, feeling far away from the places and people I love.  I've always loved baking. I shared many learning moments with my mother as she taught me how to bake as a kid. Many triumphs, many mistakes. I shared my food with my family, with friends.  I am slowly (slowly)growing an Etsy shop to keep myself baking, to work towards some goals, maybe to make a few dollars, and to allow myself a sense of independence and pride.  I am so happy that I actually went through the trouble to get going! I've had many challenges, figuring out how to ship very finicky perishable food, how to get candy to perfect temperatures while cooking without a thermometer, etc. With my emotional state right now, I often want to hide and give up and this project is no exception, but it gives me a way to also move past those feelings.

You need to make sure you fill out each section of your shop - photo, info, shipping policies, etc. and have thorough/detailed listings - at least 3 but ideally 5 really good photos, detailed description, list of materials, etc. The more people can learn about you and your products, the more they will be drawn in and want to buy from you. Try to highlight something unique about you/your process/your products.  The great thing is you can build it in pieces, and add one listing, then another, and edit things all along.  In terms of advertising and building up your sales and reviews and getting a steady flow of orders.... I don't really know. I like keeping mine at a low level so it's just a small side project."

CraftyTrolls,2zribp,Mussycat,2,Sat Mar 21 14:23:11 2015 UTC,How do you join the curves and make it look so neat?!
CraftyTrolls,2zribp,euchlid,2,Sun Mar 22 00:09:37 2015 UTC,"The book I'm using (""A Quilter's Mixology"") has a really great way of doing it.    Find the center of your two pieces and lay them face together. Pin the center point. I like to pin the ends with a single pin for getting started.  Start sewing from one end towards the center. The key is this: Do not think of it as sewing a curve. Think of it as a straight line. You need to be careful to keep your edges lined up as they go under the foot, but just go as slow as you need to. (You will get faster with practice.) Once you get to the center pin, stop, cut your threads and have a look. If you happened to get a little fold in it, pull out the seam to a few stitches before and have another go.  Once you're done with that one, flip it and do the same from the other side. Make sure you stitch over the other seam a bit to lock it down. After that press it, with the seam to the inside. Then square and trim your block to size. This author has you make the blocks bigger than you need by about 1/4"" so you have some built in wiggle room.   This method is great because it breaks the seam into 2 parts which gives you more chances to check it, and also means you know the pieces are going to hit the edges and center accurately. I'd never done curved piecing before and though it took me a couple tries, it wasn't particularly frustrating because I consistently got at least the first half of the seam right. I only really had trouble with the two seams meeting in the middle because it'd get caught and I'd sew over a little fold. But I only had to take out a few stitches to fix it.   Sorry if that was too technical of an answer but I honestly expected this to be a LOT harder and I'm so excited about how well it went!"

CraftyTrolls,2yhvos,digitalyss,3,Tue Mar 10 01:31:55 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my concern but you could maybe wear it with a racer back tank top underneath? One long enough to also layer out at the bottom.

CraftyTrolls,2wbv49,digitalyss,3,Thu Feb 19 07:15:52 2015 UTC,Try the dollar store. The ones by me usually have little figures.
CraftyTrolls,2vzc97,Emsaves,4,Sun Feb 15 16:39:52 2015 UTC,"I love the rose bouquet, the cakes on stands, and the doily dress.   The single tiered cake looks more like a stack of presents, so you might need to select different papers to suggest a cake or using something else for the topper.  The cupcakes need more dimension... I suggest you make the icing wider than the cake base, and glue on a second smaller curved piece of white glitter paper to suggest icing swirl?"
CraftyTrolls,2vzc97,AlvaSt-Snow,1 point,Mon Feb 16 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"Those are some really good points. I was thinking of changing the topper on the cake to a tiny bride and groom decal, but haven't been able to find anything that looks good. I didn't think of changing the colors, though- that's a good idea! Maybe if I replaced the pink polka dot layer with something more muted, it would look more bridal. And I will try the glitter idea with the cupcakes. Thank you so much for your feedback!"

CraftyTrolls,2v915n,hbeen,6,Mon Feb 9 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"So it's probably not the most effective method, but I got Sharpie oil-based paint markers and drew directly on the mug after cleaning it with rubbing alcohol. After that I put the mug in a cold oven and turned the temp up to 450 (this might've been overkill as the gold marker lost it's shine at the end). Once the oven was pre-heated I timed it for 2 hours. After 2 hours I turned the oven off and let the mug cool over night. The result was a pretty decent mug. I've hand washed it multiple times and it seems like it's permanent. I even scrubbed it with the rough side of my sponge and there was no chipping at all. IDK if it'll hold up in the dishwasher, though..."

CraftyTrolls,2v7cvu,kickasschemist,2,Sun Feb 8 16:57:13 2015 UTC,What yarn did you use? Did you just wing the pattern?
CraftyTrolls,2v7cvu,ansible_jane,3,Sun Feb 8 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure. It was a very thick weight that felt like cotton, but it came from a hand-me-down box of knitting stuff.
