In my opinion, finding the stairs in order of difficulty is 3,1,2,4.   4 is obvious, 2 is mostly through a wall by spawn, 3 is wherever the hell it feels like.

However 2-1/3-1/4-1 use the second value, x-2 use the third, and x-3 uses the fourth. The fifth is used if you have a ring of luck or lucky charm on an x-3 level or if you have both on an x-2 level.   Probability is determined by adding all the values and dividing.   Chest chance is the same way, your interpretation is wrong. Each value is their chance to appear at a certain item level.   Locked chest is chance to appear In a blue mimic, white mimic, crate, or barrel. Locked shop is the locked shop, the one you bomb into.

If your way of getting to the debug involves modding the xml at all that'll auto-disable leaderboards, but I'm not sure about other things that would have that effect."

Playing with seems to put your score in the beta leaderboards or something like this i guess.  If you check the currents you won't see any Aria in Diphome logs."
necrodancer,3dzort,jonneburger,3,Tue Jul 21 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, those are the dev / debug leaderboards (suffix _DEV) that the testers had access to.

necrodancer,3dwka0,Fubzo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:59 2015 UTC,Couldn't the coral riff fight be sped up a little bit by lunging at the head immediately instead of going through all of phase 1?
necrodancer,3dwka0,narwhalman53,3,Mon Jul 20 05:18:20 2015 UTC,"In phase 1 of Coral Riff, if you're in the top 4 rows of the boss chamber (the ones that are water to start), the head avoids staying in the same column as you by moving around the 3 center columns. You can see this at 1:12 in the video when I jump in the water and Coral Riff moves left.  That prevents hitting the head from below in the first phase unless you have a weapon with 4 range or more (Crossbow, Rifle). If you walk all the way up to the top to try to hit him from the side, you will be attacked by either the head or the keytars, so to hit him from close distance, you need a wide-attack weapon (such as a Broadsword). Another common strategy is to bomb him out but I don't have a bomb at that point in the run.  Without re-routing to have more items, I think the only way to do him faster would be to set things up so that there's not as much water beneath him when phase 2 starts. I didn't try it so I don't know how hard it is to make it work. That would save like 2 beats maybe?  Re-routing is definitely a possibility though. In 1-1, I pass up a bomb, so if I took that, I'd have a bomb for Coral Riff. Thanks for asking that question or I wouldn't have thought of making that change! It should save some time but I don't know how much.  Edit: I made this edit and it turns out to save ~1.86s by my calculation, although the in-game timer (IGT) says ~1.63s, which I'm willing to chalk up to IGT inconsistency. Turns out that the bomb strat only saves 10 beats on the Coral Riff fight, and it costs 2 extra beats to grab the extra bomb on 1-1, so that's why it doesn't save more."

necrodancer,3dw7z6,wilarseny,4,Mon Jul 20 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm going to say this is legitimately good advice. Your DPB (dmg per beat) of a broadsword is always greater than a longsword or spear (if not thrown effectively). Hitting 3 squares at once is really strong. Plus bats become way less scary, and they are one of the most hated enemies in the game."
necrodancer,3dw7z6,DogTheMountieHunter,6,Mon Jul 20 14:20:43 2015 UTC,"That's predicated on always hitting three enemies every time, though, and higher (theoretical) damage per beat doesn't necessarily mean better.

necrodancer,3dw7z6,Pinkie_Pi,4,Mon Jul 20 04:59:10 2015 UTC,"When doing a score run, getting the Nazar Charm is bad because it means slightly fewer enemies spawn per floor, so less gold from kills.  I think. That's definitely the reasoning, but I don't know if the Wraiths/et al are replaced with other monsters on floor generation."
necrodancer,3dw7z6,anace,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"That's right. The Nazar Charm stops wraith type enemies from spawning, and doesn't replace them with anything, so you lose out on the gold all future wraiths might have dropped."

If you burn a beat after hitting the boss you can hit it again for extra damage, but this is an advanced risky strategy that is only useful for speedruns."

If you pick up the Shopkeeper's Crown as Monk, the enemies will stop dropping gold, making runs easier."
necrodancer,3dtp3k,kiraki,7,Sun Jul 19 10:37:56 2015 UTC,That's a really long yawn.  Is the original version in game real vocals or did DannyB synthesize it?

necrodancer,3dvz6k,kkamikami,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Possible, but what I'm saying is you saw becoming in a purple chest while pinkie got his in a 4-1 barrel. It's the same seed, of course, but because of differences in when you kill shopkeep, what shrines you take, etc, you may just straight-up not see some items another person saw (because they're later in the list) or you may get others earlier/in more convenient times. Sorry if I was unclear.  We've run seeded score tourneys where we can see this pretty drastically (though it's improved a bit since) - taking shrine of space in particular can really mess things up in terms of later zones' shrine spawns, etc. It's actually a pretty big problem when you're trying to do an apples-to-apples comparison of score runs."
necrodancer,3dvz6k,wilarseny,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:40 2015 UTC,"oh, you're right! what you said about the shrine of space never occurred to me. seems like there is a lot to consider while playing this game. thanks for the tip!"

necrodancer,3dse8q,batman9502,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:41 2015 UTC,You have so many bombs why not just bomb twice and stab?
necrodancer,3dse8q,Gingeneer1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"The Food Shopkeeper has 1HP, but drops a bomb on you when he dies, bombing him makes a bomb drop on the Gluttony Charm that comes from him when he dies, which renders the kill redundant given the food is necessary to get some of that sweet HP"
necrodancer,3dse8q,Shadekitty,2,Sun Jul 19 01:09:16 2015 UTC,"This is not entirely accurate, though you are correct that you can't bomb him if you're wearing a Blast Helmet! The shopkeeper can be bombed, providing you do not have a blast helmet. Once you put down a bomb, if you move up towards the corner, the bomb will appear there instead of on the gluttony charm.  A detailed explanation for any that don't know about it:   1)  Put the bomb to the direct right or left of the shopkeeper.  2) Move up two spaces.  3) Move towards whichever corner you are closer to (Left if you put the bomb left, right if right.)  4) The bomb appears in the corner.  5) Move back towards the center while it explodes.  I frequently bomb the food shopkeep in my runs."

necrodancer,3dsl61,pretzeltwists,8,Sun Jul 19 01:31:24 2015 UTC,The only issue I see with this character is how aaaaagonizingly sloooow it would beeee.  It would take around 30-40 minutes to complete a run at that rate. I think it would be a very frustrating experience.
necrodancer,3dsl61,Shadekitty,2,Sun Jul 19 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm, in that case, what if it was a pair of beats with one inbetween each beat? For example:  Normal: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  Minim:  |  |  -  |  |  -  |  |  -  |  |"
necrodancer,3dsl61,Shadekitty,2,Sun Jul 19 10:18:20 2015 UTC,"That would be better than all half beats, at the very least. I don't know if that's enough of a distinguishing set of features to really warrant having her as a separate character, though. How would this change someone's playstyle to accommodate it?"
necrodancer,3dsl61,Shadekitty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:45 2015 UTC,"I feel the con would be the stumble feature, as if you don't adapt to the beat pairs, you could either put yourself in extreme danger or die altogether, so they'd have to adapt their beats to be in pairs rather than a constant or double flow"
necrodancer,3dsl61,neon_saturnina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:29:30 2015 UTC,That's true! It almost reminds me of a Waltz beat since it comes in a natural three. Maybe make it | | | - | | | - to be a little less difficult to work with in 4/4 time?
necrodancer,3dsl61,Paradigmist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a better idea, yeah, I can see how 2/3 would make it really irregular to the music  Now to try putting this together :P"

necrodancer,3dsl61,Paradigmist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:45 2015 UTC,The way this character is interesting is that enemies move at their regular speeds. That would make it interesting and REQUIRE that you dig buffer constantly to match up with enemies. I'm not sure if any enemies become impossible like this. Some enemies will move strangely as they move based on the player's actions (goblins for an example). But it sounds like the best way to make this kind of character engaging.  Very cool idea overall!

It also very much depends on if you're aiming to get good at speedrunning, score, racing, clearing challenges or just chilling out. There's lots and lots of content in the game - and it's not going anywhere!"
necrodancer,3dsh70,Fubzo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:24:41 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a good pace. Probably the best way to improve your pace in my opinion is just stick to cadence racing and tryout for tournaments.
necrodancer,3dsh70,Shadekitty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:24:55 2015 UTC,"I've found the opposite to be true, at least in my case.  I've found that my best times have been set directly after playing harder characters. Going from Aria or Bolt back to Cadence removes heavy limitations and allows me to go much faster.

necrodancer,3dp433,Shadekitty,2,Sat Jul 18 03:30:19 2015 UTC,"exactly... you'd still have a buffer zone when you could make a move, but you'd have a little more wiggle room to make a move, all while the dungeon moves precisely on every beat."
necrodancer,3dp433,spiral527,2,Sat Jul 18 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"So I guess with this in theory you could attack an enemy twice without them making one move by going late on the first attack and early on the next, but that's difficult and also requires more planning and stuff."

necrodancer,3dm90p,Teraka,2,Fri Jul 17 14:48:54 2015 UTC,Level editor isn't unlocked by default. You have to beat zone 4 with Cadence which they can't do. They want to know if they can cheat the game files to unlock it without beating zone 4.
necrodancer,3dm90p,Ciretako,3,Fri Jul 17 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, didn't realize the level editor had to be unlocked.

Squega in pre-launch held two of the three fastest Cadence times ever posted in CoNDOR. Paratroopa took 3rd in the second score tourney. I didn't realize how badly we've been screwing CanadianBac0nz with seeding. He lost in Season 1 to the eventual champ (DJC), in Season 2 to the 4th-place TOC finisher (Ognos), and then was in the group of death in the launch tourney (Ognos/Spooty/Sage). Uhh. Sorry man. :("

necrodancer,3dk41f,wilarseny,2,Thu Jul 16 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"Hi, here's a question. Is there going to be any sort of division system?  The reason I ask is, let's imagine what happens the first couple weeks with a single division with swiss format. First week, everybody with 0 points will be facing off. That means there could easily be racers who average 8 minutes facing racers who average 15 minutes, for example. Not very interesting for either participant. The second week could be nearly as imbalanced, as the possible point values are still only 0-3. Like let's say an 12 minute racer faces a 15 minute racer in the first week and wins all 3, but then faces an 8 minutes racer in the next week; still not a close matchup.  So my concern is that it may take until the third week or longer to converge to competitive matches, with a single division. This is potentially discouraging to new racers and they may be tempted to drop from the league before the matchups have adjusted appropriately.  I don't know how leagues/tournaments usually fix this issue. I think I've seen systems where there is a top division and a qualifier division, where you start in the qualifier division and if you do well enough, next season you are promoted to the top division (and the bottom performers from the top division fall back to the qualifier division)."
necrodancer,3dk41f,masharpe,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"Hey blimp,  I think that's a super important question and just sent an email to the rest of the CoNDOR staff about it. I personally don't want to do hard divisions for a couple reasons: I don't want a surprise contender a la Spooty to get shut out of competing against top guys, and I don't think it's going to be a big enough sample in 8 weeks to really make a promotion/relegation-type system work. It also sort of defeats the purpose of running a ladder-style tournament, IMO. If we just want to run condor and conduit at the same time over a couple months, that's a different tourney.  So my leaning is toward seeding racers (either by consensus or PB or something) and generating matchups based on that. I'm not sure how exactly it'll work. Either we can match top seed vs bottom seed and fill out that way or we can do 1v2, 3v4, etc. The first probably converges to accurate results faster but at the cost of bad/boring/uneven matches the first couple weeks. The second option would have great matches at first but maybe some inequitable results after a couple weeks (eg, if we overestimate a racer's skill and they lose a couple even matchups right off the bat, they're stuck w/ 0 points after two weeks and probably SOL for the tourney). I'd be curious what racers would prefer."
necrodancer,3dk41f,masharpe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:50 2015 UTC,"Fiddling with the seeding is kinda problematic for the final rankings yeah. It doesn't seem fair to punish racers for having a track record of high performance (since that's what would determine the seeding, I guess).  Like you say, it's tricky to create different divisions without hurting ""dark horse"" contenders. Having an objective test for admission might help. A couple ideas:   Multiple conditions, any one of which allows entry into the top division. For example, Cadence PB, NecroLab rank, or SRL rank. Qualifier event of some sort. Maybe a hard idea to pull off. But let's say if SRL is being used, could have a few times during the first week when people can go on and race in HUGE multi-way races. Then assign people to divisions according to the times they got. This is a little more accurate than just looking at PB since it accounts for consistency. But that said, I doubt the results will be all that much different than PB, so maybe it's not worth the effort.   On top of the objective test, racers could be allowed to self-select themselves to the top division if they think they would be competitive there. After all, the main purpose of having multiple divisions is to improve racer enjoyment."
necrodancer,3dmhka,cretintroglodyte,2,Fri Jul 17 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"For custom playlists:   On Windows, when the file manager dialogue pops up, just select multiple songs by Ctrl-clicking on them.

necrodancer,3dgr33,Esplen,3,Thu Jul 16 10:59:13 2015 UTC,"Not taking the torch would have required memorizing the wall layouts for the entirety of zone 4, which I'm guessing he didn't feel like doing since he got the sub-2 anyway."
necrodancer,3dgr33,Spootaloo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:49:24 2015 UTC,"Valid points for future time saves. In general, definitely there is significant improvement available simply by being run by someone who is better at Bolt, since I'm not very good at Bolt speed (unlike SpootyBiscuit).  The reason I didn't take the torch is that if you don't, you're basically running zone 4 blindfolded. That would be possible with focused practice, but because I don't know any way to reset right to the beginning of zone 4, every zone 4 practice run requires clearing through the first three zones, which takes a while. I only get passable execution on zone 4 because it's the easiest zone for this seed.  I was originally planning to practice with torch until I needed the 3.87s save to go sub-2, then stop taking the torch, but since I got sub-2 anyway (and with 3-2 bat RNG better than I've seen before), I decided to stop at that point.  Hitting every beat makes a surprisingly big difference, yeah. Unfortunately it's pretty hard to hit the first beat of the song consistently, or at least I don't know a way to do it apart from remembering exactly how long the load time is. In my effort to hit the first beats, I also make some dumb mistakes involving going the wrong way initially (like on 2-2, 3-3, 3-4, 4-4) or missing beats early because of not catching the rhythm (3-3, 4-2, 4-3). The FailFish is that I had boss intros off because I forgot they would pause the speedrun timer, so simply turning boss intros on would help a lot with catching the first beats on the bosses."
necrodancer,3dgr33,Esplen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking if someone got a good seed for Bard, it would be easy to make a script that would run it extremely fast. I guess it could work for Bolt too, but you'd need enough RAM to have very little FPS variation (with Bard you can just input commands as fast as the game can take them which is something you'd have to tweak)."
necrodancer,3dgr33,Esplen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"Non-seed-determined RNG (bats, boss teleports) is the problem for doing a TAS, so either the script would need to be a little bit reactive, or you'd have to find a seed where the % chance to work is high enough that you can just keep doing runs until you get the correct RNG.  Bard TAS would be kinda weird since it's effectively 0s if you can get it to work, since there's no upper limit on how fast you can go (except computer speed of course). Seeded Bolt I think is a pretty nice seeded category, because it's too fast to make optimal use of every beat in a blind run, but you're still doing beat minimization."

necrodancer,3dbwhb,AustinTP,8,Wed Jul 15 01:52:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you're missing more just playing only Bard instead of say, Cadence, than you are for not being able to play every character. I can understand being bad at keeping with the beat. But it is incredibly worth practicing for. I mean it is the main gameplay mechanic. Give it a shot before you go asking for a mod. It wouldn't be a proper experience for half the characters anyway.  Besides, until you reach Aria missing the beat is only a very minor setback in the long run.

necrodancer,3d2joc,Gloore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"I feel that Coda would be about deception and pure concentration, seeing as he/she is very similiar to goblins in Zone 3. You know, sending clones and dummies against you, while he's sneaking behind you.   Aria could act differently, when missing a beat. Whether it's damaging you like Shrine of Rhythn does, charging at you with something powerful, etc.  I'd love to see a fight with Evil Bard like some kind of bardic showdown. Like, fight to kill more enemies than him. Or kill enemies quicker than him. Anything works probably.  I imagine Evil Dorian chasing you after attacking him, but without Boots of Leaping turned on, so he would take half of a heart each beat. After two-three beats, he would run away again, only to get chased by the player.  Either way, it's a neat idea that I'd like to see in the game. Be it by the mod or DLC, I don't care."

If I'm just playing for fun, I'd rather have an obsidian or titanium bow than anything. After that longsword, then spear probably. If I'm playing for score, switch that for gold ones of course.   If I'm speedrunning I'd rather have a blood or titanium cat probably (because I'll be breaking combo somewhat often in a speedrun, both intentionally and not lol). Then rapier. After that maybe a good dagger? In speedruns I usually want a precise weapon, so that I can move regardless of how enemies are positioned around me. I don't speedrun Cadence much at all though.  As modifiers go, for score I'd take gold > obsidian > titanium > blood > base > glass (I cannot be trusted with glass...). For speed I'd take blood > titanium > obsidian > gold > base > glass. This is because on speed you need to do a lot more high-risk stuff, so the heals are nice, and you're maybe breaking combo a fair bit, so titanium is more reliable."
necrodancer,3cyh6x,WinterShine,3,Sat Jul 11 23:43:54 2015 UTC,I actually prefer the dagger in a lot of ways.  I get lazy and stop paying attention to enemy move patterns as much when I have a better weapon.

necrodancer,3cyh6x,Regal_Elkstone,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:53:16 2015 UTC,I find it risky in zones 3-4. With the huge range you can often get stuck on a bad tile (ooze or coal) when you just want to move.

It's quick, deals good damage doesn't tend to screw me up when I try to go one tile above and there's an enemy two tiles away from me.  Golden Lute - It's just too fun! Jumping around dealing damage can never get boring. Of course, I sometimes get stuck in enemies and get killed but otherwise, it's amazing. Cat - Comes with great mobility and targeting mechanism I don't understand. And gives a nice feeling when you do Red Dragon dance.  Spear - I like the ability to throw a weapon more useful than being able to attack two tiles at the same time.  Longsword - Two tiles range. It's good. Dagger - It's the basic weapon and pretty decent.  Rifle - I don't use it often, mostly because of reloads. I like it's range though. Bow - I prefer to stay in close combat rather than shoor arrows from distance. Tends to screw me when I try to move. Broadsword - Ugh. Though it's range is good I often forget about it and get hit because of it. Also, I don't really like weapons like that. Whip - I used to like it, but now I see it's flaws. It has bigger range than broadsword, but it's only single target. Blunderbuss - Meh. Crossbow - Don't like it. It has more range than bow and is piercing but isn't worth it often. Flail - OH GOD NO   Materials:   Titanium - It's most reliable from all. It has decent damage, doesn't break. Obsidian - When I don't miss a lot of beats I really like to use them. Worse part is when I forget about losing a beat then die horribly because of that lower damage. Glass - I love it and hate it at the same time. Especially on Aria. If I don't play Aria, I mostly take Rapier, Spear or Cat.  Blood - It's good for sustaining full health but I like to have more damage, really. Gold - For score runs and daily it's my go to material. If it isn't any of them, then I usually skip it if I have something that isn't normal weapon.   If I play Monk, I prefer to take 2 range and more weapons just for that extra tile away from gold. It really saved me a lot of times.  When I have Ring of Courage, I wish for a Cat for those sweet slides or Rapier for quick lunges. Ring of War is fantastic with Rapier - infinite lunges are awesome."

Broadsword is beneath whip because even though the whip's greater attack area means you can get caught more easily, there are many enemies that can attack you from broadsword range, and only one enemy in the entire game that can attack you from the L spot of the whip's range. And for a cautious and unskilled player like myself, getting to zone 3+ without appropriate footwear is bad news anyway, regardless of weapon."

necrodancer,3cry2f,NecroHeather,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:49:48 2015 UTC,Sad thing is that Necrodancer would be ideal for 3DS as all it needs is the 4 lettered buttons. Having the second screen as a map would be great.

necrodancer,3ck0aw,mynameismunka,6,Thu Jul 9 18:54:35 2015 UTC,Here now! Yup this has been posted and discussed on the NecroDancer forums. Weird bug!
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Teraka,3,Wed Jul 8 17:25:38 2015 UTC,"There aren't many players that run low%, right? I mean, it's certainly a interesting category to run for sure with good chances for WR, lol. Also, you had a nice run (Any Bolt runs that do good are nice to me, I can't really play her), kinda sad it ended on King Konga.  What programs you used for recording and converting the video? I tried using Fraps, but after converting the sound was way off, so I'm curious."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Gloore,5,Wed Jul 8 18:17:25 2015 UTC,"There are very few people who run low% yeah, there's no reward for that (except an achievement for Aria and one for All Chars), and it's hard enough that not that many people can even seriously attempt it.   As far as I know, I'm the only person running Bolt low%, I know  that SpootyBiscuit and EladDifficult both have the goal of doing All Chars low%, but I don't think either have started to practice Bolt yet.  I use OBS for recording, it's intended for streaming but the recording function works beautifully, it has lots of options, and it's free. For converting, I use Shotcut because it's also free, but it's not that great, it just does the job decently."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Lancer873,3,Wed Jul 8 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"I'm working on Bolt Low% alongside Monk Low% right now, but I need a lot more work on Bolt. I think I've made it to zone 3 a few times, haven't really done much of zone 4. It's super fun, though."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Shadekitty,3,Thu Jul 9 00:13:02 2015 UTC,"I'm doing Bolt Low% and intend to do All Chars low% after I finish (if I finish) Coda.  Making it pretty regularly to 3-3, with the occasional Zone 4-1 or 4-2 death.  It definitely makes for fun and exciting runs! I wish it had more prominence in the community or its own leaderboard."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Gloore,2,Thu Jul 9 14:49:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm trying to run low% Melody with quite disappointing results for me. I got like 5-ish minutes on leaving Zone 3 then dying horribly because of Blademasters or Pixies. Or the game gives me Luminous Torch in the first chest and trapdoor near it. That torch laughs at me when I think if I should still do low%.   I at least have one competitor, though! /u/pretzeltwists published his run and it's my motivation to compete with him. And to finally beat that low%.  Thanks a lot for those programs! It'll probably help me a ton."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,pretzeltwists,3,Wed Jul 8 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"Competition accepted :3  Currently I'm working on Low%ing Dorian, I just need to figure his Boots of Leaping out as you can use it to beat buffer :P"
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Lancer873,3,Wed Jul 8 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"I honestly found it better to just drop beats rather than use the boots of leaping to buffer, less worry about having to move while the boots are down that way, and it's good practice for other low%'s where beatdrops are also important.  If you're curious, here's a VoD of my completed Dorian Low% run."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,masharpe,2,Thu Jul 9 09:17:39 2015 UTC,"I'm learning Bolt low% but obviously it's very hard. (My twitch handle is blueblimpsc.) My current goal is going for a 3 zone clear, since I've had 2 zone no damage runs and single-zone-mode zone 3 no damage clears, so theoretically I can do it.  Zone 4 is VERY HARD though, especially 4-3. Also any Death Metal, maybe DM2 a little less.  Edit: Though the reason I'm trying Bolt low% vs say Coda is that it's way way easier than Coda, so I think any runner who can clear Coda Death Metal (djc, spooty, dunno if there are others) should be able to clear Bolt low% without too much difficulty."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Shadekitty,4,Wed Jul 8 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really just comes down to being consistent enough to not take more than a hit or two.  I think zone 3 is definitely one of the harder areas. So much risk of being run down if you get a couple knights coming from different directions. I do not look forward to 4-3 when I get there. :c  DM 1 and 2 aren't too bad. Now that I don't have much trouble with the beat I actually prefer 1 over 2 because it's easier to get all the ghosts out of the way. 3 is a nightmare, with 4 as a close second."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,DogTheMountieHunter,3,Thu Jul 9 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"Death Metal is actually not that difficult once you've got the tempo down. You just have to kill the adds first (only poses a problem for DM3), and then rush him as fast as possible. Regardless of which DM it is, 2/3rds of the time you can get him to 2 health before he spawns any more adds, or maybe 1-2 at most, which you can take care of calmly once he's just spamming fireballs.  4-3 really is a nightmare though. Goes almost as fast as DM, and there's complex, high-health enemies everywhere. This run was the first time I reached it, and first time I beat it, and even though I got really lucky rooms, it was still dodgy as fuck."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Lancer873,2,Wed Jul 8 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll get around to low% but I think I might try to finish all the characters on Dancepad. Only Aria and Bolt to go."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,velkito,3,Fri Jul 10 05:18:24 2015 UTC,Low% is starting to grow a bit in popularity. Or maybe I'm just noticing it more since I was one of the early adopters of the category. Lots of people pulling off Melody low% and a couple people stuck on Monk low%. I haven't seen many people do Bolt Low% though.
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Lancer873,3,Thu Jul 9 00:14:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll try monk/eli/melody low %. I can't beat bolt non-low even since I can't coordinate/reconciliate the double rhythm with the non-doubled music, so no point trying an all-char run"
necrodancer,3ckmq4,velkito,5,Thu Jul 9 08:12:57 2015 UTC,"Eli and Melody are great ones to try the format out with. Monk Low% is honestly probably the hardest low% (Yes, harder than Aria, and arguably harder than Bolt)  Bolt's hard, but I'm of the opinion that what makes Bolt Low% hard is more the Bolt and less of the Low%. I bet that if someone really experienced with Doubletime Necrodancer like Spooty or DJC were to take on Bolt low%, they'd have it done within the day.   no point trying an all-char run   Gonna be honest, nobody is anywhere near ready to try that yet. I've yet to hear news of anyone completing all the individual low% runs yet, much less chaining multiples together. I honestly doubt anyone will manage to complete one, and I say that as one of the most likely candidates at the moment."
necrodancer,3ckmq4,Shadekitty,3,Thu Jul 9 09:05:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never enjoyed monk runs, until I got one done, maybe I underestimate them, still, I'll try eli and melody.   Do you have any advice for bolt regular runs, short of looking for ways to somehow double up the music speed without additionally increasing the rhythm, so they are actually in sync..like with all the other characters? >.<"
necrodancer,3ckmq4,double_shadow,6,Thu Jul 9 11:22:46 2015 UTC,"Big Bolt player here. When I started learning the beat I would tap my index finger to the cadence beat, and then add in the middle finger on the half beat. I'd hop back and forth 8 or 9 times until I felt that I was consistently getting it, and then start moving through the level.  Don't be afraid to take a few seconds to get the beat back if you start dropping it here and there. Don't be afraid to just move as Cadence and let everything else move at double speed for a little bit either, if that's what it takes. If you find as you improve that particular tracks are giving you trouble keeping the beat, maybe try practicing them in single zone mode (2-3 and 3-2 were big offenders of this for me).  Focusing on ranged weapons and damage means that you won't have to do complicated or precisely timed movements as much against enemies like Shield Skeletons or the dragons. Focus titanium over Glass or Obsidian until you feel comfortable holding the beat.  I think those were probably the major focuses I had getting Bolt to a comfortable level."

necrodancer,3cbe34,Gloore,2,Mon Jul 6 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"Low% happens, when player picks up no items (except gold). It's simply a bare minimum needed to beat the game. So you only have your starting weapon, shovel, bomb and 3/2/half a heart for a whole run."
necrodancer,3cbe34,Sporeman58,2,Mon Jul 6 20:27:01 2015 UTC,Thanks!
necrodancer,3cbe34,Gloore,2,Mon Jul 6 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"Melody's probably one of the easiest characters to make low% (with Monk being the hardest, imo), but that is still a great achivement. Especially making it with half of a heart in Zone 4. It's not that hard to get hit on Necrodancer fight, at least for me.  Though it's really easy to become cornered and overwhelmed by enemies in Zone 3. Probably the worst part in all runs.  Anyways, good work!"
necrodancer,3cbe34,Da_boy1,3,Mon Jul 6 20:47:58 2015 UTC,Monk low% harder than Coda low% huh? =P
necrodancer,3cbe34,Gloore,2,Tue Jul 7 07:12:39 2015 UTC,"Haha, you got me! But still, nobody is insane enough to try Coda low% (not to mention, Coda still hasn't been beaten as far as I know), so I just don't mention it."
necrodancer,3cbe34,Nightstroll,2,Tue Jul 7 07:39:23 2015 UTC,"What about Aria?  Aside from bosses who can make it impossible to reach the exit because of the gold spawned by their minions, I don't think Monk's that hard."
necrodancer,3cbe34,Gloore,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:12:29 2015 UTC,"For me, Monk is harder for few reasons. One of them is that he can't pick up gold. One wrong move, one pull from skeleton mage into a stack of gold, confusion or ice can screw you over so much. Crowd control is just so much more dangerous on Monk than Aria.  Blood Shovel, while useful, can only be used three times. It's good, but without a way to replenish your health it can bring you down to dangerous level of health. While Aria has only half of a heart, she has a potion and doesn't need to worry about avoiding gold.   And Ooze Golems. My god, screw them so much. They limit the amount of tiles you can step on, as you don't have any boots. It's tedious, annoying and can make it really hard.   You can't miss a beat as Aria, but for me, it's much more easier than having to avoid gold. Less things can screw you up and not having to deal with Ooze Golems makes it more enjoyable.   And yes, you can cheese through the game by just waiting for the song to end, but it's really lame and not rewarding."
necrodancer,3cbe34,QueenMeteor,2,Tue Jul 7 09:56:02 2015 UTC,"For me, I actually prefer not taking most items as Monk.  If I have increased damage of any kind, any other type of weapon, or, god forbid, the Ring of Courage, I will at some point have a minor lapse in concentration that makes me do something stupid and hit money that I wouldn't have hit otherwise.  Even items that negate ice and traps can mess me up, because every single thing that makes the game not function how I subconsciously expect it to brings another lapse in concentration that leads to my death.  For me, a low% run would mostly be just not taking bombs and health  This is why I can't get past zone 3 as him I guess  ...also, is Blood Shovel + Miner's Cap supposed to hurt you while walking around in the shop?"
necrodancer,3cbe34,Gloore,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:51:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some items can screw you up badly as a Monk. Though 2-range weapons are probably more useful than daggers, just because you have that one tile just for sure. (then you get killed, because you attacked instead of moving. Can't have everything, sadly). I can't say much about bows and crossbows. I mostly avoid them because they get me confused more.  Damage ups aren't that bad, as they help you kill enemies more quickly, without moving much. Having spear or longsword helps a lot, when you don't realise the kill instanly. It saved me a few times at least. I'm not a quick person.  Bombs are probably the biggest live savers when playing as Monk. They deal 4 hearts of damage, destroy gold and walls. Good alternative, when health is more important.   Having a ton of bombs and a good torch with Ring of Phasing helps a lot with not stepping on gold. Or you can go with tanky build and slowly plow through enemies.   If you have problems with beating some levels, you can always wait out the song. It's lame, but it works.  And yes, Blood Shovel with Miner's Cap hurt you when you approach walls you can't dig normally. Cap just makes you dig walls adjacent to your character. And it gives you +1 to dig, so you can't break rocky walls without damaging yourself. (I miss old Miner's Cap, though. It worked like Ring of Courage, except on walls.)"
necrodancer,3cbe34,QueenMeteor,2,Tue Jul 7 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"Something that's been happening a lot in zone 3 for me is that I get a damage up, and I go to kill a Shovemonster and it almost pushes me into gold so I panic and instinctively hit it twice  and by 'hit it twice' I mean oneshot it and kill myself"
necrodancer,3cbe34,Gloore,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"Haha, that happened to me a lot (Shovemonsters are assholes). One thing that could help is enabling ""Show enemy health"" (or something like that). Helps to remember the health and not overshooting with more damage."

Bolt could give extra mana crystals while in play. (Increasing ""tempo"")  Coda: 9 attack, 1 life. At the end of your turn, Coda takes 1 damage (he does not have Charge).

""Whenever this minion attacks or is attacked, it deals its damage first"" is more of a MTG concept, which I'm not sure would translate well to Hearthstone.  I really like the theme of characters that can't attack, since the few ""non-attacking"" cards that exist in the game (primarily Ancient Watcher) have some really unique synergies.  Naturally, many of these cards would need heavy balancing, but I like the concepts and the complexity of the cards, and of the set as a whole. Also, ""100% chance to attack the wrong enemy"" got a chuckle out of me."

""Whenever this minion attacks or is attacked, it deals its damage first"" is more of a MTG concept, which I'm not sure would translate well to Hearthstone.

necrodancer,3boy4m,D3WR1T05,2,Tue Jun 30 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that the Heal spell works on Dorian, but I could be wrong. Besides, Dorian has rather beefy defence (1.5 right out, iirc) - so he shouldn't be taking too much damage.  My tip for the latter half of the fight is to get into ""formation"". I always try to keep Dorian as close to Cadence as possible. The further apart they are, the more confused I get and the greater chance I have of losing the fight. I usually have then both on tiles right beside eachother. Sure, it takes a bit longer to beat the NecroDancer like this, but I'm no speedrunner and I've found this is one of the safest ways to take him down.  Additionally, if you ARE using this tactic, don't approach the NecroDancer from Dorian's side. Make sure he teleports to Cadence's side before you run in for the hit. You'll probably spend some time waiting for him to teleport into a position which puts himself at a disadvantage, but while Cadence and Dorian are together, they sort of ""protect"" eachother in a way - as an attack that may have normally hit Dorian would have completely been sent off-track as Cadence was in the way, with her lute."
necrodancer,3boy4m,NeonJ82,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:43:43 2015 UTC,"Food, heal spell, and potions only work on cadence for the necrodancer fight. pretty sure the only way to heal dorian is if he's equipped with a blood weapon."
necrodancer,3boy4m,brawlin_bert,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:26:34 2015 UTC,"The quick kill is to use 3 bombs or a blood shovel to just blast your way through the stage to get the Lute instead of messing around with the switches.   (And try to get Dorian to go sit in a corner)  The extra nice part about that you tend to deal with many fewer enemies spawning so you mostly just have to make sure Doran doesn't get blown up by the necrodancer's tele-bomb.  Bomb 1: Bomb the middle of the stage (the center baby mummy).  If you have a 4th (extra) bomb, drop it immediately after cause it will kill the baby mummies and you don't have to deal with them.  Bomb 2 just blasts more of the stage away,  Bomb 3 releases both the lute and the necrodancer.  Grab the lute and go to town.  Also, if you have 1 bomb and a ring of phasing, you can just walk into the stage and grab the lute, then bomb next to the necrodancer."
necrodancer,3boy4m,sylverfyre,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:47:27 2015 UTC,"Dorian can't be healed. Maybe blood weapon could heal him but that is like 1/2 heart at most during whole fight so I wouldn't count on that. Dorian is quite tanky(1.5 def, 4 hearts) so just worry about red dragon snipe and dark minotaur.  Blood shovel, Obsidian/Glass shovel/Pickaxe + Gigantism scroll would break the stage as the stage has level 4 hardness(shop wall). It would cost 1 heart to completely expose the Necrodancer and Golden lute. Glass shovel without Gigantism would break 1 tile and break the shovel. 3 bombs works too.  Boots of leaping/lunging makes phase 2 trivial as you move faster than the Necrodancer with it. Be careful with them though as Dorian will desynchronize with Cadence and can get hit."

I've noticed this with the shovels, but not with armor before.  Edit: Well, I just read the wiki on Equipment and it says   Picking up armor with higher rating overwrites the lower one. Picking up Karate Gi, Glass Armor or Obsidian Armor drops the current equipped armor piece.   Must have missed that when I was looking at it earlier, sorry! Now I feel like a dingle. Woops."
necrodancer,3blad5,implosion5,6,Tue Jun 30 04:05:02 2015 UTC,"I believe it only happens with leather/chainmail/plate/heavy, with the weaker of the two being absorbed. Obsidian isn't in the chain, so it isn't considered strictly better or worse. Same with glass armor and the karate gi."
necrodancer,3blad5,Teraka,3,Tue Jun 30 04:09:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Obsidian can be worse than Chainmail if you lose the beat a lot, or get hit multiple times in a row, so it doesn't automatically replace it. But Chainmail can never be worse than Leather, so it absorbs it."

necrodancer,3bhzfm,Gloore,11,Mon Jun 29 11:21:21 2015 UTC,"Cool, I've never seen this strat used before.  The reason why the two left tiles don't work is actually pretty simple: King Konga gets blown up before his throne does. When Konga is blown up there's a check to see if his throne still exists. If it does, he gets teleported back on (and immediately after to a random location because the throne gets blasted too). If it doesn't he takes damage instead (and gets teleported away if he survives (Z4)).  The reason for the two different outcomes is technical. The 9 tiles in the explosion are processed top-to-bottom and left-to-right (explicitly stated, the sequence is top-left, middle-left, bottom-left, top-center, middle-center, bottom-center, top-right, middle-right, bottom-right). And the two left tiles come before the throne tile, since they are lower column.  A minor point to take note of is that the deciding factor is not the position of the bomb, but the position of Konga at the moment of the explosion. You can still perform this kill with the bomb on the lower left tile, but in order to do so you must miss the beat before placing the bomb (tanking a hit) and moving right and down."
necrodancer,3bhzfm,HigherFive,3,Mon Jun 29 12:54:46 2015 UTC,Why is the beat missing necessary?
necrodancer,3bhzfm,CheezyBob,4,Mon Jun 29 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"To make him jump off his throne for being pissed at you, which causes his throne and him to both be hit by the bomb."
necrodancer,3bhzfm,sylverfyre,3,Mon Jun 29 15:45:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly as sylverfyre said. If King Konga is in the throne tile, he will not take damage from the bomb."
necrodancer,3bhzfm,HigherFive,3,Mon Jun 29 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"The reason for the two different outcomes is technical. The 9 tiles in the explosion are processed top-to-bottom and left-to-right (explicitly stated, the sequence is top-left, middle-left, bottom-left, top-center, middle-center, bottom-center, top-right, middle-right, bottom-right). And the two left tiles come before the throne tile, since they are lower column.   Interesting. How'd you test this? Killing multiple enemies with one bomb and seeing which dropped higher multipliers of gold?  I wonder what the order for melody's attack is--can confirm that it's not the same top-to-bottom left-to-right order, as moving toward a goolem placed top-right will result in you getting goo and thus not attacking an enemy in bottom-middle. Same as the cat attack priority, maybe?"
necrodancer,3bhzfm,wilarseny,4,Mon Jun 29 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"The only testing I did was Konga 2 and Konga 4 in the Bossmaster rooms with Bard. But I would be greatly surprised if it turns out to not be true in some other case just because it matches the evidence exactly and in addition, when it comes to computer graphical systems, conventionally things like coordinate systems and square grids grow from the top-left corner.  As far as multi-tile weapons are concerned, going from memory and intuition (not having done explicit tests), it is indeed akin to the cat target choice algorithm. In one blanket statement, the sequence order is determined by the direction of the attack (or move). This has some interesting consequences with obsidian weapons where you may deal different amounts of damage depending solely on the positional order of the enemies in question. Stick some blue slimes in the level creator and check it out."
necrodancer,3bhzfm,HigherFive,3,Mon Jun 29 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"Obsidian weapons are really inconsistent when it comes to dealing damage from different positions (I'm talking about flails and broadswords in general). I've done some testing and it's really, really weird.  Here's the album with screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/U4UxO (While there aren't any desripctions, they should be in order, showing situation before the hit and after it.)  Whips attack first the target in front of you, then on the first left tile, then on the first right tile, then on second left tile and it ends on second right tile. They do that always, so no problem with them.  Obsidian Longswords deal more damage to the target behind your enemy, if you kill enemy in front of you. If you kill the guy behind, first one will take standard amount of damage. (Speaking of obsidian weapons, I assume that they're one kill away from powering up)  Flails and Broadswords are really wonky, it's hard to describe it, so that's why there are screenshots above.   Behaviour of weapons is really interesting topic."
necrodancer,3bhzfm,HigherFive,3,Tue Jun 30 06:35:16 2015 UTC,"After doing some testing myself, the orders are as follows:  Broadswords attack front-right, front-left, front. This surprised me as I was expecting the left-first rule present in cats and whips apply here as well.  Flails attack front-left, left, front-right, right, front (pic). This seems all over the place. The main reason for it probably is to simplify the implementation of the knockback."

As has been mentioned elsewhere in the thread, it's balanced by the loading time, recoil, and rarity.  I'll still take it 100% of the time I see it without exceptions, though.

necrodancer,3bby3x,fabuna,3,Sat Jun 27 21:03:26 2015 UTC,"It should constantly try and move backwards from where it was hit (so into the wall), I'm pretty sure."
necrodancer,3bby3x,IcebergGlaceon,2,Sat Jun 27 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"I think the bat chooses any available place to move (either into the player or directly above itself) then it reverses that direction because it is confused.

necrodancer,3b6dp2,SirDenn,2,Fri Jun 26 14:24:09 2015 UTC,Rapiers only double their own base damage so it would be 3 damage not 4.
necrodancer,3b6dp2,anace,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:55:56 2015 UTC,Oh wow so I was wrong on both counts. Just tested in the editor; rapiers double their base damage and war drum multiples weapon damage.

necrodancer,3b6dp2,nukedukem42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:21:05 2015 UTC,Rapiers do double damage when you attack from range. And blood weapons do max damage when you have 1/2 heart.

Serious advice, if I may be so bold: Never panic. You ARE the master of this game and it will bend to your will. Dance to the beat -- never move out of desperation. Desperation and panic WILL make you miss a beat. Bob your head to the beat, move on it, dance to the music; the pressure will slowly go away if you do that.  I could NOT beat Aria when I was all tense and trying super hard. I could only beat her when I sat back, relaxed, and trusted myself to make the right movements. That was the same way I learned the game initially too!"

It's always fair—kind of like Dark Souls, you don't ever die unless you deserve it. But at the same time, I think the game is a little too unforgiving. Not quite enough health pickups to help mitigate your mistakes, and some piling up of insane challenges (like Zone 4 + Dead Ringer + Necrodancer)."

necrodancer,3aty1y,velkito,11,Tue Jun 23 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"Two things about Aria's reversed zones from a gameplay, not story, perspective. I'm mainly expanding on what /u/Boolderdash said:  1.  and  2.  Despite all of this, Aria is still a harder character for having the reversed zones. Why did I actually type all of that? I really have no idea..."
necrodancer,3aty1y,Echaen,2,Tue Jun 23 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"You certainly can kit Aria out, its just harder. glass jaw doubles damage, Karate Gi doubles damage, damage ring (might, courage, war, or if youre real lucky wonder), damage boots, damage charms (strength and risk). If you manage to get them all your damage output is obscene.     ((weapon's base damage(1) × 2) + damage bonuses(1+1+1+2) × 2 = 14 total attack damage 16 if you have wonder ring.    get a frost charm and you can get hit once without dying, potion allows you to be hit or miss a beat without dying, glass armor lets you get hit without dying. you CAN get decked out, it's just not easy"
necrodancer,3aty1y,wes9523,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"Aria doesn't get Risk; her max damage is 10, 12 with Wonder. Strength charm is kinda rare too, so in practice it's an 8 damage cap, which doesn't make much difference though because 8 damage can one-shot all but one enemy.  Also, Crown of Teleportation and Ring of Shielding are hit-protection items as well, though they require skipping stitems to use."

necrodancer,3aty1y,Boolderdash,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:05:46 2015 UTC,It also makes the run more time efficient. You don't want to go through zones 1-3 time after time just to repeatedly die on zone 4. So the reverse order does double duty.

necrodancer,3aty1y,itsproy,3,Tue Jun 23 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"Err, is there a reason you're only playing on all zones mode?"
necrodancer,3aqiwk,thelabermachine,4,Mon Jun 22 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"You can also stab the body of the lute-dragon to have a similar result as using the bouncetraps (not moving, waiting for the head to be attackable again)"
necrodancer,3aqiwk,sylverfyre,3,Mon Jun 22 20:39:47 2015 UTC,I think this is the reason the boss level will give you explorer's boots at the begining if you happen to go in wearing the lead boots.
necrodancer,3aqiwk,Foxborn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it made me laugh when I realized that the final boss behaves like a cross between a red dragon and a red/black bat. How evil!  You can also tap its body to skip a beat, but be wary about its body's movement. Every eight beats it will move, and if you're in front if it you'll get stomped. Using this high-risk strategy you can kill the boss with no damage items in about 20 moves."
necrodancer,3aqiwk,thomar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"Damage items make no difference on the golden lute, the damage done is static, one for first hit 3(I think) for the second hit when it's dazed. I had a set up dealing 5-6 damage to normal mobs that dealt one to him."
necrodancer,3aqiwk,wes9523,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:25:53 2015 UTC,I find this to be pretty reliable as well.
necrodancer,3aqiwk,Pikafan8,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:41:25 2015 UTC,"Is the down-then-up movement near the end safer than buffering twice with the dagger? I know the red dragon can rarely mess with the quick kill, curious if this changes that any."
necrodancer,3aqiwk,WinterShine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:59:04 2015 UTC,Nah that's me fucking up. It might be safer though? I dunno. It looks stylish.
necrodancer,3aqiwk,Pikafan8,-1,Mon Jun 22 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"I have a similar but needlessly more difficult strategy that I use, because I never though of this and now I've perfected it >_<  What I do is:   Destroy skeleton spawners from right to left Hit the Lute Time it right and throw my dagger at it's face It crashes into the wall Retrieve le dagger Repeat   About 4/5 times the dragons get killed by the beams from the walls on my way to retrieve the dagger/on the way back, so that helps I guess."
necrodancer,3aoce6,purplemew,9,Mon Jun 22 04:11:08 2015 UTC,Reminds me of this guy.
necrodancer,3aoce6,Sonicrider3,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:02:53 2015 UTC,Damn that brought back memories
necrodancer,3aoce6,warrengbrn,7,Sun Jul 5 04:42:50 2015 UTC,"Original blog post can be found here!  Also, I'm aware that he's most likely wearing a monocle in his sprite, but I like to imagine he as a fancy loupe instead since he's looking at diamonds all day, haha~"
necrodancer,3aoce6,placeholdermusic,3,Mon Jun 22 04:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think you're spot on with the loupe, since the Diamond Dealer's pose has him examining the diamond. I've been misreading the sprite this whole time as a fancypants fox with a monocle, swirling a goblet of wine. Where I got wine from, I don't know, since there's no dark color there. Your interpretation makes ten times as much sense and is a sweet Bowie reference, to boot."
necrodancer,3aoce6,anace,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:45:30 2015 UTC,At least that makes sense. I was reading it as a big white thing on his nose.
necrodancer,3aoce6,KitsuneRagnell,6,Mon Jun 22 06:01:40 2015 UTC,That's not Snake
necrodancer,3aoce6,penguinland,5,Mon Jun 22 05:12:30 2015 UTC,"The diamond dogs are poachers, and they hide behind trees. Hunt you to the ground, they will.  Nice artwork!"
necrodancer,3aoce6,MushroomDynamo,3,Mon Jun 22 05:35:49 2015 UTC,"Am I seriously the only person who thought he was wearing a monocle and hefting (swirling?) a wineglass? Dude sure looks sophisticated enough for it, and he's sure as hell irrelevant enough to pass for idle rich."
necrodancer,3aoce6,TJourney,2,Tue Jun 23 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"No, this is my favorite Diamond Dog (EarthBound)"
necrodancer,3aoce6,NekkidSnaku,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:47:12 2015 UTC,I love you.
necrodancer,3aoce6,Charley_Wilson,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:23:15 2015 UTC,no no no THIS is the best diamond dog: http://metalarcade.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Metal-Gear-Solid-V-The-Phantom-Pain-Trailer-Screen-Snake-Bionic-Arm-Diamond-Dogs.jpg

necrodancer,3an01b,Kazenovagamer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:02:46 2015 UTC,and here I am with Aria and can barely even select the game on my Steam client.  I hate you.
necrodancer,3an01b,Sauceofspace,4,Sun Jun 28 03:20:19 2015 UTC,Damn that's so lucky. I actually got that in a run one day but at the time I had no idea what the ring of becoming was so I passed it up. Never had it since.
necrodancer,3an01b,Pizzoots,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"Jeez, why is the price so high?"

necrodancer,3amltj,Worms947,12,Sun Jun 21 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"It would have to be in Bard mode, right? Doesn't seem like it would work any other way."
necrodancer,3amltj,OptikalCrow,11,Sun Jun 21 21:05:22 2015 UTC,"If a corgi can play bard, chat can too!"

necrodancer,3amltj,brawlin_bert,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:21:03 2015 UTC,Why am I not surprised it's Elad? FailFish
necrodancer,3amltj,Echaen,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:42:36 2015 UTC,"That, and you'd have to mod the game so you can't exit it (from the stream's POV)."
necrodancer,3amltj,teamvista,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"Unless the chat was so populated that it ended up in a psuedo-""Democracy"" mode which has a ""vote"" every beat - where the key which got the most votes on a single beat gets the move.  But that's very doubtful to happen."
necrodancer,3amltj,NeonJ82,3,Tue Jun 23 00:51:23 2015 UTC,We need this
necrodancer,3amltj,VeryCheesyPotato,2,Sun Jun 21 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"Xelnas ran something like this for a while, but shut it down on Ryan's request. IIRC there were plans to do an official version, but I don't think anything ever happened with that.  Also, it was tough to make it be able to reset without letting it exit the game. Probably need to mod it."
necrodancer,3amltj,wilarseny,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:32:39 2015 UTC,Just block the escape key?  You can't exit without it.  There is no need for esc at all while playing normally.
necrodancer,3amltj,mynameismunka,2,Mon Jun 22 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"You can in the menu post-run. Basically either you need to let the chat use a bound reset key (which, uh, yea, bad idea) or let them access the full post-run menu, neither of which are things you really want to allow."
necrodancer,3amltj,wilarseny,5,Tue Jun 23 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"I actually think Crypt is more suited, as it's tile-based, simple controls (arrow keys), with (in Bard mode at least) enemies that only move when you do. TBOI has fluid motion, meaning it's harder for a computer to interpret updownleftleftupdown as anything other than wiggling around a bit, as well as the extra mechanic of shooting."
necrodancer,3anice,Gingeneer1,2,Sun Jun 21 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"1) It's not hard at all to keep the beat between ""beats""; and   Well, on a few songs that have a swing beat it can be pretty difficult because you can't hear the beat you're supposed to play to in the song"
necrodancer,3anice,Boingboingsplat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 2-1 and 2-2 trip me up constantly on Bolt. I have no idea if I'll be able to finish them on Coda."
necrodancer,3anice,Dparse,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:30:53 2015 UTC,Maybe play the song twice?
necrodancer,3anice,boh123321,3,Tue Jun 23 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good idea, but double speed music would be distorted and the level would be too short."
necrodancer,3anice,JackOfGames,2,Mon Jun 22 03:18:14 2015 UTC,There was a mod for this before release. It worked really well!
necrodancer,3anice,Echaen,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"I actually see what's being said here, I just disagree with the solution. When I'm playing Bolt, I find it very difficult to know when the beat between beats is, for example at the start of 1-2 (Crypteque) where there are triplets in the bass."
necrodancer,3alr0a,1-21Gigawatts,3,Sun Jun 21 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're anyone but Bard, when the boss intro is up the heart still beats, so maybe thats the problem"
necrodancer,3alr0a,Sauceofspace,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:50:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the beat bar is still going, but nothing/no-one will start moving until you close the boss intro.  If you have the crown of greed, your best bet is to pause the game instead of just sitting there like you could do with a speedrun or a normal run."
necrodancer,3alr0a,Nazenn,2,Sun Jun 21 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"Heather told me they were aware of the problem via steam so it should be something on the list to fix I hope, and the solution was to make the crown of green stop if the speedrun timer stops."
