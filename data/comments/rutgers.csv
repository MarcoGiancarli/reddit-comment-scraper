rutgers,3e2tol,Ehhhhthatscool,20,Tue Jul 21 15:03:32 2015 UTC,Another article rehashing the same report without enrollment numbers.  Listing aggregate amounts is really meaningless without knowing how many students that represents.  Average debt per student would have been much more meaningful.
rutgers,3e2tol,RustyBonz,8,Tue Jul 21 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Rutgers is a massive school, and with that, probably has a larger student population than most other public institutions.  As far as im concerned my tuition payments are quite low compared to my peers at other schools."

rutgers,3dx8jh,dabkilm2,13,Mon Jul 20 08:43:16 2015 UTC,"Ahhh gotta love being a freshman. To answer your question ""is it weird if you eat alone at any of the dining halls?"" No, not at all. You'll waste countless hours in the dining hall, especially brower. It's not feasible or worth your time to go out of your way to adjust your schedule to eat with people. In fact, I wouldn't suggest eating with the same friends you already know coming in.. Freshman and sophomore year is essentially high school 2.0. I'd honestly suggest trying to branch away from the comfort zone of your friends so you'll go meet new people because we all know that guy at Rutgers who's dependent and relies on his hs buddies to meet new people and isn't quite able to integrate out of hs socialLy. Go with people on your floor, go eat along and observe your surroundings and familiar faces that you'll eventually talk to.   Bottom line is eat with your boys early on, but slowly branch off and start doing you, go be independent, and develop your other friends on your own time. If you say your social, it shouldn't bother you to eat alone sometimes more times then not, you'll be eating alone so don't try to avoid it"
rutgers,3dx8jh,Growupfresh,5,Mon Jul 20 09:09:15 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly with the wasting time in dining halls statement. Some of my friends and I played a game of monopoly in Brower once. And I can't count how many times I've hung out and done work on my laptop in the DHs.

Imho it basically goes Athletes > Grad/Honors > In state > Out of state >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> transfers.    Lets be honest here, nothing is ever going to go perfect, and I'm getting the idea from some of the stuff in your post that you're trans and your parents dont accept you, (best of luck if thats true btw) but A: classes are already full from spring reregistration, B: incoming freshman will always have higher priority. C: there is a add drop period that everyone uses, not just you. I'm not being hard on you here, but theres tons of material on-line that lets you figure out courses and what will transfer before you come to Rutgers, because in all honesty you could have gone to a college that accepts your credits, otherwise you just wasted that 2 years of college.  Ok so on to what I'd do if I was in your situation, I would CALL (yes on the phone) the undergraduate offices for your major and explain what has happened. They'll accommodate you in some way, even if you might have to wait until later in august, its better than doing things before September. Mention whats happened, if you up-sell your bad experiences sympathy usually takes over and they'll try and do something lol.  Best of luck, and I'm glad to see a little introspection in your post, shows you got that adult mindset. Remember if worse comes to worse, you can just take the additional year with loans, apply for the FAFSA then, because you'll be a indipendnet and wont have to list your parents, thus more $$$$$.

Honestly, I'd go find somewhere else, or something else depending on what your major/future aspirations are. It's not going to get any better when you get here and New Brunswick is a shithole, especially in regards to the weather. The bureaucracy will piss you off even more, so I would take a long hard though about whether you're time and money would be better spent elsewhere.   I just got admitted into the business school this semester as a transfer, but with 2 semesters left, i'd be looking at 30k in debt which isnt bad, but I can't rationalize paying and staying in a place that is as shitty as this. Yeah, it'd be throwing away a good opportunity, but you have to factor in the REALITY of the situation.  Not to say I hated my time at Rut, but this past semester made me realize id be making a huge mistake of staying because I won't be happy here. Not a huge fan of the diversity (im white), and it's hard to clique with others because very few non-whites are approachable.  With all that said, all I'm going to say is if you're already this dissatisfied with Rutgers, I can almost guarantee you won't like it as you start to see all the B.S regarding the things you mentioned, the lack of overall quality professors, not being able to register for half your class, future RUscrews, and the fact that some of these professors assign huge unnecessary amounts of reading that will have you lose your sanity."
rutgers,3dxb77,wtfisthishair,5,Mon Jul 20 08:34:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like some of these things that people are talking about sound a little too good. I don't want you to get your hopes up with the food here so let me play some of these features down.   Burger bar at Livi isn't amazing and their sushi there is 'fake' because of the fact they think they can replace things like avocado with bell peppers...  Busch sushi is pretty decent, but don't expect even the Sushi Palace grade kind or a vast amount of choices (only three rolls a day) and the same goes with Neilson. DON'T expect sashami. Pasta line (all the dining halls) and Mongolian Grill (Livi, and started to do it at Busch) is pretty decent, but the wait can be a long time during peak hours. All the dining halls have pro's and con's and serve a different atmosphere. In my opinion though, Brower is a bit gloomy, and when I went there as a freshman, it was awful, but I heard it got better. They're also the only one with a crap ton of soft serve flavors (other places have around 2-4 flavors) and trays, due to them not having a rotating cleaning rack. Trays mean that you can get two plates of food, drinks, utensils all in one go; the other places there's no trays which is inconvenient sometimes. Livi is a bit fresh, but for some reason the quality they give off is 'fake' in my opinion, after eating there for a year. Busch has more options, but spotty quality and Nielson is pretty similar to Busch, but more quality, less quantity.   Now to your specifics.   210 is sort of too much; you can't really drop down from that as a freshman if I recall. They started having tighter restrictions on swiping out candy bars at the deli-like places like Woody's to burn out the remaining swipes. I remember back when I was a freshman, they had locked out the swipes partially, that I couldn't get all drinks (like bottled Gatorade and soda) so I had 70 left and with that and the last two weeks of classes I had over 200 candy bars that I gave to my siblings when I went back for the summer. You can still stockpile the candy bars I guess (Woody's now is only 2/swipe within the $7.50 meal swipe limit), but they change the restrictions every so often so talk around and find out. If you're going this route make sure you start earlier than the end of the semester as they don't restock the candy towards the end of the semester and a lot of people looking to burn their swipes. I've heard that Rutgers is now supposed to roll over swipes. If this is the case, try and save them. Even though the food isn't amazing, there are days as an upperclassmen with a small meal plan that you wish you had a 210 to fuck around with. Pizza everywhere in the dining hall sucks in my opinion. Not even at a level of a Domino's, but it's edible. Good thing the food scene at New Brunswick is pretty decent, although for pizza I'm not too sure... Oddly enough now thinking about it, I've never ordered pizza... hmmm. When you want your veggies and meat grilled I'm pretty sure you can go to the pasta line and have them fire it up for you, but the choices at the pasta line will be limited to pasta toppings; for more veggies you can go to the salad line and get them, but your meats for pasta line will be chicken, pepperoni, or saussage. What you might be looking for is the Mongolian Grill on Livi/Busch where they have beef, chicken, or shrimp. And for all of these choices, yes you can choose all three. I have friends who taken out the waffle maker because they wanted to do something stupid... I've also went in Neilson and literally took a stack of plates in front of the employees and they were saying 'you can't do that' and the such but I ignored them because I felt like I was getting robbed of $14 (if you divide the lower meal plans) at the dining hall and my apartment-mates needed plates; people do this stuff all the time with other utensils and condiments, they are a lot more discrete than I am and put them into their bags, so if you're worried just sneak it into your bag, but food is a crap ton easier and they seem to not care most of the time . I know there's that one Chinese door lady at Busch that kind of cares with bigger foods like desserts and will say something, but whatever. Oh, and about the door ladies, watch out for the blonde one at the left at Livi. There's this vibe that she gives off that feels pretentious and rude, but it's a good thing you only deal with her for a couple of seconds. I didn't take much food out when I was at Livi, but I feel like if there's anyone that might give you a bad time, she will. Toast, bagels, cereal, and coffee is all there. Bagels are spotty; a lot of days I search in them, I can't find cinnamon raisins, and then on top of that it's like a 60% chance they taste pretty decent, so you may not always get the bagel breakfast you want as a born-and-raised-New-Jerseyian. The bagel shops around aren't amazing... Hole in the Wall on Easton tastes sort of stale sometimes and feels like I'm at a frat house because of the amount of college girls that work there and surround the owner or the very few guys there... Nosh bagel is also decent little family joint ran by a Korean family and very clean, but not amazing and the same goes for Pick-a-Bagel (a bit less cleaner than Nosh), which are both on George Street. If you want a good filling breakfast I suggest if you're near the Cook Campus Center at Biel, you get yourself some pancakes, bacon, and sausage patty there with a 5.50 meal swipe at 7 or 7.50 at 10:30 am (I suggest the latter so you can get a drink or some wiggle room to spend on other things). The food at the CCC is always solid though; breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   In the end I give the dining services at Rutgers 2 stars, maybe 3. This is factoring the price that we pay for this, which keeps going up and is absurd. The fact that they raved about how much resources and money they save on getting rid of trays after the student body was riled up against pro-trays and anti-trays last year, they are probably going increase the rates again for some bull crap... The food never gets any better, and the amount of people coming in and people not eating there due to upperclassmen getting smaller meal plans (due to apartment-living where you get your own kitchen) and people graduating isn't so much more higher and actually might be lower, so it makes no sense and they better not hike it up."

rutgers,3dxb77,yashchand,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"Soda (from Pepsi only because of Rutgers' silly contract with them) from the fountain machines, juices, milk, tea packets, coffee, water... Don't expect things from a can or a bottle. From my experience they only served out of soda cans a handful of times in the three years I've been here during regular hours and takeout because they were having problems with the fountain machines.  And this is usually the same for all of the dining halls."
rutgers,3dxb77,Rezey,2,Tue Jul 21 10:59:01 2015 UTC,"I've only been to livi so...  Fountain Drinks, Gatorade (fountain and only 2 flavors), coffee, juice (like 3 choices), iced tea, hot tea, and water (obviously...). Basically anything normal people drink with meals. My only complaint is that the glasses are small and options in variety are pretty limited (example would be the Gatorade flavors which where orange or lime)."
rutgers,3dxb77,Ivan0427,3,Tue Jul 21 05:46:44 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions:   210 is the minimum for freshmen, and you won't have to every worry about swipes all dining halls have salad bars with veggies. Some have stations where you give people veggies and they'll make a stir fry for you (Livi every day, brower some days at dinner, Busch at least sometimes, not sure) coffee is served all day different dining halls have different staples. Livi always has pizza, brower sometimes does (but you don't wanna eat it). Busch always has sushi people take food all the time, but be sly about it or else you'll run the risk of getting yelled at by an employee  cereal all day, bagels in the morning. Pretty standard stuff   I mostly eat at brower and Livi so other people can weigh in on Busch and neilson."
rutgers,3dxb77,shakerattleandrollin,0,Mon Jul 20 09:35:45 2015 UTC,I haven't eaten there in a year but I'm fairly sure Busch never serves sushi. They does have has the custom pasta line though.  EDIT: Apparently better food starts to show up after I've decided to start cooking for myself

rutgers,3dxb77,TalkBigShit,2,Mon Jul 20 13:03:44 2015 UTC,Nope . Sushi everyday from like 12-8. It's decent apparently. No sushi on weekends though.

rutgers,3dxb77,budgybudge,2,Mon Jul 20 13:09:08 2015 UTC,"The dining halls at Rutgers aware pretty decent. There are 4 main dining hall and other places that accept meal swipes, so you always have options. From best to worst (IMO) : Neilson, Livi, Busch, Brower.  210 is the minimum for freshman. It sucks as most people don't finish it. Start early and swipe for food and snacks at Woodys, the Rock and others. These are like convenience store type places that let you use swipes. I don't think they have a stir fry at all the dining halls. Busch and Livi do. All dining halls have the pasta line. So you can ask them to withhold the pasta, I guess.  Coffee is all day, everyday. Cereal is all day everyday too.  Breakfast is like 7:30 to 11. Then there is lunch and dinner.  If you want to take food out, be slick about it or they will take your Tupperware and make you throw out the food.   Pizza is served everyday, I like Livi pizza, as it has thin crust and they serve white pizza all the time.  Every dining hall has their own thing.   Livi also has their own computerized burger bar."

In another instance I was at the dining hall before Thanksigiving, and one person was stashing up on food for the break.   With the exception of the burger grill at Livingston, it's basically the same thing at every dining hall; stir fry, sushi, daily specials, salad bar, deli, dessert area, pizza, omelet line, cereal.   You'll often hear that Brower is the worst and Livingston is the best, but after 4 years I don't really taste the difference."

People say it is impossible to run out of swipes, but you can easily run out of swipes if you're careless. 210 meals per semester is 2 swipes per day. If you swipe three times in one day, then you'll have to make that up somewhere. I ended last semester with over 100 unused swipes because on some days I couldn't get breakfast because of classes or an exam, didn't go to brunch on Saturday mornings, etc. But I do know people with the 280 meal plan and barely got by.  TL;DR: 210 meal plan is 2 swipes per day. Don't be careless and you will never be hungry."

rutgers,3dxb77,yashchand,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:36 2015 UTC,"I've only been to Busch but I imagine all dining halls are exactly the same. There is a huge variety, even most if not all the sodas are Pepsi products. They don't serve different drinks at different times of the day, the drinks are all there all day.   They have a milk station (whole, chocolate, 2%) and a fridge with other milks (soy, skim, etc).   At the coffee+tea station there is hot coffee (regular, decaf), hot green tea, and hot water for the variety of tea bags. They have sugar, honey, and a Coffee Mate machine that serves plain milk, plain Coffee Mate creamer and French Vanilla Coffee Mate.  There is a few small machines that serve (usually room-temperature) Lipton Green Tea (plain and Citrus) and SoBe vitamin water.  There are lots of soda machines that serve Pepsi products. They serve water, ice, Pepsi (cherry, plain, diet), orange soda, caffeine-free Mug root beer, Mountain Dew (plain and diet), Sierra Mist, Brisk iced tea (plain and Raspberry), orange soda (don't remember the brand), and one or two more I forgot.  Finally there are juice machines that I think are all Ocean Spray juices. These are usually fine but sometimes there isn't enough mix in the juice (it tastes a bit watery), so I usually try a sip of a flavor before I get a full glass. I don't drink juice much so I don't remember all the flavors but I know they had grapefruit, grape, apple, orange, and three or four mixed fruit flavors like banana-mango (or something like that).  Bolded for TL;DR.  Edit: Forgot to mention. The school has a license with Pepsi so if for whatever reason you absolutely need Coke or something, you won't be finding it in any of the school-operated vending machines or stores."

rutgers,3dxb77,yashchand,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:22 2015 UTC,"In my experience no one cares at all about bringing a drink out with you. Lots of people bring mugs to the dining hall to bring drinks out and also to use at the dining hall since their glasses are only (I'd guess) 8oz glasses. They also don't care at all if you bring some food out with you on-the-go like an apple or an ice-cream cone or something.   I have heard that if someone catches you filling a container with food to sneak out they will take your container and/or yell at you, but I never sneaked food out so I don't know. I ended the semester with hundreds of dollars of unused swipes, I couldn't bring myself to sneak food out to waste even more money."

The Hillel building was directly on College Ave until Fall 2013, when it was knocked down as part of the College Ave Redevelopment.  Other than that, the Israel-Palestinian conflict has manifested itself in the most obnoxious ways possible. At least once a semester, someone from Hillel, or someone from Students for Justice in Palestine, will write an op-ed for the Targum that will piss off the other side, and it'll be a flood of op-eds shouting words like anti-antisemitism, Zionism, Islamaphobia, etc.   Usually the two sides have at least one valid point or another, but publicly showing support or disapproval for any one side is a slippery slope."

I live in a two bed unit but they have one-bedroom apartments here too. It's really spacious, have your own laundry machines, dish washer, good kitchen (galley shaped but it's never been difficult for me and my room mate to cook at the same time), and you get a balcony/back porch. Pet friendly. They ask you on the application or whatever but I'm pretty sure we claimed we didnt have animals. My roomie has 2 cats. Never been an issue. Also, the rutgers ecological preserve is literally in my back yard. There is a trail head (blue and I think another) that is legit right behind me. So if you like nature/hiking that might be a bonus for you. Also Johnson Park is super close. Honestly it's a really convenient spot because I am very close to ALL the campuses. I can get to every campus in less than ten mins. Livingston is literally right next to me, so that's like 2 min driving, busch is 5-10 mins depending on what part of busch, college ave is about 7 min, Cook/Douglass is about 8-15 min (depending on the time of day and what part)  It's a very safe place and I like that. I can walk around Treetops/Forest Glenn at night and feel comfortable. It's not a noisy place. There's definitely a lot of other Rutgers people in this complex, as I can walk around and see tons of rutgers hang tags in the parking lot. They look like mostly commuter passes and fac/staff so it's probably a mix of older students and workers"

So if you've got a dirty neighbor you can have roaches even if you're clean, but they won't hang out there a often. So I think that's a potential problem with any apartment complex. Personally I've never had roaches or ants or any other bug infestation. Never seen a roach in here. That's just my experience. We are very clean. I suspect at least a few of those people writing reviews are dirty enough to attract roaches."

I'm doing Second Language Acquisition (Linguistics) so it's obviously different from what you're looking into. We've already started doing assigned readings for the upcoming year, and every program is different, but I definitely advise setting aside time to work on what you need to. As a math major, you could honestly look into a lot of different programs as they don't necessarily look for people with a certain major, but more so a specific skill set that they need. For example, if you're great at stats, you'd come in handy for compiling the data and graphing it or whatever it is that you math majors do (I'm a language major for a reason). Its definitely a great experience and looks great on your CV. As for my specific program, I'll be visiting Union County preschools and collecting data on how bilingual school children learn and process both their languages, which is great experience and insight for the field that I'm looking into, so not just bitch work, but hands on observation."

Point being, is school or GPA isn't the end all be all when it comes to obtaining a solid starting job.   Overall, the reality is, to ""succeed"" in accounting you need to have a reasonable GPA which you can make up for by sucking a lot of cock and being enthusiastic about it during interviews.

rutgers,3dda91,LardoftheThighs,3,Wed Jul 15 10:58:29 2015 UTC,"Go to all the lectures  Practice all of the problem sets until you can do the problems without a second guess.  Don't skip chapters, problem sets, or lectures because you assume you know them.  Practice more.  Supplement your lectures and text book with alternative sources of information, like other colleges' lectures or Khan Academy.  Practice regardless of when the midterm is.  Don't put off all of your preparation until the week it days before the lecture.  Math takes practice.  Those people you think are ""just good at math"" are really just good at practicing.  Some people might need less practice than others, but at the end of the day, people that are good at 'higher levels' of math generally have strong foundations in the basics.  Precalc is relatively low on the food chain, so if you're struggling, ensure that you have a strong foundation and consider remedial studies if the above advice doesn't help.  Just to be clear, when I say practice, I don't mean just reading notes or book chapters.  I don't mean following along with problem solutions.  I mean actually solving example problems from the book. Without a guide.  You have to do this over and over until you have an INTUITION about the concept.  If you are memorising wrote procedure you are not learning math."
rutgers,3dda91,seg-fault,3,Wed Jul 15 12:16:27 2015 UTC,"When it comes to understanding the material, don't stare at the textbook in hopes it'll make sense if it really doesn't.  If you're stuck on one weird abstract idea then try seeking help from people you know or from your TA if your prof hasn't proved to be useful with it.  Math takes a lot of abstract thinking so the more you can get a handle on it the easier you'll be able to learn more math.  So it's not like you can't come up with metaphors to help you get the hang of abstract mathematical thinking.  Here's an example when learning about asymptotes.  You can think of the function as a creeper who wants to get close to whatever value it's approaching.  But that x or y value has a restraining order against the creepy function, so the function can get closer and closer and closer but never actually reach that x or y value.  Seems silly to think of functions as stalkers with restraining orders against them, but using practical metaphors can be a lot more memorable if they're weird.  And of course they'll be a lot more memorable when you have an epiphany and say ""hey, this concept is a just like xyz in real life!""  These can really help should you decide to use them.  And remember that if anything else, learning math instills in you a certain mode of thinking.  As you apply yourself more and practice, you will find yourself coming to different aha moments you haven't reached before,  and when faced with exam or homework problems you'll see past the wording and see what they're actually asking for.  In this level of math, you can apply a method to problems and you will necessarily get the answer, but figuring out to the best of your ability how these things work will make it a lot easier to find the method each problem needs.  Also, review.  If something in chapter 6 calls back on a skill from chapter 2 then you should make sure you're comfortable with chapter 2 so you can have a stable foundation for learning 6 on top of it.  And before you come to class, read ahead the night before.  Then you'll at least have seen the material and if you know you have no idea what xyz is then you can ask about xyz when it comes up in lecture the next day.  Good luck!"

Pick up a scripting language like Python or Ruby and learn the basics of web development. Put those skills to use building web apps on your own so you get good a good understanding of how the various things you know fit together in practice.  112 will prepare you a bit for a good portion of technical interviews, so that's good. But you should read some of the popular coding interview books as well so you know what you're up against.  Start applying this Fall around October/November."

rutgers,3da2h2,Le_mons,5,Tue Jul 14 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"I hated writing the lab reports at first, but after the second or third I actually started really looking forward to writing them, they're a nice break from the usual problem sets you get as a physics major.  326 is probably the easiest class in the entire professional physics curriculum. The instructor last year posted an example lab report (.doc), and if you followed that general format you'd basically be guaranteed at least an 85 on the report even with minimal effort as long as you didn't forget anything obvious.  The course may be easy, but this won't guarantee you an A. IIRC, I received a 91 in the class, but because everyone did so well the curve worked against you and the cutoff for an A was a 92, so I ended up with a B+. The professor was not only a good teacher but a genuinely nice person as well, so that came as a bit of a shock.  Just some tips that apply to every report (all common sense things really but there were quite a few people who didn't do these):   Make sure all of your axes are labelled correctly and with the correct units. Many points are lost this way. Meticulously read the lab manual. Everything you need to include in your lab report is explicitly written somewhere in the manual. Again, many points are lost for not including everything. Get familiar with the Word equation editor, you can really spruce up your report with it. No point value, but serves as eye-candy for the grader.   I used this class (and 327) as an opportunity to learn Latex, and I think this caused the grader to be more generous to me. The graders aren't going to read your report in great detail, so just make sure everything looks pretty and all the required graphs, tables, etc. are easy for them to find.  This really depends on how you write, but expect 3-5 hours to write a decent report, maybe 10 at most if something goes wrong during the lab and you didn't notice that your data is no good until you actually started writing the report. The quizzes are super easy, so your total time spent on this class will just be writing the reports.  Unless you REALLY suck at writing, I'm sure you'll find that this class is far easier than your other physics and math classes. Don't worry about it too much."
rutgers,3d9diy,Dejlig_Mand,2,Tue Jul 14 15:00:26 2015 UTC,Paging /u/epithe.
rutgers,3d9diy,autumnishleaves,2,Wed Jul 15 14:30:14 2015 UTC,I took both the 101 and the 201 class with Professor Hoversten. He is the reason I'm further pursuing a Philosophy minor. He's a great teacher and amazing with giving extra help if you need it.
rutgers,3d9diy,Brutters,2,Wed Jul 15 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"Hey there! 201 is definitely a great place to start, and much more rigorous than 101. 201 is also a pre-req for a lot of the higher level courses, so it's good to get it out of the way. Take it with Fitelson this semester if you can.  Regarding higher level courses, you basically can't go wrong with anything taught by faculty. If you enjoy 201, you'll probably want to take the more advanced logic courses like applied symbolic logic. You may also want to check out philosophy of language (try to take it with Lepore) and epistemology (Theory of Knowledge is offered most semesters, and Epistemology is offered every spring). For ethics, jump on any classes with Ruth Chang, Holly Smith, or Larry Temkin. I really recommend taking classes as broadly as possible; there are many different sub-fields in philosophy, and you might take a class in one that doesn't seem so interesting at first only for it to become a favorite.  P.S. Philosophy Club is a great resource - they have a faculty lecture series so you can get a sense of whether you're interested in a topic or would like to take a class with a professor, and it's full of people who know the department really well and are happy to offer advice."
rutgers,3d9diy,epithe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"Great info! And someone had mentioned the Epistemology course, but didn't see it listed this semester, so it makes sense that it's only held in the spring. I'll keep your advice close.  On a different note, I'm very irked with Rutgers' Philosophy website. I've easily garnered pertinent and helpful course information on the sites for the life sciences and various other fields of study; however, the Philosophy website is quite barren in comparison in regards to information. Perhaps if I join the Philosophy Club, I can voice my concerns to the right people. Thanks!"
rutgers,3d9diy,Dilly_bar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:04:58 2015 UTC,Intro to Logic (201) is the standard introductory course for philosophy major/minors.   I can't tell if you've checked out the Rutgers philosophy department's website. There is a course listing there and I believe each course is given a brief description.
rutgers,3d9diy,Dilly_bar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I did check out the course listings and descriptions, but have just been curious as to whether 101 or 201 would be more practical for me. Also, as I'm essentially a newbie to philosophy, I can't truly decipher which upper-level courses would be ""best"" for me, as I'm unfamiliar with much of the philosophical jargon and famous philosophers. Anyway, based on your claim, I believe I'll go with 201 after all."
rutgers,3d9diy,Le_mons,2,Tue Jul 14 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"I also recommend looking on either WebReg or CSP (Course Schedule Planner) to check out classes' prequisites. I'm not sure if the philosophy department's page lists prerequisites or not. But if it doesn't, then you can find them through either of those sites.  And if you aren't familiar with any of the philosophers that courses center around, that's what Wikipedia is for! I recommend taking ancient philosophy courses first, e.g. Plato, before learning about more modern philosophers like Nietzsche."

However, the answer to your query is a flat-out, ""no, there is no 'in.'"" The way it was explained to me by some junior and senior student advisors at STAR Day is that previously matriculated students have, by way of seniority, first dibs on classes for any given upcoming semester, leaving transfer students and incoming freshmen blowing in the wind.   One mild exception to this: some advisors strongly recommended re-checking the registration website throughout August for openings, as class swapping/dropping is very common near the start of the new semester, thus allowing others to fill their respective places. I've been checking in intermittently myself for an Intro to Sociology spot (every single section had been filled), and, to my relief, a seat opened up just two days ago, so I signed up real quick like. Sure, it isn't exactly ""fair,"" but we must play the cards we're dealt, I suppose. Good luck!"

I forgot who said that, but this was back then when I transferred in Spring 2013 after getting my Associates.  The problem what I don't get is why there was a lack of support for students transferring over, and telling them ""it sucks but you gotta deal with it.""  It's incredibly infuriating when you wanted to register for classes, but you can't.  Instead you're given the blind hope that you'll be given the right guidance only to find yourself stuck in a fucking auditorium with 200+ students and given the most rushed process to register for classes.  Most deplorable on Rutgers's end.  I can't really say I regret going to Rutgers, but for the academic part of the school it was probably the worst decision."

The team is very much a club as well as a team. Some members take it very serious and have many years of racing experience, like myself. Others are more casual or did free skiing all their life. The only real skill requirement is that you can make it down a single black diamond safely (with ease). Competing is required to be on the team, but you don't have to do well. If you are not one of the top 5 people on the team(A-Team), then your time doesn't even contribute to the team.As far as going out, the team hosts a lot of parties (usually at the presidents house). The dues vary every season but al usually around $400, which does not include equipment. We take Rutgers Vans to races which take place in many east coast Ski resorts including Hunter, Blue mountain, belliayre (however you spell it). We sometimes go to ski outside of the team, and that you set up on your own. It's a great experience.

I'd be really surprised if they turned you away  Edit: And since you've never done either and will have to choose which to learn, I've always heard it said this way a dot seems to make sense: snowboarding is harder to start but skiing is harder to master. You will get down the mountain your first day skiing without falling probably but the same is usually not true for snowboarding. They are both really fun and both have there advantages. Snowboarding is better for tricks but you can still do tricks on skis. Skiing is better for speed and jumps but again you can still do that stuff on a snowboard. Whichever you choose I'm sure you will have a blast. But don't be discouraged if snowboarding takes you a bit to pick up"

If it's very difficult, the rule of thumb I've established is the number of credit-hours that class is, is also the MINIMUM number of hours you have to spend studying/going to office hours/doing practice problems outside for that class in order to do okay (C+, maybe B range). If it's an easier or moderate class, this rule should still take you a long way - but that's just during calmer part of the semester. Come midterms and finals, you'd need to increase the time.   On top of that, evaluate how adept you are on certain topics. Are you good at math? Yes? No? If not, how much more effort would you have to put in for a math-heavy class like accounting?  I say go with 5 and try to get a feel for it at the start of the semester and drop one of you need to later. However, I've always found it difficult to keep a consistent schedule during the first few weeks of the semester during the add/drop period. So you might not get an accurate feel for what you can handle; sometimes I find myself in the middle of a semester realizing I could've  handled that extra course instead of dropping it."

He tests you on what he talks about in class, not necessarily what was covered in the reading, so as long as you attend class and pay attention to what he focuses on, you should be fine."

rutgers,3d0jg5,kamdaman1212,3,Sun Jul 12 15:21:13 2015 UTC,Take Sheflin. If you do bad on his final you weren't going to get a good grade in any Macro class anyway. It's 150 easy multiple choice questions (and about a third of them you will haver already seen before on HWs and quizzes) and you have 3 hours.
rutgers,3d0jg5,notmike11,3,Sun Jul 12 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"Never had Clare, but I can tell you that Sheflin's class is not difficult if you realize that he recycles his homework assignments and asks fair questions on the final. Just make sure you keep up with the material throughout the semester -- discipline."

He actually seemed to care about the students. I cannot tell you how many times around finals he mentioned that if a professor wasn't allowing us an exam conflict we should tell him and he'd report the professor without attaching our name. I've never had a professor offer that before or since. His teaching style is a bit weird, he's a bit all over but his study guides are comprehensive. I remember he gave us a ridiculously long study guide that included basically every term we learned over the semester and some we didn't. It took hours to complete and I went crazy over the terms I couldn't find cause his final is 60% (I think, either way it was a LOT) and I needed an A on it to get an A overall. Walked in day of having completed the study guide to the most basic exam I've taken. The questions were straight from the guide. Over prepared me like I've never been over prepared before. Got a 96."

He is just a really good public speaker that can get his point across without being too wordy. The final was intimidating, but I found it comforting that it was over 200 questions long (iirc). It allowed me to have a little bit of play when it came to how many questions I could get wrong while still getting a good grade.   His stock market game singlehandedly got me into buying and selling stocks, so I guess I have a little bias towards his class, as well."

He's quirky and some of his quirks annoy a lot of people.  That being said, his lessons are all on big ideas and throughout the course, he makes it a point to drive in what really matters.  His final exam is just all of the big ideas he wanted you to take away from the course."

Since you have to take some, take whatever you would find most interesting. I think that taking a seminar with a professor you want to do research with in the future is a good idea. Aresty is a great program, so anything you can do to increase the chances of getting into it for the summer would be great."
rutgers,3d0ca0,kamdaman1212,3,Sun Jul 12 14:18:35 2015 UTC,"I would say you are fine. Smart kids go light their first semester to adjust. 50% of the battle in college is not overscheduling. Many of my friends asked me how I maintained such a high GPA, and I never once thought it was because I was smarter than any of them, its because I mapped out when I would take which difficult classes. Just don't be dumb and overload your schedule. This is the real deal. Unlike high school, this matters for life. Overloading is a sure way to do poorly in multiple classes all at once. You'll have PLENTY of time to finish all of your requirements, settle in first. No one cares about your schedule load, they care about the end product"
rutgers,3d0ca0,bigassnug,2,Sun Jul 12 15:47:05 2015 UTC,looks like a decent schedule. you're already ahead of most CS majors were at your age. since you're a freshman this will be a good way to adjust to college and see how the classes are.

Math 350 is usually (depends on the professor) much easier than Math 351. If you have any experience with proofs, I recommend trying to take it. Depending on how far you plan on going with your math major, the class could be incredibly useful.   If you do wind up taking it, you should be able to talk to someone from the CS department about having it count as 250 credit. A lot of people take math classes to count as CS electives and I'm sure people have done this before so it shouldn't be too hard to get them to do it."

If you don't take it this semester you'll be taking it next anyway, and it will be less fresh in your mind from high school.  Also, since I'm guessing you are also in the honors program, don't take Honors Colloquiam in the fall. It's on Cook/Douglass at 9 am, which is a huge pain in the ass if you don't live there.

I went out of state for undergrad and am now back for grad school. Honestly the biggest problems I've seen giving Rutgers a bad rep is the admin's need to squeeze every dime out of students and the kids who go nuts because they are now out of their parents houses but again that's most schools.

rutgers,3cxug5,Le_mons,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"In general, lecturers don't have too much power to get students into their sections.  If you need a pre-req override, a SPN, or anything of the sort, you will have to go through the undergraduate office.  That being said, even if there is no proficiency exam you might still get a pre-req override.  While you're waiting for the vice chair to respond, I think there is little harm in contacting Shtelen, explaining your situation, and asking if he thinks you could handle the course.  252 is not entirely linear algebra based, but a large portion of the course will require you to compute the eigenvalues/vectors associated to a matrix."

Problem is you may not get a spot in the spring if people don't move out and create openings."
rutgers,3cw2cy,achill26,0,Sat Jul 11 18:16:27 2015 UTC,"It has to be fall because housing contracts are for a full academic year, not by semester. But that may be different if youre transferring into the Spring semester."

Motherboards now usually have beep codes about whats wrong if something does go haywire, and if something does 90+% of the time its either a ram stick or storage device or you probably need to reapply thermal paste to the cpu/clear dust, from my personal experience. Go to /r/buildapc if you want more info on that though, you can probably build a decent programming pc for cheap. If you want to do 3d modeling and things like that though, you'd need to probably invest in a graphics card which makes things a little pricey."

rutgers,3cw64y,hopetheydontfindme,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:27:54 2015 UTC,"The math department is relatively fair, I honestly believe it comes down to your professor though.  Some are great and really know what they're talking about, some you might as well just stay home because you can't understand them through their thick accent and they clearly just read off the textbook every day at class anyway.  CS department is no sweat though, the teachers are on average very good, and none of the projects are too hard.  Exams are often departmentalized so it again comes down to how much your professor cares."
rutgers,3cw64y,nonprofitparrot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"In regards to the math department, things start to get pretty rigorous when you take your higher level math electives (i.e. proof based classes).  Calc 1,2 & 3, Linear Algebra, and Diff EQs are all pretty lax.  Do the homework, maybe read/skim the book before class if you have a hard time picking stuff up in a lecture setting, and give yourself adequate time to prepare for exams.  Also go to office hours for your TA/Prof.  If they see that you are putting in effort they will take that into account when calculating your grade.  For the high level elective classes it's much harder to say how you should prepare.  To some people it comes rather easily, but to most you will need to go to lecture and read the book if you want to do well and actually understand the material.  It also depends on the professor.  But typically you will have to study much more for proof based classes than computational ones.  In terms of getting ahead you can always just review on your own before class, but I would highly recommend taking summer classes if you're able to.  Summer classes are much less stressful and also somewhat easier to handle.  The material isn't easier but they often cut out some unnecessary filler that they might go over during the regular semester.  I've taken a class(es) every single summer since I got into college.  10/10 would do again.  This is a very generally overview. If you have any more/other specific questions, ask away."
rutgers,3cw64y,LogicalThought,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:00:11 2015 UTC,thanks for the detailed responses. I'll make sure to keep this mind
rutgers,3cw64y,gottaloveBJ,0,Sun Jul 12 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the math department isn't all that rigorous. I only studied the night before the exams and still managed to get a B+ in multivariable calculus (251) and a B in diff eq (244). I didn't go to class, do homework, or study for weekly/biweekly quizzes.   If you do want to get an A, I suggest doing the homework and additional practice problems in the book. For some math classes, you can find previous exams or practice exams on the Rutgers math website. These are good examples of what to expect.   There are some great online resources that might teach you the material better than the actual professor, such as youtube or Khan Academy. My personal favorite is Paul's Online Math Notes, found here: http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/  From my experience, professors usually test only what they covered in class. Many professors will detail all the specific sections and the type  of questions that will be on the exam. This usually occurs in the lecture or two right before the exam, but some hint at certain questions being on the exams while covering the material in class (this is what I've heard from friends who actually go to lecture haha).   Lectures with more than 200 people are kinda boring, but the professor will be willing to answer any questions during lecture or office hours. Almost all classes also have recitations, during which a TA will go over the material in more detail, do more example problems, go over homework, and sometimes give quizzes. These are much smaller, around 20-30 students, so that you can get that individual attention that some people need.   If you have any questions about specific classes or professors, definitely consult upperclassmen and ratemyprofessor. They are very useful tools. I can also answer questions about 251 or 244."
rutgers,3cw64y,umib0zu,0,Sat Jul 11 16:08:40 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  So I didn't dual in CS and math, but I minored in math a few years ago.   First, 200 people classes are largely going to be your calculus and core reqs. When I was there I was never in class of more than 30 past calc 3.   Yes exams do require you to be creative and understand what the theorems are trying to convey.   For students that want A's in courses, expect to work very hard. A few commenters mentioned you should read. I second, double, and triple this. Read every chapter of every book multiple times before the lectures. The hardest part of reading math books is the part that the dialogue is concise, things are only mentioned once, which means you need to read every single word of the required readings to fully understand the material, along with reading supplementary material to help you better understand it. Literally you need to set aside a few hours a day just to only read, with no distractions like music, friends, and homework.   On getting ahead of the crowd: Don't. You're not in business school. Math study isn't about being better than other people. You'll find an area you excel in, and you'll need to give others your understanding, as well as be helped with areas you need work in. Work together and get involved in a study group. You'll find you understand the material much better if you bounce ideas off of other people. There's an undergrad study lounge in Hill last time I was there, so use it.  Other than that, enjoy your studies!"

rutgers,3ctb2n,DracoX872,7,Sat Jul 11 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"I think you should take a look at the BLS occupation outlook site (http://www.bls.gov/ooh/ ). This will give you a decent idea as to what jobs are in demand and what jobs are available in the field that you're looking for. Just a heads up though, the magical fulfilling music production job that also pays bank doesn't exist anymore unless your dad goes by JayZ or Dr.Dre. I would look for something more realistic... like an acoustics engineer, sure the job will be pretty boring but at least you'll make money and it's music related. (http://www.indeed.com/salary/Acoustic-Engineer.html ). Usually the rule of thumb is that if the job is enjoyable and pays well, somebody who doesn't need the money is already doing it."
rutgers,3ctb2n,BeastInfection,3,Fri Jul 10 18:05:14 2015 UTC,Music production can be a great side gig or hobby. Plenty of people have passions outside their careers.

I'm sure you have advanced socially and have become more intelligent after two years but maybe you need to take a few odd jobs in different industries and start working and dabbling in your hobbies more.   If you have a basic interest in something that's related to a field I would just go for the major similar to it and you can maybe find a role.  I was always into social media and making websites so I went into computer science.  Do they directly correlate?  Kind of, but mostly not really.  However,  with those skills you will open yourself up to a broader market in something you are at least SEMI interested in.  I got an internship and did things related to automating social media and creating sites and now I'm a data analyst because my interests have shifted over time.    You won't be doing the same thing forever everyday but pick a field somewhat in your interest and transform that into a job.  However, even at that point you will learn a job is just a job and you will not always be fulfilled when your role is predetermined.  That's where I am now, and I am looking into starting my own company.  Just get the wheels rolling and keep on moving and you will find your way"

This is a nit-picky thing to harp on, but Rutgers actually pays very generous stipends to people in the humanities and social sciences (more than the New York schools, in many cases). The problem is terminal masters programs (which include official/pragmatic degrees like the Masters in Public Policy, or Masters in Public Health), which are very popular, and have almost no funding attached, yet are not liberal arts either. MFAs, additionally, are a whole 'nother level of questionable shit, since they charge grad school level prices for a degrees with just shockingly horrifying markets. Recently, an entire MFA class at USC dropped out. Anyways, my point is that the problem is that in many cases it is the semi-professional looking programs that cause large debt burdens, rather than the traditional academic disciplines."

Unfortunately I'm gonna say right off the bat I am not involved with any of those minors, so that much I cannot help you with, but as far as scheduling and suggestions for the coming fall, that I can do.  First things first: you can find the online schedule of classes at http://sis.rutgers.edu/soc/. When you open it up it'll just have you select your term (Fall, Summer, Spring of whatever year), your campus (NB, Newark, Camden, etc.), and level of study (grad or undergrad).  Once you've selected all those it'll let you in and there will be a dropdown box with all the various departments detailing what courses they are offering for the selected term on the selected campus. When you click on a course, it will show you all available sections of the course, including who teaches the section (sometimes they don't post this, if it's not on that website it's almost always available on the department's website) and what times the section meets.   Any Suggestions? Honestly, besides the cliche (but true, for what it's worth) ""put yourself out there, join a club/org/group you love and meet new people"" stuff that I'm sure people have told you more than enough times, not a ton. No matter when you came to us making friends at a school with this many people and having a good time no matter what you're into is easy mode. The only thing I'm gonna say is that the bus system...is extra love/hate. You'll find that for the month of September, if you have a class at say noon on a campus across the river, you had better be at the bus stop by 11 or may god have mercy on your soul. It peters off by the end of October, but prepare to be part of the 100 person sandwich that is an RU bus during peak hours. (You don't have to worry about this if you get to the bus stop early)."

rutgers,3cpclz,ViggyNash,3,Thu Jul 9 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"From experience, Rutgers is rough to incoming transfers. I wouldn't say that they are purposely dicks to transfer kids, they just have a bureaucratical system in place that is quite shocking and hard to digest for transfer students.   You need to be prepared to cut through bureaucratic red-tape in every step of transferring, and later in your Rutgers career. Its simply part of life at Rutgers. Its an extremely large school, and nobody is going to look out for you but yourself.  If you think you have been wronged with transferring credits, you will need to find the right person in advising for your major and prove to them that your completed classes are similar to the rutgers versions. Most advisors are quite helpful - I was able to get about 25 credits back that didn't transfer properly.  On another note, transfer students take a short (I believe mandatory) seminar course to help adjust to Rutgers. Essentially, everyone bitches and moans at the professor, which is usually an advisor, who will help you find solutions to your problems.  In short, If you're truly interested in joining the school, dont be scared away. Its going to be a rough adjustment, but I can tell you it is quite rewarding. I and all my transfer friends love it here."

As /u/dsatrbs explained, Rutgers does cap class sizes only to open them up later to freshmen and new transfers. It is possible to get into all the classes you'll need, but sometimes it is not. In that case you should make visits to your department Undergraduate Chair/Program Director (in this case Amélie Marian, from http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/people/) and the department advisors (http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/undergraduate/advising.whtml) (sometimes they are the same person, sometimes they are different).   When I transferred in, the best advice I was given from those that transferred before me was when requesting help from your department in advising/course registration was saying ""I Need This To Graduate On Time."" This is the closest thing to magic words you will find.  Fortunately my Department was fairly excellent in helping transfers.   STAR days can be helpful, but the SAS Deans who officiate it are not usually knowledgeable of the intricacies of each department. That is why it is imperative to speak to the people in charge of your undergraduate department. They will likely be there on the STAR Day, but make sure you take time to visit them in their offices too."

You can figure out when your bus will be at a stop if you just check the arrival times for the next couple of stops.  In case I'm not making sense... If you get on at Stop A and see the bus is arriving at Stop B in 2 minutes, you're 2 minutes away from Stop B.  Just scroll down to where you intend to get off and see when the bus is arriving.  It works well in the summer since buses come so infrequently so you don't have to factor in if a different bus on the same route is getting there earlier than you are.  EDIT:  I would recommend just walking to the SAC and hopping on the Summer 2 so you don't have to go all through Busch.  Also if you check out the timetables on the document you linked, it seems like the Summer 2 arrives at the SAC at 8 then gets to the Livingston Student Center by 8:08.

The grading is far stricter in 112 (though the curve is generous), and it can definitely slow any sort of speed you think you picked up in 111.

rutgers,3cigw4,FourDownMagic,-1,Fri Jul 10 00:51:21 2015 UTC,"http://www.codecademy.com/ is a fun way to spend your free time and learn other languages (anyone insinuating you won't want to be familiar with other languages is being disingenuous; like I said to another student in an earlier thread, the more you're familiar with, the more people in the work force you can effectively communicate and collaborate with). That said, don't stretch yourself too thin. Focus on learning the basics of good programming and branch out when you're ready.  There's no such thing as ""wasting your time on hackathons."" If what you intend to learn at a hackathon is coding, at the beginner level, you're going to be up against a huge challenge (use your classwork and codecademy for that). Instead, treat the hackatahon as a networking exercise. You'll meet some people who can help you along in your studies and, hopefully, your career after you're all out. It gets you exposed to turning around software quickly (seriously, this is what the real world of software design is like today - ""best to market"", iterative design cycles, intense collaboration).  Take courses that support software programming: design courses, business management, social technology courses, art and literature, gender in the workplace courses (because gender in tech is a massive issue right now, if you can be intelligent about how you approach diversity in the tech field, you're going to be leg up from day one, I promise). Know how the to write and speak with authority and impeccable grammar. One day, you might have to do a presentation on what you've come up with. In fact, I guarantee you will. You'll be talking about what you build day in and day out from here until you retire. Don't delegate that responsibility to someone else. You know what you've designed better than anyone else - be able to speak to that eloquently and succinctly.  Find a mentor. I can't stress this enough. If your mentor is a senior, awesome. If it's a professor, even better. If you're passionate enough, you may be able to garner the attention of an industry veteran who can not only provide networking opportunities, but hard-earned experience and advice in your progress forward. Don't even skip a class where a guest lecturer is coming in. Ask good questions about what they do, how you can get involved in the coding community. Programming and tech students are some of the most impressive and inspiring people out there right now, and coming from experience, my colleagues and I have hired many, many bright and passionate students right out of school.  And, yeah, build some apps. Have fun with it! Solve a problem you have with an app (if it makes sense! Most of what makes a good app is actually solving a problem people have; problem identification is a critical skill in building the right thing and knowing if it's even right to build it in the first place.)  /r/watchpeoplecode if you want to see inside the minds of other programmers and ask questions about what they're doing.  Edit: should have taken my own advice about writing with impeccable grammar ;)  Edit again: One more thing here. Don't let the Java language dissuade you from being a software developer. Truthfully, Java is not a widely used language in current software development with the very distinct exception being Android applications. It's a syntactically strict language that is used to teach beginners and that's about the end of its strengths (the whole ""universal software"" language argument died the second the Web became a thing). That doesn't mean you're going to be a Java programmer for life. If you're interested in web and mobile apps, you're likely to be using any of the following: Python, Ruby, C#/C++, PHP, JavaScript, and you should be absolutely familiar with HTML, CSS, and all flavors of pre-processing and templating systems (but, like I said before, you can hold off until you're comfortable with programming in general before you branch out). Just don't take Java as the be-all, end-all of languages."
rutgers,3cigw4,paranoiaplus,6,Wed Jul 8 16:35:24 2015 UTC,Java is not widely used outside of Android development   You're talking out of your ass. Its extremely prevalent in the industry.
rutgers,3cigw4,FourDownMagic,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what you mean. Let me clarify then.   I'm speaking from a strictly web-based software and app design perspective. OP asked about apps, so from that view, you're not going to find a lot of programmers on the front lines of app or web-based software development (again, aside from Android) working with Java as their base language. C# or C++? Definitely. ASP? Sure, once in a while. PHP? Indeed. Ruby? You bet. Proprietary-flavors of the above? Yes. Database languages? Oh yeah.  It was more a response to other comments about not liking Java and stopping programming because of it. Java's no reason to run away, and it's absolutely no guarantee that you'll be using Java in app or web-based software dev. Just learning how to program and honing those skills to make stuff is a huge part of the battle."

Are you kidding? Java is one of the most used languages for back-end web development, and it used extensively by companies like Amazon, Google, E-Bay, Netflix. Twitter started out with Ruby but switched to the JVM for scalability reasons.  The only reason you don't see Java being used by trendy start-ups is because they want to get to the market as quick as possible, and Java can be overkill for small applications."

If the scholarships were the same value your first year (say both were $5000) then yeah you'd get the $5000 from RBS if you transferred from SAS. However its possible that they wont honor that initial offer and wont give you any scholarship if you transferred over. It all depends on the school."

rutgers,3cfdtu,MeowMeowFuckingMeow,6,Tue Jul 7 14:09:05 2015 UTC,"Sup lad.  First thing first. There are 4 distinct campuses and technically, I believe only one is in Piscataway and that's Busch, possibly Livingston. The rest of Rutgers (College Ave and Cook-Douglass) is in New Brunswick.  Every campus has a gym, a dining hall, and a student center, so you don't have to worry about traveling unless you want to use the most modern and nice gym, which is Sonny Werblin Recreation center on Busch Campus in Piscataway.   If you do need to travel, there are currently summer busses that go around to every campus. When the school year starts, the bus system is much more efficient.  I can't read what else you're asking right now cuz I'm typing on my phone, but feel free to ask more questions.  Edit.  Cycling is viable. The rutgers busses have bike racks on the front, and every campus can be biked too one way or another.   The only real dangerous parts are when you go too deep into New Brunswick, and that's usually at night.  An apartment within 2 or 3 blocks of college Ave is fine, the deeper you get the worse off you'll be typically.   If you're not in dorms, then food should just be gotten from actual grocery stores. Bravo, on George Street, is right between two campuses. If you spend $40 on groceries there, they'll drive you home. If you want the best prices you'll have to drive to Aldi or Stop n Shop, which are both maybe 10 minutes away from college Ave but in different directions."
rutgers,3cfdtu,TalkBigShit,3,Tue Jul 7 14:23:36 2015 UTC,"Both Busch and Livi are in Piscataway to clear that up!  And just to add on, there's a small grocery store on Livingston campus called Kilmer's Market.  I've only been inside once and can't really remember what they sold, but they do make deli sandwiches and salads.    There's also a convenience store on every campus, usually within the student center.  You can't really go grocery shopping in them, but you can buy snacks, drinks, some office supplies, toiletries, and other things.  There are houses available to rent around the Busch campus.  They're not right next to campus, but they're within a walkable distance.  As for deer attacks, I personally have never been attacked by any and don't anyone who has, but you will see them, especially on Busch for some reason.  This particular question made me chuckle and I'm hoping you're joking :)   Good luck!"
rutgers,3cfdtu,bm1992,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely joking :)  Anywhere on Busch in particular to buy (hopefully healthy) lunch?   We're hunting for a short-term lease place at the moment, not many around...most want 9/12 months minimum. Even Airbnb is empty. Bleurgh."
rutgers,3cfdtu,bm1992,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:34:41 2015 UTC,"It's definitely going to be hard to find shorter leases.  You might want to find people who are subletting rooms because of roommates who are studying abroad or whatnot.  As for healthy lunches, there is a Moe's which CAN be healthy if you don't get any of the good stuff on it.  The faculty dining part of the Busch Dining Hall is open from 11:30-1:30 during the summer and I believe anyone can eat there.  They have different options every day, but there is a deli line and a salad bar.  Their hot entrees can also be healthy, depending on what they're serving that day.  I would recommend the dining hall if you don't want to leave Busch because at least you'll variety.  If you want to go on over to Livi (2 minute drive, 15-20 minute walk, short bus ride if you can time it right during summer), Henry's Diner has a lot of different salads that are half priced during the summer.  There's a Q'Doba, which same thing as Moe's, it CAN be healthy depending on what you get.  Not sure if you have Q'Doba and Moe's across the pond, but they're a make-your-own burrito place.  You can also make salads and bowls and tacos.  You choose the kind of meat, the toppings (lettuce, cheese, guacamole, salsa, etc.), and the meals are pretty filling.  I'll update this if I think of anything else. :)"

rutgers,3cfdtu,thebruns,3,Mon Jul 13 09:29:41 2015 UTC,"I am from Piscataway, I will answer all of your questions.   Gym: Best gym is on Busch Campus (I preferred C/D but it's far from you and honestly Busch is way more than enough). It's near the athletic facilities, you really can't miss it. Across from the traffic circle.   Food: There's great restaurants in NB. They are easier to access thanks to the busing system. Some good ones in Piscataway, harder to get to due to poor public transport facilities in the town. Grocery stores: Shoprite, hard to get to again due to bad public transport. Same for Pathmark.   Living: In Piscataway, there are a few shaky neighborhoods but if you are going to be staying near campus, you are literally extremely far from them. They are on the opposite side of town and you will have literally no reason, ever, to be on that part of town. Housing scams? I don't think so. Piscataway is a pretty safe town. Cops are bored, it's pretty affluent so you know what comes with that (don't speed with a car, don't think police are your friends you can joke with, etc).   Transport: Terrible, god-awful public transport. It's a shame. Cycling may work, but it will be freezing cold and you will hate your life. Just get a cheap car. That's honestly the best thing to do. Attacked by deer? No. There's a literal zero probability of that happening unless you like, idk, get caught petting a fawn or something.   Communication: You can get PAYG from Target or something (again will need a car to get there). It's pay as you go, you won't get gouged unless you go ABOVE what the upper limit is so just make sure you read the fine print and watch your numbers.   Any more questions, feel free to message me. Also if you're not a Spurs fan go kill yourself. Just kidding! Good luck!"

rutgers,3cfqmv,jedale,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:55:23 2015 UTC,"The longest paper I wrote for my Econ major was a 10 page book report type thing for an Economics history class.

Most of them will let you know what level of math you'll need and if there are any big papers."
rutgers,3cfqmv,bm1992,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"Yes I try to look at the syllabi, but the department does not offer the syllabi for all econ classes."

For the most part, the syllabus doesn't change if a professor teaches the same class on a yearly basis.  It seems like the Econ website even has syllabi from the previous year: http://economics.rutgers.edu/downloads-hidden-menu/undergraduate/syllabi/spring-2014-syllabi  You just have to do some digging around.  One of the upper level classes I took was Econ of Population with Ira Gang.  No math and not impossible to pass.  He talks A LOT but the material itself isn't difficult.  He teaches another class that doesn't have much math, but I can't remember what it's called.  Financial and Monetary History of the US was a really interesting class.  It did have a paper, and you had to read a different article for every class, but again, it was super interesting.  White teaches that and a European version as well.  I'm sure it's just as interesting.  I personally really like math so, unfortunately, my other upper level electives were more math based.  I hope this helps though."
rutgers,3cfqmv,jedale,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:19:39 2015 UTC,"I should add, if you are concerned about math: the required intermediate classes involve variable degrees of math:   Intermediate Macro requires mostly algebra Intermediate Micro requires differential calculus. You should probably have taken through calc 3 so you understand how to do partial differentials and etc, but if not you'll be able to get by. Econometrics will involve lots of number crunching. If you have a strong background in statistics this will help.   As far as electives go, most of the 400-level theory classes (Game theory, economics of information, economics of uncertainty, advanced econometrics) will involve some math. I can't speak as much to the 300 level applied classes; didn't really take those."

rutgers,3cdmab,skelterjohn,2,Tue Jul 7 02:46:00 2015 UTC,"Most majors don't allow you to take more than 1 or 2 D's for a required class. Try to get the F for this most recent semester so you can replace and it won't get factored into your GPA.  Its a pretty difficult thing to make up for 2 D's though. Even with great grades for the rest of your career you can really lag behind in GPA, especially if you don't replace any of those no-credit grades.  I think you should reconsider school in general if you struggled with Algebra and Econ. With Accounting you will probably have to take Calc 135, which is a lot easier than the 151, but not compared to Algebra. Ultimately, you will suffer a lot more if you stick it out for a an easy major that doesn't interest you and wind up in a saturated job market with a weak GPA. But it's not impossible to make a comeback at this point in the game. If you understand that you will have to take school very seriously and that it will probably take more time/money to graduate, you have a shot."

rutgers,3cdmab,andrisk1,2,Tue Jul 7 04:03:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that you've failed this particular course again. At the earliest opportunity, get into contact with your respective advisor and speak with them on what the best plan of action is to do. You may be put onto academic probation for a semester-in which case, you have to get buckled down and focus on your courses. Since you are in RBS, there may be a chance that you could be kicked out if you fail again and put into SAS as undeclared.   I don't know what's going to happen to you; like I said earlier, your advisor is your best bet in finding out what your situation is. What I can tell you is that Rutgers does have a resource for you to go to in the event you need help/tips/guidance on how to study better, concentrate better, reduce distractions, manage time, and vice versa. It's at the Rutgers Learning Centers (https://rlc.rutgers.edu/), and the service I'm suggesting is Academic Coaching. Academic Coaches are graduate students and most of them have graduated with honors. They are very kind, patient, and impartial. Sessions are free, are at most an hour long and you are free to schedule them whenever you want; it's at your convenience."

The other thing I can suggest is if you do get back into SAS, you could do an accounting minor from there, and do an SAS major rather, but I am not sure what else you can do. DO talk to your adviser though, no matter what. You aren't done, this is not a mistake you cannot recover from, but you need to dedicate EVERYTHING you have to get basically all As (maybe a B a semester is ok), but you really need to buckle down. Talk to your freshman adviser and see about your situation."

You shouldn't get your hopes up about it, but like I said, do your very best in the fall with the transitional semester, and apply to SAS so you can remain within Rutgers.

rutgers,3cdmab,BaleBossily,3,Tue Jul 7 06:53:31 2015 UTC,"You said you JUST finished your freshman year, meaning you haven't finished all pre-business courses. You have to have finished all pre-business for you to declare it, and financial accounting you can only take during your sophomore year, so I assume you have not actually declared a major through your adviser, which is what would mean that you have a declared major."
rutgers,3cdmab,Simabby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:57:11 2015 UTC,I already completed Financial Accounting and received a B in it. I'm 99.99% sure I'm declared as an Accounting major; I was just now thinking of my minor.
rutgers,3cdmab,Simabby,3,Tue Jul 7 06:59:42 2015 UTC,"I'm an Accounting major and what I can tell you is that simply because you've completed Financial Accounting does NOT mean you are declared as one. ALL business school students must take Fin. Acct. as part of their pre-business required courses. I believe there are five others (Stats for Business, Comp Apps., Calc I, Intro to Micro, Intro to Macro). After you've completed these courses (and passed), only then will you be able to declare a major. Your academic advisor will usually send an email out with a major declaration form to fill out."

It is easier to learn to unicycle by starting with your back to something like a telephone pole and push off from that.  That way you're evenly balanced.  By reaching to a fence it is harder to stay upright and balanced.  A good place to learn is a basketball court where you can push off the post that holds the backboard and then you have the whole flat court area to ride.

It will also be a good way to see if you can make the cut, considering you didn't make entrance reqs. Engineering isn't the easiest, but doable if you put the work in. Or do SAS then transfer in.  I am not knowledgeable about the Newark program."

Anyway, if you want to save some money, do the prereqs at county and keep your grades up.  Otherwise, it might be a good idea to go into the pre-engineering program if you are fairly confident you want to be an engineer. You have the advantage of doing a school-to-school transfer, plus the curriculum at Rutgers is pretty much standardized, the program description even says it's ""in collaboration with the NB SOE"", so you'll learn what you need to learn. Even at a good county college they might not cover certain topics, or may not cover them in the same amount of depth.  Example: My SO had that problem with Math at RU-New Brunswick this past semester in Real Analysis class because the Calc class she took at County kind of glossed over certain things (taylor series, power series, etc.) that she needed, so she had a harder time than if she had taken her calc classes at RU.  edit: Just to add, the acceptance rate at Newark is actually lower than at New Brunswick, and it's a solid school academically. Only three colleges rank higher in NJ... Princeton, RU-NB, and Stevens."

rutgers,3c5i3b,sa1010,13,Sun Jul 5 00:12:00 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend you pursue an ITI major instead of a communications major (same school). With the skills you gain from the ITI program (social informatics, HCI, management skills in information organizations, etc.) you'll be much more employable. If you're a competent programmer who also understands the technology business and social implications of the work you produce, you will be so far ahead of your class it's ridiculous. Most of those skills are learned the hard way on the job or never at all.  Edit - I'll add this: think of everything you supplement your CS degree with as a new language. The more languages you speak (e.g. design, human factors, management, statistics, HTML) the more people you're able to communicate with and collaborate with in the workforce."

Don't pay and then park in any lot you want only to definitely be ticketed. The tickets are issued by Rutgers (not the state) so there's nothing requiring you to pay it but the school will black mail you for the money (hold transcripts, stop you from paying term bills, etc).

rutgers,3c0el9,tallsoychailatte,3,Fri Jul 3 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"I am currently pursuing a double major in Accounting and Human Resource Management. For me, the HRM major complemented my first major Accounting because: 1. The classes don't conflict when I make schedules for each semester; 2. The HRM material isn't so difficult that I can't handle both it and Accounting at the same time; 3. Both majors require the SAS Core Curriculum, of which I had completed after my first semester sophomore year, so I really just needed to focus on major classes and a few electives. I was originally considering the minor because I didn't think I could finish a double major within the 4 years of undergrad, but I planned it all out and saw that I could, with just a little wiggle room at the end. However, I want to mention that I did come into Rutgers with some AP credits and I also took 2 summers worth of courses (12 credits total), which really helped with the timing of a double major.  I can't say what the pros and cons are of having a major/minor versus a double major. It's really all up to your ""main"" major, so-to-speak, and then your minor or second major. You have to be the one to see what you would be interested in and, more importantly, IF you can handle the workload. Work towards a major first and if you have room in a semester, add 1 or 2 courses of another potential major/minor that you would interested in to get an idea of what that subject/field is like."

The meetings aren't meetings, per se - they're pretty informal, meet once a week on weeknights, and range from topics like politics to writing to music. You get attendance points at these meetings; the more points, the better your chances are if you want to live in Demarest the following year, when the housing lottery rolls around. If you have no plans on staying in Demarest the year after, you don't have to go to the meetings, but you might find something you're interested in if you do!  It was nice living on College Ave for my first year at Rutgers, since I was close to everything (Demarest itself being a stone's throw away from the student center, Brower, ABP etc). But in my experience, Demarest was like what happens if the kids who never fit into a clique in high school banded together and made up a clique all their own. And I don't mean that in a disparaging way, either; there is a sense of community that forms there, so if you can break into that, you may end up really enjoying yourself. I never did (I was too asocial for the asocial clique, go figure), so my experience was middling at best. It's not for everyone, but it's worth considering!"

But that's because it's a very ""progressive"" atmosphere surrounded by the section meetings they have throughout the week. Like this person said, if you don't plan on reapplying (which I didn't), you don't have to go to these meetings. It can be a strange community, mostly because the clique of people there reapply to live in the same dorm for multiple years. Regardless, you'll meet a lot of friends there, and nearly all of the freshman live on the first floor & were randomly assigned b/c they applied to College Ave. Overall, it was a good time, but not for me, so I found a roommate and lived in Hardenbergh (river dorm) my sophmore year and with a bunch of friends in a house off-campus my junior/senior years.

rutgers,3byvz3,mister_red,2,Fri Jul 3 14:43:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, I did.   When I was there, yeah there was a loose requirement.  You have to join one of 8-ish discussion groups and attend a weekly discussion in the dorm. I lived here for two years and the first year I was pretty involved. It's actually pretty fun to meet up with people weekly who share similar interests and have a discussion (they usually only last about an hour). My second year though I totally slacked it off due to having more academic work and went to only a couple, nobody seemed to really notice. You only need to be wary when you sign up for another year, they do tend to quiz you. Keep in mind I graduated '12 so not sure what's changed but I don't suspect very much.

However, looking back, I also didn't make a solid effort to get out of my room and meet people.  With that in mind, you really need to make an effort to fit in with people there or decide not to give a shit about being left out of things. I definitely felt like the quiet misanthrope of the dorm, which is funny considering everyone probably considered themselves an outsider. Again, partially my fault.

rutgers,3bsp38,kittencannon51,7,Wed Jul 1 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"If you join a local volunteer squad they might be able to sponsor your tuition for EMT class. There's a ton of them in the area, (River Road Rescue Squad, North Brunswick First Aid, East Brunswick Rescue Squad just to name a few). Just look up the emails of the chiefs and shoot them an email and they should be able to get you set up. Otherwise the class is something like $1,000+ dollars. On top of that, Rutgers EMS usually looks for more than 1 year of experience in the field. This is usually standard and you'll find the same requirements at RWJ and JFK.  Once you've done that their website has an employment section that lists everything you need to apply here: http://rues.rutgers.edu/employment.php  By the way before you get all this done you need a Healthcare provider CPR certification through the American Heart Association. Rutgers offers a course for around $50 but your volunteer squad should be able to offer a course or sponsor you to take it. RUEMS also requires you to be certified in ICS 100, ICS 200, and NIMS 700 all of which you can take online for free at FEMA's website here: https://training.fema.gov/is/nims.aspx  What I recommend is to get set up with a volunteer organization either near Rutgers or back at your hometown where you can volunteer and gain experience. You should probably try to get all this stuff done quickly because the whole process takes awhile. At the quickest, you're probably looking at 1.5-2 years before you can even apply and get in for an interview.  Edit: Oh almost forgot. If you do get scheduled for an interview, you're required to take a written test, then you get tested on your patient assessment skills, and there's also a physical test you need to pass (which is pretty easy)."

I took it during the fall of my freshman year and not in the summer session; I don't quite know how they line up so maybe take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt, but fuck it.   I don't quite remember at this point exactly what was covered at what point, and being the summer I suspect you guys and gals are going a little faster than normal anyway, but I definitely recommend being on top of:   Conditionals (if, else, else if) Loop types (do, for, do while) Big O. Easiest way of thinking of Big O (This isn't how you actually get the Big O results for an algorithm but it is a largely accurate approximation, at least in terms of stuff covered in 111) is it's nx, where x is the number of nested loops. So if you have no loops, it's n0 = 1 or constant time; if you have one loop it's n1, or O(n), and if you have a loop within a loop, it's n2, etc. Various data types (you probably won't actually have to look over this) Arrays fo sho!  A little recursion if you've hit that already, but the 111 recursion problems weren't insane (recursion is a lot more important later)   Overall, I don't remember the 111 midterm being all that hard, considering. It was pretty harsh towards people that really couldn't wrap their heads around it, but if you're even SLIGHTLY understanding it you're probably passing. If you're like, yeah, this makes sense (even if it's still hard) you're gonna do great.  Good luck!"

From a logical standpoint, if your program was correct save for declaring an array as an incorrect type (i.e int array when you meant float/double) that's the most important thing. I think in your case, since you said the rest of your code was good, that even a grader on the harsher end of the scale wouldn't take off much. My gut says even a harsh grader would honestly take off like max 3/4 points, if they were having a bad day. Don't worry about it."

Lying about it doesn't seem like it would be worth it really.  You can say you're undeclared if pressed and leave it at that.  I'm curious if you heard that they discriminate against STEM majors, or against non-liberal arts in general.  Nursing, Account, Engineering, Pharmacy, etc. are all pretty different fields so it'd be weird for them to be so selective.

rutgers,3bhe2n,randomperson978988,6,Mon Jun 29 06:10:32 2015 UTC,"Don't! Not the dual degree, at least, since that just means you need to do the SAS core in addition to your SOE work, which really makes no sense to do.  Double major, on the other hand, do! For the double major you just have to fill the CS requirements (no SAS core), which overlaps largely with your ECE stuff so it's no problem. If you're interested in CS, you'll want to do the double major because CS courses are sorta better than ECE in every way."
rutgers,3bhe2n,Stupidenator,2,Mon Jun 29 07:50:15 2015 UTC,"Dual degree isn't really worth it because you have to take a lot more classes to fulfill SAS core. Doing EE and computer science is very doable since many electives overlap. Just make sure that you plan ahead and ensure that you fulfill all requirements for both (keep particular attention to CS because only a certain number of electives can be outside of CS).   If you have a very large number of AP credits (like 35+), then the dual degree may be doable in four years, but that would still require a lot of classes every semester. Honestly, it's better to devote yourself completely to EE, do well in that, get involved in clubs, and do some research or personal projects. That will make you a competitive candidate for graduate school or finding a job."
rutgers,3bhe2n,gottaloveBJ,2,Mon Jun 29 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"its doable, one of my friends did it(chem eng + math) and graduated cum laude so if youre committed from day 1, you can do it.   the extra work means you have to fulfill all requirements for that school, such as any electives and other classes you need to take. they might coincide (I dont think they do for CS but you'd need to check yourself) which can put almost another +30 credits by itself.  Comp sci is a pretty tough major since every class is 4 credits, and its gonna be tough doing a double major but if you can make it through, itll probably be worth it.    comp sci classes are a LOT more work than you would think. outside of class, expect to put in atleast 5-10 hours of work for each class every week.  engineering classes arnt so bad, probably 5-10 hours for all your classes per week.   not trying to deter you from pursuing a double degree, just letting you know what youre getting yourself into. I only went with a minor for this reason cause i didnt want to do all the extra work for the major.   benefits are you get 2 degrees when you graduate tho. impressive af."
rutgers,3bhe2n,freshclouds,3,Mon Jun 29 06:24:20 2015 UTC,id recommend you to sit down and plan out what courses youre gonna take each semester before you commit.   itll help you understand your pre reqs for classes and which area in cs you want to go in (a few different directions you could go in) where as engineering is pretty straight forward and most likely already set for you. most you can really change here is taking a class a semester early or later. doesnt really impact your track for graduation as long as you take the class.
rutgers,3bhe2n,freshclouds,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:33:15 2015 UTC,"I have friends that are essentially doing that.  Two of my best friends are both Computer Engineering and Computer Science double majors.  It's hard of course, but there's a lot of crossover.  You will need to spend a lot of time coordinating classes to make sure your schedule is proper.  A friend of mine violently took summer classes to meet the demands, another took 17+credits every semester and they both made it.  To answer your question YES it is feasible, it's hard but TOTALLY doable.  Honestly, some nights you will cry but you'll learn a lot.  One thing you can look into is minoring in computer science, which of course is a lot easier and is currently my plan in school.  Only 5 extra classes are needed, so perhaps that's something to look into."

Not big by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd say it's as comfortable as you're gonna get in a college dorm.   The communal bathroom situation was a bit weird to me the first month, but you get over it. The guys bathroom had 4 stalls and 4 showers, no urinals. There is typically one stall that is unusable because some asshole forgot how to flush or he took a massive dump and was too proud to let it go. Also, some weekends get really dirty because people get sloppy and vomit. However, overall, it was a situation that you will probably find at most, if not all, universities in the country if you choose to dorm and it was definitely bearable to say the least.

My dorm freshman year was Metzger on Busch and the communal bathroom was bearable for the year. Make sure you get shower slippers, i feel like that part is common sense, and get a shower caddy for the showers so none of your stuff is on the ground.   The shower Stalls are clean, its the toilets that are a mess. On the weekends vomit is a common occurence and on the weekdays the toilets progressively get dirtier and dirtier as the day goes on. HOWEVER, the key to enjoying a clean bathroom is    Know when the cleaning staff cleans the bathrooms and try to use it immediatlley afterwards. The 4 hours following the cleaning staff visits are when the bathrooms are the cleanest Use other floor bathrooms, in my dorm we had a floor with about 7 guys and 60 girls so the guys bathroom was used a lot less and as a result hell of a lot cleaner In our dorm we used the first two stalls as express stalls so that the issue of accuracy was limited to those two, which makes for a cleaner bathroom experience Do your part and don't leave the stalls a mess after your done with them     There were 5 stalls and 4 shower stalls per bathroom. I personally like communal bathrooms bc you never have to wait and i am an impatient sob in the morning."

However my speaking and listening comprehension royally sucked.  We had written tests which were around 7 pages I think and it was fine for what I knew.  But you had the speaking test where the person would basically talk to you one on one in a room and ask you things like your name and how long you've been studying and your family and whatever.  I could totally answer those questions if written, but I couldn't understand anything she was saying.  Eventually she just started talking in English and I told her at the time I knew maybe 300-400 words and while that's more than the 100-levels, my speaking made me be placed into 102.  You can't do 101 if you've learned the language before.  If you're in SAS honors and you have a language requirement, don't be ashamed if you're placed into 102.  You learn a lot and at a comfortably fast pace and your teacher will hopefully talk to you 100% in Japanese.  Great immersion into the language here at Rutgers I think.

Obviously, if you're living in a single apartment it's going to be more expensive than having a roommate. Also, you have to consider that off-campus housing is typically a 12-month lease where on campus you're living there for 9 months, so take those prices into consideration. This link brings you to a list of all the prices for different on-campus residences at Rutgers so you can use this to maybe price match and see what works best for you?   Also, keep in mind that if you're on financial aid it won't cover off-campus housing since you're dealing with a landlord and paying rent. Also also, keep in mind that if you live off campus you probably won't have a meal plan (or as much of a meal plan) so that's another cost to consider with living in dorms. I hope that helps a bit!"

rutgers,3banzw,ishiz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:27:45 2015 UTC,You will have to pay out of pocket for the apartment . Your financial aid will not go towards off-campus housing as it is not sponsored by the school.

rutgers,3banzw,jennotjenn,2,Sat Jun 27 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"Wanted to chime in here and agree with this. You can 100% use any loans (read: financial aid package) for off-campus housing. Now if you're on a scholarship or specific grants there may be a stipulation that says only for on campus housing - which just means they won't cut you a check for the difference if you live off campus.  Also, generally if you live on campus your first year then move off campus your loan amounts won't change, so you'll end up automatically getting a very large refund from Rutgers (loan servicer pays the university too much - RU refunds you the difference) that you can use for rent, etc."

rutgers,3banzw,mehrannz,3,Sat Jun 27 14:49:34 2015 UTC,"meal plans are separate from housing but can still be cheaper than buying groceries, depending on your lifestyle, how much you typically eat, what kind of food you typically eat, stuff like that.  For me it would most likely be cheaper to have a meal plan. But I also found it hard to eat right in the dining hall because I am picky as fuck. So for me it is more costly to buy groceries, but it is more convenient for me to cook at home whenever I want and eat exactly what I want. At the same time, during finals and other times where I am super busy, I wish I had a meal plan because the last thing I feel like doing is spending a bunch of time prepping meals and stuff (and I tend to hate frozen food, but I usually buy a bunch of it anyway during finals because I dont have the time do cook like I normally would. It would be better for me to eat at dining halls during those times)  If you eat a lot of food, and aren't terribly picky (hey, some of the dining halls have consistently really good food. they have improved a lot over the years!) then it is cheaper to have a meal plan. If your schedule does not allow you to regularly and easily eat at dining halls, then it might be better to cook for yourself (if you know how)"
rutgers,3banzw,superpony123,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"Getting two meal plans a year is going to cover the whole 12 months right? If that is the case then even if I get the second highest plan ($2,456 for 255) it would be 410$ per month. This seems to be a good deal for someone like me who has to stay in the dorm and don't have time/skill for cooking.  This is of course if I don't have to pay three times a year.  The thing that really took my attention is their calculations of calories, proteins and what not in their website, so one can eat healthy if he/she opts to."
rutgers,3banzw,mehrannz,2,Sat Jun 27 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they have meal plans for the summer. They usually keep the kitchen-less dorms closed and move summer residents into apartment style housing, at least that's what I've heard. Don't know if they changed it."
rutgers,3banzw,jennotjenn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:13:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information, there is still one thing that I don't understand. In the website they said the following sentence about 255 plan. Three times a week is 21 meals but they said 17, don't tell me that we can't have meals on Saturday&Sunday either :(   ""This plan provides an average of 17 meals each week. It is ideal for students who want the convenience of three meals each weekday. This plan also allows for an evening takeout meal once or twice during the week."""
rutgers,3banzw,mehrannz,2,Sat Jun 27 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"You can eat during the weekend, but it's reduced hours. Honestly, you'll be fine. I had the second highest meal plan my freshman year and I had a ton of meals left over, and I ate in the dining halls all the time. You're going to end up getting take out sometimes or eating breakfast in your room or on the go. I ended up getting rid of it once I got a kitchen because grocery shopping is a lot cheaper overall (saved about $1500, shopping for just myself at $50 a week and I ate plenty well, and not feeling like I wasted swipes if I wanted a burrito from Chipotle)"

rutgers,3banzw,dom-angelo,0,Sun Jun 28 00:18:41 2015 UTC,You would probably save about 1000-2000 dollars. Live as close to College Avenue as possible. Live with people on the same mission as you.Little bit more freedom.   Enjoy.
rutgers,3banzw,4waves,0,Sat Jun 27 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"Off campus. It's better transport and freedom to mind. It is nice to be able to live in comfort and solace that dorms cannot provide, dorms tend to be loud and active most of the time. Plus, you can do whatever you want just like you would at home.   You might have trouble cooking food but if you learn the habit of cooking everyday, you would start caring less about it. The meal plan is not worth it in my opinion. If you don't care about your diet, by all means feel free. But if you really enjoy food like me, don't get a meal plan. The same old greasy food gets dreadful and you will constantly get the urge to eat real food. Please take my advice when I say, be honest when buying groceries. You will save a lot, lot, lot, LOT of money; sorry for the emphasis, but I hate seeing my friends buy extra food that they NEVER eat, they bought (food items) six months ago and it is still chilling in their cabinet! Believe it or not but you can save $20 - $50 a month just on groceries.  Utilities depends on how your house mates are like. Overall, Heat + internet/tv + power = $10 + $20 + $30-$40 = $70. Leave at least $70 a month for utilities.  Get a house closer to college ave or cook/douglass campus. The rent floats between $430 - $550. It gets expensive if you go near Busch and Livingston campus.  I saved $600 by staying off campus."
rutgers,3banzw,IncorrigibleLife,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"The rent floats between $430 - $550.   Maybe for a double in a really crappy house, which negates many of the benefits you list (comfort and solace, mainly). Utilities could be MUCH higher than what you listed, too.    Believe it or not but you can save $20 - $50 a month just on groceries.   Not 100% sure what this even means. Are you saying compared to buying a meal plan? You can save literally hundreds a month over a meal plan. Each meal with a plan costs roughly $15+. You can cook chicken/steak/etc and have meals for less than $5/each. Were talking savings in the hundreds.  tl;dr if the real savings was only $600 less people would be living off campus. I saved roughly $3500 over 2 years by living off campus."

I currently live in a house near DSC. I have a single for $430, utilities ($30), internet ($20). I have what I want.   No, I wasn't comparing groceries with meal plan. I was telling OP to be honest with their purchases when in the supermarket. I was telling them to buy things that they know for sure were eating this month and not saving it for six months. Just by buying what he needs for the month, can save him a lot of personal money. Say, he shops every month and buys all kinds of things during the trip (food, toothpaste, etc). Toothpaste can last more than two months, does he really need to buy toothpaste every visit? Cut that from your list and save money, even if it's two bucks.

rutgers,3bciu0,superpony123,4,Sat Jun 27 23:11:47 2015 UTC,"DO NOT LET IT GO TO COLLECTIONS. It stays on your credit report for 7 years even if you pay it off. Take my advice, as someone who has had a bill go to collections. I went to the doctor when I was a freshman in college and dog sitting because I had a bad sinus infection. Told my parents but they didn't make the connection when a medical bill showed up at my house later and I wasn't home (lived on campus). I had no idea that it would be addressed to me because I was fresh out of high school and my parents usually took care of my medical bills. They ignored it and when collections agencies called my house, my parents thought they were scammers asking for money. I literally had no idea about any of this until my sophomore year when I tried to apply for a credit card and got rejected consistently but couldnt figure out why. I had a good job, had   Trying to get a credit card was damn near impossible. I'm 23. I applied for cards consistently when I was 19. When I got the letters in the mail saying WHY i got declined, they all said something about bills going to collections. I had to make a lot of annoying phone calls and pay experian like $20 to see exactly what bill was unpaid and who it was from etc. Very stressful process and I had no idea what I had done wrong. Then when I asked my parents about a small medical bill from April 2011 they are like oh.. wait... and then told me about the collections people calling all the time. I said i went to the doctor in april because i had been sick when I was house sitting.   Anyway, I only recently got approved for a credit card last fall, and I was 22. It took a lot of years to recover my credit. Collections will FUCK you in the ass no lube. Even though I had a car loan since 2010 that was NEVER paid late, always paid on time in full, other stuff that gave me good credit and showed I can pay a damn bill on time, this was just a total fluke and really screwed me over. Of course once we found out about the bill we paid it immediately but that was years later and too late.  TLDR -- collections is really bad news bears for you, pay the ticket"

rutgers,3bciu0,seg-fault,3,Sat Jun 27 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"That is not accurate at all. Rutgers Police Department is its own accredited agency with a 100% independent governing body. Rutgers PD does not even have a traffic court, which is why they are so lenient for moving violations because they don't make any money off of moving violation citations. They are so aggressive with parking enforcement because of this reason. When a person does not pay a parking ticket, it will be passed up the food chain to a collection agency as /u/mrjanuary said."

If you think $75 is bad now, wait until your parents start getting harassed by collections agents looking for a piddly $75.  Actually, the amount owed by that time will probably be higher, due to late fees.  If you don't have $75, your best bet is to tell your parents you got the ticket and can't pay it."

You'll then be in a room with people of your major, and your advisor will help you pick your classes depending on your major suboption.   You are given the tour around campus. My school is SEBS so I was only shown around Cook campus.   Oh, you also get free pizza. Get three or four slices when you can because they will disappear at a speed of light. Trust me. Follow this advice at your club meetings too lol. People at university love pizza. And it is EVERYWHERE.   Talk to peers around you. They are just as tense, nervous, willing to make friends as you. You'll find life long friends if you just try. You take the first step.   Don't be a kiss ass to professors. You are definitely unfamiliar with them and they don't care about you unless you have done something extraordinary like putting your hand in an active volcano. They know you are full of shit if you start complimenting their work, or teaching, or whatever. Simply show that you have the strength and confidence to stand up for yourself and being yourself. Professors care about your growth and hard work, not intellect. Reserve intellect for yourself, class room, presentations and tests.   Leave a good impression with whoever you are talking to. That should help you start in a positive and optimistic note, and a better future at Rutgers.   In the words of the HodgeTwins, all of this is just advice, do whatever the fuck you want to do."

You get to meet a lot of cool people in your orientation group but to be perfectly honest you probably wont ever talk to them again unless you really hit it off or if they live in your dorm, but you'll see them on campus.   You participate in a lot of group activities with your orientation group and sometimes intermingle with other groups and you'll be sick at the sound of the word ""ice breakers"" by the end.

The process to becoming an orientation leader is hard and selective so they want to be there and they are spending their summer trying to help you. DONT be afraid to ask questions no matter how stupid, weird or incriminating they may seem, most orientation leaders are really cool about answering all your question to the best of their knowledge.   Goodluck this upcoming semester and have a awesome time at orientation, meet people!"
rutgers,3b46c1,theotherjoefraizer,3,Thu Jun 25 22:31:32 2015 UTC,Wow! Great response. Thanks for all the details man
rutgers,3b46c1,BaleBossily,0,Thu Jun 25 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was cool. I mean, it was cool cause I got free ice cream after a 4 hour Discrete 2 lecture/recitation and nobody asked any questions."
rutgers,3b46c1,stevenland2,4,Fri Jun 26 02:29:36 2015 UTC,Ice breaker games. Lots of them.
rutgers,3b46c1,Darth_drizzt_42,3,Fri Jun 26 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"The overall event was alright. I knew most about Rutgers already so there wasn't too much to learn. My group leader was very over zealous with icebreakers ( our group was  a bit more introverted than others) so instead of breaking people out of their shells he just made it worse. Also a woman from Health Services will give you ""the talk"" with a cartoon involving an animated condom and a vagina, just a heads up, it's a little terrifying on short notice. The Livi apartments are extremely nice and the game show everybody takes part in is a good bit of fun with your orientation group.  Just an aside that might be of some use or maybe not. In my orientation all the leaders insisted on playing this riddle/mindgame they'd created called Good Line/Bad Line. They would point from one object to another and say either ""from x to y is a good line"" or ""from y to z is a bad line"". We sat outside in 95 degree weather for a half hour while our peer leader looked smug as shit while we figured out their stupid game. Turns out the only thing defining a good line from a bad one was that you had to say ""uh"" at some point for a good line. Anyway i doubt they're still doing it but on the off chance it saves you from heat stroke then it will have been useful cause i damn near got violent."

rutgers,3b46c1,phenomite1,2,Thu Jun 25 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, its totally a fun and positive experience, and perfect for meeting new people. As others said, you get the finest living conditions at Rutgers, the best food, and there are some fun parties at night, or you can just screw around. the organized events are fun, they make you watch silly videos that they clearly had fun making, about roommate issues or drinking at college, and there's like a game show or something, just a fun thing.  that being said, if you're not the most social person, just introverted, or just don't feel like making random new friends, it'll feel dumb. Lotta ice breakers. I sat with people from my high school at lunch instead of my group and my OL called me out on it.... I was like who cares? but they take it seriously. All in all I've totally forgotten all about those people and never run into them. It's up to you if you want to keep those connections, which IMO is a little hard since they were formed by randomness instead of through a club or dorm. Maybe at a smaller school people will be able to click better, but Rutgers is so huge that it's just unlikely. idk man free food and awesome housing, I wasn't gonna not go.   Probably a good idea not to smuggle in booze/weed though, doesn't look good when the orientation people stick their neck out for you and you disrespect them like that(I'm guessing you're underage)."

rutgers,3b3hr9,ishiz,5,Thu Jun 25 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"The amount will differ from year to year. For Perkins loans, the school is given a set amount of money, which they then distribute to the students. You get compared with the entire pool of  financial aid applicants, which differs each year. So it's not just your eligibility being considered- it's your eligibility being compared to everyone else's eligibility. You just may not have made the cut this year.  But definitely keep bugging them. Sometimes they do make additional aid available."
rutgers,3b3hr9,njmj,2,Thu Jun 25 19:54:40 2015 UTC,"I would talk to someone else. Get ready for the RU Screw. They also messed up my letter. I did not get work study , although I am currently in a managerial position at my work study job."

Now I'm hearing in my head my brother's concerns from last year. He was worried Rutgers was giving me extra financial aid as a freshman so I would choose Rutgers, but then decrease it substantially in the years following. In my current financial situation a $4000 difference from last year is pretty substantial ($2000 less financial aid, $2000 increase in cost of attendance). I would understand if my financial situation is better now than it was last year but it's 100% exactly the same as last year..."

rutgers,3b3hr9,hthrjcn,2,Tue Jun 30 16:40:03 2015 UTC,The financial aid office told me over the phone to send the appeal in a letter to the financial aid office. Don't address it to any specific person but make it clear in the letter that you're appealing for more financial aid.
rutgers,3b3hr9,RustyBonz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:58:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, just wrote and faxed mine over. Will mail too.

rutgers,3b3hr9,brownie-in-motion,2,Tue Jun 30 17:08:49 2015 UTC,As a sophomore you should be eligible for an additional $1000 stafford loan so you would have the same total loans available.

It's not an RU-Screw, it's just the federal government screwing you.  ""Financial need"" is a very broad term.  Need = COA - EFC ; Given that COA = ~$30k, that leaves a fair amount of room for need.  Appeals are not next to impossible.  Just state your circumstances and hope for the best.  Clearly state why you cannot afford to pay for school.  Other options to consider are loans - if either of your parents have low credit, they can apply for a PLUS loan, get denied, and you'll get additional unsub money."
rutgers,3b3hr9,hthrjcn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:51:43 2015 UTC,"Even if your parents have low credit, they would not get denied from a PLUS loan. My parents have horrible credit and if they applied they would get it. In fact, income and credit aren't even factors in whether you get accepted for a PLUS loan. The only thing that can make you ineligible for a PLUS loan is if you have ""adverse credit,"" meaning bankruptcy or a delinquency greater than a few thousand dollars.  I will send a letter to financial aid tomorrow. If they don't appeal it, private loans are literally my only option to stay at Rutgers, meaning I may not be able to stay at Rutgers."

rutgers,3b0j0o,turk1559,3,Thu Jun 25 01:30:27 2015 UTC,Don't defraud the school by keeping your current address on record. They could fuck you big time if they find out you moved and didn't tell them.
rutgers,3b0j0o,Grosskumtor92,3,Thu Jun 25 12:15:35 2015 UTC,They will send stuff to that address from time to time so just keep in touch with whatever family members are still in NJ for you. People do this all the time and there's nothing wrong with some tuition savings. I would however maybe change your mailing address and license to your family members house. That way you keep a jersey license and also it shows you live in NJ which you do and will.  Edit: Keep in mind this isn't fraud. Your parents are moving but you can choose to live wherever you want as an adult. For all intent and purposes you are going to be living at a family members house and storing your stuff at your parents house. If you change your mailing address and license then you are legally a resident of NJ.
rutgers,3b0j0o,Grosskumtor92,3,Thu Jun 25 12:53:14 2015 UTC,Would a family friend's address work? Also wouldn't my parent's w2 and tax return be filed under a different state and address when I fill oit the FAFSA next year?

rutgers,3b0j0o,KaiserCoaster,2,Thu Jun 25 18:05:26 2015 UTC,If he changes his address to that address then it's his legal address and maintains his in state tuition.

He would be technically living at that address and storing his stuff at his parents house. Not against the law to not sleep or store your stuff where your legal residence is.

rutgers,3b0lv0,robspot,3,Thu Jun 25 00:32:16 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question will be unique to you and your financial aid situation.  If you take out 100% the full amount of your potential bill through loans, you might get a pretty substantial refund check that would be used to pay for your housing and food costs, etc.  If the loans/grants/etc you get don't cover more than your tuition, you won't get a refund check at all.  Look at your financial aid, consider what you expect to get from grants and such, and think about what loans you are planning on taking out."

rutgers,3b0lv0,JZBreeze,2,Thu Jun 25 09:20:20 2015 UTC,"You don't really get a ""refund check"" for living off campus. There are POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS, but this is all dependent on the cost of your off campus housing situation and what you'll be ""cooking"" everyday. Add up the cost for housing (this information is available online) and the cost of a potential meal plan that you'll be choosing and now you have a baseline for how much living on campus will cost you. Then take the difference between this and the total cost of living off campus.   Don't worry you can figure this out with just using addition and subtraction."

rutgers,3b0lv0,Momoyama,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:05:01 2015 UTC,"A refund check is for when you have paid Rutgers more than what you owe. A lot of people get them for the value of a scholarship or grant after paying the full amount during the semester. If you mean that you canceled your housing and meal plan part way through last semester, you should go to student accounting to ask. The checks should have been issued already."

If you went to 9/13 of them (or some percentage of them) then you got the extra credit.  The course itself is a combination of macroeconomics and financial accounting. For example, we were tested on gdp, pgdp, the unemployment rate, etc., as well as how commercial banks work and what the banks' balance sheet looks like (what are a bank's asset's and liabilities)  Another large portion of the course was how a company was setup. He explained the ""waterfall"" of money, who gets what money first (like the bank gets their interest before the shareholders can get their dividends). He also talked about financial ratios like dividend payout ratio and Leverage ratio (all of which has to do with company numbers.   The last thing I remember him teaching is how to calculate bond and stock prices.   The course is not too hard. You just have to pay attention because Dym doesnt post good notes online, so you have to take them all yourself because he doesnt use a book either."

It depends if you are a math person (read an equation and fully understand it or make an equation) or not. I am great with conceptual business like management and finance so i struggled in areas that had me read case studies, find COGS, or understand some principle.

A maximum amount of Rutgers' budget is set aside for the RAG, which is given to those who have the most need for additional need-based aid. Essentially, it's given out because Rutgers is too expensive.   I receive the maximum amount of state and federal aid because my parent's contribution is $0. Even though I receive the maximum amount of federal loans, NJTAG, Pell Grant, and received a $2000 work study, my term bill would have been around $2500 per semester last year without the RAG, which gave me $2000 per semester. While that is possible to save up for in a summer job, not everyone receives the maximum amount of aid like I do, which is why the RAG is necessary."

I had my reasons for living on campus. One, I was a freshman last year so I didn't really want to live off campus 2 hours away from my home. Two, I'm a first-generation American and first-generation college student and I can't afford for anything to go wrong; living on campus is more convenient and less risky and I don't have a car. And lastly for medical reasons I have to be as close to the classes as possible."
rutgers,3ah72t,ishiz,2,Tue Jun 23 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"My situation is extremely similar. Same family contributions, and I'm first generation college student. My house is also 2 hours away. What I did after my freshman year was I got a house with a bunch of my friends. I had a double on College Ave (Huntington Street) and paid $417/month + utilities. As for things going wrong, that's what happened to me. I ended up moving out of the house and getting an apartment 3 months into the semester. I had a single off of Hamilton Street for $600/month + utilities for the rest of the year. Also I lived with my parents in the summer before the semester (I had a job there) but paid rent on my house despite me not technically living there. I'm not really suggesting you do this, but I just wanted to give you some insight that it can be done. Also, I really didn't know much about housing/rent/living on my own in general when I was a freshman but I learned quick. I'll also admit my parents helped me out financially when I got arrested which was obviously could have gone wrong, but still possible, for example using credit cards and more loans. I know everyone demands not to keep a balance on a credit card, but when unexpected things come up it's certainly an option. I went to the career fair and have an internship that pays very well (btw I'm comp sci also) and I should be debt free (excluding student loans) by the new year. Everyone's situation is different, though. Good luck!"

rutgers,3af00w,5till0fthenight,2,Fri Jun 19 16:18:12 2015 UTC,"I was a Stat major who graduated in May. From what I remember 486 really depends on the professor based on the experience of me and a friend who took it another semester. In my class, the professor was a grad student who never used the book and was very difficult to understand in lecture. Our grade was based off of 3 exams and 2 R projects and we were allowed notes on the exams. The exams were tough but the grading was curved really well so I ended up getting a B+ thanks to working really hard on the projects and making good notes for the exam. My friend who took it said that his professor had a lot more projects and overall it seemed like his class was more difficult.   Regression Methods I took with a part-time teacher. This guy was hard to hear in class and neither his in-class notes or slides in class appeared particularly helpful. I don't even remember the textbook either. Anyway, similar story as 486, there were a couple of assignments and 3 exams where we were allowed notes. The exams were a little tricky but not super hard if you just used a little bit of stat common sense and with his curving, I got an A.   Here are some takeaways I can give you: Both classes are three hours long and I would highly recommend trying to go to all the classes and pay attention (or at the very least, note important things they mention in class over and over), but even if you're not good at going to all the classes (like I was), you should be fine if you try to keep up with the book/slides and make good in-class notes for the exams."

There's something fishy about waiting 10 years to bring up a charge like this.  Also statute of limitations for sexual assault:     ""In New Jersey, there is a two-year statute of limitations from the date the last act of harassment took place. Even if most of the behavior occurred outside of this two-year period, if one act still falls within it, then the victim can attempt to recover damages for the entire pattern of conduct. If someone is wrongfully terminated (for example, they were fired for refusing to give in to demands for sexual favors) then there is also a two-year statute of limitations from the date of firing."""
rutgers,3ad1ee,theonlynever6,3,Fri Jun 19 17:30:13 2015 UTC,"There's a statute of limitations for a civil suit. But for a criminal suit, there is no statute of limitations on sexual assault or rape in NJ.  As someone who has been assaulted, it took me many many years to tell anyone. This is not uncommon at all. Having said that, I didn't go after the guy because I had no evidence, and because I believe he genuinely regretted it and apologized profusely. That's the hard thing with rape and assault--unless you go to the hospital right away and get a rape kit done, or unless some kind of video or audio exists to prove it, or some other hard evidence exists, it's really one person's word against another--and isn't that how it is for a lot of other crimes anyway? It's not a perfect system, and I'm not suggesting it change, but I'm just saying going to the hospital, telling someone that you've been violated and raped, and then having a rape kit done is NOT necessarily the first thing someone who has been raped wants to do. I went home and took a shower because I felt disgusting and didn't tell anyone."

The article claims that there was oral and coital sex on a daily basis for a period of time. That's a lot of opportunities for a rape kit. And the accuser had literally a decade to think about it. I'm not saying that telling someone about rape is easy, but after the 7th time that week, is it really so hard to tell someone that you'd been raped that you'd literally rather get raped another 7 times next week?    The ""sexual assaults became increasingly more severe in nature"" with Fugman forcing the woman to perform oral sex on him and sexual intercourse in his office, the lawsuit claims.  ""Over the course of time, these assaults escalated in frequency to the point where they were occurring on a regular basis,"" and he even showed up at her home demanding to be let in, the lawsuit says.

rutgers,3ad1ee,theonlynever6,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, I find it very strange too that someone would let it go on for that long without saying anything. Like you said, at a certain point she must have known that it would just keep happening. That doesn't make it any more ""OK"" that it was happening (if it was) but I'm sure we dont have the entire story (for either side!). What if this was a really great job for her field with serious opportunities? Maybe she was working on some kind of ground breaking research? I dont know, but there are also people who will put up with abuse of many kinds for a long time if they think there is some kind of light at the end of the tunnel or if they think they have something to accomplish that cant be done without being around their abuser (like working on some kind of research that is important to your career).  I fully believe in innocent until proven guilty, but people (esp on reddit) often make false rape accusations seem like this HUGE problem with a high incidence. It's definitely a thing, and I've known people impacted by it. I think it's HORRIBLe because not only does it ruin someone's life but it makes women who have truly been raped or assaulted seem much more ""questionable"" and that sucks too. Having said that, very few rape accusations are provably false. (like 1-2% last I read). I guess what I am saying is that statistically, she is probably not lying, but that doesnt mean she is actually telling the truth.  I think with my own prior experience and if I was in her shoes, I would go to the hospital and get it done. But a lot of people dont have the mental strength to do that after being abused for so long so I dunno"

They're 4 different ""levels"" for each group, starting from open which is for beginners, to level 3 which is for experts. You can join as many groups as you like, but I recommend 4 groups or less - they're about 20+ dances, and switching from costume to costume takes up a lot of time. I've done it for two semesters so far, and I absolutely love it - especially during rehearsal/recital days, where you get to see all of the dances and meet new people.  If you don't want to perform at the end of the semester, I know that the fitness center has a hip hop class for I believe 6 weeks. I've never done it, but I've heard that it's a lot of fun."

rutgers,3ad5wr,foomy_S,3,Sun Jun 28 02:56:04 2015 UTC,"Saw this and couldn't resist helping you out haha.  I haven't danced in a minute but I'm very familiar with the Rutgers and NJ dance community, and plenty people get down around campus.  Rutgers has a large urban dance community.  Check out Team Technique, Cheese Bandits, and Raps Dance Troupe.  There's also Verse One (which doesn't require auditions).  Another group called The Society practices around campus, though they're not Rutgers-affiliated.  They are all choreography groups but a number of their members freestyle, too.  So if you come out to their auditions early next semester, you will meet plenty of dancers and can grow your local network.  As far as freestyle sessions go, they are around campus, though maybe not as much lately.  Most of them now seem to train in New York or in their local areas, as most of the serious freestyle dancers have graduated.  There is a Facebook group specifically where these guys organize practice sessions, but it's a closed group.  They've been sort of inactive though since the spring semester ended.  If you'd like, I can PM you the next time they organize something (usually in Tillet or Lucy Stone Hall-Auditorium) and maybe you can meet them and ask them to invite you to the group.  Hell, if you walk around Tillet or LSH-A at night after 9pm, you are bound to find people practicing.  There's also New York if you really want to get absorbed into the scene, and I can probably direct you to some good places.  Of course/unfortunately, it's not a cheap commute.  Also, check your inbox.  I'll PM you a link to an open Facebook group -- people used to use it to organize practices around NJ/Rutgers, but it's mostly just promoting dance workshops, events, and videos now. And for the most part, it's inactive.  However it's useful to know about things going around the area, and if you post and introduce yourself, I'm sure you will get a response or two.  I'll PM you the link in case you don't want anyone to link your Facebook to your reddit account (should you decide to post in the group).  Hope this helps."

rutgers,3absx5,SaucyItem,6,Thu Jun 18 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"All of this being said, the university completed this $2mil plan but still has not put together a housing study, an analysis of its facilities' conditions, an analysis of classroom/lab/office space, a feasibility study for any of the boardwalk/river ideas, and many other aspects discussed in the report. What you're seeing is a (very expensive) vision suggestion as determined mostly by private consultants, Rutgers top brass, and the occasional student survey thrown in (of course, only if it lines up with what the former agree to).  In other words, Rutgers walked into the doctor's office with a filled prescription and is just now looking for a diagnosis."
rutgers,3absx5,EwBrunswick,2,Fri Jun 19 04:43:44 2015 UTC,"Its a sad plan actually. The boardwalk is impossible as shown. Its like they forgot the river is significantly down from the campus. Whats also sad is that Rutgers has a very well respected planning school, but there was zero involvement of the planning school in the planning process. Instead, Barchi's consultant friends got serious cash to make an infeasible plan/vision. It looks cool, but why spend $2million on something that's never going to happen?"
rutgers,3absx5,walkedoff,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:16:38 2015 UTC,"You are right that our own planning school should have played a role in the planning process, and that was a huge missed opportunity.  I skimmed the New Brunswick master plan and I think it's clear that the administration wanted to shoot for the stars. But even if just half of the projects saw fruition, it would still represent a significant investment in the campus. Important to note that the boardwalk is planned for ""2030 and beyond"", which means it won't see the light of day any time soon...  The Newark campus has a well thought out plan. The additional buildings, renovations, connections to nearby parks, and transit considerations are all reasonable. Most of the major changes take place within 5 years and most are already funded.  The Camden campus plan contains some good ideas, but some of the larger capital expenses look too far out and unfunded (the new B-school building wont be for at least 5+ years, and the new Science building wont be seen for 10+ years)."
rutgers,3absx5,dsatrbs,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:19:03 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, it looks great. I just tend to prefer planning something that can actually happen, and not wasting money on dreams. Like the Boardwalk, for ADA reasons the ramp to get down there would have to be HUGE, and go back and forth maybe 30 times. The plan ""forgets""  about pesky things like real world construction barriers.    It also doesnt help looking at the previous plan and everything that was never built, and stuff that was built that was never in the plan."
rutgers,3absx5,walkedoff,2,Fri Jun 19 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly this- most of the stuff that Rutgers has built recently wasn't in the 2004 master plan, and a lot of what was in the 2004 master plan didn't get built. It's part of the new structure for higher education financing that doesn't lend itself well to planning. The campus will take on forms that are more market-oriented and responsive to donors, trends, and property transactions, just like the Business School or the DEVCO development. Neither projects were called for or foreseen back in 2004, yet they represent some of the single largest investments to date.   Additionally Barchi himself said  ""Right now none of the pieces of the facilities master plan are costed out""and ""Much of [the physical master plan] might never get built. I don't know."". The defeatism reeks of a president on his fifth year of a five year contract - in other words - he doesn't have a lot of skin in this game. At the end of his presidency, he can say that he merged UMDNJ and Rutgers and has a big fat coffee table book of plans for the Rutgers that never was. His legacy will look great on paper, but then again it is a $3 million+ piece of paper."
rutgers,3absx5,EwBrunswick,7,Fri Jun 19 23:30:22 2015 UTC,"Is this the one that calls for a boardwalk on the Raritan? Overall i really can't argue with the look of the plans. The area from the student center to hardenberg definitely clashes with the more classical Ivy look of the buildings by Murray hall and the art library. Some consistency will be nice for the atmosphere of the campus, although whether we have the money for this remains to be seen ( probably not)"
rutgers,3absx5,Darth_drizzt_42,-2,Thu Jun 18 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"IDK how we wouldnt? The undergrad size is 30k+ and our football program is getting better and better. Within the next few years, Rutgers will have a boom period and this school ranking will improve exponentially. With all the renovations and B1G publicity, this school is about to change a lot for the better. Now if they stop letting Jersey kids with sub 3.0 GPAs in, we will be taken way more serious."
rutgers,3absx5,spotapp,6,Thu Jun 18 23:29:31 2015 UTC,"Except Rutgers is the STATE university of NJ, letting in Jersey kids is the whole point of the school. We have to balance the schools reputation with remaining accessible."

In the spring I took Paper Making which was actually REALLY cool and pretty fun. You literally make your own paper and you can make different types and colors and stuff.

You literally just have to show up. Also, they're very small environments (I don't think any more than 20 students/class?) so it's a really good way to get to know a professor, which can really come in handy when applying for different programs throughout your Rutgers career. Also, FIGs also serve as kind of a first-year transition class so you are able to get your hands on a lot of information that you really wouldn't get otherwise.

At beginning of semester he will say (or put on syllabus) that there will be 2 exams, 2 papers, or something to that effect. By end of semester, he WILL change this to just 1 final paper. Easy A class where you can also learn something."

A few friends has their basement apartment broken into and robbed while they were playing video games in the first floor living room. Other friends had all their screens cut by someone trying to open their windows and others has their window air conditioner kicked in. Lots of property crime so don't be a victim.
rutgers,3a12jo,SnackFlag,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:24:17 2015 UTC,An important thing to note about renters insurance is that companies often require proof of purchase of stolen items.  My friends' house got robbed and they got screwed over on a few things.

I've had a number of security deposits wrongfully withheld.   Test the faucets and windows.   Don't believe everything you hear about ""dangerous"" areas.

rutgers,3a12jo,saryu38,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"Rent can be anywhere from 450-800 depending on room size and the house. I'd feel safe saying most people pay around 600.  This varies by group. If you're looking for something nicer, go further away from Easton (generally). This really depends on what your group values.  ""Hot properties"" are already leased for the next year. Start your search around January if you're looking to get a solid place.  I'm not really sure what you're asking here. If you're all open to driving, remember you don't need to live near a bus stop. Somerset, off of Busch, and off of C/D are all less noisy than Easton can be"
rutgers,3a12jo,its_swift,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:43:56 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say 600 is an average. That seems kind of high.  Rent generally depends on the size of your group and the quality of the house

rutgers,3a12jo,zerachechiel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:20:18 2015 UTC,Ah okay. I honestly had no idea what the price of a single was. OP just to give you a reference I live in a house with 7 people and my rent is 460 including utilities.  Beautiful house too couldn't be happier.
rutgers,3a12jo,Eaglebloo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:22:53 2015 UTC,"At this point, you want to walk the campus and look for ""FOR RENT"" signs. There were always plenty even up through September. Online resources are still good, but I figure most have been scavenged.   As someone else said, 600 is about what most people pay for a single in the decent areas (Between College Ave and Easton Ave.. and a street or two past Easton). Those are the only areas I would personally live... but you can get more bang for your buck down hamilton or past guilden/delafield  And what to look for: Laundry machines, Living Room, maybe a party basement if you want to contribute to the campus life, off-street parking if you need it (it's worth a little more in rent if this is provided), and a landlord that wont bug you/charge late fees/etc"
rutgers,3a12jo,BigPaperCompany,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:44:55 2015 UTC,Just a heads up.  Never 100% trust what the landlord says about the house.  A lot of times they'll say they're going to fix up the house because the last kids that lived there destroyed it.  That's bullshit and I've never come across one following through on that.  It's just a common line they use.  Heard it every time a house has been rented.  The landlord is most likely going to fix up a house when it fails inspection.  One thing to remember is that there are houses also available off of the cook/douglass campus and they tend to be a little nicer.  If you're looking for a place that's safer and less likely to be broken into than a house on college ave check out C/D.  You are in what most people would consider a less desirable location since most of the parties happen on college ave and everything is a bit more of a walk.  Oh and there are also houses across the river close to busch/livi campus.  Much much much nicer than college ave houses and usually around the same price.  But again location.

I know what you're probably thinking, with ""the guys here suck"" attitude, this is probably the last thing on your mind. However, there are 86 Greek organizations on campus and they cater to all walks of life. Personally, I rushed as a transfer student because I was desperate to meet people, but I'll tell you from first hand experience that you'll meet every type of person doing so. I consider it the best choice of my collegeant career and have met countless, fantastic people who I know I will be good friends with for the rest of my life. Even if you absolutely hate this idea, I still recommend rushing. If anything, consider it a networking opportunity, or a chance to see and meet people you would not have had the opportunity otherwise. I never considered joining a fraternity, and all my friends tell me I am the exact opposite of what they would consider a ""frat guy"", but once I met some awesome people I never looked back. I would not have half the friends I do right now if my decision was different."

We'll celebrate our 4 year anniversary in October.   It made my time at RU great."

The majority of the people I met at this school was by living on-campus and making friends with the people living on my floor. I rarely make friends in class since the majority of them are giant lectures or small writing classes where I'm just there to do work and get out. However, I've met some friendly people through classes with recitations/workshops where you work in groups as well as lab classes. I highly recommend finding a job on campus; I'm decent friends with the people I work with."

You could get a bit more public by bumping uglies in a secluded part of the libraries. I've gotten racy in the college ave parking deck a handful of times and never got caught. Same goes for bathroom stalls in most Student Centers.  You could definitely fuck in the Rutgers Cinema. I've been to the Rutgers Cinema a handful of times. Half of the times I've gone, the theater was completely empty (which was awesome because it was super comfy to watch a movie with my buds in practically a private theater). I imagine this occurrence would be even more frequent over the summer. Just avoid premieres, and you'll probably have a big room to all to yourself to fuck in.  Try classrooms on lower floors of buildings since they won't get much use. I can't think of any in particular at the moment, but it's definitely worth a shot.  I can think of some rooms in the engineering building that are almost never populated during the school year, so they'd probably have almost no one in them during most of the day. I suspect they'd be locked over the summer though, so don't count on it.  If you could manage to get into the basement of any of the buildings that stay open during the summer, you could probably fuck there. I wouldn't rank this very high since it's likely to be uncomfortable and dirty."

It's a new class so it doesn't even have a real course number yet (it was listed under Research Problems in Environmental and Business Economics and the Business Essentials part was a section of it) but it was really useful. The professor, Peter Renzulli, is a super chill guy and taught us a lot of business practices that apply in real life in non-business situations. Even if you have no interest in the business world, he taught us little tips on how to market ourselves and doesn't teach bullshit theoretical crap (he constantly disses a lot of classes in RBS for being totally useless in real life)."

rutgers,39gq9j,tobyps,23,Thu Jun 11 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"If Rutgers has a chance to give you a ticket, they will give you a ticket."
rutgers,39gq9j,LogicalThought,8,Thu Jun 11 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"I've found that its specifically around these change-over times that they like to make rounds to give out tickets:  A friend was working in the lab. They had parked their car in the lot just outside lab which was open til 2 am. They left the lab at 2:10 or so just to find they had received an exorbitant ticket at about 2:04.   And I've seen things like this quite a few other times as well. Of course, you can always appeal a ticket saying you had just arrived and being there only a few minutes too early, you might be successful in that course of action. Also, assuming you haven't gotten a ticket recently, they usually will give a warning first so you can test the waters that way. (Then again I've also seen them pull the ridiculous stunt of giving two tickets at the same time for two things you'd think would count as being the same but they claim do not, the first of which will be a warning and the second will be a large sum.)"
rutgers,39gq9j,nerraw92,2,Thu Jun 11 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on when they come through. Yes, they'll ticket you for breaking the rules. Of course they will. It depends on getting caught."

Statistically it's unlikely that the security officer on that campus is going to be at your exact location at your exact time. Also, no contrary to popular belief, they arent all assholes and most likely aren't going to give out a ticket at 7:45 AM, because the lot opens soon, and if you have a pass for that lot, well that's silly. Most of them realize this. From what I've seen, they are more likely to stake out the lots at 2am when the lots close, not right before they open."

Closer to New St. they have newer Rutgers apartments and such, but still not the best.  Lot better than it used to be.  And yeah, I'll reiterate the be aware of your surroundings sentiment.  Commercial Ave to Nichol Ave. is where I knew most college kids lived in that area, but probably a little further away from Bloustein than you'd like.  As I side note I'm actually on a softball team filled with Bloustein students....  Highland Park is where it's at if you are looking for safety."

Carman street is closer to where a lot of businesses and the public safety building is though, so it is probably safer than those smaller residential streets where a lot of students live.

Your best bet, if you are not a rutgers student, is apply to RU-SAS and then apply to transfer into the nursing school after two semesters at SAS. You have to have completed at least 24 credits at RU before you are eligible to transfer. You can still take some of the classes nursing students take as freshman and sophomores if you havent taken them at your school yet (like microbiology, anatomy and physiology, chemistry, statistics, etc)   Source  Secondly, the nursing school cares a lot about GPA."

rutgers,39e7oh,Murka_Durka,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:02:05 2015 UTC,"I would say for tranferring into Rutgers, you should probably have somewhere around a 3.5, especially if you are transferring from a community college. I'm a transfer and had 3.5 leaving another state school as a comp sci/math major and I didn't have any problems. Rutgers also cares a lot about GPA for a Nursing major, and as already mentioned , you can't transfer into the nursing school without being at Rutgers for 2 semesters. When it comes to deadlines for applications i don't believe the dead lines are out for the next spring transfers or for next year fall transfers but they would probably be something similar to this year.

The bag will contain information on first year experience. The paper has your advisor's name and your information. You also write down the classes you want to take. Classes depend on your placement tests which you should've taken already. You take a seat and listen to speeches done by deans and students. After speeches, they call your advisor's name 1 by 1. You follow them.   Your advisor will give you some links to keep track of (you bring a writing utensil just for this). Then you will speak 1 on 1 with them for actual class selection and other information. They know everything. I can PM you an actual form (did mine already).   This was for SEBS btw"
rutgers,39bjuj,beelzuhbub,5,Wed Jun 10 17:26:00 2015 UTC,In many cases it's because they do not know who will be teaching certain sections.

In other cases (cough math department cough) it's because there are instructors nobody in their right mind would ever sign up for.

My whole friend group stayed the same since all of us went to Rutgers so I never bothered trying to really make any other close friends. Don't do that, and try to branch out. I was really lazy and complacent so now all of my friends have their own group of friends that they made and I'm just stuck always hanging out with the same people."
rutgers,396upc,fuckedupsarcasm,2,Thu Jun 11 20:53:25 2015 UTC,I had a fairly large amount of people from my HS graduating class go to Rutgers as well and to be honest I'm friends with maybe 4-5 of them still.   3 of them were my best friends in HS and remained my best friends through college. 1 had the same major as me in the business school so we took most of our classes together so we just stayed close and the last one was also in the b-school but different major so i saw him around all the time but never really hung out with him or anything.  Out of the other 50 or so people who came to Rutgers I saw them maybe once or twice in my 4 years and just said hello or gave them a head nod or something. You can easily separate yourself from the people who were in your high school.
rutgers,396upc,flyingcrayons,2,Tue Jun 9 19:03:52 2015 UTC,No. Rutgers is gigantic so you probably will rarely see people from high school. My hs graduating class was around 850 and I still barely bumped into people I knew from hs.
rutgers,396upc,bjorn2bwild,2,Tue Jun 9 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"About 15 people from my high school class also went to RU, and over the years, I lived with 5 of them at one point or another. I ran into most of the others fairly often, but certainly not on a daily basis or anything like that. There were also several people I would run into from the classes a year or 2 behind me. Most of my social group at RU, however, were from other towns that I either met in class, or through some other means. The campus is big enough that you'll see the people you want to, but you don't have to bother with the ones you don't."
rutgers,396upc,jimtow28,2,Wed Jun 10 13:57:09 2015 UTC,"Graduated from a public school in NJ, class of ~300, 50ish people went to RU.  There was one guy who I had sorta known in high school but not super well and we actually ended up having a ton in common and becoming really close friends.  There were two other guys I had been friends with in hs who I ended up hanging out with regularly cause we made an effort to (we were on different campuses). Other than that it was bumping into people once in awhile at the dining hall or something like that but I pretty rarely saw anyone from high school unless I was trying to."
rutgers,396upc,1piperpiping,2,Wed Jun 10 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"Nah, it never felt that way. Roughly 1/3 of my graduating class went to Rutgers (so around 100 kids) and while I still hung out with a few of my friends from high school, I rarely saw the rest. Every now and then you'll run into someone walking around campus or at a party or something, which can be weird, but only if you let it. You basically can choose who you want to keep in your life from high school, and those will likely be the only people you'll see - the rest will just disappear amongst the other students."
rutgers,396upc,tannaxxbanana,2,Thu Jun 11 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"Guess I have to be the dissenting opinion here. I went to HS in Piscataway, and yes, I see Pway High grads everywhere at Rutgers. That's obviously a very unique experience, though. Wouldn't expect it as much from high schools that are farther away."
rutgers,396upc,xPainCakes,2,Fri Jun 12 14:55:12 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. You will have the comforts of home being in the same state so similiar food options around town etc. But it's an enourmous university so it doesn't feel like high school at all.

rutgers,3994a5,kaykay310,3,Wed Jun 10 04:20:07 2015 UTC,"The standards for rutgers have been only going up. As of now the Averages for the fall 14 SAS class is a gpa with 3.5-4 and the average SAT is a min of 1730- 2040 but this is with the old style SAT. I presume for your year will be a 1800(idk conversion to 1600). So you really gotta strive for that equivalent score. Hard work pays off, good luck my friend.  Edit: these stats are for the New brunswick school."
rutgers,3994a5,Brian_K9,2,Wed Jun 10 03:50:00 2015 UTC,Once you get into Rutgers your GPA and SAT don't really matter anymore. I personally don't think your scores are indicative of how well you'll do in college because it's a totally different experience. I had sub par scores and wound up in the top 10% of my sophomore class at RU. Conversely I know a few people that had scores above a 2000 and had really bad GPA's.  Tl;dr Scores don't matter after you're in. Focus on getting in and you can pick whatever major you want.

rutgers,397noy,libertarian76,3,Tue Jun 9 21:08:04 2015 UTC,Don't even bother buying season tickets for the football games. Rutgers has the Scarlet Lottery available where you can enter your name into a lottery to get a ticket for the game. I didn't buy a season ticket and I was able to go to all of the games I wanted to go to. Save your money.
rutgers,397noy,SenoraRamos,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"I would suggest waiting until June 27th...  My freshman year, 2007, had almost all games sell out and many of my friends couldn't get into the games. The same thing happened in 2008. Other games where this happened were Louisville 2012, Penn State 2014, and Michigan 2014. If Rutgers starts winning many games in a row, the same thing could happen again. I'd expect Ohio State to be sold out this year and possibly Michigan State, too."
rutgers,397noy,pnosker,0,Thu Jun 11 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"Freshman get the season tickets later (quite understandably). A piece of advice however; season tickets GUARANTEE ur admission into every home game. People will tell you not to bother with it but the scarlet lottery isn't perfect and every doesn't get a ticket in the lottery. In fact freshman have the lowest chances. I personally went to every game freshman year (last season) via the scarlet lottery but it is nerve wracking and there were some unlucky people who didn't get to go to the Penn State game and/or the Michigan game and had to buy tickets or not go at all. Remember the Scarlet Lottery is a gamble, good luck!"

You can't be considered a resident of the state for purposes of tuition while you are here for school, if you are from out of state.  Stay over the summer, get a job, driver's license, whatever...it doesn't matter, you won't be a resident for purposes of tuition.  The only way to do it is to live and work in the state for something like a calendar year (possibly two), without being a student.  If your purpose for being in the state is to attend school, you cannot be considered a resident.  I lived in Indiana for five straight years, and not a single one of those years was I considered in-state for purposes of tuition because I was there primarily for the purposes of attending school."
rutgers,394gg3,MutatedSpleen,2,Tue Jun 9 07:30:16 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. You must prove you are in NJ for a reason OTHER THAN SCHOOL. Once you come to the state for college, that goes out the window. You won't be able to claim residency unless you take at least a year off and work full time in NJ along with all the other things. If you're here for school, they know it, and you won't get residency. Sorry."

rutgers,394gg3,TheFilmGod,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"The truth is, this prevents people from just getting a house in New Brunswick for 4 years, then being able to claim that they now live there (given that it's their primary residence). Since pretty much anyone from out of state would be doing that anyway (can't quite commute from Arizona every day), being able to do that would blur the lines compeltely between an in-state and an out-of-state student.  What is interesting is that you can provide a reason other than attending school - it's not that going to Rutgers disqualifies you in some way, it's just that you need another reason. They'll probably be very skeptical if you say you came here for your minimum wage job, but maybe you can say family reasons or something and see if that gets you anywhere. I don't know of anyone who ""lied"" to get in-state tuition, but given the money savings, it may be worth trying."

rutgers,394gg3,d3adlyg0d,-6,Tue Jun 9 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. Will take AT LEAST one year. I think realistically you can gain residency after 3 semesters. It's definitely an RU Screw. May need to work outside. Prove you're not just a fulltime student. Otherwise, all students would do this.  EDIT:  Obviously not an Ru Screw in the literal sense. However, a lot more goes in the overall equation than the administrative code and state law. For example, going from out-of-state tutition to in-state in the middle of the year (from fall to spring) is not always possible even though you may legally qualify based on state law. (So call it whatever you want).  In regards to residency, I highly recommend reaching out to Rutgers directly. Google is also your friend. A good resource to check is NJIT's residency explanation. Rutgers will vary a bit but the state laws and adminstrative code is the same.  Taken directly from that page:  ""To establish residency in NJ you must show: (1) a physical abandonment of your previous domicile, together with an intent not to return to it and (2) actual presence in New Jersey with the intention of remaining permanently in the state for reasons other than attending school.""  This means you will need to take on a full time job, get married, or have some other valid reason that justifies your intention of remaining there (here) permanently.  Interestingly, you can appeal for in-state tution based on numerous conditions. See this rutgers page:  Hope this help. Good luck and keep us posted on how it goes!"

rutgers,392r9k,aleksanne,2,Tue Jun 9 13:20:52 2015 UTC,Thank you. That's what I thought but I kept seeing the two names thrown around. Do transfer students get last pick or something?
rutgers,392r9k,aleksanne,2,Tue Jun 9 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, transfers get last picks, though it is nearly guaranteed you will get something. The left-overs are not bad. I was able to score a roomy apartment on Cook (my preferred campus, but others dont like it) 2 years ago."

I definitely recommend LLCs because they often come with a lot of extra benefits--we had private tutors come directly to our dorms every week on a set schedule for common classes like chem, calc, precalc, bio, physics. That was the most valuable thing to me. Also you do have to occasionally participate in some group activities but it's not that big of a deal if you dont and i do think it helps with making friends.  Also, BEST hall is WAY nicer than the towers. I like busch and livi about equal (I lived 2 yrs on busch, 2 on livi). But BEST is a pretty new dorm, you will have your own bathroom that you share with one other bedroom, but youll have to clean it yourself (I still personally feel that it's better to have your own bathroom that you need to clean/take care of rather than deal with the literal shitstorm of hall bathrooms..communal bathrooms are really not fun and if you can avoid them, why not? BTW youll have communal bathrooms in the towers. Also I dont think the towers have air conditioning, but BEST does.)  If you are interested in BEST apply immediately because living learning communities are filled on a first come first serve basis I think. They may do a phone interview, they did for me. You had to get accepted, pretty much."

The book may look intimidating, but this is not self-study - you will be taking the course with an instructor.  What you can do then is contact the instructor for the course (see 640:517 Fall 2015) and double-check with them.  Han is a pretty nice guy, and he should be able to answer your questions."

Basically you would get an adviser from each major and work on a topic that combines both fields. Here's the link to read up on it. That being said, let me know if you have any general thesis questions since I just finished mine.

In terms of the work load, it depends on a) who you work with, b) what sub-area you're working in, and c) the originality of the proposed idea (i.e., did you propose a study yourself or did your adviser give you data so that you could perform a secondary analysis on it and write that up). In my case, I was putting in 40-50 hr. weeks, but this is not representative of the average psych honors student. Feel free to pm me for additional info."

rutgers,38h35c,CardinalAmbition,3,Thu Jun 4 04:21:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, one visit counts counts as a swipe regardless of how much food you eat. They don't see how much food you eat.

As others have said, you'll have a lot left over at the end of the year. The 210 plan got me about 1.5 meals a day on average, this with eating breakfast daily for 2/3 of my second semester there."
rutgers,38h35c,ishiz,3,Thu Jun 4 05:07:29 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with this. I'm a rising sophomore and I had doubts that 210 meals was enough but once I got to school I realized it's still a lot of food. There are lots of times where you want to buy fast food or don't have the time to eat. Last semester I had 90-100 swipes left when I moved out and the semester before that I had 70 swipes left.  The 210 plan gives you an average of 2 meals per day. Even if you eat 3 meals a day at home, since there is unlimited food at the dining hall, you can easily get used to eating 2 big meals a day instead and save yourself money."
rutgers,38h35c,litecoinminer123,2,Thu Jun 4 05:13:51 2015 UTC,"Can confirm the 210 is plenty, and I'm a guy who eats 3 meals a day. You'll find on the weekends you're getting pizza with friends, driving to McDonalds, etc. etc. You'll also wake up on the weekends at noon after drinking, so you'll only have 1-2 meals anyway. During the week you might just have oatmeal or a power bar for breakfast instead of spending a half hour or more at the dining hall.  tl;dr the 210 should be PLENTY.

rutgers,38h35c,MutatedSpleen,2,Thu Jun 4 14:50:19 2015 UTC,There is 0% chance they will ever let meal swipes rollover unless there is some law requiring it passed.  They make way too much money from people wasting meal swipes.

rutgers,38gupj,wscuraiii,2,Thu Jun 4 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"Freshman registration for the School of Engineering is different than any other students. As a SOE student they sort of just give you a schedule they made for you (based on my friends who are in SOE). I'm in SAS and they ask you to choose what classes you want to take, and Intro to CS is on the list.  Intro to CS is not a requirement for the ECE major (check the ECE website), but equivalent classes are. Intro to CS is aimed at people who have never programmed before and teach you enough Java so you can take Data Structures. The ECE major has intro programming classes you must take as well but they are more advanced and teach more in my opinion.  You can change your schedule during Add/Drop to add in the ECE computer classes, or you can even add in Intro to CS if you wanted to (good luck, it's always full)."
rutgers,38gupj,ishiz,3,Thu Jun 4 05:26:37 2015 UTC,"There's equivalent classes in ECE, but they're second/third year and honestly not as good. If you're interested in programming / maybe even majoring in CS, you'll have to register for it yourself."
rutgers,38gupj,Stupidenator,2,Thu Jun 4 06:15:51 2015 UTC,"I just graduated from SOE with a major in ECE and a second major in CS. Here's what you can do...  Consult the undergraduate handbook as early as possible if you'd like to do something like I did. It outlines how to do it somewhere in there and if you don't figure it out quick enough it'll be impossible to finish in 4 years just because of the way prereqs work out.   If you want to just take some CS courses, programming methodology 1 & 2 along with any labs they have associated with them can be replaced with CS 111, 112, and either 213 or 214. These are the beginning CS courses like Intro to CS, Data Structures, and systems programming. This can also help you get the second major, however, if you start doing this you need to take all 3 CS courses, you can't just take 111 then switch back to PM2.  You won't really have the opportunity to do this until about the start sophomore year though just because the engineering course schedule doesn't have much wiggle room. You can also take just 111 as a tech elective or something further down the road if you want too.   Let me know if you have any other questions!"
rutgers,38gupj,Jarfdee,2,Thu Jun 4 11:06:55 2015 UTC,"Since from the way you're talking, it seems like you might be a bit confused -- I want to point out that CS and computer engineering are very, very different.

He didn't say anything about race. B&E, muggings, stabbings, car theft, sexual assault, murder. This is what happens when it gets hot, and I'm not even talking about when the bars let out. My sister in law was pregnant two summers ago when two guys tried to break into her window at my brother's apartment. Thankfully we were right outside with things to use as weapons. A few weeks ago a good friend's sister was murdered by a 16 year old kid in a friend's apartment. None of this is to scare you, it's just all true. Welcome to Brunz, be careful."

It was more of a freak thing compared to the dozens of muggings and assaults that are more characteristic of NB.   But I agree with your comment.  New Brunswick has always been a dangerous place, take a look at these stories:  http://nypost.com/2004/03/10/triple-rape-shocks-rutgers/  http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2014/10/nj_supreme_court_denies_convicted_new_brunswick_rapists_request_for_new_hearing.html  There have been a number of rapes and murders of Rutgers students in the past 15 years alone, not to mentions hundreds of muggings and house robberies. George street is definitely nice and the new developments definitely make the city look better but you're probably not going to have a safe community with these statistics: ""About 15.5% of families and 25.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 25.4% of those under age 18 and 16.9% of those age 65 or over."""

rutgers,38bsdn,LifeHated,3,Wed Jun 3 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"The Newark campus isn't that big.. the B-school is at the North end of the campus,  the south end is Medical & Registrar.  Maybe 8 blocks between them.   Free parking is very limited.   There are some residential parking spots - no meters - in the area,  but one side of the street is residential permit only. Construction in the area means that there is more competition for all on-street parking.   You need to check the minor side streets, and scout the area early.   Sweepers come through as early as 8 am, so if you can wait until after 8.. you can park after the sweeper & ticket-issuers pass.      Newark puts a lot of resources into parking enforcement.   It is profitable for them.    Don't think you'll get away with anything.  Some of the area's ""normal"" paid lots offer a discount with your student ID.     If you can get away with only paying once a week, it might be worth it.. otherwise, just get the permit.   Note - the permit in Newark is just a ""fishing license"".   They don't guarantee you a parking spot - just the right to enter the parking lot/s to look for a spot.    During the summer, you shouldn't have trouble actually getting a spot.    Once things get busy again near September,  you may as well ride a unicorn and park that on the street in a free space."
rutgers,38bsdn,rewardiflost,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:12:01 2015 UTC,I took a few classes in Newark and if I recall there are meter spots along the street behind the Paul Robeson center that are usually open.
rutgers,38bsdn,ddiiggss,2,Wed Jun 3 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"True, and during the summer, meters will be open all around.   But even if you feed the meters - they can and occasionally do write tix for the maximum time.      If you aren't going to be there all day, not a big deal.    It isn't as bad as Hoboken, where you get 2 hours to park on any calendar day - at any spot in the city.  Still, those tickets add up.    I've seen three separate patrols checking meters within an hour.  Also keep your eyes out for the droppings left by mounted patrols.  They really make a car smell cozy in the heat & humidity."
rutgers,38bsdn,rewardiflost,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:52:39 2015 UTC,But even if you feed the meters - they can and occasionally do write tix for the maximum time.   Put quarters in the meter and then use Parkmobile to re-up your time before the expiration of the meter?
rutgers,38bsdn,dsatrbs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:17:46 2015 UTC,"From Parkmobile:    You are able to extend your parking time, if you see that you need more than the amount you initially paid for, as long as you haven't already chosen the maximum allowed. In order to extend a transaction it must still be active and not yet expired. Example: if the maximum is 2 hours, and you chose 1 hour, you can then extend your session before it expires for up to an additional hour. Note that extensions are separate transactions, and therefore each extension carries a transaction fee as well.   And, all the meters are a maximum of 2 hours.   While you might fool them if you alternated 2 hours quarters / 2 hours Paymobile / and quarters again.... when/if they drive by with license plate readers,  you can still get the ticket for exceeding the 2 hour maximum.   Hoboken has been doing this - 'virtual chalking' for years. Other towns are using license plate readers, not all for parking enforcement - yet.   Parking fines aren't terrible compared to NYC, but definitely not cheap.   Either $35              23:5-5     Parking Prohibited To Two Hours     $35          or $45       23:7-6     Overtime Parking At Meter   $45   Good luck.  The system can be beaten for a while, but they just make it more expensive and harder to beat."
rutgers,38bsdn,rewardiflost,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:55:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I was talking about alternating quarters and paymobile. I had no idea about the virtual chalking and license plate readers! Ughhh.

rutgers,38bsdn,drderpderpenstein,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:38:07 2015 UTC,Do not rely on finding any type of free parking near campus.  Most of the parking outside of the decks is either metered or residential parking.  If you are lucky to find a metered parking spot you can download the parkmobile app to pay for your spot without having to walk there.  Parking at Rutgers Newark is skill and you will get better with experience.

They care that the D shows that you stopped putting in the effort as the school year came to a close. That doesn't reflect well on your dedication as a student.  I can't say whether or not you will get rescinded, but if you're concerned you could try calling admissions to see if there's anything you can do to help your situation.   It's getting harder and harder to get into this school.  More qualified students are applying every year who take it very, very seriously, and don't just decide to stop showing up ""because senioritis.""    It's not a safety school so stop treating it like one."

It's not a safety school so stop treating it like one.   I understand what you're saying, but I just wanted to point out that I didn't stop putting in effort, it's just that that last semester I started working full time as well taking some pretty difficult courses which made things harder. Not that I'm trying to excuse my poor performance.  I get what you're saying though, and I appreciate the insight. Thanks."
rutgers,384cd5,airial,5,Mon Jun 1 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, I respect that. I worked full-time through school so I know how hard it can be.   My advice is to be proactive about it and contact the admissions department. Explain your concerns, that you started working full time as well as taking more challenging courses, and see where the conversation goes.  It never hurts to open a discussion and at least they'll know why your grades shifted instead of just assuming, like I did."

rutgers,384cd5,airial,11,Mon Jun 1 20:09:26 2015 UTC,"Downvote me all you want, kids, but again: this is not a numbers game.  3.0 is not some magical cutoff number that ensures you stay at RU.  You are not a GPA.  You are a student.  A student who will, if you go to Rutgers, one day be representing them and the quality of the education you received there.  If you show to them that you are a student who doesn't care too much about maintaining his/her level of commitment to school since you've already gotten into college, what do you think that says to them about the kind of student you will be at Rutgers?  It shows that you don't care.  They accepted you based on the level of dedication and the quality of grades that you showed when you applied.  If your performance in your last semester flies in the face of that of the student they accepted then I would be wary.    You have no idea how many more people apply to this school every single year.  Remember that kid who got into all the Ivy leagues but ended up going to a state school because it was more affordable? Those kids are your competition now. And those kids don't fail their last semesters.   Rutgers is going to get more and more choosy as time goes on."

rutgers,384cd5,airial,4,Mon Jun 1 20:22:55 2015 UTC,You're probably fine. C is nothing to worry about.   Failing is something else entirely.   A lot of high schools haven't even ended yet and won't until mid- to late-June so if there is a timeline it's a long way off. I can talk to my admissions person and find out.
rutgers,384cd5,kpatrickII,2,Mon Jun 1 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm a transfer. Does that make a difference? And I haven't failed anything. One would assume they would let me know before my STAR day, which is June 5th."

I personally found the class to be interesting and rather easy and you might so too.  Design and Media are really great. but design is a lot more fast paced and structured.  Photography is fantastic but it really depends on your teacher. You're probably going to get a grad student so the syllabus is a little more flexible with your personal interest. It's not really hard to get a good grade.  Sculpture is wonderful if you want to get your hand dirty and its a very creative class. While you learn certain techniques and focus on specific mediums within sculpture, you are free to express your own creativity and explore.    Let me know if you have any more questions!"
rutgers,37yosb,woodlandpixie,1 point,Sun May 31 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"Hello! Thank you for the detailed response! How about visual thinking B and art history 104 and 105?   Currently I have the option to do the art minor (Which is 22 credits strictly having the art history classes, drawing fundamentals classes, visual thinking A/B and drawing II) or I can just take 3-4 art classes around my areas of interest. I won't get any minor/recognition that way but I can take Sculpture and photography (Both of which sound amazing to me). Any advice on that?"
rutgers,37yosb,woodlandpixie,2,Sun May 31 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"Visual Thinking B is in color so if you love working with color then it would be a great class! You do a lot of fun activities with color aid to learn about color theory and stuff and the assignments are a little more straightforward than Visual Thinking A.  Yeah, the minor is extremely structured. If you truly want some recognition for your art then I would suggest going for the minor. Maybe after fulfilling the courses required for the minor you can take sculpture and photography if you have the space in your schedule. But at the same taking 3 or 4 classes that you're genuinely interested in sounds like an exceptional idea, sadly you won't really get any solid recognition for doing that. To me, I would go for the minor just because I would want some recognition for my work.   But it's really up to you to choose between receiving a minor or just taking classes that you're interested in and not getting a minor."

First reaction is jump on /r/Rutgers to ask what happens if avoid being an honest person and pay the ticket you received.   The worst thing I've heard happen is a warrant can be put out for the person who is the registered owner. I heard a story from a guy who was out in backwater Florida and had unpaid tickets in my state. He gets arrested and the cops wanting to be dickheads held him for a few days until he hired a local lawyer ($$$) to talk to a judge (court fee $$$) to set up a payment plan for his tickets in a state that wasn't even his ($$$$$$$). Oh yeah and they charged him for holding his car ($$$$$$$$$).  Don't be an asshole and pay your ticket so bad things don't happen and the ghost of Henry Rutgers doesn't RU Screw you.

rutgers,37t778,gluuue,3,Sat May 30 04:52:15 2015 UTC,"I actually just graduated as a double major in Marketing and Economics. I know some people who for one reason or another weren't in RBS but pursued Econ as an alternative to Finance as well as others who doubled majored in Econ and Finance. For them, Econ complimented their Finance degree. I do agree with you that some Econ professors aren't amazing. My friends who majored in Finance talked a lot about really liking some of their professors, so there is a plus side in that. RBS also has a lot of resources with career management, I'm not too familiar with what SAS offers actually since I entered Rutgers as an RBS student.   In my experience with the job hunt, many recruiters for Finance entry level positions (like middle/back office) were looking for non Finance majors actually to get a more diverse group of employees. I got a full time offer in a finance job but beyond Into to Financial Management I've never taken a Finance class. For me, it was a combination of networking and having a relevant internship to financial services. However, If you're dead set on working in a front office role, then I would recommend going for Finance.   If it's a possibility, I'd say to pursue both majors but if you're not looking to stay that long I think you could be able to do fine as an Economics major. You can use this year to look for a job- why do you say you have little to no prospects for one? Go on CareerKnight and apply for as many jobs as you can. Ask your friends/network. Keep in mind that, if you do drop Econ for Finance, that not all companies could extend you a full time offer upon completion of your internship regardless of how great an intern you were. Also, it's great that you want to bump your GPA to a 3.5 but again, in my experience your GPA isn't going to be a large part of the hiring decision unless it's really really bad. A plus to going for your major in Finance would be that there's probably better professors and you could buy more time into developing your professional network. There's a lot of pros either way, it's really up to you how serious/passionate you are about finance!"

I don't think there are many women at all who would think differently than you here.  Stopping and picking up a random man is putting yourself in a needlessly dangerous situation.  This isn't really a problem for men, though.  We don't typically have to worry if the person we're about to give a ride to - especially if that person is a woman - is going to try to hurt us.  Sure, we might entertain the thought of an axe-murdering hitchhiker for a minute, but not in a serious way, and we know that perceived danger becoming reality is very unlikely.  Women are hurt because they don't get to feel safe.  Men are hurt because they lose an opportunity to receive help in a way they might need.  This culture hurts everyone."

rutgers,37lpj3,AnaPins,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:26:19 2015 UTC,"While you might actually end up giving a fellow Rutgers student a ride, I think it's easy for a lot of people to say how they'd react in certain situations. I tend to be very paranoid and cautious of my surroundings, carry pepper spray, lock the doors as soon as I get in the car, those sorts of things. I don't generally help strangers, whether they need a ride somewhere or need a phone to make a call or need $3 for a train ticket.   As a big guy, people tend to poke fun at me a lot for this. It reminds me an instance when I was looking for apartments, and the girl subletting a place asked that I give her my phone number. I was honestly hesitant to give my phone number to a stranger, and felt that we could easily have communicated via Facebook messaging as we had been doing. Though the feedback hinted that this was not the most acceptable course of action or state of mind for me, a guy, to have.   It seems to stem from the general assumption that on the streets at night, public transit at night, or the generally shady places, guys are big and strong and can handle themselves."

Tip: every parking lot has a sign at the entrance and it specifies who parks there (like commuter, resident, fac/staff, some will say ""PERMIT ONLY"") --if it says permit only, that means you need a permit for THAT one lot and if you dont have it they will ticket you. There is a lot of misinformation being spread around about parking, because people park somewhere and get lucky a few times and think that means they never check those lots. They actually ticket by permit only lots more frequently because they are smaller and only meant for the people that work in those buildings. How do I know all of this? I have had friends who did security here (they issued parking tickets), also I read up a lot on parking rules because I dont like paying out the ass for tickets.  Be aware they can run your plates, and even if you have never gotten a parking pass here before, it will show you are a student and it will give you a financial hold. Your best bet is parking in the visitor lot (lot 48), although you are probably still at risk for tickets, it is a far lower risk than any other lot on Busch because you need permits for the others, and they do ticket them every day."

rutgers,373ws9,rentonwong,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:04:58 2015 UTC,Finance and Accounting are the core RBS majors; everything else is worth fuck all.

rutgers,373ws9,litecoinminer123,1 point,Mon May 25 02:25:39 2015 UTC,As said before RBS tends to dedicate more resources towards Finance and Accounting majors compared to other non-core majors.  Graduates from non-core majors getting great starting salaries may also come from other factors outside of RBS.
rutgers,373ws9,rentonwong,0,Mon May 25 04:51:00 2015 UTC,"Does the RBS really invest as much resources to the non-core majors as Finance and Accounting as in the past?  Also, the BAIT and SCM majors that landed good jobs with great salaries may not have got it through the RBS alone.    Aren't you the one who kept saying networking was a major factor in getting great jobs and the large starting salaries?  Didn't others also point out that internships, prior experiences, and luck also playing a part in that?"
rutgers,373ws9,dsatrbs,-1,Mon May 25 04:49:41 2015 UTC,"Networking is a major factor, but RBS brings in big companies to host networking events. The big4 were on campus many times over just one semester to hold events. A number of I-Banks were also here for networking and internship opportunities in back office roles.  As far as those that ""may not have got it through the RBS alone"", that's true. But I know most in BAIT did get their jobs exclusively through RBS and OCR (on campus recruiting)."
rutgers,373ws9,TheIronGoat,2,Mon May 25 13:27:00 2015 UTC,So the other majors don't really count for much?
rutgers,373ws9,ynksrule93,0,Sun May 24 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"Relatively less than the core majors.

Finance is hit or miss (could be $90k or could be $30k - depends on your networking and experience). Don't make blanket statements because you don't know shit."
rutgers,373ws9,litecoinminer123,1 point,Mon May 25 13:32:12 2015 UTC,"Your response would make sense if the non-Core RBS majors only involve BAIT or Supply Chain Management.  What about Management or Marketing majors?  As you've pointed out, starting salaries are a hit or miss.  The same also applies to other majors such as BAIT or SCM.  One still needs experience and networking to secure the better salaries and work.  Nice try."
rutgers,373ws9,rentonwong,2,Wed May 27 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much true, I think they're probably the most popular majors.  The supply chain program is pretty well regarded, though.

Some people I know said not to take both intro macro and micro together but to be completely honest it really isn't bad at all.  It really depends on what year you are, so if you're a sophmore/junior then you really should be taking them together to make sure you can get all the required classes done.  On top of that I'm assuming that the other gen ed classes you're taking won't be that difficult so its completely doable.  I would suggest taking intermediate micro, macro, and econometrics all separately though.  Econometrics is generally considered to be one of the tougher economics classes but its really just a lot of stats so if you're good at that kind of thing it shouldn't be that hard.  Intermediate micro has basic calc in it (derivatives for the most part) and I personally thought that intermediate micro was the easiest of the three."
rutgers,36xmhc,poiuytre55,1 point,Sat May 23 02:25:10 2015 UTC,Thank you! I know everyone says intro classes are easy but I feel that's redundant because college students can say high school was easy but people still had to work hard or struggle to get good grades so it's a matter of perspective. Would it be a lot of material to take micro and macro together? What science class would you compare it to so I can get a feel for the amount of material lol. Thank you so much again!
rutgers,36xmhc,TalkBigShit,1 point,Sat May 23 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"amount of work depends on the professor. I just finished my freshman year. I took Macro in high school, micro and calc first semester, then both intermediates second semester. i passed all those classes with a C+ or higher and i didn't go to any of them."
rutgers,36xmhc,jedale,2,Tue Jun 2 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"Just graduated with honors in economics.    Your economics major starts with intro to macro and micro. You can take these together. Then you have to take intermediate micro, macro and econometrics. Then you have all of the electives. Note that econometrics and intermediate micro are prerequisite for most upper level electives. Macro isn't, so you can get by with taking that one later.  Before taking the intermediate classes you will need some math. Basic stats and calculus would be good. If you can get a more rigorous stats class even better. Econometrics has a rough reputation because it's built on top of statistics, if you have a good stats background then it is much easier.    Now, from a practical point of view: why economics? What do you imagine you're going to do with the degree? Yes it's kind of versatile, but it's also like the second or third largest major in SAS, so you're not exactly a unique snowflake, employment wise. If you are just going to be content to skate through with a 3.0 I am not sure it's the best use of your time and money. I would strongly suggest pursuing the certificate in quantitative economics. Most Econ classes are kind of broad surveys of a given sub field of economics that won't translate directly into skills employers want. The CQE on the other hand very much does. It's a bit extra work (some extra math, stats, and a programming class) but in terms of making you employable it's well worth it. T"
rutgers,36xmhc,jedale,1 point,Sun May 24 13:08:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, and of course you need a minor. Some you should consider:   math if you want to pursue an Econ Ph.D. statistics computer science finance operations research (not sure ru offers this as a minor)"
rutgers,36xmhc,petewinz,1 point,Sun May 24 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"Economics major here. Taking intro micro and macro together would not be hard at all. If you can bang that out next semester along with stats I, you can get started on your lower level (3 required, only intro econ pre-reqs) economic requirements. If you choose the right ones, they can be easy to get by with a B or B+ (A if you put in a little effort). Upper level courses (some require econometrics + intermediate micro or macro, others require econometrics + both intermediate courses) can be difficult but it all depends on the class.   Once you finish your intro courses, intermediate micro and macro is what I suggest taking separately. I took intermediate micro, econometrics, and a few lower level economic classes in one semester which turned out to be my heaviest semester yet so I probably would suggest taking either one of the intermediate courses + econometrics so you have the pre-reqs to get started on select upper level courses if you wanna get ahead. Or you can take them all separately which should still leave you enough time (granted you're heading into your sophomore year which it sounds like) to finish everything up before you graduate."
rutgers,36wicw,helpmerueng,7,Fri May 22 18:23:08 2015 UTC,"I was on probation for a semester during my undergrad in 2008.  Just do better, honestly, and you'll be fine.  Figure out what you did badly this semester, and change that.  If you were skipping classes, stop skipping classes.  If you weren't studying, start studying.  If you were going out every night instead of doing school work, stop doing that, etc.  Find out what the problem was and fix it.  You're an adult, your parents are no longer in charge of your life.  This isn't like high school where your parents have to sign your report card and have parent-teacher conferences.  They will probably send a physical notification of probation to your mailing address, but it will be addressed to you, not your parents.  If your parents open your mail, then they'll know, otherwise, it's on you to tell them.  Nothing explicitly ""happens"" during probation.  You don't have special meetings or anything to attend.  It's just a status.  If you continue to do badly, you'll eventually get kicked out.  There might be some secondary consequences such as only being able to register for a certain number of credits (my undergrad school limited probation students to 15 credits per semester until they proved they could handle more), and loss of financial aid (don't expect merit-based grants and scholarships).  The TL;DR - do better, and you'll be fine.  Maybe decide if you're in the right major if you are having this much trouble.  Remember: college gets harder the longer you are in it.  If you are failing early classes, it's going to take serious change for you to do better in harder classes."

rutgers,36wicw,IHCaraphernelia,1 point,Fri May 22 18:48:47 2015 UTC,I was on Academic Probation and Deferral Dismissal!  Statics and chemistry classes killed me!  Don't worry it gets better and more interesting as the years progress.  I think you will find statics much easier the second time around. Just keep up with the homework and pay attention in class.  I did the same thing as I walked out of my statics final the 1st time taking it because I couldn't do it.  2nd time I got a hard earned B! Dynamics is rougher and if you could I would recommend taking that in the summer right after statics if it is possible.  You want to get it over with!  I now have my undergrad and graduate degree from RU engineering :) ... you will be fine!
rutgers,36wicw,USAthrowaways,1 point,Fri May 22 19:53:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I was on probation too. The grade just replaces with the new grade after you retake the class. So that's nice. You should know that if you fall back into probation again they don't kick you out automatically. I read so otherwise but my advisor said that was not true.
rutgers,36wicw,we_started_the_fire,0,Fri May 22 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"Basically it means if your grades don't show improvements over the following year you'll be at risk of getting dropped from engineering. It's not too uncommon, basically try harder, study more and you'll be okay."
rutgers,36wicw,Darth_drizzt_42,-1,Fri May 22 22:29:45 2015 UTC,"Seriously, just consider studying something that YOU want to study. Not what your parents, or community expect you to study. And think of it this way: graduating with good grades in a field you love, but that isn't Engineering, or pre-Med, or pre-Law, is much better than not graduating at all. And heck, you might even end up in a career that you'd love for the rest of your life."
rutgers,36wicw,budna,3,Fri May 22 22:13:44 2015 UTC,"Every engineering student has to take statics despite the fact that it isn't all that applicable to most of their majors. It's very possible that OP is interested in his major; he still has to take a few of these required not-that-related courses (statics, matlab, expos, etc.) though."
rutgers,36wicw,TheForderator,4,Sun May 24 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"You are jumping to the conclusion that because OP failed a single class, that engineering is not their personal goal. I failed an exam in CS my first go because I was a stupid freshman who didn't know how rough testing is when I wasn't spoonfed the material for 8 hours a day. I withdrew, started studying, aced it the next time, and 10 years on I'm managing a tech function at a good company and happy with my focus. So OP failed one required class, so what? That's got little to do with their hirable skills."

Ive never known anyone personally who has done this, didnt even know it was a thing.  When you move in theres a Target and a Wal Mart and Marshalls all like 6-10 mins away from RU (depending on which campus you are on) and theyre all in adjacent shopping centers in South Plainfield/Piscataway. Everyone goes there to get dorm stuff. I did too! You shouldnt worry about everything fitting, as long as your sheets are Twin XL they will fit. (regular Twin wont usually!) Go there, get 2-3 sets of sheets, a bedspread, towels, a mini trashcan (they are provided for you too but you will find you will want one for near your desk for just paper and stuff), a lamp or two, a rug if you want, whatever. They have all that stuff and I guarantee it wil be WAY cheaper than the $240 or whatever the cost was on that website"

I know I've flipped through my mechanics of solids textbook a bunch for various formulas or explanations over the course of my degree. Even if you just get PDFs, they are great resources for the future.   As for the transcript, you can request it online, either for you to pick it up at the registrars office (on Busch campus) or have it sent to an address of your choice. I think delivery is about 7-10 business days, so it's not too bad.  I'm not sure how it works for summer students, but full time students can request 3 transcripts/semester for free, after which they cost $7 each. Or maybe it was 3/year.  Either way, it shouldn't bother you"

rutgers,36u3sa,Okmijnokm,2,Fri May 22 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly one of the best pieces of advice I can give you is make sure you apply early because a lot of schools engineering program is done on a rolling admission basis so it's a first come first serve type of thing. The earlier you get your stuff in the better the chances. Back when I applied the schools engineering programs i got into where the ones i applied to on time. I fucked up and did not apply to rutgers engineering program till about march although i applied to SAS on time and needless to say i did not get in. It's better to be in the school you want going into to school because things can sometimes get messy as far transferring from school to school goes because well it's easy to mess up in college and it's less pressure on your shoulders to worry about.   My advice would be to take the summer to start working on things for your top schools from your application to your essays and all of that. When the new school year starts use the beginning of the year to talk to your English teachers to help you proofread all your essays and make them top notch. Have your letters of recommendations ready, make sure that they are written well and have other people with strong writing backgrounds go over them, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO TELL A TEACHER/COUNSELOR or anyone to fix up your letter of recommendation because at the end of the day it is your life and your future.   Finally not to scare you of or anything but enjoy the process of applying to college because it is a time where your future is in your hands. If you really love a school and you do not get into the program you want then research how to switch into that program at that school and if you feel you are up for the challenge then by all means do it because it is your happiness and college is the beginning of a point in your life where you are able to concretely make decisions that enhance your future and make you happy."

As a transfer student you might find yourself isolated in dorms-- if you're placed in a freshman dorm you might not feel the need to mingle with lower-grade students and if it's an upper-grade dorm then most students may already have a set group of friends and it may be less social. If you were to choose an apartment you would perhaps be placed with 3 other students and you could perhaps get to know them very well and go from there (similar with a suite).  In terms of lifestyle, apartments have living rooms and kitchens for your convenience but also require more upkeep and coordination between your roommates and yourself; this may lead to problems. Dorms are simple to keep as you simply live in one room."

rutgers,36lxdr,RedditAccount_,1 point,Wed May 20 10:33:14 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot of good things about http://magoosh.com --but these are second hand (I didn't really have the money for classes and stuff, so I just used the internet to find whatever resources I could). Good luck! The GRE is an awful test, but super doable if you familiarize yourself with the kind of answers they expect. It's just a slightly harder SAT."
rutgers,36lxdr,savdec449,1 point,Wed May 20 14:20:43 2015 UTC,"First: Talk to the faculty/professionals you have worked with who will be writing you recommendations and discuss potential advisers and programs. This will give you a score to aim for, as less competitive programs care less about GRE scores. It will also let you get your scores sent ASAP.   Second: Sign up for the GRE's now, and purchase a cheap, yet recent practice book.  Skim through the practice book over the course of a week, then take an official practice test through ETS. When you get your score, use it to decide whether formal GRE prep is a worthwhile investment. Generally, you want an 80th percentile score or better for the Verbal and Qualitative sections.   Finally, consider whether a tutor or self instruction is your best option. Classes are largely worthless and a waste of money, so if you're gonna drop coins, do it through a private tutor."
rutgers,36lxdr,TheIronGoat,1 point,Wed May 20 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"I took the GRE last fall and did pretty well. I winged the math section (I'm in engineering so it was pretty straightforward for me), but I did some prep for verbal. As someone else said, magoosh is a good resource. I used their GRE flashcard app and that worked out well for me. There were a ton of words and I wasn't familiar with the vast majority of them, but I did flash cards on the bus to work every day for a summer and that set me up pretty well. As for the writing, I'd recommend doing some timed practice. I ran out of time for one of the written portions I had. It ended up working out okay for me, but it can't hurt too much to prep a little.   I'd recommend that you start preparing the verbal now at the very least. Maybe do some writing prompts and brush up on all the math a month or two beforehand. Obviously, the way you go about this will depend on your strengths - I'm very comfortable with math, and writing has been a significant part of my recent life. However, I just don't see very advanced English terribly frequently outside of technical terms in my field, so that needed more effort.   Also, register well in advance. Seats fill up quickly and you don't want to be scrambling in November to get your scores in to universities. I sat it in late September, but I'd recommend shooting for late August and having a back up registered for September/October just in case."

Pricey, but if you sign up for their email list you can get a promo for $200 off, which might help. Be aware that in the emails they'll say something like ""hurry! promo ends soon!"" but after one promo ends, another one begins a few days later, and it's the same $200 discount, just with a different promo code lol.  Princeton Review also has online classes that meet every week at a specified time with live instruction, and those are $799 ($599 with the discount)"

rutgers,36l1u6,commuterrutgers,6,Wed May 20 04:17:35 2015 UTC,"Join clubs and talk to people in class. It's going to be different compared to the people that live on campus but it's definitely doable. It will just take more effort on your part to make it happen. No one or anything will naturally facilitate the friend making process as a commuter, it's just something you're going to have to go out of your way to make happen."
rutgers,36l1u6,redditname123,2,Wed May 20 04:31:38 2015 UTC,From what I saw the commuter's corner or whatever was always packed with people. You'll find someone with common interests for sure.
rutgers,36l1u6,HockeyandMath,2,Wed May 20 11:17:08 2015 UTC,"I commuted for a semester for financial reasons and RU Screw-y reasons. Granted, I had friends from on-campus the previous semester, but it was fairly easy for me to make new friends the semester that I commuted.  Facebook helps a lot."
rutgers,36l1u6,xXxLinkinPark420xXx,1 point,Wed May 20 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"I would recommend you joining clubs of interest and doing activities of interest right out of the gate. There you can meet people with similar interests as yours.   Other than that, try to always be pleasant with people and down-to-earth. Don't be afraid to spark random conversations, either."
rutgers,36l1u6,mehmehmehmehmehMAH,1 point,Wed May 20 17:36:02 2015 UTC,"Like it's been said, It's going to take a bit more effort compared to just kinda naturally making friends in the dorms.  My first year I went to class and wen home and didn't make any friends.  The thing with clubs though is not only should you attend, but if you get along with people there, try to do something outside of the club.  I found friendships didn't really solidify unless we did something outside of the club.    And yea hanging out with the OCSA and going to their events is a good place since they are all commuters in the same boat as you.  Also leverage the fact that you are a commuter.  I made friends with a couple guys who lived on campus and I would give them rides since they didn't have a car and in return, they would give me tons of take out meal swipes since they had way more than they would ever need.  Over the course of college I saved hundreds of dollars in meals because of that arrangement.    Volunteering for the new student orientation is also a great way to make friends, not only because the training stresses teamwork with your coworkers, but because you will be talking to freshman who are in the same situation of being someplace new and hoping to make friends.    Personally I didn't make friends with the people in my classes.  Not saying it doesn't happen, but classes where you don't interact with each other as part of the course work, like big lectures require that much more initiative from you (I took mostly big classes)."
rutgers,36l1u6,JZBreeze,1 point,Wed May 20 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"I graduated a few years ago. I commuted all 4 years and had a lot of friends. Your college experience won't be the same as a lot of the kids in the dorms, but it's not that bad. You'll still get your chances to party and do dumb stuff, if that's what you're worried about.  The key is just to keep yourself on campus. Join clubs that interest you, go to school events that look cool, etc. Talk to people in classes and keep an open mind.   There is also a club for commuter students (OCSA). I don't know how it is now, but I was on the exec board for a little while and had a good time.  It's really intimidating to step out of your comfort zone like this, but trust me, it will really help you later in life.   Commuting really wasn't that bad for me IMO. You'll be fine, especially since you live 10 minutes away."
rutgers,36kuw5,paranoiafreak,4,Wed May 20 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"I thought CS 112 was a lot of work. A lot of students who breezed through 111 find 112 to be challenging. The programming assignments take a long time to do, as opposed to the ones in 111 which you could probably finish in a half and hour or less usually. Then there are the problem sets which aren't graded, but the exams are based on them and they'll all fairly difficult if you're not used to thinking abstractly.   CS 205 is an intro to proofs class. It starts off very basic with set theory and sort of tricks you into thinking it'll be an easy class, but it gets very hard if you've never seen proofs before (if you have, this class will be an easy A). It's a lot of work if you don't have a good professor or you're stuck relying completely on the textbook. I haven't heard anything about Chastain, the person teaching it this summer.  Personally, I'd take 205 over the summer and 112 in the fall. Steinberg is teaching 112 and I've never had him but I've heard he's not the best at teaching. 112 is an important class that really helps you learn how to think and the material shows up in later courses. It would be best to take it with Sesh or Tjang.   Taking them both at the same time during the fall/spring isn't so bad, but I'd advise against it during the summer when time is so limited."
rutgers,36kuw5,Schabernack,2,Wed May 20 05:04:06 2015 UTC,This is the right answer
rutgers,36kuw5,kevkev667,2,Wed May 20 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"205 over the summer wasn't too bad. Induction was the worst part of it because you need time to absorb the proofs and you just don't have it. Just get this and 206 over with asap.  Don't know about 112 but I'm assuming steinberg would be easier than sesh. I had him for 314, and his lectures weren't great because of his illness. 112 is basically the most important class next to 344, might as well take it in the fall to absorb it all properly."
rutgers,36kuw5,wildemu,1 point,Wed May 20 06:50:16 2015 UTC,"If for whatever reason you already have math 300 under your belt, take both."
rutgers,36kuw5,0x726564646974,1 point,Wed May 20 10:58:48 2015 UTC,"I'm doing it. There are a few parts that are complementary. For example, there's a section in the 205 textbook about the various search algorithms, which are heavily emphasized in 112.  Steinberg's really bad, but to be honest, if the material is not exciting to you in Parkinson's-voice, it won't be exciting to you in Sesh's dry sarcastic voice either. Just bite the bullet and take it as fast as possible (which is in the summer)."
rutgers,36kuw5,DropANukeOnBaltimore,1 point,Thu May 21 03:09:39 2015 UTC,yea i am taking 112 for sure in the summer but i couldn't decide about 205 as well

They have a lot of personal trainers there, although a bit expensive, they are VERY  good and very experienced. Also, as a member you get an initial free session with a trainer and you get to check back with them for free every three months. I love it there.   source: I am a member."
rutgers,36kcsz,superpony123,0,Wed May 20 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"While I still think it's a good idea to use a personal trainer to get the basics down, check out Bodybuilding.com's videos.

That being said, a fast phone and Wolfram Alpha can be just as helpful, and for Calc 3 you'll need 3d plotting capabilities, so you can do without the traditional TI-X graphing calculators."
rutgers,36jzit,pureatheisttroll,3,Wed May 20 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Generally if a course (in ECE at least) allows you to use your calculator, graphing calculators are allowed as well as scientific."

Likes to try alternative teaching methods and really tries to engage the whole class. Tries to get people really involved more than just reciting the philosophical ideas but really thinking and critiquing others viewpoints and even their own.   Intro to Philosophy is an easy class. Justin is an engaging but challenging professor. Do your work and really involve yourself in discussions and debates and you will do well. It's not an automatic A (at least judging by his other classes)

I saw a dad disown his son for cheating on a test and getting suspended.   You sit there, you can have an attorney present but it's not necessary, they will present their case and call witnesses to present the evidence, you can present evidence, the panel can ask questions, then the panel of students and faculty determines your fate. It always has to be more students than faculty on the panel.  There are sentencing guidelines depending on what you did and how bad it was. You can appeal to the dean if you have an issue with the outcome. It's basically like court but more informal."

rutgers,36fq24,rentonwong,0,Thu May 28 12:56:07 2015 UTC,Of course I graduated from RBS. I just don't devalue my degree because of cheating as you do. I also don't perpetuate the stigma that RBS is horrible because of cheating years after I graduated. But we all get by differently in life.  How was I being racist? I bring honor to myself everyday by working hard and setting the bar high. Idk how that relates to racism or if you're just looking to stir the pot.

Was that even necessary?  Casual racism isn't cool.  RBS cheaters getting caught is nice & good to see karma finally catching up to the school. Maybe this will help speed up the rate of improvement.  Used to be just finance and accounting were all that mattered in the RBS while non-core majors like management, MIS and marketing were ignored in terms of resources and FTL.  Now it looks like things are turning around with the introduction of SCM as an undergrad major and retooling MIS as BAIT.  Then again, the bar is low enough for meaningful improvement.  Its funny seeing as you're someone who mentioned that you did not really work hard in RBS but made a point about how networking, and building up work experience helped secure your first well paying job."

And I still believe that the key to a lucrative career in business is WHO you are as a person, not what junk you learned at business school.  My close friend just graduated from Wharton and is one of Forbes 30 Under 30 and we both agree on the fallacy that high grades in school equate to real world knowledge and experience. Thus I'm not looking to get my piece of paper from Rutgers to suddenly be a golden ticket. Most companies view RBS quite highly already.

They are both very interesting classes (see the physics website and class webpages to see what topics are covered in each class) and with your math and presumably physics background it should be very easy. It was not a particularly hard class (and im not a genius), there's usually homework due every other week and its just a problem set, youre encouraged to work in groups or with a partner. They are not really all that hard, you dont have to do extra reading outside class or really anything other than do the problem set (only a few problems). I usually met with my partner the day before it was due and we spent a couple hours working on them together. The problems were usually interesting and I made friends with my partner very quickly so we actually had a lot of fun doing our HW together. I never met anyone who was particularly stressed out about doing well in that class. Clicker participation counted a lot and so did homework so it's pretty easy to do well in this class."

If you think your grade should be changed because you're close to another grade, or because you really wanted an A but got a B, or because your mom will be mad you didn't get an A, or blah blah blah, those are shitty reasons and you don't deserve the grade.  You should have worked harder and done better during hte semester.  If you want your grade changed because you think one of your assignments was graded unfairly or incorrectly and is not an accurate representation of your skills or abilities, then that's something to discuss with the professor.  But if you pull up some assignment from February and talk about it now, they probably won't care because you should have done it when it first became a problem.  There are very few reasons why your grade should legitimately be changed.  A grading error, some form of discrimination (e.g., you were graded unfairly), unfair assignment policies (e.g., teacher tested you on something outside the scope of the syllabus and/or course), etc.  Those are valid reasons to ask for a grade change.  Asking for a grade change because of something that was YOUR fault is childish.  If you didn't do better because you decided to go out drinking instead of studying or because you slept through/didn't attend lectures, or because you thought you didn't need to buy the book...those are shitty reasons and you won't get your grade changed."

Being legitimately concerned about someone's state of health is not an insult, it's care.  I understand how someone with serious anger problems can interpret care as hostility though, it's actually pretty common.  Even if you did have mental health problems, that's not something to feel insulted over, and is absolutely not something I would ever insult someone about.  As you rightly pointed out, I'm studying to be a mental health professional.  It would be pretty fucked up if I insulted people because they had mental health problems.  Second, of course I didn't address your ""argument"" because you didn't provide one.  Your entire argument was based on logical fallacies that don't deserve recognition.  I'm not going to waste my time arguing with someone who only seems to be interested in trading insults and stroking their own ego.  I'm absolutely not joking at all, it seems to me that you have a problem.  You are extremely hostile to people you don't know who were not talking to you.  There are obvious differences between social interaction on the internet and social interaction in real life, but I find that people who struggle with one tend to struggle with the other as well.  I'm just saying that if someone came up to me in a professional setting displaying the kind of behavior you are currently displaying, I would do whatever I could to try to get them the held they needed."

That being said, you might simply request to see and discuss your final exam.  You could ask how close you were to the next grade; it may be that you fell near the bottom of a grade range, and several students above you received the same grade.   When the syllabus is clear on what your grade is, it might be difficult to argue for a higher grade.  Instead, you might ask your professor to explain why the grade you received is appropriate.

Over the years I have had department chairs explicitly tell me this, and have seen this to be the case.  So start with the prof.    Like 1piperpiping, I turned in my grades this past week.  In borderline cases the ones who made the most effort were the ones who got the benefit of the doubt, in the few cases where there was one.

I'm not a CS person, so I can't speak as to what CS 205 is like, but if you're not the type of person who enjoys proofs, then you might want to think twice before taking Math 300. This is essentially the introduction to proof-writing course. (You mention you took linear algebra. Think of the problems along the lines of proving a set is actually a subspace, where you have to write everything very precisely and not just rely on examples.) It's a different way of thinking, and can open your eyes to what math really is. It's not a bad course, but it doesn't quite fit in with what I'm guessing your goals and interests are.  As a CS major, you might also want to consider courses like Combinatorics (454) or Linear Optimization (354) - both would be very applicable to your field of interest.

The concerns I had with pursuing this was mostly financial, so I wanted to make sure it was definitely worth it. I do like proofs to a certain extent, but I am not a fan of extensive proofs such as those in number theory or something. But perhaps I should give more thought to whether I am truly interested in Math 300 before going ahead with it as you suggested. Linear algebra was not so bad, but then again, my teacher didn't really make us do any hard proofs. As of right now, a math minor is only the calc sequence, linear algebra, diff eqs, and three other electives. So, I am not sure if I can fit in the other courses, but I'll definitely look into them!"

Math 300 is a challenging course.  Despite its number, it is not the easiest upper-level math course.  Most students find it a tough course.    Over the past 5 years, 30% of registered students either withdrew or received a D or F.  The formal prerequisite for this course is 152.  However, it is better to have had at least one 200 level course.  This is especially true for transfer students: you are much better off taking some 200 level math courses at Rutgers before taking 300.  Students whose grades in 100 and 200 level courses are in the C or C+ range are strongly cautioned against taking this course.  If you are not planning on taking any  proof-based mathematics course you probably don't want to take Math 300.  If this is the last math course that you plan to take,  you should not take Math 300.  If you are just looking to fill a slot in your schedule  you should not be taking Math 300.""  And no matter what you decide, don't go any further than a minor in math."

rutgers,363y9w,NoblesseRex,2,Mon May 18 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"Intro to Math Finance is basically options pricing. I believe the business school offers a similar course, but the one offered by the math department is a little more rigorous.   The course felt like it was taught in two halves, first covering pricing in discrete - 1 step binomial tree, multi step bin trees, pricing vanilla, and exotics in discrete time - the second half being continuous time, culminating in the Black Scholes model.  The first half shouldn't be bad, but I've seen quite a few struggle with continuous time models, especially with digesting Ito calculus. But that being said, the class doesn't really deal with proofs at all. You should definitely take it if it's something that interests you. The professor teaching it will probably be Prof. Pham, who, in my opinion is a really good lecturer."

If I were to focus all my energy on academics it would've been possible. It depends on what you're priorities are and where you believe your energy is best spent.   Why do you want to double major in Finance and CS? I ask because it's usually the case that double majors have a career goals and I'll be able to give you better advice if I know.

Work load - using the rule of thumb of two hours outside of class in addition to one hour in class, you're looking at a commitment of 24 hours or so per week while the class is in session. You might have assignments due just about every single day.   That being said, you're getting smaller class sizes, and typically, instructors are only teaching one class at a time, so they can devote a bunch of time to helping you.

rutgers,3616rd,pureatheisttroll,3,Fri May 15 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"I took 481 with Naumova (who appears to be teaching again this year) last summer. It was... interesting.  Naumova is a very nice lady, but not the greatest statistics lecturer. I heard she is amazing for linear optimization (it's related to what she actually researches) and the calculus sequence. But for stats... she is not great. I think she even said on the first day of class that no one in the math department actually likes teaching 481. She didn't really seem to know the material well and lectures seemed very thrown together at the last minute. Sometimes she was just lecturing. Other times we were doing problems together as a class. Sometimes she would spend an entire class trying to derive a formula and it would be absolutely awful because the algebra gets so atrocious. Other times she would prove nicer theorems and it was really enjoyable.   The midterm was about half 477 material and half new material. It was mostly computation, but there were a few proofs. The average was very low so she wound up doing the ""Second Chance Club"" which is if you didn't like your midterm grade, you could go to her sometime before the final and do some sort of 'oral exam'. She would have you do some problems from the textbook and you would have to talk her through your reasoning. She made you do enough problems until it seemed like you understood what was going on. After this she would just 'take away' your midterm score from your final grade calculation. So, only your final exam and quizzes would count. My friend who got an 11% on the midterm wound up getting an A in the class. I did average on the midterm, did the SCC, and also got an A.  Also, apparently if you got an A on the midterm and had decent quiz scores, you were exempt from the final! Half the room was empty during the exam. Crazy.  If you really want to learn statistics, you should consider taking in during the fall/spring semester. If you want to have an adventure, take it this summer."
rutgers,3616rd,Schabernack,2,Fri May 15 18:59:00 2015 UTC,I'm gonna be taking 481 this summer. What parts of 477 would you recommend looking over?
rutgers,3616rd,notmike11,1 point,Fri May 15 19:11:30 2015 UTC,"You definitely need to know the basics of counting for sure. You also need to know all of the different distributions covered in 477 pretty well. Know how to plug things in or integrate to solve computational problems. You should also be able to derive the mean/variance/moment generating functions for some of the simpler distributions like binomial. I don't think the uniform distribution was covered in 477 (at least formally anyway) but it shows up a lot in 481, so take a look at it. Everything should be in the textbook or online. If you ever get stuck with the probability material, I recommend just looking at the 477 book or finding a pdf of ""The Probability Tutoring Book""  Also knowing what the graphs of the distributions look like is extremely helpful. I think there was even an exam problem that was basically, ""look at this graph, what distribution could it be?"" It also helps with some of the later material.  You spend a week or two reviewing 477 material, so if you're shaky with anything, don't worry too much about it."

I was preparing for actuarial exams at that time, and went to her office hours quite often (mostly with probability problems), and she was very helpful. I think for each class she offered a few days (2 or 3) when you could take the final, and I guess that the majority always chose the latest possible option.

The reason I bring this up before the difficulty is that ""how difficult"" something is should not really be a consideration if you are truly interested in the topic.  Now to answer your question: The professors aren't the best, they are actually in my opinion quite unprofessional.  There are prof's teaching classes that they have no business teaching due to the loss of other prof's. There are also classes that are just bad, and wouldn't be much better even with another prof unless the syllabus was overhauled. Overall, I'm pretty sour on the ECE department. The workload is not as bad as many make it out to be, but it is quite a lot relative to other majors, but if you are diligent about it, almost everything is relevant and worth learning.  That said, if I had to do it all over again, I would still go to Rutgers, and I would still study ECE.  It comes back to that first paragraph, Rutgers will open doors for you, and not just in engineering. You can get into consulting, banking, finance, and a slew of other fields. Rutgers is also one of the cheapest (if you are in state) options for a four year degree.

Realistically it's 6 of 1 half-dozen the other. I prefer NJTransit from Secaucus to Hoboken over PATH since It's only 1 transfer. If you take the PATH you'd need to transfer at Newark to PATH, then transfer again at Journal Sq. to get to Hoboken. Too many transfers."

The author of this article very deliberately avoided bringing up the football program's financials because it already is profitable. In 2014, the football program did not receive a single cent from student fees or university subsidies and finished the year with a $2M surplus. The $30M number mentioned in the article was spent on every other athletics team (besides men's basketball) which consistently operate in the red.   Athletics Department =/= Football Program"
rutgers,35pri5,mvd366,0,Tue May 12 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"Your comment is equally misleading because you are cherry-picking one year. While football showed an accounting profit in 2014, it made losses in pretty much every previous year. An n-year rolling average of football profits will show that it thus far it is a losing proposition for all values of n. Perhaps 2014 represents a structural change; it is too early to say so the reasonable assumption is that it was an outlier.   I am not against a subsidy to the athletics program and/or the football team; I just think we should be honest about what that's likely to entail. I get tired of the Pollyanna ""sports will be profitable in another x years"" argument where x is always the same value regardless of how many years have passed."

In regards to your edit: I agree with you to a point. The simple fact of the matter is that outside of Football and Men's Basketball, there aren't many athletics programs at any university that are profitable. I see both sides of this debate but it does get under my skin to hear university professors claim that shrinking the football program will free up money to be used elsewhere. If anything, doing so would result in a need for increased subsidies and student fees going toward these other sports programs.

Indeed, according to figures compiled by a faculty committee, Rutgers athletics is projecting a total deficit of $183 million between now and 2022.     Six years until we get a full Big Ten share......and we're projecting deficits until 2021.....which is.......six years.    I wonder if there's any relation there.  And $183 million over six years.  That comes to 0.85 percent of the school's budgets over that same time frame (probably less as the budget is sure to increase).    Oh my god what are we gonna do about that renegade 0.85% guys."
rutgers,35pri5,JayRU09,3,Wed May 13 03:21:35 2015 UTC,If it results in the athletic department being its own financial entity.....yes it is for a short time.    It's called investment.

rutgers,35pri5,pureatheisttroll,0,Wed May 13 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"And the investment has paid off with membership into the Big Ten.   We paid to leave the Big East and to enter the Big Ten.  That is the investment, not the pay-off.  Now we wait 7 years to see if all the budget predictions come true.  We can talk about whether the investment paid off then.  As to your above comment and the .85% computation, I've seen several people argue that because athletics takes up 1% of the budget this is less of an issue than most make it out to be.  Consider the following list of expenditures that comprise a few percent of the budget:  Libraries (1%), Student Services (3%), Housestaff Salaries, Fringes, Benefits (2%), Student Aid (7.3%), Operation and Maintenance of Plant (5.5%).  What difference would a one percent increase in student aid make?  1% can do a lot."

Athletics is the only department where the amount of profit it makes is important. University education shouldn't be about profit margins, it should be about academic merit and the strength of the academic program.  However, since the new direction this school decided to take, the budget cuts to just about every other department have caused many of the better faculty to leave for greener pastures where they won't be asked to teach twice the number of students with half the funds and 1/4 the support staff. Rutgers is constantly losing Professors and cutting programs, all this is while tuition and fees have risen drastically and everyone can see the increased spending on athletics. Talking to professors, it's depressing because every year, most departments have to cut more budget, let some non-tenured faculty go, cut classes that don't fill to capacity, and cut support services."
rutgers,35pri5,rockychunk,-2,Thu May 14 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"What’s more, the Rutgers athletic department has consistently run large deficits; indeed, since the 2005-6 academic year, deficits have exceeded $20 million a year. In the last academic year, Rutgers athletics generated $40.3 million in revenue, but spent $76.7 million, leaving a deficit of more than $36 million. In other words, revenue barely covered half the department’s expenses."
rutgers,35pri5,litecoinminer123,3,Tue May 12 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"If you do the math in the article, it says that the total annual budget is $3.6 billion. $36 million is exactly ONE PERCENT of the annual budget. So, if you totally eliminate the athletic budget, you gain one penny on the dollar.   And yet, morons like Nocera paint it as an ""Athletics vs Academics"" scenario, as if everything would suddenly get rosy as soon as athletics goes away."
rutgers,35pri5,rockychunk,-1,Tue May 12 15:41:09 2015 UTC,"Nonetheless that doesn't include all the capital expenditures that are being asked for both athletically as well as academically to bring our school into the Big Ten. We've been making our server room look prettier because we had people from other schools in the conference come look at it. They want to put in a new stadium that's up to competing with Ohio State. While that doesn't count in the $36 million deficit I'm sure it'll be quite a sizable sum. The moral of the story is we've focused on football more than education for a long time, because alumni come back for football games, not classes and research."
rutgers,35pri5,litecoinminer123,10,Tue May 12 16:15:07 2015 UTC,"First of all, nobody wants to ""put in a new stadium"". There is talk about expanding the current stadium, not building a new one. (Maybe you're thinking about the basketball arena, which is over 30 years old and badly needs either a long-overdue upgrade or a less-expensive replacement.) Secondly, any football stadium expansion will be paid for with bonds, just like the last renovation. Not a cent came out of the school general fund, and the bonds are being repaid through ticket revenue.   http://news.rutgers.edu/news-releases/2008/12/rutgers-board-of-gov-20081212#.VVIssozD8dU"

rutgers,35ocfz,dankimster,18,Tue May 12 04:32:03 2015 UTC,"First, hugs. You made it through today at least. Rutgers' Chem courses are hard.  There are a lot of people you can talk to here, if you want to. I'll mention CAPS right off the bat; you can call and do a very short phone interview, where someone will talk to you and arrange for you to meet with a therapist, one-on-one. CAPS only lets you do that for a year, though; after that, you can choose to remain at CAPS and do group therapy or find an outpatient program. Depression hurts. I've been there.  You can also of course talk to an academic advisor. I want to ask, though: do you really want to keep doing biology? Because you still can, if you want to; I don't know if getting two F's in a core class bars you from the major, but you can always always always try again. If money isn't that big of a deal, you can graduate a semester or two late, although take into account the cost of loans (if you have them), since that will add up pretty quickly.   I bowed out of the biology major a year ago, after getting a D in Orgo II. I'd also taken CS111 to fulfill a core SAS requirement, and I ended up really loving the class, and since I got a B+ in that, I happily switched majors. A year later, and... I probably failed Data Structures again (for a secular kid, I'm sure praying for a 500/1000 to be a C quite a bit). You are allowed to screw up in college.  Let me repeat.   You. Are allowed. To screw up. In college.   You are allowed to fail your chem final and you are allowed to fail a class twice and yes, it will make certain things harder for you to do in the future, but it will not completely ruin your life.   Okay?  Please go talk to someone. If anti-depressants worked for you, as you are 18, you aren't legally obligated to tell your family jack shit about what medications you're taking--nor are any medical providers diagnosing you. Don't let this defeat you--you've still got two years left! You can fight the fuck back if you really want to keep a bio degree, or you can kiss the Rutgers science departments goodbye and pick out another major (not all of them are so scary-intensive, and although you'll have a crowded few semesters, some can be done in two years).   Breathe. In and out. Chem sucks, failing your final sucks, failing a class twice sucks, depression sucks. But you're still here, and that's very telling about you. You can do it. Just be brave."

I heard the same stuff earlier from my mom, but hearing someone who is there is more effective than from a parent who never went to college. I bombed the DS final today. Filled out maybe a third of it. I didn't get to do much studying because of chem and calc II. Calc II, I end with a B+ which is amazing considering how far behind I was (took calc I three years ago at community college). I'm hoping for at least a high C for both DS and Chem II now. Better would be great...I mean, I got 130 and 138 on the first two DS exams. That final was just cruel as hell. I plan on spending my summer working as much as possible in every aspect to prepare myself for next semester. I really can't afford to fall behind. Without DS, I can't move on at all and it sucks.

On a side note, my friend got kicked out of Rutgers three times because of bad grades, and eventually graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering after getting his shit together. Not everyone has a smooth college experience. But maybe you should have a soul searching sit down with yourself and see if there is another field that you may be better suited for. Some people learn in diff ways, and a diff path may be more your style.   Or, see if there is any way to get a tutor, it sounds like maybe there are some concepts you may need help with, and the instructor's/book's methods aren't  cutting it."
rutgers,35ocfz,vinChilla,2,Tue May 12 05:23:21 2015 UTC,"Kinda in the same position as you. I failed Orgo II this semester when I was on the PA track with a major in evolutionary anthropology. Midway through the semester I decided this wasn't for me and changed my major to political science with a minor in economics. Don't be afraid to try something new. College is your chance to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life. From my own personal experience, I found that STEM majors kind of pigeon-hole you into one particular career path so I decided to switch to liberal arts so that my future still remains a little open-ended. If you really want to major in bio I think you should stick with it. If not, don't be afraid to research alternative options for yourself. You're not the first person to be in a shitty situation and you most certainly won't be the last and time and time again, people have gotten through it. Keep your chin up. You'll figure it out!"
rutgers,35ocfz,MutatedSpleen,2,Tue May 12 05:29:49 2015 UTC,"Two things:  First, school.  If you want to do something that requires chem, you have to pass chem.  I don't mean to say something so obvious to belittle you or anything like that, it's just a simple fact.  If you honestly believe you can't do it, that's okay, but you need to find something else you CAN do.  That's tough, and it takes a lot of work.  The other option, of course, is giving it another try.  If you do that, you have to find out what caused your problem with the class to begin with.  Did you go to all the classes?  Did you do the homework?  Did you ask for help when you needed it?  Did you study?  Did you attend office hours?  Did you REALLY study?  Those sort of things.  As you're well aware, the class won't pass itself, so you need to identify what was causing the problem, and fix it.  Second, depression.  I don't mean to come off rude here or anything, but fuck your family.  You're in college, you're an adult now.  They don't get to pick what you do and do not do to stay healthy.  Depression is a very serious problem and can absolutely (and very easily) derail you from an otherwise successful college career.  Fuck them for being ""against"" anti-depressants.  If meds are helping you, then they are against you getting the help you need, which means they aren't looking out for your best interest.  If they aren't looking out for you, you need to look out for you.  I don't want to force this to be about depression if that's not what you want to talk about, but if that's what is causing your problem (which is absolutely possible), then that is what you need to address.  If that means talking with your family and coming up with a solution, okay.  If that means doing what YOU need to do to solve it, then that's okay too.  But if this is directly contributing to your problems with school...it isn't going to go away on its own.  If it's causing you to fail chem, it's just as likely to cause you to fail any other class.  /u/theloneabalone said it pretty much perfectly.  You are in control of your life, even if it might not seem like it.  Do what you need to do, and do what's best for you."
rutgers,35ocfz,settingfires,1 point,Tue May 12 07:42:18 2015 UTC,I basically did the same thing my sophomore year too. You still have time to switch to another major. Do some research and figure out what you're good at. You still have time. Just work on trying to find what makes you happy.

As to your question about 2 Fs in your GPA: When you repeat a class that you failed, the  gradethe second time around is the one that stands; so as of now, there is only 1 F in your GPA. However, if you take chem again and get a higher grade, the F from this semester and the higher grade will both be averaged into your GPA. I'm not sure what school you're in, but this policy applies to both SAS and SEBS  Source: Both the SAS and SEBS websites say the same thing:   When a course is repeated in which the student previously earned a grade of “F” both the original grade of “F” and the new  grade remain on the transcript and in the cumulative grade-point average. However for up to 16 credits in no more than four  courses, the grade of “F” will be removed from the cumulative grade-point average if the student repeats a failed course and  earns a higher grade. The original grade of “F” will remain on the transcript with an E prefix attached: the repeated grade will  have an R prefix. This policy may be applied anytime during the undergraduate years, but only once for a given course.  The course must be repeated at Rutgers University. If the student fails the course a second time, only the second “F” will  enter the cumulative grade point average.

You can also write a program to check the schedule of classes for an opening in the section. This is what course sniper does. Course sniper scans the SOC every fifteen minutes and sends emails to students generally at the same time. If your program scanned just one minute faster than course sniper you are at a big advantage. Just don't be stupid and check every second or so. Also, make sure the section number your program sees as open is actually open on webreg. Sometimes the SOC json api has sections that they don't actually show on the page.

rutgers,35l8gq,Dstanding,2,Mon May 11 17:05:27 2015 UTC,+1. There is nothing for you on Cook.
rutgers,35l8gq,Heisenripbauer,3,Mon May 11 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"I would definitely go with Livingston. There are 4 campuses but it's easier to think of the campuses as two islands. Livi and Busch are right next to each other so they're on one island. College Ave and Cook/Douglass are a trip down George street from each other so they're on another island.   Livingston is where the Business school is located and Busch is the Engineering campus and the commute between the two is quick - unlike the commute between Cook and Busch - so I think it just makes more sense to choose Livi.  ALSO, Livingston is the freshman campus. I'm in my last year here and I lived in the Quads on Livi my freshman year. For years I've told people that it's the best campus for freshman simply because you're surrounded by other students in their first year and students that live in the Quads/Towers form really strong bonds from what I've seen (Every friend group that I know of, was formed in the Quads and Towers and they're still close as they prepare to graduate.) The apartments are great, but they don't have a strong community. Quads and Towers on the other hand only have a hallway/door to separate each other so naturally you become close with the people around you.  This is just my experience and what i've noticed but I really do recommend Livingston and see little benefit to you choosing Cook other than liking the campus' aesthetic."

Also take shortcuts by writing yourself a println method if you don't plan on concatenating strings. If you do run into that issue, you can always just declare and initialize a string to what you plan to print out and then still use your println method.  The little things should help you finish faster or keep up with the pace if you're a slow writer."

rutgers,35jo45,ruckgersbro,2,Mon May 11 06:19:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, i have no clue about the Big O stuff. Know how to do the efficiency analysis, like if it's a linear algorithm or stupid shit like that.  As for the shortcuts, I'll give an example as you've probably only been coding for a few months.  In my code, I'll write the method below.  public static void println(String s){ System.out.println(s); }  You would write this so when you have to print out any string, you can do it easily by just writing down println(""whateveryouwanttoprint"");. I figured out this shortcut myself when I thought about why I didn't do so well in the course and realized I was always bad at pacing myself during the problems. Sadly there is a flaw with the method and it has to do with concatenating strings. to get around it, try creating a new String variable.  String s = ""Hello "" + x "" world!""; println(s);  That's how you'll get around the concatenation issue.  Also remember when you're writing anything with curly braces, you don't have to put the ending curly brace on a new line. You can do it on the same line.  if(bool){println(""stuffs"");}  Stuff like that will save you a few seconds and won't completely ruin the page if you screw up on your code.   Let me know if you need help with any of the code. I'm not so good at the theory aspect like Big-O notation as I ignored that part of the exam cause I wasn't comfortable with it, however, I am pretty comfortable with java in general."

rutgers,35f5ib,rufsb,1 point,Sun May 10 19:36:54 2015 UTC,"That's beautiful; but when you get into the real world, the one that the university is preparing you for, you realize how incentives work when you're mostly focused on surviving. The kids who the stipends are really meant for, the ones who are up to their eyeballs in debt, just for the privilege of going to school (to ""engage"" with the university), already realize this. Power is not a dirty word, just because you can use it for dirty means.  I have a question, have you ever been to a RUSA meeting?   Shit is boring, you're not going simply out of the kindness of your heart, you're going cause you want to get something done, ideally it is altruistic. But that's not 100% of the case, and if only those with means could afford to participate in the student Gov't then eventually the university will reflect their will.  Here is an example for you, the Mayor of New Brunswick is a part-time job. And it pays ""accordingly,"" why is Cahill happy with being paid part-time (40k/yr) for so many decades, or his felonious uncle before him? Is it because of his sense of altruism and civic duty? No, it's because he gets plenty of side hustles for his position of power and by keeping pay part-time on what is clearly a full-time job means that many other potential candidates (the effectual, ethical types you assume are jumping at student gov't) back down because they know they can't afford, or at least would struggle, to live on the mayor's current pay. It's a criticism of Presidential pay as well.  I've known plenty of former RUSA members. I don't want to name names but one of your very recent student body presidents was also e.o.f, he couldn't have been involved with student gov't full-time the way he was without that meager stipend."

I took it my first semester here as a freshman (AP credit/tested out), and it was by far my hardest class that semester (I thought it was the hardest Calc).  The professors know that you are an engineer/science-related major, so they know they can expect more from you than the Calc 1 class.   IIRC, our exams took up the full time they gave us to complete them.  The final is the same for all Calc 2's, but the professor had control of the midterms.  Our averages were in the 40s and 50s, so take what you will."
rutgers,35amfq,janisPeebles,5,Fri May 8 15:16:13 2015 UTC,"I walked into calc 2 hearing similar horror stories. To my surprise, I found the material easier to understand compared to when I first learned Calculus 1. There were a lot of topics covered, graph rotation, series/sums, a little bit of parametric, a little bit of polar coordinates, an intro to differential equations and a plethora of ways to apply integrations to everything I just mentioned. I think this is too much to a lot of people (which can explain the horror stories), but if you sit down, study your stuff, practice, ask questions, and luckily have at least a somwhat decent professor then it shouldn't be that bad.   As for the final, it was tough. There were 15 questions that took me about 2.5 hours. The practice test my professor posted as well as those in the course website were slightly (just a little bit) easier than my final. The most difficult part of it, in my opinion, is changing your problem to look like something you can work with. I think if you practice and do a lot of problems of ALL types, then you'll know what needs to be done to a series/integral, etc. in order to get your answer. There were easy integrations, but there were also some that require a lot of steps. Overall, I felt good about my final.  The grading, in my case, is done like this: the number of people that got A's in the final for my class will be the number of A's my professor can give out. My class uses the 525 points (100 for exam1, 100 for exam2, 125 for hw/workshops, and 200 for final). So an A is anything >472.5. Let's say only 3 people passed that mark, but there were 5 A's on the final. So this is where I ASSUME the next 2 students ranked on points receive the remaining A, but I don't know for sure.  TL;DR, practice all kinds of problems, seek for help if you need it. Some problems on the final exam are tedious with a lot of steps but not impossible. If your algebra  and calculus 1 is good, then this class will expand your knowledge. Else, you will find yourself retaking it."

Tl;dr - Teacher was super evil by making the class x100 harder than it had to be. Stressful experience for everybody. When the final came around, everybody in the class aced it. 70% of us got As, nobody failed.  So I was in the Honors section, where everyone was pretty smart. I'm not the best at math, but I'm pretty good. I feel like I belong. I have a strong calculus background from high school, so this should be a breeze, right?  Nope. Our teacher was a grad student, and he didn't know how to make eye contact (typical in the math department). His lectures were long, unbearable, and usually over everybody's head.  The textbook (as you all are probably aware) was fucking Rogawski, one of the hardest textbooks I ever come across. So reading that is equally over my head, looks like I got nothing to learn with.  And then comes the assigned homework. Every. Fucking. Night. AT LEAST 5 hours a night, just doing fucking calculus problems from this fucking ridiculous textbook with barely any preparation from lecture. And to make sure you did the homework, they were GRADED. Fuck.  Thank goodness the solution manual has all the answers /s  Ahh, and here comes the midterm exams. Only 7 questions, okay. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS @#%(@#%JLK!?!?!@?!? I'm sorry I thought classes were supposed to be taught in English, not HIEROGLYPHICS?! Damn those were the hardest exams I've ever took. Those exams were also really weird; the average was a 50, and the grades would range all over the place from 20 to 90. Oh geez. He also wrote all the individual grades on the board so everybody can see how you placed. Fun.  Another midterm. Same death toll. R.I.P. - everybody's GPA (except those few people getting 90s like wtf.)  Disheartened, our grad student decided to hold a review session for the final. As you may know, the final is weird; you compete by classes, and the # of As you get on the final determines the number of As your class can receive as a whole. So to help our class do better, we had a nice review session where we reviewed a Calc 2 test from UPenn.  Wait a minute. This was the easiest test ever. We went through every problem and we were like, ""That's it? They don't even ask to do this...?"" And we were really confused.  ""Are you sure you have UPenn's Calc2 Exam, and not Penn State's?""  Okay so, our spirits a little higher, we went into that Calculus 152 final. My class was shitting themselves. The average on that final was a 115 / 200.  ...My class's average was a 183. The lowest grade was a 146, a whopping 31 points above the average. We had 13 people score above a 193/200.  In the end, about 70% of the class got As and the lowest grade (1-2 people) was a C.

rutgers,35amfq,blastorff,3,Fri May 8 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was terrified to take 152 because so many people talk about how hard it is and how everyone fails it..I thought it was easier than 151 and 251. At least I understood the material far better, just made sense to me. To be fair I think it depends A LOT on what professor you have.  Also, i think a lot of people skip class and think they can teach themself the material from the book..you really cant. the book was always giving the most basic examples, and you get the real example problems in class that more so resemble what you would see on an exam.   I dont think they are graded unfailr,y but there has been a lot of variation year to year on how exams were done. I took 152 in fall 2011, and at the time all the professors made their own midterms but everyon took the same final, which was made by professor Soffer (i did not have her as my regular professor)  Some professors make their exams all proofs..which I think is BS and ive seen some 152 exams that i could not have passed, or at least didnt think i would have from glancing at the questions..i got a B+ in the class when I took it and I had a pretty good prof. our exams were not easy, but they were very fair. he also curved. I thought that the final exam was also fair, and didnt feel like it was outrageous. They were real problems not proof after proof, but ive seen exams from other people taking it that took it different semesters where their whole exam was practically proofs..i would have failed that exam lol  honestly dont overthink it. take it, dont skip lecture, and do all the homework. do the practice tests."
rutgers,35amfq,umib0zu,3,Fri May 8 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"If you've previously been very good at your mathematics courses, because you are just very good at puzzle solving or computation, then you will notice that 152 is particularly difficult compared to your older courses, because it requires you to not simply compute things, but to actually understand some of the concepts you are learning (summations, convergence, continuity, what a function is, how to compose one with other functions, and so on). A lot of the time you'll be asked to demonstrate that something is true. In precalculus and other courses, you are only very rarely asked to demonstrate something via a series of derivations. Typically you only need to apply one or two formulae.   If your mathematics courses in the past have been very abstract, or if you are just not naturally good at computation, you probably will not find it any different from your previous math courses (if you have done very well at those). In fact you may even find it easier, as you will likely have experience trying to understand the geometry and algebra in a class, whereas the more computational folk have not been forced to do that because of their natural talent, and so will have less practice with actually studying and doing the work."
rutgers,35amfq,MutatedSpleen,3,Sat May 9 02:59:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sure an actual mathematician can illuminate the problems with calc 152, but from my perspective, 152 is hard because of 3 different reasons.   Most people come in with airs of massive confidence after surviving 151, thinking 152 will also be a breeze. It isn't. You're actually learning two versions of calculus. Historically, the Weirstrass/Newton methods of epsilon-delta limit calculus was developed and formalized in the late 1800s. Now Robinson developed hyperreal numbers and proved they were in fact, the same thing, provided you follow rules in the 1960s. Today, most introductory calc courses focus on epsilon-delta and don't teach infinitesimal, but still teach concepts like ""dividing by dx"", which in limit calculus doesn't really make sense. When I asked a professor why this was the case, he basically said a lot of professional mathematics was built using limits already, so at this point most mathematicians don't really care. It ends up being confusing because on one hand, you're taught the ""physics"" way of taking infinitessimally small pieces of things and integrating them, a concept central to infinitesimal calculus. On the other hand, you're taught a lot about limits, continuity, and derivatives using limits. Basically Calc 2 is a clusterfuck, but also when asked, most professors feel there isn't anywhere else to put this material, so it might as well go here. Most people by this time don't have the chops to understand proof logic, let alone most majors don't go past calc 2, so a lot of material goes flying over students heads while their main focus is to just obtain a C to be done with math.   P.S. Here's the actual book I looked at after I graduated on infinitesimal calculus. It's also one of the only elementary books on the subject, since the original book by Robinson is rare. I would not recommend reading this until you're done at least calc 3, but the epilogue and intro is a nice summer read explaining the history."

rutgers,35amfq,Hofulu,5,Fri May 8 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"How is that the math department's fault that you can't apply the knowledge you have to problems you've never seen?  Rutgers has many problems, the math department is not one of them."
rutgers,35amfq,Schabernack,2,Fri May 8 19:25:35 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand. Was it an entirely new concept that wasn't covered in the class (like a random Calc 3 topic)?
rutgers,35amfq,pureatheisttroll,2,Fri May 8 19:32:08 2015 UTC,I'm curious to what question your referring to. Do you remeber how it went?
rutgers,35amfq,Hofulu,1 point,Fri May 8 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"it was about bats. a woman sells bats, and she estimates she will sell 20 bats per month if she sells each one for 30 bucks. for every $2 decrease in price per bat, she is estimated to sell 4 more bats. find the price she should sell each bat for in order to achieve maximum profit.  that was the general set up of every problem like it we did. two equations, one for the price per bat and one for the quantity sold each month, and we learned how to do that  in the exam, they decided to throw in a third piece of information - it costs $4 per bat per month for food. we were never taught how to implement the third detail into the work or equations we learned. the way you had to do the problem changed completely, and there was only one chance in the entire year to learn how to do it before the exam? still getting over it lol"
rutgers,35amfq,pureatheisttroll,3,Fri May 8 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the problem was designed to test you on whether you fully understood how to do the original problem, like if you actually understood why you set the equations up a certain way and then perform the steps the way you do. A lot of professors like to add these types of problems to their exams because it keeps people from just memorizing the general steps to solve a specific type of problem without actually knowing what they're doing. Like with Calc I, it's entirely possible to get an A in the class without actually knowing what a derivative or tangent line is. You can just memorize what to do when you see a problem that says ""Find the equation of this tangent line.""  If your professor didn't do this sort of thing on the midterms or quizzes or workshops, then I think it's a little unfair to put a 'new' type of question on the final like this. I'm sure a lot of people didn't get the question right either, so I don't think you should worry too much.   If you take upper level math courses, professors will do this all the time. You'll be taking your midterm and in one question you'll get a completely new definition and have to fully understand it on the spot. You'll have to prove theorems and stuff you've never talked about in class before. You get used to it after awhile."

Your going make the school look bad by giving away hand outs to kids who barely get by. Why should the University bend it's rules for people who shouldn't be passed in the first place.  ""waaaa!  I tried hard already but my professor is a dick...  Curves...  Exams...."". Shut the fuck up you lazy piece of shit,  everyone in the country who goes to college deals with the same fucking thing, you don't deserve special treatment for being pathetic.

rutgers,35cmwq,StockBandit,3,Sat May 9 01:40:25 2015 UTC,This probably won't go over well but they should leave it how it was instead of artificially inflating everyone's GPA and devaluing the hard work of people who got it right the first time
rutgers,35cmwq,sunjay118,3,Sat May 9 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"Or are you punishing people who do the work, and have and A/B understanding, but happened to fail the class before? Then we are rewarding people who withdraw halfway through versus the people who take a chance with challenging material."
rutgers,35cmwq,pagirl,2,Sat May 9 00:59:50 2015 UTC,I actually hadn't thought of that.  I agree that a student should be rewarded if they have an A/B understanding of the material. But that doesn't mean the first time through when they failed should be forgotten. If you got a D and then an A both should count towards your GPA equally. If you fail a class you fail a class.   I'm sympathetic because Universities around the country do the same which means if your university doesn't you are put at a disadvantage. In light of that I can't fairly say I'm against rutgers implementing this policy.  I am however against Universities as a whole doing this.

rutgers,358rfz,Frenchiie,3,Fri May 8 23:14:51 2015 UTC,"No. Most professors do not use a true curve because it is unfair--it would guarantee that some percentage of people fail. Most professors scale their grades accordingly, some will do it in a legit statistical way like using normalization and z-scores, but some just pick numbers..like ok the average was a 55, so a 55-75 will be the range you need for a C, something like that. You could get that range doing it statistically but some professors really do just arbitrarily decide grade scales based off of shit like that. But they rarely if ever bump peoples grades DOWN because you can imagine how unfair that is  when a professor or student talks about a ""curve"" its not even a true curve, it's just a colloquialism at this point"

I also interviewed with Lockheed Martin in person and had several other phone interviews. I had it best explained to me this way: while the classes are generally easier, you have a lot more free time to try and acquire internships and eventually a graduate job.  I'm not sure I'd major in ITI again if I went here a full four years, as opposed to just two. But hey, whatever I guess. It sounds like I'm trying to say to not major in ITI, but that's not the case. I don't think it's a ""useless"" major. It's just that I feel like you need to bust your ass just a bit more, as opposed to CS, to land internships and/or a post-graduate job.  I can't help you with your questions about a CS minor, however. You can probably find that with a quick Google search though (or degree navigator).  Edit - I noticed you are an incoming freshmen, so you do not have access to degree navigator. This link should help. There are many paths you can choose for a CS minor, and they all seem to require at least Calc 1."
rutgers,358an0,Farratn,6,Thu May 7 23:10:59 2015 UTC,"Agree completely. ITI worked out fine because no actual businesses know what you do in the classes. I spent a lot of time talking about technology, very little doing actual IT work. If you walk in to a business and say you want to work in their IT department, they'll ask you what you know about Windows Server and Active Directory, and what your opinion of virtualizing their infrastructure would be. I didn't learn any of those answers from the ITI program. But, I applied for jobs, they saw something tech related from Rutgers, and I got the interview, and from there I got a nice job that I'm quite happy with. So basically, your mileage may vary."

rutgers,358an0,itsthelast,1 point,Sun May 10 03:36:39 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer not to say specifically, but it's a security firm (physical security, like door access and IP video cameras). Most of the modern security hardware like card swipes and whatnot tie in to a server somewhere, so I handle setting up the servers for our clients and then troubleshooting them when something goes wrong. I'm working on getting into the planning stages of things, which is a higher role where I work.  Just to reiterate what I said earlier, though, the ""technologist"" side of the ITI program as well as the management side will definitely help my mindset when it comes to future positions, but you can't apply for a managerial position straight out of college. When I applied for this job, they asked me all about my ability to administer and set up the servers - stuff I didn't learn from an ITI class."

Secondly, it might be worth emailing people in the computer science department whose work you find interesting. It sounds like you keep getting the short end of a shitty stick, and if you want to work on comp sci projects, maybe the best thing for you to do is see if you can get some research experience with a prof, even before you get into a necessary class.

rutgers,358llc,Dstanding,4,Fri May 8 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get downvoted to hell but the fact is OP, you are the type of person that doesn't need a college degree. A lot of people are glued to the mindset that a degree determines your entire value to the world, but that just isn't true. You might not be the traditional definition of a ""computer scientist"" but you already have the skillset of a professional programmer and that is great because most people who study computer science end up wanting to become programmers anyway.  The games industry is a great example of a field where a degree means jack shit. Some of the best programmers only have high school experience, and some people who have directed large name games dropped out in middle school (American McGee, for example.) These people, like yourself, had direction. When they finished highschool, they knew exactly what they wanted to do with their lives, and it sounds like you are in the same boat.  A skilled programmer is quite valuable in the tech industry as well, a college degree can open doors for you, but a skilled programmer will always have a job.  My advice would be the following:  1.) If you really can't stand sitting in a Rutgers classroom anymore, take the education section off your resume and start applying to as many jobs as you can. Take a semester off and work, and see if you like it (you probably would.)  2.) If you want to get a degree to please your parents, switch your major to IT and just minor in something like CS. The IT program at Rutgers is a great choice for people like you. The workload is often lighter and the teachers are much nicer than any other program I've experienced myself. The focus is on personal projects and self-growth, the teachers understand that their classes are fluff, and they encourage you to get off your ass and do something outside of school.  Best of luck OP, and I hope you aren't too discouraged by the other comments in this thread. You seem like a talented individual and I hope Rutgers doesn't take that away from you."
rutgers,358llc,QuiteTheChoi,3,Fri May 8 19:22:11 2015 UTC,i suggest going to community college and getting your associates degree there first. its motivating to want to get out of community college and it makes you(made me) want to do better in real college.

Think about it -- it's not that you don't want to succeed hard enough, or that you aren't competent enough -- what you have is a medical problem. You need therapy and/or medicine, independent of anything. CAPS is free to students during the semester, give them a call for starters.  As for that degree, well, it honestly doesn't seem like you have very much to learn here from a CS standpoint. Like, you probably know more already than a solid portion of our graduates. Once you get the depression under control, you should be able to breeze through if you choose to.  Brings me to my next point, there are nice-paying tech companies out there that will hire you without a degree, if you can prove you know how to code. They tend to be small startup-ish places. Not having that piece of paper will close a lot of doors, but those were probably crappy doors anyway. And once you get your first job, your degree hardly even matters."

But hey you seem to think you can do it.   If you do want a degree, here is what you need to do:  1) drop out of school for now  2) seek a psych for your depression and attention problems. The two are usually related.  3) once you feel better and have decided that you are just wasting your life away, reapply for admission.   Alternatively you might want to do a semester at community college before going back to Rutgers, just to see if you can handle it. You dont want to think you are okay, relapse again and fail."

So just wait until you get your credit eval. And I think it would be hard to transfer from SAS to SOE since engineering is a very competitive school to get into and going from SAS to most professional schools is hard

You're trying to argue a future point that none of us know the answer to yet.  Projections show that the AD will be losing $11 million in 2021, and the total increase in revenue in 2022 will be around $35-40 million.  So that should result in a sizable surplus.    Barchi is really clamping down on new athletic spending.  Flood's extension and his larger pool of money for assistant coaches was paid for through private donations.  Stringer's contract was reworked so that she would have to produce more on the court to make what she was before.  The new baseball/softball facilities are currently being fundraised for and will not be using school funds.

Rutgers was only invited to the CIC as it's a sister-institution to the Big Ten.  Without the Big Ten, there is no CIC.  Again, it seems that you don't know anything about the CIC, why don't you go do some homework next week after finals and then post back when you have some information.  I could have even made the argument that the CIC could help Rutgers get billions of dollars of federal research grants because CIC schools have in the past worked on pooling together government support on research dollars; but that's a much harder argument to justify, the five I listed earlier are more easily quantifiable and I'll just have to settle for those."
rutgers,353xur,JayRU09,-1,Thu May 7 00:55:38 2015 UTC,"Nope, I added up all the expenses of the big 10 teams, its about a billion annually."

If that money had been spent on academic programs, we wouldn't be slowly dropping in the ranking in so many fields. The ""CIC"" is a waste of money, none of those benefits are things that Rutgers could not have obtained before without wasting so much money. Library exchange programs were already available and in use, Scholar exchange is not a new thing, Credit Reciprocity is interesting, but not a particularly big deal, and Project collaboration between universities is not a new idea."
rutgers,355ie0,grasscube,8,Thu May 7 07:36:23 2015 UTC,So do you suffer from dyscalculia or something? 4 years of failing the lowest level of math seems to indicate a bigger problem here.
rutgers,355ie0,ThroughTheWire,6,Thu May 7 11:25:45 2015 UTC,"This is an important question that you, OP, should not take as an insult.  Learning disorders are real things and can (obviously) seriously impact your learning process.  Understanding why you are failing the class is probably the most important thing.  If you do live with a learning disorder of some kind (dyscalculia or dyslexia, for example), there are services you can get through the office of disability services to help you succeed in courses that are especially difficult.  The other real possibility here is that it's something that you are doing that's causing it.  If you're not going to lectures, not doing homework, not studying, not seeking help, etc...that's on you.  Sometimes, those of us in the humanities and social sciences don't take math classes seriously because we don't care about them, and that obviously can have some serious negative consequences.  Basically, you need to figure out what the problem is, and address the problem.  Trying again without addressing the problem will almost certainly leave you in the same situation you are in right now.  I don't mean to make you feel bad, but you don't fail a course three times unless there is a problem somewhere.  Find the problem and address it, and you'll be much better off."
rutgers,355ie0,MutatedSpleen,5,Thu May 7 13:52:27 2015 UTC,"Do you understand why you are failing? Are you doing the homework and asking your professor for help when you need it? Understanding the fundamentals of math may be difficult but I guarantee you that if you put in the work you should be able to pass this class no problem.   I would retake this class and just straight up tell your professor that you failed this class four times in a row. Just go to office hours, try your hardest on understanding the homework and give it your best shot. I really don't think that any pre-algebra professor will fail someone that has already failed the course four times and has made the effort to show up for extra help on numerous occasions."

Option A: double down and work your damn ass off for the next 3 years, get at least 3.5s in every class and you have a chance of boosting your gpa back up to good levels. Option B: Do just enough work to graduate, keep your gpa above the threshold for probation/ graduation and work your damn ass off getting jobs/ internships/ learning programming (making programs and doing contracts with other companies to write programs for them, basically have a very healthy programming/IT resume by the time you graduate). Option A leaves you with a pretty standard college life and you'll have a chance at grad school. Option B will probably get you employed faster but grad school won't be an option.

I failed calc 135 twice and never retook it again and currently have around a 3.1 GPA. Though a 3.1 isn't that great and probably wouldn't get me into grad school (im not trying anyways), I think you can definitely work your way back up from a 2.5.

Study more, spend less time not doing school shit, get help immediately when you realize you need it.  And above all, understand that the choices you're making in terms of what you want to do aren't set in stone.  You might really fucking suck as bio/chem/whatever.  It's possible, it's not for everyone.    I spent three semesters during my undergrad almost failing out.  Had 2.47 my first semester in CS, scored 1.0 overall in my second semester, after I realized I didn't like CS and went into physics.  Got something like a 2.5 my third semester, retaking most of my second semester classes with a fluff class or two added on specifically for GPA-related reasons (so I didn't get kicked out).  Realized my heart just wasn't in the physical sciences, so I went to my advisor and talked careers.  She helped me realize that working with my people and communities was more my thing, so I started working towards a career in social work.  Did psychology and sociology for undergrad - with the understanding that I'd be going to grad school - and never again had a semester GPA under 3.5.  Unfortunately, those early semesters were still on my transcript, so my graduating GPA was something like a 3.3, but that was enough for grad school.  The point is...forcing yourself into a specific field, even if you aren't good at it and/or you don't like it isn't going to work.  Evaluate your life, and if this is something you honestly and sincerely want to do, that's fine, but understand you are going to have to put in a monumental amount of work, and this will probably mean very little in the way of social life from here out.  These classes are just going to get harder every semester on.  Good luck!"

I was a CBN major. I started doing a lot better. I got all B+ and As. I ended up taking a lot of extra credits. I think I finished with almost 150. I took classes every summer and maxed my load every semester. By taking so many credits and doing well I finished with a 3.5 GPA.  I don't necessarily suggest over doing it. You should take a light course load and ease into it. If you do well then up the workload the next semester, but never burn yourself out. Know your limits and prioritize the things in your life.

rutgers,352b87,boogabooga08,3,Wed May 6 20:20:40 2015 UTC,I partied too hard. I did not prioritize classes or studying. I would leave myself one day to study for a Bio or Chem exam when I really needed a week of less frantic studying.

I took both 159 and 160 last year, 159 was pretty simple so the curve was pretty minor (maybe 10-20 pts), 160 is still somewhat simple but people have more trouble with it so, if I remember correctly, the curve was pretty huge (something like 50 pts).

Core concepts should be learned to not only make sense of the math but also be able to address the occasional problem that asks for it on the exams.  Homework, homework, homework. The problems in the homework seem to be more closely related to what would be on the following exam than the previous exams Marvasi's (the professor of the course) posted, in both difficulty and actual content tested (to some extent I wonder if the previous exams weren't just a red herring for those who didn't put in the necessary time to study).  You may or may not like the lectures; I personally didn't like them because I felt they didn't cover a sufficient amount of information for the amount of time each lecture took up. They're not mandatory attendance, so I spent most of my time in the library looking up youtube videos to learn and subsequently going into the homework. Grades improved drastically.   Chemistry is a difficult subject regardless but if triggered the right amount of interest or given the right presentation of the content, you can easily take an intuitive approach rather than just pure memorization. Just make sure you understand it to the point that you don't get tricked by the problems; these exams feature multiple choice questions designed to snag you if you make a mistake in calculation, which can be anywhere from forgetting to convert your units to forgetting key relationships ."

However, if the Uni is saying the crew was cut and has yet to be restored because it operates in the red (no pun intended), then by that logic they should have cut all sports that don't produce any revenue. It seems stupid to not have your oldest athletic program at the University at Varsity status after 151 years of existence for a weak reason as ""they don't produce any revenue""."

Close inspection reveals that it does not turn a revenue for the school. RU football is supported financially by the university beyond nearly every other football program in the country - especially compared to other schools in the BIG 10. I know that we have been told that given time in the BIG 10, we will turn a profit with football, but only time will tell. Nonetheless, this shouldn't be a matter of money. Crew alumni have volunteered more than enough financial support to reinstate the team. Its just about making the administration correct their wrongdoing."

rutgers,350ihx,JayRU09,0,Thu May 7 12:07:20 2015 UTC,"So I did some digging into this:    The $40 million dollar figure is what it would cost to endow the sport, ensuring that it would stay funded at a 'varsity' (more on that in a second) level indefinitely.  The real comparison is $120,000 versus $1.6 million a year, and I just can't see how really either of those are correct.   Men's rowing isn't a sport recognized by the NCAA or the Big Ten.  It's a club team at every Big Ten school.  The group that sponsors crew nationally is the Intercollegiate Rowing Association, which recognizes the Rutgers crew team as a varsity team anyways despite it really being a club team."
rutgers,350ihx,rowingdoc,2,Wed May 6 21:13:50 2015 UTC,You are wrong on several points here. The coaching position and much of the equipment costs are already endowed. The Crew is the only sports institution at Rutgers with endowments of the sport. Crew is a varsity sport at other Big 10 institutions - e.g. Wisconsin. The IRA doesn't recognize Rutgers crew as a varsity. There is in fact a rule in the IRA rule book which was created after RU Crew was cut stating that non varsity teams would not be allowed to compete in the annual IRA championship.

The IRA is the governing body that oversees MEN's rowing (whereas WOMEN's rowing is NCAA sanctioned). The IRA was offered the shot to be a part of the NCAA, but declined because it did not like the way that the NCAA was run. Long story short, Wisconsin has VARSITY rowing, though it is not a NCAA sport or offered by the BIG10. In conclusion, I am not wrong, just more informed. The more you know..."

I will say though if you do drop out, consider going to community college for a year. That's what I did and now I'll be transferring to Rutgers with an associates.

If you can, I would definitely look into taking them. You need a 70 to pass. I'd look into it.

rutgers,34zo04,treesz,2,Tue May 5 21:59:16 2015 UTC,"I commuted and clubs were definitely it for me.  Especially when I took on a leadership role in the club.  I ran the underground gaming society, most of my friends are from there.  Also volunteering for new student orientation is great because the new students are generally looking to meet new friends as well and you are valuable to them in that you have wisdom they seek.  Easy to make friends that way.  If you do join a club though don't just attend and leave when its done.  We had some regular members who would show up for almost every meeting, but never hung out with us for after meeting get togethers, so i lost contact when the semester was over.  If you have people you get along with at the club, invite them to hang out and do something afterwards.  Also having a car is valuable to people living on campus, I was basically the taxi driver.  In exchange, I got so many free meal swipes in the dining hall.  So we helped each other out with what the other needed.  You might be able to build a relationship by getting free take out swipes from underclassmen who have to many meals and giving them a ride when they need to go off campus.  Oh and hang out in the off campus students association lounge/office.  They are all in the same boat as you.  They were always friendly when I was there.  And they had cool events."

I took AP comp sci back in 2009, so I am not sure how applicable that is. Basically, if you understand objects, loops, big o, sorting, then you'll be on even footing with the rest of the 112 class."
rutgers,350azj,savataged,1 point,Wed May 6 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"I would recommend going straight to 112 (Data Structures). Like others have said, you only do the very basics in 111 (Intro to CS). The most advanced topics they get to at the end of the year are some very basic Object Oriented Programming, which you most likely covered in your AP class. Chances are you already have more familiarity with programming than a student who just started programming in 111, largely due to the fact that AP CS is a full school year at most high schools where as 111 is one semester.  The only thing that they touch on in 111 that you may or may not have covered in your AP class is runtime analysis (Big O). But honestly, the amount covered is fairly small and can easily be picked up in the beginning of 112 (and if you have trouble, there are always office hours).  Your time is better spent getting through the early classes faster so you can get to the more interesting upper level CS courses."

I know a lot of people who have advertised on various Rutgers facebook groups and sold books pretty quickly.  There's always Amazon too if you want to go through the hassle of packing and shipping them. They have a buyback program where they give you a certain amount based on the selling price of the book. I've never used it so I can't comment on it.   I've heard nice things about half.com too but I've never used it myself.  Then of course you can sell directly to a bookstore. This is the quickest but you're not going to get much, regardless of where of you go.  I've heard NJ Books's prices are a little better than the official Rutgers bookstores.

Rutgers defines cheating at ""Cheating: Cheating is the use of inappropriate or prohibited materials, information, sources, or aids in any academic exercise. Cheating also includes submitting papers, research results and reports, analyses, etc. as one’s own work when they were, in fact, prepared by others. Some common examples are:""  Prior exams are inappropriate materials, as many questions are recycled year to year. There isn't an infinite amount of questions professors have to draw on. Old exams will give students an unfair advantage.  Don't think so? Why don't you go ask your dean and report back.  Just because you want to pretend like it isn't cheating and unethical doesn't make it so. It gives a student an unfair advantage over another. You bet your ass we consider that cheating."

If the professor doesn't want the students to know what type of questions the exam has ahead of time (by not releasing old exams) obtaining old exams is in fact cheating.  I'm not posting on my regular account because I know students get all high and mighty about their grades and don't like to be called out for cheating. It's cheating, plain and simple.

rutgers,34l97f,prestico23,2,Sat May 2 16:23:47 2015 UTC,"I almost did a triple.  I was psychology/law and society (which was my school's fancy way of saying ""criminology""), and for a hot second, was a poli sci major as well, until I realized that I actually hate poli sci, so I dropped that shit like a bad habit.  Are those majors all different degrees at Rutgers, or would it be one degree with three majors?  I was lucky at my school to have Psych be changed from the school of liberal arts to the school of health and human services during my last summer, so I got grandfathered into the new school (which gave out B.S. degrees) without having to do the science core, so I got a B.A. and a B.S..  Dunno how Rutgers does their stuff though."
rutgers,34l97f,MutatedSpleen,2,Sat May 2 18:16:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it would be one degree with 3 majors. Pretty awesome that you were given two degrees. I wish that were the case here

rutgers,34l97f,mookyvon,3,Sat May 2 06:15:40 2015 UTC,"Dear students,  The Final Examination will not be given. This decision has been made by the top administration following this past week's internet disruptions and college site access failures. Due to the concern that not all students will be able to properly access the exam it will not run and will be removed from your list of required assignments for this spring semester of Art Appreciation.  All other work is due by May 4th. Although the system is still recovering you should be able to access ecollege by now and to conclude all unit discussions as well as a total of 65 complete blog entries. No extensions will be given.  Regarding final grades:  Each student will receive an automatic percentile grade on ecollege. The assignments graded include the following: Class participation, Blog, Essay One, Midterm Exam, Museum Review. The Final Exam will show up without a grade but because your final grade will be percentile you have nothing to worry about. Due to the possibility that some students were looking to the Final Exam as a way to raise their grade, all students will receive an extra 5 points to the percentile earned.  This semester has been particularly challenging for all of us with software and other technical issues and I thank you all for your patience. I look forward to reviewing the remainder of your work in the upcoming days. Please contact me before May 4th with any questions or concerns."

rutgers,34hiqm,Pinecallado,2,Fri May 1 04:59:51 2015 UTC,"There's this stereotype that the  ""college experience"" has to involve living in the dorms and puking at a lot of frat parties. That's not true. College is what you make it, and it sounds like that's not the kind of experience you want anyway if you miss cooking your own food.  You should be able to make friends at Rutgers Newark, and do some interesting things with them. The campus is smaller, so you might actually have an easier time making friends than all the people who keep posting in this sub about how lonely they are. You probably won't have the same breadth of classes available at NB, but I'm sure there are some interesting and inspiring professors at Newark, and some opportunities on campus that you can take advantage of.   Unrelated: get your licence as soon as you can. It gets harder and harder to make the time to do it as you get older, and it won't seem important until you're hit with an emergency where you really need it. (Source: friend is 24, still doesn't have it because he doesn't have the time to practice.)"
rutgers,34hiqm,prairielily,2,Fri May 1 06:34:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I want a nice college experience, just not in the dorms right now. I missed living at home and being able to cook whatever I want instead of depending that the dining hall will hopefully have something I like.  I just feel kind of guilty about moving back home because many people say college is when you're suppose to become independent from your parents and learn to live on your own. I still want to live on my own one day I'm just not ready to now. :(  Does Rutgers Newark have a lot of activities? Since it's in the middle of downtown Newark I'm guessing it should. It's just that in a lot of comments I read about Rutgers Newark write more about how RN is really convenient for commuters and for people who want  to travel to NYC than about the school itself. Those two points are important for me too but I would like to know what the quality of the school is like too.   I know it's important for me to get my license but I'm still too scared to drive. People drive like nut jobs on the street and it looks too easy to get into an car accident. My parents even said they was going to help me buy a used car and has been pressuring me to get my license but I'm too scared to drive."
rutgers,34hiqm,prairielily,2,Fri May 1 07:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not a Newark student - I just wanted to say something positive because it sounds like you're moving home either way. Hopefully someone from Newark will comment on that stuff. You could also try /r/RutgersNewark, but it's pretty small.  As you learn to drive, you'll gain the experience to avoid a lot of accidents. Just drive defensively and pay attention. Plus, you're free to keep taking the bus once you have your licence. You'll just have a second option."
rutgers,34hiqm,dsatrbs,2,Fri May 1 08:52:55 2015 UTC,"I was actually the top rated poster in that thread. I have made friends at RBS-Newark as a commuter (and I'm still there, so still time to make more...). Finding things to do outside of school is key. Don't be afraid to randomly talk to people, especially whoever is sitting next to you when you start classes, or to exchange numbers with people you meet.  For a quick rundown of life in and around Rutgers Newark, check out the Rutgers Newark wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/RutgersNewark/wiki/index  Also /r/RutgersNewark and /r/Newark are worth periodically checking out.  Newark is a good campus, kind of a diamond in the rough. There's also some big changes planned for the campus, including new academic buildings, classroom renovations, and a new college walk. All together they should make the college more of a destination for students, instead of just being convenient for commuters. Hopefully many of the upgrades will be finished before you graduate (some are already in progress and on time)."

If you're looking for a more young professional type setting I would look at apartments off of George street. Plaza square, the George, rockoff, etc.  These complexes are more in downtown New Brunswick but are still very close to the Easton bars, about a 5-10minute walk. They're more expensive but are a nicer than what you will get on Easton.  This is a very general overview. If you have more questions let me know."

rutgers,34d3hd,MongolianDynamite,6,Thu Apr 30 05:54:03 2015 UTC,Can't speak for the Piscataway campuses but they've been flushing hydrants around College Ave. I think it's just mineral deposits/sediment build ups in the water mains.

The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh water, saline water and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through different phases: liquid, solid (ice), and gas (vapor).

Transfering from CC to a 4-year is common. just check with registration what forms you need and make sure you check your transcript request often. once that is in stay on top of checking when your classes have transfered in. there may be a problem and you MAY need to talk to registar if something comes up and your classes aren't transfering but it's an annoyance at worst. legally they have to accept something like 50 credits."

I am so glad that I went to MCC and paid for my AAS then went to Kean and took out such a small amount in loans that I paid it off before even enrolling in law school.

rutgers,34ejld,rosepudding,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a graduating Rutgers Business School student and transferring was a relatively easy process. I don't exactly recall what forms I was required to submit, but obviously a transcript is necessary and perhaps your SAT scores in addition to the application. Adjusting to Rutgers was a rather effortless process, but that's not to say you won't run into some issues. I personally didn't bond with other students on my floor at first and instead made friends with students on another campus, so I spent most of my free time hanging out with them. Obviously using the Rutgers buses wasn't ideal, but necessary. My recommendation to you would be to join as many clubs/groups as you possibly can to enhance your social life, broaden your interests, and develop some useful skills in the process. But don't forget that the primary reason you're here is to study. Although I think that the first semester will be difficult for your in terms of getting accommodated to managing your social life with your academics, after that you should be fine.  I did very well (3.9) at community college and haven't performed at quite that level, but well enough (3.5) that I'm satisfied with the effort that I put in. If I could go to a community college again, I would do it in a heartbeat. My student debt is lower as a result of first attending CC and I eliminated my general education requirements, so I felt up to par compared to other students. You'll be fine. Just have fun and don't take things too seriously. These past 3 years at Rutgers have been the most fun times of my life and have allowed me to form great memories with my friends, who I now consider my family. You will definitely enjoy your time here. If you have any other questions, feel free to PM me."

Also, you probably don't realize how adding additional buses won't really solve the ""problems"" you are facing, since it's mostly caused by overcrowding at a few very specific locations at peak times; this is something adding more buses won't solve.  Additionally, much of the funding for the new construction comes from the state bond that was passed a few years ago. Along with this, I'd imagine DevCo is paying for a large portion of this. I'm not sure of the details, but for most dormitories nowadays, the developer owns the building for the first few years and ""rents"" it to the university.  TLDR: Stop bitching.

Devco has headed a bunch of projects for Rutgers and NB now and I don't really think any of them have been a ""miss"" so far. Rutgers is always going to be spending money and it's not like the bus problem is solely a result of improper allocation of funds. There are other things to consider there, like maybe more buses would lead to even more traffic congestion at rush hour, some of the routes themselves aren't even optimal (think about those left hand turns after Scott Hall), etc.  Construction like this makes Rutgers more attractive to applicants and (ideally) it can ultimately improve our academic reputation over time. I know that might sound like bullshit, but when I lived on Livi just a few years ago it was an absolutely awful campus. My freshman orientation was at the Livi towers and our rooms were literally over 90 degrees at night. Now there's a new business school building, a new dining hall and 3 massive apartment buildings... oh and a fucking movie theater.

rutgers,34c1jx,theeRut,8,Thu Apr 30 13:36:33 2015 UTC,"This is 100% true. There are plenty of busses. They can't just send out an extra 20 busses every time a class starts or ends because then for the other 75% of the time you'd be paying a stupid amount of money for empty busses to drive around. I've spoke with Jack Molenaar about this specific issue. You're complaining about Rutgers spending money but you'd complain even more if Rutgers had all the busses in the world, but every dining hall was as bad (or worse) than Brower. You can't have it all."
rutgers,34c1jx,litecoinminer123,2,Thu Apr 30 16:09:05 2015 UTC,Thank you!!! The buses are great 90% of the time. It is only when a whole bunch of classes get out at once when they suck and there is nothing you can do about it.   If NJ Transit and RU had the same bus fleet then possibly they could do something about it. But that would create a whole new host of problems. The different campuses and bus system is part of Rutgers. It is how our school evolved. Deal with it or go to Montclair.

But, I agree in the sense that Rutgers has often spent money where it should NOT be spending it. They spent 32k for Snooki, drop 6 million in athletic travel, etc.). Rutgers has a great academic reputation overall, but some departments are very neglected and I'd much rather see money spent on academics than turning Rutgers into some strange commercial strip mall. I came back in 2011 and it was wonderful without all the glitz.   Also I know that we're supposed to be grateful that Rutgers is so ""cheap"" and I thought the same thing while I was there. But when I graduated I moved in order to attend a school in Canada and let me just say that I get an equally great education and I pay 3k a semester.

rutgers,34bh2t,gensouj,5,Thu Apr 30 03:53:11 2015 UTC,I heard it just hit the freshmen during registration. I'm sure Rutgers fucks them over so much on its own that no one realized it was gone.
rutgers,34bh2t,settingfires,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:51:14 2015 UTC,Neither did I.  Maybe because I registered early?

rutgers,34bh2t,ellejaygee,0,Thu Apr 30 15:22:10 2015 UTC,"The way Rutgers is handling this is pathetic. RutgersIT made an announcement at 5:00 PM on Wednesday saying there was still network issues, but they made the announcement two hours earlier to resume freshman preregistration? Just because the internet has been working for an hour doesn't mean you should resume registration!   Guess what happened -- WebReg was shut down last night right when Rutgers resumed registration and it's still down as of Thursday morning. They have sent no email warning people of this issue and something tells me they're not going to postpone registration again.  Edit: This has nothing to do with RutgersIT but the way professors are handling this is bullshit too. The internet on Busch is still going in and out. Sakai has been going in and out (even when using Email Login) and none of my professors are even considering extending assignments due. One professor even sent an email yesterday saying he JUST found out about the network issues and if you don't upload your assignments to Sakai on time then your assignment is late, no exceptions. I had to work on a project with a classmate this week and only had a few days to work on it due to some early finals this week and the internet has been down the entire time."

So technically when I register for classes for Fall I'm not registering with all my credits.  And all of the classes I want to take for Fall are already full.

They have reserved seats in classes specifically because transfers. You learn how to register and use degree navigator and around 1-1:30 you get to register. Pick your classes ASAP and go with every detail to a dean who can help you get in that course. (All details, index number, section, everything webreg gives you for that class).

She never really goes over the exams either. She just keeps on doing problems that she thinks will be on the final.   I think I'm doomed now. My exam grades were both failing, but the class averages for both were dangerously low as well. She once stated in class that the curve would be huge and laughed. I don't know what to expect. She knows who I am by name and face since I have asked her a couple of questions, and I have gone to every lecture. But her exams are really difficult.   Basically my main question would be; do you think if I pass the final, like get an A, I can still get a C in the course, even if i failed the two exams. Also, do you think there was a departmental curve when you took it; how good do you think it was?   Sorry for the questions; I'm just freaking out."
rutgers,3489mv,stevel024,2,Wed Apr 29 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"The only person who can really answer this question is your professor. You should ask to talk to her after class and review your grade if you really want to know what you need in order to pass. I don't know what this ""departmental"" curve is, I always thought it was up to the professor to curve the grade, but I graduated a couple of years ago.  If you get into a situation where you might get a D, it might be better to just fail the course and re-take next semester. It's a shitty tactic but it won't mess up your GPA, you'll just have to take on additional credits, or take summer courses to meet your credit requirements to graduate(more $$$ though)."

Thats what they call the departmental curve. I have spoken to her about it, and she keeps putting so much emphasis on the final and the equation, which is a summation of all the exams, recitation, webwork, and the final. And then she states that on top of that she will add the departmental curve. Idk im confused about it myself. But you're right. thanks alot."

rutgers,34132l,kevkev667,17,Tue Apr 28 23:21:56 2015 UTC,"There are two issues with that.  1) How do you determine ""good"" traffic from ""bad"" traffic? Tens of thousands of people use the internet here... If your rules are too strict, you will cause a great deal of harm to the people trying to use the internet.  2) The best filters and firewalls in the world won't work if they are simply overloaded - if the firewall is connected to a 40 gig line at the edge of Rutgers' network, and there's 41gbps of traffic coming to it, no amount of clever tricks will stop you from going down"
rutgers,34132l,dreadiscool,-8,Mon Apr 27 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"as someone who is a network engineer and has dealt with ddos'ing before....  you unplug the incoming line. Block the ip's that are causing the traffic, plug the incoming back in.  its literally that simple.   blahh blahh blahh they could just switch ip's and keep going....  well then you just keep blocking them. its literally that simple. The amount of traffic that a DDOS creates is very easy to spot, like extremely easy, were talking about gb/s or pegged out connections.   just keep blocking and keeping the internet up for as long as you can.   You cannot DDOS from the inside, so it would literally just be watching inbound connections, which in all honesty wont be that many...  Just take the OIT students, who usually deal with professors who call about, wahhh the projector won't turn on so I can't teach because I can't put chalk to chalk board, and have them watch a wireshark or the firewall network inbound panel and name out the ip's as the admin ads them to the block list."
rutgers,34132l,omeletduefromage,11,Mon Apr 27 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"You clearly have never dealt with situation #2 lol.  As someone whose product has been on the receiving end of a 310gbit/s unamplified DDoS attack and writes DDoS mitigation software, that solution doesn't work when your inbound port is saturated.  It doesn't matter if you block the IPs or not, because by the time you're inspecting the IP header it's too late - the packet has already arrived at your network. Even with a team of trained monkeys watching ingress traffic and blacklisting traffic, that doesn't change the fact that if your ingress port is saturated, you will go down - period.  Furthermore, what does unplugging the ingress link have to do with anything? You're helping the attacker by taking the services offline yourself..."
rutgers,34132l,dreadiscool,-5,Mon Apr 27 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"removing the ingress link will stop further incoming packets from overbearing the router. That is specifically for situation number 2. No one sends packets filled over 1gb of data. All you have to do is set a rule to not allow over a certain size and that method is toast.  So by removing the ingress line, you stop on the bombardment of small packets, which in all honesty, is probably what he is doing. This in turn allows the routers and firewalls to catch back up and allow you to change settings.   Firewalls and routers just arent meant to handle massive amount of connections. Once you overload the routers or firewalls processors capability its just a useless over worked device that you can no longer log into or change any settings on. So by removing the ingress link, it allows the hardware to catch back up, the admin to login, and either make a rule to not allow large incoming packets, or start blocking ports and ip's that are not 100% necessary...."
rutgers,34132l,omeletduefromage,8,Tue Apr 28 00:21:24 2015 UTC,"""No one sends packets filled over 1gb of data."" The MTU for most networks doesn't exceed 1500 bytes. Therefore, a packet can never exceed 1500 bytes in length. A packet 1gb in length? uw0tm8?  ""All you have to do is set a rule to now allow over a certain size and that method is toast"" Not if the routers ingress port is saturated - more traffic is coming in than it can handle. It doesn't matter if you block it - that traffic is hitting your router.  ""Firewalls and routers just arent meant to handle massive amount of connections"" Of course they aren't, they operate at the layer 3 level. This means they deal with packets only - they aren't concerned with connections, and most do not even have a conntable (except for use with the admin interface).  I understand you are trying to show off your knowledge here. But when it is so wrong, I would suggest you do some research before you post it online... Your arguments are fundamentally flawed."
rutgers,34132l,dreadiscool,-4,Tue Apr 28 00:59:29 2015 UTC,"if we seriously want to get technical here, since I did not realize I was speaking with someone who actually knew what they were talking about...  Most firewalls/routers that have DDOS protection will stop ethernet frames coming from specific public ip's after they reach a certain transfer limit. So, if a public ip of say, 79.38.170.88 is sending packets with a full payload at 10,000 packtes/sec. This would trigger that IP to be insta-blocked within a couple seconds.   Now that is minimal. Say its over 10,000 public IP's doing this, the firewall or router will be overran before this rule is possibly calculated, it will just halt and not do anything until it processes all the requests, but you can not do anything about it because they just keep coming in. So as the firewall/router is processing the routing requests, more are coming in than are being processed and its like the mississippi river flowing through your garden hose. It will get all blocked up.  By removing the ingress lines, you stop that flow. It will allow the firewall to catch back up with the requests, and you can now do what you need to do to stop the incoming packet attacks. This will allow you to block what ever port it is that most of the traffic is incoming on. You put the ingress back in and watch as the attack resumes on a closed port. By having the port closed, the firewall will no longer halt because it is no longer actually routing the traffic. This allows the admin to block the IP's the attack was coming from and then reopen the port.   While it is not conventional to disconnect the ingress to the firewall or router, it is already down, you can not do anymore harm than they already have. This will allow all internal networks to continue running.  I had the exact situation above happen on a cisco 12000 series I maintain. So I do know what its like to have terrabytes of unwanted traffic take down your whole network. You are failing to see that clearly the rutgers network is already down, there is no harm in removing the ingress.  What I meant by ""No one sends packets filled over 1gb of data."" is that most DDOS attacks do not send enough traffic over 1 IP to cover over 1gb, they send bytes at a time across thousands of IP's. The statements was to show transfer amount over time, not per packet.  And by connections, I meant packet flow from certain ip's....  Most of my statements were extremely dumbed down. We are not in the networking subreddit, the sysadmin sub, or the techsupport sub.We are in the rutgers sub. I do not expect most people in here to even realize that there are routers in the networking field that can handles TB's/sec. And NIC's that can handle 40gb/s when most of their networking knowledge is of their home network with a down and uplink speed of 20Mb/s on 10/100 nics"

We worked next door to each other in Menlo for a year and I even remember buying her a sweater and a tank top from my store.  We commented and gave eProps on each other's Xanga posts.  We had bubble tea.  We chatted on AIM a few times a week.  I taught her what ""Bridge Freezes Before Road Surface"" meant while she drove me to Rutgers.  We eventually grew apart, yet we still got connected through Friendster, MySpace, and then Facebook.  Throughout the years, I lived vicariously through her FB photos, seeing all of the adventures she had been on, jetsetting all over the world.  Five years ago, I was bored at work, looking for something to do.  I went on Facebook, and she introduced me to this website called... Reddit.  I haven't talked to her in years and I haven't seen her in person in over a decade, but I'm still having this feeling of deep sorrow.

rutgers,342xqs,paranoiaplus,6,Mon Apr 27 22:00:17 2015 UTC,"Hey I took expos over the summer my freshman year as well (i'm soph now)  So first, most of your expos experience will depend on your professor. I had a pretty chill professor, (Michael Monescalchi) but expos is expos and there still was a lot of work to be put in.  I would not say it's as bad as everyone says it is. It does take a lot of time, but that's alright since you have a lot of time in the summer. I wasn't a great writer in highschool (usually got Bs in nonhonors writing classes) but I spent a lot of time on my essays and got an A overall. So papers are 5 pages long and each week you  get assigned a reading (usually 20 pages long) and a prompt. For my class, prompts were pretty general like ""do experiences define one's sense of self"". Rough drafts are usually due each week and then the final paper the next. There are 5 reading assignments and there are 5 papers in total in the class. Keep in mind that you will continuously be using old reading assignments for your essays as most professors would like you to relate texts with each other.  Your grade is determined MOSTLY on the last 2 papers. My professor told me you must have at least 2 As (near the end) in order to receive an A. My grades were B, B, B, A, A. To do well, you really just have to try and figure out what your professor is looking for in the paper (mine really liked connecting points across essays) and follow it.  Tips: Go to office hours, to seek advice to improve your writing. Also go to office hours before a final paper is due so that the professor may review it. And, really spend a lot of time on the reading assignments. Take notes, highlight, try to understand what the author is trying to say and relate it to the ""bigger picture."" This will help A LOT for your essays. Some of the reading material is tough/very boring but I reread essays again and again until I fully understood the author's points.  If you got more questions reply in comments, i'll prob reply on another throwaway lol"

Just write the essays, things learned in class at least for me was not relevant to the topics."
rutgers,342xqs,Spkilla,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:38:14 2015 UTC,"expos is a game, and every professor runs it a little differently. I took basic comp first semester and got a B, then expos this semester. I failed the first two papers and the midterm, but I have since adapted my writing style to fit this professor's liking and on the third paper I got a C, fourth a B. If I get a B on the fifth then I will most likely get a B in the class. It sucks but you just have to put the work in and you'll be good."

rutgers,343udl,ashrocks94,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"Supposedly Brahmia is a leading voice in physics education, working at our Graduate School of Education. Meaning that you're in among the most capable hands in the nation in Bhramia's course, and will probably be in a data set as a guinea pig.  Don't know anything about Croft.  I believe Brahmia's research is on ""Inquiry Based Learning"" but I thought all physics and math courses were like that, even if it's hard to see sometimes. We also have lab exercises for that reason too, but apparently it's a relatively new thing and most traditional classes don't count. I guess the big thing is that asking ""how does X work?"" and then immediately telling you the answer, and having you verify/play with it with problems and labs is different than asking someone ""how does X work?"" and then answering ""lol, maybe, maybe not!"" until they figure it out are different?

rutgers,33zk5b,Drawstoria,4,Mon Apr 27 02:39:48 2015 UTC,"It definitely is. Being premed is just taking certain classes, all of which can be found online from any school's premed guide. I recommend Johns Hopkins University's guide found here: http://web.jhu.edu/prepro/Forms/Guide%20One.updated%20MASTER.pdf  I don't think it will be that difficult; you just need to put a bit of time into your work. If you aren't willing to do that, then don't consider going to med school. I myself am double majoring in BME (biomedical engineering) and CBN (Cell Biology and Neuroscience) with a minor in computer science. I am a premed studedt, and work isn't too bad. If you want to do something, you will do it."
rutgers,33zk5b,gottaloveBJ,3,Mon Apr 27 04:18:17 2015 UTC,I went through the guide and it said to take 2 upper level bio classes if I have ap bio credit. .. what would that include?
rutgers,33zk5b,somesunday,2,Mon Apr 27 10:45:02 2015 UTC,"Usually something like micro or molec bio biochem etc, they have classes listed in degree navigator under upper level bio classes if you want to look at more choices. You need Chem and Orgo for a lot of them tho so if you didn't take those yet you'd have to take them first"
rutgers,33zk5b,somesunday,2,Mon Apr 27 15:43:05 2015 UTC,Do you think it's doable if I also do summer courses each year?
rutgers,33zk5b,gottaloveBJ,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:04:10 2015 UTC,"If it's your dream go for it dude lol but like some of the other people said, it's not going to be easy and if you keep that in mind from the start it saves you from changing majors multiple times and wasting semesters like I did. Also remember that med schools do look at whether you take classes in the summer or during semester and a lot of times they think summer session is too easy. I'm not premed so I don't know specifics but I would check with a dean or someone who knows about health science majors I've definitely heard that from friends."
rutgers,33zk5b,wutwut79,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Essentials of Cell Biology and Neuroscience (course 146:295). It is meant to give an overview of Cell Bio with more of an emphasis on Neuroscience. The professor isn't too bad, and exams are pretty easy.   Other upper level classes you can take include molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, biotechnology, and microbiology. These subjects give you a large range of classes to choose from, although some may require you to take orgo before them. Try to knock out the main requirements early on."

rutgers,33zk5b,drowninginloans,3,Fri May 1 21:33:41 2015 UTC,"Only if you want to be miserable LOL. premed classes are already a huge time investment, CS classes esp upper level ones require hours and hours of work outside of class just for projects (aka coding is a bitch) taking time away from studying for your chem/orgo/whatever. Which you will need to do really well in to get into med school. If you put a language on top of that (and this depends heavily on what language you want to take) Rutgers takes language classes pretty seriously and they're not like the cakewalk you probably had in high school. I took Chinese (which is one of the harder ones most likely) and it took up a crapload of time just doing hw. Sorry for wall of text lol if you're set on medschool I would either minor in CS so you don't have to take the hardcore coding classes or pick something that requires less time investment  TLDR: I guess if you have some kind of godlike work ethic go for it? I can guarantee you will not enjoy it tho"
rutgers,33zk5b,denzil_holles,2,Mon Apr 27 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"Wait I did that. I didn't do the language but I had 2 majors, one of which was Computer Science. I also did pre-med. It wasn't that bad but I suggest you to focus on one particular option because while it's not a major school issue, maybe it's an issue on what you want to do, as there's other things you need to worry about as premed. You've got your gpa as a killer, so you can't really mess up, especially your science gpa, which you might not be able to boost up if you don't have as much time. Also you have to worry about things like shadowing, which also take up your time. It's up to you, and what you want to do."

There's plenty of time to go to med school and w/e later. I think I did pretty well. I don't think CS was that hard, but the premed stuff was hard for me so to each his own, however I also finished that stuff pretty early so maybe I was not as mature as I am now. If you know that this is what you want to do then I recommend it. If not, then take it easy and focus on one of those things for right now and finish it later. You have to do Physics/chem for CS BS anyway, and 2 sem of bio + 2 sem of orgo + orgo lab can be done in 2 years, but that's only at 8 creds a year or something. So that's really nbd.  EDIT:  I must stress that I didn't think it was the best idea for me to go to med school right away, financially or maturity-wise. That may be different for you and you might more inclined to go."

rutgers,33xrrn,ishiz,5,Sun Apr 26 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should waste your time with CS111 if you're already doing well in AP CS. The class is geared toward people who have never programmed before. Here's a list of what's taught during CS111, from the syllabus:   Fundamentals of Programming   Flowcharts Input, output, and temporary storage (variables) Mathematical computation Boolean logic Decision-making (branching) Iteration (looping)  Introductory Java Programming   Compile-time and run-time errors Objects and references Basic program framework and syntax rules Data types: boolean, int, double, char, objects/references Literals, variables, constants Operators, expressions, operator precedence Type conversion Instantiating objects, primitive and reference types null keyword Calling methods (static and non-static) Decision statements: if, if/else, if/else if/.../else Loops: do/while, while, for  Procedural Programming   Procedures (a.k.a. subroutines, functions, methods, etc.) Solving problems using recursion  Data structures   Strings Arrays (one-dimensional, two-dimensional)  Efficient Algorithms   Efficiency analysis, big-O notation Sequential search, binary search Sorting: selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort Implementation of searching and sorting algorithms  Object-Oriented Programming   Defining classes, member variables, and methods public and private modifiers    If you want to take a look at the textbook used, it's online.  My advice to you would be to:     Refresh your memory on ArrayLists, how they work under-the-hood and how they differ from normal arrays Implement some basic algorithms using recursive functions (factorial, reversing a string or array, etc. are good examples) Refresh your memory on Object Oriented programming (defining classes, instantiating and using objects, class member access keywords like public/private/static and what they mean, etc). Get comfortable thinking about algorithm efficiency analysis, which is used frequently in CS112 It is extremely important for you to know algorithm efficiency analysis (number 5 on the above list, chapter 8 in the textbook). You should know how algorithms trade space (disk or memory) for running speed, and Big-O notation. What does it mean when someone talks about an algorithm's ""best-case"", ""average-case"", or ""worst-case"" running time? Learn how sequential (linear), binary, selection, and insertion searching algorithms work for arrays of sorted and unsorted integers. You should make notes on how they work and be comfortable implementing them in Java using those notes. You should also commit to memory the best and worst cases for those algorithms. Knowing all that, what algorithms are preferable in what scenarios? Do the same for 6 but with heapsort and quicksort.   Important topics that are not taught until CS112 include:     Data structures other than arrays (linked lists, trees, etc) Exceptions, throwing and catching Generic types   Good luck, if you have any questions reply or PM me."
rutgers,33xrrn,kaushalp88,2,Mon Apr 27 04:36:22 2015 UTC,"How comfortable are you with basic cs fundamentals and their applications?

Easy walk, and on cold days you have the EE bus (free Rutgers bus, runs from 7am to 3am, every 10 minutes or less). Other Bloustein students live down Livingston. Less desirable (ie, sketchier), no Rutgers bus, but easier bike ride. Downtown is somewhat affordable with a roommate.

rutgers,33ueub,thebruns,2,Sun Apr 26 01:48:42 2015 UTC,"Why would you go to Bloustein and then live in an isolated suburb?   Lol, the irony of attending an urban planning program and living in a suburb hasn't passed over me. Living in Highland Park is definitely something I don't want to do but the rent there is so much more affordable. I'm glad you're able to give me some insight on it though.  What do you think of the safety of houses near the Douglas campus? One of the students told me to avoid the area. When you say Livingston Ave is sketchy, does that necessarily mean it's had a history of crime or is it just kind of rundown? Downtown is definitely my number one choice if I can find something affordable. What do you think of living west of the main campus? (Easton Ave, Hamilton St, etc.).  And I'll keep on the look out for oil heated houses lol."
rutgers,33ueub,OldFashionedLoverBoi,2,Sun Apr 26 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"The Douglass area can be sketchy depending on the area because it's where most of the New Brunswick natives (non-students) live. The safest spots are the ones closest to campus buildings, so the closer to are to Nichol Ave, the better. There's also the Public Safety building at the intersection of Commercial Ave and George Street, so that's a pretty safe area because it's RUPD headquarters. Douglass is definitely your best bet. Housing might not be as nice as Highland Park, but it's a MUCH easier commute with Rutgers buses and so much closer to the academic environment with libraries and stuff."
rutgers,33ueub,zobiso,2,Sun Apr 26 18:37:46 2015 UTC,Ok great thank you. I think I can cross Highland Park off my list then.
rutgers,33ueub,OldFashionedLoverBoi,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"One thing I forgot to mention: The sidewalk on the bridge to Highland avenue does NOT get plowed or treated for ice. So during the snow months, youll find a whole bunch of Bloustein students who are all about walking driving their cars half a mile.   I lived in a house by Douglas for 2 years. My bike was stolen (piece of junk) but aside from that we were fine. I do know of a Bloustein house that was robbed but I believe someone was careless when it happened (ie, made it obvious the house was to be empty all weekend).   Yes the further south you go from the downtown the more crime reports youll find. However, Ive never heard of a Bloustein student being mugged. There ARE muggings west of the Easton Avenue/Hamilton section of town, and youll want to avoid that area due to all the undergrads anyway. I would live no more than 2 block from the corner of Easton and Hamilton. There are a few Bloustein students that live in some of the new (but pricey) studio apartments in the area. Their only complaint has been noise on weekends (frat parties, screaming drunk kids)."

rutgers,33ueub,Thomsenite,2,Sun Apr 26 01:13:15 2015 UTC,Biking throughout the NB area is a lot better than what google maps makes it out to be. There are plenty of bike paths and roads with large bicycle lanes which can get you from Douglass to Livingston and all the towns in between.
rutgers,33ueub,Thomsenite,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:55:16 2015 UTC,Right but I'm specifically worried about the safety of the Raritan Ave bridge and the interchange. Everywhere else looks fine to me.
rutgers,33ueub,bigassnug,2,Sun Apr 26 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"It isn't ideal but it is not terrible either. There is a sidewalk on the side that you would take to be safe.   This area is really dangerous for biking, college kids that have never driven around cyclists don't understand how to and a lot of the older people in the area think you should be on the sidewalk. New Brunswick is a real shit show for cycling."

rutgers,33vcgz,nednik,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you're an incoming freshman, you don't really need to worry about the Core. You'll probably knock out at least a fourth of it by accident. If you're majoring in math, some of your courses should qualify for QR/QQ, and whatever you're minoring in should get rid of more. Not to mention, some classes knock out more than one Core requirement.   But if you want advice on specific courses:   21st century: African, Middle Eastern, and South Asian Languages in Peril was a ton of fun, online, and not too assignment heavy. No final exam and your final project is compiling a wiki page. Also fulfills ITR.   Introduction to the Modern Middle East was pretty writing-intensive, but fascinating b/c it went into a lot of the 20th century history that led to the 21st century problems. It was a 21st & AHo. Also, the prof was hot.   Natural Sciences: I attended exactly four classes of Earthquakes & Volcanoes, and two were the exams. It's a lot more boring than the name suggests but it was easy as long as you study beforehand.   Intro to Human Evolution: The labs were hard but all the crazy casts of early humanoid skulls were great. The exams were comparatively easy.   Expository Writing & Research in the Disciplines (aka, Expos 2) suck. Actually most of the Core writing classes suck.

Edit: Looking through my comment history it seems I already wrote about this before   According to this page Rutgers spends 8.9% of its budget on housing, dining, and other ""Auxiliary enterprises."" I can't find how much they spend on dining alone, but assuming it's half that figure then Rutgers spends $160.2m on dining per year. The article says Rutgers saves $300k by removing trays from 3/4 dining halls over the span of ten weeks. That's $1.2m for all dining halls for 30 weeks (ignoring summer and winter), or 0.75% of their dining budget, or $17 off the current price for a 210 meal plan ($2293)."

The crowdedness of my exams in 111 was so bad and the CS department isn't very strict so cellphones were going off. It was so distracting. In 112, some guy sits in the back eating during the exam.

It worked out because I also didn't have the financial aid to actually go and would've needed more loans.   During my semester at CC again, I paid for the PTK membership and reapplied to Rutgers in January and when I got my letter in April/May, I freaked out.

One thing I cannot stand is how they try to convince you that you're their friend and they miss you, but do not bother to say anything at all for over a month at a time. I made ""friends"" in acting class, but I only talk to one still and whenever I did see the others, they were saying hi to everyone because they seem to know everyone. I need to stay away from the people like that because the reality, I have nothing in common with them. I'm just glad I have one friend back home that I can count on any time any day.

rutgers,33pm5y,-iSqueezeAutists-,5,Fri Apr 24 13:52:06 2015 UTC,"1) No idea about practice but iirc, it was a very easy exam going from very basic math through trig and precalc. All it can do for you, basically, is place you out of precalc and Calc 1 (which is good because really the only other option is to have AP or other credit transfer) And it won't help with other math courses like placing you out of Stats or anything.  2) You'll fit in just fine not being a party animal. And the campus won't really matter since the parties and the rest of life rarely intrude upon one another but Busch campus is not a party campus. Besides having the premeds, engineers, and other nerds taking the hard classes, there isn't much off-campus housing and therefore few places a party can even be thrown. (and they're like houses by the stadium so it's not even noticeable from campus like it could be on College Ave)  3) Take Intro Bio and Gen Chem first because they'll be prerequisite courses you need to have done (with above a D, of course) for almost any course you need for your premed requirements. And the labs for those.  late edit: and then Orgo/Lab"

Stay away from our Math Department and make sure to study the bus schedules/stops carefully and you should enjoy your stay.  Hopefully.  At the moment you are experiencing the first stages of what is known as the ""RU Screw"".  Google it, and prepare yourself for being lost in a byzantine maze of bureaucracy and obscurantism that would make Kafka cringe.  1) It's been a while but IIRC you can place out of Calc 151 at the very least.  That's Calc 1.  Not sure about English.  The placement tests were not that hard.  In fact sometimes I fantasize about somehow taking the placement test again so I can place out of the nightmarish hell that is a Rutgers math course.  What tricks are you referring to :P?  2) A lot more of us are boring (which is what you really mean :P) than you'd think.  It should be easy to make friends provided you aren't a wallflower.  People are people.  The trick is to find something you have in common.  It doesn't HAVE to be parties, etc.  What are your interests/hobbies?

My school has 3 orchestra levels from lowest to highest (repertoire, symphony, and chamber) I'm still in the rep orchestra while most seniors have moved on to chamber (you have to pass an audition for it) I've become more serious about the cello in my Junior and Senior year, but I don't think I'm good enough to join the Rutgers orchestra (or am I?).

rutgers,33pm5y,dabkilm2,2,Fri May 1 20:14:58 2015 UTC,"First congrats and glad you're coming! 1) If you're planning on med school, the placement tests are a joke. I didn't take an English placement test but the math one was so easy; have to know really basic algebra, trig, and some manipulation of logs. No calculus. The highest you can place in it is 640:151 (calc 1 for eng/phys) which you'll have to take if you don't have AP credit for calc 1.  2) As other people mentioned, you'll definitely fit in fine not being a party animal. I'm the same way and I'll be living on Busch next year. From having classes on Busch every year, I really like the atmosphere and think that I fit in well there. It's extremely easy to make friends, especially in that first two weeks of being a freshman. Just introduce yourself to everyone you meet and you'll be surprised with how many people stick with you; remember, you're all in the same boat and no one wants to go at it alone. Extra curriculars like clubs and intramurals are definitely great ways to find friends but you'll have plenty of friends just by living around others.   3) I've had friends do Biology and Chemistry at the same time. As others said, it's not impossible. The worst that happens is that you drop one in the first few weeks before you get a W for withdrawing from the class and then take it during the summer so you're not behind,   4) As I recalled, freshman register for classes in the summer, either at an orientation or on their own. Things were slightly tweaked for me as an engineering student if I remember correctly. As for ratemyprofessor.com, instead, just ask facebook groups pertaining to the specific subject about professors. If you take their suggestions with a grain of salt, they usually provide an idea of a professor's teaching style.    If you have any questions, just feel free to message me!"

rutgers,33pm5y,08230911,2,Sat Apr 25 06:43:31 2015 UTC,"For question number 2, don't worry about fitting in or making friends. Rutgers is a massive school and practically a city of its own. There are people of every type and interest around, making connections just won't be a problem here. Each of the subcampuses have different atmospheres, but you can find any type of person on any one of them. Busch seems like a good fit for you to have as a home base."
rutgers,33pm5y,gingersnap72,2,Fri Apr 24 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"For English writing for students who English is not the native language there is possible placement into English as Academic Discourse either Fundamentals (3:56:154) or Level 1 (3:56:155) or Level II (356:156).  Non-native English speakers may place into any of the following as well.  For native English speakers there is possible placement into Composition Skills (355:098), Basic Composition (355:100) or Basic Composition with Reading (355:100/099 or ""100R""), or Expository Writing (355:101).  All students at Rutgers University-New Brunswick regardless of school will have to take (or get credit for the equivalent of) Expository Writing.    For math possible placements are Computational Mathematics (in which students take Elementary Algebra with a special computational mathematics section [025 with 001 as a co-requisite]), Elementary Algebra (Math 025), Intermediate Algebra (Math 026), Intermediate Mathematics (Math 026 or Math 103), College Mathematics (Math 111 or Math for Elementary Teaching), Pre-calculus (which can include placement in the two semester version 111&112, or the one semester version 115), or Calculus (Math 135 or Math 151). Math placement test goes up to Precalculus so logs, exponents, unit circle, etc.  If you got a 600+ on SAT CR or 30+ on ACT English then you're exempt from the English placement test. If you got a 4/5 on AP Calc exam during your JUNIOR year then you're exempt from math. Also, since you're in SAS, you have to take a foreign language placement test.  As for registering for classes, you have to attend an APA dayon May 2nd or May 9th(mandatory unless you seriously cant make it) where you meet with an adviser and choose your classes. If you don't attend, you can try meeting with an adviser if they have time but if not then they'll choose your classes for you.

Also, whoever told you that taking bio and chem together is ""impossible"" -- remove these people from your life. As a Rutgers grad and current med student, my sincere advice: students aspiring for med school should not be shying away from challenges early on. If you run into trouble, find help, and figure out a way to overcome. Even getting a C or two your first year of college isn't the worst thing in the world, granted you are flexible enough to figure out what went wrong, and then prove by improving your grades moving on. Surround yourself with positive influences that motivate you and push you to be better than the average. It's just like anything else in life, you'll probably play the best basketball or soccer of your life if you just started playing on an NBA team, simply because those people around you are so good. You get the analogy.   BA/MD- if you're thinking about med school, APPLY BA/MD. Don't worry if you dont get it, most people dont. But get rec-letters early, get the paper work done, and just apply. If you get in, awesome you just saved about 20K tuition and a year of education. If you dont, well the med schools keep your application on file and when you apply as a normal applicant, they see that you had shown prior interest and it always counts as a plus. Essentially you have nothing to lose and everything to gain."

rutgers,33hmdi,JorgeCS,32,Wed Apr 22 16:48:04 2015 UTC,"Every new skyscraper built in New Brunswick is going to be ""out of place"". Booting out the grease trucks (and the organic social space that they facilitated) was certainly a bad move, but how is a giant parking lot any more out of place then student apartments? How else do you solve a student housing capacity crisis except by building more residence halls and apartments? Contextually, the River Dorms and Clothier are ""out of place"" because of their height but ""out of place"" connotes an incompatible use (e.g. a sewerage plant, factory building), rather than scale.   I think it's fair to disagree with the public-private nature of the construction. DEVCO originally wanted the apartments 100% outsourced/privatized but Rutgers pushed back against it. A third-party developer (that was neither DEVCO or Rutgers) is involved, and there's almost certainly a profit motive here in a way that other major capital expansions don't have a profit motive (at least until recently). Additionally, Rutgers owns the land itself and is leasing the building to DEVCO, who is then ""renting"" the building back to Rutgers. Such a complicated financial arrangement really wouldn't happen unless there was money to be made here. And you can almost certainly bet these costs will be paid for by all students, and not just the ones living in the building."
rutgers,33hmdi,mcnultysbluecavalier,7,Wed Apr 22 17:28:21 2015 UTC,People complained in the 1990s when Rutgers confined the Grease Trucks to one parking lot instead of letting them spread out.
rutgers,33hmdi,EwBrunswick,2,Wed Apr 22 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"I worked on basically the same type of project but at TCNJ and while there certainly is money to be made, it's looked at, by those investing private money in the project, as a much more safe investment than a typical apartment building. Because of that safety, they're willing (and do) to accept a lower rate of return."
rutgers,33hmdi,FamiliarCow,3,Thu Apr 23 11:56:03 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to Campus Town? If so, I believe you're correct in its safety as an investment (especially when you have a built-in student market whose parents can afford their kids' rents in a new apartment building).   That being said, I think Campus Town and Lot 8 apartments are different animals. From what I was told, TCNJ has very little outlay for their project. They leased out their land for essentially nothing and the developer (PRC) built the facilities out of their own pocket, give or take a tax break. The College may have spent their own money to demo the on site buildings, but PRC is building the project themselves. Those construction costs will eventually be recouped by the users of Campus Town (commercial/residential tenants).  For the Lot 8 apartments, Rutgers is still on the hook for the construction costs. DEVCO was used in part because the Seminary/Hillel land swap was complex and hit a number of dead ends before DEVCO entered the picture. DEVCO was then able to also secure the Transit Hub Tax Credit for the project that was worth some $30 million. The NJ Economic Development Authority had to vote to approve the College Ave project receiving the tax credit ahead of a number of other projects that were more perhaps more deserving (the tax credit is to incentivize residential projects within a certain radius of a train station, and why student apartments required such a tax credit is dubious). Additionally, a few DEVCO employees or trustees have key connections or pasts with the NJEDA, so the project was a shoe-in.   With the exception of the academic buildings (paid for largely by the Proposition 1 bond measure), Rutgers is largely on the hook for the College Ave redevelopment. Unlike Campus Town, university functions (housing) will occupy the building. If it were privatized housing, then the rents could be priced in such a way to directly recoup project costs. Those prices would be even crazier than what they most likely will be when the building opens. But because Rutgers is essentially renting the building for 30 or 50 years, it will shell out the money as a university to rent the money rather than just having the building users pay for it.   If someone is more familiar with this project please correct me if this understanding is misguided."

rutgers,33hmdi,EwBrunswick,18,Thu Apr 23 10:17:57 2015 UTC,"I think it will certainly add to the college experience by putting more bodies on College Ave on the weekends. Stroll around Princeton on a weekend and the campus always has people walking back and forth. At Rutgers, college ave proper and the voorhees mall are dead outside of class hours (Easton obviously is another story). Having so many people living right there will mean more action at all hours, and make the place feel less like a commuter school. It should also help out downtown."
rutgers,33hmdi,URETHRAL_DIARRHEA,11,Wed Apr 22 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but most of the reason why the Princeton campus is a popular walking spot is because it's an ivy league school with beautiful architecture and a campus environment, and it sits across the street from a upscale downtown area.  Aside from Voorhees Mall, College Ave. is architecturally very meh, is far enough from downtown NB so as to not benefit from the foot traffic there and is surrounded by neighborhoods that are less than safe. Noone is going to make a Saturday day trip to walk around Voorhees Mall and then hop back in the car to go home. The campus and the city are too fragmented to be a pedestrian friendly place that people want to spend a day in."
rutgers,33hmdi,icevermin,7,Wed Apr 22 18:14:05 2015 UTC,"I think this is overstating the effect of beautiful architecture: it's the businesses and diversity of uses at Princeton that are driving the foot traffic. A standard strip mall with a Shop Rite is busier than Voorhees Mall on any given weekend, and I don't think anyone would describe strip mall architecture as inspiring (at least in comparison to Voorhees Mall).   Also, the Rutgers-Princeton comparison doesn't account for how much wealthier Princeton is (as a university and a city) than New Brunswick. Very few NB shops (especially in the Sixth Ward) can stand on their own without a student population, except maybe somewhere like Thomas Sweets. Princeton can support any number of boutique shops or restaurants that keep people visiting and spending money, whereas those kinds of stores don't last too long in NB. I don't have the data to show that Princeton students are largely wealthier than Rutgers students as a whole, but it is telling that Princeton has a large number of highbrow businesses that NB doesn't.   I'm not implying by any means that Princeton is ""better"" than NB, but it's an apples to oranges comparison."
rutgers,33hmdi,RUseaweed,5,Wed Apr 22 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"I think for lot 8, the size isnt the issue, but the architecture is. As you said, Princeton architecture is a destination. This new dorm will look like New Brunswick Highrise #9, not Rutgers building!  I disagree that the city and campus is too fragmented for visiting, especially with the museum. One can eat at Harvest Moon, browse Barnes and Noble, visit the museum, walk the voorhees mall, and finish off at another downtown bar.   What makes it fragmented is the ugly architecture and some ugly street (George St by college ave looks like a highway).  That COULD be easily fixed. Also, the rail underpasses right now act as a barrier because theyre so wet and dark."

I also did not know too well what I wanted to major in once I got here; however, the cool thing about RBS is that you will have the opportunity to double major. So even though business may not necessarily be your thing, you can work towards a major in the field that interests you the most.  If you are coming here, what I can tell you is that you will be required to take mathematics up to Calc 1 or ""Basic Calc."" So if you do not place into Calc, you will take pre-calc or maybe even trig & college algebra. You will also take English 101 and 102. I believe you can AP out of these classes though, so if you can, good for you. These are part of your pre-requisite classes for business.  As far as going to MCC, it's better to ask an adviser, if you have one assigned to you already. You don't want to waste your money at MCC. I can PM you what my schedule looks like this semester.

It's a good idea to run your plan by the SOE deans office just to make sure you're on the right track as well.

Instead of looking for ""easy"" classes, look for classes that will help you in grad school, or focus on an area that you have an interest in pursuing for a career, or something you think might just be marketable.  A psych degree by itself will land you approximately 0 jobs, but the specific skills you pick up from some of these elective classes can get you a foot in the door.  Especially if you're looking into grad programs.  Having some specific skills and knowledge most other grads in your program don't will put you at a distinct advantage.

rutgers,33iymh,superpony123,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the easiest things will be ones that interest you, at least that's MOSTLY been my experience. I say mostly because I was interested in physiological psych, and that class kicked my ass. Then again, I was only a sophomore when I took it and had never taken a bio class in college so if I had I think it would have been a lot easier. But that class is very biological and pretty challenging. Would not recommend taking it (although it does fulfill one of the psych degree requirements) unless you have already taken a class like gen bio in college. HS bio (even AP, which most of the time is not on the same level as rutgers bio) really doesnt prepare you for that class.  I'm a psych major. The classes that I had the easiest time with were:  Sensation and Perception with John McGann. If you can take it with him, do it, because hes a really cool professor, all his exams are based off the slides--you dont even need the book. Now I took that class with him years ago but I know he still teaches it (though maybe not every semester) and I imagine he teaches it roughly thesame. I found the material very interesting and he does his best to make class very fun to come to-does a lot of cool demonstrations and stuff, hes very engaging with the class.  Infant and Child Development (Vivian Hsu). Generally not a hard class, if you go to class and do some reading (honestly I didnt read the book half the time, but did find the exams way easier if I read the book).   Abnormal Psych (Lyra Stein) - I am super interested in abnormal psych, but this class was honestly super easy.Never needed the book, EVERYTHING you need to know is in her slideshows which she posts online. As long as you know the slides, you are good. She does do iclicker quizzes during class, but you can have the powerpoint open on your computer and look something up if you need to..they're not hard questions. And they count as extra credit after a certain amount of points. Her exams were very straightforward multiple choice.  Clinical & School Psych - it's only taught by two professors and they teach the class together. I forget their names. I only went to class like half the time but they do clicker quizzes which do count, but I think they counted for very little and they didnt count all of them. LIke you havd to get a certain amount of points but you dont need to go all the time to get those points. Their exams are fairly easy and straightforward multi choice, there is no textbook, everything you need is in their slides. There was a project but it was very very easy..I did it in like 2-3 hours maybe.  I wasnt really interested in this class, I took it because I needed another psych class and had to change my schedule last min, this was the only thing that fit my schedule. It was a good choice.  Atypical Adolescent development - i forget the professors name but i think only one lady teaches it. I liked her a lot, shes very funny, and has a lot of  interesting stories. Abnormal psych is a prereq for this class, and if you retained info from abnormal psych this class will be a breeze because it's mostly a repeat of abnormal psych just with more attention paid to youth and stuff.  STAY AWAY FROM HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY WITH CHAPMAN. That class is painfully boring. I thought it would be interesting because I love health related stuff and Im going to nursing school after I graduate. The professor just isnt the greatest. She covers a TON of material and youre expected to remember a lot of fine details to shit like specific research papers and it's just not worth it TBH. Also her exams are really short (like 25-30 multiple choice then an essay) for the amount of material that she covers. IE she only tests you on like half the material that you covered, but you have no idea what shes going to test you on, so it feels like a waste and got frustrating. I should have listened to the rate my professor reviews for this lady (everything said easy to get a B, hard to get an A, extremely boring class) but I didnt. I regret taking that class, I got a B in it.   stay away from Adolescent development with Dickson - similar case to chapmans health pscyh - expects you to remember a ton of shit but doesnt really test you on everything, so you feellike you did a ton of reading for nothing. she sucks at lecturing. if you read the book you should do ok but it takes more effort to get an A."

We were told that registration would be handled at the orientation, and with my email to the program director assuring me not to register, I waited, even though commuter parking passes went on sale before orientation.  Now I'm at orientation, and the reason I was told to wait for registration was because they wanted to teach us how to use webreg, which I obviously am familiar with already.  After registering, I immediately try to get a parking pass, but Busch campus is sold out.  I try to explain my case, that I spend 50+ hours working on Busch campus and am planning on moving into the Ph.D. program (where I would get a staff pass) but they don't bite.  So for the last year I've been commuting an hour to school and then riding a 30 minute bus to Busch campus instead of parking on Busch, because Rutgers doesn't give a shit about masters students.  Not a horrible thing, but the most recent thing that I am reminded of every morning.  There's other things I've been bothered by throughout my time as an undergrad (meal plans, webreg, not trusting administration to have my name on the graduation list, etc)"
rutgers,33f8rw,picasso_penis,8,Wed Apr 22 02:20:29 2015 UTC,"My first semester of my masters program, I register for classes no problem.  Then a week before class starts, they cancel one of my classes due to ""low enrollment"".  So I register for another class.  On the first day of class, I go and there is no one there but one other student.  After waiting an hour, we go home. The next day I get an email saying that the class is canceled again.  By this time, registration is long closed and classes had been going on for the better part of a week.  There are no more open graduate level classes I can take, so I'm forced to jump through all kinds of hoops and get approval from a bunch of people to enroll in an undergraduate class.  By the time everything is done, its like the third week of classes and I'm already way behind on the material and had missed a few homeworks.  Also, one time I got a parking ticket and when I pay it I see that the office has my old address listed.  I call them up to correct their mistake, but they keep transferring me to student records.  Student records has my correct information, so they transfer me back to parking enforcement.  This goes back and forth for a few days until I get a woman on the phone who will actually listen to why I'm calling before redirecting me.  She tells me that each office is on its own network, which is not connected to any other office network, so this sort of thing happens all of the time because they can't share information."

So I couldnt work on my papers or study in my room. It got down to 30 degrees one night. It killed our fish and broke my hard drive. I started sleeping in the lounges til winter break and a significant part of the first few weeks of spring.  We made multiple complaints to housing, reslife, and maintenance.  We even talked to the ombudsperson but nothing ever came of it. The stress and lack of a home caused me to drop my gpa by a significant amount. I talked to the reslife director and he said he only had one complaint from our dorm about it. Which means that Michael Fitzgerald was a very incompetant reslife director if he was unaware of whats going on in his organization.  Thanks for costing me a ten thousand dollar semester, buddy.     Let this be a lesson. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. Preserve your GPA. Worry about graduating on time later. You will actually save time.    And dont trust anyone in administration. Get everything in writing, keep all your receipts, and read all the fine print.    In case this happens to anyone again, be aware that there is a city ordnance that states that all residences MUST be kept above 55 degrees F, at their owners responsibility.

I thought I was being helpful to an undergrad student on this sub who had a question, but here it goes. A few years ago I'm really making progress at completing my undergrad when I noticed on my degree navigate (should actually be called degree labyrinthine maze of use to fucking nobody) that a ton of my requirements changed and ones that were fulfilled had now suddenly NOT been fulfilled. I made sure I was super thorough and met with an academic advisor/dean every semester to make sure I was doing this shit right. At the time, one of the academic deans at the hall on Cook/Douglass (name of the hall escapes me) told me that the degree navigator's ""algorithm had changed"" and that depending on which class I took, different requirements would be fulfilled, but that only one class fulfills one requirement each. I was so confused. Somehow, I managed to make my schedule every semester, get it checked by a dean/advisor for SAS, and then checked by the academic advisor of Mason Gross (I majored in music education/voice at MGSA initially, but transferred to SAS for the regular BA music track.) TL;DR--Rutgers probably not knowing enough about their own shit when changes are implemented and gave me the runaround."
rutgers,33f8rw,ArtemisLives,2,Wed Apr 22 11:49:50 2015 UTC,"Was a member of a club on campus.  We did a significant amount of fundraising and had a few thousand dollars in our SABO account. At some point facilities wouldn't let us rent out room space because there was some sort of hold on our account.  After calling around we found out that the hold was for $27.  They couldn't tell us what it was for though.  No one could tell us what it was for, but we couldn't reserve any more space in any student center due to this $27 hold, despite the fact that we had several thousand dollars in our SABO account.  We had been good about paying for things we needed to pay for and couldn't find any invoices or anything to Rutgers that we owed, and no one in facilities, SABO, student life, etc. could tell us who we needed to pay.  But we still couldn't reserve any space for any events due to this $27 hold.  We eventually got some dean to talk to someone at facilities and let us to reserve space by personally guaranteeing that she'd pay this $27 hold if it came to it, and actually writing them a letter and getting it notarized.  Weeks later it turns out that facilities hadn't cashed a check we had had SABO send them months earlier for the $27 in question.  The absolutely insane thing to me is that - according to what we were told - there was no way for them to see why this hold was on our account or whatever."

I was tasked to completed TASK A that is very pertinent to a specific DEPARTMENT B. The actual details are irrelevant.  Anyway, I developed and rolled out the platform that fulfilled TASK A with GREAT results. We got 96% participation response. The response was so GOOD that the department heads contacted me directly to learn more. I gave them access and a demo account before the end of the year.  The pilot turned out really successful and I decided to file a formal proposal to roll out the platform across the entire campus... but it would NOT be free. Fair market price would be at least 10K+...  I would have done it for a lot less.  Anyway, I sent out a formalized proposal... crickets. Resent it a second time and got an ""away on vacation proposal."" By this time, I figured the school was not interested.  In late August I am sitting in Department B's student training. The lead for TASK A is presenting... before he begins his presentation he bluntly asks, ""can any students do TASK A... we are looking to move TASK A to the web.""  I LITERALLY imploded. I could not fathom - ""How do you bluntly ignore my request and then spit this ** out in front of me!?""  I calmly stood up and called him out - proceeded to tell everyone what exactly happened... The next couple of days I found myself sitting in my supervisor's office.

The apartments tend to be new and in much better shape than the student housing stock (which is mostly converted single-family homes), but also much pricier.   http://www.apartmentguide.com/apartments/New-Jersey/New-Brunswick/"

Also, if you want to escape the heat, the first floor where the towers meet, are air conditioned so grab your laptop and chill down there for a bit. The room i had was really nice. It was very clean when i got there. I had a single and it was pretty roomy.  I would not have more than like 3 people in the room, it isnt really that big. Bathrooms were meh. I am a male so the usual stuff from a mans bathroom and some bizzare and horrific things but generally really good. Most people are freshmen and a few transfers. The age range is 18 to 21.   All in all, it was good. After the heat goes away, you get to know your floor mates and people in other floors. The location was really nice. You are really in the middle of Livi. The elevators tend to be slow and have been known to jam up. Transfer students try to cook and fail which cause the fire alarm to go off once in a while. It isnt the best housing but its not the worst. That is all i can think of right now."

In fact, the program as a whole finished the year with an excess of $1,996,036. Meanwhile (with the exception of men's basketball), the other sports collectively cost the student body over $10 million in fees as well as an additional $26 million of university funds.

rutgers,33ehaf,ruscreww,5,Tue Apr 21 21:32:43 2015 UTC,"I was enrolled in a 1.5 online course that I ultimately withdrew from on the last day to withdraw from, because I dropped another 3 credit course, making it a useless course.   So you spent a significant amount of time enrolled in the class, and I assume this was long after the add-drop period.   There was a $60 course fee (I don't believe it had anything to do with the webcams), but does anyone actually know what the fee actually goes to?   The cost of running the course, particularly the cost of licencing the software or the cost of developing the online curriculum and resources.    My rationale is it makes no sense why I am obligated to pay $60 for a course I'm not even enrolled in and additionally, I'm not utilizing any of the resources the fee would cover (whatever it actually does cover).   You're in college, you don't pay for use, you pay for access. You had access to that resource, and decided not to use it.    I understand it's policy, but she then proceeded with ""Although you didn't participate in the class, your registration did prevent another student from taking your seat...and for that you're accountable.""   Because if a class being designed for 20 kids costs an extra $1200 to develop and 1 kid doesn't pay his course fee, that means the department loses $60 and has to fire a grad student.    Also, maybe even go as far as not blaming her for being apart of it because she has a PHD (in a useless field), so I understand why she chose to become a dean.   Are you actually retarded? How is her PhD useless if it got her a job as a dean?    Might be a bit personal, but at this point, it doesn't seem like I will be getting a refund so I might as well get a good laugh/satisfaction for $60.   Protip: don't burn bridges with people who can decide weather you not you graduate on time."

How is her PhD useless if it got her a job as a dean?  Although it's cynical, let's break this down simply. Undergrad in Bio + PHD in Genetics and Development = dean. As a whole, for that much time, money and school, there just aren't many high paying jobs in the field. There's a reason a majority of deans and administrators enter academia (majority have PHD's); there aren't many other fields to enter aside from research or continuing academia because it's all they know by the time they get out and are essentially over qualified for most jobs. So, this cycle continues, and universities (Rutgers especially) continue to operate as profit making, brainwashing institutions (with extensive prereqs, requirements, and rules) controlled by liberals (because of extensive schooling and not much experience in the real world has made them this way).

As a whole, for that much time, money and school, there just aren't many high paying jobs in the field.   That depends largely on your specific field, the quality of your institution, and your performance as a graduate student/ Graduate students coming from elite programs with solid publication records can usually find jobs in academia if they choose. Students from strong programs generally find employment in the government or private sector, but may not be able to push into academia without a post-doc. For example, in the department I worked for as an undergrad, all of the graduate students who graduated managed to attain full time positions for the government or private consulting firms, except 2 student who went on to post-doc positions in California (Berkeley and UCLA, I believe).   It's important to remember that for PhD candidates in the sciences, academia is much tougher to break into than the private or public non-academic sectors.   There's a reason a majority of deans and administrators enter academia (majority have PHD's); there aren't many other fields to enter aside from research or continuing academia because it's all they know by the time they get out and are essentially over qualified for most jobs.

As the article points out, once Rutgers is a full member of the Big Ten, the shortfall should be covered.    In an April 8 interview with The Daily Targum, Barchi said the University’s athletic spending deficit is likely to return to a neutral position by the first year Rutgers becomes a full member of the Big Ten conference.  “My commitment when I came here was to get us back into a cost-neutral situation in athletics, and that’s what I intend to do,” he said. “The key ingredient there was getting us into the Big Ten … we are probationary members for a period of years and then we become full members.”   Also, this data is from the 2013-2014 fiscal year, when Rutgers was in the failing AAC, and had not yet entered the Big Ten. The 2014-2015 numbers should show significant revenue improvement, as attendance and ticket prices were up last year."

rutgers,338wjr,milkymanchester,4,Tue Apr 21 14:21:18 2015 UTC,"I just want to veer away from the normal arguments in favor of athletics spending and look at it from a different perspective, so please bear with me.  Rutgers has 638 athletes competing in 24 sports.  Two of those sports generate a positive revenue:  football and basketball.    There are 65,000 Rutgers students, all of which pay student fees.  For each student, roughly $145 of their school fees go towards athletics programs (9,500,000 total).  This is not an insignificant amount, but it is also not outrageous.  Maybe the school should consider an opt-out procedure for this fee, similar to NJ PIRG fees.  The athletics department is not the only department at Rutgers that loses money.  Rutgers spends 794.8 million on professors and instructors every year, who generate roughly 663.4 million in grants.  To be facetious, maybe the school should cut 131 million worth of professors and instructors to get that part of the university back to a revenue neutral point.  The school also spends 297.7 million on scholarships and fellowships.  How many of those scholarships generate revenue for the university?  Housing staff costs 59.5 million, definitely no revenue there.   Libraries cost 36 million.  I have never been in a library at Rutgers.  I print from my department’s computer lab and I study in my room.  So should I not have to pay for this expense because I do not use it?  I understand why people do not care about athletics and do not want to subsidize them.  Unfortunately, athletics are now seen as a big part of the state college experience.  If you cut them, you quickly go down a rabbit hole of other cuts.  If you are totally uninvolved in university-sponsored student life, I am sure this is 100% okay with you.  But if you are involved in just one university-sponsored student group, then you have to be for athletics or else you are volunteering for your group to be defunded as well (unless your group is revenue neutral)."

To be fair, ""It marked only the second time in at least a decade that Rutgers' football program has been self-sustaining, meaning it didn't rely on money from the university's general operating budget to fuel its budget.""  As for the stadium costs mentioned below, this is a little bit more difficult to figure out.  I am sure the stadium is expensive to maintain.  They recently expanded it (I think?) which costs a lot.  However, the stadium is also rented out to generate revenue and is covered in ads and a naming sponsorship, which I am sure offset those costs significantly."

Also, your only chance to take expos at a community college is this summer -- once you become matriculated at Rutgers they will no longer accept transfer credits for expos and will force you to take it at Rutgers.  Other than expos, any class related to your majors should be fine to get out of the way. If you're planning on going into CS precalc and CS111 equivalent would give you a huge head start because CS111 is a pre-requisite for every other CS course.   In my opinion I would stay away from taking the equivalent of Calculus 1 because Calc 2 highly depends on Calc 1 and in my experience  my local community college left out a lot of important topics from Calc 1."
rutgers,33ah16,ishiz,5,Tue Apr 21 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"Expos. You'll probably have to take 2 courses at community college to fulfill this requirement, but its absolutely worth it."
rutgers,33ah16,Ryality,4,Mon Apr 20 23:30:59 2015 UTC,I highly recommend this especially if you suck at writing like me.
rutgers,33ah16,somekid150,3,Tue Apr 21 02:31:35 2015 UTC,"If you need to take them, I would suggest taking calc 1/2 at CC. Calc 3 and above are fine here though."
rutgers,33ah16,Lawlington,2,Tue Apr 21 00:25:26 2015 UTC,"It's gonna depend on your major. If you're science do one of the core sciences that is least related to your major. If you're a microbio major, take physics 1 and physics lab over the summer.  Or math classes like calc 1-2 or stats."
rutgers,33ah16,JesusPoopsOreos,2,Tue Apr 21 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"Try to take the equivalent of Expository Writing here. Apparently it's ridiculously difficult here, but I took the equivalent at Rutgers Camden and apparently dodged quite a bullet. Whatever classes you do intend to take, make sure you complete BOTH parts of a two-part class (Biology I and Biology II, for example). If you only take one part, Rutgers will not count it and you have to start over."
rutgers,33ah16,zerachechiel,2,Tue Apr 21 01:56:33 2015 UTC,"Any expos/composition class, calculus, physics, bio, chem, intro programming classes.  If you can take it at a community college do it. The lighter your course load is here the better.  There are far more things to distract you at Rutgers than a CC.  Are you declaring a major/any specific majors that interest you?  Would help us to better advise you."

rutgers,33ah16,FrostbitePenguin,3,Tue Apr 21 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"I'd highly recommend chemistry or calculus since they're the two that cause the most difficulty for freshmen. In general, they're classes you don't want to take at Rutgers since its significantly more difficult here than it is in a community college.   Expository writing is another you can try to place out of for the same reasons but for a science major, it'd be even more helpful since it'd let you focus on more important classes."
rutgers,33ah16,LogicalThought,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"In that case I would try and take calculus, chemistry, and bio in community college, if they transfer over."

rutgers,33ah16,bobsbitchtitz,2,Tue Apr 21 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend taking any of the harder scinece classes at CC cause you'll learn how to study for the harder classes through them at Rutgers; however, take expos and other Gen Ed classes so you can take less credits when you get here per semester."
rutgers,33ah16,settingfires,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:03:37 2015 UTC,"Do not listen to the people ragging on expos if you have any talent at writing. It was a hard class but it really taught me to write great papers for college and you learn to write a lot more in shorter time periods.   If you're like me and have trouble with math, I HIGHLY suggest taking that at community. Especially if you're signed up for precalc. Precalc has a higher fail rate here than calc."

rutgers,33bf2y,KashMoney941,3,Tue Apr 21 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, yes, the F will stay on your transcript and this will negatively impact your chances of getting into any graduate programs. The F is factored into your GPA when you apply to outside institutions, so if you would have had a 4.0 with replacement, now you have a 3.7 or something. That bump down in your actual GPA could be enough to keep you out of a T14 school.   Have you tried asking the professor nicely and politely to throw you a bone?"
rutgers,33bf2y,TheIronGoat,2,Tue Apr 21 04:50:14 2015 UTC,"Yea I tried, he won't bite. Didnt even attempt to understand the situation. Not completely taking blame from myself, just saying"
rutgers,33bf2y,TheIronGoat,2,Tue Apr 21 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"If you're really set on law school, you're just going to have to take the hit to your GPA, as the F is calculated on your external transcripts. Just make sure you kill the rest of your classes and you may still be able to get into a good school, especially if you murder your LSATs and  this is your freshman year (F's in later courses tend to reflect much more negatively to admissions committees)."

I just finished a paid internship with ADP last Friday, I've been there for about a year and have so much working knowledge because of it. Some of my friends have had jobs lined up since the Fall Semester. CS will definitely look more prestigious and higher salary but ITI is no slouch either.

rutgers,33aq2w,GreyHatBrat,2,Tue Apr 21 12:20:17 2015 UTC,"CS requires lots of math and I personally find it difficult once you get past the basics. ITI is pretty easy and you can still get coding experience by taking database/webdesign/python.  Like others said, take some intro CS courses so you get a good foundation and if its something you see yourself doing then go for it. ITI is a little more on the human side then the technical side, which I was disappointed with, however I didn't get to take as many classes as I would have liked b/c of my work schedule. Check out the FB groups, people there are very helpful."
rutgers,33aq2w,MutatedSpleen,2,Tue Apr 21 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"CS is much harder, but likely comes with a much higher potential salary.  Job security is a problem (lots and lots and lots of freelance programmers), and job security is highly competitive (e.g., working for a major developer is cool, but absurdly competitive).  IT will be an easier field of study, but you'll have better job security (e.g., corporate network admin, etc), but you won't make the kind of money or have the kind of prestige someone in a CS job would have."

I was able to take General Chemistry (not the one for engineers, but this is also acceptable), Expos, Calc I (151), Intro to experimentation, and physics with no problems. In regards to the engineering classes, I would suggest going into SEBS because it offers Bioenvironmental Engineering, which if you temporarily declare allows you to take intro level engineering classes like Intro to computers for engineers and statics without special permission since it is still considered an engineering discipline. Also note that if you transfer from school to school the engineering orientation requirement will be waived, so you do not need to worry about that. In regards to grades, I got B's/B+'s in all my classes and had like a ~3.1 or 3.2 when I transferred in. Hope this helps and best of luck."

I think at the little window they have down there). Now, you should have gotten an email a while back telling you whether or not your hood has white trim or gold trim. Generally, any major that isn't science related means white trim, while any major that is science related is gold trim. If you're a double major, go by whatever major is your first.  And if you don't go to commencement/convocation, you obviously don't need to get a cap/gown. Diplomas are mailed out in June/July. Commencement/convocation is mainly just for recognition."

Each schools will have the same colors year after year so you don't have to worry about that. For example, engineering will always be orange. I can't pinpoint the changes between this years gown and last years gown, but I'm quite confident that the changes will be subtle if any.   I suggest contacting people who may have graduated.

You can get into medical school going to either one. I do not know much about NB but Camden was great to me. Camden honors college allows you to get smaller class sizes and individualized scheduling meetings with the honors college dean. This individual attention was great especially compared to NB where a main complaint is that you just become a number.   Another thing is NB will get a much larger volume of student into medical school because it is so larger but camden get a good number of student accepted as well.   I need to know more about you to help you out, meaning are you planning to live on campus. Camden was great because I commuted for 2 years and saved a ton of money.   Feel free to message me if you have more questions."
rutgers,3322ma,CyberKnightX,3,Sat Apr 18 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"RPI is honestly a very good school with much more opportunities after graduation. It depends on what you want. If you're a nerd (no offense but really, you need to be a nerd) you'd enjoy RPI. If you want any sort of social life you'd probably bet better off at Rutgers. But with that said. The RPI CS program is far better than Rutgers."

rutgers,3322ma,ostralyan,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:46:09 2015 UTC,"Career choices. There are certain companies that are near impossible to get at Rutgers or refuse to hire. Goldman Sachs is a prime example. Not saying you can't ever get one, it's just much harder."

rutgers,3322ma,ostralyan,2,Mon Apr 20 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's much harder. I mean Rutgers has 30k+ students of course you're going to have people work at GS or Google. But the opportunity is much harder to find. If you want better examples (not related to CS though) is that investment banking opportunities literally do not exist at Rutgers. I actually recently saw society generale recruit for an intern recently and I was really surprised. But there's always benefits of going to a tech college vs a public one and vice versa"
rutgers,3322ma,dlp211,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"Investment Banking opportunities don't generally exist outside of a handful of pre-selected schools (ie, Ivy's), and RPI isn't one of them.

That said, I know of one student that was actively recruited to do iBanking, but turned them down since they had no interest in it."

It's not a handful of ivy leagues and RPI actually is part of that list that as active recruiting for IB. And also, no student Rutgers or not gets actively pursued to do IB unless they have a connection in there.  There was a total of 5 undergrads at Rutgers that got into a front office position and out of those 5, 3 are in investment banking.  EDIT : ^ in the previous year"

I know a person that applied to a tech job at I believe Deutcshe Bank and their resume was forwarded to non-core recruiting for IB.

rutgers,3322ma,TehMulbnief,2,Mon Apr 20 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"The two schools are pretty different in scope.  RPI is an engineering school primarily so it if you want to do computer engineering, RPI is probably a better choice scholastically. If you want actual computer science, Rutgers has a pretty solid program, in fact.  Now, all that scholastic stuff aside, RPI is a nightmare. Whitewashed population, 70/30 dudes to chicks ratio, and it's in the middle of nowhere. Rutgers on the other hand is one of the most diverse universities in the country and is a train away from the best city in the world.  It's no contest in my mind.  Edit: I know quite a few CS majors who graduated with me. Handful went on the PhDs and a few other are in industry. No one is un- or underemployed."
rutgers,3322ma,dlp211,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the response man, really. However, I visited the campus today and I really liked it. I've been to the Rutgers campus too, and while I agree NYC is the greatest city on Earth, I've basically lived my life there. The ratio thing, living in the area, that ain't an issue for me, there's a lot of things to do on campus there, I was surprised to find. Plus, and I don't mean to downgrade RU in any way I know its a good program, but RPI's CS is nothing to scoff at either, balancing core theory and actual experience. The likes of Google, Facebook, and Apple also visit RPI for the careers fair, and IBM gave them a copy of Watson. Yes its primarily an engineering school, but that leads to a lot of research opportunities."

The world really isn't that hard, some people just have a constant worry that they'll be embarrassed. It stops many from taking steps and moving forward with life because they're afraid of what may happen. Calling the police here probably won't help anything at all either.

rutgers,32z8is,ruJS,2,Fri Apr 17 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"Trying to transfer into the Business School when you're in another school at Rutgers is not easy. The Business School is quite competitive, so if your GPA isn't high, you run the risk of not being accepted. Once you're in, the classes aren't too difficult, depending on what your major is and how knowledgeable you are in whatever field you decide to study. With that being said, RBS has a great curriculum and some amazing professors, so I would say it's worth a shot. The opportunities that the Business School grants to its students are amazing and the people at Career Management do everything they can to place everyone once they graduate."
rutgers,32z8is,TrueFox,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:11:27 2015 UTC,"I am a student in RBS-NB. I might have a bias towards RBS but I believe we are offered more opportunities than SEBS in terms of direct, relevant job placement. Also, your peers will be much more like-minded and professors will be experienced in your field of choosing (finance, accounting, etc.) SAS is also good if you don't get in to RBS, do Econ/Math or Econ/PoliSci and you should have the same opportunities as an RBS major.  Edit: PM me for more info."
rutgers,32z8is,sentfrommobile,0,Sat Apr 18 02:09:53 2015 UTC,"I'd say do it. When I was a sophomore (I'm a senior now) two of my roommates transferred into RBS from SAS and they both had a gpa between 3.0-3.4 so it's definitely not impossible as some say. Once you're in RBS has some good professors and some incredibly shitty PTL (part time lecturers) that are there because they get paid a ton less than actual faculty. You'll hate plenty of classes and wonder what these classes have to do with the real world, but you'll have great networking opportunities, and plenty of companies (fortune 500) recruit from Rutgers, so your job prospects are fine. You will probably need to do a bit of ""fake it til you make it"" but RBS is truly what you get out is what you put in to it. If you just go to class and expect jobs to fall into your lap, they wont. If you hustle, network on LinkedIn with alum, go to recruiting events and get involved, your GPA will mean less and you'll have no problem with employment.  Do note though that in my personal experience I didn't learn much in the way of ""hard skills"" at RBS. So in my internships I wasn't really able to go ""OMG I spent a semester learning just this!"" If you're a student that really needs to know they're learning hard skills that will be directly applicable to their job, RBS probably isn't the place for you, unless you're an accounting major. Again, just my personal experience."

But if you want minimal work, I took Scenic Art last semester (You can only take it during the Fall and Scenic Art II during the Spring) and it was literally no work, but you had a midterm and a final. The midterm was all about the history of theater scenery and stuff and the second half was more about the physical components used now.   I got an A, showed up to every class but one (was really sick) and got an A on both the midterm and final. They require some studying, but it's not rigorous. David Gordon is also really good at keeping your attention because he's not boring. There's no robotic, monotone voice, he does theater design for a living (in November he went to Florida for a week to finish up work on I think an opera he had worked on before and they were bring it back). You have to show up to class (it's Mason Gross rules for attendance) or else you will fail. Take notes, or don't, but I suggest you do something so you can study later. There are 3 ""field trips"" where you go to see first the theaters on campus, second the shop where everything is made for the shows, and third the place where they do stuff with lights! If you have any interest in theater, it's a good class to take. I found myself actually using some of what I learned, but only just a little.  edit: I did not do Scenic Art II. There is no way I could've handled that with my classes I have. Someone I know told me they worked on the final project for two weeks straight at the end and there is no way I could do that right now. I may take it my last semester if I have a spot to fill and can handle the long project. The project is building a white model for a set design I think, and those are definitely not like the art projects you did in elementary school!"

I can tell you that Discrete I and Math 300 is almost exactly the same, and taking both of them at the same time would actually be easy. I took CS211, Math300, 250, Calc3 along with another class last semester. I was unable to register for any other CS classes so I decided to take 205 despite having the prerequisite from 300 and it has been an absolute breeze because the material is almost identical.  Linear Algebra is fairly easy in that it is a lot of formula application. There is usually a clear cut way to solve a question, so it is not like calculus were you could get stuck at solving a problem. If you invest a few hours each week, it should be enough to understand the problem easily.  Computer Architecture is hard to tell because it's one of those computer science courses where it's alright as long as you understand the concept once. It's however difficult to gage how long you'll take to understand topics. Never really felt too necessary to study for exams in this class, but a bit of time doing assignments (although completely enough time if you don't procrastinate)  A lot of the things I've said might be teacher dependent, but taking 205 and 300 at the same time definitely is just like having one class."

I'm happy to be off for five days, allowing me to work finally (my schedules have sucked for finding jobs these two semesters).   I'm mostly taking the math 300 because I would like to take some of the higher math classes that require it. Cryptography sounds really cool to me and I'm sure these math classes couldn't hurt!"
rutgers,32rfwt,chymx,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:01:06 2015 UTC,"If it fits your schedule, I strongly recommend you try take the honors section of 300 which is nearly always taught by Professor Komlos.

It's really up to you.  As long as you budget your time properly and efficiently you shouldn't have too much trouble with this course load.  250 is a very straight forward class.  Solving the problems is pretty algorithmic, although depending on the professor you might encounter a fair amount of conceptual questions.  300 gets somewhat of a bad reputation because its usually the first class in which you encounter actual ""rigorous"" proof writing.  Don't let the word ""proof"" scare you.  They start you off slow and up your confidence. But yeah, this is totally doable.    I would also highly recommend turning that math minor into a major.  There is quite a bit of cross over in course requirements for the two majors. I'm pretty sure 300, graph theory, cryptography, combinatorics, linear optimization, math logic, discrete and probabilistic in bio, mathematical models in the social sciences, stochastic models in operations research, and theory of linear optimization, and probability can replace discrete II.

rutgers,32r6hr,AnaPins,2,Thu Apr 16 02:09:57 2015 UTC,I ALMOST has the same issue. Most law schools only take students in the fall and I almost settled for a school that would take me in the spring. I'm glad I didn't. I used my time to make some money and take a break from school.
rutgers,32r6hr,AnaPins,2,Thu Apr 16 02:30:42 2015 UTC,"I am glad it worked out for you. I am just afraid that if I don't get in I would have wasted a semester. I know the business school is hard to get esp. for accounting, so I just wanted some feedback if the school was worth it."
rutgers,32r6hr,redditname123,2,Thu Apr 16 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"yeah, it really depends on where you want to go to school and why. Rutgers, at the very least, has name recognition across the country and alumni everywhere which helps with employment"

rutgers,32r6hr,URETHRAL_DIARRHEA,3,Thu Apr 16 17:32:31 2015 UTC,Yeah i had a 3.6 first semester and But I think I will be slightly below 3.5 this semester so I hope it will average out
rutgers,32r6hr,budna,2,Thu Apr 16 18:15:36 2015 UTC,Good stuff and as a heads up. If you're doing Accounting it would still make sense to take more classes past your associates degree even if you haven't started at Rutgers. I'm assuming you're looking to get your CPA and to get your CPA you'll need 150 credits. So regardless you'll still have things to do in between your degree and starting at RBS. Good luck with everything!
rutgers,32r6hr,budna,3,Thu Apr 16 23:05:05 2015 UTC,Thank you! And yeah i didn't even think of the extra credits I will need to get my CPA.
rutgers,32qo8n,Off_Topic_Oswald,4,Wed Apr 15 22:59:52 2015 UTC,"Summer math courses are supposed to cover exactly the same content as their fall/spring counterparts, and for the most part, this actually happens.  The biggest difference is that you're taking a more compressed course (eight weeks instead of around 15 weeks for the semester), so you need to stay on top of your game. You'll have exams every two to three weeks, unlike the month-plus you usually get.  That being said, if you're willing to put the study time in, you can get a great experience over the summer. Some people really benefit from the small class sizes (in general, the instructors will be quite helpful) and the opportunity to fully focus on one subject."
rutgers,32qo8n,kovxuhjnps,3,Thu Apr 16 00:21:15 2015 UTC,"Summer math classes are more challenging because you have less time to process material between lectures. These courses move very fast. However, if you did well in calc 1 and you can devote a lot of time to homework, then you can do well.   You cannot receive credit for both 152 and 136. 152 is a prerequisite for many other courses, it covers more material, and its discussion sections are workshop based (not problem solving sessions with a TA)."
rutgers,32qo8n,pureatheisttroll,2,Thu Apr 16 12:49:56 2015 UTC,"I've always found summer classes to be slightly easier and more convenient than classes during the regular semester. Hear me out. During the semester you're taking multiple classes, studying for multiple exams, and completing multiple assignments. Taking this class over the summer you will likely meet 4-5 times. I see this as a benefit compared to the semester. It doesn't give you time to forget material that you went over last lecture. You don't have to do any more work for a summer class in comparison to a fall/spring class.  It's the same amount of work squeezed into a shorter amount of time. And let's be honest, even during the regular semester we've all been in the position of starting to study for an exam only a few days in advanced, so this should be nothing new.  I've definitely had the best learning experiences with summer classes. You often have a better more personal relationship with your professor since they are likely only teaching one section as opposed to multiple during a regular semester. The tutoring centers are also not quite as as packed over the summer. Also a lot of the time grad or phd students will teach summer courses, and they often have a much easier time relating to students, and explain the concepts quite well in a simplified manner. This isn't always the case, but I've never had a bad experience with a grad/phd at this school.  100% take it over the summer. Not sure who is teaching it, but if you find out, then I'm sure we could recommend whether or not to take it with said instructor."
rutgers,32qo8n,LogicalThought,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think you get credit for taking both Calc 2 classes. If you need them to move forward, Calc 152 is usually the prerequisite for most classes so I'd take that one (its generally tougher).  If taking it in the summer is an option for you, I would do that. It lets you focus on just one class at a time, over a shorter period so you forget less things. I wasn't a fan of Calc classes and it definitely made it easier in my opinion."

I don't understand where this whole stigma comes from especially since it's completely confidential unless you're gunna hurt someone.    They do an initial phone interview to see what kind of services you require a psychiatrist or psychologist. In your case they'll most likely make you go upstairs to see the resident phd psychologists (therapists). There is no limit on the # of times you can go.  You can either choose to take the advice (ex. Talk to your parents) the psych gives you or not. It's your choice. The only time they can force you to talk to your parents is if you're under 18.

They never made me talk to anyone else, and the phone interview was to determine what type of treatment you'd be getting from them."
rutgers,32noza,1piperpiping,0,Thu Apr 16 14:41:48 2015 UTC,"Edit:  This is from my own personal experience.  I am a graduate student, and this may look somewhat different for undergrads.  Step 1 - Call and schedule a phone interview.    Step 2 - Phone interview.  Takes about 10-15 minutes, and they just go over basic mental health stuff, what you want to be seen for, if you're currently suicidal, if you're on medication, substance abuse, etc.    Step 3 - First appointment.  You go to the building and fill out a bunch of paperwork, and see the person you have an appointment to see.  The first meeting is ALWAYS with a basic counselor.  This might be a psychologist, and it might be a social worker.  You can ask about your counselor's specific qualifications if you are interested.  This is an hour long session where they go over your medical and mental health history, family history, etc, in a lot of detail, and talk about why you are being seen.  This appointment typically has the counselor give you all the options you have available to you, which usually include a number of one-on-one sessions, group therapy, etc.  Note:  You MUST have this initial appointment before you can see a psychiatrist (I think this is to weed out folks who are just trying to get psych meds to abuse and to make sure you actually want to see a psychiatrist legitimately, but don't quote me on that)  Step 4+ - This is where it starts to vary from person to person.  You will schedule appointments and such for whatever it is you personally need.  If you want to see a psychiatrist because you think medication might help, this is when that happens (note: psychiatrists at CAPS generally require you to have a physical health screening to rule out physical issues such as thyroid problems, and often require you to attend group or individual therapy as a part of your treatment plan before they will medicate).  You might be referred to GSAPP (graduate school of applied and professional psychology) for some things, or for continuing treatment."
rutgers,32n7sh,lostinthecrowdd,9,Wed Apr 15 03:23:04 2015 UTC,Don't feel bad about being alone! I personally think doing things alone is undervalued - and that it's totally fine to not have someone at your side at all times - but if you really want to make friends definitely participate in different organizations. Go to their general interest meetings or run for a leadership position - things will absolutely take off from there. You need to take risks if you want to get to know people!

If you just kind of keep to yourself people are going to leave you alone. To make friends you have to put yourself out there.

rutgers,32irh3,kristjkm,2,Tue Apr 14 09:13:47 2015 UTC,Find a club that interests you and where the members are welcoming and friendly. Clearly the one club isn't doing it for you
rutgers,32irh3,lrrlrr,2,Tue Apr 14 12:09:18 2015 UTC,"Do you live on campus? This can happen to commuters. Since it sounds like you're pretty free evenings and weekends (no offense), try out some new clubs. Intramural sports are cool. Consider rushing fraternities or sororities (rush = open, non-committal events for potential new members, make sure to check out a bunch of different houses). If you want to make small talk in the classroom setting, you'll probably have luck focusing it around class and school. As far as outside, maybe go to club meetings and ask if anyone wants to grab food after. Consider going to the gym (if you don't already); I know people who came in to RU with terrible social anxiety and it helped them with their confidence. And you could probably find a workout buddy to go with. Hope this helps"
rutgers,32irh3,paperjoy,2,Tue Apr 14 05:39:07 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems like there are other people who are in or are in a similar place in your position. I don't know if you would try a meet-up at one of the student centers and just chatting for a bit and see how things go. I understand that joining a club or multiple clubs will not always help you connect with people because many times those in the club already have their own circle of friends.  I personally have only a few close friends and that was a result of friends connecting me with their friends. That's what worked for me."

rutgers,32iowi,kevkev667,2,Tue Apr 14 03:03:36 2015 UTC,Yeah and the majority of CS111 Intro to CS is mainly teaching about programming in general so it's not like it's required to study Java-specifics before taking the course.

I also want to make you aware that CS111 is really the only CS course you can take first. After completing CS111, you can only take CS112. After that, there are a few more options, but still very limited. Recap: 1 CS class per semester for your first year.  Also, don't listen to others and don't underestimate CS111, or any other CS course. It's certainly a breeze if you know the material, as many people do. I have seen many motivated students struggle.  (Technically, you could take cs110, but that is really not Comp Sci, and doesn't count towards other Comp Sci course prereqs)"

I was finishing up my first midterm round 2 and I took a look around the class. What I saw was Minsky with is head buried in a newspaper and literally everyone else in the class on their phones looking up answers. I was the only kid who wasn't cheating. So this is a class where you NEED to cheat to get ahead.

That being said, Davidson isn't that awful. It is true there isn't any AC. Just get a good fan and open your windows to circulate the air and it feels just fine when it gets warm outside. We did have heat and hot water problems during the winter (no hot water, rooms < 50° at night), which have been resolved. Hopefully residents next year don't have those problems anymore. The Davidson community is generally pretty cool and everyone seems to be friends. Its a really great place to live and meet new people during your first year at school. Its not the nicest and most glamorous place to live, but it certainly isn't awful. If you have any more questions about housing, or more specifically Davidson you can PM me."

When I was in Davidson, there was no kitchen available to the residents. Just a laundry room sink and the mini-fridge & microwave in the room.  It's definitely unfair that Davidson costs the same as other dorms considering the condition it's in. I believe the rooms are also much smaller than other dorms at Rutgers."

One of the girls lives in Ireland. He still doesn't care; his solution is for her to do the presentation on this week, 3 weeks before it's due for everyone else, while she is in the states for vacation.  At this point I'm nervous if going to my adviser or dean would result in my failing his class, despite having done quite well up to this point.

I was more curious as to what the schools actual regulations regarding online (non-hybrid) sections are with shit like this and felt bad for some of the other students who won't be able to get in to make the presentations, honestly fuck that guy; who tells a student who lives in another fucking continent that they have to come to the in class section for a fucking 15 minute presentation."

I've never heard of anything even remotely close to what you're describing and if there's a department or professor that's using an online class to somehow skirt registration issues for a general lecture (trying to fit more people) that is honestly one of the most ridiculous things I've heard. Hybrid classes though? That's a whole different story.  As others have said, the syllabus is how you'll figure this out. If you're registered for a 100% online course and he's holding you to a a syllabus for a lecture or decided at some point after the class started to change it to a hybrid? I don't even have the words."
rutgers,32fizb,expertprogr4mmer,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:48:47 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% positive of it not being a hybrid class. Syllabus actually states that everything including project is done online. It wasn't until this passed lecture that he quizzically asked why no one from section 90 was coming to lecture and if we wanted to fail. That's what prompted me to ask him about the submission of the final presentation.  To say that this class was run like a clusterfuck would be an understatement. We had a midterm presentation, he decided to let the online section know it was no longer mandatory to submit it, 3 days after it was due. He apparently sent an email to the in class section weeks earlier.  Also, I don't see why everyone is holding the syllabus to such a high standard. From my experience with Deans in BME, they don't give a shit what the syllabus says."
rutgers,32fizb,MutatedSpleen,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:45:21 2015 UTC,"Because the syllabus (for lack for lack of a better word) is a contract. As as student it should clearly indicate what you're responsible for completing and generally how you'll be evaluated (exams, papers, presentations, etc...). If you're in an online class and the syllabus indicates you're supposed to be attending lecture, that's not an online course and it should be stated and shared during registration.   I can't speak to what BME is doing but I also can't get my mind around having a 100% online class and somehow then making requirements that those students attend a lecture. It really sounds like someone in the department wants to get credit or acknowledgement for having an online course as part of the program but doesn't actually want to run a separate online class. I wish I had some specific advice for you here but it does indeed sound like a complete and total cluster."
rutgers,32fizb,08230911,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:14:51 2015 UTC,"I had that same idea, but I learned last year that's not exactly the case. Professor had posted breakdown of her grading scheme. Too many kids got over 90's so A got moved from 90-100 to 95-100; my 94 was now a B+. Dean of engineering pretty much said changing the syllabus/grading/anything is really up to the teachers discretion."

B/c you completed major requirements you can take 8 credits as pass/fail. (1 class per semester) http://sasundergrad.rutgers.edu/forms/pass-no-credit . This should lighten the load..

Every semester I consistently checked the website with requirements, laid out exactly what I needed to take when, how many credits I'd need to to take every semester, etc. Your adviser probably told you what courses you need to take to meet the requirements, but you still need 120 credits to graduate. I don't think your adviser is totally at fault, but anyway...  You will be run down, but 18 credits is doable. Most of my semesters I took 18+ credits, once I took 22 credits. It was definitely tiring and stressful. Art classes, if you can take them, are 4 credits each. They're long, but can be kind of meditative in a weird way. Online media classes were really helpful for me because they were pretty easy and I do things online at my own pace."

I'm not mad about it, just want to make sure I can grad on time. Was being told they accepted 18 credits more, but they hadn't."
rutgers,32go75,theusernameicreated,2,Mon Apr 13 22:28:02 2015 UTC,"Okay. That makes more sense. Did they formally accept the transfer in writing? Then you have a case against them. If it was verbal, which actually happened to me, you could still fight it again and ask for a reevaluation."

rutgers,32e8d0,sparta1170,2,Mon Apr 13 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"Just transferred in this past Fall myself.  STAR Day is your day to register. They start in June at the earliest and they have a few through the summer. You also need to attend a one day orientation, but it doesn't matter the order (I did orientation and then STAR Day and my friend did the opposite).   At STAR Day you learn about how Rutgers Majors and Minors work. If you're a certain major, you don't need a minor but if not, you must have a minor (or two majors). As a Computer a Science Major, I don't need a minor but I may end up doing Math.  You will also learn about the websites you need to pick your classes:  -WebReg, the website where you will actually register for classes. This site also has a schedule of classes so you can find the right classes and open sections that fit your schedule (there's also a separate schedule of classes app you can use but you need to be able to login via your netID)  -Degree Navigator, this will let you see what you have completed thus far or are working on for your major. You can see every major and minor offered by all 3 campuses (always be careful to look at NB) and what is required. They're kind of difficult to understand at first, but you'll get it eventually. After you're credits have been transferred in, you can actually see what you have towards your major. Also, if you graduated from a New Jersey Community College with an A.S or an A.A, you may actually be able to skip all of the core curriculum at Rutgers and only need to do your major/minor courses, otherwise depending on what transfers in, you have to take certain requirements on campus even if what transfers in counts.  Something they will probably but also may not tell you, there's a site called Course Schedule Planner where you can enter your classes and it puts together all possible schedules with those courses. There are hundreds of possibilities so it really helps a lot. You can put in that you want off on Fridays or only morning and afternoon classes. It's a great tool and will also not put together a schedule that isn't allowed.   As for financial aid, if you applied before February, you are up for scholarships through Rutgers depending on your performance at your previous school. I, for example got a Phi Theta Kappa scholarship which is $8,000 a year for 2 years. There's another one that's less and you just have to have a good GPA at your other school.  For housing, don't be alarmed if you're put on the waiting list in August. I was put on it and only two days later was assigned the Livingston Apartments."

You do get to select your own classes, at an event in August (I think) called STAR days. However I believe these are after basically everyone else has registered, so it's pretty slim pickings in terms of what is available. You will be contacted about STAR days, and that's where you'll register the first time. After that you'll use a web-based tool called webreg.  I have no idea."

I'm in my freshman year now in SOE and I feel like I missed out on a lot of experiences by not setting a schedule and allowing myself free time for other things besides engineering. I mean first and foremost you are here for an education but not allowing yourself to relax and have fun every once and a while takes a toll on your overall performance.  Sleep is also a huge thing. Getting enough rest is essential to beginning your day. Even if you have all night classes, which reminds me, don't try to be someone who you are not in terms of classes. I am not an early riser but expected that I would be able to go to 8:40 AM classes and it's terrible. Choose classes that fit into a schedule that you are comfortable with.   Also, there should be a Class of 2019 SOE Facebook page set up by now or soon. The one for 2018 is really helpful. Students from higher grades will post very helpful things about classes and schedules and stuff like that.   On a last note, and this may not seem super important, but don't be afraid to take more than 4 years. Rutgers is one of the few schools that gives you an Engineering degree in 4 years. All of the other schools I visited had 5 and 6 year tracks. So if you don't think you can handle taking a bunch of classes then you don't have to. As long as you fit them all in someway you can take as much time as you want. I wish someone had told me this because my first semester I maxed out the possible credits you could take so that I could be on track for SOE, I also took two humanities on top of the required engineering classes. I do not recommended.   If you have any more specific questions you can message me and I'll try to answer as best as I can :)"

I see its name thrown around a lot as ""that one class"", but I don't really get it.  I do know writing is one of the very most important skills you can pick up in high school or college in the sense that, like...you can get jobs based solely on your writing skill and nothing more.  Is there some particular reason this class is bad, or is it just a really serious writing class where you have to take it seriously?"
rutgers,32doms,MutatedSpleen,3,Mon Apr 13 03:18:20 2015 UTC,"It's literally just an expository writing class. There are five essays that have to write on your own, and two essays in class for the midterm and final. You have a required book, that contains a variety of different passages from novels, peer reviewed journals, and research papers.   The professor assigns either two or three readings from the book at the beginning of the week. For the next few class periods you have discussions with your classmates on how to connect the texts. It really helps if you participate in these discussions, or at least stay alert. I found that when I zoned out during a discussion, it was much harder to write the paper after.  Depending on which paper it is, you will either write one or two drafts before submitting a final copy that gets graded. During the draft process you can get as much, or as little, feedback from your professor and your peers as you wish.   The reason people tend to complain about expos is that the assigned readings can often seem very dense and unappealing. I know I struggled more when writing about something I didn't care about. The class is also taught by a huge number of professors, but has the same syllabus and grading rubric no matter what. Therefore, if you have a bad professor, who isn't there to help you out as much as the syllabus assumes he/she will be, you are unfairly disadvantaged.   Overall the class isn't a nightmare if you establish a good relationship with your professor, pay attention to discussions, and start papers in a timely fashion. To me, it was more tedious than anything."

I don't know if that's realistic in the SoE, but if it is do that. You will need to learn to be self motivated. I'm actually finishing up my second round of college at age 35. The first time I went to Boston College when I was 18 and flunked out becuase I was not at all prepared to manage my own workload. I fell behind, started missing assignments, failing exams, and got into a pretty vicious cycle. You have to learn to stay on top of your classes, assignments, readings, etc.  Do the reading. By and large you can get through school without it. But if you do the assigned reading you will have a big leg up when it comes to lectures.  Live a little. I think the whole ""college experience"" is oversold; but it is a thing and you should enjoy it. Just make sure you have the proper work/life balance."

Other than that, have fun, it'll go by quick and afterwards you'll have to be an adult for the rest of your life."

It will only look better on a resume in jobs that are related to it. You could argue that the disadvantages are that you take three fewer classes that are related to what you might do but its not really a huge deal. might be harder for you but that depends on you.

More people are going to college, devaluing degrees meaning more people need to spend more time in college getting graduate degrees. Lets of jobs that use to not require a degree now do.

The social aspect of college is one of the reasons I chose to attend instead of simply apprenticing under someone in IT or learning a skilled trade at 18. I'd say 98% of students who chose not to attend community college for the first two years of their bachelor's have factored in the social aspect, with the other 2% having their education completely paid for.   worthless degrees   Such as? I don't know if we should be saying that someone's interest is worthless. For instance, I know that majoring in philosophy isn't the biggest bang for my buck, but that doesn't matter to me because my decision is informed by other insights -- learning, the necessity of a bachelor's for work or travel, networking.

I'm a senior in ECE (electrical though, not computer) and took >18 credits many semesters. It's definitely do-able, but you have to make sure you learn the basics very solidly.  If you want to do computer engineering, get a head start by learning C++ or Matlab over the summer and maybe take a summer course (principles of EE?). Also, brush up on your math because you need calc through differential equations and linear systems.  It's going to be hard, but be sure not to overwork yourself and burn out a couple years into the program."

Correct me if im wrong, but I feel after you fight through the prereq classes, you start to get into those classes that enable you to learn in that way. I've always enjoyed math too (even though that could change after taking Multivariable Calc and so on).  Basically, I want a major that not just challenges and pushes me, but enables me to learn through getting your hands dirty and teaches you real world skills, while also prepping you for that real world of work.  Hopefully that answers your question."

Time management is key and living somewhere conducive to that will help.   also, if there's anyway you can arrange so you don't need a part time job or can work minimally during the year (by saving a lot during the summer, maybe?) that's helpful too   last peace of advice? try and get fit over the summer if you aren't. working out occasionally will help you stay out of a mid semester slump and overall health = stronger brain, not just a stronger body!   good luck man, it sounds like you have the right motivation to switch and I think you'll be fine!"

rutgers,325xnb,spotapp,22,Sat Apr 11 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"I actually did my undergrad at Purdue, and am in grad school at Rutgers.  Purdue has one of the best engineering programs in the country.  They are top notch, absolutely wonderful.  But it's in the middle of Indiana.  It's waaaaaaay different in the middle of Indiana than it is here in NJ.  Purdue and Rutgers are similarly sized student bodies, but the campuses are way different.  Purdue is one huge campus all bunched together like it's own city.  No matter where you are on campus, if you're in residential housing, you can walk to classes, no need to rely on buses or cars or anything of that nature.  Rutgers, on the other hand, is 4-5 smaller campuses that you basically need to bus between.  If you live on Busch but have classes on College Ave, get used to riding the bus.  If political affiliation is important to you, Purdue might be rough.  It's a liberal bastion in a sea of Indiana republicans.  In the 2008 election, Purdue, IU, and Indianapolis were the only three counties in the whole state that voted blue.  And they did so with such force that the whole state ended up blue that year.  But still, you'll be there with mostly kids from Indiana, and there is a very strong conservative feel there.  Rutgers, on the other hand, is one of the most openly liberal places I've ever been in my life.  Neither school is a significant entity in sports.  Really, the biggest difference, I think, is what you want to do when you're not learning.  Purdue is extremely isolated.  You're about an hour and a half by car away from Indianapolis, about 2.5-3 hours from Chicago, and outside of Purdue-centric stuff, there isn't shit for miles.  Lafayette (across the river from Purdue/West Lafayette) has many of the bars and eating establishments, but it's not a huge city.  Rutgers is a short train ride from both Philadelphia and New York.  It's really just about what you want.  What are you looking for in a school?  Is it purely the prestige of the degree, or are you interested in locale, people, opportunities, etc?"
rutgers,325xnb,MutatedSpleen,6,Fri Apr 10 22:05:41 2015 UTC,This is the best advice in this thread (even better than mine). I went to RU for undergrad and am currently in grad school.

rutgers,325xnb,URETHRAL_DIARRHEA,6,Sat Apr 11 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"Well, Purdue is also Big Ten.  Both teams suck at football, and while every school has a big football following among people at or around that school, neither has a serious national presence in the college football scene."

I'm not too involved or concerned with diversity or student body size, as I tend to make friends quickly, but in your opinion is it really that much boring at Purdue than it is at Rutgers?

I'm a Rutgers freshman right now, but last year when I was a highschool senior I really didn't want to go to Rutgers because I didn't want to constantly see people from my school everywhere. About 31 other students from my year came here with me, and I've only seen 4 wandering about on campus. I actually see more alumni. Trust me, you really won't see your peers a lot.  Another reason everyone instate says Rutgers isn't very good is because a lot of people from their school go here. So, it makes it seem easy to get into. However, Rutgers has separate schools inside each campus; the New Brunswick campus has the School of Pharmacy (which you need a high-ass GPA to get into), Rutgers Business School (3.1 or above to stay in it), pre-med, Engineering, etc. Most of the people with low GPAs go into SEBS apparently (but SEBS is still a wonderful school).   This is starting to sound like an essay, but last thing: Purdue is a good school, but I don't think any school can compare to the diversity of Rutgers. There's a shit ton to do, plus you can ride the train round trip to NY for ~$30 and go to concerts, museum exhibits, shopping, whatever the fuck you want. But you don't even have to, because every night something's going on; clubs usually have events on Wednesdays or Thursdays, and if you want to go to parties just grab a crew and head down to College Ave. There are a lot of different views and opinions here, so you're sure to find people with very similar interests.   College is a new part of your life, bruh. Make new friends and shit. I think Rutgers will aid you a lot with expanding your views and social network.  PM me if you need more advice! I gotchu 👌"

I have friends who have gone on to top graduate schools, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, etc. I have other friends who went to Purdue and came back to New Jersey because it was just too hard to justify the extra money for the benefits.  Realistically speaking, the main thing about engineering is how much effort you put into it. You can get amazing internships or co-ops at both schools, research positions, and networking. Rutgers is no slouch. I personally had a seven month co-op at a national lab that I wouldn't have been able to get at any other school, and am on a publication.  If you believe that Purdue will end up being a better option, then by all means, go and blaze a trail. You might find that your opinions change after a few years. I know mine did.

If money isn't an issue, stop listening to these other guys saying ""middle of nowhere Indiana"".  The whole damn world comes to recruit out of Purdue for engineering.  #1 agriculture program in the world.  Tier 1 engineering school.  Every year, companies come to an event (aside from a sh**-ton of other events) called the Industrial Round-table, and its like a job fair on steroids.  Programs like EPICS really set the two Engineering schools apart.  Have you visited?  I'm not going to find the specifics, but I've seen the lists for Purdue Engineering partners and recruiting companies, as well as the same from Rutgers.  Rutgers may be near ""the city"", but Purdue definitely has a longer, better and more prestigious list. https://careerfair.purdueesc.org/  Just as /u/MutatedSpleen would say PU is ""isolated"", I would accuse Rutgers of the same.

Indiana is just different physical location.  All of my classmates interned all over the U.S., and some even outside the country.  If you're open to new experiences, I highly encourage going out to Purdue.    I myself have fallen in love with Indiana and I'm a geeky Asian out of Newark.  I have never met someone who hasn't heard of Purdue.  I have met tons of people who don't know Rutgers.  Both are the type to flatter themselves saying ""people ask if we're Ivy all the time"".

Its decently pretty (although IU (may it forever suck in peace), overshadows PU in beauty).    Rutgers is a very good school.  Purdue (in engineering) is a TOP school. Its called the ""Cradle of Astronauts"".  Its a Land-Grant, Sea-grant and a f***ing Space-grant school.  You have 2 very decent choices but know that you are comparing two completely different tiers of education.  TL;DR: Go to Purdue.  Don't even compare the two schools.

My point is though, that its a thing with Rutgers students to jerk over proximity to the city, when that is really a crappy point to make to help a prospective student make a decision.  Of course I don't mean to down-play it unfairly.  If you're the type of person to be starry-eyed about NYC (which many people are), of course there is no place like NYC.

I believe an extreme form of this concept is called ""conceited"".  As for the commute to Chicago: Yeah it is 6 hours.  But you'd be exaggerating if it was really a 2 hour total commute from RU.

I'm not trying to say Rutgers sucks in any way.  I'm just trying to show these other RU students and OP that these ""trump card"" NYC/Philly/AC w.e points make:    Assumptions that OP's lifestyle and interests align with the specialties of these places.  Assumptions that Purdue cannot offer similar and unique experiences that Rutgers would not.  Anywhere else but the NJ metro is rural bumf***.   Which ultimately destroys the argument that Rutgers students are ""so liberal"" and ""worldly"".  It really highlights that RU students can be just as isolated and closed minded.  Nobody asked OP what he was into (which I did in a private message pending response).  How many of you guys/gals have actually been to Purdue?

Sorry if I came into your home and said Rutgers isn't amazing.  Its a great school really.  But for engineering, there really is no way you can compare these schools.  That statement shows you haven't looked into the rankings or the programs at all.  So you're trying to undermine my advice to OP but     You don't even know the rankings.  You've never been to Purdue.   I'm trying to give OP honest and unbiased advice.  He posted in /r/rutgers, and I saw the ridiculous amount of ""Come here because NYC oppertunities"", and I decided to calibrate my response to show OP the opposite side of that.  I didn't mean to say that you made any comparisons.  And my points are not pulled out of thin air.  They're a reflection of the comments I've seen all around this thread about why Purdue is rural Indiana and that sucks and NYC rocks.  So far we've established that Rutgers (despite its close proximity to NYC) has worse ENGINEERING opportunities (heh).  And so we're down to arguing about ""playground"" and social aspects.  Which should really boil down to OP's hobbies personal decisions.  What qualifications do you have to even respond to OP's situation, and thus, actually claim that your advice is an unbiased source?  I totally agree with your point about school environments.  And that's what I'm also trying to say.  They're completely different.  But to assert that Purdue doesn't have a unique offering for OP proves my point.  And if you don't like that, I'm okay with it.

rutgers,3253ta,dsatrbs,2,Sat Apr 11 13:22:30 2015 UTC,"The software gives each student a rating based on things like facial recognition, eye movement, and it also tracks audio using a microphone. The teacher gets a list of every student along with their rating (students are either listed as having high integrity or low integrity) and the teacher can view the recorded footage to confirm if a student was cheating or not.  I wouldn't mind the software if it was free or included in the cost of an online class, and if the software itself wasn't shit. I wish Proctortrack would release their statistics related to the software because I would be very surprised if there weren't a large number of false positives, especially considering most people are using laptops with shitty webcams and microphones.  I've taken 3 exams using the software so far, in the first exam the software's UI (which is forced onto the screen) blocked several questions from being read and crashed halfway through the exam, so I'm guessing I got flagged for cheating since when you restart the software it tells you that you have to be done with the exam before closing the software otherwise there could be consequences.  The second exam I took involved an updated version of the software and they fixed the dumbass UI, it didn't crash either so it was actually a solid experience.  The third exam I took which was yesterday was another shitty experience. The software worked fine and then halfway through the exam it said it couldn't detect my microphone which is bullshit since it was working fine in Windows, so again, I'm pretty sure I got flagged as a cheater.  I think Proctortrack could be a good solution down the road when the software becomes less of a piece of shit, but at the moment it is completely pointless because the teacher has to spend their time watching hours worth of false positive footage simply because the software doesn't work as intended.   I'm also skeptical of how this software will evolve down the road because unless the devs can somehow get perfect facial recognition with students' shitty webcams, they won't be able to fix false flagging of students. If that doesn't get fixed, then professors will have to spend many hours watching pointless videos (exams are usually an hour long at the minimum for many online classes). Also, many of my professors have been lazy asses since I started at Rutgers, so I'm sure they don't care about watching the footage anyway."

rutgers,322lqc,seungq,5,Fri Apr 10 01:56:01 2015 UTC,"Graduated Exercise Science student here. Just finished my degree in December. There isn't much to say about the major honestly but I'll list some important points. I'm going to explain more of the Applied Kinesiology aspects because that was my option. There is also an Exercise Physiology option as well as a Sport Management option within the major.  I don't know what year you're in but in order to even declare the major, you have to finish Bio I and II and 2 statistics courses (unless you get into Quantitative Methods in Psychology; the class counts as 2 stat courses). Get those done as soon as possible. You will need a C or better in all of them to get in.   Once you get in, you will realize that there is a lot, A LOT, of students in the major. Most will agree that there are too many students for the amount of staff. Classes will fill up instantly. If you're not on top of registration, you will be very unhappy. And even if you click register right at 10pm, there is a good chance you won't get a class you need. It would help to have 1 if not several back-up plans for when this happens. Know what classes you can take and if they'll help towards completion of the major just in case you need them.  Use Degree Navigator or go to the Ex. Sci. office (Loree Building on Douglass) and ask for a degree requirements sheet. It lists all of the classes you will need to take to complete the major. Try to get a meeting with an advisor, some have walk-in times, and sit and try to organize a plan. The major has many hard science classes: bio, chem, anatomy, physiology, physics etc. among many other elective and hybrid courses as well as an internship. It would be in your best interest to try and spread the work around the coming semesters.  As more of a side note, it is a credit-intensive major so you won't need to declare a minor. You can if you want; I declared a psych minor just because I could but it doesn't really mean anything. Just something to remember.  And finally, not really regarding the major but as someone that has graduated and has experienced this I offer you advice. In the real world, if you are interested in the medical field, you need to shoot for at least a 3.0 GPA by the time you graduate. This may either be really easy for you or extremely difficult due to the major. Anything less than a 3.0 (and the advisors will flat out tell you this anyway) will kill you, especially if you want to get into the medical field/grad school. So if you ever fall below that, you need to work your butt off and try to get back above it.   The major is definitely challenging. The further you get into the major, the better it gets. Getting the big sciences and their respective labs out of the way is the worst and most tedious part. Get through that and you should be fine. Good luck! I switched my major halfway through my sophomore year and had virtually no classes for the Ex. Sci. major. I basically started from scratch a year and a half late and I was able to finish everything and only needed one extra semester with just a few classes. That in itself is an accomplishment.   Ex.

I am really interested in learning how exactly the body works and what you can do to use your body to its full potential, so I am willing to put in hard work towards the major. I am currently in my second semester as a freshman.  As for all the big sciences, I'm actually almost done with them since I came in with AP credits for Biology and Physics, and I am currently taking Chemistry.  I am planning to take the statistics courses next semester. I have one question, for all the higher level courses you need to have declared the major in order to get into the classes, right?"
rutgers,322lqc,TheJerseyBreeze,2,Sat Apr 11 04:56:07 2015 UTC,"Good job with the AP credits, that's a good start and a good sign that you should do fine in the major.   And to answer your question, yes. Most of the junior/senior level courses require you to be declared in the major, especially the electives. The bigger classes such as anatomy and some physiology classes not so much because other majors share those classes. The electives are really the ones you need to watch out for.   In a similar vein, and like I stated in my post, the major is huge. The student to teacher ratio is very wacked which leads to not many sections for classes. You will most likely discover it for yourself but I'll warn you that when registering for classes, you will undoubtedly need two different classes that have the same meeting time. Happens way more than it should because of the growth of the Ex.Sci. major. This goes back to me saying to have backup plans when it comes time to register for classes. The meeting time is what causes most of the problems.  And regarding how you want to learn how the body works, maybe you'll want to veer more toward the Exercise Physiology option in the major. I never really looked into it but I'm pretty sure it's a little more science and lab oriented, more so than the Applied Kinesiology option."

rutgers,31vj4f,dsatrbs,6,Wed Apr 8 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"Rutgers University-Newark Physical Master Plan (.pdf) A Look at the Rutgers-Newark Master Plan (YouTube video)  Primary goal is to ""Enhance the Campus Core"" by making it more walkable:   At the heart of the plan is a proposal to create a multi-block pedestrian walkway through the Rutgers-Newark campus. The multi-block path would allow people to walk from the Campus center to Military Park. The path would begin with a new grand staircase at Robeson Campus Center, a corridor through the campus library, convert New Street to pedestrian traffic only, and extend to Military Park.   Additional plans include:   Creating an Honors Living and Learning Center on Washington Street to attract high-achieving students to campus (~500 student capacity). Upgrading the wireless internet service on campus so free wifi extends from Military Park, across the Rutgers campus and into the neighboring campus of New Jersey Institute of Technology. The wifi would also include all streets between Raymond Boulevard and Orange Street. Renovating Dana Library to include more computer labs, collaborative space and a café. Updating the library was on top of many students' wish lists, according to campus surveys. Creating a new transportation hub in Conklin Hall where commuting students could study and recharge their computers and phones as they wait for buses and other transportation.   These plans are in addition to the existing capital projects that are already in progress and progressing on-time:   15 Washington Street graduate housing (construction photos) The 326-foot-tall building will add a total of 211,000 square feet of housing space in one- to four-bedroom units, with common space for students and academic use. ""Express Newark"", the Rutgers Newark arts center (plans) Express Newark will include an arts incubator, communication media center design consortium, print shop, portrait studio, and lecture hall/maker space, as well as new exhibition and performance spaces for Artists, programming by the RU-N Institute of Jazz Studies, and the Newark Museum.  Life Sciences II (overview) Life Sciences II is a 93,000 sq ft expansion which will contain chemistry and biology research labs, three teaching labs for upper-level chemistry and biology courses, plus a tiered lecture hall that will accommodate new methods for collaborative learning. Part of the space also will be devoted to “entrepreneurial science” research labs for faculty working on technology-transfer research."

If you're not looking to get a Ph.D., then I'd suggest at least taking Math 477 (intro to probability theory) and Math 481 (Theory of Statistics). Neither are easy, but they'll be pretty relevant to a lot of the stuff that happens in economics, especially econometrics.  Beyond that? Like I said it really depends on what you want to do. Some stuff I'd consider: - Math 354 (linear optimization) - Math 424 (stochastic models in operations research)  For a pretty easy class that hits the SAS writing requirements, I'd suggest Math 435 (History of Math)."

rutgers,31wz24,Roronoa_Zoro_,2,Thu Apr 9 00:55:42 2015 UTC,The hardest part of it is trigonometry. When I took it it didn't get any harder than normal than that. You should refresh your precalc if possible before you take it.

There's just normal computation like adding decimals and multiplying that. And then there's simple algebra. Cross multiplication. Fractions, some percentages and other things. Exponents. And then precalc. They give you functions and graphs. Nothing too challenging. If you're in calc you'll do fine. If you're in precalc. You'll do fine.

rutgers,31wswq,kevkev667,2,Wed Apr 8 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"From my experience, and as just a rough guess, I would say midterms start around the end of October.   However, I could probably count the amount of midterm-final classes I had in my undergrad on one hand. Most classes will have 3-4 exams throughout the semester. Thus there is no midterm (unless you'd consider exam 2 a midterm, in which case the end of October is still accurate) and often the ""final"" will just be considered exam 4.  In this case, expect exam 1 to be the first week of October. I've found that exams usually fall in the transition between months (end of one/beginning of next). The only bad part about this is that a lot of classes follow similar testing schedules and you will likely end up having exams for most of your classes within the span of a week/week and a half."

Pretty average amount of string players (maybe around 30) and one on a part for winds and brass. There is a room specifically for basses in the basement by the practice rooms that they should let you use- though I'm not entirely sure what the case is for non-majors.
rutgers,31u7bc,DirtyBird541,2,Wed Apr 8 13:25:51 2015 UTC,He's right. And after you get accepted you can go to the music front office and ask for a key to the bass room.

Personally i like having tons of people. lots of different places to eat on campus and off campus we aren't isolated..i visited a lot of other colleges that were really nice and otherwise similar to rutgers but were isolated as hell..we've got NYC and Philly a train ride away, the shore is ~1hr away driving, a lot of state parks within an hour radius if you like outdoorsy stuff our campus gyms are pretty good, and they can be crowded at certain hours but that's gonna be the case anywhere.. there's a lot of opportunities here, on campus and good chances to network. there's a lot of opportunities to do research, stuff like that. when you go outside NJ, and people see you wearing a RU shirt / hear that you go to RU, they think you're a god damned genius. rutgers is internationally recognized, and as far as most of the country is concerned, we're on the same level as UVA, UNC-chapel hill, Duke, (insert other non-ivy schools that might as well be ivies to most people) if you like animals, there's a lot of animals around---we have the whole farm on Cook, the seeing eye puppy training club, various clubs that involve animal stuff like animal science, clubs that do animal shelter volunteering, we have Mounted Patrols on cook douglass (everybody loves those horses!)"

If you're from NJ the relationships you build will last a lifetime. Most of my friends who went away to school come home after graduation and don't get to see their college friends very much because they're from different states and are too far away. I'm from NJ and I graduated RU in 2013. I still see all of my friends from college whether in be in NYC, Hoboken, Morristown, or down the shore.

I also enjoy going to such a large school because we get funding for most of the projects departments want to do. As opposed to a smaller college where it's a struggle to get funded for a research study. I also appreciate downtown New Brunswick as it's really got some nice shops and restaurants.

As long as you transfer in with an A.S, you won't have to do Core curriculum classes (NJ transfer agreement) and have 60 credits. Computer Science doesn't require a minor so you can focus entirely on CS classes if you want.   Computer Science classes almost all require you to take CS111 and 112 before you can take much else and they both are done one at a time.

rutgers,31so9x,thezohann,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:24:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's taught it. Last semester, my friends weren't terribly pleased with their prof (to put it mildly), and before her it was trefor teaching it. Gong is a very good professor though. He's taught a few grad courses that my friends have taken in the last two years. From their comments, I'd say you can expect a significant amount of work regularly, possibly including group projects (they've been done in 406 before). You will be challenged, but you'll learn a lot. Time management will be crucial. Exams will most likely be a little tough, but still fair.   Edit: I'd also like to note that he's a very approachable guy. Busy, but he'll take the time to sit down and explain things. I know him from CAIT and I hear about his projects pretty frequently. He's been more than happy to explain them in significant detail"

rutgers,31s6bz,RUCN,3,Tue Apr 7 21:00:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I got a D last semester. Went to him afterward to review the exam and he said there was nothing I could do about it.
rutgers,31s6bz,RUCN,2,Tue Apr 7 21:03:12 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not going to be easy for you but its possible.   As to for your real questions in your thread, yes they take the 3.0-3.1seriously. I was actually kicked out my sophomore year for being on probabtion (2.5 gpa) and then raising it to 2.9. Its not impossble to raose your GPA with a D on it though. If youre passionate about getting into RBS, then be prepared to work your ass off next semester.  As for Econ, I think you'll eventually need to retale the class with at least a C but at least ot wont have to be done over the summer. For that I would check the major's website. Also, keep in mind that in order to graduate SAS you need a certain amount of matj credits."
rutgers,31s6bz,drowninginloans,2,Wed Apr 8 03:52:24 2015 UTC,"Not true. If you retake the class, the two grades are averaged together. If he gets a B taking it again, the grade will become a C."
rutgers,31s6bz,RUCN,3,Tue Apr 7 23:13:15 2015 UTC,"Thats what I was aiming at. I guess I should have clarified. Having an F and retaking the class effectively shows a new grade on your transcript. Having a D is worse because, face it, if you got a D in the first place, its going to be very hard to get an A in it to help balance it out. From my expeience, most students who get an F end up getting a C - C+ on their retake and are happy with it. So what I should have said is it's a lot better trying it again going in with a clean slate as opposed to having to average it."
rutgers,31s6bz,ulzimate,2,Wed Apr 8 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"I thought they changed that recently. Only certain schools like engineering does that rule still apply.  Graduated 2014, don't really know."

rutgers,31s5y5,ostralyan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:06:53 2015 UTC,I'm planning to take 15 credits actually. The 4th class would be something easy though just to fulfill an SAS requirement. I've never programmed in C or assembly but CS111/112 have been fairly easy. Thank you for the response!
rutgers,31s5y5,ostralyan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:32:43 2015 UTC,Yeah the biggest problem is in Java you don't care about memory and Java handles errors pretty well..... C on the other hand.... You'll be seg faulting all day.
rutgers,31s5y5,wutwut79,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:39:53 2015 UTC,"In that case these classes will be difficult, start writing in C now to get ready for the class. If it is anything like when I took it they give you no time to learn C they expect you to know it. Maybe 1 class of review on it.   205 is absolutely not a joke class either, the exams were brutal with the average being around 50 percent (of course it gets curved) and the homework taking quite a bit of time. I would say these are 3 time intense classes so plan accordingly."
rutgers,31s5y5,wutwut79,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:47:57 2015 UTC,Would you recommend I not do those three classes at the same time then?
rutgers,31s5y5,sam524ru,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:58:02 2015 UTC,"I would only do it if you have to, but really CS doesn't get easy. There aren't really any easy CS classes (okay maybe databases?) the only problem with this set of classes is that it is a lot to learn and fast. They do compliment eachother in a way though, you need C for both. I would take them, I think you will do fine if you work hard."
rutgers,31s5y5,wutwut79,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:09:13 2015 UTC,I think I'll take them but start learning C over the summer. I was gonna learn JavaScript but looks like I'll have to put that on hold. Or just do both.

rutgers,31s5y5,wildemu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:19:08 2015 UTC,Is 213 only available in the spring? And would replacing 214 with linear algebra be doable then?
rutgers,31s5y5,wutwut79,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"yes, 213 is only in the spring. Linear Algebra is definitely doable with that schedule, it's one of our easier requirements but don't completely overestimate it.  214 and 213 in one semester was my favorite one. It was all programming and felt the most useful to me. I hate the heavy theory classes we so often have to take."
rutgers,31s5y5,wildemu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:09:01 2015 UTC,"The theory is what CS is all about though, the programming is just a tool to implement the algorithms."
rutgers,31s5y5,wutwut79,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"yea, but I wish there was more coding involved. 344 is a really missed opportunity, where we could write programs for the complex algorithms we learn. At least 23 credits of this major doesn't require a single line of code to be written. Imo, that is wasted time.  213 and 214 are the only two classes that kept it project-heavy with theory involved. And if you don't cheat like most of the kids in the program, you will come out a better programmer by the end of those two."
rutgers,31s5y5,wildemu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"344 is the essence of Computer Science though. The whole point is that it is an abstraction of these algorithms you see in programming languages. It isn't a linked list or whatever it is a graph. You abstract them and that is the whole purpose.  I feel like data structures is the class that blends these but the class is really taught too early to learn a lot out of it. There should be another programming class thrown in there.   And if you don't cheat like most of the kids in the program   I am glad someone else thinks everyone else cheats. Well not everyone, but so many people cheat. I try and discuss projects with people in class and they have no clue about anything, how is that even possible? I would spend like 14 hours coding a project and it was all I could think about for a week, I knew the ins and outs of it and they couldn't even talk about a basic part of it.  Had to vent that."
rutgers,31s5y5,wutwut79,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:44:59 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely they do. The problem is two-fold: the students not handling the pressure of their schedules, and also the professors for not changing the projects around. I mean, sesh's photo album project has been assigned for almost 4 years in a row now. You have a sufficient amount of time in between semesters to change your curriculum. That's just laziness in both departments.  I'm finishing up this spring with 314 being one of the classes. 49 people got a 90 and above because they took advantage of steinberg and just all copied off each other. Hard to believe these people will get hired but they will find a way.  As long as the honest people like you and I have a reward at the end with solid fundamentals and job prospects, then the cheating will eventually catch up to these people wherever they end up."

It's hard to find an exact number or estimate of non-members/members, but there are over 80 fraternities and sororities at Rutgers. Many of them live with each other and even where they don't live in the main house they get places with friends inside their fraternity/sorority. Without Greek life, Rutgers straight up would not be able to support as many students as they have now, because dorms are full and they need people to live off campus."
rutgers,31mwxt,bigassnug,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"You just said frats makeup most of off campus housing, then said non-frat people live off campus. Which is it?

Right or wrong isn't important here so much as your lack of acknowledging that Greek life doesn't make up as much of the campus population as you'd like to think it does.  edit:    Almost 47,000 undergraduates and more than 19,000 graduate students   source"
rutgers,31mwxt,litecoinminer123,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, I quickly pulled that information off google. Around 54% of students live off campus, but it's difficult to find how many live near-campus. Until then, neither of us can be certain. But this has been getting besides the point I was making earlier, which I feel still stands: fraternity houses make up a higher percentage of places students go to party and drink. Of course there will be more incidents there. What about all the assaults that happen in or around bars? The majority of the student population is under 21, so that's why it doesn't happen as often, but rest assured it does happen. Should we ban bars?"

When I think of a progressive or liberal college I think of maybe NYU or places such as Vassar or Bard. Not exactly places I'd think of with a huge frat life. When I think of schools where fraternities are a huge presence I think of Alabama, Florida State, basically any SEC school and then places like Lehigh. Mostly conservative schools.   Rutgers is such a melting pot of all different types of attitudes, obviously people are going to be both very pro-frat and very anti-frat. I mean just last year we had students who successfully prevented the arguably most accomplished minority female politician in American history from speaking at our graduation... I love Rutgers, but I'm pretty sure we'd even have students protesting and whining if we were to win a National Championship in football or basketball someday.

Why not fire all bus drivers after Stan was fired?   Long story short, it all comes down to an analysis of costs vs benefits. Most universities hate the fuck out of their social frats, but they put up with them because fraternities provide benefits to the university community, in particular, helping to build a strong base of wealthy well connected alumni. These various benefits are offset by the costs of hosting the fraternity, especially in terms of damages to the university's property and reputation due to frat shenanigans.   Essentially, when something happens, like a rape or a death, and it's directly associated with frat life, the university needs to pull out some damage control to moderate the effect on the university's reputation.   Tl;dr- Someone crunched the numbers and determined the benefits of frat party bans outweighed the costs."
rutgers,31mwxt,TheIronGoat,5,Mon Apr 6 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's a PR move and Rutgers administration is banking on nothing extreme happening at any frat or sorority parties for the rest of the year so that they can say ""shutting down"" frat parties created a safer environment. Then everything goes back to normal, probably with increased penalties for underage drinking or something. But this is a pretty basic move to try and combat some of the bad press Rutgers has gotten this year. The administration knows parties are still going to occur, they just get to say now that they really tried to ""crack down"" on frat culture--or whatever bullshit kind of narrative they'll pull out of their ass.   This is a dumb idea logistically but I can't blame the administration for trying to get ahead of the media on this one.. Rutgers has had an abysmal past half decade or so of bad press outside of the med school merger, Big Ten move and campus renovations.   Also it's not a surprising move considering there aren't exactly a ton of huge Rutgers donors who will freak out if the administration tightens the reins on frats. Our endowment is currently very small compared to comparably sized Big Ten schools, so this move could also be an attempt at appeasing potential donors who want Rutgers to have a more ""serious"" reputation where academics is looked at as a bigger focus of student life. Basically what I'm saying is that having a ""frats are filled with rapists who buy their friends"" vs. ""fraternities literally cure childhood cancer with their philanthropy"" argument is beside the point.   TL;DR: I agree; this is definitely a simple costs vs. benefits decision on the administration's part."

rutgers,31mwxt,MISMO,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"That's right, but by banning all social events Rutgers essentially is taking what little control they have over parties away from themselves. If a Greek organization is having a party, then the school will have known and could respond accordingly if it was registered. Now however, the school has no idea where social events are happening. As a member of Greek life myself, there have been numerous times when an overly intoxicated woman has shown up to our house and we watched over her until the ambulance arrived to help. I'm not so sure that those throwing off campus parties without the support of the school would do the same, whether its for lack of morals or fear of getting in trouble."

rutgers,31n9z8,thebruns,2,Tue Apr 7 13:55:27 2015 UTC,Where are the top rated public research schools?   You then proceed to list mostly private schools in an attempt to 'prove me wrong'.      Your list by public school:    UCLA Michigan UC-Berk Washington Wisconsin USC Minnesota UNC Ohio State Penn State    Big Ten makes up half of the top ten public research universities.  Good job proving my point.
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:03:25 2015 UTC,"USC is not public.  Also, lol @ any ranking that doesn't have Cal at top."
rutgers,31n9z8,barneydid911,0,Tue Apr 7 20:18:04 2015 UTC,So then 5 of the top 9 public research universities are in the Big Ten.  That's even more support for my argument.
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,2,Tue Apr 7 20:27:00 2015 UTC,I would not be proud of a ranking that includes a university whose accreditation should be suspended.
rutgers,31n9z8,barneydid911,2,Tue Apr 7 20:28:37 2015 UTC,You're assuming that spending won't increase.  Higher SAT scores are caused by the loan crisis.
rutgers,31n9z8,barneydid911,-1,Tue Apr 7 20:19:22 2015 UTC,"Spending will probably not increase enough to wipe out a projected surplus of $25-40 million a year.  The AD will still be off the books completely, which is Barchi's goal."
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,4,Tue Apr 7 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"Oh hooray another article that completely writes off the amount of money the Big Ten is projected to make each school, which again will be enough to wipe out the subsidy and get the AD off of the school's books.   I dunno dude, the article I read totally addressed that.  As for your other points...if you're going to make a claim that these things are connected (e.g., more applicants is from sports), you kind of need to back that up with some evidence before you can claim that the author needs to address them.  I'm not saying that is what you said, but it kind of sounded like it."
rutgers,31n9z8,MutatedSpleen,0,Tue Apr 7 01:19:33 2015 UTC,Highest percentage increase of applications was from the Midwest.  Where are most Big Ten states?  The Midwest.  Correlation doesn't equal causation blah blah blah but that's quite the coincidence don't you think?
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:16:16 2015 UTC,"The incoming revenue ""wipes out the subsidy"" if and only if the current cost structure remains in place. The probability of that happening is approximately zero. Coaches will want to get paid, the athletic staff will want a cut, the trustees will start funding new facilities.  The 30 million subsidy to the athletic program is likely a permanent state of affairs."
rutgers,31n9z8,jedale,-2,Tue Apr 7 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"Where did you get that Rutgers would only break even?  School is projecting to get the subsidy down to $11 million in the next few years before receiving a full share of Big Ten revenue, which will be somewhere between $36-50 million a year.  You can do the math from there.  And no, the Big Ten is not going anywhere anytime soon.  It has the biggest names in collegiate sports and the best public schools."
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,3,Tue Apr 7 12:15:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain you can trust those projections. And do you think there's any reason to believe the cost structure of the football program will remain identical to what it is today?   The board of trustees has shown it's willing to cut the football program a $30 million dollar check every year. I expect that will continue indefinitely; as revenue increases the program will find ways to spend the money. Coaches and staff will get raises, facilities will get upgraded. The program will always be three to five years away from breaking even."
rutgers,31n9z8,jedale,-2,Tue Apr 7 12:24:56 2015 UTC,"My god you don't know anything.  One, yes you can trust those projections.  Second, even if the new Big Ten deal did not increase the amount of money each school received Rutgers would still be in line for $22 million a year which is an increase of $19 million over our last conference.  Third, the football team makes money, the subsidy is for non-revenue sports such as gymnastics and track."
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,0,Tue Apr 7 12:48:09 2015 UTC,"""My god you don't know anything"" lol. Rubber, glue, etc."

Athletics adds nothing to a university except entertainment and some opportunity for mostly non academic pursuits."
rutgers,31n9z8,wutwut79,7,Thu Apr 9 10:22:22 2015 UTC,The school spends about one percent of the budget (and it's declining) on the athletic subsidy.  'Unfathomable' is some $30 million out of a multi-billion dollar budget.
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"But why is a school spending so much on a single extra curricular activity? It adds nothing of value to the school except an image. I wish the school would take a more academic approach and attract applicants through research opportunities and academic excellence instead of the ""college experience"" that kids get advertised.   And yea $30,000,000 is an unfathomable amount of money for me. It is somewhere around 3 million times the amount of money I have now so I can't really think about that."
rutgers,31n9z8,wutwut79,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:52:08 2015 UTC,The Big Ten has more benefits than just athletics.  Please research things more.
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,-3,Tue Apr 7 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"Right and so does being an elite academic university, there are pros and cons to everything but I think in regards to a university it is obvious that the pros and cons should favor academics not athletics and unchecked capitalism."
rutgers,31n9z8,wutwut79,2,Tue Apr 7 13:18:20 2015 UTC,"The benefits I was referring to are academic in nature.  The Big Ten is the most prestigious grouping of public universities in the world, and the schools all share resources in ways that were unavailable to Rutgers in the Big East or, going further back, the Patriot League.  The Big Ten is as much an academic league as it is a sports league.  That is why all but one Big Ten school is in the AAU, and that the Big Ten has spear headed initiatives such as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (which adds in the University of Chicago and John Hopkins) and the Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium.    Rutgers has added a medical school, joined the CIC and the CRC, and has seen the average SAT scores for incoming students rise.    Rutgers is doing both and while it may not be immediately apparent, both academics and athletics are in an upward trajectory."
rutgers,31n9z8,JayRU09,-3,Tue Apr 7 13:40:30 2015 UTC,"Let's not point out the fact that the author thinks that collegiate athletes are paid.    But as the money pot expands with the public’s insatiable demand for athletic entertainment, so do expenses – coach salaries soar, for example, and now new expenses are on the horizon – paying players more (a little cash to ease the exploitation of them a bit), potential legal liabilities over medical issues associated with athletic injuries, etc.   This reeks of someone who knows next to nothing about college athletics."
rutgers,31n9z8,FourDownMagic,5,Tue Apr 7 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"I think she's referring to the recent controversies where people have claimed big-time college athletes are being exploited by universities (selling jerseys with their names on them, using their image in marketing material) since they generally earn less marketable degrees, face physical injury and rarely become professional athletes. Sometimes they are ""paid"" in perks like free rental cars but other times schools are very strict about gifts and student athletes have trouble affording groceries. Part of this discussion was asking if we should pay college athletes a cash stipend for living costs in addition to a scholarship. If the NCAA allows for this student athletes across the board may receive a ""paid salary"" (stipend) to play."
rutgers,31n9z8,SnackFlag,2,Mon Apr 6 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, fair enough. I don't think that part of the discussion was expounded upon enough in that passage and instead implied that athletes are paid outright. Perhaps a better editing job would have resolved that fuzzy factoid."

A mini-ITX case should fit easily in a corner with room still to spare for one or two monitors (depending on the size of the monitors).   The surface of the desk is about 43x30 inches. The keyboard tray is 3.5 inches under the surface of the desk. It measures about 40x12 when completely extended. Even when completely extended there is still about 3 inches under the surface of the desk. The desk comes with a 2 drawer cabinet under the desk but it is on wheels and can be taken out to give you the full room under the desk. I use mine as a small table for more junk.

No one reached out to my friend or me saying that it was their parakeet so he has decided to keep and take care of the parakeet long-term.  Rest assured the parakeet is in great hands and is doing well after just being thrown out into the wild. Sorry no epic renunion ever happened but still a good ending

rutgers,31g44g,talknerdy2me11,6,Sat Apr 4 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"The honors college is completely new, so it will be exciting to be the first class of honors college students.  I just graduated last year, but I never felt like the campus was too big.  I was in the honors program and lived in honors housing for two years, and I made my main group of friends from meeting people in my residence hall.  I also got involved with some clubs so I met other people as well.  By the time I graduated, there weren't many places on campuses where I could go and not see a familiar face.    If you have more questions about the honors college, you should definitely shoot them an email.  They have the most info about anything related to it.  As for going to NY, it's all up to you.  I knew some people liked to make a trip of it and go up to the city every now and then, but I personally never went.    I'm not really sure how to describe the general atmosphere... During warmer months, you'll see all 5 campuses are filled with students hanging out outside, tossing a ball around or tanning or just taking their studying outdoors.  In general, I feel like Rutgers is very lively.    As an admitted student, definitely check out Open House on April 11.  The whole school will be open to you and you could check out a campus with a walking tour or see the inside of res halls on each campus or go to an academic session that suits your interests.  It's much more in depth than a general tour.  I would also say, if you accept, get your housing info in early and same goes for any kind of form you need.  Hope I helped out a bit!"
rutgers,31g44g,bm1992,2,Sat Apr 4 19:56:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! I wish I could go to the admitted student day but I actually live on the west coast :(
rutgers,31g44g,sanpuru,2,Sun Apr 5 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"""does the campus feel too big.""  Not at all to me. Each campus has a very unique experience to offer and you'll end up zoning in on the one that you like most (typically the one that suits your major best). You'll end up taking most of your classes and probably even living on that campus at some point but the ability to jump on a bus and visit any other place at will is amazing and I love that about Rutgers. I tell people, you can make a big school feel smaller (take classes on one campus, spend most of your time on one campus, partake in clubs offered on that campus etc) but you can't make a small campus feel big. There's a lot of unique things each campus has to offer so take advantage of it.  ""How often do you go into New York."" I personally work a lot with Japanese foreign exchange students so I take them into New York City quite a bit. It's slightly under an hour train ride from the New Brunswick station, of which there are bus stops to get there, so it's very convenient. Is it a spot that I go on my own with friends often? No, because New York City is expensive. But the freedom and ease to go there is a nice option available.   ""general atmosphere on campus."" I'd say that the atmosphere changes quite a bit on each campus. I've lived on Cook, currently live on Livingston, but as an engineering student spend nearly all my time on Busch. Cook-Douglass had a slower way about it, more relaxed, people were very friendly I experienced. I don't spend too much time on Livingston despite living there so I can't comment on its atmosphere too much. Busch is for STEM majors and feels busy and studious. I usually catch my friends in between going to the labs or working on assignments. A lot of people hate Busch because there isn't anything to ""do"" on it, ie no restaurants, bars, movie theaters, etc etc, but I love it because I like the studious environment. I can't speak about College Ave since I've never lived there, other than the general party consensus.   Congrats on being admitted! Any questions - just ask."

Yeah it has 5 campuses but each one is different and has its own feel to it. As for the HC, wdym what is it going to be like? Like are you wondering about anything in particular? Like classes or the dorming experience?"
rutgers,31g44g,indraneel,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:02:20 2015 UTC,"Like classes, dorming, workload, etc."
rutgers,31g44g,Dilly_bar,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"Classes/Workload- we take honors classes like the honors program(but some are specifically for HC students), from what the deans have told me, the curriculum is doable even with an intensive major or double major. We have priority in registration for some classes. We have academic advisors who help us maintain our workload and we have direct access to them since some of them will be living in the residence hall with us.   Dorming- ""The residence hall is a combination of a traditional hall, classroom spaces and administrative offices. You will have one roommate and there will be communal bathrooms. However, the building does have air conditioning, hardwood floors within the rooms, 6 seminar spaces, and 15 lounges."" Everything is brand new, so that is a plus. And its in the middle of College Ave and college ave is known to be the most social campus of Rutgers."
rutgers,31g44g,kneemanshu,2,Sun Apr 5 02:26:44 2015 UTC,Just gonna leave this here: http://rutgersfuturebydevco.org/.  The sheer money they're dropping into the honors college is impressive.  Not to mention all the other nice things everyone else here has said about Rutgers (which is pretty much all true)
rutgers,31g44g,kneemanshu,2,Sun Apr 5 02:06:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here gave you great, optimistic responses, and that's great! I really hope I don't come off cynical with this but...  Yes, Rutgers does seem too large. The atmosphere is generally apathetic and indifferent. Attitude will change though when you're at a club meeting or special event. But day-to-day, I imagine it's like that at every other college. And I'm not in the honors college, but there would probably be a difference in attitude between the honors college and the regular students.  I go to NYC about twice a semester to see a show. I imagine a person could go weekly. Train tickets are $26 round trip (but I'm sure there would be a deal if you needed to go very often). There is a bus that will take you to NYC for a cheaper price and you can get tickets at the Student Activity Center. (Sorry if that's too much information for someone who has only been accepted.) So accessibility shouldn't be an issue."
rutgers,31g44g,kneemanshu,2,Sun Apr 5 03:25:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Even the ""cynical"" view seems to be pretty great!"
rutgers,31g44g,kneemanshu,1 point,Sun Apr 5 03:50:27 2015 UTC,"The University is big enough that it has to be small. There are so many people here that everybody can find their niche. The campus is not too big because it really is 5 smaller campuses that have their own unique feel. You can be on Busch, and not realize this is the same school that has Cook Campus   The honors college is new, but this is the President's baby... It will almost certainly be amazing.   Going to New York is something that happens a bunch, but tbh, its not cheap so it isn't a ""everyone goes on weekends"" kind of thing.   As an admitted student don't let the haters get you down. Rutgers is an amazing place which will, if you work hard, do nothing but open doors for you. It can be a home for you for 4 years. It certainly has been for me."

rutgers,31g44g,kaykay310,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:06:56 2015 UTC,"Rutgers has a few advantages over UConn I would say. It's location is key. Being so close to the City and Philly means you have literally thousands of employment and internship opportunities. Rutgers is a more diverse school in every way basically. We have a mix of people you will not get anywhere else. The academic resources here are immense. If you want to do research you totally can, if you want to do an independent study you can. Whatever you want to do, Rutgers can make happen.   In the slightly less important, we have better weather!  In the less important still. Rutgers has a long tradition of excellence and has a rich history. Home to Nobel Laureates, former Senators and Governors. Rutgers has produced some of the greatest and most influential minds in history and in the right crowd here, that is never forgotten, and the tradition continues to this day. I know people doing groundbreaking research as undergraduates! Traveling to CERN is most definitely a thing for undergraduates as is interning at the top everything firms in the nation.   I really strongly recommend Rutgers, but I'm hardly unbiased ;)"

rutgers,31dxew,rupartythrowaway,16,Sat Apr 4 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly Parties at Rutgers are so overrated, unless you know anyone at the party you are not going to have any fun. Yeah there are free drinks but guys are not going to get it unless you have a girl get the drink for you. Most of the times the party is so crowded that you cannot move around, sweaty, to close to other guys, and the smell of alcohol, cheap cologne, and sweat mixed in one. Getting ratio (girls) to get into parties are the worst because you have to convince the girls without leading them on that you are using them to get into the party. Overall my advice is just network with people all over campus, if you fall under a specific ethnic group join a club or organization. Usually there is someone in that group that throws down so be friendly and personable. Freshmen year is the time where you get freebees from upperclassmen, they want to show you the ropes and take advantage of that. The semester is coming to a close and time is ticking for them parties, if nothing happens just get some alc and have a night out with the boys. Nothing wrong with that."

rutgers,31dxew,TheIronGoat,-3,Sat Apr 4 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"You obviously do not know what Rutgers parties are like whatsoever.  You need a girl to get you drinks?  Not true at all unless you want the jungle juice.  Party is crowded, yes, but with mostly girls.  So most likely you will be up against girls which is usually a good thing.  Also, the whole ratio thing is annoying, but girls know, and most do not care, that they are being used as ratio.    If someone wants to party, do not tell them lies just so they won't do the ""bad thing.""  Let them figure it out by actually telling them the truth."

rutgers,318r20,comfortable_in_chaos,-8,Thu Apr 2 23:16:20 2015 UTC,"I was involved in organizing an event where we planned to have him here at Rutgers as the keynote speaker. His booking price is 60k, and we didn't have nearly the funds to pay him.  It's more like Bill Nye the ""money"" Guy. It's going to be the same song and dance he's done many many times before, spruced up with some Rutgers history, so yeah I'd rather youtube it.  I guess I'm not the sentimental type. Anyways it's a decent deal, as it will make 10k students happy on an important day."
rutgers,318r20,CoolSmooth,-5,Fri Apr 3 01:06:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry he didn't feel the need to attend the RU sock club or whatever you were organizing. I hope you do something with your life worthwhile enough to entice a state school to invite you to speak at a commencement. This way you can get on stage and announce proudly ""I'm better than that Bill Nye scumbag, he wanted to get paid for his time but I'm a badass and better than him and I only want 59k for my time.""    I'm organizing a pretentious douchebag club event next week in Singapore. We'd like you to speak for $40, are you in?"

After all, if that wasn't the case, why would I have been a part of an event where we'd want him to be the keynote?  Anyways, my main point is that commencement speakers are largely dependent on budget. Rutgers students have wanted Bill Nye to speak at commencement for years, Rutgers administration has known that, and this is the first year that Rutgers administration has the funds to be the highest bidder - which is great! It's a sign that Rutgers is getting better, probably thanks to the Big Ten."
rutgers,318r20,CoolSmooth,-8,Fri Apr 3 07:17:42 2015 UTC,"I'm getting off on the fact that you think you're a special snowflake. You have the gall to judge a man so accomplished in life that he can charge a fee for a speech and his presence. Go ahead and tell me what you've achieved in your time here. You cured cancer? Entertained millions? Generated interest in science in middle school children? No you've done fuck all and you think you and the sock club are high enough to disparage someone who has. Take your arrogance and that of the RU sock club and shove it up your privileged ass. Or prove me wrong and tell me why Bill Nye doesn't deserve to be compensated for his time at the rate the market will bear. I assure you someone is paying 60k a booking, he's honest, not a charity.    P.S. fuck the Big Ten, RU has been an academically respectable and even envied school since before the Lousiana Purchase. Only in the last 10 years has someone decided that the football and mens basketball team have been a mark of value."

Did you know Bill Nye enjoys knitting?  Bill Nye does deserve to be compensated for his time. It's about the money for him, and it's about the money for Rutgers. For you though, it seems to be about the strawman.  I have friends who graduated Rutgers in recent years, and they are constantly being called and asked to donate to the school. Bill Nye and Bon Jovi are the results of Rutgers administration getting their act together and doing some proper alumini investing. And more power to them. It's about the money. They know more donations = bigger endowment --> more research. Stepping stones.  It's pretty obvious that Rutgers is making some strategic bets and they are paying off.   As for the ""mark of value"" of football and basketball, look to the ""rate the market will bear."" It's about the money. Barchi is a renowned neuroscientist. Something tells me he wouldn't care for a sport with that many concussions. Neither do I, and from the sound of it, neither do you, but it's about the money, and ""the payoff is coming; in a few years, we will be getting tens of millions annually from the Big Ten from their lucrative television contracts.” - previously linked Forbes article. It's about the money. Bigger athletic profits --> more money for research.   It's the same plan the other Big Ten schools followed. Nothing new here."

Condi's rescission was about as voluntary as, say, Petraeus' resignation from D/CIA. If ""giving in"" only means publicly pushing her out, then kudos to Barchi. While we're at it, let's pretend Pernetti's resignation was equally as voluntary, shall we?   You're right, though. Those Rutgers kids are the worst. How dare they speak up and organize!? Dumb kids should sit down and shut up.   Despite your overgeneralization of my comment, I by no means suggest students should not voice their opinion. I merely suggest that protesting one of the most accomplished contemporary African-American academics is embarrassing."

rutgers,318r20,rockychunk,2,Fri Apr 3 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"This is a little bit of a stretch, so bear with me.  Right now, the Republican Party has a voting base divided as follows:   1) The rich and super rich. Many of these people are involved in the fossil fuel industry, which has been under attack by legitimate scientists for the past few decades for their negative impact on the environment. This causes them to reject scientific reports about man-made climate change, the dangers of fracking, and the long term consequences of oil spills. These people generally hate scientists, and lobby their representatives to silence researchers and their work.  2) The super-religious. These are the people who believe the bible as a literal historical record. They firmly believe that the earth is between 6000 and 7000 years old. They are also creationists who think the ""theory"" of evolution is the work of the devil. Science has all but proven the theory of evolution and all but proven that the earth is 4.5 billion years old. Therefore, these people ALSO hate scientists, and ALSO lobby their representatives to silence scientists and insist creationism be taught in our schools.   Ergo, it's justifiable to say that the Republican party hates scientists. Condi Rice is a (former) high-ranking Republican official. Therefore, to them she is the enemy."

They were one of the first students to do it so they received an iPad and cologne and a bunch of other gifts during some banquet. Though, I don't know if they still do that because I presume the number of students has risen. Their majors were Mechanical Engineering and Material Sciences Engineering so the Packaging Engineering certificate fit well. I'm not sure how much the certificate would fit with ECE. You should speak to a dean about that, that's what they are their for. I used to be ECE myself, I switched to Civil later on. ECE was brutal, good luck.

This year instead of ipads for every student they gave out a very large amount of scholarships (I got a $1k one and I didnt even do anything) and an engineering hoodie to every student. In addition, they have probably the best connections to industry of any department, and I got my internship this summer as a direct result. Also an added bonus is that the classes are really easy compared to your other engineering courses and two of them will count as your major's Tech Electives."

rutgers,31370p,OriginalGoose,2,Wed Apr 1 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't worked in the labs for a couple of years but I will answer the things I can remember, and I'm sure others can fill in the rest.   Summer training is honestly kind of rushed, because there's a ton of stuff that you do on the job that can't get covered in that time. But you get the hang of it quickly once you start working.  The scheduling is done mostly by you. You select shifts that work for you (and give them a ranking of preference) and if they can work it into the schedule they will give them to you. They will never give you a shift you did not request, and there is a short add/drop period where you can drop and try to add shifts, just like with the classes. There's another shift sign up period during finals, so you can again, schedule yourself around your finals/study time.  If you need a day of for a legitimate reason AND you give enough advanced notice, they can excuse you from it, but that's really a last resort. As soon as you know you need a certain day off, you put the shift up for coverage on the website, and most of the time, another consultant who wants the hours will take it.   There's no drug testing.  It depends on the shift, but it's usually the same things over and over. There will be a printer jam, someone will need help opening a file, regular stuff like that. Sometimes you'll get more specific questions, but those are less common. Expect busy periods between classes where everyone and their mom will have to print.   The job is fun. For the most part I liked my coworkers, and I liked being able to get stuff done. However, don't totally suck and slack off, because everyone will hate you. Get your shit done, and you will most likely still have time to socialize, do homework, and dick around on reddit."
rutgers,31370p,Dr_Girlfriend_,2,Wed Apr 1 19:17:26 2015 UTC,"This is entirely correct. Not much has changed as they use the same scheduling portal.  The key to getting hired is to pickup shifts and learn the ropes fast. Watch the scheduling portal and if someone drops a shift, pick it up. When the managers email out about a shift the next day (or same day) that they REALLY need coverage for, pick it up. That's the key to getting hired after the CIT period. Obviously if you're just a likable person and get along with management/older consultants you'll get onto the permanent schedule anyway."

For me as a freshman that was too much. Like we'd learn something on monday and have a test on it friday. Because there is just so much to cover there ends up being a lot of material to do/study. It's definitely not impossible BUT as a freshman you might want to reconsider. Then again if you want to start a language you'll have to do it in the fall semester (they don't offer 101 language courses in the spring) so if you don't take it now you'll have to wait until next fall. It's up to you whether the positives outweigh the negatives.

rutgers,30y6op,litecoinminer123,2,Tue Mar 31 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so a couple things.    Assuming you use cars, everyone legally needs to have commercial delivery insurance. If you get into an accident (which any type of delivery timer tends to increase the chance of) personal insurance will drop you if you were using your car for a business.  People at rutgers tip like absolute shit, especially people in the dorms. It's impossible to keep delivery drivers around anymore because people tip so shittily. People regularly tip less than a dollar, or nothing at all, so keeping your drivers is going to be hard unless you pay them a lot. Speaking of pay, How much are you planning on paying your drivers? Federal minimum is now 8.35 an hour, if they're making less than that every hour, you need to pay them the difference, or they can take you to court for it.

I think there's maybe one upper level elective that has intermediate macro as a prereq.

Other college ave dorms are going to be closer to the action, so to speak.  After your freshman/sophomore year, you're likely going to want to move off campus anyhow."
rutgers,30xvw7,futt,2,Tue Mar 31 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"Only Campbell Hall is especially separated from the College Ave student facilities, at least in terms of access. Most of the social action is off-campus anyway, so whether you live in the dorms between College Ave or George Street or in the River Dorms won't matter too much. Mettler, Tinsley, and Demarest tend to have a large number of freshmen whereas the River Dorms, Stonier, and Clothier have a slightly older crowd.   I've had a number of friends live in the River Dorms and they report that there is a fair amount of socializing on the floors themselves. Some floors in the River Dorms may be special learning/living communities which tends to affect how they socialize. But I don't think that the fourth floor of Hardenberg is any different than the fifth floor of Campbell, for example. Frelinghuysen has a fair amount of international students and they tend to socialize separately from non-international students. I don't know if there's any truth to the River Dorms being ""temporary"" housing, or at least any more ""temporary"" than any other residence hall. One of the River Dorms has A/C but all have the same amenities as other standard residence halls."

rutgers,30tsp4,KimCheese,8,Mon Mar 30 21:38:09 2015 UTC,"I don't believe most of what he's saying. In most cases I've seen, people behind DDOS attacks have at least some clear reason why they're targeting whoever they do.  Had this DDOS been followed by a demand to the university for bitcoins, or a clear and outlined complaint against the school's services, instead of merely ""fix the buses,"" then I would be more willing to believe that there were serious intentions behind this.  However, the statements given by exfocus and the manner of which this attack was done against our school, I'm more inclined to believe it was a student on-site seeing how far they could take it. I wouldn't be surprised if everything exfocus has said in this interview was just to throw them off.  He mentions in the interview having no affiliation with RU and never being on-site during any of the attacks, but he did seem to have at least some rudimentary knowledge of on-campus buildings (i.e., mentioning the Sbarro in the Livi Student Center)  Just my two cents. Glad the attacks have stopped, it's nice to be able to get back to my homework."

No one can really say anything except that 'exfocus' is most likely someone who is at least affiliated with the attacks due to his knowledge. However, proper authorities are the ones who need to handle this, not students. At the end of the day, we are still safe. The client/hacker/whoever are all/both mentally messed up, but we can be grateful that this attack was only virtual and no physical violence was inflicted upon the school.

I was mistaken, it was a 3 BR apartment. Still, it is $1312 a month per person, so it still adds up to $47,232 a year for one apartment split 3 ways, which is absolutely horrible and a rip off to those who house there."

But then you also pick out back-ups so if something doesn't work out when they make your schedule they'll put in one of those. But yes, they are your real classes and I have so many regrets about my first semester so actually read the course descriptions and choose wisely."
rutgers,30vt9e,bagelbandit,2,Tue Mar 31 03:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yes they are your real classes. They already have their fall classes figured out generally. Most class times and locations dont change much from year to year so it's not really that complicated for them to make the next semesters schedule.  You dont get to choose the times though you get a booklet of classes (not all of our classes...we have waaay more classes) but it has a lot and you choose ones that you would want to take. They try to give you the ones you want. If you dont like the way your schedule is, you can change it when you start your fall semester, it's not that big of a deal. You have 100% control over your schedule."

rutgers,30tc28,Cowcacao,3,Mon Mar 30 15:25:12 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain why we are able to access Sakai on campus but not of campus even with the DDOS attacks?. Just wanna know the computer science elements behind it.
rutgers,30tc28,truit,6,Mon Mar 30 15:53:23 2015 UTC,Just a shot in the dark but my guess would be that they made it so that only RU addresses could connect so that non-Rutgers computers attacking them would not be able to do so.
rutgers,30tc28,Daniel_Yusim,0,Mon Mar 30 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"Not exactly.  The way I understand it is that Sakai's server essentially has two cables connecting it to the outside: one to the Internet at large, and another to Rutgers' internal network.  The DDoS attack overloaded the line between Sakai and the Internet, but the attacker couldn't have overwhelmed the line between Sakai and the rest of Rutgers.  There is likely a firewall that made sure that Sakai's server didn't actually handle the requests from the DDoS (if it tried, the server's CPU and such would be overwhelmed and would crash), however."
rutgers,30tc28,BasicHumanDecency,3,Mon Mar 30 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"I see. So, for an off-campus student seeing a down page, the site itself might not actually be down, just the line you're connecting to the site through might be too congested to get through because that's the one being attacked, right?"
rutgers,30tc28,Daniel_Yusim,3,Mon Mar 30 17:08:33 2015 UTC,That's my understanding.
rutgers,30tc28,BasicHumanDecency,3,Mon Mar 30 17:15:27 2015 UTC,I feel smart!
rutgers,30tc28,Daniel_Yusim,4,Mon Mar 30 17:19:17 2015 UTC,"Nope. Sakai has one ""cable"". Daniel_Yusim's comment above was spot on. Where did you even get your idea from? Nobody configures individual servers that way."
rutgers,30tc28,slightly_anon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"I'm confused.  If Rutgers has a 10Gbit line on Sakai, and it's getting hit with 11Gbit of traffic,  why is it consistently accessible from on campus, and consistently inaccessible from off campus?  I am not knowledgeable at all on networking, so I'm not doubting you.  Just curious."
rutgers,30tc28,BasicHumanDecency,3,Mon Mar 30 18:08:35 2015 UTC,They've essentially just blocked/turned off access from outside of the network. The outside traffic can't access the Sakai server if the IP isn't redirecting to the actual box.
rutgers,30tc28,ashrocks94,2,Mon Mar 30 18:24:21 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  So the traffic directed at Sakai gets dropped at rutgers.edu unless it's coming from inside?
rutgers,30tc28,BasicHumanDecency,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"It's like if you had a router with all of Rutgers stuff plugged into the slots for Sakai. Then you unplugged the Ethernet cable from your modem. The stuff plugged in can communicate. But since the Ethernet to the modem isn't plugged in, stuff outside cannot.  Edit: this is a crude representation. I would go into more detail if I wasn't in class."
rutgers,30tc28,ashrocks94,2,Mon Mar 30 18:32:19 2015 UTC,Wait.  This sounds kind of like what I said before.  I'm missing something.
rutgers,30tc28,BasicHumanDecency,2,Mon Mar 30 18:36:20 2015 UTC,Before what Daniel said was happening. Now its what you said. Rutgers has itself shut off access to Sakai from outside. I'm pretty sure you are spot on. Except the firewall part.

Also, some of them were swatting, which is when you prank call high security police forces to go to residential homes.

rutgers,30pnay,wildemu,2,Mon Mar 30 01:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly It is possible to get away with it if you know what you're doing. The source of the botnets under his/her control is most likely not due to his work -- he is probably paying for the ""service"" of someone more experienced, who is likely doing everything they can to remain anonymous. The FBI may not be able to find the person who owns the botnet and will therefore not be able to follow the money trail. People like this are usually caught by not using their proxy/TOR/VPN/whatever 100% of the time (for example, if they registered the Reddit username from their dorm internet without the proxy), or if they are using a VPN and the FBI gets the logs from the VPN company. The only thing you can really do against a DDOS is to add the attacking IPs to a firewall blacklist. Since the guy claims to have over 100k computers at his disposal, he could only be using a tiny fraction of that at a time, and as soon as Rutgers blocks the IPs currently attacking, the attacker switches to a different set of PCs."

Correct me if I'm wrong but what I meant was that Zayo needs to drop the packets before they reach the router that provides the interface between Zayo and Rutgers' network. When the attacker is targeting the network itself and not a specific service like Sakai or CAS, the router gets overloaded, however according to the tracert routes to Google (1e100.com) skip this router and go straight to Zayo which explains why Google and Youtube works when no other sites do."
rutgers,30pnay,ishiz,3,Mon Mar 30 00:17:03 2015 UTC,"You won't be able to blacklist more than 10 - 50 IPs on an upstream provider - they simply can't just accept so many rules considering they have so many other clients. If they did, then their network would become a lot slower. They need rule-based filtering (e.g. if a packet has this signature, it is a bad packet and drop it like it's hot)"
rutgers,30pnay,dreadiscool,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:50:28 2015 UTC,The attacker claims he has over 100k computers at his control. How effective would rule-based filtering work in this scenario? With that many clients many could be sitting idle at a given time. Wouldn't it be hard to tell the difference between those clients and legitimate clients who have a bad connection?
rutgers,30pnay,ishiz,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:42:16 2015 UTC,"For example, a common attack vector is SYN flooding. A lot of skids forget that in RFC 793, a SYN packet must implement all TCP options.

rutgers,30pnay,goodcleanchristianfu,3,Sun Mar 29 18:21:45 2015 UTC,They could certainly just be paying for access to a botnet. Seems like they're making some pretty stupid moves though unless he's trying to get caught.
rutgers,30pnay,MutatedSpleen,11,Sun Mar 29 20:58:44 2015 UTC,"Well, at least y'all finally acknowledge the problem officially."
rutgers,30pnay,wildemu,8,Sun Mar 29 21:20:31 2015 UTC,Why would someone want to DDOS our WiFi? Is this some new type of terrorism where you stop people from accessing cat pictures?
rutgers,30pnay,kevingp12,12,Sun Mar 29 17:08:09 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the WiFi that was down, mainly the authentication behind it and network congestion.  As the to terrorism part, the FCIA - Federal Cat Investigation Agency is currently looking into it."
rutgers,30pnay,YooHoss,3,Sun Mar 29 17:43:17 2015 UTC,The kid doing it is a sociopath with a power complex.  Not a joke.  Legitimately hope this person gets the help they need.
rutgers,30pnay,YooHoss,6,Sun Mar 29 18:06:08 2015 UTC,he can get all the help he needs from his cellmate for all i care.
rutgers,30pnay,Heat55wade,7,Sun Mar 29 18:03:00 2015 UTC,rutgers.edu seems to be down and I cant even continue doing research anymore the link to academic search premier which uses cas authentication is down too. I hope my assingmet is postponed
rutgers,30pnay,forbiddenone,5,Sun Mar 29 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"This is just my personal opinion, but I wouldn't doubt that anything due this weekend or this week might get a little bit of an extension."

rutgers,30pnay,slightly_anon,4,Sun Mar 29 19:05:53 2015 UTC,Are we using software such as CloudFlare which are known to significantly alleviate DDOS attacks?
rutgers,30pnay,glyndwr_michael,2,Mon Mar 30 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"Cloudflare only protects web sites (the same is true for many of their competitors). Rutgers can't move all its web sites to Cloudflare, and even if they could there would still be non-web services that could be attacked. As long as there is anything left at Rutgers that is attackable then this type of attack would still cause significant problems."
rutgers,30pnay,litecoinminer123,0,Mon Mar 30 01:46:50 2015 UTC,Yes.
rutgers,30pnay,slightly_anon,5,Sun Mar 29 18:46:00 2015 UTC,Just started a ranked match of league and just got kicked off. My teammates gonna be pissed.
rutgers,30pnay,litecoinminer123,2,Sun Mar 29 19:37:10 2015 UTC,Don't jinx yourself...
rutgers,30pnay,dreadiscool,3,Sun Mar 29 19:41:19 2015 UTC,Cant you just block some ip ranges? (Legit question from a cis newb)
rutgers,30pnay,litecoinminer123,5,Mon Mar 30 02:18:15 2015 UTC,"The problem with a DDoS attack is that the volume of traffic it too large for Rutgers' network. ""Rutgers"" can't block ""china"" (or whatever) because by the time the traffic gets to us to be blocked the damage has already occured (ie: the internet connection is overloaded.)"
rutgers,30pnay,slightly_anon,3,Mon Mar 30 12:31:28 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Just to expand, blocking IPs can only take place once the packets have already reached a Rutgers machine and have been processed against a ruleset.  After that, they can be passed on to the application if they are not from a malicious IP or dropped if they are. Given enough traffic, this  will still eat up all the bandwidth and make Rutgers essentially inaccessible, even if every packet is dropped when it gets there, because the traffic has to get through the network first. The ISP is really in a better position to block IPs  because they can prevent those packets from making it down the pipeline to Rutgers at all."
rutgers,30pnay,dreadiscool,-2,Sun Mar 29 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"There isn't any ISP between the internet and Rutgers. Rutgers is the internet, for lack of a better way to put it."
rutgers,30pnay,ishiz,3,Sun Mar 29 19:31:47 2015 UTC,That's silly. It's like saying that Starbucks is the internet when you use their wifi... Rutgers is closer to the internet than Starbucks (probably) but it isn't the internet. There is in fact an ISP between us and the internet: Zayo.
rutgers,30pnay,goldenflairs,0,Sun Mar 29 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, man, think what you want. Realize there is much more to the internet than Reddit and Facebook. Rutgers is part of the internet backbone."
rutgers,30pnay,glyndwr_michael,2,Sun Mar 29 23:08:21 2015 UTC,Um what?  http://bgp.he.net/AS46#_peers  Rutgers is in no way part of the internet backbone. They are connected to Abovenet/Zayo who are large enough to be constituted as a backbone
rutgers,30pnay,Frenchiie,-4,Mon Mar 30 00:01:27 2015 UTC,There's always much more than meets the eye. I'll leave it there.
rutgers,30pnay,forbiddenone,4,Mon Mar 30 00:07:08 2015 UTC,To be part of the backbone other companies have to send their traffic THROUGH your network. Rutgers is a leaf- nobody connects to us except our own users.
rutgers,30pnay,rosepudding,2,Mon Mar 30 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"AS46 (Rutgers) is peered with Zayo. However, AS10466 (UPenn) is not. Rutgers and UPenn are peered with each other, so in some cases traffic from UPenn destined for a service on Zayo may travel through Rutgers' net depending on the length of the AS path  Source: bgp.he.net  Edit: It's worth noting however that this is probably a minuscule amount of traffic"
rutgers,30pnay,constipatinglaxative,2,Mon Mar 30 00:19:22 2015 UTC,This is false. Rutgers doesn't operate a tier 1 network.
rutgers,30pnay,EED_APAP,3,Mon Mar 30 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"Why is it that all the google services(gmail, google, google fianance, youtube) work just fine for me? but nothing else"
rutgers,30pnay,tbudd,4,Mon Mar 30 01:03:06 2015 UTC,"They use a different CAS server than MyRutgers, Sakai, and some others. If you go to the MyRutgers page and hover over the login button, the link will be to cas.rutgers.edu  (its IP address is 128.6.217.212). Scarlet Apps uses cas2.rutgers.edu (128.6.23.197)."

rutgers,30pnay,gaypolarbear,3,Sun Mar 29 21:29:11 2015 UTC,Any chance of a school-wide email going out?
rutgers,30pnay,gaypolarbear,5,Sun Mar 29 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"I think a school wide email would be best, especially for teachers."
rutgers,30pnay,ISwitchedToTea,5,Mon Mar 30 01:36:06 2015 UTC,An email should be going out shortly.
rutgers,30pnay,gaypolarbear,7,Sun Mar 29 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"Any chance of one being sent out to all students and staff, and not just IT? Or perhaps an update on one of the Rutgers websites or Twitter/Facebook/some social media account (since scarletmail is down)?   There's a ton of misinformation being spread around and some people who don't check Reddit are getting scared about their SSNs and other personal information being stolen. It'd probably be a good idea to calm these people down a bit."
rutgers,30pnay,ISwitchedToTea,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:11:43 2015 UTC,Myself and others have made that recommendation on the Rutgers it email lists.  I'll see what and if any updates when when my boss comes in this morning.
rutgers,30pnay,ISwitchedToTea,4,Sun Mar 29 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"RU professor here, rci.rutgers.edu is down and I can't get onto Sakai (from off-campus). So, unless your prof is a redditor, there's not many ways to find out. I called New Brunswick Today and told them to look into this last night after u/hypocricalrutgers initially posted. But other than that one story today, teachers may not be aware of these attacks."
rutgers,30pnay,gaypolarbear,4,Sun Mar 29 18:48:24 2015 UTC,Well then their respective deans need to alert them. This is completely unfair to the students. My roommate has 2 exams tomorrow and is freaking out. He hasn't been notified at all.
rutgers,30pnay,PuppyNubblies,2,Mon Mar 30 12:35:07 2015 UTC,"Department chairs would have to call every instructor. With 10,000 full and part-time faculty, I don't think that's going to happen. And faculty members who are aware of the connectivity issues can't contact students because our email rosters are on Sakai."
