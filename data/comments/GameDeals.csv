GameDeals,3e3j2z,dEnissay,29,Tue Jul 21 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"For those of you wondering about DLC: -- Outland comes with ""Airbook and OST"" -- Fallen Enchantress comes with none of its six DLC -- Mercenary Kings has no DLC -- Endless Space does not come with Disharmony, but does come with 'Amplitude Badge', 'Dev Team Amplitude Badge', and '1000 GAMES2GETHER Points' -- The Stanley Parable has no DLC    I realize that most of this is already spelled out on the storefront, but I thought I'd post it here as confirmation.  I didn't claim my Van Helsing key because its DLC is pricey and I'd rather just buy the complete pack when it goes on sale."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,corpdronesarelol,10,Tue Jul 21 18:26:24 2015 UTC,Stanley Parable does have an nontraditional demo though. It's a specially created level for demo purposes.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Aperture_Kubi,3,Tue Jul 21 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"If TSP is like the original Source mod at all, the demo doesn't capture the branching narrative with a narrator that made TSP really unique and hilarious, but it does give a glimpse into the sort of meta-examination of the medium and humor that's found in the full game."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,negativeinfinity,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:02 2015 UTC,I think the demo does a good job.  Adam Sessler plays the The Stanley Parable Demonstration
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Aperture_Kubi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely a linear narration and not really fleshed out about what the player is doing."

GameDeals,3e3j2z,Sewaz,14,Tue Jul 21 18:10:08 2015 UTC,"Do not play Mercenary Kings' local multiplayer unless you have a BIG-ASS screen to play it with.  The devs implemented local co-op in the most bizarre manner: with just two players, the screen is split FOUR ways. Top quarters are for gameplay, bottom are for map and stats screen. You cannot change this. Even on a 40-inch screen, it was tough to see things when I tried this out for the first time with a friend. Very disappointing for me as I intended to have it as one of our co-op games."

GameDeals,3e3j2z,Toothstick,10,Tue Jul 21 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, Fallen Enchantress, is this the good version or the crap one? I remember the first version being horrible and the next version being considerably better, but I can never remember which is which.  If you don't have Endless Space or The Stanley Parable, I'd say it's worth BTA for them. I have them both, but I don't have Van Helsing II, so I'll probably skip the BTA (especially since I still haven't played the first Van Helsing game)."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,wjousts,14,Tue Jul 21 18:13:45 2015 UTC,"Fallen Enchantress, is this the good version or the crap one?   This is the better one, Legendary Heroes."

GameDeals,3e3j2z,the_bridgeless_troll,3,Tue Jul 21 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"That maybe true, but this game isn't worth $40 to me. It is absolutely worth $1 to me. Although with my back log, I'll probably not get around to playing it."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,wjousts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:14 2015 UTC,"This is the 'better' one. I used the quotation marks as I still don't think it's a great game. It had a lot of potential but nothing pushed it to what it could be.   I did enjoy the game initially and got about 15 hours out of it before I realized how repetitive it was becoming. The tactics were the same, the questing was the same, the research felt constrained and a fair bit of the micro-managing was tedious. When I played it (last year) there were also some movement bugs that had me waste several turns trying to get a boat to disembark. Hopefully that's been fixed by now.   It's totally worth the price in the Humble Bundle, but I wouldn't pay more than $5-$8 for it on its own at this point. There are better games out there (Endless Legend, for example)."

GameDeals,3e3j2z,ZimbuTheMonkey,6,Tue Jul 21 18:04:54 2015 UTC,OP has good taste
GameDeals,3e3j2z,sleepyafrican,15,Tue Jul 21 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"Space Engineers is a great game, But that is a shit price.  It was much cheaper in the Summer Sale."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,DrunkDeathClaw,7,Tue Jul 21 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, looks like cheapest point was around $6-7 and humble's effectively asking $14."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,LG03,20,Tue Jul 21 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"Space Engineers for $18? Seems awfully high, and the devs are already working on Medieval Engineers. I tried SE on a free week or weekend and feel I get the most enjoyment out of it I would in that time. It's a cool idea, but it isn't well optimized and the multiplayer was really iffy which to me would be one of the most interesting parts of it. Considering the same devs abandoned their last game and SE is still early access, I am highly suspicious of them (The old game was Miner Wars 2081 if anyone is interested, go check out its rating on Steam).  Endless Space is the one I'm kind of interested in, I kind of enjoyed it from the free game time it had some time ago but not sure I really want any of the rest of the stuff in this bundle. Stanley Parable was really overhyped for what it is, there's no replay value to it and when I realized I hit the end of the game I was kind of like ""Oh...well that's all?"". It's really something people either love or hate I think."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Shintsu2,0,Tue Jul 21 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"feel I get the most enjoyment out of it I would in that time.   And I have 22 hours into it. Different strokes.   I am highly suspicious of them   Check out the development history of Space Engineers and you'll see they've more than redeemed themselves. Medium to large-scale updates every single Thursday. They haven't missed one and they're still working on actual planets to land on/orbit/mine and have been adding the framework for those planets for the last month or so.  I agree that the price is high compared to what it has sold for in the past, but I disagree with the notion that the game doesn't have a lot going for it."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,coheedcollapse,0,Tue Jul 21 18:34:26 2015 UTC,Even at 22 hours... that's just under a dollar an hour?
GameDeals,3e3j2z,pedal2000,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"Is that a complaint? Not many games (or any entertainment medium, really) give that amount of play for the money and I'm only going to play more as the game expands. Also, I was a bit off. 35 hours now. It was 22 hours the last time I really paid attention to it.  Also, not like it matters, but I bought it in very early alpha, so I paid about half what it is now."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,coheedcollapse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be honest, most games above $10 I buy tend to give more than 1 hour per dollar. The closest one is Dark Souls 2 - got CE, played for like 160 hours total, so it's like 1.5h per $.  I did play Space Engineers a bit during a free weekend, but it was... boring. Kinda really boring."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Abedeus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Again, different strokes. I played through Dark Souls once and never played it again.  What may be boring for you could be fun for someone else. There's nothing wrong with Space Engineers, you're just not a fan of slower moving sandbox games."

As for this one, Mercenary Kings and Outland are easily worth a dollar on their own and the second tier is worth it just for Endless Space. I can't quite say the same about paying (currently) $14 extra just for Space Engineers, especially since it's been about that price before. It's a very fun sandbox game, the difference is just a bit extreme.  Also, if you pay more than the average, they throw in ""a Humble Store 25% off Medieval Engineers coupon (expires August 18, 2015)""."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,mynewaccount5,14,Tue Jul 21 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"Man, It's like they went and found a list of stuff I bought in the recent steam sale.

From what I've played, The Stanley Parable is a very interesting story game where the narrator tells a story and you can do what he says or disobey him and the dialouge changes accordingly. That game does some very interesting stuff that I still think a bit about."

GameDeals,3e3j2z,lapin0u,3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:24 2015 UTC,would you recommand BTA just for this game ?
GameDeals,3e3j2z,HelplessKid,5,Tue Jul 21 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"At the moment not. I played this with a friend and after 5 hours our saves got destroyed so we would have to start over and that just wasnt worth it in my opinion.  If you want to play this in coop you have to make sure, that the host enters every new area first. If the non-host enters a new area first, the host most likely crashes which makes him unable to progess any further, as he cant enter the new area after the crash and he's stuck.  If this happens the non-host needs to host and the new area didnt advance the story by just entering it, otherwise the ex-host cant even join the game.  BTW the devs wanted my saves so they could look into it, but it never happened. And with the third one being released i dont think this will ever get patched."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Metallkasten,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:38 2015 UTC,VH2 multiplayer was the only reason I was considering this.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,HelplessKid,2,Tue Jul 21 18:09:30 2015 UTC,You can play it multiplayer but you have to play around a bug. If you make one mistake u most likely have to start over.

GameDeals,3e3j2z,lapin0u,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"games I know  Fallen Enchanteress LE : for me a great 4x game, with a focus on RPG it's the predecessor to  Sorcerer King who came out last week. If you're interested in the genre, I highly recommend it. It's a kind of mix between Civilization and Heroes of MM (a bit like Master of Magic). It lacks in graphics quality (which has been really improved in Sorcerer King) and lore (quest system), but has way more variety. I had some issue in bigger maps, certainly due to my only 4gb of ram.  Stanley Parable : short game which is a must play for video game fans. It makes you think about some game mechanism in a very interesting way. Please don't look at let's play video or any kind of spoiler.  Endless Space EE : I really loved this very polished 4x game. It's easily accessible, very nice, with interesting mechanics. Two critics: the combat system is very simplified (do not expect managing your combat like Total War for example), and the lore of the game is quite lacking (""excel spreadshit simulator"" effect). Disharmony is not included in the EE, but I don't consider it as necessary."

GameDeals,3e3j2z,belgarionx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"Oh ffs, of course.  For some reason I was thinking it couldn't be base64 because I didn't see any plus signs (which is flat-out wrong).  Time for coffee."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,quae3Bah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"BTW, there are no bots :) Just tons of lurkers"
GameDeals,3e3j2z,corpdronesarelol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:23 2015 UTC,Scraping /r/gamedeals for keys sounds like a nice little programming challenge. No one ever tackled that? I somehow doubt that.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,quae3Bah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"No, it was a 72-character encrypted string: aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9naWZ0P2tleT1VeVJUTWZtYm5rdlNVN0dT    @quae3Bah, let me know if you want me to delete that."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,ValtermcPires,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:44 2015 UTC,I just deleted it because it was already taken and thus no longer relevant. I don't mind you reposting it.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,wanderingscribe,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:00 2015 UTC,Riddler would love this.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,-woodhouse-,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:44 2015 UTC,First person to PM with a silly cat gif gets a key for Van Helsing II.  That was quick and hilarious.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,HelplessKid,4,Tue Jul 21 18:38:19 2015 UTC,That's a very good bundle! I bought BTA. Question about The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II - would you recommend to play Adventures of Van Helsing I first? Is story connected?
GameDeals,3e3j2z,-woodhouse-,4,Tue Jul 21 19:27:01 2015 UTC,I'd play the first first. The second continues right after the first ends. But its not mandatory as the story isnt good.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Saakeli,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks :)  I wonder if Van Helsing Part 1 would be one of ""More games coming soon"" next week. That would be sweet."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,weirddness,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:09 2015 UTC,Here's The Stanley Parable for someone (had it already). Pluses are letters below. Remember to say thanks if you got the game!  +DN+M-+2G+F-76++X  MR VC JI  You're welcome. :)

GameDeals,3e3j2z,CrazeeCol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:24 2015 UTC,I click 'Pay What You Want' and it takes me to the bottom of the page. Nothing in sight to let me input how much I want to pay or order.  I tried in two browsers.  Is something going wrong or am I missing something obvious?  Edit  Something going wrong. Kept refreshing. Payment box appeared eventually.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,EdenSB,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:45 2015 UTC,"You should be able to click on a box that says ""Custom Amount"" and input your price there."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,AsaBringman,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:54 2015 UTC,7th time lucky. Not sure why.  It wasn't appearing at all - the whole payment box.

GameDeals,3e3j2z,SuperMoonky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it wasn't there.  I tried quite a few more times and it appeared on something like the 7th time. No idea why it hadn't previously."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Mandavar,18,Tue Jul 21 18:55:12 2015 UTC,"It's not PWYW though, you need to pay $1 min.  edit: Why am I getting downvotes for this? It even says you need to pay $1 in the description.  pay $1 or more for Mercenary Kings, Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, and Outland - Special Edition"
GameDeals,3e3j2z,SuperMoonky,31,Tue Jul 21 18:56:11 2015 UTC,I haven't downvoted you but my guess is that most people are familiar with humble bundle's policy to require a minimum of $1 for steam keys and thus don't think that your comment adds anything. Some might see your comment as nitpicking though it's factually correct.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Mandavar,12,Tue Jul 21 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"In other bundles you could pay under $1 and get DRM free builds, but you'd need to pay $1 for Steam keys. This time they have no DRM free versions so you'll need to pay at least $1.  It's also worth mentioning since the title states PWYW, but yeah it's a minor thing I just thought I'd try and point it out for people."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Multicast,6,Tue Jul 21 18:16:36 2015 UTC,I know and i agree with you. I just tried to answer your question. And right now you have mor up then down votes :)
GameDeals,3e3j2z,boglesby1,0,Tue Jul 21 18:19:13 2015 UTC,First I was like whaat? how this noob got Best of 2014 Winner award.Then I read the second reply.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,SuperMoonky,6,Tue Jul 21 18:26:54 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're getting voted down.  If you pay <$1 you'll only get soundtracks for Outland and Mercenary Kings.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Osiris4,3,Tue Jul 21 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe people think it's pay anything like it says in the title. It's not the case, you don't have DRM free builds this time.  I just thought I'd try and inform people you need to pay $1 min for games."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,wjousts,4,Tue Jul 21 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"So guesses on the extras, since I've been chomping at the bit for another one like this. I'm selfishly wishing for one of either Rogue Legacy or Spelunky."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,imkrut,9,Tue Jul 21 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"Look at the bundle right now. Don't expect anything better than whats already there to be added later. If they had Spelunky in their pocket, they would have no doubt put it in from the start."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,skwert99,5,Tue Jul 21 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"I really doubt those will be add on games, instead of selling points, but who kows for sure but them."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,belgarionx,5,Tue Jul 21 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"I'd guess the Endless Space dlc, Disharmony, and the first Van Helsing since often the additional games have some connection to other games."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,cnethercutt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:35 2015 UTC,At this point; I believe Rogue Legacy is guaranteed to be bundled in few months.  It went on really big discounts.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,zypsilon,5,Tue Jul 21 18:29:51 2015 UTC,"Oh lord, I've been wanting Stanley Parable to play with my girlfriend. She has never played games and I think it's one she would really love as her first."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,cnethercutt,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"What worked with my wife: Cook Serve Delicious, Never Alone, Critter Crunch."

GameDeals,3e3j2z,bugbits,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:29 2015 UTC,Have fun!
GameDeals,3e3j2z,cnethercutt,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:48 2015 UTC,Limbo and Botanicula may also be good contenders.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,imkrut,4,Tue Jul 21 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I have Limbo so I'll definitely play that with her too. I have some coops and a couple of games like Braid as well. I'll look into Botanicula. Thanks for the heads up!"
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Toujin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"Amazing bundle, thank you humble gods."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,YHofSuburbia,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:48 2015 UTC,Humble Bundle's back to form with this one. Great selection of games for a very good price!
GameDeals,3e3j2z,xbone85x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"Get Outland right now. I usually dislike platformers but this is one of the slickest and best looking games I have ever played. Seriously, $1 for Outland is highway robbery."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Monteitoro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:52 2015 UTC,outland also has some pretty nice backgrounds
GameDeals,3e3j2z,GamerPlava,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:45 2015 UTC,i already own it by might buy the bundle for my cousin. what's different about the special edition?
GameDeals,3e3j2z,ziltoid84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:39 2015 UTC,doubtful but would be interesting to see van helsing 3 or 1 or both to make it into this bundle due to the way final cut is going to work.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,BigRonnieRon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:28 2015 UTC,Would you recommend BTA just for The Stanley Parable? I looked into the others and definitely not interested in Endless Space.. maybe VHII (Van Halen (?))
GameDeals,3e3j2z,ziltoid84,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:09 2015 UTC,Van Helsing games are really good diablo clones. Mercenary Kings is like Metal Slug (classic arcade game for Neo Geo)
GameDeals,3e3j2z,DFisBUSY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:05 2015 UTC,I watched a gameplay for Mercenary Kings and really liked it. Also interested in Outland as I love platformers. Gonna take a look at VH and see if it is worth a try Thanks!
GameDeals,3e3j2z,BigRonnieRon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"does anybody know what will be unlocked in the BTA tier next week?  also, is there a way to check on my own?"
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Dead_Politician,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"That's a buy!  Van Helsing series is a really underrated Diablo-style game btw if you're into those. This is the lowest I recall seeing it, unless it was in some other bundles. I think a lot of the other games are pretty familiar to gamers. All good."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,irishrock1987,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:18 2015 UTC,RemindMe! 2 hours /u/RemindMeBot
GameDeals,3e3j2z,xbone85x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:58 2015 UTC,Worth it for just Stanley Parable alone.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Crjjx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:24 2015 UTC,now that bundle is a real steal :)
GameDeals,3e3j2z,BigRonnieRon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:15 2015 UTC,Wow! Every game in the BTA is on my wishlist.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,Pudge_The_Fish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:31 2015 UTC,Same here. Good bundle.
GameDeals,3e3j2z,niky45,0,Tue Jul 21 18:30:02 2015 UTC,How do keys work for this bundle? All in one or separate?
GameDeals,3e3j2z,tycoonrt,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:11 2015 UTC,separate
GameDeals,3e3j2z,rlaitinen,0,Tue Jul 21 18:25:09 2015 UTC,Bought the BTA tier thanks for posting the bundle :)
GameDeals,3e3j2z,IwillSHITyou,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:27:26 2015 UTC,Damn it! I bought almost all of these in the steam sale! So I guess I agree it's a great bundle tho! lol
GameDeals,3e3j2z,kalirion,0,Tue Jul 21 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"Gah! Picked up Outland in the last sale and never played it.  Ah well, still amazing value."
GameDeals,3e3j2z,impelus,0,Tue Jul 21 18:40:16 2015 UTC,"Damn, got Outland and Stanley Parable on Steam sales, when will I learn???  Ah well, it was only card monies."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,GMG-PlayfireCS,28,Tue Jul 21 08:55:31 2015 UTC,TESO worth it for single player only?
GameDeals,3e1v7z,HighOctaneTT,45,Tue Jul 21 09:24:10 2015 UTC,"I'd picked this up a few days ago from GMG's daily sale and it is remarkably meh. It plays like a generic MMO with an Elder scrolls theme. If you've played any MMOs, it's going to feel all too repetitive all too soon. Clocked in about 10 hours before deciding to put this on the backlog list."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,rikitikkitavi,26,Tue Jul 21 11:02:30 2015 UTC,"I also picked this up a few days ago and it definitely does not play like a generic mmo. It's a nice breath of fresh air with the variety of quests, and actually the first mmo for me which makes crafting enjoyable. For $15, go buy it!"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,fuzzyrhino,12,Tue Jul 21 13:27:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give another positive shout out. If you're a person who likes to play alone, but with other people in the same game world, this game is for you. It's really entertaining exploring alone, but then stumbling into a cave only to find another player exploring as well. Without forming a party you both clear the cave together and everyone goes on their merry way without any social interaction whatsoever. It's an anti-social MMO!"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,bigassginger,3,Tue Jul 21 16:41:15 2015 UTC,So you just described the perfect game for me. I guess I need to buy this now.
GameDeals,3e1v7z,gdrouill,15,Tue Jul 21 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"Have it on my Xone (Don't worry I have a gaming PC now) and while it starts off great, the novelty of an Elder Scrolls game quickly wore off. Played it about 3 or 4 times when it came out and haven't touched it since. Some of my friends are loving it though.  I'd say for this price, take the gamble."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,FijiFynn,4,Tue Jul 21 10:22:05 2015 UTC,From what I've read there have been 6 major updates since release; you should revisit it.
GameDeals,3e1v7z,6f00ff,8,Tue Jul 21 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's really fun to just wonder around and explore in the game.  There are lots to do and the different character builds you can do is pretty robust.  One of the biggest problems I have in the game is inventory management.  There are so many crafting items that sometimes it's hard to manage it all.  That all changed when I joined a guild and started dumping things that don't sell for gold but are needed for crafting into the guild bank.  For $12-$22 why not spend a few hours and test out your curiosity first hand?"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,pron_site_operator,6,Tue Jul 21 13:56:31 2015 UTC,TESO feels like a single player game set in a mmo enviroment
GameDeals,3e1v7z,THRiLLKiLL2666,4,Tue Jul 21 14:07:31 2015 UTC,The questing is mostly singleplayer focused.
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Lacasax,21,Tue Jul 21 13:03:16 2015 UTC,Any hidden gems you guys can recommend from the sale?
GameDeals,3e1v7z,bibboorton,4,Tue Jul 21 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"DOOM 3, if you count that. Not a lot of people i know have played it. Its so good."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,tha_dood,20,Tue Jul 21 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"The green man gaming site is unusable right now. It's so damn slow, I can't buy anything."

GameDeals,3e1v7z,hullu153,14,Tue Jul 21 09:01:03 2015 UTC,I missed it. Buying it now :)  EDIT: Should i go Imperial Edition or normal?  EDIT: Went for Imperial Edition
GameDeals,3e1v7z,tinkyXIII,13,Tue Jul 21 09:08:33 2015 UTC,"At that price, go Imperial edition."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,famoustran,9,Tue Jul 21 09:13:26 2015 UTC,What's so great about the Imperial Edition? You just get one more race to play?
GameDeals,3e1v7z,tinkyXIII,7,Tue Jul 21 09:42:26 2015 UTC,"Right, the Imperials can join any faction right off the bat, as opposed to the others which are an optional purchase from the store. You also get a horse (pretty useless) and a mudcrab pet (cute, but it depends on whether you like that sort of thing).  Honestly for just a few dollars more you can get a game that's normally $80 for less than $22. It was the best deal for me, anyway."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Toy_Cop,6,Tue Jul 21 09:49:03 2015 UTC,How is a horse useless?
GameDeals,3e1v7z,tinkyXIII,9,Tue Jul 21 11:08:42 2015 UTC,"When the game first came out, the horses were a little harder to get, and having this one was a nice bonus early game. Now it seems it's much easier to get one, so the need isn't as great as last year. I'm not saying it's totally useless, but if you're trying to save money, the horse aspect isn't as make-or-break as it once was."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Toy_Cop,7,Tue Jul 21 11:13:09 2015 UTC,"I dunno dude, the cheapest horse is still 10k gold.  As a noob to the game I think it's very helpful."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,AwesomeFama,4,Tue Jul 21 11:15:11 2015 UTC,Did the prices change or something? Is the Imperial edition worth it for double the price?
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Never-asked-for-this,4,Tue Jul 21 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"They removed the subscription now, right?"

GameDeals,3e1v7z,bundocat,16,Tue Jul 21 11:27:57 2015 UTC,Very nice of you to give out a code but in the future obscure the code somehow or post it as a picture; there are apparently a lot of bots that seek out keys and redeem them before any of the intended recipients can get them.
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Romulet,12,Tue Jul 21 15:31:30 2015 UTC,Why is this here? Just being nice?
GameDeals,3e1v7z,mayanrelic,4,Tue Jul 21 11:36:04 2015 UTC,Yeah we give out keys to peeps sometimes :)
GameDeals,3e1v7z,RazielYouAreWorthy,10,Tue Jul 21 18:03:00 2015 UTC,"code is used, woulda been cool for whoever took it to comeback and say thank you, I'm gonna give you a +1 though just for trying to spread some joy, unless you used the code yourself and just posted it to mess with people, then screw you :P"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,RazielYouAreWorthy,51,Tue Jul 21 11:36:07 2015 UTC,"Since he didn't obscure it at all, it's almost certainly a bot that took it."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,GetGames,7,Tue Jul 21 12:27:38 2015 UTC,The site.  Is so.  Slow.
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Warruzz,28,Tue Jul 21 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"You mention ""1500 more"" deals, how are customers meant to find them via the store page?   I've never understood this about GMG.  The Summer Sale section only has 3 pages of games, and the search engine is extremely limited without options to search for games on sale only. Am I missing something simple, or is there simply no way to actually browse the games on this site?"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,gb2003,18,Tue Jul 21 09:24:54 2015 UTC,"Here you go, just went live  http://www.greenmangaming.com/summer-sale-encore/#b"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,_Canopus_,16,Tue Jul 21 09:28:54 2015 UTC,"Well that solves the 1500 more issue, so thank you for that, but could you explain the other one?    I've been buying from you guys for a long time and still don't know how to browse games not already promoted on the main pages.  Do you have an index?  It seems like the majority of your games are hidden and not accessible without searching for specific titles.   Or is it really a matter of having to use the search bar just see if you ""might"" have a game."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,wjousts,49,Tue Jul 21 09:34:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's terrible. There are times when I can search for a specific title and STILL not find it. We're working on upgrading the search to be something that actually works. Also, some sort of indexing.. like genre, or publisher, or something. Anything would be more useful than what we have."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,ryansurv,34,Tue Jul 21 09:37:22 2015 UTC,Search systems are a pain in the arse to change/update. I still have flashbacks to ours.
GameDeals,3e1v7z,HantraxHat,3,Tue Jul 21 10:26:47 2015 UTC,"May I suggest not using genre unless its quite specific, going to most sites that sell games have genres breakdown that are typically very bad at what is included in what. Would have to be something like:        FPS-    -Arena Shooter    -Single player      etc, and have the ability to be in multiple sub genres"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Animorph111,6,Tue Jul 21 12:10:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, my suggestion so far is tag clouds basically. I'd like to be able to click RPG and see everything that has that tag."

GameDeals,3e1v7z,G_0,6,Tue Jul 21 09:11:14 2015 UTC,which version of Doom 3 should  I buy ? BFG edition or classic
GameDeals,3e1v7z,FijiFynn,6,Tue Jul 21 10:39:02 2015 UTC,"x-posting my comment from previous thread: Original if you value mods, BFG if you value a smooth out of the box experience. Doom 3 vanilla is old enough that it doesn't even support widescreen natively, and getting it working well generally takes a bit of tweaking. There is, however, a pretty respectable modding scene for the original Doom 3 which BFG edition breaks compatibility with."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,josh6499,10,Tue Jul 21 10:45:01 2015 UTC,"The 15 min expire time for the basket is really annoying in this kind of sales, you begin to navigate the pages (a cumbersome task in GMG, if you ask me), you put a couple of titles in the basket and BOOM! they're gone, you must begin again and be quickly this time... What's the point?"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,iroll20s,5,Tue Jul 21 12:26:30 2015 UTC,"It's annoying yeah, but since they are a key retailer they want to make sure they have a key for you so they put it on reserve when you put the item in your basket. If they didn't then there might be a time where you go through checkout and they run out of keys in the meantime.   It's a dumb system if you ask me. Why put the key on hold when you basket an item? Why not do it at the time of checkout? Surely the once in a blue moon time when you've run out of keys between basketing and checking out would be less annoying than always having a 15 minutes timer... I dunno. It's dumb."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,HandlesWho,5,Tue Jul 21 14:30:26 2015 UTC,Aww yes! Thanks for putting Elder Scrolls Online on sale again. You guys are awesome!
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Saintblack,5,Tue Jul 21 09:08:37 2015 UTC,Grabbed Wolfenstein New Order and Old Blood for $16 with the coupon. That's a freakin steal.   75GB Download for both tho lol!
GameDeals,3e1v7z,HandlesWho,3,Tue Jul 21 09:57:31 2015 UTC,"Dang, bought Old Blood the other day, saw it was 34gb but thought it was because I didn't have New Order, saw New Order just a minute ago and was going to give it a buy but can't be bothered to download over double that again, deal breaker. (750kb/s connection)"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,nmandelas_ghost,4,Tue Jul 21 10:19:05 2015 UTC,Jeez bud! Buy it I'll send you a usb stick with the files.  Let me know!
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Saintblack,3,Tue Jul 21 10:24:09 2015 UTC,"Cheers for the offer but I'll pass. I have a huge backlog I need to get through. (Just bought a dedicated gaming computer, I had a laptop that could run a few things but I bought loads of games I couldn't run which I can now so I'm currently on a gaming fest)"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,nmandelas_ghost,2,Tue Jul 21 11:10:59 2015 UTC,I did the same thing last summer. What was even better was playing the games I used to play on min at 20 fps on ultra at 60+fps.
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Saintblack,5,Tue Jul 21 14:49:20 2015 UTC,Time to slot a couple more hampsters into your server farm. I can't buy anything.
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Saintblack,11,Tue Jul 21 17:01:21 2015 UTC,Ok people recommendations outside of the top 20 please (I have everything I want from the top 20 but also money burning a rather painful hole in my pocket)  I'm in to most genres apart from sports games and sims
GameDeals,3e1v7z,nmandelas_ghost,26,Tue Jul 21 09:08:13 2015 UTC,"So from my experience:  TESO: Shit when it launched. I bought it with 4 friends and put about 20 hours into it. Bots ruined the launch and the repetitiveness and grindy feel with the occasional dungeon got old. However, this subreddit eats the game up and claims that its much better now as F2P. I will probably try it again eventually. If you have a lot of free time, pick it up.  Wolfenstein the New Order: Great single player game. If you have an itch to play with guns but hate the the direction of CoD and Bfield, combine this with old blood for $20 and a great time. Took me about 28 hours to finish both.  Fallout 3: Who am I kidding. If you haven't read up/played this by now I am not sure what you are doing with your life. Great to play prior to Fallout 4 as there are usually cool little things to pick up on from previous titles. However, I seriously doubt Fallout 4 will be a continuation.  Fallout 4 Fallout New Vegas: Same as 3, great game. Recently went back and played it with a ton of MODs and it made it great. This is what I used to mod my Fallout New Vegas. Link.  Portal 2: Without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played, mainly because it is different and hilarious. Great to play with a friend with a few drugs/alcohol too.  H1Z1: I'd skip. Friend bought it, tried to convince me to play it. It's like every other zombie survival game in my opinion, though I may be biased. (I enjoy 7 Days to Die much more).  Metro Redux: A great price and a great game from a great company. 30 hours or so combined for both games I think is how long it took me. Super scary, and very easy to become enveloped in the story. They use bullets as currency. Just get it.  Risen 3: I actually don't own this one, but I can tell you about 2. I picked 2 up on a sale for like $1.99. I need to see if there are possibly mods for it. As it stands, its a generic RPG with really bad combat mechanics. However, it is a pretty fun story. Go watch Pirates of the Carribean and load it up for motivation, maybe?  Roller coaster Tycoon: Meh. Got it on a sale last year, played about 4 hours.  Dishonored: Great single player stealthish game. Really good game. /r/games usually talks about how overrated it is, but there is a reason this game blew up after it launched.  Doom 3: No interest personally. Edit: To clarify, it just didn't jump out at me as a must buy. I loved Old school Doom and have heard this one does it great justice. As another has commented enjoying it, just not something I can personally recommend.  I think that covers most of my experience with these titles. Let me know if you want some more detail.  Edit: Apologies, OP wanted titles other than the top 20. I'll see what I can do between work.  Bioshock Infinite: I got this game for free and I still never finished it. There was so much I liked, but in the end it didn't hold my attention. I think I am still grasping to the first games amazing impact. Watch some videos though, visually it is stunning and if you are a fan of the other 2 titles, you need some closure.  Civ 5: Like Bioshock Infinite, I got this game for free via steam card selling. I put about 14 hours into it before moving it to a rainy day type game. I think I am personally bored with RTS, as painful as that is. Age of Empires still entertains me, however.  Left for Dead 2: Was super fun to play at launch, not sure how active it is now. I would recommend this if you have LAN parties or some friends to play with. Makes it much better and goes great with copious amounts of alcohol.  Valve Complete Pack: Overall won't be worth it for most. There are some great titles here, but most are relatively dated and can be sorted and picked through.  Sins of a Solar Rebellion: Bought it, couldn't really get into it. A little slow paced for me.  Aliens vs Predator: I think this was my first online game, with Return to Castle Wolfenstein (I think was it). I am positive this game will look like shit now, but if you are still running windows 98 this is the game for you.  Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic: So fun. I bought it on my phone and still play it during shits. Not sure if there are mods available ( I am sure there are) as it is a bit dated. Great RPG 10/10.  Tomb Raider GotY: Great game. Used on many sites as a benchmark for card performance. Do you like Tomb Raider, Uncharted, and other 3rd person action games? Get this.  Just Cause 2: At this price it is great fun. I own it with steam so I am not sure how difficult/easy it is to get the free online mod for it through GMG, but it is hours of entertainment. 3rd game coming out soon too.  Remember Me: Lets forget this title came out.  Ducktales: I don't know how I ended up with this game, but my fiance loves it.  Half Life 2: Great game, some mods. Would recommend Black Mesa at this point from steam though. Less headache and looks better than the mods.  Chivalry: So fun. Have about 40 hours in this and I bought it on a whim. Chop heads off or shoot arrows at people, this game can entertain just about anyone. The community is pretty toxic overall, so try not to cleave the shit out of your team to victory.  Saints Row IV and Gat out of Hell: Similar comedy relief as Portal. Dry humor, GTA feel. I made my character look like Goku and had a great time smacking people with a giant dildo. Can be played CO-OP too!  Brink: You are better off putting Jalepenos in your butt for a good time.  Magicka Collection: Really fun 4p Co-op. Great if you can convince friends to buy, not so great matchmaking. Might just be my luck but everyone I grouped with was Russian and wanted me dead (SAME TEAM VLAD).  Evolve: Meh. Has potential. I downloaded the beta with a friend of mine and it was the first game that I was able to play until 6 in the morning in about 10 years. Bought it and that quickly faded. Similar to LoL in toxic community.  Alan Wake: Great game, scary as FUCK. Your weapon is a flashlight and yea. Good luck.  Telltales Walking Dead: I actually enjoy these games for some demented reason. They tug at your heart strings and make you feel like a giant asshole for every decision you make. Wanna save Ted? Okay, but we're killing Junior. Now Juniors dad hates you because he was baiting in a corner instead of watching out for his own fucking kid.  Counter Strike: At this point, you should either own this or stay away from it. Niche game that can make friends, and lose them.  Borderlands 2 and the Pr-Sequel: Borderlands 2 came at a great time for me. It was a dry period of decent games and allowed me to play the shit out of it. 90+ hours never felt so good and it was hilarious. Pre-Sequel I tried at a friends. It feels more like an expansion to 2 than a brand new game.  Wasteland 2: AWESOME GAME! Highly recommend it if you enjoyed old school turn based Fallout.  Alright, taking a break for now. Made it a little easier to read, I had no idea I would start my morning off with my first novel."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Saintblack,5,Tue Jul 21 13:25:22 2015 UTC,"New Order   Thanks for your input  Probably not gonna get TESO but I have not played Skyrim yet, vanilla oblivion was my last so just decided to buy Skyrim Legendary. Wolfenstein, fallout 3, portal 2, metro, dishonored and doom I all own and agree with all your points (apart from doom 3 which I like). Portal 2 is one of a few games that made me literally lol, especially the cave johnston moments.  I think my problem is that I own far to many games and sales have little to offer me. I have made a pledge to stop buying so many games day 1 so might have more luck next year."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Sir_Cunt_Ass,4,Tue Jul 21 13:36:53 2015 UTC,"I have never played any Fallout games, other than about an hour or two of Fallout: New Vegas, which I bought on sale a year ago.   I know it's gotta be worth playing, but I have so much trouble getting into it. It seems so outdated and boring. I really want to be convinced though..."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Lewpa,4,Tue Jul 21 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"It is a little dated. It is super easy to get mods for it though and they even have an installer from nexus mods to manage them.  Graphic packs as well as a weather pack. I am a bit of a visual junky, so it made a great 2nd play through."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Telodzrum,3,Tue Jul 21 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"Does it take a lot of patience before it really picks up?   I know I can find this out elsewhere, but are there any specific mods you would recommend?"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Saintblack,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:52 2015 UTC,"I will edit my post to show the link as well, but this is what I used. Link.  You can pick and choose of course which ones are for you. I would recommend only doing a couple at a time to make sure it is stable. Some mods are really taxing on your rig. If you get an error or crash, disable the last mod. I didn't have any issues, however."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,n3mm,2,Tue Jul 21 14:13:42 2015 UTC,"As to your other question (sorry was editing my initial list). It pretty much takes off from the start. You are thrown into helping or ruining a small town about 5 minutes into the game.  The destroyed Vegas theme really appealed to me. Though the Legion is a bunch of assholes that wear dresses. Beware, some mods will show dicks.   I downloaded a cosmetic pack thinking that it would just graphically enhance people. Knocked out a Legion troop and his junk was bouncing around. Of course I shot it."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,huev,3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion!  Even watching Let's Play videos of the game, it just seems so....stale. Maybe I just ought to play it for a few hours before placing any judgments."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,n3mm,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"Anytime, I updated the list as I didn't realize the OP had wanted games other than the 20 listed.  FNV isn't for everyone and the VATS system can get a bit repetitive. Might be better for you to wait for Fallout 4 at this point though."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Vladddo,10,Tue Jul 21 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"Fallout 4: Same as 3, great game. Recently went back and played it with a ton of MODs and it made it great.   Wut"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,FijiFynn,11,Tue Jul 21 13:38:25 2015 UTC,I imagine he meant Fallout: New Vegas
GameDeals,3e1v7z,Fokken_Prawns_,6,Tue Jul 21 13:45:47 2015 UTC,"Great list and explainations, but to supplement an alternative point of view on a few of these:  Dishonored: It's OK. The art style really put me off for some reason and I felt that the gameplay was a little formulaic and repetitive.    Sid Meir's Civilization V: A great game. I've logged over 1,400 hours into it and it's still my go-to game for days when I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for. It's turn-based, not an RTS.  Sins of a Solar Empire: This game is (IMO) the greatest 4X game out right now. The RTS aspects are leaps ahead of similar titles and the gameplay is deep and completely different every game. There are also some amazing overhauls that fundamentally alter the game (Sins of the Prophets and Armada 3 changes the game so it takes place in the Halo and Star Trek universes, respectively).    Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: No choice but to agree on this one. One of the greatest games of all time, hands down."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,shit_generic_name,3,Tue Jul 21 15:34:26 2015 UTC,"Nice write up.  I wasn't aware of the overhauls on SoaSE and may have to reinstall it. That sounds pretty badass. Reminds me of Crusader Kings GoT mod. I didn't like the game until that, I am a huge GoT fan.  Love a good alternative view and you made excellent points."

GameDeals,3e1v7z,GumballQuarters,3,Tue Jul 21 09:17:32 2015 UTC,"Doh.. I accidentally bought TESO.. I was curious to see if the price was australian, since it says $19.99 (with no clarification if its USD or AUD).. went through to the paypal checkout, but paypal paid it automatically and I didn't have the chance to confirm the order."
GameDeals,3e1v7z,triedtostayaway,3,Tue Jul 21 10:41:51 2015 UTC,"This happened to me the other day, all my prices were showing as $ instead of £ (I live in UK) and so thought maybe it will show as £ when I get to Paypal page.

GameDeals,3e1v7z,BLToaster,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:48 2015 UTC,I think that you're doing a great job. It's infinitely better having a direct source to go to for questions. Look at how the Gamesplanet Rep is absolutely killing it in their respective thread. The outreach that you and the other reps do definitely sway the population here. I think you've got the right balance of outreach and professionalism though. Can't spend too much time hanging out on Reddit! Good luck!
GameDeals,3e1v7z,harmundo,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:15 2015 UTC,delicious Pabst Blue Ribbon   Kind of an oxymoron.

GameDeals,3e1v7z,Marxist_Engels,3,Tue Jul 21 12:56:53 2015 UTC,"On top of whatever else anyone will say, it's going to be F2P on release. So, unless you are rabid for it, wait.  I personally didn't know that way back when I added it to my Steam wishlist, and I forgot it was on there, and a friend got it for me out of the blue for my birthday recently, and... I don't really like it anyways. I feel kinda bad about that. >_>"
GameDeals,3e1v7z,enesup,6,Tue Jul 21 16:46:16 2015 UTC,"The devoted crowd of H1Z1 will try to sell it to you but my blunt opinion would be to stay very far away. The game is supposed to be a zombie survival game but the zombies are not a threat at all due to their lackluster programming. They more or less have just tweaked it to be an online deathmatch between all the players where guns are easy to find and death is frequent.  Unless you are into a repetitive, sub-standard engine online deathmatch with little skill involved I wouldn't get it."

GameDeals,3e3abo,Eneswar,9,Tue Jul 21 17:04:10 2015 UTC,Buy it. Homeworld 1 single player is amazing. Just keep in mind that it's more real time tactics than RTS since there's no base management at all. Just collect resources and build your units.

There aren't many games with this type of gameplay, and Homeworld is the best of the genre. I never got the chance to play it when it came out, but this was the best purchase I made during the Summer Sale by far."
GameDeals,3e3abo,mesocyclonic4,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:55 2015 UTC,how HW compares to Sins of Solar Empire?
GameDeals,3e3abo,mieiri,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:24 2015 UTC,It's like playing a game of Starcraft but in 3 dimensions    Ok. You got me there. Will buy tonight.
GameDeals,3e3abo,mieiri,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:45 2015 UTC,No it's not like Starcraft at all that's a horrible comparison. For one there's no base building unless you count researching ships and adding upgraded facilities to your mother ship base building. Combat involve going between a strategic radar map that allows for long distance maneuvers and the normal camera for short distance movements and a view of the action. The campaign is all about resource management and survival trying not lose ships as you bring all your units to the next mission.
GameDeals,3e3abo,Cbird54,4,Tue Jul 21 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"off the top of my head Sins is more of a 4x with ship combat ... you manage planets / economy / diplomacy and build a fleet to take over planets.   Homeworld is an RTS no other management just drop in a mission, mine resources & fight.  Homeworld does have some things you carry over to future missions.  I forget the specifics but that the main difference between them."
GameDeals,3e3abo,ChillingOnTheCouch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"Be aware that it still does not contain all of the features for Homeworld 1, a lot of fans are very displeased with this.  Maybe someone that actually owns the game can elaborate here."
GameDeals,3e3amq,SuperMoonky,7,Tue Jul 21 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"This is a great little arcade experience. I have heard some comparisons to Hotline Miami, and I think that is pretty fair, except enemies are pretty set (IIRC some enemies would change patterns or slightly change location on retries in Hotline). It can get pretty tough, but it is always, fair, fast, and fun.  The characters all stand apart from each other (though, I think the best one is absolutely the guy with crazy speed, silent kills, and a double barrel). Enemy variety feels good, and the pacing is solid.  I am on the last level with around 7 hours put in (some of my play was offline so im not sure how accurate that is). I have unlocked all characters and seen 1 secret level. (just trying to help gauge replay and longevity for people)"

GameDeals,3e3amq,Danake,5,Tue Jul 21 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"Very much so.

GameDeals,3e3a6u,SuperMoonky,8,Tue Jul 21 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"Man, I really want to like this game but it is just so serious and grim that I really can't maintain any interest in it.  I loved both seasons of the Walking Dead as well as The Wolf Among Us. They were all great because you get invested in your character, your story, and you get to really care about the little choices that you make that shape your relationships with the other characters.  Game of Thrones has you jumping between four different characters each episode and with the wait between episodes I am finding it very easy to totally lose track of many of the side NPCs that you are supposed to have relationships with. There are so many player characters that I just really stopped caring."
GameDeals,3e3a6u,evilsearat,5,Tue Jul 21 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"This is good to know. I loved Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, and I love the HBO show, but I'm sure I can wait till all the episodes are out and inevitably goes even cheaper in another steam sale..."
GameDeals,3e3a6u,rmill3r,3,Tue Jul 21 18:16:05 2015 UTC,Do you think it's easier to enjoy the game if you buy all 5 episodes at once and play them all in a week?
GameDeals,3e3a6u,greendaze,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:16 2015 UTC,It might be. But I had access to 4 episodes when I purchased it during the last sale and I have yet to get through episode 3. I just find it really humorless but maybe if you had like a good 6 hour chunk to power through a few episodes it could be engaging.
GameDeals,3e3a6u,evilsearat,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"the wait between episodes I am finding it very easy to totally lose track of many of the side NPCs that you are supposed to have relationships with   I think that's the biggest problem with these games. I've learned my lesson to never buy 1-2 episodes in - always wait for it to be completed, because by that time it drops in price too."
GameDeals,3e3a6u,unexpectedconspiracy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'd say its pretty similar to the books then. 😂"
GameDeals,3e3a6u,Nielheim,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:38 2015 UTC,I haven't watched season 5 of game of thrones yet or read that far in the books. How far into this game can I play without spoilers? It looks like this new episode is set in season 5 based on the name.
GameDeals,3e3a6u,Crjjx,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:38 2015 UTC,The first four episodes occur around the same time as the end of season 3 and the Red Wedding.  I doubt they're going to skip so far ahead (or at all) with the most recent one.

GameDeals,3e3kvc,chrispy145,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:51 2015 UTC,"Funny enough I was thinking exactly the opposite. It is pretty common for a game to be in a bundle then the publisher organises dlc discounts with various retailers around the time of the bundle to persuade you to hand over a bit more cash.  It is actually a quite clever strategy as you often walk away happy but having spent more money than you might of done if you hadn't got it in a bundle.   HB end up happy as they get plenty of money from the bundle. The retailers walk away happy as they made extra sales and the publisher gets a cut of both.  It would be actually pretty crappy of them to push for the dlc to go on sale knowing people would buy it to go with their bundle purchase, then shove it in there. It has been done before but generally people get very cross about it."
GameDeals,3e1yty,exosyphen,6,Tue Jul 21 09:43:55 2015 UTC,"I really did not like this game at all. I felt like the level design was very bad. The concept of only being able to see obstacles from the magic world only within a small area on the screen just seems like a really bad game design choice. It's like if you played Guacamelee and instead of switching between the two worlds full screen, you can switch between the two worlds but only within a small area. Also, because of this mechanic, there are LOTS of blind jumps. You have to either memorize where a platform or hazard is, that you can not see, or sometimes you just jump and try to hope for the best. I was wanting to like this game because I felt like it was trying to be a puzzle platformer like Braid, but I really hated it and could not continue playing the game after so long."
GameDeals,3e1yty,stafax,2,Tue Jul 21 10:13:39 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, I really enjoyed this game. I would disagree with the blind jumps. There are some, yeah, but only being able to see a small distance in front of you is sorta the point of the game. Most of the time you're given just enough time to react to what is in front of you if you're switching between the lights quick enough, and on top of that, what is in front of you is likely to be in a pretty predictable pattern as well. It's meant to be played by people who are able to react quickly. My only complaint was that the game had some pretty bad lag issues, but thanks to the frequent checkpoints, that can be solved pretty easily by simply restarting the game.  I would recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of difficult puzzle platformers, with the emphasis being on platforming."

GameDeals,3dzxs2,rambopandabear,17,Tue Jul 21 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"Tony got another position within Amazon a while back (at least a year ago now?), and was replaced by Josh... who didn't end up being as active with the community."

GameDeals,3dzxs2,Gromowlad,20,Mon Jul 20 22:06:14 2015 UTC,Pro- comes with all dlc  Con- destroys the pacing of the original game. Mindlessly adds enemies like olives on a large pizza.
GameDeals,3dzxs2,Shatteredhawk,12,Tue Jul 21 01:55:53 2015 UTC,That... That's so fucking hilariously accurate.

GameDeals,3dzxs2,bigassginger,8,Tue Jul 21 16:42:56 2015 UTC,Should I start with the first Dark Souls?
GameDeals,3dzxs2,tripleblacktri,21,Mon Jul 20 23:26:45 2015 UTC,"I would say so, just because the original Dark Souls is amazing, and you don't wanna miss out on it.  But no, you don't have to! You can enjoy each story separately, they aren't directly related."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,Ryan7x,12,Mon Jul 20 23:46:11 2015 UTC,"I'd highly recommend it yes. Dark Souls is considered the better game by most, and you'll appreciate DS2's differences having played the first."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,cedear,5,Mon Jul 20 23:47:18 2015 UTC,Or not apprceiate them. ;)

GameDeals,3dzxs2,cedear,5,Tue Jul 21 06:23:57 2015 UTC,"Just a PSA that it does not port well for keyboard and mouse controls, definitely go with a gamepad for it."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,TheArgentineGreek,12,Tue Jul 21 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd suggest Dark Souls 2 because it is the easier game overall, and so you can realize how amazing dark souls 2 is. Then you can play Dark Souls and realize how FUCKING amazing it is and how superior it is to the 2nd in terms of level design and content."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,GreatWhiteToyShark,7,Tue Jul 21 01:26:10 2015 UTC,I actually agree. It's like watching the movie before reading the book.
GameDeals,3dzxs2,2030k,3,Tue Jul 21 01:41:24 2015 UTC,"there is just something to the dark souls 1 level design that seem so smooth, u can revisit all the places with the short cut that u unlock, it's just so well designed.   dark souls 2 didn't have that feeling, the fast travel system kind of replaced the need to be well designed."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,xKaelic,6,Tue Jul 21 04:22:32 2015 UTC,Only if you have a gamepad; keyboard and mouse controls in DS1 were terrible.

GameDeals,3dzxs2,TangyRaptor,5,Tue Jul 21 00:48:43 2015 UTC,I'll agree. I started a co-op playthrough with a friend with zero experience in the series and he didn't have a controller. After installing DSFix and DSMouseFix and rebinding keys he says it's definitely playable.
GameDeals,3dzxs2,bpm195,3,Tue Jul 21 04:45:49 2015 UTC,You can do it on a guitar too!  Still should get a controller though. It is the first pc game I've ever seen recommend a controller in the system requirements.
GameDeals,3dzxs2,Terminatorn,4,Tue Jul 21 05:29:12 2015 UTC,You don't need to. If you're concerned about lore or story or something. You'll spend more time dying than giving a sh*t about the story.

GameDeals,3dzxs2,about_60_Hobos,52,Tue Jul 21 03:31:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly you can skip Tomb Raider GOTY Edition and just get the normal Tomb Raider. Only one DLC is a very short tomb (about 5 minutes if that), the rest are multiplayer skins/weapons and a bunch of upgrades you can get by playing the main game.  That said Tomb Raider is fantastic and a great reboot, I am just sad the sequel is coming to Xbox One before other platforms :(  Other highlights for me include Max Payne 1 and 2 as well as both Monkey Island games."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,Kaerius,6,Mon Jul 20 22:40:36 2015 UTC,I agree about tomb raider.... I'm pretty sure that dlc only existed because someone in S/E did a face palm when asked so 'what is the tomb like in this one?'  I'd add fallout 3 GOTY & fallout NV Ultimate for 3.99€ from the German site is a pretty good deal for anyone.
GameDeals,3dzxs2,amohell,6,Mon Jul 20 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"And technically it wasn't even a real tomb. Still one of my favourite games of recent years, replayed it at least 4 times already."

GameDeals,3dzxs2,smarty2015,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Cheat Engining the story itself. I mainly meant experience and money.  As for that level. It's difficult. Have a scout or two take out the troops that are already on the map so you can focus on the tank. Have a shocktrooper on the map right away, just waiting. Have an engineer to repair the Edelweiss. Other than that, go for lancers. Use orders to increase accuracy so you don't miss the tank's guns. Getting those taken out ASAP is really the most important thing you can do on that level."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,delabro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like I know exactly how to beat it, and ice come really close with like one radiator left, its just that I could never seem to get the edelweiss into a position where it was safe enough for me to finish the mission.  I'll definitely go back to it since I loved the story and I think there's a new game+ and obviously all the skirmishes and challenges I missed out on."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,delabro,3,Tue Jul 21 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"I bought this but....argh..I don't know. I really like the atmosphere and gameplay but on the other hand I find the dialogue cringey as hell which may not be a huge deal to other, but definitely is for me. It actually stopped me from continuing because of how awkward I found the characters and how anime-ish they interacted with each other, which is unfortunate. However, I do recommend for anyone who hasn't played it to try it out at least since it's quite a unique game."

GameDeals,3dzxs2,gb2003,3,Tue Jul 21 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"It's one of the most in depth simulator's out there and it's actually very well made. If you're a die hard simulator enthusiast and want something a little more relaxing I'd give it a try. Personally though I had a hard time getting into it. At first, I thought it was the controls (the controls are a little confusing at first but they make sense overtime) but then after 10 minutes of readying my first field I realized that I just wanted to do something else. Don't let my personal opinion sway you though. There was probably a time I'd like a game like this but at the moment it's not my flavor. Many other simulator enthusiasts will tell you that it's one of the best simulator games to have come out in over a decade."
GameDeals,3dzxs2,azermyth,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be hit and miss with people buying it blind, but for what it is, it's a really good game, but some might find the simulation boring, others won't. It also helps the mod community is huge and you can get all kinds of vehicles a few maps, etc...  And in some ways it's a really nice looking game, most of the vehicles and tools look great and have nice little details, in other ways they uh...saved on their budget. I play it a lot with my kid who is tractor crazy and it's pretty fun and relaxing when he's not ramming me.  There is a pretty good amount of youtube content if you want to check it out in that way."

GameDeals,3e1p5w,bananabelle,4,Tue Jul 21 07:31:13 2015 UTC,"i've been playing the multiplayer of this game recently and while its pretty good, it's pretty repetitive or grindy after a while. I also tried the single player trial.  some thoughts:   there is a chance when being invited by a friend to their lobby for the game to freeze. there are a lot of errors when joining random groups.. for whatever reason there is often a lot of lag when playing multiplayer gearing up for new difficulties should be easier - right now you rely on RNG to get a OP item on a low difficulty to get to the next difficulty. the new difficulties are a bit too hard because enemies hit for a lot of damage - upgrading defenses requires you to grind for items to dismantle, which gives you parts to make defense upgrades. single player trial was okay, but I don't know if i'd pay full or even half price for it.  i'd like a bit smoother combat.   i'll continue playing multiplayer for a while, but might just quit pretty soon as I feel like the progress is a bit too slow."
GameDeals,3e1p5w,camguide2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:56 2015 UTC,Just a heads up: if you played the free trial and the bought the game you need to re-download the entire 24 gb of the retail version.

GameDeals,3e0v6b,maroddity,4,Tue Jul 21 03:21:24 2015 UTC,"It's a decent singleplayer game (no co-op, sadly), but it's nothing like the previous games. It has some multiplayer, but it's all PVP and I doubt anyone is still playing it.   I enjoyed it when I told myself to forget that it's a Lost Planet game. The soundtrack is good, very reminiscent of the Alien soundtrack, and the gameplay works fine. It's fun to use the mech (melee-only mech, no guns on it like there was on LP2), minus some of the quick time event junk that's thrown in, and the gunplay outside of the mech works fine.  It's nothing super special, pretty generic feeling third person shooter, but I'd say it's worth a go for around $5. Just keep in mind it's barely a Lost Planet game.  Edit: Side note, this is the lowest price the game has ever been on Steam. Well, $6.24 was the lowest it's ever been, but yeah, you probably won't see it any lower for a while."

GameDeals,3dyvcl,djdoublem3,21,Mon Jul 20 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"Like most of Zachtronics' games, TIS-100 is ultimately a game about engineering. You're given a problem to solve, and the tools by which to do it, then tasks you with finding the best solution(s). Unlike most puzzle games, there isn't a ""correct"" answer, although some answers are obviously better than others. This results in a game that alternates between extreme frustration as you try to find an answer to the problem at hand, and extreme satisfaction and pride when you actually find it.  It's also great if you have some friends who play, so you can compete with them. The game shows you histograms of each task to compare your results with everyone else who has completed it, and also has a friends leaderboard so you can see how well you did compared to your friends.  As per the ""programming"" aspect of this game, note that it's an extremely limited fictional architecture, so don't expect to learn actual assembly from the game. But the limitations make it interesting and fun."
GameDeals,3dyvcl,tgunter,5,Mon Jul 20 17:40:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly like Zachtronics. The guy puts a lot of effort into his games. Space Chem was ripped off by Sokobond. The Sokobond trailer even compares the game to Space Chem. Minecraft was even inspired by InfiniMiner and made Mojang a billion dollar company.  I really hope one of his games is able to take off.  EDIT: Sokobond didn't rip off Space Chem, just heavily inspired. But they quoted him in the trailer, so I kind of thought they were similar, they could be totally different games."
GameDeals,3dyvcl,Brandon23z,7,Tue Jul 21 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"Space Chem was ripped off by Sokobond.   Other than a very loose thematic connection, those two games are absolutely nothing alike. One is a programming/engineering game with open-ended solutions, the other is a variation on the classic game Sokoban with some mechanics based on merging and dividing the ""boxes"".   Minecraft was even inspired by InfiniMiner and made Mojang a billion dollar company.   Note that Zach doesn't feel like Notch owes him anything at all, because despite being the initial inspiration, Infiniminer and Minecraft are extremely different games, and Zach has stated that the things that made Minecraft popular and what it is are not something he would have arrived at had he been designing it.   I really hope one of his games is able to take off.   SpaceChem was a big hit for him, and did well enough that he was able to hire a full-time staff of 7 people for his next game, Ironclad Tactics. Ironclad Tactics was unfortunately a flop, so he downscaled and made Infinifactory and TIS-100, which he's said have been selling very well (and in the case of TIS-100, much better than he expected).  The bottom line is that Zach Barth makes smart, challenging games for smart people who like to be challenged, and that seems to be a niche that's served him fairly well, and one I hope he continues to explore."
GameDeals,3dyvcl,tgunter,2,Tue Jul 21 00:39:44 2015 UTC,"I wish Ironclad Tactics had ended up better than it did. I think they had a good idea but approached the design from the wrong direction.  Ironically, for a group of puzzle game developers, Ironclad Tactics was a too much of a puzzle game and not enough of a strategy/card game. I got really frustrated toward the end when the enemy was constantly starting out with a massive advantage over me in terms of resources and card power. There were some interesting choices when it came to crafting decks but the moment to moment gameplay felt stifling. I just sorta played what I drew without getting a feeling of really having choices."
GameDeals,3dyvcl,TheoryOfSomething,4,Tue Jul 21 05:20:04 2015 UTC,"This is a great game. A friend got me the game while it was on early access, and I had a ton of fun with it.  It's not your regular puzzle, it's pretty much like Scribblenauts, with programming. Needless to say, it's extremely frustrating at times, but really rewarding at the end. It is also a great way of tuning up your logical thinking, however not a good way of learning coding or improving your coding skills."
GameDeals,3dyvcl,shinjae,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"If you haven't played them, try out... well, most of Zachtronics' other games. Zach Barth has pretty much made a career out of games based on engineering solutions rather than finding the intended answer."
GameDeals,3dyvcl,tgunter,2,Mon Jul 20 19:22:35 2015 UTC,Do I really need a 2 GHz processor to play this? I would think that my crappy little atom processor could handle the graphics I've seen in the trailer. I will bite the bullet and get back to you if anyone is interested.
GameDeals,3dyvcl,RoryCalhoun,2,Tue Jul 21 09:49:57 2015 UTC,"I would think that my crappy little atom processor could handle the graphics I've seen in the trailer.   Graphics have minimal effect on the processor requirements of a game these days. That's typically handled by the GPU. If a game has high CPU requirements, it's because of the underlying model and not the graphics.  For example, Dwarf Fortress is literally just text, and graphically could run on a terminal from the '80s. Computationally however it'll take whatever CPU you can throw at it and ask for more.  In the case of TIS-100, I'm guessing that the 2 gHz requirement was a result of that being about the slowest CPU you can get these days, but maybe not. After all, it's running an interpreter for a fictional 12-core processor implemented in Unity. Some of the more complex solutions later in the game take a pretty long time to test."
GameDeals,3dyvcl,tgunter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"Is the story satisfying? Or is it just a line here and there, and puzzles are central?"

GameDeals,3dyvcl,SilentBunny,6,Mon Jul 20 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"The entire story of the game is maybe a few pages of text. Most of it is just a guy trying to figure out what this bizarre computer he found was made for, doled out a paragraph or two per puzzle, and a bit in the PDF manual. It's an entertaining addition to the game, but not going to contribute to whether you will like the game or not. The gameplay is very much the focus.  If a game that involves writing programs using an extremely unusual and restrictive computer architecture to solve problems appeals to you, pick up TIS-100. If you liked SpaceChem or Infinifactory, pick up TIS-100. If a brain-bending game that's more about solving problems than figuring out the solution the developer intended is appealing to you, pick up TIS-100. If a game that requires you to learn how it works on your own and won't hold your hand sounds interesting, pick up TIS-100.  If none of those things describe you, you might still consider giving it a try, because it's cheap and unique, but I make no promises that it'll be up your alley. It's a fantastic game, but its appeal is not universal."

GameDeals,3dyrn2,Johnny_Guano,8,Mon Jul 20 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"Depths of Fear Knossos is at a good price.  You fight/sneak/mostly run through various sections of a labyrinth that's filled with monsters  from Greek mythology.  The visuals are nice but very rough.  The soundtrack is great.  Be warned that the game is buggy, but for less than a dollar it's worth a try."

GameDeals,3dyrn2,mr_sombong,4,Mon Jul 20 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"It's not that good, that's why I mentioned that you ""mostly run"" through each generated maze.  Don't expect solid gameplay here.

It's my favourite kind of visual novel - it has several plotlines that you have to go through in order to unravel the mystery, so don't stop after just one. And the characters are all pretty adorable. I definitely recommend it to any other visual novel fans."
GameDeals,3dyrn2,pokeylopey,16,Mon Jul 20 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"Some highlights from me this week -  Mutant Mudds Deluxe - If you love retro style platformers then this is a great game, it's not too hard and has a clever mechanic involving switching the world to get to the foreground/background. Game has a ton of levels too (not very long but still).  Dyad - Visually this is just stunning, it's a racer and a work of art both at the same time.  Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey - Basically Scrabble with RPG elements, you have to type in words from letters given to you to do damage. As you get further into the game you might have specific things to do IE not have 3 letter words at all. Can be challenging and casual, I love this game whenever I use it to relax.  Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers - Brilliant puzzle platformer, in a way reminds me a little bit of Mario 64. You get ability to slice (fruit ninja style) parts of the level and can move them around sort of like the gravity gun from HL2. It's not super long but it's fun and nostalgic."
GameDeals,3dyrn2,baddog992,3,Mon Jul 20 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers   A great 3D physics-based platformer! I really enjoyed this game! Can't say there's much of a 'deep' plot, but the gameplay is what made me finish the game.   You can slice the terrain with laser, or attach a grappling hook to pull it towards you, or attach a rocket to make it fly away from you (you can control how far it flies). The terrains you interact with is physics-based; If you add too much momentum when moving an object, or cut too much, it could cause a domino effect which can lead to fucking yourself over. Also, in the later levels if you move things without thinking first you'll fuck yourself over, and might have to restart the level :(  Lots of achievements, rewards from exploring the levels, collectibles, and hidden in-game minigames. I fucked around a lot, and clocked in 9 hours by the end.   EDIT: Also, pretty sure I grabbed this game on Steam when it was $1. So $3 is kind of a meh deal."
GameDeals,3dyrn2,Johnny_Guano,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:09 2015 UTC,Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey   Is a very good word game. This is a good pick.

GameDeals,3dyrn2,popnfresh7000,10,Tue Jul 21 08:36:21 2015 UTC,"Empire: Total War - RTS set in the 18th century.  I'm a bit surprised to see it listed as a weekly deal.  It's a bit aged now, but one of the better games in the Total War series, I'd say.  If you're looking to get into the series, this is a good title at a decent price.  Contraption Maker - If you remember The Incredible Machine, you'll feel right at home with this game, developed by the same team in the same style.  Build complicated Rube Goldberg devices to solve puzzles.  Workshop allows for downloading of community-built puzzles and resources, too.  At this price, it's a must-have.  Cargo Commander - A procedural platformer with roguelike elements.  Enter an abandoned cargo container construct, avoid or shoot aliens, navigate through the interior to retrieve valuable cargo, escape before the construct falls apart and leaves you adrift in space.  There's not much to it, but I found it a pretty engaging game.  Geneforge Saga - Spiderweb RPG, which means tile-based Ultima 4-6 style classic RPGs with lots of text to read, character customization, well-developed worlds, and hidden secrets. There's one on sale almost every week on Steam, and they're all great value for old-school RPG aficionados.   Back to Bed - A puzzle game in which you guide a sleepwalker back to bed.  The surrealistic art style is a treat."

Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart-Tells a good solid story and looks great. A very fun game and its 80% off making it $2dollars. My average time finishing the game 6hours.  Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden 75% off making it $2.49 another solid game made by Artifex Mundi. This game takes place under water and has the bio shock feel of it. The game looks great and has an interesting story.   This 2 games are both solid if you like hidden object games.

The big draw is the 3D aspect, which is really cool in my opinion and something you don't tend to see in TD games, they're mostly just 2D. The other big draw for me is the co-op, not many TD games have that and games are always more fun with friends.  If you like TD games it's easily worth your dollar."

GameDeals,3dyrn2,TheCommieDuck,3,Mon Jul 20 21:49:16 2015 UTC,I like them for several reasons. My number one reason is that you do not need a guide or a walkthru online. In the old days you would need one if you wanted to complete an adventure game.   My other reason is some of them look great and also a lot of them have an interesting story to tell. They are easy to pick up and play. No need to look at a manual or go online for a FAQ about how to play.   So thats mainly why I enjoy them. The best are made by  Artifex Mundi the other publisher is Alanware  and they are mostly hit and some misses.

I bought my Wii U in a bundle for $250 on Black Friday 2013 and the bundles they have now still aren't really a better deal (the console has gone cheaper for sure, but not with the same amount of stuff).  I picked up a PS4 at launch but ended up selling it because there was just jack shit to play - and I was on the fence about which console to pick up but XB1 getting backwards compatibility of sorts is a big plus for me (plus I already have an XBOX Live year sub sitting around and an XB1 controller I'm using for my PC).

GameDeals,3dx9nj,solison1,29,Mon Jul 20 14:36:27 2015 UTC,"Highly recommend Dragonball Xenoverse, not only is it the first proper game to come to PC, the port is great and it lets you create your own character in a semi MMO style world.  There is so much to do, Story missions, Parallel Quests, Online/Offline Battles. The game can become repetitive after a while, but you can play how you want. You start by picking a race from either Saiyan, Namekian, Frieza Race (yes it's called that), Human or Majin, then you're thrown into the story which revolves around a mysterious pair distorting the timelines to change history and it's your job to put history right. If you got tired of the same old story mode in Dragonball games then this is a welcome change as it's you in the game fighting alongside Goku, Piccolo and the rest.  Story mode should take around 15-20 hours depending on your playstyle, but you also have the options to do Parallel Quests which are objective based missions set on a map (that may take you to different areas). I managed to sink in about 63 hours in total, though I can see others getting more/less time depending how much you enjoy doing the PQ's.  Game has a whole heap of characters too, you can train under Masters like Cell, Goku, Android 18, Piccolo and even Mr. Satan (or Hercule for the modern fans). This is a dream to play, I hope one day they manage to do a sequel but for now this is probably the best DragonBall game on PC.   As for DLC, you might find the price is too high to justify the content and I don't think it's really worth it. If you get the Bundle it's probably the cheapest way to get the DLC since some of it is less than an hour long and most of it is characters/items/moves.  In short, this is a great game for DragonBall fans."

The story and voice acting is easily the best out of the series and the first play through is very challenging. It's probably the standout sale today."

GameDeals,3dx9nj,Hoiafar,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:21 2015 UTC,The remastered version is much better than the original PC port. I have both and I can confirm that the remastered version fixed a lot of the bugs that plagued the original port (which was from the PS2 version IIRC)
GameDeals,3dx9nj,Johnny_Guano,3,Mon Jul 20 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"from re4 onward they're not like the classic ones so i wouldn't recommend them if you want something in that claasic 90's survival horror vein. that being said, 4 is fun! 5 isn't amazing but i've had a lot of fun playing it w/ a friend and chris redfield punching a rock were worth the purchase. as for 6..... well, it's been years and i still can't bring myself to finish that game so you decide what that means.  also definitely recommend playing re hd remastered (probably the best game in the whole series), re2 and the revelation ones which are surprisingly good."

GameDeals,3dx9nj,ag_android,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"For some reason I was thinking that RE4 was RE5 (it's Monday guys), and was surprised that so many people loved/recommended it as the best RE.  Then everything clicked, and yes, that makes sense, RE4 is awesome.  (Though, personally, my favorite in the series is the original RE Remake, so my personal recommendation would be Resident Evil HD Remaster. Can't go wrong with RE4 though.)"
GameDeals,3dx9nj,Thachiefs4lyf,4,Mon Jul 20 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"Whats the settlers like, assuming I love Age of Empires, LOTR battle for middle earth, etc"
GameDeals,3dx9nj,ag_android,6,Mon Jul 20 09:23:31 2015 UTC,"Settlers 6 is ok. It is not a pure RTS like Age of Empires.  It is kind of like a hybrid city builder with a little bit of RTS elements. You will have to keep your settlers happy by providing food, clothing, entertainment,etc. You cannot control settlers directly.  The armies are a bit like LOTR Battle for Middle Earth, because you will be controlling squads. Unlike BFME however, dead soldiers do not respawn over time, and you have to take the squad back to the military buildings to recruit replacements, which is kind of realistic, but its a real pain if the building is half way across the map. Soldiers can control/capture siege weapons. Knights (heroes) have special abilities, and are also essential to complete quests."
GameDeals,3dx9nj,EatsLEGO,4,Mon Jul 20 09:56:43 2015 UTC,Do you know how good 7 is? It's got a higher average score but it's got mixed reviews on Steam because of UPlay. But I've never had any problems with Uplay so I feel safe in risking that.
GameDeals,3dx9nj,EatsLEGO,6,Mon Jul 20 12:31:06 2015 UTC,It's good. The graphics engine is beautiful. The game is relaxing (in a good way) ... not super challenging. The big complaint was the DRM - you must always be online apparently.

GameDeals,3dx9nj,VirtuosusFFXI,4,Mon Jul 20 10:52:17 2015 UTC,"Well kind of. The buildings work similar to those in Stronghold, but IIRC, that game allowed you to control soldiers individually and all you needed to keep the citizens happy was, to provide food and keep the tax rate low. Settlers need food, lodging, clothing, etc and is more fun to manage. Also, I think Stronghold only let you place buildings around the keep, this limitation is not present in Settlers.  It is only the battles that make Stronghold better than Settlers."

GameDeals,3dx9nj,WhyIsMyCoffeeCold,4,Mon Jul 20 13:05:11 2015 UTC,I find Seinfeld hysterical. But it's a documented effect where because something invented common tropes it looks bad in retrospect.  I should clarify that documented means a TVtropes article
GameDeals,3dx9nj,aastle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:25:32 2015 UTC,One of my favorite games of all time. I still go back regularly and replay it. If you like dead space you won't be disappointed.

Which is the more appropriate aphorism here?    ""He who hesitates is lost."" (As in, the current discount could potentially end before the event sale, making now a better time to buy) ""Good things come to those who wait."" (As in, the current discount is safe for the duration of the event sale, but it might get a steeper discount as a flash deal)"

So if you see the game you want in the flash sale then you should get it because it won't be going any cheaper. If you wait for your game to go into a flash sale and it doesn't happen, you won't have lost anything as long as you buy it before the sale ends on Sunday night. Back to Watch_Dogs - that bad boy gets a flash sale on Saturday as well as it's Season Pass and Deluxe Edition."

GameDeals,3dy4tq,wjousts,5,Mon Jul 20 20:31:28 2015 UTC,It is extra work but there are folks out there who are only interested in games that have cards. Cards are a big deal for lots of folks so not including them only means less sales :/.
GameDeals,3dy4tq,Cjcomplex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"They're not necessarily a selling point for me, but in the age of video game oversaturation you really do have to try and play every angle to get people interested.  I wonder if there's any real reason people opt not to include Steam cards.  On the programming end, I doubt you have to do anything - it's just Steams ability to track how long you've been playing that unlocks them.  Is providing like five art squares really all that's preventing people from including cards?  Never really thought about it before."
GameDeals,3dy4tq,Dlgredael,6,Mon Jul 20 16:58:50 2015 UTC,Some really small devs don't like that their games are becoming little more than fodder that people use to collect the cards.

GameDeals,3dy4tq,youareawesome,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"You're not missing much with the censored version unless you're deaf. The uncut version adds subtitles. There's basically two more scenes iirc: a mildly adult one & a nightmare that reveals a bit more about the character.  Culpa Innata is pretty long, around 20 hours if you really enjoy it, so don't let those missing scenes deter you."
GameDeals,3dy4tq,Gigglemoo,4,Mon Jul 20 18:09:36 2015 UTC,I really really need subtitles even as a non deaf person. Especially with a game that involves so much text and voice acting that's 20 hours long. I watch and play every movie/game using subtitles so I make sure I don't miss any lines.   Where exactly are the subtitles lacking? All cutscenes?
GameDeals,3dy4tq,freedomtacos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"Everything but cutscenes, actually.  There's a ""subtitles"" option in the menu of the censored version, but it only adds them to cutscenes.  Everything else is voice-only."

GameDeals,3dy4tq,bundlestars,5,Tue Jul 21 08:06:00 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that Steam uses the censored version of Culpa Innata.  The main differences are a missing scene or two and the lack of subtitles outside of cutscenes (which were added in the uncensored release but for some reason never patched into the censored one).

GameDeals,3dy4tq,jeun_jie,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:36 2015 UTC,Not really. Mostly an average bunch of hidden object games. I played the first weird park and while it was ok it was not great. Mostly due to a lack of animation on the games part.   Another example the Pharaoh game. It was supposed to be a sequel of games that told a story however since they dont have all the parts you dont get the complete story at the end of it. Not saying these are bad but I would consider them to be average. Artifex Mundi makes the best hidden object games in my opinion.     Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart is on sale for $2 dollars(80% off). A very good looking and very well done hidden object game.

This game straddles a wobbly line between realism and fun, not always succeeding but in my mind it should be praised and played for trying to do something different with a very restricted genre and setting. Closest I've come to ""shitting a brick"" in FPS gaming is the 5th level of this one. Dragon Rising is the older entry and has been modded amazingly but is very light on plot and direction.  Rise of the Argonauts is basically Mass Effect set in Ancient Greece. Fans of mythology will enjoy this mixing of Aegean history and legend and some jokes/references look like they're there JUST for the real classicists. The combat isn't complicated but feels satisfying throughout. The world is, uh, very colourful so don't expect the grey feel of say Warriors: Legends of Troy or Spartan: Total Warrior. Also this game will run on pretty much anything thanks to the developers including a 'low spec' mode for people with 2008 integrated graphics. Lots to enjoy here if you can stand the slightly cheesy dialogue and blindingly over-done environments."

GameDeals,3dydnm,_BreakingGood_,-2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:10 2015 UTC,It could be because I upgraded my GPU ... but I'm loving this game. I haven't experienced any probs at all. A lot of cheap Nvidia codes out there too.
GameDeals,3dydnm,Johnny_Guano,4,Mon Jul 20 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"this deal is the console version but I agree that the PC version should as bad as the game is, be bought now becasue it can be had as low as 18 bucks from NVIDIA codes. I pre-loaded mine and you cant really regret $18.95. Ill play it when its in better shape"
GameDeals,3dydnm,zaviex,0,Mon Jul 20 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"What problems did you have? I wonder what the deal is exactly.  Some people have problems running it, even on high end systems, and some people don't."
GameDeals,3dydnm,Johnny_Guano,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:34 2015 UTC,It seems like high-end nvidia systems run it fine. High-end AMD and mid-range anything have difficulty running it at 30fps.
GameDeals,3dxrvd,xiloto91,19,Mon Jul 20 12:17:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think people really play the original Guild Wars anymore, so you'd probably have to do all the missions with henchman.  I'd still prefer Prophecies and Factions over Guild Wars 2 if people still played."
GameDeals,3dxrvd,baconbroth,12,Mon Jul 20 13:20:43 2015 UTC,Everyone that I know that played Guild Wars 1 and 2 think Guild Wars 1 was better.  Guild Wars 2 felt a bit like WoW to me.  I still played like 3-4k hours on it though.  I think I farmed over 10k hours on Guild Wars 1 though.  Guild Wars 1 had a lot of unique things that people enjoyed: henchman/heroes and a low level cap (making it feel more skill based at later missions).
GameDeals,3dxrvd,oYUIo,6,Mon Jul 20 15:15:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, GW2 just couldn't emulate the feel of Cooperative Missions in GW1 for me, which was my favorite part of GW1."
GameDeals,3dxrvd,baconbroth,7,Mon Jul 20 15:37:41 2015 UTC,I think they made a mistake not going with the typical trinity style for RPGs. The dungeons I tempted in GW2 just seemed like complete chaos.
GameDeals,3dxrvd,BreezyBay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"I think they couldve gone with a trinity-type system and that would've worked better, although I would have hated it. But GW1 didn't have true tanking abilities and that system felt better than GW2 in a lot of ways to me.  Ultimately I think the execution failed in 2 key areas. 1) They didn't give players enough ways to mitigate damage through skillful play. 2) They didn't develop enough abilities and corresponding feedback to allow players to cooperate effectively.  If you ever played WvW in a tight group, you know that 5-10 people can totally wipe a zerg of 30. What you need is a tight coordination of abilities to mitigate lots of damage and deal lots of damage in a short window. But that really wasn't possible if you weren't communicating by voice because the visual and audio feedback in the game was insufficient. And due to long cooldowns and short buff duration you couldn't pull that off over a 10 or 15 minute spread like you would need to to make a meaningful PvE boss encounter.  Complete chaos is pretty lame, but GW1 was a kind of controlled chaos. It is much more fluid than the trinity system. GW2 felt like it removed all the tools for controlling the chaos and everything became a damage race."

GameDeals,3dxrvd,_BreakingGood_,3,Tue Jul 21 05:49:34 2015 UTC,I was really disappointed with how the story missions never captured me like the co-op mission in GW1. I'm not sure if it was the mission design itself or the fact that when the world became open you lost the connection between where you were and what your characters were doing in the story. But something was missing.
GameDeals,3dxrvd,TheoryOfSomething,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:37:00 2015 UTC,I agree very much. The stories were all very dull and boring compared to GW1 and even factions.
GameDeals,3dxrvd,baddog992,3,Tue Jul 21 08:34:48 2015 UTC,"My favourite was dual professions and what that meant for PvP versatility. PvP was awesome in GW1.   Oh and there were actually like you know, fucking Wars with Guilds..."

GameDeals,3dxrvd,JustFinishedBSG,4,Tue Jul 21 07:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I played the original for years, so much better than that wannabe Guild Wars 2.  I've heard some people still play, but I'm not sure. I mostly did my missions with Heroes anyways, but sometimes you just need other players to beat them."
GameDeals,3dxrvd,Musta_Klaki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:41 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought Prophecies was throughly a slog. It's long, difficult to solo with heroes on a first play through, and many of the missions are boring. Eye of the North was so much better than anything in Prophecies, it's not even funny; I spent most of my Guild Wars playtime there.  I'll also be the weirdo who loves Guild Wars 2, although I could do without the jumping puzzles."
GameDeals,3dxrvd,Frem,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"I was a Protector of Tyria, but I played GW1 during its prime when there were so many players.  I did not use henchmen or heroes for a single mission because it was so easy to find parties.  To me, GW2 feels like a huge MMO world that just feels so single-player."
GameDeals,3dxrvd,baconbroth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, that'd probably explain it. I only played Guild Wars around 2008-2009 and often times there weren't many people around to party with in Prophecies, especially in the missions around the middle of the campaign.  EotN was where the player population seemed to like to hang out. I have a much easier time find people to play with in GW2 now than I did back in Prophecies."

GameDeals,3dxbod,godprobe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:24 2015 UTC,Fixed it! /u/GMG-PlayfireCS might want to update the live feed though.  EDIT: I just realised that the X-Files theme I linked wasn't the one I was thinking it was :( - but now I've fixed that too!
GameDeals,3dxbod,Paaaul,7,Mon Jul 20 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is definitely worth it, great 4x space RTS with massive fleet battles. Star Trek and Star Wars mods supposedly make it even more fun, although I've only played the base game. With such a low price you can't go wrong with it if you like RTS games in the slightest."
GameDeals,3dxbod,Donham,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:53:18 2015 UTC,"I have a few questions over Sins of a Solar Empire. The only other 4x games I've played are the Civilization series. Is Sins like Civ? If it isn't, is it difficult to learn?"
GameDeals,3dxbod,Contra_Payne,3,Mon Jul 20 16:56:30 2015 UTC,It's all in real time but with some classic 4X management. I highly recommend it if you're an RTS and 4X fan! I second the recommendation for total conversion mods - I've played a couple of the Star Wars ones which are great. Also this is an all time low I believe for the game with 20% voucher!

GameDeals,3dxbod,Haemastamen,2,Mon Jul 20 11:09:48 2015 UTC,"i think you could have fun maybe kinda sorta if you just play the free play mode, but youll need to find a tutorial or something. but if youve played x3/etc the free play mode will feel severely limited  but basically avoid the single player campaign, its basically offensive in its awfulness"

GameDeals,3dxbod,gubruikertje,2,Mon Jul 20 09:34:01 2015 UTC,Thanks GMG. I realized I had GMG credit to buy something (Had to fork out a few cents myself b/c you can't use a voucher with credit though)  Awesome deals!
GameDeals,3dxbod,niky45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:12:57 2015 UTC,Ditto. Got X: Rebirth CE (have read that it's much improved since the awful launch) and The Last Federation through credit + $7.50 as both were on my wishlist for the trading cards.  Great deals.

GameDeals,3dxbod,Tarheb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:59 2015 UTC,I know it is but 40€ is just too much for my little wallet
GameDeals,3dxbod,aylmerrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"it was released in may and I've already seen it at 33% off.   I'd say it will probably get back to the old 40% off in the winter sale, maybe with a bit of luck it will be in GMG with the extra 20% voucher... but that's about it in a short time."
GameDeals,3dxbod,Hllnflms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"Oh may this year? i had no idea, it didn't even occur to me that the price would be this high because it just left early access.. well guess i'll wait then"
GameDeals,3dxbod,draconian009,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"actually, on April 27th. I knew it was quite soon before June's summer sale ('cause it got a 25% off discount by then).  I had read many times that the devs said (LONG before release) that the price would slowly but steadily rise 'till release... and that's what they've done.   my guess is it will come back at the standard 40% off by the winter sale... but it won't be the same as before since the base price is quite higher (hell, I got it a long time ago for 12€ - around $15, at GMG, back when the coupon still stacked with the sale)"
GameDeals,3dxbod,scrid2000,2,Mon Jul 20 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"well i'll wait then, thanks for clearing this up for me"

GameDeals,3dx17i,Endyo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:50:55 2015 UTC,Just got a 2DS so this is nice.  I've been trying to pick up some cool old DS games as well but it seems they're a little rarer than they should be so the price is often higher than a new 3DS game for a used boxless DS cartridge.  At least there are still 3DS sales for new games.

Can we just remove this stupid deals, there is lot of spam and allow post only really good deals?"
GameDeals,3dvxmx,CantWashABaby,3,Sun Jul 19 23:52:17 2015 UTC,Seems like the only reason for this discount is to boost up the initial sales. Technically it isn't even a discount since the game hasn't been priced before now.
GameDeals,3dvxmx,AlbinoWyvern,3,Mon Jul 20 11:50:32 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone, I'm the community manager of Forge Reply, the devs behind In Space We Brawl. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions! :)"
GameDeals,3dvxmx,Mugoman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:19:10 2015 UTC,What's up with the colour palette? I understand that the days of BROWN NEXT GEN are behind us but the game is offputtingly bright and colourful. The screenshots at least just make it look messy.
GameDeals,3dvxmx,blastcage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"Hi,  it's bright and colourful indeed! We went for full saturation for the 4 basic colours to let the players easily find their spaceships in the heat of the action. We won't say it's messy though. :)  That said, In Space We Brawl is all about fun, action, speed and fun again. We think that our colour palette reflects this well, but we can give you that this isn't the right game if you're looking for a relaxing and contemplative evening.  Thanks for asking!"
GameDeals,3dvxmx,Mugoman,2,Mon Jul 20 14:55:55 2015 UTC,"Had a ton of fun with this on the PS4, was a little surprised to see it on Steam. There's no online multiplayer yet, only ""couch"" (everyone sharing the same screen).   Still, it's surprisingly fun and has a good amount of variety in ships and weapons. Get drinks, controllers and friends on a Tuesday night and it's hilarious havoc."

GameDeals,3dvxmx,FantasticFranco,-12,Mon Jul 20 08:40:21 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think 10% off is a deal."
GameDeals,3dvxmx,pickle182,8,Mon Jul 20 01:42:55 2015 UTC,The game is discounted on launch day and you're complaining.
GameDeals,3dvxmx,blastcage,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:42:29 2015 UTC,What isn't discounted on Steam at launch day? This is unremarkable.
GameDeals,3dvxmx,qefbuo,-2,Mon Jul 20 05:31:07 2015 UTC,"Fair point except if it's discounted on launch day there's no price history to discount so price hasn't gone down, so not technically a discount.."
GameDeals,3dvxmx,icewalker45,2,Mon Jul 20 08:42:21 2015 UTC,you aren't a deal. also this is launch.
GameDeals,3dvxmx,CatAstrophy11,-2,Mon Jul 20 04:20:05 2015 UTC,Is this Silent Death Online basically? Cause I would pay $100 to play that again.
GameDeals,3dvxmx,TrannyTooth,0,Mon Jul 20 07:58:04 2015 UTC,"Just checked Silent Death Online. A lot of similarities, except the customization is less intricate. And I kind of love the Tyrian vibe I get from SDO. It's definitely not the exact same cup of tea, but it's the closest modern arena you'll find and, hey, eight bucks."
GameDeals,3dujne,thinkforaminute,129,Sun Jul 19 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"Middle School me would have loved this. I used to play the first Stick RPG all the time after school. I never knew it got a sequel, maybe I will pick it up for nostalgia."
GameDeals,3dujne,Herculefreezystar,52,Sun Jul 19 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"Stick rpg 2, especially with the directors cut, has a surprising amount of content compared to stick rpg 1. Really fun game, I would recommend it to anyone who liked the first one.  Also, you can test out the non-director's cut version for free on xgen if you're curious!"
GameDeals,3dujne,prometheii,26,Sun Jul 19 17:54:24 2015 UTC,"According to the reviews ~90% of the game is free online, so maybe play it first and see if you want to drop $4 on the extra content"
GameDeals,3dujne,ShinDigpay,15,Sun Jul 19 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"Just bought it. Played it for a few hours. I think the extra content did make it a bit more fun, but I could never justify buying this full price."

I can remember when the developer claimed it was going to be ported to the gamecube, and I remember playing all of the demos for the second game. This is like a giant nostalgic slap in the face."

GameDeals,3dujne,tonedtone,2,Sun Jul 19 20:30:46 2015 UTC,I never knew it was on steam!
GameDeals,3dujne,KibbyJimenez,17,Sun Jul 19 22:19:30 2015 UTC,Can anyone comment on how good this is for someone that doesn't know anything about the stick figure games?
GameDeals,3dujne,supersonic159,8,Sun Jul 19 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"It's pretty fun. It's simplistic but has a lot to offer. It's not an empty game, it's just a simple one. The mechanics are small enough to be learned instantly, while still offering enough to do to be addicting for a few hours.  Then there's the larger point of contention.  If you're cool with spending $4 on what is almost entirely free online, and has its predecessor free online, then go ahead and buy it. If you hate RPGs where you start from the bottom and go up then you're kinda dumb for buying this but otherwise you should enjoy it. It's pretty satisfying going from minimum wage slave to CEO of something. And also going from fist fights, to bats, to guns, to lasers. I haven't gotten to the end though so there's still more for me even."
GameDeals,3dujne,Watertor,7,Sun Jul 19 22:13:28 2015 UTC,Damn good.
GameDeals,3dujne,scredeye,5,Sun Jul 19 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"Play it here for free first, this is a the directors cut or whatever so it has more stuff, but from what I hear it's not that amazing."
GameDeals,3dujne,Exexexpat,14,Sun Jul 19 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for the second one, but 2nd grade me loved the first one. It's an RPG closer to the original sense, in that you wake up as a stick man, and choose which stats to boost and which activities to peruse to get rich. You could climb the corporate ladder and attend school, or drink at he bar and be a drug dealer. The world wasn't crazy big, but for someone that only had a few PS2 titles and runescape to compare it to, it was certainly a really cool experience in a time when flash games were still really relevant. I mean, it was pretty easy to game the stock market and the soundtrack might as well be limp bizkit for how early 2000's it is, but it's a fun experience. My understanding is that 2 is more of the first."
GameDeals,3dujne,PotatoRain,8,Sun Jul 19 20:24:19 2015 UTC,I used to absolutely love Stick RPG in middle school. How different is it in this one? Is it better? Is it bigger in terms of content?
GameDeals,3dujne,bman1394,5,Sun Jul 19 19:38:05 2015 UTC,Tons of content. Buy it. You won't regret it.
GameDeals,3dujne,stapler8,6,Sun Jul 19 19:55:54 2015 UTC,I was a huge xgen forums member for several years in the hype leading up to the release of this game. Even got some guide threads stickied. Glad to see the game is still getting attention

GameDeals,3dujne,Ciahcfari,4,Mon Jul 20 15:54:49 2015 UTC,"I bought it to pay tribute to the amount of enjoyment the original gave me. I actually played the online version of this at release and while it was enjoyable it couldn't capture the magic that that simplistic, tiny 3 block map did to my 8 year old self. Lots of memories."
GameDeals,3dujne,BrotatoCake,4,Sun Jul 19 23:49:38 2015 UTC,"This game is the fucking bomb-diggity, especially if you're sitting in the back of that class you hate on your laptop trying to kill time. A+"

GameDeals,3duz20,Trenchcoatbeard,6,Sun Jul 19 19:17:29 2015 UTC,A couple comments say that it comes with a Steam code.

GameDeals,3duz20,Adahn_The_Nameless,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:39:14 2015 UTC,"Haven't quite gotten into it yet, but if you don't know, the main multiplayer is more like co-op campaign, playing through the main campaign, not some cheap add on. There's also multiplayer where you can play as either a zombie or human."
GameDeals,3duz20,five_of_five,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:13:26 2015 UTC,"The co-op campaign is fun, its the full campaign.  Its a little annoying because you can only talk to someone if everyone is there.  You can lock your game down so its friends only who can join if you dont want strangers.  The voice chat is actually really good, they apply voice effects to you based on your surroundings, so a small indoor concrete area will have a slight echo, etc.  There is an option where people can ""invade"" your multiplayer games and play as one of the hunters and you have to fight them off, but that is able to be tuned in the options as to how often it happens (if at all)"
GameDeals,3duz20,eviltuna,2,Mon Jul 20 08:26:02 2015 UTC,Thanks. Had a $5 reward certificate and a $5 gift card for being my birthday this month so final price was $15.

GameDeals,3dtwt8,shyguy528,12,Mon Jul 20 01:14:09 2015 UTC,"Be prepared to turn right around and spend $40 on DLC that Bungie refers to as ""Expansions"" that last about 2 hours a week, and another 'expansion' is incoming in September.  Their lead dev was also a major prick during a recent interview and kept saying ""you'll literally be throwing money at the screen when you see the emotes in the GoTY edition"", and much more."
GameDeals,3dtwt8,CheapNoodle,2,Sun Jul 19 13:04:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, key point here is ""Pay now to pay later"" if you buy this ""on sale"" and are forced to drop another $40 for the expac or ""pay later"" and get the whole game then.  Buying Destiny before Taken King is a ripoff because you need to buy all the umpteen DLC to play the game on pvp.  It's not a bad game, but the DLC plan borders on extortion. The game just isn't finished out of the box."
GameDeals,3dtwt8,BigRonnieRon,-3,Mon Jul 20 02:50:00 2015 UTC,"It was the collectors edition, and I believe he came out and basically said ""I'm not good at being on camera, sorry I came off as a cunt."" And what they also said was these are actual expansions, not just add on packs, so instead of a few new maps, its entire new areas and new storylines. Up to people to decide if its worth it, but if you're going to bash, at least do some research, yo."
GameDeals,3dtwt8,Satanicapplesauce,10,Sun Jul 19 14:50:22 2015 UTC,"Fuck him, guy was a complete fucking douche nozzle, that's a bullshit excuse. He was so conceited I was expecting him to rip off the mask and reveal himself as Mitt Romney.  lmao, and no, the first DLC is just a raid that takes 1 hour to complete and the second DLC is the obligatory shitty arena DLC that every flavor of the month game gets in a DLC cycle that no one ever likes.  I have done fucking research, I have 200 hours in the game and beat the arena the second day it was out, was one of the first to do it due to fully upgraded Gally strat with fuckloads of ammo, but I regret buying the trashcan DLC and abandoned it 2 days later when I realized how god-awful it is, the literal only thing that kept me playing as much as it did was playing with friends, although I had only bought the game 4 weeks before that.  Literally everything Bungie has done shows how fucking full of themselves they are now, including the audacity of referring to all their shitfest DLC's as ""expansions"".  And I'm sure the new DLC will just use the same fucking area's we've already been to, as in going through a known area to get to a 'new' area that isn't that big.  It's not an expansion unless it's a new planet, or even completely new areas on previous planets, but we know they won't do that. I abandoned it just like literally every single other person I know, over 40 players.  Need I fucking mention that Bungie blatantly lied to everyone about what the second 'expansion' would have, they tricked so many people with their bait and switch, second dlc was supposed to be a major raid, instead it was the obligatory trashcan arena DLC every game gets."

GameDeals,3dtwt8,ThatParanoidPenguin,5,Sun Jul 19 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of hate about Destiny right now from people who seem to be serious Destiny players.    I picked it up about 3 weeks ago during some other sale and thought I would chime in for a non-serious opinion.  As someone who has 2 level 20's (the max before gear levels matter) and is not really concerned with hardcore raiding and optimal strategies; the game is fun.  The mechanics are tight, the shooting feels good, and the double jump is something that will probably stick around in other games.    Most of the hate right now is from a balancing patch and some weapons will change.  But I don't care about that.  I think it's fun to shoot guns at aliens.  Maybe when I get to max level I'll care, but after years of living through WoW nerfs I doubt it.  In the end, after the nerfs it is still fun to fly around and shoot things.  I don't have any expansions, and if I'm still playing in September (have to go back to work when school starts) I may pick them up for $60, maybe not.  Grinding gear may take a bit, and if not I'll start another character.    If I can get 200 hours from $20 for Destiny I will call that a win.  I've played over 20 hours already and every hour has been fun.  So that meets the $1/hour many people seem to have.    If you're just looking to have some fun shooting space monsters, Destiny is that.  The story sucks and people rarely talk online (my two biggest complaints), but I'm having fun."
GameDeals,3dtwt8,MadAnthonyWayne,4,Sun Jul 19 21:33:49 2015 UTC,"I play the game, and it just isn't worth getting into right now, or maybe ever.  Let's talk story. There really isn't one unless you piece it together, and unfortunately they are leaning more and more towards the shitty ""omg, Twist!"" Story telling method that has unfortunately permeated the industry for the past ten years or so. The lore of the world is extensive, but you'll have to go to a website to find it and piece it together yourself. The main story with the past two expansions will probably take you a day to play through.   PvP is really bad at the moment due to balancing, and is about to get worse due to Bungie only really releasing a balance patch once every four or five months, and then the balancing seems to be somewhat arbitrary. (Example: one weapon class has dominated PvP content for a few months now, but it was in reality only the top tier guns from that weapon class (the exotics), and in reality only one of those was super stupidly OP. Bungie's response was to nerf ALL of that class of weapons, even though mid tier if that class worked well). Instead of incremental patching, testing, and adjustment,  they just kind of throw shit at the fan and see what sticks regardless. =/  Then there is pricing. For $80 USD, you can get the Uber edition which includes Destiny Vanilla, the first two ""expansions"", and the newest expansion that releases in September. It also includes a number of ""exclusives"".   Then there is the issue with the lead dev, who's just plainly a shit head. He was a community manager from the Halo days who someone decided was a good idea as a lead (Still trying to figure out that one but the only answer I can come up with is ""Gave blow jobs to someone at Activision).   Also, it really isn't Bungie so much as it is Activision-Bungie, and honestly it is more Activision than Bungie at this point. If you take a clear look, you can plainly see that the first two ""expansions"" were pretty well cut from the initial game and then resold as DLC (this isn't a new thing, just a continuation of a very bad trend). Also there are console exclusives and a really humorous but kind of shitty promotion going on with Red Bull that basically says ""Buy this Chuck Norris piss to get early access to a new mission!"" Also, if you can't pretty much devote several hours a week to the game, you're gonna have a bad time. The ""best"" weapons and gear all comes from random drops, and I mean really random.   Really, it is in a spiral to become Call of Destiny, and unless you like that kind of game and can devote a bit of time to it, it just isn't worth it. I only play because people I know play it, and more than likely will stop even then once the next expansion comes out."

GameDeals,3dqyzq,EjaculationStorm,17,Sat Jul 18 23:39:21 2015 UTC,"TrackIR (and homemade equivalents) is a peripheral that tracks the movement of your head and translates it to camera movement in games. It's mostly used in simulation-type games like flight/driving sims and Arma, where it's more immersive and improves your situational awareness.  Here's a video I have of it in use. All the camera movement here except the zoom is controlled by moving my head like I would in reality."
GameDeals,3dqyzq,Harakou,3,Sat Jul 18 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"So you move your head but keep your eyes focused on the screen directly ahead?  Is this difficult to do?  I feel like I need a video of someone using it, not just a screen record, to fully understand this. Off to youtube then.   *edit:  OK, that was cool as hell now I have to learn how to make one. Good to know that this camera is handy to use if you get the right version."
GameDeals,3dqyzq,awesome357,5,Sun Jul 19 03:57:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the video wasn't the greatest, sorry. I'm sure you saw but for others, basically a small turn of your head translates to a much larger camera movement. So looking at the screen isn't a problem."
GameDeals,3dqyzq,Harakou,2,Sun Jul 19 04:31:16 2015 UTC,Bingo.  I run a small outfit to provide the IR arrays (lights) that you use in conjunction with the camera (modified to see infrared light) and the free software FreeTrack or FaceTrackNoIR.  Come check us out!

GameDeals,3dqyzq,gmessad,5,Sun Jul 19 02:12:13 2015 UTC,"Er, not at all. If anything it reduces the need for huge resolutions. Honestly it's really hard to overstate how useful it is for these type of games. Why would you think that?"
GameDeals,3dqyzq,Harakou,3,Sun Jul 19 02:18:48 2015 UTC,"Not OP but the way that I think about it is if I only have one monitor and I turn my head, my head moves but my eyes kind of have to stay focused near the center of the screen, which could be difficult."
GameDeals,3dqyzq,Threemor,5,Sun Jul 19 04:51:56 2015 UTC,"Basically, you map a relatively small head movement to a large camera movement. In my profile, turning my head 15 degrees turns the camera 180 degrees around, for example; at most I'm moving from pointing my head at the center of my screen to the edge. So I don't really have much trouble, I just move my eyes a bit."

GameDeals,3dsrvw,Agamemnon314,47,Mon Jul 20 04:09:09 2015 UTC,"Just to let you guys know, the community for this game has declined sharply since launch. Whereas 9000 people, on the average, played this game in February, only 500 people, on the average, have  played this game in the past month. So, to put that in perspective, the game  currently has 6% of its average playerbase on launch (peak playerbase is 5% of what is was on launch).  I haven't played the final product (only the beta), and what I played was a mixed experience. When you got a good squad of hunters AND a smart monster, the game could be really fun, but any other time (as in, most of the time), the game became a stomp in favor of one party or the other.  I'm not sure why this game hasn't dropped in price more significantly, but for 30 bucks (only for the base game and not all of the silly DLC packs), you could definitely do a lot better."
GameDeals,3dsrvw,squidthesid,23,Sun Jul 19 02:51:59 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I assumed would happen and it depresses me.  We live in an age where way too many games come out and they're treated like flavor of the month multiplayer games (because most are).
GameDeals,3dsrvw,CheapNoodle,30,Sun Jul 19 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"It's the games fault, it launched on a terrible model.  $60 for the core got you about 30% of the game, then you needed to spend another $100 to get all the characters and maps etc. I was exited about evolve early in its development but when it's pricing model was announced I vowed never to purchase it.   The thing about these online only games is even when the goty edition eventually releases with all the content for $60 no one is left playing it so there is no point picking it up.    Good riddance in my opinion, my only regret is they didn't lose even more money."
GameDeals,3dsrvw,itsrumsey,-17,Sun Jul 19 09:12:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is incorrect. Other than cosmetics, none of Evolve's DLC was day one.   EDIT: It's factually true that, other than cosmetics, none of Evolve's DLC was day one. All of the maps were free, and all the paid character/monster DLC was released well after launch."
GameDeals,3dsrvw,devilmaydance,10,Sun Jul 19 12:40:06 2015 UTC,"Don't always trust your recollection.  I never said day 1 DLC, although there was over $100 of that (mostly cosmetic): http://www.gamespot.com/articles/evolve-launches-with-lots-and-lots-of-dlc/1100-6425237/    I was mostly referring to things like this: http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/13/7540627/evolve-turtle-rock-behemoth-season-pass    As you can see, this article is BEFORE Evolve even LAUNCHED and yet, its already extolling the details of new monsters, playable classes, etc.  This kind of shit is unacceptable to me, I don't need to know about the dozens or hundreds of dollars I'll have to spend if I want to use more than 50% of the games playable characters before the game has so much been played by the public.    I did say characters and maps which was wrong, but in my defense I put this rubbish game out of my mind when the articles about all the DLC started dropping pre launch."
GameDeals,3dsrvw,itsrumsey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the DLC details were officially made public like a month before launch. Even some journalists found them ridiculous.

GameDeals,3dsrvw,UtopianWarrior,-2,Sun Jul 19 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"I just feel like Evolve doesn't get a fair shake. It was marketed terribly, that can't be denied, but objectively it's far less worse than every other shooter that has come out.    No Day 1 DLC (other than cosmetics, which are the only things in that GameSpot article you linked)  All multiplayer maps free  People with the vanilla game can still play alongside those who purchased the extra characters and monsters, thus not fragmenting the community.  And unless we take Turtle Rock to be liars, none of the monsters or characters that were part of the season pass were finished development when the game launched, so the game was 100% when it initially launched.    I really don't see anything wrong with their DLC plan, I think their biggest folly was jumping the gun and announcing it all too early."
GameDeals,3dsrvw,devilmaydance,-3,Sun Jul 19 12:59:39 2015 UTC,"Uh, his recollection is right. You strongly implied Day 1 DLC with your ""%30 of the game"" comment when there were no characters to buy day 1 and maps have always been free. How do you even get close to %30 with cosmetics being the only launch DLC? And %50 of the games playable characters? Sorry, but you are no longer allowed to use percentages.  aaaaand looks like this subreddit has a huge circlejerk demographic when it comes to shitposting on evolve. pretty surprising as it is usually in the know enough to not be this wrong."
GameDeals,3dsrvw,fikkityfook,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:47:12 2015 UTC,"While I understand the sentiment and the launch certainly wasn't the most fluid one, it's important to realize that Evolve has been profitable and has been added to Take Two Interactive's permanent franchises so they definately see a future for it and it hasn't been killed."

Hopefully this will also make it easier for people of a similar skill level to play with each other, which I've said since before launch will be Evolve's biggest hurdle and I am very surprised they waited for this long.    I'd say on average most players, behavior wise, are above decent."

It's really more of the same - kind of like the AC games. There are no drastic changes that are going to win you over."

Might just be a low population problem though, maybe it's best to stick to Quake Live for now and wait for this to get out of Early Access."
GameDeals,3dr1dv,Looriruu,2,Sat Jul 18 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"I've been playing for a hundred hours or so, and I have to say that I've had a blast. Game's technically already finished, all it's missing is art, some gamemodes and polishing. The ""game feel"" is there, it's fast, it has immense amounts of depth and it's super fun. Definitely would get it now, you can always come back in the future if it's missing something you'd like to have."
GameDeals,3dr1dv,pereza0,2,Sat Jul 18 20:17:50 2015 UTC,Quake Live is more polished an a gentler introduction to Quake mechanics and this sort of games in general
GameDeals,3dr1dv,quae3Bah,28,Sat Jul 18 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"I would love Reflex to succeed, but I fear it doesn't stand a chance. Interest in arena shooters isn't big anymore to begin with, and the remaining player base is split up between Quake Live and the new UT, both f2p games. This is a niche game in a niche genre. Yes, there are a few people that sit in exactly this niche of a niche, but they won't be enough for a sufficient player base. And without that a multi-player game is worth nothing.  The fate of the indie multi-player game. The player base is too small, because people aren't buying the game, because the player base is too small. This sucks so much."
GameDeals,3dr1dv,pereza0,14,Sat Jul 18 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"Its basically CPMA. CPMA has had a playerbase for very long and will keep having it, even if it is through pickups and stuff.  And honestly, with one of the biggest competitive modes being duel a huge playerbase is not necessary at all to get some matches going.  I think it is still a bit too deep in Early Access to recommend. But saying ""don't play cuz dead"" is not really fair or helpful to an early access title"

It's basically Quake 3 with a new engine (which mean that the game looks better). If you are interested, I recommend you to try Quake Live at http://www.quakelive.com/ to see if you like the genre. It's also definitly a solid early access which will be finished, with developers ready to answer all your question at /r/Reflex.  If you wonder why it's important to make this niche of games survive, you can take a look at this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1HowpVX-hU"

GameDeals,3dr1dv,iQueQq,4,Sat Jul 18 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"I've played Reflex for some 70 hours so far. Easily gotten my money worth and I'll definitely keep playing it. The community is tiny but very dedicated. CPMA, which is the Quake 3 mod this game is based off was never the most popular but filled it's niche very well, and was highly respected by competitive players.  I'd still say it's a bit early for most people to pick the game up, but it seems that quite a lot of people know about it. So hoping things pan out, there could well be a smaller casual community later on, but it's not quite there yet (do note that many other arena shooters much further in development have much less players, like toxikk or ratz instagib). I live in Europe and can find ffa/duel games most of the time but it can be rougher for people living elsewhere.   I'd you're getting this game, do it for the long haul and supporting some very talented and dedicated devs. It's very playable, there are players and tournaments already, the engine and netcode is amazing. For the more casual players or someone not interested in a product full of place holders, hang on but keep a look out.  Plugging /r/reflex if you're more interested :)"

GameDeals,3dqybc,exosyphen,14,Sat Jul 18 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"I know there are so many free versions of this, but I got this in a bundle and it's really, really good. It has level progression so the difficulty ramps up as you kill time, and a limited number of lives to make it less instantly frustrating than Minesweeper when you make a mistake.  There's a 1-life classic mode for purists, and achievements to aim for if you like that sort of thing. Yes, it still turns into a guessing game at times, which is annoying. But if you enjoy Hexcells and can't be bothered with Minesweeper (or don't have it on your system), this is a good way to spend a dollar.   Oh, also it has trading cards. So you can get some of that dollar back too..."
GameDeals,3dqybc,cdeverett,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:04:48 2015 UTC,"I got it through a bundle and it's not awful (despite some more than questionable aesthetic choices), but I found Microsoft's free ""modern"" version of Minesweeper for Windows 8 and 10 far, far superior to this.

GameDeals,3dpzqd,arcticfox00,3,Sat Jul 18 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"it's cause all key sellers (possibly including steam itself, not sure EDIT thanks to /u/arcticfox00, we now know that Steam can't run out of keys) are only given ""X"" amount of keys to sell. Ya know how GMG will give you a batch of numbers and letters, which you can plug into Steam to redeem the game you just bought? That was one of their ""X"" keys, so they could have a bajillion and six more, or they could have 2 more. Some key seller sites will buy extra keys from other key seller sites (note, this isn't key RESELLING, which is gray market at best, think g2a for that sort of site), and sell those. That is how GreenManGaming got their Witcher 3 keys, as CDPR originally didn't give them any IIRC. This was why you didn't see GMG deals for a while here, the mods had to decide if GMG is legit, which it is.  So to sum up: yes, they can go out of stock, just like a brick-and-mortar store, and will have trouble getting more stock the same way a local Gamestop would on a Saturday afternoon."

GameDeals,3dpzqd,pil0tflame,4,Sat Jul 18 13:54:28 2015 UTC,"It's possible. GoG is steadily gaining ground and acceptance with publishers who have trouble wrapping their minds around the fact that consumers buy games while pirates don't, and their time and effort is better spent on the group that actually pays them.   With Humble Bundle also promoting DRM free games and making tons of money in the process, hopefully more publishers will come around, and we'll see even more games on GoG."

There's two separate titles for sale because each one was published by a different publsiher: 2K Games for Windows and Aspyr Media for Mac.

GameDeals,3dpzqd,cm2202,2,Sat Jul 18 12:26:32 2015 UTC,If you're in India it'll recognize your IP address and charge you in Rupees. Only way around it is using apps that allow you to hide your IP(Like Hola) but that's a little risky.  Make a note to compare all the prices to dollar values because some games are priced MUCH higher for India.

GameDeals,3dowfq,arseniquez,3,Sat Jul 18 15:05:00 2015 UTC,"For a full fledged game on the vita it's impressive, but compared to the steam or console versions it can't compare"

GameDeals,3doui1,SuperMoonky,5,Sat Jul 18 01:07:37 2015 UTC,Sips posted a video back in October covering this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrgYvc6i3U4  They have added a campaign now though.
GameDeals,3doui1,loldrums,3,Sat Jul 18 02:13:48 2015 UTC,"It's pretty fun!  Worth the price of admission, imo, but I find myself wishing for a little more depth or surprise.  For example, there are quite a few different star systems you can visit but there don't seem to be that many rare things to encounter or acquire that give incentive to explore much.  With the game's full release approaching the price has gone up.  This sale is actually a nickel more than you would have paid a couple days ago.  It is, however, cheaper than you will pay at launch."
GameDeals,3doui1,EmmEffer,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:12 2015 UTC,I find the battles rather tedious but I'm not too far in so maybe that changes with ship upgrades.
GameDeals,3doui1,Pattoner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:52:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah the upgrades make it super easy, and since the AI is rather....bad sometimes you can make so much credits/money with a few fights."
GameDeals,3doui1,climbatize,2,Sat Jul 18 15:16:50 2015 UTC,Looks like they raised the base price when they put the sale on..  Base price was $9.99 just a few days ago.  Just FYI.
GameDeals,3dp2qs,endustry1994,5,Sat Jul 18 02:22:51 2015 UTC,I got it for 20 bucks at target and I'm having a blast with the multiplayer.
GameDeals,3dp2qs,JohnRosen,2,Sat Jul 18 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here. Say what you will about cod, but it sure does make some fun multiplayer"
GameDeals,3dp2qs,eshrektpenis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:54:47 2015 UTC,How's the single player campaign? I just got done with the COD Ghosts campaign and it was nice but I found it a bit lacking in depth. It was too linear and felt like the game was always telling me how to play and what moves to do. Also found it to be a little short in length.  I'm hoping AW is much better. Is it worth dropping $30 if I am never gonna touch the multiplayer mode?
GameDeals,3dp2qs,chandleross,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:29:22 2015 UTC,Definitely not

GameDeals,3dp2qs,Jag-,3,Sat Jul 18 11:02:08 2015 UTC,"There are only two cods on current gen, so I guess advanced warfare is better for single player"
GameDeals,3dp2qs,ModWilliam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:43:07 2015 UTC,"Is it much better than Ghosts?    I liked the variety in the Ghosts campaign, but it was too linear and too short."

For $30 I wouldn't buy it unless you were interested in zombies and multi-player too"

Granted this post should be downvoted as well, but your point is also pretty moot as this is the PS4 version, and the ps4 version has a very very active MP community still that should stay strong until at least Black OPs 3."
GameDeals,3dp2qs,azane,-3,Sat Jul 18 22:27:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly not worth it unless you want it for the Campaign or Exo Zombies. The Campaign is good, the Exo Survival is meh, haven't played Exo Zombies, but as an avid CoD player I absolutely hated the multiplayer. People took too long to kill (as opposed to previous games), and the movement system made it much more difficult to aim at people and was just a shitty idea imo. Save the money for Black Ops III if you're looking for multiplayer. Or shit, even Black Ops II."
GameDeals,3dp2qs,trimpage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:20:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reviewing! Would you say the campaign is worth $20? How would you compare it to the Ghosts campaign, if you have played it?"

GameDeals,3dnkgk,CyberInferno,7,Fri Jul 17 19:27:17 2015 UTC,"I don't believe so, but supposedly the original is really broken, and just completely doesn't work if you're on Windows 8. I can see how they want to sweep in under the rug, and I don't think much is lost compared to Remastered."
GameDeals,3dnkgk,imkrut,4,Fri Jul 17 19:32:19 2015 UTC,I think the original has been completely removed from Steam because it's broken so badly.
GameDeals,3dnkgk,CyberInferno,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:38:11 2015 UTC,Still would be cool as a curiosity/collection point of view.  Great from the devs to offer the upgrade for free tho.
GameDeals,3dnkgk,AtomicBLB,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:42:12 2015 UTC,I gotcha. I think they're trying to distance themselves away from the original as much as possible!
GameDeals,3dnkgk,CyberInferno,2,Fri Jul 17 20:04:09 2015 UTC,Maybe now I can finally play the game. Mine would never save and things that resolved other users problems did not on mine. I gave up trying to get it working.
GameDeals,3dnkgk,trashcanbin10,3,Fri Jul 17 21:01:59 2015 UTC,"You should be good now. From the blog post: ""The game’s finally been rebuilt in a proper engine (Unity), with developers who actually know how to code games."""
GameDeals,3dnkgk,Terminatorn,2,Fri Jul 17 21:29:53 2015 UTC,This is how you make 'Remastered' edition right? Capcom did you see this? Shame on you Capcom with your HD and Remakes.
GameDeals,3dnkgk,Jamesbuc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:59:37 2015 UTC,Capcom sees you alright but they're looking at the money in your pocket too.
GameDeals,3dnkgk,AntiLuke,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:07:45 2015 UTC,I thought the Devil May Cry 4 one was good :/
GameDeals,3dnkgk,JacksonGuitarguy,0,Sat Jul 18 00:57:49 2015 UTC,To be fair to Capcpom* a lot of people asked for the HD remakes.  *their spelling not mine
GameDeals,3dnkgk,Foxhack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:01:33 2015 UTC,I just realized I have an unused serial for this in my gamersgate.com account. Guess I bought it and forgot about it during a sale. I shall use said serial and check this out!
GameDeals,3dnkgk,StrangeCharmVote,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"As someone who was incredibly angry at the shit performance that the original game had on most machines (including my previous computer build) and the lack of updates (and explanation) by the developer... I was pleasantly surprised to see this new version actually working right, and after the dev explained just what went wrong and why the game behaved so poorly on many machines, I felt like shit.  Any other dev would've just gone fuck it, but not these guys. And I'm grateful for that."
GameDeals,3dly8x,rodzajowo,121,Fri Jul 17 10:00:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, recommendation time! S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat is also on sale (70% off)! Call of Pripyat is an amazing game and here is why:   The atmosphere, you'll never experience a better atmosphere than in a stalker game, you constantly feel unsafe and like you are being hunted. The Difficulty, now i get that this could put off some people, the game is hard, and you'll die, a lot but 9/10 times it is your own fault and because of that you'll learn to adapt to the situation and become better (kind of dark souls-esque) The Looks, I personally really like how Call of Pripyat looks, it was also one of the first games to use new DirectX features and it shows. The world looks grim and dark, as it should. and if that's not enough there are tons of visual overhauls and other great mods! The modding scene, obviously not as big as the elder scrolls but hot diggity damn are there a lot of mods for Call of Pripyat, most notably the misery mod which makes the game even harder. There are also numerous mods that add lots and lots of new weapons to the game. another great mod is atmosfear which makes the game look and feel even more creepier. just check out moddb and you'll find something you love!   However, there are also a few things that you should know:   The multiplayer, it's there but its bog standard and buggy as hell, don't pick this up for the multiplayer. besides, it isn't even freeroam multiplayer, just TDM and the rest of the generic modes. The story, it's there and can be interesting if you're into it, i personally really like reading about the zone and it's weirdness. However, it is not for everyone and can be quite dull.   For that price it's definately worth it! If you have anymore questions come visit us at /r/stalker and we'll help you out!"
GameDeals,3dly8x,anythinga,96,Fri Jul 17 10:51:38 2015 UTC,A huge thank-you for this detailed review and recommendation!
GameDeals,3dly8x,GOGcom,58,Fri Jul 17 11:04:18 2015 UTC,"A huge thank you for being one of the few customer focused companies in the gaming industry out there, who understood that piracy is a service problem. I hope you will be successful for a long time, and keep up your current mindset."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Janusdarke,2,Fri Jul 17 11:42:31 2015 UTC,A huge thank you for the DRM free games! I live in a 3rd world country and I wouldn't be able to play The Witcher 3 if it wasn't free for me. It was a very nice game! please keep your games DRM free.
GameDeals,3dly8x,uGainOneKgPerDwnvote,5,Sat Jul 18 11:28:37 2015 UTC,"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Lost Alpha Free Standalone Game • Lost Alpha - Want to play Stalker for free? Well here's one way but it's more than that. It's a reimagining of SOC with everything from levels to interface. Story lines are altered and original concepts from SOC's development were reintroduced. Huge project and a great standalone game. Features - Downloads   I'd advise against playing LA as a first introduction to STALKER. It's incomplete, and while it has many good features, it takes what makes STALKER a special game out of it: A-life. The feeling that the world is alive, and that you're not special by any means, is completely taken away in Lost Alpha."
GameDeals,3dly8x,yamsilvius,3,Fri Jul 17 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"wow. saved for when I get around to playing this, thanks."
GameDeals,3dly8x,N3WM4NH4774N,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:23:49 2015 UTC,Same
GameDeals,3dly8x,xWh33lz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:21 2015 UTC,When you say:   Features - Download   Are those supposed to be links? Because it appears repeatedly in your comment and none of them are links.
GameDeals,3dly8x,randomsnark,2,Sat Jul 18 02:13:14 2015 UTC,Probably. I'm on mobile at the moment and it's messed up. Will fix when I get home. Sorry!
GameDeals,3dly8x,Yehaw4Jihad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:28:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comprehensive mods list and suggestions. I have all three STALKER games in my GOG library, but haven't gotten around to playing them just yet. I plan on doing a straight vanilla run first with the Reclamation Project add-ons for bug fixes. I'd also like to use a mod to change all instances of the fictional weapons names to real-life ones, and was wondering if you had any suggestions. For example, something to change all appearances of the name ""Viper 5"" to the ""H&K MP5""?  I did some searching on my own a while back on GameFront and found these files: ""stalker_realgunnames_v.3"" for Shadow of Chernobyl, ""clear_sky_real_weapon_names_v1.2"" for Clear Sky, and ""stalker_cop_real_weapon_names_eng1.0"" for Call of Pripyat. I'm wondering if anyone can vouch for their accuracy and comprehensiveness (if it changes gun names for menus, dialogs, quests, pickup prompts, etc.)"
GameDeals,3dly8x,Oddb411,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"FWIW i never encountered any bugs in my play through. Ok, i think it did crash to desktop once or twice."
GameDeals,3dly8x,dontnation,0,Sat Jul 18 01:35:57 2015 UTC,stock vanilla. on the first play through anyway. to be honest I encountered more issues once i started modding. But that was probably due to pushing my gpu to hard.
GameDeals,3dly8x,dontnation,6,Fri Jul 17 19:33:13 2015 UTC,And by the time you're done with your first playthrough the multiplayer mod will have been released in the US! Ray of Hope
GameDeals,3dly8x,throwawaymyoldstuff,3,Fri Jul 17 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"As a keen stalker player, holy shit. Actual multiplayer would be amazing, I hope the mod works out well!"
GameDeals,3dly8x,AussieGuy96,2,Sat Jul 18 00:43:59 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of stalker-like multiplayer games on Steam. REviews are very mixed, but they are free to play (but pay to win, is one of the major complaints). S-Zone and Survarium are two I know of, but haven't had any experience playing myself."
GameDeals,3dly8x,NukaCooler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:04 2015 UTC,"Survarium actually has devs from the STALKER team.  It's currently just generic TDM and stuff, but they say they are going to add free-roam with large maps."
GameDeals,3dly8x,swiftlysauce,10,Fri Jul 17 12:31:46 2015 UTC,"kind of dark souls-esque   God I hate that this is now used in place of the word difficult.  Also, Stalker isn't that hard at all.   Now, I played with Stalker Complete back when people liked that mod with the realistic damage add on. Even then it was manageable.  I believe these days people just put the difficulty to maximum which does roughly the same thing i.e. crank up the damage for weapons so enemies are no longer a bullet sponge?"
GameDeals,3dly8x,Matthew94,10,Fri Jul 17 12:55:56 2015 UTC,"I think before dark souls I would have said mega man or ninja gaiden. Fact is, there are different kinds of ""hard,"" and well-designed, self-contained challenges of encounters is its own kind of difficult in this setting compared to say, half life, halo, or many rpgs.   The comparison implies a level of resulting quality to the difficulty beyond what ramped config variables can provide, which is more common."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Switche,3,Fri Jul 17 13:02:20 2015 UTC,"Well... Ninja Gaiden is a more apt comparison. The Souls games are more akin to a game like Ninja Gaiden because they revolve around some core tenets - intense difficulty, frequent and often brutal boss encounters, and are third-person action games. They also have movesets (though Dark Souls' are FAR more limited in nature) for different weapons and involve mastering those movesets and enemy patterns + upgrading said weapons.  There is obviously much more to it than that, but I would say that comparing a game like Ninja Gaiden to Dark Souls is a pretty apt comparison in many more ways than just difficulty. STALKER, on the other hand, is nothing like Dark Souls in pretty much any way other than difficulty.   In that way, I could say STALKER is Viva Pinata-esque. Man, fuck that game."
GameDeals,3dly8x,caninehere,3,Fri Jul 17 22:04:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Stalker isn't like Dark Soul at all in terms of difficulty. Quicksave at any time alone drastically reduced the difficulty, which isn't a bad thing I'd say because in Stalker games, you have to run A LOT.  Difficult game is just difficult. It doesn't have to Dark Soul."
GameDeals,3dly8x,hbkmog,4,Fri Jul 17 14:26:56 2015 UTC,Is this a good introduction to the series?  How well has it aged?  I tried Shadow of Chernobyl awhile ago and thought it was a bit dated.
GameDeals,3dly8x,TinctureOfBadass,11,Fri Jul 17 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"Well, if you play Pripyat first I guarantee that you will not enjoy SoC as much, if you can play it at all. I played Clear Skies first, and found it difficult to get into SoC. They are definitely worth playing, but do yourself a favor and play in order of release."
GameDeals,3dly8x,NukaCooler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"It's very similar, a bit streamlined."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Matthew94,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:14:48 2015 UTC,it has aged really well if you ask me.
GameDeals,3dly8x,Janusdarke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:27:36 2015 UTC,"Well I don't mean graphics, really, what I'm wondering is how well the gameplay and mechanics hold up."
GameDeals,3dly8x,TinctureOfBadass,3,Fri Jul 17 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"Is aging of gameplay and mechanics even possible? i can still play System Shock 1 or Deus Ex 1 and love the complexity, in my opinion gameplay is way better in older games. Stalker has pretty average FPS mechanics, so there's not much to know about, except that it's a hard game, you have to aim carefully and keep an eye on your ammo.Everything tries to kill you, even nature. Also you have a basic inventory, mostly filled with ammo, food and weapons. Artefacts can give you certain buffs, but are sometimes hard to acquire."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Janusdarke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with every else you've said there except this,   The Difficulty, now i get that this could put off some people, the game is hard, and you'll die, a lot but 9/10 times it is your own fault and because of that you'll learn to adapt to the situation and become better (kind of dark souls-esque)   Actually, a lot of times when you die it's because of some RNG bullshit, especially when it comes to stray bullet and random enemy spawn. If you see someone throws a grenade at you, most likely you will just be dead. If you get some unlucky spawns near you while you are in the middle of a fight, you are most likely dead. At some levels, it's basically trial and error because of camping enemy spawns.  The game isn't really that difficult if you save often. Like I said, many times it's trial and error."
GameDeals,3dly8x,hbkmog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:45 2015 UTC,Does it have the same feel to it as Shadow of Chernobyl?
GameDeals,3dly8x,Mithridates12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:24 2015 UTC,The misery mod is awful. Its buggy and unbalance Ed
GameDeals,3dly8x,swiftlysauce,0,Fri Jul 17 20:32:56 2015 UTC,How fast do the enemies die? one of my main problems with shadow of Chernobyl is that it seemed like enemies could tank shots from me
GameDeals,3dly8x,Hellriser77,4,Fri Jul 17 20:21:01 2015 UTC,If you play on the highest difficulty all weapon damage is higher while HP remain the same.
GameDeals,3dly8x,donwallo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:04:30 2015 UTC,"In SoC, even on Master difficulty, enemies are still bullet sponge."
GameDeals,3dly8x,hbkmog,3,Fri Jul 17 16:46:24 2015 UTC,Not once you get an accurate weapon and can head shot.
GameDeals,3dly8x,dontnation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"Well of course you can headshot but if that's the only effective way to kill an enemy, there's something wrong with it. It still makes enemy bullet sponge when they don't even flinch when you shoot them with shotgun in the chest at point blank."
GameDeals,3dly8x,hbkmog,3,Fri Jul 17 19:04:10 2015 UTC,I never had that problem. In fact it's pretty much how I played until I got accurate weapons and even in the late game when in a bind.  A double barrel to the chest pretty much takes out any enemy.
GameDeals,3dly8x,dontnation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:15:29 2015 UTC,Really? Did you play vanilla? I played SoC on master difficulty with only bug fixes and texture packs and the late stage enemies are quite bullet sponges with exception of headshot. I can hit them 2 or 3 shots of shotgun and they still run like nothing happened. It approximately takes 10~15 rifle bullets to put one down.  Now I'm replaying it with Autumn Aurora mod and the combat is much better. Both enemies and you get killed in 1~3 shots.
GameDeals,3dly8x,hbkmog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"Not with the regular shotgun (charger? chaser? something like that) mind you. It has much lower firing rate than the double barrel.  Both shots from the double barrel at point blank with take down or at least stun most enemies. Also from very close range it is pretty easy to get headshots which will put down most anything.  I just know that it came in very handy in the arena. I'll double check but I seem to remember that even if they didn't die from two blasts, being able to just keep hitting tough enemies because the reload was faster than their recovery."
GameDeals,3dly8x,dontnation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:50:25 2015 UTC,I think I have heard this complaint before but that was not how I experienced it. I was very focused on headshots though.  It may be that the range of the shotgun in particular was too low.
GameDeals,3dly8x,donwallo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:53:03 2015 UTC,Just put it on master difficulty and they'll die quite fast :)
GameDeals,3dly8x,anythinga,38,Fri Jul 17 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"Surprised nobody's mentioned the Riddick game. It's such a classic. I definitely recommend it if you love stealth games, and especially if you enjoy games that just immerse you.   Also if you played the new Wolfenstein and enjoyed it, Riddick is made by the same guys."
GameDeals,3dly8x,zombiefriend,-15,Fri Jul 17 21:17:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll be downvoted (I'm dont care), but I must say the truth: some of the games (not all) that sell GoG, use scene-group ""cracked"" files. For example (only for that Promo): CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK: ASSAULT ON DARK ATHENA uses fixed files, from scene group ""Reloaded"": http://www.gog.com/forum/chronicles_of_riddick_the/tages_drm/page1  and many more (FlatOut, DeusEx: Invisible War, Project Eden... etc), google it if interested.  If you want avoid this ""stuff"", just keep in mind."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Bobby_Marks2,28,Fri Jul 17 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with that? GOG gets permission from the publisher, and then does what it takes to make sure the games run on modern hardware. If that's using existing cracks, or DOSbox or SCUMMVM, or writing their own fixes, they do it.   I guess if you are hellbent on scene crackers getting their credit then maybe it's a problem, but GOG is one of the largest digital game storefronts on the internet so it shouldn't be a quality concern."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Bobby_Marks2,-24,Fri Jul 17 19:29:40 2015 UTC,"It's not about permission to use ""cracked"" files, but about files that originally comes from unknown person from internet ""underground"".  DOSBox or SCUMMVM is OpenSource software, not ""cracks"". Hope you understand differences."
GameDeals,3dly8x,JEMSKU,12,Fri Jul 17 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not sure what your point is. You can compare the code-base in an afternoon, find exactly what has been changed, and verify that it isn't dangerous."
GameDeals,3dly8x,GUILTIE,-22,Fri Jul 17 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"Sometime this ""fixed"" files obfuscated with protectors. Some people (like me) want buy and play, not buy and reverse."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Amakou,13,Fri Jul 17 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"GOG takes care of verifying that the files are not harmful, it's not expected for the end-user to have the know-how to do it themselves."
GameDeals,3dly8x,ruffykunn,-12,Fri Jul 17 17:32:02 2015 UTC,"Good to hear. If you have any info, that prove how to GoG ""prepare"" cracked files (from GoG employees), before they put it on the store, maybe you post it here.  Not just for me, but for people who care about is. Thanks in advance.   P.S. Sorry, I found some... sort of gogptimisation, i think: http://i40.tinypic.com/wit361.png (stolen from https://archive.is/R6BfQ )"
GameDeals,3dly8x,YellowOrange,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:34 2015 UTC,Not sure why you are being down voted if this is true. Certainly interesting to know.
GameDeals,3dly8x,freeogy,3,Fri Jul 17 17:41:36 2015 UTC,Interesting... Riddick has been on my wishlist for a while. I know Steam removed the game from the store and that it had TAGES DRM. I didn't realize GoG took a more creative approach.
GameDeals,3dly8x,10000_Spoons_Irony,2,Fri Jul 17 18:44:54 2015 UTC,Antivirus scanners often tell users that cracks are viruses when they are actually not (which is fucking scummy of them). A good way to find out if a cracked executable is actually a virus is to let Google's Virustotal run three dozen antivirus scanners on it. If only a minority of them claim it's a virus (or the file has more user upvotes than downvotes) that's probably bullshit.
GameDeals,3dly8x,refudiat0r,32,Fri Jul 17 19:03:59 2015 UTC,"Caesar III is definitely a Good Old Game, it's a wonderful city builder. I'd recommend sticking to peaceful maps though, the combat wasn't much fun for me (barbarians armed with swords can hit your buildings like three times and down they go).   And no matter what the game may tell you, the real goal of the game is to upgrade your houses from empty plots of land into a palace."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Dreamercz,4,Sat Jul 18 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"I loved C3 when I was younger. I will say, though, that it uses a pretty primitive agent system for its employment system among other things, so it forces you to make pretty gamey choices for how you lay out your city."
GameDeals,3dly8x,ThePatrioticBrit,2,Fri Jul 17 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"Oh man, Caesar III was what got me into city builders. I do agree about the combat - I always went peaceful myself. I barely recall, but I do remember getting frustrated with how vendors walked through neighborhoods and having to be pretty strict about setting up roadblocks. I'd be playing for an hour and then suddenly a bunch of buildings would burn down because one sliver of an area wasn't being served by a fireman.  The music is great as well."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Oafah,2,Sun Jul 19 10:17:22 2015 UTC,"What a great game!  Pharoah and Zeus are also on sale - I enjoyed Pharoah quite a bit.  I thought Emperor was the most polished out of all of them in the series, but it's wonderful to see these great old games!"

IMO, I'd wait for that to play it because the saves aren't even compatible. Overall, a good game but the story thins out heavily near the end and gets a bit buggy which I believe the enhanced edition is supposed to fix."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Ahkreem,11,Fri Jul 17 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought they might jack up the price once the enhanced edition (or whatever they're calling it) is released.  I was a kickstarter backer, so I'm looking forward to a free upgrade."
GameDeals,3dly8x,mark2uk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it even had a lower price during the GOG summer sale.

GameDeals,3dly8x,MehraMilo,14,Fri Jul 17 16:12:49 2015 UTC,If you bought a bundle from humble which contained Psychonauts then you probably already have a DRM free version of it hidden somewhere in your library.  If you don't its a fun if not somewhat surreal game from double fine when they were more than just fine

GameDeals,3dly8x,IceWindWolf,12,Fri Jul 17 12:17:21 2015 UTC,Just a word of warning: Earth 2160 is actually pretty shit.  Either TB meant to add Earth 2150 or he has lost his mind.
GameDeals,3dly8x,Benthetraveler,5,Fri Jul 17 15:27:08 2015 UTC,How much better is 2150? I have 2160 due to TB reccomending both(he actually says this one is better) but compared to games like supreme commander/total anhil/SC2 it just feels clunky.
GameDeals,3dly8x,IceWindWolf,3,Fri Jul 17 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"You can't really compare it to those games. It's just a better RTS then 2160 and has some very innovative features such as:   terraforming subterrain unit building (in the sense that you design them) camera in camera/split screens research tree   It also has a unique campaign in which you don't play the traditional rts thingy but instead the main focus of the campaign lies in gathering resources to leave the dying earth (so it's a trade-off between wasting too many resources on war).  It's a solid game, back when it was released it was really something else. But I wouldn't call it a ""must have"" game. If you are into RTS go for it."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Benthetraveler,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for another large scale combat RTS. That feeling of 1000 light assult bots roaring over an enemy base and just watching nuke after nuke detonate as the enemy crumbles is like cocaine for me. All the screenshots seem to have quite a few units in them; but I geusee 2160 just didn't seem to feel the right speed? Like, the camera seemed slow, the game was slow(I then sped it up to 75 and suddenly all of my units died instantly sooo thats a thing), It felt very clunky controling both units and groups of units. I dunno, you're right in the fact that I really shouldn't be comparing it, I just kinda hoped that TB( A starcraft lover) would have another great RTS on the list."
GameDeals,3dly8x,thelazyreader2015,3,Fri Jul 17 13:38:21 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the total war series? While the overall map is turned based the tactical map has thousands of units. Both Empire and Shogun 2/Fall of the Samurai might hit the spot you are looking for. Other then that it looks a bit grim, Openspring and PA just aren't all that great..."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Timobkg,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"I've really only ever seen one total war thing and it was a video by the yogscast of total war rome, and the whole preselect troops and then send them into combat seemed kinda tacky; I kinda wanna try it, but it's just never seemed luring enough. Which one might you recomend?  I'm really bummed about PA. I was so looking foward to replaying a modern SupCom and having PLANETARY battles that when I saw all the ""Shit"" reviews I felt like shit.  Have you heard of sins of a solar (rebellion or empire idk which)? Someone told me it was similiar only it was more of a 3d RTS then a 2d(In the sense height  matters due to it being space craft.  What's openspring?"
GameDeals,3dly8x,Romulet,2,Fri Jul 17 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"Openspring is a TA open source remake.  I'd probably try Shogun 2, it's regarded as the best. Fall of the Samurai if you want more Gunpowder and less melee.  Sins is kinda a mix of 4x and RTS. The scale is large so games usually are very long but the unit count is more traditionell. Maybe a bit higher. Worth checking out, has a good star trek mod if you are into that."

GameDeals,3dly8x,10000_Spoons_Irony,48,Fri Jul 17 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"The Longest Journey is one of my favorite games. An adventure game with a great story, a female protagonist that's still better than the norm, and puzzles that make sense.  It's a point and click adventure game where almost all the puzzles are intuitive. I think I had to consult a walkthrough 2-3 times, once for a puzzle that I had 90% figured out but was missing the last bit and once for a pixel hunt (thankfully the only one).  The protagonist feels like a real person, and is still refreshing as a female protagonist.  But the real appeal for me was the story. It was like a book I couldn't put down. The story was gripping, the setting was interesting, the characters were mature and realistic. I found myself rushing home reach day to play more and find what happened next."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Timobkg,12,Fri Jul 17 17:07:51 2015 UTC,Was that the game with the rubber duck/paperclip puzzle?
GameDeals,3dly8x,10000_Spoons_Irony,7,Fri Jul 17 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think that puzzle had me stumped, the toy monkey puzzle I got 90% of but was missing the hat, and I couldn't find the light switch in one scene. The rest of the puzzles I had no problem with, and this was one of the first adventure games I played."

I only ask because I was a bit underwhelmed with those games and the amount of ""pixel hunting"" I had to do to progress. I don't mind that aspect of adventure point-and-clicks too much, but there were definitely parts I found very unintuitive."
GameDeals,3dly8x,carpecaffeum,5,Fri Jul 17 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"I only had to pixel hunt in one scene in TLJ, looking for a light switch which was just a circle on the wall. TLJ struck me as more polished, with a better story."

Part may be do to being the middle part of a trilogy, thus neither introducing the cool world nor wrapping up with the epic conclusion. Part is definitely due to the poorly done stealth sections. But if you enjoy TLJ, and it's my favorite adventure game, you'll like Dreamfall.  I haven't played Dreamfall Chapters as I wait for all the episodes to come out before buying episodic games, but so far everything I've heard about it has been good, which is a relief."
GameDeals,3dly8x,emmanuelvr,5,Fri Jul 17 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a point and click enthusiast. TLJ is a much better game than Syberia, although visually it hasn't aged as well.  Better (and longer) story, more interesting characters, and better puzzles. Dreamfall is worth it if you end up loving the TLJ, because you get to continue the story and revisit those locations in glorious 3D, athlough the combat and stealth mechanics are frustrating.  I backed the DF: Chapters kickstarter, but haven't played it yet because I'm waiting for the whole thing to be finished."

GameDeals,3dly8x,slinkycon,25,Fri Jul 17 15:06:14 2015 UTC,"Master of magic is a fun little light civilization kind of game.   You are a wizard that seeks world domination, this is done by destroying your opponents (duh). It is possible to customize your wizard by selecting their spell affinity, chose up to 12 ranks of spellbooks, which then detemines how much of a school you can research, jack of all trades? or a powerhouse?  The game has 2 maps in each game, the normal, and the ""Myrran"", which has different races and more powerful magic. The maps are filled with shrines, tombs and elemental nodes, which all can be cleared for items to give your heroes. And in the case of elemental nodes they can be possesed by a special unit when cleared, this gives you more mana to spend on research, or casting skill.  Combat is done in another screen, with you controlling your troops against the enemy, and with the ability to influence the outcome by casting magic in aid, or just direct damage."
GameDeals,3dly8x,sesstreets,13,Fri Jul 17 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"Master of magic is a fun little light civilization kind of game.    Well, by modern standards that may be accurate, but for the time it was a ""real"" game. Don't think ""mobile"" when Grokta says this, think ""1994 full commercial IBM game"". The various trees are still quite significantly deep, you actually can't explore all the magic trees in one game, and it's balanced a lot like Magic the Gathering in that not only are all the pure-color strategies viable and distinct on their own, but there are a lot of very good mixed-color strategies that are viable and distinct. (And while this is not a ""MtG"" clone, it does so happen that a MtG fan will pretty much get what I mean by that correctly. Mana is colorless in MoM, though there are some color alignment bonuses for three of the colors for matching ""nodes"" of that color.) Plus there are viable non-magic-based more ""Civizilation""-y strategies, too. Like many games of this genre, eventually you can master it to the point that you'll be setting yourself Single City Challenges and stuff like that, but you'll be a while getting there. It's quite expansive."

GameDeals,3dly8x,Rasral123,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. I started with War of the Roses, and found it quite entertaining, but there is a definite equipment gap (at least when I last played) where players who have sunk a lot of time playing the game gain a distinct advantage over new players. You can still outskill a player. But it is A LOT harder to.  When I first played Chivalry, especially after  War of the Roses, I thought it was an arcadey piece of crap, hack and slash, swing wildly no skill required. Oh... how wrong I was. The unlock system lowers you into the game gradually, with later weapons not really better than earlier weapons. Just different. A new player who can grasp the mechanics can easily go toe to toe with someone who has 1000+ hours in the game.  Both games are fun. Chivalry is much more satisfying when you get to the grit of it."
GameDeals,3dly8x,jvcthome,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"It doesn't hurt that Chivalry is also far more popular than War of the Roses, and in a game that revolves purely around multiplayer that can mean everything."

Something like the Souls series that requires a quick response time benefits greatly from having a higher framerate."
GameDeals,3dly8x,Antrix32,4,Fri Jul 17 13:30:47 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true either. Several games will have precisely zero difference when unlocked. The recent issues over Guild of Dungeoneering for instance, which will not noticeably improve at higher framerates. Basically any turn based slow game will have an exceedingly minimal impact at higher frames. I don't think anyone gives a shit that Heroes of Might and Magic is capped to 30FPS because it simply doesn't matter for the style of game it is."
GameDeals,3dly8x,albatr0xx,2,Fri Jul 17 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the FFIV iOS ports on steam that have battles locked at 15fps are pretty annoying.  You're right in that it doesn't have a huge impact on gameplay, but it's one of those ""can't unsee"" things that detracts from the experience."
GameDeals,3dly8x,RainerMD,0,Fri Jul 17 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"Those are slightly different. They might be turn based (of a sort) but the combat action the sprite takes are very fast paced, so they would have a discernible difference at higher frames."
GameDeals,3dly8x,GOGcom,3,Fri Jul 17 23:18:10 2015 UTC,"The difference being that bloodborne is a game that would heavily benefit from 60fps being very action based.

GameDeals,3dly8x,cosmo87,9,Fri Jul 17 10:57:47 2015 UTC,If you are a fan of the earlier HoMM games (II & III) chances are you'll love them. The series does a much better job of capturing the spirit of those games than any of the official sequels. In my opinion you should start of with King's Bounty: The Legend. Regarding Crossworlds it does include Armored Princess but not The Legend. The only reason to buy standalone Armored Princess (e.g. on steam) is for people that want a Mac version.

GameDeals,3dly8x,mmencius,18,Fri Jul 17 12:40:57 2015 UTC,"OK I'm seriously puzzled why one random youtuber TB has such influence over this sub and /r/games. I mean his content is... good, it's good, I like it. I wouldn't say it blows anything else out of the water. It's articulate and well-written, it's not flaming trash like Pewdipie that you get the impression only someone with a purple tentacle in their neck would watch.  But he seems to have a godlike status on these threads. ""TB says insert totally obvious thing about Steam refunds not being bad"" is cited as THE reason to believe Steam refunds won't destroy the gaming industry."
GameDeals,3dly8x,shantigilbert,20,Fri Jul 17 13:21:31 2015 UTC,"TB is brazen enough to espouse his opinion in a manner to convince you of it being absolute fact, and in being fairly well spoken and knowledgeable about it, his opinion gains credence and prestige. I'll admit, I am a fan of TB and I do think that he's quite often right -- or at least justified -- when he chooses to take a stand against certain things (FOV sliders, MTX policies, pre-orders, FOV sliders). But he's not always right, some things are simply more nuanced than he allows them to be. He has the potential to be downright petty when his word goes unappreciated, or when a company gets ticked off at him, or his fanbase (who are prone to groupthink).  He has a good casting voice, a sufficiently entertaining character, and has worked his personality to become pretty omnipresent in gaming conventions, tournaments, forums, with Reddit in particular. He knows what he is doing, and he does it well. He goes out of his way to be fair, square, yet stubborn, cynical and puts consumer first and company second. Occasionally he does these things to his detriment. One of the things that I like about him is his ability to stick with his opinion rather than self-flagellate and double back.  I like TB. His YouTube channel is one of my most visited, and I've watched God-knows-how-many hours of the Co-Optional podcast. I agree with roughly 90% of his reviews and 90% of his opinions, and I'd wager that the majority of his fanbase feels the same way. But that's how groupthink works. 10% of the community will attempt to voice their disagreement with one of his videos, but it will be quashed by the majority, so you never even see the disagreement.  I'd like to note that on the personal side, each and every one of us is capable of being petty and snide when we feel that we are undervalued/underappreciated, or when we are attacked on social media. It's a natural human thing. As a celebrity, if you scroll down far enough on your Twitter feed, you will find some terrible, hurtful things being said about you. It really takes a special type of commitment to let that anxiety flow through you (fear of people badmouthing) and resisting temptation to compulsively seek assurance. Some celebrities do it well. Others -- and especially gaming celebrities, who presumably became popular in their area of expertise as a result of doing something nerdy and not socially conducive -- do not handle it so well. So I don't judge TB for being petty from time to time. I would honestly handle it a lot worse than he would. It does not at all affect my opinion of him as a presenter, reviewer, or all around decent chap.  TL;DR: Fanbases of popular YouTubers are a bit of an echo chamber."
GameDeals,3dly8x,morphinedreams,10,Fri Jul 17 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've always liked TB because of his non-review format. He talks about tangible mechanics in each game, what he likes, why he likes it, what he dislikes, and why some people might like it even if he doesn't. Instead of assigning arbitrary numbers and values, he goes into detail in ways that let the viewer make an educated decision about whether or not to make a purchase, regardless of his personal opinion.

Fantastic soundtracks and stories worthy of being in a movie, heart-pounding action that's a distinct mix of stealth, shooting, and brawling, and the voice acting is top-notch across the board, not to mention the atmosphere. These are easily 9/10 level games and you get both in the same package. They were slightly cheaper during the summer sale, but honestly, these games would be a steal at almost any price, they still look and play as good now as when they were first released. One of the few movie based games that trumps its original source material in every category.  By the way, ""Assault on Dark Athena"" has one of the best final lines in all of gaming."

A lot of times I don't feel like playing any of them, I just like watching someone talk about something new/interesting and see how they feel about it.  I subscribe to enough channels on youtube that I can generally wait 3-4 days, load it up and have 45 mins - 2 hours of content that I want to watch (pared down from the 100+ videos that have been uploaded by the people I subscribe to).  Even games I've already played - like I enjoy watching LGR's review of Civilization I, as well as basically anything else he chooses to review or do a video on.  TB isn't as funny or interesting as most of the other people I follow, but his ""WTF is?"" is an interesting look at games, basically a first look but he includes the options menu, talk about performance issues, DRM or other relevant news about a game that might turn you off about it, and other interesting tidbits."

I really recommend that if you have depression, think you have depression, or are just feeling gloomy, you hold off on this....  It deals with grieving and depression, but it is really hard hitting.  The gameplay is nice: challenging and rewarding. It's a puzzle platformer that deals with switching dimensions (not sure if there is a subgenre for that yet). Some more mechanics are introduced by way of being shot at, inversions, and a few more I won't spoil. There are hidden items that can be used as modifiers for the game (like low gravity, or slippery grounds). The replay value comes from these items, analternate ending (nothing special required, just make a different choice when the time comes), an extended level pack (free update), and challenges (what i suspect unlock achievements, but no confirmation yet).   I ran into some frame problems near the end with everything going on, but it eventually went away after a couple of retrys. It is a rather short game of a few hours: i personally don't count that against a game, but I know longevity matters to some people. Also, some people mentioned how annoying the glitchy thing is in the trailer, so you should know that the glitch effect happens every time you switch dimensions."

GameDeals,3dmy0v,ShinDigpay,-6,Fri Jul 17 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, it isn't a ""tier"". Of course, since they don't call it a tier. And of course, I can spell of course, rather than using the abbreviation of ofc since that is absurdly lazy. How much time does that save you, maybe 6 key presses at 30 words per minute? Even on mobile, SwiftKey would autocorrect that to the full version.  But when I preorder something before its out, and I get the full bundle, then that is top tier. Each item you add to the build-a-bundle is a tier. If there are 10 games, and you have to add at least 3 to get it, then there are 8 tiers of content. Each tier adds another game.   When you preorder you get all of the tiers and you pay less than half the price. For a comparison of what you get for pre-ordering, it still applies.  edit: downvote all you want; it won't change my opinion.   Tier: n.: a row or level of a structure, typically one of a series of rows placed one above the other and successively receding or diminishing in size."

GameDeals,3dmjp9,BeerGogglesFTW,12,Fri Jul 17 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"UT99 is possibly worth owning if you can handle a slightly different yet similar game (like owning CS:S and CS 1.6 if you mostly play CS:GO or something). It's got some great mods and options.  Unreal 2 is meh. You will play it once and never touch it again. It's not bad, but it's just not historically relevant as a shooter and it isn't good enough to impress you more than that one time.  Unreal is historically relevant, and IMO a great shooter if you want to explore pre-Half-Life FPS design. It's also pretty good at getting your adrenaline pumping. I don't remember modding it, and it's multiplayer is dead.   I own them all. I'd recommend settling for just 2k4 unless owning the rest really speaks to you."
GameDeals,3dmjp9,Bobby_Marks2,6,Fri Jul 17 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"I have all Unreal games in physical form. I loved Onslaught mode in UT2K4 but original UT always had a better deathmatch feel for me and still prefer it over UT2K4. Unreal 2 is a solid shooter but pretty generic. There are some memorable levels, like on one mission you land on a planet which is alive and breathing or you are in spaceship that crashes and whole level shifts sideways."

GameDeals,3dmjp9,Die4Ever,3,Sat Jul 18 02:04:37 2015 UTC,"FWIW, UT99 is already DRM free. UT99 and its ""fork,"" Deus Ex, initially shipped with basic disc-checking DRM. It really wasn't DRM, it simply looked for the disc and was easily disabled, but I probably shouldn't say how despite it being pretty common knowledge. Anyway, the latest official patch to UT99 removes this check. If you fully installed the game, and ran the patch, I think it was 436 (it's been years), no more CD check.  Never thought to buy it digitally, I think I still have a UT99_436 zip on my PC somewhere. It's basically the game and all the free DLC, and maybe a few maps and mods (mutators, they were called then) installed, all I gotta do is unpack it.  Does the digital purchase include all the free DLC?  I didn't think the Unreal single player games were that good, personally, but UT99 is solid gold, and UT2004 was pretty good. I used to play Hall of Giants (CTF, UT99) to relieve stress, though never online, just with bots. I had the difficulty set just right, to where I'd win, but not easily."

PVP, co-op, social media integration… I respect that others see a difference, but I don't. I briefly made an exception for the Rockband games, but to me that's just a party game.   Deus Ex is my favorite game, but I haven't played it on years. I must have beaten it over 100 times. Possibly more. I wasn't much for reading the books and newspapers (or digital equivalent — caught myself there) but otherwise I don't think there's anything about the game I don't know. For fun, I used to challenge the GameFAQs Deus Ex community to find stuff o didn't know about. Mostly they couldn't find anything. A couple times they knew something I didn't, and I admitted it every time and thanked the person. After a while nobody could come up with anything I didn't know. Like, for example, are you aware that if you jump the fence at Vandenberg, towards the helipad where Jock picks you up, there's a dead body with some loot? No one would ever think to go there.

It was a pretty amazing/eerie game back in the day (the sound effects/music were great), and of course the graphics were insane for the time.  It was the birth of the flak cannon and the grenade mode is still one of the best attacks in FPS history (and down through the various iterations).  It was pretty fun to play against the bots but I doubt if I ever got connected to play online.  You're going to want UT for a more polished multiplayer experience.  I've only played a bit of Unreal 2 on the Xbox, but I wouldn't say it's very interesting or worthwhile from what I've played (at the very least, it wasn't as much of a groundbreaker as either Unreal or the first UT)."

Nothing like reliving the opening moments of jumping out a plane as Sonic and surfing down a street!  The PC port is pretty good too - better than Sonic Adventure 1 (but they have improved it a bit since the original port). It's possible to play without a controller, but later in the game it's a little tricky so in that respect I'd advise a controller.

There's only the smallest sliver of tactical scope, and it concerns the most efficient way to drill and scoop. Once you've got that nailed (probably takes less than an hour for anyone who can count), you are then completely and utterly at the mercy of the RNG.  There is literally nothing else to do except advance forwards and pray to the Gods of Arbitraria. It's entirely possible to warp into a new system and be randomly told you've forgotten how to build engines, then go to a planet only to have your engines randomly explode. Game over. Nothing you can do to prepare, nothing you can do to avoid, nothing you can do to fix the problem. It's not ""hard"", in the sense of challenging, because the only thing it challenges is your patience.  Beyond efficient drilling / fuel use, there are no tactics, and there is no strategy. There's basically no game. Just get enough good results from the RNG to get to the end of the game.  But having said all that, it's still quite an enjoyable experience.

GameDeals,3dn5pr,Cheesenium,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"Out There very much relies on a lot of RNG where if the RNG gods decides to fuck you, then you are very much screwed without providing much alternatives or options to remedy to reduce the impact of the situation. While other roguelikes like FTL, Binding of Issac, Darkest Dungeon, Don't Starve, XCOM, Invisible Inc and so on also rely a lot on RNG, their gameplay is designed in a way that there are ways to overcome the problem that RNG gave you. Out There felt extremely rigid and limited without much options given which at the end, it is frustrating to play.   If you really want to try Out There, get it on your phone or tablet. It's a more bearable game there because you generally play at short burst. The game is designed as a mobile game so it will be quite dreadful to play on pc."

Also I think I prefer Out There's materials game and crafting style to FTL. Also, the game doesn't feel as hopeless as FTL did. Like, being chased all the time didn't help, you know?

There was a mod that removed this, and it was SO much better because I could more easily get lost in the exploration and discovery. Out There is like this, as you can explore and enjoy as you go. Sure there are dangers, and you might fail because you ran out of metal to fix your ship or something, but I feel like my failures are more my own in Out There, rather than the entire universe conspiring against me."

GameDeals,3dn5pr,jeffydomer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"There's no combat.  It's basically a resource management game.  Great artwork and music, but often turns into frustration.  Also, it's obviously made to be played on a tablet or smart phone."
GameDeals,3dmna5,SuperMoonky,14,Fri Jul 17 14:39:42 2015 UTC,"Be aware cossacks Back to war + Cossacks Campaign Expansion =  Cossacks Europeans Wars + The Art of War. This is exactly the same game, except Back to War is a little better and above all runs fine on 7 64b (which is not the case of EW + TAoW). About the game itself, it's a great RTS, but I advice it only to people nostalgics of old RTS or whishing to discover this kind of game. Because the gameplay is far of the current standards. Can't talk about American Conquest or Cossacks 2."

GameDeals,3dmwwb,zipinel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"Deponia Complete Journey is a match for historical low.  The best way to exerience the game.  Has a very non-intrusive ability to get developer commentary that kind of punctures the fourth wall in funny ways and incorporates the voice actors (both as characters and as actual actors, it's hard to explain).  I enjoyed it and because of the way it's structured you can click it on at any scene the commentary is available and some of it's funny, some of it's insightful, and some of it you will start to hit the skip button on.  Most importantly, its there if you want it and completely ignorable if you don't.  Some people bag on Deponia because the main character is not 100% likeable but thats intentional.  Thematically humor wise it's definitely aping some Guybrush but where Guybrush was a lovable idiot, Rufus is more borderline jerk because he's at least moderately self-aware and does things that are jerky.  It's still fun, laughs come often enough and the voice acting isn't cringe inducing (some characters are better then others).    Story wise - I feel like it's pretty consistent, there are a few lulls but the characters themselves are interesting and funny enough that I find that more important then the larger plot at hand.  It's completely tailored to the theme of comedy, because thats what Deponia is, it's completely different then Memoria or the Rabbit game I can't recall the name of.  Not bad or better, just different.  Puzzles - I would say for me, I always go at it head first, and if I'm not making progress after 15-20 minutes I will consult a guide.  With Deponia I felt like I had to go to guide a handful of times and for half them it was like ""duh, why didn't I try that combo"" and the other half was like ""are you kidding me? no logical person would ever connect those dots"".  So like all adventure games, don't be afraid to ask for help if you begin to get frustrated, most puzzles are good and reasonable difficult, some are just obscure or have connecting pieces too far apart.  edited to add - as for puzzles the game is nice in that there is a pretty ""gentle"" hint system available that is essentially a ""story map"" that gives you indicators on what you SHOULD be attempting.  Not necessarily how to do it but more of a ""I have no idea what I'm supposed to do in order to advance the story"" kind of help.  I thought that was a nice touch."
