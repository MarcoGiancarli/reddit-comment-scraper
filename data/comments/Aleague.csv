Aleague,3e4jgn,PidgeyIsOP,2,Wed Jul 22 06:34:01 2015 UTC,"If you account for inflation, Kewell to Liverpool is still higher at around 10,000,000 euros  Edit: Bresciano to Parma would be more too.  Edit2: Viduka to Leeds would be close to 12,000,0000 euros in todays money."
Aleague,3e4jgn,cynikles,3,Tue Jul 21 23:39:50 2015 UTC,Generally inflation isn't taken into account when discussing record transfer fees
Aleague,3e4jgn,JGQuintel,4,Wed Jul 22 07:04:00 2015 UTC,Then generally it isn't a fair comparison.
Aleague,3e4jgn,cynikles,2,Wed Jul 22 07:07:42 2015 UTC,I heard it's 1 year loan with option to buy at end.
Aleague,3e4jgn,rezplzk,2,Tue Jul 21 23:03:41 2015 UTC,"Typical, downvote without a reason.  Recent news suggests that it is a permanent, 6-year deal."

Aleague,3e4jgn,trollshep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:42:46 2015 UTC,What a great move!  Will he be the 2nd keeper or the number 1?
Aleague,3e4jgn,Mathazad,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:49 2015 UTC,"Based on comments I see so far, he will be #1 for now until the other keeper comes back, after that it is as good a guess as anyone else's."

After the links with Liverpool and, er, Real Madrid, I was scared that he would move and barely play but now I am more confident in him. He will play, definitely till November/December as the other keeper is out till then, and it shall benefit both him and the national team in the process."

Interesting that we are linked with two forwards, but not Eli Babalj.  Jets are trialing a good number of players, passing on Ramsey shows that they are actually only taking the ones they want. Who would be left over n the big deals? Carney?  good time for them to rebuild with youth"
Aleague,3e545v,littlejib,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:22:55 2015 UTC,Who would be left over n the big deals? Carney?   Him and Lee Ki-je would be my guesses. Not that it's really a problem as they are both rather solid players.
Aleague,3e545v,SerTahu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:10:47 2015 UTC,It talks about Troisi being club-less but I thought he still had a year to run at Juventus and the only story I can find about him is one where he states that it's up to them to decide where he will play next. Did he get released?
Aleague,3e545v,Roger_Ramjet88,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:09 2015 UTC,o troisi come back to mumma marquee
Aleague,3e545v,Crazedvayne,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:05:32 2015 UTC,Vidosic to link up with his old man at MV?  No way I'd take him as marquee though. Only as a back up to Fink.
Aleague,3e545v,ShrimpinAintEazy,4,Wed Jul 22 04:23:52 2015 UTC,"Couldn't see Vidosic accepting bench status. I wouldn't mind having him at the Roar, but he certainly would be a luxury as we have decent midfield options as it is anyway.   Perth, Newcastle and the Mariners could all probably use him though. Maybe even the Westies."
Aleague,3e545v,ShrimpinAintEazy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:53:55 2015 UTC,"He would be super handy for us if we want a decent tilt at the ACL. We need more quality Australian players.   Maybe we could change our formation to suit him, and have him play next to Fink with only one DM (Valeri) but I don't think that'll happen."
Aleague,3e4zpf,notbilbo,6,Wed Jul 22 00:20:29 2015 UTC,I'm saddened by Matteo's leave. His interview after the ACL final is touching and shows what he's been through. Best of luck mate

Aleague,3e4zpf,aninstituteforants,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:21:31 2015 UTC,Would this massive exodus have anything to do with the players attitude to playing under Poppa? Can any WSW fans shed light?
Aleague,3e4zpf,farinafire,0,Wed Jul 22 01:14:34 2015 UTC,I would say its more about rebuilding the team to suit different tactics.
Aleague,3e4zpf,murseglen,2,Wed Jul 22 01:31:27 2015 UTC,"After last season, rebuilding is the imperative. A new squad with a proper pre-season and no ACL commitments will be good for the club. Gives Poppa a chance to prove that he can learn and succeed as a manager, not just one who's one tactic/formation worked a treat for two seasons.   That being said, fuck me we are short of players. I presumed there would still have been some use to Poljak. Then again I don't know who the targets are for the remaining foreign spots and who the locals are that'll be brought in. I haven't done a count but our total squad size must be about 15-16."
Aleague,3e4zpf,Zeezer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:28:57 2015 UTC,We have like 5 spots left. Teams like Newcastle are way shorter and it's rumoured they're not even planning on signing the maximum squad size
Aleague,3e4zpf,farinafire,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:33:06 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Here is the squad at the moment.
Aleague,3e4zpf,cynikles,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:31:59 2015 UTC,Mehbrahtu still on the books. When was the last time he actually hooked you up with a Gol-gol?
Aleague,3e4zpf,murseglen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:41:45 2015 UTC,He's played 25 minutes over 2 games in a season and a half. Spectacular signing.
Aleague,3e4zpf,cynikles,2,Wed Jul 22 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"Yeesh. Not great. From what I read on his wiki though, in his first game he got hacked down by Richard Garcia and has been pretty injured since. That's the impression I got. Still, you'd have to release him if you got the chance."
Aleague,3e4zpf,murseglen,2,Wed Jul 22 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ACL rupture in his first game. Recovered in time for round 27 this year. His time is now though, because Santa is the only other striker we have (i don't count Bridge fort obvious reasons)."
Aleague,3e4zpf,murseglen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:57:30 2015 UTC,"Kalmar still doesn't have a club, and I think in Jan-Mar he was one of our best players."
Aleague,3e3k5k,condon13,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"No pressure for any of our guns,  but I would love to see one player to become elite, higher than Kewell.  There are a few, Danny seems most likely."

Aleague,3e21cu,RedendBlack,3,Tue Jul 21 10:20:24 2015 UTC,i bet as soon as sterling scored they rushed to get one going knowing a fk load of people will tune in
Aleague,3e21cu,TetsuoSama,3,Tue Jul 21 11:52:15 2015 UTC,I'm old enough to remember when Channel 7 did this a while ago.  My comment about them also holds true for Channel 9 (as anyone who remembers Channel 9's 2002 World Cup coverage will testify).   These turkeys should never be considered for broadcast rights.   They just don't respect the game.
Aleague,3e21cu,1k988,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:14 2015 UTC,I remember when Seven had the rights to the Socceroos games in the early 2000's and they would slip in one commercial when the ball went out for a goal kick. Just horrible.
Aleague,3e21cu,vhsvhsvhs,5,Wed Jul 22 00:19:51 2015 UTC,Is it because it's the ICC and some clause in the broadcasting maybe? I didn't watch Adelaide v Liverpool but I don't recall seeing any mid game ads during the Brisbane game.

Aleague,3e14fh,Row86,10,Tue Jul 21 04:30:54 2015 UTC,"Domestic stars should be to 10 titles, like they are elsewhere. And probably for league titles rather than finals"
Aleague,3e14fh,littlejib,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:22 2015 UTC,What about just for the ACL? I feel like the winner of that should get something.

Aleague,3e14fh,Clareto,3,Tue Jul 21 05:26:03 2015 UTC,Away kit looks like those old school kit templates the A-League used to use.
Aleague,3e14fh,alvinng,4,Tue Jul 21 05:40:08 2015 UTC,I actually don't mind it. Looks very good and classic. The dark blue trimming on the neckline and sleeves provides a good contrast. The only thing that's a bit of an eye sore is the web jet logo. Well done Puma!
Aleague,3e14fh,jniko,2,Tue Jul 21 05:51:40 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't brag, but definitely can't complain.  Some little thoughts:   I'm taking some solace in the stupid WebJet logo being toned down a bit in size (but it is still stupid). I'm not a fan of having the A-League emblem on the players chest. Makes every kit look a bit rugby league-y. That being said, I understand that there's probably some financial value in saving the sleeve real estate for sponsors. The little opera house on the back is a very neat little touch."

Aleague,3e14fh,littlejib,7,Tue Jul 21 04:14:50 2015 UTC,"We won another champions league, so would be entitled to have a gold star though"
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-5,Tue Jul 21 04:30:42 2015 UTC,which one?
Aleague,3e14fh,littlejib,12,Tue Jul 21 04:34:50 2015 UTC,"Oceanic, you were probably there for that"
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-8,Tue Jul 21 04:35:21 2015 UTC,"lol yes, what a day that was"
Aleague,3e14fh,Awkward_Stepho,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:39 2015 UTC,"I believe that a silver star represents A-League championship wins (whish is why it has a 2 in it), while a gold star is for Asian Championship wins."
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-4,Tue Jul 21 04:20:35 2015 UTC,How come there were no stars on last years jersey?
Aleague,3e14fh,PidgeyIsOP,7,Tue Jul 21 04:21:22 2015 UTC,Because this was only implemented for the start of the 2015/16 season. Source
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-8,Tue Jul 21 04:30:24 2015 UTC,I guess its coming to that time in between championships that people need to be reminded of the success in the better sydney fc days.
Aleague,3e14fh,PidgeyIsOP,9,Tue Jul 21 04:33:44 2015 UTC,"I mean it's not just Sydney getting them. All teams that have won a title get the stars. Aka Sydney, Newcastle, Melbourne, Brisbane, Central Coast, Western Sydney and Adelaide (FFA). This is a regular honour in all of football to show off the achievements of a club. Do you think WSW will remove the gold star because they have failed to repeat their success in Asia? No, because that would be stupid."
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-6,Tue Jul 21 04:40:36 2015 UTC,Please leave with your logical thinking and well thought out answers.  No but all jokes aside I know why it is being done and see the point in regards to honouring past champions. I was just bantering.

Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-8,Tue Jul 21 04:19:05 2015 UTC,Funny how you guys had no stars on the jersey last year. Maybe trying to piggy back on the addition of the star to the WSW jersey?
Aleague,3e14fh,so_much_wut,13,Tue Jul 21 04:19:55 2015 UTC,Maybe trying to piggy back on the addition of the star to the WSW jersey?   Is that why you changed your flair?
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-5,Tue Jul 21 04:23:35 2015 UTC,"No, but well played."
Aleague,3e14fh,littlejib,5,Tue Jul 21 04:25:24 2015 UTC,I doubt the wave of excitement over a star on your jersey kicked a jealously overdrive in our marketing department. We will see if other teams do it before we jump to conclusions
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-3,Tue Jul 21 04:25:45 2015 UTC,Give me one good reason why sydney fc would include a star with the number 2 on it for grand finals that were won more than 5 years ago.
Aleague,3e14fh,aninstituteforants,4,Tue Jul 21 04:28:03 2015 UTC,Because said they were allowed to?
Aleague,3e14fh,littlejib,4,Tue Jul 21 04:31:12 2015 UTC,"No one has had stars before, maybe they have only been allowed from now.   Or our new manufacturer does stars and our old one didnt"
Aleague,3e14fh,suicidal_smrtcar,3,Tue Jul 21 04:33:07 2015 UTC,I find it funny how you are trying to shit on Sydney FC already even though you only changed over in the last month.   At least give it half a season before you whip out the #fullysickbantz.
Aleague,3e14fh,PooDiePie,2,Tue Jul 21 08:09:05 2015 UTC,It probably represents the loyalty of fans. Their love for the club is as everlasting as a shining star in the night.
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:00:36 2015 UTC,Lol. Time to move on. I sure have.
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-9,Tue Jul 21 05:03:29 2015 UTC,massive change from last year. I hope this doesnt polarise their fan base.
Aleague,3e14fh,aninstituteforants,18,Tue Jul 21 04:05:20 2015 UTC,The players should have modelled it with Balaclavas.
Aleague,3e14fh,farinafire,-7,Tue Jul 21 04:09:35 2015 UTC,thats just pretending to be something you are not. Maybe some take away coffee cups in their hands would have accentuated the colours in that sky blue jersey.
Aleague,3e14fh,aninstituteforants,8,Tue Jul 21 04:10:52 2015 UTC,Didn't you use to support Sydney? Did you instantly stop drinking coffee or something?

Aleague,3e1mlf,cynikles,3,Tue Jul 21 11:03:53 2015 UTC,Wow..I really want to know how WSW are padding our their squad with all these released players. I suppose they're just going to promote half the youth-team?   Three foreign players to sign in addition to Andreu and Castelen if this is true too. Should be a pretty interesting off-season for the Wanderers.

Aleague,3e1mlf,CheapTrick32,2,Tue Jul 21 09:17:21 2015 UTC,Don't mind seeing Haliti go but I think we will miss Poljak. The club better be working overtime to fill in these gaps though.
Aleague,3e1mlf,bamboosaou,2,Tue Jul 21 09:31:58 2015 UTC,Talk about a massive clean out. Haliti I won't mind but Poljak is quite the loss for us. The sooner we get replacements the better.

Loved or loathed he has now become a Wanderer and it is this divisive persona that will add an impact to the Wanderers side.  When the Western Sydney Wanderers announced the signing of Mitch Nichols it did not take long for social media to explode.  ...the midfielder’s calm and relaxed interview style.  He described his career so far as continually “progressing” but one could also perceive it as continually accelerating.  When questioning Nichols himself on his on-field persona he stated that he sees himself as both “competitive and frustrated”.  “I think it is just because I am laidback and I don’t have the best body language on the field.  “Maybe I am just misunderstood.”  “Obviously it’s good to play for the national team but just playing professional football has been the proudest moment in my life so far.”   ...and I don't even think Nichols will be the worst signing of 2015
Aleague,3dx9en,farinafire,2,Mon Jul 20 14:12:19 2015 UTC,How many games have you seen holosko play? I have seen him in about five games while playing for besiktas.

Aleague,3dxdm6,Mello-D,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:23:23 2015 UTC,"Brisbane didn't threaten anywhere near as much as Adelaide. Seemed to lack a bit of cohesion? Adelaide played a lot of nice one-twos through the Liverpool midfield, Brisbane were more trying to chase long balls and beat their man one-on-one down the wings.  Overall, a largely similar performance. I'd give Brisbane a 5/10 and Adelaide a 7/10, but the difference was only in spells, Brisbane were more consistent."
Aleague,3dxdm6,jrowls,3,Mon Jul 20 10:39:04 2015 UTC,I have the game on in the background and didn't notice liverpool had scored until just then because the noise the crowd made was so quiet.

That means you can guarantee Mabil has been signed because he's recorded good numbers in the statistics they capture (dribbles, take-ons, I'd imagine)."
Aleague,3dvswm,timhpal,6,Mon Jul 20 00:14:55 2015 UTC,"In addition to the statistics, FC Midtjylland has Denmark's best youth academy and are really high on developing youngsters. The team that won the league last season was incredibly young and have already had players linked with top clubs like Ajax.  You really couldn't ask for a better place to go as a promising young player."
Aleague,3dvswm,tbkh91,4,Mon Jul 20 01:46:25 2015 UTC,Interesting! Do you know of they make any account for league standard (e.g. I'd imagine than 5 successful dribbles in the EPL would be worth more than 5 in league 2)
Aleague,3dvswm,Walkerthon,5,Mon Jul 20 00:59:52 2015 UTC,I'm sure they would account for such things

Aleague,3dvswm,suicidal_smrtcar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"Might be counting it as up front fee, not potential based on add ons. Isn't de Silva fee dependent on a whole heap of performance factors as well?"

Aleague,3dvswm,Franneboy,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"He's a pacey right attacking midfielder. He's not afraid to try to take defenders on and has pretty decent shooting capabilities. I do feel his crossings need a bit of work, however. I think he should be able to develop into a fantastic player as he gets older.  Video of some of his best moments."
Aleague,3dvswm,AussieGuy96,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds like someone who would thrive in our system. He probably wont be in the starting XL right away since he'll have to take time away from Pione Sisto whom coincidentally is also a South Sudanese refugee. Mabil seems to be where Sisto was a year or two ago, so he'll be an interesting player to watch when we eventually sell Sisto."
Aleague,3dvswm,Franneboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:48:59 2015 UTC,He's a big loss to Adelaide. He's had that super-sub x-factor at Adelaide.  You'd bring him on in the 70th and he'd always create chances and scored quite a few crucial goals at the death.
Aleague,3dvswm,GAZZY75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:19:07 2015 UTC,So he was only a sub for Adelaide? Then it sounds like we're really taking a chance on him.

He was one of our most exciting players skill wise, and was growing as a player. He is a regular with the young National side too.  I think he'll do pretty well for you if developed right."

Aleague,3dq0e7,-Volumes_,9,Sat Jul 18 11:27:14 2015 UTC,"No, they had these Tag Heuer time countdowns on the scoreboards from 10 seconds at the 45 and 90 minute. Kinda lame considering injury time just meant the game kept playing. It's like someone who never saw a bloody football match in their life came up with the idea and thought the match would actually finish when the countdown did. So dumb."

Aleague,3dq0e7,Azza_,5,Sat Jul 18 09:47:59 2015 UTC,That a Mexican wave started after about half an hour sums up this match really.
Aleague,3dq0e7,CMDReffsea,6,Sat Jul 18 10:26:53 2015 UTC,Even the commentators are pointing out the crowd's lack of enthusiasm. That says it all.

Aleague,3dq0e7,Azza_,3,Sat Jul 18 11:36:29 2015 UTC,I'm surprised there weren't any italian chants. Plus they've killed the active end in the bernabeu ages ago.
Aleague,3dq0e7,LarryLawyer,3,Sat Jul 18 12:40:59 2015 UTC,MCG pitch looked pretty woeful aswell
Aleague,3dq0e7,GeorgeDyer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:31:00 2015 UTC,Letting a massive crowd on the ground the day before wasn't exactly a brilliant idea.
Aleague,3dq0e7,CaptainLipto,3,Sun Jul 19 08:55:59 2015 UTC,I was pretty happy with the first half but there second half was a bit of a drag when they took gervinho off. I expected a worse game honestly and it was nice to see those teams in the flesh. If anything this will make me more determined to travel to Europe some day for the higher intensity and a good crowd atmosphere that isn't filled with football casuals.
Aleague,3dq0e7,spetznatz,2,Sun Jul 19 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's no substitute for a European home game. I was lucky enough to go to a game at Camp Nou a few years back. I was surrounded by families with 5 year olds chanting ""Xavi"" and it was awesome. Messi had a quiet game but hey, can't have everything."
Aleague,3dq0e7,littlejib,8,Sun Jul 19 03:44:12 2015 UTC,"I've heard more noise at lawn bowls! Bloody pathetic!  If the goal of the ICC was to promote soccer in this country, then this is not helping, the MCG is never quiet and yet, even with Real and Roma playing there, it is tonight!"
Aleague,3dq0e7,freeriderau,6,Sat Jul 18 09:35:18 2015 UTC,When Liverpool played here it was loud as fuck. Dont know whats wrong tonight. It is really cold tonight here in Melbourne so that might be a issue.

Aleague,3dq0e7,okgoo12,6,Sat Jul 18 13:38:33 2015 UTC,"Victory is a home club, unlike Real or Roma  Liverpool has a substantial supporter base in Melbourne, unlike Real or Roma, and by this I mean loyal supporters that care and have a connection to the club, not band-wagoners and casuals.  Tonight was a very different dynamic to the Victory v Liverpool game.  I was there tonight and hoping for a Roma win, but to be honest, wasn't so involved and I don't know one Roma song or one word of Italian (apart from ""fanculo""). I think most people had the same experience. I think this is why it was quiet."
Aleague,3dq0e7,TheFightingImp,3,Sat Jul 18 18:11:51 2015 UTC,"I went to a Roma game at Stadio Olimpico earlier this year, and you'd be happy to know you'd be right at home with just the usage of that one word. One of the funniest experiences of my life, sitting in the middle of a bunch of grumpy chain smokers screaming obscenities at anything and everything."
Aleague,3dq0e7,imwatters,5,Sat Jul 18 12:42:50 2015 UTC,"Promote soccer in this country? Please, this tournament is designed to gouge as much money as possible from families who watch EPL and Champions League and casual fans who play FIFA. I don't know why fans expect 'European style atmospheres', we have no emotional or local attachment to these clubs."
Aleague,3dq0e7,TheFightingImp,4,Sat Jul 18 18:23:08 2015 UTC,If one of the teams play was epl then itll be alot better.

Aleague,3dg93m,PooDiePie,4,Thu Jul 16 10:38:38 2015 UTC,"Just came back from a Gold Coast trip. I'm a bit of a theme park nut so here goes:  Sea World was surprisingly good considering they got rid of the Corkscrew (Sea Viper). I was surprised by how good the theme is for Storm, and Jet Rescue (which has been closed for maintenance for all of my last 3 visits) was a lot faster than I expected it to be. The sea lion and dolphin shows were both really good. I was surprised I got a full day of entertainment, I expected to be packing after lunch to head to Movie World, but I found myself just relaxing at Sea world for the entire day.  Dreamworld certainly has a full day's worth of activities, but I don't think they do a very good job at any of them. Wipeout's refurbishment looks great and is an exception. All of the rides are fun, but I really need some good theming to go along with that to complete the experience. Dreamworld also lacks a proper circuit roller coaster (Cyclone doesn't cut it) and they don't have a proper family dark ride (like Scooby Doo at Movie World).  Movie World was in good running order. Though you can usually finish everything quickly (even with long queues) the completeness of their attractions is second to none in Australia. Scooby Doo, Wild West Falls and Justice League are all in good condition and provide an immersive family experience. Arkham Asylum is great, with the ride operators wearing jumpsuits and pretending to be insane.   The new Hollywood Stunt Driver 2  show was disappointing. They really need to have a complete rethink, because I could watch the same thing in a Macca's carpark in Western Sydney.  I feel like Superman Escape, though it still remains the best ride in the country, is lacking in the theming department. It's a sort of bland, dark concrete tunnel with a few elements of a subway, which after riding the new Storm at Sea World and seeing the brilliant set design for that ride, Superman felt a bit bland. However, the ride itself certainly makes up for the boring theme. The launch is so fast, and the airtime hills are so good, you forget about where you were 30 seconds earlier.  Movie World is kinda suffering from Green Lantern's downtime while they fix that ride up. It's still my favourite park in the country nonetheless."
Aleague,3dg93m,Meapa,2,Thu Jul 16 04:17:25 2015 UTC,"I could watch the same thing in a Macca's carpark in Western Sydney.   Well, any stunt driving show is useless when you put it up against that."
Aleague,3dg93m,PooDiePie,2,Thu Jul 16 04:47:03 2015 UTC,"Haha, the drivers were clearly better than your average bogan with a 350kW commodore. But you need something more than that to make it a proper show."
Aleague,3dg93m,timmmy8,2,Thu Jul 16 04:54:12 2015 UTC,"I went earlier in the year with a pile of mates and largely agree with you. I feel Movie World could benefit from another ride or two, especially with all the coming movies in the DC Universe."
Aleague,3dg93m,so_much_wut,2,Thu Jul 16 04:52:13 2015 UTC,Dreamworld = quantity. Movie World = quality. I'll take the latter any day. Plus unlimited access to SeaWorld and Wet'n'Wild with the season pass means Dreamworld's gonna have to go big to get me in the gate anytime soon.
Aleague,3dg93m,cymonster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:03:58 2015 UTC,Are they still trying to fix the green lantern after the wheel fell off? I feel like australian parks are good but you cant compare them to the major theme parks in the world. They always seem to be lacking that one thing that the major ones have.
Aleague,3dg93m,PooDiePie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:44:58 2015 UTC,"Rumour is that Green Lantern will be opened up in September. A bit of a scary situation but all of the failsafes worked well and no one was hurt because of that.  Australian Parks are held back by two things. We are so far from the major ride manufacturers, so getting rides built (bringing people from Europe, shipping steel parts etc.) is really expensive. Also, manual labour workers cost significantly more here than in other parts of the world.  I'm definitely happy with what we've got though, but I would like a proper park with Roller Coasters in Sydney to go with the new Wet'n'Wild. The Wild Mouse, as historic as it is, doesn't quite cut it."
Aleague,3dg93m,cymonster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:22:01 2015 UTC,I know we get held back by the ride companies etc. but I think it has something to do more with the parks not really wanting to spend money on rides that don't really bump attendance alot. A sydney park would be great (wish that wonderland had been kept open as i was just a little to small to ride the big wooden coaster) but I doubt one will be made soon.
Aleague,3dg93m,PooDiePie,2,Mon Jul 20 15:15:06 2015 UTC,"It think that's also part of it. The public aren't asking for any more, so the parks won't build anything more."

That's why Victory did one last season. I don't see why it's not a legitimate point though. We have no money. We need some.

What you wanna say is  There will be a W-League game on Foxtel before the Mens A-League fixture. Is it at the same ground? or at another ground/stadium?  Note membership for Melb City gives access to W-League matches, so if they're at the same ground that is a pretty useless point to make.  If they are at different grounds as curtain raisers then how do you expect to get both Mens and Ladies matches in. I'd say it's a curtain raiser like the reserves used to be for A/VFL games."

Aleague,3d7vee,alvinng,4,Tue Jul 14 05:15:39 2015 UTC,I know. Good to have options. Hopefully the days of playing our left wingers (like Ramsay and Garuccio last season) as fullbacks are finally over.   We have Clisby and Hughes as backup to Zullo and Franjic. Wonder where that leaves Hoffman.
Aleague,3d7vee,alvinng,8,Tue Jul 14 05:21:53 2015 UTC,Hopefully as far from the starting line up as possible.
Aleague,3d7vee,ragsta,2,Tue Jul 14 05:23:46 2015 UTC,That made me laughed. Harsh statement from you but had to be said though.
Aleague,3d7vee,alvinng,0,Tue Jul 14 05:36:18 2015 UTC,"Why would you assume Chapman is starting ahead of Hughes? Chapman was terrible last season, it would be weird to sign a guy with almost 100 caps for Northern Ireland only for him to be a back up."
Aleague,3d7vee,AgentEucalyptus,5,Tue Jul 14 06:00:21 2015 UTC,"Terrible? I tell you who was terrible.   Robbie Wielaert. Although you might beg to differ seeing that he literally passes balls to Sydney players for them to stroll into goal.  Chapman was leaps and bounds better when he came in to replace Wielaert even though he did have some fiery moments. Kid needs to keep his temper in check but he was faster, reads the game well and actually compliments Kisnorbo.  The only reason I see Chapman starting over Hughes in CB is that it might be a bad idea to have a 34 year old Kisnorbo and 35 year old Hughes as our starting CBs.  But hey what do I know? I've only watched City's every game last season."
Aleague,3d7vee,alvinng,4,Tue Jul 14 07:41:17 2015 UTC,"Then it should be Kisnorbo being worried, by your logic."
Aleague,3d7vee,AgentEucalyptus,2,Tue Jul 14 09:59:09 2015 UTC,Well I'm not sure JVS would drop the captain anytime soon. Kisnorbo does dive into tackles a little too much for my liking but I guess that's his style of play.
Aleague,3d7vee,alvinng,3,Tue Jul 14 10:06:46 2015 UTC,That makes it hard but it doesn't sound like he's going to drop any of his older CBs then.
Aleague,3d7vee,effsee,3,Tue Jul 14 11:07:13 2015 UTC,And moving Mooy to the AU marquee spot would be a great move. The guy totally deserves it.
Aleague,3d7vee,fidrildid6,2,Tue Jul 14 05:12:15 2015 UTC,"Would Zullo really be signing on for less than Mooy is making. I dunno, that would be strange. I would've guessed that Franjic and even Kisnorbo would be on more money."
Aleague,3d7vee,cynikles,3,Tue Jul 14 07:29:47 2015 UTC,Oh my god we have fullbacks.

Victoria has plenty of youngster that would jump at the chance to be considered for a position in the A-League. NYL players don't necessarily have to be locally produced.

Aleague,3d3e51,cynikles,2,Mon Jul 13 05:31:24 2015 UTC,It's a bit of an underwhelming signing but so was Kew Jaliens and he was a hit so it remains to be seen. My major qualm is his age though it's unlikely he'll be here more than a year.
Aleague,3d3e51,alvinng,6,Mon Jul 13 05:37:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was so bummed when Jaliens signed because of his age but he turned out to be one of our better players in the second half of the season.  I wonder if it means our back four would be Hughes, Kisnorbo, Chapman and Franjic. Pretty decent I guess?  Although not sure about a 35 year old as a full back though...then again Jaliens played as RB a couple of times and did well."

It's not like they were entirely unfamiliar in the role, just too slow.   Playing Hughes at left-back seems kinda dumb to me.

Aleague,3d3e51,Kamoner,-3,Mon Jul 13 07:32:00 2015 UTC,That goal against WSW and his assured performances after returning from injury in a league lacking good centre halves will do it for us instead.

Aleague,3d3e51,Kamoner,-1,Tue Jul 14 03:56:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think Villa demonstrated world class at all.  Turned up horribly late, didn't take it seriously, looked like he couldn't have given any less of a fuck, and ran off with his tail between his legs leaving City in the lurch. The attitude was shit and I can't really think of any positive way to spin it.  Compare to Delpierre who's just gone and been one of the best defenders in the league after injury - you can really see that pedigree. Compare even to Petkovic, Marinkovic, Isaias, Faty, Duff, Novillo. No, Villa was one of the worst imports last year for sure."
Aleague,3d3e51,alvinng,2,Tue Jul 14 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"'positive' attitude or not, he is still quite clearly a world class player. delpierre is not. attitudes have absolutely nothing to do with it. I hope this is still not too confusing for you"
Aleague,3d3e51,Kerrby,0,Tue Jul 14 06:04:41 2015 UTC,To be world class you have to have an effect on the pitch.  He didn't. Many other imports performed better. You're only as good as your last result.  I hope this is sufficiently clear for you that I don't have to keep restating my points :)

If they did do that/didn't need to do that then he looks 100% eligible. If they didn't but they should've then I think the decision was technically correct.

He's an Australian citizen for visa purposes, he's at a very good age and he might want a change of pace from slogging it out in the English lower leagues. I mean, we get plenty of foreign players that come here for a change or for whatever reason, can't see why Kilkenny couldn't otherwise be enticed."
Aleague,3d2fuk,cynikles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:02:29 2015 UTC,"I just meant he would be coming here for a change, it wouldn't be like a Holland, Jedinak or Cahill returning 'home'. He lived in Brisbane from 4-11 and then his English family returned to England. He likely only played for Australia because he knew he'd never get a chance with England, that's not to say he's not Australian, but surely his feeling of home is not centred over here. Though the free visa spot would be enticing for Victory to go hard at him you're right.  I just think it would be like Duff coming here for a couple of years before returning home, rather than being a natural progression in his career returning home to Australia like it would for say Bresciano. That make sense?  This is just fan chatter isn't it, there hasn't been any genuine media connection with him?"
Aleague,3d2fuk,kiac,3,Mon Jul 13 07:20:04 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of Aussie pros that go overseas and don't come back as well, this is not really all that different. Sure, he's probably identity wise, English, but Australia is a viable option for him if the money is right. It wouldn't be a home coming but it really doesn't need to be. It'd be like signing Samaras who was born in Greece and lived their all his life, but has an Australia grandfather. Only difference is he didn't choose the Socceroos.   I know what you're getting at but I really don't see the issue. The fact that he is a non-visa player makes him attractive, who gives a stuff if he feels more English culturally? That's not the point. If he can offer something on the pitch that's why a club would want him.   And yes, I do believe it is nothing more than fan chatter."

I have no idea if it's possible though. I don't know if he will be open to returning to Australia at this point in his career.  We have also, reportedly, enquired about Kilkenny and Troisi. While I'm not as crash hot on these, as they may not fill the gap Milligan has left, they also seem like pretty good decisions if they are possible. Troisi will almost definitely not return as his Europe career is going well and he's still relatively young.  I don't believe the club will be interested in Bresciano, and I don't think anyone really wants him to play for us."

Vanuatu dominated early stages but Fiji settled in and both teams should have scored atleast 3 goals but wonderful goal keeping from both goal keepers. Commentators mentioned Vanuatu goalie had a trial with Stoke City which is pretty mad. I reckon he can make it into A league. He was superb made few key saves and saved a penalty.

Aleague,3d0522,timmmy8,5,Sun Jul 12 13:54:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the idea. The only form of 'split' season I think should ever be considered is a Scottish-style split when the A-League has twelve teams (because 22 rounds is too few, and in our market 33 would probably be too many).  In other words: with twelve teams, everyone plays each other twice for 22 rounds, then the table splits into two groups of six, playing each other once to bring it to 27 rounds total. If, with 12 teams, the finals are expanded to the top 8 teams, then the top half would be playing for home advantage while the bottom half plays for the last two finals spots."
Aleague,3d0522,SerTahu,4,Sun Jul 12 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"8 in 12 is way too many, surely. I don't like 6 as it is. 4 finals places in 12 would be cool, two legged semi finals and then a final."
Aleague,3d0522,JGQuintel,3,Sun Jul 12 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but unfortunately it's an easy and cheap way to keep games between teams low on the table interesting and important late in the season. In fact, if I had my way there wouldn't be a finals series at all, but that's what our market demands."
Aleague,3d0522,SerTahu,4,Sun Jul 12 19:52:16 2015 UTC,Japanese fans absolutely hate the split season. They would take the single table back right now if they could.  Typical FFA only looking to how World Football does things when it's unpopular.

Aleague,3d0522,Meapa,2,Sun Jul 12 11:28:00 2015 UTC,"For this to work,  we need more teams. 16 perhaps.  We won't get relegation soon, this may be next best.   Every league has dead games, even the EPL has heaps of teams who can't get relegated and who can't get into europe. They still find a way to keep it interesting."
Aleague,3d0522,wanderingrhino,2,Sun Jul 12 12:41:02 2015 UTC,"I would be more inclined to go with conferences rather then a split season if they were to go down this path, pretty much the same as the MLS.  If you are going to change something, then it needs to resonate with the fans and I don't think a split season will. I don't think there are enough fans out there who understand the split season concept and I highly doubt that it will go over well.  On the other hand, conferences may perhaps even things up a bit if there were more teams. Playing everyone in your conference twice and everyone in the other conference once will definitely help minimise meaningless games. Ie. Newcastle and Perth would only have to play each other once every year, as their aren't rivals and is not exactly a TV ratings bonanza.  You could probably do it right now with just 10 teams.

I know nothing of South American football so I'm just guessing. If that's what's up put me down as a no.  Edit: I think I've got it wrong.   Applied to the existing calender, a theoretical first season of 14 matches could take place between October 8 and January 10, while the second season, of 13 matches, may occur between January 15 and April 10, with the best teams of both seasons then facing off in the finals.

All of these things might matter somewhat, but I really need something that doesn't matter to take your mind off the serious things in life. Football is my escape route, and it hasn't failed me so far.  I find football brings out a lot more in me than my hobbies such as video games, cars, cooking, roller coasters (strange hobby I know) and music. Football is a completely different beast to all of my other hobbies because of just how much it can affect you as a person. This is why I would consider football to be much, much more than just a hobby. It is seriously emotionally challenging.  Football is much more rewarding than my other forms of escapism. I don't feel guilty after 'wasting time' attending a football match like I do when I waste time browsing the internet mindlessly, playing video games, partying etc.  My other hobbies are just things I do; football is a way that I live.  I love being a part of something that is bigger than myself. I enjoy the tribalism and the mob mentality. You may get these things in other sports but nowhere near the same extent as we see it in football. It is the capacity for football to become such an engrained part of my life that makes it my perfect scapegoat.  And I haven't even started on how the game actually works yet..."

Aleague,3cyvja,EnglishHooligan,4,Sun Jul 12 06:45:29 2015 UTC,"Once a week, the fan flees his house for the stadium.  Banners wave and the air resounds with noisemakers, firecrackers and drums; it rains streamers and confetti. The city disappears, its routine forgotten. All that exists is the temple. In this sacred place, the only religion without atheists puts its divinities on display. Although the fan can contemplate the miracle more comfortably on TV, he prefers to make the pilgrimage to this spot where he can see his angels in the flesh doing battle with the demons of the day.  Here the fan shakes his handkerchief, gulps his saliva, swallows his bile, eats his cap, whispers prayers and curses and suddenly lets loose a full-throated scream, leaping like a flea to hug the stranger at his side cheering the goal. While the pagan mass lasts, the fan is many. Along with thousands of other devotees he shares the certainty that we are the best, that all referees are crooked, that all our adversaries cheat.  Rarely does the fan say, ""My club plays today."" He says, ""We play today."" He knows it is ""player number twelve"" who stirs up the winds of fervor that propel the ball when she falls asleep, just as the other eleven players know that playing without their fans is like dancing without music.  When the match is over, the fan, who has not moved from the stands, celebrates his victory: ""What a goal we scored!"" ""What a beating we gave them!"" Or he cries over his defeat: ""They swindled us again."" ""Thief of a referee."" And then the sun goes down and so does the fan. Shadows fall over the emptying stadium. On the concrete terracing, a few fleeting bonfires burn, while the lights and voices fade. The stadium is left alone and the fan, too, returns to his solitude: to the I who had been we. The fan goes off, the crowd breaks up and melts away, and Sunday becomes as melancholy as Ash Wednesday after the death of Carnival.  -Eduardo Galeano"

The simplicity of the concept of the game makes it possible to play it in many different ways.  I'm a big cricket fan as well, so to me it's a bit like the way that each batsman is different in that sport. The elegance of a VVS Laxman or David Gower cover-drive vs the brute force of a Matthew Hayden straight-drive, or a Ricky Ponting pull shot, for example.  When you compare this to other sports that are usually more about pure athleticism the contrast is clear."

During the Scottish Cup semi final last year, it went to extra time but instead of showing extra time they showed the highlights of a rugby match from 4 years ago.

Aleague,3cx952,RedendBlack,8,Sat Jul 11 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"Won't get that many responses until a couple of hours since pretty much everyone is asleep.   My have asleep summary: he's had an alright NT record with 12 appearances only managing 2 goals (assisting our Asian Cup winning goal), he was an immense player for Western Sydney during  the 2013-14 A-league season and our ACL campaign, last season was not great for him mostly based off our lack of performance (league table in the sidebar) and he seemed very unmotivated but at only 23 years old he still has alot of potential too grow."
Aleague,3cx952,963479,5,Sat Jul 11 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"This assist sums up the best things about his game. The determination, strength and ability to do better than expected in tight spaces."
Aleague,3cx952,wanderingrhino,2,Sat Jul 11 22:30:08 2015 UTC,Excellent player dependant on the team system? How do Legia play?
Aleague,3cx952,wanderingrhino,2,Sat Jul 11 22:32:11 2015 UTC,"Well, last season we used to play a 4-2-3-1 with a false nine instead of a regular striker. It was working very well, and mostly because of great chemistry and interplay between our 10 and the false striker. However, then we sold our best player (Radović, the f9) and now our 10 is probably going to sign for Inter. Meanwhile, we already signed two big strikers this summer, so I assume we might try 4-4-2.  I think our manager (Henning Berg) is fond of forwards who can hold up and have a presence in the box.  Looking at the highlights from that ACL campaign, Jurić seems like a great player, would probably be useful for us.   Also, I think he'd be the first Australian playing in our league, so I'm very curious how it would work out"
Aleague,3cx952,963479,2,Sun Jul 12 06:39:38 2015 UTC,"No, michael Thwaite played in Poland. Wisla I think.   I'm glad Juric would be going to a big club in Polska, competition from many players,  great coaches."

Aleague,3cx952,angusozi,2,Tue Jul 14 09:21:47 2015 UTC,"He's good when he wants to be but can appear to be pretty unmotivated at times. However, during his best period at the wanderers he appeared to be very hungry to score and him, along with our goalkeeper at the time, pretty much won us the champions league.   When he's performing he has an accurate and powerful long shot as well as strong presence in the box in the case of crosses and corners. Not sure of the level of legia Warsaw but I think if he works hard he will perform."
Aleague,3cx952,rodz7,3,Sat Jul 11 16:57:22 2015 UTC,Hopefully this year Legia can fill the paper work out right for Uefa.

Aleague,3cwq8p,madzaman,4,Sat Jul 11 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"He would have an influence on the pitch, just not a huge one. He definitely isn't able to compete at international level any more, but the A-League isn't that level. I don't think he would be putting himself in line for any player of the year awards, but he would get the job done. That, combined with the fact that he is still a relatively big name in Australia and, therefore, would increase interest in any club that signs him, would probably make him worth signing for just about any A-League club."

There are deeply entrenched cultural sports in Australia that people like Conn feel are mightier than anything else. Sport is big business down under.  This guy built his career in cricket and the HAL is perceived to be taking money away.  There are only so many ways to cut a TV $$$ cake.  So he, being of an older generation,  feels twitter has some sort of weight. It doesnt. It is ephemeral noise, a clutter.  Hes preaching to the choir as well, the uninformed one eyed half wits.

New owners could be good, could be bad, I don't know, all I care about is what we do on the field as a team. I care about what I can control.

The private owners of the club at the time could not come up with the guaranteed cash flow for the first 3 seasons, which was something like $5m to establish plus $3m per year. These figures could be very wrong, happy to be corrected. From then to now, not much has changed in Wollongong football. The Wolves are public owned but have not got the cash for a new A-League, W-League and NYL team. Part of it is lack of a base plus WIN Stadium skinning them for game day hire. A great football nursery but not enough $$ in corporate hands to support a team."

Technically Wollongong and Canberra still have smaller populations than that, but it's worded in a way that implies 'areas with 500,000 definitely can sustain a club', as opposed to 'areas need to have 500,000 to sustain a club, if they don't have it we won't expand there'.

Aleague,3cmonp,littlejib,0,Thu Jul 9 10:36:45 2015 UTC,Wollongong will not get the crowds to support this and in five to ten years they will be gone.  I'd love them to have a team but I'm skeptical of its viability.
Aleague,3cmonp,TheNoveltyAccountant,7,Thu Jul 9 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"Care to elaborate on your reasoning? The Illawarra region has a comparable population to Wellington and Nescastle, both of whom usually have very sustainable attendance numbers (not including the latest Jets season, for obvious reasons), but unlike the other two it has a reputation for being a football heartland, with a long and proud history in the sport. I see no reason to think that they couldn't average ~10k or more."
Aleague,3cmonp,sixteen_weasels,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:09:16 2015 UTC,"From memory they had low crowd numbers and even south coast have low crowd numbers considering the lack of competing codes in the region. Seemingly low core supporter base. The Hawks get crowds when doing well but we're deserted when they were losing. It has a strong history but league is more popular,afl stocks are rising amongst juniors as well. They lack local players that seem to do well in drawing crowds as its a small town but that could go away with big name signings. Its a transient uni town with high unemployment so turnover and consistency is a problem not to mention cost. I just don't see it being that sustainable.  Fun fact: their old half time entertainment was a bunch of kids trying to pull the tail off a pedophile dressed like a wolf. I never won."
Aleague,3cmonp,sixteen_weasels,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:29:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly a much better answer than I was expecting, some interesting points there.  Is Wollongong really that much of a uni town? I didn't think the University of Wollongong was that big."
Aleague,3cmonp,TheNoveltyAccountant,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:10:07 2015 UTC,Haha I used to play juniors for them for years so have some knowledge of the region even though I no longer live there. It's not massive but has 20k students or so and from a report I read a while ago it had 25+% foreign students. I'm just cautious with these things as they can go belly up quickly.
Aleague,3cmonp,gripes23q,4,Thu Jul 9 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"And the unemployment rate is higher than the national average (9%, according to google).  However, according to the statistics I could find, the Illawarra has 450,000 people. UoW has 30,000 students. For the purpose of simplifying the maths let's assume that all the students are local and subtract that, so we get 420,000. 9% of the adult population is unemployed, and ~25% of the population are under 18. Let's assume that the number of children is the same between employed and unemployed people, and therefore adjust the unemployed rate to 12% to take the children of unemployed families into account. Subtracting that from the total population leaves ~370,000 people from employed families.  Using this figure (which technically underestimates the number of people that can possibly get tickets), to maintain a 10,000 attendance average they would need ~2.7% of the employed population (and their children) to turn up, which isn't unreasonable.  And if I don't discount people (because Newcaslte has an even larger uni population than Wollongong, and a similar unemployment rate), to get a 10k average attendance it's ~2.2%, or 1 in every 45.5 people, which is in the same ballpark as percentage of the population that the Mariners, Nix and Jets needed to average 7.5k, 8.5k and 9k respectively. That seems completely achievable. They wouldn't be the largest team in the league, but it shouldn't be too hard to make it work."
Aleague,3cmonp,TheNoveltyAccountant,0,Thu Jul 9 13:49:50 2015 UTC,I'm not doubting that it theoretically could work but the maths alone I'd far too simplistic to tell the story. I was providing merely a couple of many considerations that should be factored in and the analysis would be far more thorough than what my two second thought dump implied. I didn't intend to give the impression that I'd done more than that.

Aleague,3codcg,suicidal_smrtcar,2,Thu Jul 9 13:56:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly this whole thing stinks of the PFA playing politics just to get a massively over inflated share of the money.   I mean look at this:  PFA - ""Rather than a true revenue sharing model, where all revenue streams of the professional game are included...""  Apparently the PFAs idea of ""true revenue sharing"" is to have the players getting 30% of all revenue from memberships, tickets, sponsorship, merchandise etc on top of the TV money. It's fucking ridiculous, it's like they want the league to fail. On top of that how do you even work that out, most of these revenue streams continue throughout the year and the levels are different for each club. It's essentially getting rid of the salary cap if you do it on a team by team basis.   Normally i'm all for workers rights but this is crap by the PFA."

He expressed a desire to leave Sydney in the middle of last season due to the lack of first team football, so my guess is that his sudden change of heart was due to the promise of a place in the starting 11.  As for Scott McDonald, although he would be nice I suspect that he would need Marquee wages, and our Australian Marquee spot is already taken by Brosque.

Aleague,3cnlon,JuiceSpringsteen8,5,Fri Jul 10 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"We have a fair few players in this league who are just pace, Krishna very pacy, but manages to do well in this league, his dribbling is good, and he doenst stuff his chances. He would find a first team or rotation spot in any aleague team"
Aleague,3cnlon,littlejib,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:50:49 2015 UTC,Does he do a Gervinho? Good run and dribble and then end up screwing the end product?
Aleague,3cnlon,littlejib,4,Thu Jul 9 08:55:24 2015 UTC,He usually finishes pretty well. Rather dangerous really
Aleague,3cnlon,SerTahu,3,Thu Jul 9 09:09:05 2015 UTC,"I thought he had a fantastic season, and rate him quite highly. If he can continue his form, and link up well with Burn's replacement, then the Nix shouldn't have a problem getting off the ground this season."
Aleague,3cnlon,KennethKanniff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:10:17 2015 UTC,So far he did very well for Fiji against Nix in 2 friendlies they played in Fiji last week or so. Scored a goal and created lots of chances.  I hope he can keep going since his captain for Fiji and seems like his got a good head.
Aleague,3cnlon,Clareto,3,Thu Jul 9 09:15:42 2015 UTC,He's better than the last token Non-NZ OFC player Henry Fa'arodo
Aleague,3cnlon,freeriderau,2,Thu Jul 9 10:57:04 2015 UTC,and Benjamin Totori.
Aleague,3cnlon,Clareto,2,Fri Jul 10 02:06:37 2015 UTC,always seemed like the problem was that Herbert didn't set the team up in a way that allowed him freedom to go forward constantly? was he bad or just misused?
Aleague,3cnlon,Nelfoos5,2,Fri Jul 10 02:10:01 2015 UTC,Fairly similar to Roy Krishna just lacked the final product from what I remember. I'm sure Ricki didn't help either.
Aleague,3cnlon,Clareto,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:35:07 2015 UTC,He did a short stint at my club when we were in the Mainland league. One thing he did NOT lack was the end product. Left after half a season and still won the golden boot.
Aleague,3cnlon,Nelfoos5,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:43:32 2015 UTC,"Thought I might have been wrong, don't remember much seeing Totori too often. I guess that one fuck up when he tried to shoot instead of squaring it across for a tap-in stood out to me."
Aleague,3cnlon,Nelfoos5,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he's a striker, can you blame him?"
Aleague,3cnlon,blue_yellow_man,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:17:52 2015 UTC,"I loved Benji, he always made an impact when he was bought on but Herbert never gave him a fair chance. In a season where we lacked imagination, Herbert shafted the one player he had that could've given it."
Aleague,3cnlon,blue_yellow_man,2,Sun Jul 12 01:42:15 2015 UTC,He's bided his time (I remember him trialing with Fury before their first season) and made himself a valuable player. The coming season will be the test as to whether or not he'll go further. I'd happily have him at the Mariners this season.
Aleague,3cnlon,freeriderau,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:53:10 2015 UTC,Do you think his good enough to be in the Aussie team?
Aleague,3cnlon,freeriderau,3,Thu Jul 9 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"Probably not, then again I don't think Juric is good enough either."

Aleague,3cn3h0,madzaman,-7,Thu Jul 9 04:45:00 2015 UTC,Hahaha how the fuck did Mooy get in there
Aleague,3cn3h0,vendilion,6,Thu Jul 9 06:25:46 2015 UTC,Really? You don't think he was one of the best midfielders in the league last season?
Aleague,3cn3h0,murseglen,-1,Thu Jul 9 06:51:54 2015 UTC,Finkler is streets ahead of him and has a championship to show for it.
Aleague,3cn3h0,vendilion,7,Thu Jul 9 06:52:58 2015 UTC,"Give me a break /u/vendilion. A championship means nothing when this accolade is clearly related to individual performances over a season, otherwise the PFA team of the season would just be Melbourne Victory. If you look at their stats, Mooy had a much bigger impact than Finkler, and he didn't have the benefit of having MV's players around him."
Aleague,3cn3h0,Mello-D,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:51:20 2015 UTC,"i'd say Mooy mainly stood out because the rest of his team was so heavy in the season, finkler wasn't the only option or even the main option when playing the ball forward for victory (they really focus on the two wingers) which wasn't the case for city as the ball was played to him the majority of the time to push and that would've played a part in Mooy getting more opportunities to get higher stats than the fink; but i wouldn't say he is a higher quality player than finkler, well not yet anyway. Also in saying that i don't know how they pick the team of the season, if it's based on the best team or who's got the highest stats per position.."
Aleague,3cn3h0,Crazedvayne,5,Thu Jul 9 08:56:44 2015 UTC,I'm fairly sure this is who the players have voted for
Aleague,3cn3h0,littlejib,4,Thu Jul 9 09:16:28 2015 UTC,"That logic works both ways. Finkler was able to get so many assists because his team mates were making great runs and had good positioning. Mooy didn't have those players around him, yet he still made it work. Sure, he had the ball a lot more because he was the main outlet for most things for Melbourne City, but I think he would have had to work a lot harder to match and/or beat Finkler with a lot of last seasons statistics."
Aleague,3cn3h0,Mello-D,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:53:08 2015 UTC,So you think Finkler deserved the spot over Mooy?
Aleague,3cn3h0,Kerrby,-1,Thu Jul 9 09:01:37 2015 UTC,"if team of the year is as it sounds and it's to make a team with the best from each position then yes, if it's for who's had the biggest impact for their own team then no"
Aleague,3cn3h0,Crazedvayne,2,Thu Jul 9 09:07:48 2015 UTC,"Mate, it's given to who the players think it should be given to. They chose Mooy; end of story."

This company I'm in employs a lot of men and women with young families and there seems to be an understanding regarding leaving early if necessary or leaving at 6 on the dot.   I think my boss for example though stays on until 8 or 9 quite often. He's a very busy man though, only 2 steps down from the vice-president. There are others that I think are in the same boat, but I get the feeling people here are actually just busy. They're not just fucking around worrying about losing face, they actually have shit to do.   We deal with people across the world and you do need to stay on a bit later sometimes to talk to those people as well as iron out wrinkles.

I'd happily spend an extra 500 bucks if it meant I could still go to every Sydney home game in a season. If that means missing out on a holiday or something, sure. Better than just giving in and supporting your old team's arch rivals because the trip to the stadium is shorter.   If I simply didn't have the $500 to spend, I would just support my team from home, maybe only going to a few games per season.   I don't know why your rbb mates should accept your smurf-ass into their bay, unless they were all in the same boat as you but just happened to jump ship earlier."

Being switched on for when you need to make that rare save in a game is far more important imo. The best keepers in the world are the ones that have good defences in front of them and only make 5 saves a game.   You shipped the second most goals in the league last season, Reddy was just called into action more often because the guys in front of him weren't doing their job."

Aleague,3ci9cy,Kristorpha,2,Wed Jul 8 03:13:31 2015 UTC,John hall has improved but i havent seen enough of him recently to judge. What we saw a couple of years ago wasnt super promising though.

He's got a lot of development ahead of him, is playing for the youth NTs and I wouldn't be surprised if he usurps Reddy.  Wish I could've seen him be Eugene's successor, but that's John Hall's job now. Not entirely sure why the club had three keepers on senior contracts when it would save salary cap $ to have two on senior contracts and either call a junior/reserve keeper up to the seniors or sign an injury replacement should they need to, so smart move by both clubs."

Aleague,3cdv3v,flukus,2,Tue Jul 7 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"so a population ratio of 2.5:1 evens things out?  To be fair, that sounds preposterous.   I'm no sherlock, but I think a 46-0 scoreline might be due to something more than just national population.    If we were talking about countries with populations of 100,000,000 and 250,000,000 and they both put large resources into their programs, then you might have an argument.

Players kicking on after awful injuries tend to really be hindered by them. A lot of our best players have had career blighted by injuries. Kewell was amazing at Leeds before getting crocked, Okon was a revelation at Brugge before having injuries, Zelic played at Dortmund early on before he drifted off into obscurity and Rizzo was rated better than Kewell in the day, and never got over his problems with injury. Viduka as well may have scaled larger heights as well if not for continuous niggles.   I'm sure that there is something we do to our players when they're developing that buggers them up.

In both games he has played further back the pitch in a centre mid box to box position, rather then in the No. 10 role. Very impressive passing range and is always looking to be positive and go forward. He made a few key passes and runs that lead to chances and goals, and as always easily beat his man and another couple. What always impresses me is how confident and comfortable he is on the ball. Can't wait to see him back in the Australian jersey. Luongo, Rogic and Antonis look like an impressive midfield three in coming years."

Well current top candidates for the next team seem to be Wollongong/South Sydney, Canberra, North Queensland and Geelong. Maybe even Hobart.  On paper Hobart and Canberra seem like the logical choices, but I'm thinking the two most like now are North Queensland, and then either Canberra or South Sydney/Wollongong. Geelong/South Melbourne not far behind.  The FFA have obviously been testing the waters down here, what with having a couple of Sydney FC games down here and the Young Socceroos/A-League All-Stars down here too, so those are some promising signs. Also, WIN Stadium is largely unused too. The Dragons play 4 games a year down here and then the other only notable team seems to be the Wolves themselves who play their home games there (which attract crowds of about 500-2000 last I saw, 8000 in our FFA cup game vs CCM).   As such I dont think crowd figures would be a huge problem, I feel we would regularly get 10k+ to games, 4-6k on a bad night. Not too different from CCM or Jets. Wollongong has a big football community too, with a decent amount of top players coming out from around here (Gameiro, Wilkshere are a couple). We would also attract fans from Sutherland/Engadine area of Sydney too.   I think our biggest problem is money. Getting some good sponsorship would be critical I feel, also maintaining some decent form/decent squad so crowd figures don't dwindle too low. I think we could make a great team though.  The only next thing to see is how a Wollongong/South Sydney team would affect Sydney FC as we would definitely pull a few of their members away (including myself), though not to the extent that the Wanderers did.  Soo uh, I dont think that answered anything but that's my current thoughts I guess!"

Aleague,3c712q,JuiceSpringsteen8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:20:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the mayor of Ipswich said ""We have no interest in a stadium, an Ipswich team can just play at Suncorp on alternate weekends."""
Aleague,3c712q,SerTahu,4,Mon Jul 6 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"What kind of hamfisted moron wouldn't want 2 sporting codes to play in their city, in what would become almost instantly 2 of the biggest rivalries in each code?"
Aleague,3c712q,sixteen_weasels,3,Mon Jul 6 05:01:16 2015 UTC,"Please FFA. Make it happen. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an Ipswich team, but given the recent comments by their mayor (""I don't want a new stadium, they can play at Suncorp on alternate weekends to the Roar""), Wolves + Canberra United would be the best combination.  EDIT: Or it could be a simple rebranding.  EDIT 2: One of the banner slides on their website, which explains the new logo, repeatedly says things along the lines of 'if the Wolves have a team in the A-League', and they did retweet this:. Basically the only thing they don't have is an official statement confirming that they're pushing for an A-League licence :P."

Aleague,3c712q,gripes23q,2,Mon Jul 6 06:06:20 2015 UTC,I could swear I've seen this logo before... Perhaps on the 442 forums where some photoshop-savvy guys have done some mock-ups.
Aleague,3c712q,SerTahu,4,Mon Jul 6 00:31:56 2015 UTC,Haha yeah that was me. I created it originally as a hobby project and they ended up using it :D
Aleague,3c712q,GeorgeDyer,3,Mon Jul 6 02:32:27 2015 UTC,"That's because you probably have. It seems they reached out to this guy and, with a few minor tweaks, agreed to use his logo. It's a rather cool gesture on the part of the Wolves, imo.  EDIT: It seems the man himself beat me to it :P."
Aleague,3c712q,SerTahu,3,Mon Jul 6 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"I love that they did that. For every sport, it always seems like the websites of these kinds of people have far far better designs for logos and kits, than what teams end up using. It's frustrating."
Aleague,3c712q,ODABBOTT,3,Mon Jul 6 02:56:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although I am of the (minority) opinion that, now that the Roar and Heart have rebranded, most of the logos in the A-League are good. They're not brilliant, and rather unimaginative, but they work. The one major exception would be the Mariners, who I really hope change their logo to this."

Aleague,3c712q,SerTahu,3,Mon Jul 6 01:43:36 2015 UTC,We need to introduce some sort of depth in our league for it to grow. We need to create a relegation and promotion approach with the A-League and first grade PL1 teams.
Aleague,3c712q,Meapa,18,Sun Jul 5 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"We need to financially ruin our system.   FTFY. Don't get me wrong, I really hope they introduce promotion/relegation at some point. Just not any time soon. I don't see promotion/relegation even having a chance of being financially viable for at least another 15 years."
Aleague,3c712q,Juan_Fandango,2,Sun Jul 5 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"The main problem is that the clubs we are wanting to bring in, probably don't have the kind of money to be flying to Perth, NZ and other interstate places every week.

Aleague,3c712q,aderybro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:02:17 2015 UTC,Oh god please. As long as the financial viability side of it is worked out I'd be absolutely stoked. Finally a team to care about.
Aleague,3c712q,SerTahu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:43:58 2015 UTC,"I'm probably wrong here, but with the logos primary colours being red and black i would also assume their kit colours would be the same. Wouldn't FFA have a problem with them having those colours on their kits just like how city weren't allowed sky blue since Sydney FC already had it?"
Aleague,3c712q,Pearly27,2,Mon Jul 6 02:50:18 2015 UTC,"Although often the case, logo colours aren't always indicative of kit colours. Take Adelaide, for example: their logo is mostly white yet there is no white on their kit. The Jets logo is also mostly blue and red, yet they competed with a gold kit for years (and, unfortunately, it looks like they're going back to that). I imagine that the Wolves would still compete under their traditional red and white if they join the A-League."
Aleague,3c712q,SerTahu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, we'll likely pick up red-and-white, or just a plain red kit with white trim like the Steelers had. Can't see us wearing red and black."
Aleague,3c712q,Pearly27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:12:30 2015 UTC,"I imagine that, should they get into the A-League, either the shorts will be white or there will be significant white trim. A mostly plain red kit would be highly unlikely, as they would want/need to differentiate themselves from Adelaide."
Aleague,3c712q,aderybro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"True, but I can't see them playing in Heart-style red-and-white stripes. I'll be interested to see their planned kit (which I assume will be announced relatively soon.)"

Not only A league or possible Socceroos games but W League games and hopefully Matildas games.   I love the idea that if she does end up loving the game as much as me she be able to grow up without having to view it as something just for young boys to aspire to.

Aleague,3c5ez2,angusozi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"I think quite a few of them are these days. From what I've seen of Tommy Oar, he's waiting really patiently for his next move. He's looking for the best move for him personally, not necessarily a prestigious one.   Luongo chose first-team football with a familiar staff over going to the Premier League and being a squad player.   Tomi Juric knocked back offers to play in China to look at his options in Europe. (I hope this doesn't come back to bite him in the arse though)  A lot of our players now are at clubs that are around their level or a little lower where they play the majority of the games and steadily improve as players. There are a lot more smart moves these days compared to the day of Verbeek and Osieck where ""training in Europe is better than the A-League"" probably scrambled a lot of our players to take their chances overseas."

Aleague,3c29lb,Walkerthon,10,Sat Jul 4 03:18:02 2015 UTC,A prolific goal scorer is the only piece of the puzzle that's missing now.
Aleague,3c29lb,Sliver_fish,8,Sat Jul 4 03:32:27 2015 UTC,They'd be pretty unstoppable with a natural striker.

Aleague,3c29lb,Walkerthon,2,Sat Jul 4 03:46:02 2015 UTC,"His agents managed to screw up a deal with Standard Liege, so unless he finds another club in Europe who want him, he might play in Australia for another season."
Aleague,3c29lb,Sliver_fish,5,Sat Jul 4 04:46:19 2015 UTC,This is actually a super exciting signing. Mells was rated highly at southampton and given how good their academy is these days thats saying a lot.
Aleague,3c29lb,CalvinKramer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:25:02 2015 UTC,any idea why he was let go?
Aleague,3c29lb,cynikles,4,Sat Jul 4 02:28:53 2015 UTC,Is it possible that he was seeking first-team football and Southampton couldn't give it to him? It's not always the club letting players go.
Aleague,3c29lb,red-john,3,Sat Jul 4 03:03:03 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't he just go down a league or two why come all the way to Australia though. Still great signing for us.
Aleague,3c29lb,cynikles,9,Sat Jul 4 08:53:25 2015 UTC,"Because he's Australian and Adelaide play good football that suits him with a coach that rates him. In England he's just another junior that didn't make the grade at a PL club. Here he's an exciting, young, Australian talent with something to prove. Lots of reasons."
Aleague,3c29lb,red-john,2,Sat Jul 4 09:54:44 2015 UTC,Oh I had no idea I thought he was English. My bad

Aleague,3c0ji8,EnglishHooligan,14,Fri Jul 3 17:40:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of people still haven't accepted the A-League.  There are a bunch of people who hold out their opposition to the existence of the A-League altogether and pine for the NSL days to return.  Arguing that even if the league was lower quality, it had more teams with better local communities and produced a lot of the talent that ended up in the 'golden generation' that got us back to the World Cup and out of the group stages.     I suspect the ISL will have to win fans with cold hard results.  Attract talented foreign players (I know for a fact India has a huge and very passionate european following.  If India could get some of those big name players to visit, even for a couple of guest stint games, it would have immense potential to win over hold out fans) and find a way to appeal to fans of the old clubs.  The Kolkata derby is a big event - attended by many thousands of fans, and what incentive does a Mohun Bagan fan have to walk away from that?  What spectacles can the ISL offer?  It's something the ISL will have to address.  The Aussie NSL lost a lot of storied and intense derbies when it was replaced, but the A-League has built up new ones that are a very big deal to the new clubs, like the big blue and the Sydney derby.     As for Big Bash.  I have no respect for it.  I don't mind cricket, so it's not the sport.  It just has absolutely no appeal to me.  I can't get into it, don't feel inspired to.  I can't even identify the two Melbourne teams by name, only colour.  I'm annoyed that it gets more coverage and popular discussion in the media than the A-League, even though I would expect that."
Aleague,3c0ji8,JediCapitalist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on a lot of what you said but the hold out fans don't support it for different reasons. The reason I asked about the Big Bash is because it is basically an Aussie Indian Premier League and the general opinion over the IPL is that it is just a tournament for stars and nothing else... and by stars, just the Indian cricket stars and bollywood stars. It does not help Indian cricket at all and its all a rouse for money.  That is the general opinion over the ISL as well, add in the fact that people believe the ISL organizers are trying to kill the clubs that ""try and do things"".  For me, I am used to this from the NFL and other American sports leagues in America and when I go to Arsenal games it is exactly the same with stars often announced on the PA and all that. I just believe the fans that don't like ISL are just not used to leagues like it."
Aleague,3c0ji8,JediCapitalist,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:14:52 2015 UTC,"I guess the only way ISL can prove that wrong is by creating academies, running youth clinics, training programs and doing other broader community work - to prove there is more to the ISL than being a profit generator for investors (although that's critically important, too, of course)."
Aleague,3c0ji8,BrisbaneBhoy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:18:09 2015 UTC,"Well they just had their grassroots program for U14 players but then you have those who wonder where the academies are etc.  Honestly, at this point I feel it is a hard game to win... hell, I am not fully convinced. The reason I asked this though is because I just wondered how it was for you guys."
Aleague,3c0ji8,fm471,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:34:03 2015 UTC,ISL owners have no interest in doing any of that. It's franchise football at it's absolute worst with the image considered paramount to any sort of substance.

Aleague,3c0ji8,PooDiePie,2,Sat Jul 4 02:16:38 2015 UTC,At my club in northern NSW there is always lots of chat about the NRL results. I don't think the A-league has ever been mentioned.

Aleague,3c0ji8,deadzool,5,Fri Jul 3 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"I hate to admit it, but you're not wrong. The only reason I started following the A-League at the start of this season was because of all the Wanderers/ACL hype. I tried to get into it back in the 08/09 season (the year before GCU and the Fury joined), but quickly gave up due to the low quality. The Wanderers ACL run indicated to me that the quality had improved, so I gave it another go."
Aleague,3c0ji8,angusozi,2,Sat Jul 4 05:40:19 2015 UTC,"Haha, I remember before the Wanderers is when I started to follow the A-League and people where wondering when the league was going to fold."
Aleague,3c0ji8,Meapa,2,Sat Jul 4 06:15:33 2015 UTC,"So I've seen AFL mentioned in other commets and I'm under the inpression OP is actually referring to local soccer clubs, south melbourne had a club among others. If this is what OP is referring to then unfortunately there isn't any parrel to draw as the local league here in Victoria was really quite small and while I'm sure there were some followers against the A-League, it was timed to start just after a world cup to draw interest from a wider player base. They also wanted to distance themselves from some of the followers of the previous league as there were behavioural issues. All in all, it was a better set up league and essentially the equivalent of the addition to a professional league from what was otherwise a small operation. Source: involved in Victory"
Aleague,3c0ji8,Meapa,7,Sat Jul 4 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"The AFL certainly doesn't accept the A-League fully- they fuck us around with the grounds, and the World Cup bid- they rightly fear that football will eventually surpass their stupid game. Eddy McGuire, who owns Collingwood, a prominent AFL club, is always a twat about football, the AFL-friendly press such as the Herald Sun is usually hostile towards football, and Andrew Demetriou, the AFL CEO, is certainly not accepting of football.   The big bash league is different, and I don't think there is any great rivalry there- as the two sports are played during different times of the year, there certainly isn't competition at grassroots level. The Cricket execs aren't as aggressive and insecure as the AFL ones are, and I can't recall any incident that football has had with them. Tim Cahill often appears on the lunch break Cricket Show, as does Ellyse Perry, and the commentators can occasionally be heard talking about football."
Aleague,3c0ji8,TheFightingImp,13,Fri Jul 3 20:21:38 2015 UTC,I think cricket is that one sport that most people just can't have a problem with. Like you always have people who hate a sport but there's no general hate between sports with cricket.  They are more lovable and it's (IMO) the national sport of Australia. Everyone knows it and even play it occasionally down in the park in the 40 degree heat.
Aleague,3c0ji8,Kamone1202,2,Fri Jul 3 22:10:15 2015 UTC,"To me, there is a certain ""royal"" feeling when it comes to cricket."
Aleague,3c0ji8,cynikles,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:16:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's the fact that it's something that's not like fast paced, high intensity kind of sport, it's a slower paced and the intensity is heatstroke."

Aleague,3c0ji8,kiac,6,Fri Jul 3 22:29:07 2015 UTC,"As far as ive heard from people is that Stajic didn't think she had given football enough of her time and wasn't making it a priority, which makes a big difference to someone who has been busting their ass for months on end to get a look it.  She is an absolute quality player but maybe the drive and ambition was lacking compared to other girls."
Aleague,3c0ji8,Marideaux,3,Fri Jul 3 23:08:43 2015 UTC,"Previous coach, Hesterine De Reus, set the tone by telling her that she either had to choose football or choose not being picked for the national team. She felt that Ellyse wasn't playing enough football to guarantee a spot in the team. I think Stajic has taken the same stance.   She is a good player but she is a better cricketer. Apart from scoring a screamer at the last World Cup she was responsible for most if not all the goals that went in for Sweden in the quarters. Caitlin Foord is a much better right-back anyway."
Aleague,3c0ji8,kiac,-3,Sat Jul 4 00:59:22 2015 UTC,"Demetriou isn't even CEO.. You sound stupid, bashing AFL and calling it stupid. I love both sports passionately and believe they can coexist. Afl supporters can hate soccer because of people like you who are arrogant and ignorant."
Aleague,3c0ji8,Marideaux,3,Fri Jul 3 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"I also support both, but I would say that the way AFL and its supporters generally look upon football, it is very much arrogant and ignorant. This is very widespread in Melbourne especially, you cannot avoid the topic of diving, the lack of goals, just general patronising remarks. AFL and its fans do live in a bubble here, it is undeniable. It is very much a bully/victim relationship between the two, that's not to say the FFA hasn't done some stupid antagonistic things (eg. encouraging kids to trade footies in for soccer balls)."
Aleague,3c0ji8,angusozi,-5,Sat Jul 4 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"Surely you're joking? Football fans are much worse, the crap I see on social media is a joke. If you think that AFL fans are worse with remarks and insult's you're the one living in a bubble. In the world I live in there is also no way that the AFL is bullying the FFA... If you're using the A-League Grand-final as a reference, that wasn't the AFL's fault for scheduling a game there before the a-league did, yet the way certain people view it the AFL's evil henchmen came and stole it...   And I was born in a different country so it's not like I'm some bogan with internet access hating on the soccaa  Simply put, AFL and football/soccer are competing in Australia and I consider it healthy. Sure there is actions by both sides that are questionable but it's happening in other places too. Get over it"
Aleague,3c0ji8,suicidal_smrtcar,2,Sat Jul 4 07:13:16 2015 UTC,"I never said the AFL is bullying the FFA, and never suggested anything about what was clearly the FFA's GF fuck up. No need to put words in my mouth.   And I was born in a different country so it's not like I'm some bogan with internet access hating on the soccaa   I also never suggested that you were one of these people. I was talking about the general attitude of the public.  Growing up here I played ""Wogball"" all my life, that is what my footy-loving friends would call it. You talk to your average AFL fan (reiterating: I'm not talking about someone who goes to both like us), and their knowledge will extend to diving and the lack of goals, as I said. It is delivered like a bully/victim relationship, ""What I am is right, why would you stray from that?"". I wouldn't count some childish social media antics as part of the general 'atmosphere'.  A few weeks back Victory/City played the semi final, probably the biggest club game Melbourne has seen. On the same night Geelong and Collingwood played at the G. Rightly so, the 3AW coverage of the football brought up the soccer and the impact it would have on the crowd (I think it was 20k down on last year?). Some of the younger commentators said if they weren't working they would have gone to the soccer instead of the footy, a bigger game, etc. However, Tony Shaw, I assume you know who is, is absolutely flabbergasted. Something along the lines of 'really? why on Earth would you do that? I can't believe why anyone would go watch that nonsense, weak sport. It's not our game, etc etc.'. Then they take calls and everyone is obviously on board with Shaw. Can you imagine anyone in the UK having that perspective towards soccer? Now this is just one footy person's opinion, but it's the best I can think of off the top of my head as symbolic of what I'm talking about.  Our sports station is an AFL station with other sports tacked on the side. That's cool, it is what is popular. The hosts have a vague idea of what is going on in soccer but they still need a guest to explain anything basic, they are AFL people that speak with an outsider's knowledge. It is what is expected here, the programs (apart from the 4 Diegos which is on at like what 11pm?) are aimed at footy people that have minimal interest in soccer, anything more in depth and there is resistance. Soccer is still painted as this 'foreign' sport. It's not hated on, just looked down upon. The papers do the same, do a search on Herald Sun soccer violence. Alarmist, patronising and one-eyed reporting. Though I think it is getting a bit better the last couple of years with the growth of support.  It's very possible that we just grew up in different areas so have had different experiences, but I'm telling you as someone who has enjoyed both his whole life and holds no ill-will towards AFL, there still exists a very real patronising attitude towards soccer."

Aleague,3c0ji8,BrisbaneBhoy,4,Sat Jul 4 07:53:47 2015 UTC,"AFL is the sport that is arrogant and ignorant of the rest of the world. I'm only so jaded because of the extremely intolerant way that AFL is run, and they use their influence in the media to piss all over other sports that dare to exist The AFL execs are a bunch of fascists, and when the real football eventually overtakes their abortion of a sport, it will be a good day for not just football fans, but fans of all sports,  who can now co-exist without the self-righteous, insular, intolerant AFL, a sport followed by half of one country."
Aleague,3c0ji8,BrisbaneBhoy,3,Sat Jul 4 07:28:02 2015 UTC,"I think overall a big majority of the Aussie Rules community would hate football regardless of anything. If it was the case that hate comes from arrogant supporters then why is there not the same level of hate amomgst rugby supporters. I think its just very typical of the way AFL and Aussie Rules views itself and the world around it.   You have to admit the AFL takes a very antagonistic approach when it comes to other sports and especially football who now days is a legitimate threat to its hegemony in the southern and western states.   You also see this attitude amongst Aussie rules supporters and media throughout victoria, SA and WA."

Aleague,3buxgv,kiac,2,Fri Jul 3 04:01:01 2015 UTC,I was curious if the story ever came out about why he was left out.  Turns out he had attitude issues under Osieck. Then he failed to report his diet and fitness stuff in the lead up to the cup. Then there was a story the journos chased over in Brazil before the FFA covered it up and threatened to restrict access to anyone digging. I remember there was rumours at the time saying he would drink even when he's been ordered not to.  So I don't think there's any chance we'll see him for Australia again.  http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/australia-2014/backstory-to-luke-wilkshires-world-cup-exclusion-20140619-3ah1j.html

Aleague,3bukju,cynikles,11,Thu Jul 2 07:30:09 2015 UTC,"Pessimism wins out. Compared to some other sponsors, Coffee Club was class. Want a big webjet mouseplane on the front? At least Coffee Club was just some slim text in one colour. Also, if they won't support us, who will? This is just another sign that the club is fucked at the moment. Hopefully Bakries can't pay staff and players next month so FFA takes the licence back."
Aleague,3bukju,Mello-D,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:33:19 2015 UTC,Webjet sponsorship is worth (reportedly) $750k a year. The logo might not be awesome to look at but its a small trade-off for the $$$.   My point is this: sponsorship dollars don't come easy for HAL clubs. Doesn't mean the clubs can just take whatever is on offer but it doesn't mean they can be too pedantic either.
Aleague,3bukju,mav_y,3,Thu Jul 2 08:30:10 2015 UTC,Coffee club deal was around 600k so not bad for what it was.
Aleague,3bukju,stationhollow,3,Thu Jul 2 08:53:21 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree that it is a trade off, but Coffee Club reportedly gave $650,000 a year, so it's not like you have to have a shitty logo if you want big sponsorship money. If we want that kind of money again there's a chance we could end up with something that looks truly awful which would make me sad."

Aleague,3bukpg,notbilbo,8,Thu Jul 2 07:31:33 2015 UTC,"I can't see how you wouldn't feel that way. Easy to naturally burnout after playing so many games, but the crap that went on within the club would just eliminate any chance of keeping the passion alive.  Hoping things turn around this season because it honestly seemed like a very toxic environment within the club from soon after winning the ACL."
Aleague,3bukpg,UltiMatthew,7,Thu Jul 2 09:50:08 2015 UTC,"If you watched the ACL documentary on Fox, Mark Bridge said something which puts it into perspective. Away at Guanzho, players were literally throwing up from exhaustion at half time. Throw in some more travelling and no proper pre-season and its a recipe for a disaster of a season."
Aleague,3bukpg,notbilbo,6,Thu Jul 2 10:50:25 2015 UTC,"Doing that is fine as well if they're supported. But they're pushing themselves that hard and far and for what, so that the club can then also fight them on prize money and wages? No incentive to do it at that point. Just get through the season, start doing the minimum, fulfil your contract and move on.  So disappointing."

The crap seems to be the disconnect between the administration and the playing group, just like other places, where the long term running of the club vs the wishes of the current group who rightly feel they are entitled to some of the success they are bringing.  Thats the general issue with most modern teams though, balancing satisfaction on and off the pitch. With a new club, I suspect they're all still learning.  Sad to see him go though :("

Aleague,3btjz6,PooDiePie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:08:54 2015 UTC,"TY for gold.  Yeah, I'm SEM but I often play against higher ranks because my friends are better than me. I'm usually moderately competitive with Novas.  My friends all take it too bloody seriously though. They think 'Competitive' means that we're in some sort of lower division to the guys at dreamhack, whereas for me I just think it's a different rule set and gamemode that is more intense and fun.  They were spewing during that game and actually got really pissed when I was just laughing at the bots on our team running straight down the middle, only to get instantly picked off.  Not to mention they spend hundreds on opening gun cases, when I just buy the guns I want direct from the market. They say I haven't been through the full process, but I honestly don't see the point in wasting $2.50 to receive a gun worth $0.10 50% of the time.   I do understand how you could enjoy the addiction on something as trivial as csgo items, but gambling isn't my thing, especially on something like this where you're obviously going to lose out no matter how good you are.  What'd be more fun and rewarding is if you tried to make a profit out of your items, but that would take too much time and effort."

Sad that people take Competitive that seriously, I like winning and it's annoying when I lose but it's not like I just lost a 250k game or anything.   The bots can't spice up the game a little bit, but clearly your teammates didn't know how to control a  bot if it just kept going down suicide to mid. It was nice to get those kills :P  Honestly I'm one of those case openers, so stupid but I just like doing it. You can always bet them if you get dupes and stuff as well.

The lowest ranked team in the tournament (Balmain Tigers) got drawn against essentially the highest ranked team (Melbourne Victory) and current Australian champions. None of the matches in this round contain two teams from the same city Two of the strongest teams from the preliminary rounds and NPL - Blacktown City and Metrostars - will be playing each other in what is surely the most notable fixture not involving A-League teams.

Aleague,3bl4d2,GetUpMorningMVFC,5,Tue Jun 30 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"Serious Answer: Because the picture of the cup is also the logo for the cup, just like the A-League logo is on the toilet seat and the premiers plate, the FFA cup logo is on the cup.

Aleague,3bkvse,rezplzk,7,Tue Jun 30 02:16:57 2015 UTC,Will they even be able to pay him?
Aleague,3bkvse,Kerrby,2,Tue Jun 30 02:26:51 2015 UTC,"While your attempt at criticism is warranted it is a bit rich considering our own league has ""franchises"" folding every other year."
Aleague,3bkvse,rezplzk,3,Tue Jun 30 03:16:24 2015 UTC,I think its the fact that it's not a whole country going under where there's not even a safety net really if they don't pay him
Aleague,3bkvse,Meapa,3,Tue Jun 30 12:45:03 2015 UTC,"not necessarily, i just think that he would be much better off in australia. different story if he was playing for olympiacos or one of the bigger teams but he signed for a newly promoted club. what happens if they go back down, then where does he go?"
Aleague,3bkvse,CalvinKramer,5,Tue Jun 30 03:53:12 2015 UTC,"I am not sure; that's his decision I guess.  You put forward the negative - but remember he also gets the opportunity to play against PAOK, Olympiacos, Parathinakos, AEK etc in full view of all Greeks on national tv.  He gets access and taste for bigger clubs with different types of pressure and he gets away from Western Sydney social issues.  To me it's a no brainer.  Scoring goals in the A-League is nice but we can assume he wants more out of his career and is capable of it."

Aleague,3bkdda,Rofl_Crab,2,Wed Jul 1 02:22:11 2015 UTC,I think 14 is the best we can hope for for the time being.    Once we get there it'll be time to stay stable and develop the clubs long term before expanding again.
Aleague,3bkdda,JediCapitalist,2,Mon Jun 29 23:39:08 2015 UTC,"Keeping in mind that 15 years would be just before the 30/31 season, I would hope for 16 teams or, as a best case scenario, 18 teams. However, I would only expect 14 by that point.  One of the main points that they've reiterated about the upcoming expansion is that they're timing it with the start of the new tv deal. If that goes well (both on the expansion front, and on the tv deal front), and I suspect it will, then they may want to continue that pattern of expanding with new tv deals (which, unless I'm much mistaken, last four years each).  That means that a best case, though slightly unrealistic (unless the sport's popularity continues to grow at the rate that it has over the last ten years), scenario would be:   Expansion for 17/18 (with Canberra and Ipswich seemingly the frontrunners for it) Expansion in 21/22 Again in 25/26 And again in 29/30   That being said, I think the far more likely scenario would be them skipping expansion on the second and fourth of those tv deals, giving us 14 teams by 2030: Canberra and Ipswich, then two others (South Coast Wolves or I riot, and hopefully the Fury as well)."
Aleague,3bkdda,SerTahu,2,Tue Jun 30 00:41:23 2015 UTC,Judging by a lot of people comments 16 teams seems to be the mark we should be aiming for. So we have the current 10 A-League clubs:  Adelaide  Brisbane  CCM  Melb City  Melb Victory  Newcastle  Perth  Sydney FC  Wellington  WSW  So we need another 6...  Ipswich & Canberra seem to be popular choices for the 1st round of expansions and the FFA seems to be keen on these 2 areas.  Maybe NQF & Wollongong/South Coast in the 2nd round of expansion  The last 2 are hard to choose. Auckland? 2nd Brisbane? 3rd Sydney? Gold Coast? Geelong? 2nd Adelaide? All these places have pros and cons.
Aleague,3bkdda,-Volumes_,3,Tue Jun 30 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"Pros and Cons for the options for the last two, because I'm bored :P:   Auckland - Cons: the AFC would be incredibly pissed off (assuming that nothing has changed to cause us to be in the same confederation as NZ between now and then), and the colossal failure of the Knights would go against it. Pros: A very large untapped market, and Nix games there have done very well. 3rd Brisbane (Ipswich would be the second Brisbane team) - Cons: Where would you put it? Logan? It doesn't sound like a market that could sustain 3 teams. Pros: A Logan team might be able to pull some fans in from the Gold Coast. 3rd Sydney team - Cons: Where would you put it? Sutherland is a SFC heartland, and doesn't really have the population to sustain a team of their own. Campbelltown or the Inner West (at Belmore) could probably stay afloat, but I don't see them doing any better than Heart/City Pros: It's a very large market. If you could find the right spot, success would be almost guaranteed. Gold Coast - Cons: Gold Coast United Pros: A large market, and I like to think that GCU's failure was due to Palmer and the lack of community engagement. Engage the community with a revived GCU, and you should get a relatively well supported team. Geelong - Cons: No real football culture, and it would be one of the smallest markets in the league. Pros: Although they don't have a reputation for being into football down there, they are sports mad, so it could give them something to do between AFL seasons. 2nd Adelaide team - Cons: It's not a huge city, and where would you put it? Pros: They do have a decent sporting culture, and it would add another derby   And I'll add these possibilities:   2nd Perth team - Cons: Where would you put it? And the Glory's attendances aren't exactly glorious Pros: Although not brilliant, the Glory's attendances have been the most consistent in the history of the league. If you can emulate that, you could have a sustainable team. Hobart - Cons: It's not a huge market, and doesn't really have much of a football culture. Pros: Completely untapped market for football codes. Sunshine Coast - Cons: Not as big as some of the other options, and isn't really known for it's sports culture. Pros: It's a completely untapped market. Christchurch - Cons: Not as big as Auckland Pros: Nix games there have done well, and it is a similar size to Wellington.   If we were stopping at 16 teams, of those options I would probably say a revived Knights at Mt Smart instead of North Harbour, and a revived GCU with community engagement, for the sake of continuity in getting all of the former teams back in the league, if nothing else :P. If we are going to 18 teams, then I would go with Auckland and Hobart first, then Gold Coast and Geelong."
Aleague,3bkdda,SerTahu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"I reckon second Adelaide team could work (in the future), maybe Adelaide City could be pushed into the a-league. They have a relatively large fanbase (for a state team) and played in the old NPL."
Aleague,3bkdda,AussieGuy96,3,Tue Jun 30 05:29:00 2015 UTC,"Key phrase being 'in the future'. I'm sure it will be feasible at some point, but there are probably better options for the next few expansions.  My hope is that they won't just stop expanding at 16 teams (give or take), but rather keep expanding and eventually split the A-League to form a B-League (top down, as opposed to forming a B-League from NPL teams, because the interest in it would be much higher that way so they might get a tv deal for it).  If that does happen, and over the next 4-5 decades it's built up to 28 or 32 teams over two leagues with promotion relegation, then I would think that a second Adelaide team would be introduced relatively early on into that."

I'd prefer a large expansion, but I think we'll have to settle for just a few extra teams.  I'd really like to get to the stage where we can have a decently long season with only 2 meetings between each team."

I don't think we are going to see the same problems as before, the FFA has learnt a lot from both the failures and the success of the way WSW was set up. Owners will always be a possible problem but growth strategy will have improved, especially under someone experienced like Gallop.   I'm going with 16 at a minimum. With the growth of the sport it could be more and in the next 15 years a few new promising markets could open up."

Aleague,3bhq37,Mazlr93,-2,Tue Jun 30 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"Bit surprised by this. He's still young and scored some important goals last season, his general play looked pretty good as well. Surely he will get snapped up by another club"
Aleague,3bhlgt,SerTahu,4,Mon Jun 29 07:50:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with the FFA on this one. saying that the Salary cap hasn't gone up isn't true, its been around about the levels of inflation or greater over most of the A League Seasons. The PFA clearly just wants the Salary cap raised hugely like between the 08-09 and 09-10 seasons.   I agree with increasing it incrementally until the next TV deal. The FFA can't afford to cover a big rise so the onus would fall on the owners with many already currently struggling. Especially if you are increasing the base salary cap to 90%. You can't have both as it would send a couple of clubs bankrupt. Not gonna happen."
Aleague,3bhlgt,suicidal_smrtcar,3,Mon Jun 29 13:14:47 2015 UTC,Its all just a bit of a dance.   This press release is meant to discredit and pressure the PFA.  PFA had been doing the same thing.
Aleague,3bhlgt,wanderingrhino,0,Mon Jun 29 07:59:45 2015 UTC,"The longer it goes on though, the longer it is until the veterans allowance is implemented and that puts us at risk of not re-signing Arch."
Aleague,3bhlgt,Row86,2,Mon Jun 29 08:34:24 2015 UTC,i think we can resign arch now with the aus marquee spot being open.

Aleague,3bhlgt,stationhollow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:43:46 2015 UTC,"Steady on, aren't Victory fans supposed to be the ones who bang on about conspiracy theories and the FFA?  Victory wont be the only club to benefit from the change."
Aleague,3bggw5,Chosen_Chaos,14,Mon Jun 29 00:36:04 2015 UTC,"We've sold a home game to Melbourne Victory with the excuse that ""we wouldn't be able to achieve 13 home games at Gosford without this game"". Yeah because otherwise, we would have had 14 home games at Gosford since we only had 13 home games last year and YOU'VE FUCKING SOLD AWAY A HOME GAME YOU FUCKING CUNTS. That is how a fair draw works you embarrassing sacks of shit and I can't fuckin believe they think the fans will accept being fed such a blatantly nonsensical and ridiculous lie. Fucking shameful."
Aleague,3bggw5,Never_Fight_Bears,11,Mon Jun 29 00:44:35 2015 UTC,I can't believe that FFA are letting Victory buy extra home games. Well actually I can believe it.
Aleague,3bggw5,OfficialJKV,5,Mon Jun 29 01:30:23 2015 UTC,......but Adelaide did the same thing?
Aleague,3bggw5,Row86,5,Mon Jun 29 06:37:23 2015 UTC,Yeah even I recognize that it's bullshit.  Draw should be as fair as possible for everybody.
Aleague,3bggw5,ScreamHawk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:17:49 2015 UTC,Agree it should be fair.   Wonder who takes the gate receipts as it is being included in the victory membership access. (they refer to it as a home game on the membership site).   Will give the CCM a boost in average crowd figure though.
Aleague,3bggw5,break_the_system,2,Mon Jun 29 04:34:36 2015 UTC,What about the match that Brisbane are taking to Cairns? Or the two matches that Wellington are playing at other locations - Auckland and Christchurch?
Aleague,3bggw5,SerTahu,2,Mon Jun 29 01:48:05 2015 UTC,"In those cases it could be argued that the majority of fans at those games will still be supporting the Roar and Nix so, although they are regional, they are still home games."
Aleague,3bggw5,SerTahu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:00:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe for the Auckland and Christchurch matches, since - and this is without really looking at a map of checking travel options - AFAIK, it's easier to get from Wellington to those places than it is to get from Brisbane to Cairns. A shorter trip, anyway."
Aleague,3bggw5,blue_yellow_man,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:28:47 2015 UTC,"I kind of talking about the locals as well as the travelling fans. I imagine that Auckland and Christchurch locals that are into football enough to attend would nominally support the Nix, and the same for Cairns locals and the Roar, due to those being the only NZ and QLD teams respectively."
Aleague,3bggw5,alvinng,2,Mon Jun 29 06:32:30 2015 UTC,"Fair point, although I suspect that a fair portion of the crowd at all three matches might end up being people who are simply curious as to what all the fuss is about. That seems to be what happens when matches are played in regional areas."
Aleague,3bggw5,blue_yellow_man,2,Mon Jun 29 07:08:21 2015 UTC,"No team ever gets 14 home games. The 14th game is always the ""regional round"". So essentially the Mariners have sold out Western NSW."
Aleague,3bggw5,MVFC4life,5,Mon Jun 29 01:35:47 2015 UTC,We're getting 14 home games at AAMI Park for 2015/16.
Aleague,3bggw5,blue_yellow_man,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:52:29 2015 UTC,So you're taking their 14th game to the underprivileged and needy of Victoria that's the point of the regional round.     This banter is too easy.
Aleague,3bggw5,CheapTrick32,3,Mon Jun 29 04:57:19 2015 UTC,He was just pointing out that what you say wasn't exactly right and you come back with a reply that's about as mature as a three year old.
Aleague,3bggw5,blue_yellow_man,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:04:05 2015 UTC,I didn't realise football banter now had to be mature. I'll make  a mental note for future reference.
Aleague,3bggw5,MVFC4life,3,Mon Jun 29 05:06:33 2015 UTC,Nah but it's a bit weak to pull out an attempt at banter when the other user is taking part in an actual discussion.
Aleague,3bggw5,blue_yellow_man,0,Mon Jun 29 06:56:09 2015 UTC,It was a joke. It was an exact copy of the joke I made about Newcastle an hour earlier. In context that seemed funny. I was obviously wrong in my original comment as both replies pointed out.

Aleague,3bggw5,falisimoses,2,Mon Jun 29 05:29:24 2015 UTC,"The 14th game is always the ""regional round"".   I had always assumed that was the rule, but the Jets are playing all 14 of their home games at Hunter Stadium, and ADU's and SFC's 'regional' games are just at larger venues in their home cities (Adelaide Oval and ANZ). It's actually rather disappointing, imo, that SFC in particular aren't taking their 14th game to either Canberra or Wollongong to further test the waters there."

Aleague,3bggw5,tbkh91,3,Mon Jun 29 00:39:40 2015 UTC,SFC do not have a single Sunday game until the final round of the season. That works very well for me :P.
Aleague,3bggw5,itisknown__,6,Mon Jun 29 01:49:23 2015 UTC,For Roar fans:   Thursdays | 1 game (0 home - 1 away) Fridays | 7 games (4 home - 3 away) Saturdays | 13 games (5 home - 8 away including Cairns) Sundays | 6 games (4 home - 2 away)
Aleague,3bggw5,red-john,4,Mon Jun 29 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"So we were gonna have 14 home games, but one of them moved to Cairns? I suppose that's not too bad then.  Still annoying to see another concert getting in the way. We need Perry Park"
Aleague,3bggw5,rezplzk,5,Mon Jun 29 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"disappointed we've got City so early. We drew WSW in round 1 last year and got over 30,000, with City following two weeks later. Don't see why a similar thing could not have happened, our GF win means we'd be certain to draw another big crowd regardless of who we play.   Geelong game should be a Saturday, not a Friday. It takes an hour and a half from Southern Cross to Kardinia Park, which will be cutting it fine for many workers. The fact that some offices may still yet be open on the 8th of Jan and that it's summer holidays for school kids should alleviate that a bit though.      We get a rough start to the season with only 2 home games in the first 6 rounds, but that balances itself out towards the end of the season, with 10 of our last 14 games in Victoria.    Looking forward to City, Sydney, Adelaide and WSW all at AAMI in Feb/March.     Will most likely be doing Sydney away and Brisbane away (given that it falls on Labour day weekend). Would have definitely made the trek over to Adelaide for round 1 if it were at Hindmarsh, however having gone to the Adelaide Oval game in round two of last year, I'm not sure it's worth it (though the march through the CBD to the stadium was brilliant)    edit: lol how did I get downvoted for this? I don't think I've said anything controversial..."
Aleague,3bggw5,itisknown__,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:27:54 2015 UTC,Yeah Adelaide oval is pretty annoying can't blame them when coopers is capped at 16k when they get double(?) at Adelaide oval

Aleague,3bggw5,SerTahu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:23:37 2015 UTC,I figured there would be dates set; but I guess we can't work out home/away until the draw etc.

The former home of the Knights) Round 10, Saturday the 12th of Dec, Brisbane vs Wellington at Cazaly's Stadium (Cairns) Round 14, Friday the 8th of Jan, Mariners vs Victory at Simonds Stadium (Geelong) Round 17, Saturday the 30th of Jan, Wellington vs Mariners at AMI Stadium (Christchurch)   Also, Victory are playing 5 games at Etihad this season.

Aleague,3bggw5,-Volumes_,3,Mon Jun 29 00:42:41 2015 UTC,My guess is that the Thursday and Sunday 7pm games are them testing new timeslots to find the one that will work best when they expand to 12 teams (and have to fit an extra game in each week).

Aleague,3befx2,SerTahu,2,Sun Jun 28 13:39:01 2015 UTC,"From google translate it sounds like his main rival is Przemyslaw Tyton, another new signing after VFB's #1 went to bayern  Tyton has been on loan from PSV in 2nd division sides for a couple of season, but at least he has been playing. Anyone who knows more about germany know if Langerak would be going as #1?"
Aleague,3befx2,shitidiotturtle,2,Sun Jun 28 19:23:13 2015 UTC,"He'll be competing, but imho he should really be starting that spot within a few weeks of the season starting."
Aleague,3befx2,VenomousCharm,5,Sun Jun 28 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"Don't write Tyton off that easily. He is a very capable keeper. Before Zoet, and b his injury, he was one of the top 3 keepers in the Eredivisie and one of the best keepers PSV had had since Huerhelo Gomes. I really rated him. On form, he's much more reliable than Langerak."
Aleague,3befx2,cynikles,2,Sun Jun 28 23:21:13 2015 UTC,Tyton was on loan at Elche (la liga) last season and was a starter for them. I also remember him playing really well for Poland in i believe the world cup after szczesny got injured. I would  assume Tyton would be in mind as the #1 goalkeeper. Mitch probably has a better chance to overtake him than Burki at Dortmund though.
Aleague,3befx2,AttackClown,2,Mon Jun 29 04:53:10 2015 UTC,It was the last Euros where he replaced Szczesny. Came on a saved a penalty then played out the rest of the tournament even after Szczesny came back from suspension. That was when he was at the top of his game imo.
Aleague,3bdt08,notbilbo,9,Sun Jun 28 07:17:38 2015 UTC,"I think he must have a very 'Europe or nothing' mentality. I mean Iraklis? Fuck that. Same with him leaving at what, 18, to play for Mlada Boleslav in Czech Republic.   Playing in Europe is obviously the end goal for most, but Greek league (outside of the big clubs) and Czech league etc can be a recipe for disaster. Reminds me around 2003-06 when heaps of Aussies were playing at random Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Romanian clubs.   The bloke is fucking talented and I have been a huge advocate of his for years, he should stay in the A-League, give himself a full season (away from any NSW clubs preferrably) to show what he's got then look at Europe."
Aleague,3bdt08,alexescobarthefirm,13,Sun Jun 28 10:22:28 2015 UTC,A big reason why he went to the Czech Republic was so he didn't end up in jail.
Aleague,3bdt08,mav_y,3,Sun Jun 28 10:55:10 2015 UTC,"You're drawing a false comparison. Between 2003-2006, a lot of the Aussies playing in 'weaker' European leagues (Stefanutto, Wehrman, Rose, Mitchell, Covic et al) were there because the NSL collapsed. There was no pro-football in Australia for two or three years and we had a bunch of pros who wanted to continue their careers. Those that wanted a decent wage but weren't world beaters went to weaker leagues in Europe. Even when the A-League started, these guys were either comfortable or still under contract.   I think it's an unfair comparison to make. Only Dilevski, Baird and Coe have played in those leagues since the A-League took root I believe. Georgievski another but I hardly think its a poor choice to play for a UCL club. J. Burns did the same.   Besides, you're more likely to get noticed by scouts in Europe. German and Dutch scouts look all over Scandinavia for talent all the time. There'd only be a few scouts that ever really make it to Australia. Comparatively anyway.  Greece I don't think is a particularly good move personally, but there are advantages to playing in smaller Euro leagues."
Aleague,3bdt08,cynikles,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:37:57 2015 UTC,Not just the playing.  It's more the facilities and training techniques.
Aleague,3bdt08,rezplzk,0,Sun Jun 28 22:45:59 2015 UTC,"Send him here. Adelaide need a goal scorer, they've got loads of experience with helping to reignite the careers of former Wanderers players and Tarek would be able to knock some sense into him, as he's already had a brother go to prison due to mixing with the wrong people."

Aleague,3bdyii,GK93,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:30:17 2015 UTC,"All the recent derbies at allianz have had public ticket allocation exhausted though, so there's no way to know that there's not enough for ANZ.  I don't know what the demand for tickets in your fanbase is like, but I know for a fact that there's heaps of casual wanderers fans that want to go to at least one derby, but can't, because our allocation is sold to the members instantly. We easily pull 20k to the derbies and it honestly wouldn't surprise me if we could double that.  Yeah, there's still the problem of ANZ being shit for football, but if you've got the atmosphere it's amazing. I was at the Uruguay game and it was absolutely ridiculous, but every game I've been to since has been shit because they're not particularly exciting games. Even the qualifier for the 2014 WC was a bit lacklustre.... But judging from the atmosphere that we get at allianz a derby played at ANZ could be just as good, if not better than the Uruguay game."

No, the Perth issue was what knocked the gallop out of the season. Victory had it in the bag at that point.   The A-League's marquee fixtures – the Sydney and Melbourne derbies – will be hosted twice by Sydney FC and Melbourne City respectively.    Give them all the home derbies they want.

Aleague,3bdni8,itisknown__,8,Sun Jun 28 06:55:28 2015 UTC,I'm assuming the larger capacity would be intended to provide extra room at derbies.   Brisbane can barely get 20000 to a game   They actually averaged less than 12k last season.

Aleague,3bdni8,SerTahu,2,Mon Jun 29 01:55:55 2015 UTC,not sure about Canberra. Gallop did say last year that the A League will only be looking at areas with a 500k + population to expand into. I do hope that it does go ahead because I think Canberra is the biggest uptapped still out there (when you consider that GC failed spectacularly).
Aleague,3bdni8,suicidal_smrtcar,2,Sun Jun 28 10:58:36 2015 UTC,"The adventures of the Gold Coast team was more to do with the actual club than crowds. The team had nothing going for it, when you have Clive Parmigiana running the club, it was never going to work.  If it was done right - using an existing club, being closer to the community and less Palmer, it had potential to go well.  Not to mention that whole book thing they released a while back mentioned Canberra was almost certain with the link to W-League."
Aleague,3bdni8,Meapa,2,Sun Jun 28 11:26:25 2015 UTC,"Although they didn't explicitly state it, if you read between the lines of the Whole of Football report it is blatantly obvious that they want to put a team in Canberra using the W-League Canberra United brand.  As for GCU, I would argue that it failed because of 1) Clive Palmer, and 2) The FFA forcing the club on the area with the attitude of ""if we build it they will come"" (the same problem that I think MelCity are suffering from, it feels like a corporate entity as opposed to a club that represents the people). If they had used the same approach that they did with WSW (i.e. engage the community to build a club that represents them), I have no doubt that GCU would still be around today, with healthy enough crowds."
Aleague,3bdni8,SerTahu,2,Sun Jun 28 13:21:57 2015 UTC,Can the FFA look at a 25-30k stadium for Brisbane as well? Suncorp is fucking shite! Especially now the concert limit has been raised.
Aleague,3bdni8,JuiceSpringsteen8,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:23:37 2015 UTC,Build a 25k stadium at Perry Park. Good location near Bowen Hills station (which every train line goes past).
Aleague,3bdni8,stationhollow,2,Wed Jul 1 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"Still think it's misguided to be looking at expansion when there are some real issues facing a lot of clubs. CCM, Jets and Roar need to be dealt with before any expansion begins."
Aleague,3bdni8,Row86,3,Mon Jun 29 08:29:06 2015 UTC,"Although they're scoping out locations at the moment, the last I heard they're still not planning on actually introducing new teams until the 17/18 season (to coincide with the new tv deal). That's still two years away.  The Jets seems to be getting back on the right track, and I think it's only a matter of time before the FFA strikes an ownership deal with Dundee United, which would secure their future.  The Mariners aren't in as bad a financial situation as people often think, and it seems that they're starting to make some of the right moves off the pitch to re-engage with the community. Hopefully, if they can get off to a decent start this season, their crowds should start to improve again.  Roar, in my mind, is the only major question mark at the moment (which does make the Ipswich talk rather ironic). I honestly wouldn't be surprised if, by this time next year, the Bakrie Group are no longer owners, whether it be by them selling the club, or being forced out Tinkler style."
Aleague,3bdni8,SerTahu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:42:55 2015 UTC,Bakries sold most of their other football holdings last year but held off on Brisbane since selling the reigning premiers/champions would look awful. They're obviously in a lot of debt and their goal of using all these clubs to promote Indonesian football has been an utter failure.  Getting a new owner would be better for everyone.

Aleague,3bdb9b,Brisbanealchemist,2,Sun Jun 28 08:47:34 2015 UTC,"Please Brisbane, for your own sake, move to Ballymore. The pitch would be far easier to maintain and, based on everything I've read, you would save a small fortune on the cost of booking the venue. Treat Suncorp in the same way that Victory does Etihad; only use it for the really big games each season."
Aleague,3bdb9b,SerTahu,8,Sun Jun 28 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"As others have said it is a reasonable walk to the nearest train, the real problem though is that that walk is entirely through suburban streets.  neither the government note the police like that as they cop the complaints of the locals.   Add that to the lack of local pubs, the run down state of the stadium itself, no video screen and lack of corporate  suites, a move to Balymore causes way more problems than it solves"

Aleague,3bdb9b,SerTahu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:49:44 2015 UTC,what about perry park then? Isn't that near a train station?
Aleague,3bdb9b,suicidal_smrtcar,2,Sun Jun 28 11:11:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not from Brisbane so I could be totally off the mark here, but I think Perry Park could be great. It has a train station which is only 200m away, Brisbane's main nightlife area is a 15 minute walk or a train stop away, it's in a mainly industrial area and there is already some existing soccer infrastructure. Perfect spot for a modestly sized stadium imo"
Aleague,3bdb9b,itisknown__,2,Sun Jun 28 11:24:24 2015 UTC,"Perry park has always been something that us Roar fans have wanted. Note that we've have discussions about it throughout this season and we would love to see it be upgraded to a 20k stadium. The best part is, every train, literally every train stops at Bowen Hills (the one next to perry park) so it would actually be better than Suncorp where you have two lines on it (which actually run the same route for majority of the thing)  There has been ""talk"" about it by the uppers but at the state the Roar are currently in, it's definitely  out of the books for a Perry Park upgrade unless the government/companies put a damn lot of money into it."
Aleague,3bdb9b,Meapa,2,Sun Jun 28 11:37:52 2015 UTC,"It would be great, but the time to redevelop it was about 5 years ago before they put the pcyc in on one of the ends of the park. Now they would have to demolish a pretty new 2 or 3 million dollar pcyc to fit the stadium in.   I think the government would also require a fly over walk way to the station and probably some work to the station itself before it would allow development of the area. It all means that it can not be done on the cheap. Probably looking at 5-10mil before you spend anything on a stadium"
Aleague,3bdb9b,sirhcdobo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:48:31 2015 UTC,"The main problem (imo) with Ballymore is the lack of decent transportation to it.  The closest train station is a long journey for most and really you gotta get a bus to the stadium.   Secondly, I believe the stadium would really require an upgrade soon. (IIRC) It hasn't been upgraded in its time and at a capacity of 18k, we aren't giving ourselves much leeway for good crowds (at brisbane? pfft). To be fair, we haven't reached 18k in a while but I would like to believe."
Aleague,3bdb9b,Meapa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:14:20 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Ballymore have Wilston station only a couple hundred metres away? That's closer than the Wanderers are to Paramatta Station (and far closer than SFC to any station -_-).  Capacity could be an issue (you did break 18k once last season, and a few times in the seasons before that), but based on Google Earth it doesn't look like it would be hard to build an extra stand on the south end, which would bump the capacity up by at least 2-3k."
Aleague,3bdb9b,SerTahu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:07:20 2015 UTC,It's a 1.7km walk from the station according to google maps. It's more of a comparison to Suncorp where it's directly next to it. I'd rather the 200m compared to 1.7k  The grass hill could easily be upgraded and will probably be the first thing if any upgrade was to happen.
Aleague,3bdb9b,Meapa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:38:06 2015 UTC,"1.2K when I measured it. ~300m east from the station along New Market, ~550m south along Granville, then roughly another 350m to cross the bridge and get to the stadium. And as these guys suggest, it wouldn't be too hard (or expensive) for the Roar to get a few shuttle buses to cover that first ~850m.  It's still further than Suncorp, granted, but not unreasonable. And the fact remains that it would be far cheaper and provide a better pitch which, given the current state of the club and all the complaints about Suncorp, should make it an option that should at least be seriously considered."
Aleague,3bdb9b,SerTahu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:50:49 2015 UTC,The trouble with the walk Ballymore - Wilston (as noted by /u/sirhcdobo) is that it goes through what is very much a residential area.

Aleague,3b9r7z,TheStinger87,5,Sat Jun 27 04:56:13 2015 UTC,$182 for a friendly?  What an absolute ripoff.  I saw Barca v Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey QF this year for the equivalent of about $125.  That price is ridiculous.
Aleague,3b9r7z,PooDiePie,2,Sat Jun 27 08:20:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, I missed out on the game against Chelsea. The tottenham game was much more reasonably priced.  Think of all the other shit you could buy for $182 that you could have instead of watching a 90 minute post-season friendly. Even if some of the best players in the world are on show.   A year's supply of Mi Goreng noodles, a pod filter + radiator upgrade for your JDM drift machine, a new set of cymbals for your drum kit. All things that will last ages if treated correctly.  And I thought football was my cheapest hobby.  It'd be nice of them to sell cheap tickets to club members, rather than just a fast track to losing a season ticket's worth of money.  This would only fill a small amount of the stadium, and they would still make a mint out of the expensive tickets sold to the general public that are happy to pay these prices to only watch one 'exclusive' or 'special' game."
Aleague,3b9r7z,Mello-D,3,Sat Jun 27 13:50:54 2015 UTC,That'd be a pretty shitty set of cymbals for $182.

Aleague,3b9r7z,TheStinger87,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:05:51 2015 UTC,You've got to remember that part of this cost is covering the flights from Europeto Australia for the teams. Add to that the lack of alternative matches to watch these European teams (ie reduced supply) and it's somewhat understandable why it's so expensive.
Aleague,3b9r7z,Azza_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"All very good points.  I understand the supply v demand argument and it is a very valid one.  Liverpool know that there is a huge following in Australia, and they know that whatever price they put on the tickets there will be enough people who will pay that amount and fill the stadium.    But other teams have gone down and had much lower prices for their tickets (Malaga v Adelaide United was in the region of around $40).  It is a money grab.  Even by the FFA.  They ask for a certain amount of money as well to host these games.    I know that most people don't have thousands of dollars to go over to England or wherever to see them play in their league season and are willing to pay anything just to see them once, but it just seems really exorbitant to me."
Aleague,3b9r7z,GetUpMorningMVFC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"I agree its extremely expensive, but if people are keen to pay that much for tickets and it sells out then it's hard to argue that it was too expensive. Either it's exclusive to those with the money to afford the extreme costs, or its exclusive to those with the time to get tickets in the tiny window before they sellout. It's pretty much a lose lose PR situation for the ticketing, but it inevitably gets ignored if the crowd attendance is good enough"

Aleague,3b7752,rithsv,7,Fri Jun 26 15:01:56 2015 UTC,"League Championship sounds like a decent fit. It's not the EPL, but it's still competitive and he should (hopefully) be able to get a decent amount of first team football."
Aleague,3b7752,SerTahu,5,Fri Jun 26 15:23:43 2015 UTC,"Huddersfield fan here feeling pretty happy with this signing. Can't say I've seen him play, but he certainly has plenty of experience for his age, especially with Australia. Looking forward to seeing him.  Also he'll definitely be getting plenty of games as we don't have any other (first team) left backs at the moment."
Aleague,3b7752,Finchester,10,Fri Jun 26 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"Can't say I've seen him play   All you need to know is this: He holds the distinction of having scored a beautiful header with his first touch of the ball for Australia. The problem was that it went in the wrong net.  Seriously though, aside from that initial hiccup he's been a rather solid defender for the national team."
Aleague,3b7752,SerTahu,4,Fri Jun 26 16:56:05 2015 UTC,That's a bit harsh! His performance in the World Cup was superb.

Aleague,3b5gy8,Mello-D,3,Fri Jun 26 04:10:33 2015 UTC,"I am sure it would be a consideration, but that does nothing for smaller clubs who are already struggling to attract decent players and overall hurts the league. We don't want a situation where one or two clubs attract the most talented players due to their location or their chance of winning."
Aleague,3b5gy8,wanderingrhino,13,Fri Jun 26 04:45:14 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  If a club has a successful backroom, managers and people who encourage the team and have great harmony,  they will naturally have better retention.  This is the reward.   Other clubs who don't do that?  Well what are they doing wrong.   It's like any workplace."
Aleague,3b5gy8,Mello-D,2,Fri Jun 26 06:34:34 2015 UTC,But the argument remains the same. Bigger cities attract wealthier owners because the chance for growth is larger. Wealthier owners can pay more for better staff which leads to better morale/backrooms etc. Still doesn't help smaller clubs who don't have that appeal and isn't doing much for the growth of the league.

Aleague,3b2h7w,GetUpMorningMVFC,2,Fri Jun 26 09:11:53 2015 UTC,"I can add some insight here.  So FCB are a great club, ive been many time to Sankt Jakob park just outside the city Its a great stadium, they have a wonderful atmosphere.  You get your sausage with bread an mustard out the front, a cold feldschlossen to drink, alkoholfrei if you like.  The swiss league is ok, good standard with gret away support. The active section full of pyro and the odd smell of dope. I think u can stil smoke in the stadium I saw people doing it.  I went to the stade de suisse to watch the swiss cup fial, fcb vs grasshopper club zurich. The tifo took up an entire top of a stand, about 3000ppl. I counted 40 flares going at once.  It was amazing and I loved every minute in basel. Fcb is my swiss club."
Aleague,3b4glr,Row86,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:00:53 2015 UTC,"Reasonable that the union should be annoyed, I don't really understand why the FFA want to freeze the Salary Cap. I guess after Newcastle/Perth/Brisbane some stability is required to keep the competition afloat."
Aleague,3b4glr,Walkerthon,6,Thu Jun 25 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"Because in a league with only 10 teams, increasing the salary so that even only 1-2 teams can achieve it will create an unfair environment.   The PFA need to remember that if even 1 of the current clubs goes under, then all of their member's jobs are at risk as the competition won't be viable anymore.   Australia was never the end destination for a player's journey - go overseas to earn more money. Milligan is the perfect example, he's achieved what he needed to here, and now he's gone OS for a payday."
Aleague,3b4glr,danperna,3,Fri Jun 26 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"You raise good points, though what I think is more interesting is  not the salary cap itself, but the complete freeze on salary cap increases, as the FFA has been steadily increasing the salary cap since the competition's inception.   Obviously this is not enough for the PFA's liking (Union's tend to fight tooth and nail for anything), though it seems quite contentious to freeze it entirely rather than continue slow growth.   The FFA are probably considering the financial turmoil some clubs are currently experiencing and trying to be cautious, to the chagrin of the PFA. This could be even more problematic if we consider what might have been said in the previous CBA meeting (e.g., if the FFA infered that the salary cap rules would be loosened in the future)."
Aleague,3b4glr,Walkerthon,2,Fri Jun 26 00:57:40 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, this iss the first time that a salary cap has been completely covered by the TV rights deal. So it's a prime chance to get the business model correct."

Aleague,3awl98,suicidal_smrtcar,3,Wed Jun 24 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think any athlete who is expected to represent their country should at least be paid enough so that it is their full time job and enough to make it an attractive profession. I have no idea how much the Matildas receive from their individual club contracts so don't know whether the $21,000 per year is reasonable. If their club doesn't provide a reasonable income, then they should be paid more in guaranteed income from the Matildas. My main issue is regarding match fees. I think it is unreasonable to pay players the same amount for a game that attracts a few thousand people that they do for a game that attracts 10's of thousands of people. That is the reality of the profession. I wonder whether, if the match fees were the same, the FFA (and other governing bodies) would be running at a loss a lot of the time?"
Aleague,3awl98,Mello-D,2,Wed Jun 24 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"well the salary cap for the W League is $150,000, so that pretty much tells you how much they are paid."

Aleague,3awl98,Mickeyjohn10,0,Wed Jun 24 03:23:38 2015 UTC,o<|:o)
Aleague,3awl98,stationhollow,3,Wed Jun 24 03:30:14 2015 UTC,It's not about how good they are it's about viewership. The best athletes in the world at the Olympics get paid fuck all unless they're sponsored (aka paying for popularity not ability). I think it's justified since the women's viewerships are about 100+ times less than the men's World Cup.
Aleague,3awl98,sick_yilmaz,0,Wed Jun 24 03:30:18 2015 UTC,Lol the Olympics has always been about amateur sport until fairly recently. Amateur as in they don't get paid... Arguing that they weren't paid when it was set up specifically an amateur comp is a bit silly.
Aleague,3awl98,Mickeyjohn10,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:39:30 2015 UTC,Lol the same could be said for international duty in football. It's not suppose to be where you get your main income from (that's what club football is for).
Aleague,3awl98,SerTahu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:47:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they should be paid for being in the Olympics, and most Olympians don't even make much outside of the Olympics anyway. The point was to show that just because you're the best in the world at something doesn't mean you should be paid a lot for it, it comes down to demand and basic economics."
Aleague,3awl98,cynikles,9,Thu Jun 25 06:54:59 2015 UTC,"The numbers:   Matildas:  $150 daily wage plus:  $500 per standard international game  $500 per group-stage tournament game  $600 per round of 16-tournament game  $750 per tournament quarter-final  $1,250 per tournament semi-final or third or fourth-place playoff  $1,500 per tournament final  plus: an equal share in 30 per cent of all prize money  Socceroos' 2013/14 match fees:  $6,500 per standard international game  $7,500 per group-stage tournament game  $8,500 per round 16 game  $9,500 per tournament quarter-final  $11,500 per tournament semi-final or 3rd v 4th playoff   When it comes to sports I think a wage gap is actually somewhat justifiable, given that the top tier of women's sport isn't (and never will be) physically/athletically at the same level as the top tier of men's sports. However, that being said, a gap that large is rather ridiculous."
Aleague,3awl98,SerTahu,22,Fri Jun 26 06:28:07 2015 UTC,"Physical/athletic ability should have sod all to do with it. Popularity of the game has all to do with it. If there is more interest there is more sponsor money and there is more investment. While I agree that the pay difference is bollocks, there isn't nearly as much interest in the women's game to generate the revenue to justify wages as high as men.  In time this could well, and I hope it does, change"
Aleague,3awl98,ftez,12,Wed Jun 24 02:23:29 2015 UTC,"That's kind of tied in to my point. What I was getting at was that you wouldn't expect players in League Two to get paid as much as players in the EPL, or players in the NPLs to get paid as much as players in the A-League. The quality isn't as high, and as a result neither is the interest."
Aleague,3awl98,cynikles,3,Wed Jun 24 02:36:12 2015 UTC,"Precisely. You don't see European handball, or hockey players earning as much as male footballers, as there isn't as much money or interest in those sports. Unfortunately people aren't as willing to watch women play football as they are men, therefore less money is generated by women's football, which is then passed on to the players. This isn't an issue of equality, its about money."
Aleague,3awl98,stationhollow,3,Wed Jun 24 04:01:23 2015 UTC,"Whilst the revenue isn't that high for women's football I think that improving salaries, amount of matches played etc is a big starting point. Encourages more girls to stay in the game, allows them to improve in a more positive environment etc.   Participation levels at junior grades for girls are huge, and giving them something to aspire too and look up to will go a long way in increasing the financial outlook for female teams."
Aleague,3awl98,daamsie,5,Wed Jun 24 03:33:21 2015 UTC,"Chicken, egg argument, mate. Need revenue to fund salaries but you want higher salaries to encourage more/better players to get that revenue.  Professional sport is a luxury occupation. I want people to be able to aspire to that profession, but the people, corporates and their wallets are what keeps them going. Companies go under if they can't sell their product. Pro sport is no different."
Aleague,3awl98,Mfrendin_Roar,2,Wed Jun 24 04:34:10 2015 UTC,"I agree but in the same regard I don't think you can completely treat them the same as a result of social convention. Male sports were always the pinnacle and were allowed to become more commercial as society changed. Female sports are viewed as second class, and society still very much views sport as a male only bastion. I don't think women's football will improve in a similar trajectory as mens because of this and in some ways needs to be forced into the national psyche."
Aleague,3awl98,cynikles,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:45:37 2015 UTC,It's a luxury though. Are you pushing for men's netball to receive more participation and funding as well or are you only focusing on sports that you like where women are disenfranchised. It is a much greater problem that just increasing wages. Is it worth it in your mind for higher wages to be paid then have the whole sport fold within less than a decade due to constant financial losses since the revenue doesn't match the wages?
Aleague,3awl98,Mfrendin_Roar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:56:44 2015 UTC,"If you consider the attention the Matildas would be getting if they got in the final (or even semi-final), it would actually be higher than a Socceroos ""standard international game"". And yet, even for that level of achievement, they would be paid less than a quarter of what the Socceroos would get. I do feel like those fees could be closer.   FFA also understands that the Matildas are a key part in motivating young girls to play football at local sporting clubs. And there's a flow-on effect from that as well, including better w-league & a-league attendances.   Anyway, it's complicated, but I do support their push for better pay."
Aleague,3awl98,sebaajhenza,0,Thu Jun 25 04:42:23 2015 UTC,your right. But I feel if male players were playing in a competition very similar to this they would be getting payed more then 150 a day. Using that as a sole excuse just excuses this.
Aleague,3awl98,sick_yilmaz,3,Wed Jun 24 13:53:25 2015 UTC,"They would and are. The girls could possible be paid more now for all I know, but there is less money in the sport.  Can't imagine the Australian curling or handball team gets paid a whole lot either for the same reason.   While I think there should be more promotion of the women's game to get more people out there in the stands and excited for it, you can't force people to go and pay and you can't can't make sponsors fork out their money either unless you have someone like Lowy and Westfield who have a passion for the game.   Australia is god damn lucky that we have so many pro sports in this country. We're mad about sport here, but it is a product for an audience. If there is no demand for a product, the product cannot succeed. If you are only selling small amounts of the product, you can't afford to pay your workers $10,000 bonuses every month.  As I say, wages could well be better than they are now, and I hope the PFA squeezes as much as they can out of the FFA to get the bonuses and base pay rate up but the FFA don't have an endless fountain of money. There will be a limit to how much they can pay because the womens game doesn't make as much money."
Aleague,3awl98,sebaajhenza,3,Wed Jun 24 05:14:18 2015 UTC,"yeah I know... I'm just saying that the product isn't that bad, like I said the men would be paid more I'm sure if they were in a similar situation. This product debate moves away from the fact that women are not receiving their MRP (marginal revenue product)"
Aleague,3awl98,stationhollow,4,Wed Jun 24 05:36:43 2015 UTC,It'd be easy enough to do a rough comparison. How many views do the women's games get? Find a men's match with similar views and compare the two wages.
Aleague,3awl98,sick_yilmaz,2,Wed Jun 24 06:57:46 2015 UTC,It's not just views. The socceroos do way more media and they have a lot more sponsorship agreements to do.
Aleague,3awl98,MCSFC,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:54:52 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, but even not taking that into consideration; I think the popularity of the telecasts alone would explain the discrepancy in salaries."

I understand that this is a totally subjective topic, but I think people are jumping the gun a little to quickly when it comes to criticising Arsenal's Puma kits. It kind of feels like it's the blanket, in-vogue opinion, and that kinda shits me.  My thoughts on what Arsenal's kits infer for ours:  1) So firstly, the tightness of the kits always seem to draw some ire. I agree that they look dumb, but as a grabby midfielder, I completely understand their functional advantage. To me, that makes it worthwhile.  2) Arsenal's history very clearly looms large on Puma's designs, something that I feel the club itself wants. For Sydney FC, this'll be less of a factor, given that we ain't got a whole lot of history.  3) I don't think there's anything overly complex or over-the-top when it comes to Arsenal's kits (except for maybe those new white underarm patches). I imagine the same sort of simplicity will stand for Sydney FC.  The real problem when it comes to our kit is fucking Webjet and their big fuck off mouse plane. That'll be the real gear grinder here."
Aleague,3atcw9,jniko,3,Tue Jun 23 15:49:05 2015 UTC,The real problem when it comes to our kit is fucking Webjet and their big fuck off mouse plane.   I've been putting off buying a shirt simply because of that.

However the design for this years kit was atrocious. Next seasons away kit is even worse. It looks straight from the 90's and not in a good way. Arsenal always looks the best in classic kits."

Aleague,3arsuu,gripes23q,9,Tue Jun 23 00:20:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you... Although there is always room for improvement in referee decision making, I would argue that poor decisions from players was much more of a deciding factor."
Aleague,3arsuu,Brisbanealchemist,2,Tue Jun 23 02:18:47 2015 UTC,"Fair point, however poor player decision making is part of the game and what makes a player good or bad or any shade in between.  Poor referree decisions impact the fairness of a result and therefore have a bigger impact."
Aleague,3arsuu,wanderingrhino,4,Tue Jun 23 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"How many poor referee decisions do you actually see a match?  How does that compare to Serie A, La Liga, EPL, World Cup etc?  I honestly don't think that poor referee decisions occur that often...  People thinking that the referee has f***ed up is scarily common though.  And you are more likely to see someone miss a sitter than a referee incorrectly award a penalty (although it happens)"
Aleague,3arsuu,Brisbanealchemist,3,Tue Jun 23 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"Comparisons are unnecessary, in any league one poor ref decision is one too many. Of course that is idealism and is unattainable, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try and get as close as possible by doing things such as freeing up a refs week so he/she can focus solely on refereeing."

Remember Pohl cautioning the same player 3 times in the World cup? -You can't remove the human element.  When the NPL is a better standard and is a viable second-tier competition, then yes, full time referees should be considered and appointed...  But at the moment there isn't enough demand...  Not without hurting the development of other referees."
Aleague,3arsuu,Brisbanealchemist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:37:40 2015 UTC,"Your first paragraph and Pohl comment, I already covered that.  I didn't mean refs should focus on refereeing all the time, I was alluding to the reduction of stress due to only having one job to worry about (plus maybe time to have a hobby as well). People are better at their jobs when they are less stressed.   Gotta do it one day, better too early than too late. I really don't see the 'too early' issues you raise as much of a concern, valid, but I think the FFAs timing is right."
Aleague,3arsuu,IvanEedle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:56:12 2015 UTC,I agree it will happen... I don't think that it is just yet...  We have a really good group of referees in the Y-League...  I don't want to see their development harmed by appointing professional referees.
Aleague,3arsuu,Brisbanealchemist,2,Tue Jun 23 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"Lol I got it, you think it's too early ;)  Question, Y-League probably won't last much longer, do you feel that the member federation NPLs can foster new ref talent as well as the Y-L?"
Aleague,3arsuu,IvanEedle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"I think that the NPL has the potential more referee talent, which is probably a good thing for the game... Especially as it grows."
Aleague,3arsuu,Brisbanealchemist,2,Tue Jun 23 06:51:05 2015 UTC,I probably agree with you.  I just don't think comparing refferee error to player error is all that relevant.
Aleague,3arsuu,wanderingrhino,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:43:43 2015 UTC,"It probably isn't that relevant... But at the same time, people want to blame players for one referee decision that changes the course of a match, regardless of whatever else happens."

Aleague,3arsuu,Shazbah91,5,Tue Jun 23 00:15:32 2015 UTC,"How much will this actually do to make the refs ""better"". The referees are still going to make mistakes, just like full time referees in England, Spain, Germany etc. do, and the Australian public will continue to have such an us against them attitude towards referees.   Even if the referees become of much higher quality, there will still be mistakes that send people on rage trips, diving to ridiculously controversial and conspiratorial conclusions.  It will all just seem worse when you see these are now ""full time professional"" referees who still make mistakes. They're supposed to perfect now they're getting paid a salary right?  I honestly don't think the refs were bad in the first place, and this is just a reaction to a collective whinge on social media that the game in Australia is being ruined by these terrible blind people running around with whistles, listening to what the players say to guide their decisions.  I think the biggest problem in Australia is our attitude towards referees. We're absolutely horrible towards them and give them shit for every decision they make, right or wrong, and this attitude is leaking through to the grassroots, where referees are treated as an opposition to both teams. Where they are merely something standing in the way of your team's success, and not somebody just trying to do their job keeping the game fair for both sides.  If anything, I'm just happy for the refs who will be able to live their lives solely focusing on their passion. It can't hurt to have full time refs but I don't see why getting paid a salary will turn them into much better practicers of their trade. Perhaps it'll give young referees something to aspire to, but honestly, if they're willing to sacrifice so much of their lives to be a part-time referee, they are already the right people for the job.  The best way for a referee to get better is through experience, and there is a limit to how many games one person can safely do per week. Sure, they will have the entire rest of the week to prepare for their games, but in the end it's the match experience that counts, and these refs that will go pro were already doing loads of games per week.  And please, for the love of god, don't attach GoPros to the refs, or microphones."
Aleague,3arsuu,PooDiePie,3,Tue Jun 23 03:33:22 2015 UTC,"Probably the best comment written on here. I don't think this will fix anything as there isn't anything broken. The standard is quite good and while there are contentious decisions, you get those in every game. Referees are only human and thus will make mistakes no matter how well trained they are.   Just remember that NRL have had full time referees for a while now, has that fixed the issues with referees? I think in their case they have over complicated things by adding in another referee and a video ref. Sometimes less is more..."
Aleague,3arsuu,Rupro_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:14:07 2015 UTC,"Strebre let a boot to Smeltz's head that cut him open go unchecked and gave a penalty to a clear dive by Ryall.  Ben Williams ruins games; notably that one where he sent off that Iranian player and even John Aloisi said he got it wrong. And just ask any Wellington fan how impartial he's been towards them this year.  No, what we need to do is promote good state league referees and weed out the ones not up to spec or unable to adapt their officiating. There's a culture of not being able to criticise refeeres and give them feedback or question their performance, yet if they're human, the same argument advanced for NOT getting stuck into them, then humans can also have bad days, so constructive criticism should be taken on board. Just because it makes people uncomfortable to think that they might have made a mistake is no reason to silence dissent or criticism."

Aleague,3arsuu,cynikles,2,Tue Jun 23 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"I think that this could be a serious mistake in terms of referee development, for the following reasons:   Over the last few years, the best referees in Australia have been from Brisbane (like it or not).  This move towards professional referees has happened over the last couple of years, which has resulted in the appointment of referees to the A-League based on a Sydney-centric approach, rather than talent. (This has happened over the last couple of years, with some very talented referees being dropped from the A-League panel or not being promoted to the A-League panels and quitting)   Currently referees at A-League level are inspected (almost) every match, and there is a match review by phone/skype weekly...  Although there are advantages to having the referees together, are those advantages outweighing the costs?  (accommodation, living expenses, wages etc) What is going to happen when a professional referee has a shocker?  -Are you going to sack him?  How would that fly in FWA if a sacked referee makes a claim against the FFA? (You won't be able to just demote them from the A-League, like what happened to Sarah Ho last season) Are there enough games weekly to ensure that referees are getting the appropriate match practise (of sufficient standard) to maintain their skills?  -This is, in my opinion, the biggest factor in referee mistakes in the A-League at the moment. Finally, two words: Ben Williams.   I am not setting out to be a Negative Nancy here, I am just wondering if these things have been considered...."
Aleague,3arsuu,Brisbanealchemist,4,Tue Jun 23 00:38:54 2015 UTC,"While your concerns are valid, I think a large part of the decision was based around the well-being of referees.weekly continental travel and a thankless job is not great for mental health when you're also trying to balance a regular job and maybe a family. At least now they can dedicate all their resources to refereeing"
Aleague,3arsuu,Walkerthon,3,Tue Jun 23 01:51:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the decision was really based around the well-being of referees, to be honest.

Aleague,3arsuu,Brisbanealchemist,3,Tue Jun 23 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"It is more about a perception that our referees are crap, when realistically, they are as good as in larger competitions or better.   I might have to get this quote framed. Couldn't agree more. We, as a nation, need to chill out when a referee makes a bad decision. Instead we get riled up like there's no tomorrow, and suddenly forget that in the EPL, the wrong player was sent off for something he didn't do, that guy who was called offside when he was 10m inside his own half.  The same ridiculous articles and social media conspiracies are flying around all over the world, I would say even moreso in leagues with full time referees.  Just have a look at this POS article from HALFWAY through last season's EPL.  This guy analysed FOUR games from ONE weekend of the EPL and managed to pull several ""not just questionable, but downright terrible"" decisions out of them.  Quotes include:   Some of the errors made have been astonishingly bad, and have left me wondering two things: do they actually know the laws of the game? And secondly, are they actually watching the game properly?      Honest mistakes are fine, but these are the kind of blunders which if translated and applied to other jobs would get people sacked or killed. A lorry driver doesn't look properly as he approaches a roundabout – it's potentially fatal. If I don't know broadcasting law, I might say something I'm not allowed to and I get sacked from talkSPORT.   He's seriously pulling comparisons out of his arse. In what world is it as simple to look to your right at a roundabout as it is to monitor 22 players + players on the bench + managers + coaching staff and apply fair jurisdiction from a lengthy laws book onto all of them.  It's sure as hell easier to be a talkSPORT journalist if you can get paid for this failed attempt at a scientific analysis.   I think subconsciously some referees and linesmen have 'downed tools' and stopped doing their jobs properly, stopped concentrating, stopped watching the game closely. Why? Because they want more technology to come in so they can wash their hands of any responsibility. They know they'll still get paid as professional refs, but they also know there will be less pressure on them as individuals because they'll be able to refer incidents to a 'video ref.'  Back to basics please. Ref it right, or ref off.   Now he's just taking the piss. This is a whole other argument that doesn't really relate to what we're talking about here but I thought I'd put it in anyway because it really is a laughable comment that I don't want to waste time or my phone's battery life ranting about, so I'll let you guys form your own opinion about that one.  Now this article is a ridiculous pile of arse, but I just used it to show that these issues with referees aren't exclusive to us here in Australia. I think we're just more upset about our own referees because we're more attached to our local teams."

I'm sorry, but until the NPL is of a high enough quality that Promotion-relegation would almost be a possibility, there just isn't the demand for professional referees.

Feels like the referee quality has been stagnant for a few seasons while the rest of the league has been improving.   Hopefully this will give more opportunity for referees to develop and raise the standard of play in the league.
Aleague,3arsuu,AlarmClockBandit,5,Tue Jun 23 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the quality of the refereeing has been stagnant...  many of the A-League/FIFA referees have been appointed to better and better games in Asia and we have done really well in the World and Asian Cups from a refereeing perspective (as much as I hate Ben Williams).  As the A-League has gotten faster and more technical, mistakes (and perceived mistakes) from referees have been focussed on... In some cases, rather unfairly.  Fans think that referees benefit from the thousands of slow-motion replays that they get, when referees get 1 go, at full-speed and without multiple angles.  -I would say, from the football that I have seen, that the A-League referees are making way fewer mistakes than players in a match...  It is just that referees are under the microscope... and who doesn't want to blame the referee for their team's misfortunes."

Aleague,3asx8b,malbn,-1,Tue Jun 23 07:03:04 2015 UTC,"I'd be very happy for him to go to the EPL and he's good enough to play there. It's not even the fact that he's leaving, we should be thankful we even kept him this long. It's just... ugh."
Aleague,3asx8b,vendilion,11,Wed Jun 24 06:54:52 2015 UTC,@Neroli_M_FOX: Victory captain Mark Milligan tells @FOXSportsNews he hasn't done a deal yet. The photo doing the rounds is from the archives.
Aleague,3asx8b,falisimoses,5,Tue Jun 23 07:20:25 2015 UTC,Daniel Garb @DanielGarb 14m14 minutes ago That Milligan pic in Abu Dhabi is old. He's in Aus. Deal to Baniyas not signed off on yet but imminent. Final details to still be agreed.
Aleague,3asx8b,AvocadoCake,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:23:11 2015 UTC,Oh yeah he'll be gone soon enough. Any idea who Victory would like to bring in?
Aleague,3asx8b,falisimoses,4,Tue Jun 23 07:26:57 2015 UTC,"Well there's this club up north we have a pretty good relationship with. I hear they have this kid named 'Brattan', so there's that.joking but sorta not  People are throwing Holland's and Bresciano's names around, I'd much prefer Mooy/Brattan, but the A-League transfer rules might get in the way of that."
Aleague,3asx8b,AvocadoCake,2,Tue Jun 23 07:30:21 2015 UTC,"With all the Roar bullshit that's going down I'm expecting him to go. Why play for a club who won't pay you on time? It's completely not on.  Bitterness aside, Bresc was looking busted at the Asian Cup.... Don't know if he'd be worth it. Holland would be a good pick up though."
Aleague,3asx8b,falisimoses,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:37:44 2015 UTC,Oh fuck I hope it's not Bresc. He's done. We don't need some hasbeen clunking along and cashing in marquee wages. We need a leader.  I'd rather grab somone in the mid 20's who's ready to take another step up. That was where Milligan was when we signed him.
Aleague,3asx8b,vendilion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:56:43 2015 UTC,Lol >:(
Aleague,3asx8b,IvanEedle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:50:09 2015 UTC,"I think the club will target Holland, but probably won't get him. From there they'll probably look at Brattansorry  I honestly don't know who else we can go at. The requirements would be:   Is Australian. Is the same type of player: Tough, defensive oriented box-to-box midfielder. Is worth marquee wages. Is not too old. (Rules out Bresciano.)"
Aleague,3asx8b,vendilion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:55:41 2015 UTC,"Only thing with Brattan is he's still contracted so there will have to be mutual termination or whatever they do. I really want him to stay, but it's just a mess up here and I wouldn't blame a few players wanting to take off.  Yeah I can't think of many players you can bring in. I'm sure you'll manage to find someone decent enough. Kevin's been surprisingly impressive in regards to recruitment."
Aleague,3asx8b,falisimoses,2,Wed Jun 24 08:12:38 2015 UTC,Hoping he was offloaded to make room for already signed players and not to lure back Spira to Melbourne.
Aleague,3asx8b,rodz7,2,Tue Jun 23 07:08:59 2015 UTC,No plausible reason for us to release him since we don't get Transfer fees between clubs.
Aleague,3asx8b,notbilbo,3,Tue Jun 23 07:11:21 2015 UTC,Unless Spira chucks the shits and asks out because Melbourne have something better on the table. Teams tend not to keep unhappy players.
Aleague,3asx8b,cynikles,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:15:57 2015 UTC,"WSW would be well within their rights to keep him, then spira would be risking a years playing time, possibly his spot in the socceroos. And if he doesnt play much or well for a year, his unsigned contract with victory. I cant wait"
Aleague,3asx8b,littlejib,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:27:37 2015 UTC,But we would be wasting Aussie marquee wages for him to sit on the bench. The whole situation is a double edged sword and WSW fans are just hoping it is completely avoided.
Aleague,3asx8b,Zeezer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:15:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he could force his way out. But with aspo coming through, popa could call his bluff"
Aleague,3asx8b,littlejib,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:11:44 2015 UTC,"If he's desperately 'homesick' and we allow him. Otherwise, we may pay marquee salary to bench him out of spite. Fingers crossed it doesn't come to that."
Aleague,3asx8b,rodz7,0,Tue Jun 23 09:14:50 2015 UTC,"He was on marquee wages so they don't count against the cap. He left because he wanted to, I feel as though the club would have kept him if they could.  I think you can rest easy on the Spira thing. I don't think he's been cited as someone we would or should be interested in."
Aleague,3asx8b,vendilion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"But him freeing up the marquee spot allows the club to move someone into it for accounting reasons to ease pressure on the cap.   If he doesn't go back to Melbourne in the next 18 months, I'd be shocked.   He can play holding/defensive midfielder."
Aleague,3asx8b,rodz7,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:09:26 2015 UTC,"Who do you you think would be our marquee then? I don't think anyone on our list is on big enough pay for that to be a good financial decision.  Are you saying Milligan or Spira can play defensive midfield? Spira is over 190cm, I thought he was a lanky CB."
Aleague,3asx8b,vendilion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:11:55 2015 UTC,"If the veteran cap arrangement goes through, Archie would fit under the cap, but someone like Vuka might be moved as marquee simply to leave cap room.   Spira was originally a holding midfielder. He converted in the last few years to revive his career."
Aleague,3asx8b,rodz7,2,Wed Jun 24 22:06:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I'm being downvoted for asking basic questions. Thanks for giving answers. Are you sure Archie will be a strain on the cap, I can't imagine he'd be on a large amount by now."
Aleague,3asx8b,vendilion,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:08:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure. I just gave you one up. This sub has random visitors sometimes I imagine.   I don't imagine he'd be on less than 150K, but it does start add up. I know Coe and Nabbout took a fair chunk, but you've re-signed good players."

Aleague,3asy6n,Looking_For_Droids,3,Tue Jun 23 08:08:36 2015 UTC,"Having had a chat with Craig myself when he was with the club as a player, he really loves the game. Really personable guy with a pretty professional attitude. I was really surprised when I heard about the way in which he left in 2009 as it really didn't seem to fit his character. I can imagine he'd be great to have around the club again."
Aleague,3asy6n,TheFightingImp,2,Tue Jun 23 08:42:50 2015 UTC,"Given the turmoil in the club at the moment, perhaps there is a beacon of hope. Apart from /u/mironb and/or /u/meapa taking over the manager role."

Aleague,3aov04,GeorgeDyer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:54:18 2015 UTC,"They don't want clubs to have ethnic allegiances. This is because a match between a 'Hakoah' team and a team with a Muslim allegiance, or a Melbourne Croatia vs insert Serbian team match can have political vibes that are really something you want to avoid. Of course, I can completely understand why a club/its fans would feel like this is unfair, especially when clause 1.6 reads:   This Policy does not apply to references to Australia or the use of the Australian national flag.   There's also an unenforced FFA rule against bringing flags to a football match (didn't see too many people getting evicted for bringing Japanese flags back when Ono was here):   not, and must not attempt to, bring into a venue national or political flags or emblems (except for the recognised national flags of any of the competing teams) or offensive or inappropriate banners, whether written in English or a foreign language;   No one cares about this rule because it is unenforced, but that's been the FFA's stance since (at least) 2006."
Aleague,3aov04,AvocadoCake,8,Tue Jun 23 08:15:39 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the club identity policy, it only serves to alienate large sections of the footballing community.   In fact my major gripe with Gallop is the way he has worked to exclude all ideas of differences from football since taking over. One of footballs great strengths is that it's a sport and past time that represents everyone, not just anglo-celtic australias. We should be celebrating the multiculturalism of football and cultural diversity and yet we are trying to get as far away from it as possible. Look at the whole of football plan, considering it's meant to represent the ""whole of the football"" community it's amazing that it only has the words ""multicultural(ism)"" in it once and immigrant(s)(ion) a grand total of 0 times, seems like a whitewash of who football in this country represents.  Now I completely agree with no longer having the ethnic based clubs in the top division. The A League is and was the best thing to happen to Football in this country and has made strides that the NSL never could have. But what I don't agree with is not allowing clubs to maintain an identity around their community. In the end as football gets bigger big ethnic clubs are going to have to adapt or they're going to die a long slow death, (looking at you Melbourne Knights) but there shouldn't be any issue with having local amateur clubs put together to celebrate their local community."

Aleague,3adrlf,Mello-D,11,Fri Jun 19 08:05:39 2015 UTC,"Good evening A-Leaguers,  Macclesfield fan here. Alex Grant is a decent young player, he performed very well for us, especially for his age in what is quite a physical league. Did well to adapt to our thin and ever-changing squad playing at both centre back and left back (I believe he also played a match at right back, but I wasn't at that match so I cannot say). He's been mostly paired at the back with George Pilkington and assistant coached by Efe Sodje, two great leaders with bags of experience. You can expect him to have learned a thing or two.  He played 22 full matches, and was voted fans' man of the match 4 times (one of those shared).  Serious and committed to the cause from day one, great player to have in a squad. I'm sure we would have attempted to re-sign him but no one blames him for being attracted to the relative riches and notoriety of top flight Australian soccer."
Aleague,3adrlf,Anglocatalan,3,Fri Jun 19 13:17:53 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a positive sign. Seems like a decent young player. Hope he gets the chance to develop more the Glory. With their bare bones team at the moment, I think he'll get plenty of exposure. Must be pretty cheap too."
Aleague,3adrlf,cynikles,2,Fri Jun 19 08:10:55 2015 UTC,"Looks like a straight up replacement for Scott Jamieson at left back, albeit a very young and inexperienced one.     It's important to note that while the article states that he played for both Portsmouth and Stoke City, he made a combined total of one appearance between the two, in a league cup match for Pompy. He was one loan at 6th tier Havant & Waterlooville FC (18 apps) for the bulk of his time at Portsmouth, and then on loan at Macclesfield Town (28 apps) for his time at Stoke.  This isn't to say that it's a terrible move and so forth, I just don't think it is something to get too excited about just yet."
Aleague,3acqsk,c00kie7,14,Fri Jun 19 01:24:34 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, a Standard Liege spokesman has revealed the leading Belgian Pro League club is no longer in negotiations with Cahill's fellow Australia international Juric, who departed Western Sydney Wanderers at the end of the A-League season and is looking to seal a deal in Europe.   That's a shame."
Aleague,3acqsk,CheapTrick32,12,Fri Jun 19 02:17:24 2015 UTC,"This is the more worrying part:   The spokesman said: ""There have been too many agents complicating the issue, and we haven't been able to come to a resolution and have decided to move on.""   This could easily become a problem when looking at other clubs if you're agent is shit."
Aleague,3acqsk,cynikles,8,Fri Jun 19 02:21:39 2015 UTC,"The same thing seemed to happen at Shanghai:    “Mandic negotiated a contract for his client Juric worth equal to AUD$18 million for three years to play for Shanghai Shenhua,” he said. “Unfortunately many other agents get involved in the contract [with a result of] confusion, problems and silly negotiating games.""   http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/football/tomi-jurics-missed-out-on-18m-payday-as-chinese-club-shanghai-shenhua-withdraw-offer/story-fnk6rpye-1227173042744  Not a good sign unfortunately."

Aleague,3acqsk,JuiceSpringsteen8,5,Fri Jun 19 06:58:38 2015 UTC,"You can sign a domestic player to an international marquee spot but not vice versa. So without Janko, they would be free to go in for Cahill if they had the cash.   I don't think Timmy is the kind of striker we'd want in any case.

Aleague,3acqsk,littlejib,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:42:55 2015 UTC,I was thinking of something like this with Valeri at the back. It could work.
Aleague,3acqsk,vendilion,2,Fri Jun 19 06:46:31 2015 UTC,"It would be so lop sided, with Cahill playing the cm?  Cahill isnt fit enough to track back that much.

Galloway is plenty good enough to start in a title-winning team, and Murnane is a decent backup, but we're thin up front. With Pain likely to be on his way out, we'll have 3 wingers for 2 positions in the squad.  I'm genuinely not that concerned with the Georgievski situation - I'd rather he leaves and we get a CB (2 for 2 positions) or less importantly, a striker (only Bes/Archie) instead of have us go into a season with ACL, FFA Cup and A-League to compete for, while we have to rely 30+ year olds on the wing and at the back. I don't think Delpierre can play 3 games a week and both FBK and Archie would seriously struggle to do so.  Note: http://www.melbournevictory.com.au/player/fahid-ben-khalfallah/pnfp4bvpi9941bfag0d469x2c says he started 24 and was subbed off 10 times in 27 appearances, (that's wrong - he did not play all 27 in the regular season, he missed one due to suspension), FBK rarely completed and 90, and Archie even less."

Aleague,3acdnr,vendilion,5,Fri Jun 19 05:42:41 2015 UTC,"So after he served his 1 year contract as a solid part out of a double winning team after his return to australia, he should just put up and shut up with whatever offer he gets?

Aleague,3acdnr,littlejib,-4,Fri Jun 19 06:20:46 2015 UTC,I doubt we aren't offering him what he's worth.

Frustrating to lose it to two sloppy goals after playing so well, but we just weren't clinical enough. The winner from Depay makes me so fucking salty. Gets one look from outside the box and it goes in after we fumbled and mumbled clear cut chances constantly for the whole game.  The Cahill goal is probably the best Socceroos goal ever. I didn't even get to celebrate it properly because I was too busy trying to figure out if it actually fucking happened."
Aleague,3a94wl,vendilion,0,Fri Jun 19 03:18:40 2015 UTC,"Laughing at all these comments.    ""Schwarzer would've saved all those goals!""  ""Ryan is suck a shitty goalkeeper""  ""goalkeeper lost the game.  Hopefully thats the last time we see him in the world cup.""   Do these people watch 3 games and then suddenly know everything about all of the players on the pitch?   Maty Ryan has sure shown these uneducated pillocks who the best keeper in the country is, while Schwarzer (who is basically English let's be honest) continues to make stupid comments about the quality of home grown Australian football while hiding behind a hefty paycheck in the back room at Chelsea.  On a side note, I remember someone telling me Viduka was crap before the 06 world cup just because he missed his penalty against Uruguay. Although the kid who said that was only about 10 years old at the time, it was a stupid comment that has stuck with me to this day.  ~  /u/PooDiePie, football elitist since '06."

Sure, people like us said our heartfelt goodbyes, but the general public never got in on it because there was no socceroos hype."

Aleague,3a9eee,so_much_wut,8,Thu Jun 18 11:22:53 2015 UTC,Inb4 he wins the golden glove.
Aleague,3a9eee,kiac,8,Thu Jun 18 07:24:11 2015 UTC,"I don't enjoy trashing on players, and maybe he'll still find an ounce of ability, but he has just not been an A-League quality keeper.  The first couple of months of last season he had a fault in almost every one of our goals conceded. That doesn't mean I'm saying he's to blame, just that a better keeper would have done more. Just the little things, coming out too early, too late, bad positioning, flappy hands. It's not even the obvious stuff, he's not Brad Jones or Federici (who are otherwise solid keepers guilty of worldy fuckups), he just rarely saves the harder ones.  Take the 2-2 with CCM for example. Two good finishes, nothing glaringly bad about the keeping, and I know it's really harsh, but neither is in the corner or particularly well hit, I'd expect a keeper to pull out some good saves for both.  There's this one. Going almost in the bottom corner and he's so far out of position it's too high for him to reach it.  Then there is your obvious errors like the famous BOOOOOOM goal, which all keepers at this level do, so that's not reeeally my issue. He actually had a good game here, but then the result is ultimately hinged on his mistake.  I would say solid #2 signing, but really, you should be able to find a 20 year old that's going to offer just as much.  *Fixed links"
Aleague,3a9eee,cynikles,7,Thu Jun 18 08:06:05 2015 UTC,"What a bizarre signing. I suppose as a number 2 though he'd one of the most experienced options on the market (apart from Covic). I doubt he'll play much unless Bouzanis does atrociously.   Happy to see Bouzanis get a game to be honest, I think he could be a really good keeper with sustained game time."
Aleague,3a9eee,timmmy8,6,Thu Jun 18 08:17:27 2015 UTC,Hahahahaha
Aleague,3a9eee,963479,6,Thu Jun 18 11:07:52 2015 UTC,So I guess this means Bouzanis is first-choice? Not too happy with it tbh...
Aleague,3a9eee,birdy9221,5,Thu Jun 18 07:30:19 2015 UTC,Better than Covic based on last seasons form.
Aleague,3a9eee,963479,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:56:37 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right but I didn't think he was better than Covic when he played. At least Covic was making ""brain-snap"" type mistakes that could be due to form or concentration, Bouzanis for me just looks shaky overall."
Aleague,3a9eee,birdy9221,2,Thu Jun 18 13:45:37 2015 UTC,I was wanting Bouzanis to get more game time. He commands the whole penalty area. Something that covic doesnt. Corner landing on the 6yd box? Covic will let defenders deal with it. Bouzanis is out to punch it away.
Aleague,3a9eee,Kamone1202,3,Thu Jun 18 14:13:08 2015 UTC,"A very uninspiring signing. Happy to give him a chance, maybe training under spider will turn his game around but it seems like a long shot"
Aleague,3a9eee,Mello-D,3,Thu Jun 18 07:37:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think they would spend the money on a back up, otherwise they'd just re-sign Covic on minimal coin. Good luck WSW."
Aleague,3a9eee,matts24,3,Thu Jun 18 08:28:55 2015 UTC,"His contributions off the field are a plus, and I imagine he'll be useful in the sense that Jerrad Tyson was useful to the club. In saying that, why they didn't just bring back Tyson is beyond me, being a free agent now and all. You would think that he wouldn't cost too much $$$ and is arguably the better keeper."
Aleague,3a9eee,bamboosaou,3,Thu Jun 18 23:33:33 2015 UTC,"So we let Covic, who's been a classy keeper for us, go for this retard? Fuck me our club management has been shithouse if we keep going for apes like this."

Aleague,3a8avk,GetUpMorningMVFC,9,Thu Jun 18 00:41:22 2015 UTC,"I've got some questions about a deal like this and my questions don't apply to just City but to all clubs in the league so if anyone could ELI5 to me, that would be great. I'm sorry if the questions sound dumb but:   What if Jeep independently approached Kewell with this carrot to incentivize him to return to the A-League and Heart at that time had no contact with Jeep and was just tabling to Kewell what Heart could afford as a club? What is stopping a company that has affiliation with a club and start offering sponsorships to players that a rival club might sign to potentially blow out their salary cap? Does a club have the authority to police every sponsorship deal that is tabled to their players? Is this what FFA is trying to find out?   We are obviously at fault if Heart were in cahoots with Jeep to bring Kewell back and not reporting the additional incentives but how could FFA prove that if it's not stipulated in Heart's contract tabled to Kewell?"
Aleague,3a8avk,alvinng,6,Thu Jun 18 01:26:44 2015 UTC,Another question. Who will be held responsible for any consequences seeing as Melbourne Heart don't exist anymore? Does ex Heart CEO Scott Munt cop this?
Aleague,3a8avk,alvinng,5,Thu Jun 18 03:37:17 2015 UTC,I don't think the fact that Heart doesn't exist anymore would change anything. The club still largely has the same management staff. Wouldn't mind seeing Munn cop it if we were found guilty though.
Aleague,3a8avk,vendilion,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:46:18 2015 UTC,City hold Heart's original license so for the purposes of this they will probably held responsible for it as if they were Heart. That being said this sounds like a beat up and I doubt anything will happen.
Aleague,3a8avk,wanderingrhino,2,Fri Jun 19 03:41:02 2015 UTC,"Excellent questions.  Fundamentally the Salary cap will have flaws and grey areas.  The issue is,  this has to policed l, but Kewell is within his rights to be employed by Jeep as a spokesman.  So, i guess ir comes down to, will Kewell come to Heart even if there is no Jeep?"
Aleague,3a8avk,Methstar,2,Thu Jun 18 02:37:09 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Carlton tried to organize a deal similar to this with Chris Judd and Visy. Not sure if it worked out."
Aleague,3a8avk,kiac,3,Thu Jun 18 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"It actually did. The game's best player was signed by one of the biggest clubs that had been in the dumps for a decade. It suited the AFL, so they let it slide. For four years he got an outside of the cap $250k annual salary while Carlton needed the help, until they finally could pull off keeping him under the cap in 2012.  http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-cracks-down-on-judd-visy-deal-20121115-29fo0.html"
Aleague,3a8avk,vendilion,0,Thu Jun 18 07:32:22 2015 UTC,Hilariously enough it did nothing to help them. Judd was the most overrated player of his generation and achieved nothing at Carlton except being mistakenly awarded Lenny Hayes' Brownlow in 2010.
Aleague,3a8avk,vendilion,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:47:43 2015 UTC,I don't know what is official but it's a widely known fact that they were using his partnership with Visy to secretly shovel him bucketloads of cash. As usual the AFL didn't care because they're corrupt and will let anything that serves their financial priorities slide. See: Letting Essendon stay in the league after they were caught deliberately drug cheating.
Aleague,3a8avk,StonerJack,2,Fri Jun 19 03:46:23 2015 UTC,"I would suppose that is what the ""emails and other correspondence"" is for. I remember Kewell signing for Heart on minimum wage and they were very open about his salary being topped up by his existing sponsorship's and endorsements. I'm not sure those existing deals would be an issue with the salary cap because they aren't anything to do with the club and are between the player and the sponsors. I think it's all legit unless this Jeep deal didn't exist prior to him signing for the club."
Aleague,3a8avk,alvinng,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know when the wheels came into motion with Heart signing him and Jeep offering him a sponsorship but I was very sure Heart announced the signing in June 2013 and his Jeep 3 year contract was announced by Jeep in July 2013. The dates the announcements were made could mean shit all though.  EDIT: And even though Kewell was on minimum wage, I think there were appearance and goal bonuses."
Aleague,3a8avk,AvocadoCake,4,Thu Jun 18 09:49:25 2015 UTC,"I hope the Perth revelations don't start a whole ""they signed a big name player, therefore they broke the salary cap"" mentality.

(if I remember correctly [I didn't remember correctly]) Sweden were in pretty ordinary form and we were doing pretty well but it just all fell apart. Elyse Perry's screamer from distance was the only good part of the game although I think she was also found out a bit defensively during the game too.

Aleague,39z8t1,angusozi,8,Tue Jun 16 00:05:23 2015 UTC,I'm expecting a few goals to be honest. We should really tear them apart and make a statement at the beginning of the campaign. I don't think Ange will let them take it too easy particularly now everyone is on holidays.
Aleague,39z8t1,cynikles,7,Tue Jun 16 00:30:10 2015 UTC,I think we are going to find this game very difficult. Kyrgyzstan will more than likely play very defensive on the break football and we seem to struggle a lot to break teams down with our technical ability. Optomistically i want us to rubber stamp our intentions and put them to the sword but realistically we will find this game a lot harder than most people expect
Aleague,39z8t1,Kamone1202,3,Tue Jun 16 00:51:13 2015 UTC,"Historically yes, we have had issues with that, but Kuwait and Oman tried to sit back and absorb the pressure and we broke them down, and both of those sides should mop the park with Kyrgyzstan. If we can't break this team down and score a few, then we have back slid a long way from what we achieved leading up to the Asian Cup."
Aleague,39z8t1,JuiceSpringsteen8,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:35:37 2015 UTC,Have to take into account the pitch too. It's worse than suncorp or my local park will ever be. It's an absolute shocker of a field so it will make it a lot harder for us to play a fast passing game like we did in the Asian cup
Aleague,39z8t1,Kamone1202,2,Tue Jun 16 06:16:32 2015 UTC,I'd hope that 8 years of us struggling against all manner of Asian opponents has made sure we never underestimate anyone.

Aleague,39z8t1,GK93,3,Tue Jun 16 06:41:56 2015 UTC,"I think we'll do well. Been in camp for a while now, and you saw at the world cup and the asian cup how well we play after going away and preparing well. Big unknown in Kyrgyzstan, but I don't think they will have the quality to shock us and steal a win, or even a draw. Should be a straight forward win similar to our first 2 games in the Asian Cup. I'm going with a 3 or 4 - nil."
Aleague,39z8t1,JuiceSpringsteen8,3,Tue Jun 16 00:09:04 2015 UTC,Any streams would be great as I am going to try and watch this on a flight today.

Aleague,39wghe,falisimoses,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:53:36 2015 UTC,When you can't sell your best players domestically the clubs need to find other avenues to raise revenue.  It is their game to flog off.  It might upset members; they need to communicate with their club how they feel about it.

Aleague,39wghe,Meapa,2,Tue Jun 16 08:47:25 2015 UTC,"Among the distance from the Central Coast and the inevitable uproar and protest about giving up a home game, I can see this match having the lowest home fan turnout in recent history."
Aleague,39wghe,Meapa,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be hard to beat NQF v Brisbane when they played the Gold Coast.. I'm pretty sure no NQF fans showed up to that game, after all.. only 1,003 showed up."
Aleague,39wghe,falisimoses,4,Tue Jun 16 06:03:41 2015 UTC,"What the fuck Melbourne.... Why must you be so stingy and move one of your own bloody games. You made the deal, toughen up and move one of your own games.  I'm glad it wasn't Brisbane losing the game, fuck no way I'd let another team grab an extra home game."
Aleague,39wghe,Meapa,7,Mon Jun 15 10:58:09 2015 UTC,"They can't move one of their home games because they're all contracted to either AAMI or Etihad, that's why they went sniffing elsewhere."
Aleague,39wghe,freeriderau,2,Mon Jun 15 11:17:45 2015 UTC,Shoulda been something they thought about prior to accepting the stadium contracts and the Geelong thing..
Aleague,39wghe,Meapa,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:29:35 2015 UTC,Wasn't an option.

Aleague,39wghe,timmmy8,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:37:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess it shouldn't be much of a surprise to me after the final stadium troubles...  I demand sauce bottle road trip!
Aleague,39wghe,timmmy8,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"Important to remember that Adelaide and Gold Coast did this year's ago also. Victory isn't breaking new ground here, nor is the FFA by allowing it."

Aleague,39w8yg,citrusparty,31,Mon Jun 15 08:44:18 2015 UTC,"Ryan no doubt.   He's won the best keeper award two seasons in a row in the Belgian league, is a far better distributor of the ball, has been making some great saves for the Socceroos now he has settled in and has played 77 club games in the last 2 years.  Meanwhile, Langerak has played 16 first-team club games in the past 5 years. He's also 3 years older than Ryan, yet has over 100 games less experience.   I don't understand how there's even a debate any more."
Aleague,39w8yg,JessePapa,13,Mon Jun 15 09:09:19 2015 UTC,Langerak's actually played 26 games if you count domestic cups and Europe.
Aleague,39w8yg,itisknown__,7,Mon Jun 15 10:21:35 2015 UTC,"ahh fair enough, should've done some proper fact checking before posting. That's still an incredibly low number over five years though"
Aleague,39w8yg,JessePapa,4,Mon Jun 15 10:46:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  Now he's 3rd choice at Dortmund given they've just signed Roman Bürki from Freiburg.  The time to leave is right now for Langerak, or he's well on his way to being left out of national squads all together."
Aleague,39w8yg,you_think_you_knowme,3,Mon Jun 15 09:33:49 2015 UTC,Actually talk of Werdenfeller (?) leaving Dortmund according to my mate who is a massive BvB fan
Aleague,39w8yg,timmmy8,2,Mon Jun 15 11:42:29 2015 UTC,Langerak would still be 2nd to Burki. Burki is very highly rated in the Buli.
Aleague,39w8yg,cynikles,9,Mon Jun 15 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"Ryan, but I think now is a good time for Langerak to leave Dortmund for first team football in a competitive league (the Championship, Belgium, Holland, somewhere like that). Then we will really see what he's made of :)"
Aleague,39w8yg,GeorgeDyer,7,Mon Jun 15 09:02:47 2015 UTC,"Ryan, mainly because he actually plays regularly. He also has good distribution which Ange values even if he looks a little shakey at times. Langerak would have a much better chance if he were first choice somewhere."
Aleague,39w8yg,miaowface,2,Mon Jun 15 08:57:24 2015 UTC,"There's no question. Ryan has proven himself now, His distribution is great, he's an excellent shot stopper, he's got a good eye for sweeping, and he's highly involved in any movement of the ball in the back-line. He's killing it in his league games, winning awards, is among the top in terms of players with games played in the last year.  Langerak is in a good club in a good league, but he's not getting game time, and when he does, there's still big question marks about him. He's unproven, lacking game time, less experienced, older, and not as versatile as a keeper.  There is really no question, it has to be Ryan."

Aleague,39v4l6,RichieMclad,4,Mon Jun 15 01:38:25 2015 UTC,Not too bad considering most of the real legends are pretty old now.  I might be biased 'coz I'm Aussie but I really enjoyed Kewell at LFC. Scored his first goal in the Merseyside derby and finished his first season only 9 goals behind Michael Owen (the season before Owen went to Real Madrid)   It just really sucks that he fell to injury after injury.

Aleague,39sr4f,rodz7,4,Sun Jun 14 21:26:58 2015 UTC,Well said. One of the things that annoys me most in my all ages comp is that everyone complains about nobody wanting to ref whilst then slaughtering the ref at every away games.   Give them a break. They'll make some bad calls (especially when they don't have linesmen) but we don't all need to be dicks about it
Aleague,39sr4f,Brisbanealchemist,6,Sun Jun 14 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I've never met a referee who admitted after the game he/she made a bad call.  I'm a 'chirper'. After every 50/50 call I'll ask or make a comment without being rude/swearing/giving attitude/raising my voice. It's annoying, but it tends to keep a lot of refs honest so their calls are more consistent and the match flows without getting out of hand. Without a doubt, it nets me a few more yellows.  I haven't played in a couple of years, but I always found the younger refs were more receptive and quickly justified their decisions which showed they played the game and understood the rules. Their interpretations would be more consistent and you could understand their decision making. Whereas, the older refs would botch a call that even the opposition would tell them it was incorrect and they'd become the ""Shut the fuck up or I'll give you a red"" type. More often than not, those matches would get out of hand. Yes, you're the ref, but if you act a wanker, no one is going to like you. Same as the aggressive coach or parent."

To be honest, if it's netting you yellows, doesn't sound like you are being very appropriate about it.

The better refs don't mind, as they usually explain before anyone says anything. After a couple of times, you understand their way and it becomes easier for him and no one is really challenging their calls. Being open rather than a ""shut the fuck up or it's a red"" makes it easier for both players and ref.

Of course we are going to make mistakes which even the other team would disagree. We don't have eyes everywhere and can't see everything like you guys do since after all we aren't directly in the action.   That's fine and I understand. But I've yet to see a ref ever admit to making a bad call or a series of them in a match. Sometimes just saying, ""Yep, I think you're right and got that one wrong"" during the half time break or end of match leads to more respect than a ""don't even talk to me"" type ref."

It is basic human psychology... If you are in my face and telling me that I am wrong all the time, the odds aren't good that you are going to get a 50/50 call over a team that is treating me with respect and not making the game about me.  That's your call to punish people for people being normal. Plus, you're admitting to purposely calling decisions against someone to get your version of justice.   This is demonstrating a really poor understanding of human psychology and how to get the best out of those refereeing the game. -If you are making the game about what the referee is doing, you are not playing smart football and you are putting yourself in a bad situation.

It might only be a handful of quips.   shit behaviour costing your team   And there we have the immune ref who can't handle any feedback.

I spent 90 minutes on Friday night trying to keep a player I don't particularly like (because he is constantly shooting his mouth off) on the pitch.  I finally succeeded after 10 years of trying.    I am also pretty easy to get along with... You do your job and let me worry about mine...  If you approach me with respect, I am more than happy to chat with you after the game over a beer/whiskey.  I will not, however, have a running fight with you on the pitch about every decision... -It is an easy way to get yourself booked for dissent."

Once the foul is awarded and the ball is kicked, you're back to playing your role.  And your role as judge, jury and executioner makes judgement on my job. I don't get to give you a yellow or red when you make a bad call. You can punish me if you take it personally. If a ref isn't willing to explain or communicate with a captain's query, it doesn't do anyone favours."
Aleague,39sr4f,rodz7,3,Mon Jun 15 10:33:46 2015 UTC,"""There wasn't much in that, mate""   I can live with that... most of the time.  To be really honest, I generally prefer to let the players get on with what they are doing.  I am only going to pull a card if they take away the other options.  I also will not rub it in if you make a bad decision, or mis-kick a ball.  Generally, I don't mind talking to captains most of the time... It gets dicey when they are busy being pricks though."
Aleague,39sr4f,rodz7,0,Mon Jun 15 10:43:08 2015 UTC,But you do make comments if challenges are getting dangerous or you feel a team is time wasting.  Which I believe you should as that information makes the game consistent.
Aleague,39sr4f,RichieMclad,2,Mon Jun 15 11:02:46 2015 UTC,"Generally, by the time that you start complaining about tackles or wasting time, I have already had words or worse with players...  I think that it is all about communication between players and referees. If you do it with respect from both sides, everyone wins."
Aleague,39sr4f,rodz7,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:19:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like there is a difference in standards on how referees are treated between West Sydney and Brissy.   If you think having a shit behaviour is fine and giving the ref shit is fine, I would rethink you're behaviour. The shit that referees get some times is beyond tolerable and like I said in my opening post:   It's how you make a happy confident kid who's having their first fun day as a ref, go hide in the closet and never want to come out because of some fuckwit screaming at them when they are trying to do their best"
Aleague,39sr4f,IncompetentRedditor,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:11:59 2015 UTC,"Same standards.  Making an innocuous comment that isn't rude, doesn't involve swearing or raising my voice isn't 'shit behaviour'. Essentially, you don't want any player saying anything to you. That's how communication and respect breaks down between officials and the rest. Open dialogue is best. Just like a referee may make a comment that certain challenges are getting dangerous. I don't reply to the ref ""shut the fuck up I'm the captain"".   I'm not saying to abuse a kid. But if a kid gets  too emotional because he heard or was asked about a decision then it's best he doesn't ref. I'd rather quality refs over quantity."
Aleague,39sr4f,Brisbanealchemist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:28:35 2015 UTC,"Look. You really don't need to be asking a referee about decisions unless they were really incorrect - if that happens feel free to ask the motive behind it but for 50/50 decisions, you need to understand we aren't always in the right spots to see it. We aren't changing our minds even if you ask."
Aleague,39sr4f,Brisbanealchemist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:39:04 2015 UTC,I'm not asking to change your mind or saying you're wrong. I'm making a comment or asking a question to gauge how you're adjudicating. This is information I can explain to my players by warning them to be more careful in a challenge or not shy away from one.
Aleague,39sr4f,Brisbanealchemist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:44:03 2015 UTC,"Put it this way, learn from your mistakes and if a foul is rewarded to a team, notice what it was for and not do that. Also check them FIFA rules"
Aleague,39sr4f,Brisbanealchemist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:46:18 2015 UTC,"To the players and coaches?   Nah to the government   Then it proves my point that I need to speak up if there is a biased ref who takes personal vendettas rather than doing their job.   I really wouldn't want you when refereeing, you sound like a pain in the ass.  It may be a surprise to you but when neither the AR or ref knows the decision it is literally choose which ever way you feel. Being a cunt to the referee can persuade their decision when they don't know.    That's your call to punish people for people being normal. Plus, you're admitting to purposely calling decisions against someone to get your version of justice.   Using the referee in your banter is completely stupid and if you find that ""normal"", I seriously think you are more of a problem than a player."
Aleague,39sr4f,Brisbanealchemist,0,Mon Jun 15 09:54:03 2015 UTC,"In line with your rant about ""shut the fuck up or I'll give you a red"", you've resorted to sarcasm and going on the offensive than listening to feedback. This is why people struggle to relate to refs and we have a hard time respecting them.  If I'm not swearing/being rude/raising my voice and the ref is taking it personally then it's clear the ref is unfit to do the job they signed up for. You don't have to tolerate abuse but if you're getting this disturbed by innocuous comments then it says more about your ability than me ""being a cunt""."
Aleague,39sr4f,chelsea444,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:13:08 2015 UTC,"My ""Shut the fuck up or I'll give you a red"" is a last case scenario. In many cases on the weekend, it could of got to that stage for some people.   Why are you so defendant on people arguing with the ref. No matter how shit a referee is, don't argue with them. We try our best and sometimes we don't have our greatest games, I've had games where I made a couple of dodgy calls and I know it. I learn from those mistakes but I don't need some player shouting at me because I made a simple mistake.  I shouldn't have to be out there listening to you calling me a loser or a cunt. I had to deal with a coach who was continuously swearing at me and my AR (who was only about 13 ithink ). If you are fine with that.. take your money and fuck off."
Aleague,39sr4f,chelsea444,0,Mon Jun 15 10:28:16 2015 UTC,"You're taking an innocuous comment with telling a ref they are wrong.   I'm defiant on referees and players/coaches having open dialogue. The best refs are the best at receiving feedback and giving an explanation. The worst refs lash out and never improve their understanding of the game.  Never call a ref names. Never tell a ref they made the wrong call. ""He went down too easily"" or ""That's a few nasty challenges. Has he been warned yet?"".   You can stop making up or trying to miscontrue what I'm saying and swearing back. I'm the one with 'shit behaviour' who acts 'like a cunt' yet I've not called any names or sworn in retaliation."
Aleague,39sr4f,SithPire,2,Mon Jun 15 10:53:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is only justified if you are playing at an elite level though. I used to try and get in the ref's head all the time when I was playing at an elite youth level, but now that I just play park soccer on Saturday I get annoyed when people go off at the referee."

Both are basically separate and the only connection between the two is the admins.  The junior side (which I'm associated with) has 4 pitches - only two of which is actually played on. Fields are shit though. The other two pitches which are only used for training are poorly maintained and not good to play on (I've done damage to my ankle on them), the other two which are together have real bad wear and tear from so many teams and games happening on them. At the moment the second one is practically just dirt now.  Not sure how many teams we have but enough to keep the schedule busy as fuck, four fields for training and we only manage to fit it all in."
Aleague,39omqm,phoenix-down,2,Sun Jun 14 08:34:39 2015 UTC,I kinda forget how lucky we are here in Adelaide.

Aleague,39krpn,chochi07,15,Fri Jun 12 12:28:17 2015 UTC,"Being from Denmark and having both my parents from Randers, this makes me happy.  The Danish league is typically split into the top teams and the pack. The top teams are a select few with resources enough to be contenders every year. The pack are all the rest that are always in danger of relegation.  Through their performances, management and coach, they're slowly cementing themselves as a contender rather than one of the many teams fighting year in and year out for survival.  There also shouldn't really be any language barrier as Randers' head coach is British.  Regarding Europa League, I'd be surprised to see them qualify for group stage, but they should be able to win a round or two in qualifiers. Danish teams typically struggle in the final qualifying round where most teams will be unseeded and hence meet tougher opposition."

McDonald was the best poacher Australia's has ever produced, with only Viduka's Celtic and Leeds years coming close to scoring as many goals as Mac did in 2007/2008.   The lad was tearing apart the SPL and scoring key goals in the Champions League and yet dinosaurs like Arnold and Verbeek thought it was appropriate to just give him token appearances off the bench as a lone striker and then having the ball hoofed forward.   We'd kill for a player as good as McDonald was now we actually have a manager with a brain."

Aleague,39ij3r,BrisbaneBhoy,4,Fri Jun 12 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"Australia was far to set in it's ways by the time McDonald came through. The gameplan of Neil, Emerton and Wilkshire constantly hoofing it forward to Kennedy and Cahill was ingrained by Arnold, Verbeek and finally Holger. Players like McDonald had no chance.  We had creative players like Culina, Kewell, Carle and Bresciano who excelled at splitting defences and providing service to feet but we were far to hesitant and even incapable to use them."
Aleague,39ij3r,aninstituteforants,6,Fri Jun 12 10:44:11 2015 UTC,I imagine most of those games were as a sub.
Aleague,39ij3r,malbn,3,Fri Jun 12 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"In the right system, McDonald would have scored a bunch of goals for us. But 'what ifs' are useless.   My fondest memory of him certainly isn't a socceroos memory, but when he half volleyed a screamer late in the game away at castle grey skull. https://youtu.be/iZTiaNik4Yc"
Aleague,39ij3r,PooDiePie,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:52:55 2015 UTC,"He came through at the wrong time.   Everybody wanted everything to be the same as the 'golden generation' (the golden generation that didn't win an Asian cup!).  The more we dwelled on the golden generation the worse off we were. Their time had passed and the players coming through were of a different breed. The coaching staff at this time had conflicting philosophies (or no philosophies).   There was a time when, as Bozza has put it, it was a chore to stay up to the early hours of the morning to watch Australia play."

Him partnering with Luongo at QPR would make for an Australian football fan's dream and he seems to be fairly complimentary of the championship in this article.   All the best to tommy.

Aleague,39di4o,PooDiePie,3,Thu Jun 11 04:55:52 2015 UTC,Mad Max was pretty good.  There were about seven lines of dialogue and the rest was just epic car chases. They managed to pull it off really well though.   It still has a heart even though 90% if the time you were watching tyres spinning and engines combusting.

Aleague,39di4o,JediCapitalist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:41:05 2015 UTC,"As it stands we pay for it collectively through medicare.     You want the blunt truth of my views?    Obese people die early and save the state a fortune on aged care and pensions.    It pays for their medical needs in their 30's and 40's.   If the taxpayer has to foot either bill, it's ultimately academic which bill they foot.  Best we can do is teach good health and we can inform."
Aleague,39di4o,rezplzk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:44:25 2015 UTC,That's actually a really good point I had not entirely considered.  My concern is technology and medicinal improvements saving and prolonging their lives thus further hurting the general populace.  We tax cigarettes.  We tax other drugs too (prescription medicine etc).  Education is definitely the best solution but somewhere discipline is harder than logic to act upon.
Aleague,39di4o,freeriderau,4,Thu Jun 11 01:50:30 2015 UTC,"(prescription medicine etc)   Not prescription meds. If you have a Medicare card most of them are heavily subsidized under the PBS. Read today that $350m of the PBS goes to proton pump inhibitors (Nexium et. al.) which are used for reflux/GORD amongst other things.  Obese people know they're obese and there's a whole host of self-care deficits and poor self-image that can lead them to think this is the best they can do (so they just survive day to day with shit diets and no activity), they're too ashamed to ask for help, and chances are they have at least one chronic condition (muscloskeletal or joint pain is pretty common if you're carrying weight and inactive), so you have this cycle that's difficult to break out of. Not impossible - just very difficult.  Oh, that's on top of feeling good because chemicals released when having a feed, so there's maladaptive behaviours around food as well. No one needs ice, but you sure as fuck need food even if you're dieting, so you can't get away from a potential 'trigger' for overeating or poor dietary choices, then you have your social setting likely enabling big portions and ample high-calorie food everywhere.  Subs like FPH just feed off people's misery and actively want to keep obese people in that downward spiral for their own gratification. It's such a multi faceted health issue - at it's core though it's a mental health problem for my mind. Bridging the mental disconnect and engaging a fat person (who's heard how bad and sad they are a million times a day from a million sources and they've internalised it)... that's a big gap man. Medical improvements... you can stent coronary arteries, do bypasses, administer insulin, gastric banding, resistance training, but you can't fix what's going on in the brainbox without buy-in from a patient.   And there's always lapses when people are trying to change health behaviours. But we often view that as failure against the very twisted narrative of Biggest Loser. And if you don't have to look beyond that TV veil you'd be forgiven for thinking it's easy to lose weight. I know the argument is that personal trainers have got fat to prove it can be done but the key issue is - they looked after themselves before and have the skills to make changes. If you don't have the self-efficacy or previous mastery of these self-care behaviours, and you believe it's outside your control to change, then ultimately that obese person's changes will fail. FPH misses all of this.   I'd like to apologise for the rant but in so many things we seem to rush to the polar ends of the spectrum without considering the evidence base and how we can help - from FPH <-> HAES (my tiny rebuttal: I'm fat and my knees ache all the time, that's not health?), to feminists <-> MRA's, and all down the line, that 'middle space' isn't being represented on the net. I've become fairly fucked off with the discourse generally especially when it drowns out evidence based practices and this is me letting off some steam :P  EDIT: there are people who genuinely lack insight into their health status though. As much as what I've said is accurate, there's equally people who don't know there's a problem - very precontemplation. More evidence that it's a multifactor issue."
Aleague,39di4o,freeriderau,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:36:14 2015 UTC,"Might contribute the point that it's as much a public health issue (in my ever humble opinion haha) as infectious diseases were in the early part of the 20th century.  Many of the contributing factors to the leading causes of mortality are lifestyle related now. Being fat definitely is one of them. Being sedentary is another. (It will be interesting to see how a generation preferring party drugs to booze will go with long term mortality - will they stay the same or be different?)  Also, seperately, what about morbidity and the concept of disability as in quality of life being affected negatively? Can't tell me that obese people are fulfilling all of their potential and seeing all that life has to offer?"
Aleague,39di4o,-Volumes_,2,Thu Jun 11 10:42:44 2015 UTC,I just logged on and went onto /r/all and saw that shit hit the fan. Although I didnt personally agree with some of the things they said or believed in that doesnt mean it should be banned. Lets keep in mind /r/sexyabortions is still a thing.

The fact they're not really saying what the incident was tends to indicate its basically censorship to make the site more appealing to advertisers, like the top comment said."
Aleague,39di4o,JuiceSpringsteen8,2,Thu Jun 11 01:16:20 2015 UTC,"From what I understand from reading the shit storm on the front page, Imgur admins started deleting FPH content a few days ago, so the sub got pissed off and made a picture of the admins on imgur and posted it calling them fatty something or other, getting it to the front page of imgur and /r/all. This caused a bit of a shit storm and I'd say that imgur pulled their weight and forced Reddit to ban the sub (and a few others to make it not look so targeted), and now we have what's going on now."
Aleague,39di4o,CheapTrick32,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:33:24 2015 UTC,That makes the most sense.
Aleague,39di4o,littlejib,2,Thu Jun 11 02:07:37 2015 UTC,"basically censorship   Its not censorship, they are just removing their platform.  The bans were for brigading and harassment, and if you ask around, there are plenty of people that will say that FPH users harassed them which is grounds for a subreddits removal SRS excluded"
Aleague,39di4o,CheapTrick32,2,Thu Jun 11 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"If brigading was bannable SRS should be gone though, I was under the impression they were for harassment which makes more sense but as /u/rezplzk said, why not just ban the individuals that did it?"
Aleague,39di4o,littlejib,6,Thu Jun 11 02:05:32 2015 UTC,"They were, the problem wansn't that the people in the sub were doing it, more that the sub was encouraging it. Then there was that thing with the imgur admins also. They just didnt make friends like srs did"
Aleague,39di4o,CheapTrick32,3,Thu Jun 11 02:09:03 2015 UTC,"So it's basically the clearest indicator that there's one set of rules for srs and another for everyone else, they haven't even done a good job of hiding the double standards."

As in people were having their pictures posted without their knowledge, were then found in real life and began to receive direct harassment through hate messages. Can't confirm whether this is true or not, but if that was true, that would surely be grounds to ban a sub."

Admin comments said something about them getting lots of complaints that people were getting harassed within/outside reddit as a result of FHP. The announcement post has been buried with all the other posts about the bans lately, but they said the reasoning was the resulting harassment not the content itself."
Aleague,39di4o,963479,2,Thu Jun 11 06:41:50 2015 UTC,Its stupid. There are so many worse subs based on stuff like racial hatred that are allowed to exist.
Aleague,39di4o,PooDiePie,2,Thu Jun 11 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"The actual content of the sub isn't what got them banned, it was the sort of stuff members on the sub were doing. Brigading mainly, which can get fucked. That sort of thing can ruin other innocent subs."
Aleague,39di4o,fatholla,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:07:23 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem which caused FHP to be banned was the amount of harassment that was happening as a result of the sub. I heard stories about people doing things like going through social media specifically to find fat people in order to bring attention to them and post their pictures on the sub (obviously without that person's consent or knowledge). This would lead to a whole bunch of name calling and bullying on the sub, with some people going to the extra effort to find the people in real life in order to directly harass them through hate messages and bullying. Whilst it's all fine and well to have subs in which people can share their opinions (regardless of whether I agree with them or not), if innocent people are getting harassed, especially outside of the reddit context, then I would say that the bans were justified."
Aleague,39di4o,rezplzk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:54:14 2015 UTC,Were they directly contacting the people in the pictures and harassing them?  Or were they doing it without their knowledge and got upset once they found the posts?  Not condoning anything just curious as to the dynamics.  Social media and privacy don't mix.
Aleague,39di4o,fatholla,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:04:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm not sure, but somewhere in the announcement post I saw admins saying they were getting lots of people complaining that they were getting harassed as a result of FHP. I can't say that I ever visited FHP personally, but I think it was implied that people were getting harassed outside of reddit   edit: just checked the announcement post again and an admin said some people were getting individually attacked/harrassed within and outside of reddit"

Aleague,3983fa,Zeezer,-1,Wed Jun 10 09:55:25 2015 UTC,"Started a handful of matches this season, same as Milligan was in the j league."
Aleague,39585n,GetUpMorningMVFC,6,Tue Jun 9 10:04:23 2015 UTC,"While I can imagine a few folks in the FFA are going thru paper shredders like no tomorrow and I'd love the idea of the Women's World Cup coming here, can't help but agree with the refusal to bid until FIFA gets their conga line of shit together. IMO, no point pissing money away in lobbying and/or bribes, totally enabling corruption and that ain't cool, man.  Makes me wonder how we would've handled things if we won the 2022 bid and then the corruption mess came into full view like it has now."

Aleague,393uv0,madzaman,18,Tue Jun 9 01:51:25 2015 UTC,This kid seems to have a good head on his shoulders. It's not surprising that the coaches at QPR were so keen to sign him. I hope they are able to help him grow even more as a player.
Aleague,393uv0,StonerJack,11,Tue Jun 9 04:49:21 2015 UTC,Jumping two divisions in quality is also a bit of a step all in one go. I think he has made the smart move. Lots of games in the Championship with a staff that appreciate him really well. Sounds like a good environment.
Aleague,393uv0,cynikles,8,Tue Jun 9 04:54:41 2015 UTC,"I jumped on the QPR subreddit as soon as I heard the signing to ask if he'd be playing in the starting team. Apparently they basically have no midfielders, he'll be starting most games."

Aleague,393uv0,AttackClown,3,Tue Jun 9 13:17:51 2015 UTC,They also signed Ben Gladwin who was one of his midfield partners at Swindon. Will only help with him gelling into the team.

Aleague,394jfi,Shazbah91,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:25:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, i thought he was pretty hard done by to not pick up a basic senior contact. I guess the FFA will leave that up to the incoming coach."
Aleague,394jfi,_SUGARFLAPS_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:38:27 2015 UTC,As long as he stays with the club I'm sure the next coach will see his potential. I thought it was pretty obvious that he's an a-league level player from his debut alone.
Aleague,394jfi,Shazbah91,2,Tue Jun 9 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"Apart from not taking a foreign spot, this isn't really an upgrade on Tanaka. Having said that though, a very Poppa-like signing."

Aleague,391si8,littlejib,3,Mon Jun 8 23:45:42 2015 UTC,Arnold said of his link with Sydney: “My preference when it comes to international marquees is to sign an attacking player not a midfielder.
Aleague,391si8,so_much_wut,2,Mon Jun 8 23:29:30 2015 UTC,To be honest I thought the move sounded odd when I heard it. Arnold's demands on defensive workrate don't really call for aged marquees like Pirlo.
Aleague,391si8,Walkerthon,2,Mon Jun 8 23:09:58 2015 UTC,A creative midfielder like pirlo is the lynch pin behind turning defense into attack.  He could make any forward look good IMO

It's a ""Medium term deal that's commercial in confidence"" but most understand that to mean it expires in 2025 or whenever the AFL take over.   My reading of the Tea Leaves is that once the current contract, the AFL are going to be in no mood to offer such a good deal again and MV will find itself playing out of AAMI Park for the foreseeable future."

Aleague,38zvmm,PooDiePie,2,Mon Jun 8 13:28:59 2015 UTC,I think midfielders are the worst when you try and get them to defend against threatening opposition.   Defenders are more likely to try and hold off at a reasonable distance.

Aleague,38yv3r,murseglen,2,Mon Jun 8 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'd also suspect a better offer. We're still looking at Castelen, Fofanah, Sotirio, Bridge and Santa as players in a front four. Still need a decent striker and someone else wide  (this is with Castelen as a 10)."
Aleague,38yv3r,Zeezer,2,Mon Jun 8 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"I'd say we need a left wing, number 10 and a striker to be competitive next season. Back line and defensive mids is looking alright (we need a right fullback) so long as we aren't as injury stricken as we were in the last campaign."
Aleague,38yv3r,finallyOnReddit,3,Mon Jun 8 02:16:00 2015 UTC,Bring back Dino?
Aleague,38yv3r,murseglen,2,Mon Jun 8 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I am aware, Fofanah and Sotirio are both relatively flexible, so another winger of whatever side is good. Another striker  (Mclaren?) also. D'Cunha was okay in his one game so I expect him and Cole to switch."

We're ""streamlining football operations"", but Mike Mulvey was sacked because he didn't use certain staff in line with the filosofy? Aloisi chucked out Rado. Shane Stefanutto was re-signed before Aloisi was appointed and didn't get to make that decision. Nothing is consistent. Judas Ken ""football guardian"" Stead resigned? Was sacked? What? Chris Fong stepping down as CEO..... into a cushy board position... It's all bullshit.   And Frans ""subs are for actual coaches"" Thijsen? Shut the fuck up.

Although this year, im hoping a few more international stars make it to the team.  Its would kind of be ironic though...cause our champion last year was LA, and the A league champion was the Victory. Didnt the Victory play the Galaxy recently?"
Aleague,38mz4g,kiac,5,Fri Jun 5 16:40:15 2015 UTC,Sydney have played la twice. Once here. Once in Hawaii. They could do a good pacific event in Hawaii

Aleague,38mz4g,agsports,3,Fri Jun 5 07:04:57 2015 UTC,"Didn't LA Galaxy tour a few years ago with Beckham? I know they played Sydney and Wellington, not sure if they were in different years though."

So unless a team with some real big names was coming here I don't think it would be worth the trip. Can't see why A-League teams would bother going to North America either tbh, the All-Stars might go if the FFA wants to build closer ties with the US though."

There's really no questioning that the EPL sides that have come down are better than the A-League sides that they played. Even though many would argue that the MLS team would be better, I reckon a match between an MLS and an A-League side would force both teams to play competitively because it is nowhere near as clear cut as the difference between the EPL and the A-League."
Aleague,38mz4g,madzaman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:06:14 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think it'd be a waste of time for A-League teams. It's one thing to bring in the big names like Chelsea etc to spread the game and all that, but if you wanted close, even games to try and test the teams in preseason there's no need to go to the US to do that (and again if we're bringing teams here, they might as well be teams people actually care about)."

Aleague,38le47,JediCapitalist,2,Thu Jun 4 23:46:50 2015 UTC,He's nothing special.  He can play a decent pass and has a reasonable set shot but as a youngster failed to take off at Melbourne City (then Melbourne Heart) and had glimpses of greatness at the Wanderers but ultimately he's not there any more either.
Aleague,38le47,alvinng,5,Thu Jun 4 23:55:11 2015 UTC,He's got a good eye for passes and can be quite composed on the ball. But he's also got this lazy Berbatov style to his play which doesn't work well in fast counter attacking play. I once heard someone compare his style to Zidane and I almost laughed my ass off.

Weird too seeing United have enough problems as it is and in the 25 years that I've been a United fan, I don't recall them ever paying to takeover a club.   Yes they probably have affiliated clubs like Royal Antwerp but they're more like feeder clubs that young players go on loan to to get game time.   And Victory looks like they don't need the cash injection, fans are fiercely loyal to their Australian roots so even if United was interested, would Victory be interested?  The Man City takeover of Heart makes sense because we need the cash to even remotely be able to get close to Victory's level and attract good players.  It's weird enough as it is being a Man United and Melbourne City fan, if United really takes over Victory, that would take it to a new level of awkward for me."

Aleague,38io5o,Nos_4r2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:06:33 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  Theoretically if it were true how would this affect the supporters and club? If they were to go down the path of Melbourne City and change the name and badge do you think some supporters would become disillusioned? What's the reaction been on Facebook as well?

Aleague,38g6of,Row86,15,Thu Jun 4 00:18:09 2015 UTC,MV have signed him for their elite flight program.  With all the champions League travelling they need expert plane larrikin to make those trips much smoother.
Aleague,38g6of,rezplzk,2,Thu Jun 4 00:26:46 2015 UTC,Liam Reddy would've made it interesting
Aleague,38g6of,OfficialJKV,2,Thu Jun 4 05:37:31 2015 UTC,what is this referencing?
Aleague,38g6of,itisknown__,10,Thu Jun 4 07:03:41 2015 UTC,Victory are going from strength to strength. Going to be very hard to beat next season and can see them doing the double again. It just seems like no other team can match their squad within the salary cap.
Aleague,38g6of,Mello-D,37,Thu Jun 4 00:28:13 2015 UTC,within the salary cap   :)
Aleague,38g6of,rezplzk,6,Thu Jun 4 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"I think we've had some of the best recruitment in the league this past 1-2 years. Still waiting to hear on Archie and Georgievski, but otherwise we have held the majority of the squad together."
Aleague,38g6of,Mello-D,4,Thu Jun 4 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you manage to keep those two  I would expect some kind of investigation into your books."
Aleague,38g6of,Mello-D,12,Thu Jun 4 02:25:32 2015 UTC,Got a feeling that's going to be the 'Go To' allegation for supporters of most other clubs every time Victory beats them and/or if we go back to back.
Aleague,38g6of,Mello-D,7,Thu Jun 4 02:40:44 2015 UTC,I don't think it's about MV winning or going back to back. I think it's about the insane squad you have assembled. If Newcastle had your squad I would say the same about them.
Aleague,38g6of,littlejib,6,Thu Jun 4 04:46:11 2015 UTC,"We have lost/let go 4 players including Adrian Leijer. We have signed 1. No idea on what any of them earn, but perhaps it all evens out?  It's just a bit lazy to start throwing around the 'salary cap' line. If I was a supporter of another A-League club I'd be asking why my club couldn't recruit as strongly as MV. And in all honesty, do you think just after the Perth saga that any club would dare go over the salary cap?"
Aleague,38g6of,madzaman,2,Thu Jun 4 04:50:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's happening, but things would look suss if you held onto Archie and Georgievski. I know our recruitment has been shocking, but when Chris Fong is running the show there is only so much frustration one can take. Our recruitment will be pretty lousy for the next season or two anyways due to the contracts certain players were signed to."
Aleague,38g6of,nerv2004,2,Thu Jun 4 05:40:42 2015 UTC,"If we keep Archie, it will only be due to the impending CBA changes that allow provisions for veteran club players. Brox might fall under this too. If the changes go through, we could save a lot of money on Arch and Brox's contracts."
Aleague,38g6of,madzaman,0,Thu Jun 4 05:43:42 2015 UTC,Took most of the year to find out glory
Aleague,38g6of,nerv2004,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:45:45 2015 UTC,What are our current option at LB with georgie gone??  Ansell?
Aleague,38g6of,madzaman,2,Thu Jun 4 00:53:18 2015 UTC,"Galloway - think it's time he was given his shot. I have both faith in Him and Geria and LB and RB. But in saying that, I don't think Georgie is gone just yet."
Aleague,38g6of,nerv2004,2,Thu Jun 4 00:57:09 2015 UTC,I think we'd have to sign another LB if we let Georgievski go regardless. whether that's an XI or sub remains to be seen.
Aleague,38g6of,littlejib,3,Thu Jun 4 01:02:40 2015 UTC,Would be very hard to find a starting 11 under the cap better than Galloway. IMO
Aleague,38g6of,AvocadoCake,3,Thu Jun 4 01:17:36 2015 UTC,"and yet Georgievski was ;)  In all honestly, next season should be Galloways big break. hes at the right age to break though now and if he looks good in pre-season i don't see why money couldn't be better spent in other positions and just promote a youth player/sign a promising youngster."
Aleague,38g6of,madzaman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"Georgie was able to fit this season due to himself and fbk being signed cheap as they're unproven.  Both now proven and want/deserve more money.  I totally agree on gallows getting a chance, I'm very curious who plays at LB in the youth team.  Wouldn't be surprised if brox could also cover there."
Aleague,38g6of,conrad15,2,Thu Jun 4 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be surprised if brox could also cover there.   Neither but thats the thing about brox. He can cover for lots of positions but he isn't signed to cover a single one. What i mean is ""hypothetically"" if you want 2 LB in your squad you want a XI, a sub. brox can cover multiples i wouldn't sign him as the sub because at any point he could have to cover another area, leaving you with only 1 natural LB."
Aleague,38g6of,kiac,5,Thu Jun 4 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"23 player squad, 2 players for every position + 1 Brox"
Aleague,38g6of,vendilion,2,Thu Jun 4 01:55:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know too much about how long Gallo/Geria will be away on national team duty in the coming season, but I think Murnane can do a decent job as injury backup/rotation."
Aleague,38g6of,Mello-D,2,Thu Jun 4 03:46:11 2015 UTC,Yep he stepped up on numerous occasions last season and did quite well I thought.
Aleague,38g6of,vendilion,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:57:38 2015 UTC,I'd love for him to stay.... Just can't see it happening $$$ wise.
Aleague,38g6of,Mello-D,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"Galloway was stiff to lose his spot late in the season, so he will step up.  Murnane as backup, and Broxham can if needed."

Aleague,38g6of,Wetnapkin69,2,Thu Jun 4 04:44:40 2015 UTC,Please read my comment and observe the lack of any salary cap breach mention. I'm just saying that other clubs haven't been able to do what MV have been able to do with the salary cap. Tin foil hats at the door plz.
Aleague,38g6of,Wetnapkin69,-2,Thu Jun 4 05:42:08 2015 UTC,So what makes us special then? We obviously have a knack for fitting all kinds of quality under the cap.
Aleague,38g6of,ac1997,2,Thu Jun 4 05:48:32 2015 UTC,If I knew the answer to that I'd be coaching an Aleague team.
Aleague,38g6of,rodz7,9,Thu Jun 4 05:55:05 2015 UTC,"Good keeper yes, but personally I would have liked to see Thomas get the gig.  If I were him I might be looking elsewhere."
Aleague,38g6of,itisknown__,6,Thu Jun 4 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I would be looking elsewhere to. He's done his time as the backup and deserves a shot somewhere, I just don't think Victory is the right place for that shot.  A lot of people are getting caught up in the emotion of the GF win and how well Thomas did in the final two games. Taking away that performance though, its really hard for me to point out other times where he has really been a standout."
Aleague,38g6of,rodz7,3,Thu Jun 4 00:47:19 2015 UTC,he hasn't been given to many shots TBF. When coe was out of form early in the season/ late last season (i forget when it was) he came in and did ok. I think hes certainly HAL standard just needs a chance to prove it. Maybe Perth considering they have zero keepers currently?
Aleague,38g6of,JessePapa,2,Thu Jun 4 01:04:55 2015 UTC,"Taking away that performance though, its really hard for me to point out other times where he has really been a standout.   Probably because he didn't play before that."
Aleague,38g6of,notbilbo,2,Thu Jun 4 12:30:17 2015 UTC,He played numerous games in 2013/2014 when Muscat dropped Coe.
Aleague,38g6of,nerv2004,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:34:33 2015 UTC,"According to wiki he played 5 games last season, hardly enough to show himself."
Aleague,38g6of,nerv2004,2,Fri Jun 5 07:54:16 2015 UTC,This is harsh on Turnbull. He really showed up whenever called upon.  #JusticeForTurnbull
Aleague,38g6of,jp23,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:09:59 2015 UTC,"Haha so true. All jokes aside though, wouldn't be surprised if he sticks around as number 2? Although I keep seeing stuff about him and WSW - anyone else seen it?"
Aleague,38g6of,rodz7,3,Thu Jun 4 10:07:06 2015 UTC,"I'm really happy with this signing, one of the best keepers in the league."
Aleague,38g6of,jp23,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:22:17 2015 UTC,I don't see Vukovic being cheap. Hint that Milligan might be moving on and freeing up the marquee spot that eases pressure on the cap?
Aleague,38g6of,rodz7,3,Thu Jun 4 01:13:12 2015 UTC,Coe was on reportedly 200-300 a year so I'd say that is where the space in the cap is coming from.
Aleague,38g6of,localfisherman,2,Thu Jun 4 04:25:53 2015 UTC,Yep - Coe was on some pretty decent coin. Couldn't see Vukovic being on anymore. All evens out.
Aleague,38g6of,vendilion,2,Thu Jun 4 04:56:34 2015 UTC,Vuka is fringe Socceroo and has been for quite a while. That's extremely cheap for someone of his calibre.
Aleague,38g6of,Nathaaan,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"Coe was a capped Socceroos player coming from Europe when he signed for us, so surely Vuka would be on considerably less?"
Aleague,38g6of,aninstituteforants,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:32:14 2015 UTC,"Not sure on the exact rules, but is it not possible for MV to offer Vuka crazy money as part of his ACL commitments, to make up for a smaller HAL contract?"
Aleague,38fes0,fidrildid6,20,Wed Jun 3 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"Saw this signing coming, but it will be hard to see him playing for another A-League club. What a fucking shitty move it was to go to Russia."
Aleague,38fes0,Mello-D,9,Wed Jun 3 21:51:23 2015 UTC,He still got selected for Socceroos and didn't fall off the face of the earth. Good to see him back regardless whether he is in orange or not. Good pick up by City!
Aleague,38fes0,Rupro_,19,Wed Jun 3 22:49:57 2015 UTC,Not a bad back up for the Hoff!
Aleague,38fes0,thisphantomfortress,6,Wed Jun 3 21:38:33 2015 UTC,No offence to Clisby but finally the club signs a quality full back. Couldn't be happier!
Aleague,38fes0,alvinng,2,Wed Jun 3 21:26:40 2015 UTC,"Clisby is more of a CB that has been played at LB several times. But yeah, not on Franjic's level."
Aleague,38fes0,ODABBOTT,15,Thu Jun 4 13:07:21 2015 UTC,Always knew he'd be in Melbourne if ever came back. Definitely a player I will always clap regardless of who he plays for.   At least he didn't join the Victory.
Aleague,38fes0,All_Time_Low,3,Wed Jun 3 22:47:34 2015 UTC,:(
Aleague,38fes0,hyp-R,2,Wed Jun 3 23:59:24 2015 UTC,Surely you've had enough of our players and staff already.
Aleague,38fes0,All_Time_Low,3,Thu Jun 4 00:22:46 2015 UTC,"It's a small league, it's hard for loyalties to stand the test of time especially with things like the Salary Cap.  I understand as 5 years for me, in the A-League, I'd consider 'long term' - but anything less and it's fair game. I really didn't mean any disrespect, he's a great player and its a really good signing for City/Heart - but unless he's someone like Thompson I can't understand people getting upset.  Edit: I will add, though, that considering Roar was his first A-League club and almost the start of his real career I could understand certain sentiment there. Just know that I'm not a dick intentionally :)"
Aleague,38fes0,hyp-R,3,Thu Jun 4 02:44:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, trust me I agree with you. It's for exactly the reason you said: We started his career, and arguably is now a socceroos from how he developed under us. And as such, he repayed us with 3 championships and two titles. But, when he moved on, I think we all knew he wasn't coming back. We were just glad he went overseas instead of down south then...  My comment is more just directed at the fact that if anyone move's on from Brisbane, it just ALWAYS seems to be to Victory."
Aleague,38fes0,All_Time_Low,3,Thu Jun 4 02:57:37 2015 UTC,I honestly liked Brisbane when I went there!
Aleague,38fes0,hyp-R,5,Thu Jun 4 03:01:27 2015 UTC,Fantastic signing and will help us immensely.  Reeeal depth is on the way!
Aleague,38fes0,JediCapitalist,6,Wed Jun 3 23:05:21 2015 UTC,The migration of Brisbane players to Melbourne is so very fucking annoying. He is a Vic boy though so can't begrudge a homecoming. At least we have Polenz.
Aleague,38fes0,falisimoses,4,Wed Jun 3 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"Ya gotta admit though, Melbourne is a much better package overall than Brisbane. I mean who wants to play home games and train in 33 degrees 90% humidity. Give me 40 and 20% humidity any day of the week. Oooo."
Aleague,38fes0,hotwatershanus,9,Wed Jun 3 23:33:04 2015 UTC,If only we played in winter. I'm certain half of Melbourne would give up their first born for our extremely comfortable consistent 20's.

Aleague,38fes0,drop_bars_not_bombs,3,Wed Jun 3 22:49:49 2015 UTC,"He's still the socceroos best right back, currently. He needs to be playing and Russia clearly wasn't anything positive. Good luck to him."
Aleague,38fes0,murseglen,3,Wed Jun 3 22:50:29 2015 UTC,Watch us make him play CM with Mooy.
Aleague,38fes0,iheartOPsmum,2,Thu Jun 4 01:32:11 2015 UTC,Great pick up for the type of football that City like to play and great that he can get some match fitness again.
Aleague,38fes0,Walkerthon,2,Wed Jun 3 22:15:36 2015 UTC,Clubs worst kept secret. I know most of us hoped he might come mid season but a clean start is probably for the best.
Aleague,38fes0,Synth88,2,Wed Jun 3 23:31:53 2015 UTC,Jeez that's a massive signing. Great bit of business by City. Definitely a twinge of jealousy haha
Aleague,38fes0,StonerJack,2,Wed Jun 3 23:42:42 2015 UTC,Oh sick mad
Aleague,38fes0,sexshepard91,2,Thu Jun 4 05:27:14 2015 UTC,"Good for him, but that's going to be a massive amount of cap spent on a fullback. Not really worth it."
Aleague,38fes0,sick_yilmaz,2,Thu Jun 4 06:35:26 2015 UTC,We didn't have a single natural fullback in the squad before this so i know what you're saying but i really can't be mad.
Aleague,38fes0,sick_yilmaz,2,Thu Jun 4 06:41:00 2015 UTC,It'd definitely not a terrible signing or anything.
Aleague,38fes0,Row86,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:01:48 2015 UTC,Pretty solid signing for Heart - he'll give them some real strength in that area.

Aleague,38fes0,conrad15,-2,Thu Jun 4 11:53:31 2015 UTC,"Great signing, but you gotta question whether he was really needed, especially for the money they would have forked out for him.  I know RB is an area of concern for City (Hoffman), but there are probably cheaper options. Also, it wasnt their weakest area, maybe investing in a GK, CB and decent wingers would have been a higher priority?"

Aleague,38g402,falisimoses,5,Thu Jun 4 00:01:43 2015 UTC,Headline was different on the website but anyway...  I hope we make the most of Clut because I don't think he's going to be hanging around much longer. I think he's dynamite and I really enjoyed it when he got on the pitch last season.
Aleague,38g402,cynikles,3,Thu Jun 4 00:03:19 2015 UTC,"I hope he's smart enough to stick around and at least get a full season under his belt. He was used pretty sparingly last year, albeit more than the previous year, but still needs a bit more experience. Once he solidifies himself in our midfield and shows this kind of skill week in, week out, I think he'd be ready to go overseas.   Then again, whatever. I just want to enjoy him for a bit longer."
Aleague,38g402,JuiceSpringsteen8,2,Thu Jun 4 00:36:36 2015 UTC,I'd love to see him stick around for a whole season in the first team before taking off immediately after emerging like Kwame Yeboah did. If he gets a decent A-League campaign in he can maybe look at making a similar move to Ibini next year or the year after. He's definitely got the talent there.

Doesn't get brought up that often in travel guides but that area is dangerous as fuck and is very easy to walk into without even knowing. But you will eventually realise something is amiss when literally everyone you see is homeless, no shit you will see more homeless people in the Tenderloin then anywhere else in the US. That place is fucked in what is otherwise a really awesome city.   If you get a chance head to teh Castro, go to a place called 'Ikes Place' and ask for a James Dean on sourdough...you wont be dissappointed.

Most players who go on the field at least care 75% even if the game doesn't mean anything. Villareal literally couldn't care less if they copped an absolute flogging. That's something that would hurt the pride of any decent footballer.
Aleague,38cgs0,Ronnie_Recluse,2,Wed Jun 3 12:14:36 2015 UTC,"There's a reason /u/failsimoses tore the Roar a new one when they were woeful at at a ""I don't give a flying fuck"" level. From what I saw after a soccer training session I had, seemed like Villareal weren't switched on like they did against Adelaide and Clut, Solorzano & Broich had a field day tonight.  Even if it is a friendly, it makes me hopeful of a respectable result vs Liverpool. Shame Stevie G is now a LA Galaxy player by then."

China was never the place for him to continue his career and he was at the point where a move to a place like Belgium would be the right move for him, especially since he seemed to be one of the better A-League players last season."
Aleague,38b7wx,EnglishHooligan,4,Wed Jun 3 02:39:15 2015 UTC,Too good for the ALeague. Hopefully flourishes in his development in a smaller European league and use it as a stepping stone up to the bigger leagues.

Aleague,38b7wx,fnurtfnurt,3,Wed Jun 3 03:26:20 2015 UTC,Nooooooo!  Well good luck to him. He's for a bright future.
Aleague,38b7wx,AttackClown,6,Wed Jun 3 03:43:36 2015 UTC,Hope he gets the move done and proves me wrong because personally i think he is a bit too inconsistent especially when he has no room to run into. Not the greatest technique and can give the ball away pretty cheaply.
Aleague,38b7wx,Walkerthon,4,Wed Jun 3 06:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he has the raw talent and hopefully his new club can help him develop technically"
Aleague,38b7wx,cynikles,2,Wed Jun 3 06:30:00 2015 UTC,"I have my doubts. Ibini is like a few other players we've seen who have had good physical attributes but have really failed to develop technically. Bruce Djite is another that springs to mind who is very physically imposing by not much of a goalscorer even though he is meant to be a striker.   Other would be maybe Halloran. Speed and dribbling but pretty one-dimensional. I'll give him more time though as I feel he has a little more about him.   There are others that aren't coming to mind but I think at this age, Ibini would be better off playing in the A-League. He'll be coming home as soon as his contract's up. Guarantee it."
Aleague,38b7wx,effsee,7,Wed Jun 3 06:51:31 2015 UTC,"Ibini is a physical freak on a whole other level, though. Pace merchants are a dime a dozen, but what people miss is that Ibini does it with the build of a centre-back. The guy's 187cm, 88kg, In terms of speed, size, strength, he is right up there with as good as it gets in football at any level.  And the thing is, when you look through his highlight reel, it's not like he's relying on his physical attributes to get by at all. He's not scoring goals because he's getting played in behind defences that are too high and square, he isn't getting past defenders by knocking the ball past them and just burning them for pace.   He's scoring some fantastic strikes from outside the box, and he's taking sometimes two or three guys on the dribble and getting through them with the ball at his feet.  Messi he is not, but neither is he ""failed to develop technically"". I actually don't think it's his technique that's the 'problem', but his decision-making.   When he's acting on instinct his technique is actually quite good - strikes the ball really well, his close-control and even touch-passing (considering it's not exactly his forte as a winger) are solid. It's when he's given time - when a defender stays in front of him but lets him run rather than diving in, or when he has two or three touches without an immediate option - that he sometimes gets caught in two minds and makes the wrong decision.  But he's young, and that's something he can absolutely improve on.   I didn't really rate him that highly when he came in (but then I didn't realise how young he was at CCM either), but watching him play every week for this season has absolutely sold me. As long as he can actually settle in somewhere, he'll make it in Europe. I don't have any expectations of him scaling any particularly great heights, but I can see him at a mid-to-lower EPL side in three or four years."
Aleague,38b7wx,SuperSleekit,2,Wed Jun 3 09:39:17 2015 UTC,"Bummer for Sydney FC and the fans, but a great move for Bernie.  He's really stepped up his game to another level this year so hopefully for him and the Socceroos this move can lift him again.  Good luck Bernie, it's been a pleasure to watch you this season."
Aleague,38b7wx,SerTahu,2,Wed Jun 3 05:06:35 2015 UTC,"If he keeps playing like he has been against tougher competition then surely he could start making a push for a place in the Socceroos squad. As much as I'll miss him, it's definitely a good career move."

Aleague,38bi7o,onloan94,8,Wed Jun 3 07:05:37 2015 UTC,"The constant comparisons between football and rugby league, made usually by football fans, drive me insane. Channel Nine paid over a billion for TV rights while the A-league got a fraction of that on SBS and Fox. You can't compare crowd attendances also when you have 2 teams in Sydney compared to 9 NRL teams. There is still a long way to go before football is on par with rugby league. This Chelsea game was simply an attraction. The British and Irish Lions managed to sell out their games in Aus in 15 minutes. Does that mean that union is a threat to league? Gimme a break. I love watching football but it's popularity in this country does not affect my enjoyment of it, or the enjoyment of other sports, at all. #rantover"
Aleague,38bi7o,LarryLawyer,3,Wed Jun 3 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Rugby League has much more of an opportunity to sell advertising space and is much more attractive to sponsors.  Eg. Markings on the field, many more breaks in play, KFC video replays etc."
Aleague,38bi7o,onloan94,2,Wed Jun 3 05:25:30 2015 UTC,"True, definitely a factor. The size of the audience for league though is still bigger.

You could also argue that Chile v Australia at 8am on a Saturday morning in a tournament hosted every 4 years should be doing significant numbers if football is as popular as Graham Arnold makes it out to be. But yeah those highly rated league games are in key timeslots.

Aleague,387lmj,Row86,4,Tue Jun 2 13:28:11 2015 UTC,Yep spot on. They have kept the sport alive in this country and I'd hazard a guess that they have actually lost a lot of money with their coverage over the years.
Aleague,387lmj,JGQuintel,6,Tue Jun 2 22:19:24 2015 UTC,"They also listed Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the starting lineup, but didn't mention their mistake. Not even when Loftus-Cheek was subbed onto the pitch later in the match.   Craig Moore is a terrible commentator/pundit too which didn't make things much better. Great guy and all, but no good at TV.   I know everyone hates Murdoch/Foxtel but shelling out $12.50/week for HD sport coverage and getting every football match I could ask for live, along with a mix of funny/informative/entertaining football related shows, has been one of the best decisions I ever made. You can't buy a bloody maccas meal for that these days. No idea why I waited so long."

Aleague,387lmj,-Volumes_,13,Wed Jun 3 02:33:22 2015 UTC,I didnt watch tonights game and only watched ~15mins of the Spurs v Sydney game but Channel 7 are a joke. Thier AFL coverage (something they put 'time' into) is an absolute farce. I mean they couldnt even put the GRAND FINAL on in HD!!! What hope do we have of them providing an even half decent broadcast if they cant even get that right.  Channel 9's cricket isnt that bad (yeh the commentators are shit but the coverage is actually decent.) But the Origin the other night was so painful to watch. Adverts left right and center. Just awful.  Do Channel 10 even have any money left?  As much as people h8 foxtel cause 'Murdoch ruined the world' their sports coverage in this country is second to none. I'd love SBS or ABC to get the A-League but lets be honest that wont happen.
Aleague,387lmj,Floodman11,15,Tue Jun 2 13:09:34 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love SBS's coverage - as much as some people aren't a fan of Craig Foster overanalysing every moment of every game, I love how he can break the game down like that, so the average person views the game for the tactical spectical that it is, rather than a game of cat and mouse that Channel 7 create..."

Aleague,387lmj,IvanEedle,2,Wed Jun 3 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"Totally respect SBS's commitment to the game but their A-League coverage is often quite bland. I'm in two minds about them.

Aleague,387lmj,jp23,2,Tue Jun 2 12:53:10 2015 UTC,Hopefully any FTA deal would still have every game live on Fox. They do it with the AFL so I don't see why they wouldn't do it for the A-League as well.
Aleague,387lmj,red-john,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:40:24 2015 UTC,Of course it will. Fox fund the league and FTA networks won't be able to make the same contribution.

Should the be expected to maintain a football infrastructure when they only on show a couple of games a year, that can't be cost effective. If they got the rights to the A-League they would invest more into it with decent commentators and pundits (one would hope...) because  it would be more cost effective. That said they obviously could have put a bit more effort in and showed a little more respect."

Not to mention they only know how to cover AFL, so they just use the same model of 'blokey banter', radio style ads integrated into commentary, all in buttery smooth 570i.  Not to mention the internet took the viewers that gave a fuck about decent coverage and sought better alternatives, leaving the common denominator spuds to accept their trash.

Aleague,3876eg,TomEmilioDavies,22,Tue Jun 2 12:04:17 2015 UTC,I'll never understand why people choose to support a team from the other side of the world over one from their city
Aleague,3876eg,ac1997,31,Tue Jun 2 10:43:44 2015 UTC,because people have been supporting them since before the A League existed?

Aleague,3876eg,wannachupbrew,3,Tue Jun 2 12:20:40 2015 UTC,There is no way everyone in that stadium went for Chelsea before the A-League existed. Probably not even half of them.
Aleague,3876eg,aninstituteforants,15,Wed Jun 3 02:46:57 2015 UTC,Because most people simply find the EPL a much more entertaining league to watch than the A-League. I like watching both but I'll be darned if I said the A-League was as exciting and skillful as the EPL.
Aleague,3876eg,mulimulix,6,Tue Jun 2 10:50:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you're right. Most people want to be entertained pure and simple.  Not that we don't but we are invested a lot more because of the draw of it being our own team too"
Aleague,3876eg,MagnanimousGenius,2,Tue Jun 2 11:53:30 2015 UTC,"Exciting yes, skilful no.  The emotional connection to a local team makes the excitement different to any other feeling"
Aleague,3876eg,ac1997,10,Tue Jun 2 12:01:43 2015 UTC,Mate it was pretty embarrassing. Not to mention I was in Category A and half the people around me decked head to toe in Chelsea gear booed Sydney. They also left with 10 minutes to go so they could beat traffic.
Aleague,3876eg,aninstituteforants,9,Tue Jun 2 12:10:03 2015 UTC,My God. Eurosnob full kit wankers chewing on their prawn sandwiches. Eww.
Aleague,3876eg,ac1997,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:14:10 2015 UTC,I was wearing my 1998 Chelsea jersey and someone asked me if I bought it from the merchandise stand. Still booed Sydney though too which was great banter
Aleague,3876eg,Kamone1202,8,Wed Jun 3 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"Call me when Launceston gets a club in the A-League and I'll follow them more closely than Liverpool.  I'd been following Liverpool for more than a decade by the time I moved to Melbourne. Did you expect me to abandon that and follow a Melbourne team just because I happened to move there?  The A-League is still very young. While there will always be supporters who prefer foreign leagues, the A-League will be looking to grow their supporter base relative to foreign leagues over the next few generations.  You can't expect supporters to forget their foreign clubs and support A-League ones. Some will, others will support both, but the aim must be to get kids growing up supporting an A-League team instead of a foreign one."
Aleague,3876eg,Sioreth,2,Tue Jun 2 11:49:33 2015 UTC,Do you follow the state league at all?
Aleague,3876eg,MagnanimousGenius,3,Tue Jun 2 11:58:09 2015 UTC,"Where? In Tassie? No. I played for several clubs at that level. Would be weird being a 'supporter' of them. Even if I wanted to, I have no access to them, other than reading the results.  In Melbourne, I went to a few Victory games, but could never manage to care. Considered going to a Northcote match, but never got round to it.  In Canberra, I've been to a few W-League matches and enjoyed it. You could probably say I'm a Canberra Utd supporter. I do actually care somewhat about them winning, but I'm only a casual supporter at best. I maybe catch about 1-2 games per year. Haven't checked out the men's state league. Know nothing about it.  If Canberra got an A-League team, I would probably go to their matches. Can't say how seriously I would end up supporting them.  I just wanted to point out that there can be reasons why someone might not particularly care about a team from their city. I think the idea of supporting your local club has merit, but is often bleated blindly and used as a criticism against those who don't."
Aleague,3876eg,Sioreth,13,Tue Jun 2 12:11:56 2015 UTC,"My brother's reason is ""A-League is shit, European football is actually fun to watch"".  I give him so much shit when Liverpool lose. This season was fun."

These days it's also pretty easy to follow European football in Australia so it's entirely possible that some people there are fans of both teams but just wanted to cheer for the team which is here for a limited time as opposed to always available."
Aleague,3876eg,fatholla,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:55:59 2015 UTC,IMO there 'shouldn't' be more Chelsea fans than Sydney fans at a game in Sydney
Aleague,3876eg,ac1997,9,Tue Jun 2 10:59:58 2015 UTC,"Why not? It's the first time in 40 years that Chelsea have toured Australia. There will be Chelsea fans from all over Australia there, even fans who traveled from outside Australia.  Of course there's going to be more Chelsea fans at the match. It's a special occasion for them. For Sydney fans, it's an expensive meaningless match (albeit against a cool opponent) which they can afford to miss because they can go to watch Sydney FC play any time. Chelsea fans might have to wait another 40 years."
Aleague,3876eg,Sioreth,6,Tue Jun 2 11:32:03 2015 UTC,"10 year member, haven't missed a competitive game in Sydney in 6 (?) years, go to most preseason games, interstate trips most years.   I had no interest in either of these - haven't even watched on TV.   On the other hand, if I were a ""Chelsea fan"" (I.E. I like the odd post on Facebook, banter with my ""Man U fan"" friends, watch bigger games if they're early kick-off, maybe make an effort for a CL semi or an FA Cup Final if Chelsea make it) this would be the opportunity of a lifetime."
Aleague,3876eg,effsee,6,Tue Jun 2 11:29:43 2015 UTC,"Are you serious lol. Any big team that comes down will have more fans than the home team.

Aleague,3876eg,ac1997,3,Tue Jun 2 11:23:35 2015 UTC,I had a friend from Greece come to the match. He was shocked people would support a foreign team over s home team

Aleague,385hrz,Nelfoos5,3,Tue Jun 2 00:28:07 2015 UTC,"We will now work hard with Oceania Football and FIFA as we continue to build closer ties with Asia   This could mean several things, almost all of them good. My guess is that they want to combine WC qualifying with AFC."
Aleague,385hrz,SerTahu,2,Tue Jun 2 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"If OFC combines with Asia, FIFA should give Asia another automatic qualification spot. That would be very attractive for Asia IMO"
Aleague,385hrz,notbilbo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:28:09 2015 UTC,"I think it won't be quite so drastic, but more just the top few teams of OFC entering the qualifying stages of the AFC for the WC."
Aleague,385hrz,notbilbo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:35:42 2015 UTC,Why would Asia go for it?
Aleague,385hrz,SerTahu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:42:06 2015 UTC,"Well I think, in such a scenario, the Ocenia 0.5 spot would obviously be merged with AFC's 4.5 for 5 direct qualification spots. It would be equivalent of the guaranteeing that AFC and OFC are always paired in intercontinental playoffs, which would be more attractive to Asia than the possibility of facing a South American country."
Aleague,385hrz,notbilbo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:49:39 2015 UTC,"Apologies, that was what I meant when I said FIFA would give Asia another spot. Combining OFC and AFCs 0.5."
Aleague,385hrz,Yella_King,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:00:21 2015 UTC,Seeing as the OFC is essentially a one team region it would be a good idea if the top 2 OFC teams where to qualify to be put into Asian qualifiers.  Or you could just fully merge the regions.
Aleague,385hrz,MosesIAmnt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:32:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think we should get rid of OFC and split Asia into two federations. East Asia and West Asia or something similar.   Really how are Middle Eastern countries in the same area as South East Asian countries?"
Aleague,385hrz,SerTahu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:39:40 2015 UTC,"The best case scenario, in my opinion, would be an Asia-Pacific federation (basically the AFC nations from India eastward, plus the OFC), a Middle East + Saharan Africa federation, and Sub-Saharan Africa as one federation.  That being said, anything beyond an AFC-OFC merger is probably unrealistic due to the corruption within FIFA and the federations, and the fear of the people in charge losing their power."

Aleague,385b6w,effsee,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you guys did to him, but every time he's had an extended stretch at CB here (that's going back to 2010) he's been solid - obviously nothing like Colosimo/Thwaite/Ognenovski/Delpierre/Spiranovic-good, but comfortably good enough for this level.  Local kid who played NYL for us, is constantly improving but is unlikely to make a step up to a higher level overseas, and has a solid 8 years left in the tank - yeah, pretty happy to keep him on."
Aleague,385a8e,madzaman,6,Mon Jun 1 23:21:19 2015 UTC,What is the point of Juve owning his contract if they never plan on playing him? Italian contracts and ownership confuse me a bit.  Can someone provide some background/insights on this?
Aleague,385a8e,Row86,4,Tue Jun 2 02:11:34 2015 UTC,"Most Italian teams regularly keep loads of players on their tabs which will most likely never have a realistic chance of featuring in their teams. For homegrown players this is often a bit of a 'solidarity treatment', as keeping players within the system for a longer time often helps them get into another club rather than fall to obscurity. As for non-homegrown players, that's more of an investment. Buy cheap/free, sell with a slight profit. Do that in a large enough scale and you suddenly have a functional business model.   As for Italian ownership systems confusing you...well, can't blame you there. Co-ownership will be abolished starting next season though, so that'll be one part that's cleared up, although I do think it's a shame."

Aleague,38153r,timmmy8,5,Mon Jun 1 02:20:15 2015 UTC,"Tony Walmsley has added more venom to his front third in signing 24-year-old Australian attacker Mitch Austin from English side Cambridge United FC on a two-year deal.  Austin will arrive on the Central Coast in early July and have the advantage of joining the Mariners for a full pre-season when the first team returns from end of season leave.  Austin headed to the UK after being spotted by Rotherham United as a youngster playing for Manly United and now has the chance to return to Australia and prove himself in the Hyundai A-League after several loan spells.  Standing over six foot tall, Austin is an imposing figure and Walmsley is excited to have him at his attacking disposal for the upcoming season after appearing on his radar during his Head of Recruitment role at Sheffield United.  “I’ve known Mitch since being in the UK, one of my jobs at Sheffield was to track young Australians,” Walmsley said. “Now moving back to the Mariners it’s important to understand how good young Aussies are playing,” he said.  “With the Visa restrictions in the A-League and the new model we’re putting in place, Mitch is someone that fits that profile; a young Aussie talent with embedded potential that we can expose to the global market.  “Mitch has got incredible pace and great athletic ability, he’s six foot one so he immediately contributes some physical requirements we are looking for. He can go down the outside of players, has an excellent cross and gives us genuine width on the left hand side.  “He’s done some real hard yards and that helps shape a young player. The A-League is going to be demanding, but it’s going to give him a chance to shine and we believe he can play at a higher level,” Walmsley said.  Austin can’t wait for Season 11 of the Hyundai A-League where he hopes to be in Walmsley’s starting 11 come round one and the Manly junior thinks he can draw from his experiences in the UK to become a contributor in attack.  “I’d like to cement a place in the first 11, obviously it’s a longer pre-season to what I’m used to so I want to do well in the pre-season and hopefully I’ll be in the side and ready to run out,” Austin said.  “Over there you are fighting for wins every single week, I’m used to taking a touch and getting smashed so I’ve gained a lot from that and I’m now quicker on the ball,” he said.  “I’m naturally a left footed player so left wing is my main position, I’m quite quick, a decent crosser of the ball and hopefully I can chip in with a few goals also.  “Every game (in the A-League) is live in the UK so I’ve watched quite a bit of it, so I can’t wait to have a crack and it’s a great opportunity for myself to show what I can do,” Austin said."

Graham Arnold is also a reputable coach that he may want to play under if he is stuck with staying in the A-League. He could really end up being the coach who unleashes his full potential, getting him a deal overseas.  As Juric struggled to find good positions to receive the ball when playing up front for the socceroos, I couldn't help thinking that Popovic has been teaching him strange things. Once he gets the ball he can really punish a defence (on regarde la Final of the Asian cup) so he clearly has the ability to be an extremely useful player. Surely GA's knowledge from when he was a forward can help Juric here.  Which team would you sign for if you were offered a contract by both?"

Aleague,380k65,djpain,3,Mon Jun 1 01:30:44 2015 UTC,"Off course there is. After tuesday most of the team will be given 1 month holiday. Players not resigned will be allowed to leave and all that jazz. Once the team has returned from their holidays they will be assessed on fitness (this includes new players). They will then work about getting them to the same base level of fitness and then tactic work would start. Arnold tries to give each player the same amount of minutes during preseason, e.g vedran might get 60 minutes and bouzanis 30 minutes, the following game bouzanis 60 minutes and vderan 30. With a game a week (and mostly away) this should give the team ample time to get refreshed and learn how the coach wants them to play.  tldr- players get to go on holiday and don't need to worry about fitness."

It's an exhibition match so scouts take it with a grain of salt, whereas a big performance in an away ACL match will raise eyebrows both here and in Asia.

Plus you could get one of their shirts, signed. Thats worth a couple of bucks by itself"
Aleague,380k65,AvocadoCake,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:27:32 2015 UTC,"Sign for 10k less and you get to play against Chelsea   You really think a player would take a 10k to play an off-season game against Chelsea? I mean, sure, it's a nice experience, but $10k is a lot of money."
Aleague,380k65,littlejib,2,Mon Jun 1 09:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, might only be 1 or two, but over 23 players that gives you a bit more room in the cap.

Aleague,37pc2t,RedendBlack,3,Fri May 29 11:51:12 2015 UTC,"Ah well. Pretty good display from Adelaide, despite the result. Villareal seemed very lethargic for a large chunk of that match but turned it up a notch at the end. It's definitely more interesting to watch Adelaide play big friendly matches now that they attempt to control the game rather than sit back and occasionally counter."
Aleague,37pc2t,Ilandar,5,Fri May 29 11:56:51 2015 UTC,Great goal and counter by Adelaide. WHAT A FINISH SON!
Aleague,37pc2t,bamboosaou,4,Fri May 29 10:39:52 2015 UTC,To be honest Adelaide look a lot more exciting and dynamic than Villa right now. The pace both teams are trying to play is competely different.
Aleague,37pc2t,Walkerthon,3,Fri May 29 10:44:32 2015 UTC,The goal has definitely given them some noticeable confidence.

Aleague,37pc2t,Ilandar,3,Fri May 29 10:10:52 2015 UTC,I think we need to target another dedicated striker to play while Djite is injured and allow him more rest. Pablo Sanchez does ok but could be nice to have more options.

Not everything he said was necessarily incorrect but it was definitely 'spun'.  ANZAC Day is a day of mourning where people pay tribute to those who served. It's not promoting war. Gallipoli was a tragedy and that's why we have ANZAC day on the 25th of April. What he did was similar to bringing up bad things about somebody on the day of their funeral.

Aleague,37p4ee,falisimoses,19,Fri May 29 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"This obsession with marquees is ridiculous. Maybe I'm in the minority but I just don't get it... Yeah Drogba would've been cool, yeah Lampard would've been cool, Villa? Waste of time...  I think it's been proven that players like Broich, Berisha, Khalfallah, Carrusca bring a lot to the game and clubs are better off chasing those kinds of players rather than dumping great sums of money on someone who really couldn't give a shit either way."
Aleague,37p4ee,ShrimpinAintEazy,10,Fri May 29 08:14:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. When guys like ADP and drogba come to our league they don't really give a shit. They've proven themselves, they know they are on the team sheet week in week out, and there isn't much reason to work hard.   I'd like to see the focus more on quality than marquee players, growing the number of teams and a restructure of the salary cap instead of seeing endless column inches about old boys looking for a pay day."
Aleague,37p4ee,Notorganic,2,Fri May 29 08:29:02 2015 UTC,Cockershill also isn't factoring the destabilising effect a player like Villa or ADP have on a team and a club.   Has there ever been a big name marquee and actually have a decent hand in silverware or consistent success?
Aleague,37p4ee,ShrimpinAintEazy,2,Fri May 29 11:00:29 2015 UTC,Most of them are too old when they come here to contribute long term and if we can get them at a decent age or clubs aren't able to retain them for v extended periods of time.

Aleague,37p4ee,table_five,5,Sat May 30 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"It's not just about success on the field. Big, big names bring sponsorship deals, more people through the gates, and give the league opportunities in countries where it had not before. Case in point with ADP, the A-League gained a broadcast deal in Italy, attendances were up, ratings were up.  No coincidence that this season there hasn't been that big drawcard, household name to bring people to games, and that ratings and attendances have stalled.  Clubs should be looking for players that fit the team. Obviously. But getting someone that the average football fan knows is equally essential. The league is still young, and needs every bit of growth it can muster. Quality teams are one thing, but quality names and reputations are another."

Im highly critical of signing old boys looking for one last hurrah for a bit of cash. Clubs are much better off picking them wisely for someone who will fit the structure and contribute on a weekly basis rather than signing someone because he is a big name"
Aleague,37p4ee,cynikles,2,Fri May 29 08:31:52 2015 UTC,I suppose it comes down to getting someone that won't immediately draw crowds but will develop a following after good performances or someone that will immediately put bums on seats. Short v long term thinking I guess.

Aleague,37p4ee,AlarmClockBandit,4,Fri May 29 13:01:02 2015 UTC,"I really don't like the idea that a player is bigger than the club. Happened with ADP and he did as much harm as good for Sydney FC.   On the other hand if marquee players can help attract crowds and grow the game without the team suffering  due to the marquee, I am all for it. One thing you can't argue about the ADP signing is that it made people take notice of the a league"

Aleague,37ohy0,littlejib,5,Fri May 29 04:07:51 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but if a manager as useless as JVS can go 5 in a row with the same squad JA has no excuse for our losing run. I hope Brisbane fans like the sight of him thumping his chest after a 2-2 draw.

Aleague,37ohy0,littlejib,1 point,Fri May 29 06:36:48 2015 UTC,He was back for part of it but missed at least the game against Perth for his red v Sydney.
Aleague,37ohy0,thisphantomfortress,1 point,Fri May 29 06:52:23 2015 UTC,"Momentum very important and Orlando kick-started it all. Even if he did miss a game near the end of the run, the team were already in high spirits and confidence."
Aleague,37ohy0,cynikles,3,Fri May 29 07:31:52 2015 UTC,Was at the start. One player doesn't make the team. As soon as JA was gone we started winning. If it wasn't for the CFG take over her have set us back 5 years. I genuinely feel bad for Brisbane but I'm happy to be proved wrong
Aleague,37ohy0,thisphantomfortress,1 point,Fri May 29 07:37:55 2015 UTC,"I do think you underestimate how good Orlando was. Aloisi mentioned at the beginning of that season that he was aiming to build the team around him and then he got injured. Tactical inflexibility certainly might be one of his faults, but I do think he set up a system with Orlando in mind.  Either way, we'll find out if he's improved at all. I dare say we have better building blocks than what Aloisi had at Heart when he started. The core he's working with is much better imo."
Aleague,37ohy0,cynikles,2,Fri May 29 08:20:20 2015 UTC,There were times when Heart looked pretty good under him but their ability to get it into the net was atrocious. Much like that year he played for us.  Better recruitment and a full preseason and I don't see why he can't succeed.
Aleague,37ohy0,Walkerthon,4,Fri May 29 05:58:45 2015 UTC,"Needs to find a quality striker, Brisbane's and Aloisi's previous problem"
Aleague,37ohy0,littlejib,7,Fri May 29 06:06:39 2015 UTC,Eh. I think we'll hold onto Andrija. He's the easy option and his goal scoring ratio was quite good last season. He can only improve having a full preseason to get everyone used to him.
Aleague,37ohy0,Mello-D,2,Fri May 29 06:10:51 2015 UTC,Hopefully Ricky will be back in form too.
Aleague,37ohy0,kizzap,3,Fri May 29 07:13:39 2015 UTC,"I'll be interested to see how we come out and play against Liverpool. I'll withhold my judgement until season has started. He's got a whole preseason and what seems like a lot of control over the football side of the club, so I'm hoping he's learned a lot and can make his own mark here and not just try and play the same football as Franz and Mulvey before him."

Aleague,37ooiw,madzaman,6,Fri May 29 04:52:49 2015 UTC,To be honest I never rated him before this season but he really came good towards the end.   With a full preseason Faty and Jurman could make a mean defensive pairing.
Aleague,37ooiw,Walkerthon,1 point,Fri May 29 05:40:05 2015 UTC,Don't prefer Nikola at CB?
Aleague,37ooiw,rodz7,2,Fri May 29 05:45:26 2015 UTC,"3 months ago I would have said for certain he's a better player, but now I'm not so sure. I would still continue to play Petkovic at left back for the time being (Assuming he doesn't continue to repeat his GF performance) because he provides a lot of solidarity down that right wing where a lot of teams seem to favour.   Also Nikola seems to be suffering from a severe case of ""Good and Bad days"""
Aleague,37ooiw,Walkerthon,3,Fri May 29 05:50:08 2015 UTC,"Agree with you here. Lots of love for Nikola, but he looks beeter on the wing than the cent're for me (at least in defense, he could be better up the pitch crossing in), but Jurman looks to be a natural CB for me. Would be fantastic to make it through the whole season with the same CB pairing."

Aleague,37lovz,Nos_4r2,3,Fri May 29 03:35:49 2015 UTC,And we thought Herald Sun article comments on football were insane enough.
Aleague,37lovz,TheFightingImp,7,Fri May 29 04:02:54 2015 UTC,"General deluded idiots. I'm personally very excited, I think it's good the top women's players will start getting more widespread exposure."
Aleague,37lovz,xGrumbly,5,Thu May 28 23:42:31 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, for sure. It's a great. I don't know if I'm saying it right but when I was kid, nothing like this happened, so I think it's pretty cool that little girls have actual women players as a sort of representative. Also boys too. Nothing wrong with looking up to sportswomen.   I just get a kick out of disproportionate reactions. Almost as funny as people falling over."
Aleague,37lovz,falisimoses,2,Thu May 28 23:48:41 2015 UTC,I do wonder if the female players will be scaled to match the men or whether the physical differences will be telling? I'd imagine they might restrict it to solely MvM or FvF matchups though.
Aleague,37lovz,xGrumbly,2,Thu May 28 23:56:00 2015 UTC,It's restricted matchups so they'll probably rate the women in relation to women. I imagine they'll remove that restriction at some point.
Aleague,37lovz,falisimoses,1 point,Fri May 29 00:00:51 2015 UTC,Probably once they implement more teams and get a wider base of female players I can see that happening.
Aleague,37lovz,xGrumbly,2,Fri May 29 01:02:09 2015 UTC,"Most are just jokes, it's the ones that think it's a bad thing I'm curious about. How does adding women make the game worse in any way?"
Aleague,37lovz,flukus,6,Fri May 29 01:11:15 2015 UTC,A lot of people are thinking that EA can't do more than one thing at once and they're afraid that the deficiencies in the game won't be addressed because they spent too much time on this mode.   The others that just don't like the idea...well...I don't know how to explain that.

I've always thought it'd be cool to play with Kyah Simon, Lisa De Vanna, Katrina Gorry (she'd better have 99 longshots) etc."
Aleague,37lovz,angusozi,12,Thu May 28 20:00:10 2015 UTC,"they're mostly all man-children, the ones complaining,"

Aleague,37lovz,sexshepard91,6,Thu May 28 22:43:07 2015 UTC,"It's about time FIFA started to expand it's player base in game. Been to long where if you don't play as a European club you get the short straw. Where is the Asian confederation? No ACL no FFA Cup, I love wanting to play an Australia club and only get to play 29 - 30 games a year, compared to 50+ overseas"
Aleague,37lovz,Kamone1202,3,Thu May 28 21:56:57 2015 UTC,If you want the ACL you can always go to PES.

It's great that EA is at least somewhat forward thinking on this issue.  And one thing's for sure, if we want soccer to grow culturally in this country, we need both genders included and marketed to."

I always thought that putting women in the game would be a good idea. Definitely a shame that the reigning world champions won't be in it though. I really hope EA and Konami can come to some kind of an agreement on JFA rights."

Aleague,37ldk8,CrashP,7,Thu May 28 14:00:03 2015 UTC,Can't think of a much better place for him to be at the moment. Could be a catalyst in getting QPR back to top flight and the sky's the limit from there.
Aleague,37ldk8,masturgreat,2,Thu May 28 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"As a villa fan, mega :'(  As an Australian football fan, this is a pretty good move. I still think Villa would have been a better option.   I don't know the full story though, so things might have fallen through at Villa (wouldn't be surprised lol)."
Aleague,37ldk8,PooDiePie,1 point,Thu May 28 15:02:01 2015 UTC,From what i understand him and another mid from swindon were wanted by villa so i guess maybe he thought he wouldn't get game time?
Aleague,37ldk8,sexshepard91,2,Thu May 28 22:44:42 2015 UTC,Honestly though will get more game time at QPR or Villa? (genuine question)
Aleague,37ldk8,djhauk,7,Fri May 29 00:43:11 2015 UTC,"QPR just released two midfielders and have another whose contract hasn't been renewed yet. I think that is a good thing in terms of his playing time, as I can see him being high up the order being a creative midfielder. http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/qpr-release-six-players-rio-ferdinand-joey-barton   At Villa he would have to compete with delph, cleverly, westwood, sanchez. So I think this is a good move."
Aleague,37ldk8,DJ_B0B,1 point,Fri May 29 01:38:26 2015 UTC,"I thought so. Actually saw that article the other day before the Luongo QPR tweet came out but completely forgot. Better for him to get consistent game time in the championship than to compete at Villa in the premier league IMO, that way he'll stay on top of his game for socceroos matches as well"
Aleague,37ldk8,djhauk,2,Fri May 29 05:00:22 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised if QPR wasn't in the mix for promotion at the end of next season. Really smart move IMO, will get plenty of first team action in a higher league and a good chance at moving to the top flight as a well established squad member in a year or maybe 2 at the most."
Aleague,37ldk8,JuiceSpringsteen8,1 point,Fri May 29 00:43:50 2015 UTC,Stoked! hopefully QPR are fine with him to be a starting cm and focus on filling gaps at cb where they thought rio would do a job for them and at striker mainly because i assume Austin will be leaving which will be a massive blow

Aleague,37kkuw,littlejib,7,Thu May 28 12:44:24 2015 UTC,"Very good thing. It made no sense for Mariners to play in North Sydney, or even try and win over the North Sydney market.  Here's a picture explaining why  The 'North Sydney' we're talking about here isn't the northernmost outskirts of Sydney, if we were to rename it nowadays we would call it 'Just North of Sydney City' or something.  You have to drive inland, then back out to the coast in order to get to North Sydney, then after all of that driving, you are only a short drive over the Harbour Bridge away from the SFS.  North Sydney is basically just an extension of the CBD, it has no relation to the Central Coast whatsoever and every football fan there is already a Sydney FC fan. There are 3 national parks in the way, completely eliminating any other wild imagined connections you may want to draw between North Sydney and the Central Coast."
Aleague,37kkuw,PooDiePie,2,Thu May 28 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair they were also trying to get the Northern Beaches which, public transport wise, are kind of cut off from the rest of Sydney."

He didn't really seem that interested or enthusiastic about being interviewed, he looked like he wanted to just walk away the whole time they were badgering him, and awkwardly talked about ""Uh, um, uh, I've always been a fan of, um, uh, Liverpool, uh yeah, I guess.

I would guess Bouzanis to be slightly ahead right now, but then again Tyson only kept clean sheets for us.

You could even refresh yourself on maths A if you wanted to.  I find This Guy is particularly good at what he does, most of what I have learned so far is on his channel. If it isn't on his channel then there's somewhere else on YouTube that has it.  Youtube videos are really mostly just for practicing skills, but there are places you can go that will explain concepts and theory as well.  Khan Academy is a brilliant place to visit, which has videos in a similar format. It's set up around the US system which is slightly different, but all the same skills are there scrambled under different subheadings. A few things might have different terminology as well.  It's all out there on the internet somewhere, the best part is, you can learn it all at your own pace. Some of the 'hardest' things in maths are actually pretty simple if you just practice. Those people who you thought were maths wizards were really just the students who did the most maths homework."

Aleague,37j9l6,mav_y,2,Fri May 29 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"Nice one! I wouldn't worry about the ""not enough experience"" line because if that was such a huge concern then they wouldn't have called you in for an interview. Obviously you have some good attributes and a transferable skill set, so they wanted to see if you have the right motivation.   More often than not employers hire people they can work with and they're willing to take on someone they can invest in.   Make sure you follow up with a quick email thanking them for their time and reiterate your interest. Let us know how you go."

Geria on the other hand, great defender but not as good in attack compared to Georgevski.   I would rather we sign a defender in the mould of Geria than Georgevski.

Either they stick with the current choices, ban everyone from bidding and go with new countries, or start fresh with new people involved at FIFA and each of the bids.  Also think the current AFC would be a lot more supportive of an Australian bid now than they were with a Qatari fraud leader 5 years ago."

The traditional club of Flingern will intensify with Ross Archibald.  For Archibald is a big step in the North Rhine-Westphalian capital.

Aleague,37fc5c,RichieMclad,8,Wed May 27 05:27:06 2015 UTC,"Is there still hope that we may somehow end up hosting?   If you asked me last year I would have said that the US would get it if Qatar is stripped. However, I like to think (or delude myself) that the huge success of the Asian Cup off the pitch, and the fact that we're in the same confederation as Qatar, would give us a real shot.  Related question: If Qatar is stripped and the bidding process redone, should we bid for it by ourselves, or should we do a joint bid with NZ?"
Aleague,37fc5c,SerTahu,16,Wed May 27 05:31:58 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no way we should ever do a joint bid for a football world cup with NZ.

Aleague,37fc5c,PooDiePie,12,Wed May 27 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"Including NZ would only stand to severely weaken our bid. They do not have the stadiums, infrastructure, passion, commercial power, or football history to be an attractive place to hold a World Cup - even with a joint bid."
Aleague,37fc5c,sleazypornoname,4,Wed May 27 06:09:30 2015 UTC,"Many people (not me), would also argue Australia doesn't have the stadiums, passion, commercial power or football history to host a world cup either."

Aleague,37fc5c,TomEmilioDavies,3,Wed May 27 13:29:48 2015 UTC,FIFA banned joint bids after the Korea/Japan Cup.  They are reinstating them for 2026 onwards provided there is only 1 organising committee.
Aleague,37fc5c,cynikles,5,Wed May 27 06:14:47 2015 UTC,I am all for the idea of a joint bid with NZ.
Aleague,37fc5c,SerTahu,2,Wed May 27 05:41:50 2015 UTC,"I like the idea but the fact that we're in two different federations would scupper that idea. FIFA aren't all that keen on dual-nation bids anyway as has been mentioned elsewhere. I don't think the AFC would allow the OFC to take some of its thunder if we were to run it.  I don't think we'd be awarded the cup in any case. We would have to expand, upgrade and build appropriate stadia in a reasonably short turn around. I don't think we could do it.  England and the US already have the facilities, and with UEFA hosting in 2018, it'll likely go to the US."
Aleague,37fc5c,SerTahu,2,Wed May 27 06:22:42 2015 UTC,"Same. Although we could probably do it by ourselves, I think a joint bid would be easier as it would greatly reduce the number of stadiums that would need to be built/upgraded. Imagine this:  10 stadiums:   2x Sydney (ANZ and Allianz) 2x Melbourne (MCG and Etihad. As nice as AAMI is, it's too small) Auckland (Eden Park) Wellington (Westpac) Christchurch (Lancaster. It would give them an excuse to rebuild it following the earthquake) Brisbane (Suncorp) Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) Perth (Subiaco) Maybe throw in Canberra and Auckland (Mt Smart) or Newcastle if they need 12 stadiums.   Simultaneous kickoff with Australia's first game in ANZ, and NZ's first game in Eden Park. Final in the MCG."
Aleague,37fc5c,clark007e,8,Wed May 27 05:53:15 2015 UTC,Nah fuck spending money to upgrade AFL and Cricket stadiums. Australia needs more rectangular stadia.
Aleague,37fc5c,-Volumes_,2,Wed May 27 06:31:35 2015 UTC,I was just talking about existing stadiums. Of course new rectangular stadiums would be better than some of those options.
Aleague,37fc5c,AvocadoCake,2,Wed May 27 06:35:07 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I think if we get it at such short notice than those oval grounds will need to be considered. Ideally we should build new rectangle stadiums.

Aleague,37fed7,kona_boy,0,Thu May 28 09:06:57 2015 UTC,He was a regular first team player at Utrecht before copping a few injuries. Quality like that doesn't evaporate.
Aleague,37fed7,cynikles,0,Thu May 28 09:54:39 2015 UTC,Go watch any game he started this season.

Aleague,37eba9,rezplzk,7,Wed May 27 00:33:26 2015 UTC,I never was near good enough to play at any sort of semi professional level (chose school / uni).  I do know/played with heaps of footballers.  Some who play/ed for Australia and others who just play A-League.  Why did you choose just the last ten years?  What I mean is; to tell the true story you probably have to go back and look at how our 2006 WC squad came together/developed.    2006 was our pinnacle.  Despite winning the Asian Cup this year no-one sane person could argue our 2015 squad is anywhere near our 2006 squad.    Happy to argue with any who thinks otherwise.  If you purely mean rise of A-League; I can try chat to a few current A-League players but imo your best bet is to actually contact your local club who will use it as a PR opportunity imo (especially now it is off-season).  Finally reach out to local players on twitter.  Where are you based?

Minority opinion: Although you're correct that our '06 squad would beat our '15 squad, I think that our squad was strongest in '08.

Aleague,37eg6y,aninstituteforants,3,Wed May 27 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"SOCCER authorities will probe Melbourne Heart over star Harry Kewell’s $1 million-a-year Jeep contract, details of which emerged in a lawsuit against a former Chrysler boss.  Football Federation Australia said it would investigate whether there were any salary cap consequences for Melbourne City, formerly Heart.  The club is believed to have paid Kewell about $80,000 for a one-year deal in 2013-14.  The FFA said it was given information about the Jeep sponsorship deal when Kewell signed with Heart, and was making inquiries with those who held management pos­itions at Heart at the time.  Prominent sports lawyers told the Herald Sun any deal that was not between a club and a player risked being in breach of salary cap rules.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Australia is suing former managing director Clyde Anthony Campbell, alleging he misappropriated or misused over $30 million in company funds.  It is expected to go to the Federal Court next month to try to freeze assets — including properties in Brighton, Bright and the Gold Coast — linked to Mr Campbell. It claims that he authorised promotional cars for celebrities, including Shane Warne, Elizabeth Hurley and Gary Ablett Jr, beyond his professional capacity and to its commercial detriment.  No allegation has been made against Kewell, Warne, Hurley or Ablett.  Mr Campbell, who is yet to file a defence to the action, ­denies any impropriety.  Kewell was offered a three-year deal — extended for three years after Mr Campbell left FCA — to drive a Jeep and promote the brand. It included incentives “on condition” he sign to Heart in 2013-14 and that $1 million a year be paid to the Harry Kewell Football Academy, according to ­material before the court.  FCA says Mr Campbell breached his employment contract in signing deals with Kewell, including through Elite Sports Properties, and “improperly used his position to gain an advantage for ESP and/or Kewell”.  “The cost of the agreements significantly outweigh the benefits obtained. The full extent of the loss and damage will depend on whether the Kewell transactions are binding,” FCA says in its statement of claim.  FCA argues Mr Campbell had no authority to sign a deal giving the Gold Coast Suns and Ablett access to an “ambassador vehicle” with fuel cards and toll passes in Queensland and Victoria, and disputes his providing promotional vehicles to Warne and Hurley in Britain.  It alleges he misused money to bankroll a lavish lifestyle and travel, make unauthorised investments, and wrongly or without commercial justification enter into contracts at ­inflated prices.  Mr Campbell described the accusations as scandalous, ­arguing he led FCA through a significant period of growth."

Aleague,37bgdp,djpain,2,Tue May 26 12:03:04 2015 UTC,Definitely keen to see what Blackwood can do. The staff have been talking him up like crazy so hopefully he delivers next season. It's why I'm not too upset at the prospect of losing Scorey. Of course it would still suck major ass but having a promising replacement in Blackwood would soften the blow.
Aleague,37bgdp,mav_y,2,Tue May 26 12:25:39 2015 UTC,"I've seen Blackwood in NYL games and he was definitely quality, but often making that jump to senior football can be difficult.

Aleague,37asah,shitidiotturtle,2,Tue May 26 09:47:46 2015 UTC,He did have a contract with the jets though. He was never fired on the books
Aleague,37asah,sexshepard91,1 point,Tue May 26 10:19:23 2015 UTC,ah i thought he was one of the mutual termination players after the PFA stepped in after his sacking. I hope the FFA are going to make him an offer then
Aleague,37asah,drop_bars_not_bombs,2,Tue May 26 10:33:37 2015 UTC,I dont think he was. I just remember he stayed on after Stubbins/Tinkler culled half the senior players because they couldn't work out a termination probably due to having to pay him out. If he is still on the team sheet then they will definitley offer him a new contract whether or not he accepts it is another question

Aleague,37awp1,noeledison,4,Tue May 26 09:08:11 2015 UTC,I really really want him to succeed.  I'm sceptical of the signing. But he's got a season worth of support. Any new coach needs a chance to implement their play without having a gun pointed at them
Aleague,37awp1,tbkh91,4,Tue May 26 09:55:06 2015 UTC,"Easy to joke about how poor we were under Aloisi but he was cursed by a huge injury toll and a pretty mediocre list in truth. It seems like his knowledge is pretty extensive, whether he can use that to formulate viable tactics, and transmit them to the players, will be the test. I honestly hope he goes well."
Aleague,37awp1,twisterjumanji,2,Tue May 26 09:58:43 2015 UTC,"He also seemed to genuinely take his sacking on board and work hard to improve. Of his own bat, heading off to Europe to immerse himself in the systems he felt comfortable with, in an effort to learn more."

Aleague,37awp1,PooDiePie,2,Tue May 26 12:13:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair... He has taken the Victory U20 side to top of the NPL1 table with 12 unbeaten games. I know it doesn't come even close to comparing to the A-League, but still not bad.

Aleague,37autq,c00kie7,4,Tue May 26 07:27:58 2015 UTC,... I have no idea how to take this. I'm really confused. Aloisi seems like a really nice guy but that's not what matters. I'm not convinced he's been away long enough to have learnt from his mistakes at Heart. At all.
Aleague,37autq,falisimoses,6,Tue May 26 07:36:37 2015 UTC,"Neither - unless he's learnt a lot from analysing on Fox Sports, seems like a weird choice. My guess is that Rado will play a bigger role (if he's still around, who knows at this rate) unlike Mulvey - which was  a reason why he was sacked.    But a coach who's coaching experience is a bottom of the table team and a youth team? Seems right up the board's alley."

Aleague,37autq,c00kie7,5,Tue May 26 07:47:29 2015 UTC,"Confirmed in statement to club's members :/   Brisbane Roar is proud to announce John Aloisi as the club's new Head Coach.  The legendary former Socceroo will direct all football operations at the three-time Hyundai A-League Champion club.  The 39-year-old will join the Roar in June and prepares to face Liverpool FC on the 17th July.   ""I am extremely proud and honoured to join Brisbane Roar,'' Aloisi said.  “The club has defined success in the first 10 years of the Hyundai A-League and I am determined to ensure the high standards the Roar players, members, sponsors and supporters have come to expect continue under my stewardship.”   Brisbane Roar Chairman Chris Fong said Aloisi was the perfect fit to launch a new era for the club.  ""John brings to the Roar a passionate understanding of Australian football and the Hyundai A-League,"" Fong said.  ""I am impressed by his determination to succeed and the fresh focus he will bring to the club.""  Aloisi made 55 appearances (27 goals) for the Socceroos and famously scored the winning penalty to secure Australia's place at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Aloisi made his professional debut for Adelaide City at the age of 15.  He is the only Australian footballer to have played in Europe's three major leagues – the English Premier League, Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga – in a playing career spanning 20 years.  He played 459 games and scored 127 goals across the three competitions at clubs including Portsmouth, Coventry City, CA Osasuna and Deportivo Alavés.  Following his return to Australia in 2007, Aloisi has been heavily involved in the Hyundai A-League as a player (Central Coast Mariners, Sydney FC and Melbourne Heart) and a coach with Melbourne Heart in 2012/13.  He is currently a football analyst for Fox Sports and has been working as a development coach with Melbourne Victory's National Youth League and National Premier Leagues sides."

Aleague,37autq,aninstituteforants,5,Tue May 26 09:16:57 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to give him the support and trust he deserves as a newly appointed coach.  My questioning is more pointed at the Roar board. Has Aloisi really shown enough to deserve this job?  At this stage, I'm sceptical, but I'm still 100% behind Aloisi until he's had a fair go.  Like I said with Mulvey this year. Don't fire a coach until the season is over. As long as we have a shot at finals, he's got my support. Same for Aloisi. He's got next season with unconditional support."
Aleague,37autq,tbkh91,2,Tue May 26 09:41:04 2015 UTC,I'm at least willing to give him a chance in the spot.  I like him as a person and I'm sure he has learnt a few things in his travels.

Aleague,37b3gc,jp23,2,Tue May 26 09:09:42 2015 UTC,"Relax. It's very early in the off-season, Coe has just been released and an experienced, quality goalkeeper has just become available. Victory would be crazy not to at least offer him a deal.   Turnbull was just an injury replacement and so they need a second goalkeeper anyway. Yes, Lawrence Thomas has improved recently but he still hasn't proven himself over the course of a season. What if he takes another dive? It also doesn't hurt to have someone else to push him along and learn from.   Also, plenty of time left to fill those more urgent spots in the squad so I wouldn't be concerned just yet. This is just a very well timed opportunity and another example of Victory always pushing for the best players available. It's exactly what they should be doing."
Aleague,37b3gc,freeriderau,1 point,Tue May 26 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"Why not just sign Turnbull again? can't see him wanting big chunks of cap like Vukovic would be worth. Promote Spinella as required and go from there. Need fullbacks and a Millsy replacement, plus maclaren if Arch doesn't stay."

Overpriced tickets to compensate for the cheaper tickets in melbourne to attract fans out of city and a steady downturn in crowds for rugby league over the last 9 years means they are going to struggle to sell out anything if it keeps going like this
Aleague,37arig,Kamone1202,2,Tue May 26 08:09:51 2015 UTC,I was under the impression origin tickets were cheaper for the Sydney game then the Brisbane one. Also first series win in 8 years you'd think they'd have a bit of momentum bringing crowds back.
Aleague,37arig,Seethus,1 point,Tue May 26 09:11:56 2015 UTC,They increased the price for Sydney and Brisbane games to subsidize the cost of tickets in Melbourne which are considerably cheaper to attract new fans.

Aleague,378ywm,bambalam101,10,Mon May 25 23:19:21 2015 UTC,"DIDIER Drogba is definitely coming to Sydney – and will have a long list of interested parties wanting his attention, including the Wanderers.  Drogba will be part of the Chelsea squad that leaves for Australia later this week after being presented with their EPL title yesterday, despite announcing he is leaving the club.  Tour organisers have confirmed that Drogba will travel, and A-League clubs are anxious to have discussions with the Ivorian striker about the next stage of his career.  It’s believed officials from Western Sydney are keen to ascertain Drogba’s plans and salary expectations, with the club determined to land a high-profile marquee for next season.  It’s inconceivable that Sydney FC will not also make at least tentative enquiries along similar lines, as they continue the search for a new marquee to replace Marc Janko, while Perth are in the market for a similar signing to draw a line under the salary cap scandal that ruined their season.  However agents familiar with the region believe Drogba will be offered lucrative multi-million-dollar contracts in the Middle East.  Yesterday though his attention was only on his farewell at Stamford Bridge, as Chelsea signed off the season with a 3-1 win over Sunderland.  Before raising the Premier League trophy aloft, Chelsea’s players first decided to lift something just as precious: Drogba.  In an unusual, mid-game pause around 30 minutes into the game, Drogba was carried to the touchline in a planned flamboyant substitution.  Then in his final moments as a Chelsea player, the 37-year-old removed his shirt and waved farewell to each corner of Stamford Bridge and removed the armband handed to him for the day by club captain John Terry.  “It was John’s desire to give him the armband and for the players to bring him from the pitch was up to them, they like him a lot,” Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said. “He was very good for the young players ... and he made a fantastic contribution for us this season.”  Elsewhere Hull were relegated after drawing 0-0 with Manchester United, with Newcastle United saved by a 2-0 win over West Ham."

EDIT: Seems like Davutovic has confirmed that Murdocca has signed for Avondale and is not on loan.

Far more dangerous for a larger amount of people than the lighting of a flare. Seems like these 3 year olds have a better idea of common sense than some people too.
Aleague,3774n8,Kamone1202,-3,Tue May 26 01:43:52 2015 UTC,Because it's illadvised and dangerous   Same goes for lighting flares.   Far more dangerous for a larger amount of people than the lighting of a flare.   Says a WSW fan. Surprise surprise.   Seems like these 3 year olds have a better idea of common sense than some people too.    Don't want to be pepper sprayed? Don't light a flare then. I wouldn't take advice from you about what constitutes common sense if you're trying to defend your right (which you don't by the way) to light a flare. But carry on.
Aleague,3774n8,MVFC4life,5,Tue May 26 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Don't want to be pepper sprayed? Don't light a flare then.   So your logic is that 500 people lit a flare and deserved to be pepper sprayed? Kamone is merely pointing out the stupidity of not only idiots lighting flares in a crowd, but 'trained' police pepper spraying indiscriminately."
Aleague,3774n8,notbilbo,-2,Tue May 26 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"My logic if you don't want to be treated like idiots, don't act like one.   But hey, police are always wrong in WSW fans' eyes.   It's okay, I understand you have a sense of entitlement.   but 'trained' police pepper spraying indiscriminately   Coming from a WSW fan, no bias in that sentence at all. No aggression from the fans when it happened at all. Police weren't outnumbered at all. Fans were listening to what the police were telling them to do right? RIGHT? But the police still went...""Hmmmm yes they are listening nicely to what we asked them to do, LETS FUCKEN SPRAY THEM.""  Give me a fucken break.  The delusion is high with this bunch."
Aleague,3774n8,MVFC4life,6,Tue May 26 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"An officer tackled the wrong guy, so  I assume the rbb went a bit nuts at them and the police were assuming the worst.  They hear the angry cries of, ""wtf are you doing?"" ""That's the wrong guy"" and take it as a threat when it's really just shocked bystanders. Think of the people who got hit by the spray who didn't even yell anything.  I doubt more than one person could lay a hand on a policeman without 50 other people trying to pull them back. Believe it or not, not everybody in the rbb is there to cause trouble. Even I give rbb members more credit than that.  You would think though, that incidents like this would open their eyes to the problems that flares can indirectly cause.  The fucksticks outside the ground jumping up and down towards the police chanting ""RBB Ole Ole Ole"" deserved a good daily intake of potassium and manganese directly through the eyes. Even if they weren't going to lay a hand on the officers they were just being idiots."
Aleague,3774n8,PooDiePie,3,Tue May 26 03:14:55 2015 UTC,"team I support doesn't make any difference to the fact of how stupid it was that people were OC sprayed, I'm sure everyone that was sprayed, probably more so the child treated at westmead children's hospital could tell how unpleasant it was.   I'm sure all the people that the experience of it in their eyes and mouth thought the sane thing, if I don't light a flare nothing will happen to me, yet here we are a few weeks after the fact that a large amount of people copped it for the actions of the person lighting the flare.   I do expect not to get OC sprayed because I've never even handled a flare in an any aspect of my life, let alone lit one at a football match and I'm sure their are many people who feel this way aswell. Ontop of that I've never seen anyone light one because it's already on the ground under seats when it's ignited.   That's ok I won't be taking advice from someone who thinks it's ok for 100+ people to be OC sprayed because someone lit a flare."
Aleague,3774n8,Kamone1202,-2,Tue May 26 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"if I don't light a flare nothing will happen to me  probably more so the child treated at westmead children's hospital could tell how unpleasant it was   Funny instead of blaming the police, why not blame those who lit the flares? Of course the people who lit the flares are NEVER in the wrong right? RIGHT?  And oh wow suddenly you're oh so concerned about the children at the game! But do the idiots think about the children when they light a flare? Why of course not! Police always at fault! Flare lighters never at fault!  Police brutality is never okay. But the people who lit flares thinks it's okay to do it are kidding themselves.   If they don't want people to get sprayed, don't lit flares. Why don't you start addressing this point of the argument instead of avoiding and go on about accusing (yes I used the word accusing) police of randomly spraying innocent bystanders who were courteous and nice right? Because the police weren't fearing for their own lives when WSW fans have a reputation for aggression right?  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-26/pepper-spray-used-at-aleague-violence-perth-glory-western-sydney/6422580   Police said they tried to remove the man they thought was responsible but had to use capsicum spray and call for backup when some in the crowd became aggressive.   Enough said."

Aleague,3762tz,alvinng,3,Mon May 25 04:55:57 2015 UTC,Anyone watch him on a regular basis? is he good enough to be a consistent starter for a PL team?
Aleague,3762tz,KingOfArmpitFetishes,2,Mon May 25 06:03:28 2015 UTC,Was rated 4th best player in football league 1 (behind some pretty decent guys)
Aleague,3762tz,sexshepard91,5,Mon May 25 07:37:15 2015 UTC,"he was put in league ones team of the season if i remember correctly. League one to premier league will be such a huge step up though, i don't think he will start straight away"
Aleague,3762tz,AttackClown,1 point,Mon May 25 09:27:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah i agree, i think he might not get game time for a little bit as well. But i'd prefer him at Villa/Palace over QPR even if it meant he doesnt start straight up"
Aleague,3762tz,sexshepard91,1 point,Mon May 25 09:44:52 2015 UTC,"And in top 10 outside the Prem, lot of championship players behind him too"
Aleague,3762tz,table_five,6,Mon May 25 08:09:43 2015 UTC,Would Villa be a good move for him?
Aleague,3762tz,falisimoses,15,Mon May 25 04:48:29 2015 UTC,"As a Villa fan I think so. If Cleverley doesn't stay, Delph is his only direct opposition for a spot in the starting line up really. Plus Sherwood has worked with him before so I'd say Villa would be favourites to get him."
Aleague,3762tz,GeorgeDyer,11,Mon May 25 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"Sherwood's 3-man midfield would really work well for him as well. They get the cover to be more expressive in there. As a United fan that watched Cleverley go backwards in a 2 man midfield, it's refreshing to see him excel again a bit further up the pitch. Would benefit Luongo greatly, as opposed to the very rigid midfields that West Ham and Palace* play. Depends who WH hire though I guess."
Aleague,3762tz,kiac,2,Mon May 25 08:01:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think that he would have to compete with Cleverley or Delph necessarily. The advantage he has over the other two is he is a lot more versatile through the middle of the park and can play DM,CM,or AM. He's played most of the season at DM/deep lying playmaker for Swindon so I would think that he could fit in there well with Delph and Cleverley up further and his main competition would be with Westwood."
Aleague,3762tz,suicidal_smrtcar,1 point,Mon May 25 09:31:56 2015 UTC,Thanks. I know nothing of Villa and don't want him too far down the pecking order. I'd love for him to get regular game time.
Aleague,3762tz,falisimoses,2,Mon May 25 09:07:10 2015 UTC,"I reckon, look at some of the youngsters like Jack Grealish and Scott Sinclair who are currently part of the first team regularly. Fabian Delph started as a 19-20 year old at Villa and look how far his game has progressed.  He will get a fair amount of first team game time at Villa, something that other clubs in the PL that take in a lot of youngsters can't guarantee."
Aleague,3762tz,PooDiePie,8,Mon May 25 05:37:35 2015 UTC,"Youngers  Sinclair   Um. Sinclair is like a poor mans Walcott. He is a player who you still view as young but really, he is 26/27 next season."
Aleague,3762tz,EnglishHooligan,1 point,Mon May 25 05:43:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps he was a strange example, but there are plenty more.  Agbonlahor has been at the club since 2005, even though his performances have been up and down, you can't deny that Villa is a terrific club for him.  Andreas Weimann has been at the club since 2010, when he was 18. He has since cemented his spot in the first team, and has made quite a few appearances for Austria.  Marc Albrighton is also a product of Aston Villa. He has represented England at youth level and he has definitely proven himself as a top flight player.  Matthew Lowton, Ashley Westwood and Bacuna have also boosted their careers at Villa after joining in their early 20s. All are now competent and regular first team players in the PL."
Aleague,3762tz,PooDiePie,1 point,Mon May 25 06:19:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was not disagreeing about Aston Villa. I think they would be great for him. They're not a club that, IMO, seems they will be relegated, while at the same time I can see Luongo getting plenty of playing time, even if off the bench initially.  My post was just a joke post."
Aleague,3762tz,EnglishHooligan,1 point,Mon May 25 06:37:50 2015 UTC,"Well Sinclair was a pretty stupid example tbh.  Aston Villa haven't been relegated since the Premier League started, despite this season being the worst finish for a long time, I also doubt they will finish so low again in seasons to come."

Aleague,376ks4,wanderingrhino,6,Mon May 25 08:50:10 2015 UTC,He'll be 30 in August. I don't believe his Socceroos career is much anymore. He'll be 32 for 2018 and 33 in 2019 so I am sure Australia can find someone else to fill his spot for him.

Aleague,376ks4,jonzey,1 point,Tue May 26 05:56:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe I didn't word my thoughts well.   If Milligan leaves, Victory is still a fairly strong team. Broxham or Mahazi could step in without Victory signing another player.  In my mind, Spira is a perfect fit in that role. If Victory manages to pull it off and sign him to replace Milligan, your midfield would be stronger than it is if they just slotted Broxham or Mahazi for Milligan.  Obviously would be hard to find anyone to replace Milligan. Probably the best DM in the ALeague for me.  Hopefully that clears it up!"
Aleague,376ks4,suicidal_smrtcar,1 point,Tue May 26 06:01:36 2015 UTC,"Ah fair enough, I thought you were saying Spiro would do a better job there than Millsy."
Aleague,376ks4,MVFC4life,6,Tue May 26 06:05:27 2015 UTC,Would be a massive fee coming in if he moved. He's still signed to 2017.   Shouldn't go to a substandard league though. However it's his career so he's obviously in it for the cash.
Aleague,376ks4,Row86,11,Mon May 25 08:27:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the Middle Eastern leagues are any worse than the ALeague.   Compared to the European leagues, they're probably not as good but I don't reckon it's a step down from the ALeague to the Middle East.  If he hasn't gotten any offers from Europe and his options are to stay at Victory or the Middle East, it would probably be in his best interest to move.  He's turning 30 soon too so the European boat might have sailed."
Aleague,376ks4,wanderingrhino,6,Mon May 25 08:56:33 2015 UTC,"The middle eastern leagues aren't necessarily worse than the A League, they are very good technically and also very well drilled. The major difference you notice when you watch them though is that they are really slow, even compared to the A League. It's kind of why it's a great league for the older guys, because they can keep playing without wearing out their body too much. It's shit for young guys though because they don't get that intense experience to improve."
Aleague,376ks4,jonzey,0,Mon May 25 09:44:52 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of ALeague fans are over estimating the quality of the ALeague when comparing to other leagues (in this case the Middle East).  If the ALeague is THAT fantastic and so much ""faster"" than other leagues in Asia, why aren't players from overseas flocking to our leagues (I know I know salary cap and visa spots)?   It's kind of why it's a great league for the older guys, because they can keep playing without wearing out their body too much.   Because no old guys ever come to the ALeague right?    The major difference you notice when you watch them though is that they are really slow, even compared to the A League.   Have you seen CCM and Newcastle Jets play? Pit them against some of the mid table teams in the Middle East and they'll get destroyed."

Aleague,376ks4,freeriderau,1 point,Mon May 25 09:01:12 2015 UTC,Thats surely what would happen but it would buy us fuck all I think. The step down in quality would be much too large for us to cover. I can't think of an Australian #8 who is as good as Mills at the moment.  Money isn't the problem for us. I just don't know of another player that would be willing to come to the league to fill that spot. I don't think we have any foreign spots left either.

Aleague,376ks4,Row86,1 point,Mon May 25 22:24:40 2015 UTC,Holland would be good. Amini I don't know about.   I'd be loathe to drop MDP. He is incredibly solid and better than any Aussie CB we would have access to. Cheap too.

Aleague,376ks4,Row86,11,Mon May 25 08:57:40 2015 UTC,Those guys won't even come close to what Mills does for our side.
Aleague,376ks4,ShrimpinAintEazy,2,Mon May 25 09:00:38 2015 UTC,"By putting Brox in the DM role, the likes of Galloway and Geria can cement their spot. They are the future of the club, maybe now is the time to make the change?"
Aleague,376ks4,vendilion,3,Mon May 25 09:09:41 2015 UTC,You're right and I completely agree with you regarding geria and Galloway but I still don't know how we'll cover the loss. Do you remember how bad we looked when Milligan wasn't on the pitch?
Aleague,376ks4,ShrimpinAintEazy,1 point,Mon May 25 09:19:25 2015 UTC,"Yeh agreed, we struggled. Bound to be positives and negatives with Milligan leaving. For once I'm going to be a 'glass half full' guy and say the positives might away the negatives."
Aleague,376ks4,vendilion,1 point,Mon May 25 09:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a skeptic. I'll wait to see how it plays out. I wouldn't be too worried if we had a Visa spot free, but we will struggle with only Aussies available."
Aleague,376ks4,falisimoses,2,Mon May 25 09:33:10 2015 UTC,"There's a massive gap between Finkler-Milligan-Valeri and Finkler-Broxham-Valeri though. I feel like we need a midfield general on that level, Broxham is a great servant and has filled in at times, but he can't be a replacement."
Aleague,376ks4,angel199x,1 point,Mon May 25 09:25:33 2015 UTC,Also who takes the captaincy?   I would be down with Berisha or MDP. Maybe Valeri could do it too.
Aleague,376ks4,ShrimpinAintEazy,2,Mon May 25 09:37:10 2015 UTC,"Oh god this is the conundrum. Musky will probably give it to DJ, lol.  I guess MDP or Valeri would be alright. Berisha is too angry to assume a captaincy, if he loses his temper while in a leadership position it could demoralise the team."
Aleague,376ks4,vendilion,2,Mon May 25 09:39:56 2015 UTC,"Think he'll definitely go this time aka he won't be ""convinced"" to stay. He got his trophies, now the dollars."

ATB Millsy, cheers for the trophies.  I'm looking forward to seeing how Muscat responds to this, he has been fantastic in the transfer market so far.

Aleague,376ks4,Row86,1 point,Mon May 25 09:36:26 2015 UTC,"he's probably too old to play in any top european leagues now, most likely will earn some big bucks and financially secure his family then come back and finish his career here"
Aleague,376ks4,Nos_4r2,0,Mon May 25 11:54:22 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I'm happy for him to go to an EPL side and all, but I don't like this. Why does he have to go to the suckhole of the planet? Complete waste of his prime. He might get paid a lot but nothing he does there will amount to anything. Even the A-League is more significant.  At least we'll get a big fee, right? Also opens a marquee spot. Speaking of which if he's a marquee surely we'd be paying him a buttload anyway right?"
Aleague,376ks4,itisknown__,6,Mon May 25 09:11:16 2015 UTC,we'll get $1mill for him.   Apparently he was on like $250k-$300k per year on a 3 year deal which makes sense if his release clause was $1million. As this means we can replace him with someone else for $250k-$300k on a 3 year deal.
Aleague,376ks4,vendilion,2,Mon May 25 09:28:25 2015 UTC,"He was Aussie marquee, so in theory we can replace him with whatever value if they are Australian."
Aleague,376ks4,littlejib,1 point,Mon May 25 09:32:08 2015 UTC,"The club still has a budget to stick to. What ever we have budgeted for Millsy will most likely be what we budget for whoever replaces him as marquee.  Although if we don't find anyone I think it will be more likely that we move one of our existing players in the marquee position to free up more room to buy someone else under the cap. Vukovic and/or Maclaren perhaps?  EDIT: My maths is messed up. Considering we would have already budgeted to pay Millsy whatever he is getting paid now until 2017, you think we could add that $1mill on top of that for a new player. So $300k per year for 3 years for Millsy could become $600k per year for 3 years for a new player.  But lets be realistic, it will most likely just be distributed to the shareholders."
Aleague,376ks4,Nos_4r2,2,Mon May 25 09:45:42 2015 UTC,I've heard he was on around 700k

Aleague,37595a,rodz7,8,Mon May 25 00:45:08 2015 UTC,Mooy and Brattan should be pushing him out. McKay seems to be one of his favorites though
Aleague,37595a,littlejib,12,Mon May 25 01:00:33 2015 UTC,McKay looked shaky before Asian Cup but he did show up when it counted. Mooy is ahead of Brattan on recent performance. Hopefully Ange looks to rejuvenate the squad for a WC push.
Aleague,37595a,rodz7,2,Mon May 25 01:06:05 2015 UTC,"For one of these i'd like to see a Mooy Brattan Antonis, Lungo midfield four. Would be interesting to see how that works, or any combination of them"
Aleague,37595a,littlejib,-4,Mon May 25 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I remember him giving me repeated heart attacks in the final. Surely Brattan would be ahead of him by now."
Aleague,37595a,vendilion,6,Mon May 25 01:27:12 2015 UTC,They are different types of midfielders than McKay is. The role McKay plays under Ange is the busy midfielder that works as the linking man in the middle. Mooy isn't good in such a role as he wanders out wide and naturally pushes forward. Brattan would struggle in such a role also as he is work rate isn't as high as McKays.  I understand people expect Ange to pick the best players but we should all know by now Ange picks the best players for the roles he needs. I'm all for Mooy and Brattan to be selected but the players they would be replacing is Mooy for Luongo/Troisi and Brattan for Jedi/Milligan.
Aleague,37595a,Rupro_,4,Mon May 25 01:18:44 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but I think you could get those players to adapt to those roles, Mooy could play that role by being a little more disciplined, he has the work rate. Could Ange make it work? Who knows, but it's worth a try in a game like this.   When we play defences that sit back too much McKay doesnt offer the creativity needed to break it down"
Aleague,37595a,littlejib,3,Mon May 25 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that's what Ange is currently doing in training. With more discipline you are right, Mooy could be effective in that role. Milligan is another player that can slot in there though.   Against defensive sides McKay is rather useless and I'd be playing two attacking minded midfielders like Luongo and Troisi.  I'm not sure why Antonis isn't getting much game time but I see him as one of our more complete midfielders and feel he should be earmarked into a role similar to that of McKay. But you Sydney guys see more of him and have a more accurate opinion no doubt."
Aleague,37595a,Rupro_,2,Mon May 25 02:30:53 2015 UTC,"I think Antonis works better as a second DM, he's quality in defense, with his tackles. Not quite with his positioning. His currently role with us isnt really suited to how Ange plays.   When he gets pushed forwards though he is still quite good with his runs, dribbling and passing. I'm always impressed with his ability to look like he is not tracking back, then make a good tackle to regain possession. He should be a bench player for his versatility.  Though he is currently nursing an injury"
Aleague,37595a,littlejib,1 point,Mon May 25 02:39:36 2015 UTC,Perhaps McKay's time playing under Ange at Brisbane is influencing it a bit? Based on recent form I would certainly pick Mooy out of those three.
Aleague,37595a,SerTahu,4,Mon May 25 01:07:41 2015 UTC,"Didn't Mooy go off injured in his last match (and i think even brattan wasn't 100% either), anyone know more about their injuries?"

Aleague,37595a,murseglen,3,Mon May 25 01:00:16 2015 UTC,Both of their minutes and form this past 12 months has been horrible
Aleague,37595a,ShrimpinAintEazy,2,Mon May 25 03:25:16 2015 UTC,Davidson is a ridiculous inclusion if you ask me. You're entirely correct though - and it pisses me off a bit especially since he says you need to be in form to play.
Aleague,37595a,freeriderau,1 point,Mon May 25 03:23:48 2015 UTC,Who does he take over Davidson though?
Aleague,37595a,vendilion,2,Mon May 25 14:40:59 2015 UTC,Big wrap for Elrich. Has he been capped before or is this new because of his recent form?
Aleague,37595a,jonzey,1 point,Mon May 25 01:28:13 2015 UTC,He was capped in the Macedonia game earlier this year.

Aleague,37595a,ShrimpinAintEazy,0,Mon May 25 03:07:44 2015 UTC,Got injured in his last match right? I think he should have been included either way. I dunno why Ange doesn't seem to like him.
Aleague,37595a,suicidal_smrtcar,2,Mon May 25 03:25:24 2015 UTC,Ange isn't going to change things up much for the first qualifier and first competitive match in 6 months. Hopefully they arrange a few more friendlies at the end of the year to test any possible up and comers from the start of next season.

The deal, which could involve Nine gaining first and last rights for the next A-League broadcast contract, would see Nine taking over the SBS portion of the current four-year $160 million contact.  Nine would simulcast a Saturday night game, instead of the Friday night game SBS has been showing, with Fox Sports Australia, though SBS would continue to show Socceroos matches on delay. SBS had rights to the next two World Cups, the 2018 event in Russia and 2022 in Qatar.  The deal is predicated on Fox Sports allowing the switch, given it is paying the bulk of the current rights deal that is halfway through its four-year contract. Fox may be reluctant to give up rights until the current deal expires in two seasons."

Aleague,375i1o,sirhcdobo,5,Mon May 25 02:53:36 2015 UTC,"I believe there are rules in place from FIFA that state that game broadcasts can not be interrupted for ad breaks except at half time and full time. if there are not then i am sure that FFA will have those clauses in the their contract. Im pretty sure that it stops any advertising physical or virtual being displayed on the pitch, or nets.  the commentary is another issue, can just imagine ray warren calling a big blue."
Aleague,375i1o,suicidal_smrtcar,2,Mon May 25 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"I could see Fox being against the switch to 9, as a successful run could see 9 up the ante for the next TV deal.  First and last rights for the next TV negotiation is pretty huge as well."
Aleague,375i1o,freepenguin,2,Mon May 25 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"Football Federation Australia is poised to sign several new sponsors for the next A-League season that will take the organisation's sponsorship income past the $30 million mark and above several rival sports.  Luke Bould, FFA's head of commercial told The Australian Financial Review that the incoming sponsors will be in new categories created to capitalise on the A-League's increasing popularity.  ""We'll also have at least two Australian companies that are already sponsors re-sign at levels that are significant multiples to the deals that are on now,"" he said.  ""We're being strategic in how we're approaching potential partners and telling them the particular strengths that football has.""  Bould last week told Sponsorship News FFA has posted a 30 per cent increase in commercial revenue and will go ahead of the Australian Rugby Union's $28.7 million and NRL's $27 million sponsorship income.  WIDESPREAD APPEAL  He said FFA has particularly focused on telling potential sponsors about the sport's widespread appeal at grassroots level, where it has signed insurance brand AIA Vitality as a sponsor of the mini-roos junior program.  ""We've also been told from two sources, [research and consultancy firms] Gemba and Octagon, that football is the number one sport in the 19-26 age category, so we think we have a good story when you partner that with families via the grassroots programs.""   Digital advertising will be particularly important given the demographic that is most interested in the A-league, Bould said, noting that Telstra re-entering football as a partner could also be a precursor to a future digital broadcast rights deal.  Meanwhile, FFA is understood to be attempting to engineer a deal with Nine Entertainment Co for a portion of the A-League broadcast rights from the 2015-16 season onwards.   The deal, which could involve Nine gaining first and last rights for the next A-League broadcast contract, would see Nine taking over the SBS portion of the current four-year $160 million contact.

If we can get the clubs finances healthy again, there shouldn't be any problems. Additional investors will also dilute the absolute power Bakries exercise and introduce new and better ideas for community engagement and the club as a whole. Hopefully we can get a proactive and energetic manager with a decent head on his shoulders, some fresh coaching staff and a better outlook for next season. It's going to be a lot of work in the off season, but as long as the players focus on their game and not the turmoil we should hopefully come out if this okay."

You could see his desire to play for us at the end of the season was gone. I dont blame him to be honest. Cheers Sagey. If we sign Nathan fucking Coe I will lose my shit.   Jaime Maclaren showed he's one of the best young Australian striker last season. Whoever gets him is extremely fortunate. He could play in Europe one day. Why we continued playing Paljic the slow German cunt over Maclaren i'll never know. Kenny really does make some daft decisions.  Now Golec. Fucking hell. What an uninspired signing. He offers nothing new to the side. I'd prefer Woodcock or we couldve kept Davies as cover for fullback.

Aleague,36zixf,vendilion,3,Sun May 24 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"Why is this narrative always being brought up from SFC fans? You're the ones who have Janko, Ogenovski, Smeltz, Ibini, Brosque, Gameiro, Carle and Antonis on the same list.  We have to resort to having players like Ansell and Broxham in our back four, and using players like Pain, Mahazi and Makarounas off the bench. Our depth isn't as good as outsiders say it is.  I don't actually know what our cap looks like but I do know that FBK recently took a pay cut to stay with the team. Individuals like Kosta, Valeri, Thompson, Geria, Delpierre and Thomas can't be on too much in a relative sense. It's only Finkler that is probably on a sizable contract at this stage.

Aleague,36ynar,vendilion,2,Sat May 23 07:26:27 2015 UTC,He's 37. This will flop if it happens. But it's a beat up. I remember we were hunting a marquee after Ange joined and almost every single player in Europe was cited as being in talks with us.
Aleague,36ynar,wanderingrhino,2,Sat May 23 15:49:41 2015 UTC,"I dunno, he's been a gun in his 30's, and with the amount of chances AU generate, it could be a good combo"

Aleague,36ylni,vendilion,3,Sat May 23 05:29:11 2015 UTC,"He definitely stepped up and looked like he wanted to cement his place. I think he's earned that. Sad for Coe but I think Lawrence has more upside, he's finally shown what we were starting to think would never happen. If he starts struggling we can always sign another keeper. This is how Coe joined the club in the first place."

And best wishes to Thomas as well, I think we were a little jittery when he had to come in and replace Nate so close to the play-offs. But I think he's proven himself, keeping clean sheets for us through the semi and grand finals was no easy feat. His aerial saves were really great to watch!  I guess time goes on and people move on.

Coe has been up and down, not sure how much he was on but surely we can get a better keeper.  Thomas has done well in his last few games so I'm not too fussed if he's our new #1 but at the same time wouldn't be upset it we got a new keeper.    Now we need to get Georgievski signed up and hopefully Archie as well, if he's going to play one more year he might as well do it here."

First off they just kick the ball into their own net 5 times, because obviously according to the rules once a team is 5-0 down they are allowed to pick the ball up with their hands as a fair-play gesture. With the advantage of using their hands Adelaide united create the old sea-eagle formation (this should work extremely well considering Villareal use their trademarked beaver formation, and if you know anything about wild-life you'd know sea-eagle beats beaver). Yugi Mutou (Adelaide United's keeper) then uses his Morgan Freeman card to beat Naruto's (Villareal's keeper) Micheal Jackson card this leaving Villareal paralyzed for 89 minutes.   /s I don't know where I was going with this, have fun at the game :p"

I wouldn't bother with a gold and just general admin unless you want to sit in the grandstand under the cover. Always buy online before as its about $5-$10 cheaper. it also means you don't have to line up for tickets. Just print of the ticket and take it up to the gate and scan it. If you buy them at the gate give yourself at least 20 mins before the game is set to start, especially cause the line up gets longer the closer it gets to the game. I heard that there are limited tickets left but not sure about how true that is.  As for seating most people tend to sit on the sides but I've always sat on the south end at hindmarsh in the second tier. I find sitting behind the goals allows you to watch the game and play unfold better plus the stands are close enough that you're still really close to the play. Plus the video screen is on the north side, so you don't have to crane your neck. The only downside in summer is the sun in your eyes at certain times but shouldn't matter at this time of year."

You can get an ezyticket which you just print out and you scan it at the gates.  General admission is good, and if you have a GA ticket you can sit wherever you want in the GA areas.  I usually arrive 45-60 minutes before kickoff. You get to watch the players warm up and everything.  You can expect a pretty tame contest (considering it's a friendly game and no one wants to get injured) but there will definitely be some good football on show.  I don't think I've ever seen one of these big teams come over and not score goals. I wouldn't be surprised if Adelaide pocket one either.  As for the atmosphere it'll also be pretty tame in comparison, there's no rivalry between these two teams like there is between A-League teams. You may still find it to be good compared to an AFL game or Cricket game (I dunno if you've been to other sports before).  I hope you enjoy the game, and continue to go to the football in Adelaide in the future.   Who knows? We might have just witnessed the birth of the leader of Adelaide United's newest hardcore casuals firm."
Aleague,36sohz,_SUGARFLAPS_,11,Thu May 21 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"Some key points:   when you look at the books, trade, tax and payroll liabilities total more than $4.5 million.  there’s a tax bill of almost $2.5 million  Payroll liabilities are $1.4million, including about $790,000 in unpaid super.    (This is crazy as it is potentially guaranteed by directors.  Inc  bankruptcies).   history shows that the ultimate outcome is likely to be liquidation, with a zero cents in the dollar return   Ok - just giving my professional overview (CA by trade).  The article does not state who the director is but the sole shareholder is Nathan Tinkler.  Tinkler has loaned the Jets $14.9M (most likely unsecured but if smart he would have secured it).  The ATO had a permanent garnishee on their account.  Now this is interesting indeed.  IF it goes into liquidation the liquidator will most likely determine any payment taken by the ATO (recently) under the garnishee as a preference payment and reclaim that money from the ATO.  Then pass this on to cover their cost and pay employees some of the $.  That super liability is insane.  The $2.5M tax bill would include large sums of PAYGW.  Now that is technically payable by the director/s.  I expect ASIC to send directors notices in the coming days which = big problems.  ASIC also has the power to go after the shot caller (Tinkler) even if he was not the director.  Any other questions shoot!"

Aleague,36qsi7,wanderingrhino,6,Thu May 21 11:34:06 2015 UTC,"Scottish Premier League club Dundee United have confirmed club chairman Stephen Thompson has been in talks with the Newcastle Jets after the A-League club had its licence revoked.  The club said Thompson was acting in his capacity as part of a consortium. ""Dundee United is not involved in talks with the Newcastle Jets, this is a personal venture for the chairman as part of a consortium. Any involvement of Mr Thompson in this or any other venture is entirely his prerogative and the board, which he remains fully committed to, is focused purely on Dundee United FC delivering a positive end to the season and building for next season.""  The talks followed Nathan Tinkler's messy break-up with the A-League club. Tinkler's Hunter Sports Group licence to own the club has been revoked by Football Federation Australia, who will own and control the Jets' new licence.  Thompson is understood to have been involved in talks with both Tinkler and the FFA about buying the Jets. Tinkler said Wednesday Dundee were offering $5m for the club and a deal was imminent.  Advertisement  But the FFA's decision to strip Tinkler of the ownership licence sidelines him from any sale.  FFA chief David Gallop Gallop said talks with several interested parties would continue.  The FFA moved on Newcastle after Tinkler on Wednesday placed the club into voluntary administration with debts of $2.7 million.  Gallop and Tinkler have been at odds throughout a turbulent season at Newcastle, who finished last on the ladder with just three wins. The on-field woes were compounded when Tinkler sacked seven players in January, further riling the FFA, who were already upset at club finances.  Tinkler purchased the Jets' licence in 2010, and a year later assumed ownership of the Newcastle Knights rugby league club. In June last year, the NRL took back control of the Knights.   Head of the A-League Damien de Bohun defended the actions of the FFA, saying they had no choice but to strip control of the Jets from Tinkler.  De Bohun, in Newcastle for a crisis meeting with staff at the beleaguered franchise, was strong in the face of veiled threats from Tinkler in the media on Thursday.  ""Our goal will be to have a new owner and chairman in place by the start of next season,"" De Bohun said.  ""All I know is when staff and players haven't been paid we have no choice but to act the way we have.""  De Bohun did have good news for the players and staff though, insisting they would be looked after.  The 15 players currently contracted to the Jets have all been offered new contracts.  The FFA has guaranteed those staff who were not paid, will be.  ""Today is a fresh start for the Newcastle Jets and football in NSW,"" De Bohun said.  ""Yesterday afternoon FFA revoked the licence of the Newcastle Jets and today we have been meeting with all the staff.  ""We made a number of important decisions today, the most important being that all the players will be provided with like-for-like contracts and the staff who were not paid last week will have their obligations met for the next month.""  While the players have been kept on and the staff paid for now, the coaches face a different path as the FFA undertakes a large-scale review of the club's operations.  ""The coaching staff are still employed by Hunter Sports Group, they're not coming across at this point,"" De Bohun said. Head coach Phil Stubbins was only given a lukewarm endorsement by de Bohun.

Aleague,36qsi7,Brisbanealchemist,2,Thu May 21 11:42:56 2015 UTC,Seems reasonable...  I don't think that Stubbins impressed anyone?
Aleague,36qsi7,PorkHunt,4,Thu May 21 12:38:09 2015 UTC,Getting rid of Stubbins is the best way for the FFA to start this new era right and get the people of Newcastle back onside. Keep him and no one will take an interest.
Aleague,36qsi7,Brisbanealchemist,2,Thu May 21 12:49:39 2015 UTC,I agree... The fiasco with Carney and the others left him with zero credibility in my eyes.  Sack him and find someone else.
Aleague,36qsi7,_SUGARFLAPS_,1 point,Thu May 21 13:07:07 2015 UTC,It would be pretty hard to call it a fresh start with the Muppet still in charge.   Can anyone think of any half decent coaches that are available?
Aleague,36qsi7,Walkerthon,3,Thu May 21 13:09:35 2015 UTC,Rudan? I'd say he's keen to spread his wings in the A-League
Aleague,36qsi7,PorkHunt,2,Fri May 22 01:30:57 2015 UTC,Mulvey? I'm not entirely sure what happened up in Brisbane to lead to his sacking but the Roar fans may have some insight.

They're in the Group of Death, including the US, Sweden and Nigeria. This should be a fantastic group for them to be in and they have a better than 50% chance of surviving. It's looking like being a really good World Cup.  Another thing I never thought I'd say?  ""This tournament probably needs North Korea"".  This really is shaping up to be one of the best Women's World Cups ever."
Aleague,36qqw3,FootballBallsack,1 point,Thu May 21 11:37:00 2015 UTC,"My gues is that they are looking to play some of the weaker nations (no offense to vietnam) as a way to gain confidence and fine tune their play style.   i'm hoping they have a couple of harder friendly's, they'll need to be able to step up at the world cup. They're in for a really tough ask at the world cup, it's an insanely tough group."

Tavares, who joined the Sky Blues as an injury replacement player in January 2015, will remain with Sydney FC for the 2015/16 and 2016/17 Hyundai A-League seasons.  The 32 year old made his first appearance for the Sky Blues against the Central Coast Mariners in a 5-1 win before establishing himself as a key member of Graham Arnold's midfield, making a total of 12 starts for 924 minutes of playing time.   Sydney FC Head Coach Graham Arnold praised Tavares work ethic and impact during the second half of the season as key reasons for retaining the holding midfielder.  ""Mickael is a quality player and his attitude and application since he arrived in January have been fantastic,"" Arnold said.  ""He has fitted seamlessly into our club and the quality he's shown on the pitch has left me in no doubt about his importance to the team.  ""I'm looking forward to working with Mickael for the next two years as we take on Asia in the Champions League and look to build on our record breaking 2014/15 season.""  The former Fulham and Hamburger SV player said he was delighted to be remaining at the Sky Blues for the next two years as he set his sights on winning the Hyundai A-League and progressing in Asia.  ""Sydney FC is a big club and I'm really happy to be staying with the Sky Blues,"" Tavares said.  ""I want to win trophies with Sydney FC and I believe we can compete for titles in the A-League and Asian Champions League.  ""I'm grateful to Arnie and the club for showing faith in me and I already can't wait for next season to begin."""

Aleague,36orr7,FootballBallsack,12,Wed May 20 23:00:02 2015 UTC,We're sorry :(
Aleague,36orr7,trollshep,5,Wed May 20 23:17:19 2015 UTC,I really hope that Dundee United's board members can come along and purchase the remains of the club from Tinkler and be allowed a license. That's the best outcome by a long shot.  The FFA just needs to not make potential investors jump through a million and one hoops before getting that license.
Aleague,36orr7,DRJay21,9,Wed May 20 23:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. I kind of hope they rebuild the club as a new entity, I personally wouldn't mind a change from the Jets name but I know that might have a negative effect on the general public's interest, but there's been such a sour taste in recent years that I at least hope we change strip from the red/blue. The Hunter Ports Era has been nothing but shit in all aspects of the club."
Aleague,36orr7,nerv2004,4,Wed May 20 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you lose the fans who identify with the Jets name and have a four year old home shirt that they wear to the yearly match they attend. These are fans that you need to keep aswell and a new entity quite possibly won't.  Why do a lot of you guys on Reddit hate the red and blue? I think it looks a lot better than the kinda bland gold, personally."
Aleague,36orr7,trollshep,3,Wed May 20 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand that, I've been wearing my red/blue since Hunter Ports stepped in and the Jets name has been the most I've followed Newcastle football, with only very minimal memories of the Newcastle United days since i was very young. It's definitely a testing time for such an already divided region, I know quite a few friends who have given up on the team due to the shambles recently.  I think it's mostly nostalgia, the gold was what I see as the glory days of the club so far, back when the squadron was packed every week by the big uni crowd and the team was just exciting. The sea of gold is just a unique sort of image as I see it, and the red/blue was sort of to me seen as ""hey you know the Knights right? Guess what you're going to look like them"". It definitely looks better as a jersey, but I miss the charm of the gold."
Aleague,36orr7,AussieApathy,2,Thu May 21 00:16:49 2015 UTC,I regret not buying a gold strip. But at the time I was only in high school.
Aleague,36orr7,PooDiePie,2,Thu May 21 00:18:11 2015 UTC,They are still around.  There is a store just around the corner from me that has the old gold top from 2010 I believe.
Aleague,36orr7,SerTahu,1 point,Thu May 21 03:20:07 2015 UTC,ebay?
Aleague,36orr7,wanderingrhino,2,Thu May 21 04:53:42 2015 UTC,The reason why the majority of the jets support hate the red and blue strip is because tinkler wanted the jets to wear the same colour as the knights. I believe he did this to try and attract the knights supporters.
Aleague,36orr7,Steelinho,1 point,Thu May 21 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"I would be open to it, mainly because I know a lot of other fans would want to see that. Also, at least with the gold we are distinct from the Knights.  I don't hate the red/blue, but at the same time I'm not attached to it."
Aleague,36orr7,rezplzk,11,Thu May 21 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think the issues in Perth and Newcastle are indicators that Australian football is stepping back. They're just consequences of individual greed.  Wellington is a bit of an issue, and I'll be disappointed if they aren't given a new license, (so will Ernie Merrick, who signed a contract longer than the club's license lol), but the outcome of this is yet to be revealed, so for the moment let's focus on what we know.  Let's be realistic here, the Jets won't be forced to disband, they're too much of a major stakeholder in the league to just demolish and try and start again. They'll offer all the players and staff new contracts, and those that accept will continue to build upon what the club already had. Whether they change their name or colours or whatever, it doesn't matter, they'll still be the continuation of the old Newcastle Jets.  They could do something like they did at Wanderers to give the club a bit of a kick-start, like extra cap space or more foreign player slots. (This is probably the reason wanderers were premiers in their first season lol.)  The FFA taking the license back is what many Jets fans have wanted to happen for the past few months now.  The measures put in place in the past to be able to solve these situations in the future have worked. The way the FFA has dealt with these problems has been pretty solid, except Perth probably should have been knocked to last place.  These things can't be helped, so instead let's focus on the things that can be helped, such as expansion of the league, improving the football, more international exposure, and going on to win more overseas.  Who knows? In a few years' time the Jets could find themselves in an ACL final after beating Canberra United in the A-League Grand Final a few months earlier, broadcasted in over 200 nations (and Live on Australian FTA). Meanwhile, Drogba and Sydney FC win the FFA Cup and the A-League Premiership only to be knocked out of the finals by the rampaging Canberra United, who only the week before beat South Coast Wolves on their home soil, making it into the Grand Final from 6th spot on the A-League table."
Aleague,36orr7,RockheadRumple,2,Thu May 21 01:07:35 2015 UTC,That last paragraph made me happy :P
Aleague,36orr7,PooDiePie,4,Thu May 21 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"What are you basing some of your assumptions on.  ie. jets youth being disbanded?  I have read in a lot of places that the club is now being controlled by the FFA, they have the licence,  players will be paid,  contacts renewed etc."
Aleague,36orr7,rodz7,1 point,Thu May 21 03:22:34 2015 UTC,"Should the FFA bail and recreate the team from scratch. This was written prior to Gallop's comments today that the club will stay with its name and colours.  Still though, as much as Tinkler broke a vital rule with the club, I feel as though he may still have a leg to stand on as the owner, should this inevitably go legal."
Aleague,36orr7,PooDiePie,2,Thu May 21 10:16:56 2015 UTC,"Due to the Jets' disbandment, this brings the number of ""Australian"" clubs in the AFC's eyes down to 8, as the Wellington Phoenix aren't eligible. Because of this, Australia would only be entitled to have two Champions League clubs, which in turn would see Adelaide United penalised thanks to Newcastle's demise. This would be extremely unacceptable, but sadly, this is potentially a ridiculous thing that I can see the AFC doing under the voting power of the federations that want us out of the AFC.   Just to clarify, this isn't how the AFC Champions League qualification slots work. They're based on Member Association (MA) rankings, rather than what you're suggesting (voting?), and 2016 was determined at the same time as 2015, pending club licencing approvals based on meeting specific practice standards. Those standards will be met by all three clubs unless something happens to them directly, meaning Adelaide United are not penalised at this point in time.   Subsequently, the National Premier League NNSW has the Newcastle Jets Youth club playing. Should the FFA not allow Tinkler to retain his ownership for him to sell the club off to a buyer such as Dundee United, they too would have to disband, which would leave fixture issues within the NNSW.   The FFA revoked and terminated the licence. The team itself, from the senior players and staff all the way down to any other operating entities, such as youth teams, are now operated by the FFA until the licence has been re-issued to another entity, be it Dundee United, a local consortium or any other investors. No fixture issues for local leagues and Tinkler no longer has any influence or involvement with the licence. Entirely up to the FFA at this stage.  We've had this exact same situation multiple times, including when the FFA revoked the same licence from Con Constantine. It doesn't guarantee we'll have a team in Newcastle, but the FFA's stated aim is to keep the licence within the Hunter region."
Aleague,36orr7,rodz7,1 point,Thu May 21 07:49:24 2015 UTC,"Australia ""dropping"" a club and having only 8 would see us only entitled to 2 slots, not 3 as an association isn't allowed to have more than 1/3rd of its clubs playing in the CL. This is what I could see creating a misinterpretation in the rules and a potential vote over what to do next. As corrupt as the AFC is, they're still probably more democratic than FIFA, and that's saying something."
Aleague,36orr7,PooDiePie,2,Thu May 21 10:05:14 2015 UTC,"But the A-League is perfect it doesn't have the same challenges the NSL faced; like lack of funding, bad businessmen and threats from other sports.  The A-League is perfect."

Personally I know David is a super lovely guy and sport fanatic - and all I have been hearing from forums anyway is resign Thompson, letting covic go was a mistake and Newcastle is a mess. I love how passionate people are about the league but getting too defensive is unhealthy. Nothing in this world is perfect and criticism is healthy and will help the league grow.

Aleague,36le6h,TheFightingImp,18,Wed May 20 11:25:43 2015 UTC,"Is this a good bit of business by FFA?   Fat Tinkler buys license for ~5mil Tinks fucks up, Jets are 2.7 mil in debt FFA cancel license and takes the club back Sell club to new owners on the condition that they pay all existing debts + licensing fee   Seems like the FFA have sold the license twice without costing themselves much - this is all based on the assumption that the club can be sold quickly and the FFA is not forced to hold onto it for too long."
Aleague,36le6h,ShrimpinAintEazy,8,Wed May 20 06:38:09 2015 UTC,"I actually have a feeling reading the statement that the FFA won't owe didly squat in terms of the debts . Whilst their license for the A league has been terminated, the company known as Newcastle jets football operation pty ltd still exists. That means that all the debts owed by Newcastle still belong to this company. The new jets entity owned by the FFA won't carry any of these debts."
Aleague,36le6h,suicidal_smrtcar,4,Wed May 20 07:06:31 2015 UTC,Jesus. It would be amazing if they could get out of this and leave Tinkler with the debt.
Aleague,36le6h,Mello-D,4,Wed May 20 07:18:34 2015 UTC,The receivers will be left with the debt.  Not Tinkler.  What is important though is who the directors are - they are liable for player taxes and superannuation.
Aleague,36le6h,rezplzk,1 point,Wed May 20 13:04:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know enough about company law to understand how that would work, but entirely possible I guess.   In your scenario you're saying that the debt is till with Tinks/HSG?  That means that the players would have to sue to get their super? I don't think the FFA or PFA would think that is a decent arrangement."
Aleague,36le6h,ShrimpinAintEazy,6,Wed May 20 07:34:06 2015 UTC,Accountant by trade - I can explain the actual legalities for all if it helps.  Basically whoever the directors were will be lumped with PAYGW tax and superannuation liabilites personally if they haven't been paid.  The other debts will be funded by whatever the company can liquidate and turn into cash.  If Tinks is smart he would have had all the assets of the club in a separate entity thus quarantining them (that's how normal business people rock but the FFA may have not liked that).
Aleague,36le6h,rezplzk,5,Wed May 20 13:07:15 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Tinks (specifically his company) retains the debt but FFA take the only real asset: the license to operate a football team in the HAL.
Aleague,36le6h,anappropriatename,2,Wed May 20 11:17:56 2015 UTC,Thats awesome. Well played FFA.
Aleague,36le6h,ShrimpinAintEazy,5,Wed May 20 11:21:21 2015 UTC,"The debts would be HSG's, and wouldn't be taken over by the new entity."
Aleague,36le6h,effsee,4,Wed May 20 07:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah as its a new licence with ""new"" players (current players are all offered contracts) so I'd imagine tinks keeps the debt"
Aleague,36le6h,sexshepard91,2,Wed May 20 08:02:17 2015 UTC,I think its pretty much this. Tink has lost a big asset (the licence) but the company still exists and still has obligations to pay its debt (though its in hands of the administrators to see if that can be done now)
Aleague,36le6h,shitidiotturtle,4,Wed May 20 10:59:42 2015 UTC,Interesting. I imagine the ffas evaluation will be different to tinkers. I suppose they could pay the 2.7 debt now and run the club before selling it for 2.7 plus committed expenditure? FFA don't need to turn a profit like tinker and would probably rather the new owners put more investment in the club anyway.
Aleague,36le6h,nerv2004,6,Wed May 20 07:02:38 2015 UTC,Now they have the license I'm hoping that the jets will get some stability. Ever since tinkler took over the club it's been nothing but trouble.
Aleague,36le6h,trollshep,3,Wed May 20 06:43:33 2015 UTC,Ever since tinkler took over   tinkler has managed to make con look like a model of professionalism
Aleague,36le6h,shitidiotturtle,6,Wed May 20 11:00:48 2015 UTC,"I heard someone on the radio this morning saying that the FFA need to seriously look at whether the current A-League format is viable, suggesting that there may be too many teams, particularly to support private ownership of teams.  Maybe its time the FFA went away and had a good think about whether the game is in such a good state as they like to say..."
Aleague,36le6h,bacco007,4,Wed May 20 08:18:43 2015 UTC,"The guy on the radio was either an idiot or being sensationalist. With the exception of the Mariners and Jets (who have both proved in past seasons that they are capable pulling 10k+ average attendances) crowds are healthy, and the quality of the league is steadily improving. FTA networks have expressed their interest and a deal with one of them from 2017/18, which would see a substantial increase in the money coming in from tv rights, is very likely. The only real problem at the moment is with the owners of some of the clubs being complete arseholes.  Speaking of owners, if the Manchester City deal with the Heart and current Dundee United interest in the Jets is anything to go by then ownership from foreign clubs could (and in my opinion should) be an avenue that is explored more in the future, especially for some of the smaller teams in the league cough Mariners cough."
Aleague,36le6h,SerTahu,2,Wed May 20 08:46:07 2015 UTC,Not all about crowds though.  All clubs except Victory made another loss last year.  That's not healthy.
Aleague,36le6h,rezplzk,2,Wed May 20 13:08:38 2015 UTC,I remember reading a few years ago that over 90% of Australian professional sport clubs run on a loss.   Australia has a huge amount of professional sport clubs per capita when you compare it to the rest of the world.

Even though Nike is the name of a Greek goddess.   There may be some contractual reason why a Newcastle Jets trademark isn't owned by HSG. But that's totally down to whatever arrangements are made FFA and the team owners. You can be sure someone owns a Newcastle Jets trademark. The only question is who."

Aleague,36le6h,effsee,1 point,Wed May 20 06:37:24 2015 UTC,I believe so. They've had that name since they joined the NSL (2000 if memory serves correctly). I would be surprised if someone changed it.
Aleague,36le6h,ShrimpinAintEazy,5,Wed May 20 06:40:39 2015 UTC,They were just Newcastle United under Con in the NSL. Jets was added as part of the HAL bid.

Aleague,36le6h,sirhcdobo,3,Wed May 20 12:18:20 2015 UTC,"From what I read, Dundee had been in talks with the FFA as well, about buying the Jets I believe. So it might end up that FFA don't need to run the club, rather give Dundee a license to operate a club out of Newcastle.   The concern I have is, are all the staff/players who have contracts with the Jets automatically released, or are they stuck with Tinkler? Also how exactly are the FFA supposed to pay out the staff/players. and cover the missed superannuation payments, From insurance, or from the profits of the Asian cup?   Surely missed Super payments are actually a legal issue, in which case, surely Tinkler can be charged by Police?)?"
Aleague,36le6h,freeriderau,2,Wed May 20 07:35:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if there is a mysterious payment from the FFA to the HSG to cover debts incurred. Probably with a NDA to ensure things are kept quiet and that the payment is used to come ALeague debts.   You can't have owners complaining about massive debts incurred with licenses revoked so they can not make back the cash. That would deter future investors
Aleague,36le6h,ScreamHawk,1 point,Wed May 20 08:14:49 2015 UTC,There's not a lot anyone can really do about failed super once they go into administration.

Aleague,36le6h,vendilion,5,Wed May 20 09:37:27 2015 UTC,"The takeover was triggered because Tinkler went into voluntary administration. Basically, he broke the terms for holding a club licence. Ergo Tinkler doesn't have a leg to stand on. You're sweet."
Aleague,36le6h,trollshep,2,Wed May 20 10:57:27 2015 UTC,The question here is: Will they have to find a new stadium? Doesn't Tinks own the one they use at the moment?
Aleague,36le6h,vendilion,5,Wed May 20 07:06:59 2015 UTC,Tinkler doesn't own the stadium. If he did the knights would also need to find a new ground.

Kind of related: when the Jets switched back to their original colours, why didn't they keep the gold as their away Kit?"
Aleague,36le6h,_SUGARFLAPS_,5,Wed May 20 07:39:39 2015 UTC,"Jets HAL foundation colour. But Newcastle United wore R&B yes. Also no one knows, that's just the Tinks way"
Aleague,36le6h,shitidiotturtle,2,Wed May 20 07:48:11 2015 UTC,I'm not big on the gold personally. I'd prefer the green and brown as the home kit and the nnsw black and white (away kit a few years ago) as away.   I didn't follow the a league until about the '09 season though so i don't really have an attachment to the gold.
Aleague,36le6h,chrisbit,1 point,Wed May 20 09:45:16 2015 UTC,"green and brown is good, but I think enough people still think of the jets as gold (all my jets gear is gold) that it should go back to gold  its also a symbolic end to tinkler, back to the good old days etc"

Although it's good that they've reclaimed the licence, the wording of this has me rather worried that they're willing to abandon the Jets name and history altogether. If that is the case, it would really send the message that all the clubs in the league are replaceable, which would leave a very bitter taste in my mouth. Maybe it's the sentimental side of my speaking, but I think that would be an even greater tragedy than Tinkler's mismanagemt.  Even if it was a team I hate, like the Victory, in this situation, I would both expect and demand that the FFA do all in their power to at least keep the club's name alive. For the same reason if they ever return to the Gold Coast or Auckland I am strongly of the opinion that they should revive the GCU or Knights brands, respectively."

Ticket sales are one part of the equation. Concessions, stadium revenue, parking and more are just as important.  I don't know what the revenue split is when you're playing in a stadium owned by the government, but I would be surprised if it's 100% or anywhere close to it.  That kind of revenue adds up...and if you can't make up a shortage in cash with things like sponsorship or advertisements... ticket prices will have to increase."

Aleague,36ohde,Mello-D,8,Wed May 20 21:47:33 2015 UTC,He broke an obligation for holding a license.

Magic Mike has had a full preseason with the squad and brought in some of his own flavour. The signings of Miller and McKay, whilst letting go some deadwood (looking at you Mitch), have brought some balance back to a team that struggled to do anything good last season.  Verdict  1st  This season depends on the start. Brisbane Roar have not been gifted the easiest run by the FFA gods, so it is up to them to prove a point. If the Roar start well, and start big, and are able to avoid serious injuries, Brisbane could be a serious contender for the double. Credit to u/falisimoses for writing this great post[1] ."

Aleague,36kzp1,kizzap,3,Wed May 20 03:59:02 2015 UTC,It sort of is from a risk perspective?  If he pays and loses the licence he just sinks money into an asset he doesn't own and can not recoup on.
Aleague,36kzp1,rezplzk,2,Wed May 20 05:00:42 2015 UTC,Looks like it. Simply protecting his fat ass for whatever cash he can get out of paying really. Will just pass these wages on as debts the club owes to the new owner.  He must be seriously hard up for cash.
Aleague,36kzp1,ShrimpinAintEazy,2,Wed May 20 05:16:27 2015 UTC,Nah he won't do that.  He will pay it so he retains ownership then sell and keep the profit most likely.  This is some of the issues when business and sport connect.  Business man are exactly that.  They don't care about players/coaches or the supporters etc.  They care about cash.    Look at Newcastle United in the UK.  Bring back member owned clubs already.  Franchises OUT.
Aleague,36kzp1,rezplzk,1 point,Wed May 20 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"AFAIK - Tinkler's company owes the wages. The fact he doesn't want to pay because he may not have a lisc tomorrow is immaterial, his business has contractual obligations.  All ('all') FFA have done is strip the license from that company, that doesn't mean the debt vanishes. Nothing changes aside from the fact that his organization may no longer  play in the HAL. The fact he shifted things into voluntary admin indicates (IMHO) he's trying to get out, rather than acting in good faith.  if Tinkler can do a deal transferring the assets and club infrastructure to a new owner, he might be able to parcel the debt with it, but it's just as likely that a new owner will consider that they might want to start from scratch in which case the PFA and players will have to take the company to court. In practice, FFA will probably try negotiate something out (since it's in their interest to resolve this too) but yes, it doesn't have to."

When a company can no longer pay it's debts a director's duty is to identify they are insolvent and put them into VA.   the PFA and players will have to take the company to court   Take them to court for what?  That's not how business law works in Australia."
Aleague,36kzp1,rezplzk,1 point,Wed May 20 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"Not technically correct. When a company can no longer pay it's debts a director's duty is to identify they are insolvent and put them into VA.   Technically, yep, but I was more referring to the quote : ""I've been in negotiations with the FFA over the last few days and wasn't able to get them to guarantee the licence and I haven't been willing to pay wages unless they guaranteed that so I've put the club into administration just now"".     Take them to court for what?   I presume it's going to be messy but my understanding is that VA provisions apply going forwards but that there's still scope for proceedings (depending on how everyone was employed of course). Happy to be corrected since last time I dealt with this was about 6 years ago and somewhat peripherally within my portfolio."
Aleague,36kzp1,tanantish,2,Thu May 21 01:59:43 2015 UTC,Remember if you are in Tinkler's position;  if he could have sold the licence for $5M he would have been better off paying the wages/debts as a loan.  Then selling and keeping the balance.  There is limited scope.  Who are they going to sue?  The entity?  The VA will do nothing as the season is over and there is no revenue.  Now no licence.  A liquidator will be appointed and assets sold.  Maybe some players get some cents in the dollar.   Under commercial law I am pretty sure they can not go after the directors unless the FFA licence has some personal guarantees in there.  I would be suprised if Tinkler would sign something like that but he could have.
Aleague,36kzp1,rezplzk,1 point,Thu May 21 04:50:02 2015 UTC,"See, the thing is I don't think Tinkler's an idiot per se, but I don't think he's particularly good from a strategic aspect.   Not being a licensee (and I don't know if any of the conditions are really public) I don't know what conditions there are on transfer but I suspect that it requires FFA approval at a minimum. For a viable club, with a lot of non-license assets (existing contracts with stadiums, facilities, ancillary staff, all that ops stuff, and a strong name) I could see a deal like that being cut. Esp if there were two teams in town you'd want to engineer a smooth transition instead of risking fans deserting but in Newcastle? Tinkler has pretty much cut out all his leverage (in the same way the license can't be handed back, I'm sure it can't be revoked without cause) by going to VA and losing the single most important thing you need run a team in the HAL.  Basically - I don't think he had any realistic chance of doing a deal for $5m and he was aware of it. He may not realized why he was in such a poor position or how to manage the situation mind.   There is limited scope. Who are they going to sue? The entity? The VA will do nothing as the season is over and there is no revenue. Now no licence. A liquidator will be appointed and assets sold. Maybe some players get some cents in the dollar.   My reading of the VA was that any costs going forwards would be made by the administrator out of club assets, but that the players would become unsecured creditors and pretty low on the chain. However, ignoring any issue of them potentially trading while insolvent which is a whole other kettle of fish, I didn't think VA gave unlimited protection from players seeking remedy for a breach of contract (I'm reading this as a breach of the CBA), just a moratorium so the administrator can organize things. Like I said, I don't know enough about what's the internal structuring etc, so speculation and all based on one read of things."
Aleague,36kzp1,tanantish,1 point,Thu May 21 13:09:56 2015 UTC,I agree with all those things except employees actually rank 2nd on the liquidator list of people who get paid!  They are not unsecured creditors which is nice/a protection for them ordinarily.

Aleague,36k1kp,Mello-D,1 point,Tue May 19 23:28:45 2015 UTC,The FFA definitely should be adopting a take no bullshit approach with these ownership issues. Letting these rich assholes own clubs as their playthings is doing a lot of damage to the sport in this country.

Aleague,36k1kp,ShrimpinAintEazy,3,Tue May 19 23:58:57 2015 UTC,I think the distributed ownership/board model is the only way to go. At least it spreads the risk.

But the truth is there is in fact a problem. A minority, yes but it still needs to be addressed, not ignored.  Idiots lighting flares in the streets and wearing balaclavas is completely stupid and is not helping the games reputation. It just doesn't fly in a country like ours.  Wannabe hools who pine for the hardcore ultra bullshit they see overseas are living in a dream world. It will never be accepted here, nor should it be.  I'm all for tifo's, flags, banners, chants etc, giving it to the opposition and all that, even swearing. No problem at all. I can get fired up and sweary as much as the next person. That's what going to the football and supporting your team is all about - which is why the South End at Victory games is so much fun.   But this self indulgent crap we see from some section of supporters, particularly here in Melbourne is not getting us anywhere. A banner featuring balaclava-clad fans? Really? If they didn't expect a reaction from that, they're having a laugh. And then to turn up to the pre-game march at the Grand Final actually wearing balaclavas and hiding your face? Ridiculous! I've said it a million times and I'll say it again. You can't complain about restrictions and your own reputation being damaged if you continue with this crap. It's quite simple.

Aleague,36g0vb,wanderingrhino,12,Tue May 19 07:36:34 2015 UTC,"Here in Adelaide we have the ""FLB"" or ""Front Line Boys"". These 'kids' age between 13 to 18 (maybe a couple over 20), and came about to Adel. Utd home games in the past season or so. They literally have no passion for the game or the Reds, and got no fucking clue who they are supporting. They come to act like a bunch of ""sick hectic"" hooligans, lighting flares, swearing at opposition fans on the street trying to get them to fight, act like a group or try-hard ultras they saw on YouTube, and don't even wear fucking red. They all wear black and chino pants. Not forgetting the Polo Caps and.   They sit in the corner of our Active Support, next to the Red Army. I am part of the Red Army, and love it. It's great fun and I do believe we provide great atmosphere to our games (hey, we Adelaidians try). But seriously, these knob heads give us a bad name/reputation. I note how when they light a flare, they all got their smartphones out, Snapchatting videos of it to all their mates to show off how 'tuff' they are. They bring their mates or girlfriends in there who just stand there and got no fucking clue whats happeni- no wait, flare was lit, I'm part of a cool group now.   The whole 'ultra' thing exists for a reason, and there is a whole culture around it; BUT NOT HERE. In my opinion, these people are not true football fans who do not care about supporting the game in Australia and hope for it to grow. They only care about themselves, and on behalf of my stupid, selfish, ignorant and self-obsessed generation I'm part of: I'm sorry.   I could go on forever, but this bullcrap is in Adelaide also. It seriously pisses me off, and whoever I speak to also agrees with the view and opinion I have of them. They need to stamped out, because they are ruining it for the rest of us.   Also sorry for the rant."

The team was definitely playing the way Ange wants the NT to play. I think a uniform style in all squads is something he has really strived for. It should make the transition from the youth team to the first team a bit easier.  Ange, Popovic and Ian Crook were at the game, as well as a few Mariners players and staff. All in all it was a pretty decent event and it only cost me a $1 donation and $5 for a drink."

Not that I want him, but the headline doesn't really match what's in the article...  Anyway, I thought we had no money? Don't have a coach either. Apparently we've gone ""cold"" on Ramon.

[Dimitrijevic] indicated to teammates last week that he was close to agreeing terms to enter a third season with Sydney.   I remember reading a while ago that he wanted more money. Perhaps he is getting Janko's marquee spot?  Overall, I'm confident that we should be able to keep most of our better players. The two real unknowns, as far as I'm aware, seem to be Ibini (as he's only here on a loan) and Smeltz (who I read was unhappy with his status as a sub)."

That being said, I went to the game, but it was only when I watched this video that I realised you guys were actually singing through your show of scarves. All I saw was a bunch of uncomfortable looking moderate Victory fans looking towards the Cove. Now I realise they were timidly singing my mum's favorite song.  I wouldn't be so defensive of it. You don't hear me defending knick knack paddy whack give a dog a bone :)"
Aleague,36h2e5,malbn,13,Tue May 19 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"You can hear both songs in the video pretty fucking clearly, depends on your choice of attention.   But the notion of the cove outsinging any other fans did give me a good laugh"
Aleague,36h2e5,itisknown__,11,Tue May 19 10:27:01 2015 UTC,"lol yep, sydney out sung Melbourne... Of course it had nothing to do with mic levels. What ever helps you deal with that embarrassing display on Sunday mate ;)"

Aleague,36h2e5,AvocadoCake,5,Tue May 19 13:30:13 2015 UTC,"I'm in no position to judge (I was in the terrace), but what you hear on TV is very often misleading. It's all about mic placement/prioritisation rather than actual noise. I rewatched the game at home and you could tell when we scored (luckily we did that quite a few times so I can be pretty sure) they would quickly turn down the sound so that the commentators aren't drowned out completely."
Aleague,36h2e5,PooDiePie,4,Tue May 19 10:11:13 2015 UTC,"It's not like we were completely unhearable at the ground. You heard us singing pretty fucking loudly during your song and we all know you did whether you like it or not.  Whether we actually outsung you (we probably didn't) is another matter, but no one's expecting 4000 of us to outsing 26000 other fans anyway."
Aleague,36h2e5,freeriderau,8,Tue May 19 13:39:21 2015 UTC,you definitely didn't outsing 26000. probably no fence to sit on there. But I'm sure you lot gave it a good bash until the end. Unlike city who packed it in about 25 minutes into the first half.

Aleague,36h2e5,effsee,-2,Tue May 19 15:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yep sure, the video taken in a home bay on the far side of the field from the away supporters, and right under a stadium speaker playing the song, is a fair representation, and the audio from microphones on the field are ""out of whack""."
Aleague,36h2e5,itisknown__,2,Wed May 20 00:15:24 2015 UTC,"Much fairer than a fox microphone planted directly in front of the Cove.

There's been multiple times where I've been in the shower a few days after a derby and accidentally caught myself singing it....  Also it's definitely just the audio people fucking with the levels. We outsing you every time we play at your home ground - there's no way you could outsing melbourne victory at theirs."
Aleague,36h2e5,lfc_7,0,Wed May 20 00:56:50 2015 UTC,"Fox Sports screwed with the mic levels a lot throughout the match. No offence but The Cove were completely drowned out in the stadium during Stand By Me. After all, all 4 ends (minus the away section) were singing it very loudly.  Around the 70 and 80th minute marks are good examples of the proper mic levels, although north ends mic was still set low.  At one point the commentators say something like 'listen to the crowd' and then the north end mics go full blast then turned down all of a sudden."

I thought I should send through what I saw on sunday.  Having watched it on TV I can say that considering the noise and size of the crowd that they looked incredibly well behaved. At no point were there flares or did there seem to be any trouble. As a supporter I have also not heard of any issues and think that the game was a fantastic celebration for the end of a fantastic and successful year for the A League and Football in general.

Aleague,36c2cz,spacexinfinity,4,Mon May 18 14:15:40 2015 UTC,"Flares in sports isn't a problem. It really depends on perception of dangerous behaviour. For example, soccer in America is quickly gaining popularity and fan culture in minor leagues such as USL & NASL have fans who come to games bearing and setting off flares. Here's an example where Detroit reports flares as fan culture but has no association with 'criminal' behaviour:   http://clickondetroit.com/sports/detroit-city-fc-wins-home-opener-10/25934496  Media outlets in Australia associates flares with bad behavior whereas in America it is the opposite.

Seattle Sounders also uses flares in their so called pre match rally without any confrontation from the police or authorities.

You can let kids just jump on the pitch and kick the ball around no worries, teach them to stand goalside for defence etc.  With AFL there's so many different skills involved they have to teach Auskickers, that even after they start playing matches it's going to take a few years before they're even doing something resembling football. It's bloody hard to get a 5 year old to kick spiral drop punts, as opposed with kick a round ball along the ground.  Don't take this to mean soccer doesn't take skill. It takes a lot.

I can't recall anytime they have and it certainly seems like a very selective attitude to suddenly ask for reports of anti-social behavior at a soccer game without judging all of our sports equally. Not a good attitude from Seven."

Aleague,36cn3f,Walkerthon,6,Mon May 18 09:04:29 2015 UTC,"Still many areas to improve on but very valid points on Victory's style. No surprise though given Ange's time at the club with Muscat learning the ropes under him. And Muscat has done a superb job in his own right too.  Of course, the playing style of a team should always take advantage of the strengths of the players but obviously pragmatic football is highly effective. This has always been Angle's approach with all his teams, yet each of them have been unique and varied in their own right as well."
Aleague,36cn3f,jp23,1 point,Mon May 18 11:11:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely a step in the right direction for the team, especially if we plan to have the national league as the main channel into the national team. The style may vary on the players at hand but the core tenants remain. It's also exciting to watch which is a plus.  The other nice thing about this influence is I think it plays nicely into the natural approach to Australian's in sport. Namely, high levels of fitness, general tall and better built than some other nations, and rigid stubborness and determination."

Aleague,36bitw,littlejib,13,Mon May 18 01:48:07 2015 UTC,It hit real fucking hard when the whole stadium erupted into seven nation army and we were just standing there trying not to cry. They make the wanderers fans look like a children's choir.
Aleague,36bitw,PooDiePie,9,Mon May 18 04:43:28 2015 UTC,"There were so many fucking police, it took forever to get from the gates to our seats. Outside the stadium before and after the game, they were a bit pushy and angry, but I guess they were trying to avoid any clashes between us and opposition fans.  I won't speak for the entire stadium, but the few guys next to me in our section were a lot more lenient and more understanding than I was expecting.  As I was making my way to my seat, one of them stopped me to check my bag. I told him that it's just full of my entire group's jumpers and I've already had to take them all out so that security would let me inside the stadium. ""Do you really want me to take them all out again?""  He said, ""No, I'm just doing what my boss tells me, he told me to go and check you because you look a bit dodgy, let's just pretend I searched the whole thing."" The guy next to him said, ""We're just looking for the dickheads with flares and we're pretty sure you're not one of them.""   I pointed to the other side of the stadium, ""Well they're all over there.""  ""I know,"" he said, ""and for the record, I hope you guys win tonight, enjoy the game.""  Here I was expecting the police to try and get everyone to sit down and shut up, but they were smiling when we were giving shit to Archie warming up, and afterwards they were talking about the game, saying, ""bad luck guys, you'll get it next year.""   The presence was completely over the top, and their statements leading up to the game seemed really threatening, but we show up and they seemed pretty chill, just doing their job, wanting us to enjoy the game while still keeping it safe for everybody.  Edit: I did see some people in the active bay getting asked to move to their allocated seat, when there were clearly no free seats left in the bay, which seemed pretty stupid. I assume the guy with the moustache was the boss of the guys who came to speak to me."
Aleague,36bitw,PooDiePie,1 point,Mon May 18 04:40:49 2015 UTC,They were very insistent about people sitting in their allocated seats. Went along the whole row at half time and moved people back to their ticketed seats. They stopped enforcing them at about 10 minutes to go (and people flocked down to the first 3 rows where I was sitting)
Aleague,36bitw,superhotmel85,5,Mon May 18 08:16:12 2015 UTC,I hav never seen so many police. It was crazy. I saw them pepper spray a few of our casuals after the game. The kid was a mess and said he had to get the cove bus back to Sydney. I would have hated to have been that guy.

Aleague,36c5qr,CheapTrick32,2,Mon May 18 08:44:43 2015 UTC,Hindsight is 20/20. NTS is arguably our most durable player which he showed again this year. It just wasn't our night nor did we deserve to outshadow the magnificent season Roar had.
Aleague,36c5qr,rodz7,1 point,Mon May 18 08:59:55 2015 UTC,Faty's injury was when i started being pessimistic. You lose that leader in the back line and everything starts going wrong
Aleague,36c5qr,littlejib,1 point,Mon May 18 12:42:24 2015 UTC,"Not only is Faty our most important defender, but losing him really hit the team mentally, probably just as much as tactically. You could see how gutted he was, and that feeling seeps through to the rest of the team.   But to me, the injury doesn't change much. Maybe it would've been 2-0 instead of 3. Honestly it took me 5 minutes to realise we weren't going to win. Just never showed up."
Aleague,36c5qr,so_much_wut,1 point,Mon May 18 13:30:23 2015 UTC,Same problem for us with NTS as people have said. The game was on a knifes edge ready to go either way and when you lose your best defender to Marshall everyone and keep structure it just snowballs

Aleague,36b9vq,falisimoses,22,Sun May 17 23:49:52 2015 UTC,"It could be argued that Gillett had an influence on the game because he actually showed up.   Victory won because their press was sublime. This picture. It's not from this game, rather Brisbane vs Victory last year, but it shows why we won the double, and it was basically MV last night. It's why they won. Sydney had 3 shots on goal all game. Their midfield was totally dominated. Every 50-50 ball Victory made 100% their own. Petkovic let the ball roll out 3-4 times under no pressure.   I feel bad for Sydney fans a little because that performance was dire. The club though? The best club in Australia? Nah, they can get fucked."
Aleague,36b9vq,ShrimpinAintEazy,3,Sun May 17 23:59:06 2015 UTC,"Victory won because their press was sublime   Yes.   Their midfield was totally dominated.   Yes   Every 50-50 ball Victory made 100% their own.   Yes   Petkovic let the ball roll out 3-4 times under no pressure.    Yes. And Kosta skinned him all night, going forwards and defensively. I was hoping FBK would jump over onto that side and terrorize him a bit too."
Aleague,36b9vq,ShrimpinAintEazy,2,Mon May 18 02:47:46 2015 UTC,"That foul where Petkovic obstructed Kosta up the wing was so telling. He had nothing. No pace, no determination, completely outplayed.

Aleague,36b9vq,kiac,3,Mon May 18 04:04:09 2015 UTC,Gillett had a great match I thought and was consistent throughout. He called a lot of the small little fouls early on to set the precedence. I cannot see how anyone could complain about him in this instance.   One team turned up yesterday and showed us how far football in Australia has come.   Might be interesting when Tottenham and Chelsea turn up to Sydney.
Aleague,36b9vq,Rupro_,2,Mon May 18 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"It seems Brosque wants shit let go, but only if it's advantageous for them, which fair enough every team wants that. But you can't complain when the ref had nothing to do with result. It was like Covic last season complaining about the ref. Lose with some dignity."
Aleague,36b9vq,kiac,1 point,Mon May 18 04:07:45 2015 UTC,Everyone needs a scapegoat after the shit talk that went on pre match. Victory's shit talk would of been yadda yadda we still won the premier's plate still the form team this year.
Aleague,36b9vq,Rupro_,1 point,Mon May 18 08:53:37 2015 UTC,"The amount of time janko copped it in the back of the head while going for the ball, not just this game, but all season was ridiculous. Sometimes he would suck and the opposition player wouldn't be anywhere near the ball. He's trying to show the ref they are not going for the ball. I can understand why he doesn't want to stay. Otherwise the red was fine"
Aleague,36b9vq,kiac,11,Mon May 18 00:57:01 2015 UTC,"I actually have no idea what you're saying here.   Are you upset that your marquee striker copped some physicality?  But let me guess, you've got no drama with a clearly late, studs up foul on our winger? Come on. That game was physical a fuck from both sides.   You boys were played off the park mentally, tactically and physically. It sucks, but there was nothing unfair about it."
Aleague,36b9vq,Brisbanealchemist,-1,Mon May 18 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"Victory throttled the game with fouls. They halted Sydney after half time by fouling, and gave away a total of 16 in the second half.  Gillett should have been giving out cards but let it play out because he clearly didn't want to back himself into a red card in a Grand Final. The only two yellows he gave for challenges were Berisha's elbow and Valeri's lunge, both on the edge of red cards.  Victory were allowed to do the same last week against City, stemming the flow of the game with cynical fouls.  Victory were the better team and no one is trying to take that away from you. Your pressure and dominance was clearly the determinant factor. However, Musc-ball (getting in front and fouling the other team out of the game) is not the kind of football the A-League should be encouraging with absent refereeing."
Aleague,36b9vq,victoryfc,7,Mon May 18 06:17:29 2015 UTC,"I don't get the argument. You are making it sound like in both games Victory fouled far more than the opposition. However, in both matches Victory conceded a handful more fouls than the other team.   No referee goes into a match not wanting to send anyone off, let alone the referee for an A-League Grand Final. The two yellows he gave for those challenges were acceptable and couldn't see a reason why they would be red.   I'm far from being a fan of the Victory but some crap that is brought up in some of these threads is utter rubbish."
Aleague,36b9vq,ShrimpinAintEazy,-1,Mon May 18 07:16:47 2015 UTC,"Victory conceded 22-17 fouls against Sydney, so that's rubbish. Wasn't my point at all though.  16-7 in the second half. Victory offered Sydney the ball and retreated to playing on the counter. Stemmed the game by fouling. Gillett should have carded players so they couldn't affect the game with fouls. Victory did it in both of their finals games. Clear tactic. Don't know how else to make my point clearer."
Aleague,36b9vq,sick_yilmaz,4,Mon May 18 07:36:18 2015 UTC,"Victory were well on top in the first half and only committed 6 fouls. Your point is hardly clear as your seeing things how you want to see it. If anything from the image you linked it showed that Victory for a 10 minute period after half time committed about a third of their fouls. Last time I checked there is 90 minutes in a game so even if Sydney stemmed the game by fouling for those 10 minutes there is a further 80 minutes of game time. Maybe Gillett had a word with the players after that 10 minute period and Victory stopped?  Yellow cards shouldn't be issued to any player as a means to stop the team for committing fouls. This is not Rugby Union. Fouls are part of the game as much as goals are. Yellows are not to stop fouls, they are a tool used to keep the players on the pitch by letting them know they are close to crossing the line.   I get it, you don't like the Victory. Until you decide to slap on the referee's uniform please don't go on harping about how a qualified FIFA referee should referee a game."
Aleague,36b9vq,ShrimpinAintEazy,-3,Mon May 18 10:11:19 2015 UTC,Not even going to dignify that with a response. Christ.
Aleague,36b9vq,sick_yilmaz,3,Mon May 18 10:31:14 2015 UTC,"And what are you saying that the cards should have been for?  There was nothing there that really required yellow cards.  I thought Valeri's second yellow might have been a bit harsh, as I barely heard the whistle over the crowd on TV, so I am not certain that Valeri would have heard the whistle.  I don't get why people constantly go on about how our referees are shit.  Realistically, our top referees are just as good as many of the best in the world."
Aleague,36b9vq,victoryfc,1 point,Mon May 18 22:33:31 2015 UTC,Gillett probably wanted to be consistent with not awarding many yellows for Sydney's first 20 minutes where they fouled Victory 5~10 times.
Aleague,36b9vq,littlejib,3,Mon May 18 08:44:26 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely kidding yourself if you think we didn't try to play and just fouled Sydney. We controlled that game physically, mentally and tactically. We dominated them at the front, at the back and centrally in every aspect. We knew exactly what was gonna happen on that pitch before the first whistle was blown. We took every single advantage that was possible.  If you think we were ""cynical"" in the way we went about it, I think you're pretty far off the mark. That was the most professional performance I have seen from my team all season. There isn't a team in the league that would have come close to us yesterday. We were uncompromising.   If you don't want to see your team put in a performance like we did yesterday, well.... Good luck to you."
Aleague,36b9vq,ShrimpinAintEazy,-5,Mon May 18 06:36:02 2015 UTC,"Then how about you win the game and play fair aswell? wouldn't that be even more of an amazing performance to do so? but you guys didn't, you played dirty as fuck and the ref let shit go. You were clearly the better side but you still had to put the boot in."
Aleague,36b9vq,littlejib,2,Mon May 18 07:31:53 2015 UTC,"FUCKING LOL. You think that was ""putting the boot in?""   So fucking soft."
Aleague,36b9vq,Mfrendin_Roar,-2,Mon May 18 07:36:52 2015 UTC,Good response.
Aleague,36b9vq,littlejib,3,Mon May 18 07:39:37 2015 UTC,"The fouls were 50/50, you guys were just shit on the ball last night - I've never seen a worse performance in recent history, the amount of times the ball just rolled out of play was appalling. I went into the game worried and felt like an idiot for being worried after about 20 minutes.  edit: pls sydney fans roll on the salty downvotes."
Aleague,36b9vq,littlejib,-3,Mon May 18 08:51:26 2015 UTC,You clearly have no idea what I'm saying here. I've never said anything but they we never turned up. And I never said I was ok with studs up fouls. Stop trying to draw salt where there is none.   The amount of physicality directed janko seas all season was excessive and should have been called more. Blows to the back of the head without the defender getting anywhere near the ball. These uncalled fouls really annoyed him on the pitch. And this in my opinion is what is one of the main motives for him leaving
Aleague,36b9vq,littlejib,7,Mon May 18 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"No worse than is dished out anywhere else in the world.   If he can't handle some physicality for AUD$1.5M a season, then its probably for the best that he is on his way and goes and plays somewhere where he won't get his hair messed up."
Aleague,36b9vq,littlejib,-1,Mon May 18 02:56:35 2015 UTC,"If elbows to the back of the head are world wide acceptable, then we need to rethink the rules of the sport"
Aleague,36b9vq,Mfrendin_Roar,8,Mon May 18 03:06:22 2015 UTC,m8 your team didn't turn up. You guys were constantly fouling as well because you were that yard slower then the victory players.
Aleague,36b9vq,TheFightingImp,-1,Mon May 18 02:52:06 2015 UTC,"And all that has nothing to do with janko, thanks for contributing. Though I remember, I think for the last goal, milos sticking his foot out so late it would look back in my weekend league"
Aleague,36b9vq,Mfrendin_Roar,6,Mon May 18 03:26:09 2015 UTC,Janko gave it out pretty good last night. Good players get targeted. Circle of life.

Aleague,36b9vq,ShrimpinAintEazy,5,Mon May 18 03:24:36 2015 UTC,But the ref didn't do much wrong last night... The only thing I can think of is Milligan fouling Milos and then putting Kosta through for a shot on goal.

For 80 minutes it was tense, even though we were on top there was every chance of a goal against play and from there it becomes a mess even if we're playing well. Even then Valeri getting sent off made me nervous, but we scored again right after that and settled the nerves for good.  And I think we're slightly overrating Sydney here. I feel like they've been flat track bullies this season, gliding through the second half of the season on an easy draw. We were clearly the better team in the last two games we played against them, and we brought our absolute best today. Any team in the A-League's history would have been hard pressed against us the way we played."

Aleague,368upp,ODABBOTT,8,Sun May 17 08:32:47 2015 UTC,Probably because it annoys everyone.

Aleague,368upp,effsee,3,Sun May 17 08:50:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm home. That was shit.  AAMI park is an incredible stadium and I will be forever jealous of its existence.  The turnout was better than I expected. 4000 fans seems a lot more than I thought it would be for an away crowd. Ever since I got to the airport in the morning to when I left the airport a few hours ago I was surrounded by other Sydney fans."
Aleague,368upp,PooDiePie,1 point,Sun May 17 14:02:47 2015 UTC,AAMI park is an incredible stadium and I will be forever jealous of its existence.   Respect. Its pretty special isn't it.   You guys were pretty loud though. Loved the Archie chants. No respect ;)
Aleague,368upp,ShrimpinAintEazy,4,Mon May 18 02:50:20 2015 UTC,"Whose idea was it to have the Victory players warm up on our end? Great scenes. Both sets of fans were killing it in the first half.   You can hear word for word, and in perfect clarity, everything that is sung from the other side of the stadium. The rake of the terraces is something I would kill to have at Allianz. I was only a few rows from the front but the view of the pitch was phenomenal.  When Victory scored the house fucking erupted. Never heard such a loud cheer as a bystander in my life, it was truly awesome (as in a biblical 'awe'some, not necessarily a positive description.) Anyone who says that Wanderers fans are the loudest in the league are just kidding themselves, they're laughable in comparison.  The only downsides to the stadium were the tiny screens, couldn't see shit on them lol, but it didn't really matter because I could see the pitch properly anyway.  Fark, if anyone gives us shit for quietening down towards the end, I'll slap 'em across the face. It was absolutely heartbreaking what was happening on the field. You can talk all you like about singing for your team no matter what is happening on the field, but to go from our incredible run after the Asian Cup to beating Adelaide 4 - 1 at home to the game last night, it was devastating.  We were loud up until the second goal when we were left stunned, after the third we lifted a bit, but fuck that game was flattening.  There was a bit of toxicity towards the end of the game, but for the most part people just accepted it and reflected back on what was a terrific season. If only it wasn't Melbourne that decided to take those few steps more."
Aleague,368upp,PooDiePie,2,Mon May 18 05:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you enjoyed AAMI. This is why I didn't give a fuck that 20,000 people were missing out. We were at something special last night - I think its unlikely that I'll ever see another MV GF at AAMI. At least I got to see it once."

Aleague,36821i,falisimoses,2,Sun May 17 06:46:58 2015 UTC,"Janjetovic is credited with one, that's it so far."
Aleague,36821i,CBAFCMV,3,Sun May 17 06:48:04 2015 UTC,Sydney are playing far more direct but individual players losing possession is costing them.
Aleague,36821i,dtsyk,3,Sun May 17 06:51:27 2015 UTC,"Man, that could have changed the game if that went in. Solid save by Thomas"

Aleague,36821i,spacexinfinity,2,Sun May 17 06:27:45 2015 UTC,It's seems Berisha drew blood. Aren't refs kind of obliged to give a yellow in that situation?
Aleague,36821i,-Volumes_,2,Sun May 17 06:28:24 2015 UTC,Stitches for Jurman at 1/2 time.
Aleague,36821i,Rofl_Crab,2,Sun May 17 06:29:31 2015 UTC,Every Victory freekick can basically be written off as a Sydney clearance at the moment.
Aleague,36821i,Ta0Ta,2,Sun May 17 06:39:48 2015 UTC,The Victory crowd have been huge so far.

Aleague,36821i,falisimoses,2,Sun May 17 07:00:28 2015 UTC,This grand final has been a blood bath! Sydney putting 2 legs in and are getting butchered. If they keep this up they will finish with 10 men and a 3-0 loss.   Victory have been as dominant as they were in the 2007 grand final.
Aleague,36821i,mrbriss,2,Sun May 17 07:00:37 2015 UTC,Does everyone remember this one?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiEA3zb_R-A

Aleague,36821i,malbn,2,Sun May 17 07:17:49 2015 UTC,Difference: Victory aren't shitting the bed. Still plenty of time for Sydney but they're looking like this is the first time they've played together.
Aleague,36821i,dtsyk,2,Sun May 17 07:18:39 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one actually incredibly frustrated by the streams, with the ads all over the video making sure that you can hear the game, but can NEVER FUCKING SEE IT!"

Aleague,36821i,Never_Fight_Bears,2,Sun May 17 08:00:49 2015 UTC,"yeah, Where is their salary cap pressure? They should have to release some players to be able to keep that front four(I know Berisha is Marquee but still.)"

Aleague,368iee,Cupbearer,4,Sun May 17 09:15:50 2015 UTC,The AFL international cup.
Aleague,368iee,EnglishHooligan,2,Sun May 17 07:21:51 2015 UTC,"Australian Football International Cup:       The Australian Football International Cup (also known as the AFL International Cup) is an international sport competition in Australian rules football. It is currently co-ordinated by the Australian Football League's game development arm and run every 3 years since 2002.  The tournament is the largest international Australian rules football event and the only one that is open to worldwide senior competition; although Australia, the home and world's strongest nation in the game, does not participate as it would most likely dominate the competition.  The inaugural tournament was the 2002 Australian Football International Cup run by the International Australian Football Council under the auspices of the Australian Football League, which then assumed full control with the winding up of the IAFC.  The Cup was originally for male participants only, but in 2011 a women's competition was established.  After some suggestions the tournament would be run every 4 years, the AFL is currently maintaining the 3-year cycle.  The grand final of each men's tournament has been held as a curtain raiser to a home-and-away match of the AFL premiership season.  Australia is not represented in the men's tournament; as the only nation where the sport is played professionally, the difference in skill level between an Australian national team and the nearest competitor is currently far too large for any contest to be worthwhile. As such, the tournament is geared towards development of the sport outside Australia and expatriate Australians may not compete, with the exception of the women's OzIM team, where only indigenous and multicultural Australians are able to enter.

Negatives:   The debacle that was the seating arrangement for the derby semi-final. Missile throwing and seat damage. Love pyro but it's hard to justify lobbing seats at people. The ongoing demise of CCM and Jets Perth Glory salary cap issues did rob a lot of the competition out of the league. Victory kinda walked it in after that.

The NPL is currently on in all states, so go out and find a local team to support, There's a lot of culture and history out there that many of us don't even know about, and there is nothing like supporting your local team.  The final ties for the FFA cup Qualifying are also currently being played, so get out there. http://www.nationalpremierleagues.com/  Over the next couple of months we have a few touring european teams, who are not only playing in Australia but most are being broadcast on either 7 or 9. Keep a look out on the sidebar for dates.  The Under-20 world cup is starting in two weeks time on the 30th of May and is being hosted by New Zealand. Unfortunately Australia hasn't qualified (fucking paul okon) but we can cheers on our Kiwi brothers.  In a months time we have the Womens world cup, with the first game on the 7th of June at 7:30 AEST with New Zealand playing their first game later in the day. Australia's first game will be on the 9th at 9:00 am. ALL games are being broadcast live by sbs  There is plenty of mens International Football in the offseason as well with Australia Playing their next Game against Kyrgyzstan on the 16th of June and continuing in september and october.  Starting in July the FFA cup is back on with the Round of 32 from the 28th of July. Foxtel is broadcasting a paltry 11 games of the cup but 11 is better than nothing.  The next season of the A-League is set to start in October so stay tuned.  Lastly just after the next A league season starts we have the U-16 world cup being played in Chile from 17 October - 7th of November. Both New Zealand and Australia Will be participating."

Aleague,363zlq,jonzey,3,Sat May 16 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't bother with a Taxi to be honest. No traffic will be running down Olympic Boulevard after the game.   If you've got to get to the airport almost straight after the match I'd recommend taking the train from Richmond to Flinders St first, then catching a cab from the taxi rank there. There will be heaps of trains running towards Flinders Street after the game. However you'll want to sort out your myki beforehand due to the crowds at the gates.  Another alternative would be to walk across Punt Road down Swan Street for a bit, then catching a taxi from one of the local side streets there. You may need to wait for a bit though."

It will probably just be quicker to make the 15-20 min walk yourself to Flinders and get a taxi from there.   You could catch a Skybus from Southern Cross which would be much cheaper than a taxi, but if time's a factor then it'd be best to get a taxi."

I went to pick up my dad from the station because there were delayed trains on the line out to Hornsby, on the way home he realised that he didn't have his bag, but he said he must have left it at work. We decided to drive back into the city to get his bag so that we didn't have to worry about it the next morning.  In the bag was his keys and wallet (who the fuck keeps their wallet in their bag? FFS!), his ipad and laptop. He was also doing some sort of tax thing so he had his passport and birth certificate in his bag as well.  The worst part about this for him was that without any ID he wouldn't be able to fly out on Sunday to Melbourne for the game, so it became apparent that we needed to get his bag back.  We got to the city, and his bag wasn't at work, so he then called up someone he was on the train with who told him that he in fact did have his bag on the train. We went all the way back to Epping station to see if he'd left it in the toilets there, with no luck, we called up Sydney Trains who told us that the bag was at Hornsby. We drove to Hornsby, picked up the bag, and everything was still in it. Thank you, kind people of Sydney.  So, not that I wouldn't have just gone without him anyway, but the /u/PooDiePie family will be there in force tomorrow."

The stats prove it, they were marginally better than Sydney, and it shows on the table. On the field, they didn't show it. 3 matches, 3 draws. Neither team ""deserves"" shit going into this final."

Aleague,36193c,suicidal_smrtcar,41,Sat May 16 00:37:26 2015 UTC,Ante Covic   Will go down as the first club legend. That performance over 2 legs against Al Hilal is one of best goal keeping performances ever.
Aleague,36193c,rodz7,-5,Fri May 15 07:15:21 2015 UTC,From the perspective of a wanderers supporter. Everyone else saw definite penalties not given.
Aleague,36193c,imasssssssssssssnake,10,Fri May 15 23:25:16 2015 UTC,We saw that too. We also saw multiple saves that should have been goals.
Aleague,36193c,RockheadRumple,4,Fri May 15 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"In the second leg of which Ante's only ""slip up"" was clipping the player as the ball trickled out.   The goalkeeping performance over 180 minutes was one of the best ever. Whether Golec should have been penalised or not doesn't change that."
Aleague,36193c,rodz7,-4,Fri May 15 23:43:18 2015 UTC,"In the second leg there were 2 clear cut penalties by ante which could have seen him off the pitch.  Obviously he was your best player. But his performance has so much luck on it, the referee bottled it big time."
Aleague,36193c,imasssssssssssssnake,3,Fri May 15 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"1 ""penalty"". The one in the 65th minute where the player hit it long and Ante clipped him on the way down. Why would he get a red for that when it's not an obvious goal scoring opportunity?   What was the second?"
Aleague,36193c,rodz7,3,Sat May 16 00:02:03 2015 UTC,"Interested to know what you think the second one was, maybe I've forgotten something...  I think his performance was that much better because he did it all with lasers in his eyes."

Aleague,36193c,imasssssssssssssnake,1 point,Sat May 16 05:24:36 2015 UTC,I still think the ref didn't give penalties in the 2nd leg because of the lasers in Covic's face would've meant a sure goal.

No. They're either off contract or have been released from their contracts. A-League clubs can't sell each other players. We really need to get some sort of system in place to get compensation for development and shit. Brisbane has had to put up with being Victory's feeder club for a bit now."
Aleague,36193c,stationhollow,3,Fri May 15 08:04:24 2015 UTC,"Man, Juric leaving is a huge blow considering we could've sold him off earlier :("

Aleague,36193c,rodz7,1 point,Fri May 15 23:47:16 2015 UTC,"That is true, or an Asian Cup either"
Aleague,36193c,lolmanic,1 point,Sat May 16 02:05:50 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree, and not just because my club is well off. Compensation for players leaving on a free has never been a thing (as far as I'm aware, at least not recently) and isn't really fair to the player (contract is over, no more income, but potential employers still have to fork out the cash in order to hire you, and that's before the salary). I think allowing trading between clubs would allow more clubs to give players longer contracts, reducing the frequency at which a player has a good season then goes off to Europe on a free (eg Rojas). It comes with the downside of perhaps increasing the gap between top and bottom (but clubs will still reserve the right to not sell, so not by too much), but I think it would, overall, increase the quality of the league."
Aleague,36193c,AvocadoCake,1 point,Fri May 15 17:42:41 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about leaving at the end of their contract. I'm talking about how the A-League doesn't allow clubs to purchase contracts from other clubs here in Australia. The clubs have to mutually let their players go to do a 'trade'.
Aleague,36193c,stationhollow,3,Sat May 16 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"Alot of teams seem to be getting rid of heaps of players, I can't remember seeing so many player departures at a time before personally. None of those departing players shock me as leaving, but I can't help but feel some of those will truly be losses for the club, namely La Rocca, Covic (could've helped Bouzanis or set aside to a number #2 role - but I suppose Vukovic is meant to be arriving), and Nikita - even though he never really hit form during his time at the club this season.   Surprised to see Poljak hasn't been released, I remember seeing lots of talk about him leaving and I personally would've liked to pick him up for the Mariners. Seems it was a case of La Rocca or Poljak, and Poljak got the nod.  Gonna be some very different squads for lots of teams next season!"
Aleague,36193c,timmmy8,2,Fri May 15 06:37:32 2015 UTC,"On this season's form I'm happier that Poljak is staying. We had to move on from 2 tackling DMs to 1 tackling and a more passing player. Hoping Spira might be utilised there more next season, rotating with Poljak and Yojiro."
Aleague,36193c,murseglen,4,Fri May 15 06:50:21 2015 UTC,"silly thing is you had the passing player in mooy, and a damn good one at that."
Aleague,36193c,yegermeister,5,Fri May 15 07:03:13 2015 UTC,"Ugh, don't remind me. I get the feeling he made a decision to leave early because he wanted the game time, and Ono was still in limbo for the following season. It's a what if scenario, unfortunately.   Then again, I'm really pleased with how he's gone this season. He deserves all the praise and plaudits for his season."
Aleague,36193c,murseglen,1 point,Fri May 15 07:09:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it just didn't work out for a few reasons, it seems. Bloody glad, you were a much more dangerous side with him around.  I'm glad to see him play so well, really hope he kicks on and cements a place in the Socceroos XI."
Aleague,36193c,yegermeister,1 point,Fri May 15 07:18:19 2015 UTC,"He wasn't the reason we were a more dangerous side, correlation not causation"
Aleague,36193c,Zeezer,2,Sat May 16 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was the whole reason, but I think he was part of it."
Aleague,36193c,yegermeister,2,Sat May 16 02:14:09 2015 UTC,There's no way we could keep him with the money he wanted.
Aleague,36193c,rodz7,1 point,Fri May 15 07:12:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could have if you had have got rid of some other players, maybe ones who you're now getting rid of anyway. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose though, can't have known so many would perform so poorly."
Aleague,36193c,yegermeister,2,Fri May 15 07:17:28 2015 UTC,"Ruka's wages are the only one close to what he wanted and our needs for an attacking midfielder were focused on Saba, with replacing Hersi and Polenz being other priorities. Hindsight is 20/20, but the schedule we had coming up meant we needed max squad allowance."
Aleague,36193c,rodz7,3,Fri May 15 07:23:32 2015 UTC,"Be interesting to see who we sign. Especially as our marquee, a lot of pressure on popa to get it right after the Saba incident"
Aleague,36193c,Kamone1202,5,Fri May 15 23:02:22 2015 UTC,"Well that's a lot of players. Actually bummed about Ruka and Kalmar, the others were obvious departures or replaceable.   Good thing is we have a lot of youth. Bad thing is in not sure where to find a half dozen players quality enough to get onto the roster."
Aleague,36193c,murseglen,5,Fri May 15 06:31:23 2015 UTC,"Actually bummed about Ruka   If he was on more than double the average, would that change your opinion about keeping him?   He's lightning in a bottle, but can't hit the broad side of a barn. He'll be 28 come the new season. I don't see him suddenly becoming a top class finisher."

Aleague,36193c,sweep_the_legs,3,Fri May 15 08:39:15 2015 UTC,"Hoping beyond hope that he's got an offer in Europe somewhere (maybe a league of the level of Belgium or Austria might be right).   Maybe not the Chinese offer, given how unstable those clubs are, but seeing him going to the K or J League would be interesting as well- Asian defences cannot handle him at all."

The past three years have been amazing when you consider how little we had to work with initially but this is finally a real opportunity to build for the future and Jancko wouldn't be part of that.

Aleague,36193c,DolphinGiraffe,0,Fri May 15 07:30:32 2015 UTC,"No,  he was an injury replacement for valaphie.  He signed for wsw before we could make room for him under the cap. No shafting of any sort went on."
Aleague,36193c,DolphinGiraffe,4,Fri May 15 07:28:27 2015 UTC,"Had nothing to do with the cap. I was kind of wrong in the other post saying it was because he was too old, but that's still a part of it.  http://www.a-league.com.au/article/no-more-victory-for-covic/1ou4rhz74bluw1w1eok5rzrv67  You had two contracted keepers for the following season, Velaphi and Lawrence. So Ange didn't resign Covic.  At the time there were worries that season was his last stand. It would have been a big move ousting a young keeper for Covic's last hurrah.  He absolutely was not poached by WSW.  Ange then went and signed a third keeper in Nathan Coe a few months later. Letting Covic go was a terrible decision that was absolutely made by Ange and Victory."
Aleague,36193c,kiac,7,Fri May 15 08:06:00 2015 UTC,Inside word is Ange and Covic did not get along and clashed on several issues. Apparently Ange got rid of him before it caused problems amongst the playing group.   Source: current and former Vuk youth players

Aleague,3615iy,aninstituteforants,11,Fri May 15 05:41:32 2015 UTC,"Seeing as I have been through this myself with our derby Tifo earlier this season I feel for the NT. It's a bitch getting anything approved and you are at the whims of FFA, Vicpol and stadium who can change their mind at any moment. We spent hours working on our Tifo in December to be denied last minute and now this has happened to NT, the FFA and Vicpol are doing a good job of killing active support in melbourne."
Aleague,3615iy,thisphantomfortress,11,Fri May 15 06:11:55 2015 UTC,"There were many laughing when you had your tifo disallowed, but I think many of us realised that the same thing could happen to us very easily and didn't find it very funny at all."
Aleague,3615iy,itisknown__,2,Fri May 15 06:19:55 2015 UTC,Yea can't see how others didn't see it as a warning sign. I think the NT leaders must have though since they have adapted pretty well with some solid card displays and tifo's on poles. Any idea if this one was on poles or a pull over?
Aleague,3615iy,thisphantomfortress,2,Fri May 15 06:38:46 2015 UTC,"More than likely poles. MV & WSW are banned from pullovers. SFC may be banned from pullovers too, but it might just be for ""high risk"" games."

Aleague,3615iy,aussieaussie1,3,Fri May 15 06:56:24 2015 UTC,"Doesn't help, but this started in December when we got our tifo banned and we hadn't been throwing bottles at other fans."

But let's see the SFC supporters come out with approved banners of 'FTT'.    EDIT: this is the tifo. Pretty inoffensive."
Aleague,3615iy,itisknown__,14,Fri May 15 05:50:32 2015 UTC,now they're just asking for a pyro-heavy tifo.   Why do those idiots think this is the answer? It will just lead to more restrictions on them

Aleague,3615iy,ISO2,7,Fri May 15 06:10:57 2015 UTC,"not changing, just usual practice. During the season, clubs run the match day operations, in the finals it is the FFA. This is why City got a seating allocation they couldn't fill in the semi final."

Aleague,360ok3,notbilbo,2,Fri May 15 03:09:54 2015 UTC,Not happening. Re-build is way too expensive and we're not even a priority when it comes to stadium upgrades with ANZ and Allianz having more powerful boards.   5K upgrade was scheduled to be completed and ready for this coming season as per articles and rumours in our first season. Still remember getting shit back then for suggesting we need an upgrade.
Aleague,360ok3,rodz7,5,Fri May 15 04:44:57 2015 UTC,I think you underestimate the power of swing seats on the decision making process. Western Sydney is a battle ground for both state and federal so I could see a rebuild happening. The only question would be where would the wanderers play during it.
Aleague,360ok3,suicidal_smrtcar,1 point,Fri May 15 07:38:00 2015 UTC,New stadium that helps only one NRL club and one A-League doesn't win you an election alone.
Aleague,360ok3,rodz7,1 point,Fri May 15 08:44:04 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that a complete knockdown/rebuild would take several years to complete. If that does happen, where would the Wanderers play in the meantime? Penrith? Campbelltown? Or would they look closer to the CBD, to somewhere like Belmore?"
Aleague,360ok3,SerTahu,1 point,Fri May 15 10:23:01 2015 UTC,"Given the right marketing and playing on the Wanderers name, they could play a few games at various Sydney grounds and try to drum up more local support while a stadium is being built.  Unless its a derby then they shouldn't ever play at ANZ.

Aleague,360vuh,GetUpMorningMVFC,6,Fri May 15 03:50:20 2015 UTC,"absolute overkill. there's been next to no trouble at aami this season (or last). All that is needed is a same amount of police they'd use for any other 26,000+ Victory game and a strong police escort for The Cove and the North Terrace. And maybe a dozen cops outside Sydney's pub and in the surrounding area."
Aleague,360vuh,itisknown__,4,Fri May 15 04:51:00 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree it is overkill and wouldn't expect any trouble on Grand Final day, but after the shenanigans last week how can anyone be surprised."
Aleague,360vuh,Rupro_,2,Fri May 15 07:01:40 2015 UTC,Coppers were surrounding them up there but were still doing nothing about it. More cops =/= increased safety.
Aleague,360vuh,AvocadoCake,5,Fri May 15 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"Here's a VicPol media statement  I wish they would stop making it out like it's some kind of war. This reeks of an 'us vs them' mentality, when they should really just be decent and not treat everyone like a criminal.   We're not going to the stadium on Sunday to cause trouble with police. We're not going to the stadium to cause trouble with the opposition fans. We're not going to the stadium to cause trouble with our own fans. We're going to watch a game and we're going to go absolutely mental if our team scores.   Sometimes this means standing on the seats, sometimes this means throwing our drinks in the air, sometimes it means not sitting in our allocated seats or standing in the aisles, sometimes this means behaving in an offensive manner. These small things really shouldn't be an issue but I fear that VicPol will be in control-freak mode.  They're going to have that constant pissed off look on their faces. They won't be nice people, they'll be fearing for their safety, and they'll be stressed about their job and controlling the crowd, when in reality they should just chill the fuck out and be lenient. We're just there to watch the game and have a good time.  I have a habit of jumping up on my seat for a bit when we score. I've tried to break this habit because I know it's against the rules but it just happens naturally. This statement says I'll be ejected if I do that on Sunday, even though I'm probably the biggest 'pussy ESFC' fan in the stadium.  Anyway, I'm probably overreacting, but I don't want shitty policing to ruin the GF experience."
Aleague,360vuh,PooDiePie,1 point,Fri May 15 04:40:54 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, everyone blocking the aisles will be evicted, so that's the cops gone. Unless their rules don't apply to them.  It's ridiculous. It's not rocket science - they send anti-terrorist groups to deal with football fans and send out statements like these, yet they're somehow still surprised when there's animosity.    By the way, gotta love their cheeky tripling of the already stupid ""on the spot fine"" for being drunk (used to be ~270 if memory serves). It gives them the freedom to fine anyone who's had half a drink of beer and they decide they don't like. I don't drink so it doesn't affect me directly, but it lets them do whatever they want to people who do (because no one carries around $800 cash)."

""We need to do this because although the majority of soccer fans do the right thing every week, a persistent problematic minority can spoil everyone else's enjoyment through their selfish and illegal behaviour,"" says Police Commander Brett Guerin.  Last week's Melbourne Victory vs Melbourne City match was marred by Victory fans smashing stadium chairs and pelting other Victory fans with water bottles and glass.

Aleague,35w1bh,Nos_4r2,8,Thu May 14 05:33:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of Aussies agree with you, which is why 'proper' fans of the league value the premiership over the championship (grand final win).  Despite that feeling, it won't go away.  It makes the FFA too much money, its a big broadcasting cash cow, and it gets bandwagoners on board who otherwise may not have had an interest in the league (this I actually think is an ok reason, if it gets more people involved).  What IS interesting to note is that in all 10 seasons of the A-League, the only teams that have won the Grand Final have been teams that finished 1 or 2 in the regular season, so the whole '6th finishers can win it!' argument has been largely silenced."
Aleague,35w1bh,Krimsonmyst,2,Thu May 14 03:24:26 2015 UTC,The worst thing about a possible loss on Sunday for me is that nobody is going to acknowledge that we actually did win the league this season. Nobody is going to value our premiership win.

Totally agree. All the A-League fans I know get it. They were all slightly heart-broken to hear Gallop say that we'd almost certainly never have a promotion/relegation system. But this is what NRL and AFL fans don't understand. The Aussie tradition of the 'Finals' is purely a broadcasting cash cow. It's a reasonably ingenious one and it's not going away, but you'd like to see the FFA make more of an effort to hail the Premiership as the superior result.  I'll stop being a whining Brit now."

Aleague,35xic4,maelstrom_xiii,2,Thu May 14 11:27:11 2015 UTC,"To be fair, as one of those ""10 minutes away and can't be bothered thing,"" I'd like to share my concerns, and if you can alleviate them, I will happily attend many Roar games next season.  I am an American expat, came here to Brisbane in 2011. I didn't much care for soccer (see: American), but that changed with the World Cup--I watched some matches, fell in love...then I did the responsible thing and bought FIFA 14, started to learn about the sport, the players, started a Brisbane Roar career mode...you know, the usual. Then I started looking into teams (here and abroad) and watched some Roar games on SBS. Really enjoyed it.  Now, I have 2 young children, and I would love to take them to games.   Just two concerns. One, how much are tickets usually? As an American football fan, tickets to NFL games cost an arm and a leg, and frankly, I can't afford that very often as I only have two arms and two legs.   Two, things like hearing about flares, stupid fans and police altercations, the like, really put me off taking my children to a game. I don't want them in a potentially dangerous environment. Does that sort of thing happen at Roar home games? If not, I'll certainly look into taking at least my oldest to a match or three this season."
Aleague,35xic4,BrisbaneBhoy,5,Thu May 14 23:41:54 2015 UTC,"Tickets start are about 25-30 bucks for the cheap seats, it's nowhere near NFL level. You can usually get family ticket deals as well.  ""flares, stupid fans and police altercations""  Yeah it's all bollocks. None of that happens up here and even then if it did happen it would be nowhere near where you and you're family are sitting."
Aleague,35xic4,littlejib,1 point,Thu May 14 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"Look into memberships for kids. Sydney do something where if you play football, you get a 4 game membership. A season ticket for kids for roar is $75 for any seat in the stadium also"
Aleague,35xic4,JuiceSpringsteen8,1 point,Fri May 15 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"Tickets are great value, Adults about $25 for the cheapest, and I think kids are pretty cheap.  The safety thing is really a non-issue. I saw one flare at the start of the season in the den, and that was delt with quickly and investigated. Anywhere else in the stadium is a lot of people sitting and enjoying the game peacefully, the family end would be great if you have kids, they have fun stuff for the kids, give aways. They really cater to the family going along even with small children/infants."
Aleague,35xic4,Jet51,0,Fri May 15 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"Tickets I can't say myself since I'm a member (even then, I don't organise that) but like BrisbaneBhoy, usually around the $30  About flares, stupid fans and police altercations, none of that stupid shit happens, a lot of the time, you will notice that the away teams are the ones who actually bring in the flares at Roar home games, of course we've had it a couple times over the seasons but nothing like you hear on the news. You aren't going to get hurt, it's a family friendly place and you will easily enjoy it."
Aleague,35xic4,littlejib,0,Fri May 15 03:49:01 2015 UTC,"There are angry bogans all over the place that spend the entire match yelling and swearing at the ref, the opposition and our team. Your best bet would be in the 'family section' which is on the south end (behind the goals, opposite end to the den). They should also be the cheapest tickets.  There has been the occasional flare in the den (one this season) and on the march to the stadium from the Hotel LA.  I've really never came across any trouble at a game, I don't even think I have seen someone kicked out yet. If you sit anywhere other than the family section just be aware you will hear the odd cranky bogan."

I went up the escalator into the main area, took a good look at all the cops standing around, then proceeded towards the bathrooms because I needed to pee quite badly.  I was waiting outside the bathrooms for a vacant booth, when I saw one of the policemen taking a long, hard look at me, he leant over and said something to the cop next to him, and proceeded to walk over to me. I thought, ""I have nothing to hide,"" so I just stayed there waiting for the cop to come and ask whatever he was going to ask.  He asked, ""What are your plans for tonight?"" I told him I was just going to drive home from the station.  He said, ""Mate, it looks like you're trying to avoid the dog."" I shook my head, ""Nah I just need the bathroom.""  ""Where do you live?"" I told him Hornsby, ""That's a long way from here mate."" I told him that I parked the car at Epping because I enjoy the drive from my place to epping before catching the train to the city.  So after I had established my strange story, he asked, ""Do you do graffiti at all?"" My heart fucking sank. Had my days of teenage mischief finally caught up to me? Did he recognise me from 3 year old CCTV footage? I said, ""Nah,"" while shaking my head. The officer looked convinced and just said, ""You can never be too careful."" I nodded and said goodbye. Proceeded to piss and gtfo as fast as possible.  tl;dr - /u/PooDiePie is a paranoid former criminal, and they have police dogs that can sniff for paint cans.

The chances of you being able to catch a game or three are very high, given that there are two teams in both of the cities you are visiting."
Aleague,35v68r,patrick478,1 point,Wed May 13 20:21:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I'll keep my fingers crossed. On the off chance both teams are home in either Sydney or Melbourne, is one of each city's two teams generally agreed upon to be a better fan experience/atmosphere?  I realize that's a pretty loaded question."
Aleague,35v68r,patrick478,3,Wed May 13 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"Note: I'm a Wellington supporter so I'm not biased towards or against any of the four clubs.  Victory definitely have the better atmosphere in Melbourne, not even the City fans will disagree with you there.   Sydney is a bit more of a contest. The atmosphere at WSW games used to be amazing, but their crowd numbers have dropped off significantly this season due to their team being not very good. Sydney FC on the other hand have a more stable fanbase, but they play in a stadium way too big for their regular season games, so the atmosphere suffers as a result. You would enjoy both clubs atmosphere, they are very different to each other."
Aleague,35v68r,littlejib,3,Wed May 13 22:13:19 2015 UTC,"Victory would be your best bet, big crowds, good atmosphere, easy to get to stadium.  WSW fans are very entertaining, they put on the biggest show, but you have to go to paramatta to see them and tickets are sometimes hard to come by. If there is a derby on in any city, try to get tickets"
Aleague,35v68r,patrick478,1 point,Wed May 13 23:45:13 2015 UTC,Great - I really appreciate all the information. Fingers crossed that we won't get unlucky and miss the chance to attend a game in at least one city.
Aleague,35v68r,PooDiePie,2,Wed May 13 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"The Melbourne Derby is traditionally on the final weekend before Christmas at AAMI Park, this would be the best game for you to attend imo."
Aleague,35v68r,Meapa,2,Thu May 14 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have a bit of a ramble because I enjoy getting all emotional about pointless shiz.  So while the regulars of /r/aleague sigh, look down at the ground and shake their heads in anticipation, I shall take it as a sign to begin.  /u/patrick478 is right about Melbourne Victory's fans, though I believe the City fans are much better than anyone gives them credit for.  That concludes my analysis of Melbourne.  My expertise is in Sydney. Here, you could go to either stadium and have a good experience. It depends what kind of fans you like more.  From a completely biased perspective:   the rbb (western sydney wanderers) (note the use of lower case)  This group boasts repetitive chants shouted at low pitches, with many 30 year old men feeling the compulsive need to take their shirts off. They have a lot of hype around them and they are quite loud at times, definitely the most intimidating looking bunch of them all, whether that's a good thing or not. They show up every week with the sole purpose of chanting and putting on a show.  You are more likely to have pyro when the rbb are in town, but this also comes with a tradeoff that you are more likely to get your leg broken by crazed 16 year olds when walking back to the train station.  (I hate sarcasm tags but I will let you know that the previous paragraph isn't completely true, some people tend to get pissy when I have a bit of a joke.)  The Cove (Sydney FC)   These guys boast many different styles of chants, sung (pretty badly tbh, but still sung) at higher pitches. We're far wittier and more spontaneous with our chants, sometimes we feel the need to take off our shirts but it's usually for a good reason and not just part of the regular matchday routine.   If I need to say a downside, our fans can be fickle, we are always very quick to anger and assume the worst of everything. The Wanderers fans tend to not give a shit most of the time and just show up bathing in their own glory.   I'd like to say as a fan who turns up week in week out that I don't mind it when we get all pissy because it just shows how much we care about the club, but I have been told by neutral fans that it makes us look selfish or ""like a bunch of bitches"".   I'd say that we don't show up to entertain the people on the sidelines with our song and dance, but we show up because we want to support the team, and when the team gives nothing back we start questioning our life choices (we have been doing this for 7 years longer than the Wanderers fans have been!).   Thankfully we've had none of the negativity this season due to the team's solid performances.  What I just said is completely biased so to help you make up your mind I'll post some videos of these groups at their best (Home Derbies).  Wanderers:   11th January 2014 (23:27) - This one's pretty long but it's a good showcase of their best. 28th February 2015 (5:31)   Sydney FC:   8th March 2014 (5:13) 18th October 2014 (12:30) - Again this one is quite long but it's a great video.   Also, as a bonus, here are some videos of both groups going at the same time, if you're lucky you'll be able to come watch the derby at Allianz, hands down the best footballing experiences of my life.   8th March 2014 (4:33) 18th October 2014 (3:19)   Also it's much easier to get to Allianz stadium if you're staying in the city so that's a plus."

Aleague,35t6g3,Mello-D,8,Wed May 13 08:26:36 2015 UTC,Honestly this just makes me bitter. The season that both Victory and Sydney do well and need a salary cap increase to keep their squads together the FFA is suddenly willing to negotiate and change the rules.  When Brisbane won last year we were told tough luck.
Aleague,35t6g3,stationhollow,3,Wed May 13 08:49:58 2015 UTC,"I can certainly understand it would seem that way, although what I think you need to understand is we would have welcomed the deal last year this year next year it doesn't really matter. All clubs benefit.   It's certainly a step in the right direction, for all parties.   Edit: I would also assume that with new deals, as well as the success with WSW in the ACL that these things have become of greater importance."
Aleague,35t6g3,hyp-R,3,Wed May 13 10:09:00 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, sure the timing might suck for us but that's what happens. If the FFA give clubs concessions on loyal players then it's a win for everyone...clubs, players and fans.   It's a step in the right direction."
Aleague,35t6g3,Rupro_,3,Wed May 13 23:04:45 2015 UTC,Just luck i would think.  Bargaining agreements have a finite time span and need reworking before a new one is signed.
Aleague,35t6g3,wanderingrhino,1 point,Wed May 13 09:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yeh - can't be held back on change because it would've benefited one or two teams prior, otherwise we'd never have change."
Aleague,35t6g3,Row86,1 point,Wed May 13 22:50:18 2015 UTC,"Its actually got to do with the fact the CBA is up this year but the article does make it seem as though its about big clubs keeping their super stars. I wouldn't think a loyalty clause wouldn't count towards players like FBK more like Archie and will be a bit like the Japanese system. Ie: after X years part of all of their wages are outside the salary cap.  I'd say the whole scouting network concession is PFA crap, too complicated to implement. I mean whats the difference between a player that gets scouted and one that gets offered and how could that be kept track off."

Its not like Tavares and Faty are gone next year cuz even with a salary cap increase we won't be able to afford them. But no, keep feeling super bitter, its really healthy for you and the discussion on this subreddit."
Aleague,35t6g3,sick_yilmaz,3,Wed May 13 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"Tavares and Faty were brought in as injury replacements for Abbas and Ognenovski. Abbas is still contracted for another year and obviously the Ognenovski money is being used elsewhere (unless he gets re-signed, which I doubt). That situation is completely different to Brisbane Roar requesting leniency in the cap so we could keep Berisha which is much more relevant to the posted article discussing ""long-term loyalty payment"" concessions in the salary cap. Perhaps rather than your long rambly post, you could back up your statement by giving better examples? I am not saying you can't, I just think it would be better for the discuss on this subreddit."
Aleague,35t6g3,effsee,0,Wed May 13 23:15:13 2015 UTC,"What kind of ""cap leniency"" are you envisioning would allow you to compete under the cap with a club willing to throw a marquee spot at the player?   At that point you might as well abandon the cap entirely.  I would've thought that ""long term"" would mean 5+ years, and would exist to make it less likely for clubs to be outbid for players they've been developing since they were kids, or need to move on fan favourites like Archie or Matt Simon in the twilight of their careers for the sake of competitiveness.   Being able to throw unlimited money at players after completing just a two year deal would make a mockery of the whole cap."

So those three bays are just people with memberships who are sitting in the active section. Junior blues (kids memeberships) were not included in the sale so that ruled out lots of families. And lots of people just gave up when they heard how hard it'll be. I'm sure it was similar for your presale
Aleague,35s8pt,aninstituteforants,3,Wed May 13 02:16:53 2015 UTC,My dad is an SFS member (not a member of the club) so he wont be going due to missing out.
Aleague,35s8pt,PooDiePie,2,Wed May 13 02:22:54 2015 UTC,"I know a whole family of members going, but they're sitting in Cat A. That's 5 sydney members going but not standing in the active or the 'non-active' away bays. I'm sure there are a significant amount of other members who are doing something similar.  The three bays will be full, and I'm sure there'll be a fair amount of sky blue scattered around the sidelines as well."
Aleague,35s8pt,Shatter_,3,Wed May 13 04:08:26 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, there are 11k members and 3.5k allocated seats. I don't know a single a member who can travel this weekend due to work or other obligations (I know around 10 members well enough to know that), so there was never a chance that over 30% of members were going to buy up tickets.  I am quite certain that if members had been allowed to purchase 2 or more tickets then SFC's allocation would be sold out. Despite not knowing any members that can travel I know half a dozen non-members that want to go but members are refusing to pass on their numbers so that other members get first dibs. I've been contacted three times for my number but decided not to give it out."
Aleague,35s8pt,aninstituteforants,7,Wed May 13 08:01:32 2015 UTC,"Before everyone pulls out the old 'Shit fans' etc, heaps of people missed out who wanted to attend. I even heard from people that they were told allocation was exhausted.  1 ticket per member was a fair way for people to get tickets, but it made it impossible to buy extra tickets."
Aleague,35s8pt,lfc_rbb,2,Wed May 13 05:07:58 2015 UTC,"We had the same thing for our final last season, 1 ticket per member."

Aleague,35s8pt,ScreamHawk,1 point,Thu May 14 14:00:37 2015 UTC,"There are over 29,000 tickets sold and our allocation was only 22k.

There is a final release of tickets at 9am tomorrow morning, around 1000 tickets left from pax reports."

Aleague,35s8pt,own1313,2,Thu May 14 07:54:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is exactly what happened. I think they just decided not to sell bay 15 as away tickets. They're all going to get filled anyway.  Plus, you have to remember that quite a few Sydney members wouldn't want to stand behind the goals for the whole game and they would just buy more expensive sideline tickets so they can sit down and just watch the game with a good view."

Aleague,35sted,filfy_toad,3,Thu May 14 00:36:07 2015 UTC,"Mate & Jaliens are interesting, thought they would've kept them."
Aleague,35sted,Row86,8,Wed May 13 05:29:47 2015 UTC,Jaliens did very well for us for the time he was here but it's a waste of a visa spot for someone that old. Guy's not a natural right back anyways with Kisnorbo and Chapman being first choice centre backs.  Mate's a surprise. He's got injury concerns but thought he did okay for the time that he's played for us. Maybe the club is finally going to understand that okay is not good enough?  Now all we need to do is get rid of Hoffman and Redmayne...
Aleague,35sted,alvinng,2,Wed May 13 05:36:14 2015 UTC,"Spot on with Jaliens. We need a proper RB and he's not first choice CB, takes up a visa spot, so why keep him? I'd really, really like to bring Franjic home. Should be priority #1.  I hope these aren't the only 5 to go. What about Hoffman? Surely we can do better than Clisby? Replace Redmayne with a young keeper, can't be any worse.  I think Germano has to leave as well, the output we get from him isn't visa quality. Look at what Victory, Adelaide, Sydney, Nix and Glory all get out of ALL their visa spots, he's not going to stack up to that. Need 5 players that offer something the Aussies don't.  Kennedy can't play as a lone striker, not isolated like he used to anyway. Got completely nullified in the finals games. Still good for a poach but the way he gets dominated is going to disjoint the team. Need another option there.  Is there a way we can get Koren out of his contract? Not marquee quality, has no impact on most games. Looks a huge, huge error by the club at this stage. We can pay anything for a player, and we sign him for two seasons. Coming off being a bench player in the EPL, too old, not timeless quality like ADP. Horrendous, woeful decision.  I think we'll more than likely lose Mooy as well. That puts the current squad back to 7th/8th quality.  Understand the salary cap limits how much we can change, but still wish this City thing brought more results in the transfer market."
Aleague,35sted,kiac,2,Wed May 13 07:28:15 2015 UTC,Who else is off contract with them?
Aleague,35sted,littlejib,3,Wed May 13 05:40:10 2015 UTC,"The ones that I'm pretty sure are Murdocca, Tando and Novillo (replacement for Duff)."
Aleague,35sted,alvinng,3,Wed May 13 05:45:12 2015 UTC,Full list of off-contract players.  Bolded ones that have not yet left the club.  Not sure if any have re-signed.  Damien Duff Jonathan Germano Massimo Murdocca Iain Ramsay Tando Velaphi Rob Wielaert Paulo Retre  - Retre has signed another year.  Thanks thisphantomfortress. Harry Novillo Kew Jaliens Mate Dugandžić
Aleague,35sted,JediCapitalist,4,Wed May 13 05:54:27 2015 UTC,"Germano i imagine they are waiting on citizenship, if he gets it he may stay if not too injury prone for a visa spot. Mass should retire. Seems to love the club could see him staying on as couch. Tando hopefully resigned. Retre has already signed for another year. Hope Harry stays he's been great fun to watch."
Aleague,35sted,thisphantomfortress,2,Wed May 13 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"I'm split on Harry. He's a very direct player, likes to run at defenders and take shots on goal. Something that we have been lacking before he arrived.  On the other hand, he tries to beat players too often, sometimes even slowing down counter attacks when it would have been better off passing the ball. Definitely needs to improve on his decision making."
Aleague,35sted,alvinng,4,Wed May 13 06:07:24 2015 UTC,"Really? He looked the best player on the pitch against us by far, and looked like his brain was ahead of everyone on your team in what he was trying to do."
Aleague,35sted,hyp-R,1 point,Wed May 13 06:09:09 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Give him a viable option to cross to and he's a killer. I'd even forgive him for his overly ambitious sailing long shots if he just had someone to connect to.
Aleague,35sted,AlbionLoveDen,2,Thu May 14 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"Give Novillo a full pre-season and I'm certain he'll tear up the league next season, you guys should be doing everything to keep him."
Aleague,35sted,so_much_wut,1 point,Wed May 13 06:26:25 2015 UTC,"Would love to keep Germano and you're absolutely right, a non-visa spot suits him.     Novillo earned the right to stay but he has to score at least 7-8 goals next season to stay on after that IMO.     I don't mind Mass as a bench option/depth.  He's a good passer and if we can't find better, keep him another season."
Aleague,35sted,JediCapitalist,2,Wed May 13 06:04:15 2015 UTC,"Dugandzic shoukd still have an Aleague career, suprised he really hasn't blossomed more.    My tip: A reunion with Merrick"
Aleague,35sted,wanderingrhino,3,Wed May 13 07:21:16 2015 UTC,"He's a decent squad player, nothing more. Sadly he seems to be passed his prime, but that could also just be a result of lacking direction/leadership on the pitch."
Aleague,35sted,AlbionLoveDen,2,Thu May 14 00:33:16 2015 UTC,"True, id like to see him as a striker or second striker.  As a winger serms to be deficient on the cross."

The derbies were the only one,  and the 10k was only cracked for Peter Beardsley guest game.  Apart from Croats, nobody supports them.  Im not sure how they propose to garner enough support to cope in a national second tier? Serious question if anybody has a good answer."
Aleague,35si62,wanderingrhino,8,Wed May 13 05:22:26 2015 UTC,"They just don't seem to get it, do they?  They aren't the national body, nor are they really relevant at the moment. I appreciate their ambition to join the top flight, but the more they snidely attack the FFA with shit like this and the whole ""Melbourne Croatia Football Club"" FFA Cup shirts, the more they make the FFA less inclined to help them. Are they really that fucking stupid that they need to be told this? I realise that they are frustrated, but the NSL hurt the game and the A-League (as much as they love the glory days) is doing what it can to bring the fans back.  As for a supporter base, it is mainly Croats, it seems. I'm sure that they know that survival will be difficult without an Anglo supporter base, but they've done seemingly nothing to bridge the gap from being seen as Croatian to being a non-ethnic based club. I know a lot of Anglo-Australians who keep away from teams like Adelaide Raiders here, as they don't seem to have done a lot to incorporate a feeling of Australian-ness. This drives away the potential supporters to other clubs which make them feel more welcome and incorporated as a part of the club.  I'm not trying to cause an issue, but honestly, if the Knights can't see where they've gone wrong, then they should probably be prepared for a long future in the Victorian league and not the top flight.  TL;DR - With promotion off the table, maybe MK should try to conform to what the FFA requires for A-League membership, rather than hurting their chances by undermining every little thing the FFA does."
Aleague,35si62,FootballBallsack,2,Wed May 13 06:55:25 2015 UTC,"Do you blame them? How many HAL and Socceroo players have come from NPL clubs? Yet when players like Massimo Luongo and Tomi Juric become the next big thing for Australian Football clubs like Olympic & APIA barely get a sentence written about them.  I've never understood Aussie Joe's fear of the ethnic boogeyman. I'm not Serb but it doesn't stop me supporting BWE, how does a few boys in their teens/early 20's chanting in their mother tongue suddenly make clubs unacceptable for the administration?"
Aleague,35si62,KennethKanniff,2,Wed May 13 10:43:47 2015 UTC,"I don't blame them for their frustrations, but MK need to know that their bitching won't even help them.  Aussie Joe's ""fear"" of the ethnic boogeyman in my opinion stems a lot from simply being unable to speak whatever language is being spoken.  I'm not gonna come out with some line of ""we're in STRAYA, speak English mate"" or anything like that, but you can't tell me that a group of people who all speak English and choose to speak in Insert language here are really going to be seen as ""inclusive"" for the English-only speakers.  I've intentionally spoken in public in the broken Danish I've learnt, just to see the reaction. People get naturally quite paranoid that they are being spoken about and shit. I'm not suggesting that these supporters or club officials are in anyway talking badly about the people around them, but it's still the fact that speaking within earshot of people who obviously have no idea of the language will make them feel excluded.  PS - I saw the Adelaide City-Brisbane Strikers FFA Cup fixture and was sat by some young guys speaking Italian. From what I can remember about High School Italian, they weren't exactly talking about the football."
Aleague,35si62,FootballBallsack,5,Wed May 13 11:38:25 2015 UTC,"Essentially they are placing the development of the Matildas and Socceroos as the primary goal for Australian Football, and our youth should receive a good, early footballing education in-country, before they leave to develop in overseas acadamies.  They criticise the MLS model, and instead point towards the Japanese Football Association's development of football in Japan as the example to follow.  The attack the idea of a national curriculum, and the enforcement of the ""dutch 4-3-3""  its a surprisingly logical and well-thought out document from such a whiny and self-inflated club. i agree with pretty much all their points"

Aleague,35rwoh,Boggyboy,3,Wed May 13 00:25:33 2015 UTC,"Where I was sitting, a young family and their ~5yo daughter took it upon themselves to move due to 3 nearby supporters swearing their heads off at the ref/city players.  It isn't just football either, I have seen some parents feel very uncomfortable at AFL matches (although I tend to hang out in the FGS bar in the MCC) and also at the cricket (world cup final), where a dad had to try distract his son from 5-6 drunk kiwis sitting in front of me.   As much as I love live sport, I think parents are being driven away by fan behaviour, even if it is just mild swearing. So when that escalates to flares and projectiles, I think the game will repel its young family supporter base.  This is Australia, not Eastern London. Why anyone would aspire to be a football hooligan is beyond me.   With that being said, the vast majority of Victory fans created a fantastic atmosphere on Friday."

The thing I find funny is that they've divided it up into subsections to make travel easier and yet, WA seemed to have done fine with allowing their teams from the middle of nowhere in at the Third Round. SA had two clubs from Mount Gambier play and that wasn't an issue..."
Aleague,35p6lt,suicidal_smrtcar,1 point,Tue May 12 11:51:47 2015 UTC,The qld zone is so complex is due the long distance travelling between our major cities.  You can't expect a side from say cairns travel to the Gold Coast just to play one game and then return the next day. It's just not economical. These players also have other jobs and probably won't be able to times off.

Aleague,35onvq,nettogewicht,6,Tue May 12 09:04:28 2015 UTC,It's not only giving up what they love. It's their source of income. Why not draw out your career to earn a few more bucks. It's not like he's earning bullshit money over here.
Aleague,35onvq,SlothSorcerer,1 point,Tue May 12 10:20:57 2015 UTC,He could join the team that wins next season though.
Aleague,35onvq,Nelfoos5,5,Wed May 13 05:12:26 2015 UTC,He's had 11 goals this season somehow. And with significantly less game time than any striker on that level. I don't think this stat tells the full story about his form and fitness and ability at his age but I think the club is mad if they don't give him another year based on that. And they will. He has actually earned it.
Aleague,35onvq,vendilion,10,Tue May 12 11:31:58 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't want him at City.  Not saying that bitterly, but if we get a new striker they have to essentially be in their prime.  We've got enough out of form strikers playing in a system that doesn't suit them as it is."

He definitely still has it, no doubt. Would hate to see him finish his career anywhere but Victory.  I do however think this is really poor to bring up the week of the GF - not the week for these kinds of discussions with the media. Keep it under your hat for a week buddy.

Aleague,35onvq,JuiceSpringsteen8,2,Tue May 12 07:06:44 2015 UTC,"In passing. I more mean that his inside knowledge of the team and practices at Victory would be a big enticement for teams hoping to beat them next season, and he's not looking to take much of a pay cut, so that market will be limited to the clubs that can afford to have an aging player for impact and information purposes.

Aleague,35kxrs,ac1997,1 point,Mon May 11 11:33:46 2015 UTC,I remember Archie Thompson polled 2nd one season where he was injured most of the year.

Aleague,35kxrs,Row86,4,Mon May 11 10:26:32 2015 UTC,I would have had FBK and Mooy in before Carrusca tbh. Wasn't even our best player this season since he was out injured so much
Aleague,35kxrs,ahoyhoy5,7,Mon May 11 13:00:13 2015 UTC,I was surprised Janko wasn't in the top 5 I mean he did win the golden boot. I thought Cirio had a better year then Carrusca and certainly FBK did
Aleague,35kxrs,-Volumes_,2,Mon May 11 10:28:39 2015 UTC,Yeh good point about Janko. Do we have the right voting system in place?
Aleague,35kxrs,Row86,2,Mon May 11 10:32:45 2015 UTC,"Jankos goals were all apart of a team performance, i mean he did well off the ball, helped in build up. But we would have still got most of those goals without him. Burns created goal as well as scored them"
Aleague,35kxrs,littlejib,1 point,Mon May 11 10:52:28 2015 UTC,Janko has been brilliant but he's definitely been the beneficiary of a gameplan that suits his style of play and a team that's dominating most games they play this season.
Aleague,35kxrs,vendilion,1 point,Mon May 11 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though at the same time, only he could have scored some of those goals, a lesser striker would have a system be built around him"

Not by filling up a stadium with people who are only interested in one or two games.

Foxtel never wanted WB v Freo moved from Sunday because they know it would be a flop. Meanwhile with the A-League grand final at AAMI Park, that means even more people watching from home. If it was on Friday night they would be losing viewers of Ess v North, as you would think alot of people would be going to the GF itself, which would mean less viewers for either game at home.  The way its set up has given Foxtel the opportunity to achieve the maximum amount of viewers this weekend. Ess v North on Friday Night, Sydney v Geelong in Sydney on Sat night and then the A-League Grand Final with a restricted attendance on Sunday.

Its their home stadium, and unlike Etihad, its a soccer/rugby specific stadium. I mean.. if Perth Glory didn't cheat, and we somehow scraped into the GF and won hosting rights, I'd be more than happy to have it played at nib Stadium, not Domain Stadium.  The AFL has a contract with Etihad Stadium that makes them first priority until the AFL buys the stadium for $1 in 2025 (on March 8). If this happens continuously until 2025, I wouldn't be surprised if the AFL goes full retard and bars the FFA from using it.   Melbourne Victory wanted a rectangular stadium, they got it. They wont use it for a final."
Aleague,35kwxs,iMattster,2,Tue May 12 06:13:19 2015 UTC,"Salty? I've found 99% of Victory fans are thrilled it's at AAMI. Sure, there's a vocal few here and there having a whinge but the vast majority know it was the FFA's fuck up and are super excited that the game gets to be played in a proper football stadium packed to the brim with members. The atmosphere is going to be incredible. And given it's quite likely to be the last/only Grand Final held there it's going to be a memorable one."
Aleague,35kwxs,Stebby_333,1 point,Tue May 12 15:13:53 2015 UTC,"People that don't actually understand the situation are salty at the AFL. It's up to everyone to educate them so they can best redirect their anger to the regularly inept FFA. Just look how they cocked up the Melbourne Semi Final (Victory members restricted to 1 ticket per membership, Heart 4 per membership. Equally allocated active bays despite it being a Victory home game and Victory asking for the allocation to remain the same as regular season matches thus resulting in majority of active supporters having to move to level 3.)  You can argue all you want that Bulldogs v Freo will be lucky if it gets 16,000 and that they should move it to be nice, but really the FFA should've booked a venue in each state for the day of the grand final and then release the bookings as it became apparent which ones wouldn't be required.  The fact that the AFL had a match scheduled on the day FFA originally incorrectly had earmarked is sketchy when you take the AFL's narrative of the situation into account, but irrelevant regardless.  As for Victory wanting a rectangular stadium, yeah, but they wanted one that held >35,000 people. The state Government was initially pushing to make AAMI Park only hold 20,000. And there was a big back and forth and eventually Victory agreed to the 30,000 capacity with the ability to expand one day.  Fingers crossed one day they do expand it to 50,000. Won't hold my breath though as only one team that uses it is capable of filling it.  Storm won't because League is largely irrelevant here.  Manchester City's Financial Fair Play loophole are the 3rd worst attended team in the league, so its safe to assume they'll never fill it no matter who their disinterested marquee may be."

I was standing in aisle 3 on level 1, this was on the a full 7 bays across and two levels down from where the main North Terrace. I'd say at least 4,000 people were directly affected by it (not to mention the hundreds outside the stadium who had to dodge flying flares).    This was the worst behaviour I've ever seen at a sporting event and I dare say you'd struggle to find worse behaviour at  sporting event in Melbourne in the last decade."

Friday was one instance of that, and would have been avoided if the FFA listened to the clubs suggestions on supporter layout. It's more relevant than you know."
Aleague,35kjke,anonadzii,14,Mon May 11 07:35:25 2015 UTC,"What you and many don't realise is over the last 10 years there have been multiple times the worlds of casuals and scarfers have collided.     This wasn't 'scarfers and casuals colliding'. This wasn't like Western Sydney in 2013 when they attacked our pub when it was full of scarfers, before Melbourne's casuals were there. Nor is this like December 2013, when Melbourne attacked Western Sydney's pub on Bourke St and there were official jerseys going toe to toe with Fred Perry's and Stone Island's. This was reckless endangerment of men, women and children, and for at least some, this was there first and last A-League experience.     You say in another comment that those who threw the flares, bottles and chairs ""felt tough cause they had the terrace standing behind them."" Does this not suggest there is something fundamentally wrong with the way the terrace is operating in its current state? It appears that young men, who you are probably correct in acknowledging are not well known to 'terrace leaders' (given the massive amounts of casuals you see on game days these days), feel they are able to come into the North Terrace and endanger the people sitting below with apparently no concern that they will be pulled up by the terrace leaders or pointed out to terrace leaders by fellow members.     I should state that this incident on Friday was out of the norm. The North Terrace has been extremely well behaved all season (and last) and you might not believe me but I even cancelled my membership last season in protest of the restrictions placed upon the North Terrace, and I definitely do not support returning to those restrictions (or anything similar) because of a small minority's actions on Friday night. Hell, I don't even give a fuck about your little fights, so long as you keep it far from Joe Public's eye.  However, I think there is more the North Terrace itself can be doing to stop shit like this from happening again in the stadium. They can stop using videos from fights in North Terrace Melbourne's compilation videos and they should have said in their statement following Friday's incident that they are willing to point out to police anyone who throws a flare or endangers anyone in a serious way. And, yes, though if the FFA had left seating allocations the way they should have been then this would have never occurred, nonetheless, the FFA didn't make these idiots throw chairs and flares.  Shit happens and bottles and flares will be thrown again. But I fear that if it is not condemned loudly by the North Terrace on social media and on the terraces, angry young kids who have too much testosterone will increasingly see the North Terrace and Melbourne Victory games as a place where they can live out their hooligan fantasies. Because, as you have said, thinking a group of people are behind you and support you can make you feel pretty tough."
Aleague,35kjke,itisknown__,3,Mon May 11 09:33:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry my phone keeps sending things prematurely, really need to update this cracked screen.   On the contrary I do believe this was an incident where scarfers and casuals worlds collided. The reason I say that is because this all would have been avoided had they been allocated seating where they were meant to be. One of the big reasons Etihad and the Club don't like active support on level 3 is due to the safety concerns of projectiles being thrown. It's a well known trait of any terrace to throw confetti and streamers and EMPTY plastic bottles in the air in celebration. Then there are those who take it further and decided to throw objects that can cause injury. This happened the other night, by a few casual idiots who have no understanding of the repercussions of their actions. Had they been on level 1, we would not be having this conversation. For example, people in the terrace break chairs and throw them every game at Etihad (I don't know why) but it generally doesn't cause any harm. The fact they were doing it from Level 3 made it more dangerous and bought it to a lot of people's attention. You are right, no one made them throw things, but it has been known to happen almost every time the terrace has been on L3. Although yes it was not quite the same as the other incidents you mentioned in terms of world colliding, but yeah that's where I was coming from in saying that.   I think it's more of a sociological problem that people use the cover of a large group like a terrace to cause trouble. It will always be difficult to control the actions of a collective, especially when that collective contains non regulars. And keep in mind, the terrace leaders are only that due to longevity and loyalty, they don't get paid for the work they do and they only have as much control as the respect they get on the day. They also don't have eyes at the back of their head, which is why we have employed a multi capi system now, unlike the early days where we had one guy in charge. Ever since then, the behaviour in the terrace has been much better.   A few years ago, during the BWB decline, there was no leadership and stupid shit like this happened all the time. Fortunately it was a time in the clubs history where we weren't to successful, and Etihad would rarely get huge crowds. There literally were less witnesses, and ultimately less victims. Per capita though, I'd say there were more victims. As an organised terrace we have jumped leaps and bounds but there will always be incidents. We can only hope to learn from each one.   I don't like the idea of ratting out people to the police because it sets a bad precedent, especially considering the unjust bans that get handed down. I know for a fact that is where the hesitation to do that comes from. Also I'm not sure how much they could help if the people aren't regulars, i mean they might be able to point them out of a lineup but I can't see it getting to that. As for the fights in the videos, I agree. There's no need for that shit to be shown to anyone IMO.   I should reiterate I really don't condone what happened and I hope nothing of the sort happens again. Nor do I think any less of you because of your opinion, I just have the believe people are making an awful lot out of it."

Aleague,35kjke,Row86,7,Mon May 11 08:14:50 2015 UTC,"One of the main things that disturbs me is the inference that people who have already been banned by the FFA or Etihad, seemingly have no problems getting tickets or gaining entry to the stadium.  There is a solution, however ordinary fans will not like it because it will create waiting times for buying tickets and entry.  I was in Italy last year and I am not sure it happens at all grounds but I am assured that this happens at most.  I was going to an Italian cup game in Bologna and to buy a ticket you have to produce ID, they enter your details into the system and if everything comes up clear, you can buy a ticket.  And then you also have to show ID as you enter the stadium.  Banned hooligans just have zero chance to enter the stadium.  The bad part is that it takes forever to buy a ticket and enter the stadium.  If you want safety, it is an unfortunate byproduct of trying to ensure this.  Australia is not Europe and we do have a different culture, but there are some that would like to act like they do at home.  I have been to many games throughout Europe (I live in Spain) and it is only certain countries where this behaviour is prevalent.  Countries like Greece, Turkey, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Czech Republic, Italy (even with their efforts) among others are the places you will find most of the flares and things like that.  You rarely find it in Spain, France, Germany, Belgium or the Northern countries.  I am not saying it doesn't happen, but not with the regularity in certain other countries.  It is not a football thing, it is a cultural thing.  Some European cultures are more inclined to do it than others.  I was at a Prague derby between Sparta and Dukla Praha and the Sparta Praha ""Ultras"" had a net in front of them because they like to throw things.    Even with the scoreboard and the ground announcer telling them to stop throwing pyrotechnics, they continued and there was not one security person there to stop them.  There was another section of the crowd closer to us that made some kind of demonstration near half time with a lot of flares and such, and the only thing a security guy took away from them were a couple of flash-bangs.  Everything else they let go.  It is a different culture there and I must say that at no time did I feel scared or in danger.  It was just what was happening.  It is clear though that that kind of thing would not fly at an Australian game.  And yet some people are determined to try and make it happen.  This is what needs to stop.  Someone will get hurt and it won't be funny anymore.  Like when the Russian goalie Akinfeev was hit by a flare earlier this year and even the fans from where it came were shocked and they attacked the guy who threw it.  Hopefully they learned something from that.  Sorry for the rant, but I needed to put my two cents in."

A bit of a stretch, if I may. It was within 5-7 metres of them, sure.   ""Never before had I felt unsafe at a sporting event. ""   Okay   ""The match became irrelevant. I zipped up my jacket to conceal my strip, knowing if we waited until full-time to leave, the odds were high we’d be beaten up.""   What  Anyway, I was there and you guys fully heard what I thought about the situation - fucking deplorable if you where up there and throwing shit at your own fans.   I think it's a bit of a fucking cop out to say that although this happened it wouldn't have happened if the FFA did X, Y and Z. It's fine and all, but there is a moral responsibility that each and everyone has to ensure what they are doing is right within that setting.   It was wrong what was happening there that night.  Anyyyyyyyyyyway - it happened, lets move on. If this is something you can be that 'scared' of, I probably wouldn't go out on a Friday/Saturday night down Chapel, or head to Broady/Coburg during the day."
Aleague,35kjke,hyp-R,2,Mon May 11 09:34:11 2015 UTC,"You can't put blame on the FFA for this. It was the fault of anyone who threw something (whether it be a chair, flare, bottle, hot dog, chiko roll etc.)  The seating arrangement was unfavourable, but it didn't cause the problems. The fans could have easily stood up on level 3 and not thrown anything, nothing bad would have happened."

It's a shame a few idiots got overly rowdy and ruined it for those in a few bays below them, but 1. If the FFA had listened to Victory's requests on supporter layout this never would have happened 2. Pretty sure only a few hundred fit per aisle on L2, yet it seems as though half the stadium was there considering all the comments and articles I've read about it. I was one of the other 50,000 people not under the idiots, and I went wild and had a great time. This all just seems like a huge over reaction. Truth is I've seen much much worse inside and outside the gates, both by and to Victory supporters over the last 10 years. Maybe because this happened to the more well off folk on level 2 that people are making so much out of it..."

The ""This is Australia"" argument is bollocks, this is Football and these practices are consistent world wide (even in the USA with their unique sport culture). Our supporters have been brought up on a culture that extends beyond AFL and NRL and will adopt and evolve what they see happening overseas, whether you find it to your liking or not.

FFA just books each home stadium for that night.   Solves the issue of Sunday afternoons being the worst football time slot on a weekend, Saturday nights let you party/drown your sorrow afterwards, and gives the A-League a recognizable date on the calender much like every other sport in Australia."

Aleague,35k87o,wanderingrhino,17,Mon May 11 04:02:19 2015 UTC,"MKFC surprised at promotion/relegation being ruled out for next 20 years. MKFC questions why FFA has not aimed to implement a National second division.    Because at the moment football in this country isnt anywhere near being able to fund and sustain a second tier competition. Lets focus on the A-League first, build it up to a sustainable 14-16 team competition where each club is doing relatively well then lets think about a 2nd tier competition. Rome wasnt built in a day. A second tier comp right now could take football in this country 10 years backwards.    MKFC concerned why compensation for players was not addressed.    Something the FFA should look at but not exactly top of the list.    MKFC concerned by further centralisation of the game and potential abolition of state federations.    Hold up, so you want a national 2nd tier (which, I assume you want to be apart of) but the FFA trying to improve Football Victoria is bad?   MKFC confirms that the Club was not consulted by FFA prior to WOFP publication.   Should they have consulted every NPL team or only the former NSL ones? You arent relevant anymore Melbourne Knights.    I dont agree with everything the FFA does and I think their treatment of state league sides over the past 10 years has been poor but this is just the Knights having a whinge. Football in this country is doing well, we just hosted and won an Asian Cup. The future is bright."
Aleague,35k87o,-Volumes_,7,Mon May 11 04:35:48 2015 UTC,"One small thing. A national second tier is crucial, at some point in the future. But, and this is vital, you can't let the talent gap between divisions grow too large before you implement it otherwise you end up with two tiers in the one league, a la AFL. It also helps to raise the standard of grassroots competitions."
Aleague,35k87o,gorgeous-george,1 point,Mon May 11 08:28:03 2015 UTC,"I agree a national second tier is crucial for the future but I think it should be atleast 20 years away (depending on the growth of the game of coarse this could be shortened or extended.)   I think that improving the A-League directly helps NPL clubs. I mean I am not involved in any and the east coast might be different but if the A-League improves then the current fringe players wont be able to compete at A-League level and then they will hopefully get picked up by an NPL club. Also some A-League players (ie Steven McGarry) get picked up by an A-League club from overseas then they enjoy living here and so when the retire professionally, but want to continue playing socially, they do at NPL level."
Aleague,35k87o,-Volumes_,2,Mon May 11 09:22:27 2015 UTC,Something the FFA should look at but not exactly top of the list.   Should be a priority. What's the use of developing a player from the age of 8 to seniors when an HAL club can come along and pick him up for dick?
Aleague,35k87o,KennethKanniff,3,Mon May 11 12:06:14 2015 UTC,Something the FFA should look at but not exactly top of the list.

Aleague,35k87o,-Volumes_,3,Mon May 11 05:10:28 2015 UTC,If you read the press release they said they had community forums and spoke to all Australians and all stakeholders.  In actual fact not even the state federations were contacted directly.  I have a friend who works for Football NSW - very disappointed.  Not even with the potential restructure - just with lack of engagement.
Aleague,35k87o,rezplzk,2,Mon May 11 05:18:49 2015 UTC,"I only skimmed over it because ive been drowning in uni work.   Thats very disappointing then. To improve football everyone needs to work together, the state federations need to be consulted and their opinions considered. Theres no point in the FFA going in one direction and the state leagues in another."
Aleague,35k87o,-Volumes_,2,Mon May 11 05:25:14 2015 UTC,You have valid points.  Most of us here are pretty open to debate/new knowledge and all we really care about is the quality of Australian league/players/administrators improving.  Whether we agree with MKs or believe it's self-interest - it doesn't really matter as opinions are like assholes.  What's important is whatever the FFA do it's for football's interest.  Not just their wallets.
Aleague,35k87o,rezplzk,2,Mon May 11 05:58:11 2015 UTC,Why would a club outside the A-League spend any money on development then?   Dont most get a heap of money from youth fees
Aleague,35k87o,littlejib,2,Mon May 11 05:08:40 2015 UTC,Not heaps - they do receive fees from parents but these are not real money spinners.  Enough to make small profit.   The question is:  if they just make small profit and have no potential upside what desire is their for the club to produce the best possible players they can?  They are better off hiring mediocre cheap coaches and maximising profits.  If they could sell and receive transfer fees they are aligned to produce the best possible players to maximise return.  I have mentioned this before but in the days of real transfer fees and player sales more focus was on youth development as most clubs balanced the books selling their best each year.
Aleague,35k87o,rezplzk,3,Mon May 11 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah i understand, I would like to see profit sharing at the least, NPL teams pass players to the aleague teams, they get a cut of the next sale. Though aleague teams just usually release players to go overseas though"
Aleague,35k87o,littlejib,2,Mon May 11 05:23:38 2015 UTC,Though aleague teams just usually release players to go overseas though   That's because lots of the players are on 1 year deals/free agents at end of season.  If A-League clubs committed to longer deals they could get transfer fees.  Saying that - no local xfer fees is ridiculous.
Aleague,35k87o,rezplzk,3,Mon May 11 05:55:53 2015 UTC,Sydney were willing (still are i think) to let antonis go overseas free. A few others have been released for free. Most others are nominal fees
Aleague,35k87o,littlejib,2,Mon May 11 05:58:36 2015 UTC,Do you know why?  Here is a very good footballer who has spent many years in your system improving.  I fail to see how you should not cash in on that.  Maybe they had an agreement previously before he signed a new deal?
Aleague,35k87o,rezplzk,1 point,Mon May 11 06:00:38 2015 UTC,"I think its an agreement, we let him go to parma (for a nominal fee) a year ago, but then pulled him back on a technicallity (late fees) when we realized how bad their system was"

Aleague,35k87o,littlejib,3,Mon May 11 12:40:06 2015 UTC,Whilst NPL clubs do get a decent amount of kesh from rego fees (usually around $1800 a player) it's still not enough to cover costs because only die-hard's buy merch & they don't have the benefit of ticket sales because a good crowd in the NPL usually consists of about 500 people.  For example when NPL clubs such as Olympic go overseas to play in tournaments like the MIC Cup in Spain players and parents are still required to pay an excessive amount to cover the costs of travel and accom.

Aleague,35k87o,kiac,2,Mon May 11 06:51:16 2015 UTC,never get anywhere near the A-League   For someone sporting an Australian flair it's ironic that you can dismiss a club's opinion/suggestions so easily considering how much they have contributed to Australian football.  Maybe you are young and don't know any better.  Also the FFA state they consulted ALL clubs and stakeholders.  When in fact they lied and did not.
Aleague,35k87o,rezplzk,6,Mon May 11 05:03:56 2015 UTC,"I played state league football in NSW for 10 years so you can leave your holier than thou attitude at the door mate.  The FFA contacted A-League clubs, and the public were invited to make submissions, it says so in this article. Its unrealistic to expect the FFA to contact every single state-league level club in the country and wait for their feedback.  Clubs like Blacktown City, Marconi etc. have given just as much if not more to Australian football over the years, and I don't see them throwing a tantrum like Melbourne Knights over this."

Aleague,35k87o,rezplzk,1 point,Mon May 11 05:53:44 2015 UTC,"I think the youth and transfer system is infact fair.

State league clubs aren't even coming close to that sort of commitment from a-league club owners.

AC Milan was founded as a cricket club :)  The only reason modern A-League fans don't want the old brigade to return is that they will get promoted and dominate the A-League again after a few years - and they will divide existing A-League club fan-bases.    They still have the knowledge and cash to develop youngsters.

Edit: thanks for all the tips fellas! Richmond station it is then. I was going to do the cove march but I think flight arrival won't allow it.
Aleague,35jecg,mikhael74,3,Mon May 11 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, from Southern Cross get a Flinders Street train and change at Flinders Street for a Richmond train (which has a ton of different lines running through it, think Redfern if my Sydney geography serves me right...). To be honest, it's walkable distance from Flinders (~20 minute walk) but Richmond is closer (5 minute walk)."
Aleague,35jecg,itisknown__,3,Mon May 11 01:44:27 2015 UTC,yep barely a 5 min walk from richmond
Aleague,35jecg,itsehsteve,3,Mon May 11 01:45:12 2015 UTC,Either take the South Morang / Hurstbridge / Eltham line and it'll go through 2 stations I think then get off at Jollimont Station (MCG) and walk across the grass or you can jump on a bunch of the lines that go out East and get off at Richmond Station and it's a shorter walk.  Make sure it's actually Richmond Station and not North or West Richmond that you go to.
Aleague,35jecg,Row86,3,Mon May 11 01:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yep that's spot on. Just head straight to Richmond. Can catch any of the Alamein, Belgrave, Cranbourne, Frankston, Glen Waverley, Lilydale, Pakenham and Sandringham lines to get there. About 3-5 min walk to the ground."
Aleague,35jecg,hyp-R,2,Mon May 11 01:57:30 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about him guys, I'll just tell you straight up.  Frankston is a beautiful place to stay, a walk to the station as well. Taxi everywhere as public transport is expensive.  ;)"

Aleague,35jecg,Row86,1 point,Mon May 11 07:54:54 2015 UTC,Someone posted a Sydney area ticket for $400. On the page he put a picture of the ticket with his name and Ticketek account number. People looked him up and he had won something in the past where the club automatically upgraded him to premium membership.  Also the barcode was clearly visible. He basically gave out a free ticket to whoever shows up the earliest.  Hope he gets some serious backlash for this.

Paid $500 to some random and then the ticket was cancelled and he lost his money.

It is the marquee games that are going to get people like me to try it out, I can't say that an apparently match against Newcastle mid season really does not seem like the sort of game that will have me thinking about seeing what the local game is like beyond the Socceroos. Not to mention the fact that the biggest thing my friends who do regularly go to A League games talk about is how the supporter groups show no respect for the casual fan."
Aleague,35gz1q,Azza_,2,Sun May 10 23:43:47 2015 UTC,Got to a Melbourne Derby at AAMI. You'll be hooked.
Aleague,35gz1q,deutscheaux,16,Mon May 11 00:33:24 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. AAMI Park Grand Final is the easy call. Guaranteed to sell out, appeases the loyal fans, gets out of the way of AFL. Does nothing to grow the game to the casual supporters nor convert them into paid up members. Weak as piss from the FFA."
Aleague,35gz1q,DolphinGiraffe,15,Mon May 11 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"No. Although Etihad was their first choice and FFA ""settled"" for AAMI Park, it's actually the better call. And it's not ""weak"". They didn't book Etihad ahead of time and the AFL has priority. Bad luck.  Whether you experience this Final at the stadium or on TV it will actually show the casual fans how good the A-League can be at its peak in a proper stadium, not a half full MCG. Give me a packed out football stadium any day."
Aleague,35gz1q,Azza_,-10,Mon May 11 02:06:30 2015 UTC,"Well, they did book Etihad but the AFL decided to book over the top of it, but that's a moot point.  75k+ at the MCG > 30k at AAMI. It's not even a question. Hell, I'd rather see 60k at the G than 30k at AAMI. Choosing AAMI Park is a decision in fear that the sport doesn't have the support that the league chiefs claim the sport has."
Aleague,35gz1q,littlejib,11,Sun May 10 08:11:59 2015 UTC,From a Victory member who has been to many games at AAMI and Etihad and the Liverpool game at the MCG. I would rather AAMI any day of the week. I despise having to watch games at an AFL stadium. The atmosphere is atrocious.
Aleague,35gz1q,Azza_,12,Sun May 10 08:31:06 2015 UTC,"The MCG is the worst place to watch football, would rather watch it on TV."
Aleague,35gz1q,stationhollow,3,Sun May 10 08:45:08 2015 UTC,"I vehemently disagree, but you're entitled to your opinion."
Aleague,35gz1q,Nousernames-left,11,Sun May 10 11:36:39 2015 UTC,"I thought they booked the wrong weekend, and there is a game that was always scheduled for that day at the ehihad.  Adding to that the AFL own Ehihad"
Aleague,35gz1q,stationhollow,3,Sun May 10 10:26:55 2015 UTC,"The A-League booked the final at Etihad for the 10th of May. The AFL knew of this initial booking. The A-League then changed the booking to the following week, informed Etihad themselves of the change of booking, but did not explicitly tell the AFL. The AFL then made their fixture for the 2015 season, with matches fixtured at Etihad on both Saturday and Sunday of this week, and Friday, Saturday and Sunday of next week.   And the AFL doesn't own Etihad for another 10 years."
Aleague,35gz1q,Nousernames-left,-4,Sun May 10 10:32:59 2015 UTC,Adding to that the AFL own Ehihad   You mean they will be given Etihad by the government (absolutely ridiculous if you ask me).
Aleague,35gz1q,stationhollow,7,Sun May 10 08:53:40 2015 UTC,AFL is purchasing Ethiad compared to AMMI which was just given to soccer and rugby by the Government
Aleague,35gz1q,PooDiePie,1 point,Sun May 10 09:40:27 2015 UTC,Are you sure about that? I'm thought the deal with the government over Etihad was essentially you play games here for however long and we then give it to you.  Also there is a big difference between the AFL owning the stadium outright and what AAMI is doing with rugby and football.
Aleague,35gz1q,Azza_,2,Sun May 10 23:52:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah AFL is definitely paying it off, because in recent equalisation conversations the AFL talked about purchasing Etihad stadium early"
Aleague,35gz1q,PooDiePie,1 point,Mon May 11 02:12:12 2015 UTC,But was that actually paying more or just paying their usual fees in advance?
Aleague,35gz1q,Azza_,5,Mon May 11 05:18:10 2015 UTC,I have no interest in this constant debate between sports. It will be an incredible Final and that's that.
Aleague,35gz1q,fnurtfnurt,5,Mon May 11 05:21:12 2015 UTC,"Exclusivity for a big event can cause hype. Many people will watch on TV and think, ""I wish I was there"", then proceed to attend games next season and possibly buy memberships."
Aleague,35gz1q,fnurtfnurt,4,Mon May 11 05:31:59 2015 UTC,Nothing like bums on seats though.
Aleague,35gz1q,nbg91,3,Sun May 10 08:55:33 2015 UTC,I think it'd be best at Etihad. A big crowd for a big event. But AAMI is the next best (and only other fair) option. It isn't bad given the circumstances.
Aleague,35gz1q,aussieaussie1,1 point,Sun May 10 08:41:56 2015 UTC,I think the MCG on Friday night is the best alternative given the unavailability of Etihad. Use it as a chance to grow the game rather than a pat on the back to the loyal supporters.
Aleague,35gz1q,imwatters,2,Sun May 10 08:45:38 2015 UTC,"Will every Victory season ticket holder get a ticket to the final? if not, it's completely unacceptable."
Aleague,35gz1q,imwatters,3,Sun May 10 09:59:54 2015 UTC,Yes. It's one ticket per member and there are two full days of priority member sales before the public sale on Wednesday.

Aleague,35h46u,codemonk,12,Sun May 10 13:09:18 2015 UTC,It's engrained sadly. Heck until two or three years ago I wouldn't have thought twice before using faggot or gay as an insult.  This kind of stuff is on the way out but we have years to go yet. Hope our stadiums are amongst the first places where it stops completely.
Aleague,35h46u,PooDiePie,9,Sun May 10 14:18:26 2015 UTC,Are there any openly gay A-league players? Not of the top of my head but I would imagine they would get a bit of stick from dickhead fans sadly. If they come out that is.
Aleague,35h46u,red-john,5,Sun May 10 10:03:54 2015 UTC,"Relevant part to /r/aleague.    Former Matilda Sally Shipard, who spent 10 years playing soccer for her country, says her team was always completely accepting of her sexuality. According to her, the situation would have been very different in the Socceroos, where she knows at least one player who has hidden his sexuality.  ‘He doesn’t think that he would’ve gotten to where he did if he had been open about his sexuality—which kinda sucked hearing,’ says Shipard.   Probably don't speculate on who this is."
Aleague,35h46u,littlejib,7,Sun May 10 08:26:33 2015 UTC,Probably don't speculate on who this is.   That's all anyone is going to do.  i wonder how far they had to go to hide it though. Tell no teammates? Take a female friend with you to the end of season ball?  edit: Called it
Aleague,35h46u,ac1997,21,Sun May 10 08:35:09 2015 UTC,Probably don't speculate on who this is.   Surely it's Timmy Cahill - he's the best at head(ers).
Aleague,35h46u,sydneyblueboy,8,Sun May 10 09:13:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of people assume female footballers are gay, and most women's football fans don't care if they are, yet homosexuality among male athletes is so rare that it still causes players to hide their sexuality away.  Sad, really."
Aleague,35h46u,miaowface,4,Sun May 10 13:57:59 2015 UTC,Probably don't speculate on who this is. Harry Kewell
Aleague,35h46u,masturgreat,-1,Sun May 10 09:05:30 2015 UTC,Zelko Kalac?

Aleague,35gg8d,vendilion,6,Sun May 10 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"But you don't just sigh, you come on reddit and comment about it so it clearly bothers you and a lot of other people too. In fact you've commented 3 times for just this one article, who knows how many other times you have done it for other articles/comments. You are easily the easiest person to bait on r/aleague, the irony is you're one of the biggest trolls on here looking to bait people yourself."

Aleague,35gg8d,CheapTrick32,-2,Sun May 10 05:51:07 2015 UTC,Roar? no chance of a rivalry with them. This ain't rugby league or rugby union.

Everybody nods in agreement because he's technically correct. Chyeahhhhhh.  It's the same as the other week when he said if SFC didn't have injuries they would have won. It's the worst sort of arrogance. We would have won if... We would have won but... We are the best because we set an arbitrary time frame from when we started winning. We're the best but we had ACL so we didn't win but we definitely would have and we're still the best.  I don't cop that. Call it bait, mind games, whatever, it's all bullshit."

Aleague,35f8mz,RedendBlack,11,Sun May 10 04:51:50 2015 UTC,When did damn and hell become swears? Soft.
Aleague,35f8mz,ragsta,1 point,Sun May 10 04:43:27 2015 UTC,"People were expelled/suspended from my public school system growing up for using hell, damn, and ass. As a result, I included them."
Aleague,35f8mz,stationhollow,1 point,Sun May 10 07:38:46 2015 UTC,"When I was younger I lived in the US for a couple of years. I remember having a sleepover with some friends and making too much noise. Dad got woken up and yelled ""Shut the hell up"". I remember my friends cowering a bit since he said it in an angry tone of voice. One then whispers ""dude, your dad swears curses all the time"".   Before that I didn't even know anyone thought it could be a bad word."
Aleague,35f8mz,aninstituteforants,8,Sat May 9 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Premier League, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place."
