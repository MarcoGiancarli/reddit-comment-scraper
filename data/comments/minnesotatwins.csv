minnesotatwins,3e4tfx,thepaloalto,9,Tue Jul 21 23:29:41 2015 UTC,"He's a good player, but his career OPS drops .140 points away from Coors field. Couple that with his contract and injury history, it's not worth giving up anything significant for him."
minnesotatwins,3e4tfx,gopherman23,3,Wed Jul 22 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"Let me offer a counter-argument: Maybe.  Hear me out here. Obviously Gibson/Sano are a no-go. But say they could talk them into May or Meyers? What about Santana? And they send some cash with Tulo to help offset his massive contract?   I don't know. It could work. I'm not saying ""fuck yes! Pull that trigger!"" Because the guy gets a boost from Coors and is made of glass.  But I'm also not quite so willing as the rest of you to just blow off the idea. We need a shortstop. Basically always have. Why be so dismissive?"
minnesotatwins,3e4tfx,Opie59,2,Wed Jul 22 04:31:54 2015 UTC,I really like Tulo and he's been one of my favorite players in baseball so I would love to have him but of course at the right price. If we could get him for around what you suggested I'd be ok with that so will see what happens but I'd love to have him as long as we don't have to give up any huge pieces.
minnesotatwins,3e4tfx,HakunaMatata023,6,Wed Jul 22 05:07:51 2015 UTC,"Don't want. He would be expensive and he's old enough that we would regret it in 3-4 years, and I don't think Tulo gets us to the playoffs this year, especially if it means giving up Gibson to do it."
minnesotatwins,3e4tfx,agrueeatedu,2,Tue Jul 21 23:51:19 2015 UTC,"No. The Rockies will want too much of our young talent, and I don't think a veteran shortstop gets us into October."

minnesotatwins,3e560n,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed Jul 22 04:35:40 2015 UTC,"I suggest that the worst of all of those games was July 20, 2009, 6 years ago yesterday, in Oakland, when they blew a 10 run lead and lost 14-13. Game ended on a disputed call when Cuddyer was called out at the plate.  I used to work at a radio station in my hometown and would be in charge of playing ads and whatnot during Twins games, controlling the sound board, etc. I only worked evenings there, because I had an 8-5 job over the summer as well. Well usually the games were over by 10ish, so that wasn't a problem. Not the west coast games. Because of all the hits (39) and runs (27), I don't think the game got done until at least 12:30 or so. Add the 30 minute postgame and another half hour or so to close up the station, and that was way too long of a night. The fact that the game ended on such a depressing play made it even worse. Don't think I will ever forget that game."

minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,Katbot22,3,Tue Jul 21 16:46:52 2015 UTC,Agreed... I really don't trust them doing anything. This year is a bit of a fluke. We're not there yet. Let's take our nice improvement and promising young performances and build on it for years to come rather than trade away prospects.
minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,obsidianop,0,Tue Jul 21 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"We would have to to get Lucroy. Berrios would probably be gone, as would one of either Gordon or Polanco and some other smaller names. Personally I think that would be a great trade for us if it weren't for the fact that Berrios is likely our last hope of good pitching in the next couple years, and I think that would be selling low on Lucroy for the Brewers."

minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,agrueeatedu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"Still not worth Berrios. Pitching is more important than having a catcher right this moment, especially with some of the things Berrios has shown thus far."

If we could get him without giving up Berrios, then sure, why not. But I doubt that happens. I just don't want the Twins to mess up what is finally looking like a promising group. :P"
minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,Katbot22,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"Pitchers bust far more often than position players, and Berrios is likely more of a #2 starter at his peak. I would gladly give up a pitching prospect of almost any caliber for a proven catcher as good as Lucroy, especially with his contract."
minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,agrueeatedu,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:02:24 2015 UTC,Berrios will not be on the table.  Alex Meyer for Lucroy would be a great deal.
minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,varjar,3,Tue Jul 21 18:58:56 2015 UTC,and one that would never happen. The Brewers aren't stupid.
minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,agrueeatedu,3,Tue Jul 21 19:02:53 2015 UTC,The Brewers would laugh you right out of the room.

I guess they could just be going for the drama to create buzz, but still seems like a recipe for disaster."
minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,giantgnat,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"Half the fans (namely the younger ones...) probably don't even know why they are booing AJ, and if they think they do, they probably have heard some half-cooked story about why they should hate him.   He did an interview on ""Garbage Time with Katie Nolan"" on FOX Sports 1 where he said his two favorite teams to play for were the White Sox and the Twins...so there's that..."
minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,ddn4t,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"Pardon my ignorance but... why the hate for AJ, exactly? Aside from the fact that he's a renowned troll and used to play for the Twins before being traded."
minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,Katbot22,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:31 2015 UTC,That's pretty much the extent of it. He's just one of those fun-to-hate guys. Though there was the time he spiked Morneau.

minnesotatwins,3e2yv2,mostdope92,2,Wed Jul 22 02:22:22 2015 UTC,Lucroy is going to be too rich for us. I doubt the Tigers deal Avila. Im hoping for Derek Norris. We could maybe get him for some of the less touted prospects

minnesotatwins,3e2f7a,Zeeker12,6,Tue Jul 21 14:47:24 2015 UTC,I think just being in the hunt for the wild card as the season draws near would be great. It would wildly exceed my preseason expectations and would serve to give some pressure game experience to the young team.   Either that or sweeping the play offs to win the World Series in straight sets.
minnesotatwins,3e2f7a,starlitmint,5,Tue Jul 21 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"85 wins, maybe the 2nd wild card if we're lucky. Our pitching is still pretty horrible, and we still have a massive hole at C, as well as an outfield that has yet to develop."

I doubt the Twins would want to trade him right now. Berrios would probably be their second choice. I think the package would need to be centered around one of those two for the Rockies to bite.  Sadly, Meyer's value is well below Berrios' now and Polanco isn't a good enough prospect to center the trade around either.   In general, I'd be a bit hesitant to trade for Tulo based on the money, injury history, and Coors effect, but if the Twins could possibly get him for your offer, I'd say take it and don't look back. My hesitancy is based on the Rockies probably wanting Berrios or Gibson."

I suppose Wiggins has the highest likelihood of being the ""biggest star"" of the four, but that's only because basketball is such a star-driven sport. The only single position that could even compete in terms of popularity with a NBA star in all of major sports is Quarterback in the NFL."

Update on whether this will require a DL stint coming half hour prior to start of today's game.  Edit: Said to be a ""rolled"" ankle and not a sprain. Plan is to let him rest for 3-5 days and then reevaluate. Sounds like he may avoid the DL."

minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 19 21:53:43 2015 UTC,Arcia will be up if Sano's ankle needs time.  Otherwise he'll stay where he's at.  Can't see them bringing him up to be on the bench.

minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,0,Sun Jul 19 22:01:09 2015 UTC,Danny is better than Escobar defensively. And our coaches know that.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,FlannelBeard,5,Sun Jul 19 21:54:43 2015 UTC,What?
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,3,Sun Jul 19 21:55:04 2015 UTC,"That wasn't even a bad pitch. Slider at the bottom of the zone, maybe even below it."

minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"KC just won. Twins are going to lose, so that'll drop us to 6 back. At this rate that's the closest we'll be for the rest of the year."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,pman5595,3,Sun Jul 19 20:56:03 2015 UTC,At this rate that's the closest we'll be for the rest of the year.   Them two game rates are tough to overcome.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:58:59 2015 UTC,"Post-all-star break, both the Twins and Royals are playing more like the teams we are. I expect that'll continue."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,pman5595,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:00:13 2015 UTC,Post-all-star break   So three games instead of the two he said?
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:04 2015 UTC,Obviously not just these last three games. I'm saying we'll continue to play the way we have all year—mediocrely—and we're going to get the results we should have been getting all year. I predict we'll finish something like 82-80.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,pman5595,4,Sun Jul 19 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"Watch out, MLB. Here comes Oakland. Gonna finish 111-51 at this rate."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,0,Sun Jul 19 21:00:01 2015 UTC,Good game.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,innesota2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:56:01 2015 UTC,Remember that time a while back when the Twins scored 7 runs in the 9th inning?
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:56:34 2015 UTC,Yeah that happens one game out of every couple thousand opportunities for a reason.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,pman5595,2,Sun Jul 19 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"Sure that does, but the Twins have 6 times that many innings left in this game... I'm guessing coming back from a 7 run deficit over 6 innings happens a lot more often it does over 1."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:10:56 2015 UTC,I bet Santana gets sent down. He's just not playing well.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,SexualLucas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:29 2015 UTC,What the fuck are our batters swinging at?

minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,JiuJitsuJustin,3,Sun Jul 19 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"Danny Santana is a young player with a lot of potential, and could turn into a very good shortstop. I'm all for him playing everyday.  But it should be in Rochester for fucks sake."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,pman5595,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:48 2015 UTC,Yes. He just looks lackadaisical right now.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"Nunez or escobar can play a good defense, and bat much better than him, I don't know why they don't send him down, get his game back"
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,JiuJitsuJustin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:50:05 2015 UTC,I don't disagree. Escobar seems like the best bet for everyday ss.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,imissedthetoilet,2,Sun Jul 19 20:51:21 2015 UTC,We should charge those runs to Santana.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,Tannekr,2,Sun Jul 19 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"Well they are unearned, so they don't get charged to Milone."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:19 2015 UTC,"Still, can we charge them to santana"

minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,y2jayjk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"Santana had made the most errors for the team right? I think start of the year he made up more than 1 / 3 of the teams errors, I don't like his defense, and his batting has been so bad from last year, wish we had hardy"
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,JiuJitsuJustin,2,Sun Jul 19 20:40:55 2015 UTC,I guess it's gonna be one those kinds of days today....
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:40:09 2015 UTC,A day when you give up runs?
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 19 20:41:28 2015 UTC,Imagine how many more games you'd win if you didn't give up anything.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:43:46 2015 UTC,You might never lose.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,RobertService,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:04 2015 UTC,"I hate errors and home runs as much as anyone else does, but if we say ""one of those days"" every time there's an unearned run... well there would be a lot of those days across the MLB."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:46:50 2015 UTC,A homerun immediately preceded by an error doesn't happen that often.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,SplurgingSpurgeon,2,Sun Jul 19 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"Why don't we just do that all the time?   I mean, we would win every game then.  Man, we would be great coaches if we just told our team to not let the other team score.  Legends."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:42 2015 UTC,A day when you fuck up a routine grounder to end the inning and then give up a HR to the next batter.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:41 2015 UTC,Fuck.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:26 2015 UTC,Oh poop
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,bobbywellington,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"God damnit Santana.  I'm probably one of your last defenders in this sub, but you are not making it easy.  Figure your shit out soon."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:38:27 2015 UTC,"Idk how he has anyone backing him anymore, I had high expectations, considering he had a great year lady year, buy failed to do literally anything g this year but to make errors"
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,JiuJitsuJustin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:05 2015 UTC,Because I remember last year and spring training that he was very productive both offensively and defensively.  He could easily be that guy that turns it around and shows the brilliance he had last year.  I was really hoping for him to be our lead off hitter this year.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"I was hoping buxton, but I don't mind dozier hitting lead off homers. Santana has just been the biggest dissapointment this year imo"
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,JiuJitsuJustin,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"Damn it, Danny."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,3,Sun Jul 19 20:38:23 2015 UTC,I'm getting real fuckin tired of Danny Santana.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:54 2015 UTC,"Milone to the A's:  ""I must break you."""
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jul 19 20:33:03 2015 UTC,"Man, night and day difference from Hicks this year. I'm pretty excited about it."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,imissedthetoilet,4,Sun Jul 19 20:28:23 2015 UTC,Another nice AB as a lefty for Hicks.

minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,pman5595,0,Sun Jul 19 20:23:56 2015 UTC,"lol, give him a break. He didn't see the ball"
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,Scrubsam,0,Sun Jul 19 20:28:42 2015 UTC,That's good. You hit the ball like that you don't look for it. You start sprinting.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,pman5595,2,Sun Jul 19 20:29:58 2015 UTC,Last night was so fun when we came back and then stabbed in the heart with the loss.   Win the series pls
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,y2jayjk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:11:42 2015 UTC,"No kidding.  I got home, turned on the game, and just saw us take the lead......only to have that crush my spirits shortly later.   At least we didn't get shutout and prevented him from pitching to us the entire game."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:15:08 2015 UTC,Mauer's AB was absolute fantastic. He was taking tough pitches and fouling off tough pitches. He seemed really locked on and then just narrowly missed a HR.  Absolutely broke my heart that Perkins couldn't nail it down.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,imissedthetoilet,3,Sun Jul 19 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"The Tigers are about to fall under .500, yesssssssssss"
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,ewok_bukkake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:05:29 2015 UTC,Soooo we can trade for Price?
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,kaiserj1982,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"If you want to give up Buxton or Sano, sure."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"glares  Don't you put those decisions on us this early when we just start to see their talent in the majors.  I'm sure we will have to make a hard choice in a few years, but until then......let the good times roll with both of them!"
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jul 19 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wouldn't trade them either. But that's what it would take. At the very least, Detroit would want probably Berrios + Kepler or something. For 2-3 months of Price, not worth it."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"Well, and starting pitching hasn't been the issue. We need relievers and a catcher if we can find one."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,Gallade3,3,Sun Jul 19 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't even been paying attention to KC or Detroit. Too early. Just worried about the Twins. As long as they take care of their shit, all I care about."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  And truth be told, unless the Royals run into injuries are an unusual string of luck, I don't think we will catch them.  Tigers are who we need to make sure we stay ahead of in hopes of getting the WC spot."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:34 2015 UTC,Houston/LAA loser as well as Toronto and Baltimore are much more important than the Tigers as far as WC goes.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,ChiefakaJames,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, but if we can't stay ahead of the Tigers, there is no point in worrying about those teams."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:24:03 2015 UTC,Too early   2008 and 2009 taught me that it's never too early to root against the other guys.
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,FrankReynolds,2,Sun Jul 19 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"Ya, every game counts. Just can't control what the other teams do. I mean, KC is a better team than Minnesota, no doubt."

minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,Kripzo,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, Fryer is hardly a downgrade from Suzuki."
minnesotatwins,3dv0mk,tennisspears,4,Sun Jul 19 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"Jesse Chavez on the mound today for Oakland. A six-pitch RHP. His hard stuff are a cutter, four-seamer, and a two-seam sinker, all around 91-95 mph and combined used for 71% of his repertoire. He also has a change-up at 83-87 mph used 18%, a slider 82-86 mph used 8%, and then a rare curveball 75-79 mph used 2.5%.  Chavez has similar approaches to both LHH and RHH, the key differences being he throws the change-up more to LHH (24% as opposed to 11%), and the cutter more to RHH (38% as opposed to 30%). Sinker and cutter are most used early in the counts, and continues with the cutter over 30% of the time ahead in counts and with two strikes to both LHH and RHH. He keeps his splits consistent, except he does throw his sinker a lot less later in counts and with two strikes.  The change-up is the key pitch to lefties. It has the highest swing and miss rate (15.31%), gets the highest amount of ground balls (14.29%), but also the highest amount of line-drives (10.20%). Change-up is getting hit for .350 this season, slugged .567 with 7 doubles and 2 HRs in 60 ABs. The sinker and cutter also get hit pretty well (.310/.524 and .254/.380 respectively).  Righties have a little more trouble, as the change, slider, curve, and cutter all have whiff rates over 10%, slider the highest at 19.74%. Sinker and change get good ground ball percentages at 14.29% and 10.71%, and the highest line-drive percentage is the four-seamer at only 5.56%. The sinker and change-up are still getting hit well - .378/.460 and .353/.412 respectively, but the cutter and four-seamer at .136/.203 and .114/.114 (56% of his usage to RHH) make up for that a bit.  On the season, Chavez is 4-9 with a 3.40 ERA (3.23 FIP), 26 BB to 84 K in 100.2 IP. Compared to his career numbers, his ERA, FIP, WHIP, H/9, HR/9, and BB/9 are all lower (some substantially) this year in his 8th season.  Dozier: 1 for 7, 1 BB, 1 K  Rosario: Never faced  Mauer: 2 for 6, 4 K  Hunter: 5 for 7  Plouffe: 2 for 7, 1 BB, 3 K  Hicks: 1 for 3, 1 K  Robinson: 1 for 1  Fryer: Never faced  Santana: 1 for 4, 1 K"

Bullpen ERA with Perkins is 11th highest in the majors at 3.69.   Without Perkins, it goes up to 4.09, which is still lower than the Reds, A's, Braves, Rangers, and Rockies bullpens.  Bullpen WHIP with Perkins is 14th in the Majors at 1.27. Without him, it goes up to 1.34, which would be a tie for 7th with the Reds and Mariners.  BB% is 2nd lowest in the Majors at 7.2%, without Perkins, it would go up to 7.7%, still 7th lowest.  K% is already the lowest in the Majors at 16.2%, without Perkins, it would drop to 14.9%.  K-BB% would stay the worst with or without Perkins.  Bullpen WAR of 0.6 (22nd in league) would go down to -0.6, which would tie them with the Tigers for worst."

minnesotatwins,3dt05n,ChiefakaJames,4,Sun Jul 19 04:42:24 2015 UTC,Was at the game. Had a good enough time drinking and screwing around with my friends that the shitball ending was not super painful. Knowing Fien was going to blow it made it easier to accept our fate.  Also - o.co / oracle arena remind me of how comparatively smooth it is getting out of Target field / Target center / the old dome. Just a total mess getting out of there tonight.
minnesotatwins,3dt05n,casual_sociopathy,2,Sun Jul 19 07:09:35 2015 UTC,Probably didn't help that Kevin Hart had a show right next door at Oracle Arena (where the Warriors play) and both facilities share the same parking lot. I usually take BART to A's games - makes it real easy.
minnesotatwins,3dt05n,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:46 2015 UTC,Yeah that was a lot of it. It has been messy every time I have been there though. BART from Fremont is a good idea.
minnesotatwins,3dt05n,casual_sociopathy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:51:09 2015 UTC,It's (kind of) tough to blame Perkins. A bang-bang play at 1st base on a fairly routine grounder and then a dying quail jam shot. Maybe Perkins' biggest fault was the wild pitch.  I just have no confidence in the bullpen when we go extra innings. Casey Fien seems to be falling apart at the seams.   That loss hurt a lot. I guess it wouldn't be an Oakland series without a heartbreaker. We need a win today and put this one behind us.
minnesotatwins,3dt05n,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:25 2015 UTC,Mauer's double was pretty close to a HR too which would have been an extra run.

minnesotatwins,3dp53l,InfiniteDeWitt,5,Sun Jul 19 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"Cain went 2/3 with an RBI, Escobar went 1/2, and Davis pitched a scoreless inning with 2 Ks. They weren't all crap. Perez was 0/2 and Moustakas was 0/1. Obviously Dozier's one at-bat was about as good as it gets, but let's not act like the Royals players did nothing."
minnesotatwins,3dp53l,tennisspears,0,Sun Jul 19 00:32:38 2015 UTC,"I said almost all. Davis is the most outstanding relief pitcher of the year if you ask me, he's been amazing since he was turned into a reliever."

It was amazing how many hard hit balls were hit directly at fielders tonight.  Don't get me wrong, still a great outing. He had good movement, good location and good off-speed - but he's not going to throw it by anyone. Only 1 strikeout tonight."

minnesotatwins,3dphwf,ac3UVspad3s,13,Sat Jul 18 05:24:32 2015 UTC,That's how you start off the 2nd half of the season!  Playoff Push Information:  Wins Goal: 33/75  Wins Needed: 42  Games Remaining: 72  Tracked since 5/9/15 vs. CLE  Record since 5/9/15: 33-25-2
minnesotatwins,3dphwf,SplurgingSpurgeon,9,Sat Jul 18 05:05:43 2015 UTC,"What is this using as a wins goal again? It has always been confusing to me that it says 75 and only has their record since May 9th. Any way you could add what their record was on 5/9, maybe at the end of the ""Tracked since"" line?   Edit: Yes, it is extremely easy to calculate if you know the current record (but I'm lazy and want to be able to see it right away without having to think, damn it!)   50-40 now and 33-27 since 5/9 tells me their record was 17-13 at that point, so the wins goal must be 92?"
minnesotatwins,3dphwf,tennisspears,11,Sat Jul 18 05:10:50 2015 UTC,"Correct. I don't want to change it though because I tried that and we started to struggle. When I went back to the original format we took off again.   Superstitions.  If we start to cool down again, you got it."
minnesotatwins,3dphwf,SplurgingSpurgeon,5,Sat Jul 18 05:34:47 2015 UTC,"It means 92. ""Wins Needed: 42"" plus 50 is 92.   So yea, 75 added to that date is 92.... The math checks out."
minnesotatwins,3dphwf,ac3UVspad3s,10,Sat Jul 18 05:28:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I realized it was easy to figure out from the Wins Needed part, as long as you know their current record. Just still seems weird to me to have a ""Wins Goal"" of 75."

minnesotatwins,3dphwf,BrianDoziersHair,10,Sat Jul 18 05:23:53 2015 UTC,Twins are still hot after the break!
minnesotatwins,3dphwf,novafire08,11,Sat Jul 18 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest change offensively in this season was on display several times tonight: hitters battling on 0-2 counts.  There have been several times where Dozier and Plouffe will foul off tough pitches or take a couple balls 0-2 and then a hanging breaking ball comes and gets clobbered over the wall.  Or other times where someone works out a walk on 0-2.  Sano and Hicks have done it a few times this month.  In years past you'd almost always see those situations become strikeouts.  Not only does it boost the moral of the hitter but it also has to be very deflating for the pitcher.  ""I had him and he just hit a 2 run HR.""  Very impressed."

minnesotatwins,3dphwf,ac3UVspad3s,6,Sat Jul 18 05:01:24 2015 UTC,My favorite Twins commercial ever.
minnesotatwins,3dphwf,Derk-Derks,9,Sat Jul 18 05:12:54 2015 UTC,"Barely related but I wanted to share this:  I had this idea for a Twins Territory commercial one day back when Ben Revere was on the team.  He and Span would be in the outfield playing catch at night in an empty Target Field when Span says ""What's that?"" Revere looks into the stands in RF and sees TC like 20 rows up holding two lanterns like this.  Revere immediately sprints towards the dugout yelling ""The season is coming! The season is coming!"" He runs into the dugout and yells it to a couple of guys there.  He runs into the clubhouse and yells it to a few.  He bursts into a room where Perkins and Diamond are watching game tape and tells them.  Finally he barges into Gardy's office and tells him and Gardy starts sending a morse code message.  Then they had to go and fucking trade both of em that offseason.  I think that would have been a cool commercial."
minnesotatwins,3dphwf,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,6,Sat Jul 18 05:55:52 2015 UTC,That gif is by far the most viral famous thing to come from the MLB.  Twins marketing is always the best. I love how they let some of the players control their own marketing. Like May's campaign for Dozier.

They're four houses down and lots of shouting. I have no idea what's happening.   Edit: Cop helped them change a headlight. Cop turns to me after it's working and gives me a nod.

minnesotatwins,3douzq,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat Jul 18 04:28:44 2015 UTC,When did he make that bet?
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,2,Sat Jul 18 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"Just a week into May, so it was a while ago. I don't think he expected Dozier to do so well, hahaha."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat Jul 18 04:26:37 2015 UTC,"Alright, thought this was recently or something, and I was going to tell you that you shouldn't take advantage of mentally challenged friends like that."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:30 2015 UTC,"I'd still do it even if the bet was recent; he's so sour on the Twins after 4 crappy seasons that until the All-Star Break, he'd go ""The Twins suck, man"" in passing whenever I would talk baseball with my manager.   He's slowly coming around though."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat Jul 18 04:32:41 2015 UTC,Yeah you should ask him if he wants to bet more on that
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Thisguyyork,2,Sat Jul 18 04:24:34 2015 UTC,"Nah, he's already salty enough that he jokingly said he'd go to a game and break Dozier's kneecaps so he doesn't lose the bet. :P"
minnesotatwins,3douzq,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat Jul 18 04:27:20 2015 UTC,This ump is blowing the A's hitters hard.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,vagrantwade,6,Sat Jul 18 04:22:17 2015 UTC,That was a BS time call.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,3,Sat Jul 18 04:21:22 2015 UTC,FIRST STRIKEOUT!!
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Derk-Derks,5,Sat Jul 18 04:16:02 2015 UTC,"I kind of want to see Santana pitch a complete game, depending on how this 8th inning goes. If he's around 100 I think it'd be reasonable/cool to see  edit: the dream, my dream, our dream..."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Scrubsam,2,Sat Jul 18 04:15:20 2015 UTC,So much for that.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,ChiefakaJames,4,Sat Jul 18 04:25:05 2015 UTC,GOD DAMN I HAD TO DO AN UBER. I am glad we hit a grand slam.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jul 18 04:11:29 2015 UTC,What does that mean? You drove someone or got a ride?
minnesotatwins,3douzq,doubleflusher,3,Sat Jul 18 04:14:23 2015 UTC,"I drove someone. I am just kinda sitting in my house watching but if I get an alert I'll go get it, I don't like letting folks down!"
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Derk-Derks,8,Sat Jul 18 04:17:59 2015 UTC,He gave some guy a blow job.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,AdaAstra,10,Sat Jul 18 04:17:32 2015 UTC,Eddie Rosario IRL

minnesotatwins,3douzq,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,5,Sat Jul 18 04:06:19 2015 UTC,Ervin CYtana
minnesotatwins,3douzq,vagrantwade,5,Sat Jul 18 04:01:55 2015 UTC,Otero and Gray did a body swap in the 6th inning.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,vagrantwade,4,Sat Jul 18 03:57:47 2015 UTC,Giving that reliever some help on those low-and-outside pitches. No replay for Sano's check swing either - annoying.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,50in15,4,Sat Jul 18 03:57:27 2015 UTC,Sooooo... Danny heading back to AAA soon?
minnesotatwins,3douzq,NorseWolves,6,Sat Jul 18 03:53:45 2015 UTC,"No, he's been on a tear..."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,ac3UVspad3s,4,Sat Jul 18 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"Oh Torii, enjoying his last day in his 30's."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,8,Sat Jul 18 03:53:35 2015 UTC,"Danny Santana with the ""I kind of like Rochester"" swing."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,vagrantwade,9,Sat Jul 18 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, Arcia is down in AAA showing off his ""Get me out of Rochester now"" swing."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,6,Sat Jul 18 03:53:10 2015 UTC,With Buxton coming back I just don't know of a scenario where he gets called up. Unless he can also play SS I guess.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,vagrantwade,6,Sat Jul 18 03:55:06 2015 UTC,Still sticking to the thought of Buxton not coming back to ML roster until September. Let him have some success at AAA with Rosario/Hicks/Hunter and Arcia as 4th OF in Minnesota.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat Jul 18 03:58:12 2015 UTC,If he gets shifted there in Rochester we'll see what the rumblings are.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,DayToDayInFlipFlops,5,Sat Jul 18 04:05:44 2015 UTC,I would keep Buxton in the minors until the September call ups.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,doubleflusher,5,Sat Jul 18 03:57:55 2015 UTC,"Buxton will need a rehab assignment for sure, and then may just be optioned to AAA depending on how he does and how Hicks is doing at that time. Rosario could also possibly use some time in AAA. He has done fine, but could still use a little work on his plate discipline."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,4,Sat Jul 18 03:57:14 2015 UTC,I still don't see Arcia getting called up. At all.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,vagrantwade,3,Sat Jul 18 03:58:34 2015 UTC,"Well at some point, they are going to have to see what he can do again. He is out of options after this year, so they can't send him down to AAA again next year without exposing him to waivers (and he WILL get claimed).  I would really rather not trade him, especially if it is just for a relief pitcher. Seems to me like a cross between the David Ortiz (young power hitter with some flaws) and Wilson Ramos (prospect for RP) situations."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,2,Sat Jul 18 04:01:07 2015 UTC,"but Ortiz always could take a walk to some degree, Arcia has shown me shit plate discipline and I dont like that in hitters"
minnesotatwins,3douzq,taffyowner,3,Sat Jul 18 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"It's not an identical comparison. Arcia isn't as good as Ortiz was, but I still don't want to give away 30 home run potential for a relief pitcher. Might as well keep him around as a bench bat for a while if you don't trust him to play every day. They could use a lefty with some power to pinch hit for a guy like Suzuki late in some games."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,5,Sat Jul 18 04:17:35 2015 UTC,Arcia has struck out in 6 straight at bats now....
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Bickle19,3,Sat Jul 18 03:56:49 2015 UTC,"Yup, 25-31 K% sucks, but if the power comes with it, I'll take the tradeoff easily. Can see why others wouldn't."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jul 18 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"personally I'm not a fan of all or nothing hitters, I know in this day and age the mantra is all outs are created equal but thats not true, a strikeout accomplishes nothing"
minnesotatwins,3douzq,taffyowner,3,Sat Jul 18 04:12:22 2015 UTC,I would too. Just was disappointing to see after he had been mashing so well. He's so streaky it's hard to figure him out.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Bickle19,4,Sat Jul 18 04:08:14 2015 UTC,Here comes a call/jinx!  Danny Double.   Edit: God I suck
minnesotatwins,3douzq,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Sat Jul 18 03:50:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, two hits this series is still really doable."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,ChiefakaJames,5,Sat Jul 18 03:52:20 2015 UTC,Wow just got outta ant man and man we've put up 5 on Gray?
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Phillyboy101,4,Sat Jul 18 03:48:32 2015 UTC,How was the movie? My wife dragged me to Trainwreck earlier...meh.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,doubleflusher,3,Sat Jul 18 03:51:01 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it quite a bit. I'd rate it on par with GOTG. I want to see train wreck. Funny or no?
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Phillyboy101,3,Sat Jul 18 03:58:58 2015 UTC,"Not as many laughs as I thought there would be. Decent, but predictable. Good date night flick."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,doubleflusher,7,Sat Jul 18 04:03:00 2015 UTC,Plouffe is our savior.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Gallade3,6,Sat Jul 18 03:50:02 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we got those runs. Not that I don't have faith in Ervin, because he's dealing right now, but 1-0 games scare me."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Bickle19,5,Sat Jul 18 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"that and I want to go to freaking bed, silly west coast timing"
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Scrubsam,5,Sat Jul 18 03:52:27 2015 UTC,That dude was legitimately happy about nabbing that foul ball.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,treeharp2,5,Sat Jul 18 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"Nick Punto, is that you?"
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,5,Sat Jul 18 03:44:21 2015 UTC,Fork ball
minnesotatwins,3douzq,doubleflusher,10,Sat Jul 18 03:43:36 2015 UTC,That was Sonny Gray's first grand slam allowed in his career.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,5,Sat Jul 18 03:43:05 2015 UTC,"I want to get drunk at an A's game, they're having fun over there"

minnesotatwins,3douzq,doubleflusher,7,Sat Jul 18 03:41:09 2015 UTC,Some say thanks to that fucking vuvuzela that ball is still traveling.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,cadderly09,8,Sat Jul 18 03:39:39 2015 UTC,Every time someone uses a vuvuzela a dead brazilian gets their wings.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,vagrantwade,13,Sat Jul 18 03:41:26 2015 UTC,"My sister is at the game. She texted me ""WOOOHOOO!"" one pitch into the at bat. My family got really excited and then I realized it was in response to something totally unrelated to baseball. Plouffe still mashed it."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Bickle19,5,Sat Jul 18 03:38:36 2015 UTC,"Can anyone make out what the fans are chanting? Sounds like ""We Are The World"""

minnesotatwins,3douzq,SinisterPaige,6,Sat Jul 18 03:41:15 2015 UTC,"God damn, I can't believe he got that.  We really suck at stealing these days."
minnesotatwins,3douzq,AdaAstra,5,Sat Jul 18 03:38:12 2015 UTC,It was the drum and vuvuzela. It was fate guiding that ball.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,NorseWolves,11,Sat Jul 18 03:37:50 2015 UTC,Fuckin wow. Plouffe grand dong.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Fortehlulz33,3,Sat Jul 18 03:37:16 2015 UTC,I bet it is.  I bet it is...

minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,4,Sat Jul 18 03:37:11 2015 UTC,Did he delete his account? Was an interesting kind of fan.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,NorseWolves,6,Sat Jul 18 03:39:02 2015 UTC,Yeah he did. IIRC he made some sort of weird bet about it.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,Bickle19,5,Sat Jul 18 03:41:28 2015 UTC,"He was confident the Twins wouldn't win a single game in a 3-game series with the Tigers, and he said that if they won one, he would leave the sub. But then he deleted his account before that series even started."

minnesotatwins,3douzq,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat Jul 18 03:34:07 2015 UTC,Even announcers normally call it an at-bat.
minnesotatwins,3douzq,SplurgingSpurgeon,5,Sat Jul 18 03:37:10 2015 UTC,"And if the result was a walk, HBP, sac fly, etc., they'd be wrong."

minnesotatwins,3douzq,tennisspears,3,Sat Jul 18 02:47:21 2015 UTC,Middle of the 2006 season when Liriano moved into a starting role and Johan was being dominant was some of the most fun I had as a fan.

minnesotatwins,3douzq,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,6,Sat Jul 18 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"That 2004 second half was absolutely ridiculous. He made 15 starts, pitched 104.1 innings, and allowed only 14 earned runs. Had a 1.21 ERA, 11.1 K/9. Hitters slashed .154/.216/.228 against him. Unreal."

minnesotatwins,3dp1k7,PresidentPlate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:58:20 2015 UTC,Indeed. I took that pic seconds before Dozier's solo homer to open the game.
minnesotatwins,3dolqi,hoax09,7,Fri Jul 17 23:47:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It's hard to say what his future holds as this is the first year he has been above average as a player. The past few years he was on and off the field with injury without showing anything elite. This year his average has seen a dramatic spike (.278 career to .335 right now). He is stealing a decent amount of bases which makes up for the lack of power, something that will hopefully continue to develop as he gets older.   Where he plays long term remains to be seen as he is capable of playing all three outfield positions and first base if need be. The rest of 2015 and the first part of 2016 will go a long way to showing what kind of player he will be."
minnesotatwins,3dolqi,Cornholio4,2,Sat Jul 18 00:59:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. I'm going to be keeping a close eye on him for sure!

minnesotatwins,3dolqi,spin8x,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he is top 10 in ISO in AA.  Definitely impressive."
minnesotatwins,3dolqi,AmbivalentMax,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"Something of note that you'll occasionally hear from scouts: Kepler's developmental cycle compared to other international players (age, level of competition, etc) is actually further behind, because he came from Germany and was signed when he was 16. He's always been an elite 5-tool player, we've just been waiting for his baseball skills to develop. I'm personally very high on him, but we'll see if he sticks at 1B or if he players a corner OF (as a natural great CF). I believe there was a Fangraphs article on him a month or two ago, but I'm on mobile so I can't link it. Hope that helps."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,7Finger,7,Fri Jul 17 15:44:17 2015 UTC,"He never seemed to like being a part of this team.  He seemed disinterested. His interviews were hilarious, he showed absolutely nothing but disdain and annoyance to any question that was asked.  I can't recall ever seeing him smile once since he's been on this team.  That speaks volumes and doesn't fit with this team's attitude.  Bringing him back now would be a huge karma downgrade, glad he's out for the year despite the wasted $$$."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,CentralAmerican,6,Fri Jul 17 19:27:24 2015 UTC,What a waste of money.
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,Kruse,4,Fri Jul 17 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I think this makes the Twins a better team and clears up one of their rotation questions. If Nolasco had come back he would have bumped a better pitcher out of the rotation. It sucks for him, but it would be best for the Twins if he just announced his retirement."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,Cornholio4,3,Fri Jul 17 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"I doubt he will retire, but his contract is definitely one of the biggest issues the Twins will have the next couple of years. Below average pitcher with a hefty contract ($12 million/year)."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,NuancedThinker,2,Fri Jul 17 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, at this point insurance is probably paying his contract, so he's not hurting the team on the field or financially."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:17 2015 UTC,"Didn't the Twins stop buying insurance, after it became too expensive a few years back?"
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,ac3UVspad3s,3,Fri Jul 17 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I just assumed all MLB team had it for just this situation. That's a lot of money to pay Nolasco to NOT play. I would love to google this, but if you look for ""minnesota twins insurance"" you get a lot of articles about scoring insurance runs and have extra players as insurance against injuries. Nothing about insurance paying salaries during injuries. This article I posted says something about contract insurance kicking in since he is out for the season, but I don't have anything to verify that."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,CentralAmerican,2,Fri Jul 17 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"I used to pile on Nolasco any chance I could get (the nature of being a high paid player) but seeing his body language in the start where he got hurt was tough to watch.  When Suzuki came out to ask if he was good to go he just stared into the outfield with a look on his face like someone had died. He couldn't even look at Kurt. I felt so bad for him, still do.  Like the article says, no athlete wants to not be able to play.  And he knew this was yet another setback.  Really hoping for the best for him."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,ac3UVspad3s,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:31:50 2015 UTC,"Even if he comes back he's not bumping any pitchers out of the rotation. Minnesota would be dumb to remove Milone from the lineup. Pelfrey is having command/control issues again, but we know he can pitch lights out. However, if Nolasco remains a starter, Pelfrey will be traded/released or forcefully put into the pen."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,tennisspears,3,Fri Jul 17 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"Pelfrey will be out of team control after this season, so I'm pretty sure he'll be gone unless he returns to form. With so many young arms in the system they aren't going to offer him a huge amount to stay, so he'll probably be a free agent if we don't trade him before then. If Nolasco ever returns he will be in the starting rotation, so somebody will have to be bumped. They aren't going to pay him that much money to sit in the bullpen. It appears that they won't have to think about this until next year, but it will become an issue then."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,tennisspears,3,Fri Jul 17 18:24:18 2015 UTC,I am waiting for the other shoe to drop with Pelfrey.  I can't help thinking he's pitching on borrowed time and it's not long before he turns back into the Pelf we've loathed for 2 years.  Luckily we have May waiting in the wings and staying loose to keep us in contention if Pelf blows up again.
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,ac3UVspad3s,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:29:40 2015 UTC,He has injury issues and if he's given another chance at the rotation but plays like he has (Needing to be pulled after 5 innings) he should be put in the bullpen.
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,ac3UVspad3s,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:48 2015 UTC,At that point they would probably just cut him from the roster rather than have him take up space in the bullpen. I think they would rather pay him to sit at home and watch rather than bring the team down when they have so many better options.
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,audiocranium,2,Fri Jul 17 19:30:16 2015 UTC,rather than have him take up space in the bullpen... when they have so many better options.   Have you seen what is in the bullpen? Pelfrey as a 1 inning option would be much better than most of those guys.
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,ac3UVspad3s,3,Fri Jul 17 21:17:37 2015 UTC,"I was referring to Nolasco in the bullpen. They might consider putting Pelfrey there - in fact he might excel there given his recent history. Going through an inning or two might be better for him than trying to get through the whole lineup two or three times. Nolasco, on the other hand, would be wasted in the bullpen, but might also be a waste in the starting rotation. That's my point.  I'm pretty sure Pelfrey will be done with the Twins at the end of this season regardless, so it doesn't really matter."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,audiocranium,3,Fri Jul 17 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"Oh crap, my bad. Sorry about that."

minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:34:38 2015 UTC,Also Meyer is a season/season and a half from getting a chance at the rotation. While Berrios is on his way in 2 seasons at best.
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,southsideson,3,Fri Jul 17 18:14:56 2015 UTC,Where are you getting these timelines? Berrios and Meyer could easily make this rotation out of spring training next year.
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,Cornholio4,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"Minnesota has enough invested in May, Gibson, Santana, and Hughes. Along with the resurgence of Milone."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,ac3UVspad3s,2,Fri Jul 17 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"No matter how well Milone does, it's hard to see him in this long-term. I wouldn't bet against a trade of Milone and/or Pelfrey in the next 2 weeks to bring back bullpen or catching depth."
minnesotatwins,3dmvi3,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:47:37 2015 UTC,I can't see that. Milone and Pelfrey wouldn't bring in that much and they've pitched well for the Twins this year. You can't have enough starting pitching so why not just stick with it? I wouldn't want to mess with chemistry too much. Look what Billy Beane did to his team last year.

minnesotatwins,3dj4ly,ac3UVspad3s,11,Fri Jul 17 05:26:17 2015 UTC,Over - If the bullpen can improve.
minnesotatwins,3dj4ly,kuj4k,9,Thu Jul 16 18:38:12 2015 UTC,They'll be at 85.5 wins if they play the remainder of the year even...   89 wins is right around 55% for the second half. They can do that - hoping it's more with some trade additions and other teams bailing out on the season!
minnesotatwins,3dj4ly,Evergreen3,8,Thu Jul 16 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"The remaining schedule is as follows:  Royals (6), Tigers (6), Indians (13), White Sox (6), Angels (7), Yankees (6), Astros (6), Orioles (4), Mariners (4), Blue Jays (4), Rangers (3), Rays (3), A's (3), Pirates (2)  31 games against the division, 21 games against PIT/LAA/NYY/HOU, and 21 games against SEA/TOR/TEX/TB.  So much can change from day-to-day (injuries, call ups, etc) and the trade deadline will change what the division looks like.  How much is the question.  Without going deep into each matchup I think the Twins's small additions at the trade deadline, along with the benefit of Santana every 5th day, will be offset by moves within the division and the schedule. As such I predict they'll play a bit above .500 in the second half (38-35) for a finish of 87-75.  But who knows what ""events"" will transpire in the next 80 or so days.  One thing is certain, it's been exciting so far!  Edit: I see they've played 47 at home and 42 away in the first half. I'm amending that prediction to 86-76."

minnesotatwins,3dj4ly,Thisguyyork,2,Sat Jul 18 03:05:58 2015 UTC,"Minnesota won the month of May by scoring early with quality pitching built on run support confidence. Now they're winning with consistent starting pitching and clutch hitting. None of our statistically qualified starters have an ERA above 4.50. As long as we have Graham, May, O'Rourke (who needs more time to be judged, but looks lights out) and Perkins in the pen, then pitching should be well above expectations. Boyer and Fien have definitely lost their touch, while Duensing is fixing what he effed up early on.  Sidenote: Goodbye Aaron Thompson... please never pitch again. Also, if Dozier is within the 3 ABs of the 9th inning while losing, make sure May is on the mound... superstition.  I'm predicting 89-90 wins."

I've seen multiple people make that claim, but the fact is the Twins are in the top 10 among MLB teams in runs scored and 15th (middle of the pack) in batting average. Is there some advanced stay that shows the Twins to be below average? Because I just don't get it."
minnesotatwins,3dj4ly,GoochNibbler,2,Thu Jul 16 22:24:17 2015 UTC,"Most of it stems from the fact that the Twins are getting outhit. Opponents are hitting over 10 points higher than the Twins are. A lot just comes from people looking at numbers on a sheet as opposed to actually watching games.  I am not saying that the Twins will win the World Series, but didn't the 87 team get outhit by opponents as well?"
minnesotatwins,3dj4ly,WhiteGuyThatCantJump,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"Below average in OPS, which is a better predictor of runs than batting average. They are above average in runs largely because of a really high batting average with RISP, which is generally not sustainable.  Basically, if you take their current hitting performance, you predictor they'll score fewer runs than average going forward."
minnesotatwins,3dj4ly,obsidianop,2,Thu Jul 16 23:58:02 2015 UTC,"They're basically at league average for OPS (Twins: .707, league average:~.710). I can't easily find statistics on BA with RISP but I know it has been higher than expected.

minnesotatwins,3dj4ly,cadderly09,3,Thu Jul 16 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"It depends on how the other teams are doing really.  Last year the Royals made wild card with 89, and A's with 88.  But the year before, the Rangers didn't even make it with 91.  I think it's safe to say that since we are in a wild card spot right now, that if we keep playing the same as we have, we should be able to make it.  The problem will be maintaining that level.  And then of course, beating the playoff losing streak curse."

minnesotatwins,3dc5v2,tennisspears,2,Wed Jul 15 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"Kipnis .323/.401/.487, .383 wOBA, 151 wRC+, 10.4 BB%, 14.6 K%  Dozier .256/.328/.513, .359 wOBA, 131 wRC+, 8.7 BB%, 19.8 K%  And yes, fWAR has Kipnis at 4.8 and Dozier at 3.3, and if it makes me a nerd for throwing that out there, then so be it, I guess.

minnesotatwins,3dc5v2,tennisspears,5,Wed Jul 15 03:34:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Dozier is a little lucky that Yost let him bat in the 8th for Kipnis instead of having Moose (lefty) bat against Melancon (righty). Everyone knew Chapman (lefty) was coming in for the 9th, and it would have made a little more sense to have Dozier (righty) bat in the 9th against him. Dozier obviously didn't have a problem with the righty-righty matchup, but it would have been the smarter move to have Moose bat there and have Dozier bat against a lefty (even as tough of lefty as Chapman).  That being said, I'm glad it worked out that way. As a Twins fan, I wouldn't have wanted him to face Chapman, that's for sure."
minnesotatwins,3dc5v2,cadderly09,2,Wed Jul 15 03:37:47 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the logic of Yost technically defying standard batting procedure, he did show why he should be out there.

minnesotatwins,3dc5v2,DetectiveWoofles,5,Wed Jul 15 03:55:44 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's because there is a 2B spot in the order (8th tonight) and they wanted to play everyone so Dozier was getting that spot no matter what. Don't think luck had much to do with that decision.
minnesotatwins,3dc5v2,tennisspears,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:49:53 2015 UTC,"Both Dozier and Moose came in as defensive replacements in the next half-inning. Could have batted Moose for Kipnis and penciled Dozier in as the replacement for (I think) Machado's spot in the order. Then when they go out for defense, they just take their normal positions.  So I mean, yes, Dozier took the 2B's batting order spot, but you could easily switch that with the 3B's spot, since the position doesn't have to be tied to the spot for the entire game."

minnesotatwins,3ddhbb,twinsfan94,19,Wed Jul 15 12:24:29 2015 UTC,"Good question. It is technically in our franchise history. The issue is that the Twins rarely choose to acknowledge it. Because of this, most Twins fans know very little about the likes of Big Train, Joe Cronin, Goose Goslin, and Bucky Harris (among others).   It's a weird situation. When the Senators moved here in 1961, a new Senators team was placed in DC (they left 10 years later though to become the Rangers). And of course the Nationals have been there since 2005.   There actually is a statue of Walter Johnson at Nationals Park, which is how it ought to be. Walter never played here. Doubt he ever stepped foot in Minnesota. I'm in the camp that believes a team's history belongs to the city, not the franchise."
minnesotatwins,3ddhbb,RichardManuel,12,Wed Jul 15 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in the camp that believes a team's history belongs to the city, not the franchise.   I believe the change in team name plays a huge roll in this. The Giants, Dodgers, Braves and Athletics each celebrate their pre-move histories. The Twins, Orioles, and Nationals don't.   Of course this is probably also correlated with how good these teams were before their moves. Historically successful teams keep their old names. Unsuccessful ones change them and start their history fresh."
minnesotatwins,3ddhbb,huphelmeyer,2,Wed Jul 15 16:53:55 2015 UTC,"Well the Dodgers, Braves, Giants and A's all kept the same name when they moved cross country while the O's tried to forget playing like (and being named after the color of) shit."

But if the question is about franchise history, like the franchise four was, it's our duty to recognize the original Senators as part of our franchise. While it makes perfect sense for the Nats to have a statue of Johnson it wouldn't make any sense for him to be in their ""Franchise Four"" vote.  Franchise and Team have two quite separate meanings.   (But in both senses the current Cincinnati Reds have nothing to do with the original Red Stockings which disbanded after just several years.)"

minnesotatwins,3dbxx1,Aluminum_Love_Cradle,17,Wed Jul 15 02:03:31 2015 UTC,"This post is a blast from the past. I was the most active during my Twins fandom during the early 2000s until 2007 (my middle name is Kirby, obviously after Puckett). We'd drive from Virginia to Minnesota every summer. My grandpa would watch every game, so it was mandatory the 1-2 weeks we stayed with my grandparents.   He passed in '07 and I joined the military, went to college and have my own family now. Just getting back into the Twins this year.   I high fived David Ortiz in the rain outside the Metrodome after a game sometime in the early 2000s, never figured out why we let him go."
minnesotatwins,3dbxx1,kirbaeus,9,Wed Jul 15 02:27:40 2015 UTC,"Ortiz and Lohse are great examples of guys that were just not made to play ""Twins"" baseball and probably wouldn't have been nearly as successful if they stayed.   Ortiz was never going to be an opposite field hitter and Lohse was never going to be a get ahead of the batter, pitcher.   Ortiz was allowed to pull the ball and swing for the fences as much as he wanted in Boston. Leading to most, if not all of his success.   After Lohse left he was finally able to let those ridiculously dirty breaking balls loose without being hounded to get ahead by throwing a few pitches over the plate to start the ab."
minnesotatwins,3dbxx1,landon0605,5,Wed Jul 15 02:22:49 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about Ortiz. He would have been great if he stayed with the Twins, but not an 400+ HR all-time great.  Lohse I'm not so sure about. He played for two other teams and had almost the same stats. It wasn't until he landed in St Louis that something clicked. Maybe a pitching coach or another veteran pitcher taught him something new? But if you're going to  accuse the Twins of not letting him be himself, you have to put that same blame on Cinci and Philly too."
minnesotatwins,3dbxx1,landon0605,2,Wed Jul 15 03:00:44 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I can agree with you on Lohse. But either way I don't think he would have ever been considered decent if  he played his whole career here.

minnesotatwins,3dbxx1,sirkarl,2,Wed Jul 15 12:01:13 2015 UTC,"My earliest memories of Davis Ortiz are that he could be counted on doing well if there were fewer than two outs and nobody on base but would never produce in the clutch.  I honestly don't buy that he was pressured into trying to hit to the opposite field, because he would always do alright in non-clutch situations. My guess is the mixture of being released, maturing and having a new environment/coaching staff is what let him show his full potential. Obviously as a Twins fan I wish we could have kept him, but from what I remember watching him (and the fact nobody claimed him when put on waivers) I don't feel any regret giving him up."
minnesotatwins,3dbxx1,sirkarl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:47:51 2015 UTC,"My memory of Ortiz with the Twins is a streaky and frequently injured hitter that showed promise when healthy. But after reviewing his stats...I'm not sure that was the case. I think I'm looking back with rose tinted glasses trying to justify the move. But I also didn't look that deep into his stats, so our initial thoughts could have some truth to them as well."
minnesotatwins,3dbxx1,CoconutMoose,2,Wed Jul 15 04:17:23 2015 UTC,"I just got to my computer and am checking out some of his more detailed stats, and it does seem there is some evidence he did well in the clutch.  I'm just looking at 2002 and he did hit .280 with 2 outs and RISP in what Baseball Reference considers clutch situations, though his average was .236 when in clutch situations while behind. His stat line was also atrocious in 2001. I also noticed that between 2001 and 2002 his salary increased from $260,000 to $950,000 and then $1,250,000 in 2003 his first year with the Red Sox.  This was a time when the Twins were almost at their height of penny pinching so I'm sure that rising salary did play a role in our decision.  Sorry for the long, possibly overly detailed rant.  I just remember being a kid and vividly remember David Ortiz and LaTroy Hawkins as two of the worst players we had.  And now they're only two of five players on that 2002 team still in the Majors..."

Consequently, if Hawk Harrelson called Twins games I wouldn't watch them again until he retired.  That guy is...just an asshole.  I remember having to watch a Twins/Sox game on WGN (no FSN coverage) and Morneau tried to lay down a rare bunt with runners on 1st and 2nd.  He was up against a lefty that he had like one hit against in his career.  Needless to say he couldn't do it.  The guy probably hadn't tried to bunt more than three times in his career to that point.  I thought it was hilarious.  Hawk not so much.

minnesotatwins,3d4qdv,CantaloupeCamper,10,Mon Jul 13 19:00:56 2015 UTC,"""..but you just helped beat the Detroit Tigers"" just sounded so anticlimactic to me. I think Dick should stick to calling the exciting moments."

So my story (sorry of you've seen me post it but its a classic) was watching a Twins v ChiSox game a few years back. Someone hit a foul ball into the stands and a happy, chubby kid in Sox gear gets the ball. Dick says, ""Well that a fine souvenir for the young lad!"". Bert not skipping a beat goes, ""Yeah if he doesn't eat it first"". Dick trying not to laugh calling the next play was great!"

This was (I believe) September of last year.   Since the Sox can't get to the playoffs tickets are cheap late. I got row 2 a section over from the Twins dugout.   I was walking to my seats when I see a player in warm up gear talking to a couple older fellahs. I got closer and noticed it was Dozier (right in front of my seats). So I ran down and the two older guys asked 'Do you know Brian?' I lit up like a 8 year old (I was 27 at the time). And I said 'Yeah! He's my favorite player!' The guys said 'Well, we, already know him; so how about you get to know him.'   They stepped aside and I got to talk with Dozier for about 15min. Seemed like a great guy and genuinely enjoys talking to his fans.   Getting the same seats again in September, cannot wait.  As a plus the Twins won that day :)"

minnesotatwins,3d6b5l,taksark,12,Mon Jul 13 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.  The MN Twins had a solid decade from 2000-2010 that included a string of division wins, individual successes (Mauer, Morneau, Santana, Hunter, Nathan), but no playoff success. 2010 marked a new era for the twins as they moved to the beautiful Target Field and earned what would be their last post season berth for the next four seasons. Since then we have seen old faces go (Cuddyer, Morneau, Gomez to name a few) to new places only to experience all-star success again while the new faces struggled to continue the success of the 2000's. 2015 has been a fresh start for the struggling franchise. Hall of fame player and St. Paul native Paul Molitor took over as manager, the pitching rotation (the team's biggest issue over the last four years) has been consistent and even great at times with Kyle Gibson, Mike Pelfrey, and Tommy Milone leading the way, Brian Dozier and Glen Perkins are both all stars, and finally, the twins have just been fun to watch again with plenty of late inning comebacks. The biggest reason for hope is the team's young players who have been called up to the majors this year. Miguel Sano in particular has made a huge impression. Pitching is still an area for concern for this team as is the lack of a true MVP type player as Mauer has underperformed since signing his huge contract. The team currently holds a wild card playoff spot as they are behind the surging Kansas City Royals.   Hope this helps!"

minnesotatwins,3d6b5l,polamity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"As far as this season goes the Twins have been just good enough to hang around. It's a bit suspenseful at the moment since it seems like the second half could go either way. The starting pitching has been totally over-performing and while no one in the order is batting .300 the hits have come at seemingly the most opportune times to keep the team above .500.   The bullpen needs help (besides Perkins, of course). Boyer, who was a huge part of the unbelievable month of May for the Twins cooled off but has looked better in his past few outings than the month before and now Trevor May could definitely be a solid middle reliever after Santana took his spot as a starter two weeks ago.  The last series against the Tigers it was great to see young guys like Aaron Hicks and Danny Santana finally step up and get big hits, they were both really struggling through June. The bottom of the order really carried the team to take three of four.  So far Sano has been on fire, hopefully it lasts. Twins hitting has been very steady but they really could use a Miguel Cabrera or Prince Fielder type hitter in the lineup. It's super early but hopefully Sano can be that high-average cleanup hitter the Twins have always lacked.  Defensively the Twins are in a pretty good spot. I love Torii Hunter but he's just not very good anymore. The rest of the outfield is phenomenal. Hicks can catch with the best and Rosario has an absolute cannon. Shortstop has been a bit of a hole with Nunez, Santana and Escobar each having a bit of a claim there. None of them are exceptional, but lately Santana has been very solid. Dozier's an All-Star, nuff said. Plouffe has really developed himself from pitiful into an above average everyday third-baseman. Mauer is just gifted, there are certainly better first-baseman but he hardly ever makes a mistake. Suzuki was an All-Star catcher last year and is great at stopping balls but not so much at throwing runners out."

If May could be another mid-90's work horse...it seems like those guys are more reliable.  (Perkins had the same route).  You shore up a good part of the bullpen with the 7th-8th-9th innings going May-Miller-Perkins.  That cuts down games a lot, which is HUGE.

If they wanted to get Johnny Cueto from Cincy, it would cost them at LEAST Buxton or Sano, in addition to 1-2 other prospects. Teams rebuild their entire upper farm system by trading their aces, the Twins don't need to do that."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,NotPercyChuggs,2,Mon Jul 13 19:39:40 2015 UTC,Buxton and Sano for Cueto? You're nuts. No way we'd give up that package and no way they'd think they could get it.

Also, sure the Twins can afford a $20m/year guy. We have $20m+/year invested in Nolasco and Santana. Certainly by getting rid of one or the other and their salary, we could afford an extra $10m on the books. Especially with Hunter's $10m coming off next year...this isn't the Metrodome $60m payroll team, bud.

minnesotatwins,3d5u29,NotPercyChuggs,3,Tue Jul 14 14:26:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think any team is crazy enough to give up a top-10 prospect for Cueto. Maybe for King Felix.   The A's traded a top-10 prospect, Addison Russell, for 3 months of Jeff Samardzija just last year. The Reds will absolutely demand Sano, Buxton, or perhaps a package of Berrios plus someone like Gordon if the Twins want to get Cueto. Cole Hamels would probably require Sano plus Berrios and others, since he is already under contract for multiple more years.  As for your money argument, sure for the next couple years they could afford an extra 20 million bucks. However, signing a free agent ace isn't just a 2-3 year thing. Jon Lester signed with the Cubs last year for 155 million over 6 years. David Price will get more than that (in years and dollars), Johnny Cueto will get about that, and Jeff Samardzija will get just below that.   Six years from now, the Twins will hopefully be looking at extending the contracts of Buxton and Sano, as well as possibly others. If each of them ends up as good as they could, they are looking at Joe Mauer type money at a minimum. That's 40-50 million a year right there, plus another 20-25 million for a 35-36 year old Johnny Cueto or Jeff Samardzija? No thanks. That's 75 million tied up in just over 10% of the 25-man roster.  I also think you are way overestimating the value of Ervin Santana right now. The Twins would have to be mighty persuasive (by eating $$) to get a team to take on 3.5 years and 40+ million dollars of a 32 year old number 3 starter coming off a PED suspension. Maybe if he has a really good second half, they could find a taker in the offseason, but it isn't usually good for your future FA recruiting to trade a guy 1 year into a 4 year deal.  As for your beef with Percy, he made a completely reasonable argument. There's a reason he is the top comment in this thread, and it isn't because he is upvoting himself.  Edit: Oops, just realized that Samardzija had a year left on his deal when the A's traded for him. On the other hand, they did trade away a pretty good, established MLB player (Cespedes) for 3 months of Jon Lester. So I guess maybe the Reds wouldn't ask for Sano or Buxton for Cueto, but I bet Berrios would be their target at a minimum."

You have to admit that's trollish to say though. It's just because the Gardy-era Twins always crumbled under pressure. It's a known fact you pretty much need a bona fide ace to get anywhere in the postseason.  Can't argue with your other points though."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,Naonadhe,4,Tue Jul 14 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"No, the Gardy Era Twins lost to better teams (with the exception being the 2006 Athletics). They never ""crumbled under the pressure"", they had inferior teams, even WITH an ace pitcher in Santana.  World Series winning teams and their aces, since 2007:  2014 Giants - Madison Bumgarner (Home grown)  2013 Red Sox - No ""ace"", closest thing was Lester (Home grown)  2012 Giants - Cain and Bumgarner (both Home grown)  2011 Cardinals - No ""ace"", 3 really solid starters (Carpenter, Garcia, Lohse)  2010 Giants - Cain and Lincecum, both home grown  2009 Yankees - Sabathia, who they gave 182 million to and now are stuck with him being washed up   2008 Phillies - Cole Hamels (home grown)  2007 Red Sox - Josh Beckett, who the Red Sox acquired from Florida in exchange for Hanley Ramirez and Anibal Sanchez, and 2 other prospects  So since 2007, only two teams have won the World Series with an ""ace"" pitcher that they went out and acquired. The Yankees with Sabathia via free agency, something the Twins will never do. And the Red Sox with Josh Beckett via trading two of their top prospects. The Twins equivalent of Hanley Ramirez and Anibal Sanchez would be Miguel Sano and Jose Berrios.  Do you want to trade Miguel Sano and Jose Berrios to the Phillies for Cole Hamels? Or the Reds for Johnny Cueto? I sure as shit do not. The Twins are not going to give a true ""ace"" pitcher a massive deal. It's not going to happen. Therefore, the best way to put together a championship caliber pitching staff is through developing the guys you already have, and acquiring solid rotation pieces as well as spectacular bullpens. An ace pitcher isn't worth much if he pitches 7 shutout innings, and then Casey Fien gives up back to back home runs and loses the game for you."

minnesotatwins,3d5u29,Cornholio4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that trading for an ace in the middle of a season is an act of desperation for teams that know their windows are closing (e.g. the Tigers). The teams that are selling those aces know that teams like those will overpay with their developed major leaguers and quality prospects just for a shot at the post season. Too bad the Tigers have no quality prospects.  I think that with Nolasco, Santana, and Hughes all guaranteed with their contracts through 2017/18/19, our hands are somewhat tied with respect to who we get in the offseason. Contracts aren't necessarily killing this team from a cash standpoint, since our salary caps are higher and we can still afford certain players as some contracts come off the books, but I think this team feels obligated to give their sunk cost players (namely Nolasco) every opportunity to justify the contract, even when there are better players on the depth chart.  Since 2016 will be the middle of Nolasco's four year contract and he's been hurt for approximately half of it (or will be, by the time the 2015 season ends), I wonder if the Twins will just eat his salary if he doesn't start 2016 living up to expectations. Santana, Hughes, Gibson, May are all but guaranteed 1-4 pitchers for the next 3-4 seasons, and if Berríos starts putting things together in AAA, he could be a viable starter in 2016 at the MLB level. That leaves Nolasco as the odd man out, and I would be surprised if the Twins didn't just eat the rest of the $12 million/year contract.  I don't know where that leaves them with acquiring a bona fide ""ace"" in the offseason, though. Anybody they sign as a free agent will demand stupid money and a lot of years, who will take away pitching opportunities from Berríos/Meyer/others, just because we suddenly have a logjam of pitchers who might be able to perform at the MLB level. The free agent market is actually ripe with talented pitchers this year (unlike last year where James Shields was considered top tier), so it'll be interesting to see what the Twins do, but I think they've bought themselves into a position where they can't really do anything over the offseason."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,The_Effing_Eagle,2,Tue Jul 14 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about contending for the World Series, then yes, we absolutely need to look for an ace one of these days in free agency. Nolasco and Santana may have been are highest paid free agent acquisitions in team history, but they're both been #2 or #3 starters their whole careers. No clue if the answer is Berrios, but he's definitely our best chance for an ace from inside the system right now.  If you're content with contending for AL Central titles, remember we had two years where we won the division with Carl Pavano, Francisco Liriano, Nick Blackburn, Kevin Slowey and Scott Baker holding down the rotation. We'd most likely be fine with what we've got right now if they continue to pitch like this."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,Terror34,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"This isn't your dad's AL Central anymore, though. While I think the Tigers are on the downswing, the Indians and the Royals will likely be competitive for years to come, making it a tougher race.  That said, I like our homegrown options in Gibson, May, and Berríos (and I think they'll also afford Meyer every opportunity to start again), but we have contracts on the books for Hughes, Nolasco, and now Santana for multiple years each. Not to mention if they hold onto Tommy Milone (I think they'll try to move him, personally), that's an overfull roster without even adding an ""ace"" via free agency."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,starlitmint,2,Tue Jul 14 16:01:17 2015 UTC,Even Kershaw got rocked in last year's playoffs.
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,tennisspears,2,Tue Jul 14 01:07:52 2015 UTC,"No, I don't believe that we should throw mega dollars at a free agent. Most of these guys are entering their 30's and will require ludicrous contracts that will harm the team long term. For mid-market teams, you absolutely have to develop your ""aces"" in house. How many aces can you name that are over the age of 32? Sure those first few years can be great with an ace from FA, but we don't have the payroll to survive the second half of the deal like the big payroll teams do.  The key for the Twins is developing your rotation in house opening up cap space for signing FA hitters and extending current players (Dozier, Buxton, Sano, etc). As others have mentioned, we have some promising young arms in the system. They won't turn into a Kershaw or Bumgarner but there are very few of those players in all of baseball. Gibson has taken huge strides in his second full year in the bigs. May has taken even bigger steps in his first full year prior to being sent to the pen.  Don't forget about drafts and international free agency as well. Chris Sale was an ace two years after being drafted. Jose Fernandez was an ace 2 years after his international signing. Masahiro Tanaka was an ace his first year after signing (huge contract but the Yankees are getting his best years from age 25-32 rather than 31-late 30's that most free agents will require)."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,starlitmint,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:38:35 2015 UTC,"Berrios just might surprise us, he's still super young after all. But you're right, definitely no lights out no-doubter on the horizon with a 98 mph fastball and 3 other dirty pitches.  This season I think we should ride it out and see how good our offense is, and if we're looking legit the maybe trade or sign an ace in the off season. I really don't want to give up top prospects or $150m if we're not close to being 100% legit contenders.  That being said, I think it is extremely important in the postseason. You grind for 6 months and then SO much rides on Game 1s. Having a dominant No. 1 is critical to getting the series lead and probably plays a big part in a team's confidence and getting into your opponent's heads. I think that's especially important for the Twins, who have had such heart breaking series losses over and over during Gardy's run."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,doublea08,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on what you mean by ace. Kyle Gibson is the Twins best pitcher by fWAR and his 1.0 win is good for 66th in the majors. I don't think the current rotation is good enough to carry the team in the playoffs, but we also don't necessarily need an elite pitcher, but someone in the top 30 might do with good offense."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,Cornholio4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:52:17 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, Gibson is slowly turning into our Ace. The last few games he has pitched have been an absolute pleasure to watch. I've been hearing rumors of the Twins looking for some relief help on the trading market, specifically from the A's. The A's also want to move Scott Kazmir who has been eating teams alive. Add him to a reliever deal and we have a playoff ball club."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,doublea08,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:37:02 2015 UTC,"I wanted to look into this a bit deeper, because I had the same thought. Just looking at the recent past, here is a list of ""aces"" for the AL and NL winners:  Bumgarner, Shields, Lester, Wainwright, Zito, Verlander, Carpenter, CJ Wilson, Lincecum, Lee, Sabathia, Lee (again), Hamels, Kazmir, Beckett, Francis  I would say that more often than not, having a top 10 starting pitcher matters. Almost every pennant winner had a pitcher who was near the top of their league at the position."
minnesotatwins,3d5u29,Cornholio4,2,Tue Jul 14 13:10:53 2015 UTC,"First off, I am replacing Barry Zito with Matt Cain for the 2012 Giants, because Zito was not their ace. He was their highest paid pitcher, but he was probably their 4th best in 2012, behind Cain, Bumgarner, and Vogelsong. Zito is an example of a free agent ace acquisition that failed miserably.  Now that I have done that, what do most of those guys in your list have in common? Of those 16 pitchers, only 5 were acquired either by a big free agent signing or by a blockbuster trade (Shields, Lee, Lee, Sabathia, and Beckett). Ten of the other 11 were developed by the team they ended up taking to the World Series. (Carpenter is a little different. He signed a cheap deal with the Cardinals and revived his career after sucking with Toronto.)   You need to be able to develop your own young pitching in the MLB. The free agent aces are almost always over 30, and they all want contracts that will pay them 20+ million a year until they are 37-38 years old. They might be worth the money for the first few years, but by the end of the deal, you are going to be paying way more than they are worth because of injuries and/or ineffectiveness (see: CC Sabathia and Cliff Lee now)."

Here's hoping they keep it up in the second half. I could see us trying to make a move or two. Nothing major. Maybe a bullpen arm and a decent backup catcher. But this team is going to sink or swim with the young guys: Hicks, Santana, Buxton, Sano. It's been and will be fun to watch. Such a breathe of fresh air from Gardy and his old veteran retread approach."
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,InfiniteDeWitt,17,Sun Jul 12 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, 10 games isn't many yet, but the kid is impressive so far."
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,Crash_Gordon,20,Sun Jul 12 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"I expected so little out of him after seeing Buxton's disappointing debut, but he looks like a veteran already. I'm more impressed that he has almost never chased a ball out of the strike zone than I am by his power and contact. They shouldn't have him run that much though, he isn't as fast as he seems to think he is."
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,Crash_Gordon,19,Sun Jul 12 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"LOL,  I wouldn't give up on Buxton yet. Even Willie Mayes started out 0-23."
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,FlannelBeard,5,Sun Jul 12 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, i just want him to go to AAA when he gets healthy. I felt like he wasn't ready from what I was seeing, so he should get more reps before they call him back up."
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,Convulsed,6,Sun Jul 12 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he goes to AAA. The game he got injured in, he went 3-5. Granted it was against danks, but his following game was against sale, which is tough for everyone"
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,FlannelBeard,5,Sun Jul 12 19:55:49 2015 UTC,"You have to send him down. He looked completely lost at the plate and right now, Hicks is playing too well not to be in the lineup every day."
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,taffyowner,3,Mon Jul 13 02:38:13 2015 UTC,How do you take someone out of the Twin's lineup when even Hicks is doing well?
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,babaoriley7,3,Sun Jul 12 19:57:18 2015 UTC,Could platoon Hicks in RF with hunter. I just really want a Rosario Buxton Hicks outfield.
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,taffyowner,2,Sun Jul 12 19:58:57 2015 UTC,I dont think platooning hicks is the answer right now...

minnesotatwins,3d1cje,thetimeisnow1095,5,Sun Jul 12 21:05:45 2015 UTC,"So perfectly appropriate that a guy playing in Minnesota has the last name that sounds like ""snow"" spoken by someone with a thick northern US/Canadian accent."
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,AlongCamePollyIsBae,2,Sun Jul 12 21:57:27 2015 UTC,It's like somebody with a stutter giving me the MN weather update every time he comes up to bat.
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,gropius,5,Mon Jul 13 18:18:40 2015 UTC,I'm mostly impressed with how smart he's been playing. He doesn't chase very often and he takes a lot of walks. And he's been smart with running the bases too. And damn Every time he makes contact it seems like it has a chance to go long. He hits the ball really hard
minnesotatwins,3d1cje,Terror34,2,Mon Jul 13 08:20:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of his strikeouts are after he falls behind he battles and goes deeper into a count as pitchers try and make him chase with stuff out of the zone.  But he doesn't and he forces them to throw a strike, if it's a perfect pitch on the edge of the zone you might get him looking, tip the cap to the pitcher, or you throw him a strike...and he's got a good chance to hit a ball in the strike zone some play hard."

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,y2jayjk,3,Sun Jul 12 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"Out of all the sports, it's the only All-Star game I watch - the Pro Bowl is obviously a joke. NBA has gone the way of the Pro Bowl with no defense and guys playing to the crowd. NHL, I don't know. I like the Wild, but that's about it. I guess I'm a bigger baseball fan than hockey fan.  MLB seems like the only one where the guys actually try - even before it counted (which I still think is silly). I think the game probably just lends itself better to an All-Star game - you can't really just not play defense. Pitchers have too much pride. And you aren't really putting yourself at excessive injury risk by participating (to a point - I don't think baserunners should bulldoze anyone over or something).  Maybe more than anything, it's just a very rich summer tradition."

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,imissedthetoilet,6,Sun Jul 12 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"Yup......you never know after the All-Star break though, it's weird. Momentum comes and goes. Look at the A's after the break last year. Which is where our first series will be after the break and it's been a horror show there for the Twins recently."
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,Kripzo,2,Sun Jul 12 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"Eh, the A's don't have any of the players that made them great. Donaldson, Cespedes, Moss, and MLB Ace Tommy Milone are all gone from the roster."

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,Phillyboy101,3,Sun Jul 12 19:36:23 2015 UTC,Assuming the score holds. A great way to go into the real going 6-1
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,ChiefakaJames,4,Sun Jul 12 19:36:20 2015 UTC,What a difference a couple days make. Should look at comments here and tweets from Twins fans during Friday's game before the 9th inning. People were ready to burn it all down.

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:32:09 2015 UTC,"Rosario was never really a SS. He was a 2B. And he wasn't particularly good at it, just meh."
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,Garrus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:35:45 2015 UTC,Rosario played at 2nd base and his natural position is the outfield. He isn't capable of playing shortstop.
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,Cornholio4,2,Sun Jul 12 19:35:33 2015 UTC,Rosario was moved to the OF because he struggled defensively playing the infield.

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,thetimeisnow1095,2,Sun Jul 12 19:31:07 2015 UTC,With Hicks improvement I'd send Buxton to AAA when he's healthy.  Make the MLB OF Rosario-Hicks-Hunter...  Let Plouffe-Santana-Dozier-Mauer get the majority of the reps at the INF positions and Sano can get the majority of reps at DH.  Let Buxton-Arcia-Vargas-Polanco gell together at AAA and really dominate together.  Edit-Didn't mean to put Sano there meant Arcia
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,serpentinepad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:29:53 2015 UTC,And go back to have Nunez and Escobar at DH?  No thank you.

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,novafire08,3,Sun Jul 12 20:00:02 2015 UTC,You'd send Sano down even though he's been red hot? He looks like he belongs up here and doesn't need more minor league time.
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,Cornholio4,3,Sun Jul 12 19:32:23 2015 UTC,Sano is in the majors though? Why send him down? I do agree with Buxton however.

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,Kripzo,4,Sun Jul 12 19:28:34 2015 UTC,Is Hicks the most improved player for the Twins this year?
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 12 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Him, Pelfrey, and Gibson are all good candidates."

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,imissedthetoilet,5,Sun Jul 12 19:28:47 2015 UTC,I always thought of Gibson as a contact pitcher and figured he would be of the Nick Blackburn type (sinker baller).......what's he doing different this year? Is velocity up? The strikeouts surprise me more than anything.
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 12 19:21:21 2015 UTC,"Velocity is staying the same, vertical movement on sinker, slider, and change-up have all gone up. Horizontal and vertical location of the slider has improved greatly, as well."
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 12 19:26:43 2015 UTC,His slider has really been missing bats lately.
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,thetimeisnow1095,2,Sun Jul 12 19:22:59 2015 UTC,He was a pretty good strikeout pitcher in the minors.  Lowest K rate at any level in the minors was 7.5k/9ip
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,tennisspears,4,Sun Jul 12 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"Guys, Gibson has been really, really good since the beginning of June. His ERA doesn't show it, but he is striking guys out a lot more and getting a ton of ground balls."

minnesotatwins,3d12t9,NorseWolves,2,Sun Jul 12 18:58:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, maybe getting thrown out trying to steal isnt such a good idea huh?"
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 12 18:58:14 2015 UTC,"It was a hit-and-run, not a straight steal."
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,NorseWolves,0,Sun Jul 12 19:00:41 2015 UTC,It just seems we get thrown out every time. Yesterday there was a strikeout and throw out on a hit and run. We arent great at it.
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 12 19:02:53 2015 UTC,"On hit-and-runs specifically, it's a play that happens across baseball about 3% of the time when the opportunity is available. Only from my memory this season (can't find the stats), I've seen them successfully have a hit-and-run twice, and fail three times. That's not nearly enough times for me to worry about being a problem."
minnesotatwins,3d12t9,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 12 19:19:25 2015 UTC,"They're not good at it, no. 44 SB are 16th in MLB, but they've now been caught stealing the most (with Detroit) at 31 CS, and SB% is 26th.  But it is a pretty important part to the offensive game, especially when you have guys like Dozier, Hicks, Santana on the bases. Station to station baseball is too predictable and relies too much on getting those ""big hits"" that people also seem to think the Twins aren't good at either.  Running into outs isn't fun, and that inning with Hicks being caught in a hit-and-run may have cost them a run, but that doesn't mean to give up on it."

minnesotatwins,3czjqa,NorseWolves,10,Sun Jul 12 05:20:11 2015 UTC,"We all were, to be honest.  Hell, there was an /r/baseball thread for when the Twins finally scored a run.  Things did not get off to a great start, but this resilient team showed us why we still do, and always will love them."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,thetimeisnow1095,14,Sat Jul 11 22:18:07 2015 UTC,If Hicks keeps this up i can see him in the corner OF instead of Arcia.
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,rabaltera,2,Sun Jul 12 01:43:07 2015 UTC,"Arcia's going to at minimum hit 30 HRs a year.  His major league numbers weren't/aren't even bad for a prospect ""struggling"" and in his stages of development.    Arcia crushes the ball.  K rate be damned...he's a career .300 hitter in the minors.  He'll figure it out."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,Kripzo,4,Sun Jul 12 01:48:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that he has a lot of offensive potential, but I'm not sure that is what the Twins would need if they kept both Sano and Vargas. I can't imagine Arcia taking an outfield role over Hicks, Buxton, or Rosario. If anything, I could see the Twins having Arcia DH and trade Vargas. That, or having one of those players on the bench and used as a replacement player."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,Yessirmrmonkey,4,Sun Jul 12 02:02:13 2015 UTC,"I think we'd regret trading either of them.  Gomez, Ortiz, Span, Revere, Hunter even...  Why do we continually convince ourselves to let our best offensive prospects go after spending so much time developing them, usually from a really young age...to give up on them for actually showing a lot of flashes of potential in their first stints in the majors.  Both being called up straight from AA if I recall correctly."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,PhatGiraffe42,2,Sun Jul 12 02:04:53 2015 UTC,"I just see no reason to trade a guy who's only 24 and already has hit 20 HRs in 103 games in the past?    And his struggling is a .720 OPS and .276avg in 19 whole games.    Not to mention in 99 whole AAA games he's hit 23 HRs - 22 2Bs - 76 RBIs, 36 BBs, 93 K's hitting .294/.369/.556 for a .925 OPS...  So let's see he's 24 and has both averaged a season on which if healthy he would post 30+ HR seasons and 90+ RBI's in AAA and the MLB...I don't think it's wise to give up on him."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,skymind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:19:01 2015 UTC,Because suddenly the OF is really crowded and that's not a bad thing. Trade to make team better elsewhere. So Meyer and Capps didn't work out but we did get May who has shown he can be a big league starter. Trades look a lot smarter if the club gets it right
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,PhatGiraffe42,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"I realize that and instead of a lot of OF stability, we got Trevor May basically.  We don't have to lose that value.    I think if anyone gets moved it's likely Rosario."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,dat_1_dude,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"Arcia is a defensive liability, and hasn't had any major success yet. I like the idea of trading him imo, could definitely come back to bite us but he's got as much trade value as anyone minus our studs. Ill take a defensive outfielder who bats .240 for contact (Hicks) over a defensive liability who bats .220 with occasional HRs and tons of strikeouts (Arcia)."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,FrankReynolds,2,Sun Jul 12 21:28:05 2015 UTC,His trade value is not very high atm.  And where the hell are you getting him batting .220 from? He's never hit that low. I swear no hater has looked at his numbers before.  The amount of people that recommend trading him is ridiculous. I would only swap him for a very similar prospect at a position of need.
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,TrustMeIAMAProfessor,0,Mon Jul 13 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"Alright my bad .230 haha. Just saying there's no room on this team for a defensive liability all because he may or may not hit a home run here and there. Not to mention we already have a log jam in the outfield as it is. I'd keep Buxton, Rosario and Hicks all before I'd wanna keep Arcia. Also there's not even room for him to DH with Mauer/Plouffe/Sano, and that's the only way to cover up him being a defensive liability."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,The_No_Lifer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:59:44 2015 UTC,How about a platoon of Arcia and Hicks?
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,enemyoftheworld,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:24:50 2015 UTC,"As much as I want to see Arcia in a Twins jersey in the future, I can't help but think he'll be dealt this year for relief pitching."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,SQLNerd,7,Sun Jul 12 04:31:54 2015 UTC,"So young. Suddenly so much fun to watch. I completely agree with you about Sano, but I'd add that while Buxton hasn't had quite the same impact on the field, his arrival in the big leagues created a similar buzz. Anyway, that's mostly just to echo your great point. It's unreal to see those ages next to roster names, exciting stuff!"
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,Weegemonster5000,6,Sun Jul 12 01:28:23 2015 UTC,"Trevor Plouffe will either be the starting 3B or he won't be on the team.  Better fielder than Sano will be, and some team will give us value if we want Sano to play 3B"
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,SQLNerd,4,Sun Jul 12 12:44:06 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised anyone still thinks of Sano as a third baseman. The Twins' defense is finally back to acceptable levels and we want to replace one of the better third basemen in the league with Sano who almost assuredly would be the worst?  If Sano can take at DH and Plouffe can maintain something close to his current offensive output, that seems like a rather good solution to both solutions."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,enemyoftheworld,2,Sun Jul 12 13:48:55 2015 UTC,You forget pretty quickly that Plouffe's defense was not good at Sano's age. Give him more time to develop.
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,RobertService,2,Sun Jul 12 14:04:08 2015 UTC,Difference being Plouffe needed to bring a glove to be an MLB player. Sano is the kind of talent where that leather part is almost completely optional.
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,taffyowner,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:13:10 2015 UTC,I don't disagree. Simply saying that Sano could certainly develop into a fine corner infielder.
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,SQLNerd,2,Sun Jul 12 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"How? He has no lateral range. Plouffe had athleticism that needed to be translated to skill at a specific position. Sano has nothing to translate. His footwork and positioning has improved, but his ceiling is far lower than Plouffe's and it's not really close."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,Phillyboy101,3,Sun Jul 12 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"Also, Plouffe started as a shortstop. It's a lot easier to turn a shortstop into a 3rd baseman than it it to turn a DH into a 3B."
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,taffyowner,2,Sun Jul 12 15:50:17 2015 UTC,Sano started as a SS as well...
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,audiocranium,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:45:43 2015 UTC,Never said he'd be a better defender than plouffe. Just that he could certainly start and be passable in this league.  Honestly I see sano more as a 1st baseman than 3rd. Mauer is the obvious road block there but sano could certainly be a future replacement.
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,pman5595,3,Sun Jul 12 15:54:25 2015 UTC,What about Tommy Milone? He's been pretty lights out since being recalled.
minnesotatwins,3cyed2,Taub-NUT,2,Sun Jul 12 20:43:53 2015 UTC,Arcia doesn't have a future with the team if he doesn't figure out any plate discipline

minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Tannekr,6,Sat Jul 11 23:32:30 2015 UTC,"Stop showing off Torii, wait, never mind, continue showing off."
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Gallade3,4,Sat Jul 11 23:30:37 2015 UTC,That's an amazing play to steal that hit.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,BeeboBaggins,5,Sat Jul 11 23:30:23 2015 UTC,Hell of a catch by Torii! Woo!
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jul 11 23:30:01 2015 UTC,Wow....Torii!!!
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,StuntmanMichael123,2,Sat Jul 11 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"Alright, tigers last chance, are we seeing Perkins?  Edit: Yep it's Perkins! Holy crap nice catch torii!"
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Whatdo_22,2,Sat Jul 11 23:27:46 2015 UTC,This game is so long. Nothing is happening anymore.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Derk-Derks,5,Sat Jul 11 23:26:20 2015 UTC,That maybe the most unfortunate double play of all time.

minnesotatwins,3cxt07,StuntmanMichael123,2,Sat Jul 11 23:22:23 2015 UTC,"Wow scraped past that inning.  I can't blame Fien though, he had a strikeout and went 0-2 3 more times, just good hitting by the tigers."
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Whatdo_22,2,Sat Jul 11 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you Rosario, Fien wants to kill all the Twins fans."
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,BeeboBaggins,5,Sat Jul 11 23:18:28 2015 UTC,Just made this. Torii's two-run shot.

minnesotatwins,3cxt07,StuntmanMichael123,3,Sat Jul 11 22:56:18 2015 UTC,Hicks-Suzuki-Santana have been a more than respectable 7-8-9 these last few games.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jul 11 22:52:10 2015 UTC,I always love a game where everyone in the line-up gets a hit
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,thebearjew41,3,Sat Jul 11 22:52:07 2015 UTC,Hicks and Sano have been killing their at-bats lately.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Tannekr,3,Sat Jul 11 22:51:34 2015 UTC,Dare I say.....Aaron Hicks has looked good at the plate? He's been selective. That's 90% of the battle.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,imissedthetoilet,4,Sat Jul 11 22:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he has definitely changed his tactics and is not swinging at everything.  And it is paying off pretty well for him.  He is playing smart and supporting the team greatly."
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,AdaAstra,4,Sat Jul 11 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"We have been hitting like crazy, but I'm not feeling very comfortable about this game...  Can't wait for this game to be over."

minnesotatwins,3cxt07,StuntmanMichael123,3,Sat Jul 11 22:49:48 2015 UTC,Ever since I started calling Duensing Brian the Dunce he's done better. I'll keep that up.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,BeeboBaggins,2,Sat Jul 11 22:46:46 2015 UTC,Our pitchers have done some damn good fielding lately.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,MN_Logan,5,Sat Jul 11 22:46:22 2015 UTC,With a guy on the corners and no outs. That was a damn fine inning for Duensing.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,StuntmanMichael123,3,Sat Jul 11 22:46:09 2015 UTC,Cepedes has just been had.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,StuntmanMichael123,2,Sat Jul 11 22:43:19 2015 UTC,Anybody but the Dunce.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,BeeboBaggins,2,Sat Jul 11 22:40:35 2015 UTC,Has Boyer made it through a complete inning this season? I have not seen him do one good thing.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,SmordinTsolusG,4,Sat Jul 11 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"Then you haven't been watching. He isn't great, but he has had a lot of good outings."
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,tennisspears,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:42:03 2015 UTC,Well that's good then. I've apparently been choosing just the ones he sucks in.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,SmordinTsolusG,2,Sat Jul 11 22:47:16 2015 UTC,"At this point, it's whose bullpen can play worse."
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Tannekr,3,Sat Jul 11 22:39:43 2015 UTC,What the hell are you supposed to do when a dribbler to 3rd and a grounder to 1st turns into runners at the corners...
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,BeeboBaggins,3,Sat Jul 11 22:39:37 2015 UTC,This has to be the most comments I've seen in a thread before.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,kaiserj1982,5,Sat Jul 11 22:39:31 2015 UTC,Asking more than 1 inning out of the big ginger might be pressing your luck.

minnesotatwins,3cxt07,StuntmanMichael123,5,Sat Jul 11 22:23:37 2015 UTC,Sano might be the anti-Rosario in every way. Selective and mashes. Although Rosario has shown his fair share of power.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,OrbitsUnbounded,4,Sat Jul 11 22:21:29 2015 UTC,"Greadt walk Sano, down 0-2!"
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Derk-Derks,6,Sat Jul 11 22:21:25 2015 UTC,I'm seriously impressed with his patience.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Mailing_a_Bear,6,Sat Jul 11 22:21:12 2015 UTC,How many times has Sano worked the count 3-2? Seems like it happens  twice a game.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,6,Sat Jul 11 22:21:08 2015 UTC,Hot-dog man almost got DOMED.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,Derk-Derks,4,Sat Jul 11 22:18:19 2015 UTC,They got a number on how long that was?  He crushed that ball.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jul 11 22:18:13 2015 UTC,I'm going to guess 415........standing by for results.
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,phernoree,3,Sat Jul 11 22:19:40 2015 UTC,426 was the estimate.  https://twitter.com/DerekWetmore/status/619993978096611328

minnesotatwins,3cxt07,StuntmanMichael123,2,Sat Jul 11 22:19:31 2015 UTC,"Nah, still about 85 feet short of Stanton's HR Derby bomb. They estimated his at 510."
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,tennisspears,2,Sat Jul 11 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't expecting the estimated distance to be really close, but they both got into the 3rd deck."

A little belly bump never hurt anyone but the umps don't take kindly to it.   Now that I think about it if the MLB regulates how big elbow/arm protection can be to prevent guys from generating tons of HBP, can they regulate umpire belly depth? I'm sure someone's accidentally bumped an ump because the ump was using performance enhancing twinkies, thus leading to a suspension."
minnesotatwins,3cxt07,OrbitsUnbounded,3,Sat Jul 11 21:52:30 2015 UTC,Victor Martinez has a great case? Shit was a strike you fucking mong.

minnesotatwins,3cxt07,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jul 11 21:49:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a ball. It's the kind of pitch that you will get if you have had good command all day. So Hughes was lucky to get it there, because he has not had that command."

minnesotatwins,3cxcap,Cheehos,8,Sat Jul 11 16:44:40 2015 UTC,"Sano got called up for the Royals series and has not only hit very well, he has taken very mature at bats, drawn walks and looked way better than I expected for a guy who just got called up. A lot of guys come up and hit right away but very few show the plate discipline that he has. The Twins split the four game set with Kansas City, getting great starting pitching from Gibson, Santana, Pelfrey and Milone and lost ballgames on walk offs after the bullpen couldn't replicate the starters' success. Overall, the Twins played really well against the best team in the AL on the road and probably should have taken 3 of 4. Returning home, the Twins swept the Orioles behind more good hitting from Sano, a Dozier walk-off in the first game, Sano's first home run in the second game in a more lopsided win, in the third game the Twins trailed for most of the game until Brian Dozier hit a go-ahead two run home run which Mauer followed up with a HR in the next at bat making it 3-1. Twins added two more and would surrender a pair of solo homers before winning 5-3. David Price shut them down game 1 of the Tigers series. Last night, the Twins couldn't figure out Verlander all night, popping up fastball after fastball. The Tigers hit a two run shot, three run shot and solo bomb off Santana to lead 6-0 into the eighth. The Twins got a run after Rosario got an infield hit, Suzuki singled to left center and Dozier hit a check swing liner to right to drive in Rosario with two outs. In the ninth, the Twins got a seeing-eye single up the middle from Mauer, a ground rule double to left from Sano, RBI single to left from Rosario, walk to Hicks loaded the bases, Suzuki got hit in the shoulder by a breaking ball that he clearly was looking to take for the team to score Sano. Danny Santana hit a hot shot to center for a 2-run single and then Dozier hit a three-run walk-off homerun and the fanbase collectively messed their trousers in joy. THE END."

However, you are right... that would never happen in this situation because the run doesn't matter."

I am a little annoyed with bandwagon Royals fan, but I don't blame them as I'd do the same in their shoes. This problem is on the MLB and something they'll probably fix.   I'm all for fueling a rivalry but I'm tired of seeing ""Fuck KC fans"" for voting for their player."
minnesotatwins,3cukti,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Fri Jul 10 22:23:19 2015 UTC,Yeah anything that keeps your attention on MLB in the social media era is huge for them when attention is so hard to get for anyone. Look how much marketing this sub effectively did for MLB with the #votedozier stuff. It won't be going away.
minnesotatwins,3cukti,casual_sociopathy,4,Sat Jul 11 03:50:37 2015 UTC,Exactly I mean players get in that have no business getting in. Moustakas is playing ok but not All Star level and definitely not better then Dozier. Sucks because the players who really deserve to go don't because of bandwagon fans.

minnesotatwins,3cukti,DayToDayInFlipFlops,10,Fri Jul 10 22:12:32 2015 UTC,"Please don't blame the Royals and their fans for this too. It's a fan vote. The whole purpose of the system is to vote for your favorite and the Royals fans did exactly that. Blame the MLB for using this completely stupid method to choose All-Stars. ""What'd you do to earn your All-Star appearance?"" ""A bunch of other people moved their thumbs around a little bit, a bunch of times."" Completely nullifies the prestige of the event and selection in my opinion."
minnesotatwins,3cukti,ClemDeLaClem,11,Fri Jul 10 22:56:11 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating because the Royals have plenty of representation, yet one of the best in the game right now was snubbed by their manager to make room for more Royals players. So yes, I fully blame and fully hate the Royals."
minnesotatwins,3cukti,tennisspears,6,Fri Jul 10 23:43:53 2015 UTC,"Yost not picking him from the start was pretty weak, although Kipnis deserved it too. He does know this game could determine whether his team gets home field advantage, right? Prick"
minnesotatwins,3cukti,ClemDeLaClem,3,Fri Jul 10 23:49:30 2015 UTC,"Yost made room for one player, Herrera, who is a reliever so it probably was completely unrelated to not picking Dozier. Davis was voted in by the players. If the Indians had another guy in the All-Star game Kipnis wouldn't have been selected and Dozier would be in his place. Which, again, is the system requiring a player from each team and not the fault of Royals fans. I'm not advocating for the Royals cause they rub me the wrong way too but the blame falls squarely on MLB and the vitriol should be directed at the system rather than those who operated fairly within it. I mean it's such an easy fix to just have players vote."
minnesotatwins,3cukti,mostdope92,6,Sat Jul 11 00:23:58 2015 UTC,"If the Indians had another guy in the All-Star game Kipnis wouldn't have been selected and Dozier would be in his place.   Are you serious? Kipnis has been the best 2B in the league, and is a legit MVP candidate right now. He was rightly the winner of the player's vote. There's no way Dozier belonged ahead of him."
minnesotatwins,3cukti,DayToDayInFlipFlops,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:16:56 2015 UTC,You're right. I didn't realize just how good his season was. Thought he and Dozier were neck and neck. His numbers are ridiculous.
minnesotatwins,3cukti,CantaloupeCamper,2,Sat Jul 11 02:54:16 2015 UTC,See that's what doesn't make sense to me. Why in the hell would you include a player on the final vote if he is already from the most represented team? Especially when its the same team who was found to have fans tampering/taking advantage of the voting system.  I put more blame on the MLB than the Royals. Although the amount of players voted in and the whole voting issue does make it easy to blame and dislike the Royals and their fans.

Dozier deserved a chance to represent his team, but the Twins aren't popular after going 4 straight years with loosing seasons.  KC has a lot of band wagoners from the surprise WS visit last year.  The hype will die down.    On that note, the voting system needs to be looked into.  Why unlimited votes?  Why 35 votes?  I don't get it."
minnesotatwins,3cukti,Killoran,5,Fri Jul 10 23:16:55 2015 UTC,Words cannot express my disappointment. A rage has been brought to a terrifying and powerful boil and it will not cool until the Royals are back at the bottom of the standings without their bandwagon fans.

minnesotatwins,3cukti,BeeboBaggins,4,Fri Jul 10 22:44:48 2015 UTC,I may be wrong but I think the last MVP who wasn't also an all-star was Morneau.

To make matters worse, the purpose of the game is a joke -- last year Glen Perkins pitched to Kurt Suzuki to get the Royals home field advantage in the World Series.  That's ridiculous on its face.    Since we have to have interleague play, let that decide home field in the World Series.  If teams play each other, use their head to head record.  If they don't, let the leagues' records against each other decide.  Spleen vented.  Continuing to #VoteDozier."

minnesotatwins,3cp0fv,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"Right. I'm not worried. If they discard them were right back where we started. TBH the way cellular carriers work, there is realistically a 0.01% chance of them being able to tell. Their inbox will only know when it was received, not when it was sent.

minnesotatwins,3crja6,danbobbbb,2,Fri Jul 10 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"I feel as if the general population is, let's say 'annoyed' at KC   The thing is everyone votes for their own team not just KC. Also with it being in the news so much people from places other than KC were voting tons of Royals fans in. In my opinion I hope this shows that the fan vote should be changed. To say ""nothing against KC and their voting methods"" is odd because there are posts here and other places on how to set up a 'text bomb' to spam votes. They aren't using some secret method nobody knows about. They aren't doing anything no other teams fans would.   I mean the top like 5 or 6 posts on this sub is about how to flood votes. Honestly Dozier deserves to get in over Moose that's a fact. But watching this from a distance, how everyone 'is angry' at the royals is just silly. You mean to tell me nobody else is voting for their favorite team players?! Even ones that do not deserve to get in?? Even in STL we were voting players that did not deserve an ASG bid.   Don't be mad at the Royals or the fans, be mad at the system that lets you vote what 50 times an email address? Also blame their Google Fiber!"
minnesotatwins,3crja6,gocardsgoSTL,2,Fri Jul 10 13:48:43 2015 UTC,I'm not angry at the Royals.  I'm angry at the process.  It's stuff like this that makes people think about taking the vote away from fans.  The process is a joke.  Giving WS home field advantage to the winner of an exhibition game is a joke.  And deserving players in the fans' game getting left off because of a joke process is making people angry.  And rightly so.
minnesotatwins,3crja6,tenthreeleader,2,Fri Jul 10 14:47:12 2015 UTC,Giving WS home field advantage to the winner of an exhibition game is a joke   yup totally agree! Hopefully the MLB will also find a better way to vote players in or select who goes.
minnesotatwins,3cpljh,hinayu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:30:02 2015 UTC,Where do you live? There are no park and ride lots right on the Green line between the two cities...it would be park at your own risk. You can park at Rosedale and take a 10 minute bus ride to University and catch the train there. Otherwise parking in downtown Minneapolis is not that difficult. I don't know about free after 5:00...but I usually park in the LaSalle Ramp for $5.00 after 5:00.

For $5, the LaSalle Ramp sound like a good way to go...  How bad is it getting out of there after a game?

minnesotatwins,3ck2vm,FrankReynolds,8,Wed Jul 8 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"Let's look at the positives.    Dozier is in 2nd and has been getting a lot of traction lately.  I don't think Moose is staying at #1 because most of the nation believes there's enough royals. Moustakas is having a good year and all, but with Royals fans almost voting in Infante ... That rustled everyone's feathers so I think we'll see more Dozier votes to help get him past Moose.  I thought Gardner would be up higher with his really great start and the big market. So beating him out so far is good news, he's my other AL choice if Dozier doesn't win it. But he WILL!"

minnesotatwins,3ckcct,twh1297,2,Wed Jul 8 19:58:08 2015 UTC,Frasor was DFA'd by the Royals. There is talk of Milwaukee shopping Cotts.
minnesotatwins,3ckcct,Kruse,2,Wed Jul 8 20:03:34 2015 UTC,Heard about the Cotts thing. Hope we can get him...
minnesotatwins,3ckcct,twh1297,2,Wed Jul 8 20:06:00 2015 UTC,Bernadino speculated that the Twins are an interested party in Cotts as well.

minnesotatwins,3cf99p,gopherman23,8,Tue Jul 7 13:29:29 2015 UTC,"He's not exactly rotting in AAA. Outside of the last 10 days he hasn't been playing all that great. For Arcia to get called up, he has to prove that his offensive capabilities are ready and able to produce at a level that outweigh his terrible defense. Despite his recent hot streak, his line is still .260/.292/.441. That OBP is pretty explanatory as to why he is not being called up along with there being no room for him to play.  Now what to do with him? A trade is definitely an option. I doubt we move him however as we have seen his power potential at the big league level and he is still under team control for 5 years (including this year). Personally I think we hold onto him and hope things start clicking in AAA, at least for this year."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,Cornholio4,5,Tue Jul 7 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"Outside of the last 10 days he hasn't been playing all that great.   And teams know that. People here and on Twitter are saying ""sell high now!"" after he hits a few homers. Teams aren't stupid enough to bite on a week long AAA hot streak for a guy who strikes out 30% of the time in the MLB. The same goes for Pelfrey. The Twins didn't ""miss their chance"" to trade a guy who is having a complete anomaly of a season.  The only issue with keeping him is that he is out of options after this year. As of next spring, he will need to either be on the Twins or be put through waivers to get him down to AAA again (which will never happen, because a team will claim him in a heartbeat)."

minnesotatwins,3cf99p,NuancedThinker,8,Tue Jul 7 17:32:20 2015 UTC,Yes and give up all of the infield singles to the left side of the infield. Hasn't anyone noticed that one of the biggest differences in this year's team is that the defense doesn't totally suck? The effect it's had on pitching has turned pelfrey into a serviceable starter.
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,CARiedmann,2,Tue Jul 7 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"But how much worse would it be?  I'd presume that Plouffe would be almost as good in the field at SS as Santana or Nunez (which is to say, not very), and we want Sano at third eventually anyway.  If you want a good-fielding shortstop, you have to sign Nick Punto."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,NuancedThinker,5,Tue Jul 7 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"Plouffe doesn't have nearly enough range to play SS. Santana isn't good, but much of his struggles have to do with his arm. Santana's range might be below average for a SS, but it is way better than Plouffe's would be. Combine that with Sano not having good range at 3B, and like /u/CARiedmann said, there would be a lot of hits to the left side of the infield. It would absolutely be worse than it currently is."

minnesotatwins,3cf99p,NuancedThinker,2,Tue Jul 7 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"Something with UZR? It's calculated differently for each position, so don't waste your time."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:47:49 2015 UTC,I think you could figure out the average drop-off in UZR for players who have played both positions and assume Plouffe might do something similar.  He is a much better fielder today than when he first came up.
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,NuancedThinker,2,Tue Jul 7 23:20:33 2015 UTC,"If you want to do that, go ahead, but I'm standing by what I said: Plouffe would be much worse at SS than Santana.   I think Plouffe has improved defensively, but only specifically as a third baseman. He has learned how to pick hot liners and field slow rollers barehanded. Shortstop requires a different skill set, and Plouffe would be a mess there. He doesn't have the foot speed to get to grounders in the hole or up the middle. He is also already 29 years old, which is not the time to be making a change to a more difficult position."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,tennisspears,2,Tue Jul 7 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"He did originally come up as a SS though.  Would be kind of exciting to have an infield with the potential to hit 100 HR, even with Joe Mauer at first base."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,southsideson,2,Wed Jul 8 03:59:47 2015 UTC,"For those of you calling for Arcia to be traded, what do you see the OF looking like next year? Buxton/Rosario/Hicks plus Kepler? Walker? Re-sign Hunter?  Hunter's production is only going decline, even if slower than expected. And he's going to cost way more than Arcia will. Kepler and Walker are still very much unproven. I'd like to start next season with Arcia in RF, and if either of those guys force the issue you make a decision the middle of next year."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,Aluminum_Love_Cradle,3,Tue Jul 7 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"I would put money on Hunter resigning for next year (even though I wouldn't prefer it). He is still producing for now, and his leadership is a positive thing, but I would only really want him back if he was going to be a permanent DH. Of course, that forces them to find somewhere in the field to play Sano every day. I don't know how it will work out, but Hunter will almost surely be back next year. And sadly that might force one of Arcia or Plouffe out of town."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:41:10 2015 UTC,"If you have Hunter back, why not play him in right?  He has been better than expected there--certainly passable."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,NuancedThinker,2,Tue Jul 7 19:45:07 2015 UTC,"Assuming he plays the same there next year as he is this year, which is hardly a given, that's fine I guess, but that forces Arcia out of town. And it blocks Kepler and maybe Walker from playing time next year."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"At some point, they have to figure out which outfielders are genuinely good.  If Hunter is obviously better than Kepler, Walker, Arcia, and Hicks, then of course you want Hunter back and leave these guys in the minors till one of them gets a .400 OBA in AAA for three months.  Your team reaches a point where ""barely a major-league talent"" isn't good enough."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,NuancedThinker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"Arcia and Hicks will be out of options next year, so you can't just leave them in the minors. The other two were probably going to start next year in the minors anyway."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,tennisspears,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:00:07 2015 UTC,"Good point. I don't suppose they'd clear waivers, either.  Well, I suppose end of this year is when they would either fish or cut bait on Hicks.  Arcia is a bit harder question.  I guess it is simple: either make room for Arcia at DH, or make him play LF/RF.  If he isn't a good enough hitter to be a DH and he isn't a good enough fielder to play in the OF, then you get rid of him."

minnesotatwins,3cf99p,taffyowner,8,Tue Jul 7 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"trade him for whatever   If you're just trading him for whatever, then why do we care about his development? Why not just keep him around for a power bench bat (read: late inning PH for Suzuki or Hicks) if the only return on a trade is going to be ""whatever""?"
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"Whatever wasn't meant to be trade him for a bucket of balls, they need to trade him for whatever they need, he's the perfect piece to move with a Pelfrey for maybe a RP for the stretch"
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,taffyowner,0,Tue Jul 7 17:42:09 2015 UTC,They need to trade him and someone else for a catcher. Having a player who is worse defensively in the outfield but marginally better offensively is not as big a benefit as not having Suzuki in the lineup.

minnesotatwins,3cf99p,InfiniteDeWitt,0,Tue Jul 7 20:03:27 2015 UTC,Pelfrey/Arcia package trade.
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,kaiserj1982,0,Tue Jul 7 14:35:53 2015 UTC,You could potentially get a pretty good RP or other player for a deal like that
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,taffyowner,5,Tue Jul 7 14:37:35 2015 UTC,"No. You won't get much value out of that. Pelfrey's contract is up at the end of the year and he's had unsustainable success (look at his last two starts for his results when he's not getting lucky.) Arcia, while having more value, still isn't a dynamic piece on the trade market, and would be a secondary piece of any trade package the twins would have to put together for premium talent."
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,CARiedmann,4,Tue Jul 7 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"I think Arcia is worth more to the Twins as a player than as a tradebait right now. We shouldn't trade a guy who's actually hit 20 big league homers for bullpen help. Let him rot in AAA and next year he takes Hunter's spot.  Unless Torii decides to come back, in which case this becomes more of a challenge. Maybe then Arcia will have gotten his trade value back up after a great 2nd half in AAA."

minnesotatwins,3cf99p,taffyowner,0,Tue Jul 7 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"All of whom Arcia has been out-hitting at a fairly good margin. Obviously they all have the defensive edge, but its not cut-and-dry."

minnesotatwins,3cf99p,skymind,2,Wed Jul 8 13:00:32 2015 UTC,Eddie Rosario OPS .691. Oswaldo Arcia OPS .718 or career .741. Arcia is a better career hitter than Trevor Plouffe and even Brian Dozier so far. Remember how bad they looked in their early years? Arcia very well could end up being Delmon Young 2.0 but that's not a terrible floor.
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,taffyowner,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:35:35 2015 UTC,oh trust me. I believe in arcia's high (as i see it) potential. I just don't see how you can say he has outhit Eddie when he had SO MANY bad at bats. Right now AAA is without a doubt the place for him
minnesotatwins,3cf99p,southsideson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:22:23 2015 UTC,I was hoping for a serviceable bullpen guy which I'm sure a Pelfrey and Arcia could get
minnesotatwins,3chksj,judyidontknowyou,5,Tue Jul 7 23:34:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree for the same reason as /u/kripzo.  He'd clog up the bases, even if he is a ""smart"" base runner."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,PopeSleepy,4,Tue Jul 7 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"Speed only seems relevant if he's trying to steal bases, and with the guys behind him being power hitters (especially with Dozier's high TB number), he's not going to need to.   Besides imagine the scenario where Leadoff hits a single, then the guy batting 2nd (or 3rd) hits a double. How much more often is Dozier really going to score on that double then Mauer?"
minnesotatwins,3chksj,PopeSleepy,3,Tue Jul 7 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"Quite a bit, I imagine.  It's more than that, though -- It's going first to third on a well-struck ball to right, getting inside the pitchers head and making him anticipate a steal."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,Dannydimes,3,Wed Jul 8 00:01:34 2015 UTC,"I'm really confused by ""As his power declined"", besides the last year in the dome his power numbers have always been poor. The fact that he has five homeruns before the All-Star break is a miracle."

What it came up with:  Mauer Sano Hicks Dozier Plouffe Escobar Rosario Santana Suzuki  I used Sano's Minor League numbers for this year instead of his Major League ones - it seems unlikely that he will continue getting on base at 0.500
minnesotatwins,3chksj,agrueeatedu,3,Wed Jul 8 00:14:02 2015 UTC,It's not a valid point to your argument when it has Aaron Hicks batting 3rd.
minnesotatwins,3chksj,Ryan8bit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:55:51 2015 UTC,I would swap him and Plouffe. But otherwise that looks pretty accurate to how I'd do it.
minnesotatwins,3chksj,incredibleridiculous,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:21:49 2015 UTC,"That calculator only factors in OPS, and that's it?  That's not very complex.  With even the most complex numbers, sometimes there are intangibles like Dozier just hitting better in the lead-off spot."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,Kripzo,2,Wed Jul 8 15:02:38 2015 UTC,Hicks or Buxton  Mauer  Dozier Sano Hunter Plouffe Rosario Suzuki  Shortstop
minnesotatwins,3chksj,tcarr31,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:05:25 2015 UTC,"He is also one of the slowest players, though. It would make more sense to have Rosario, Nunez, or even Hicks lead off so that players like Dozier, Hunter, and Mauer could advance them. The biggest change in the lineup needs to be Sano moving up and Plouffe moving down. We need someone less apt to hitting into double plays following our guys who are good at getting on base."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,tennisspears,2,Tue Jul 7 23:39:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know if speed really matters that much; stolen bases should be a thing of the past at this point in baseball. Rosario and Hicks both have OBP under 0.300, I can't imagine either of them batting lead off. I'd be okay with trying Nunez out there to see what he can do, but I'm sick of seeing the best slugger on the team batting first."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,Kripzo,2,Tue Jul 7 23:44:09 2015 UTC,"The spot will I think pretty clearly be Buxtons once his thumb heals. It may seem like its become a thing of the past to steal bases, but once he gets down reading big league pitchers first moves to the plate - he will be one of the best base stealers in the league."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,tennisspears,2,Tue Jul 7 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"If Buxton can prove he can get on base, I'd be thrilled with someone of his speed batting leadoff. I just think the ability to get on base is much more important than speed for the spot."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,Kripzo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:59:53 2015 UTC,"GIDP is a horrible stat to judge a guy by, because it is very much situational. Amazingly, Plouffe has the second lowest ground ball rate on the Twins right now (Source). So can we put to rest the notion that Plouffe is more apt to hit into them? If anyone else was batting in his spot, they would hit into even more, statistically."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,PM_Me_-Anything,-2,Wed Jul 8 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"As long as he leads the team in GIDP, it is a fair notion."
minnesotatwins,3chksj,CantaloupeCamper,2,Wed Jul 8 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"I just showed you statistics showing that he hits the ball on the ground less often than anyone other than Brian Dozier. It isn't fair at all that he is looked at as a worse player just because he bats most often with a runner on first and less than 2 outs. Do you also think the White Sox should move Jose Abreu back in the lineup? Because he is tied with Plouffe in GIDP this year. Miguel Cabrera has almost just as many too. If Sano has a higher GB% than Plouffe, and the Twins swap them out in the lineup, Sano will be the one hitting into more double plays. That's just how it works."

minnesotatwins,3ce1qo,Aluminum_Love_Cradle,3,Tue Jul 7 04:37:58 2015 UTC,"He definitely warrants a look in the rotation, but when will he get it and in whose spot? Injuries are bound to happen so he will get his chance eventually if not late this year or next year. He very well may get a look before Berrios simply due to his age and being more advanced career wise. He might still be destined for a bullpen role, but its best to see what he can bring as a starter as that will maximize his value."
minnesotatwins,3ce1qo,Cornholio4,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:03:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know, there aren't any easy answers in the rotation right now. Nolasco is probably out for the rest of the year. His performance with his recent injuries pretty much make him untradeable. And despite what internet commenters say, you can't just cut a guy you owe $25M. Maybe this time next year he's rebuilt his value enough that they don't have to eat his entire contract.   Obviously they wouldn't want to trade Santana in the first year of his new contract. Hughes was probably very tradeable before his extension, but now he's owed almost $50M over the next 4 years.  Gibson and May are both cheap and young and performing well. It's hard to imaging dumping them unless the return was really good.  Milone being the only lefty is probably worth more to the team than anyone else is willing to give, but maybe if he keeps up his current streak they can find a buyer.   So you're left with Pelfrey. Unless a bunch of other dominoes start to fall fast, he's going to be a waiver wire deal to a team coasting into the playoffs looking for a guy to eat some innings and is a slight upgrade to their #4 or 5 starter. And dealing him only means you've made room for May back in the rotation.  I guess I'd hope to trade Pelfrey + Milone or Gibson and hope to get Duffey some starts by mid-August? Hard to be selling when you're in the playoff hunt."
minnesotatwins,3cbltm,rocketmanjp,10,Mon Jul 6 17:20:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. He's like top 5 worst pitchers in inherited runners allowed to score, and his ERA is above 5. This guy lets someone touch home-plate every time he pitches. Easily our worst player, and one of the worst players in major league baseball right now."
minnesotatwins,3cbltm,LoveCommittinSins,6,Mon Jul 6 21:26:01 2015 UTC,"He just needs to be used properly. With the pen in the shape that it is, he has been forced to pitch a whole inning against both lefties and righties. He should be brought in only to face a lefty or a string of lefties. (Lefties are only hitting .189 off of him this year)."
minnesotatwins,3cbltm,Cornholio4,4,Mon Jul 6 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a good point, just sour after that loss yesterday after 8 great innings pitched by Santana."
minnesotatwins,3cbltm,catfish_juan,2,Mon Jul 6 17:40:08 2015 UTC,He seems to be Molitor's preferred choice for lefty-lefty matchups. Could Duensing fill that role instead? I think it's possible.
minnesotatwins,3cbltm,pshark00,3,Mon Jul 6 17:34:13 2015 UTC,Duensing hasn't pitched well at all this year.

The trouble is that Thompson and Duensing are the only lefty options (excluding Perkins), so resources are limited if the strategy to matchup against lefty hitters continues."

minnesotatwins,3cbltm,NuancedThinker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:59:36 2015 UTC,Right now he cleary isn't ready or they wouldn't of sent him down so quickly. No I'm not writing him off at all but it doesn't matter how hard he can throw if he can't learn to control it. So yeah if he doesn't learn control he might not ever be a major league pitcher that's just a fact. His raw potential is terrific and hopefully he can continue to develop better command. It would be silly to write any of these guys off this early. Same with Buxton he can't hit a curveball yet but his potential is gigantic. Alex Meyer is the biggest arm we have had in the system in a long time hopefully he can come up and dominate at some point.

How many more years do you ""protect him"" for?  Once a prospect does well at AA or AAA for a long time, they're ready--unless there is something specific they ""need to work on"".  Too often, that excuse never pans out--they ""work on"" nothing different in the minors, and they are the same pitcher when they come back.    Do you think Meyer, command problems and all, is currently worse than Thompson, Boyer, or Duensing?  If not, why not let him work on his control in the majors?"
minnesotatwins,3cb2bo,GLineSportsWORDPRESS,34,Mon Jul 6 14:51:03 2015 UTC,It's only right that he was welcomed to the Twins by throwing 8 stellar innings only to have the pen blow it for him.
minnesotatwins,3cb2bo,PhatGiraffe42,14,Mon Jul 6 15:24:16 2015 UTC,"He pitched very well. I was surprised that Molitor didn't let him pitch the 9th given the current state of the pen, but its understandable with it being his first start. It is only one start though. He still has a long way to go to earn that $55 million."
minnesotatwins,3cb2bo,Cornholio4,4,Mon Jul 6 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"He did have 3 rehab starts before coming up here, so I had no problem letting him at least hit 100 pitches before being pulled."

I'm hoping he'll be consistent and boost us for a long time. It's possible based on his past performance but how much of that was influenced by drugs?

minnesotatwins,3cd3hr,JiuJitsuJustin,2,Wed Jul 8 07:01:09 2015 UTC,You can argue It's the best of the 4 sports and that is probably true but all of the all star games are boring and gimmicky. To make a boring gimmick determine home field advantage was ridiculous. The only part of any all star game wknd worth watching is the NHL skills comp and even that is a stretch. The Pro Bowl is the worst for sure. You can pick any game between two random teams in their respective sport and it will be more entertaining than an All Star game.

minnesotatwins,3c9cgo,audiocranium,9,Mon Jul 6 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"All the pieces are definitely there. The one thing that has me slightly worried right now is, how will the front office deal with large contract players who can't perform at the level that some of the young home grown players can? Right now the Trevor May situation comes to mind. Whatever the reason for keeping Pelfrey over May is irrelevant right now, but what happens down the road when Ricky Nolasco comes back? We have too many average starters on rich contracts. Will management be willing to let some of these guys go whether it be via a release, trade, or DFA? Or will they continue to prevent young guys from contributing and getting the experience they need at the big league level?"
minnesotatwins,3c9cgo,Cornholio4,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"This will always be an issue for small market teams like the Twins. I think we all have a collective bad taste in our mouths regarding our front office's mishandling of Johan Santana, Torii Hunter, Carlos Gomez, and many more cases (in my opinion).   We will obviously be in a tough position if guys like Sano and Buxton are the real deal. They could be up there in Trout/Harper arbitration numbers and we're going to need to shell out money to keep them around - much like we did to keep Joe Mauer.   One thing I find comforting is the fact that we actually brassed the balls and signed Joe to a huge contract. By the time his 8 yr/184 mil deal is up heading into the 2019 season, a big chunk of money will be off the books; including the money from the Santana and Nolasco deals. I'm assuming the next big set of contracts will happen right then - locking down the new key contributors to multi-year big deals of their own.  Edit: clarification 'n spelin."

minnesotatwins,3c9cgo,Cornholio4,5,Mon Jul 6 12:34:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go quite that far...yet. This off-season will be really telling for Terry Ryan. What he does to shore up the bullpen is the biggest thing. We need proven relievers that can come in and hold a lead. His attempt at shoring up the bullpen last offseason was to bring in 3 reclamation projects (Boyer, Thompson, Stauffer). Granted, Boyer and Thompson did have quite a bit of success to start the season, but they quickly came down to earth. Without true aces we can trust to get us 8 quality innings, we need better relievers that can get us to Perkins."

I'm telling you, they should reach the ALCS sometime in the next 2-3 years."
minnesotatwins,3c9cgo,BrianDoziersHair,2,Mon Jul 6 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"Where we go from this season on pretty much hinges on the front office and their willingness to prod the Pohlads to open their wallet a little bit further for bullpen arms and maybe one ""Ace""  starting pitcher (Way way way too soon to make any sort of judgement on Ervin besides that he was dealing dirty yesterday) off FA, and to eat Nolasco's contract so they can move forward.   (I loved every bit of dominant Pelf the Elf, but, man. My heart has been broken by him way too much.)  Edit like 2 seconds after posting: Holy run-on sentence, Batman."
minnesotatwins,3c9cgo,Cornholio4,3,Mon Jul 6 08:33:38 2015 UTC,"Signing an ace from free agency is always a difficult task. Most are well into their 30's and will demand a ridiculous contract. They can provide great value for the first part of the contract, but by the end they are usually deadweight. Now of course if a team is a legitimate contender in the early years then yes the deal makes sense. But outside of that, free agency signings can really harm midsize payroll teams if the deal doesn't work out.   Personally, I don't think the Pohlad's are really restricting Terry Ryan from making the moves he needs. The true money issue is how do we get rid of the bad debts we have that mean nothing to the franchise (Pelfrey, Nolasco,Stauffer, and eventually Suzuki when a better option presents itself). Pelfrey is the perfect example right now. Even on his relatively small $5.5 million contract, he has already pushed one of our most promising young pitchers to the pen. This brings us right back to the ace issue. Developing top of the rotation arms in house is the most critical thing that midsize payroll clubs like the Twins can do. Now I am not saying Trevor May can develop into a true number one, but just look at how good Gibson has become in only his second full year. Absolutely nobody knows how good Trevor May can be now that his walk rate is lower than it has ever been, but he needs to be in that rotation gaining experience.  For reference, Trevor May is making $510k this season and Kyle Gibson only $537k. Neither will be free agents until 2021 and 2020 respectively. No free agent will ever give you the value that these homegrown arms can."

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,vagrantwade,4,Sun Jul 5 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"So, why did you guys bring that guy in for one batter and then replace him? I don't get it.   Lefty/Righty matchups. New to the baseballs?"
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Natrone011,5,Sun Jul 5 20:42:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Yost rarely pitches to matchups, and the dude you brought in isn't exactly great against righties, nor is Cain bad against right handed pitching."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,4,Sun Jul 5 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yost doesn't have to pitch to matchups because his relievers are actually good. The Twins have one lights out reliever, and then seven mediocre to awful relievers. Molitor has to try to squeeze every little bit of a possible advantage out of his guys."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Natrone011,3,Sun Jul 5 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm absolutely not trying to assert that Molitor was in the wrong there. Someone new to the game who is a Royals fan probably wouldn't get that, though.  Also, on that note, it's really too bad that the Twin and Royals are in the same division, because we have a huge surplus of solid bullpen arms that we could trade for, say, a second baseman."

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Natrone011,5,Sun Jul 5 21:06:05 2015 UTC,You guys already have an all-star 2B!   Just joshin ya. Good series.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Janitor_X,3,Sun Jul 5 21:00:42 2015 UTC,"Just joshin ya. Good series.   Dat Minnesota nice, tho."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,toxicroach,2,Sun Jul 5 21:04:32 2015 UTC,I don't fight it anymore
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,doubleflusher,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:13:40 2015 UTC,I thought they were saying that the guy who got pulled was doing really well against lefties.  Maybe I heard wrong.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,PikeMelfrey,2,Sun Jul 5 20:40:05 2015 UTC,I'm literally a fucking hex for this Damn team. I turned the game on just after Hicks homerun and we don't score another run and lose the game.  I haven't seen us win a game in like 2 weeks.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"The Universe is just upset that you were predicting a playoff run so soon. Give us a couple years to let the young talent roll in, and for our starting pitchers to actually be eligible for the postseason. ;)"

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,taffyowner,4,Sun Jul 5 23:03:51 2015 UTC,With the exception of Perkins this bullpen should be razed to the ground. They are directly responsible for both losses in this series.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:38:32 2015 UTC,Didn't they draft a ton of college relievers last year for this exact reason?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,y2jayjk,2,Sun Jul 5 22:06:07 2015 UTC,Who is gonna be on the block that we can pick up to stop our bullpen from sucking?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 5 20:37:30 2015 UTC,Clippard. Anyone on the As or Phillies. But I don't wanna give away prospects. Maybe just shuffle things around. I'd give Graham a chance in that spot perhaps?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,audiocranium,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:39:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have liked what I have seen from Graham this year. He hasn't pitched in high leverage situations, so I wouldn't move him to setup or anything, but he should be exempt from all of the bullpen criticism, in my opinion."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"Graham and Pressly both need to see more high-leverage situations - especially with Boyer, Thompson, Duensing and the gang tossing up fucking taters. Hoping Pressly is doing o.k. after yesterday - he's got a nasty hook."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,RichardManuel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"Well Pressly might not see any situations for a while if his injury from last night is serious.   Maybe May gets some of the 8th inning appearances while he is out there? I wouldn't mind that.  Edit: Oops, should have read your whole post, because you mentioned Pressly's injury."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:47:25 2015 UTC,Hicks? A starting pitcher? Plouffe?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,y2jayjk,2,Sun Jul 5 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"Two losses in the 9th inning or later, no Perkins used in either one of them. You still there, Gardy?"
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,RichardManuel,6,Sun Jul 5 20:37:28 2015 UTC,Molly essentially spit in Ervin's face. Why not let him go another?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ItsThisEasy,2,Sun Jul 5 20:37:20 2015 UTC,"Well the Royals broadcast team said he was going to go 5 innings, 6 at the most since he probably isn't up to full conditioning yet. But I agree, he could have gone 9."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Tripudelops,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:40:52 2015 UTC,"Lol he's had nothing to do but condition.. if he was injured then sure, but that wasn't the case. At 87 pitches he should have been in."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sun Jul 5 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, but wasn't he at 93 pitches when he was pulled? I still think they should've left him in another though"
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,carat135,3,Sun Jul 5 21:30:36 2015 UTC,Fuck our bullpen.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Janitor_X,3,Sun Jul 5 20:36:56 2015 UTC,Probably should have won all 4 of those with a semi-competent bullpen.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ItsThisEasy,2,Sun Jul 5 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Totally winnable games, bullpen just blew it."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,BeeboBaggins,3,Sun Jul 5 20:38:52 2015 UTC,Constant bullshit from Boyer and Thompson.... I'm done with this shit.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 5 20:36:50 2015 UTC,"Can anyone give spare relievers, please?"
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,audiocranium,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:36:44 2015 UTC,"Tonkin, Oliveros (not on 40-man, so would have to get rid of Duensing or another arm for him), Achter, and Atchison now available."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:39:26 2015 UTC,Achter plz.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,imissedthetoilet,2,Sun Jul 5 20:45:07 2015 UTC,This fucking bullpen
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jul 5 20:36:39 2015 UTC,They haven't been bad this year......we aren't going to win many games going bullpen to bullpen with KC though.  I'm more disappointed we couldn't score more than 2 runs and wasted a very strong start by Ervin.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,vagrantwade,2,Sun Jul 5 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"They haven't been bad all year...the past month though, they have been terrible.  Our offense needs to get more runs on the board to help them out, but it amazes me how our BP just can't seem to get out of an inning without giving up runs."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 5 20:44:12 2015 UTC,Aaron Thompson has been one of the worst relievers in the AL.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,doubleflusher,3,Sun Jul 5 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"Boo. Baltimore next, lost 5 of last 6 (although currently beating the White Sox), and offense has been a no-show lately, so here's hoping for a good home stand."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,FrankReynolds,2,Sun Jul 5 20:36:27 2015 UTC,Twins crush it at home this year.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,audiocranium,2,Sun Jul 5 20:37:26 2015 UTC,Can't leave a runner on second in every inning and expect to win.  Especially with this bullpen.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Janitor_X,2,Sun Jul 5 20:36:14 2015 UTC,I hate the fucking Royals.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,audiocranium,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:36:10 2015 UTC,Careful. You get downvoted for saying that here for some reason.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ewok_bukkake,8,Sun Jul 5 20:39:43 2015 UTC,I hate the fucking White Sox.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,spin8x,2,Sun Jul 5 20:35:49 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ. Thompson has to go.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ewok_bukkake,4,Sun Jul 5 20:35:41 2015 UTC,Well Santana sure as hell could have done that...
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,cadderly09,2,Sun Jul 5 20:35:38 2015 UTC,Ya I want to see what Molitor has to say about that decision
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,BeeboBaggins,5,Sun Jul 5 20:37:00 2015 UTC,Fuck you Boyer and Thompson.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,vagrantwade,2,Sun Jul 5 20:35:28 2015 UTC,Well that was fun...
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,doubleflusher,5,Sun Jul 5 20:35:23 2015 UTC,Aaron Thompson is a piece of shit. I literally feel like we forgeit games when he comes in.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,y2jayjk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:35:19 2015 UTC,Fuckin bullpen!
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jul 5 20:35:19 2015 UTC,That was so easy to see once they pulled Ervin.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,doubleflusher,2,Sun Jul 5 20:35:19 2015 UTC,Great....another fucking game blown by the bull pen.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,vagrantwade,6,Sun Jul 5 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"Nice walk Boyer...why don't you just give 'em the ""W"" while you're at it."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,AdaAstra,6,Sun Jul 5 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"If we want to lose, let's just throw Aaron Thompson in there.  EDIT Not watching live...did not actually know he was coming in."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,cadderly09,5,Sun Jul 5 20:31:38 2015 UTC,....not again....please not again...
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,imissedthetoilet,2,Sun Jul 5 20:30:40 2015 UTC,I cannot handle another royals walk off.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sun Jul 5 20:31:20 2015 UTC,Giving the speedy Lorenzo Cain a free pass to start the inning......not good.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ewok_bukkake,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:28:42 2015 UTC,I don't mind it......can't figure this game going on much longer. Have to do everything you can to get a run here against this strong KC bullpen.  Unfortunately our guys didn't do anything there.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,0,Sun Jul 5 20:27:06 2015 UTC,Granted Gordon just made a great play but these Royals' announcers LOVE to stroke the egos of their players
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,audiocranium,3,Sun Jul 5 20:24:31 2015 UTC,That's Hud for you.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ewok_bukkake,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"I'm just happy he didn't say ""he gone."""
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,RichardManuel,0,Mon Jul 6 02:15:39 2015 UTC,"This might be my first time hearing him announce a game but it's annoying. I'm pretty sure he just said ""game over"" at the end of that inning before mentioning they have a chance to walk off."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,audiocranium,3,Sun Jul 5 20:27:25 2015 UTC,Sano's start has been very encouraging.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,BrianDoziersHair,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:23:53 2015 UTC,Routine fly balls = 675 foot home runs. I like a dis.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,imissedthetoilet,4,Sun Jul 5 20:22:27 2015 UTC,Jesus tits and god America stop hitting it over there.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 5 20:23:35 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I don't like our chances the longer this game goes on.....KC has a great pen.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,audiocranium,2,Sun Jul 5 20:21:57 2015 UTC,The best two guys will be out of the way after this inning.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,novafire08,2,Sun Jul 5 20:23:55 2015 UTC,This bullpen is too damn good.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,AdaAstra,3,Sun Jul 5 20:21:53 2015 UTC,How about we have a slightly less heart attack-inducing 9th than Friday's game?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,RichardManuel,10,Sun Jul 5 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the outcome of this game, Santana has pitched a damn good game."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,smakola,5,Sun Jul 5 20:17:51 2015 UTC,Let's get a couple runs here for Johan 2.0
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,RichardManuel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:19:34 2015 UTC,Settle down.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,novafire08,2,Sun Jul 5 20:22:00 2015 UTC,Haha yeah I was being a bit cheeky as /u/novafire08 pointed out.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,BrianDoziersHair,11,Sun Jul 5 20:25:13 2015 UTC,His name literally was Johan Santana.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,StuntmanMichael123,2,Sun Jul 5 20:23:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Feels good to have a pitcher last at least 8 innings, besides Hughes vs King Felix."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 5 20:19:07 2015 UTC,Holy shit.  LaPantz got some sun this weekend.   God damn.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,5,Sun Jul 5 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"Stop hitting it towards Escobar, Torii."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,2,Sun Jul 5 20:10:52 2015 UTC,I mean those last two balls have just been scorched but Escobar just has his number today.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Fortehlulz33,3,Sun Jul 5 20:13:08 2015 UTC,Santana looking pretty strong out there.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,TOPGEAR1992,2,Sun Jul 5 20:03:28 2015 UTC,that slider is dirrty
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,4,Sun Jul 5 20:02:01 2015 UTC,Just realized Santana is only on 65 pitches.  Has there been a complete game for any of our starters yet this year?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 5 19:54:32 2015 UTC,"Hughes has an 8-inning complete game for sure. I think that's the only one. 8-inning complete games aren't much fun, though."

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 5 19:59:56 2015 UTC,Yep. Only two pitchers used by both teams.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,2,Sun Jul 5 19:54:57 2015 UTC,Gardy got a bunch of shit for suggesting that it was dumb the Yankees sing it every game because it extends the 7th inning stretch so much.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 5 20:08:20 2015 UTC,A homer would be nice.  Edit: or a lead-off walk
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Kruse,4,Sun Jul 5 19:42:43 2015 UTC,Hey its the guy that kept us in that game the other night!
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,audiocranium,3,Sun Jul 5 19:39:23 2015 UTC,Mauer up to .276 now. Was down to .253 on June 16th.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,AdaAstra,6,Sun Jul 5 19:31:00 2015 UTC,"Um, is that guy's face ok?"

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,3,Sun Jul 5 20:19:50 2015 UTC,No kidding.  That guy need to start drinking some water.  He is either burnt to a crisp already or overheating.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,3,Sun Jul 5 19:25:19 2015 UTC,The Royals' announcers are talking about how Santana's delivery is setting him up for TJ. Has anyone heard anything like that?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,BrianDoziersHair,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"He had a partial tear a few years ago, I think, but didn't have TJ. It has always been a bit of a concern."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 5 19:23:33 2015 UTC,Damn. Ball just keeps carrying today.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,2,Sun Jul 5 19:22:40 2015 UTC,Poop.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,3,Sun Jul 5 19:22:25 2015 UTC,Ervin's slider is dirty.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,2,Sun Jul 5 19:20:53 2015 UTC,That little breaking ball he throws to the inside of those lefties is gnarly.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun Jul 5 19:22:07 2015 UTC,"That's the slider, throws it 46% to LHH with two strikes."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 5 19:24:59 2015 UTC,Damn that has a good amount of vertical break for a slider.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:26:34 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks Hicks sorta looks like Paul Teutul JR?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun Jul 5 19:18:42 2015 UTC,I totally see it...  ...Who the fuck is Paul Teutul JR?  Edit: Dafuq? No he's definitely not a husky white man are you high? Also how the fuck did they decide that is how to spell their last name.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ItsThisEasy,5,Sun Jul 5 19:19:37 2015 UTC,Dick Bremer loves to rip the Astros for letting go of JD Martinez.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tenthreeleader,2,Sun Jul 5 19:16:46 2015 UTC,So damn close.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ItsThisEasy,5,Sun Jul 5 19:15:18 2015 UTC,This rule of no post season after a positive drug test is tripping me out. I get it and don't get it at the same time.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,cadderly09,5,Sun Jul 5 19:13:09 2015 UTC,I think he did his 80 game suspension and shouldn't have to deal with it further..
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun Jul 5 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"It's a double punishment.  That said, if players are suspended for banned substances after this point they would miss the playoffs too, so I suppose MLB considers it fair to punish certain players twice."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,cadderly09,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:25:55 2015 UTC,"I know what they say, just absolutely shit. Especially after watching him pitch today.."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Tannekr,3,Sun Jul 5 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"Wait what? So if we make the playoffs, Santana can't pitch?"
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ewok_bukkake,5,Sun Jul 5 19:14:07 2015 UTC,That is correct.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,BrianDoziersHair,2,Sun Jul 5 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL. That really sucks."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,5,Sun Jul 5 19:15:20 2015 UTC,"With every strike/out, Santana earns a little forgiveness."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,4,Sun Jul 5 19:13:05 2015 UTC,I don't understand why we continue to try and steal.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,5,Sun Jul 5 19:07:44 2015 UTC,Duffy has a really good pickoff move too.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,RichardManuel,10,Sun Jul 5 19:08:16 2015 UTC,So is /u/cadderly09 known for acting like a child in opposing GDT or is that only with the Royals?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ewok_bukkake,9,Sun Jul 5 19:04:07 2015 UTC,God I hate when guys do that. Makes us all look bad.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun Jul 5 19:13:04 2015 UTC,Dude that's loose butthole.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun Jul 5 19:06:14 2015 UTC,"While I feel bad for the player, I'm happy that it appears Justin Verlander is no longer the same pitcher"
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,vultrun,5,Sun Jul 5 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, he has Kate. I don't feel bad."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ewok_bukkake,3,Sun Jul 5 19:00:54 2015 UTC,He goes home to Kate Upton so I don't feel bad for him.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jul 5 19:04:19 2015 UTC,Yeah it'll be really weird if the Tigers sink into mediocrity with the loss of Miggy and Verlander shitting the bed.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,vultrun,2,Sun Jul 5 18:56:32 2015 UTC,Drew 4 for 10 with a double and HR vs. his old team now.

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,2,Sun Jul 5 18:58:34 2015 UTC,Only 20 pitches in the 3rd?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jul 5 18:54:22 2015 UTC,What is that like 10 seconds between pitches?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,novafire08,2,Sun Jul 5 18:52:49 2015 UTC,THERE GOES THE PERFECT GAME
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun Jul 5 18:52:40 2015 UTC,Them Torii DPs like its 03

minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun Jul 5 18:49:37 2015 UTC,Did I do that?  Cue laugh track.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,FlannelBeard,3,Sun Jul 5 18:49:17 2015 UTC,Hicks making a diving catch and getting a HR.  Not even the end of the 3rd.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun Jul 5 18:51:23 2015 UTC,Can Dozier make it back-to-back?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,FlannelBeard,2,Sun Jul 5 18:48:04 2015 UTC,Nice!
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,10,Sun Jul 5 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie, I'm really, really happy to see Hicks do well."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Cornholio4,3,Sun Jul 5 18:44:02 2015 UTC,I hope this doesn't create a logjam in the outfield.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Tannekr,6,Sun Jul 5 18:44:02 2015 UTC,Torii could spend some time at DH. Rosario-Buxton-Hicks is a pretty good outfield.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:44:50 2015 UTC,What about Sano then? Or what if Vargas gets hot in the minors again?
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,schrica,4,Sun Jul 5 18:48:43 2015 UTC,"I mean Torii isnt so good that he would command the DH spot. Hes struggled quite a bit lately. Besides, if Hicks is healthy, Buxton is going back down. Sano looks like hes ready to stay, so Vargas will probably not get a shot up here unless Mauer goes down with injury, and Sano absolutely sucks at first, which I doubt he will."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:50:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I suppose you're right with Buxton being sent down but it's just a bummer since he is so fun to watch. Sano does look like he's staying but I wouldn't be opposed to seeing him the field once a week just so he doesn't get rusty. I don't like the idea of having a guy that young be cemented as a DH.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,schrica,2,Sun Jul 5 18:52:59 2015 UTC,He should play the field at some point. Mauer usually DH's once a week or so. Plouffe will slide over to 1B and Sano can play 3B.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:59:32 2015 UTC,"(Un)Luckily, Torii is done after this year."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,Tannekr,4,Sun Jul 5 19:04:44 2015 UTC,Is he though? Would you be at all surprised to see a player like Torii come back after having a good season? I could even see the Twins giving him another 1 year deal.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,cadderly09,2,Sun Jul 5 18:47:59 2015 UTC,"I think he will keep playing, but I don't foresee the Twins giving him another deal.  There is no room for him...and he is expensive."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"I can actually see the Twins giving him another year. It will all come down to the money though, after seeing him play well this season I'd almost give him $8 mil."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ScientiaEstPotentia,2,Sun Jul 5 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right, but then again we are talking about the Pohlads and Mr. Terry Ryan.  Even 8 million is a pretty big chunk."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:56:19 2015 UTC,I would have thought 10m was impossible for an older veteran player. Shocked when I saw the Mauer deal.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,NorseWolves,3,Sun Jul 5 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"It is a very good point, and it wouldn't surprise me if he wanted another season. I'm betting it won't happen, though."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ewok_bukkake,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:01:30 2015 UTC,I'd perfectly ok with him being back. He's not playing bad at all.
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,BrianDoziersHair,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:51:43 2015 UTC,Hear Hear!
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,8,Sun Jul 5 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, Hicks. Crushed that one."
minnesotatwins,3c7qml,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:51:37 2015 UTC,That one came close to where I was sitting. You can see me on the broadcast as the only navy blue guy in the entire section cheering
minnesotatwins,3c5uxa,TwinsGameday,14,Sun Jul 5 02:46:40 2015 UTC,It's a happy 4th of July!!!!!! Fantastic bounceback win in a crucial series against arguably the best team in the AL. Can't do worse than a split.  Pretty damn pleased. Great job by the bullpen - 5 scoreless innings.

minnesotatwins,3c5uxa,kaiserj1982,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:54:22 2015 UTC,Was Perkins unavailable last night? (Friday) I don't understand why with the crowd energy (I was there in the front row just beyond third base in my Dozier jersey) why they didn't go to him for the last out of the 8th and go for the 4 out save...
minnesotatwins,3c5uxa,rydethesnow,-1,Sun Jul 5 05:52:45 2015 UTC,Because they weren't in a position where Perkins would have gotten a save- the game was tied 2-2.
minnesotatwins,3c5uxa,Kripzo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:41:04 2015 UTC,"I was at the game, there were 2 outs BEFORE Morales singled in Cain to tie the game, so bring in Perkins to face Morales, and it's a possibility of a 4 out save."

minnesotatwins,3c5dc1,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:36:23 2015 UTC,The bad news - we can see the law of averages working against Pelfrey.  The good news - Ervin Santana will be back tomorrow and looked good in AAA.  Couldn't be more pleased with the progress of May and Gibson. Hughes looks like he might be hitting his stride just like he did last year in the 2nd half.  So still feeling pretty good...
minnesotatwins,3c5dc1,imissedthetoilet,0,Sun Jul 5 02:34:08 2015 UTC,Mauer has quietly been really good over the past few weeks.

minnesotatwins,3c5dc1,y2jayjk,2,Sat Jul 4 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"I was pretty disappointed in his responses to some of the interview questions he received today. In the very least, he should apologize and show some regret about not only taking the peds, but also hurting the team by not being available for the first half of the season and any post season play. What he did is not unforgivable by any means, but you need to accept it and move on."

minnesotatwins,3c64l7,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,4,Sun Jul 5 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"It's May, and he's going to the pen."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,Zeeker12,2,Sun Jul 5 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"They already announced May is going to the pen for now. Molitor said it is most likely temporary, which probably means Milone and Pelfrey should be on notice. May will replace whoever gets traded or pitches bad enough to lose their spot.  I don't really like moving May to the pen right now, but if it's just short-term, maybe it could be a good thing because it might help him make it through the end of the season without getting burned out.   Also, people keep saying the Twins should send guys like Duensing and Nolasco down to the minors. You need to read up on option rules. These guys are veterans who are out of options and can't be sent down except for on rehab assignments. And manipulating rehab assignments (like faking an injury report to send someone on one) isn't a good idea, because the players union won't hesitate to file a grievance for that sorry of thing."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 5 05:36:25 2015 UTC,"It'd be a huge mistake to send Milone anywhere though, even if he has a couple bad games. I'd rather keep May there for a bit than toss him--he's been dominant since he came back up. His ERA since returning is 1.95."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,McRawffles,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:23:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, hadn't heard anything was announced.  I agree with /u/McRawffles that May should stay.  He's been pitching really well lately, and he's got more of a future with the Twins than Pelfrey.  May needs MLB starts to see exactly what that future is.  I figured Duensing was probably out of options but I'd still send him down via the waver wire.  If he gets claimed, so be it. He's 32, under-performing, and relief pitchers are a dime a dozen.  If not, he can try to right the ship in Rochester.  That's the business side of baseball."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,tennisspears,2,Sun Jul 5 07:57:18 2015 UTC,"Alright, I agree with you about just DFAing Duensing and if he clears waivers, just sending him down or releasing him.   Just felt like I needed to get it off my chest because I have seen a lot of people on this sub suggesting Nolasco be sent to AAA as well, and he isn't really a DFA candidate because of his big contract. Sorry if it seemed like I was calling you specifically out."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,RobertService,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:26:43 2015 UTC,No worries.  =)
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,tennisspears,0,Sun Jul 5 15:45:13 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with releasing Nolasco and if his big contract is a problem then fire the guy who signed him to the big contract.

minnesotatwins,3c64l7,audiocranium,2,Sun Jul 5 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, in Duensing's case, I have no problem with just DFAing him. Been saying that for a while now. Thompson could also be optioned because he has really fallen apart lately (last night's good outing aside)."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,kvothe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:23:06 2015 UTC,Agreed. We've got a lot of bullpen arms to look at right now in the minors. No need to keep shelling out a couple million to Duensing when he's not really effective when we can take the same chance at another look at Thielbar for the league minimum.
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,audiocranium,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"If you read the rest of the Molitor quote, he mentions sending May back down to the AAA rotation as why this might be a temporary move.   What a terrible idea."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,ClemDeLaClem,2,Mon Jul 6 00:53:55 2015 UTC,"So hear me out: I say keeping Milone and Pelfrey in the rotation at least through July makes sense. If they both can keep their ERA in check in the 3's, we might have two pretty good trade chips that could be used on a bullpen or bench upgrade or even better - a few prospects.  I say market 'em, trade 'em and get May and Berrios in the rotation down the stretch."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:49:51 2015 UTC,It's May but short-term. Hopefully this means a Pelfrey trade is coming. We somehow have too much SP depth right now. Even if there's an injury we have Nolasco coming back and Berrios got elevated to AAA and could step in if necessary.
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,tennisspears,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:03:52 2015 UTC,"You can never have too much SP and I don't think Pelfrey would pull in much of a haul - his ERA is now at 3.94 and performance has been slipping as of late. Given his history of injuries and only half a season left on his contract - the Twins would likely get a low-level prospect. I'd rather just stick with Pelfrey the rest of the year - good or bad, I'd rather take my chances with him. He's part of the reason why the Twins are where they are right now."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'm still convinced that Pelfrey could be a decent bullpen option if he can ramp it up for one inning at a time. He was hitting 95-96 as a starter, so I'm sure he could get up to 97 if he wasn't worried about his stamina. I wish that would have been the move right now instead of May going to the pen. And I agree that Pelfrey doesn't have much trade value. People are saying they missed their opportunity to trade him when he was hot, but he wasn't worth much then either."
minnesotatwins,3c64l7,kaiserj1982,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"I assume the move was made in part out of respect for Pelfrey since he is the veteran - and it would be nice to get all we can get out of Pelfrey's 2-year, $10 mill deal......but it doesn't have to be a long-term solution. And agreed about trade value."

Gets back to third to find runner from second tagged. Suzuki chases him to third but missed the tag. Runner goes for home but Mauer covers. Is that in the ballpark (heh)?

minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:25:28 2015 UTC,"That wasn't a straight steal. They trust Mauer to make contact or take a walk in that situation (3-2 with 1 out). Just got a tough pitch to hit (high fastball) so it didn't work out.  But they have been bad at stealing, as /u/ChiefakaJames pointed out."
minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,NorseWolves,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:30:39 2015 UTC,37 stolen bases (tied for 18th in MLB) for 62. 59% success is 5th worst in MLB. Been picked off 9 times which is 4th most in MLB.
minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,FlannelBeard,0,Fri Jul 3 02:30:27 2015 UTC,Joe Mauer strikes out and a runner is thrown out.  Season long deja vu.

minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,vagrantwade,2,Fri Jul 3 02:09:22 2015 UTC,"Can you imagine how good the Twins would be if they had this year's pitching (and luck, of course) along with last year's performances from Suzuki, Escobar, Santana, and Vargas?

minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,ChiefakaJames,0,Fri Jul 3 01:56:23 2015 UTC,City was amazing.
minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,CentralAmerican,2,Fri Jul 3 02:03:55 2015 UTC,Hey everyone. How is Sano looking at the plate? I can't watch right now (at work). I saw he has struck out twice. Does he seem lost? Anxious? Or is he swinging for the fences...?
minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,swashbucklerjak,5,Fri Jul 3 01:53:00 2015 UTC,Hit a hard line drive to center and the two times he stuck out were on high strike sliders on 3-2 counts.   Looked as good as you can with the results. And the pitching he is facing.

minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,swashbucklerjak,3,Fri Jul 3 03:55:38 2015 UTC,He's seeing plenty of pitches. At least that's a good sign.
minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,CentralAmerican,3,Fri Jul 3 01:55:56 2015 UTC,He's not swinging terrible and is definitely putting up some good fights.

minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,smakola,2,Fri Jul 3 01:52:47 2015 UTC,Gah. At least he is striking out on actual strikes (or at least close to being strikes). Not swinging at any junk pitches so far tonight.
minnesotatwins,3bxlt9,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:52:24 2015 UTC,Sano strikes out swinging on another high slider from a different pitcher.

So the Twins obviously see something they like. The $4 million signing bonus given to Javier eclipses the $3.1 million deal they gave Miguel Sano back in 2009, and is now the most money the Twins have ever given a player during the International Signing Period. He's got a lot of tools and a lot of potential. Wander will definitely be a player to keep track of for the foreseeable future."

minnesotatwins,3bvczi,HolyLiaison,3,Thu Jul 2 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"There's a little snippet about him in this ESPN article.  For those of you without insider:   Javier is the best bet in the class to remain at shortstop; he has the essential range, actions and arm strength for the position. His swing is a mess, likely a product of bad habits brought on by a desire to hit for more power in showcases than his frame would allow without mechanical overcompensation. It has gotten better as Javier's body has developed -- something that happens rapidly for many 16-year-olds -- and is trending in the direction of viability.  There's obviously plenty of time for the team that signs Javier -- rumored to be the Minnesota Twins -- to make those adjustments and get Javier hitting for contact now while his power can naturally develop as his body matures. He's a future 50 hitter (on the 20-to-80 scouting scale) with fringe-average pull power and above-average defense at shortstop."
minnesotatwins,3bvczi,Kripzo,3,Fri Jul 3 09:14:55 2015 UTC,"Our Dominican scouting has always been on point. We brought in Ortiz (never mind)  back in the day, got Sano, and now this guy. He must have a big upside if he is commanding that much of a signing bonus."

I believe the top pitcher was Juan Rincon at 6.2. It was a really quick scan, so I might have missed someone.  Edit: I think I screwed something up. Rechecking. Looks like the highest was actually Danny Santana with 2.4, followed by Josmil Pinto at 0.9, Luis Rodriguez at 0.8, and then Luis Rivas at 0.6. Not a real good crop."

He was OPSing over .950 in the 12 or so games before he was inexplicably sent down the first time. Comes up, slumps, starts to hit then interleague starts and they send him down the first game we have a DH?  I'm as excited as the next guy about Sano, but I kind of doubt his bat will be any better than Vargas' in his first few major league games. Vargas also has nothing left to prove in the minors- he has mashed at every level and needs consistent playing time with the Twins."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,hail_termite_queen,4,Wed Jul 1 22:28:53 2015 UTC,Yeah why is Vargas getting shit on so much?  He seemed to be coming around.

Pretty mediocre.   I think the Milone decision was driven by necessity. Who else would they have moved? May and Gibson are the future, and both are having solid years. We cant send Hughes or Nolasco down.  Same with Pelfrey.  What's the better decision?  I think they should convert him to a reliever, personally. He could be a huge upgrade there."

minnesotatwins,3bsuha,tennisspears,-1,Thu Jul 2 17:26:33 2015 UTC,Vargas is really struggling. His slash right now is .245/.277/.365 over almost 50 games. That's bad sauce.   One of the lowest OPS on the squad.  He's struck out in almost a full third of his plate appearances.   Needs to get it together.
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's not the full story. He was really struggling to start the year, but heated up before he was demoted. He was crushing the ball, like he showed he can last year. He also had done that a bit before interleague play started. He's still very young and needs some time and opportunity to adjust to pitchers adjusting to him. He showed enough in the minors and last year (in a larger sample size than this year, no less) that he has incredible bat speed and should be given every opportunity to succeed, not inconsistent playing time between AA-AAA and the majors."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,hail_termite_queen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"The point isn't so much Vargas' development or lack there of, but where the Twins are at. At this point, they need a productive hitter in the DH spot - not a player who is still adjusting to major league pitching. If we were out of the race he'd still be up here.   But instead we're in a position where our elite prospects are getting chances to show they can help the team before we either decide to sell veteran pieces or supplement the roster.   Either way you slice it, the Twins don't have time for Vargas to get it together. He either stays and mashes or goes down and continues to work while getting consistent playing time."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,audiocranium,-1,Sat Jul 4 21:09:27 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but that is the full story. He's played all but 3 weeks of the season, and he's stunk for all but about 2 weeks of the time he's been here.  Look up his stats on baseball reference, you can see the way hes progessed (or not) as the season has gone along.   Bottom line is that he's been really ugly since he came back a month ago.   Until he learns to control the strike zone, he's going to continue to struggle.  He's never done that at any level.  Sano is a much, much better prospect, and deserves a shot. Don't know if Sano will pan out, but Vargas needs major work."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"Look, I admit I'm higher on Vargas than most but even I am not saying he is a Sano-level prospect. That said, that doesn't mean that he should be disregarded or mishandled. He, like Sano, has the potential to be a fixture in our lineup.   You have to keep in mind that Vargas is still essentially a rookie- he has all of 100 games under his belt in the pros. In his first 53 games (last year), he OPS'd .772, an impressive number for a rookie. This year, yes he struggled out of the gate, but it's important to keep in mind that most prospects don't succeed right away.  Even Mike Trout struggled in his first stint.   Vargas actually has controlled the strike zone! In A+, he had 50 walks to 105 strikeouts in 457 ABs. Last year at AA, he had 43 walks to only 68 strikeouts in 386 ABs. For a switch hitting power guy with his frame who can crush the ball like few I've ever watched, whose splits were pretty even in the minors, that is impressive discipline.   And again, those 2 weeks Vargas was absolutely crushing the ball that you mention were inexplicably right before he got sent down. If a guy who OPSed .772 last year struggles for a bit before turning it on, you don't send him down. Pitchers adjust, and you have to give him time to adjust too. It didn't prove anything, he crushed at Rochester basically wasting ABs he should have had in the majors. My main issue is with that- he has hit very well at every level, including the pros, and is young enough where he should be getting consistent at bats with the Twins."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,hail_termite_queen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:22:48 2015 UTC,"Vargas definitely was pretty good last year, and he held his own in AA (which is why he got the call up!).   But he's regressed in a big way.   I guess what surprises me is why you're focused on the two weeks this year he performed well versus the 4 weeks before it and the 4 weeks after it.  He struggled out of the gate, had 9 good games, and then went right back to struggle town, where he's remained for all but 1 game. His numbers are a mess, and he's not getting any better.   I'm definitely not saying they should cut or trade him. It would be fun watching him hit 5th or 6th behind Dozier and Sano for the next decade. It's just that I'm happier with him at AAA for a while remembering how to work a count, rather than striking out over and over again as a pinch hitter in the majors.  He's up to 48 over 166 PAs, with just 7 walks. That's on pace for over 180 strikeouts with like 2 dozen walks. Not good times.  And, his numbers last year seem a little mirage-y on further inspection.  Over 200 plate appearances, he had just 12 walks and 63 strikeouts.   He also had a crazy, totally unsustainable .340 batting average with balls in play.  That means the big numbers last year were inflated by luck, and not what we should expect from him until he improves pretty dramatically.   Let me be clear, I like his raw stuff a lot! And, I understand he's a rookie.  I just don't think it's a mistake to send him down - he's still really raw, and has looked out of his depth."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,0,Fri Jul 3 12:14:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's not really worth butting heads anymore. Again, I'm not ""focused on the two weeks"", I'm just surprised that they sent him down after he started hitting. I think most of this sub generally agrees with me based on upvotes, so I'm not the only one here. It could have very easily been more than two weeks if he stayed up, we will never know. But it's hard to settle in when you're being jerked between levels.  .340, while above league average for sure, is also not a crazy babip for a guy who hits the ball as hard as he does. It varies greatly with hard hit ball/ line drive rates.  Obviously he has to walk more and strike out less, but based on minor league track records he has the potential to do that. Again, he's essentially still a rookie, which it seems hard for you to acknowledge...."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,hail_termite_queen,0,Fri Jul 3 13:51:20 2015 UTC,"Haha, so ""scoreboard"" is your argument, huh? Strong form man.  It's not hard for me to acknowledge that he's a rookie. It's actually my point.  He's really struggling, except for 9 games. He should be getting at bats somewhere else until he figures it out.   I'm curious about what you would do with him.  It sounds like you think hes being mishandled, so where should he go?   If he's the DH, Sano stays at AA. If he's a pinch hitter, he doesn't get many reps. What's the move?  Edit: meant to acknowledge that I agree it was weird timing to send him down when they did in May. Haven't heard a good explanation for that!"
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:04:16 2015 UTC,"No, every argument I've made in this comment chain is my argument. I've refuted a lot of what you've said, in fact. I'm saying you are being downvoted and I'm not, so you acting like you are obviously right isn't really warranted.  Yes, I would have kept him up to DH. He should be DHing with the Twins almost every game, and playing first when he can too. If he doesn't hit for a whole year, or something close to it, then be concerned with his bat.   Sano should be playing 3rd. That's hard with Plouffe, but (kind of) unlike Vargas, Sano has potential defensive value. Vargas is not the one blocking Sano, Plouffe is, and that will be true regardless of what happens with Vargas. They need to figure out what to do with him, which isn't easy. If Sano is the real deal I would probably look to trade Plouffe. Obviously, ideally, Mauer didn't have such a stranglehold at first but can't do much about that.

You also haven't refuted anything I've said - though you do change the subject a lot. (Eg, I make a point about his horrific so/bb ratio this year and last in the majors, you tell me he did fine at AA. I point out that he's been bad all season except for a few games, you tell me I'm wrong because of those few games. I point to his unsustainable high babip, you acknowledge that I'm right, and then hand-wave how important it is).    Downvotes by delusional Twins fans don't phase me much. I was very unpopular when I was telling folks that Suzuki's first half in 2014 was a mirage.  We do agree that the send-off in May was weird. I don't think that his struggles before or after have anything to do with it, though.  You seem to think his bad June is directly attributable to it, I guess?  We also definitely agree about 3rd base. It would be awesome if he stuck there. Do you really think that they would bench Plouffe for Sano at this point though?  And if they don't (which they definitely wont), are you okay with Sano cooling his heels at AA for another season or two?"

minnesotatwins,3bsuha,hail_termite_queen,3,Thu Jul 2 00:08:12 2015 UTC,"He's still in low A- Cedar Rapids, Iowa if you want to make the trip. He looks solid in the field and has a good chance to stick at short, but his bat is a ways away. He has heated up as of late (OPS of .625 on the year now), and has stolen some bases, but definitely won't be up this year or likely next year. 2017 is a good target, possibly September of at this rate. Also important to mention that he is far from a sure-thing prospect."

Ya I know he isn't a sure thing or like a Buxton or Sano but I really like him and think he can become a very good player for us. I love his brother Dee so if he can be anything like him I'd be extremely happy, he's got a good bloodline with Dee and their father so I imagine he knows what it takes to be in the majors and will have them giving him tips along the way."

minnesotatwins,3bsuha,tennisspears,2,Thu Jul 2 13:57:01 2015 UTC,"And for those who play fantasy baseball, he has amazing dual-eligibility on Yahoo at both SS/3B.  Might have the highest power upside of any SS rest of season."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,HughManatee,3,Wed Jul 1 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter at all to me, but why the hell would they have ever given Sano SS eligibilty? He hasn't played SS since 2011 in Rookie ball. (I'm not questioning you, BTW. I just looked on Yahoo and saw it was true. I just think it is stupid that he has it.)"
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,2,Wed Jul 1 21:52:42 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what goes into a player's eligibility.  Seems like there's no rhyme or reason.  I remember back in 2010 or 2011 after the Nats drafted Bryce Harper he was listed in ESPN's database as a catcher -- a position he hadn't played in years and obviously wasn't going to play in the big leagues.  It was removed before he got the call in 2012, however, unlike Sano's SS eligibility."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,HughManatee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I remember right, Harper was a catcher in high school and in his one year of junior college, but I don't think he played a game as catcher after being drafted. I wonder if Sano gets his SS eligibility removed before the game tomorrow. It really makes no sense whatsoever for him to have it."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,2,Wed Jul 1 21:57:35 2015 UTC,"Wow.  It really seemed like Vargas didn't have many opportunities lately either.  I'm excited for Sano, but I'm really bummed that they gave Vargas the shaft like this."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,HughManatee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:44:54 2015 UTC,He's been terrible this season man. He needs a break.
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,2,Thu Jul 2 17:31:57 2015 UTC,"IMO, he's gotten jerked around, getting called up for interleague play, which makes no sense.  He has hardly played, even in a pinch hitting role, so it's no surprise he isn't doing well.  It would have made a lot more sense for them to call up another utility position player for the interleague stretch."

minnesotatwins,3bsuha,mister_self_destruct,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:12:26 2015 UTC,Will he mostly DH with a few games at third when Plouffe needs a break?
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,2,Wed Jul 1 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"I would bet he takes Mauer's spot at first as they attempt to transition him there. Plouffe's defense is way better than Sano's at third, so I can't imagine they are gonna put him there too much.  Also since they sent down Vargas for this move it makes more sense."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,mister_self_destruct,3,Wed Jul 1 21:49:13 2015 UTC,"I bet Sano gets 4-6 days at DH, 1-2 at 3B, and 0-1 at 1B each week to start out. They will shuffle Plouffe over to 1B and DH once in a while (even though they probably should just leave him at 3B) and give him a day off now and then. Mauer will also DH and get a day off here and there."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,themoundie,2,Wed Jul 1 21:54:14 2015 UTC,"I hope not.  The Twins need to see how he does at 3B in the big leagues ASAP so they can figure out who to trade at the deadline.  If Sano plays a competent 3B, we could get a pretty nice haul for Trevor Plouffe."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,mister_self_destruct,3,Wed Jul 1 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"Moving Plouffe would be fine, but I hope everyone keeps expectations in check for what a trade would bring.   He's basically an average - fielding third baseman with average hitting ability. He's probably been our best third baseman since Cory Koskie, but that's a comment on the sad state of the left side of the Twins middle infield more than anything else.  We'd probably get a mid-level prospect or two."
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,RobertService,2,Thu Jul 2 11:52:46 2015 UTC,'Haul' was the wrong word to use.  I'd hope for a couple mid-level prospects or a decent MLB bullpen arm.

minnesotatwins,3bsuha,HakunaMatata023,4,Thu Jul 2 03:32:06 2015 UTC,you seen him play? Hes pretty solid defensively and moves really well for a big guy.    source:seen him at double-A in more than ten games this year
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,Khoops66,3,Thu Jul 2 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"His 2nd best tool is his arm, would be a shame if we had to waste it at 1B or DH."

What if he kills it at DH and they want him in the lineup, and Plouffe keeps performing well. Any chance of making him 1B and possible Mauer trade?? Think any team would take on that salary? Or has he lost all value by moving the 1B and under performing?"
minnesotatwins,3bsuha,kaiserj1982,4,Wed Jul 1 22:29:11 2015 UTC,No.  Longer answer: Hell no. No one is going to pay Joe an ungodly amount of money to be a below average first baseman.

With Torii sitting, that would throw a little more muscle in the heart of the order and if those guys somehow got on base, might get lucky with a Dozier Dong."
minnesotatwins,3brgkk,tokomini,3,Wed Jul 1 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"Johnny Cueto on the mound for Cincinnati this morning/afternoon. A 6-pitch RHP. His hard stuff is a four-seamer thrown 35%, a sinker thrown 18%, and a cutter thrown 19%. The four-seamer and sinker can get up to 95-96 mph while the cutter is a little slower at 91-92. He also has a wonderful change-up at 82-86 thrown 17% and a slider (82-86) and curve ball (79-83) thrown a combined 11%.  Part of what makes Cueto so good is mixing up his six pitches. There's no glaring pitch he'll throw in any certain count, change-ups will be thrown a little more often early to LHH, but left for two strikes to RHH, he'll throw the cutter more when falling behind LHH, but it's the least likely pitch he'll throw behind to RHH. They're just great splits all the way around, leaving a lot of batters to be more lost than usual.  His change-up has a 21.72% whiff this season, with the four-seamer, slider, and curve all getting over 10% whiffs as well. Sinker, curve, and cutter are getting good ground ball numbers at over 10%, and his only pitches that are getting some concerning line drives are the cutter and change at just over 6%.  Batters are hitting the slider the best at .348 BAA/.565 SLG (8 hits in 23 ABs), and having good success against the cutter at .253/.400. The pitch that gets sent out of the ballpark is the change-up (.206/.493), which Cueto has given up 5 homeruns and 6 doubles, as opposed to only 4 singles. His sinker and four-seamer are both being hit unsuccessfully at 27 for 164 combined (11 XBH), and his four-seamer alone has gotten 37 Ks this year.  On the season, Cueto is 4-5 with a 2.98 ERA (3.37 FIP), 92 strikeouts to 19 walks in 96.2 IP. He's a free agent next season with an unlikelihood to re-sign with Cincinnati, so is one of the Reds' top trading options for these next few weeks.  Twins lineup vs. Johnny Cueto -   Dozier: 0 for 3, 1 K  Nunez: 0 for 2  Rosario: Never faced  Plouffe: 0 for 3, 3 K  Vargas: Never faced  Herrmann: Never faced  Santana: Never faced  Robinson: Never faced  May: Never faced"

minnesotatwins,3brgdr,Kripzo,10,Wed Jul 1 15:45:05 2015 UTC,Very true. But the man did have 242 CG's so need to give him props for that.
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,tennisspears,3,Wed Jul 1 15:54:34 2015 UTC,"I guess this is true, but I feel like having either May or Milone as a reliever would help our bullpen, which is the real issue we have."
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,Kripzo,0,Wed Jul 1 15:42:27 2015 UTC,I don't really know that Milone has the stuff to be a one-inning reliever. Maybe as a long-man.
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,tennisspears,2,Wed Jul 1 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"If a guy is having a bad night, like Pelfry the other day, Milone would be able to step in and take the game over for a significant number of innings. Not the most practical, but with unreliable starters it might be something to consider."
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,Kripzo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:16:02 2015 UTC,"Those situations don't happen often enough to warrant keeping yet another low-leverage long guy in the pen (with Graham, Meyer, Duensing). Meyer has gone less than two innings in each of his first two outings, but that was due to ineffectiveness rather than fatigue. He should be able to go 3 or 4 if needed. Graham can go 3 or 4. Duensing went 3 not too long ago. I guess I wouldn't be super opposed to having Milone completely replace Duensing, but Duensing is familiar with going less than an inning while Milone isn't.  If the starters are really unreliable, then that's where you need to make the fix, rather than having a designated ""go six innings when our starter shits the bed"" guy."
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,tennisspears,2,Wed Jul 1 16:27:18 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing, our starters aren't great, so why have a 6 man rotation. We have a few good pitchers, so a 5 game rotation that allows them to play more benefits the team. Because paying Milone to play in AAA doesn't help the team, he could at least play a role from the bullpen. Not ideal, but he is better than Boyer, Thompson, and Duensing. All hypotheticals, so it doesn't matter."
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,Evergreen3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"Milone to the pen is just a non-starter for me. I'd much, much rather send Pelfrey out there than Milone. The only place to move Milone, in my opinion, is AAA (and he doesn't deserve that right now). Or trade him I guess. He has more trade value than Pelfrey.   As for this:    he is better than Boyer, Thompson, and Duensing.   I really don't think we can say that with certainty. It's possible, and might seem likely, but Milone is a totally different kind of pitcher.  Edit: No pun was intended with the ""non-starter"" thing."
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,PhatGiraffe42,2,Wed Jul 1 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"Santana should end up with two starts before the All-Star Break.  Perhaps something (trade, injury) will happen to let them get it down to a five-man rotation.  I'm still at a loss of which SP to send down if they did want to go that way. May? Gibson? Milone? Milone to the bullpen?"
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,kvothe,4,Wed Jul 1 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"There's no way Gibson gets sent down, either May or Milone will get sent to the pen since they've been having issues of late and hopefully Duensing get DFA'd"
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,girlwithaguitar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:52:26 2015 UTC,Sending May to the pen is a terrible idea. He has the most upside in the whole rotation.   Trade Pelf or send Milone to the pen (or AAA).
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,GLineSportsWORDPRESS,2,Thu Jul 2 13:25:12 2015 UTC,I'd rather see May moved to the bullpen.  His stuff seems like it'd fit a bullpen (1-2 inning) role better than starter.
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,girlwithaguitar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree, he has shown flashes of dominance, I feel if you moved him to the bullpen it would just hurt his progression"
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,GLineSportsWORDPRESS,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"He's 25.  What more progression is there for him to make?  If he was 22, I'd give him the benefit of the doubt, but he should be entering his prime as a player, and he's still floundering."
minnesotatwins,3brgdr,GLineSportsWORDPRESS,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like age is almost irrelevant in this debate. This is his first year in the Majors, there will be progression. Kyle Gibson was 25 when he started in the Majors. There has been progression there and he continues to get better. I feel like the same would apply to May. But regardless it sounds like they are moving May to the bullpen anyway."
minnesotatwins,3btdaz,btmalon,4,Thu Jul 2 00:02:57 2015 UTC,"Anywhere but the family section would be fine.  Edit: On second thought, my original reply didn't have enough detail. Sorry about that. Typically when I go to games I just buy standing room tickets and spend the whole game watching from different spots. But since you'll be with a big group that wouldn't be ideal. I recommend sitting along the third base line. Upper or lower deck doesn't matter. You'll have a great view of the field and the Minneapolis skyline. Also, I don't recommend sitting anywhere in the outfield. In the upper decks, part of the field is obstructed. Although, I've never sat in the left field bleachers so I can't comment on what watching the game from there is like."

minnesotatwins,3bsbvc,TwinsGameday,4,Wed Jul 1 19:20:16 2015 UTC,I am not worried. All teams lose games and we played against two very good pitchers today.
minnesotatwins,3bsbvc,davricle,2,Wed Jul 1 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit concerned. Cueto is a good pitcher, but we need to build on the success we had early. July is going to be tough to do that, especially when we can't get momentum going by taking a series from a 4th place team that's below .500.  In July we're playing the Royals, the Orioles, Detroit, the A's, Angels, Yankees, Pirates, and Mariners.  The Royals are good, the entire AL East is hot right now, we haven't played well against Detroit, and the Angels are a tough team with how hot Pujols and Trout are. That leaves us with the Pirates, who are good but we took a two-game series in Pittsburgh earlier this year, the A's, and the Mariners.  If we can make it through July and still be in contention, the Twins will have an excellent shot at a Wild Card slot, at the very least. If not, I think we'll be a .500 team that's shown we're coming out of the slump of the past few years and will be a contender in the future with all our young talent."
minnesotatwins,3bsbvc,novafire08,3,Wed Jul 1 19:39:47 2015 UTC,Sink or swim this month then. If we throw up a June like month we're done. If we can compete against these teams though we'll be in good shape.

minnesotatwins,3bpu6s,TwinsGameday,11,Wed Jul 1 04:35:37 2015 UTC,Back to the basics with the playoff tracker and back to winning for the Twins. Keep it up!

minnesotatwins,3bpu6s,BrianDoziersHair,3,Wed Jul 1 04:43:25 2015 UTC,It would be soooo nice to have more innings where we score multiple runs then hold the other team instead of just giving them all back.
minnesotatwins,3bpu6s,inyourface_milwaukee,7,Wed Jul 1 04:57:41 2015 UTC,"Easy, flawless win with no issues anywhere."

minnesotatwins,3bn5qr,whatsthehappenstance,8,Tue Jun 30 15:58:56 2015 UTC,a whole new bullpen would help a lot too.   Agree. Besides yesterdays horrible outing by Pelfrey. The bullpen has been costing us a lot of games.
minnesotatwins,3bn5qr,kuj4k,6,Tue Jun 30 16:06:46 2015 UTC,Don't we have enough average pitchers?
minnesotatwins,3bn5qr,The_Effing_Eagle,7,Tue Jun 30 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"I think Buchholz would be a little better than ""average"", but something tells me that the Twins would have to give up too much to get him."

minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,taffyowner,34,Mon Jun 29 19:22:42 2015 UTC,I blame Rick Anderson for the last five years FAR more than I would ever blame Gardy.
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,lawre179,9,Mon Jun 29 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seeing the improvements in SP this year does not help his case."
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,hail_termite_queen,3,Mon Jun 29 20:04:57 2015 UTC,"Anderson certainly can be considered a factor, but I think that one of the biggest problems was just lack of talented arms in the rotation. Nick Blackburn, Liam Hendricks, P.J. Walters, Cole DeVries, Samuel Deduno, Yohan Pino, Pedro Hernandez, and others...they all made double digit numbers of starts, and none of them were really good enough to be major leaguers."
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,jonrunski03,3,Tue Jun 30 02:40:23 2015 UTC,Deduno was...........interesting at least
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,CWinter85,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah he'd have the occasional good start, but his control was pretty sporadic."
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,jonrunski03,3,Tue Jun 30 05:07:12 2015 UTC,"That's true, but remember that most of those were #4 or #5 guys.  The biggest indictment against Andy was what happened with Liriano in his first year with Pittsburgh.  The guy had electric stuff but was maddeningly inconsistent, so what does the pitching coach in Pittsburgh do?  Have him bring his hands over his head when pitching from the windup to slow him down.  The problem wasn't just that they were trying to turn a strikeout pitcher into a pitch-to-contact pitcher, they weren't fixing messy mechanics.  You know, like a coach should do."
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,lawre179,2,Tue Jun 30 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree that Liriano had a better year in Pittsburgh, and the coaching certainly looks like it helped. Same could be said for Vance Worley. Seems like coaching has helped him fix some things too. But it's not like we never had a pitcher who flourished in Minnesota while Anderson was coaching. Johan Santana went from a Rule 5 pickup to one of the game's best under Anderson. Liriano had a couple of elite years as a starter in MN. And Carl Pavano and Phil Hughes revived their careers once they started playing for the Twins under Anderson. I think it's understating the problem of lack of talent to say it was just our #4 and #5 guys. Other than Liriano and Hughes who made 73 starts, our 2011-2014 pitchers really lacked for anybody who could be considered a legit #1-3 starter during the time. I don't think that different coaching could have changed that."
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,jonrunski03,2,Tue Jun 30 04:55:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that example, I feel like crediting Anderson for Santana's success would be like crediting Joe Vavra for Mauer's success. You're absolutely right that the talent was not there (I still firmly believe that the Twins will not win another World Series with the current front office), but there were fringe guys like Nick Blackburn and Scott Diamond that showed enough flashes of decency to where a good pitching coach could have made it work.  Anderson never timed mound visits well and they would always leave pitchers in for too long.  Again, bad coaching, bad managing."
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,lawre179,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"I'm with you that crediting Anderson for Santana may not be accurate. But I think it's a dishonest argument to say ""Rick Anderson made the bad pitchers bad, but he had nothing to do with the good pitchers being good."" If we say he has a major effect on the pitching staff, then we have to get into a lot more specific details before we can really establish how all of the facets of his coaching affected each player. If all we're doing is saying ""He coached these guys, and they were bad,"" then in order for it to be an honest argument, we also have to say ""He coached these other guys, and they were good.""  By most measures the Twins were one of the better pitching teams from 2002-2010, and they were one of the worst ones from 2011-2014. Do you think that something changed that made their coaching/managing worse? Or was there something about the pitchers during the earlier years that made them more receptive to the coaching? Maybe, but without specific details, I don't see it. The best explanation I can see is that the pitchers themselves were less talented."

minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,lawre179,7,Mon Jun 29 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"It would be very interesting to see what he can do with ownership that's actually willing to spend money on acquiring talent.  The $55mil contract we gave to Ervin Santana is the biggest contract we've ever offered to a free agent and I'm pretty sure the Pohlad family was on bed rest for the following three weeks because of it.  That, plus I think his best years as a Twins manager were when he used the Twins like an NL team -- Ozzie Guillen lovingly referred to some of our players as ""the Piranhas"" because we would nibble away at opposing pitchers with smallball tactics -- until Mauer's MVP year seduced him to favor power hitting.  I think he could really thrive in a more cerebral culture than your average AL clubhouse."
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,SenatorAstronomer,6,Mon Jun 29 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"He's going to make them battle their tails off, that's for sure."
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Tue Jun 30 01:45:01 2015 UTC,It's pretty cool when he argues. His face gets really red and he occasionally kicks his hat. I saw that hat go up 20 ft once.

minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,Primetime15,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:55:08 2015 UTC,Loved to watch him field/dive head first into first. Hated everything else and the fact that he has a ring.

minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,Kruse,2,Wed Jul 1 00:00:33 2015 UTC,His face will match the Phillies colors and uniforms very well.
minnesotatwins,3bjcj1,newtizzle,2,Mon Jun 29 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"Like us, you are going to love him. His players do too. Great guy. I think we were just in a rut, and we needed a change."

But I agree with everyone else, don't let him bring Rick Anderson"

minnesotatwins,3bk92o,DetectiveWoofles,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:20:28 2015 UTC,What makes that even more sad is that our backup catcher isn't Suzuki.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,2,Tue Jun 30 02:21:11 2015 UTC,Somehow after having the best catcher in the league for years it's our weakest position. Guess they figured Joe could catch forever.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,DetectiveWoofles,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:22:17 2015 UTC,"Joe's decline has really been the story of the Twins. Handing him a huge contract, then he is forced to change positions.."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:24:04 2015 UTC,The huge contract doesnt mean shit. Not like there is a salary cap in baseball.

minnesotatwins,3bk92o,tennisspears,0,Tue Jun 30 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"Without walks or stolen bases, this game would have been easily won. They advanced 10 (I think) bases on those alone."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,3,Tue Jun 30 02:19:03 2015 UTC,It's a shame we couldn't score with Rosario and Robinson in easy scoring positions.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:17:35 2015 UTC,And then managed to let them score in the a more difficult scenario twice.

minnesotatwins,3bk92o,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:11:53 2015 UTC,Suzuki down during warmup tosses. Another thing to rub dirt on and play through and be tough while being more and more useless.

minnesotatwins,3bk92o,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 30 02:14:00 2015 UTC,Catcher got knocked down during warm up. Not sure if they showed it on FSN.

minnesotatwins,3bk92o,DetectiveWoofles,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:00:58 2015 UTC,Im sure he was hoping to force the pitcher to field it and make a panic throw to first. Potentially get a passed ball.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,FlannelBeard,2,Tue Jun 30 02:08:28 2015 UTC,Hamilton made an out!
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,tennisspears,2,Tue Jun 30 01:58:23 2015 UTC,How many bases have been earned off of steals against us this game? I can't remember a time so many runners advanced off of steals.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,2,Tue Jun 30 01:58:05 2015 UTC,Let's not do that anymore.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,3,Tue Jun 30 01:53:19 2015 UTC,Perfect bunt.

minnesotatwins,3bk92o,AdaAstra,2,Tue Jun 30 01:06:10 2015 UTC,Uh... did Leake just strike out on a 2-1 pitch? Votto did walk on ball 3 earlier this season. http://www.cincinnati.com/story/redsblog/2015/05/31/watch-reds-joey-votto-walk-on-3-balls/28284739/
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,ChiefakaJames,3,Tue Jun 30 00:56:48 2015 UTC,No. First pitch was called a strike because the batter didn't check his swing
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,SplurgingSpurgeon,2,Tue Jun 30 00:59:58 2015 UTC,It was a 1-2 pitch.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,DetectiveWoofles,2,Tue Jun 30 00:59:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, Reds broadcast had it shown as 2-1, so was confused."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,ChiefakaJames,3,Tue Jun 30 01:00:43 2015 UTC,We need Lucroy on this team. We would have at least two more outs and saved enough runs to have us winning this game.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,2,Tue Jun 30 00:55:01 2015 UTC,Yeah. Kurt is 35th among 40 active catchers on caught stealing percentage.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,feceseverywhere,2,Tue Jun 30 01:02:33 2015 UTC,"Leake staying in? Thanks, I guess.  edit: Graham... it's a good hitting pitcher, but it's still a pitcher, damnit."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,ChiefakaJames,3,Tue Jun 30 00:54:34 2015 UTC,They have a slightly worse bullpen than us. If that helps make logic of it.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,2,Tue Jun 30 00:56:09 2015 UTC,Unbelievable. Dozier's the best second baseman in baseball. I scared the dog and it started biting me when I jumped up after that home run.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,feceseverywhere,3,Tue Jun 30 00:53:47 2015 UTC,I almost stopped watching but kept it on in the background while I played Marvel Puzzle Quest on my phone. Pretty stoked.

minnesotatwins,3bk92o,DetectiveWoofles,-1,Tue Jun 30 00:40:14 2015 UTC,"I am stuck at work, but does this Meyer kid look like a bust or what?"
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,schrica,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:30:12 2015 UTC,He inherited runners in scoring position with one out and a huge score deficit. And it was his second time in that situation in only his second MLB game. I don't think it's any indication whatsoever.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"He's had a bad first 8 outs into a major league career, yes."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"Two outings should not have changed anyone's opinion of him, really. Unless you thought he was a bust already, based on him being a 25 year old who hadn't even made his debut, he shouldn't be now. If you didn't think he was a bust before, it is far too early to say he is one now."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:33:03 2015 UTC,How do you feel about him Tennis?
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,schrica,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:34:53 2015 UTC,Ask me.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,RobertService,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:40:21 2015 UTC,How do you feel about him?
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,schrica,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:43:14 2015 UTC,"I think his ceiling is a reliever in MLB. He has durability problems, shoulder problems and trouble throwing strikes. He'll never be a successful starter in the majors. I think I said a few months ago that his MLB career will be less than 500 innings. I still think that."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,RobertService,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:46:46 2015 UTC,So was he worth trading Span for him?
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,schrica,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:12:34 2015 UTC,"Well I thought so at the time, but now I think it was a huge mistake."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,RobertService,2,Tue Jun 30 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"I've always said that he could be an effective MLB pitcher if and only if he gets his walks down. How far he gets his walks down will determine whether he can be a starter (would need a BB/9 of less than 3) or a reliever (which would probably require about a BB/9 between 3 and 4). With a higher walk rate, he won't be effective."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:39:37 2015 UTC,"If Boston beats the Blue Jays (which they are) and the Indians beat the Rays (which they are), the Twins will remain in the same position in the Wild Card standings. There is no difference between a 20-1 loss and 2-1, and if other teams lose it won't matter in the standings."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,2,Tue Jun 30 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"Well hey, one time the Indians came back from a 12 run deficit to win..."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,2,Tue Jun 30 00:25:56 2015 UTC,It's almost like Escobar isn't an outfielder.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,tennisspears,3,Tue Jun 30 00:22:09 2015 UTC,"Ok, now I'm done for the night. I'm actually starting to get angry now."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,AdaAstra,3,Tue Jun 30 00:22:01 2015 UTC,I keep telling myself I'm gonna turn the game off and then I turn it back on. What is wrong with me?

minnesotatwins,3bk92o,AdaAstra,3,Tue Jun 30 00:19:13 2015 UTC,"Not just good, the Reds look fucking unbeatable based on this game...."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,Kripzo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:22:49 2015 UTC,It's just who they are....a 90 loss team that had a good streak.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,RobertService,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:22:05 2015 UTC,Tennis doesn't agree but I'm not the least bit surprised that Meyer is still walking too many guys.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,RobertService,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:19:01 2015 UTC,"I just said 3 or so walks per 9 is acceptable, because that's where he was at as a reliever in AAA. He is currently at 3 walks in 2 innings. That's way too high."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,tennisspears,0,Tue Jun 30 00:21:49 2015 UTC,I just don't why 17 innings of relief would change anybody's mind about him.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,RobertService,2,Tue Jun 30 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"Billy has more stolen bases on the season than the Twins have as a team (and 14 other teams), by the way."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 30 00:18:31 2015 UTC,Yeah....that is what happens when you are fast.  I'm really hoping we can do the same with Buxton.
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,AdaAstra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"Buxton and Hamilton are both very fast, yes, but Hamilton has the stolen base ""gene"" and figured that out pretty much instantly in his career. Buxton still has a bit to go.   Buxton is 92 for 118 in stolen bases in the minors (4 seasons), Hamilton stole 165 bases alone in 2012."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"Hamilton stole 165 bases alone in 2012.   Holy shit. I had already known this, but just seeing that number blows my mind."
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:28:50 2015 UTC,I think we should walk Billy Hamilton again... Yeah that sounds good. What could go wrong?
minnesotatwins,3bk92o,DetectiveWoofles,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:15:29 2015 UTC,At least another guy is in his way at third base this time.

minnesotatwins,3bicmu,pman5595,10,Mon Jun 29 13:45:12 2015 UTC,Trade/option Duensing... Figure it out from there
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,taffyowner,3,Mon Jun 29 14:02:13 2015 UTC,"It hurts to read because of how consistent he's been year over year, but he looks to be a different pitcher now. Glancing at the stats briefly, most of our pitchers have cut their ERA in half from what they were last year. Duensing doubled his. Not a game in recent memory that he's been below 6.0."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,DayToDayInFlipFlops,6,Mon Jun 29 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"I think unless they trade someone, this is exactly what will happen. I'm sure it will be frustrating for Milone since he has been pitching pretty well lately."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,alexandercr8,4,Mon Jun 29 13:57:51 2015 UTC,"Thompson goes down, May/Milone to relief, Santana into the rotation."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,Kripzo,5,Mon Jun 29 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"Milone has been outstanding in his time in the rotation, i'd send May to the 'pen, or i would trade Pelfrey for some good prospects that could help the team next year, because even if this team makes it to the playoffs, i don't think they're quite built enough for the World Series."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,InfiniteDeWitt,3,Mon Jun 29 15:37:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. Actually, I wouldn't mind getting rid or Nolasco, Pelfry, Arcia, Plouffe, and Suzuki. We have the prospects to make a title push in the next 5-10 seasons, and we need real MLB aces if we want to do better than a race for a wild card spot. A lot of really good pitchers are potential free agents next season, and if we could free up the money to invest in high profile talent to compliment Buxton, Sano, Dozier, Rosario, Vargas (?), and Hicks (?), we could have a team that is certainly competitive, instead of having uncertain expectations."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,Kripzo,4,Mon Jun 29 15:47:01 2015 UTC,Only problem with getting rid of Suzuki is who catches for this team full time? Because Hermann is a backup
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,taffyowner,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:25:02 2015 UTC,Suzuki is the perfect guy to groom somebody once they are ready for the spot. He won't be going anywhere for a while.
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,AdanTSA,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind releasing Nolasco, he's been horrid since we signed him, but they keep giving him chances and expect him to turn it around when it's clear that besides 1 or 2 decent starts, he is just not what we signed for and he should stay in AAA or get released."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,InfiniteDeWitt,0,Mon Jun 29 15:50:50 2015 UTC,He's being paid 12 million. Duensing is being paid 2.7 million. Suzuki is on a 5.5 million deal through 2019. Those guys need to be off the books ASAP. That 20 million a year could be reinvested into some serious talent.
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,Kripzo,5,Mon Jun 29 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"Kurt Suzuki is only signed through 2016, with a vesting option for 2017. And 5.5M (or 6M for 2016) is pretty much the going rate for veteran catchers right now, even if they can't hit worth a damn (see Jared Saltalamacchia's deal with Miami)."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,tennisspears,-1,Mon Jun 29 18:06:06 2015 UTC,Holy crap those are bad investments by Ryan.
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,InfiniteDeWitt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:29:23 2015 UTC,Just because we pay someone like an Ace doesn't make them so.
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,Kripzo,2,Mon Jun 29 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"I never thought of Nolasco as an ace, i always thought of him as a #2 or #3 guy. Now there are trade talks about us trying to get either Bucholz or Samardzija, and i want neither of those guys. They are barely better than Nolasco."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,InfiniteDeWitt,-2,Mon Jun 29 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"Nolasco and Arcia, can go for sure, we spend way too much for the little that they have contributed.  Pelfry idk, hes been throwing pretty good lately. Plouffe is difficult, because I think he has potential to be a better hitter if he would stop hitting into so many double plays.."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,Sicknatur3_MN,6,Mon Jun 29 17:33:27 2015 UTC,Arcia is still pre-arb. They have hardly spent anything on him...
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,tennisspears,2,Mon Jun 29 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"He is still pretty young and has shown great power, it would be dumb to cut him for nothing."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,AdanTSA,5,Tue Jun 30 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how it will work out, been debating this with co-workers for the last couple of weeks. I feel like you trade Pelfrey and what ever else to bring in a DH, then you can option Duensing/Thompson. I like Milone in the rotation."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,doublea08,3,Mon Jun 29 15:04:32 2015 UTC,We will likely lose Pelfrey after this season anyway. We might as well get something for him when we can.
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,7Finger,3,Mon Jun 29 17:13:10 2015 UTC,Trade Pelfrey.  He's in a walk year.  Flip him for some parts which could help in a few years.
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,dabecka,2,Mon Jun 29 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"Trade Pelfrey.  We could actually get something of value for him and as much as I like him, he is is replaceable in the rotation we already have."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,AdaAstra,2,Mon Jun 29 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"If we have to trade someone, it should be Pelfrey. We will probably lose him after the season anyway, and we might as well get something for him.  Otherwise I would send Milone back to AAA as an insurance policy in case someone gets hurt or flames out.  The other question is what to do if Nolasco ever comes back. He helps the team most when he is on the DL."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,7Finger,2,Mon Jun 29 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"They'll have to do two moves with Nolasco coming back. I'd say send Thompson down, DFA Duensing and move May & Milone to the bullpen. Unless you have Nolasco be in the bullpen instead."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,KyleByFire,2,Mon Jun 29 17:49:10 2015 UTC,"Nolasco can stay in the minors for all I care, that guy is a bum."

minnesotatwins,3bicmu,KyleByFire,0,Mon Jun 29 18:48:06 2015 UTC,Sunk cost. Doesn't make sense to play a worse rotation just because we paid for it.
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,Taub-NUT,2,Tue Jun 30 00:00:38 2015 UTC,The news about his injury hasn't been good for awhile. I don't think we'll have to worry about Nolasco anytime soon.
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,overratedfood,2,Tue Jun 30 16:50:40 2015 UTC,"Trade Pelfrey for whatever you can get, Santana to the rotation.   Cut Duensing and bring up Taylor Rogers as a lefty specialist."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,coachbrew,2,Mon Jun 29 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"Package pelfrey with plouffe and get a mid ranked prospect in return, then get Santana in the rotation as call up Sano."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,Heyitscharlie,2,Mon Jun 29 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"I personally hope there is a trade. If the Twins could move Pelfrey, who I don't think is the difference between us making a playoff run and folding, and maybe even Plouffe I would be happy. Buzz around twitter is that Sano might be nearing a promotion and I would rather see him get time at third than spend time DHing in the majors. A rotation of Gibson, Hughes, May, Milone and Santana would be fun and I'm all in for promoting our prospects to at least get a look at them now."

minnesotatwins,3bicmu,huckahammer93,-5,Fri Jul 3 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"It better be May to the Bullpen and Thompson down, or May down. I like May, but he has the worst starter's ERA on the team, worst BAA, lowest innings per start, worst record. By contrast, Milone has best BAA, best winning %, 2nd best ERA, he's our only lefty.     If they send down Milone I'm calling for Molitor's head on a stake."
minnesotatwins,3bicmu,LoveCommittinSins,3,Mon Jun 29 15:43:30 2015 UTC,"May has a better xFIP though, which is much more predictive of future performance."

I know you don't want to have a statistical debate, and you don't have to, because you wouldn't have the slightest hint of a case.

With Santana and Nolasco both coming back in the next few weeks, and Milone pitching well, there isn't much room for youth experimentation in the lineup.

minnesotatwins,3bc89u,cadderly09,3,Sat Jun 27 21:15:08 2015 UTC,He wouldn't get in even without the Infante BS. Altuve would win the vote and Kipnis would be the reserve.  The only way Dozier gets there this year is if one of those three gets hurt or they take three 2B (which sucks because he's playing out of his mind this year).
minnesotatwins,3bc89u,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,7,Sat Jun 27 21:22:48 2015 UTC,He should get in if they take three considering he's better than Altuve
minnesotatwins,3bc89u,pman5595,3,Sat Jun 27 22:09:42 2015 UTC,Yeah he'll absolutely be in if they take three.
minnesotatwins,3bc89u,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,3,Sat Jun 27 22:41:09 2015 UTC,"He's 2nd in OPS by a lot, 2nd in WAR and is a stud defensively. He should ABSOLUTELY be in over Altuve, who is OPSing .725 to Dozier's .881."
minnesotatwins,3bc89u,hail_termite_queen,4,Sat Jun 27 22:29:38 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%, but Dozier isn't even top 5 in vote right now.  It doesn't matter if Infante wins or Altuve wins the vote, Kipnis will be the reserve pick either way.  Don't misunderstand me, I think Dozier and Kipnis should be the two 2B to go.  It's just not likely to happen.  And that sucks."
minnesotatwins,3bc89u,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,8,Sat Jun 27 22:33:36 2015 UTC,I approve of this thread. Dude is slick as hell in the field (loved his scoop toss today) and his average is finally above .270! An OPS+ of 137 isn't bad either.  Big Doz doesn't get enough love.

Clear up some space for Sano and maybe give up a pitching prospect in the deal, but I'd be okay with that."
minnesotatwins,3bd949,AnalAttackProbe,0,Sun Jun 28 20:30:18 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd take him for free right now. He's having a pretty bad year and his hitting is grossly inflated by Coors field. His career batting average split is .325 at home compared to .275 away. At 20M a year till he's 35 (currently 30) he could easily become Mauer 2.0  edit - his full career batting line split is  home - .325/.397/.563  away - .275/.347/.466
minnesotatwins,3bd949,forgetfulburglar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:42:50 2015 UTC,.325 and .275 are still better than almost the entire rest of our roster. I would take that if it meant 30 fewer errors than Santana!
minnesotatwins,3bd949,taffyowner,0,Mon Jun 29 01:43:25 2015 UTC,That .325 is going to plummet once he gets out of Colorado
minnesotatwins,3bd949,dabecka,2,Mon Jun 29 05:57:17 2015 UTC,but he's still THE BEST 2-way shortstop in the bigs.  It drastically upgrades a position of need and might be a 3-5 win swing considering the shitsandwich the Twins are throwing out there now.
minnesotatwins,3bd949,DownwithGoldy,2,Tue Jun 30 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"Plouffe would be great to trade, but as long as they're in the Wild Card hunt it won't make sense to trade him."
minnesotatwins,3bd949,kvothe,4,Mon Jun 29 01:20:22 2015 UTC,"This team is not built for a stretch run this year. If we trade away anyone with long term value for a short term upgrade, I will be very upset.  Personally, I'd try and move Pelfrey and maybe Arcia."
minnesotatwins,3bd949,InfiniteDeWitt,6,Sun Jun 28 14:44:13 2015 UTC,"Arcia definitely shouldn't get moved at such low value, he's sitting in AAA right now where he is hitting .186 in 86 ABs."

minnesotatwins,3bd949,dat_1_dude,6,Sun Jun 28 20:03:31 2015 UTC,I'm not saying Mauer is doing well this year. I'm saying its naive saying we should just release him. It shows that you don't understand how MLB contracts work.

minnesotatwins,3bd949,dat_1_dude,2,Sun Jun 28 20:16:15 2015 UTC,Its good. I could have been a little less crass about it. I'm just tired of folks bashing Mauer. They weren't happy when he was hitting .300/.400/.450. Now that he had a brain injury he's regressed. Its sad.
minnesotatwins,3bd949,pman5595,-8,Sun Jun 28 20:31:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I stuck with him when everyone was angry at him for being a singles hitter because he was a damn good singles hitter. Not anymore :(
minnesotatwins,3bd949,dat_1_dude,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:33:02 2015 UTC,I think as a player who's skill set was excellent vision and quick hands that allowed him to hold off on a pitch and flick it into left field he was affected more by the concussion.

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,novafire08,3,Sat Jun 27 20:55:17 2015 UTC,Save 24 coming up for Perk!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,7,Sat Jun 27 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"First thing I said when I got home: ""I'm calling another home run for torii.""   BRB GOING TO PLAY THE LOTTERY"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,50in15,7,Sat Jun 27 20:51:35 2015 UTC,"Torii Hunter and the awesomely horrific, multi-donger, Brewer slaying day."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 20:50:41 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, Torii! 2 dongs in one game, noice!"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,BrianDoziersHair,4,Sat Jun 27 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"And hunter says, yep."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,AdaAstra,5,Sat Jun 27 20:50:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, Torii did it again."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat Jun 27 20:50:09 2015 UTC,KA-BOOOOOOM!!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 27 20:50:05 2015 UTC,Everytime I see Lucroy at bat for Milwaukee I remember good ol' Matty Lecroy.  We could use him at catcher this year
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,TOPGEAR1992,2,Sat Jun 27 20:43:18 2015 UTC,He's the bullpen coach for the Nationals now!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,pman5595,3,Sat Jun 27 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"I saw Latroy Hawkins was still pitching somehow, for the Rockies I think.   That brought back memories."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,SplurgingSpurgeon,3,Sat Jun 27 20:47:51 2015 UTC,Hawkins was the best.  Had hardly any control at all but would throw fireballs all day long
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,TOPGEAR1992,3,Sat Jun 27 20:50:11 2015 UTC,Or Mike Redmond.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,novafire08,3,Sat Jun 27 20:44:01 2015 UTC,Hard to believe he was the manager for the Miami Marlins
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,TOPGEAR1992,3,Sat Jun 27 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"Anyone else notice that every pitcher's cutter is a ""little cutter"" to Bert?"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,tennisspears,2,Sat Jun 27 20:42:42 2015 UTC,"Fien warming for the 8th after Boyer got the out in the 7th. Guess that ""keep Boyer as 8th inning guy"" didn't last long."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:38:08 2015 UTC,I'm happy with a Boyer-Fien-Perkins setup. I trust Fien more anyway.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,4,Sat Jun 27 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"""That's how he's got the average up! Instead of one hit a game, it's two hits a game!""... No shit?! He got his average up by getting more hits?!"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,4,Sat Jun 27 20:31:22 2015 UTC,Dozier is straight on fire right now. If he hits .270-.275 all year he is maybe the best 2B in the game.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 27 20:31:18 2015 UTC,Hooooo! That was dirty!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,dachristensen,5,Sat Jun 27 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"Dick called it before he swung, hahaha."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,4,Sat Jun 27 20:26:57 2015 UTC,Dat curve.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"Well...not a home run, but I don't want to throw this away. Brewers can still explode at any time."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 27 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry Twins, but it's nap time."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,kaiserj1982,5,Sat Jun 27 20:14:17 2015 UTC,There's no arguing against a weekend mid-afternoon nap.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat Jun 27 20:19:46 2015 UTC,This team has had no luck with stolen bases lately.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,7,Sat Jun 27 20:13:15 2015 UTC,Hunter and Gibson didn't look happy with one another.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,SplurgingSpurgeon,7,Sat Jun 27 20:10:29 2015 UTC,Was hunter actually upset at Gibson for that? I'm at a bar with no audio and could only see the facial expressions. Neither seemed overly joking.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Amerikanarin,6,Sat Jun 27 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he legit looked pissed."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,SplurgingSpurgeon,5,Sat Jun 27 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"I'm at work, what happened??"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,mikerowave612,5,Sat Jun 27 20:15:17 2015 UTC,Gibson fouled out bunting.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Amerikanarin,9,Sat Jun 27 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"Gibson had a bad at bat, striking out on a bunt attempt.  Torii was giving him sh*t when he got back to the dug out."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,schrica,6,Sat Jun 27 20:22:38 2015 UTC,"But not like a ""ha good try bud. You are just a pitcher after all."""
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Amerikanarin,5,Sat Jun 27 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"hard to tell, the audio did not pick up what they were saying."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,schrica,6,Sat Jun 27 20:14:03 2015 UTC,That Hunter commercial will be a classic......always.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,AdaAstra,3,Sat Jun 27 20:02:18 2015 UTC,The stream I'm watching doesn't have commercials. Was it the party one where he smashes the pinata?
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,novafire08,3,Sat Jun 27 20:05:06 2015 UTC,The pick 10 one where he is dancing with the older Twins staffer.

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,novafire08,4,Sat Jun 27 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"Shift happens, Lind."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,4,Sat Jun 27 20:02:12 2015 UTC,"Dozier is so, so good. And as the season goes on he just keeps getting better."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 20:01:53 2015 UTC,I really hope he and Perkins make the All-Star team.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,novafire08,3,Sat Jun 27 20:02:46 2015 UTC,Jeeeeeze. Lucky we got those outs!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,6,Sat Jun 27 20:01:40 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah!

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,4,Sat Jun 27 20:00:20 2015 UTC,Thank you ball for staying up.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat Jun 27 20:00:16 2015 UTC,Forgot all about Richie Sexson. Had a couple 45 HR years with Milwaukee.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,4,Sat Jun 27 19:57:48 2015 UTC,I hope we get a picture of all the moth balls in Gibson's locker
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,inyourface_milwaukee,5,Sat Jun 27 19:52:19 2015 UTC,I don't get it.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,novafire08,6,Sat Jun 27 19:58:51 2015 UTC,Gibson had a moth on his hat pitching to the first batter of the inning. Sat there the whole time.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,inyourface_milwaukee,3,Sat Jun 27 19:59:39 2015 UTC,Now I get it.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,novafire08,6,Sat Jun 27 20:01:19 2015 UTC,Moth balls?
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,dachristensen,5,Sat Jun 27 19:52:48 2015 UTC,I just realized its supposed to be one word....These not these
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,inyourface_milwaukee,8,Sat Jun 27 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"Fuck yeah, the Wild signed Dubnyk to a 6 year deal"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,AdaAstra,6,Sat Jun 27 19:52:03 2015 UTC,All the MN sport teams are on their way up. Gunna be an exciting decade!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,inyourface_milwaukee,6,Sat Jun 27 19:58:03 2015 UTC,6 years kind of scares me.  Hopefully we aren't regretting it after year 4 or 5 like we are Backstroms deal.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,schrica,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:56:53 2015 UTC,Most of the money is in the first few years. So it they would be able to buy him out after year 4 or 5 w/o too much of a cap hit.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,dachristensen,3,Sat Jun 27 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"One down, one to go. Fletcher said he wanted both Dubnyk and Granlund signed by the end of today."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,dachristensen,5,Sat Jun 27 19:54:51 2015 UTC,THey put hot dogs on pizza now at Pizza Hut?  That just sounds disgusting.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,AdaAstra,4,Sat Jun 27 19:50:25 2015 UTC,I had Pizza Hut last weekend and I ended up throwing up from it.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,kaiserj1982,6,Sat Jun 27 19:51:37 2015 UTC,No doubt on that one. I thought Torii had hit more than 9 this year though.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,novafire08,4,Sat Jun 27 19:46:41 2015 UTC,Crushed it.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,tennisspears,4,Sat Jun 27 19:45:46 2015 UTC,Hunter responding to that call being overturned at 1st with a loon shot!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,BrianDoziersHair,4,Sat Jun 27 19:45:35 2015 UTC,Sweet baby Jesus.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 27 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"WE CAN HIT HOMERUNS TOO, MILWAUKEE."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,SplurgingSpurgeon,3,Sat Jun 27 19:45:21 2015 UTC,Dick's inflection was warranted on that one.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,4,Sat Jun 27 19:45:21 2015 UTC,Hunter. Absolute Legend.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 19:45:21 2015 UTC,ONE MORE YEAR! ONE MORE YEAR!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,kaiserj1982,2,Sat Jun 27 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"The ""it's not a bad play because 3B was playing back"" is still bad if the guy at the plate has shown that he can't bunt."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jun 27 19:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, doesn't matter where the third basemen is playing if the batter bunts it to the pitcher or pops it straight up."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,tennisspears,5,Sat Jun 27 19:43:42 2015 UTC,Is it just me or do shifts seem a lot more prominent in today's baseball? Maybe I just didn't pay as much attention when I was younger.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,SplurgingSpurgeon,5,Sat Jun 27 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. Shifts are way, way more prominent these days. The technology to track hitting tendencies of batters makes almost every player a unique case now. If you ever see a game in person, you can notice that when the count changes, like to two strikes, shifts get very extreme since they can no longer bunt."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 27 19:47:29 2015 UTC,"They really throw me off too, sometimes I think a ball is a for-sure hit and they hit right into the shift and vice versa where I think a ball is a for-sure out and they hit away from the shift.   Analytics taking over the game."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,SplurgingSpurgeon,2,Sat Jun 27 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"Well you can even notice with Mauer. In the past he's hit so many balls up the middle, that now they actually shade him more center, he's getting thrown out more on balls that used to be hits for him."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 27 20:15:10 2015 UTC,I always argue this when people talk about his dropped avg. but it usually gets brushed aside. It doesn't account for all of it but it has a considerable impact.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,dachristensen,2,Sat Jun 27 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"The shift has affected him a bit, not all of his struggles are due to it, obviously, but I've seen quite a few sure-singles get snatched up behind second where they usually never play. I suppose that means shifts are pretty effective against some batters!"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 27 20:28:56 2015 UTC,Exactly! What used to be singles though the middle or left side are now ground outs. They're in the same spot it's just now within a fielder's range.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,dachristensen,3,Sat Jun 27 20:32:10 2015 UTC,The two strike part you see more with the Twins than other teams - other teams typically move into a shift and stick with it in all counts.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,5,Sat Jun 27 19:53:39 2015 UTC,Could be both. A lot more stats available for hitters now too.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,y2jayjk,3,Sat Jun 27 19:41:50 2015 UTC,Following the box today. IKEA FOR A COUCH.   Looks like our pitching didn't self destruct. That's always helpful.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,y2jayjk,3,Sat Jun 27 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"Joe ""whatchu know about that"" Mauer- boosting those stats; quieting those haters."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,4,Sat Jun 27 19:39:09 2015 UTC,"38 for Garza, 6 for Gibson that inning."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,tennisspears,4,Sat Jun 27 19:36:12 2015 UTC,Dick and Bert talking gloves and then that Dozier glove play worked perfectly.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat Jun 27 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"And then that fielding percentage infographic afterward. .995, dayum!"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,BrianDoziersHair,5,Sat Jun 27 19:35:45 2015 UTC,What a sweet play by Dozier. BRB voting for him with my 10 emails.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 27 19:34:34 2015 UTC,Man. Don't sleep on Lucroy's arm
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,50in15,3,Sat Jun 27 19:27:56 2015 UTC,cuz it'll feel funny the rest of the day all pins and needles and stuff
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,50in15,3,Sat Jun 27 19:28:31 2015 UTC,You ever wake up after sleeping on an arm? Scary. Not being able to move my are always terrifies me.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 27 19:31:04 2015 UTC,Ever wake up after sleeping on Lucroy? Equally terrifying.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 19:34:20 2015 UTC,I dunno he's kinda cute.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 27 19:34:55 2015 UTC,Are the wheels falling off the Garza Bus?
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,kaiserj1982,3,Sat Jun 27 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"Every time I see him play, I am reminded why we traded him away."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,4,Sat Jun 27 19:27:51 2015 UTC,These are all great at-bats. Working the pitch count in this inning is good news for the Twins.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"Something on the order of 37 pitches, if I counted correctly after the infographic?"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,BrianDoziersHair,2,Sat Jun 27 19:30:47 2015 UTC,Ended up being 38.

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"Seriously Santana, you are really trying to do everything to not be an MLB player.  Bring back the Santana of last year......please....?"
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,AdaAstra,6,Sat Jun 27 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"Aaaand all of a sudden, I miss anyone not named Santana.  Edit: That out was way better, I'd like to see moar, please."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,BrianDoziersHair,5,Sat Jun 27 18:47:43 2015 UTC,I think we need to put Santana down.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,7,Sat Jun 27 18:47:40 2015 UTC,Santana isn't making his case to stay in the majors...
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Markoshollo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:47:15 2015 UTC,Is it weird to anyone else that Gibson is only two years older than May and Meyer?
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:40:05 2015 UTC,It's weird to me that I'm older than Phil Hughes. I'm 32 will be 33 on Monday and Phil just turned 29.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,kaiserj1982,5,Sat Jun 27 18:46:50 2015 UTC,I can't wait for next weekend when we start having Saturday night games.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,kaiserj1982,5,Sat Jun 27 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"Nice try Verizon, I'm not going to a Pirate's game."

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:38:24 2015 UTC,Great slider there.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,5,Sat Jun 27 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"At this point, we are doing so much better than yesterday that any result is a win."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,4,Sat Jun 27 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"Man, these looong pop flies are killing me."

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"He did that last night too. ""Nunez BLASTS THIS ONE DEEP CENTER!! ...And Gomez runs it down."""
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 27 18:40:17 2015 UTC,The inflection is what really sells it and then the feeling of air being let out of a balloon. Gaaaah.

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:23:40 2015 UTC,7 walks now in the last 7+ games (including the one in first PA). He had 5 walks in all of May.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat Jun 27 18:28:37 2015 UTC,I'm convinced he was playing through an injury for part of the season. Ever since his last home-run he has looked great!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Kripzo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:31:35 2015 UTC,Doing my part.  LGTWINS
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,50in15,2,Sat Jun 27 18:23:16 2015 UTC,Only Dozier huh? Haha.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 27 18:41:34 2015 UTC,Heatley wasn't an option

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,BrianDoziersHair,9,Sat Jun 27 18:19:49 2015 UTC,Beat these damn Brewers!
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,SplurgingSpurgeon,3,Sat Jun 27 18:14:07 2015 UTC,Anyone else think that little Dozier vignette was a bit...odd?
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,CentralAmerican,8,Sat Jun 27 18:10:31 2015 UTC,I believe in Dozier.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,kaiserj1982,4,Sat Jun 27 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"Something they made before the season most likely, and since he hit another leadoff HR yesterday, figured it was as good a time as any. They have a Torii and Joe one, too."
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jun 27 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"C'mon, Gibby.  Need to put some zeros up there early today!"

minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,CentralAmerican,10,Sat Jun 27 18:07:44 2015 UTC,YESTERDAY DIDN'T HAPPEN
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,DayToDayInFlipFlops,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:44:00 2015 UTC,Let's stop the Brewers from brewing up another win.
minnesotatwins,3bbiu3,kaiserj1982,4,Sat Jun 27 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"Another ex-Twin, Matt Garza on the mound today. 5-pitch RHP. Four-seamer and sinker both can get up to 95-96 mph, combined for 66% of his usage. There's also a slider 84-88 mph used 19% and a curve 72-76 mph used 13%. There's also a rarely used change-up he throws 83-87 mph used 2%.  Left-handers see the curveball a lot more than righties, also see a bit more of the four-seamer and sinker. Slider is used mostly with two strikes at 20%, and he loves using the curve first pitch at 28%. Lefties whiff on the slider 19.57%, and whiff on the change and curve a little more than 10%. Four-seamer has a 11% GB percentage, but also a high LD percentage at 8.3%. Lefties are hitting .296/ slugging .519 against the four-seamer (5 HR), .380/.520 vs. the sinker, and then struggle against the slider and curve, batting .100/.200 and .111/.111 respectively.  Right-handers see the slider a ton more (30% vs. 7%), and all other pitch usages go down. Whenever Garza is ahead or with two strikes, expect the slider as he's thrown it 43-46%. Slider has a whiff percentage of 15.71%, and the slider and sinker have good GB percentages of over 12%. Four-seamer is being hit .292/slugging .446, sinker is .289/.442, and slider .281/.422. In only 9 ABs ending in the curve, righties are hitting .667/1.444.  On the season, Garza is 4-9 with a 5.48 ERA (4.78 FIP), 63 strikeouts (23 via slider, 17 via four-seam, 13 via sinker) to 29 walks in 87 IP. His WHIP is the highest since 2007 (his last year as a Twin), H/9 highest since 2006, and HR/9 highest ever. He has one start against the Twins this year which was his second best start of the season, going 7 IP, giving up 6 H and 1 R.  Twins lineup vs. Matt Garza -  Dozier: 3 for 9, 2 doubles, 1 HR, 1 K  Rosario: 2 for 3, 1 double  Mauer: 4 for 6, 2 doubles, 1 K  Plouffe: 0 for 9, 2 K  Hunter: 4 for 10, 1 HR, 2 K  Herrmann: 0 for 4, 1 BB, 3 K  Escobar: 0 for 3  Gibson: 1 for 2, 1 K  Santana: 1 for 6, 2 K"

minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,slingen,5,Sat Jun 27 21:12:50 2015 UTC,Maybe. I literally just made it today. Dibs.
minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,novafire08,4,Sat Jun 27 21:14:17 2015 UTC,Ha. I made mine yesterday expecting a win last night...  Nice work though. We think alike.
minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,slingen,3,Sat Jun 27 22:04:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, someone mentioned that commercial in the game thread today and linked it, so I went to make the gif. Great minds!"

minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,totally_cereal14,2,Sun Jun 28 06:21:56 2015 UTC,I feel like this would be immensely improved if Carlton was included
minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,TOPGEAR1992,9,Sat Jun 27 21:08:57 2015 UTC,I love how much Torii is a part of the twins success this year
minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,Teddy_GOATwater,7,Sat Jun 27 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"Ill be honest: I hated the signing. I thought it was a last ditch effort by the Pohlad's to get fans in the stands. And I still think it is. But damnit, Torii is contributing like no other player and I think the Chemistry he brings to the clubhouse is helping more than we could know."
minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,FlannelBeard,3,Sat Jun 27 21:13:06 2015 UTC,"I think his signing was less about his hitting and production (though I am sure they hoped he would be able to produce offensively and defensively) and it was more about his leadership and seeing how much chemistry he could bring to this team. To me, those two things (leadership and chemistry) are something that this team really lacked last season, in my opinion.   I was confused by this signing, but as the season started and we heard about all the dance parties and what not, I realized that he could bring those two things to this team and it made a little more sense."
minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,ddn4t,7,Sun Jun 28 02:47:34 2015 UTC,Time for another series win tomorrow!   Playoff Push Information:  Wins Goal: 23/75  Wins Needed: 52  Games Remaining: 88  Tracked since 5/9/15 vs. CLE  Record since 5/9/15: 22-20-1  Overall Record: 40-34  LGT!!!

minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,BrianDoziersHair,2,Sun Jun 28 02:55:17 2015 UTC,I was really taking a nap.
minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,kaiserj1982,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:49:46 2015 UTC,"I believe you, but I hope this teaches you not to take naps during a Twins game. :P"
minnesotatwins,3bc8h5,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sun Jun 28 05:02:01 2015 UTC,That was a really good win. Huzzah!

minnesotatwins,3b8zz4,Kripzo,2,Sat Jun 27 01:18:00 2015 UTC,I bet the baseball is radio controlled by some devious Brewers elite hacker.   Probably on a cheese high or something.

minnesotatwins,3b8zz4,d00dsm00t,2,Sat Jun 27 01:12:47 2015 UTC,This is worse than Father's Day. At least I'm not at this game. :/ Time to put the stein to use.
minnesotatwins,3b8zz4,50in15,2,Sat Jun 27 01:12:31 2015 UTC,I was at the Father's Day game...and the whole Brewers series. I have no luck :(

minnesotatwins,3b8zz4,50in15,7,Sat Jun 27 01:27:02 2015 UTC,"Here the Twins are, playing the team that they traded one CF to, using both pitchers that they got when they traded two other CFs, on the day when the CF of the future got put on the DL.   BRB, going to go cry for a while."
minnesotatwins,3b8zz4,tennisspears,6,Sat Jun 27 01:11:45 2015 UTC,I'm switching to straight whiskey.  At this rate I'm going to pass out by the 5th inning.

minnesotatwins,3b72i4,SplurgingSpurgeon,3,Fri Jun 26 15:14:38 2015 UTC,If you don't rest it to complete health a sprain like that will never heal.  I imagine the month is just molitor being vague since any timeframe at this point is little more than a guess.

minnesotatwins,3b72i4,Kripzo,2,Fri Jun 26 14:31:20 2015 UTC,It's worth mentioning that Santana played CF for Rochester on Tuesday.
minnesotatwins,3b72i4,The_Swiss_Mistress,3,Fri Jun 26 14:36:16 2015 UTC,In my opinion he was a better CF when he played there last year than SS.  edit: which really isn't saying all that much

But I still think he will turn out to be a good player, he needed that time in AAA to get some kind of confidence back, and right now, the Brewers are the ultimate confidence builder in MLB (just forget that series we had with them earlier this season)."

minnesotatwins,3b72i4,Kruse,4,Fri Jun 26 14:40:47 2015 UTC,Did it when he was caught stealing on Tuesday.
minnesotatwins,3b72i4,MNpacker6,-2,Fri Jun 26 14:45:19 2015 UTC,He needs to learn how to better control his arms and hands when running. He flails and swings them around too much--it's no wonder this happened.
minnesotatwins,3b72i4,kuj4k,0,Fri Jun 26 14:51:54 2015 UTC,How would that lead to a sprained thumb though?

minnesotatwins,3b72i4,taffyowner,0,Fri Jun 26 14:26:03 2015 UTC,I wonder if this is a genuine injury or a move to get his hitting form back.

minnesotatwins,3b72i4,NotPercyChuggs,-4,Fri Jun 26 22:22:21 2015 UTC,so essentially we're batting 8 guys tonight. Sounds like a plan.
minnesotatwins,3b72i4,cadderly09,4,Fri Jun 26 15:45:50 2015 UTC,They were batting essentially 8 guys anyways because of pitchers hitting

They're just a more active sub, or they were more interested in it.  Yes, you could vote as many times as you wanted, but that doesn't mean people did that. I turned off the option to take the survey again from the 'survey submitted' page, so that probably limited it. Why don't you think this is accurate?"
minnesotatwins,3b7l5b,Kruse,8,Fri Jun 26 19:29:58 2015 UTC,Because you can vote an unlimited amount of times...and we all know KC folks love to vote more than their fair share.

There are also some pretty close pitches called balls to righties, and one AWFUL ball call right in the middle of the zone, all when Sale was pitching: http://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/cache/fastmap.php-pitchSel=all&game=gid_2015_06_24_chamlb_minmlb_1&sp_type=3&s_type=7&cache=1.gif"
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,3,Wed Jun 24 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"This is some pretty insane home scoring, though. They've given Sale all 6 earned runs."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,spin8x,2,Wed Jun 24 19:03:55 2015 UTC,"It depends on how the inning ends. If Sale can get these next two batters out, one of them will be changed to unearned, maybe even two (because Vargas is slow as shit and probably would still be on third right now without the error)."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:05:30 2015 UTC,Really? I thought it only depended on what had happened up until that point.
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,spin8x,2,Wed Jun 24 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"No, even though there's the whole butterfly effect logic, the scorer still considers future outs and backtracks the inning as if the error had not been made to determine what runs are earned and unearned."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,2,Wed Jun 24 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"One of them changed to unearned, btw.  6.2 IP, 8 H, 6 R, 5 ER, 1 BB, 10 K.  3 of his 4 worst starts this season is now against Minnesota."

minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,50in15,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:59:23 2015 UTC,I think they scored it as a single and an error that put him on third.
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,novafire08,2,Wed Jun 24 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"Right, I just meant he made it to third base because of that error. Not a proper triple."

minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,2,Wed Jun 24 18:59:26 2015 UTC,Suga Shane with the RBI double single/error!
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,DetectiveWoofles,3,Wed Jun 24 18:58:13 2015 UTC,I think Buxton would have been home and napping by the time Suzuki reached 2nd there.
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,50in15,2,Wed Jun 24 18:55:01 2015 UTC,Let Hughes pitch through 8 or pull him for a set up guy?
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,FlannelBeard,3,Wed Jun 24 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"At this point, let him pitch. He's on right now - and not too many pitches (even after that big K). He'll go for the 8th and Perkpatine for the 9th."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,audiocranium,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:50:45 2015 UTC,My guess is have a guy warm in the pen in case Hughes goes south quick but let him handle it for now
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,FlannelBeard,3,Wed Jun 24 18:53:02 2015 UTC,I'm not exactly confident in the Twins bullpen (except Perkins) right now.
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:50:14 2015 UTC,Even Perkins has been unreliable a few games.  Some great defense has saved him a few times.

minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,FlannelBeard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"Little nervous about Boyer. Ever since he had to pitch the 10th he's looked a little shaky. So, you know, twice - but still."

minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,vagrantwade,5,Wed Jun 24 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure he was arguing. He knew he was toast. It looked like he asked a question, as the ump was nodding his head as he talked and walked."

minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,2,Wed Jun 24 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Didn't say anything about Ramirez stopping a tough grounder with a nice slide, or anything about the throw. Just suddenly, after the play was over: ""Gonna be an error...on Ramirez""  Good job by Mauer to leg it out regardless."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,50in15,2,Wed Jun 24 18:39:48 2015 UTC,"They mentioned that Ramirez went for a slide ""for whatever reason"", implying that he didn't need to (he most likely didn't, could've stayed on his feet), and also said that the throw was high because of it.   If you've been watching the Sox recently, Alexei has been an absolute mess out in the field (and at the plate), so it's added frustration of another play that wasn't made.  Not sure what more you want."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:44:56 2015 UTC,"I absolutely heard nothing during the play, I swear. If they said all that stuff after, I believe you, but I was just really confused by dead air when the ball is in play. I will admit I'm just used to Dick's pretty thorough pacing, and probably whining more than I should. And I know Ramirez has been having a tough time. Thanks."

Today the best pitcher in baseball is on the mound and it's gonna be a long hard day at the plate for your boys. You just caught the Sox at the wrong time. The South Side Revival continues.   Sox-6 Twins-0 (Sale CG 1 Hitter)  Take care. Enjoy the game. God bless.   -Petey Peppers
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:00:18 2015 UTC,The best pitcher in baseball got six runs hung on him today.  Here's your south side revival.
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,novafire08,-2,Wed Jun 24 19:11:17 2015 UTC,It certainly wasn't his day. There still isn't a better pitcher in the game. It isn't even close. God bless.
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:18:32 2015 UTC,"He's definitely top 5, but I don't think you can say ""it isn't even close"" when saying he is the best pitcher in the game. Scherzer, Kershaw, Felix, and Sale all could stake claim to the title of being the best in the game right now."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:33:23 2015 UTC,And Keuchel
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"As good as Keuchel has been this year and last year, I put him just below those other four right now, just because his track record is a little bit too short right now. If he pitches as well in the upcoming second half as he has in the first half, he will probably be a top candidate to join that top group."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,-5,Fri Jun 26 15:47:30 2015 UTC,Chris Sale is the best pitcher in Major League Baseball. Bottom line. I don't care who is close. He is the best by quite a wide margin.
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"lol okay  I just said he very well could be the best in the game, since I included him in my list. But it isn't by a wide margin at all. Sale is very, very good, but those other 3 are also very, very good."
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,tennisspears,-9,Wed Jun 24 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"The only arm in this league I consider to even be close to Sale is Rodon. It's the number one reason we will be dominating this division for the next ten years. Enjoy today's win. Sale, Shark, Rodon, and Quintana are the best rotation in baseball. Abreau is the best hitter. The Chicago White Sox are pound for pound the best team. It'll play itself out over the coming years, but this is a dynasty in the making."

I need to be in Winsted by 5:15 and am wondering if I'll be able to stay the duration of the game. Sale is pretty quick. Also, anyone by chance have any idea how long it'll take to get to Winsted from here?  Thanks!"
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Wed Jun 24 16:46:45 2015 UTC,Winsted's about an hour from downtown without traffic.

minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:00:25 2015 UTC,"Chris Sale on the mound for the White Sox today. Dominant 4-pitch LHP. Four-seamer can get up to 97-98 mph, used 43% of the time, he also has a sinker a couple mph slower used 12%. Sale has a circle change at 83-87 mph used 30%, and then the slider: http://fat.gfycat.com/InsidiousCelebratedArrowcrab.webm 78-82 mph, used 15%.  Against lefties, he uses that slider 20% more than against RHH, and hitters see a lot less of the circle change. Four-seamer gets ahead of batters, uses the change when he runs into trouble in the counts, and then puts hitters away with either the slider or blow a fastball by them when they're expecting slider. LHH are hitting .118 against the fastball, .118 against the slider, and .556 against the change-up this season, combining for one XBH (a double from Joe Mauer). He's given up 9 hits to LHH, 5 walks, a HBP, and 19 strikeouts.  Right-handers see more of the change, sinker, and four-seamer to make up for less slider, and with two strikes, it's a split of 50% four-seamer, 28% change, and 19% slider. The sinker comes in most commonly on first pitch and when he's even in the count. RHH are hitting .173 against the four-seamer, .142 against the change, .275 against the slider, and .370 against the sinker. Sale has given up a lot more XBH against righties this season, 7 (4 doubles, 3 HR) in 3 starts against the Twins, 19 XBH in total.  Whiff numbers are fantastic - 21.45% from the change-up, 18.72% from the slider, and 17.17% from the four-seamer.  On the season, Sale is 6-3 with a 2.74 ERA (2.23 FIP), 119 K to 20 BB in 88.2 IP. His FIP, WHIP, K/9, and K/BB are currently the best in his career. Against the Twins this season, he's 1-2 including his worst start of the season by far in late-April, going 3.0 IP, giving up 9 H, 9 R (8 ER). He also lost the last time against the Twins, going 8.0 IP, giving up 5 H, 4 R (3 ER), and striking out ten. He's had a streak since then of striking out at least a dozen in his last 5 starts.  Twins lineup vs. Chris Sale -   Buxton: Never faced  Dozier: 8 for 29, 2 doubles, 3 HR, 1 BB, 9 K  Mauer: 8 for 27, 2 doubles, 1 BB, 7 K  Hunter: 10 for 37, 2 doubles, 1 triple, 2 HR, 1 BB, 11 K  Plouffe: 9 for 30, 1 double, 3 BB, 9 K  Nunez: 3 for 15, 2 doubles, 1 HR, 2 K  Suzuki: 5 for 16, 1 double, 2 BB, 2 K  Vargas: 1 for 5, 1 double, 3 K  Robinson: 2 for 8, 1 K"
minnesotatwins,3ayuo7,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed Jun 24 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, I can't complain about a few of those numbers (the vs the Twins numbers, not Sale's season numbers). Odd that he has struggled with the Twins this year, but hopefully the struggles continue today."

minnesotatwins,3axctf,slingen,4,Wed Jun 24 07:01:39 2015 UTC,It's weird to think that the Expos were still around when Torii came into the league.
minnesotatwins,3axctf,candycaneforestelf,2,Wed Jun 24 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"They were still around when Joe Mauer came into the league, iirc. Didn't they move in 2005?"
minnesotatwins,3axctf,slingen,3,Thu Jun 25 14:59:11 2015 UTC,I know the Nats are wearing 10 year anniversary patches this year so that sounds about right.

A bunch of players are available at certain times throughout the week for autograph sessions as well.   On the day of the ""Futures"" game (the day before the HR Derby), there was the celebrity softball game and the mascot softball game on the field beforehand.   EDIT: a quick look at the MLB All Star webpage has a list of events on the right hand side. Looks like the Gatorade All-Star Workout Day at Great American Ball Park is before the HR Derby on Monday, in addition to the FanFest at the Convention Center all day.   I'd recommend taking at least a half day and visiting the FanFest. The HoF exhibit is worth it by itself."

minnesotatwins,3aukic,MINNYTWINS,15,Tue Jun 23 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"The thing Buxton has that Gallo and Bryant don't is his immense defensive upside. Those hard swinging prospects might get their team 50+ runs a season, but Buxton might prevent 50+ runs a season, as well as get on base just as often. Rosario-Buxton-Hicks could be one of the best defensive outfields in the next few years. So much speed, good field positioning, and obviously Buxton has an arm on him."
minnesotatwins,3aukic,Kripzo,8,Tue Jun 23 17:08:58 2015 UTC,Hicks has an amazing arm too. Remember when he threw out some yankee who was trying for a triple? Right-center wall to third base on the fly.
minnesotatwins,3aukic,pman5595,7,Tue Jun 23 17:23:39 2015 UTC,Both Buxton and Hicks hit the upper 90s as high schoolers. Both have great arms.
minnesotatwins,3aukic,kvothe,8,Tue Jun 23 17:26:42 2015 UTC,That throw from CF was clocked at 93+ mph. Looked fucking effortless too.

minnesotatwins,3aukic,kvothe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:36:34 2015 UTC,That fact is what makes me think Hicks is the Twins emergency position player who can pitch...

minnesotatwins,3aukic,Nowin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:55:52 2015 UTC,"I'll give you a better fact to support it: the reason Hicks fell to the Twins (and he did fall) was because everyone ahead of us who was interested in drafting him wanted to draft him as a pitcher, but he wanted to play CF and the Twins were the first team willing to ""let"" him."

minnesotatwins,3aukic,taffyowner,2,Thu Jun 25 19:20:12 2015 UTC,Rosario's no slouch with his Howitzer either. He's gunned down at least two different players this year.
minnesotatwins,3aukic,Jorgenstern8,5,Wed Jun 24 05:48:44 2015 UTC,"Huh, I hadn't thought of it that way but you are absolutely right. Should be fun to watch."
minnesotatwins,3aukic,Taub-NUT,3,Tue Jun 23 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"This could be the Golden Era for the Twins. Our outfield prospects look amazing, we are stacked with great hitting prospects at 1st and 3rd, Dozier is one of the best 2nd basemen in the league... If Santana grows into his potential as a starting SS and we pick up a good catcher, the team has a bright future."
minnesotatwins,3aukic,Kripzo,3,Tue Jun 23 18:15:54 2015 UTC,Trade for Tulo :)  Please please please please I came.
minnesotatwins,3aukic,audiocranium,3,Tue Jun 23 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"I totally want Tulo, even if his contract is awful. But my thinking is, he might not command that much in return because of the contract, and we could trade him  to another contender next year or the year after when we figure something cheaper out. So long as he's healthy all that time....  Also because we're both insane."
minnesotatwins,3aukic,LoveCommittinSins,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"Hell no. We have too many affordable SS's as is. Either Nunez or Santana will pan out pretty quickly here, and even if they don't, I'd have been ecstatic about having an Eduardo Escobar at SS anytime between 1992-2013."
minnesotatwins,3aukic,hail_termite_queen,3,Thu Jun 25 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"Starting pitching is the main question mark, in my opinion. We do not have a true ace or anything close to one in the upper minors now that Meyer has fizzled out a bit. My hope is Berrios can be great, but I don't think he will be a true ace. Beyond that, there isn't much. Hu and Gonsalves don't really have the upside with the stuff they possess."
minnesotatwins,3aukic,Kripzo,3,Tue Jun 23 19:29:27 2015 UTC,"What I've never understood is how the Twins front office has always been good picking up outfield talent, but seem to be clueless when acquiring pitchers. Nolasco, May, and Santana aren't exactly world-beaters. There are a few MLB aces becoming free agents next year, so hopefully we can get Nolasco off the books to free up room for a real pitcher like Cueto."

minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,TOPGEAR1992,2,Wed Jun 24 02:15:00 2015 UTC,I am okay with the decision to keep Pelf in. The guy has a sub 3.00 this season
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Wed Jun 24 02:11:33 2015 UTC,"And the other option was Aaron Thompson, who gave up 4 ER without getting an out his last time on the mound."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tokomini,-1,Wed Jun 24 02:15:37 2015 UTC,Why the hell did they leave Pelf in. His pitch count was ridiculous and he wasn't even doing well.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,Kripzo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:09:34 2015 UTC,Seems like a play Nunez should have made.

minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tenthreeleader,3,Wed Jun 24 01:44:46 2015 UTC,"Hawk is just ripping Alexei Ramirez to shreds right now, 3 minutes after his at bat."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tokomini,3,Wed Jun 24 01:42:07 2015 UTC,Those are some low strikes.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,polamity,6,Wed Jun 24 01:29:46 2015 UTC,Anyone notice this catcher throws the ball back like he's in little league?
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,SplurgingSpurgeon,6,Wed Jun 24 01:28:45 2015 UTC,Dick and Bert were talking about that last night. Something about a mental block makes him throw it like that.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,kaiserj1982,4,Wed Jun 24 01:33:54 2015 UTC,"He has a mental block, they covered it last night, I guess he just cant mentally throw it back to the mound."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tcarr31,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:33:29 2015 UTC,Makes sense. But it's also amazing that it's possible to be a professional athlete without being able to overcome a small thing like that. Clearly he has more than the average amount of body control and self discipline if he's playing in the Majors.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,polamity,2,Wed Jun 24 01:37:13 2015 UTC,"Its also amazing that Charles Barkley can't swing a golf club, but some athletes just get a mental block or ""the yips"" and its very hard to overcome."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tcarr31,2,Wed Jun 24 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"Look up Mackey Sasser. Was just a normal catcher until a home plate collision. After that, he would always double clutch on his throws back to the mound. He could throw down to second on a steal attempt, but couldn't throw back to the pitcher. Such a bizarre story.   Edit: Here's a 30 for 30 short video. http://grantland.com/features/30-for-30-shorts-fields-of-fear/"
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tennisspears,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:41:35 2015 UTC,So he's pretty much the baseball equivalent of Charles Barkley's golf swing then?  Weird
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,TOPGEAR1992,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:44:43 2015 UTC,That's a real thing?!?!...I thought that was just a joke from major league II
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,TonguePunchnFartBoxs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:35:52 2015 UTC,My guess is bad knees and not the best arm strength. Takes a lot of arm to toss it back while remaining crouched. The lunge forward is weird though.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,FlannelBeard,4,Wed Jun 24 01:32:52 2015 UTC,"As a former little league catcher, I resent that comparison."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,polamity,5,Wed Jun 24 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah. He lurches and falls forward each time."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tokomini,3,Wed Jun 24 01:31:37 2015 UTC,Yeah.....my poor knees would say fuck no to that after about 3 pitches.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,AdaAstra,2,Wed Jun 24 01:30:53 2015 UTC,"Last time Pelf pitched vs. the SOX was the game he couldn't finish five innings (despite having a nice lead) because he kept nailing their hitters. I was at that game, people were so confused."

minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,AdaAstra,5,Wed Jun 24 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"Took a perfect throw, Samardzija has been dealing and Vargas was due up next."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tokomini,4,Wed Jun 24 01:21:05 2015 UTC,"Our 3rd base coach has been pretty smart so far this season about when to send a runner, so I'm not complaining about this one time."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,Tannekr,3,Wed Jun 24 01:20:11 2015 UTC,Well at least we scored.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,DetectiveWoofles,2,Wed Jun 24 01:18:10 2015 UTC,"Odd choice to grab that ball. Might as well see if it goes foul, because he had no shot at getting him at first."

minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,Tannekr,2,Wed Jun 24 01:04:31 2015 UTC,Pelf is slinging it tonight. Hitting 96.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tennisspears,2,Wed Jun 24 01:03:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, we've seen the strike zone now boys. Swing if it's close."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tokomini,2,Wed Jun 24 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, big zone tonight. At least it has been that way for both sides so far, according to BrooksBaseball."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,tennisspears,6,Wed Jun 24 01:01:09 2015 UTC,The Sox probably have the worst tv announcers I've heard. It's like they don't even care.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,flopperazzi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:56:25 2015 UTC,I said this last night but too late for anyone to see:   I'm pretty sure he's a big reason for the perpetual problem of Sox fans being so fair-weather. I mean it's absolutely no fun to watch your team play when even the announcer doesn't want to be there. At least when the Twins are bad we can still feel like our friends Dick and Bert are there for us in the long run and we can still enjoy watching for the love of the game and hope for better days ahead. When the White Sox lose it's the end of the world and they might as well just move the team to Topeka.
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,polamity,0,Wed Jun 24 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"It's like that one kid in elementary school gym glass. If their team didn't win that days game of kickball, they'd actually cry."
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,kaiserj1982,3,Wed Jun 24 01:35:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I would agree. They barely even talked passed the 7th inning last night because they knew it was over. Super depressing if you ask me.

minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,flopperazzi,2,Wed Jun 24 01:04:00 2015 UTC,So Buxton has his best game yesterday leading off and he's back to batting 9th! Not throwing a fit but anyone have a reason as to why Buxton was dropped back down?
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,uponplane,6,Wed Jun 24 00:53:09 2015 UTC,This has been asked and answered at least once in the thread already.

minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,uponplane,3,Wed Jun 24 00:58:07 2015 UTC,Sox tv announcers are getting pissed about the strike zone.

I do predict a shark attack though. He's ready to go!  Sox-3 Twins-2   Should be a gem tonight. God bless.   -Petey Peppers
minnesotatwins,3aw3jp,Petey_Peppers,3,Wed Jun 24 00:45:59 2015 UTC,"Shark is a much better pitcher than Danks, so I don't think it will be a blowout. Pelfrey is a guy that will either (manage to) dominate or be dominated.    I think I'll call 4-3 Twins, with us scoring 3 against Shark and 1 against your bullpen. Pelfrey gives up 3 in 6.    Good luck and enjoy the game!"

I can't stand the White Sox, I am not fond of the Beisbolcats, I completely forget about the Indians, but I feel kinship with the Twins. They are a constantly underrated team that somehow makes it. The Royals are now that underrated team that is making it. When the league was trying to figure out what teams to contract the Royals and the Twins were always on the chopping block. Somehow both teams made it out of those years pretty much everyone else would have been okay seeing them moved or gone. When I say Twinsbros (in jest) I have a lot of admiration for the fans and the team."

That said, I rooted for them last year in the playoffs, because I like them more than the Tigers/Sox/Indians and the other playoff teams from last year.  But they're a division rival, and we're in second place in the division, so  fuck no they're not my bros."

minnesotatwins,3asdj8,MN_hydroplane,21,Tue Jun 23 15:30:09 2015 UTC,Buxton with 3 hits. This. I like this. Now give me Sano
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,Charburble,16,Tue Jun 23 03:13:50 2015 UTC,Vargas might have something to say about that after tonight's game. Hopefully this gets him going.
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,tennisspears,8,Tue Jun 23 03:14:50 2015 UTC,I know Molitor can find a spot for Sano. Imagine having him alongside Vargas if he keeps this up.
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,Charburble,4,Tue Jun 23 03:15:48 2015 UTC,Send Herrmann down and Sano up?  I don't know why they're so keen to play him all the time.  He can play a lot of different positions but his hitting is florimon-esque
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,TOPGEAR1992,11,Tue Jun 23 03:19:44 2015 UTC,Herrmann plays in place for Suzuki. I dont think they'd put Sano in at catcher.
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,Charburble,3,Tue Jun 23 03:22:53 2015 UTC,"Forgot we're thin at catcher.  I'd like to see Sano but unless Plouffe really starts struggling I don't know who would go down, and I don't think Plouffe will struggle.  Everyone is playing pretty solid and I don't think we need to rush him up but seeing him and Buxton playing would be fun to see"
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,TOPGEAR1992,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:29:39 2015 UTC,To be honest Sano will probably end up in RF before too long anyways.
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,Capn_Barboza,5,Tue Jun 23 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"They can't just send Herrmann down. They need a back-up catcher.   And no, Joe Mauer is not an option for that and never again will be."

minnesotatwins,3asdj8,Jorgenstern8,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:47:24 2015 UTC,I'd rather wait until there is a legitimate spot for him to fill. It's not good to bring up guys from the minors and give them inconsistent at bats.

minnesotatwins,3asdj8,handsy_pilot,3,Tue Jun 23 03:33:55 2015 UTC,Games like that are fun to watch.  Buxton definitely looked nice tonight as the leadoff.  Vargas needs to continue swinging with confidence.
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,J-Hal,3,Tue Jun 23 03:18:51 2015 UTC,Four knocks and a solid effort.  That's more like it.   Must admit that with his struggles I probably wouldn't have led off Buxton.  Looks like the manager has his mojo back after last night too.
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,tenthreeleader,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:18:01 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm sure most of Buxton struggles come from hitting in the 9 hole... He probably is the type of guy who enjoys the pressure and the rewards of getting on base... As opposed to hitting with 2 outs and no one on in the 9 hole.
minnesotatwins,3asdj8,Capn_Barboza,4,Tue Jun 23 14:20:45 2015 UTC,"""I like how everybody thinks Vargas has turned it around after he goes 4 for 4 with 4 RBI and 2 runs."""

minnesotatwins,3ashow,polamity,4,Tue Jun 23 07:03:16 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, I don't think they could afford to keep him. Twins were very (very) small market back in those days."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,imissedthetoilet,3,Tue Jun 23 14:43:20 2015 UTC,"No, Ortiz just sucked when he was on the Twins. And he was always hurt. Terry Ryan tried to trade him but no one wanted him. Boston got lucky when the signed him."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,wstrauss,0,Tue Jun 23 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"This. I remember watching him when he was on the team thinking ""wtf this guy sucks"". He did nothing for us. Critics say he wasn't ""coached"" right, or that the twins were trying to do too much to his swing etc. But he was shit with us, Boston just told him to swing for the fences at all times I'd guess lol"
minnesotatwins,3ashow,DemonRapier,2,Tue Jun 23 23:40:35 2015 UTC,"Ortiz hit 18 and 20 home runs his last 2 years with the Twins. I wouldn't go so far as to say he ""sucked"".....I just looked it up and it says the Twins released him after 2002 and the Red Sox ""only"" paid him $1.25 million in 2003.  Obviously bad move Twins. But the Twins were still penny-pinching in those days and certainly played a factor in the decision to release him, I'm sure."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,imissedthetoilet,2,Wed Jun 24 03:35:18 2015 UTC,Ok fair points. I just tell myself this so I don't feel as bad
minnesotatwins,3ashow,DemonRapier,6,Wed Jun 24 04:37:17 2015 UTC,"DHing is hard, he's young, I've no problem giving him lots of time."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,CantaloupeCamper,4,Tue Jun 23 14:05:35 2015 UTC,"Vargas got moved up the ranks pretty quickly. He spent 2013 playing high-A ball and started last year at AA before making his debut at the Major League level. Growing pains at the Major League level shouldn't come as a surprise, but I'm pretty excited about him."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,imissedthetoilet,4,Tue Jun 23 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"Another poster mentioned a platoon with Arcia...have we not learned enough that it's important to be patient with prospects and let them struggle and figure things out?  Baseball prospects aren't like other sports prospects.  Even Bryce Harper took 2-3 years to start to reach where people thought he would be.  Both these guys are 24 and we've already got some fans trying to relagate them to platoon DH roles?  Wow.  Arcia has played 455 minor league games, hit .309 with a .901 OPS.  And he can crush the ball and hit it hard...out of his 523 career minor league hits 121 have been 2Bers, 25 3Bers, and 69 HRs to go along with 272 runs and 318 RBIs.    So yeah, that's a guy who's average 162 game pace is hitting about .310...97 runs 43 2b 9 3b 25 HR 113 RBIs for his minor league career averages.  He's played just over a full season of MLB time too and he's only 24.  (219 games).  His 162 game averages would be 24 2B 4 3B 27 HR 80 RBI .243 AVG .741 OPS and he's still only 24.  Oh yeah and he was on pace for a .250 avg .750 OPS 32 HR 90 RBI last season at 23 in the majors at 23.  All of that is pretty good.  Future lineup 2-3 years from now should definitely look something like:  CF Buxton 2B Dozier 3B Miguel Sano RF/DH Oswaldo Arcia  1B/DH Kenny Vargas DH/RF/1B Adam Walker LF Eddie Rosario SS Nick Gordon"
minnesotatwins,3ashow,Cheehos,4,Tue Jun 23 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"I like Vargas, but it's sometimes a bit hard to watch him hit from the left side.  He's far too young to give up on him being an everyday type player, but I don't think one could argue against the value a two-headed DH monster of Arcia and Vargas could bring.  If Arcia only sees righties, he's an .807 OPS guy, and Vargas would be a .915 OPS hitter.   Again, it's way too early in their careers to limit them to platoon roles, but these are the kinds of numbers you look at if we get to a one game playoff."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,kaiserj1982,3,Tue Jun 23 15:08:34 2015 UTC,Arcia can spend the rest of the season in AAA.
minnesotatwins,3ashow,taffyowner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"I would go farther and say he can go away, our outfield is more set and he's blocked at DH by someone who doesn't swing at shit pitches"

minnesotatwins,3ashow,Kruse,4,Tue Jun 23 12:48:34 2015 UTC,"According to you, the entire team is a mirage."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,RobertService,-1,Tue Jun 23 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"That guy was cherry picking. The real Vargas is getting on base at .283 and slugging .379 for -0.3 WAR. Pretty impressive for a guy that can't field any position, huh?"
minnesotatwins,3ashow,hail_termite_queen,3,Tue Jun 23 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Talk about cherry picking...you're using Vargas' stats this year, where he was inexplicably sent down right as he started hitting and has less than 150 AB? You saw yesterday what he can do, and he had a 115 OPS+ last year in more at bats as a rookie. His minor league numbers are impressive and show much more patience. How can you watch him crush balls as hard as I've ever seen and not acknowledge the potential? They guy doesn't even have 500 MLB ABs yet."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,Kripzo,2,Tue Jun 23 20:51:24 2015 UTC,"You can still be a great player without being the next Ortiz. I don't think a lot of guys in the bottom of the order go 4/4 with a home run. His plate discipline has improved enormously this season, and he has always had power. If he continues to read the game well, his average, RBI's, and HR's will all get better."
minnesotatwins,3ashow,RobertService,-4,Tue Jun 23 13:56:51 2015 UTC,Anybody could go 4/4 with a HR in one game. Anybody. Even pitchers.
minnesotatwins,3ashow,Kripzo,2,Tue Jun 23 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"But did you pay attention to all the stats listed in this thread? A 4/4 performance isn't just a random event, he has been playing well for a while now. Go ahead and be a Debbie downer if you want, tough guy ;)"
minnesotatwins,3ashow,Kripzo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't worry guys he's right...we should judge Vargas based off of a 17 game slump spanning all of about 60 ABs to start the season for the first time on a MLB roster in his career.  Let's ignore the 53 games last year he got called up straight from AA and hit .274 with 10 2Bs 9 HRs 38 RBIs.  (162 games 31 2B 28 HR 114 RBI pace)   Oh and since his struggles in June he's been pretty good, while not even playing at his best.  But you're right.  He's a mirage.   60 abs makes 300+ successful MLB plate appeareances a mirage and also over 1400 minor league ABs."

minnesotatwins,3armfm,AdaAstra,6,Tue Jun 23 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"That was another glorious drubbing of an AL Central rival, 20-6 over the Tigers. I was at that one. Two of the homers were off of Andrew Romine (yes, the shortstop), one an absolute bomb by Arcia that hit 3/4 of the way up the flagpole. I think Escobar and Santana each had one (maybe even back-to-back?) early in the game, and Plouffe had the other one off Romine. Now that I think about it, Plouffe's and Arcia's may have been back-to-back as well."

minnesotatwins,3armfm,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:03:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They just need to be better offensively against good pitching if they want to contend. Personally, I don't see them making the playoffs, but prob finish a few games over .500."

minnesotatwins,3armfm,AdaAstra,3,Tue Jun 23 02:46:01 2015 UTC,He basically just said it's neat and you don't see it much anymore.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,Capitol62,7,Tue Jun 23 02:47:14 2015 UTC,It's so much more exciting watching Twins games with Buxton.  I'm literally waiting until his next at-bat every time to see his speed
minnesotatwins,3armfm,TOPGEAR1992,2,Tue Jun 23 02:40:00 2015 UTC,I saw a video of one of his at- bats the other day. Holy shit he's fast.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,Sageburner127,3,Tue Jun 23 02:45:35 2015 UTC,I don't know if there's a gif but he outran a regular ground ball earlier and the strides he takes running are insane

minnesotatwins,3armfm,tokomini,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:44:28 2015 UTC,I think Buxton's composure will make him a really good player.  Really quick hands and seems to be really focused on the field and doesn't let the pressure rattle him

minnesotatwins,3armfm,AdaAstra,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"Haha ""All Star Omar"" is a running joke over at our sub (and most others, of course). Loved watching the ASG at Target Field last year! My folks are from Minnesota, so y'all have always had almost the same place in my heart as the Royals. Who do you think you'll send to the game this year? Dozier seems pretty good!"
minnesotatwins,3armfm,Sageburner127,2,Tue Jun 23 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, Dozier is fantastic! A shame he could be snubbed from deserving all-star bid because of tomfoolery :("
minnesotatwins,3armfm,Derk-Derks,3,Tue Jun 23 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"Perkins is probably a lock at this point. Dozier is deserving too, but I'm not sure how it will shake out with Altuve or Infante getting voted in and Kipnis probably being the most deserving in the AL. It would be a real shame if he missed it, which is mostly why we are upset about the Infante thing."
minnesotatwins,3armfm,tennisspears,2,Tue Jun 23 02:43:55 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Perkins does seem to be a hell of an arm- was he ever a failed started like Wade Davis? Or has he always been your lock down guy?
minnesotatwins,3armfm,Sageburner127,2,Tue Jun 23 02:49:37 2015 UTC,"He also changed his off season workout routine a few years ago. Rested more, started swimming, and came into camp throwing 4 to 5 mph faster. Coaches thought their radar guns were off."
minnesotatwins,3armfm,gaettisrevenge,3,Tue Jun 23 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"He was a failed starter. Had a 5.06 ERA in 44 career starts, and has a 2.76 career ERA as a reliever."

minnesotatwins,3armfm,Derk-Derks,5,Tue Jun 23 02:58:03 2015 UTC,MLB Tonight actually mentioned the Twins. Harold Reynolds said people need to wake up and see the Twins as a contending team.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,kaiserj1982,2,Tue Jun 23 02:29:59 2015 UTC,That's the smartest thing Harold has ever said
minnesotatwins,3armfm,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,7,Tue Jun 23 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"Oh crap, we have been noticed.  Back to the darkness!"
minnesotatwins,3armfm,AdaAstra,2,Tue Jun 23 02:31:46 2015 UTC,"Well in that case, I should probably watch more of the Twins."
minnesotatwins,3armfm,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 23 02:30:57 2015 UTC,You don't have to tell me twice.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,DetectiveWoofles,2,Tue Jun 23 02:32:45 2015 UTC,So the Twins now own the highest run-disparity of any team against another in MLB with +42. That's fun :)

minnesotatwins,3armfm,Derk-Derks,2,Tue Jun 23 02:23:38 2015 UTC,My buddy actually edits the twin commercials. Glad people enjoy them.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,eemceefarlane,2,Tue Jun 23 02:30:04 2015 UTC,Where are the ones for this year? I can't find any more recent than 2013 on the Twins website.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,novafire08,2,Tue Jun 23 02:36:33 2015 UTC,He has worked for the company for a couple of years so I think he has only done the ones recently.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,eemceefarlane,2,Tue Jun 23 02:43:03 2015 UTC,tell him to bring back the Twins Territory hilarious commercials
minnesotatwins,3armfm,taffyowner,2,Tue Jun 23 02:36:09 2015 UTC,Agreed unfortunately the commercials are decided by the twins PR. His company films and edits I believe.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,eemceefarlane,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:43:44 2015 UTC,Tell him to hire me.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,Derk-Derks,3,Tue Jun 23 02:31:00 2015 UTC,Torii Hunter commercials are worth whatever the Twins pay him

minnesotatwins,3armfm,novafire08,3,Tue Jun 23 02:23:31 2015 UTC,I love listening to depressed Hawk on the Chicago stream.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,mikerowave612,2,Tue Jun 23 02:22:38 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he's a big reason for the perpetual problem of Sox fans being so fair-weather. I mean it's absolutely no fun to watch your team play when even the announcer doesn't want to be there. At least when the Twins are bad we can still feel like our friends Dick and Bert are there for us in the long run and we can still enjoy watching for the love of the game and hope for better days ahead. When the White Sox lose it's the end of the world and they might as well just move the team to Topeka.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,polamity,2,Tue Jun 23 06:55:04 2015 UTC,Me too.

minnesotatwins,3armfm,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 23 02:27:20 2015 UTC,Good problem to have if you're the Twins. I still think Buxton should bunt more and leg out a few singles.   Solution for opposition...possibly creep in the middle infielders.
minnesotatwins,3armfm,doubleflusher,5,Tue Jun 23 02:27:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know if correcting Hawk is the best thing to do right now, Stoney."
minnesotatwins,3armfm,ChiefakaJames,3,Tue Jun 23 02:22:28 2015 UTC,I think that long silence by Hawk after the correction illustrates your point.  I picture Hawk with steam coming out of his ears and giving Stone the death stare.

minnesotatwins,3ar163,kuj4k,15,Mon Jun 22 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"It's been proven that having your best hitter hit second leads to the highest run expectancy. Dozier, with a wRC+ of 135, has been far and away the Twins' best hitter. He should bat second every night."
minnesotatwins,3ar163,kvothe,5,Mon Jun 22 23:22:40 2015 UTC,And our offense has been in a funk lately... changing things can't hurt riiiight?
minnesotatwins,3ar163,Capn_Barboza,5,Mon Jun 22 21:15:53 2015 UTC,I think seeing him in the spot in the lineup he will eventually play in will be good. Thats the thought right 1. Buxton 2. Dozier 3. Sano?
minnesotatwins,3ar163,tcarr31,3,Mon Jun 22 21:47:09 2015 UTC,Idk Sano might be a Clean-up type hitter. Either way 1 and 2 are pretty much how it should be.
minnesotatwins,3ar163,Capn_Barboza,2,Mon Jun 22 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, but we need Joe to get his act together to have him fill that 3 hole. Who knows, maybe go like the old days and 2. Joe and then Dozier could bat 3."
minnesotatwins,3ar163,tcarr31,6,Mon Jun 22 22:15:47 2015 UTC,That'd sure be nice... but I think the concussion changed him; which isn't uncommon... His days of silver slugging are probably over sadly   :( :( :( :(

minnesotatwins,3ar163,deltapenrose,6,Tue Jun 23 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"I think its just to show him we have confidence in him.  He's been batting like he's nervous, he just got his first home hit out of the way, maybe a vote of confidence will give him the boost he needs. Plus with the way Dozier's been batting this year, it doesn't make a lot of sense for him to be batting lead off"
minnesotatwins,3ar163,tcarr31,5,Mon Jun 22 22:43:11 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of Buxton, Mauer, Dozier.  Think about it, even though Mauer isn't walking like he used to he's still not afraid to get deep into an at-bat. The more pitches Buxton sees standing on first base the better read he can get on the pitcher. If he steals it opens up first base giving Mauer a better chance at getting walked, and a worse chance of GDIP. I love the idea of Dozier's extra-base power with runners on. Bonus: Mauer might be one of the smartest baserunners in the game, if the defense is focused on Buxton's speed they might forget about Joe's smarts."
minnesotatwins,3ar163,polamity,3,Tue Jun 23 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, I was saying that earlier today in this thread."
minnesotatwins,3ar163,imissedthetoilet,2,Tue Jun 23 03:14:11 2015 UTC,I like this. I think I trust Joe to get on base and advance the runner more than I trust him to drive in runs and we all know Dozier can clear the bases.
minnesotatwins,3ar163,incredibleridiculous,3,Tue Jun 23 06:34:09 2015 UTC,"This could be the game that gets Buxton going......the hit that he got by beating out the routine grounder to shortstop was absolutely ridiculous. With that kind of speed and the ability to get ""cheap"" hits like that - and the chaos he presents when he does get on base - he is an ideal leadoff hitter. Clearly a huge spark offensively. I think Molly just wanted to bat him 9th to get his feet wet first. Definitely exciting.   And let's not forget what he brings to the table defensively.  Kind of reminds me of Carlos Gomez. Gomez was still raw at the plate when he was with the Twins but Gomez brought an electricity to the Twins with his speed and energy that was palpable (winning run in game 163 baby)."
minnesotatwins,3ar163,incredibleridiculous,3,Tue Jun 23 03:44:05 2015 UTC,Attempt to get his bat going I would say.  He needs to get the home hit out of the way and then we can decide if he is going to stay up for a while or not.
minnesotatwins,3ar163,kaiserj1982,4,Mon Jun 22 20:33:43 2015 UTC,He had a hit last night at home. It would be nice to see him have a multi-hit game.

minnesotatwins,3aqdue,NinjaChachi,3,Mon Jun 22 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"If you go cheap/upper deck get a seat down the third base line (skyline view $22 if you buy through the Twins.) Good view of the game (though a bit far away) and great view of downtown. If you can get them for 40 bucks, Legends Club seats are awesome. I see it's a day game.. do NOT buy seats in the outfield second level. Right, left whatever. They are not great views and get hit with direct sunlight all day with little breeze. I don't see Legends Club listed on the Twins site but if you can find them on stub hub for 40ish (that might be a bit low but worth a look) bucks they are great seats. All on the infield, overhanging the field level and it has an exclusive indoor area with concessions and air conditioning and what not."
minnesotatwins,3aqdue,ClemDeLaClem,2,Mon Jun 22 18:03:36 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of the Legends Club seats -- great advice.
minnesotatwins,3aqdue,dispatch00,3,Mon Jun 22 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"IMO you don't need seats at Target Field. There are beautiful sightlines along every part of the concourse. Not being tied down to a seat means you can wander up to the 2 Gingers pub, or go find the food you want, stand on the home run porch or be within spitting distance of the outfielders any time you want. There are counters along most of the concourse to set your drink and lean on and still watch the game. I only buy standing room seats, or nosebleeders that I never end up actually sitting in, because they're the cheapest. When the Twins aren't doing well, you might pay only $7 per seat.  By the 8th inning, security doesn't care if you have a ticket for a certain section and you can sit wherever you want. If you get tired mid game, you can grab a drink at Town Ball Tavern and take a load off for a half inning. Spend the day walking off all those cheese curds and beer."

minnesotatwins,3aqdue,stuckupinhere,2,Tue Jun 23 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"I would never recommend standing room only tickets. I would, however, recommend you sit in the homerun porch in left field.

minnesotatwins,3amina,Jollyman21,2,Sun Jun 21 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"Well, at least the Royals are getting slaughtered as well."
minnesotatwins,3amina,Khoops66,2,Sun Jun 21 20:47:00 2015 UTC,How long has Mauer had that beard for?  Why am I so hard?
minnesotatwins,3amina,Jollyman21,2,Sun Jun 21 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"He thought it was going to be cold in May, then he realized how badass it is."
minnesotatwins,3amina,polamity,3,Sun Jun 21 18:33:39 2015 UTC,He's a beast too! I thought that last hit was gonna leave the park
minnesotatwins,3amina,The_Poochinski,2,Sun Jun 21 18:35:49 2015 UTC,Since his buddies on the Wild clinched a playoff spot. Or that was his story anyway.
minnesotatwins,3amina,calisto77,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:19:29 2015 UTC,Let's win this series! Wearing my Dozier jersey surrounded by Cubs fans here in northern Chicagoland! GO TWINS
minnesotatwins,3amina,The_Poochinski,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:30:19 2015 UTC,Definitely ballsy man...worse on the south side though...still ballsy

minnesotatwins,3amina,Jollyman21,2,Sun Jun 21 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you, I do not appreciate Anthony Rizzo"
minnesotatwins,3amina,swashbucklerjak,2,Sun Jun 21 19:43:59 2015 UTC,Yea I don't blame ya. It's still close and there's plenty of baseball left!
minnesotatwins,3amina,FlannelBeard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:00:29 2015 UTC,Gibson has thrown a lot of pitches for 4 innings. Is he just having an off day or is this because Hermann doesn't have a lot of experience with the staff?
minnesotatwins,3amina,vagrantwade,2,Sun Jun 21 19:25:29 2015 UTC,Gibson is nibbling the zone a lot today and the ump isn't calling them strikes.
minnesotatwins,3amina,FlannelBeard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:39:58 2015 UTC,I live in Eastern Iowa. If we lose this series to the Cubs I am going to flip out.
minnesotatwins,3amina,DelPennSotan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:42:28 2015 UTC,How did someone from Iowa end up a jags fan?
minnesotatwins,3amina,vagrantwade,2,Sun Jun 21 19:57:47 2015 UTC,Maybe the question is how did a Jags fan end up in Iowa?
minnesotatwins,3amina,vagrantwade,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:07:10 2015 UTC,Because the Iowa Corns isn't an actual NFL team?
minnesotatwins,3amina,y2jayjk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:29:42 2015 UTC,Our hitting has been shit. It's cringe to even watch.
minnesotatwins,3amina,ewok_bukkake,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:30:21 2015 UTC,Meh. Perhaps the Sox will be who gets us back in the groove
minnesotatwins,3amina,i4_D_4_Mi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:32:21 2015 UTC,We better just fucking abuse the White Sox to get back at Chicago for this series
minnesotatwins,3amina,Khoops66,2,Sun Jun 21 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"As a Cubs fan, by all means do just that."

minnesotatwins,3ajhab,elthomas21,3,Sun Jun 21 00:01:00 2015 UTC,I'm afraid that the saves will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

minnesotatwins,3ajhab,Oxyquatzal,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:21:04 2015 UTC,I thought he looked more like an angry lawn gnome.
minnesotatwins,3am46x,yotamonk,9,Sun Jun 21 15:56:24 2015 UTC,I assume it's because the catcher position is the toughest on your body and maybe it's the twins way of keeping him around longer.
minnesotatwins,3am46x,dustinyo_,5,Sun Jun 21 16:26:34 2015 UTC,Catchers normally only play 135-140 games a year. Do that for 6 years and you've saved an entire season's worth of games on their knees.
minnesotatwins,3am46x,CentralAmerican,4,Mon Jun 22 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"Suzuki plays a lot.  Right now he has 189 AB, which is currently 11th out of 30 MLB catchers.  He gets one day off per week or so, usually on day games that follow night games."
minnesotatwins,3am46x,FlannelBeard,0,Mon Jun 22 12:49:48 2015 UTC,I think he may be trying to play through an injury. He's extremely slow running the bases and injuries are fairly common at his position
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,TwinsGameday,2,Sat Jun 20 17:14:49 2015 UTC,"Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.  Good thing there's another game tomorrow.  I'd be looking to get the taste of this one out of their mouths.  Highly winnable game.  Buxton call should have been challenged and wasn't, so an opportunity to win the game was missed.  No guarantee you'd get the call but you have no chance to get the call if you don't try.  Everyone made mistakes today including the manager."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,tenthreeleader,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:48:22 2015 UTC,"Poor base running, poor hitting. But all in all Boyer gave that up. Oh well, you win some you lose some"
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,Slapachimp,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"Bah, base running and bullpen squandered a good outing from May."

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,tenthreeleader,2,Sat Jun 20 21:47:12 2015 UTC,You looking to make friends? Because you're going about it all wrong.

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,50in15,2,Sat Jun 20 21:21:20 2015 UTC,Can't fault Boyer too much on this.  We should have ended this game in the 8th or 9th.  Stupid mistakes in base running...
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,AdaAstra,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"5 hits allowed?   You can blame Boyer,  but you should be blaming Moliter and that very laissez-gardy attitude of just leaving him out there.   After the 3rd single,  you take him out"
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,phernoree,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:23:03 2015 UTC,"Ouch, Blaine. That was actually just a great piece of hitting, but his stuff has been better in 8th innings as of late."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,50in15,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:18:09 2015 UTC,RIP Boyer.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,-1,Sat Jun 20 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"Well, Boyer isn't a major league pitcher. It's no surprise that he's getting lit up finally."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,RobertService,5,Sat Jun 20 21:50:09 2015 UTC,Our baserunning has been pretty embarrassing in this slump.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,50in15,4,Sat Jun 20 21:15:49 2015 UTC,Fucking great.  Yet another great starting pitching performance wasted by stupid mistakes.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,AdaAstra,7,Sat Jun 20 21:13:09 2015 UTC,I'm straight embarrassed about our fans turnout for this game.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,ewok_bukkake,3,Sat Jun 20 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"Not really sure why. They come for a series once every 3 years, they have a pretty large national following, and their triple-A team is in Des Moines. I expect a huge crowd, just like St. Louis."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jun 20 21:21:04 2015 UTC,Someone hold me. :(
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sat Jun 20 21:12:31 2015 UTC,It's crazy how Starlin Castro can be a major league baseball player and yet somehow maintain the physique of a pregnant 14 year old.

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sat Jun 20 21:10:36 2015 UTC,It's not looking good here...
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,-1,Sat Jun 20 21:09:55 2015 UTC,What's good Twins fans?!
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,Jollyman21,8,Sat Jun 20 21:08:20 2015 UTC,What was good yesterday? Didn't see you.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,vagrantwade,2,Sat Jun 20 21:14:17 2015 UTC,I meant to say hello! I'm on my phone and didn't see the lead off hit I swear. What was good yesterday was we got our asses kicked
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,Jollyman21,7,Sat Jun 20 21:50:13 2015 UTC,"You picked the wrong time to come in here, I'll be honest."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,6,Sat Jun 20 21:12:43 2015 UTC,Not a lot at this moment.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,ChiefakaJames,-2,Sat Jun 20 21:10:01 2015 UTC,Or this whole game really.   What can y'all tell me about yalls team this year?
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,Jollyman21,0,Sat Jun 20 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"Well gee cous, we's all been hunky dory down in our own parts. How's y'all Cubbies been doing o'er thurr in ol' Chicago, hey buddy?"
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,innesota2,2,Sat Jun 20 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"Can't tell if you're genuinely curious or just talking trash, but it's really poor form to only show up in another team's sub to gloat when you finally pull ahead. Mods from every baseball subreddit pay close attention to things like this and coordinate for bans, so maybe re-think your appearances."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,50in15,5,Sat Jun 20 21:23:26 2015 UTC,Im not trash talking I swear! I've gone into every team's thread we've played this year and I'm genuinely curious about everyones team. I just wanna learn more. I'm using my phone and catching the game on the MLB app I swear it's just bad timing Im not trying to talk shit haha
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,Jollyman21,3,Sat Jun 20 21:30:18 2015 UTC,"Much better starting pitching than expected, solid back end of bullpen, Dozier the second baseman leads the team in just about every category, and getting younger by playing guys like Rosario, Vargas, and recently Buxton."

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,cadderly09,2,Sat Jun 20 21:06:01 2015 UTC,Is this going to be another Suzuki was our only heavy hitter game?  It is awesome when those happen because it is so unexpected.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 20 21:05:16 2015 UTC,Suzuki gets on for another Vargas walk off chance?
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:05:03 2015 UTC,Dick and that camera angle made it seem long fucking gone...
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,NorseWolves,2,Sat Jun 20 21:04:34 2015 UTC,Dick's excited call of that flyout trolled me so hard.  Thought for sure Plouffe hit that one out.

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,CultureVulture629,2,Sat Jun 20 21:08:08 2015 UTC,Guess Cubs fans are tired of looking at that shit hole they call Wrigley.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,uponplane,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:13:35 2015 UTC,Heh. The only time I ever agreed with Ozzie is when he called Wrigley a dump.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,sexrobot_sexrobot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:27:15 2015 UTC,I live near Chicago and Cubs fans are awful to away fans that cheer. They are my least favorite fanbase.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,The_Poochinski,2,Sat Jun 20 21:16:06 2015 UTC,Yea I went to a game last time Twins were in the north side. The fans were the worst. I've been to both Chicago ballparks with the Twins visiting and the Sox fans were much nicer. It wasn't even close. Which is just weird considering the Sox are actual rivals.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,uponplane,2,Sat Jun 20 21:19:43 2015 UTC,Ditto. Wrigley was just awful to me. Sox fans would joke around but not be serious dicks. Every year my buddy goes to the Sox vs. Cubs series and Cubs fans are constantly getting booted for starting fights.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,The_Poochinski,4,Sat Jun 20 21:24:33 2015 UTC,"God damnit Dick, you got my hopes up again."

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sat Jun 20 21:04:42 2015 UTC,I am simply amazed at how our pitching keeps us in the game after making all these mistakes.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,AdaAstra,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"Twins pitching really has been phenomenonal so far.   And that's without Ervin Santana. (edit,  as soon I say that,  we give up 2 runs.   I'll be quiet now.)"
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,phernoree,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:10:21 2015 UTC,I can't fault Boyer on this.  We should have locked this game up already in the 8th and the 9th.  Mistakes made in base running cost us this game.  We should have challenged that Buxton call.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 20 21:17:57 2015 UTC,3 of our last 4 outs on the basepaths.  Good lawd.

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,NorseWolves,2,Sat Jun 20 21:05:12 2015 UTC,That's why you don't challenge the Buxton call.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,phernoree,2,Sat Jun 20 21:01:56 2015 UTC,Had the Buxton call been challenged the game might be over now.

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,cadderly09,3,Sat Jun 20 21:00:08 2015 UTC,I like Mauer stealing.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,FlannelBeard,3,Sat Jun 20 20:59:27 2015 UTC,Mauer lol  And he's out.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sat Jun 20 20:59:27 2015 UTC,"Come on Plouffe, give me a walk off!"
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,uponplane,2,Sat Jun 20 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"Mauer Pauer.  Edit: His 3rd walk of the game too.  Whatever works, Joe."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,theavocadoenthusiast,3,Sat Jun 20 20:54:44 2015 UTC,"So Mauer should just stop swinging, it's working out for him today."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sat Jun 20 20:54:43 2015 UTC,5 walks in last 6 PAs for Mauer.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:54:38 2015 UTC,I like how catchers catch the ball up by their head and then try to frame it chest level.

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,cadderly09,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:42:33 2015 UTC,I have always wondered why more players don't block the bases more often like the second baseman did. I have seen many runners out because of a foot blocking the base.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,Mariox,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:42:21 2015 UTC,Cleats. Fingers. Injuries.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:46:37 2015 UTC,"If you don't know why more people don't block the base, you should do some research on a former Twin from Japan."

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,KiggedyKunks,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"As long as he has the ball when contact is made, the fielder can block him in any way."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,stuckupinhere,2,Sat Jun 20 20:41:07 2015 UTC,If the player is in the process of fielding the ball it's not obstruction to be in the basepath.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sat Jun 20 20:47:08 2015 UTC,Every time Buxton gets out the next batter gets a hit... think about when Buxton gets his timing down and he's getting 2+ bases with each hit.
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,DetectiveWoofles,0,Sat Jun 20 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"I gotta know not to start with the panic yet. Even though he has been atrocious since coming up, Buxton is young and this is only his first stint as a major leaguer."
minnesotatwins,3aixj7,NorseWolves,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"I gotta know not to start with the panic yet.   Find this to be really difficult for people that don't have baseball as their favorite sport. Especially football fans that try to adapt, because they're so used to players that need production instantly, because of how short their careers are."

If you're single/dating/kid-less, go during the week with some friends or just the two of you (( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), and do some waterpark stuff, shop, get a bite to eat, and the hotels are pretty nice there.

minnesotatwins,3aixj7,Gallade3,5,Sat Jun 20 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"Jon Lester on the mound for the Cubs. 5-pitch LHP. Four-seamer, sinker, and cutter are the hard pitches (anywhere from 88-95 mph, the cutter is a little slower of the three), four-seamer is used 41%, cutter used 27%, and the sinker used 11%. Lester also has a curve at 73-77mph used 15%, and a change-up at 83-86mph used 4%.  Lefties see the cutter a bit more, used like a slider, and expect it when they are behind or with two strikes, as Lester has thrown it 50% of the time this season in those counts. He gets ahead of LHH with the four-seamer, and uses the sinker, curve, and change a little less compared to righties.  Righties get a ton of four-seamers early (53% first pitch), but Lester has a great split to right-handers with two strikes, leaving it to either the four-seamer, cutter, or curve. Change-up is mostly used when Jon gets behind hitters and are expecting fastball, also his highest swing-and-miss pitch at 19.23% whiff.  Lester has a great GB rate on his sinker and change (21.58% and 17.31% respectively), but has seen a high amount of line drives (6.52%) off his cutter. Opposing batters are hitting .333 avg/.540 slg against the cutter and .364/.546 against the change this season.  On the year, Lester is 4-5 with a 3.99 ERA (3.51 FIP), 74 strikeouts to 20 walks in 79 IP. He's coming off one of his better starts of the season last time out vs. Cincinnati where he went 7.0 IP, gave up 5 hits, 1 run, 0 walks, and 4 strikeouts.  Twins lineup vs. Jon Lester -  Dozier: 2 for 8, 1 double, 1 BB  Rosario: Never faced   Mauer: 8 for 23, 3 doubles, 4 BB, 2 K  Plouffe: 1 for 9, 1 BB, 1 K  Hunter: 16 for 41, 3 doubles, 1 HR, 2 BB, 5 K  Suzuki: 6 for 21, 2 BB, 3 K  Vargas: 0 for 3, 1 K  Escobar: 0 for 5, 4 K  Buxton: Never faced"

It didn't seem any different than any other ballpark I've ever been to. However, I've never been to Fenway, but I know those are some rabid fans out there, so that may have changed your perception a bit.  2010 was the first year of the new stadium, and it sold out every single game. Half the seats were filled with people who simply wanted to see the long-awaited new ballpark. Many of them couldn't care less about baseball and barely watched the game unless they heard the crack of the bat. I heard it's like that in a lot of places when new ballparks open. People are rubbernecking and watching the stadium more than the game."

minnesotatwins,3aje3i,phernoree,4,Sat Jun 20 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"You can't just send veterans to the minors whenever you want. Nolasco would have to accept being sent down (not going to happen), or else he could opt to become a free agent (absolutely would happen), which would mean the Twins would be paying him the remainder of his contract to pitch for someone else or sit on his couch."
minnesotatwins,3aje3i,tennisspears,3,Sun Jun 21 03:09:40 2015 UTC,He can be sent down on a 30 day rehabilitation assignment following his stint on the d/l.
minnesotatwins,3aje3i,phernoree,3,Sun Jun 21 03:43:27 2015 UTC,"It's also worth mentioning that Nolasco looked pretty good in May before he got injured. If he pitches like that again, there's not a whole lot for him to figure out."
minnesotatwins,3aje3i,tennisspears,2,Sun Jun 21 03:45:59 2015 UTC,Peace out Tommy Milone then Pelfrey or Nolasco will probably be traded.
minnesotatwins,3aje3i,dabecka,2,Sat Jun 20 21:05:11 2015 UTC,If we could trade Nolasco...I would be a happy man.
minnesotatwins,3aje3i,HughManatee,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:38:02 2015 UTC,Trade away a pitcher for a better hitting DH? SS? CF? 1B? I'm not sure where you make a move and improve!  Really curious what they do.
minnesotatwins,3aje3i,Evergreen3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised to see a trade of Pelfry and Plouffe for a short stop. With Pelfry posting abnormally good numbers and Plouffe on the verge of losing his spot to Sano within the next few seasons, I think the front office might be willing to give them away for a shortstop that can field and hit."
minnesotatwins,3aje3i,Kripzo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:47:41 2015 UTC,"Those would've been moves the Twins likely would've made if they were out of contention........but since the Twins will (hopefully) have something to play for come the deadline on July 31st, I don't think they'd do that."

minnesotatwins,3ahejq,Capitol62,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:32:23 2015 UTC,"You gotta look at the schedule before the season starts and see who they are playing.  The Cubs, Brewers, Red Sox, Yankees, Blue Jays fans all travel well to Minnesota.  April is not worth buying tickets in advance, because the weather is so sporadic (I went to a double header with snow in my seats).  September is also sporadic, because of the on field performances.  Weekend games middle of may until end of august are all popular.  Combine the popular teams with a weekend game in those months and its a guaranteed difficult ticket.  If you buy in person you avoid the awful fees as well.  Then, supplement the april and september games via stub hub and you can get to 30 games for about $300."

Last winter, I helped run the Pro Shop in Roseville, and we'd had about 3 people come in all day - most of them only to say ""oops, thought this was the dollar tree"". After a solid hour of nothingness, I hear the door swing open hard and there's Tony freakin' Oliva hunched over with his hands together in the shape of a gun, bellowing out ""GIB ME ALL JYOUR MONEE"". None of us could stop laughing for a solid minute, and he ended up telling us how he got bored waiting for his wife to finish shopping at the camera place next door and how much February weather sucks."

minnesotatwins,3aggg0,kaiserj1982,3,Sat Jun 20 00:47:11 2015 UTC,I'm getting annoyed with that Carrier heating and cooling commercial where he is walking in the dugout and everyone looks at him as he passes.   Except for the goofy fucker in the glasses who waits like a second later after he passes and screws it all up.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 20 00:48:17 2015 UTC,"In South Dakota, we have this Ramada Aberdeen commercial that is just the worst. There is NOTHING in Aberdeen worth staying in a Ramada for."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,cadderly09,3,Sat Jun 20 00:49:35 2015 UTC,Other South Dakotan......I would agree.  Still better than a place like Huron or something.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 20 00:50:50 2015 UTC,Pierre... Ew.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,cadderly09,3,Sat Jun 20 00:51:30 2015 UTC,What voodoo is this BS that is trying to kill our players!?!?!
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,3,Sat Jun 20 00:44:42 2015 UTC,I would have to think long and hard if I had to choose who would win a race between Suzuki and Vargas. That's sad.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,4,Sat Jun 20 01:01:28 2015 UTC,Turns out we didn't manage to watch the game at Target Field so we are just eating Lucy now. Haha why is that guy getting thrown popcorn?
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,HolyCelestia,5,Sat Jun 20 01:06:35 2015 UTC,Sunflower seeds. The other pitchers do it whenever FSN is interviewing a pitcher.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,FlannelBeard,4,Sat Jun 20 01:07:49 2015 UTC,The pitchers have a fetish for throwing seeds at whoever is doing an interview. They didn't suspect Pelf was a part-time bee-keeper!
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,5,Sat Jun 20 01:07:52 2015 UTC,"He didn't have a clue if he was going make it, but that was a really good catch by Escobar."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,5,Sat Jun 20 01:08:40 2015 UTC,"I know Buxton hasn't had enough at-bats to really judge his call-up as a success or failure, but for those who've watched baseball a while, what's your impression of how he's playing at this level? Is he looking like the same guy from AA, but with some bad luck against some good teams? Or are you seeing anything that indicates he's not ready, or about to break out?"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,50in15,5,Sat Jun 20 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"The type of pitching he is used to seeing in AA is nothing like what he is seeing here in the bigs.  It will take time for him to adapt to how a pitcher will pitch him up here.  On that note, I would say its success in that he is getting good experience right now."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,schrica,7,Sat Jun 20 01:22:52 2015 UTC,Not really seeing much wrong with his hitting other than his reluctancy to swing ay breaking pitches. Just when he hits the ball they haven't been falling for hits.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,vagrantwade,6,Sat Jun 20 01:24:17 2015 UTC,"His speed and glove will play just fine for now, so it that sense, he is totally ready to be here. I think almost everyone expected his bat would be a bit slow against big league pitchers, at least for a little while. So far that's been exactly what we have seen, although facing the Cardinals rotation right out of the chute is kind of a tough way to start."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,5,Sat Jun 20 01:19:56 2015 UTC,"that sounds like the exact same thing that happened to Hicks, and people turned on him so fast, I hope its not the same"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,taffyowner,4,Sat Jun 20 01:21:19 2015 UTC,"He's young, should get more time in the minors, AAA preferably."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,SplurgingSpurgeon,3,Sat Jun 20 01:20:37 2015 UTC,I think he's still adjusting. In love with his speed. Seems like a good level headed dude so I don't doubt him putting in the work to do better. Still have high hopes for him despite a slow start

minnesotatwins,3aggg0,vagrantwade,4,Sat Jun 20 01:31:12 2015 UTC,That Lightning playoff beard must have been weighing down Hughes.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,4,Sat Jun 20 01:39:28 2015 UTC,Let's hope it's a repeat of last year......he didn't get off to a stellar start last year but he was amazing the 2nd half.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,imissedthetoilet,5,Sat Jun 20 01:41:20 2015 UTC,Woo.....shut down inning after putting runs on the board is huge. Nice job.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,imissedthetoilet,5,Sat Jun 20 01:39:52 2015 UTC,Vargas is the MVP.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,blrasmu,4,Sat Jun 20 01:43:15 2015 UTC,Great to see Vargas with the hard opposite field double
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Sat Jun 20 01:43:39 2015 UTC,"Missed the first 5 runs, but caught the last half inning! Nice."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,NorseWolves,3,Sat Jun 20 01:45:02 2015 UTC,Not a smart play by Montero there. Wow.

minnesotatwins,3aggg0,NorseWolves,3,Sat Jun 20 01:46:07 2015 UTC,What the hell are the Cubs doing?
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,4,Sat Jun 20 01:49:21 2015 UTC,"Oh no, the pessimist inside me is already coming out. I should know better."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,NorseWolves,5,Sat Jun 20 01:49:26 2015 UTC,"Dear god, what fucking magic was that shit?!?!?!?"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,3,Sat Jun 20 01:49:37 2015 UTC,We got some speedy ass outfielders thats for sure. Glad Rosario has earned a spot up in the Majors.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,NorseWolves,4,Sat Jun 20 01:58:55 2015 UTC,Outfield defense!
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,4,Sat Jun 20 01:59:03 2015 UTC,Boy Rosario has really impressed me with his defense. I admit I'm surprised since he's always been touted as a 2B until last year.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 01:59:05 2015 UTC,Lost his helmet. Everyone drink.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,4,Sat Jun 20 02:05:23 2015 UTC,Gonna say Nunez is doing alright.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,50in15,5,Sat Jun 20 02:05:29 2015 UTC,I can only assume Nunez's helmet came off.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,kaiserj1982,5,Sat Jun 20 02:05:32 2015 UTC,Third time losing his helmet tonight.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,5,Sat Jun 20 02:05:56 2015 UTC,48th time this year. Going for the record.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"I know he is at 95 pitchers, but I hope they let Hughes try to go the complete game.  We have runs to burn through at least."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,5,Sat Jun 20 02:13:47 2015 UTC,psst.....chevy.....portable hot spots are not expensive
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,4,Sat Jun 20 02:14:48 2015 UTC,"Alright, Buxton first hit in Target going to happen this at bat."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,4,Sat Jun 20 02:19:23 2015 UTC,Reverse the call.  Lets get this done.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,4,Sat Jun 20 02:26:08 2015 UTC,God damn Rizzo.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,4,Sat Jun 20 02:28:16 2015 UTC,I like how everybody thinks Vargas has turned things around after one home run.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,kaiserj1982,5,Fri Jun 19 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"I think we were all happy to see a game-winning jack.  Don't think anyone here thinks Vargas has exactly proven to have turned things around, though."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,CentralAmerican,3,Sat Jun 20 00:14:29 2015 UTC,Just delaying the inevitable is all... Sano our savior
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Capn_Barboza,3,Sat Jun 20 00:31:18 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, the Cubs have a couple players hitting over .300. Is that even legal?"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,roybringus,3,Sat Jun 20 00:10:16 2015 UTC,"Great shift, Molitor!  Props!"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,CentralAmerican,3,Sat Jun 20 00:13:27 2015 UTC,I like seeing Mauer K Pauer in the 3 hole as a change... he obviously needed it.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Capn_Barboza,3,Sat Jun 20 00:16:33 2015 UTC,"Alright Hughes, this is the Quality start we've been waiting for. I know you've got it in you."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Yessirmrmonkey,3,Sat Jun 20 00:18:37 2015 UTC,"Sac fly here Plouffe, we don't ask for much!"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,CentralAmerican,3,Sat Jun 20 00:22:29 2015 UTC,HE FUCKED UP. WOOOOO
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Sat Jun 20 00:23:58 2015 UTC,Hee hee!!!!
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,CentralAmerican,3,Sat Jun 20 00:25:38 2015 UTC,There goes our only 300 hitter.... fuck.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,ItsThisEasy,3,Sat Jun 20 00:27:23 2015 UTC,Hope Nunez is okay....
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,CentralAmerican,3,Sat Jun 20 00:29:28 2015 UTC,What happened I'm at Costco
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,swashbucklerjak,2,Sat Jun 20 00:29:46 2015 UTC,Nunez hit in the right hand knuckles with a fastball.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,cadderly09,3,Sat Jun 20 00:30:10 2015 UTC,"He was to the base already, and off comes the helmet. Man, I love Nunez."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,3,Sat Jun 20 00:30:06 2015 UTC,Fuck thats gotta hurt! Fuck!
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,meat_tub,3,Sat Jun 20 00:30:13 2015 UTC,"Get home, turn on the game......to watch Nunez crush his hands.  Dear god, should I even watch if I'm bringing that bad juju already?"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,3,Sat Jun 20 00:30:29 2015 UTC,Ill take 2 runs there. Better than weve been doing lately
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,FlannelBeard,3,Sat Jun 20 00:31:34 2015 UTC,"Run expectancy table says 2.390 with bases loaded and no outs. So not terrible, but just a little below average."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,3,Sat Jun 20 00:32:41 2015 UTC,"Man, that injury killed all our momentum. Poor Nunez, he's been so hot lately and he's really hurting. At least we're playing a team that might slip up enough to give us a chance to exploit it!"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,50in15,3,Sat Jun 20 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, seriously.......are people having audio issues on FSN too?   Seem like the background ballpark audio is like a tenth of a second behind Dick and Berts audio.  So makes it sound all demonic like."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,3,Sat Jun 20 00:36:16 2015 UTC,Sounds fine on MLB.tv
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,3,Sat Jun 20 00:36:50 2015 UTC,"When you get out of them, do people shoot at you?"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,raptor_patrol,3,Sat Jun 20 00:42:30 2015 UTC,Anyone got a working stream? A lot just went down.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,flopperazzi,3,Sat Jun 20 00:47:48 2015 UTC,Check in here.  Usually people post a couple different ones to try.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 20 00:53:03 2015 UTC,None of them work either
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,flopperazzi,3,Sat Jun 20 00:56:44 2015 UTC,"Dang, well I'm out of ideas."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,3,Sat Jun 20 00:57:28 2015 UTC,Is this the point where the Cardinals fan bitch about how they got rob and that we purposely made walls higher over there to fuck them over?
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 20 00:56:47 2015 UTC,Should have been a home run. Fucking park dimensions.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 00:58:03 2015 UTC,"Barely a foot away from leaving the park, just like Plouffe's hit not too long ago."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,3,Sat Jun 20 00:57:06 2015 UTC,Rizzo is a good baseball player.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,3,Sat Jun 20 01:05:42 2015 UTC,PLOOOOOUUUUFFFE
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Sat Jun 20 01:29:38 2015 UTC,Awh fuck yeah Plouffe you're the man.  EDIT: PLOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUFFE
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 01:29:39 2015 UTC,Smacked.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tokomini,3,Sat Jun 20 01:29:56 2015 UTC,Nunez understands that pitch about as much as I understand Bronies
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,50in15,3,Sat Jun 20 01:30:33 2015 UTC,That seems random.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 01:30:56 2015 UTC,I really don't understand them
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,50in15,3,Sat Jun 20 01:31:39 2015 UTC,Dudes love ponies bro.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 01:33:47 2015 UTC,Lol fuckin plouffe
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Sat Jun 20 01:30:44 2015 UTC,"dammit Plouffe, learn to run the bases"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,taffyowner,3,Sat Jun 20 01:30:45 2015 UTC,Go twins go! Keep this lead!
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,y2jayjk,3,Sat Jun 20 01:35:18 2015 UTC,Why does it feel like Rosario has been in the big leagues for longer than he has?
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,kaiserj1982,3,Sat Jun 20 01:35:23 2015 UTC,Because he's playing like it?
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,The_Effing_Eagle,3,Sat Jun 20 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"ok actually seeing that slide into first by Rosario, thats the only time it's acceptable to do it"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,taffyowner,3,Sat Jun 20 01:38:26 2015 UTC,Fo shizzle Rizzo! Man that feels good to say
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,inyourface_milwaukee,3,Sat Jun 20 01:38:43 2015 UTC,If only Suzuki was not so slow! Way to go Vargas!
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 01:43:32 2015 UTC,ENTHUSIASM!!
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 01:45:44 2015 UTC,WOOOOOOOOO!! Taking advantages of those mistakes
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Sat Jun 20 01:46:24 2015 UTC,I'm still having fun guys c:
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 01:53:37 2015 UTC,Winning 7-1 I won't complain about missing that opportunity
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Sat Jun 20 01:54:19 2015 UTC,Looks like Hughes is done.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,3,Sat Jun 20 02:16:35 2015 UTC,I wonder if he had a say in it
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,swashbucklerjak,4,Sat Jun 20 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with it, even though, personally, I would have left him in. You have low-leverage relievers like Graham and Duensing that could use some work."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,3,Sat Jun 20 02:24:46 2015 UTC,Let Hughes have it.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,kaiserj1982,3,Sat Jun 20 02:23:35 2015 UTC,two down \m/
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 20 02:27:46 2015 UTC,That's a strong man.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,6,Sat Jun 20 02:28:13 2015 UTC,Let's put Buxton back in the oven a little longer and start the Sano Show
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,vagrantwade,4,Sat Jun 20 02:25:31 2015 UTC,Still need a center fielder while Hicks is on the DL.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,tennisspears,4,Sat Jun 20 02:26:16 2015 UTC,Can Buxton just literally not hit breaking pitches? He is just getting them down the middle and watching them
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,vagrantwade,7,Sat Jun 20 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"he can but theres a reason MLB pitchers are there, its because they can hide them better than AA or AAA pitchers, hes just gotta get better at identifying them, which will happen"
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,taffyowner,2,Sat Jun 20 01:50:35 2015 UTC,Oh shit... Nunez no...
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,cadderly09,2,Sat Jun 20 00:26:45 2015 UTC,Nunez this is a silly at-bat. Please be reasonable.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 20 00:26:49 2015 UTC,"Could have been a massive inning, but I'll take 2! Hold that lead, Hughes."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 20 00:32:20 2015 UTC,Phil shaved.
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,kaiserj1982,2,Sat Jun 20 00:38:16 2015 UTC,"Damn Joe, gotta work a better at-bat with a guy on 3rd. Wait for your pitch, like you always do."
minnesotatwins,3aggg0,50in15,2,Sat Jun 20 00:56:54 2015 UTC,June Joe is not the Joe we know and love.
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,doubleflusher,6,Sat Jun 20 21:50:41 2015 UTC,Seven games is a really small sample size. He doesn't look lost up there. I hope they a stick with him for a while longer. Don't want to kill his confidence.
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,thepaloalto,3,Sun Jun 21 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"He's 2/22 - not a good start, but certainly not enough of a sample size to determine anything long-term.  Aaron Hicks was 2/60 to start off in 2013 and he stayed in the starting line-up the rest of the season.  It's only his 8th game - and he showed more maturity at the plate today (2 walks).  I say you start him a minimum 15 games before sending him back down."
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,phernoree,3,Sun Jun 21 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"Some of his strikeouts look just terrible. But I'm okay with them giving him a longer leash. If he's still not doing well into the ASB, then I think they should send him down. His defense has been good though. At this point I just want to see a 3 hit game with an extra base hit and a steal. Still excited for the guy, that's for sure, although I will never understand why someone pours a gallon of movie theater popcorn butter directly on top of his head before every game."
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,JakeIsWet,6,Sun Jun 21 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"Jesus. Talk about impatience. They brought the kid up to learn and grow. Dump him down after a week? No way...he's going to need a month or two to adjust. Give him time. He will figure it out. He is far to gifted to not...and sending him back down will crush his spirits. Best to let him stew in it while surrounded with our teams best stafff, management and mentors. All of which are far better up here than down in aaa or aa. He will get there. Patience."
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,creative_dreams,3,Sun Jun 21 07:09:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The kid is only 21. Shit, he's 3 years below the average age of AA. His pure, baseline tools will catch up to the MLB learning curve. They've given him an approach (attack early) and he just needs to work on it. He's starting getting walks so he's figuring the strike zone out, but it's no secret that he's easy to strike out at this point. Patience."
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,OrbitsUnbounded,-4,Mon Jun 22 12:05:07 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Send him down to AAA to get some quality at bats and regain his confidence. Through no fault of his own, I don't think the kid was mentally prepared for  making the leap to MLB pitching. I think it will come around, but I think the best way to regain it is by hitting the ""restart"" button and getting some quality ABs against AAA pitching.   I'm seeing a guy whose confidence at the plate is shot at the moment. Of course, now that I say that he'll go 3-4 with two RBI in today's game."
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,TheMichaelN,0,Sun Jun 21 16:39:26 2015 UTC,whatever it takes to win..including you jinxing any and all bad luck
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,creative_dreams,2,Mon Jun 22 08:33:26 2015 UTC,"No.   1) He's the best option at CF.  2) He's 21 years old and the first time he's seeing breaking pitches and ML pitching.  It takes time.  Mike Trout struggled immensely in his first call up as well.  3) Though he struggled at the plate, his tools were there.  His speed, arm, defense, baserunning, breaks on the balls in the field were top notch -- some of the best tools in the game.  How many major leaguers RIGHT NOW could do what he did (at bats notwithstanding).  4)  His last few games he drew walks and showed a much better approach at the plate.  5) He's so young and the hit tool needs additional time.  Keep him up so he can learn from Torii, work with Bruno and Molitor, and learn the game and contribute.  You can't bump him for anyone else in the organization."
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,dabecka,2,Mon Jun 22 20:32:16 2015 UTC,How do you feel about posting this after his game last night? Did seeing him have a good game change your viewpoint at all?
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,tcarr31,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"Good game against a bad team. Would still like to see him in AAA for a while, but I'm cautiously optimistic."
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,flashheatmvp3,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"It's tough timing because Hicks being on the DL for like another week and just releasing Schafer we kind of need a CF. Could always let Robinson play it or call back up Danny Santana (haven't followed how he's been doing in AAA).  Hopefully he learns from this experience, already got first big league hit and stuff out of the way and has an idea of the pace that they play at. I can imagine how crazy it is making the jump from AA to MLB that young, he knows he has things to work on but also know he can hang (that stand up triple he was flying around the bases).   Buxton's performance might also affect how willing we are to call up Sano"
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,FlannelBeard,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:35:59 2015 UTC,Santana has been doing well in the minors.  .366/.413/.512/.925

minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,dat_1_dude,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:47:48 2015 UTC,He also struggled the first couple weeks at AA. Give him time to adjust.
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,tcarr31,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:19:53 2015 UTC,"Have to be more patient and give him time to adjust to big league pitching. At least from what I have seen, he does great if he gets into a fastball count, just really having a hard time with breaking balls. He is an above average fielder with a great arm and great speed, so I think we have time to wait for him to develop at the plate. What does it hurt to have him sit there in the 9 hole?"
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,ClemDeLaClem,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"No. Give him time and he can make a serious impact this season. He's only played in seven games and is already making an impact on the defensive side of the ball. Plus, the Twins just ran through a gauntlet of good pitching. I expect to see him break out a bit in this series against the White Sox. Besides, he was called up to replace Hicks and Hicks isn't ready yet. Why season him at AAA when you can season him in the Majors? Also, he's had some bat at bats, sure, but he's also had some really good at bats that didn't produce hits. The Show doesn't look too big for him, and I believe the numbers will come around here fairly quickly."
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,creative_dreams,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:10:30 2015 UTC,In the past four games he is hitting .300  patience patience folks.
minnesotatwins,3ajrk8,Mrblobbyuk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:10:43 2015 UTC,"Sure. And in 11 games he's batting .189 with 0 RBIs, 5 runs and 15 Ks. The Twins don't have time to be patient with this kid. If we were 20 games below .500, it would be a different story. However, we need run production.   Let Buxton drop down to AAA and get a couple months in before September call ups. If we're still in a pennant race come fall, I'm sure there will be room for him on the roster."

Story time, I was never more happy when I was 1-2 rows away from Morneau while he was signing before a game and he made an effort to skip all the 'older' guys and just get the kids stuff.  Stick to ebay or live shows. There is nothing more sad than seeing a 20-30something year old elbow his way in front of some kids.  If you want some help just let me know :)"
minnesotatwins,3ahk95,59179,2,Sat Jun 20 09:01:47 2015 UTC,"The best way is to go to an event where he is preparing to sign.   Home teams have batting practice first, starting before the gates open, so you might not even see him on the field, even if you get there when the gates open."
minnesotatwins,3ahk95,AlongCamePollyIsBae,3,Sat Jun 20 14:06:03 2015 UTC,Yeah. Go early for their warmups and BP. Go down to field level and hope you get lucky.

minnesotatwins,3abm1p,Khoops66,7,Thu Jun 18 19:58:29 2015 UTC,This. This is the kind of shit that makes an evening at work feel like nothing.   Only thing that sucks is that there is no Baseball for us until the 22nd. :(
minnesotatwins,3abm1p,BrianDoziersHair,8,Thu Jun 18 20:04:31 2015 UTC,Cubs are coming in this weekend.
minnesotatwins,3abm1p,tenthreeleader,4,Thu Jun 18 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"Wait, what? I look at the schedule on the right side of the subreddit and it shows 3 blank days.   Is there some magic at work here?"
minnesotatwins,3abm1p,BrianDoziersHair,7,Thu Jun 18 20:15:26 2015 UTC,"The logo doesn't show up, but if you click those days, it directs you to the Cubs subreddit."
minnesotatwins,3abm1p,tennisspears,6,Thu Jun 18 20:20:34 2015 UTC,"Well, if you mouse over it, you see the Cubs on the menu bar.  And the Twins game notes today say the same thing. :)"
minnesotatwins,3abm1p,tenthreeleader,7,Thu Jun 18 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"That's my bad, the Cubs changed their subreddit to /r/CHICubs instead of /r/Cubs and so it fucked with my CSS. I tried to fix it but it's not working...."
minnesotatwins,3abm1p,BrianDoziersHair,3,Thu Jun 18 20:22:05 2015 UTC,It's the effort that counts. Maybe the subreddit is so scared of the Twins that it refuses to work with your CSS? :B
minnesotatwins,3abm1p,dachristensen,5,Thu Jun 18 20:24:08 2015 UTC,Fear not! The cubs are in town for the weekend! For some reason it's not on our sidebar schedule...

minnesotatwins,3aarju,Huskypuck,6,Thu Jun 18 19:24:42 2015 UTC,Can't blame buxton when the rest of the team can't swing the stick.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Slapachimp,3,Thu Jun 18 19:23:36 2015 UTC,No more K Pauer Mauer
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Capn_Barboza,3,Thu Jun 18 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"Fuck everything, why are the Cardinals so good?"
minnesotatwins,3aarju,DetectiveWoofles,6,Thu Jun 18 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"Hacks.  (Sorry, had to.)"

minnesotatwins,3aarju,Huskypuck,2,Thu Jun 18 19:20:11 2015 UTC,haha yep
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Slapachimp,3,Thu Jun 18 19:48:05 2015 UTC,Buxton is now 2/16 and Gleeman is probably still bitching about him batting 9th every game so far.   At least that was a decent at-bat.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,tennisspears,3,Thu Jun 18 19:19:38 2015 UTC,When has Gleeman complained about his placement in the lineup?
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Khoops66,2,Thu Jun 18 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"Go look back at his Twitter timeline over the last few days. He has made a bunch of snarky tweets about how it is stupid that he is hitting behind guys like Herrmann, Escobar, and two pitchers."
minnesotatwins,3aarju,tennisspears,3,Thu Jun 18 19:25:39 2015 UTC,Buxton's start to his career is giving me Aaron Hicks deja vu.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,vagrantwade,3,Thu Jun 18 19:19:04 2015 UTC,Willie Mays started 0-23. Trout was sent back to AA after hitting .163 in 2011.   You're really going to judge the Buxton so quick?
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Fenamo,4,Thu Jun 18 19:29:08 2015 UTC,Cards do have the best pitching in the majors... he won't be facing this quality every day like he has 4 days in a row against the cards
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Capn_Barboza,3,Thu Jun 18 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"To his credit, he did take Siegrist 9 pitches deep at least."
minnesotatwins,3aarju,BrianDoziersHair,4,Thu Jun 18 19:19:37 2015 UTC,Well he's also a much better fielder and runner. Still having about the same amount of success at the plate.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,vagrantwade,3,Thu Jun 18 19:20:44 2015 UTC,Well at least hes raising the pitch count.

minnesotatwins,3aarju,Capn_Barboza,3,Thu Jun 18 19:16:13 2015 UTC,Sano? Lol.

minnesotatwins,3aarju,RichardManuel,3,Thu Jun 18 19:15:02 2015 UTC,Big Pelf was money (again) today. Now let's get him a win.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,tennisspears,2,Thu Jun 18 19:13:39 2015 UTC,Pelf is a rock star. Way to pitch
minnesotatwins,3aarju,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Thu Jun 18 19:13:27 2015 UTC,So I can't watch... what happened?  Edit: Thanks guys. But really Vargas...
minnesotatwins,3aarju,hinayu,3,Thu Jun 18 19:12:03 2015 UTC,Twins loaded the bases.  Cards walked Suzuki intentionally to get to Vargas.  Vargas grounded into an easy double play.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,CentralAmerican,2,Thu Jun 18 19:13:06 2015 UTC,"Sigh. Knew I shouldn't have asked... frustrating, man"
minnesotatwins,3aarju,hinayu,3,Thu Jun 18 19:14:45 2015 UTC,Bases loaded one out and Vargas grounded into the worlds easiest double play.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,vagrantwade,3,Thu Jun 18 19:13:05 2015 UTC,Vargas hit into a bases-loaded double play on a weak ground ball up the middle.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Kruse,2,Thu Jun 18 19:12:55 2015 UTC,God damn runs are hard to come by
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Khoops66,4,Thu Jun 18 19:12:02 2015 UTC,All you needed to do is hit a lazy fly ball...God Damnit!

minnesotatwins,3aarju,y2jayjk,9,Thu Jun 18 19:10:33 2015 UTC,God damn you Vargas
minnesotatwins,3aarju,IamKEIL,6,Thu Jun 18 19:10:25 2015 UTC,Would of really considered pinch hitting Vargas there.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,kuj4k,2,Thu Jun 18 19:10:02 2015 UTC,I just mentioned that I'd have also pinch hit Shane Robinson for him.  But pinch-hitting for a DH is more or less admitting you filled out a bad lineup card.  Would have loved to see Molly adjust and live for the moment though and used Robinson.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,CentralAmerican,2,Thu Jun 18 19:12:18 2015 UTC,"I would of just liked to see it, because of the IW. Try to catch the Cards off guard."
minnesotatwins,3aarju,kuj4k,2,Thu Jun 18 19:30:16 2015 UTC,"Vargas isn't the DH. Mauer is. Put Shane in for Vargas, throw Joe on first. Done."
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Huskypuck,2,Thu Jun 18 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can put a guy in the field after you ""designate"" him with the DH label.  So if Shane pinch hit for Vargas, we could have moved Plouffe to 1st and put Escobar in at 3rd.  Still pretty easy."
minnesotatwins,3aarju,CentralAmerican,3,Thu Jun 18 19:20:28 2015 UTC,"You can, but you lose the DH and pitchers have to hit in it's place."
minnesotatwins,3aarju,ChiefakaJames,2,Thu Jun 18 19:39:09 2015 UTC,"Don't know how losing your DH (putting Mauer at first would do that) to put in Shane Robinson, a career .235/.302/.311 hitter, is a viable option."
minnesotatwins,3aarju,ChiefakaJames,4,Thu Jun 18 19:18:12 2015 UTC,Im really getting tired of kennys
minnesotatwins,3aarju,harmlessmeat,4,Thu Jun 18 19:09:51 2015 UTC,GOD DAMNIT IT ALL TO HELL!
minnesotatwins,3aarju,Tannekr,3,Thu Jun 18 19:09:30 2015 UTC,Vargas is one of the worst hitters I've ever seen.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,pman5595,4,Thu Jun 18 19:09:29 2015 UTC,He's terrible right now.  At this point I feel Shane Robinson would have been a good pinch-hitting option for him to stay out of a DP and probably simply just get the job done.....I guess the Twins are just giving Vargas all his chances before sending him back down.
minnesotatwins,3aarju,CentralAmerican,6,Thu Jun 18 19:11:01 2015 UTC,LAME
minnesotatwins,3aarju,kcirvam,3,Thu Jun 18 19:09:09 2015 UTC,Watching online it sounds like there's more Cardinals fans in the stadium than Twins fans. That sucks.

minnesotatwins,3a80wm,FlyingScissor,3,Thu Jun 18 02:36:46 2015 UTC,Rosario the biggest bright spot/surprise? Outside of starting pitching or even overall?
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,ChiefakaJames,3,Thu Jun 18 02:36:28 2015 UTC,No one's been talking about him but he's been a wonderful surprise. I think starting pitching takes the cake though.  Eddie is second (and he's amazing).

minnesotatwins,3a80wm,ChiefakaJames,6,Thu Jun 18 02:24:58 2015 UTC,Can we appreciate that Dozier leads the team in every offensive category except RBI (batting leadoff) and SB (Hicks?)?

minnesotatwins,3a80wm,BrianDoziersHair,4,Thu Jun 18 02:17:10 2015 UTC,Fucking Joe... Is there any chance he goes back to catching?
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,SplurgingSpurgeon,5,Thu Jun 18 02:16:26 2015 UTC,Nope.
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,DetectiveWoofles,3,Thu Jun 18 02:17:11 2015 UTC,He's just not the same player anymore...
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,SplurgingSpurgeon,2,Thu Jun 18 02:18:23 2015 UTC,And catching would help that?
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,ChiefakaJames,2,Thu Jun 18 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"Being behind the plate, seeing pitches, could definitely get him back into a groove. Anything to change this up."
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,SplurgingSpurgeon,2,Thu Jun 18 02:20:58 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have Mauer behind the plate again. As a catcher he was one of the best offensive and defensive in the league, but as a first baseman he's towards the bottom of that group. He just can't catch anymore though because of his concussions."
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,novafire08,2,Thu Jun 18 02:29:37 2015 UTC,No.

minnesotatwins,3a80wm,CentralAmerican,4,Thu Jun 18 02:09:37 2015 UTC,"That had some nasty movement, but Buxton needs to take a LOT of practice on the sliders."
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,DetectiveWoofles,3,Thu Jun 18 02:08:44 2015 UTC,That two strike slider to RHH is crazy. Saw same result vs. Hunter earlier.
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,ChiefakaJames,3,Thu Jun 18 02:08:32 2015 UTC,Buxton is kinky.
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,Derk-Derks,4,Thu Jun 18 02:06:54 2015 UTC,Buxton's first RBI right here
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,5,Thu Jun 18 02:06:26 2015 UTC,Good spot for Buxton here.

minnesotatwins,3a80wm,guiltycitizen,3,Thu Jun 18 02:05:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think he knows what to look for against Martinez, so it's a bit more difficult."
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,ChiefakaJames,2,Thu Jun 18 02:07:41 2015 UTC,"fair enough. his swing is just so damn awkward sometimes, it looks like an octopus falling out of a tree."
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,guiltycitizen,2,Thu Jun 18 02:09:28 2015 UTC,That mental image cracked me up big time. I wish I could upvote more than once!

minnesotatwins,3a80wm,guiltycitizen,6,Thu Jun 18 02:17:21 2015 UTC,Yeah Kennys beat out that throw.
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,DetectiveWoofles,4,Thu Jun 18 02:04:32 2015 UTC,Nunez is making the decision to keep Santana around so long look even worse.
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,tennisspears,2,Thu Jun 18 02:03:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Santana was also hitting as well as Nunez last year.  There was always hope he would bring it around.  Everyone just has highs and lows."
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,AdaAstra,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"Santana hit well last year, but he also had a .400 BABIP. That wasn't going to happen again.  You could also tell that Santana's at-bats were just awful this year. He looked completely lost. If there was no one behind him to play SS, I could see giving him a longer leash, as they had to do with Hicks a couple years ago. But they had possibly 3 guys ready to take his place (Escobar, Nunez, Polanco) and still waited too long to send him down.  Edit: And no, I don't expect Nunez to keep hitting like this, but since he has started out hot, they might as well have tried to ride him as long as they could and give Santana a break by sending him down."
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,tennisspears,4,Thu Jun 18 02:12:06 2015 UTC,Have yourself a game Nunez!
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,DetectiveWoofles,6,Thu Jun 18 02:03:00 2015 UTC,I think Yadier forgot what his last name was for a second there. Not even close.

minnesotatwins,3a80wm,DetectiveWoofles,3,Thu Jun 18 01:52:17 2015 UTC,"I got the Cards broadcast, what interview?"
minnesotatwins,3a80wm,guiltycitizen,0,Thu Jun 18 01:55:41 2015 UTC,Carpenter and Hunter apparently have some connections and that blonde chick from FSN interviews them at the same time.
minnesotatwins,3a8qui,presto9804,5,Thu Jun 18 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"Because they only are giving us one 4 game series against the Cards this year they don't want to give either team home field advantage so each team gets 2 games. We used to do this with Milwaukee but instead we get two weekend series against them this year, so we got the Cards instead."
minnesotatwins,3a8qui,DetectiveWoofles,3,Thu Jun 18 03:05:20 2015 UTC,"Because this season is playing against corresponding divisions (East vs. East, Central vs. Central, West vs. West), they made a pretty cool change to the interleague schedule. Teams play 6 games against their opposing league ""rival"" and 3-4 games (14 total) against the other four teams."
minnesotatwins,3a8qui,ChiefakaJames,3,Thu Jun 18 16:15:25 2015 UTC,A lot of teams are doing the same thing this week. It's like inter-league week or something.

minnesotatwins,3a913v,polamity,5,Thu Jun 18 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"Because he wasn't really playing that well earlier in the year and we were winning so we didn't need to try to force anything.  Loving him right now though, I was wrong about him."
minnesotatwins,3a913v,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:45:07 2015 UTC,It always bothered me when I rooted for him because he always annoyed me as a Yankee.  But I do find myself having to root for him more and more.  I hate that he keeps losing his helmet every time down the line though.
minnesotatwins,3a913v,Reapthebarry,5,Fri Jun 19 00:47:14 2015 UTC,"His defense hasn't been too spectacular, but it sure does seem like he's doing better than Santana and Escobar with the bat at least. I think he was also injured for awhile, which is why we didn't see him much earlier this year."
minnesotatwins,3a913v,overratedfood,3,Thu Jun 18 13:53:31 2015 UTC,"As another user has said, his defense is pretty poor.  Last night the Cards got a base hit on a ball that got by him, it was a good example of his limited range.   He was also on the DL early in the year as well, which didn't help as the Twins were winning and didn't seem to need his bat.  Now, the Twins are in serious need of offensive help and Nunez should see more playing time.  I for one hope to see more of him in the coming week or 2."
minnesotatwins,3a913v,CentralAmerican,3,Thu Jun 18 14:57:17 2015 UTC,"From what I hear, his defense is actually quite bad. Now I don't see him enough to really know, he looked okay tonight at shortstop, but I guess last year and when he was with the Yanks defensive metrics had him as being a very below-average shortstop. His bat has always been good though, nothing amazing but better than Santana and Escobar, and I would not mind seeing him play a bit more, though I expect he could be error-prone."
minnesotatwins,3a913v,Derk-Derks,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:08:59 2015 UTC,"Below average is an understatement. He's a defensive trainwreck. Guy can swing a bat though, when gets hot he gets really hot."
minnesotatwins,3a913v,agrueeatedu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:15:53 2015 UTC,"Because he IS a bad shortstop. He's proven that he can hit really well when he gets hot, but he's also a horrible fielder who doesn't have a ton of speed and below average plate discipline. Twins have a ton of guys on their roster that can kinda hit but can't field for shit. Not a good thing to have."

Otherwise it won't be sold out so you can just hit the ticket office right on Target plaza. You heard correct, anywhere along the 3rd base side gives an amazing view of the city, although you can get about the same view from first base as well.  Only if you are in dead right field does the view somewhat diminish, IMO.  As far as parking, just park in either A or B ramp. It is $15, little steep, but you literally take the freeway directly in and out of the ramp and both bring you right down into Target Plaza. As far as wearing a Dbacks jersey, wear whatever you want, it's a baseball game :) Have Fun!   Bonus: If you are looking for something sweet, I'd recommend the 'Mini-Apple Pie' out in center field. Awesome!"
minnesotatwins,3a9gtq,Vect0r,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:24:02 2015 UTC,What /u/Vect0r said: Stubhub on the 3rd base side. If you want a higher view I'd suggest section 220 (or thereabouts).  This site lets you see what your view looks like from anywhere in Target Field.

minnesotatwins,3a8yzh,novafire08,3,Thu Jun 18 04:22:46 2015 UTC,Mauer down to .253 now and his slugging percentage is 2nd to last among qualifying MLB 1B (23rd).  Getting real tired of watching him fail at the plate day in and day out.  Milone continues to cruise.  They better not send him down again when Nolasco gets healthy.  Poor Byron just needs to relax.  He'll get there.
minnesotatwins,3a8yzh,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:26:16 2015 UTC,"Hard to say where Mauer should go in the lineup, given that nobody else is hitting at the moment either.  On numbers alone here's a different lineup for last night:  Rosario/7(l)  Nunez/6 (r)  Dozier/4 (r)   Hunter/9 (r)  Plouffe/5 (r)  Vargas/dh (s)  Mauer/3 (l)  Herrmann/2 (l)  Buxton/8 (r)  L/R is whacked, though.  Not a fan of having four righties in a row in the middle of the lineup but when guys are scuffling like they are, putting Mauer in the top half of the order is a waste of space IMO."
minnesotatwins,3a8yzh,tenthreeleader,2,Thu Jun 18 14:39:01 2015 UTC,A win is a win. Milone pitched well and Rosario made some huge plays. Be nice if Perk would stop trying to give us heart attacks.

minnesotatwins,3a4eas,taffyowner,9,Wed Jun 17 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"I think you give Kennys Vargas a couple more weeks - and if he continues to struggle, send him down & bring up Sano."
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,phernoree,2,Wed Jun 17 04:54:37 2015 UTC,Most likely. Really disappointed in Kennys this year.
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,Ricky_Droschmidt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:34:40 2015 UTC,"He swung at more pitches outside of the strikezone than ones he swung at inside of the strikezone last year. I personally expected this. Didn't expect Santana to be as bad as he is, thought he'd be more of a .260 hitter than a .220 one."
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,agrueeatedu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:11:18 2015 UTC,Yea he's not extremely disciplined but you would think that would have been a focus of his this off season. Danny Santana was a total surprise this year.
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,Ricky_Droschmidt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:51:03 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say a total surprise. We all knew he wasn't anywhere near as good as his stats last year were. I just didn't expect him to fall off a cliff and keep rolling.
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,agrueeatedu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:54:32 2015 UTC,Well that's what I mean. He seemed like a real gamer with his head on straight. He completely mind fucked himself.
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,Ricky_Droschmidt,2,Fri Jun 19 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"My vision of this season once Santana was signed was a mixture of unproven young guys and decent pitching aiming for .500.  The rollercoaster of emotions has been unreal, and it is early June!  So much excitement!"
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,incredibleridiculous,3,Wed Jun 17 05:03:35 2015 UTC,"Hopefully when Santana comes back, he provides a spark that powers the Twins to the World Series!"
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,phenomworks,2,Wed Jun 17 13:57:33 2015 UTC,"Since half the lineup isn't producing at all, its some kind of miracle the Twins are still above .500.  Bringing up Sano could help."
minnesotatwins,3a4eas,dabecka,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:45:50 2015 UTC,Bring him up! I've been watching his minor league highlights for too long. Want to see him make our team better!
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,TwinsFaithful,8,Wed Jun 17 02:43:16 2015 UTC,"Sano is a first baseman.  The sooner this org recognizes that, and finds a way to get Mauer out of his way (I.E. make Joe learn to play LF) the better.    As a 3rd baseman Sano will always be limited defensively.  They should be telling him to keep putting on weight and be the power hitting first baseman this team hasn't seen since Morneau (hopefully better)."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,chucktestlacoil,4,Wed Jun 17 02:45:53 2015 UTC,and which of our OF do you plan to move?
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,tcarr31,5,Wed Jun 17 03:22:29 2015 UTC,"Buxton, Mauer & Rosario would be my ideal 2016 starters.  Arcia is 4th of & dh.  Hicks likely sticks as a utility outfielder."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,chucktestlacoil,6,Wed Jun 17 03:32:08 2015 UTC,why do you like Arcia over Hicks? he's not even really a 4th OF (usually more defensive oriented)... I would much rather prefer Hicks in that role if you arent going to make Hicks the RF (which is what I would like to see)
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,taffyowner,3,Wed Jun 17 04:45:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not fully against Arcia only DH'ing (and giving more outfield games to hicks).  I just want arcia's bat in the lineup (assuming he finds that power stroke again).  I like Hicks, hell... I own a shirt with his name on it... but i just don't see him as a starter.  I think with the right attitude he can make a long career in a bench role, I just don't think he's going to live up to his potential.   I would try to play all 5 guys a lot.  Possibly giving Rosario a few games at 2b... Mauer giving Sano days off at first... etc."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,chucktestlacoil,3,Wed Jun 17 04:52:55 2015 UTC,So what happens if Torii does not retire then? Thats the piece I can't figure out.
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,tcarr31,8,Wed Jun 17 03:36:40 2015 UTC,He's on a one year deal.  I just don't offer him a contract.  Is it cold?  Yeah.  But the twins aren't in a position to keep him around anymore.
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,chucktestlacoil,4,Wed Jun 17 03:42:26 2015 UTC,"I just dont see them not offering him a contract if he wants to come back, especially after how they went on and on about needing his veteran leadership."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,tcarr31,2,Wed Jun 17 03:51:41 2015 UTC,I would rather see Mauer as the full time DH/back up first baseman and catcher.  I think if he can hit .325 all will be well.  I believe he still has it in him.
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,incredibleridiculous,8,Wed Jun 17 05:07:51 2015 UTC,"He won't catch again in any capacity, though, nor should he."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,Khoops66,3,Wed Jun 17 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"I believe doctors told him to stop catching because concussions.  Hell, look at Morneau.  His last concussion he was diving for a ground ball and he's still having horrific, long lasting symptoms."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,dabecka,2,Wed Jun 17 19:51:48 2015 UTC,I think that the organization does overall recognize that and the fact that he will be replacing Kennys Vargas when he is called up proves that.
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,Heyitscharlie,2,Wed Jun 17 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"weird thought, but what abour mauer at 3b?  he's fairly agile and probably a great fielder.  just a thought."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,shiftyskies,3,Wed Jun 17 06:34:08 2015 UTC,Plouffe already entrenched there where he's an above average player both offensively and defensively.
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,dabecka,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:50:27 2015 UTC,oh right.  i sorta forgot about plouffe.
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,shiftyskies,3,Wed Jun 17 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you on Sano -- but what becomes of Kennys Vargas?  A guy with his kind of power (and at a young age) shouldn't be a career-DH type of guy.  As for Mauer, I move him to the LF (as you mentioned), and I even care if he's happy about it.  Every year, he's giving you less and less of a reason to support him.  It started out that he batted for power and average and gave you rock-star catching.  Then the power left.  Then he was moved out of catching.  And now the average is gone too.   He doesn't even give you clubhouse leadership.  All that's left is his boat-anchor contract."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,mattsoca,5,Wed Jun 17 12:28:20 2015 UTC,"Kenny Vargas is trade bait.  Use him to get a reliever or a pitching prospect.  There's a log jam if guys who can barely field, Kenny is the easiest to move."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,chucktestlacoil,5,Wed Jun 17 14:01:51 2015 UTC,"There's a log jam if guys who can barely field   Yeah they have a lot of guys can't play the field : Sano, Vargas, Arcia, Hunter, Pinto, Nunez....."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,RobertService,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"You can deal with guys who can't play the field if they can hit about everywhere except up the middle (Catcher, SS, CF).  Hell, Miggy played 3B two years ago.  If Arcia and Vargas aren't hitting for a .650 OPS, then they don't deserve a spot at all -- then you'd rather have Hicks in the corners because he'll bring defensive and baserunning value."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,dabecka,2,Wed Jun 17 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"If you aren't hitting for a .650 OPS you had damned well better be a good defender, because god knows you aren't a good hitter."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,agrueeatedu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:09:28 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on moving Plouffe and keeping Sano at third?   Personally, I cringe at the thought--I like Plouffe.  He's shown the hard work and dedication to improve his defensive game and he hits for power and his average is decent.    Think of what his numbers could be if he was more protected at the plate (surrounded by better batters).  The thought that intrigues me is that Plouffe is a quality 3rd baseman in his prime and I think you could get some significant talent back by moving him."
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,mattsoca,3,Wed Jun 17 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"I think Sano can play 3rd temporarily (2ish years), but he's better off continuing to build muscle and not worry about staying limber enough to play 3rd"
minnesotatwins,3a48oc,chucktestlacoil,-1,Wed Jun 17 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"here's a free tip.  Batting average is the most overrated statistic in baseball.  Look at alternative stats, like OPS and OPS+, ISO power, and slugging."

minnesotatwins,3a48oc,Manndrake,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"They expect him to play 3rd base when he gets here. Missing most of last season when he began to learn to play 3rd base didn't help him, so he's still learning the position most likely. I wouldn't be surprised if making sure he was comfortable playing 3rd is the only reason he isn't here already."

minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,ajdragoon,2,Wed Jun 17 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"I already have a Mauer, so it would have to be big Doz."
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,rydethesnow,2,Wed Jun 17 22:38:10 2015 UTC,Just bought a Dozier jersey!! (Also got the free Hunter one vs the Brew Crew)
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,tennisspears,2,Thu Jun 18 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"For me, it is still Mauer (haven't bought a jersey since Mientkiewicz).  It was going to be Arcia, but he is really struggling to stay healthy.  Hoping to see Buxton do something incredible this week to change my mind."
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,MNBLIZZARD,2,Wed Jun 17 05:12:31 2015 UTC,"Perkins would always be a good bet too, if you are okay with having a RP's jersey. He'll probably be around for a while, is still one of the best closers in the league, and is a pretty cool guy in general."
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,inyourface_milwaukee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:44:56 2015 UTC,"Perkins is a hell of a player and from my hometown of Stillwater. However, I've heard he was a dick in high school and still is to an extent"
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,MNBLIZZARD,2,Wed Jun 17 14:53:28 2015 UTC,I worked in a temp job years back and a guy said he played with him on the Gopher teams. He looked and acted the part so I kind of believed him. He said Perk was a total asshole.
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,inyourface_milwaukee,2,Wed Jun 17 19:28:23 2015 UTC,My brother went to high school with him and I had his coach as a teacher. Both said the same thing
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,Agent-Cooper,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:23:02 2015 UTC,I love my Radke jersey!
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,steinamo,2,Wed Jun 17 19:26:10 2015 UTC,I've always wanted a Radke jersey. One of these days I'll actually pull the trigger and buy one.
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,guiltycitizen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:21:49 2015 UTC,I bought a Puckett on Aliexpress. Dozier is my next pick I think. Buxton down the line. Blyleven someday too.
minnesotatwins,3a4ot5,Yessirmrmonkey,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:02:05 2015 UTC,I have always wanted a game day jersey from Jackie Robinson day. it would also be sweet to have a TK.

minnesotatwins,3a22ds,AdaAstra,3,Tue Jun 16 17:14:52 2015 UTC,All the way over to dickinson pretty much
minnesotatwins,3a22ds,bandrica,2,Tue Jun 16 20:36:14 2015 UTC,So is western South Dakota.
minnesotatwins,3a22ds,fbarfins,2,Tue Jun 16 21:59:05 2015 UTC,Really?  When I was there they just kept showing the Rockies and not the Twins.  Maybe they finally extended it.
minnesotatwins,3a22ds,AdaAstra,2,Tue Jun 16 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"Both are in our market. This means no MLB.tv for the Twins or Rockies, meaning cord cutters well the hell out here like me have to use those shady streams that are posted in the game thread.  edit: it's been that way for at least 10 years."

minnesotatwins,3a22ds,jacktwo37,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:10:01 2015 UTC,Yes. Im on the eastern half but i get fsn north so it's understandable. It ridiculous when u don't get the games (assuming u have cable) and still cannot watch games.

minnesotatwins,3a22ds,FrankReynolds,4,Wed Jun 17 00:55:30 2015 UTC,"Twins fans inside the blackout zone who want to get around blackouts:  use a DNS instead of a VPN if all you want is to circumvent blackout restrictions.  A DNS does not have the bandwidth overhead of a VPN, and you will see literally zero speed loss.  A DNS is also very easy to set up directly on your router, so you can watch Twins games via MLB.TV on your secondary devices (PS3, Fire TV, etc.).  I've been using Ad-Free Time DNS for a few years and have had no issues getting around all local and nationwide blackouts for MLB.TV."
minnesotatwins,3a22ds,tcarr31,2,Tue Jun 16 21:32:21 2015 UTC,"Just signed up for this today, didn't even know they had a sale this week but was sure glad when I saw the lower price. I just couldn't stand not seeing the beginning of Byron's career."
minnesotatwins,3a22ds,calisto77,2,Wed Jun 17 01:43:42 2015 UTC,Yay! Another twins fan from indiana!

minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,TwinsGameday,6,Tue Jun 16 22:20:57 2015 UTC,I feel like these two games against the Cards have been pretty solid for us. We just need some clutch hitting from the bottom of the lineup.
minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,swashbucklerjak,4,Tue Jun 16 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"2 runs a game isn't solid. We are lacking offense, and most crucially clutch hitting. That's what allowed us to win so many games in may."
minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,FlannelBeard,2,Wed Jun 17 00:33:18 2015 UTC,I agree. We've also held the best team in the league to 3 runs. I'm still hopeful for this season but after watching 4 poor years I've come to appreciate improvement.
minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,swashbucklerjak,4,Wed Jun 17 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"They are more known more for their pitching than their hitting. They're currently 1st in ERA and 23rd in runs. Though, I agree with the previous guy, even if they are the best pitching team we should still be getting more than 2 if we want to stay relevant."
minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,forgetfulburglar,5,Wed Jun 17 03:39:53 2015 UTC,Another one run loss. Damn damn damn

minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,SplurgingSpurgeon,3,Wed Jun 17 07:14:14 2015 UTC,I think we could be friends...
minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,carsonr22,3,Wed Jun 17 07:47:54 2015 UTC,Cardinals are good but we're in free-fall right now :(
minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,tenthreeleader,2,Tue Jun 16 23:15:44 2015 UTC,Here's to hoping Mauer and some other hitters can get back tonight and get the necessary cuddles to produce some RUNS tomorrow!
minnesotatwins,3a3d2t,Khoops66,2,Wed Jun 17 00:05:26 2015 UTC,These close losses are real frustrating.

minnesotatwins,3a227f,50in15,2,Tue Jun 16 21:50:12 2015 UTC,Got home just to see the 9th. Thought Nunez's shot was out. Damn.

minnesotatwins,3a227f,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:21:58 2015 UTC,Well if you could have one person on base you want it to be Buxton.

minnesotatwins,3a227f,Capn_Barboza,3,Tue Jun 16 19:55:57 2015 UTC,You never see Mauer argue with the ump like that. He is just not the same player. Shave the beard   edit: I did not see where the pitch was though. Was the argument warranted?

minnesotatwins,3a227f,Gallade3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:30:18 2015 UTC,I think this just solidifies our thoughts about Gibby. Base hit!
minnesotatwins,3a227f,Slapachimp,2,Tue Jun 16 19:42:32 2015 UTC,I agree with you! He definitely has a bright future that's for sure

minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,jcwitte,16,Wed Jun 17 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"We're playing good teams, other than the Brew crew.  We weren't going to be able to sustain that clutch hitting that we rode all month long.  I'm concerned but not too much.  The big ? for me is Mauer.  What the fuck is going on there?  I don't buy the ""best I've felt in a long time"" line.  I'm wondering if he's got some issues from his concussion that he's trying to hide/play through?  Besides, if they freefall to the basement of the division again, which I don't think they will, there is always the Lynx until Football and Hockey start back up."
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,quickie440,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"Other than the Sox, too."
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,ajdragoon,-5,Wed Jun 17 01:49:01 2015 UTC,You know that if Mauer were hurt he'd be sitting. He's never been shy about pulling himself out when he didn't feel 100%. I think he's just aging and his bat has slowed down. I also don't think he has the highest standards or work ethic. He's spend enough years on a losing team that it doesn't even bother him. I'm waiting for Hunter to take a swing at him in the clubhouse and wake him up.
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,7Finger,10,Wed Jun 17 16:28:15 2015 UTC,"I don't buy that BS about his work ethic or standards, just because he doesn't scream or take his shirt off doesn't mean he doesn't care. I'm glad to have Torii's attitude back on the team, but that's just not who Mauer is. There's nothing to suggest he is complacent with losing or not giving 100%.  Gleeman wrote a really interesting article detailing the drop off in production since his concussion. It's eye opening, and it may very well be that he feels fine, but his reaction time and hand-eye coordination are not what they were pre-concussion."
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,JeffreyG0042,6,Wed Jun 17 17:04:25 2015 UTC,"I can't say anything about his work ethic.  Give the guy a break.  He spent 10 years catching and went through concussion problems (BRAIN INJURIES).  Yes, the Twins WAAAAY overpaid him.  But he's earned the playing time, lets see how he gets to the ASB."
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,dabecka,12,Wed Jun 17 19:49:51 2015 UTC,"Weve really just been lucky, and luck runs out."
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,Jarl_Bridgewater,5,Wed Jun 17 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Hits were coming in bunches, now they're not.  It was a fun month, but unfortunately this stretch is more representative of the overall talent of this club.    I think with the expanded wild card the Twins will stay relevant though.  Hopefully they'll have a clear picture by the deadline so they can make the right moves."
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,chucktestlacoil,5,Wed Jun 17 02:47:28 2015 UTC,"How are some of you surprised?  I mean, there was merit in what all the people said about the Twins playing above their level.  The stats just didn't support how well the Twins did in May.  Our biggest problem is some of our top hitters that are not producing.  Mauer and Plouffe are really struggling to help us much.  Our starting pitching has kept us in so many games, yet our offense fails to deliver.  I can't fault our bull pen too much, but they have also struggled in a couple games we should have won.  There is still alot of baseball left.  The Royals, Rangers, and Cardinals are some of the top teams in baseball, so it is not surprising they are beating us.  Just be happy that for most of those games, we are still keeping within a run or two instead of last year of getting blown out like every loss."
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,AdaAstra,2,Wed Jun 17 05:24:31 2015 UTC,"The Twins rank 20th in Offensive OPS and something like 24th in Opposing OPS.  We're stupid lucky so far this year.    Half the lineup isn't producing.  The Twins are starting utility infielders at DH (Nunez, Escobar) in some games.  Kennys Vargas, Danny Santana, and other young fixtures have failed to produce.  Joe Mauer is hitting with a banjo.  The starting lineup isn't striking anyone out.  Outside of Dozier, Plouffe, Hunter and most of the bullpen, the Twins are not performing up to par (jury still out on Buxton and Rosario)."
minnesotatwins,3a3u9d,dabecka,3,Wed Jun 17 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"The Twins rank 20th in Offensive OPS and something like 24th in Opposing OPS. We're stupid lucky so far this year.   I noticed these numbers a couple weeks ago, too. As well as the fact that Nolasco had a bunch of wins with a terrible ERA -- he just happened to always get a bunch of run support. A huge amount of lucky pitching matchups as well as well timed hits and jam-escaping defense."
minnesotatwins,3a0661,novafire08,19,Tue Jun 16 04:55:16 2015 UTC,My god he is fast.
minnesotatwins,3a0661,dabecka,10,Tue Jun 16 05:28:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was looking at his minor league stats, and wow, he had something like 60 hits with 12 triples.  Are you serious?"
minnesotatwins,3a0661,southsideson,8,Tue Jun 16 06:05:35 2015 UTC,67 hits with 12 triples. It's insane
minnesotatwins,3a0661,best_from_midwest,8,Tue Jun 16 06:44:51 2015 UTC,"Standing up on a typical gap shot. No ball stuck at the base of the wall or bouncing in the corner. Just a normal liner to the wall. He was on 2nd by the time they got to the ball. I hope he develops a strong game at the plate, because damn it will be fun to watch him wreak havoc on the bases."

Jorge Polanco did it last year, and the Royals had a guy earlier this season that did this as well. So, that makes for at least three recent examples, I'm sure there are others as well."

minnesotatwins,3a0661,FaulktheBlueRedbird,9,Tue Jun 16 12:39:53 2015 UTC,Seriously. He was going so hard he almost took out Reynolds rounding 1st.

minnesotatwins,3a0661,DaDoviende,2,Tue Jun 16 17:39:53 2015 UTC,So fitting his first hit was a triple. Pretty sure he was already at 1sr by the time the ball landed.

It was a pretty brutal game by the mid innings. I do remember discussing whether we should leave early with the other guy. We'd never left a game early in our lives, but we thought the three women were getting antsy. Turns out they really wanted to stay, so we did. It's a top 5 baseball moment for me.  Oh, and Morneau was really slow, huh."
minnesotatwins,39x2ck,mhfesq,2,Mon Jun 15 15:29:04 2015 UTC,"I was there, too. This was the same season that Cuddyer hit for the cycle, and I happened to be at that game also, so I always get the two games mixed up in my head, but if I remember right I was sitting with a couple friends in the upper deck along the 3rd base line.   Edit: After watching the video, yeah I definitely remember correctly. I remember watching it fly towards the Twins HoF section."
minnesotatwins,39x2ck,innesota2,8,Thu Jun 18 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"Kubel is one of my biggest Twins ""what could've been"" players after blowing up his knee in the AFL. I remember reading that if that injury had happened 15 years earlier it would've ended his career.   The fact that he still became a pretty good player despite it shows the talent he had. His numbers before the injury in AAA are just stupid good."

minnesotatwins,39x2ck,Kruse,3,Mon Jun 15 16:05:15 2015 UTC,I was at this game! I love Jason Kubel so much and I miss him desperately. I've seen two Grand Slams ever... The other one was Kirby Puckett.

minnesotatwins,39x2ck,dorky2,3,Mon Jun 15 21:27:07 2015 UTC,One of the reasons I like Bremer is because he lets the great moments tell themselves. He makes the call and then shuts up and let's the fans take over

I like that it isn't ""the best"" you can hit (you could just hit 4 home runs), but its got its own little special feel to it, and it shows you're a well rounded player, capable of hitting a home run and a triple (arguably harder)."

minnesotatwins,39z46g,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,0,Tue Jun 16 03:11:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that does take the sting away. But man, I feel we'd have been in a better position if MLB Umpires can actually FUCKING CALL SHIT.   Someone needs to invent some holographic representation of the strike zone so we don't have to rely on someone's aging eyes and opinion.  Edit: Those of you downvoting obviously didn't watch the fucking game; and if you did, I have no idea why you would take the side of a blind-ass idiot that calls strikes as balls and vice versa.  Edit 2: I feel like NotPercyChuggs/RobertService all of a sudden, except I'm not saying the Twins suck or will regress like crazy."
minnesotatwins,39z46g,BrianDoziersHair,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:14:39 2015 UTC,I upvoted. Ump was so inconsistent
minnesotatwins,39z46g,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Tue Jun 16 04:43:47 2015 UTC,"I thank you for that, but I guess the karma really doesn't matter; I'm just annoyed that the downvotes are coming without reasonable explanation or countering opinion."
minnesotatwins,39z46g,BrianDoziersHair,2,Tue Jun 16 04:51:37 2015 UTC,"Meeh, umps make bad calls on both sides.  We will notice ours more than the other team's bad calls. Every team can attribute wins/losses due to bad calls.   Just part of the game.  Doesn't make it right, but complaining about the ump is kind of a moot point as both teams have to deal with it."
minnesotatwins,39z46g,AdaAstra,2,Tue Jun 16 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"True enough, but is it so much to ask for a tech that allows the Ump to see a virtual representation of the strike zone in order to allow for better calls, and therefore no team has to deal with that?"
minnesotatwins,39z46g,BrianDoziersHair,2,Tue Jun 16 05:17:26 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but it will take years to implement. Replacing the ump for calling the pitches would not happen for a long time.  And if they used said trackers to say, challenge a call on a pitch, the conditions on challenging that are going to get annoying quick.  Even the trackers today can be off, even though they are not really designed to be ""official"".   I would like to see the umps be more accurate as much as the next guy, but outside some initial grumblings when it happens, I understand it is just part of the game.  We have won games on bad calls by umps, and we have lost them.  Some seasons seem luckier than others in that regards."
minnesotatwins,39z46g,AdaAstra,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying we need to take Umpires out of the game; rather, I'm asking for something that can enable Umpires to call pitches with more precise accuracy. (Does ""precise accuracy"" sound redundant as hell?)  Regardless, I'm in agreement with you."

From season 1 to season 6 he is referred to as Jerry (even suggesting his mother called him ""Gerald""), for which reason the character is usually referred to by this name in external media; for most of season 6 he is called Larry; from the end of season 6 through much of season 7 he is called Terry; and only near the end of the series is his true name restored.  Jerry has appeared in every episode of the series, with the exception of the first season episode ""Canvassing"". He was credited as a recurring character for the first two seasons, but was promoted to the main cast beginning with season three. He first appeared in the opening credits/theme in the season six episode ""Anniversaries"", following the departures of cast members Rashida Jones and Rob Lowe.

minnesotatwins,39z46g,kaiserj1982,4,Tue Jun 16 01:20:11 2015 UTC,How many times has joe missed the play at second? He made that heads up throw to Dozier last game though.
minnesotatwins,39z46g,Khoops66,5,Tue Jun 16 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"I would not call it missed. It would have been a risky turn still, definitely not an automatic double-play had he turned."
minnesotatwins,39z46g,Derk-Derks,2,Tue Jun 16 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"Just noticed we have at least one starter who leads the team in a pitching category on our sidebar. Pretty cool. Or maybe not, it could be super lame I don't know, it's too early to be sure."

minnesotatwins,39z46g,50in15,4,Tue Jun 16 01:02:54 2015 UTC,I like Perk. I wish he could have squirted his bottle.

minnesotatwins,39z46g,inyourface_milwaukee,4,Tue Jun 16 01:07:30 2015 UTC,And ball continues to go towards our lord and savior Buxton!  He giveth and he sure as hell taketh!

minnesotatwins,39zxmd,Khoops66,3,Tue Jun 16 03:59:47 2015 UTC,No Buxton Triple Highlight? Sad Panda
minnesotatwins,39zxmd,peanman,3,Tue Jun 16 04:04:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty bad last two weeks this club.  I don't even have the heart to look at our batting average or W-L record over that time frame but it's been tough to watch.    What happened to the Twins' hitting?  Escobar and Plouffe were coming up big, Hunter was hitting bombs and Mauer was on pace for 100 RBI....aside from Dozier, there's absolutely nobody hitting for the Twins right now and it's scary to think how far they might fall if they don't right this ship."
minnesotatwins,39zxmd,CentralAmerican,2,Tue Jun 16 15:40:59 2015 UTC,Still fucking salty at the Ump.
minnesotatwins,39zxmd,BrianDoziersHair,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:44:10 2015 UTC,"Starting to fade away now, 2-8 of our last 10. Tigers now half a game back from taking second place. We've played some tough teams, but losing a series at home to the Brewers, who are pretty terrible, and then losing to good teams kind of starts to give weight to the theory of us not belonging. Can't get it done against good teams, definitely can't get to the playoffs. I hope we can start to head back in the right direction. A lot of them have been close games."
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,dabecka,5,Mon Jun 15 16:59:08 2015 UTC,Will be really disappointed if he doesn't make the all-star team this year. He really deserves it.
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,RichardManuel,2,Mon Jun 15 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"Some of it will depend on who will be representing each team.  We know Perkins is a lock so Yost doesn't have to pick another Twin. I'm not sure who's playing well for the Indians but if Kipnis is the only stud then he'll go if Infante wins the vote (shudder).  I really hope Dozier gets in, he's ballin out of control this year.  Most runs, 2Bs, HRs, RBIs, and best SLG among AL 2B to this point."
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,4,Tue Jun 16 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"He won't, it is a popularity contest (i.e. who plays for the big market teams).  Last I checked he wasn't even in the Top 5, something they need to change so that the ASG isn't so stupid these days."
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,11,Mon Jun 15 18:31:27 2015 UTC,It's a joke this year... the Royals are voting the worst 2nd baseman in the league in...
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,ItsThisEasy,6,Mon Jun 15 19:27:26 2015 UTC,The worst qualified hitter in the league.
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,Brananorama,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:44:06 2015 UTC,I voted for Infante only because the only way the ASG voting will change is to first make a mockery of it. I personally don't think it should be 100% up to the fans. I think the Baseball Writers Association should have some say. Make it like 50/50 fans/writers conclusion.
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,A_Little_Off_Center,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:25:56 2015 UTC,There's only one way to truly fix it: let the players vote.  They won't be swayed by big markets or voting for a name because he used to be good.  They'll look at everyone's numbers and defensive ability and put the right people in 9 times out of 10.  Players vote two weeks before the game and that's that. My two cents. Or a players/managers/writers combo.
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,4,Tue Jun 16 20:33:07 2015 UTC,That's for the starters. The rest of the team is picked by player votes and manager selections.
minnesotatwins,39xlfo,novafire08,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"As the article mentions, the Twins made a good move locking him down 'til at least 2018 (he'll still become a free agent after that, but I don't think he'll jump ship.)"
minnesotatwins,39xt8b,tsaylor83,3,Mon Jun 15 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"He's on pace for the second-most RBI (90) in his career because Dozier and Hunter are getting on in front of him. Adversely, he is on pace to score 62 runs, which is the second-lowest of his career in seasons in which he plays more than 100 games.  He has a more aggressive approach at the plate this year, which is causing him to chase more pitches, and he is getting more pitches to chase because pitchers don't have to worry about walking him with Morneau up after him, and Cuddyer/Kubel behind him.  Plouffe isn't hitting poorly, but he's not Morneau in the late 2000's.   My theory is that we will see a much better Mauer when Sano is up hitting fourth behind him, and Plouffe, Vargas or Rosario are hitting fifth. Put a legitimate power threat (30+ HR) behind him and you'll see him bat .310+ again."
minnesotatwins,39xt8b,Rossbury,6,Tue Jun 16 14:24:57 2015 UTC,"I think he's still pret-ty, pret-ty, pret-ty good."
minnesotatwins,39xt8b,guiltycitizen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"I've heard from a lot of analysts that he has had a problem with trying to play through injuries too much after he spent a lot of time on the DL in 2010/2011. If you look at his stats following a day off, they are noticeably higher. Not that it is an excuse for hitting in the mid .200 range, but a lot of it has to do with plain physical degradation. He still strikes out less than most players, which shows he is still mentally sharp."
minnesotatwins,39xt8b,Kripzo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:41:57 2015 UTC,I think there is still concussion issues combined with some over 30-type physical skill degradation.    I want to know how much time he spends in the weight room.
minnesotatwins,39xt8b,dabecka,0,Tue Jun 16 05:34:04 2015 UTC,"Hes not very good at baseball anymore. The only thing he had going for him was being able to hit for average and play catcher.  Now that he is playing first base, he is below replacement level and will be for the rest of his career."

minnesotatwins,39xc4v,dabecka,2,Mon Jun 15 17:03:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought about doing that, didn't know if there was another way though since the custom stuff is much more expensive.  EDIT: I didnt mean going counterfeit, I meant going custom from the twins pro shop."
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,-8,Mon Jun 15 17:20:09 2015 UTC,AliExpress jerseys are counterfeit.
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,Phillyboy101,4,Mon Jun 15 19:05:11 2015 UTC,The counterfeit ones are just as nice at a fraction of the cost.
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,-11,Mon Jun 15 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"I've seen counterfeit jerseys before, they're not even close to the same quality.  Edit: Wow, downvoting a person for not supporting illegal merchandise."
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,Kripzo,5,Mon Jun 15 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"Still more genuine than that $200 price tag slapped on the ""authentic"" jerseys."
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,-6,Mon Jun 15 22:49:44 2015 UTC,What the fuck does that even mean?
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,Kripzo,9,Mon Jun 15 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"People know they are fake when buying them. They are choosing to buy them instead of official apparel because the prices marked up by the twins are ridiculous. By telling people AliExpress jerseys are counterfit, you aren't telling them something new, you're just judging them for making a purchasing decision. Which is why you will get downvotes. Sorry dude."
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,dabecka,3,Mon Jun 15 23:56:57 2015 UTC,I personally think the quality of the jerseys are pretty damn good for the price.  I've never had a problem with them.   The jerseys are made basically in the same factories in China.  The markup is stupid ridiculous.
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,-5,Tue Jun 16 00:41:16 2015 UTC,Marked up by the Twins? Every team's jerseys cost the same price.
minnesotatwins,39xc4v,Kripzo,5,Tue Jun 16 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"The organization decides the price, which is my point. The jersey the Twins sell is not at a quality that merits a price tag of 10x an AliExpress Jersey.  Edit: Also, go check the price of an Atheltics jersey, then the price of a Twins jersey. Were they the same price? No, they weren't, because most Athletics jerseys are around $180, compared to the Twins, who sell most of their jerseys over $200.  Second Edit: I don't really care about this. People can spend money however they want."

I got one particularly grumpy employee who said ""He just started yesterday, sir."" and added ""I have no way of knowing when they'll show up it's hit or miss blah blah"". Well how long did it take to make up the other new shirts in the past? Come on."

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,Derk-Derks,3,Sun Jun 14 21:49:17 2015 UTC,I'm convinced the reason Mauer can't hit without runners on base anymore is because he can't adjust to the outfield shift he usually gets.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,agrueeatedu,2,Sun Jun 14 21:49:05 2015 UTC,"It's his bat speed. He can't get it around as fast, so he has to guess or commit earlier, leading to weaker contact and more strikeouts"

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,tennisspears,2,Sun Jun 14 21:41:25 2015 UTC,A bunt has to happen here
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,Rossbury,2,Sun Jun 14 21:39:14 2015 UTC,Fuck yes!  Alright Buxton.....lets make people know that Buxton has arrived!

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,hail_termite_queen,2,Sun Jun 14 21:36:14 2015 UTC,Just setting up for Buxton heroics.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jun 14 21:38:44 2015 UTC,Also the first time we've had three triples in an inning. So in true Twins fashion they had to screw it up.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sun Jun 14 21:29:32 2015 UTC,Buxton probably could have scored on that.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,agrueeatedu,2,Sun Jun 14 21:23:29 2015 UTC,"Until he gets on base it's all speculation, but I've been saying that about every out this game haha."

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,kaiserj1982,2,Sun Jun 14 21:23:41 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the St. Paul Saints have tweeted about Buxton more than the Twins have.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,Rossbury,2,Sun Jun 14 21:22:02 2015 UTC,Bert being mean to dick again. This is awesome.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,cadderly09,4,Sun Jun 14 21:21:20 2015 UTC,The Twins are making a big mistake not batting Buxton in every spot of the lineup.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,zeitfalle,3,Sun Jun 14 21:17:52 2015 UTC,Gotta get him some reps against that major league curve!
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,5,Sun Jun 14 21:19:35 2015 UTC,How cool would it be to call ghost runners in an MLB game?

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,-2,Sun Jun 14 21:12:16 2015 UTC,Fein fucks his own team right up the ass without foreplay with a quick walk to open things up.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,CentralAmerican,5,Sun Jun 14 21:08:26 2015 UTC,He pitched just Fein
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,Rossbury,4,Sun Jun 14 21:16:16 2015 UTC,And then he shows he is one of only a couple Twins pitchers who can actually strike people out.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,tennisspears,2,Sun Jun 14 21:12:25 2015 UTC,Yeah fuck that guy.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,5,Sun Jun 14 21:13:17 2015 UTC,Well then.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,ChiefakaJames,3,Sun Jun 14 21:08:58 2015 UTC,Thank goodness Smolinsky can't bunt.

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,hail_termite_queen,4,Sun Jun 14 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"We should make it like Jackie Robinson day in here, 25 flair everywhere."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sun Jun 14 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"Just a few mistakes for Hughes, some solid innings, not a terrible outing."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sun Jun 14 21:05:24 2015 UTC,That is the story of our starting rotation.  Usually 1 bad game for every 3 good outings.

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,Tannekr,3,Sun Jun 14 21:10:35 2015 UTC,I feel like Mauer needs a day or two off.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,tennisspears,2,Sun Jun 14 21:02:16 2015 UTC,I feel like the whole team needs a day or two off.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sun Jun 14 21:02:47 2015 UTC,Torii wishes he hadn't gotten suspended right now I bet. He'd have a 2 HR game at this point with all the hanging curveballs.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,agrueeatedu,2,Sun Jun 14 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"We will need him for the Cardinals.  That team is probably going to stomp all over us regardless, but Hunter is one of our better players we need in that series."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jun 14 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"Can we all agree if Phil Hughes was a basketball player, he would be Nikola Pekovic."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,tokomini,3,Sun Jun 14 20:53:44 2015 UTC,"Buxton is basically learning on the job up here...he's only seen advanced breaking balls for 60 or so games, which is not enough to adjust. We need to keep this in mind- he'll struggle with them for a while. Hopefully he can do enough with his speed, but bringing him up this early means that we have to watch him adjust. Even Trout played 90 games at AA, and struggled in his first stint in the bigs."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,hail_termite_queen,3,Sun Jun 14 20:53:43 2015 UTC,Weird...someone sent me this exact same thing in a text message minutes ago.

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,agrueeatedu,2,Sun Jun 14 20:55:24 2015 UTC,He was also well over a year younger than Buxton is now
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,pman5595,3,Sun Jun 14 21:13:54 2015 UTC,Buxton also lost a year of development time.

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sun Jun 14 20:50:52 2015 UTC,I wish I knew how to use Play Index better so I could figure out run production with 3+ triples.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun Jun 14 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought you meant this season. I had trouble with that for a moment."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,Tannekr,3,Sun Jun 14 20:53:46 2015 UTC,"Good work, Detective."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,Rossbury,3,Sun Jun 14 20:53:36 2015 UTC,Holy shit. 9 triples in a game? Did the other team only have one outfielder playing?
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,tennisspears,6,Sun Jun 14 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"It was 1894 so for all I know, yes."

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,Derk-Derks,3,Sun Jun 14 20:47:31 2015 UTC,He really has trouble with that curve.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,agrueeatedu,3,Sun Jun 14 20:47:29 2015 UTC,Santana? Is that you?
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sun Jun 14 20:48:10 2015 UTC,?

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,cadderly09,6,Sun Jun 14 20:46:42 2015 UTC,Three triples in one inning resulting in 1 run.
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,OrbitsUnbounded,2,Sun Jun 14 20:46:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty unbelievable.  The Twins can't afford bad baserunning, errors, stuff like that.  Play a solid game and unlike last year we have a chance to win.  Make stupid mistakes on the road against a good hitting team and it's trouble."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,CentralAmerican,3,Sun Jun 14 20:49:17 2015 UTC,Would have been a nice RBI for Eddie there...........
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,togu12,2,Sun Jun 14 20:46:00 2015 UTC,"Did he miss the tag? I couldn't see the tag from that angle, but it definitely looked to me like he should have been out.  EDIT: Nope, not even close."

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,CentralAmerican,5,Sun Jun 14 20:45:41 2015 UTC,This game is getting to some special kinda stupid level.

minnesotatwins,39tqwi,tokomini,3,Sun Jun 14 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"Everyone criticizing Robinson, and it was probably entirely Escobar's fault."
minnesotatwins,39tqwi,tennisspears,2,Sun Jun 14 20:45:32 2015 UTC,When Buxton hits him home we'll all forget about it.  :(

minnesotatwins,39qz4v,Rossbury,4,Sat Jun 13 22:26:29 2015 UTC,Tweaked? Maybe his pride is hurt from missing that damn ball.

minnesotatwins,39qz4v,FrankReynolds,-1,Sat Jun 13 23:34:57 2015 UTC,"...what? You're really choosing to say that after they called Buxton up after 60 AA games? Guess how many games Trout played in AA? 91.   Bryce isn't really comparable, as he was drafted out of college...  Buxton would have been up from spring training if he had stayed healthy last year. They brought Hicks up early straight out of AA, didn't work out. They gave Polanco a cup of coffee out of A+ last year. Your buddy's wrong.    Harper and Trout, who are basically the biggest hitting phenoms we've seen in a decade or two, would very much be with the Twins and are not good comparison points regardless. The Twins have shown that they'll reward guys for playing well in the minors."
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,hail_termite_queen,5,Sun Jun 14 00:03:41 2015 UTC,I don't think he ever really meant it to be taken literally.

minnesotatwins,39qz4v,hail_termite_queen,0,Sun Jun 14 04:51:43 2015 UTC,"Amen.   Yet, back in the day, the Twins let Luis Rivas get a bazillion at bats because of his comps from when he was 21. Thing is, not many players play at age 21, so just because you were foolish enough to call him up early, doesn't mean he's good.  Buxton is different though. He was actually good in the minors."

minnesotatwins,39qz4v,Kripzo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:36:13 2015 UTC,is this a panic move (I know its early)? They are playing terrible. Thoughts?
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,eaphilipp,2,Sun Jun 14 00:02:59 2015 UTC,He's been tearing it up since his slow start. It's not too early. I love the decision.
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,handofluke,4,Sun Jun 14 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"The only reason in my opinion that this even could be questioned as a panic move is because of how conservative the Twins always are.  I'd like to think this is Molitor's influence saying ""what the fuck guys -- we might have the best player on our team in the minor leagues.""  I read earlier this year (before they were playing well) that people thought he'd be called up in August.  So it's a bit earlier than that but only 2 months early.  I think it's a matter of saying ""we can make a trade or we can bring up Byron.  So...is he ready?""  Yes, he's ready."
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,HAL9000000,5,Sun Jun 14 05:52:33 2015 UTC,Very surprising to me and seems a bit early but FUCK YEAH!  Let's go!
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,J-Hal,2,Sun Jun 14 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"The next few weeks are really going to make or break our chances, I think its perfect to get him up right now. He cant hurt us in CF and if things go great we are back in it and if they go south he gets 100 games in the bigs."
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,inyourface_milwaukee,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:48:47 2015 UTC,I agree. Hopefully he takes off right away.  We have something cooking if he does. He's very young still but by all accounts this kid was born to play baseball. Tomorrow's game is a must watch!

minnesotatwins,39qz4v,meat_tub,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"On KFAN last week, there was somebody talking about Twins and possible moves, and he was saying that the Twins farm system is basically as strong as if you combined the second and third best farm systems together.  That's pretty amazing.  The ranking you posted though is pretty amazing, when you look at the fact that basically in the top 31 on average, every team would have 1 player, and we have 6, not to mention we have the #1, who I believe is a head and shoulders #1, not like he's kind of in the wash with the other top 10s.  I've heard scouts say of Buxton that he is the most talented minor leaguer that they've seen in the last 20 years."

minnesotatwins,39qz4v,meat_tub,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"This is frankly surprising. I don't want the team to risk putting prospects' futures in jeopardy just because we have a fluky winning record right now. If Bucky flounders and needs to be sent down, we start his clock early and potentially waste a year of control for nothing. He has been crushing the ball for a couple of weeks, but has been very up and down this year.  That said, I'm pumped. He has a ceiling like no prospect we've seen and will immediately improve the outfield defense. The Buxton era starts tomorrow!"
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,hail_termite_queen,12,Sat Jun 13 22:37:06 2015 UTC,Quit worrying about Pohlad's wallet & enjoy it.
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,chucktestlacoil,2,Sat Jun 13 22:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not. I'm worried about a combination bringing a guy up too early and controlling him for as long as possible into his prime. The way contracts work in the MLB you have to consider these things. Obviously if he stays with us for his career it doesn't matter, but that's far from a sure thing and he can leave after our team control runs out.   I wouldn't have brought him up this early. His hit tool has been the biggest question. If he hits, great, but if not it potentially has pretty big ramifications.   Regardless, I most definitely will enjoy it."
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,hail_termite_queen,-3,Sat Jun 13 22:46:18 2015 UTC,"Of all the major 2012 MLB draft picks, Buxton will be the last one called up - so no, it's not too early."
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,phernoree,5,Sat Jun 13 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"He also basically missed an entire year. He would be playing for us right now, but was injured most of last year. I know Correa was too, but Correa also OPS'd like 1.200 at AA. Buxton was a lot more inconsistent...even Mike Trout played 90 games at AA and then struggled when he was called up."
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,hail_termite_queen,3,Sat Jun 13 23:41:33 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly fair. Compared to other high schoolers in the 2012 draft, he's just the 5th from the 1st round, and the four in front of him we just called up this year.  It could very well be too early (we probably won't know for a while), but it's not out of question, considering who else has been called up to this point."
minnesotatwins,39qz4v,AaronGNP,0,Sat Jun 13 23:46:18 2015 UTC,"If he struggles, then he can be sent back down - it's not nearly as big of a deal as you're making it."

minnesotatwins,39qew1,AdaAstra,3,Sat Jun 13 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"Colby Lewis on the mound for the Rangers. 5-pitch RHP. Four-seamer and sinker both go up to 92mph, while sitting around 89. Those two combine for 60% of his usage. There's also a big slider that Lewis throws 25% of the time, 82-86mph, curve at 75-79mph used 9%, and finally a change-up at 82-86mph used 5%.  Left-handers go against all five, a four-seamer comes first pitch to them 46% of the time, and Lewis will throw the fastball and sinker when he's getting behind, also likes to trick batters with a change-up most often when he's behind. The slider and curve are there to finish off batters, 31% slider with two strikes, then 16-20% curve with two strikes or when he's ahead. LHH whiff most against the slider at 11% whiff, and the change at 8% whiff. His sinker and change are also at very high line drive rates at over 8% each. LHH have a .375 OppAVG against the change-up this year, and .333 against the slider (along with 7 XBH in 36 AB).  Right-handers have it a bit easier in terms of type of pitches faced, but struggling a lot more than lefties. Lewis doesn't throw the change-up at all to RHH, and has a very limited amount of sinker and curves against them this season, too. So RHH have the four-seamer to face – a pitch that's thrown 64% first pitch, 65% when he's behind, and still over 50% in any other count. Then there's the slider that is thrown 47% with two strikes, 37% when Lewis is ahead, and still around 30% early in counts, too. Even with that, RHH are whiffing on his slider 24.49% this season, and another 8.94% whiff on his four-seamer. RHH are hitting .229 against the four-seamer (11 hits to 11 Ks), and .212 against the slider (11 hits to 23 Ks).  On the season, Lewis is 5-3 with a 4.42 ERA (3.62 FIP), 55 strikeouts to 16 walks in 73.1 IP. A cool stat from MLB.com - “The Twins are the only AL team besides the Rangers that Lewis has never beaten in his career. He is 0-5 with a lifetime 7.28 ERA in seven starts and four relief appearances against them.”  Twins lineup vs. Colby Lewis -   Dozier: 0 for 3, 1 K  Rosario: Never faced  Mauer: 5 for 11, 1 HR, 1 BB, 2 K  Plouffe: Never faced  Vargas: Never faced  Nunez: Never faced  Herrmann: Never faced   Escobar: 1 for 2, 1 double, 1 K  Robinson: Never faced"

minnesotatwins,39qew1,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 13 20:27:10 2015 UTC,Awh are you fucking kidding me? I thought that kicked off the catcher. :(
minnesotatwins,39qew1,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 13 20:28:42 2015 UTC,Ugh.....damnit.
minnesotatwins,39qew1,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 13 20:29:46 2015 UTC,Cool.

minnesotatwins,39qew1,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Sat Jun 13 20:50:39 2015 UTC,Yup!
minnesotatwins,39qew1,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 13 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"God, Vargas makes that bat look tiny."
minnesotatwins,39qew1,Tannekr,2,Sat Jun 13 20:50:51 2015 UTC,Kennys falls victim to the makeup call.
minnesotatwins,39qew1,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jun 13 20:51:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I'll allow it.   It is only fair for giving us 3 runs.....  Hunter won't be charging the field with no shirt after that."
minnesotatwins,39qew1,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 13 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how ""makeup"" that was. Half the ball caught the plate."

minnesotatwins,39qew1,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 13 20:52:50 2015 UTC,Not a bad day when you get your car runnin' with pops and get to day drink during a ball game. Let's get a Twins WIN to cap it off.
minnesotatwins,39qew1,Khoops66,2,Sat Jun 13 21:00:03 2015 UTC,Plouffe looked so frustrated on that play.
minnesotatwins,39qew1,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jun 13 21:01:17 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah Plouffe nice play. Way to get out of it Pelf
minnesotatwins,39qew1,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Sat Jun 13 21:05:18 2015 UTC,3 for 3 in double plays saving this from being a lot worse.
minnesotatwins,39qew1,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jun 13 21:05:22 2015 UTC,"Well done, Plouffe."
minnesotatwins,39qew1,Tannekr,2,Sat Jun 13 21:06:10 2015 UTC,Pelfrey is the GIDP Gawd.

minnesotatwins,39qew1,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jun 13 21:35:59 2015 UTC,Wait why is Nunez at short and Escobar in left field?
minnesotatwins,39qew1,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Sat Jun 13 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"Hunter gave up on his appeal, so filling in positions was an apparent crap shoot"
minnesotatwins,39qew1,Khoops66,2,Sat Jun 13 21:26:08 2015 UTC,Yeah but I thought Nunez would be the better outfielder
minnesotatwins,39qew1,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Sat Jun 13 21:27:26 2015 UTC,He is definitely compared to Escobar. Don't know what Molitor's reasoning was for that.

minnesotatwins,39nou2,Nopeyesok,6,Sat Jun 13 01:48:36 2015 UTC,That's not the reason for the suspension. It's the contact with the first base umpire. Which was initiated by the umpire so it's pretty much bullshit.
minnesotatwins,39nou2,Ricky_Droschmidt,2,Sat Jun 13 02:28:52 2015 UTC,I like how he was pushing Hunter away the whole time and the second Torii raises his arm the ump acted like Torii was going to swing at him. I hate that shit.
minnesotatwins,39nou2,konvalbr,0,Sat Jun 13 04:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his actions went a bit far.   The contact initiated by that waddling fuck of a first base ump was an unnecessary act. Just as unnecessary as hunter undressing himself on the field."

minnesotatwins,39n7vh,tennisspears,8,Sat Jun 13 02:39:15 2015 UTC,It wasn't his fault....Hicks should have caught that.

minnesotatwins,39n7vh,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Sat Jun 13 02:39:02 2015 UTC,I wish I could say it was Duensing.
minnesotatwins,39n7vh,Derk-Derks,4,Sat Jun 13 02:40:10 2015 UTC,So now we're going to act like Hicks is a scrub again? Get real. He made a mistake.

minnesotatwins,39n7vh,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 13 02:35:33 2015 UTC,Worst case scenario. Duensing gets a pass while Hicks will be hated again.
minnesotatwins,39n7vh,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat Jun 13 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Duensing should have caught that ball"
minnesotatwins,39n7vh,MINNYTWINS,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:34:26 2015 UTC,"Batters are hitting .556 on his fastball (lefties are 3-3), .539 on his sinker (lefties are 3-5), and .300 on his slider (lefties are 3-11). He's walked more batters than he's struck out, his WHIP is 2.229, and look at his line drive numbers: http://i.imgur.com/B3Cnxz6.png  The hit was a catchable ball (and also a line drive), obviously, and Hicks made a bad mistake, but do you really think Duensing helped matters there?"
minnesotatwins,39n7vh,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"If a pitcher is going to allow contact, a line drive is the last thing he wants to allow. If the error had been on a dropped lazy fly ball, or a grounder through an infielders legs, it would have been much less on Duensing. While this error was still almost entirely Hicks' fault, part of the blame still goes to Duensing for allowing that kind of contact."
minnesotatwins,39n7vh,tennisspears,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"No, Deunsing is not good. But, Hicks deserves to be hated on for that play. He's been decent because of his great defense, and making a mistake like that negates a lot of his usefulness to the team."
minnesotatwins,39n7vh,MINNYTWINS,2,Sat Jun 13 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"One mistake in a game that would have been a complete toss-up otherwise (tied going to the 9th) should not discredit the other 27 games he's played this season.   I understand that because it just happened and the stakes were/are a big factor, it will be blown up, but I don't believe it should."

Like I said, the change is only used to RHH, meaning LHH have it a bit easier with a lot of four-seamers and sinkers early, then comes in with the curve 53-55% of the time when he's ahead or has the hitter at two strikes. The change will also get the most swing and misses at a 16.13% whiff (he's only thrown it 31 times this season, however), and the knuckle curve gets 10.53% whiff. His sinker is fantastic in that it gets a very good 16.5% ground ball percentage, and his curve at 9.29% gets a fair share of grounders as well.  Lefties are hitting the four-seamer .385 OppBA/.692 SLG this season, while also hitting .296 against the sinker. Righties have had great contact against the change-up (.500 BA/1.167 SLG), and .267/.400 vs. the sinker.  On the season, Wandy is 3-2 with a 3.25 ERA (3.66 FIP), 43 strikeouts (22 via curve, 16 via four-seamer) to 18 walks in 52.2 IP.  Because of a career that's almost all in the NL, only two Twins players have history against Wandy Rodriguez -  Hunter: 0 for 2, 1 BB  Mauer: 1 for 6, 1 BB, 1 K"

Corey Cove has the personality of a cum filled sock under a 14 year olds bed, Common's ""bit"" was never funny, and it's been the same shit for more than a decade, and Dan Barreiro spends half of every show complaining about weathermen and seeing what his ""political wonk"" Pat Kessler thinks.

That is really one of the things that annoys me about the rules: umpires can touch players but players can't touch umpires.  Neither should be able to bump the other.  That doesn't mean players should be able to take swings at blue, but Kellogg did not help matters by grabbing an angry player.    Yet, as usual, the Twins lose a player to a shit call, and nothing will happen to the umpires who created the situation."
minnesotatwins,39fq20,7Finger,4,Thu Jun 11 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there's no way to really know, but it sure did look like Torii was losing steam before Kellogg came over and started manhandling him. Anyone in a shouting match with someone else is gonna freaking explode if someone comes and grabs em like that."
minnesotatwins,39fq20,dapeche,5,Thu Jun 11 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"The one thing that I noticed that bothered me was not Torii's actions, but that Molitor kind of just wandered out there and didn't really get in between Torii and the ump and be the one to truly argue. I think if he would have stepped in more, it wouldn't have escalated to that point.Or it could be that I just miss the Gardy ejections."

minnesotatwins,39g61f,TwinsFaithful,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we were really spoiled over that stretch with the sheer amount of hits with RISP, it had to stop eventually and the last two series have showed that. Is it the end? No, simply put, baseball is extremely random and hard to predict."
minnesotatwins,39g61f,Gallade3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:46:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, baseball is hard to predict and the season is a roller coaster ride until the end. But if we really want to contend for the playoffs and compete within our division, I think something will need to be done as far as our lineup goes. We don't have enough ""meat"" in the middle, and nobody is hitting particularly well or even getting on base at a very high clip."
minnesotatwins,39g61f,ajdragoon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"The Brewers series was a mess, but the Royals, on the other hand, are a good team. I'll be worried if they do nothing against Texas.  The hitting with RISP thing is only weird because the data shows that ""clutch hitting"" isn't real. So what we were seeing in May was more coincidence rather than a pattern or skill."
minnesotatwins,39g61f,cstew79,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:52:41 2015 UTC,Twins aren't built to win now.. Plain and simple.
minnesotatwins,39g61f,Kripzo,0,Thu Jun 11 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"Yesterday we got a fair number of hits. I think people are reacting far too much to this slump. The Royals have possibly the best outfield in MLB and their pitching is solid to boot. The first loss to the Brewers and this final loss to the Royals were the only truly bad performances from the Twins, otherwise they were close games. After a day off and a pep talk from Hunter and a few others, hopefully the team will pick up where they were a month ago."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,TwinsGameday,5,Wed Jun 10 23:13:47 2015 UTC,Salvador Perez seems like a neat fellow :( Very cordial.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,Derk-Derks,2,Thu Jun 11 03:15:12 2015 UTC,"Sucks to be swept, but seeing some fire in our team and manager takes a bit of the sting away.  Here's hoping the Rangers series is our turnaround!"
minnesotatwins,39d26q,BrianDoziersHair,2,Thu Jun 11 03:08:08 2015 UTC,Well that was a depressing series.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,tennisspears,2,Thu Jun 11 03:07:47 2015 UTC,Polanco's fielding right there was pretty nice.

minnesotatwins,39d26q,Derk-Derks,3,Thu Jun 11 03:02:04 2015 UTC,Beautiful.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,BrianDoziersHair,4,Thu Jun 11 03:00:12 2015 UTC,Anyone think Torii gets suspended at all? I know he bumped the ump but seemed very innocent. Also I want that jersey in the HOF when we win our next 20 games and take the ALC.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,Derk-Derks,2,Thu Jun 11 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"Well, he was also right."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,grensley,4,Thu Jun 11 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"Nah, he's not a Royal. If it had been Herrera or Ventura they'd be out for seven games, minimum."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,NSYK,7,Thu Jun 11 02:59:45 2015 UTC,"Well duh, you guys are assholes :)"
minnesotatwins,39d26q,Derk-Derks,4,Thu Jun 11 03:00:24 2015 UTC,"I thought this was ""Everyone Hates Royals"" season anyway."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,NSYK,2,Thu Jun 11 03:01:44 2015 UTC,"Well, my whole team needs to get sent down to the minors, so I'll just crap on everyone else to help me feel better"
minnesotatwins,39d26q,Afin12,4,Thu Jun 11 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"Last 2 innings of the series, we finally start to show a spark."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,AdaAstra,4,Thu Jun 11 02:56:33 2015 UTC,If it's any consolation I'll be pulling for you against the Cards.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,NSYK,5,Thu Jun 11 02:59:09 2015 UTC,You guys have one hell of a leader out there. I can't imagine Gordon ever doing that.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,Love_Freckles,5,Thu Jun 11 02:55:45 2015 UTC,I was pissed off this whole game but Torii gave me something to smile about. I love him
minnesotatwins,39d26q,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Thu Jun 11 02:56:37 2015 UTC,Torii was like
minnesotatwins,39d26q,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,6,Thu Jun 11 02:52:56 2015 UTC,Too soon for Barry.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,ChiefakaJames,10,Thu Jun 11 02:56:12 2015 UTC,Royals fan. Looks like Tori was pretty pissed off... or wanted to demonstrate his stripping abilities.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,NSYK,4,Thu Jun 11 02:52:21 2015 UTC,The flair tipped me off ;)   That was fun though. Sorry we did not feel like playing this series.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,Derk-Derks,3,Thu Jun 11 02:53:24 2015 UTC,Wife is mad I made her watch every inning of all these games thinking they would be epic. Before this the Royals were 1-10 on their last 10 games. I'm excited that the Twins are defying the pre-season polls. I (not trying to be a dick here) place you in a solid second at the end of the season.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,NSYK,4,Thu Jun 11 02:57:30 2015 UTC,What did you say?
minnesotatwins,39d26q,AdaAstra,2,Thu Jun 11 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"We're going to be at the Brewers games next week, so this only makes me think of the cheese curds we 'bout to get."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,NSYK,2,Thu Jun 11 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"We'd be happy with that, though this team has maybe spoiled us a bit so far so now we're all sad and mad at our poor performance this last week, especially against you guys. Better you up there though than the Kitties, Sux, or Cleveland."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,Derk-Derks,3,Thu Jun 11 02:59:24 2015 UTC,I think the Twins show solid progress. Detroit is put out to pasture after the season. I think this is a changing of the guard in the AL Central.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,NSYK,3,Thu Jun 11 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"It is all part of ""the plan""."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,AdaAstra,4,Thu Jun 11 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"Trust Brooks Baseball more than FoxTrax. http://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/zoneTrack.php?month=06&day=10&year=2015&game=gid_2015_06_10_kcamlb_minmlb_1%2F Ripperger's K-zone hasn't been too terrible tonight, but whatever motivating thing Torii and Molitor want to try."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:52:16 2015 UTC,Just said this on the Royals game thread:   That ejection/show was about 10% about the bad strike call and 90% about how bad the Twins have played over the last week.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,tennisspears,3,Thu Jun 11 02:53:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, how many times has Dick said ""home stand"" tonight?  Has to be well over 25 by now."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,AdaAstra,3,Thu Jun 11 02:50:49 2015 UTC,"Torii Hunter can literally do anything he wants. I loved that whole ensemble. Also hello Twinsbuds, sorry I missed you."
minnesotatwins,39d26q,Derk-Derks,3,Thu Jun 11 02:49:36 2015 UTC,Yard sale bitches.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,grensley,4,Thu Jun 11 02:49:32 2015 UTC,I can't watch right now but can someone link me of Torii  and Molly getting ejected. I heard that Torii threw his jersey on the field.

minnesotatwins,39d26q,BrianDoziersHair,5,Thu Jun 11 02:46:46 2015 UTC,And Molly and Hunter get ejected!  STEAL THE FIRST BASE!!!!

minnesotatwins,39d26q,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:44:10 2015 UTC,I can't watch Mauer anymore. This is so frustrating. He may be the worst player on the team right now.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,scoop_17,2,Thu Jun 11 02:41:11 2015 UTC,Worst per dollar spent probably. Not the worst on the team though
minnesotatwins,39d26q,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Thu Jun 11 02:43:02 2015 UTC,Worst player adjusted for what should be expected for their position.
minnesotatwins,39d26q,scoop_17,2,Thu Jun 11 03:01:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I can agree with that. Not 1st baseman numbers at all
minnesotatwins,39d26q,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,6,Thu Jun 11 03:03:39 2015 UTC,That is true....Royals tend to fight everyone.  We should start a fight.

minnesotatwins,39d26q,AdaAstra,3,Thu Jun 11 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm fully agree with the ""We need Molly to start yelling"".  About this time, Gardy would have been booted from the game already.  I want to see a Molly flip out.  Have him take the first base as he leaves."

minnesotatwins,39d26q,spin8x,4,Thu Jun 11 01:57:27 2015 UTC,Or finish the game with 200 pitches and have enough to flip off the Royals bull pen as he walks off the field.

Good for Gibson to limit the damage outside that first inning, and still manage to get us to the 7th with the high pitch count. Hopefully we can start getting some hits, but the way the Royals play defense, we almost need the HR power.  We just don't have enough of that this year."

minnesotatwins,39d26q,guiltycitizen,3,Thu Jun 11 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"Well, we need to play tough teams to see how we do.  I think many were waiting to see how we did these two weeks to see if we were legit or just a ""fluke"".  Really hoping we can take this last one from the Royals, as the Rangers are not going to be easier and that Cardinals will probably murder us.  But, we have pulled some Twins magic off before, so never know!"

minnesotatwins,398j46,Tedimon,5,Wed Jun 10 02:32:33 2015 UTC,"Relax, we just had a great month. Would much rather have a slump like this now than in 2-3 months. Just bad luck everyone is slumping at once. The bright side is the pitching has been pretty consistent."
minnesotatwins,3986tt,TwinsGameday,2,Tue Jun 9 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Well twins, I wish you guys luck against anyone who isn't the royals"
minnesotatwins,3986tt,Andynym,3,Wed Jun 10 03:12:32 2015 UTC,Its hard to be taken seriously when you can't beat the good teams. I still have hope for us but it is so frustrating

minnesotatwins,3986tt,phernoree,3,Wed Jun 10 03:14:49 2015 UTC,One hit?  That's all we got - one goddamn hit?!
minnesotatwins,3986tt,phernoree,2,Wed Jun 10 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"Make em run from pole to pole. It'll make me feel better. Terrible offensive game. Great pitching by the royals obviously, I'm just salty. Might be from all the ocean water."

minnesotatwins,3986tt,pman5595,3,Wed Jun 10 03:01:45 2015 UTC,So apparently Holland is wanting to make this interesting.

minnesotatwins,3986tt,DetectiveWoofles,2,Wed Jun 10 02:56:14 2015 UTC,I understand. I'll keep my fingers crossed when you play the Cards. Deal?

minnesotatwins,3986tt,NSYK,5,Wed Jun 10 02:47:11 2015 UTC,Things could get better if they remember how to hit again.
minnesotatwins,3986tt,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed Jun 10 02:50:34 2015 UTC,Royals are having the same issue. Only thing saving us is our defense.

minnesotatwins,3986tt,DetectiveWoofles,2,Wed Jun 10 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"So that was a strike, but not the other 5 pitches that were identical to it's position in the strike zone?"
minnesotatwins,3986tt,StuntmanMichael123,3,Wed Jun 10 02:35:17 2015 UTC,From what I heard on the radio May wasn't getting that call all night.
minnesotatwins,3986tt,Bickle19,4,Wed Jun 10 02:34:34 2015 UTC,Couldn't see if it was a good call or not because FS North went with the view behind home plate where you can't see shit.

minnesotatwins,3986tt,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed Jun 10 02:25:35 2015 UTC,Seeing our offense struggle like this I irrationally want them to take a chance on him real soon. Probably a September call up though. I'm no expert on prospects though. I'm just really excited for him and Sano.

minnesotatwins,3986tt,ChiefakaJames,8,Tue Jun 9 23:35:08 2015 UTC,"Chris Young on the mound for the Royals. Really only a two-pitch RHP. A four-seam fastball maxing out around 90mph (used 57% of the time) and a slider at 80-82mph used 41%. There's also a change-up that he uses exclusively to lefties, but he's only thrown it 13 times this season (10 in one appearance).  Very simple approach – fastball early in the counts and when he falls behind, slider when he's ahead and with two strikes. .216 Opp BA/.364 SLG off of the fastball this season, .162 BA/.270 SLG off of the slider.  On the year, Young is 4-2 with a 2.56 ERA (3.62 FIP), 34 Ks (24 via the slider) to 13 BB in 45.2 IP. He has 12 appearances on the year, 6 of them starts and 6 in relief. In two relief appearances against the Twins this year, he went 3.0 IP, 2 H, 2 R and 2.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R.

He was chattering at the ump (or at least the batting area) in the first, and Hunter struck out looking on a 2-2 pitch that was well out of the zone. Hunter got in the ump's face, got tossed. Molitor said about 5 words to him, got tossed... But Torrii then did throw a bunch of his shit off on the way out. Jersey and all... Hunter also took a very difficult 2-1 strike in the first that was near the same spot. Take that as you will.     I don't think KC got any shortage of calls in this series, or their last with us. It's not a crazy concept that none of the Umps probably want to be the one who was present for KC's 43645th fight of the year, and we're an easy target."

minnesotatwins,393f10,Kripzo,16,Mon Jun 8 23:47:40 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, he's a lefty reliever used in college at U of I. He's got four pitches, fastball (93-97), curveball, slider, and a changeup (see gif below). He is seen to either be a fast rising relief pitcher or as a longer term project a solid middle rotation starter.  His fastball is his best pitch, doesn't have a lot of sink to it, the curve and slider are his next best pitches, a little bit under-developed but the curve he is at least consistent with. The changeup is his least developed pitch, but damn it looks deadly if he gets it right.  Tyler Jay's changeup  Tyler Jay pitching video  Looks like the Twins want to see him as a starter, so I doubt we'll see him this year."

minnesotatwins,393f10,CantaloupeCamper,3,Tue Jun 9 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of good and bad things here. The good out weight the bad.   The good:  Lets start with the Plus plus FB and possibly plus breaking ball. Both of those are fantastic pitches, his breaking ball is mostly a slider which is a wipe out pitch for him. Add in a possible above average change up and you have a formidable arsenal.   His control. It's the best in the class. He has an easy and smooth delivery (better than Fulmer's for example) and he can direct his pitches accurately.   Low mileage. Due to him being a closer in college, 128 IP is nothing. He's not over worked like normal college starters. Very good for us going forward.  The bad:  It's really one thing but it sprouts a lot of other potential issues. He's done all this as a reliever. Now I know every says he can be a starter, but it's one to say it and another thing to actually do it. For example, does his mid to high 90s FB become a 90-93 FB when he's starting? Can he go 7-8 innings deep? Does he have the mentality to start? How about the stamina? If his stuff deteriorates after starting, would you be ok with picking a 90-93 FB LHP starter with the 6?   The best bet for him is to go to AA as soon as possible and just pitch. If he can figure out the small things with starting, he should be fine. For the record, I think he can and I think the organization can help him do it (like they did with Duffey), but until we get results, it's a risk."

Even though the Twins are first in the AL, nobody is really sure how good the pitching rotation/bullpen really are--Perkins aside. If the worst should happen, and the pitching goes to crap, it is good to have more prospects waiting to take the place of someone in the 25 man roster. Also, keep in mind that the Twins have top prospects in both the outfield and infield. I would have liked to see them draft a shortstop based on our recent struggles in that area, but I doubt any player in the draft would be ready to slot in to that starting role right away."

minnesotatwins,393f10,0vercast,15,Tue Jun 9 00:02:35 2015 UTC,I hope to god we didn't just draft someone meant to take the place of a long reliever.
minnesotatwins,393f10,ItsThisEasy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:38:03 2015 UTC,I meant just for right now.. Move him to starter once ready.
minnesotatwins,392lv6,FrankReynolds,5,Mon Jun 8 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"He absolutely has been a huge part of the success. He's been insanely clutch it feels like with runners on base(I don't have any stats, just a generalization from what I've seen this season)."
minnesotatwins,392lv6,kgthdc2468,8,Mon Jun 8 21:50:10 2015 UTC,"He is hitting .365 with RISP and .667 with the bases loaded.  With two outs and RISP, he's hitting .381 with a video game-like 1.528 OPS.  In high leverage situations, he's hitting .394.  So yeah, he's been alright :-)"
minnesotatwins,392lv6,kgthdc2468,3,Mon Jun 8 22:46:56 2015 UTC,"Shit, that's better than I imagined. He's absolutely killing it!"
minnesotatwins,392lv6,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"Belief.  He and Mollie build belief, plain and simple.  If Paul Molitor tells you something as a MLB player, you probably just believe it.  Same thing with Torii.  Plus, Dance Parties."
minnesotatwins,391gdr,AntonSquaredMe,20,Mon Jun 8 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"And it finally happens after we lose 2 of 3, at home, to the Brewers? Interesting..."
minnesotatwins,391gdr,The_Swiss_Mistress,3,Mon Jun 8 16:02:23 2015 UTC,And the Astros are still up there too. I think the rankings are a little delayed.
minnesotatwins,391gdr,ajdragoon,8,Mon Jun 8 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"Nice to get some recognition.  Wish the series with the Brew-has had gone a little better but having expectations in the first place is a great feeling.  Well done, gentlemen."
minnesotatwins,391gdr,tenthreeleader,2,Mon Jun 8 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like the brewers will put us back in our place and we will come out and destroy the Royals, causing another losing streak."
minnesotatwins,391gdr,cadderly09,6,Mon Jun 8 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"Not really something I take much stock in, but it's still pretty nice to be in the top 5!"
minnesotatwins,391gdr,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,8,Mon Jun 8 15:41:02 2015 UTC,And yet are still #1 in the AL and #2 in the whole friggin league (i.e. what really matters).
minnesotatwins,391gdr,mikerowave612,14,Mon Jun 8 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that this matters for ""power rankings"" but how pointless would they be if they only judged based on record. That's just called the ""standings""."
minnesotatwins,391gdr,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,2,Mon Jun 8 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"Just saying, not really sure I care what ESPN thinks about stuff anymore.  I would be more interested if they were based on some stats formula but I am pretty sure it is just opinion designed to get clicks."
minnesotatwins,391gdr,drpmd08,3,Mon Jun 8 17:31:12 2015 UTC,Crazy that we lose 2 of 3 and still have the second best record in the league. Let's hope for some recuperation and start the series strong tonight.
minnesotatwins,391gdr,jcwitte,3,Mon Jun 8 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"ESPN is just ludicrous. If you watch some of the ""analysis"" videos on the Twins page, all they drone on about is how the Twins have no chance of making the post season, and how our winning is basically just a fluke.  Fuck 'em."
minnesotatwins,391gdr,DoNotEatTheTail,2,Mon Jun 8 21:02:51 2015 UTC,You guys definitely deserve it. Was anyone expecting this kind of year?
minnesotatwins,391gdr,AdaAstra,3,Tue Jun 9 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"Again, meeh to power rankings.  While I know people in this sub don't like to hear it, we are playing way above what everyone is expecting and it is very understandable for people to expect us not to sustain the momentum we had in May.  The next 3 series are going to be a great indicator if we really have changed or if this truly is us getting some lucky breaks.    Until these two weeks are over, I don't think the Twins are a top 5 team yet.  I would say they are still in the 7-9 range."
minnesotatwins,393b60,TwinsGameday,2,Mon Jun 8 23:17:46 2015 UTC,Our bats will pick up again. No sweat.
minnesotatwins,393b60,NorseWolves,-1,Tue Jun 9 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"LOL, no they won't. This is what all that clustering and the Twins being lucky is all about........."
minnesotatwins,393b60,RobertService,3,Tue Jun 9 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"I blame Fenway.  Team needs to go on a cleanse, sweat out the clam chowder and crab cakes, and come back ready tomorrow."
minnesotatwins,393b60,tokomini,2,Tue Jun 9 02:53:03 2015 UTC,"Well pitching isn't the problem. Sure Thompson slipped up, but the real problem is hitting and scoring runs. Hopefully our boys are able to improve in the next couple days!"
minnesotatwins,393b60,Alejandroandro,2,Tue Jun 9 02:50:07 2015 UTC,No worries guys. DON'T STOP BELIEVIN'!! HOLD ON TO THAT FEEEEELING!
minnesotatwins,393b60,Crowbar2099,5,Tue Jun 9 02:48:48 2015 UTC,Good game friends!!

minnesotatwins,393b60,Derk-Derks,4,Tue Jun 9 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"Okay Eddie, time for the rare two-run solo shot."
minnesotatwins,393b60,tokomini,3,Tue Jun 9 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"I realize that we are just seeing the regression to the mean that everyone keeps talking about, but can we score more then 1 or 2 runs please?"
minnesotatwins,393b60,schrica,4,Tue Jun 9 02:45:43 2015 UTC,"Damn, that was a creepy picture of Chris Young."
minnesotatwins,393b60,Tannekr,2,Tue Jun 9 02:45:41 2015 UTC,we love our baldknobber
minnesotatwins,393b60,acarmine,2,Tue Jun 9 02:55:14 2015 UTC,He looked old as fuck.
minnesotatwins,393b60,cadderly09,2,Tue Jun 9 02:46:09 2015 UTC,Looked like a videogame manager.
minnesotatwins,393b60,Derk-Derks,3,Tue Jun 9 02:47:19 2015 UTC,Back to back dongers would be appreciated here.
minnesotatwins,393b60,cadderly09,3,Tue Jun 9 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"Well, lets do it lads.  We got this."
minnesotatwins,393b60,NorseWolves,2,Tue Jun 9 02:41:47 2015 UTC,He's not immortal!
minnesotatwins,393b60,Derk-Derks,3,Tue Jun 9 02:41:36 2015 UTC,We should just start putting Tom Brunansky in until our offense picks back up.
minnesotatwins,393b60,Tannekr,3,Tue Jun 9 02:40:28 2015 UTC,"Assuming Greg Holland is in for the 9th. On the season - 13.1 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 11 K, 8 BB.  Twins due up vs. Holland -  Vargas: 0 for 1, 1 K  Suzuki: 0 for 6, 2 BB  Rosario: Never faced  Escobar: 1 for 3, 1 K  Hicks: Never faced"
minnesotatwins,393b60,ChiefakaJames,3,Tue Jun 9 02:39:02 2015 UTC,Hicks walkoff double. Book it.  Edit: Well he would have hit one if he had gotten the chance.
minnesotatwins,393b60,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:41:44 2015 UTC,Put it in my book and everything.

minnesotatwins,393b60,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:48:35 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I'll remember this.
minnesotatwins,393b60,ChiefakaJames,5,Tue Jun 9 02:51:00 2015 UTC,Wow I don't think I've seen Thompson get the guy he is supposed to get out.
minnesotatwins,393b60,mitkern,4,Tue Jun 9 02:31:41 2015 UTC,Wade Davis is unreal.
minnesotatwins,393b60,tennisspears,3,Tue Jun 9 02:27:25 2015 UTC,Mauer...
minnesotatwins,393b60,tennisspears,3,Tue Jun 9 02:25:30 2015 UTC,Mauer has been hitting into a stupid amount of double plays.
minnesotatwins,393b60,vagrantwade,3,Tue Jun 9 02:25:29 2015 UTC,Are you talking about recently...or his entire career?
minnesotatwins,393b60,schrica,2,Tue Jun 9 02:27:11 2015 UTC,This season. Specifically.
minnesotatwins,393b60,vagrantwade,2,Tue Jun 9 02:27:57 2015 UTC,"That was sarcasm, Joe has always been known to hit into double plays."

minnesotatwins,393b60,Derk-Derks,4,Tue Jun 9 02:24:52 2015 UTC,Two runs needed against Davis and Holland? Shit.
minnesotatwins,393b60,tennisspears,3,Tue Jun 9 02:20:54 2015 UTC,Just gotta get runners on for the 7-9 hitters.
minnesotatwins,393b60,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:21:44 2015 UTC,Thompson is really starting to regress. That's a bummer to give up a run right away :(
minnesotatwins,393b60,Derk-Derks,2,Tue Jun 9 02:16:06 2015 UTC,All in all that was a good start for Hughes. Just one bad homerun but I can deal with this more often.
minnesotatwins,393b60,Derk-Derks,2,Tue Jun 9 02:13:32 2015 UTC,Really hope this isn't one of those games we keep close all game until they score a ton of runs in the 8th/9th.
minnesotatwins,393b60,vagrantwade,3,Tue Jun 9 02:13:03 2015 UTC,D'awww dick and bert are besties
minnesotatwins,393b60,cadderly09,3,Tue Jun 9 02:11:39 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, Phil missed there. Little harm done though."
minnesotatwins,393b60,ajdragoon,4,Tue Jun 9 02:09:12 2015 UTC,"How come the boys can get Nolasco run support to save his lame ass, but when Hughes pitches, everyone goes silent?"
minnesotatwins,393b60,schrica,2,Tue Jun 9 02:08:04 2015 UTC,Ouch.  A hit there would have been nice.
minnesotatwins,393b60,schrica,2,Tue Jun 9 02:01:55 2015 UTC,I'm sorry guys. I started Dozier and Hunter in Fanduel :(
minnesotatwins,393b60,Derk-Derks,2,Tue Jun 9 02:01:07 2015 UTC,dang...
minnesotatwins,393b60,Markoshollo,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:58 2015 UTC,Pitch 2 was not a strike.
minnesotatwins,393b60,ajdragoon,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:32 2015 UTC,This really feels like playoff baseball.
minnesotatwins,393b60,cadderly09,2,Tue Jun 9 01:59:20 2015 UTC,Nice little hit by Hicks!
minnesotatwins,393b60,MINNYTWINS,2,Tue Jun 9 01:58:56 2015 UTC,Rosario and Hicks keep rollin'. That's a two week stretch now for the both of 'em.
minnesotatwins,393b60,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 9 01:58:51 2015 UTC,Can someone here confirm that the top of the green is a dong?
minnesotatwins,393b60,FuckingLoveArborDay,2,Tue Jun 9 01:58:43 2015 UTC,no it's a loon shot

minnesotatwins,393b60,Markoshollo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:04:04 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Ned Yost doesn't challenge anything and if the metal fence was actually the boundary and Ned didn't challenge it I was gonna 'splode.

minnesotatwins,393b60,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:12 2015 UTC,I think we want to kill the Royals pitching staff.

minnesotatwins,393b60,cadderly09,2,Tue Jun 9 01:57:33 2015 UTC,That's a fantastic play by Eduardo.
minnesotatwins,393b60,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 9 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"Jeez, Vargas is probably done after 70 pitches, and I don't even really blame them."
minnesotatwins,393b60,tennisspears,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:44:11 2015 UTC,I assume from that pitch to the stomach? Or because their bullpen is crazy good?
minnesotatwins,393b60,DetectiveWoofles,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:50:32 2015 UTC,I don't blame them because their pen is so good.
minnesotatwins,393b60,tennisspears,2,Tue Jun 9 01:52:53 2015 UTC,I forget sometimes that Joe is 6'5''.

minnesotatwins,393b60,ItsThisEasy,4,Tue Jun 9 00:35:21 2015 UTC,He is tied for fourth for the most HRs allowed with 13.
minnesotatwins,393b60,Chocobo812,2,Tue Jun 9 00:28:39 2015 UTC,His last year with the Yankees he went some ridiculous stretch of time where he gave up at least a HR per game. It became a joke.
minnesotatwins,393b60,ajdragoon,2,Tue Jun 9 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"While true, he's a flyball pitcher at Yankee stadium... he's set up to fail there."

He predicted that everyone would pass on Cameron because of his price tag, and that the Astros could land Cameron at 37th overall (and could sign him by going under slot with their 5th pick). That would be a steal."

minnesotatwins,393b60,tokomini,6,Mon Jun 8 23:47:51 2015 UTC,"Jason Vargas on the mound for the Royals tonight. 4-pitch LHP. Vargas has a four-seamer and two-seam sinker that both max out around 91mph. He also has a circle-change thrown around 82-84mph. The interesting thing about these three pitches is that they have all been used almost exactly the same. Out of his pitches thrown this season, he's thrown the four-seamer 170 times, the sinker 172 times, and the circle-change 169 times. That's about 29% each, which leaves the rest of his usage to his knuckle curve (used 13%) at around 77mph.  The change is used much more often to RHH rather than LHH (34% as opposed to 13%), and if he has two strikes on a RHH, there's a 46% chance he's going to that pitch. LHH also need to be aggressive on first pitches, as he's thrown his four-seamer 48% of the time first pitch this season. The only pitch Vargas is going to get people to swing-and-miss on is the circle-change at a 21.30% whiff rate - but everything else in his repertoire is extremely low (5% whiff curve, 3.49% sinker, 1.18% four-seam).  On the season, Vargas is 4-2 with a 4.79 ERA (4.57 FIP), 23 strikeouts (15 via the change) to 11 walks in 35.2 IP. He's already had two starts against the Twins this season, first start going 3.0 IP, giving up 10 H, 5 R, second start going 5.2 IP, giving up 8 H, 5 R. He had a loss and a no decision.  Twins lineup vs. Jason Vargas -   Dozier: 5 for 18, 1 double, 2 BB, 3 K  Hunter: 16 for 48, 6 doubles, 4 BB, 8 K  Mauer: 14 for 33, 2 doubles, 2 BB, 2 K  Plouffe: 5 for 30, 2 doubles, 1 HR, 1 BB, 3 K  Vargas: 1 for 7, 1 HR, 1 BB  Suzuki: 8 for 36, 3 BB, 6 K  Rosario: Never faced  Escobar: 1 for 3, 1 BB  Hicks: 2 for 7, 1 BB, 2 K"

minnesotatwins,38y9r8,Whovian4291,3,Mon Jun 8 02:50:33 2015 UTC,That's because the station they're on has changed once again. It's still Poland's company. They go by Go96 now and that's the music they play. The KTWIN identity didn't stick I guess.

And of course he gets excitable and has some personality. He is indisputably the voice of the Twins to me. Unique and identifiable.  Bert can be very abrasive but he doesn't give a shit. He has a good dry sense of humor which might not always be for everyone. He's got personality. After listening to Jack Morris or whoever else they've had in there on occasion, I def missed Bert's personality."

minnesotatwins,38y9r8,ClemDeLaClem,2,Mon Jun 8 23:03:43 2015 UTC,I love Dick and Bert because of their love of the game (and Twins). They aren't just some guys that went to college for communications and decided that telecasting for baseball is their path. They both genuinely love baseball. Plus it helps that Bert is the best pitcher the Twins have ever had :)
minnesotatwins,38y9r8,Ricky_Droschmidt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:36:22 2015 UTC,I live in Kansas now and have had to listen to the Royals broadcasting crew and my god is it horrible. Worse than the ChiSox. Rex Hudler is the most unlistenable man in baseball (I have MLB.TV premium so I have heard them all) Every time he talks I wanna bash my head against something. His analysis is almost always either painfully obvious or just plain incorrect. His little sayings are so stupid.
minnesotatwins,38y9r8,kimjongslice,0,Wed Jun 10 07:19:12 2015 UTC,They are good to listen to. When Smalley is with Dick it's un-fucking-bearable. Bert is just always on the liquor though.
minnesotatwins,38y9r8,tokomini,-29,Mon Jun 8 14:09:45 2015 UTC,"When you say ""cringe inducing 'youthful' slang,"" are you referring to saber-metrical analysis?  Because Dick and Bert's lack of understanding of contemporary statistics and player value is probably the most frustrating part of listening to them."
minnesotatwins,38y9r8,ozonejl,22,Sun Jun 7 22:22:49 2015 UTC,"Hahah, when I think ""youthful slang"" the first thing I think of is not saber-metrical analysis.   More like ""shout out to all the YOLOs out there, hashtag SWAG."" ...or whatever."

The biggest downside is no shelter from the sun or rain."

And there is merit that we are playing above what we should be.  People will look for us to fall until we do.  Just be happy that we are doing well and hopefully we can pull off a playoff spot this year.    Twins are playing like a top 10 team, but not a top 5 IMO.  I would put them at about 7th or 8th."

How do we respond after such a torrid May? Do we enter the AS break still on top? We definitely can do it, especially if Bro Mauer climbs back to .300 and our pitching stays even-ish."
minnesotatwins,38y9er,FrankReynolds,24,Sun Jun 7 21:34:13 2015 UTC,Santana just looks defeated. Dude needs to take it easy and get his swing back.
minnesotatwins,38y9er,konvalbr,7,Sun Jun 7 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Santana has proven in the past he can hit the ball, but he has just been lost for almost a month now. Mixed in with his errors on defense, he was clearly the weakest link on our team. Let him go build his confidence for a few weeks in the AAA. Hopefully we can get the Santana we saw last year back up."
minnesotatwins,38y9er,AdaAstra,4,Sun Jun 7 22:52:05 2015 UTC,"After he hit into that double play yesterday with the bases loaded, he looked like he was going to burst into tears.  That was a long battle, and Garza left a couple hanging out there for him to hammer, but he couldn't get solid bat on the ball.  Feel bad for him, hopefully he can get his confidence back down in AAA."
minnesotatwins,38y9er,giantgnat,7,Mon Jun 8 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"It's about time. Also, I'm excited to see if Vargas can redeem himself for his early season slump, as he's been doing quite well in AAA."

minnesotatwins,38y9er,FlannelBeard,0,Sun Jun 7 22:33:42 2015 UTC,He was finally starting to hit well in the 10 games before the Twins sent him packing. They have shown zero patience with him and Arcia this year.
minnesotatwins,38y9er,NotPercyChuggs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:39:08 2015 UTC,"Which is a good thing, I'd give Vargas a much longer leash than Arcia. I'm just ready for Arcia to be gone, hoping we use him as a trade chip"
minnesotatwins,38y9er,PhatGiraffe42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"Uh, what? Arcia hit 20 HR's last year as a 23 year old. Vargas has had ONE good month at the ""Major League Level"". I'll take Arcia."
minnesotatwins,38y9er,NotPercyChuggs,2,Mon Jun 8 19:55:48 2015 UTC,"Defensive liability, no ability to work a count, and a relatively low baseball IQ. Not saying Vargas is gonna be an all star or anything and neither will Arcia. Just to me Arcia has been one of if not the most frustrating players to watch in recent seasons, and I think he would be a nice trade chip come July if the Twins keep playing the way they are."
minnesotatwins,38y9er,PhatGiraffe42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:13:05 2015 UTC,"Argument could be said the same thing about Trevor Plouffe back in the day.  These people are humans and they develop differently.  Not everyone comes up like Mike Trout.  You can't teach physical tools, like the ability to square up a ball 500 feet like Arcia can do.  What if Arcia develops patience and to lay off the sliders outside?  The guy becomes a monster and you give him away for nothing."
minnesotatwins,38y9er,dabecka,4,Tue Jun 9 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"Wonderful. It doesn't seem like much, but putting Vargas 5th and sliding the current 5-8 hitters back a spot each will make the lineup look so much better. And hopefully no more Escobar or Nunez DHing. Just wish this move had happened 2-3 weeks ago."
minnesotatwins,38y9er,tennisspears,2,Sun Jun 7 21:48:12 2015 UTC,"It's huge, that first game of the double header v. Boston when we didn't have Mauer in there really highlighted the need for reliable bats after the cleanup guy. Suzuki does not belong in the 5-spot.  It will be interesting once Arcia returns how we will play the DH.  Outfield defense is noticeably better with Robinson/Rosario but I would really like to see Arcia's bat back in the lineup."

minnesotatwins,38y9er,Naonadhe,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:18:54 2015 UTC,Yeah which is ok but long term if Santana doesn't work out we need a permanent SS.
minnesotatwins,38y9er,ISISFieldAgent,2,Mon Jun 8 11:23:08 2015 UTC,"Jorge Polanco, IMO, is the shortstop of the future.  He's at AA and might be up in July or whenever the Super-2 cutoff is.  He's also the best prospect in the Twins system that no one talks about."
minnesotatwins,38y9er,dabecka,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:07:29 2015 UTC,Oh that's good to hear. I am more of a hockey guy so I don't know like every Twins prospect. I never hear about anyone at SS as far as prospects go so I wasn't sure if we had anyone ready anytime soon. Thanks!

minnesotatwins,38y7a2,handsy_pilot,3,Sun Jun 7 23:58:41 2015 UTC,Only?  Winning 60% of games is very tough.
minnesotatwins,38y7a2,HughManatee,2,Mon Jun 8 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"60% is still a pretty big percentage, but that is going toward 92 wins, which actually might be low if the division bounces back from this atrocious week and goes back to how it was earlier. Picking a specific number is pretty difficult this early, divisions have been won with between 88 and 98 wins in the past few years, 92 is a pretty average one. The last few years, however, 88 has pretty much been the magic number for the second wild card, which we can reach by winning 52% of our remaining games, so even slightly above average for the rest of the year gets us to the playoffs."

minnesotatwins,38xbld,kaiserj1982,6,Sun Jun 7 21:00:00 2015 UTC,Santana might improve if he stops swinging at breaking balls off the ground
minnesotatwins,38xbld,vagrantwade,3,Sun Jun 7 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was gonna say he needs to spend a month in a batting cage with someone throwing the same damn pitch to him and him just watching it go by so maybe he won't strike out swinging on three breaking balls out of the zone."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,DetectiveWoofles,4,Sun Jun 7 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I've seen some 10 year olds get away with it. You sure Santana can't?"

minnesotatwins,38xbld,vagrantwade,3,Sun Jun 7 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"The situations aren't really comparable though. The Twins were almost forced to stick with Hicks, because there was no one to replace him with. There are more than enough options for shortstop right now (not all great options, but there are options). I just don't get it."

minnesotatwins,38xbld,BrianDoziersHair,8,Sun Jun 7 19:09:50 2015 UTC,I thought the White Sox was the de facto rival of everyone in the AL Central.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,Tannekr,5,Sun Jun 7 19:09:05 2015 UTC,I think the White Sox are moreso our rivals because of the 2000s decade where we fought with them a lot. Everyone does seem to hate them though.

minnesotatwins,38xbld,muffin_man84,7,Sun Jun 7 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, all I was hoping for was .500 season.   Now I'm getting greedy thinking of playoffs and more....."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jun 7 19:04:23 2015 UTC,Is this because they're playing stronger this year or AL central just weak this season and it's on their grasp this one year?  *Don't follow AL central much
minnesotatwins,38xbld,muffin_man84,3,Sun Jun 7 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"The Twins are playing better.  We have normally been a hitting team, but our pitching and defense usually gave up too many runs for our offense to do much about.  We have been pitching and playing defense better.  The last two games have honestly been some of our weaker games that kind of remind us of the last few seasons.   What really makes us happy though, is that we have alot of talent still siting in the minors.  Most of the sports sites still think we are a fluke right now, but most have agreed in the next few years, we will be a strong team with the talent we have coming up.  The AL central is not really weak this season, but just have some highs and lows.  The Twins, Tigers, Royals, and now even the Indians are all starting to beat up on each other and other teams.  Outside our division, the AL central still tends to win games."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jun 7 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"Hey, welcome. Brian Dozier is playing like an all-star, Mauer might be finally worth his salary, and our starting pitching has been something to keep an eye on. Ervin Santana will be back next month."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,cadderly09,2,Sun Jun 7 19:03:03 2015 UTC,Dozier is fun to watch!
minnesotatwins,38xbld,muffin_man84,5,Sun Jun 7 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why you think Mauer is all of a sudden worth his contract. Other than RBIs, he is having one of his worst seasons."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,tennisspears,3,Sun Jun 7 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"Meeh, I would say he is not worth his entire contract, but he is one of our more reliable players when we need some people hit in.  He is not the power hitter he used to be and still seems to get burned by some pitchers, but he is still a solid option in our line up.    Whether that is worth his cost, I don't know.  Mauer is a great home town hero though, so fans will always love him."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jun 7 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"I like Mauer. I think he has always gotten a bad rap. I just think it's odd that the people that had ripped Mauer before are now saying he is doing well (not saying that cadderly used to rip him, because I don't know if he did). Sure his RBIs are up but almost everything else is down this year."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,tennisspears,3,Sun Jun 7 19:12:44 2015 UTC,Awwww yeah debate. Let's hear it
minnesotatwins,38xbld,muffin_man84,3,Sun Jun 7 19:05:52 2015 UTC,"It's not even that I think Mauer is bad. It's just that all along people had criticized Mauer for not being an ""RBI guy"" when RBIs are very much reliant on his teammates being on base ahead of him. Now, his overall average, OBP, and slugging percentage are all down, but his RBIs are up so he is now performing ""as he should be"", according to most people. It's weird."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,tennisspears,3,Sun Jun 7 19:09:38 2015 UTC,Keyword is might. I have a feeling he will come around after the all star break and push us into the postseason.

minnesotatwins,38xbld,cadderly09,4,Sun Jun 7 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure a 2-0 lead in the 3rd inning means ""no sweep"" just yet.  The Twins should be up at least 3-0 but bats are quiet with men in scoring position and have been for too long."

minnesotatwins,38xbld,Johnnymac98,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:48:35 2015 UTC,Hicks and especially Santana are such weak-sticks right now.  It's almost like having an NL roster with 2 pitchers batting back-to-back.  I say you might need to split them up...but how?  Yikes.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,CentralAmerican,2,Sun Jun 7 18:48:24 2015 UTC,"At least Hicks can make stellar defensive plays, unlike Danny ""11+ Errors"" Santana."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,BrianDoziersHair,2,Sun Jun 7 18:57:26 2015 UTC,Oh I'm with you - Hicks is by far the better of the two.  I can live with what Hicks is doing right now.  Santana...there's just no upside right now.  None.

minnesotatwins,38xbld,rihanoa,8,Sun Jun 7 18:28:50 2015 UTC,I think Dick & Bert might come to fisticuffs today.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,FrankReynolds,9,Sun Jun 7 18:27:12 2015 UTC,Dick and Bert discussing the strike zone is classic Dick and Bert.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:26:53 2015 UTC,Haha. Good ol' Dick being a dick to Bert.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,Tannekr,2,Sun Jun 7 18:26:16 2015 UTC,The ball hit the black around the plate.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,kaiserj1982,4,Sun Jun 7 18:27:22 2015 UTC,I'm with Dick on the pitch that struck Suzuki out. It was clearly a ball that the catcher successfully framed as a strike.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,Tannekr,2,Sun Jun 7 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"Okay so I usually hate opposing TV announcers, but your guys are pretty funny.  Couldn't find a brewers stream, but I can handle this."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,DrinkWisconsinably,7,Sun Jun 7 18:26:14 2015 UTC,"Dick (the play-by-play) guy is great, Bert is a huge homer and has some very questionable opinions. Lately you'll hear Dick call out Bert a lot which can be amusing (but also a bit frustrating)."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sun Jun 7 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"Bert isn't even really a homer, he's more of a homer for pitchers, regardless of the team. I choose to believe that more often than not he is being a bit tongue in cheek with his hotter takes"
minnesotatwins,38xbld,The_Effing_Eagle,3,Sun Jun 7 19:57:05 2015 UTC,Also dear god hopefully this ump can tighten up that zone holy shit.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,DrinkWisconsinably,2,Sun Jun 7 18:27:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some of the pitches have practically been miles outside of the zone."
minnesotatwins,38xbld,BrianDoziersHair,4,Sun Jun 7 18:29:54 2015 UTC,At least a half a meter out.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,Tannekr,2,Sun Jun 7 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"To this day, this is one of the more surreal episodes of any Trek.  <3 my Sisko. (Well, I love everyone besides Archer. Fuck that guy.)"
minnesotatwins,38xbld,BrianDoziersHair,2,Sun Jun 7 18:37:07 2015 UTC,I was with you until your aside. How can you not love Scott Bakula?
minnesotatwins,38xbld,Tannekr,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"I love Bakula, I just don't like Archer except for very specific episodes.   Maybe there should be a one-off Quantum Leap episode where Sam returns to jump into Archer and fix his life? :B"
minnesotatwins,38xbld,BrianDoziersHair,2,Sun Jun 7 18:40:30 2015 UTC,A win today would help battle my hang over.  Lets do this!
minnesotatwins,38xbld,AdaAstra,2,Sun Jun 7 18:19:43 2015 UTC,LET'S DO THIS!!!
minnesotatwins,38xbld,kaiserj1982,3,Sun Jun 7 18:20:13 2015 UTC,anyone have a stream?

minnesotatwins,38xbld,Derk-Derks,2,Sun Jun 7 17:40:43 2015 UTC,At least Pelf is pitching today

minnesotatwins,38xbld,AntonSquaredMe,3,Sun Jun 7 17:58:30 2015 UTC,"That's just a rake in the back, I used to ride one of those!"
minnesotatwins,38xbld,Derk-Derks,2,Sun Jun 7 18:00:33 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that lawnmower is using that rake as camouflage. Making himself look like a peacock in order to infiltrate a group of peahens.
minnesotatwins,38xbld,AntonSquaredMe,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:18:52 2015 UTC,Professionally? Like in rodeos?

minnesotatwins,38xbld,Derk-Derks,2,Sun Jun 7 17:50:57 2015 UTC,I was in section E on memorial day.  Seats were amazing!

minnesotatwins,38t6zg,AntonSquaredMe,8,Sat Jun 6 17:48:15 2015 UTC,Are you wearing your Torii Hunter jersey? Or did you bring a Stephen Vogt bobblehead?
minnesotatwins,38t6zg,Derk-Derks,23,Sat Jun 6 17:38:58 2015 UTC,Neither. I am however falling in love with half the girls in this stadium. Good lord.

minnesotatwins,38t6zg,EveryRedditorSucks,3,Sun Jun 7 01:28:50 2015 UTC,What do you suggest
minnesotatwins,38t6zg,Comrade_Falcon,7,Sat Jun 6 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"The Red Cow burger stand is new this year, and absolutely fantastic (they also have an excellent restaurant in Edina if you'll be in town for a while). The Food Network stand usually has several things worth trying. And you can never go wrong with a Kramarczuk's Bratwurst!"
minnesotatwins,38t6zg,FlannelBeard,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:16:06 2015 UTC,Red Cow just opened a new restaurant in downtown right across from Whole Foods as well.

minnesotatwins,38t6zg,hammarschlagen,6,Sun Jun 7 01:12:40 2015 UTC,I live in the Bay Area......but I'm a lifelong Twins fan. Family grew up in Minnesota so I grew up a Minnesota sports fan - even though I've lived here my whole life.  I'm almost 30 and have never been to Minnesota. The only home teams and only sporting events I've ever known are the Bay Area teams.  I hope to visit Minnesota soon. It would be really surreal.
minnesotatwins,38t6zg,howlinforever,4,Sun Jun 7 03:30:12 2015 UTC,We'll be happy to host you whenever the time comes friend.

minnesotatwins,38tsuo,rootlinuxusr,8,Sat Jun 6 19:30:01 2015 UTC,It's Twins hat with Vikings colors.  New Era makes a whole crossover series of hats.
minnesotatwins,38tsuo,_bigb,2,Sat Jun 6 23:32:22 2015 UTC,I wish I could get a Vikings hat in non-purple.
minnesotatwins,38tsuo,NotPercyChuggs,2,Mon Jun 8 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"Fuckin' hell, I hate flat-brim hats."
minnesotatwins,38tsuo,Kruse,3,Mon Jun 8 14:46:40 2015 UTC,"You can find almost any hat in any color combo now. I know New Era did those exact hats for a while but I think they've stopped production on the ""M"" logo hats since the team no longer uses it."
minnesotatwins,38tsuo,mostdope92,7,Sun Jun 7 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"It stands for Mexico, i.e. where it was made"
minnesotatwins,38tsuo,SlobKelly,2,Sat Jun 6 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"Close, found bought it in Dallas."
minnesotatwins,38tsuo,gust-of-wind-dance,4,Sat Jun 6 20:37:37 2015 UTC,Just a Twins had with Vikings colors. It's not really that weird.
minnesotatwins,38tsuo,AlongCamePollyIsBae,6,Sat Jun 6 21:27:20 2015 UTC,Ooh! A vikings colored Twins hat. That's actually neat.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,TwinsGameday,5,Sat Jun 6 17:16:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, aside from a couple innings, the Twins haven't been able to hit for bupkis this week.  Just an awful last couple of days.  Either the ""Real Twins"" are in hiding, or they are out in plain view...."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,CentralAmerican,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"We better stomp the fuck out of the falling Royals then, if we are gonna play like this against the worst team in baseball.  edit: Fuck the state of Wisconsin edit2: Does anybody have a justifiable reason why that clown Santana still has a roster spot?"
minnesotatwins,38tbza,cadderly09,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:41:12 2015 UTC,What an awful loss... To the fucking Brewers too. First series loss in a while to one of the worst teams in baseball.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,DetectiveWoofles,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:35:16 2015 UTC,The worst*
minnesotatwins,38tbza,nittanylionstorm07,0,Sat Jun 6 21:42:00 2015 UTC,Yesterday's was probably worse.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,DetectiveWoofles,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:19:57 2015 UTC,I don't know about this inning though.  Stauffer faced 5 guys and gave up a single.  Pitched plenty well enough for a quick shutdown inning if Trev hadn't booted the grounder.  Seemed like the perfect time to use him IMO - a confidence building opportunity for a guy they're going to need down the stretch.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,onceamennonite,2,Sat Jun 6 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"Plouffe might not be lighting it up the last few games, but he still makes pitchers flail and sweat every time he's up.  He's going to get hot again any time now."

minnesotatwins,38tbza,vagrantwade,-1,Sat Jun 6 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"I'm so over Hicks, he has consistently proven he can't hit at the major league level. I swear he goes after the first pitch every time.  Santana is almost just as bad but actually can foul some off.  We might see Buxton and/or Polanco though this season so we've got that going for us."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,swashbucklerjak,3,Sat Jun 6 20:03:27 2015 UTC,"You haven't been watching if you don't think Hicks has competitive at-bats. Santana looks lost all the time. The opposite was true for that inning, but that isn't how it usually works."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,tennisspears,2,Sat Jun 6 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"If we had our choice between Santana and Hicks, I would take Hicks right now.  Santana proved he can hit last year, but he has got to be in one of the worst slumps I've seen.  He makes way too many errors and consistently strikes out.  He needs to go back to the AAAs and get his confidence up or something.  Hicks can at least play the outfield decently enough, but he does need to get better at batting."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,0,Sat Jun 6 20:06:33 2015 UTC,He needs to get better at batting is the biggest understatement ever.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"At least he can offer some defense.  Santana can't do either very well. Both have shown in the past, that they can be great ball players, but my god do they ever lose confidence and drop drastically."

minnesotatwins,38tbza,Tannekr,3,Sat Jun 6 20:01:13 2015 UTC,Danny Santana is one of the top 10 worst players in the entire major leagues mistakenly given regular playing time. Back to Rochester—now.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,ajdragoon,2,Sat Jun 6 19:52:47 2015 UTC,Come on Santana......please pull yourself out of this slump you are in and get us a hit or at least a sac fly.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 6 19:52:46 2015 UTC,Garza can't go into arcades out of fear of the Claw Machine.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,theAlphaginger,3,Sat Jun 6 19:52:39 2015 UTC,Nice fucking bunt!!!!  Good to see Garza has his old problems!  still feel bad for any player that makes an error
minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 6 19:51:22 2015 UTC,I feel that Hermann just might bunt here.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,Johnnymac98,0,Sat Jun 6 19:40:56 2015 UTC,And now Pressly walks the first two batters he faces. And his first 10 pitches being balls.  Did we stop sacrificing virgins to the baseball gods or something?  EDIT Correction...walked the first three batters with 12 straight balls.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,Vitamin_DC,0,Sat Jun 6 19:31:29 2015 UTC,We've only scored in 1 of 13 innings against one of the worst teams in baseball. Against two of the worst starting pitchers in baseball statistically.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,vagrantwade,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:30:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not too thrilled, either.  Aside from a couple innings in Boston the Twins didn't score much either.  Offense looks pretty bad, reminds me a bit of those ""Detroit First Week Twins"" that we all loathed."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,CentralAmerican,4,Sat Jun 6 19:35:07 2015 UTC,Segura really feeling the effects of that hit by pitch.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,NorseWolves,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:27:10 2015 UTC,Mauer is singlehandedly going to prevent a complete game from Garza.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,onceamennonite,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:26:30 2015 UTC,He must think he's Jeter.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,DelPennSotan,2,Sat Jun 6 19:19:09 2015 UTC,He better get some ribbing in the clubhouse tonight.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,kaiserj1982,9,Sat Jun 6 19:19:05 2015 UTC,Early reports saying Segura has been drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,FrankReynolds,3,Sat Jun 6 19:18:45 2015 UTC,Should be fined for that shit.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,sunderstormer,2,Sat Jun 6 19:18:34 2015 UTC,More likely he'll get plunked for real later.  Not that I endorse such tactics.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,onceamennonite,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:20:41 2015 UTC,"Looked like it might have brushed his forearm, did anyone see that? Definitely hit his bat though."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sat Jun 6 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"Not a chance, he was holding his hand... if it brushed his forearm he would have been rubbing that location."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,ItsThisEasy,2,Sat Jun 6 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, couldn't see what he was holding. Either way, hope he gets a nice boo next time he's up."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sat Jun 6 19:23:39 2015 UTC,I don't think it hit him at all.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,wstrauss,2,Sat Jun 6 19:19:02 2015 UTC,Haha what a fucking dork. Caught red handed bro .

minnesotatwins,38tbza,onceamennonite,2,Sat Jun 6 19:05:29 2015 UTC,Graham looks like Jane from Firefly.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:00:50 2015 UTC,Really hoping JR has some quick innings after this. They said he is on like a 70-75 pitch count.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 6 18:59:49 2015 UTC,Braun had his own line of Affliction clothing?  He's like a super douche.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,FlyingScissor,2,Sat Jun 6 18:57:59 2015 UTC,You'd think Gomez would learn from his baserunning mistakes.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,flopperazzi,3,Sat Jun 6 18:56:58 2015 UTC,Great throw by Rosario!
minnesotatwins,38tbza,wstrauss,3,Sat Jun 6 18:56:55 2015 UTC,Nice play Rosario and Santana!
minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 6 18:56:30 2015 UTC,I always like when Dick and Bert have conversations like this.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,theAlphaginger,4,Sat Jun 6 18:50:29 2015 UTC,I think it's more of Dick being tight with his money that he doesn't order room service.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,kaiserj1982,2,Sat Jun 6 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"No, he doesn't like eating in bed."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,wstrauss,2,Sat Jun 6 18:53:00 2015 UTC,But he wants to start a business where they bring breakfast in bed to people.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,theAlphaginger,3,Sat Jun 6 18:56:38 2015 UTC,Who doesn't like room service?
minnesotatwins,38tbza,kaiserj1982,6,Sat Jun 6 18:49:40 2015 UTC,My wallet....
minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,-2,Sat Jun 6 18:54:27 2015 UTC,I'm getting really tired of Wisconsin teams making Minnesota teams look silly.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,CentralAmerican,4,Sat Jun 6 18:46:44 2015 UTC,Seeing a lot of Molitor Brewers jerseys. Where do their loyalties lie?!
minnesotatwins,38tbza,tokomini,2,Sat Jun 6 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"I got no problem with it.  The loyalties are with Molitor, and I'm sure he smiles to see those jerseys in the stadium."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,onceamennonite,4,Sat Jun 6 18:50:32 2015 UTC,No one will boo Braun with me so I have to do it myself.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sat Jun 6 18:28:33 2015 UTC,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
minnesotatwins,38tbza,kaiserj1982,3,Sat Jun 6 18:34:30 2015 UTC,Great AB by Joe.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,FrankReynolds,2,Sat Jun 6 18:28:00 2015 UTC,If people are ever going to take this team seriously we need to be rolling these terrible teams.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,vagrantwade,2,Sat Jun 6 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"Man I remember Garza making his debut like it was yesterday, I feel old."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,ewok_bukkake,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:21:51 2015 UTC,Was at that game and the hype was unreal! It's a shame we let him go.

minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,0,Sat Jun 6 18:23:44 2015 UTC,Fuck steroids.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,cadderly09,4,Sat Jun 6 18:17:41 2015 UTC,Roid Braun

minnesotatwins,38tbza,Mailing_a_Bear,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:16:50 2015 UTC,Can't remember the last time I seen a double play like that. Took me a few seconds to realize that ball did not touch the ground.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,Mariox,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:16:42 2015 UTC,Nice.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,NorseWolves,5,Sat Jun 6 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"Hope to see Graham ""stirrup"" some strikeouts. i regret nothing"
minnesotatwins,38tbza,Mailing_a_Bear,3,Sat Jun 6 18:13:21 2015 UTC,GET OUT!
minnesotatwins,38tbza,kaiserj1982,4,Sat Jun 6 18:14:49 2015 UTC,Why is Graham starting? Did I miss something?
minnesotatwins,38tbza,ewok_bukkake,3,Sat Jun 6 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"The double header kind of screwed up our pitching rotation.  Usually we get a day off after the series with the double header, but as it was a make up day, we didn't."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jun 6 18:15:21 2015 UTC,"Listening to the Molitor interview on radio, it was so smooth. Gardy was always agitated whenever he did media."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,dirtywood,6,Sat Jun 6 17:58:28 2015 UTC,A day may come when we lose a series to the Brewers. But it is not this day. THIS DAY WE FIGHT!
minnesotatwins,38tbza,kaiserj1982,2,Sat Jun 6 17:38:56 2015 UTC,Stand! Men of the Twins!
minnesotatwins,38tbza,DoubleOhFour,2,Sat Jun 6 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"Eric Kendricks just crushed the HR Derby, if he doesn't work out as linebacker he might have a future in sports yet."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,tokomini,5,Sat Jun 6 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"Now if he'll just crush Rodgers multiple times this year, that'd be great."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,cadderly09,2,Sat Jun 6 18:17:11 2015 UTC,Time to bounce back.  Lets go boys!
minnesotatwins,38tbza,FrankReynolds,3,Sat Jun 6 17:26:37 2015 UTC,First game my wife has ever worked at Target Field the Twins have been in 1st.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,BigMorgan,3,Sat Jun 6 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Well an hour and a half wasn't early enough for a jersey, but my home Dozier pinstripes are way better anyway. I am going to get me one of those Molitor bobbleheads though."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,DetectiveWoofles,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:18:42 2015 UTC,Yeah we just got ours before they ran out. Dad worried me with his need for Hubert's bloody mary
minnesotatwins,38tbza,Derk-Derks,2,Sat Jun 6 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"Got here about the same time, but I was up in the skyway entrance.   If it makes you feel better, they're not really jerseys so much as mesh button up shirts, I'm wearing it under my Morneau for a reason."
minnesotatwins,38tbza,tokomini,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:39:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I noticed that. I did sell two tickets for today for $85 each so I may use that to buy some more Twins gear.
minnesotatwins,38tbza,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sat Jun 6 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"Awh I think it feels good! It's really thin and transparent but I rather dig it, not full of sponsorships"
minnesotatwins,38tbza,Derk-Derks,3,Sat Jun 6 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"(I'm trying to make him feel better over here.)  ...you're right about the sponsorship thing though, last time I got a Twins hat it looked like I was cheering for the Minnesota Dairy Queens."
minnesotatwins,38u9en,TwinsGameday,7,Sat Jun 6 21:44:56 2015 UTC,Sure enough the first games I go to all year the Brewers keep beating us. Hope we can salvage tomorrow's game but this looked rough. Bullpen is cracking and we are not stringing together the hits.   Personal highlight: I burped really loud and Bert looked at me.
minnesotatwins,38u9en,Derk-Derks,4,Sat Jun 6 21:52:40 2015 UTC,This team needs a DH
minnesotatwins,38u9en,hbxli,2,Sat Jun 6 22:25:17 2015 UTC,"Pinto isn't doing anything down in AAA. Arcia will have to earn his spot back. Vargas is batting .319/.400/.553 in 55 PA so maybe we'll see him make a return if he keeps it up. There's a kid named Danny Ortiz that's batting. .283/.332/.500 in 196 PA who plays in the outfield, so maybe we'll see him come up at some point. I personally want to see Santana sent down to try and get his swing back and move Escobar to short and bring someone to play DH that isn't just Escobar/Plouffe/Mauer."
minnesotatwins,38u9en,spin8x,3,Sat Jun 6 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"Another tough loss. Good to see the fans in the stands, hopefully the bats are going tomorrow and we get a good start."
minnesotatwins,38u9en,Khoops66,2,Sat Jun 6 22:01:15 2015 UTC,Still in 1st place.
minnesotatwins,38u9en,kaiserj1982,2,Sat Jun 6 22:30:06 2015 UTC,Would have been nice to build on that lead though eh?! Ugly couple of games! Especially when you attend with a brewers fan!
minnesotatwins,38u9en,rydethesnow,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:04:03 2015 UTC,"I was really depressed about this loss until I looked at the standings, saw we are still on top, then looked at the Tiger's record, and saw they've dropped 8 in a row. These two losses against the Brewers are bad, but haven't cost us anything in the division standings, and we are still doing much better than Cabrera's boys over in Detroit."
minnesotatwins,38u9en,Kripzo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"This was going to be a tough game to win with J.R. Graham starting. All in all, pretty damn decent pitching but bats didn't come through today.  Just a bad circumstance from the doubleheader. It happens. I'll be happy to avoid the sweep tomorrow. A sweep would be really disappointing."
minnesotatwins,38u9en,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:04:59 2015 UTC,Segura is a soccer diva.
minnesotatwins,38u9en,Cedarshake,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:26:17 2015 UTC,Inb4 Twins losses inevitable because high level stats are king sports commentators come in.
minnesotatwins,38u9en,BobtheDino96,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:52:02 2015 UTC,If we could stop playing down to their level that would be great.
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,Kripzo,5,Sat Jun 6 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"That type of retention is not possible in baseball. While some trades were pretty bad in hindsight, it's not worth getting caught up on. We have let talent slip through we've also stole a lot of talent from other teams."
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,ewok_bukkake,2,Sat Jun 6 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"According to my sketchy research of rosters back to 2005 and rated by current 2015 bWAR, the lineup would look something like this:  C - Wilson Ramos 1B - Joe Mauer 2B - Brian Dozier SS - Eduardo Escobar  3B - Trevor Plouffe  UT - Danny Valencia/Eduardo Nunez OF - Michael Cuddyer/Delmon Young/Carlos Gomez/Ben Revere DH - Kendrys Morales  SP - Pelfrey/Gibson/Liriano/May/Hughes RP - Perkins/Boyer/Neshek/Fien/Pressly/Thompson/Worley  I would definitely take JJ Hardy over Escobar, but he's been scuffling this season. I'd take Span over Delmon for sure too."
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,Aluminum_Love_Cradle,4,Mon Jun 8 16:40:17 2015 UTC,Uhm I'd assume  C: Mauer 1B: Morneau 2B: Dozier 3B: hum...plouffee? SS: Uh... OF: Span OF: Cuddyer OF: Gomez
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,PocketWocket,3,Sun Jun 7 02:49:15 2015 UTC,Can we add Thome as DH?   He and Cuddyer will forever be two of my favorite players.
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,skierface,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:06:28 2015 UTC,Love Thome but Ortiz would get the DH slot for me in this scenario.
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,RichardManuel,2,Sun Jun 7 22:52:40 2015 UTC,"Ortiz hasn't played for us in 13 years, so he wouldn't count in this scenario?"
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,Taub-NUT,2,Sun Jun 7 23:25:15 2015 UTC,Woops missed the 10 years caveat. Thome it is then.
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,RichardManuel,3,Sun Jun 7 23:27:03 2015 UTC,For shortstop - I hated the fact that we gave up on JJ Hardy after just one year.  ....I can't remember if it was a trade or we just didn't re-sign but point remains.
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,imissedthetoilet,5,Sun Jun 7 03:35:07 2015 UTC,It was a trade... For pitchers Jim Hoey and some other guy... Fuck Bill Smith
minnesotatwins,38u1pi,taffyowner,2,Sun Jun 7 04:03:01 2015 UTC,Brett Jacobson.  You know you got hosed when Him Hoey was the best player you brought back in a trade.

Also if you have St.Paul the state Capitol is there, you could always go to the MN science museum, the MN History Museum is over there too. I'd have to ask my friend since they actually live there but those are what I know to be here"

minnesotatwins,38qmjw,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sat Jun 6 02:53:03 2015 UTC,"Because we don't really have much more?  That game is pretty much lost, so we were trying to save some of our more valuable pitchers.  No sense in wearing out Boyer, Thompson, or Perkins.  Anytime we put Duensing or Stauffer in, we are just hoping our defense can keep up with the hits (which they normally do).  Fien just seems to be struggling at the moment, so he can't really go long either."

minnesotatwins,38o2i6,zieg0052,14,Fri Jun 5 13:44:28 2015 UTC,The bunt worked do to a fielding error. It wasn't a great bunt.
minnesotatwins,38o2i6,green920,20,Fri Jun 5 14:12:18 2015 UTC,"True enough, although the element of surprise can contribute to errors.  Nobody expected Mauer to lay one down, and I have to think both Sandoval and Swihart had a moment of ""wtf is happening"" that helped them just a little bit in their screwup.  (at the risk of being That Guy: due* to)"
minnesotatwins,38o2i6,onceamennonite,-11,Fri Jun 5 14:32:10 2015 UTC,Sandoval is a Major League 3rd baseman. Him being surprised by a bunt didn't force him to straight up miss catching a baseball that was thrown to him. Get real dude.

minnesotatwins,38o2i6,ajdragoon,2,Fri Jun 5 14:15:32 2015 UTC,"Right. It was a terrible bunt. If ML'ers yesterday knew how to field Dozier would have been out at third.  Yeah you could argue that the surprise is what threw off the catcher-3B connection, but I doubt that was part of the plan."

minnesotatwins,38o2i6,onceamennonite,6,Fri Jun 5 13:48:39 2015 UTC,Why was Dozier limping a little?
minnesotatwins,38o2i6,MLBVideoConverterBot,3,Fri Jun 5 15:26:45 2015 UTC,"During the slide into third, it looks like Sandoval's left foot catches Dozier just below the left knee. Not sure if the shoe was turned enough for cleats to make contact there too.  Probably just a little sore from that, and he shook it off quickly."

minnesotatwins,38m1bg,The_Effing_Eagle,10,Fri Jun 5 02:25:09 2015 UTC,"Another thing I like, is that Molitor is making players earn their spot on the big league roster, not just calling them back up after they are healthy. I'm glad Arcia has to show he's ready before getting back, everyone on the major league roster is contributing right now, that's why this team is SO FUN to watch! I'll be cheering the boys on Friday and Saturday vs Milwaukee from the stands!"
minnesotatwins,38m1bg,rydethesnow,4,Fri Jun 5 03:27:36 2015 UTC,"I do still think winning at this rate is unsustainable, but at some point the team will have enough wins that it won't matter. The playoffs are still a huge longshot, but a 90 loss season is increasingly unlikely."
minnesotatwins,38m1bg,thepaloalto,10,Fri Jun 5 02:27:55 2015 UTC,"I mean people seem to assume that regression means that they would will regress back down to a point that makes up for our success so far. My understanding (which may be wrong, I don't use that side of my brain often) is that regression just means that they would eventually start playing back to their expectations. So you need to look at what they've done so far as a bonus.  Maybe I'm not wording this well.  Say you predicted this team to be a .400 team. They play .600 ball to this point. For them to regress, they just start playing .400 ball at this point. The wins they got above the .400 ball are ours to keep, and they just play .400 from here on out.   Projections just had us playing around .460 ball. So from here on out if we regressed we would go 50w - 59l for the rest of the season, putting us at 82 - 80 for the season.  Maybe I misunderstand regression, but I highly doubt we get to 90 losses again.  edit: .460 ball is just over 75 wins, so we would have 'gained' 7 wins so far"
minnesotatwins,38m1bg,DirtBrother,4,Fri Jun 5 03:21:51 2015 UTC,"You are correct in your interpretation of regression, as I understand it. Honestly that is the main reason I'm so happy with how well we have done so far--as long as we play even OK the rest of the season our result at the end of the year will be a HUGE improvement."
minnesotatwins,38m1bg,ajdragoon,5,Fri Jun 5 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"You're right, and thanks for being so. Too many baseball fans like using statistics words without having any idea what they're talking about. ""Regress to the mean"" is often used as a synonym for ""get significantly worse"", and that's conceptually wrong.   But you also have to remember that baseball projections are based on models, and models can very well be incorrect. So when we're talking about regressing to a mean, the mean itself could be off. I'm a science/numbers guy but I'm not afraid to admit that, you know, baseball players are human, and we humans can act in a number of ways that numerical models can't capture."
minnesotatwins,38m1bg,rydethesnow,3,Fri Jun 5 12:41:21 2015 UTC,I would love seeing a WINNING season!

minnesotatwins,38m1bg,thepaloalto,2,Fri Jun 5 04:14:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Not sure if the concept is right, but that is my understanding at least.   I know I would be pumped to see an 82-80 season. I was just hoping to not have 90 losses this season, and even though a lot has happened between March and now, meeting that goal is an improvement which is all I need."

minnesotatwins,38ljtj,casual_sociopathy,6,Fri Jun 5 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on the game:   Ugh, the first two innings were BRUTAL. And not just the errors--the goddamn poor contact resulting in baserunners. I didn't think Milone was that bad, but he was getting unlucky as all hell. Really frustrating.  Ok, now the errors. I could do nothing but laugh because it was so unbelievable. Baseball is weird sometimes. Suzuki was having none of that knuckleball bullshit. And thank god, because it was giving everyone else hell for awhile. Also annoying: throughout the series there were so many warning track drives but not enough doubles or balls hit out. How many times was I gonna see a ball get caught inches away from that ugly wall in left? Stay tuned to find out! I was actually relived at the Swihart homer for being the first hard hit ball of the game. ...I was annoyed by the Dusty homer. One of those was enough. That damn tease of a 4th inning with Torii's baserunning error. Argh. ...But he made it up for it during that AWESOME 5th inning. Happy 200th with the Twins! This is when I started to feel the comeback. This is also when the mood in Fenway changed sharply. The Panda overthrow letting Escobar reach and Suzuki continuing to have none of that knuckleball bullshit was so, so awesome. The Sox fans behind me starting talking about Sandoval having fried chicken in the dugout. Duensing with one on and Ortiz up had me on the edge of my seat, but he and Fien got the job done. Phew. Thanks for making a dumb out at 3rd, Hanley. Oh, and thanks to Napoli for thinking he could make it home with the ball at second! What was he thinking?! Hey, not complaining. Thompson made it interesting but no damage was done. Ah, top 9. I've seen Uehara close out a lot, so I really hoped he could get beat up for once. And oh did he. Lots of good at-bats against a tough pitcher. Mauer's bunt was awful, but Sandoval came through again with a big fail. And hell, even Plouffe's bat woke up. Woo! We were only up 2 at this point, but the Fenway faithful started leaving. The 2015 Sox fans are not believers. Escobar's at-bat! Almost had a HR but followed it up with a double off the wall (finally!) I love when that happens. Now Fenway started to really empty. But hey, a deflated Fenway is the best Fenway. And then Perkins came in to seal the deal.    Embarrassingly sloppy game defensively, but the comeback and late-game offense were epic. Despite the rocky start the series ends on a high note. Bring on the Brew Crew!  (As for me, I think I've had enough Fenway for a few years...)"

minnesotatwins,38j7kr,Kripzo,3,Thu Jun 4 19:44:42 2015 UTC,Not like he'd ask for or get any 23 mil offers either.

minnesotatwins,38j7kr,doublea08,2,Fri Jun 5 14:14:11 2015 UTC,"oh man that would be hell, watching him win MVP and batting titles for the cubs. Mean while we'd get one great season from Prior (insert steve bartman ending their season here) and I'm pretty sure he only played for 5 years."
minnesotatwins,38j7kr,roybringus,6,Fri Jun 5 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"Good place to put him, but I would have A-rod at 1, Griffey Jr. at 2 and Chipper Jones at 3."
minnesotatwins,38j7kr,headbangershappyhour,4,Thu Jun 4 20:27:17 2015 UTC,Chipper is 1 because he spent his career with the Braves. Even in the article they said A-Rod is the best overall #1 pick but this list is the impact for the team that drafted him. A-Rod is a closed book for the purpose of this list unless he goes back to Seattle.
minnesotatwins,38j7kr,John_Palomino,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:22:00 2015 UTC,"Disagree. I think the argument for Chipper is a solid one. While Arod has the ring as well it came with an already loaded Yankees, the * next to Arod has been and always will be the steroid use. I can see putting Arod @ 2 but I think Chipper still deserves to be #1 because he probably did it clean.   Now if Arod breaks Bonds' record...there might not be an argument.  And I think Griffey needs to be below at least one title winner, if not both"
minnesotatwins,38j7kr,leftshoe18,5,Thu Jun 4 21:44:14 2015 UTC,How can you fault Griffey for not winning a title when there's 24 other players on a team?
minnesotatwins,38j7kr,turiel16,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree, this is factoring in the pick from the team who had it. Just because arod was great didn't mean it was as good a pick for the mariners Vs chipper for the braves."

minnesotatwins,38fum8,AntonSquaredMe,6,Thu Jun 4 00:47:11 2015 UTC,Trevor May has walked only one guy in his last four starts (including this one) and has struck out 24 (so far) in those same four starts.

minnesotatwins,38fum8,Fortehlulz33,6,Thu Jun 4 00:33:43 2015 UTC,if Trevor May pitches like this all the time then we win that Revere trade

minnesotatwins,38fum8,CentralAmerican,5,Thu Jun 4 00:25:26 2015 UTC,why was he not square to the batter

minnesotatwins,38fum8,onceamennonite,4,Thu Jun 4 00:03:01 2015 UTC,did Bremer really just suggest that May is on the cutting block of players to get sent down?
minnesotatwins,38fum8,taffyowner,5,Thu Jun 4 00:02:20 2015 UTC,God I hope not. Maybe a good start tonight saves him?
minnesotatwins,38fum8,Jorgenstern8,3,Thu Jun 4 00:04:26 2015 UTC,I don't think that is what he meant.

minnesotatwins,38fum8,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Wed Jun 3 23:57:36 2015 UTC,May is looking stellar
minnesotatwins,38fum8,ChiefakaJames,5,Wed Jun 3 23:57:10 2015 UTC,May is rolling.

minnesotatwins,38fum8,ChiefakaJames,5,Wed Jun 3 23:56:52 2015 UTC,Tomorrow.

minnesotatwins,38fum8,thepaloalto,5,Wed Jun 3 23:48:22 2015 UTC,May is looking solid.
minnesotatwins,38fum8,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Wed Jun 3 23:46:03 2015 UTC,Oof thought that brushed the jersey
minnesotatwins,38fum8,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Wed Jun 3 23:45:10 2015 UTC,Loving May's locations so far

minnesotatwins,38fum8,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed Jun 3 23:44:19 2015 UTC,I wish I could watch the game and listen to the radio broadcast on Xbox
minnesotatwins,38fum8,AntonSquaredMe,2,Wed Jun 3 23:45:49 2015 UTC,Gladden makes listening to the radio worth it. Sometimes I think he forgets he's on the radio.

minnesotatwins,38fum8,AntonSquaredMe,4,Wed Jun 3 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"Haha! WHAT?!  In the first game, for a minimum of 5 minutes, Gladden & Provus were entertaining the notion that Gladden should be in tonight's lineup! FIVE SOLID MINUTES! The game was going on!"
minnesotatwins,38fum8,babyinavikinghat,5,Wed Jun 3 23:52:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they even kept cutting to the booth, so you could see the guy moving the lamp around to block the other guy's view. Haha. Hilarious.  It was a big deal for them to find an outlet for it even. Instead of a view of the field, I got to watch and old man climb under a desk, unplug his phone charger, and plug in the lamp.  Goddamn it Boston."
minnesotatwins,38fum8,AntonSquaredMe,3,Wed Jun 3 23:55:33 2015 UTC,OMG. I have to say that the way you describe it actually makes it sound really funny! XD

minnesotatwins,38fum8,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Wed Jun 3 23:40:15 2015 UTC,That pop out was almost a homer!
minnesotatwins,38fum8,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed Jun 3 23:39:55 2015 UTC,Fucking Fenway
minnesotatwins,38fum8,tennisspears,5,Wed Jun 3 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure why we would blame Fenway on that one. That's an easy flyout in any normal park. The wall is high, but it isn't that deep."
minnesotatwins,38fum8,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed Jun 3 23:42:15 2015 UTC,"No I'm not blaming Fenway, I'm just saying that it was only close because of Fenway."
minnesotatwins,38fum8,tennisspears,3,Wed Jun 3 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, makes sense. My bad."
minnesotatwins,38fum8,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed Jun 3 23:45:35 2015 UTC,Dozier goes yard here
minnesotatwins,38fum8,AdaAstra,4,Wed Jun 3 23:39:33 2015 UTC,Almost....almost.
minnesotatwins,38fum8,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed Jun 3 23:40:02 2015 UTC,"So close, yet so far"
minnesotatwins,38fum8,AdaAstra,5,Wed Jun 3 23:41:06 2015 UTC,I love the pitch count for the Red Sox.  Keep going up.....keep going UP!
minnesotatwins,38fum8,AdaAstra,3,Wed Jun 3 23:39:01 2015 UTC,"Excellent!  He almost beat that out too.  If there is one thing Santana hasn't change with, is he is still freaking fast.  Just wish he would get out of his slump hitting and making stupid mistakes on defense."
minnesotatwins,38fum8,ChiefakaJames,3,Wed Jun 3 23:38:19 2015 UTC,Danny is an above-average bunter.
minnesotatwins,38fum8,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,5,Wed Jun 3 23:38:05 2015 UTC,Atta boy Danny! Nice little safety squeeze. Very Piranha like.

minnesotatwins,38fum8,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Wed Jun 3 23:41:58 2015 UTC,Blame Ozzie G!
minnesotatwins,38fum8,ChiefakaJames,3,Wed Jun 3 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"I love Ozzie, but that's one of the worst things he did as White Sox manager."

minnesotatwins,38fum8,CentralAmerican,4,Wed Jun 3 23:38:43 2015 UTC,Great work on that bunt RBI Santana!  Safety squeeze!
minnesotatwins,38fum8,ChiefakaJames,3,Wed Jun 3 23:37:46 2015 UTC,Lets hope the Hicks and Rosario stretch that they've been having continues.

minnesotatwins,38fum8,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Wed Jun 3 23:34:24 2015 UTC,Gimme those Fenway hits all day!
minnesotatwins,38fum8,CentralAmerican,3,Wed Jun 3 23:34:03 2015 UTC,Attaboy Hermann!
minnesotatwins,38flez,TRone33,4,Wed Jun 3 21:58:51 2015 UTC,I enjoyed your ballpark so much! I would rather watch a game here than go to Miller Park. Loved the experience and I can't wait to come back again.
minnesotatwins,38flez,onceamennonite,2,Wed Jun 3 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it!  I've only been there a couple of times myself, but yeah it was an ""instant classic"" feel.  Been a long time since I visited Wrigley -- is it much different since the renovations?  And I haven't been to Miller Park at all yet, though a friend of mine there is bugging me to come visit, so that might happen."
minnesotatwins,38flez,MrLittleThor,2,Thu Jun 4 02:08:15 2015 UTC,I haven't been to Wrigley yet this year so I can't really say much about what it is now. Last year I sat on the rooftops while I still could.  I am a firm believer in baseball being played outside. Miller is just disgusting to me.
minnesotatwins,38flez,CantaloupeCamper,2,Thu Jun 4 02:54:05 2015 UTC,I love wrigley just as much! I had the ability to road trip down to Chicago with some friends and loved visiting Wrigley. US cellular on the other hand... whew. probably doesn't help i went there when it was one of A-Rod's first game back from his suspension.
minnesotatwins,38flez,fgobill,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:10:44 2015 UTC,Notice the lack of pee in cups compared to Wrigley too!
minnesotatwins,38flez,ajdragoon,2,Fri Jun 5 02:31:03 2015 UTC,I am a fuzzy dot in the first picture. I was down in row 9 off the third base dugout. That ended up being a great game!
minnesotatwins,38jwab,NotPercyChuggs,12,Thu Jun 4 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"Slugging isn't exactly what Mauer is good at. His on base percentage is really all that matters for the hitter in an RBI spot- if they can advance runners from scoring position they are doing their job. Is he still that low in OBP?  Edit: He is 4th in AL Avg and 6th in OBP. Ahead of such players as Pujols, Napoli, and Encarnacion. I wouldn't be too worried."
minnesotatwins,38jwab,Kripzo,3,Thu Jun 4 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He already has 30 RBIs this season and he had 55 total last year. He's not a prototypical power-hitting first baseman, so he's not going to have that slugging number anyway. As it stands now, his OPS is average to slightly below-average and will likely improve as the season progresses."
minnesotatwins,38jwab,Kruse,-8,Thu Jun 4 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"RBI's are 100% a result of Dozier getting on base ahead of him. You know, Brian Dozier, the guy who, along with Plouffe, has carried this team offensively, not the 23 million dollar man."
minnesotatwins,38jwab,Kripzo,-7,Thu Jun 4 20:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, he is. OPS is ON BASE plus SLUGGING. His .322 OBP isn't exactly sterling either. And we all know he isn't going to be doing much slugging any time soon.  Dude is 32 years old and his production has fallen off considerably in the last year+ (all of 2014 and the first 2+ months of this season). But hey, he's Joe Mauer, he won an MVP award in 2009, so he's above criticism when he's playing like shit for extended periods of time."
minnesotatwins,38jwab,The_Effing_Eagle,4,Thu Jun 4 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is claiming he is MVP quality anymore. Also he has faced more injuries the last few seasons than ever before, so it is expected his performance wouldn't be the same. He carries the reputation of one of our best players, and so far he is still one of our best this season. You can think differently if you want, I don't really care."
minnesotatwins,38jwab,Kripzo,-2,Thu Jun 4 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"Explain to me how he is one of our best players. Please. Bring some facts to this discussion, and not just opinions based on what he's done in the past.  Tell me how he has been better than Dozier. Or Plouffe. Or Hunter. Or Glen Perkins. Or fuck, even Mike Pelfrey and Kyle Gibson.   Kennys Vargas, by most accounts, was pretty bad when the Twins sent him down, right? He was slugging .362. Joe Mauer, after last nights game, was slugging .361. First base is a power position, especially in the American League.  Oswaldo Arcia cannot get a spot back on the 25 man roster after coming back from an injury. Apparently he's been ineffective according to the Twins? Arcia was hitting .276/.338/.379 with 2 HR's before being sent down. Mauer, as of yesterdays game, is hitting .268/.322/.361 with 1 home run. A 24 year old outfielder who hit 20 HR's last year is in AAA because THAT slash line isn't good enough. Mauer puts up WORSE numbers, but since he's a 32 year old former MVP, he escapes criticism.  But hey, don't let these silly ""facts"" and ""statistics"" stand in the way of your opinion that by golly, that St. Paul guy Joe Mauer sure is one heckuva ballplayer and one of the best guys they got!"
minnesotatwins,38jwab,jargonista,2,Thu Jun 4 21:23:07 2015 UTC,"These aren't exactly huge sample sizes yet. I don't think Mauer is a better asset to the team than a lot of those people you mentioned, but he's currently playing below the level we've expected from him the last few years even, so he should be expected to regress to his average. It sucks, but I'm not sure what could be done at this point"
minnesotatwins,38jwab,jargonista,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"If you want to talk about things on the basic form of statistics you are using to support your claim, we could also say fucking Nunez is our best hitter... Mauer, Dozier, Hunter, and Plouffe are separated .019 OBP. Wanna calculate that and tell me if it's statistically significant? Wanna show me the ANOVA test results from that? Wanna tell me how .019 OBP makes all the difference between the golden god that is Dozier and the shithole AA quality player that is Mauer? Or maybe we could look at batting average, where Mauer and Dozier are tied, and Mauer is ahead of Plouffe. Or maybe RBI's, where Mauer is tied with Plouffe and ahead of Dozier. Dozier might have 2 more hits than Mauer, sure, but he has struck out 15 times more than him as well. Go ahead and stand on your soap box and shout about how the face of the franchise sucks, I'm sure you picked a great place to do it and will convince a lot of people you are ""right""."
minnesotatwins,38jwab,The_Effing_Eagle,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"I don't expect people here to take facts that conflict with their misguided, rose tinted view and change their minds.  If you can't see how Dozier is a better player than Mauer right now, you are incapable of having an intelligent discussion about baseball in general, so I won't attempt to have one."

minnesotatwins,38ezc8,two_four,2,Wed Jun 3 22:44:01 2015 UTC,This would make more sense if Hughes was actually good. He was an okay pitcher who never walked anyone last year.

minnesotatwins,38dpnd,Markoshollo,-3,Wed Jun 3 18:02:45 2015 UTC,There is a reason why some are Triple A pitchers.
minnesotatwins,38dpnd,59179,2,Wed Jun 3 18:14:40 2015 UTC,3 walks in like 50 innings is bad? what you smokin?
minnesotatwins,38dpnd,Markoshollo,-8,Wed Jun 3 18:25:32 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you're not getting this. Let me explain r-e-a-l slow:  He has proved he's good in AAA. What he hasn't proved this year is can he refrain from walking major league hitters.   Is he only a AAA pitcher?
minnesotatwins,38dpnd,59179,5,Wed Jun 3 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"Oh so you're just a dick, aren't you"

minnesotatwins,38dpnd,59179,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:30:24 2015 UTC,i mean he has 2 games this year with 2 walks which is pretty good. I mean the games with 4 and 3 walks aren't great but it's not like he is walking 5+ in multiple games.

minnesotatwins,38e3nw,AntonSquaredMe,6,Wed Jun 3 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"Eduardo Rodriguez on the mound this afternoon for the Red Sox. 3-pitch left-handed pitcher, a fastball up to 95-96mph, a change-up around 86-88mph, and a slider around 84-86mph. Rodriguez was the return for the trade with Baltimore when the O's got reliever Andrew Miller. He is considered Boston's second best pitching prospect to Henry Owens.  He only has one Major League start to go on, but he did very well against the Rangers last time out. Seven and two thirds innings, gave up only three hits, walked two, and struck out seven.  In AAA this year, Rodriguez was 4-3 with a 2.98 ERA (2.37 FIP), 44 strikeouts to only 7 walks in 48.1 IP."

Not quite as impactful as Torii's obviously but it was still fun.

minnesotatwins,38aa9g,AntonSquaredMe,3,Wed Jun 3 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"It's just crazy how long of a leash Santana has had all year long. All winter and spring, Molitor and Ryan talked about how he was going to be the starting SS, and how there absolutely wasn't going to be a competition for the job. Now he is struggling hard and he still is in the lineup every day. I don't get it."
minnesotatwins,38aa9g,tennisspears,3,Wed Jun 3 00:27:33 2015 UTC,Who do the Twins have to replace him?

Nunez could do it too, although I would prefer if he were just the backup, because his defense is questionable at best.  The other option is Jorge Polanco, who is tearing it up in AA and had a taste of the big leagues last year. I would only want him up if he was given the starting job and playing every day. If he was just going to back up Escobar, I would prefer he stay in the minors a bit longer."

minnesotatwins,38aa9g,Bickle19,2,Wed Jun 3 00:32:27 2015 UTC,"It is really mind boggling. I can't see any reason that some time down in AAA would hurt him at this point. He wasn't expected to stay when he was first called up, and while it was nice to see him do so well last year, it should be clear that his production wasn't sustainable and he could really develop more as a player."

minnesotatwins,38aa9g,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:38:34 2015 UTC,God damn Ortiz hit that hard.  I thought for sure that was gone.
minnesotatwins,38aa9g,AdaAstra,2,Tue Jun 2 23:32:50 2015 UTC,The 420 at the top of the triangle and a high wall makes it thankfully very difficult.
minnesotatwins,38aa9g,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 2 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"Thank goodness for that center field. Pelfrey made a couple nice pitches that inning, the last one to Pedroia especially."
minnesotatwins,38aa9g,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:26:46 2015 UTC,"3/3 first pitch strikes is good, considering falling behind hitters what he was struggling with in his last few starts."
minnesotatwins,38aa9g,tennisspears,2,Tue Jun 2 23:36:10 2015 UTC,Now in the 2nd he's missing kinda badly.
minnesotatwins,38aa9g,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 2 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"It sucks because he was right at the bottom of the zone with his first two pitches to Sandoval, especially the first one, but Suzuki framed them both absolutely horribly, and he was behind 2-0 right away.   (BrooksBaseball has them a little lower than MLB.com and the K-zone on the Red Sox broadcast. Both of those had the first pitch touching the bottom of the zone. Either way, Suzuki dropped his glove after catching each of them.)"

minnesotatwins,387gfo,sideburn_sensei,5,Tue Jun 2 13:48:30 2015 UTC,"I mean maybe its lacking some of the creature comforts many of us have become accustomed to when going to a game, but for me it was like taking the hajj, and I believe it should be a required pilgrimage for anyone who is a fan of this beautiful game. Sure the concessions and merch are pricey, however as a visitor (MN resident), and huge fan of baseball and its history I immensely enjoyed it. If comfort where my main concern I don't think I'd attend a game at Fenway or any other park all year as I've got a damn comfortable couch and relatively inexpensive beer right in my own home. For me going to Fenway was much more about seeing the hallowed ground that greats such as Williams, Ruth, Fox, and Yaz once walked than it was about anything else."
minnesotatwins,387gfo,ajdragoon,3,Tue Jun 2 15:00:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, these are great points. But if you live in Boston and it's just another part of the city, it loses the historical appeal and you just kind of view it as an outdated park, on some level.  Of course, they should never change parks!"
minnesotatwins,387gfo,casual_sociopathy,5,Tue Jun 2 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"Uncomfortable and tight and expensive and you have to use a third party site to figure out if there's a pole in front of you. Look, history is cool and all, but eventually we need to face the facts."

minnesotatwins,389spd,pman5595,4,Tue Jun 2 20:39:19 2015 UTC,"My guess is because Molitor is playing Santana at SS for some reason, but he still wants Escobar to play."
minnesotatwins,389spd,Tannekr,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:28:23 2015 UTC,Neither Santana nor Escobar should start regularly.
minnesotatwins,389spd,Tannekr,6,Tue Jun 2 21:52:17 2015 UTC,"Well, we need a shortstop, and Escobar has shown he's probably the best of the bunch we have. I don't mind putting him there and then putting Robinson in left."
minnesotatwins,389spd,ChiefakaJames,2,Tue Jun 2 22:06:32 2015 UTC,"I'm in the Free Jorge camp, but yeah, Escobar is currently the best as far as SS goes right now."
minnesotatwins,389spd,SplurgingSpurgeon,0,Tue Jun 2 22:17:47 2015 UTC,Nuñez? He's way better than either Escobar or Santana.
minnesotatwins,389spd,SplurgingSpurgeon,4,Tue Jun 2 22:07:19 2015 UTC,Nunez has not been good.
minnesotatwins,389spd,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"WRC+: Escobar: 64 Santana: 49 Nunez: 149  Nunez is definitely a better fielder than the disaster that Danny's been, and there's no way Escobar's better enough in the field to make up for the hitting."
minnesotatwins,389spd,tennisspears,2,Tue Jun 2 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"Nunez can't hit though.   .188 AVG in the last 7 games, don't want his bat in the lineup at all. With the way the team is playing, keep it the same for now."
minnesotatwins,389spd,The_Effing_Eagle,2,Tue Jun 2 22:21:31 2015 UTC,WRC+ over the last 2 weeks: Escobar: 4 Santana: -34 Nunez: 83
minnesotatwins,389spd,taffyowner,2,Tue Jun 2 22:25:38 2015 UTC,Really don't care about all these advanced stats. Nunez has looked terrible at the plate and changing things up just to change them when we've been winning is not a smart move.

The Twins are winning without ""stars"" -- and that is part of the team identity.  I don't watch the ASG, and haven't cared about it for a long time.  Not since it changed from peer selection basis to popular vote years ago.  For me the all star break is just a few days without baseball."

Gonsalves' numbers this season are definitely eye opening but prospects are ranked more in relation to their stuff than their numbers. Stewart's upside and stuff is still arguably much better than Gonsalves'. Having said that, Gonsalves has jumped way up prospect charts with these performances."
minnesotatwins,385ii2,Heyitscharlie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:03:11 2015 UTC,"Before the season most experts had Gonsalves our 5th best starting pitching prospect behind Meyer, Berrios, Stewart, and Thorpe. With Meyer struggling mightily and Thorpe having TJ surgery I would put Gonsalves ahead of those two at the moment. As far as Stewart, I am a little concerned about him staying healthy. He has already had shoulder trouble last year and elbow inflamation this year. Also his strikeout rate this year has not been good. Some of that has to do with his elbow, and not being able to use his slider as much, but it is still a bit concerning.   I guess we will see who is farther along in their development soon, as I expect Gonsalves to be promoted to Fort Myers sometime this month."

minnesotatwins,383no0,ShortWhiteFriend,11,Mon Jun 1 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think one key factor is, despite the pitching not being off the charts, the pitching has been steady.   Aside from a few hiccups, they have minimized big innings that allow the game to go out of reach. Instead, a couple of runs may score and put the other team ahead, but the game is still reasonably within their grasp."
minnesotatwins,383no0,Kruse,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  We know we're not going to have guys go out there and throw 8 innings of one run ball every night, but we know our pitching is usually only going to give up 3-4 runs.   If you take out the 5 games where the Twins got shelled and gave up 10 or more runs, the staff has given up a combined 3.34 runs per game while we've scored 4.79 runs per game."
minnesotatwins,383no0,FrankReynolds,7,Tue Jun 2 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"I thought the Sports Illustrated power rankings for this week were hilarious.  They have a staff vote determine the order and the Twins are at 8th with their high vote being 1st and their low vote being 18th.  So someone at SI thinks they're the best team in baseball and someone else at SI thinks they're 18th.  Something tells me that second person is from Detroit, Kansas City, Chicago, or Cleveland. lol"
minnesotatwins,383no0,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,3,Mon Jun 1 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that our pitching for the last four years has been constantly ranked last, and this year is in the middle of the pack.  No sustainable statistics bs."

minnesotatwins,38094w,BrianDoziersHair,23,Sun May 31 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like this team is going to call attention to the importance of good coaching and mentality. You can see that the Twins are really having fun out there and making smart decision.  I think one of the defining moments in this game was when Dozier got a double. He flexed, grabbed his bicep, and pointed at the Twins dugout like ""alright guys, hit me in"", like it was expected. How motivating is that? How do you transfer that kind of confidence into explaining the Twins' absurd RISP hitting?  We see Mauer and Dozier with their fun handshake, and the big outfield triple bump we do. This team has great chemistry, and I love watching them."
minnesotatwins,38094w,grensley,1 point,Sun May 31 22:50:22 2015 UTC,good coaching and mentality.    Which is why I wish they would fire Robin already.
minnesotatwins,38094w,PigFarmington,22,Mon Jun 1 12:55:02 2015 UTC,"Every time there's a temporary exception to the statistical patterns of baseball, people jump all over them and are ultimately proven wrong. Hits make runs, runs win games, and the Twins are winning games at a pace way above that at which they're getting hits. Opposite on the pitching side. There's no magic here, just a slightly better team and a little bit of luck.  I'm really enjoying watching them be competitive. I just don't think they're some special proof that baseball statisticians are out of touch eggheads who don't know what they're talking about. They're unlikely to keep up this pace, but I hope they do. They could finish out the year playing .500 baseball and make the playoffs."
minnesotatwins,38094w,obsidianop,2,Sun May 31 23:31:01 2015 UTC,"I just don't think they're some special proof that baseball statisticians are out of touch eggheads who don't know what they're talking about.   Ditto to this. We shouldn't be afraid of stats! But we should be annoyed at armchair sabermetricians who use terms like ""law of averages"" and ""regression"" without really knowing what they're talking about. Those are the guys saying how this can't be happening without real evidence.  That being said, the Twins won't win 20 games every month. But there's no reason to believe they'll have a massive implosion."

minnesotatwins,3843ew,RichardManuel,3,Mon Jun 1 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, even if the roster was determined by WAR, we'd still just have 1 player (Dozier). See  this post from /r/baseball."
minnesotatwins,3843ew,tennisspears,0,Mon Jun 1 19:14:11 2015 UTC,And Perkins. But I think Dozier is the only player that really deserves to start. I just don't think 9 Royals players deserve the All-Star recognition
minnesotatwins,3843ew,tennisspears,3,Mon Jun 1 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"Have you seen what Jason Kipnis did in May? Dozier isn't a shoo-in by any means. Altuve and Kinsler are also fairly deserving candidates. It's just a stacked position right now, which sucks because SS is an absolutely pathetic position in the AL this year. (I do agree that Infante belongs nowhere near the top of the list for 2B.)"
minnesotatwins,3843ew,tennisspears,0,Mon Jun 1 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"Kipnis deserves to be #1 or #2 right in voting honestly. Dozier isn't a shoo-in but definitely better than Infante, and personally Kinsler and Pedroia (they are pretty much just singles machines). Catcher is pretty bad in AL too. I mean Perez is playing ok but not amazing and there really isn't anyone else"
minnesotatwins,3843ew,roybringus,2,Mon Jun 1 19:51:05 2015 UTC,"Stephen Vogt is batting .322/.411/.611 this year. He should be starting, and Perez is a totally fine second or third catcher to make the team. Russell Martin is also pretty good, and Brian McCann has been playing well lately too.  Let's not forget that Kurt Freakin' Suzuki was an AL All-Star last year, behind Derek Norris and Perez. I would argue that Vogt-Perez-Martin this year would be a much better catcher lineup than Perez-Norris-Suzuki was last year.  Edit: Also, I'm not downvoting you. Might be Royals fans coming in since you posted on their sub."
minnesotatwins,3843ew,John_Palomino,0,Mon Jun 1 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"Yes my bad, I kinda forgot about Vogt. But the NL has much better catchers than the AL at the moment. Even Norris is doing pretty well with San Diego this year. But yes, Vogt-Perez-Martin would be better"
minnesotatwins,3843ew,tenthreeleader,-1,Mon Jun 1 20:07:26 2015 UTC,"also, when I said that Dozier is really the only player that deserves to start, I meant for Twins players."
minnesotatwins,3843ew,tennisspears,2,Mon Jun 1 19:53:13 2015 UTC,"I realized that's what you meant, but I would say Dozier should be firmly behind Kipnis right now, just as Plouffe should be behind Donaldson. Dozier and Plouffe could both be All-Stars, but neither should start at this point."
minnesotatwins,3843ew,AdaAstra,0,Mon Jun 1 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree with you. But I was saying out of all of the Twin's players, Dozier has the best chance of actually starting. But yes, Dozier is behind Kipnis and it would be hard to pass him at this point"

minnesotatwins,3805wd,onceamennonite,15,Sun May 31 21:43:18 2015 UTC,PRAISE CARLTON
minnesotatwins,3805wd,novafire08,16,Sun May 31 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"One of our best wins of the year so far.    Starting pitcher leaves the game in the 2nd with no outs.  Bullpen goes 8 innings, 2 ER vs. the best offensive team in the MLB and the hottest hitter in the AL.  Come back from 4-1 to tie (thank you Plouffe) Cough up a run in the top half of the next inning, but score two in the bottom half (thank you Torii)   As for the series as a whole, we drop the opener in rare heartbreaking fashion yet still take the series to claim the best home record in the AL at 19-7.   I wish it could be May forever.    EDIT: The prettiest thing I've ever seen. Twins atop the Central."
minnesotatwins,3805wd,tokomini,13,Sun May 31 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"I don't want it to be May forever, then it would never be October."
minnesotatwins,3805wd,novafire08,7,Sun May 31 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"Fair point. Let's have it be May until late August, then we'll return to the Gregorian calendar and it can be October when the time comes.   Of course that means I won't be able to celebrate my birthday in June, but sacrifices need to be made."
minnesotatwins,3805wd,tokomini,5,Sun May 31 22:01:52 2015 UTC,"If you aren't turning 18, 21, or 25, it doesn't matter."

minnesotatwins,3805wd,novafire08,12,Sun May 31 22:02:40 2015 UTC,"Royals lose, Astros lose, Twins now with the best record in the American League."
minnesotatwins,3805wd,ChiefakaJames,13,Sun May 31 22:04:02 2015 UTC,The Twins got 20 wins in May and won eight of their nine series!  THIS TRAIN DON'T STOP
minnesotatwins,3805wd,novafire08,10,Sun May 31 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"What a gutsy win. Great job by the bullpen. They weren't perfect, but got the big outs and really kept us in it after Ricky left. Have to give props to the top of the lineup getting those huge late runs and proving we CAN score after the first!"
minnesotatwins,3805wd,Derk-Derks,9,Sun May 31 21:42:48 2015 UTC,How big was that throw out at the plate in retrospect. I'm going to chalk this win up to good coaching. That's the kind of instinctive play that's hard to represent in stats: Knowing to throw home instead of try the double play against a fast hitter.
minnesotatwins,3805wd,grensley,10,Sun May 31 21:56:45 2015 UTC,A 20-7 May. WOW!

To have Nolasco go down early and have the bullpen throw 8 innings and come back from being down twice......incredible win today and a gutsy series win. This team is showing a lot of character.

I love this team, and I really hope they keep winning.  That said, I base my predictions off of quantifiable things, there are many things that sabr stats acknowledge that aren't quantifiable. Hot streaks are proven things, but you cannot do anything predictive with hot streaks, because no one knows when they will end. The Twins will be up in my power rankings this week, but I don't think they will be in my top ten. When you look at the Nationals, Dodgers, Cardinals,  Giants, Royals, Tigers, Astros, Cubs, Mets, and Pirates, they not only have had success on the field, but also have quantifiable and predictive statistics to back up their success. That said, I think there are maybe 2-4 other teams I would think of putting in front of the Twins based solely on predictions, but they should be in the top half of my rankings."

minnesotatwins,3801o2,gopherman23,1 point,Sun May 31 23:40:14 2015 UTC,Is rick still our coach?
minnesotatwins,3801o2,taksark,4,Mon Jun 1 00:26:43 2015 UTC,No. Neil Allen is the pitching coach.
minnesotatwins,3801o2,RichardManuel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:51:01 2015 UTC,I heard that Gardy clashed with the front office. Is that accurate?
minnesotatwins,3801o2,imissedthetoilet,5,Mon Jun 1 00:53:45 2015 UTC,I hadn't heard that. That would be hard for me to believe. He always seemed to have a good relationship with the front office and players. I get the feeling if Gardy showed up tomorrow - he would receive a warm welcome by all. He actually did show up during Spring Training which was really cool and got a warm welcome.
minnesotatwins,3801o2,imissedthetoilet,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:11:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. Appreciate hearing the insight. Maybe the clashing is just the national media's perception
minnesotatwins,3801o2,DoubleOhFour,3,Mon Jun 1 13:14:05 2015 UTC,"I loved Gardy. When we let him go, I thought he got a raw deal - and he did have a real shitty team the last few years. Bill Smith was awful. But players like Dozier and Plouffe grew under Gardy during those years. So I would still give Gardy's staff some credit for the current success.  Gardy had a lot of success here, the players all seemed to love playing for him which created a great culture - I loved that the Twins only had two managers going back to whenever Tom Kelly started in the 80's. Gardy would go to bat for his players. How many games did he get thrown out of before replay? It was awesome.  It's hard to argue that letting Gardy go wasn't the right move considering what the Twins are doing now. Was Gardy TOO much of a player's coach? I don't know. I truly think it was just a stagnant culture and a change was necessary. And maybe nobody is to blame. I think Gardy can have success wherever he goes.  To me, the biggest turnaround has been the Twins' pitching. Most notably, Pelfrey and Gibson - but May and even Nolasco have pitched better this year than last year. Some of that might be simple maturity. Maybe these guys are just healthier. But it's hard not to love what Neil Allen has done so far. He deserves every bit as much credit as Molitor."
minnesotatwins,3801o2,tenthreeleader,2,Mon Jun 1 02:07:10 2015 UTC,"I felt more of the blame on the past few seasons was pitching, and that was tied to Rick."
minnesotatwins,3801o2,fishouflager,3,Mon Jun 1 12:47:34 2015 UTC,"I was never really a big Gardy fan.  When he inherited a good team from Tom Kelly, he didn't do anything notable with it. He was 6-21 in the playoffs and lost his last eight playoff games at the Metrodome, IIRC.  Yes, he was hampered by Bill Smith, but the list of his wrecked young players is at least as long as the list of good ones he developed.  And if you were young, there was always plenty of room for you under Gardenhire's bus.  Sure, veteran players loved playing for him.  In the Twins' organization, it took four straight last-place finishes to get some semblance of accountability.  Who wouldn't love playing for a guy who stood in the gap like Gardenhire did?  That said, what's done is done.  It was clearly time for change here on more than one front.  Neil Allen has been a revelation as well.  But if Gardenhire winds up in Chicago, good luck to him.    Molitor's approach seems to be working and even if it doesn't work out this year, the Twins are watchable again and that's wonderful."
minnesotatwins,3801o2,tenthreeleader,2,Mon Jun 1 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"I always thought the Twins collectively played like a replacement level second basemen who was constantly worried about being demoted when they reached the playoffs under Gardy, except they were just waiting to get beat. It's entirely subjective and based on nothing, but I think Molitor has a much more confident attitude and it's translating. Chemistry counts for a lot, and after a point I think Gardy was unable to generate any."
minnesotatwins,380alg,Hopper13,3,Sun May 31 22:13:28 2015 UTC,So the last time we had 10 more wins than losses? In 2010 we finished 94-68.
minnesotatwins,380alg,RichardManuel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:50:01 2015 UTC,"The last time it happened was on 5/30/15. All jokes aside, technically the last time the team was double digit wins over .500 was the last day of the 2010 regular season, 10/3/10, with a record of 94-68. Earlier that year they reached 10 wins above .500 for the first time on 5/9 and hovered around that mark until 7/28. After that, they stayed 10+ over .500 for the rest of the season."

minnesotatwins,37xj4e,imissedthetoilet,3,Sun May 31 21:12:02 2015 UTC,I did a bit more digging and I don't think they've been ALONE atop the standings since they won the division in 2010.  I'd love if someone could confirm this!

minnesotatwins,37vx05,FlannelBeard,6,Sat May 30 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"So I dont pay much attention to the wild, especially when they play  the first half of the season so poorly. Are you setting the wins goal at 75? Or is that the fraction of the % completed we have accomplished thus far?"
minnesotatwins,37vx05,FlannelBeard,8,Sat May 30 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"That's the number completed since I've started tracking. We're 12-6 (or 12-5-1 lol), so we've won 12 of 18 games so far. We need 63 more wins to reach the goal that I think should put us safely in a playoff spot with 92 total wins.   I didn't start tracking until the season was already in play, so it's a bit confusing."
minnesotatwins,37vx05,SplurgingSpurgeon,2,Sat May 30 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"You should edit the numbers to reflect the entire year, with the games played before you were tracking."

I'm not sure if that will be enough to win the division, but the past few years 88 has been the average amount needed to snag a wild card."

minnesotatwins,37w4ok,lilweber,10,Sat May 30 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty much anything on the third base side will have great views of the city.  In fact, many of those sections will have ""Skyline"" in the name.  The only caution to that side of the stadium is that if you sit too far down the line, the Budweiser roof deck obscures the main scoreboard in left field (of course, there is a secondary scoreboard in right for this exact reason).  Both bullpens are in left-center next to section 131.  There aren't too many bad seats, but I enjoy section S, Skyline Deck, because you can still see the scoreboard, you get the great skyline view, and the seats have a nice view of the action without being too expensive.  However, I've sat in several places and never thought I had a bad seat!  Also, check out these 3D views from the Twins website and you can click on different sections to preview the view from that section!"

minnesotatwins,37v377,RichardManuel,2,Sat May 30 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"Huh. Interesting. Sounds like the kind of rule that an umpire would probably just ignore 99.99% of the time.  Either way, I guess, my point was that Gardy, like Francona, always had that pullover on, even when it was 95 degrees out. Just a little thing that bugged me."
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,3,Sat May 30 20:22:38 2015 UTC,Why does his hand look so tiny?
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat May 30 20:17:29 2015 UTC,Escobar should be bunting here.
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,0,Sat May 30 20:08:17 2015 UTC,No.  I'm hoping bunting left with Gardy.  It just doesn't have much of a place in today's game.
minnesotatwins,37v377,smakola,2,Sat May 30 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"Sac bunts have a place when a hitter is struggling and you only need one run. Your run expectancy goes down, but your odds of scoring one run go up."
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,3,Sat May 30 23:58:07 2015 UTC,"Sacrifice bunting is declining, but bunting for a hit should still be used when appropriate. It can be a good strategy at times."
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 30 20:24:48 2015 UTC,Boy that was actually kinda neat.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,1 point,Sat May 30 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"Damn, to that guy that said we are lucky earlier, you're right. These umps are making it that way."
minnesotatwins,37v377,cadderly09,1 point,Sat May 30 20:03:15 2015 UTC,Duensing is going to Carl Willis this game.

minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,1 point,Sat May 30 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"Man, we are getting fucked by the umps today...."
minnesotatwins,37v377,AdaAstra,2,Sat May 30 20:02:31 2015 UTC,Boy he made a fucking cartwheel and somehow didn't swing.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"There's one pitcher I trust less than Duensing right now, and that's Tim Stauffer.   Edit: Gladly eating these words, but I still feel the same."
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,2,Sat May 30 20:01:23 2015 UTC,Juan Rincon?
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,2,Sat May 30 20:02:45 2015 UTC,All these bad call against the Twins are starting to get annoying. Hope the Twins can fight through all these bad calls and continue to win.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Mariox,1 point,Sat May 30 20:00:25 2015 UTC,Those are the best victories. Just hope the bullpen keeps them at 2 and we can smack them around for a few more.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 20:03:20 2015 UTC,Gibson gets out of this he needs to go buy a lottery ticket.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Hov34,7,Sat May 30 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"Stopping by from the NL to say:  You need to win the division this year. Maybe Twins/Royals or Twins/Tigers is as brutal of a hatred that just isn't televised as much, but if you win the division, I find it highly likely that two more would be coming from the AL Central.  ROYALS v. TIGERS . 1 game wildcard.  Would there be anything more beautiful?    In all seriousness though, you guys have been a hell of a lot of fun to watch this year, keep on rollin!"
minnesotatwins,37v377,NASM8bit,3,Sat May 30 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you Natsman! I've always pulled for you guys, hoping you can finally prove everyone right and crush the NLE! Also, sorry to hear about Strats."
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"forgot to flair up, nats here."
minnesotatwins,37v377,NASM8bit,3,Sat May 30 19:59:07 2015 UTC,Gibson the magician
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,4,Sat May 30 19:58:19 2015 UTC,Tell that motherfucker he's not getting his 150k back.
minnesotatwins,37v377,cadderly09,1 point,Sat May 30 19:57:52 2015 UTC,Yeah what's that even mean? His salary per game?
minnesotatwins,37v377,RichardManuel,1 point,Sat May 30 20:06:34 2015 UTC,Is he yelling at Joe Mauer?
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,2,Sat May 30 19:58:47 2015 UTC,Yeah.
minnesotatwins,37v377,cadderly09,2,Sat May 30 20:01:11 2015 UTC,What is the team's record in games where Torii doesn't start?
minnesotatwins,37v377,onceamennonite,2,Sat May 30 19:57:32 2015 UTC,2-3
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat May 30 20:01:57 2015 UTC,I was expecting it to be worse. Thanks.
minnesotatwins,37v377,onceamennonite,8,Sat May 30 20:03:19 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, that guy yelling in the stands."
minnesotatwins,37v377,Tannekr,4,Sat May 30 19:56:29 2015 UTC,Fuck that guy he's a dolt.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,5,Sat May 30 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"Dozier needs to pick that. I know he isn't a first basemen, but that was a catchable ball."
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,3,Sat May 30 19:55:54 2015 UTC,This is not a good note to go to work on; maybe my absence will produce Twins runs?  (I sure hope so!)
minnesotatwins,37v377,BrianDoziersHair,2,Sat May 30 19:55:21 2015 UTC,Great. Swell. And Fantastic.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,2,Sat May 30 19:54:48 2015 UTC,Well looks like this is the end for Gibson. We have no luck right now.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,4,Sat May 30 19:54:00 2015 UTC,Get Gibson out of there.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Hov34,5,Sat May 30 19:53:07 2015 UTC,That was three consecutive horrific calls by the home plate ump.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Opie59,3,Sat May 30 19:52:50 2015 UTC,Thats some fucking bull shit.
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,3,Sat May 30 19:52:33 2015 UTC,Horrible fucking call. One of the worst I have seen this year.
minnesotatwins,37v377,SportsMind,2,Sat May 30 19:52:04 2015 UTC,Umpires need to be replaced with robots.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Hov34,2,Sat May 30 19:51:58 2015 UTC,I feel like nothing is going right in this game yet we're somehow ahead.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:51:56 2015 UTC,Oh come on. The one good steal attempt and there's batter interference.
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,3,Sat May 30 19:51:06 2015 UTC,garb sauce
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,2,Sat May 30 19:50:33 2015 UTC,What the fuck. What the fuuuuuck. Why why WHY.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:50:14 2015 UTC,Golly! This ump is calling everything a strike - according to the Toronto broadcast the last 3 pitches were all balls.  And now this interference call?   WTH?
minnesotatwins,37v377,CentralAmerican,3,Sat May 30 19:50:10 2015 UTC,I'm surprised Dozier didn't try for that.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Tannekr,4,Sat May 30 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"Both pitches Dozier looked at were above the K-zone, both called strikes.  Edit: now gets Nunez with a low strike."
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat May 30 19:49:30 2015 UTC,Just noticed the same.  Bad ump'in.
minnesotatwins,37v377,CentralAmerican,3,Sat May 30 19:51:17 2015 UTC,This strikezone is getting ugly
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,1 point,Sat May 30 19:49:29 2015 UTC,Ugh that fastball has some nasty movement :( Looked to go wide for sure.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,2,Sat May 30 19:49:10 2015 UTC,That was a nice pitch.
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,0,Sat May 30 19:48:21 2015 UTC,Welp another useless Santana at-bat sadly.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,1 point,Sat May 30 19:47:09 2015 UTC,Santana should bunt every at bat.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Hov34,3,Sat May 30 19:47:07 2015 UTC,Mostly fastball pitcher in a fastball count can only mean good things for Hicks.
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat May 30 19:46:58 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why, but I really like Hicks' bat pump when he bats left-handed."
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 30 19:46:53 2015 UTC,I said the same thing! looks like he's just about to unload some hurt.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:48:22 2015 UTC,I'm really liking Hick's slowly improving plate discipline.
minnesotatwins,37v377,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat May 30 19:46:50 2015 UTC,Hicks has always been patient. Too patient most of the time. This year he seems to be figuring out when are good counts to look for his pitch and drive it somewhere.
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,2,Sat May 30 19:48:22 2015 UTC,Yup. feelsgoodman.jpg
minnesotatwins,37v377,BrianDoziersHair,1 point,Sat May 30 19:50:24 2015 UTC,Boy Hicks as a huge bat-hitch before he swings. I love those.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,2,Sat May 30 19:46:12 2015 UTC,He added that at AAA this year as a timing device. Results are inconclusive.
minnesotatwins,37v377,7Finger,2,Sat May 30 19:47:04 2015 UTC,If we don't get any more runs do you bring Gibson out for the 6th?
minnesotatwins,37v377,Hov34,2,Sat May 30 19:43:10 2015 UTC,Give him the 6th!
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,2,Sat May 30 19:42:32 2015 UTC,Race update: the Loon didn't win.
minnesotatwins,37v377,novafire08,2,Sat May 30 19:37:48 2015 UTC,Did the fish win? She hadn't won this year as of last Saturday.
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,2,Sat May 30 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, Wanda the Walleye won."
minnesotatwins,37v377,novafire08,2,Sat May 30 19:44:43 2015 UTC,Wanda's got 1 win from seeing last night's totals.
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat May 30 19:43:19 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, Herrmann, what were you waiting for?"
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 30 19:36:50 2015 UTC,Sooooo...why aren't we swinging at easy strikes guys?
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,1 point,Sat May 30 19:36:24 2015 UTC,"whelp it looks like 2 is going to be our total for the day, come on bullpen!"
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,2,Sat May 30 19:36:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know what's in a Jurassic Smash Blizzard, but I want one."
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat May 30 19:36:02 2015 UTC,Crushed peanut butter cookies and chocolate chip cookie dough. he asks in he dang commercial!
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,2,Sat May 30 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"MLB.tv, no commercials. I just kept looking at the banner behind home plate."
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Sat May 30 19:38:05 2015 UTC,Oh. Well my bad! Get you a blizzard.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,1 point,Sat May 30 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"Juice em' up, Herrmann!"
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"This is the most confusing game of pitching I've ever been unable to watch.  Edit: Can someone explain why it's taking so long, too? Every out seems to take 5 minutes."
minnesotatwins,37v377,innesota2,3,Sat May 30 19:32:47 2015 UTC,Hopefully we got inside Sanchez's head now
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,3,Sat May 30 19:30:31 2015 UTC,Shoutout to the kid trying to get the chant going
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,2,Sat May 30 19:30:26 2015 UTC,Huh I thought that was some drunk chick.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,2,Sat May 30 19:32:14 2015 UTC,ya the more i hear it the more i agree
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,2,Sat May 30 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"Now it's just annoying, haha."
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"Why the heck are we trying to steal? 58% as a team so far this year, Martin has averaged over 40% caught stealing over the past three years, league average is about 70% success (so 30% CS%.) As I was looking this all up we should have gotten two runs instead of just one."
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,2,Sat May 30 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"Sanchez is slow to the plate, and it could have been a hit and run, but the pitch was so far outside, it wasnt worth trying to swing."
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,2,Sat May 30 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how slow to the plate he really is though, four of the eight players this season who tried to steal on him before today have been thrown out."
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,1 point,Sat May 30 19:39:37 2015 UTC,"He does have Martin catching for him, which helps. I think hes slow enough, and from what Ive seen, he doesnt watch the runner on first very closely. A good jump could probably do it. Plus, 7 wild pitches already this year."
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,4,Sat May 30 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"Mauer is a smart enough player to know if a hit and run is on, it doesn't matter if the pitch is thrown 10 feet above your head, you swing the bat.  Okay, maybe that's a bit extreme, but you still swing at a pitch-out if a hit-and-run is called.  Also, Mauer rarely likes to swing at the first pitch, so I would be somewhat surprised if they called a hit-and-run there."
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 30 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"Yea it most likely wasnt, just trying to surprise Martin and Sanchez by going on the first pitch. Sanchez hasnt been dialing them near the strike zone for the first pitch, so maybe they were hoping that Martin would miss when he saw Hicks go."
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,3,Sat May 30 19:36:30 2015 UTC,TREVOR PLOUFFE
minnesotatwins,37v377,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sat May 30 19:28:58 2015 UTC,PLOUFFE DOUBLE!
minnesotatwins,37v377,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat May 30 19:28:27 2015 UTC,Keep it going.
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat May 30 19:28:26 2015 UTC,We should just stop trying to steal bases.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Tannekr,3,Sat May 30 19:28:24 2015 UTC,"Stealing bases is part of the game.  Getting thrown out is also part of the game.  Personally, I think we should have challenged that.  He looked safe."
minnesotatwins,37v377,AdaAstra,3,Sat May 30 19:30:56 2015 UTC,No. Stealing bases has helped us so much this season. We have a ton of speed on the roster. We arent this bad at it usually
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,1 point,Sat May 30 19:29:48 2015 UTC,"We have a 58% success rate, well under the league average of around 70%, and stealing is only beneficial if you are successful over 71% of the time."
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,3,Sun May 31 00:01:59 2015 UTC,Speed means shit if you can't get a good read or jump.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Tannekr,3,Sat May 30 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. And the Twins need to be getting better jumps. Hicks should have gotten to second last inning on the wild pitch. Stealing bases can be incredibly beneficial to help win a ball game. Sabermetrics says it isnt worth the risk, but it also screws up the statistical predictability of games."
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,1 point,Sat May 30 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"Saber actually says it's worth the risk if you're successful more than 71% of the time, or even lower in some situations."
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,3,Sun May 31 00:03:09 2015 UTC,I don't even mind being aggressive on the bases. Just... Nunez against Russell Martin? On the first pitch? Come on.
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,2,Sat May 30 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"maybe his thinking was, ""No way I let Mauer GIDP on my watch!"""
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:30:00 2015 UTC,I love you Plouffe

minnesotatwins,37v377,inevitablescape,3,Sat May 30 19:28:14 2015 UTC,So.... uh.... why exactly are you here?
minnesotatwins,37v377,FlannelBeard,5,Sat May 30 19:30:06 2015 UTC,I'm bored
minnesotatwins,37v377,inevitablescape,2,Sat May 30 19:32:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for joining us today!
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,1 point,Sun May 31 00:03:55 2015 UTC,no problem!
minnesotatwins,37v377,inevitablescape,3,Sun May 31 00:07:11 2015 UTC,"Alright we knocked him to the ground, kick him in the ribs guys! I got the eyes!"
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,2,Sat May 30 19:28:09 2015 UTC,RUNS!! YAY PLOUFFE!
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"See, you just have to be patient, god damn. :("
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:26:33 2015 UTC,that would have been a run :(
minnesotatwins,37v377,inevitablescape,5,Sat May 30 19:26:28 2015 UTC,News flash: Russell Martin is a very good defensive catcher.
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,3,Sat May 30 19:26:17 2015 UTC,So much for the leadoff walk.
minnesotatwins,37v377,ChiefakaJames,2,Sat May 30 19:25:46 2015 UTC,STOP FUCKING RUNNING
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,1 point,Sat May 30 19:25:29 2015 UTC,I'd only trust Butxon to beat that.  Edit 12 hours later: HOW THE FUCK DO I MISSPELL BUXTON'S LAST NAME AFTER HEARING ABOUT HIM FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS?!
minnesotatwins,37v377,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat May 30 19:26:20 2015 UTC,Martin is a killer
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,3,Sat May 30 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"Two home runs from two guys with a combined .407 batting average. Okay then.  Edit: Yes, I meant the sum of their batting averages."
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,5,Sat May 30 19:21:12 2015 UTC,They would be .204 or so combined. But yes.
minnesotatwins,37v377,y2jayjk,3,Sat May 30 19:23:17 2015 UTC,Ah you know what i mean.
minnesotatwins,37v377,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 30 19:24:48 2015 UTC,Boy that was a bad end. Huge hits to the 8-9-1. I don't know if I'd stick him out for one more...
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,3,Sat May 30 19:20:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't
minnesotatwins,37v377,inevitablescape,4,Sat May 30 19:21:28 2015 UTC,Ok if Gibson can give us 5 with no more runs that's the best I can ask for
minnesotatwins,37v377,ewok_bukkake,3,Sat May 30 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"God, that was way too close to being a home run."
minnesotatwins,37v377,Tannekr,3,Sat May 30 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"Give the Jays 4 hits, 4 walks, and an error with the heart of the order up: no runs scored.  Number 8 hitter up after two Ks: one run scored.  Baseball is weird."
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,2,Sat May 30 19:19:55 2015 UTC,"Gibson, plz."
minnesotatwins,37v377,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat May 30 19:19:43 2015 UTC,=( Just when Gibson was looking good.
minnesotatwins,37v377,cardith_lorda,3,Sat May 30 19:18:26 2015 UTC,:(
minnesotatwins,37v377,inevitablescape,2,Sat May 30 19:18:15 2015 UTC,Welp. So much for a good inning.
minnesotatwins,37v377,Derk-Derks,4,Sat May 30 19:17:45 2015 UTC,Baseball is a weird game.  It probably is his best inning so far.
minnesotatwins,37v377,onceamennonite,2,Sat May 30 19:18:35 2015 UTC,Also they need to sent Santana down...rough.

minnesotatwins,37s51t,dannygopher,5,Sat May 30 02:47:09 2015 UTC,They absolutely flock to Target Field when the Jays are in town. I was at a Jays-Twins game last year and it seemed like 3/4 of the fans at the stadium were Jays fans.
minnesotatwins,37s51t,tennisspears,2,Sat May 30 02:31:21 2015 UTC,Also visiting fans are probably more willing to wait through the delay.
minnesotatwins,37s51t,sunderstormer,3,Sat May 30 02:32:53 2015 UTC,Oh I get it. Flock cuz they are birds. Clever.
minnesotatwins,37s51t,ajnack,3,Sat May 30 02:59:00 2015 UTC,I swear i didn't try to do that. Realized it after I submitted.

minnesotatwins,37s51t,guiltycitizen,7,Sat May 30 02:46:12 2015 UTC,I think a lot of them drive down from just north of Minnesota (so Manitoba and Ontario?). Jays fans are spread all across Canada.

minnesotatwins,37s51t,guiltycitizen,2,Sat May 30 02:03:31 2015 UTC,He might throw two balls at once if he speeds up.
minnesotatwins,37s51t,CantaloupeCamper,2,Sat May 30 02:01:17 2015 UTC,Well that was quick. I hope we can turn our offense around the rest of the game or our defense will have to step up and hold the line. Im not afraid that our defense wont hold but if we could have more than a one inning flash in the pan that would be nice and make it easier to win.
minnesotatwins,37s51t,Huskypuck,3,Sat May 30 02:03:09 2015 UTC,Good inning by May. This lineup scares me so much :(

minnesotatwins,37rif1,AnalAttackProbe,10,Fri May 29 21:27:12 2015 UTC,Altuve kind of

minnesotatwins,37rif1,AnalAttackProbe,2,Fri May 29 21:32:39 2015 UTC,I agree. Honestly I only know Altuve and I think they have a guy named Chris Carter but I'm not sure haha
minnesotatwins,37rif1,Janderson2494,2,Fri May 29 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"They've got some budding superstars. Altuve is one, Dallas Keuchel is very good, Chris Carter, and I think George Springer"
minnesotatwins,37rif1,stwentz,17,Sat May 30 00:05:11 2015 UTC,"Here's an actual answer from an actual article on Grantland.   The Twins, Cubs, and Astros are the teams most analysts predicted would break out of years of rottenness in the seasons to come thanks to outstanding farm systems. All three are winning ahead of schedule, but while the Cubs are already enjoying Kris Bryant, Addison Russell, and Jorge Soler, and the Astros have shrewdly set the table for their prospects by adding major-league-ready complementary pieces, that’s not the case in Minnesota.   The article continues to explain that the Twins aren't explainable statistically so it's not as easy to trust that their success will continue. Meanwhile the Astros have an explainable answer to their success."
minnesotatwins,37rif1,coreyf,3,Fri May 29 21:29:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Twins have been very opportunistic thus far and that's not a quality that is easily sustainable. Of we were top 3 in, say, defense, then I believe national media would be more positive about our chances."
minnesotatwins,37rif1,FlyingScissor,17,Sat May 30 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"Astros advance stats are better and their success is more believable. Twins advance numbers aren't good and the team as a whole look like their due to regression.  Houston has the leagues best power, a good bullpen, and the best fielding defense in the majors. Much more sustainable."
minnesotatwins,37rif1,ISISFieldAgent,16,Fri May 29 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"Who cares. Its the same thing with every one of our sports teams. Why are we so obsessed with ""power rankings"" and what anyone else thinks? Why do we need affirmation we are good so desperately? We don't need attention we just need to keep winning. Forget the media.   As far as why Houston is getting attention and we aren't it's purely market size. Believe it or not Houston is the 4th largest metro area in the nation. It's good for the media and for TV when they have a winning team."

minnesotatwins,37rif1,guiltycitizen,6,Sun May 31 00:40:04 2015 UTC,"Personally, I give zero fucks about the lack of media attention. This sub provides all the attention for the team that I could ask for because Twins fans (actual fans) provide more meaningful information than the media.   Every article about the team's current success is ""How long will this last?"" this, and ""The Twins are such a fluke right now, amirite?"" that.   Fuck attention. The team is doing better with Molly at the helm and that's all we in Twins territory wanted. The fact that they are exceeding expectations is an added bonus and we are thankful. I feel that this season has already paid off for the hopeful diehard, even after that first week where people were all, ""Welp, here we go again, their first week was a bag of suck so the rest of the season will probably be the same"".   So to hell with doubt, to hell with us being called a fluke. And fuck any media coverage only giving us attention because our success is ""surprising"". Frankly I don't find it to be surprising, we have talented ball players.  We comin'."
minnesotatwins,37rif1,guiltycitizen,4,Fri May 29 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"Because for most people that aren't Twins fans, the Twins are pure luck at worst or can't keep this up at best. I don't necessarily blame them, but hey, it is what it is. I love that we aren't getting attention though, stay out of the spotlight and don't jinx it. I want the players to stay hungry and keep playing as hard as they can every day. Treat every game like it's September in May and good things can happen."

Young stars like Springer, Altuve, and Keuchel are magnets for coverage - and the Astros certainly deserve the hype.  The Twins terrible start put them off the media's radar very early.  Beating up on Cleveland and Chicago up in the grey early Spring in the Midwest isn't sexy.  Plus, I think the Twins' record against Detroit is a huge asterisk right now - it's easy to say ""they're not that good"" and point to those Tigers games.  It's not the kind of ""easy journalism"" that ESPN or other sports networks prefer to air."

But I think Hunter is probably at the top of the list considering his competition.  But it's not like Hunter has a real small sample size. He probably played 5-6 games a year at Target Field for three years as and Angel and then double that for 2 years as a Tiger. That's probably about 40ish games, and spreading it out probably gives him more time to adapt to the overhang than doing it all at once."
minnesotatwins,37ssgu,Aluminum_Love_Cradle,1 point,Sat May 30 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"Usually MLB teams play opponents from outside their division for one home and one away series a year, so he'd only get 3 games a year at Target Field as an Angel.

Torri was as much I think a team player, leader, Oh gawd someone play in the outfield, player that appeals to the masses, kinda pickup.  Also Hunter doesn't have the injury history Cuddy has, something particularly important as he ages."

It's the first Twins hat I got after I moved out away from ""Twins Territory"" and I just sort of happened across it.  I was in the Indianapolis airport of all places at a Lids store, not really shopping, just browsing to see the cap designs.  Then I see a familiar TC logo in the clearance section (It's hard to tell in the linked photo, but the logo is slightly off center from the bill.  I think it gives the hat some character, a certain quirkiness that is oddly appropriate for the Twins.)  This was in mid-March of last year so baseball season was right around the corner and this hat reminded me that Twins Territory is not a location.  To sight the Book of Plouffe, Chapter 2, verse 4: ""Where two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be in the midst of them.""  (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)  I know it's just a hat, but it connects me to my home and the team that I grew up watching and still love to follow."

Teams rarely improve from a 70-92 season to get to the 90+ wins needed to make the playoffs and make a long postseason run, so those teams get higher odds.    The somewhat more complicated explanation is that odds are constantly re-calculated to balance out bets with eventual payouts.  If lots of people bet on a team to win, casinos will adjust odds downward, to get as close as possible to the balance point where half the money is on a team to win that bet, and half the money would go the other way."

No mention of the clustered hitting. Where 7/9 guys get on base in one early inning, demolishing the starter, and setting up a morale-killing lead that's daunting for the other team to overtake.  Molitor is the 10th highest for all-time hits. Why is it any surprise that he's getting ALL his guys to hit? You can be Shane Robinson and hit a bazillion singles all day and you are still contribuiting to the team, because Santana behind you is going to hit a ""single"" that's enough for 2 speedy guys to turn into a double, followed by a Dozier/Hunter/Plouffe homer, and so on.

SportsCenter has done what every other source for news has done, and that's show the stories they will garner the highest ratings. And you know what? They probably do. But that's not the point. The point is to report the news in sports, which to me goes beyond Deflategate, Fifa, Bryce Harper, and Lebron James.   Yes, I understand that NBA finals are happening right now, and they deserve a bit more extensive coverage. However, reverting back to highlights and discussion about the latest finals game after every other show topic is too much. (And on the topic of basketball coverage, please get someone other than Steven A. Smith. Honestly, every time they have him on it feels like he is yelling at the audience, similar to Guy Fieri on the Food Network, though with much less bleached hair.)  The ""Best of MLB"" segment is a joke. Two days ago they highlighted Josh Hamilton's return as a Texas Ranger. He went 0-3 while at the plate. Best of MLB? Please. During that same broadcast, viewers were treated to a segment ""100 days until college football"". Uh...who cares? They aren't playing yet. We're in the midst of NBA, MLB, Golf, and NCAA baseball and softball. Not to mention all of the car races. Surely they can fill their hour long broadcast spot with some of those topics, as opposed to talking about a sport that starts three months in the future.   As much as it displeases me, I will keep watching; hoping they show some Twins highlights. Though I will surely not hold my breath.

Their job isn't to give everybody equal time, or even time weighted by standings. Their job is to make money. They make money by getting viewers. And there are more people who are fans of teams in New York and Boston than there are Twins fans.   In a perfect world, I think the Twins are an amazing story right now. But in a world with a bottom line, ESPN has to play to get eyeballs."

The Astros just completely fell apart after they lost their only World Series, so yeah, it's definitely a different kind of story.  Plus, they're ahead of us in pretty much every statistic that counts.  In most categories they are dominant.  The Twins winning now is like Farah Fawcett dying on the same day as Michael Jackson."

Was this written by the same chucklefuck who said the Twins were gonna start losing like they were in the opening weeks in that article a few weeks ago?"
minnesotatwins,37mmoz,MN_Logan,3,Fri May 29 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"Here is my article on the season so far:  The Twins have been a true surprise, in the most positive sense.  Before the season, very few outside of the M logo hat wearers and Kent Hrbek jersey owners expected an improvement over last season.  There was skepticism about whether the Paul Molitor hire was the right decision, after popular, but not without faults, manager Ron Gardenhire and the team parted ways in the offseason.  There was concern that bringing Torii Hunter back was a half-hearted attempt to sell a few more seats during a farewell tour. Others called it, and the Santana signing, a stopgap until the future prospects Sano and Buxton were set to arrive, potentially buying the team a few more days before the stadium looked as empty as it did during the darkest days of the Metrodome.    Offseason rock bottom was reached when Ervin Santana was suspended for 50 games.  Then something completely reasonable happened.  Few thought Hughes was as good as he pitched last year, but no way were Nolasco and Pelfrey as bad as they were last year either.  Using the same statistics that are being used to discredit the 2015 Twins, the 2014 Twins were better than their final record of 70-92 would have you believe, and injuries poked holes in an already vulnerable roster.  In 2015, all three pitchers are returning to their proven forms, and that shouldn't surprise anyone, number crunching or not.  Right now there are a lot of happy people in Minnesota.  Those who thought bringing Torii Hunter back was good for the fans.  Those who thought hiring a Minnesota-native Paul Molitor to be the next manager for life was a great feel good story.  The only people that aren't, are those who can't find the single stat that explains what is happening at Target Field.  I'll offer to help those hard at work to find it, but I am afraid it doesn't make for a long article.  It isn't heralded by sabermetricians.  It is, however, loved by those who have kept score, whether unofficially or officially for the entirety of baseball's history. It's wins.  Sometimes there are blowouts, sometimes there are closely contested games, but what the Twins are doing right now is scoring runs early, pitching adequately and turning the game over to a rock solid, rested bullpen.  If Glen Perkins doesn't blow a save all season, no other statistic will matter.  At his current pace, Perkins will finish the season with 63 saves, one better than the all time record.  In 2008, when Frankie Rodriguez set the record, the Angels finished the season with 100 wins.  The Twins are on pace to win 99.  I am not waiting for ESPN to play the over/under game, or have the talking heads debate about which is more likely.  I am not holding my breath for a Wednesday evening interview on the dinnertime sportscenter with any player on this roster.  I am going to the park, to watch this team play.  And you should as well."

minnesotatwins,37mmoz,DeckardGates,9,Fri May 29 20:04:29 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the article is mostly right. The Twins' success so far has been based on ""clutch"" hitting, which most studies have shown doesn't exist. They are hitting great with men in scoring position, but I don't think that will last. Yes, they are better than last year, and their prospects for the future are great, but they aren't as good as their record indicates. They will slide at some point."
minnesotatwins,37mmoz,7Finger,3,Thu May 28 21:21:29 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you. I don't expect the Twins to take the AL Central, or even the wildcard.   But, I do believe that if they slump, the slump will be short and it won't be terrible. I read an article from the PioPress the other day quoting Dozier. He said the atmosphere in the locker room has changed dramatically. Last year, a loss would make everyone dead silent, but this year a loss is just another day and tomorrow is another chance to win. That has to count for something."
minnesotatwins,37mmoz,bachrock37,3,Thu May 28 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, the atmosphere makes a huge difference. The last few years we didn't have enough guys who hated losing. It's one thing, after a loss, to say, ""We'll get them tomorrow."" The last few years it seemed like they took the field with that attitude. Molitor has made a difference in that, and I think Hunter has also made a difference. Also, once you start winning, you realize how much losing sucks. They could surprise everyone and hold on, but I doubt it. They are creating the nucleus of a long term winning team, and that's nice to see."
minnesotatwins,37mmoz,7Finger,1 point,Thu May 28 23:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think this comment is absolutely correct. I don't think (or I hope at least) people are now penciling the Twins in for a trip to the World Series. But I think what this does is two fold - as the comment below states, it is instilling a new culture of winning that can be built on and it also has significantly lowered the floor of what this team can accomplish this year."
minnesotatwins,37mmoz,starlitmint,2,Fri May 29 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"What the hell is this shit? I tried reading it earlier but my rage was too expansive to truly explain how I felt about this article. So now I'll just go through it all.   Only now the Twins are a part of that conversation, all, “Hey, guys, what’re y’all talking about?” like that douche bag Donnie from high school. In fact, they’re more than just a part of the conversation: After yesterday’s 6-4 win over the Red Sox, they’re 28-18 and tied with the Royals for first place in the division.   Well good to know you think we're equivalent to a douchebag. Thanks for that.   The Twins have brought up pitcher Trevor May, who’s been below average, and outfielder Aaron Hicks, who’s been terrible. But top prospects Miguel Sano, Byron Buxton, J.O. Berrios, and Alex Meyer remain in the minor leagues. The major addition to last year’s 92-loss team was the wilting, desiccated husk of Torii Hunter, a nostalgia trip who seems ill aware that his days as a superstar are a thing of the past.   Jesus fucking Christ this is rude. May has been better than below average (IMO), Hicks has struggled a little but has honestly put together a worthwhile case for winning a Gold Glove in approximately three or four games, and that desiccated husk is currently leading us in RBI and BA. So fuck you too asshole.   And while new manager Paul Molitor is calling for bunts far less frequently than his predecessor, Ron Gardenhire, that’s a marginal thing at this point in the season.   So wait, bunting doesn't actually help you win games? /s   Some of that is to be expected: Closer Glen Perkins has been among the best in baseball, and Molitor has used him about as wisely as a manager can use his best reliever.    Taking a quick break from completely being a douchebag he actually manages to provide some actual insight into the Twins and their success. Too bad it's such a fleeting glimpse.   But Perkins’s incredible start is thus far the only real tangible outlier in Minnesota, apart from some performances — lookin’ at you, Mike Pelfrey — that stink of prima facie flukiness.   Just couldn't go more than a paragraph without taking a dump on someone, could you? I mean, it's not like Pelfrey is a complete trash heap of a pitcher, for crissakes, he's pitching kinda how I predicted he would before the season started.   This 28-18 start isn’t for real. But something doesn’t have to be real to make you feel good. There’s something to be said for just tagging along.   Yeah, well you can go to hell you bastard. We don't want any of your kind along for the ride."

minnesotatwins,37mmoz,Mariox,1 point,Fri May 29 03:46:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember we're still way early in the season. Currently, you could compare this season to the vikings starting 3-1, with their loss coming against the Packers. Sure, it's a great start, but it's very early. When we try to predict the next 3/4 of the season, looking at some advanced stats might make our predictions more accurate over the full season, and the numbers just don't back up the Twins keeping this up.  All that said, I'm pumped for the great start and love that Molitor can so quickly create a winning atmosphere. If this is for real and the stats are the fluke, then this is going to be one of the most fun Twins seasons I've seen."

Portion of the season aside, a 3-1 Vikings team has still only played 4 games. The Twins have 46 under their belt, so at least in games played they've sustained more than your take suggests.

We're 8th in runs, 10th in AVG, 20th in OBP, and 17th in SLG.  Our pitching is 16th in ERA, 23rd in QS, 20th in WHIP, and 29th in BAA.  But what the Twins do better than anyone else is cluster hits, and our pitching doesn't immediately surrender runs after we score.  We're also hitting .299 with RISP, and .351 with the bases loaded, and win almost every close game we're in thanks to Glen Perkins.  All season it seems like when we need that one hit, we get that one hit.  When a pitcher needs that GIDP grounder, he gets that GIDP grounder.  A lot of people will call it luck, but when they've been consistent in doing it for almost 50 games, it's not just luck."
minnesotatwins,37lquh,novafire08,8,Thu May 28 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"I think it is best described as ""belief"" as in...when they need that ""one hit"" they believe they can get it when they step to the plate.

But the reason I like the Twins is that they built their Mauer-Morneau-Hunter excellent teams through the farm, through smart and efficient moves.  To me, the Minnesota Twins used to be the model franchise for a small market club, and the Royals have since taken that over. I love seeing the Twins of the world succeed far more than the Yankees and the Dodgers of the world."

minnesotatwins,37hy3t,LloydVonStrangle,9,Wed May 27 19:47:02 2015 UTC,The biggest difference I've seen is winning the 1 and 2 run games. It felt like so many times last year we were finding ways to lose games. But not this year!
minnesotatwins,37hy3t,dachristensen,20,Wed May 27 19:54:37 2015 UTC,"Huge difference in our pitching staff, even though the names are basically the same.  May has gotten over the rookie yips, Gibson is entering his third year and continues to improve, and Pelfrey being forced to pitch in a timely manner instead of taking the time to read a book between pitches has, shockingly, improved his results as well.  Nolasco is still bad though, but fortunately he gets run support."
minnesotatwins,37hy3t,DaDoviende,16,Wed May 27 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"Nolasco is 5-0 with a 3.77 ERA since he returned from injury. That's totally serviceable. He also has a .374 BABIP in that time, so he has had worse than average luck."
minnesotatwins,37hy3t,tennisspears,8,Wed May 27 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"that's good, I just saw the ERA north of 5 and figured he was still awful"
minnesotatwins,37hy3t,DaDoviende,0,Wed May 27 19:58:05 2015 UTC,Judging pitchers by era is almost as bad as judging hitters by RBI.

minnesotatwins,37hy3t,Kruse,3,Wed May 27 19:57:20 2015 UTC,And pretty much the only difference between last year Phil Hughes and this year Phil Hughes is the ungodly number of HR's that this year Phil Hughes has given up.

minnesotatwins,37oe5q,guiltycitizen,-1,Fri May 29 13:09:16 2015 UTC,It's kinda hard to have patience when you're also a Cubs fan. I didn't know that there were also daily threads about this sort of thing.
minnesotatwins,37oe5q,kaiserj1982,1 point,Fri May 29 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"As glad as I am how well this team is doing, and I definitely (definitely) had my doubts leading up to and the beginning of the season, we don't need daily threads by people saying they were wrong. Just my two cents."
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,Kruse,10,Thu May 28 15:05:42 2015 UTC,Sometimes having the same culture carry over year to year just creates complacency.  The culture had become a losing one.  He also is willing to platoon a little and let his starters pitch later in to games if they are rolling. He lets Perkins come in during the 8th.  It's little things like that that are adding up.  Neil Allen should be given credit too.
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,DRAFan,2,Thu May 28 15:09:51 2015 UTC,"Bingo.  One of the first things I read about Molitor when he became manager was that he was going to ban iPads and the like in the clubhouse, because he said that the atmosphere was just dead.  Compound that with Hunter's presence, and guys like Escobar and Arcia getting more comfortable with everyone, and the culture of the team is just incredibly different.  It seems totally cliche to say, but they seem like they're playing the game for each other, where in the past couple seasons everyone just seemed to be there to play the game.  From top to bottom, it seems like everyone is just having a good time."
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,FrankReynolds,3,Thu May 28 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"Seriously, they are getting Mike Pelfrey, Ricky Nolasco, and best of all, Joe Mauer to participate in post-game dance parties with fog machines after home wins. That's awesome."

minnesotatwins,37lnwt,tennisspears,1 point,Fri May 29 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"I think Neil Allen should probably even be given more credit.  Gardy stuck around forever with Rick Anderson as a team, and I get the feeling that they wanted to just fire Anderson, but Gardy wouldn't budge there."
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,Ryan8bit,6,Thu May 28 22:38:50 2015 UTC,He has a magical potion that turned Mike Pelfrey from one of the worst pitchers in the league to one of the best?
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,Zeeker12,6,Thu May 28 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"Manager is the last important ""head coach"" in all of sports.  His biggest impact is the selection of new position coaches who have much greater impacts on performance.    Molitor has the benefit of a better roster, especially since younger players got experience the last few years and now Molitor reaps the benefits."
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,chucktestlacoil,5,Thu May 28 15:21:37 2015 UTC,He has better players who are playing better.
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,7Finger,2,Thu May 28 15:56:21 2015 UTC,"He's platooning more, he's showing more willingness to tinker with the lineup, and he's not as rigid in his usage of the bullpen. Gardy always struck me as a bit of a ""my way or the highway"" type of manager, so it must be refreshing to have a more low key personality like Molitor in the clubhouse. Beyond that, I don't think he has a ton to do with the Twins' current success."
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,Katbot22,2,Thu May 28 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it's something we on the outside may never know. I'm convinced Torii is the biggest addition here. He's bringing over a huge amount of veteran presence, and I think it's great for the young guys to see a hard worker like Hunter who is also the one having a ton of fun and starting these dance parties."
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,wilburisms,2,Thu May 28 19:57:07 2015 UTC,He is making this team far more aggressive and smart on the base paths and helping them play smart defense. Neither of these things can really be proven statistically right now but I've seen more players score from 1st on a single this year than I've seen the rest of my life combined.
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,Heyitscharlie,3,Thu May 28 20:00:21 2015 UTC,I would like to see more about this as well. The base running has seemed incredibly aggressive.
minnesotatwins,37lnwt,wstrauss,2,Thu May 28 23:42:57 2015 UTC,"He's using relief pitchers better than Gardy was. He's more willing to put his best relievers into high-leverage situations rather than have them in set roles. He's exploiting platoon matchups for his hitters better than Gardy was. Gardy had a tendency to let guys struggling to hit try to ""play through it"" rather than put another bat in the lineup. He's doing better with his lineup overall (Gardy used to always have the CF bat first no matter what, the second baseman bat second no matter what, the shortstop bat 9th no matter what, etc.).   He does fall into the same trap that Gardy did with the DH - I'd like to see him do a little better there. He plays whoever needs a rest there, rather than concentrating on fielding the best defensive team on a given day and playing the biggest bat on the bench at DH."

minnesotatwins,37i3ph,headbangershappyhour,4,Wed May 27 20:22:14 2015 UTC,It certainly makes things interesting
minnesotatwins,37i3ph,hail_termite_queen,8,Wed May 27 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"The good thing is that no team in the central has a farm system anywhere close to ours. Theoretically our window is much larger, and as they decline we will be on the up and up."

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,SplurgingSpurgeon,3,Wed May 27 19:51:31 2015 UTC,what does 11-4-1 mean? There's no ties in baseball.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,polamity,7,Wed May 27 20:47:26 2015 UTC,OT Loss
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,SplurgingSpurgeon,5,Wed May 27 20:48:59 2015 UTC,Ahhh. I get it. That's hilarious. Thanks for the clarification.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,polamity,5,Thu May 28 02:33:01 2015 UTC,He's still in hockey mode
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,Contren,7,Wed May 27 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"I'm happy it seems that Hicks is figuring this stuff out and he genuinely wanted to make the changes and that the changes seem to be working for him, I hope we keep him and let him play right field when buxton gets up here, because there will be no doubles in the right center gap with those two"
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,taffyowner,3,Wed May 27 19:44:11 2015 UTC,What about a Hicks-Buxton-Hunter outfield?  That should take away a lot of runs.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,smakola,5,Wed May 27 20:46:33 2015 UTC,BUT GUYS THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE  /s
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ewok_bukkake,3,Wed May 27 19:42:57 2015 UTC,We will hear that all the way into the playoffs if we make it.  I'm fine with that.  Under the radar is always a nice way to go.

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,PopeSleepy,6,Wed May 27 19:39:05 2015 UTC,2-4 respectively.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ObsRefGames,6,Wed May 27 19:39:52 2015 UTC,Yanks up 4-2 in the 8th.  Did I mention it's May?  Yep.  LOL

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,tenthreeleader,5,Wed May 27 19:42:35 2015 UTC,How many pitches did Perkins throw yesterday?
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,cardith_lorda,5,Wed May 27 19:35:48 2015 UTC,21

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,Tannekr,6,Wed May 27 19:30:51 2015 UTC,Royals still down 4-1 in the top of the 8th.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,DetectiveWoofles,5,Wed May 27 19:27:41 2015 UTC,Back from a meeting.  Looks like baseball continues to happen :-)  Carlton has his broom within reach!
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,onceamennonite,6,Wed May 27 19:27:34 2015 UTC,Two on for Ortiz against a righty. Someone hold me.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,tennisspears,3,Wed May 27 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"Naw, he's gotta just keep on struggling."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ChiefakaJames,4,Wed May 27 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"Regardless of his stats this year, I'm scared as hell.  Phew"
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,DetectiveWoofles,5,Wed May 27 19:22:35 2015 UTC,Break in the meeting.  Looks like I'm missing a good game.  Hopefully the replay is on tonight.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,AdaAstra,5,Wed May 27 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"These pitching changes extending the game a ton, was on pace for another game right around two hours."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ChiefakaJames,4,Wed May 27 19:17:43 2015 UTC,Bring back the bullpen cart!
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,RichardManuel,4,Wed May 27 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"Should have never let go of Hunter, and to counter that, great job bringing him back. His play on the field and leadership in the clubhouse (from what gets reported) has done wonders for the team."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,doublea08,7,Wed May 27 19:16:46 2015 UTC,I'm starting to think that Hunter has some weird Dorian Gray stuff going on where he sold his soul to something in Minnesota and only ages when he's out of the state.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,cardith_lorda,3,Wed May 27 19:14:00 2015 UTC,Or maybe it's Damn Yankees? Sold his soul so we could win the pennant? That was the Washington Senators after all.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,DetectiveWoofles,3,Wed May 27 19:18:15 2015 UTC,You might be right. Someone should check his locker area for a painting of him.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,BrianDoziersHair,3,Wed May 27 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be in his locker. It'd be in some closet covered up by a sheet because if he sees it, his average would drop below the Mendoza line."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,novafire08,4,Wed May 27 19:20:20 2015 UTC,Point well made. I hope the sheet is in the color style of a Zubaz.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,BrianDoziersHair,4,Wed May 27 19:21:21 2015 UTC,Dat Torii sliding catch.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,Tannekr,4,Wed May 27 19:12:51 2015 UTC,Hunter with the sliding catch!
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,dachristensen,4,Wed May 27 19:11:50 2015 UTC,I think Rosario needs to stay. He can't be the one sent back.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,y2jayjk,2,Wed May 27 19:11:44 2015 UTC,When who comes back?
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,taffyowner,6,Wed May 27 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'd send down Santana."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,doublea08,3,Wed May 27 19:14:40 2015 UTC,Good catch.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,FlyingScissor,2,Wed May 27 19:11:39 2015 UTC,Torii showing flashes of his younger self in the outfield!

It keeps saying that my browser is unsupported.  I'm using Internet Explorer Metro (I've tested it on IE11 and it doesn't work there either..?)  Edit: Grammar issues.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,SemiCharmedMike,5,Wed May 27 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"I'm using Internet Explorer   Without doing any sort of troubleshooting at all, I would guess the problem starts here.  Nah, just kidding. But really, I haven't had any issues. I just use Chrome with MLB.tv, though."

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,Tannekr,2,Wed May 27 19:03:53 2015 UTC,HOLY FUCK that was scary. Good god damn catch!   Now excuse me while I try to slow my racing heart.  Edit: a word.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,BrianDoziersHair,3,Wed May 27 19:03:15 2015 UTC,HALLELUJAH! Thank you Eddie!

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,tennisspears,3,Wed May 27 19:02:55 2015 UTC,Good catch.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,letsgotwins,4,Wed May 27 19:02:51 2015 UTC,Scoreboard watch: Royals are down 4-1.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,cardith_lorda,5,Wed May 27 19:02:36 2015 UTC,I'm in utter disbelief that there's a chance we'll be tied for first place with the damn Royals and Tigers in the division after they started so hot.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,kgthdc2468,6,Wed May 27 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"Knocking on wood, but do we own the tiebreaker? I know our head to head is even"
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ewok_bukkake,4,Wed May 27 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"There is no tiebreaker in baseball, regardless of what they might use for the standings, it always comes down to a one-game playoff."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,cardith_lorda,2,Wed May 27 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"I know, I meant in terms of standings. I was hoping we could claim 1st for the day if the Royals lost"
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ewok_bukkake,5,Wed May 27 19:47:38 2015 UTC,"No, I think the next tiebreaker is division record. Twins are 16-15, Royals are 15-10."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,tennisspears,4,Wed May 27 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"Ya I just looked it up as well, that sucks. Those damn Detroit games!"
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ewok_bukkake,4,Wed May 27 19:10:16 2015 UTC,This isn't the time to let Duensing try to figure his stuff out.

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,Derk-Derks,3,Wed May 27 18:59:35 2015 UTC,Watching Sox feed and they showed the Metrodome going down. Can anyone confirm if that was legit.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,letsgotwins,4,Wed May 27 18:58:00 2015 UTC,Metrodome was definitely not imploded. Pretty sure it was the Kingdome they showed.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,RichardManuel,3,Wed May 27 18:58:49 2015 UTC,It was. Here's the Metrodome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGodld4VsI0
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ChiefakaJames,4,Wed May 27 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah they partly used explosives for Metrodome, but the clip they showed was a complete structure being fully imploded."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,RichardManuel,4,Wed May 27 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, the ""it was"" was meant for it being the Kingdome."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ChiefakaJames,4,Wed May 27 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see now. Silly Bostonians."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,RichardManuel,7,Wed May 27 19:05:58 2015 UTC,Did they just show the Kingdome implosion and say it was Metrodome on the Sox broadcast?
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,RichardManuel,3,Wed May 27 18:57:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, checked a few videos online to confirm. Not sure why they'd say that it was the Metrodome besides trying to stick it to the Twins?"
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,BrianDoziersHair,5,Wed May 27 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"Kingdome/Metrodome, Eddie Rosario/Chris Hermann...what's the difference really."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,tokomini,2,Wed May 27 18:59:50 2015 UTC,"Huh, short leash for Hughes today?"
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,tennisspears,3,Wed May 27 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not sure how I feel about Deunsing here..."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,DetectiveWoofles,3,Wed May 27 18:58:38 2015 UTC,Definitely would rather have Hughes on the mound.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,cardith_lorda,4,Wed May 27 19:01:29 2015 UTC,Hey...fuck you Red Sox telecast. That was our HOME.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,Derk-Derks,3,Wed May 27 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"That was has first HR since his first pitch debut, right?"
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,carat135,3,Wed May 27 18:55:42 2015 UTC,You are correct!
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,Derk-Derks,3,Wed May 27 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"Lets GO! These Twins though, haven't had this much fun listening to ball games on the radio at work since 09! Makes noon games rock."

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,DetectiveWoofles,3,Wed May 27 18:53:19 2015 UTC,Daaaaamn.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,BrianDoziersHair,5,Wed May 27 18:55:17 2015 UTC,It's really nice to see Hicks AND Rosario go deep today. And VERY deep.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,Derk-Derks,1 point,Wed May 27 18:50:13 2015 UTC,Very nice to see a couple no-doubters from the young guns.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,doublea08,3,Wed May 27 19:03:57 2015 UTC,True that- good signs for the future.

minnesotatwins,37h3z7,hail_termite_queen,3,Wed May 27 18:48:44 2015 UTC,Rosario BOMB. Feels so great seeing a prospect come up and play well right away again.
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,vagrantwade,3,Wed May 27 18:48:28 2015 UTC,Long ball!
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,novafire08,4,Wed May 27 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"Rosario deep to the second deck? Sure, why not."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,ChiefakaJames,3,Wed May 27 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"Shit, that's Vargas and Ortiz territory."
minnesotatwins,37h3z7,tennisspears,2,Wed May 27 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"Good lord, that was CRUSHED."

We're usually too busy to notice actual runs, but in my department all of the timing goes off of what inming it is rather than the time of day so we peek at the TVs and inevitably notice the score too. I brushed up on baseball 101 only so I wouldn't seem like an idiot!  also, your distance isn't uncommon. Lots of people in guest services only do 2-3 games per month and live that far away."

That way you end up with a bunch of random threads at the top of the subreddit that no one knows what they meant when it's next year, or even this August.  If you've got something worth posting like some tweet about how well we're doing, post it and we can celebrate by upvoting that. But having a whole thread about ""Upvote this because we won"" doesn't add anything to the hype train.  EDIT: Since I'm getting downvoted, here's an example. The first walkoff win upvote party. It doesn't say who we walked off, it doesn't say how we won, it doesn't link to video of us walking off, but it is the number ten all-time post on the sub because it's all ""We won! Upvote this lol"". I hope it's something the mods look into, because when people look back on these posts, I want to know why we were celebrating."

minnesotatwins,37e2dd,Derk-Derks,6,Wed May 27 03:34:48 2015 UTC,"This is one of those times that I hate pitch counts. Pelfrey is cruising and just had two great innings, but because he is at 100 pitches he is pulled. He is more effective than he was early in the game, but because of a round number he is out."
minnesotatwins,37e2dd,Bickle19,3,Wed May 27 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like in the last 3 years pitch counts have gotten crazy restrictive. I almost never see pitchers go out if they've thrown high 90's or 100+ pitches. I remember seeing 120 pitch games regularly, now it seems unfathomable."
minnesotatwins,37e2dd,BrianDoziersHair,5,Wed May 27 03:34:12 2015 UTC,Yeah Pelf was on fire and probably could have finished the inning in 10 pitches the way he's been dealing. It's not like his arm is gonna fall off once he hits triple digits. Boyer has been awesome though so no complaints.

minnesotatwins,37e2dd,tennisspears,2,Wed May 27 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"Which is weird, because the catcher was pointing at the dirt like he wanted that ball way down. Instead he threw it right down the middle, but Santana just watched it."
minnesotatwins,37e2dd,StuntmanMichael123,3,Wed May 27 03:28:40 2015 UTC,Yup. Must have been thinking ball all the way. Cause that was a fastball just on a platter.
minnesotatwins,37e2dd,7Finger,3,Wed May 27 03:30:19 2015 UTC,"With the way the catcher was pointing like that, I was expecting a breaking ball in the dirt. Guess Buchholz thought otherwise."
minnesotatwins,37e2dd,Derk-Derks,1 point,Wed May 27 03:31:29 2015 UTC,"Wasn't watching, was the catcher just pointing, or making sure to tap the ground a few times, too? Usually it's a nice setup to keep hitting the ground for batters to hear it and think breaking stuff, then on younger/inexperienced players, blow a fastball by them."
minnesotatwins,37e2dd,BrianDoziersHair,1 point,Wed May 27 07:38:52 2015 UTC,"I just went back and watched it again. He just pointed at the ground emphatically about three or four times as Buchholz was starting his windup. As the ball was about to be released, he set his glove on the ground once, so that might be what you're talking about, but I don't think it really looked like he was trying to make noise to throw off the hitter. Possible though."
minnesotatwins,37e2dd,Derk-Derks,7,Wed May 27 12:28:25 2015 UTC,Gah. I just really wanna take a pair scissors and snip off Buchholz dangling hair.  It's really bothering me.

minnesotatwins,37dmxe,RichardManuel,2,Tue May 26 23:19:02 2015 UTC,The name letters are usually too small. It still looks good for a cheap jersey though.
minnesotatwins,37dmxe,PorcupineTheory,1 point,Wed May 27 01:02:51 2015 UTC,Nice. I've been thinking about buying some jerseys on there lately. I've heard they run a little small. Is that true for yours?
minnesotatwins,37dmxe,doublea08,1 point,Wed May 27 00:39:42 2015 UTC,I personally think they run large. I'm normally a medium but I had to get a large for this order since my previous orders have all been massive on me. My Vikings jersey almost reaches my knees.
minnesotatwins,37dmxe,HakunaMatata023,2,Wed May 27 03:01:24 2015 UTC,"That............makes no sense.  If mediums have been massive on you, why would you get a large?"
minnesotatwins,37gils,dabecka,6,Wed May 27 13:39:06 2015 UTC,I like the enthusiasm and idea but now isn't the time to get crazy. Just because we're doing well doesn't mean it's time to sell high. We have tons of young talent that we should keep and continue to develop. Tulo is 30 and isn't getting any faster or younger. Plus why take away innings from Santana. He's going to be solid in the future (if he continues to develop). I don't really see any position right now that needs an immediate upgrade so keep riding these players out.
minnesotatwins,37gils,bigbird249,-1,Wed May 27 14:13:21 2015 UTC,Because the difference between Tulo and Danny Santana is about 3-4 wins (and maybe 5) a year.  Tulo is a difference maker with 30 HR power with high average and is the best defensive shortstop not named Andrelton.
minnesotatwins,37gils,bigbird249,4,Wed May 27 18:15:28 2015 UTC,Not to be a downer but Tulo has hit 30 dingers twice in his 10 year career and its been over 2 years since he won a gold glove. I think you're over rating how good he is man. I'd take easily Santana over him no sweat.
minnesotatwins,37gils,DaDoviende,3,Wed May 27 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"I'd take easily Santana over him no sweat.   Let's not get crazy here.  I'd take Tulo over Santana in a heartbeat, in a vacuum.  But in the real world, Santana + keeping all the pieces it would take to get Tulo is better than getting him, yes."
minnesotatwins,37gils,tennisspears,4,Wed May 27 20:29:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Meyer, Polanco, Stewart gets the deal done. I think Colorado would want more, but I don't think the Twins should give up much more than that."
minnesotatwins,37gils,guiltycitizen,1 point,Wed May 27 14:20:28 2015 UTC,I agree -- since most trade deals being tossed around by pundits have Colorado kicking in millions.
minnesotatwins,37gils,y2jayjk,3,Wed May 27 16:54:13 2015 UTC,I'd rather not see us go the rental route this season if we can avoid it.   Let's just clone Perkins
minnesotatwins,37gils,taffyowner,1 point,Wed May 27 14:44:51 2015 UTC,Except it's not a rental.  He's signed through 2021.
minnesotatwins,37gils,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,3,Wed May 27 18:11:54 2015 UTC,No Buying. We have so many tools in the minors.
minnesotatwins,37gils,chucktestlacoil,1 point,Wed May 27 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, we do.  But only 9 guys can play at once."
minnesotatwins,37gils,southsideson,2,Wed May 27 16:55:15 2015 UTC,You also forgot nick Gordon as one of the teams future shortstops
minnesotatwins,37gils,RobertService,0,Wed May 27 16:18:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed I did.  He's a year or 2 behind Polanco, IMO, but good catch!"
minnesotatwins,37gils,Kruse,2,Wed May 27 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not keen on selling the Twins' future for a chance to win this year.  Let's look at the position players and who are/will play there:  C: Suzuki / Pinto  1B: Mauer / Sano  2B: Dozier  3B: Plouffe / Sano  SS: Santana / Escobar / Gordon  LF: Rosario / Arcia / Plouffe?  CF: Hicks / Buxton  RF: Hunter / Rosario  Here's your potential future lineup in 2016 or 2017:  Dozier (2B), Buxton (CF), Mauer (1B), Sano (3B), Plouffe (LF), Arcia (DH), Rosario (RF), Pinto (C), Santana/Escobar (SS)  Won't necessarily be in that order, but you get the idea. If Sano can't play 3B and is the DH you leave Plouffe at third and now LF is open.  Arcia could play there, but I hate his defense.  So really, the only spot that they might need to address would be an outfielder.  They could shoot for a high profile free agent outfielder following the 2016 season if they feel they need one.  Personally I'd stay right where they're at.  Their window is opening, not closing.  No need for rash moves.  Edit: And we don't know what we have in these pitchers.  As you said, guys like Pelfrey and Gibson are playing great, but will they continue to?  Will they re-sign Pelfrey?  Will Nolasco get back to form? Will May continue to improve? How will Santana do when his suspension is up?  How do the prospects (Stewert, Berrios, Meyer, etc) pan out?  Lots of questions we don't know the answers to.  Personally I'm hoping that after 2016 they have three or four solid starters and then go out and get an ace in free agency."
minnesotatwins,37gils,chucktestlacoil,2,Thu May 28 04:46:15 2015 UTC,"In think if this team continues to succeed you call up buxton mid June.  ASB at the latest.  You also make a move for a couple middle relievers that are upcoming free agents.  Nothing special, just a guy our two to get you to perkins.  There needs to be some buying if this is a contender, but I wouldn't move any big pieces."
minnesotatwins,37gils,kvothe,1 point,Wed May 27 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I could see a team out of the hunt willing to move a decent bullpen arm for someone like Arcia.  He's still young, and there's still potential there, but I don't really see him as a contributor as the Twins go forward.  Arcia for a more known commodity LF type professional hitter I could see making sense.  Any corner outfielders that can hit .265 and flirt with 15 HRs while playing average D?  I could see a non contender trading a vet player with an unfavorable contract, or an upcoming free agent for Arcia and possibly some minor league depth."
minnesotatwins,37gils,audiocranium,2,Sun Jun 7 09:55:19 2015 UTC,That trade is okay by me. The only guy guy in the minors that is untouchable for me is Buxton.
minnesotatwins,37gils,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 27 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"I mentioned it in a thread yesterday, but I think it may be time to think about shipping Alex Meyer away and hope for a decent return. His pitching as a starter just hasn't been encouraging, but there still might be a shred of sell-high ability with him."
minnesotatwins,37gils,darkfangs,2,Wed May 27 15:43:45 2015 UTC,I don't see much value in meyer right now.  He's circling the drain in value.  Needs to be held and hope he rebounds.

Who hangs up?"
minnesotatwins,37gils,sloppybuttmustard,1 point,Wed May 27 20:21:03 2015 UTC,That's a tough decision. I'd get to keep Stewart. But have to give up Berrios. But also get 30M towards Tulo. I need to think about this one for a little while.
minnesotatwins,37gils,southsideson,1 point,Wed May 27 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"i'll counter-offer that trade and make it Rockies send Troy Tulowitski and $30MM to Minnesota for C Josmil Pinto, SS Jorge Polanco, and SP Aaron Slegers and a player to be named later.  ptbnl list: lewis thorpe, alex meyers, oswaldo arcia  This isn't good enough probably and if needed more I'd not make the trade unless the pitcher on the roster already become elite this season and we really want to go out.

minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Nowin,7,Wed May 27 07:29:32 2015 UTC,"I still think Pelfrey and Nolasco are due for a big correction, and probably Gibson as well. Hopefully these corrections are just modest in nature, and not full on explosions.   I think if Nolasco goes anywhere, it's up. He's better (maybe even much better) than he has been pitching so far this year. Gibson might see some regression, but then again, he was seen as a potentially dominant pitcher in the minors before that elbow surgery. Pelfrey pitching well (btw, totally called that shit) probably won't last forever, but milk him for all he's worth. Great to see the Twins have pitching again."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Jorgenstern8,12,Tue May 26 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"After Santana was suspended I definitely told everyone that would listen they would never be over .500 all season.  Very happy to eat this crow though.  Screw the haters and the stats that say they aren't ""that good"" etc. because those games are in the bank, they won them and there can be such a thing as over-reliance on stats."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,8,Tue May 26 13:52:51 2015 UTC,Santana's suspension could be a blessing in disguise. He'll be 15 or so games fresher than every other starter and can shoulder a big load if someone needs to take a step back mid-season.  Also there's no way Terry is gonna trade what we have away in the minors. This Front Office knows what it's doing.
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,OrbitsUnbounded,10,Tue May 26 14:39:07 2015 UTC,Also remember that Santana is ineligible for postseason play this year. I remember having a hearty laugh when that was first announced. How great would it be if that became a relevant issue?
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,RichardManuel,3,Tue May 26 15:31:02 2015 UTC,This Front Office knows what it's doing.   I'm still waiting for concrete proof of that.
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Aram_Fingal,2,Tue May 26 20:32:43 2015 UTC,It will be as if he is a big time free agent signing in mid season.

minnesotatwins,37bpl1,CantaloupeCamper,5,Tue May 26 14:51:20 2015 UTC,What about Terry Ryan's history makes you worry that he might try to mortgage the future for a chance to win now?

minnesotatwins,37bpl1,DaDoviende,5,Tue May 26 18:59:13 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Terry Ryan knows that we may be a little premature as well. Our problems the past few years were due to the GM-ing of Bill Smith (2007-2011). I hate how some fans blame Ryan for these past few years. So I'm not worried about him.
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,The_Swiss_Mistress,3,Tue May 26 15:04:41 2015 UTC,"Ya Terry Ryan isn't an idiot. If this team made any major purchases it wouldn't be until the trade deadline and by then we would know if this team was playing over their head or actually legit. Furthermore, Ryan has always been very adverse in trading away young talent."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,ewok_bukkake,0,Tue May 26 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"Terry Ryan has made plenty of shitty personnel decisions since returning to the team.

minnesotatwins,37bpl1,FlannelBeard,13,Tue May 26 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"As much fun as this all has been it has been just a couple months, and some very strong stats still point to this team being unusually fortunate.   Still I don't think it is going too far to say though that we've seen some guys show up who are worth hanging on to where maybe in the past we thought otherwise.  Also Cleveland has been shown to have been super unlucky and that is turning around too, being division rivals that is going to be problematic.    I totally agree with your concern about this success going to their heads.   This team still has big holes in it, and FUCK SHORT TERM BILL SMITH TYPE TRADES.  We should be building on this team for the Buxton's and etc for longer term.   Don't get carried away with the naow, but still enjoy it."

However, the reason the twins FO hasnt taken to sabermetrics as heavily as others, is that they spent the 2000s out performing the metrics. Its not impossible that we could do that again."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,derpdeederpa,3,Tue May 26 16:07:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said here. Very happy to see the team off to a hot start, but it would be a waste to give up the future that we all have been waiting for the past four years."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Kruse,3,Tue May 26 14:00:42 2015 UTC,"At least when someone regresses, we'll have Santana to replace them (though what his baseline is after steroids is anyone's guess). But even if we regress to a ~0.500 team, it's still far from a disappointment given preseason expectations.  All of what you said is completely true. And I'm glad they're having this streak at the beginning of the season, rather than at the end (we get to enjoy 2nd place after almost 50 games)."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,derpdeederpa,2,Tue May 26 14:23:12 2015 UTC,"At least when someone regresses, we'll have Santana to replace them   Don't forget about Milone."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Kruse,1 point,Tue May 26 15:14:13 2015 UTC,True. We have a lot of #4-#5 starter depth..
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Kruse,3,Tue May 26 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"As far as I am concerned, everyone in our Top 10 should be off limits, except for Alex Meyer.   To be honest, I think they should trade Meyer ASAP. Something isn't right about this guy and there may be just a sliver left of ""sell high"" ability with him before it's too late."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Shagomir,0,Tue May 26 15:18:57 2015 UTC,"Problem is, they already ruined him. They should have called him up last summer, when he was absolutely on fire as a starter. Strike when the iron is hot. Instead, they were worried about service time, and giving playing time to inferior pitchers who they overpaid for. His value is absolutely gone. Why would anyone want a 25 year old with poor control who hasn't even cracked the major leagues yet?"

minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Aluminum_Love_Cradle,1 point,Tue May 26 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"I doubt that, since he's still throwing 98 and striking dudes out. He just can't get the damn ball over the plate on a consistent basis."

minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Capn_Barboza,2,Tue May 26 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"I think Meyer's future is as a relief pitcher, and possibly a very good one. Twins shouldn't trade him for peanuts until they try just letting him pitch an inning or two every other game or so."

minnesotatwins,37bpl1,PigFarmington,3,Tue May 26 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"Why are we still down on this rotation? Kyle Gibson is on FIRE - and striking people out now. Hughes is coming back to earth a bit, but he's still going to be fine. Sure, Pelfrey and Nolasco seem like ticking time bombs, but I wouldn't be surprised if they both settled in the average range. We have depth for the first time ever with guys like Milone raging in AAA and strikeout arms like Berrios are right under our noses."

I love that we're ""outperforming metrics"" and ""getting lucky"" but honestly this team has passed the eye test for quite some time to me. They play with a confidence and swagger that I haven't seen in years.   Plouffe and Dozier are both all-star players and Torii Hunter is an ageless wonder who is having a great impact on our youngins'. Aaron Hicks (dare I say) is blooming into a major league regular and is holding down CF like a boss right now - and I fucking love that leg kick."

Although I agree they can't sell the farm for a run right now, at some point in the next couple of years they are going to have to trade some pieces. Buxton, Rosario, Walker, Kepler, Hicks, and Arcia can't all play the OF at the same time.  Even though starting pitching has been competent, there isn't a shut down ace on the staff, and the catcher position is super thin behind Suzuki. Hard to say no to ALL trades without knowing what is on the table."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,1iI1iI1iI1iI,1 point,Tue May 26 19:05:30 2015 UTC,4 outfielders. Let's play softball style. We don't need a SS with Plouffe and Dozier sucking up everything in the infield!

This team is fun to watch again, and it will be all season as long as the key players don't get hurt, and I agree there is no need to add to the major league roster from anywhere except the minor leagues."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Katbot22,2,Tue May 26 21:58:03 2015 UTC,Sano isn't ready yet and I have a feeling he will go through growing pains at the Major League level (lots of K's).....I'd be pissed if they traded Plouffe.
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,ajdragoon,1 point,Wed May 27 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"Totally agree about Sano, no reason to bring him up now, but with Santana, Escobar, Nunez, we have serviceable infielders if you can get  a solid prospect for Plouffe."

minnesotatwins,37bpl1,RobertService,1 point,Wed May 27 04:28:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm now worried about this no-late-scoring thing. Yes a run is a run, but baseball being the statistical hive that it is, this is bound to see a correction. Short of scoring 10 runs per first-three-innings, your offense can't fall asleep in the later half of the game. Especially because--in the heat of pennant races--good teams will find ways to mount comebacks against your pitching. You have to be able to respond.   Of course, the other correction is that they buck this trend altogether. I'd prefer that one."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,tennisspears,-3,Wed May 27 12:09:31 2015 UTC,I'd still bet on this team being under .500 at the end of the year.
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,RobertService,-5,Tue May 26 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"Hell, they are still a 90 loss team. People in this thread are ridiculously overly optimistic. They believe what they want to believe."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,tennisspears,2,Tue May 26 22:30:35 2015 UTC,"They believe what they want to believe.   You believe what you want to believe, too, buddy.  In order for the Twins to lose 90 again this year, they would have to go at a 100-loss pace the rest of the season (46/118 = .390, which is around 63-99 over a full season). Good luck with that.  And you can say they have been lucky, because they have, but the wins they have now are in the bank already. You can't predict bad luck going forward to even out good luck from the past. You should predict average luck any time in the future, and expect that good luck and bad luck will even out in the future games. Two months of good luck do not mean two months of bad luck are guaranteed to happen later. Yes, it is technically possible that they will have bad luck for two straight months, but that is just as likely as them continuing their good luck for two months. Basically, if you predicted a record preseason, and you don't think they are any different now than they were then, you should carry that prediction's winning percentage for the rest of the year, rather than saying they will still win that number of games. Regression doesn't mean balancing out good luck from before with bad luck later. It means looking forward, their good that is still to come and bad that is still to come will even out to the predicted average only in those games.  Example: Say you predicted 72-90 (.444 WP), and now they are 26-18. There are 118 games left. You should take the .444 times the 118 for the remaining games, which is just over 52 wins, bringing them to 78 total wins. It is silly to think they will lose a significantly higher percentage of games between May 26 and September 30 than you expected them to lose from April 1 to September 30, unless something pretty bad happened in those first two months, like a severe injury to an important player."
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,Mariox,-1,Tue May 26 23:22:49 2015 UTC,Did they have a stretch like that last year?
minnesotatwins,37bpl1,RobertService,1 point,Tue May 26 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"In June-September, they went 45-64, a .413 WP.   That WP for the rest of this season would give them 49 more wins, putting them at 75-87 at the end of this year. And they are a better team this year, with better young players waiting in the wings (Buxton and Sano > Santana and Vargas) and a decent pitcher who will be joining the rotation in July.  I think that 75-87 record is still possible for this year, but I think that would be close to their floor, rather than a good average estimate of their final record."
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,Evergreen3,5,Wed May 27 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"Trade Arcia, his defense is sub-par and do we really need him? We have so many outfielders, not even including buxton."
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,doublea08,2,Wed May 27 11:04:53 2015 UTC,"I second this.  We have other better all around players that can fill in better than Arcia.  Send him packing, he's worth more in trade value to us at this point."
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,quickie440,2,Wed May 27 14:48:59 2015 UTC,Arcia had a .790+ OPS at 22 with mad power and isn't a total disaster in left like Nunez and Escobar are.   You don't trade guys like that.
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,dabecka,3,Wed May 27 11:47:36 2015 UTC,"Very true, but I mean at some point there has to be moves doesn't there? Obviously its early in the season and its nice to have the problem of to many guys at a position who can produce. Then again with the way the Twins are playing I don't know who you would trade for and be able to plug into the lineup. Maybe trade for a solid reliever. I'm lost at the moment with the Twins playing so well its gotten me all flustered, in a good way. Just keep winning."
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,doublea08,2,Wed May 27 12:37:41 2015 UTC,"You are correct in that it takes something to get something.  And lord knows, if the Twins are close come trade deadline, Terry Ryan should be making moves.  But for what?  A power reliever?  We have those in Nick Burdi, Jake Reed, and hell...Jose Berrios could be used like the Royals used Brandon Finnegan last year.  A shortstop?  The Twins have two future shortstops in Danny Santana and Jorge Polanco.  Why trade away anything of value for a marginal upgrade not named ""Tulowitzki"".  1B, 2B, and 3B are immovable objects.  Catcher?  You want to break up the current rapport that Suzuki has with Gibson, Pelfrey, and other overachieving starters?  Obviously CF and LF need a ton of work...but Buxton could be brought up for a (potential) game-changing upgrade offensively.    Starting pitching?  Always could use starting pitching, but its almost June and Pelfrey and Gibson have an under 3.00 ERA.  You're getting Santana back.  Tommy Millone is lights out at AAA and bursting his way back into the picture.  Trevor May looks super as a #3.    IMO, the Twins should be making a huge splash by flipping some current and young pieces for a huge part or a rental.    Time to get crazy.  I want Troy Tulowitzki.  Tulo would be an instant upgrade and a Gold Glove SS.  He has RH power.  When healthy, he's a top 5 player in the game.  And he's still relatively young and in his prime.  He's a 5-7 WAR player when healthy.  Downsides, he's hardly healthy, he's being prissy right now in Colorado, his contract is pretty large through 2021.  I think if you can send them Alex Meyer, Jorge Polanco, Kohl Stewart, and another prospect, who says no?"
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,dabecka,1 point,Wed May 27 13:37:15 2015 UTC,"Looking at people with 400+ AB last year he was #54 in terms of SLG % and #19 in terms of ISO % at age 23. Now, he obviously has things to work on, ie. his atrocious 31% K rate (which hopefully is just an outlier due to him normally being in the mid 20s) and his defense.   However, in his defense, heh, his numbers defensively are getting better with each year to the point where we'd expect average numbers this year. Which is good, considering he is here for his absurd power specs."
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,BobLobLawsLawFirm,4,Wed May 27 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"Could be a pitcher, since they are currently carrying 13.   I would think before too long, Arcia and either Vargas or Pinto comes up, and Rosario and a pitcher go down. That pitcher might be Stauffer or Duensing getting DFA if they still suck. Otherwise I would guess Tonkin?   Edit: Shit, forgot Fien will be back soon, too. If it were up to me, Stauffer and Duensing would both be gone. Rosario would probably be the first position player sent down right now, but I would also consider sending Santana to Rochester for a while."
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,tennisspears,3,Wed May 27 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"On a team carrying 13 pitchers, it shouldn't be a position player.    Duensing being lefthanded is the only thing keeping him in the major leagues in my mind."

minnesotatwins,37eaqq,FlyingScissor,1 point,Wed May 27 00:20:36 2015 UTC,Rosario is one of the best clutch hitters on the team and brings something defensively. I would rather move a pitcher down.

minnesotatwins,37eaqq,hail_termite_queen,2,Wed May 27 04:22:26 2015 UTC,Stauffer should go.
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,y2jayjk,2,Wed May 27 05:05:26 2015 UTC,I have my fingers crossed that Stauffer is DFA'd when Fien is ready to come back later this week
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,SenatorAstronomer,2,Wed May 27 19:37:23 2015 UTC,Nunez ?
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,DoubleOhFour,3,Wed May 27 01:17:06 2015 UTC,He's been hitting pretty well. I'd prefer they leave Arcia down in the minors!   It's nice having a defense that can cover the outfield!
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,DoubleOhFour,4,Wed May 27 02:23:13 2015 UTC,Right? I just feel like adding Arcia isn't worth losing the outfield unless Hicks isn't have a good time
minnesotatwins,37eaqq,dabecka,3,Wed May 27 03:00:04 2015 UTC,They keep talking about how great the pitching has been of late - not always mentioning that it's coincided with having the best fielding outfielders in the outfield.   I know Hicks has been getting credit for saving some runs... I'd love to see it continue!
minnesotatwins,37c44b,Kripzo,5,Tue May 26 15:15:39 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the Twins are around 20th in OBP and OPS. I'd feel a lot more confident about the hot streak continuing if they start getting more patient at the plate.
minnesotatwins,37c44b,The_Effing_Eagle,3,Tue May 26 18:15:36 2015 UTC,"Just taking a look right now at our K/BBs ratio, and it's a pretty obvious blemish in an otherwise productive lineup.    Player Strikeouts Walks    Plouffe 36 20   Mauer 32 16   Dozier 41 19   Hunter 32 13   Santana 42 2   Escobar 29 3   Rosario 16 1    Kurt Suzuki is the only one even close to a 1:1 with 15 Ks and 11 BBs.   We're doing a good job of bunching hits together right now, but we've also had our fair share of ""nothing innings"" thanks to a lack of plate discipline. That needs to change."
minnesotatwins,37c44b,tokomini,3,Tue May 26 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"It is rare for batters to be 1:1 for K to BB. Last year I think only two batters, Martinez and Bautista, walked more often than they struck out. Suzuki's K%-BB% was 12th at 2.3%.  I obviously agree that it'd be great if the Twins could draw more walks. Santana, Escobar, and Rosario all have alarming ratios. Santana will probably go back to Rochester soon to work on it."
minnesotatwins,37c44b,wstrauss,2,Tue May 26 23:09:42 2015 UTC,"No you're right, I didn't mean to establish a 1:1 as a norm or anything, I could have worded that better.   Out of curiosity, I looked up Mauer's K/BB ratio in years past. From 2006-2012 (throwing out injury shortened 2011) he never struck out more than he walked. Last two years, he has 121 BB vs. 185 K. Not sure what to make of that.   And as of last night, Joe has a perfect 1:1 ratio for his career - 692 K, 692 BB."
minnesotatwins,37c44b,tokomini,2,Tue May 26 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"Mauer is much worse than he used to be. He just doesn't see the ball like he used to, most likely because of age and concussions.  FanGraphs has him at -0.1 WAR so far this year... I do think he has been better than that, but he still hasn't been that good.  I would like to see him shave that beard."
minnesotatwins,37c44b,wstrauss,2,Tue May 26 23:31:02 2015 UTC,Definitely. Walks were an important part of the offense's success last year. If they can get those back up it's going to be a pretty threatening line up.

minnesotatwins,37d4b4,grensley,10,Wed May 27 22:24:35 2015 UTC,I'd agree that Perkins has the best shot. He had been outstanding so far this season.  I also think that Dozier is All Star worthy but so is Altuve and Kipnis. Does Dozier deserve to go over them? Probably not.
minnesotatwins,37d4b4,SemiCharmedMike,4,Tue May 26 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Dozier: .251/.332/.503 - 9 HR, 24 RBI, 35 R (leads baseball) Altuve: .299/.348/.429 - 5 HR, 25 RBI, 23 R Kipnis: .337/.408/.508 - 4 HR, 21 RBI, 32 R  These guys all deserve a mention, if for different reasons. 3 great all around second basemen. But right now, Kipnis is the guy to beat. Still, Dozier is very deserving."
minnesotatwins,37d4b4,audiocranium,2,Tue May 26 20:33:59 2015 UTC,And didn't Kipnis start slow this season? I have him on my fantasy team and was thinking of moving him due to the cold start. Imagine if he had been playing this well since Opening Day.
minnesotatwins,37d4b4,SemiCharmedMike,3,Tue May 26 20:41:28 2015 UTC,He sure did. He's been on an absolute tear lately. The 400+ OBP is what really does it for me. He's not just hitting - he's obviously seeing the ball in x-ray slow motion right now.
minnesotatwins,37d4b4,audiocranium,1 point,Tue May 26 21:25:33 2015 UTC,"Holy Kipnis that line is truly incredible. Cool that Dozier has more runs and a comparable slugging%, though."
minnesotatwins,37d4b4,hail_termite_queen,1 point,Tue May 26 23:06:43 2015 UTC,There are going to be at least two second basemen at the all-star game this year. Dozier should be one of them.
minnesotatwins,37d4b4,novafire08,6,Wed May 27 06:40:16 2015 UTC,"Perkins is a lock in my opinion. Best closer in baseball right now. Dozier, Plouffe, Torii, hell maybe even Mauer. Kyle Gibson gets my vote too if he keeps this strikeout stuff up."
minnesotatwins,37d4b4,audiocranium,9,Tue May 26 19:29:07 2015 UTC,Mauer doesn't deserve a spot.
minnesotatwins,37d4b4,wstrauss,5,Tue May 26 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"He deserves a spot as the all-star of our hearts. But yeah, he shouldn't be in Cincinnati this year."

minnesotatwins,37felr,kuj4k,2,Wed May 27 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"If you want to see batting practice you need to be there when gates open, which is 2 hours before game time on weekends. Bacon tot dish is awesome."

minnesotatwins,37bozb,Zeeker12,3,Tue May 26 14:21:27 2015 UTC,Interesting article...until the last paragraph.
minnesotatwins,37bozb,Kruse,3,Tue May 26 14:07:22 2015 UTC,That article really doesn't give them too much love lol. The conclusion is that their success probably won't continue.
minnesotatwins,37bozb,wstrauss,1 point,Tue May 26 23:11:15 2015 UTC,"Note that while I'm enjoying this winning streak, we may be in for a rude awakening as ""clutchness"" usually regresses to the mean.  Especially with a starting pitching staff that doesn't strike anyone out.  I would say neither do the relief staff other than Perkins."
minnesotatwins,37bozb,mattsoca,2,Tue May 26 13:17:13 2015 UTC,"Yup.   Exactly as I read it..  But it buys the club some time.   Hopefully it provides some confidence in a beat down club (and I'm a firm believer that confidence is key in being successful in anything,  but especially sports).   When they do regress,  do we have  Malone,  Buxton,  Sano,  Myers, Santana, and/or others to provide a mid- to late-year boost.   Msybe the combo of building a plus .500 record now and that talent later gives them a soft landing when that regression takes hold."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,RG__II,9,Tue May 26 16:39:31 2015 UTC,Buxton needs to start hitting more triples before we even think about calling him up. 😁
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,gopherman23,8,Tue May 26 18:10:37 2015 UTC,"Haha, are you not entertained?!! I'm worried he'll never get into the 20/20/20/20 club because he'll average 30 triples and 15 doubles :/"
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,hail_termite_queen,2,Tue May 26 18:13:04 2015 UTC,Buxton is going to basically turn any single that isn't hit right at an outfielder into a double. He'll get his share of doubles...
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,hail_termite_queen,1 point,Tue May 26 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"Haha that's right, I was thinking about this the other day and forgot about that revelation. Even without massive power his slugging% should be ridiculous..."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,Kruse,2,Tue May 26 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yea....he has the potential to be a generational superstar. I don't really say that about anyone, but he is a better prospect than Mauer."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,hail_termite_queen,5,Tue May 26 19:46:43 2015 UTC,He'll now be known as Byron Baseball.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,7Finger,5,Tue May 26 21:02:41 2015 UTC,"Let him start dominating AA. He is playing well right now, but let him get back into the groove. If he is hitting this well, he will get his cup of coffee in August/September. If he starts destroying the ball like he has in the last week or so, he will be up sooner.   Hicks should definitely get all of the time needed to evaluate him up here, because this is his last option year.   I am so excited about our outfield, but curious about how we will make room for everyone. Hicks, Rosario, Kepler, Buxton, Arcia, Harrison and Walker are all guys who are very close to needing time  or currently need time in the major league outfield to evaluate them. Still, out of those 7 there's a pretty good chance 3 come out as solid players. I'm especially excited about what Kepler is doing on the farm this year."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,NotPercyChuggs,3,Tue May 26 18:04:38 2015 UTC,"As soon as the Twins decide that Hicks's stellar defense doesn't make up for the fact that he can't hit, which will probably be when we start to lose."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,y2jayjk,6,Tue May 26 21:28:35 2015 UTC,"2016 Opening Day starter in center field and batting leadoff. Let him spend the entire season in Chattanooga, learning from Dougie Baseball and raking with Sano, Kepler, and Polanco. Let Aaron Hicks play out the rest of 2015 in CF and see if he finally figures it out. If so, move him to RF in 2016, and let him and Buxton take away anything going that way. If he ends up tanking, you cut your losses, and let Buxton, Rosario, Arcia, Kepler, and Torii roam the outfield."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,JakeIsWet,2,Tue May 26 16:46:38 2015 UTC,I think it's vital that Buxton at least plays a little bit in the MLB this year. Even if it's like 3-4 games.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,The_No_Lifer,0,Wed May 27 05:06:49 2015 UTC,If Hicks does well enough to keep the job for the rest of the year I'll bet they put Buxton in RF for a minute.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,hail_termite_queen,5,Tue May 26 17:37:34 2015 UTC,Hicks is an above-average defensive CF.  Buxton is a gold-glove caliber CF.  Buxton has so much speed that Hicks will never be as good of defender as Buxton is now
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,Fuck_Yeah_Dumba,4,Tue May 26 17:52:37 2015 UTC,This is probably true. Buxton is basically has 85-90 speed on a 20-80 scale. He will be one of the fastest players we have ever seen in a Twins uniform.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,hail_termite_queen,2,Tue May 26 18:02:33 2015 UTC,Serious question because I'm just starting to get back into baseball after about 5 years away: is he faster than Gomez?
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,OrbitsUnbounded,3,Tue May 26 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"I would certainly say so. Gomez was fast, but Buxton is basically as fast as a baseball player can possibly be. Like I said, he rates as faster than a perfect on the tools scale. Gomez was probably 75, maybe 80 out of 80. I think only Billy Hamilton is considered faster than Buxton in all of baseball."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,kvothe,1 point,Tue May 26 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"As the other guy said, Buxton is just as fast, if not faster, than Billy Hamilton. Except he's a 5 tool prospect.. So he's good."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,JakeIsWet,2,Wed May 27 04:28:52 2015 UTC,"Billy is slightly faster, per Kiley McD. 85 vs 90 speed."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,NotPercyChuggs,0,Wed May 27 20:07:33 2015 UTC,"They can use the reasoning that Buxton needs time to adjust to the MLB game and they don't wont to overwhelm him with an abundance of defensive responsibilities while he's trying to get comfortable as a hitter. If Hicks is an above average defensive CF (which he is when he's got his head on straight) and they're happy enough with his bat to keep him in the lineup, I don't think they'll move him to RF. Of course there's the option that they just won't keep him altogether and trade him"
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,chucktestlacoil,2,Tue May 26 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"Nope, Buxton is the CF the day he arrives at Target Field. It doesn't matter if Aaron Hicks literally jumps over the center field wall and robs David Ortiz of a home run, that spot has been Buxton's since the day he was drafted."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,dabecka,-3,Tue May 26 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally wouldn't want a top 2 prospect in all of baseball to come up and try and help this roster make the playoffs at any point this year."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,chucktestlacoil,5,Tue May 26 21:57:45 2015 UTC,You don't eat the chicken before it's ready.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,forgetfulburglar,0,Tue May 26 23:39:15 2015 UTC,Scared money don't make none.  Buxton & Sano would improve this roster today.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,chucktestlacoil,3,Wed May 27 01:02:52 2015 UTC,We could also be a lot better today if we traded them! What's best today isn't necessarily what's best longterm.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,NotPercyChuggs,-1,Wed May 27 02:04:57 2015 UTC,"This team has built for next year long enough.  This is about saving money, not development."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,chucktestlacoil,2,Wed May 27 02:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we should rush our prospects to the Majors so that we can maybe get the honor of being beaten in the Wild Card round by Kansas City or Tampa. Totally smart move there."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,NotPercyChuggs,-1,Wed May 27 14:15:03 2015 UTC,"""Rushed""  Buxton isn't here to save the pohlads a few million.  This has nothing to do with development."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,chucktestlacoil,2,Wed May 27 14:49:47 2015 UTC,Right...  He basically lost his entire 2014. He's had stretches in AA where he hasn't done anything. He's still just 22 years old. You make it sound like he is Mike Trout and that if he was in the Majors he would be one of the 5 best players in baseball. This is 100% about development.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,NotPercyChuggs,-1,Wed May 27 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"Twins pr machine so strong the fans do it for them.  It's complete bs if buxton sits an entire year in the minors.    If you want to be conservative and keep waiting, fine.  But my op is responding to someone who said 2016.  That's way to freaking long.  ASB at the latest."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,chucktestlacoil,2,Wed May 27 15:22:59 2015 UTC,No use discussing this with someone like you.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,NotPercyChuggs,-1,Wed May 27 15:44:51 2015 UTC,"Lol, you've presented no case worthy of acting this smug."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,chucktestlacoil,3,Wed May 27 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"I've clearly stated why he doesn't need to be in the Majors this year. All you say is shit like ""Huurrrr durrrr, it's just about teh money!"" No, it isn't. The Twins could sell an assload of tickets by calling him up and promoting it as ""Come see the Future of the Twins!"" but they aren't doing that. Because they know he needs more time in the Minors. Get a fucking clue."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,fishouflager,0,Wed May 27 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"It's fun to be that naive eh?  The twins stand to lose millions and a year of team control if they call him up before mid June.  Hide behind development all you want, but if you're gonna say that, please enlighten me in what parts of buxton's game needs work.  Be specific, you are the development expert after all."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,OrbitsUnbounded,2,Wed May 27 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"The amount of hope and hype being piled on this kid makes me nervous. My gut says let him play a full year at Chattanooga, see how he does in ST next year, then make a decision."
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,DaDoviende,2,Tue May 26 20:16:12 2015 UTC,Exactly. Statistically he's not even the best guy on the AA roster right now. That roster is probably one of the best assembled because they are dominating. He will get his time and we all know (but certainly don't hope) this success is short-term.
minnesotatwins,37cg0t,dabecka,1 point,Wed May 27 04:30:48 2015 UTC,"I think it first hinges on how Buxton performs the next month and a half, but I have a feeling he'll really start to take off soon. I'd be all for a quick promotion to Rochester to let him see some craftier pitchers with more developed off-speed stuff, but I don't know that he needs it.  Second, it really depends on if we need him. If Hicks and Arcia are hitting really well, Rosario proves he should stick around and Shane Robinson is having good at bats, then I'm all for letting him split the year at AA/AAA and holding off on starting the service clock.  That being said, I don't think Hicks/Arcia/Rosario will do so well as to prevent Buxton's call up when Buxton goes nuts in June. I really think this all depends on Buxton and whether he proves that the minors hold no further challenge. Development doesn't end at promotion time and sometimes a prospect needs to be learning at that next level. It'd be a shame to keep that from him if he earns it and the circumstances work out as I suspect they will."
minnesotatwins,37dkvk,Kruse,2,Tue May 26 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"We don't really have any toolsy outfielders from Georgia in the system, so I'd have to go with Daz Cameron."

minnesotatwins,379u4g,CantaloupeCamper,6,Tue May 26 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"On one hand, it is a problem that the Twins are scoring all their runs in one or two innings. On the other hand, a run is a run, and it doesn't really matter how you get them as long as you are getting hits with runners in scoring position."
minnesotatwins,379u4g,Kripzo,6,Tue May 26 03:59:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Also, scoring early generally puts the opposing team on the wrong foot (not sure if that's the proper way to phrase it, but eh) and puts pressure and therefore causes them to press more than they need to.   Put it this way, if anything: Twins are doing what was done to them in the last 4 years."
minnesotatwins,379u4g,BrianDoziersHair,3,Tue May 26 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"Eh it's only really a problem if we start scoring less in those one or two innings and can't score otherwise. Otherwise, yes, a run is a run. At the end of the day the scoreboard doesn't care if you scored 1 run in the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 9th, or 4 runs in the 2nd.  It could potentially be a problem if that was a sign we weren't getting many hits, but we are. We're still outhitting teams almost every win. We have the 12th most hits in the league and the 8th most runs."
minnesotatwins,379u4g,McRawffles,1 point,Tue May 26 04:44:48 2015 UTC,"It will only become a problem when they get rally'd mid-game and can't recover. For now, though, it doesn't seem to be an issue. Take yesterday for example: if you give your pitcher 7 runs to work with you should probably win the game."
minnesotatwins,379u4g,ajdragoon,2,Tue May 26 11:09:07 2015 UTC,"Another thing to note is that we're 3rd in scoring in the first 6 innings. I know that's heavily weighted towards the first three, but when the first few innings can get you ahead by that much... I'm not complaining."
minnesotatwins,379u4g,DetectiveWoofles,2,Tue May 26 07:32:01 2015 UTC,"Before yesterday they gave up 4 runs in the first, the Sox average giving up .875 runs in the first and average scoring .215 in the first.  It could be worse. Today it is now worse."

Let's say that Joe Mauer has the highest batting average on the first Monday following the full moon in even-numbered years (he might not...I just made it up, but let's say he does). Does that mean that the numbering of the year and the status of the moon actually affect his ability to bat? Almost certainly not...it's just by dumb luck. Similarly, the Twins batting skills probably aren't affected by what inning it is. Unless you can propose a specific, measurable cause for this, we would just ascribe it to random chance."

minnesotatwins,378215,7Finger,6,Mon May 25 20:48:21 2015 UTC,You know Perkins can't hold his lead in saves if we keep winning by this much.

minnesotatwins,378215,DetectiveWoofles,10,Mon May 25 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"Joe Kelly pitching for the Red Sox. 5-pitch pitcher. Kelly has both a four-seamer and sinker that can get up to 98mph, those two pitches combine for almost 70% of his usage. He also mixes in a slider (14%) and change (5%), both around 84-88mph, and then a knuckle curveball at 78-82mph (used 11%).  The change is almost exclusive to LHH, and the slider is thrown to RHH a lot more. Kelly will be pretty relentless in throwing that sinker early in the count and when he falls behind, you'll see the slider a lot more when he has two strikes on a hitter. Slider is the swing-and-miss pitch at 22% whiff, second highest is the change-up at 13% whiff. Out of his 43 strikeouts this year, 18 have come from the slider, and 15 from his sinker.  On the year, Kelly is 1-3 with a 5.13 ERA (4.25 FIP), 43 strikeouts to 19 walks in 47.1 IP. His WHIP has been consistently high in the majors, this season at 1.310, career is 1.356. He had a real bad stretch earlier this year, but his last two starts have been a bit better - 6.1 IP, 5 H, 1 R @ SEA and 7 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 7 K vs. TEX.  Only one Twins batter in the lineup has experience vs. Joe Kelly, that's Kurt Suzuki – 0 for 4, with a strikeout."

minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Mon May 25 19:32:11 2015 UTC,So close....
minnesotatwins,378215,FlannelBeard,4,Mon May 25 19:32:43 2015 UTC,So close.
minnesotatwins,378215,DetectiveWoofles,5,Mon May 25 19:32:46 2015 UTC,Close.
minnesotatwins,378215,Tannekr,4,Mon May 25 19:33:10 2015 UTC,Even with a lead like this it would be nice to bring the guy home from third.
minnesotatwins,378215,guiltycitizen,5,Mon May 25 19:35:36 2015 UTC,Good to see Nolasco settled down
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Mon May 25 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"Sweet, Tigers and Athletics on ESPN at 3. I want the Tigers deep in 3rd place. DEEP"
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Mon May 25 19:45:56 2015 UTC,"Hicks Homer! Another call.   Edit: Oh well, solid contact hicks"
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Mon May 25 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"Nolasco had one bad inning, but otherwise he's looked pretty good today"
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Mon May 25 20:09:22 2015 UTC,He actually has. Earning a lower ERA today.
minnesotatwins,378215,Jorgenstern8,5,Mon May 25 20:09:45 2015 UTC,Holy christ. This is the first time this season Nolasco made it through 6. And on 84 pitches.
minnesotatwins,378215,FlannelBeard,4,Mon May 25 20:12:11 2015 UTC,Damn that's the first time Ricky completed 6 innings this year? I hope he remembers how good it feels!
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Mon May 25 20:12:12 2015 UTC,"You know what I haven't heard from the Twins' staff/players in a long time? ""The ball came out of his hand real good."" I think that was a Gardy thing though."
minnesotatwins,378215,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,4,Mon May 25 20:17:43 2015 UTC,"Huh, watching the Red Sox feed, the angle it appeared there was no tag whatsoever.  Red Sox announcers said ""I didn't see a tag""."
minnesotatwins,378215,CentralAmerican,4,Mon May 25 20:24:59 2015 UTC,The Twins feed showed an angle where you can see the glove brush Suzuki's knee.
minnesotatwins,378215,Tannekr,5,Mon May 25 20:29:57 2015 UTC,Lol that works Plouffe
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Mon May 25 20:27:03 2015 UTC,That too.
minnesotatwins,378215,DetectiveWoofles,3,Mon May 25 20:27:39 2015 UTC,ooop... I nodded off there for a while.  Yay for three day weekends.  Yay for solid outings from Nalasco too!
minnesotatwins,378215,onceamennonite,4,Mon May 25 20:30:36 2015 UTC,What has happened to our pitchers lately? That's 4 straight starts of 7+ innings.
minnesotatwins,378215,DetectiveWoofles,4,Mon May 25 20:32:27 2015 UTC,"Hicks with a single, means batters 4-9 all have at least two hits. 1-3 only have one hit each."
minnesotatwins,378215,ChiefakaJames,4,Mon May 25 20:36:06 2015 UTC,Prince Fielder is hitting .362 with like 11 homers or something like that. Glad he's not with Detroit anymore.   Edit: Prince has 9 homers
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,5,Mon May 25 20:41:12 2015 UTC,Detroit seems to be doing fine without him.  At least against the Twins.  They just always seem to have our number.
minnesotatwins,378215,AdaAstra,4,Mon May 25 20:42:54 2015 UTC,Great outing for Nolasco. Congrats on (hopefully) 100.
minnesotatwins,378215,DetectiveWoofles,4,Mon May 25 20:43:56 2015 UTC,Good work Nolasco. Hope this is a sign of what we can get out of you for the next 2.75 years.
minnesotatwins,378215,Derk-Derks,5,Mon May 25 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes. Keep up those long at bats. Tire out this bullpen!"
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Mon May 25 20:51:33 2015 UTC,How about a 2 homer game for America Plouffe
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Mon May 25 20:53:17 2015 UTC,Twins SP ERA is now at 4.02 for the season.  Nice.

minnesotatwins,378215,Derk-Derks,6,Mon May 25 20:56:27 2015 UTC,4.02-ish or nice-ish?
minnesotatwins,378215,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,4,Mon May 25 20:57:11 2015 UTC,Nice-ish.

minnesotatwins,378215,DetectiveWoofles,4,Mon May 25 21:05:15 2015 UTC,Red Sox feed had a really good shot of the Mauer-Plouffe beard stroke.
minnesotatwins,378215,ChiefakaJames,5,Mon May 25 21:05:56 2015 UTC,Good game  Hummm  Indeed  Quite  Yes
minnesotatwins,378215,novafire08,4,Mon May 25 21:08:16 2015 UTC,TWINS WIN. On to ESPN to watch the Tigers lose. I might see if /r/Oaklandathletics will let me chill with them in their thread. Good game boys!
minnesotatwins,378215,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,6,Mon May 25 21:06:07 2015 UTC,This is unreal

minnesotatwins,378215,guiltycitizen,5,Mon May 25 22:26:40 2015 UTC,"Dude, what the hell. 6.5 average runs scored per game started by Nolasco.  That's insane."
minnesotatwins,378215,Tannekr,9,Mon May 25 19:15:00 2015 UTC,They realize they're gonna need em all.
minnesotatwins,378215,OrbitsUnbounded,5,Mon May 25 19:16:08 2015 UTC,"Crap. If this team keeps winning, I'm going to have to care about them way more than I originally planned to this summer. I can't afford that right now. I'm so conflicted but I love it!"
minnesotatwins,378215,knightlock15,4,Mon May 25 21:06:28 2015 UTC,"I know, right? If they keep this up until and after the All-Star break I don't know what I'd do aside from getting my hopes up well before I should."
minnesotatwins,378215,Shade_SST,3,Tue May 26 02:14:43 2015 UTC,WE GOT ORTIZ OUT!
minnesotatwins,378215,DetectiveWoofles,3,Mon May 25 18:16:26 2015 UTC,Hell of a job by Dozier getting that ball thrown with authority while being slid into.
minnesotatwins,378215,Rosie_Cotton_dancing,3,Mon May 25 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"As grams always said, nothing like a good DP to get the party started."

minnesotatwins,377t5p,dannygopher,9,Mon May 25 16:14:46 2015 UTC,Also 41 strikeouts. He needs to be up here if you ask me.
minnesotatwins,377t5p,RichardManuel,3,Mon May 25 16:17:46 2015 UTC,As a 6th starter?
minnesotatwins,377t5p,RichardManuel,4,Mon May 25 16:23:47 2015 UTC,Fit him in somewhere. Stash him in the pen until a starter has a bad game if you have to.
minnesotatwins,377t5p,FrankReynolds,10,Mon May 25 17:17:48 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be great if we could slot him into a starting position, but the absolute worst thing that the organization could do to Milone right now would be to sit him in the bullpen until he gets a couple innings work.  We'll definitely have need for another starter at some point this season, whether due to injury or poor performance.  Milone should keep getting AAA starts until then."
minnesotatwins,377t5p,BobLobLawsLawFirm,1 point,Mon May 25 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"Get rid of Pelfrey, his advanced stats are awful."
minnesotatwins,377t5p,kgthdc2468,11,Mon May 25 19:21:44 2015 UTC,Keep riding Pelfrey unless he starts getting shelled. No need to punish him if he's getting the job done.
minnesotatwins,377t5p,taffyowner,2,Mon May 25 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"advanced stats dont matter if he keeps winning ball games, advanced stats are nice but they dont matter until we see them matter"
minnesotatwins,377t5p,BobLobLawsLawFirm,2,Tue May 26 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"I'm saying if you were to call up Malone now and have to get rid of one pitcher I would pick Pelfrey, because his advanced stats are showing a regression is near. Don't get me wrong, I like that his outings are producing wins, I just think he should be the first to go if needed."
minnesotatwins,377t5p,Heyitscharlie,3,Tue May 26 04:21:02 2015 UTC,"Berardino has been saying for months that Milone is too good for AAA but is just not a major league player, if only there were a AAAA where we could stash guys like Colabello and Milone."
minnesotatwins,377t5p,JustPassing_Thru,3,Mon May 25 23:29:39 2015 UTC,Parmelee is the name that always comes to mind whenever someone brings up AAAA ball
minnesotatwins,377t5p,59179,1 point,Wed May 27 14:33:23 2015 UTC,What is going to happen when Santana's suspension is over?
minnesotatwins,377t5p,RobertService,1 point,Tue May 26 18:27:33 2015 UTC,That's exactly where he belongs.
minnesotatwins,377t5p,ignitionNOW,1 point,Mon May 25 19:49:56 2015 UTC,Agree. Does anyone think he'd be doing nearly that well in the majors? Look at Hicks.  I'm glad he's doing well but he's a AAAA guy. Milk that option for all its worth. Everyone's pitching well right now so no need to recall him.
minnesotatwins,377t5p,hail_termite_queen,6,Mon May 25 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"...he's not. His career ERA is 4. His only full season was 3.74 in 2012, he had a 3.55 ERA in 95 innings in Oakland before coming over here and pitching hurt last year. He has #3 potential, or is a very good #4.  He is a major league pitcher and has a lot of value."
minnesotatwins,377t5p,ignitionNOW,1 point,Tue May 26 00:56:19 2015 UTC,I guess we'll ignore park factor. Seriously look at his home/road splits. Nearly a run of ERA. He's a fly ball pitcher and did ok at O.Co but is exposed in almost every other park.
minnesotatwins,377t5p,hail_termite_queen,1 point,Tue May 26 05:05:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely a solid point- his splits in Oakland agree with you. Although he's absolutely dominating Rochester, so you still have to give him a shot to see if he can pitch well up here."
minnesotatwins,377t5p,taffyowner,2,Tue May 26 17:56:24 2015 UTC,Hicks is doing fine
minnesotatwins,377t5p,bpmsu,1 point,Tue May 26 14:05:35 2015 UTC,Yep. He's got a AAA fastball
minnesotatwins,374qxe,Cheeky_Guy,48,Sun May 24 21:32:27 2015 UTC,And eat shit and die Chicago White Sox.   And to think we have Buxton And Sano still in the minors waiting to be unleashed.  We have Santana still in suspension but just imagine if he's amazing.  Twins are building an army

minnesotatwins,374qxe,CantaloupeCamper,2,Mon May 25 01:30:37 2015 UTC,Why can't he play in the playoffs?
minnesotatwins,374qxe,salty_john,5,Mon May 25 01:48:32 2015 UTC,"His suspension excludes him from the playoffs.  Dumb, but that's the rule."
minnesotatwins,374qxe,CantaloupeCamper,2,Mon May 25 02:14:41 2015 UTC,I feel stupid not knowing that. Goshhhhh that's dumb
minnesotatwins,374qxe,DoubleOhFour,1 point,Mon May 25 04:11:14 2015 UTC,It's a dumb rule.  I'm not sure anyone would think that once your suspension is over .... you'd get more... but only if you make the playoffs.
minnesotatwins,374qxe,CantaloupeCamper,2,Mon May 25 04:15:47 2015 UTC,well that fucking blows
minnesotatwins,374qxe,cstew79,2,Mon May 25 15:49:43 2015 UTC,that's an insanely stupid rule.
minnesotatwins,374qxe,shiftyskies,1 point,Mon May 25 17:32:16 2015 UTC,The suspension bars him from it
minnesotatwins,374qxe,Lager17,1 point,Mon May 25 02:10:29 2015 UTC,Doesn't mean he can't help us get there.
minnesotatwins,374qxe,BilalElG,5,Mon May 25 01:40:36 2015 UTC,"I don't even care that we're 2-7 against Detroit, being 7-3 against Chicago is more important.  Although me having lived in Chicago for a bit might have created bias in my reasoning."

minnesotatwins,374qxe,myballsareitchy,3,Mon May 25 05:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, unfortunately."
minnesotatwins,374qxe,Kruse,1 point,Mon May 25 05:20:55 2015 UTC,Can you please explain? I thought they just had to be on the 40 man by a certain date.
minnesotatwins,374qxe,dabecka,1 point,Mon May 25 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, new rules implemented in 2014 mean that a suspension makes you ineligible for post-season play."

minnesotatwins,374qxe,PigFarmington,11,Mon May 25 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"Then you haven't met a lot of Sox fans...  I know, I know. Everyone you know is a Sox fan."
minnesotatwins,374qxe,inyourface_milwaukee,7,Mon May 25 02:42:17 2015 UTC,I'm not an accurate representation of the twins

minnesotatwins,374qxe,BrianDoziersHair,11,Mon May 25 03:45:49 2015 UTC,"The pitching has finally caught up to the offense, and the defense is much improved with Arcia down in the minors.  With more pitching help coming in July, I like this teams chances to compete the entire season.  If we can get some offense out of Mauer, this team will continue to surprise!"
minnesotatwins,374qxe,serentify,8,Sun May 24 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"And you know what? Mauer hasn't been bad. He's actually driving in runs. A .275 average, while still extremely sub-par for him is decent. I don't think there's a lot to complain about there."

minnesotatwins,374qxe,BrianDoziersHair,7,Mon May 25 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in seeing what our strength of schedule has been up to this point.   We did have 4 vs. the A's who are terrible, but over a third of our games so far have been vs. KC or DET, and we took 2/3 from the Rays who are tops in the East.   We took the series vs. SEA and swept a 2-game at PIT, and the rest have come vs. CLE /CHI and we're 11-5 in those games.   We seem to be taking care of business when it comes to the lower half of the league, we just need to keep trucking and not shit the bed against the Kitties anymore."
minnesotatwins,374qxe,tokomini,5,Sun May 24 23:37:43 2015 UTC,"3rd. http://i.imgur.com/w1Q8OUX.png   And then 4th (behind Detroit, KC, and St. Louis) in ESPN's ""Relative Power Index"" which is: ""The basic formula is 25% team winning percentage, 50% opponents' average winning percentage, and 25% opponents' opponents' average winning percentage."""

minnesotatwins,374qxe,SailTheWorldWithMe,3,Mon May 25 02:47:11 2015 UTC,Where are the two big doubters (Im not even going to say their names anymore) saying we should just gut the team and retract them because they will never be good anyways?
minnesotatwins,374qxe,inyourface_milwaukee,3,Mon May 25 04:28:01 2015 UTC,"Can we team up to beat the shit out of the rest of the division? Find a way to tie with us, IDGAF, as long as the Kitties are resting at 3rd or lower."
minnesotatwins,374qxe,Akuze25,2,Mon May 25 05:45:40 2015 UTC,Feels good!
minnesotatwins,374qxe,taksark,2,Mon May 25 00:44:39 2015 UTC,I count 3rd in the AL. Behind KC and Houston (Houston wtf?) but ahead of Tampa.
minnesotatwins,374qxe,eric1743,3,Mon May 25 04:31:08 2015 UTC,Still can't figure out how this team is putting it together. The Detroit series seem to be turning points.
minnesotatwins,374qxe,StnkBy,3,Mon May 25 01:13:06 2015 UTC,The thing that sabermetrics doesnt account for: Clubhouse Chemistry. Bringing Torii back is exactly what this team needed.

minnesotatwins,374yb7,Pineapple__Jews,1 point,Sun May 24 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"I think the ""meh"" seasons were partially because he was still way below the average age for his level.  People got spoiled by Trout and Harper but even top prospects usually don't make the majors until they're 22-24."

minnesotatwins,373x5s,mnsportsgeek,13,Sun May 24 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"Hahaha - I haven't seen/heard a White Sox broadcast in ages.  As soon as I got audio hooked up first thing I heard was ""No .... no, no, no, no"" from Hawk"
minnesotatwins,373x5s,onceamennonite,3,Sun May 24 19:14:41 2015 UTC,Remember the broadcast a couple years back when Hawk straight up left the game because the Twins were destroying the White Sox by like 10 runs?  Love it.

minnesotatwins,373x5s,Tannekr,9,Sun May 24 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"At this point, you have to give a lot of credit to pitching coach Neil Allen because virtually the whole staff has made strides. It's been so gratifying to see Gibson, May and Palfrey step it up this year. I know it's a long year and some of these guys might start falling apart as fatigue or injuries occur, but point remains."
minnesotatwins,373x5s,imissedthetoilet,6,Sun May 24 18:15:54 2015 UTC,"The whole team in general.  We are playing better at hitting, pitching, and defense.  Not only that, we are getting better at transitioning to the bull pen later instead of having to have them bail out our starters after the 4-5th inning like we seemed to do every couple of games last year.   It is refreshing to go into a game wondering if we are going to win now, instead of the last few seasons where we were just happy if we didn't get blown out by like 5+ runs."
minnesotatwins,373x5s,AdaAstra,3,Sun May 24 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"I mean I love Gardy but this team really did need a coaching overhaul, especially the pitching coach. Its awesome to see them do well so far. I was iffy in Molitor but he is doing ok so far, my judge and jury is still out on him."
minnesotatwins,373x5s,inyourface_milwaukee,2,Sun May 24 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"I think just by looking at the coaches Molly brought in, hes doing a great job."
minnesotatwins,373x5s,FlannelBeard,2,Sun May 24 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"I would say that his in-game decisions have been a breath of fresh air compared to Gardy. It's nice to see the Twins enter the 21st century and use ""revolutionary"" techniques like shifts and platooning batters."

minnesotatwins,373x5s,imissedthetoilet,7,Sun May 24 20:05:13 2015 UTC,I wish the Twins could go 18-0 against the Sox one year just to see how quiet Hawk would be when we would play them.

minnesotatwins,373x5s,DetectiveWoofles,8,Sun May 24 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"Jose Quintana for the White Sox. 4-pitch pitcher. Four-seamer and sinker stay around 89-93mph with some nice movement on the sinker. Those two pitches combine for 62% of his usage. He also has a slow curve from 78-81mph used 26%, then finally a changeup at 84-88mph used 11%.  The change is hardly ever thrown against LHH, but they do see more of the curveball. You'll see the curve a lot when he's ahead of hitters and when he has two strikes, other than that it's a lot of fastball/sinker to get ahead.  No real swing-and-miss pitches, with the offspeed pitches getting 11.3% whiff on the change, and 10.7% whiff on the curve. People have been hammering the change this year, hitting .381 and slugging .762.  Quintana has one start vs. the Twins this year, going 7 IP, giving up 6 H, 1 R, and striking out 5. On the year, Jose is 2-4 with a 4.13 ERA (3.28 FIP), 43 strikeouts to 14 walks in 48 IP.  Twins lineup vs. Quintana -   Dozier: 5 for 28, 1 double, 1 HR, 3 BB, 7 K  Robinson: 1 for 5, 1 K  Mauer: 9 for 23, 2 HR, 2 BB, 4 K  Plouffe: 3 for 14, 1 double, 5 BB, 3 K  Hunter: 10 for 26, 6 K  Escobar: 1 for 12, 5 K  Herrmann: Never faced  Rosario: Never faced  Hicks: 0 for 5, 2 K"

minnesotatwins,373x5s,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sun May 24 18:58:00 2015 UTC,"You think there's any way we promote him just from sheer dominance down there? Guy's playing angry and was pretty good in the majors so far this year. I just can't think we'd move anyone in the rotation now, but Duensing has been...ick."
minnesotatwins,373x5s,Derk-Derks,3,Sun May 24 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that he shouldn't be moved back into the rotation right now, the issue with Duensing is he'd have to be DFA'd rather than just sent down (or another ""DL"" stint to figure it out).   I'd be okay with cutting ties with Duensing at this point - 7th year, quality is going down - but I don't see the organization doing that."
minnesotatwins,373x5s,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun May 24 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"I think something needs to happen with Duensing soon sadly. He'd been with us forever now, but seems like the ship may have sailed. I was already against signing him in arbitration but he's gotta be hurt or just plain bad now. Sucks to see, but I really want to give Milone another shot somewhere, he is just plain dealing."

minnesotatwins,373x5s,AdaAstra,2,Sun May 24 20:52:57 2015 UTC,He was a light in a time of darkness
minnesotatwins,373x5s,DoubleOhFour,4,Sun May 24 22:14:42 2015 UTC,Gibson absolutely destroys the Sox.

minnesotatwins,373x5s,onceamennonite,4,Sun May 24 20:37:47 2015 UTC,Two. He went 0 for 4 in the opening game of this Chicago series.
minnesotatwins,373x5s,ChiefakaJames,2,Sun May 24 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, thanks.  Seems like he's always producing, but I didn't see that game."
minnesotatwins,373x5s,onceamennonite,2,Sun May 24 20:42:55 2015 UTC,"Before that it was like 10, right?"
minnesotatwins,373x5s,DetectiveWoofles,2,Sun May 24 20:42:55 2015 UTC,"Game before he went 0 for 5 in Pitt... but before THAT it was 10 games, yes."

minnesotatwins,3724r5,gopherman23,6,Sun May 24 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"With his speed, Buxton could turn an ordinary double to right field into a triple any day of the week. It's hard to imagine him putting up the same kind of numbers in AAA or the majors, but he has the potential to be an All star, or even MVP. It would be nice if Hunter could teach him to make ridiculous outfield plays, too. Definitely an exciting player."
minnesotatwins,3724r5,Kripzo,4,Sun May 24 03:58:25 2015 UTC,Buxton can already make ridiculous outfield plays!

minnesotatwins,3724r5,OrbitsUnbounded,3,Sun May 24 15:23:40 2015 UTC,He's not even the best player (currently) on the stacked AA team.
minnesotatwins,3724r5,imissedthetoilet,2,Mon May 25 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"It's still a little early.....he barely played last year and the rust seemed pretty evident. I think he was batting less than .200 the first month of the year, but he seems to be picking it up.....I assume he may get called up to AAA soon if he keeps up his current production. I would think the Twins would probably seriously think calling him up after the All-Star Break. Likely around August. Of course, the production of Robinson, Hicks, and Schafer may play a factor too."
minnesotatwins,3724r5,imissedthetoilet,2,Sun May 24 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"In addition, it looks like Sano is starting to knock-off the rust as well. His avg. is up to .250 now after being below .200 for much of the season. Already 8 homers."
minnesotatwins,3724r5,themoundie,1 point,Sun May 24 18:31:04 2015 UTC,All good points. He's struck out quite a bit so far this year too. No rush to call him up really. It would be nice to see him sustain his May numbers for awhile after being off for so much of last year.  Very promising though!
minnesotatwins,3724r5,DaDoviende,2,Sun May 24 21:33:15 2015 UTC,Should probably prove he can hit better than .270 in AA

minnesotatwins,370li0,onceamennonite,6,Sun May 24 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"Chris Sale on the mound for the White Sox. 4-pitch pitcher. Four-seamer at 93-97mph that's used 42% of the time, sinker at 91-95mph that's used 16%, circle change at 84-88mph used 30% of the time, and a slider at 78-82mph that's used 10%.  He uses all four vs. RHH and LHH, but you'll see the slider more frequently vs. lefties when he's ahead and with two strikes. He loves throwing both the fastball and sinker early to get ahead. The fastball, circle change, and slider are good swing-and-miss pitches with 17.5% whiff, 14.22%, and 16.22% respectively. The pitch to hit is his slider (.385 BA and .539 SLG against it this season).  Chris Sale has faced with Twins twice already this season, his first start of the season going 6 IP, giving up 5 H and 1 R (1 BB to 8 K). His second start didn't go as well - Twins got to him in 3 IP, getting 9 hits and 9 runs (8 earned), and he walked two in that short start.  On the year, Sale is 3-1, 4.36 ERA (3.27 FIP), with 44 K to 13 BB in 43.1 IP. His WHIP is currently at the highest of his career at 1.246 (last season, he kept it under 1 over a full year).  Twins lineup vs. Sale -  Dozier: 7 for 25, 1 double, 3 HR, 1 BB, 7 K  Robinson: 1 for 4  Plouffe: 8 for 27, 1 double, 2 BB, 9 K  Hunter: 9 for 33, 2 doubles, 1 triple, 1 HR, 1 BB, 10 K  Suzuki: 5 for 14, 1 double, 2 BB, 2 K  Escobar: 4 for 12, 1 double, 3 K  Nunez: 2 for 12, 2 doubles, 2 K  Hicks: 2 for 3, 1 double, 1 K  Santana: 3 for 13, 1 double, 3 K"

The four-seamer, sinker, and cutter are all around 93-97 mph, and take up a lot of his frequency (67%). His other two pitches that he mixes in are similar in speed at 83-87 mph, the slider (used 23%), and a splitter (used 9%).  The splitter is primarily for LHH, and is really only used as a two-strike pitch. He also loves to go first pitch sinker to RHH (40%). The sinker is the pitch to hit, as players have hit .370 against it thus far, slugging .593 as well. Samardzija has had a surprisingly low whiff% this season, his highest being the four-seamer at 12.58% whiff, and cutter at 12.06%. His splitter prior to the season was the big swing-and-miss pitch at 23% whiff, but batters have had an easier time with it at just over 10%.  On the year, Samardzija is 3-2 with a 4.58 ERA (4.07 FIP), 40 strikeouts to 11 walks in 53 IP. His current 6.8 K/9 is his lowest since 2010, and his WHIP of 1.358 is his highest also since 2010 (he only pitched 19 innings that year).

minnesotatwins,36zlav,CentralAmerican,5,Sat May 23 15:14:21 2015 UTC,I think we all knew that.   We're getting stuff like 8 runs on 8 hits and we all know what much of the pitching talent's longer term track record has been.  But this luck has been fun to watch.
minnesotatwins,36zlav,CantaloupeCamper,11,Sat May 23 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"Our guys get clutch hits with guys on base.  There might be some luck to it, but it takes skill to get hits when your team has runners in scoring position."
minnesotatwins,36zlav,carat135,6,Sat May 23 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"All of the statistical evidence available suggests ""clutch"" isn't a thing."
minnesotatwins,36zlav,obsidianop,4,Sat May 23 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"Well clutch hitting is a thing. It just isn't an ability, if you will, that can be used as a prediction of future events. Basically, you can get clutch hits, but you can't really be a clutch hitter.  The Twins have gotten a lot of clutch hits so far this year. They should not, however, be expected to hit that way for the whole rest of the year. They may end up continuing to hit better with RISP than overall, but they probably won't and it shouldn't be counted on.   So it is a thing. It just is mostly based on luck, not ability."
minnesotatwins,36zlav,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 23 23:08:24 2015 UTC,"Serious question... do you play any sports that require a form of ""clutch"" hitting? Because even in recreational sports, there is some pressure being in a position to perform above your average when in a high pressure situation (eg runners in scoring position). I only ask since you say ""clutch hitting"" isn't an ability, but to me some people are definitely better at succeeding in those situations than others."
minnesotatwins,36zlav,PancakesHouse,3,Sun May 24 01:26:03 2015 UTC,"Right. They may be better at succeeding in those situations than others would be in that same situation. But that isn't the comparison I'm making. The comparison I'm making is between a person in a normal situation vs. that same person in a ""clutch"" situation. Over any decent sample size, the results will be the same or worse in the clutch situation than in any other situation. Very, very few people are better with more pressure than they are without it.  Here is what Bill James said about clutch hitting: ""How is it that a player who possesses the reflexes and the batting stroke and the knowledge and the experience to be a .262 hitter in other circumstances magically becomes a .300 hitter when the game is on the line? How does that happen? What is the process? What are the effects? Until we can answer those questions, I see little point in talking about clutch ability.""  Basically, if they have the ability to hit well in clutch situations, why couldn't they do the same earlier in a game with the bases empty?"
minnesotatwins,36zlav,tennisspears,3,Sun May 24 02:16:10 2015 UTC,Clutch hits exist.  Clutch as a skill you can wield as a player .... statistically proven to be not a thing.
minnesotatwins,36zlav,CantaloupeCamper,1 point,Sun May 24 02:40:51 2015 UTC,"I've always felt ""clutch"" is the ability to not suffer a decrease in ability under pressure rather than the ability to increase your ability.  An ""unclutch"" pitcher is probably going to try and nibble the corners more, resulting in bad counts that make him more nervous, meaning he'll throw some meatballs and get pounded.  Similarly, an ""unclutch"" hitter will probably expand the strike zone or shorten his swing (to increase contact at the cost of power) resulting in weak balls in play or strikeouts.  I think the myth of a clutch player performing better is just fueled by their opponents skills lowering which, yes, would cause an increase in their stats.  But I would also absolutely call it an ability and not just luck (as long as you have a big enough sample size)."

minnesotatwins,36zlav,lion_in_a_coma,0,Sun May 24 04:12:35 2015 UTC,Odd bouncing balls or errors I would count more toward luck then bunching hits together I would think.
minnesotatwins,36wwrl,Cornholio4,3,Fri May 22 20:07:10 2015 UTC,"Hopefully he can get some confidence back and be back in the rotation soon. He's struggled, but he has too much of a track record of success in the high minors to give up on him starting now."

minnesotatwins,36wwrl,Chocobo812,2,Sat May 23 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"Are we looking at the same numbers. Besides this year, last year was his career high ERA with 3.52. He has a career K/9 rate over 10, his walk rate is high, but that's been his problem. He's been wild before, but not like this. I think he's just too much in his head right now, and maybe a change of scenery (move to the bullpen) might do him some good. Plenty of guys have started their careers in the Majors in the bullpen only to be converted to starters. Johan Santana and Chris Sale comes to mind immediately."

minnesotatwins,36x61j,MinnesotaSportsFan,3,Fri May 22 23:44:39 2015 UTC,"Well the team has been a bit lucky because the stats say the record should be a few games below .500 rather than a few over, except that the team has bunched hits together and spread opponent runs better than most other teams. Historically you cannot control that over the course of the season, hence luck. I hope it sticks around but I think by seasons end things will even out. Fortunately, these wins count just as much so I'll take the luck while we can get it."
minnesotatwins,36x61j,The_Effing_Eagle,1 point,Sat May 23 02:34:31 2015 UTC,So we are almost 50 games in. When do we hit the luck barrier you people seem to think exists.
minnesotatwins,36x61j,vagrantwade,1 point,Mon May 25 07:29:00 2015 UTC,"Well it isn't really possible to predict luck (or change it). It's essentially random variation around a predicted outcome. The teams offensive and pitching statistics suggest that the team should be a few games below .500, but because they've bunched their hits together and spread opponent hits apart, they've scored more runs and allowed fewer runs than projected. Historically, teams cannot control the clustering of runs, so it is likely that luck will swing back the other way. I hope it doesn't though. Teams can also have lucky (or unlucky) seasons, but based on historical trends, it is more likely that the Twins will face some unlucky stretches before the season ends. Again, I would prefer that they continue to win, and every win they get now still counts at the end of the season, but I also am trying to be cautious in my optimism.."
minnesotatwins,36x61j,The_Effing_Eagle,-12,Mon May 25 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"They are the luckiest team I've ever seen. When the luck evens out, they will still lose 90."
minnesotatwins,36x61j,RobertService,12,Fri May 22 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the need to point this out at every possible moment. They are clearly getting lucky. They probably will lose a lot more games down the stretch. But right now the team is winning. And winning is fun. I promise it's more fun than being smarter than everyone else. So feel free to be a contrarian asshole as much as you want, but most of us are going to enjoy the winning while it lasts."

At this point he thinks he is the dark knight we need to swoop and and squash any optimism that takes us beyond what was projected for the Twins this year, instead of just sucking out everything positive about being a baseball fan out of this sub.  I do my fair share of responding to this guy and the other negative Nancy, but they are not really Twins fans. We may as well ignore them."

All the autograph lines are free and whatever you get signed is authenticated and registered by an MLB repon the spot for free. I got baseballs that I had from batting practice. Also, if they have pin trading this year that is hella worth it. Bring any licensed mlb lapel pin and mlb employees have to trade you for asg pins and there are some very rare and very valuable ones walking around. I bought a bunch for twenty bucks from a booth and ended up trading for one with a Swarovski crystal in it, one that was vip press only, both the gold and sivler asg logo and a 24kt gol Minnie and Paul.

They were giving away Bert faces on a stick for his HOF ceremony. 3 kids (15-16 years old Brewers fans) walk in and I hand one of em the face on a stick. The kid walks 5 feet and then tosses it to the ground trying to act like a bad ass in front of his buddies. I had a pretty large beard at the time, which may or may not have look semi intimidating. When I saw the kid throw it on the ground I yell in the deepest voice I could ""HEY. PICK THAT UP"". Kid nearly shit his pants. Picked it up and scurried off...

Now, having said that, it doesn't give you the right to break into a locked car or vehicle, or destroy said property. And this was not the case, simply grabbed the ball and walked away. And honestly, what's the difference between using a net to grab the ball, and stepping onto the boat? You're still taking a baseball, that belongs to NOONE, (Maybe the Pirates, or MLB) other than the first person to grab it. If I were walking past,I would have done the same thing!"

Is a hall of fame player who is top 50 in on base percentage and top 50 in batting average not enough? Does every player have to hit for power to be worth a contract?"
minnesotatwins,36plj4,incredibleridiculous,0,Thu May 21 06:00:02 2015 UTC,How? Fangraphs says his career is worth 300 million. We got a bargain.
minnesotatwins,36plj4,mnsportsgeek,-2,Fri May 22 17:58:54 2015 UTC,The Pohlads are the richest owners in baseball. They can afford it.
minnesotatwins,36plj4,sexrobot_sexrobot,5,Thu May 21 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"They really aren't. Owner wealth is not associated with payroll.   However, your second statement is still true. Mauer's contract hasn't stopped the Twins from signing anyone worth signing who was also willing to come to MN at a reasonable to slightly above reasonable price."
minnesotatwins,36plj4,tennisspears,-1,Thu May 21 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"They either are or they aren't. The Pohlads are banking billionaires. Tell me which individual owner in baseball is richer?   On your number 2, owner wealth is very much associated with payroll. When the Griffiths owned the Twins this was their only business. They were cheap as hell but at least they had an excuse.  We've seen owners in smaller media markets than Minnesota invest much more heavily into their teams years after they've been gifted new stadiums. That's simply not the Twins' philosophy."
minnesotatwins,36plj4,sexrobot_sexrobot,1 point,Thu May 21 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"Not really the point, but whatever."
minnesotatwins,36plj4,newtizzle,1 point,Thu May 21 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why is he your favorite player?"
minnesotatwins,36plj4,Kruse,4,Thu May 21 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"I remember when he was drafted as a local guy and the promise of the future. He was a top prospect who became an MVP and the Twins disappointments in the playoffs aside, he represents an incredibly successful period of baseball for the franchise. That 2009 season was magical, and I don't really care how much money he gets paid, he was worth every penny when he was signed. He was the best catcher in baseball for a 5-6 year period, and perhaps the smoothest hitters I've ever seen personally. He also was a hell of a defensive catcher, who made some ridiculously athletic plays behind the plate."
minnesotatwins,36plj4,Garrus,1 point,Thu May 21 17:08:00 2015 UTC,He doesn't have anything to prove. 3 batting titles and an MVP is plenty.
minnesotatwins,36plj4,mnsportsgeek,6,Fri May 22 17:57:54 2015 UTC,And to right center. It's clutch for sure

minnesotatwins,36olaw,ChiefakaJames,2,Thu May 21 03:08:00 2015 UTC,"Jeff Locke (not the Vikings punter) pitching for Pittsburgh. 3-pitch left-handed pitcher. Sinker at 90-93 mph (59%), curve at 77-80 mph (17%), and a circle-change at 79-82 mph that he only throws to righties (still 23% of total usage).  Lefties have it pretty easy, seeing only the sinker (70%) and curve (30%). Right-handers have a tougher route with the changeup – his only swing-and-miss pitch, 22.22% whiff – he also has a great two strike split to RHH, throwing the sinker 46%, curve 29%, and change 23%.  His sinker is extremely hittable, with only a 3.6% whiff rate, while being by far the most used pitch. Batters are hitting .298 against it this year while slugging .500.  On the year, Locke is 2-2 with a 5.40 ERA (4.39 FIP), 30 strikeouts and 14 walks in 40 IP. His WHIP is up to 1.45 now, including 15 XBH out of his 44 hits given up. He's had both solid starts (8 IP, 4 H, 1 R vs. MIL and 6.2 IP, 5 H, 3 R vs. CIN) and bad ones (3.2 IP, 8 H, 6 R and 3.2 IP, 6 H, 5 R both vs. CHC) so far this season.  Torii Hunter and Shane Robinson have the only experience vs. Locke – Torii is 1 for 2 with a double and a walk. Shane is 0 for 6 with two strikeouts."

minnesotatwins,36jai0,FlyingScissor,2,Tue May 19 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's because the farm hasn't been very strong above low-A ball until the last year or if TR is changing his philosophy (maybe someone has examples from the Mauer/Morneau/Kubel farm era), but I'm liking this trend: Jorge Polanco getting a taste of the bigs last year, Buxton and Berrios advancing through 2 levels in a year in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and Berrios getting a AAA start last year and now Hu getting a spot start two levels up. Really wouldn't surprise me to see Berrios and Polanco get call ups from AA in a pinch and get a chance to stick around. Not that that's rare for the Twins to do, but I like the message they're sending to these minor leaguers. Anything is possible, perform and you just might get an unexpected opportunity.   Now just can't wait for Hu to go to AA and open up a spot for Gonsalves at Fort Myers!"

Pitchers though well sometimes move around just to get starts in.  I feel like their level they're at at any one point matters a bit less sometimes.  Having said that TR when he took over a while back was asked about where their pitching talent was and he outright said they had jack squat above A ball, so probably we've got a crop maturing."

minnesotatwins,36jai0,Aluminum_Love_Cradle,4,Wed May 20 16:04:41 2015 UTC,How and why you present certain facts can certainly reflect an opinion and/or a pessimistic attitude about everything
minnesotatwins,36jai0,HughManatee,2,Wed May 20 18:30:05 2015 UTC,But it is good to see a second wave of talent developing. Meyer and Berrios will get their shots this year or next and cap off the wave that also included May and maybe Gibson. After that we can now add Hu to the next wave with Khol Stewart and Felix Jorge and maybe some other guys I don't know about yet.

minnesotatwins,36egaz,CantaloupeCamper,3,Mon May 18 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that maybe the Marlins were a little quick to name him as their skipper, but their mistake could be another organization's gain. Redmond's experience was paid for by the Marlins and now some other organization could benefit from it. I just worry the Twins won't adequately consider taking advantage of this and finding room for him somewhere on the management team.   As to where exactly he could fit is something I'm struggling to come up with an answer for though. Maybe there's just no position for him at this time, but I hope the Twins are putting some serious thought into it."
minnesotatwins,36egaz,Shade_SST,1 point,Mon May 18 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"Oh I'd love to see the Twins pick him up here or there.  Also the Marlins, not a great job, he had to take it, top job, but whatever.  I'm of the mind that an MLB manager really doesn't matter THAT much.   He's just there to keep a long season tolerable and manage the personalities, but I think most of the time he's somewhere around the rarely playing utility guy's level of influence on Ws."
minnesotatwins,36egaz,CantaloupeCamper,5,Mon May 18 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that his firing wasn't really all that warranted given injuries and that he had shown improvement in the team record last year, so I'm inclined to think someone will likely give him a try. The firing reflects more on (go figure) Loria than Redmond."

minnesotatwins,36egaz,kamarainen,2,Mon May 18 23:47:35 2015 UTC,"It is to Redmond's monetary gain to remain unemployed for the next couple of years, and other organizations are unlikely to jump at the chance to sign him since they would have to give something to the marlins.  Some what of the same reason that Ozzie Guillen isn't being interviewed by anyone."

minnesotatwins,36awpm,y2jayjk,8,Sun May 17 22:00:15 2015 UTC,And hes struggled a bit recently. Hes a power hitter that hasnt been hitting with power.
minnesotatwins,36awpm,HughManatee,3,Sun May 17 23:26:30 2015 UTC,This makes me sad.  Couldn't we just release Duensing instead?
minnesotatwins,36awpm,NtGivinAFck,2,Mon May 18 00:31:52 2015 UTC,I would like that immensely.
minnesotatwins,36awpm,HughManatee,3,Mon May 18 00:45:31 2015 UTC,"Duensing has been awful this season, but its early. Hes been a solid bull pen guy for the past two years. We could at least trade him for a prospect when he get his act together, rather than lose out on any value he may have."
minnesotatwins,36awpm,guiltycitizen,3,Mon May 18 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"IMO, he shouldn't have ever been tendered a contract during the offseason.  His numbers are too mediocre for what he is getting paid."
minnesotatwins,36awpm,NuancedThinker,2,Mon May 18 22:56:10 2015 UTC,I like Kennys swing and how he spells his name. If he can come around and improve he's going to be hitting a lot of dongs.

minnesotatwins,36awpm,mostdope92,1 point,Mon May 18 04:40:13 2015 UTC,He'll be fine. This isn't a guy to give up on. Very similar to David Ortiz's young career as a Twin. Let him get some at bats in AAA and he'll come around. He's going to be a big time hitter for this team in the future.
minnesotatwins,36awpm,audiocranium,1 point,Mon May 18 13:42:53 2015 UTC,"He's had a solid month hitting for average but I think they just want to see more power. I don't think this will last long, just an easy way to get him some ABs and see if he can find that power stroke without having the pressure to produce in the majors."
minnesotatwins,36awpm,JakeIsWet,1 point,Mon May 18 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"Vargas was batting .375/.405/.575 with 2 home runs, 2 doubles, and 6 RBI in his 11 games in May. If anything, he's starting to turn it around and is getting demoted for it. Duensing is still here and my brain aches for it."

minnesotatwins,36a0d0,SplurgingSpurgeon,6,Sun May 17 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"Chris Archer for the Rays (was at the game yesterday, so didn't do one on Colome). 4 pitches for Archer - a 95-97 mph fourseamer (43%), a 95 mph sinker (12%), an 86-88 mph slider (37%), and an 85 mph circle change (7%).  The circle change is exclusive to LHH, so RHH only have to deal with the three. The problem is his slider and both fastballs are excellent. His slider has a 22.68% whiff percentage on the season, and just watch it on most of his Ks vs. the Yankees earlier this year: http://m.mlb.com/video/?content_id=112426783&c_id=mlb  He'll start most of his at bats with the fourseamer, and then throw that slider with 2 strikes 54% of the time, to both LHH & RHH. His most hittable pitch right now is the sinker, which he'll throw often earlier in the count.  On the season, Archer is 3-4 with a  2.59 ERA (2.62 FIP), 58 strikeouts to 15 walks in 48.2 IP. His WHIP is just over 1, and has given up only 8 XBH (3 of those coming in his first start of the season).

minnesotatwins,366lzx,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 16 18:45:41 2015 UTC,We were yesterday
minnesotatwins,366lzx,FlannelBeard,3,Sat May 16 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, they were yesterday. But they are still batting better this season with RISP (.292/.367/.429) than they are overall (.259/.311/.385). And yet I wouldn't have been surprised to see someone say ""Ugh, we never capitalize!"" if Santana had gotten out there. It has happened many times before, and it will happen many times again."
minnesotatwins,366lzx,tennisspears,2,Sat May 16 18:50:58 2015 UTC,We also sucked in previous years with RISP
minnesotatwins,366lzx,FlannelBeard,2,Sat May 16 18:57:51 2015 UTC,"2014: .250/.343/.388 with RISP, .254/.324/.389 overall  2013: .225/.304/.331 with RISP, .242/.312/.380 overall  2012: .252/.341/.367 with RISP, .260/.325/.390 overall  2011: .248/.319/.354 with RISP, .247/.306/.360 overall  2010: .285/.363/.417 with RISP, .273/.341/.422 overall  Not a whole lot of difference, other than in 2013."
minnesotatwins,366lzx,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 16 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"IIRC from PAs show, we had more opportunities with RISP last year than any other team, far and away"
minnesotatwins,366lzx,FlannelBeard,1 point,Sat May 16 19:12:43 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what that has to do with anything. I gave you rate stats.
minnesotatwins,366lzx,tennisspears,1 point,Sat May 16 19:16:56 2015 UTC,Adding context and the fact that we have had more opportunities to score guys. Also what's league average for RISP
minnesotatwins,366lzx,swashbucklerjak,1 point,Sat May 16 19:18:58 2015 UTC,"A team will almost always hit approximately the same with RISP as they do overall, at least when given a big enough sample size. The ""clutch hitting"" argument is  when people complain about things like ""Joe Mauer can only get hits with 2 outs and nobody on, and he can't with the bases loaded and the game on the line."" That's why it makes more sense to compare their numbers with RISP to their overall numbers.   If you want to compare to league average, you might as well just look at overall numbers, which then takes this away from being a ""clutch hitting"" argument, and turns it just into an overall offense argument.   I still don't understand what the opportunities has to do with this argument. In a RISP situation in the future, you aren't going to look back and say, ""We had 100 chances like this last year."" That doesn't matter. You are going to say, ""We converted on 25% of these chances last year."" Success is going to be determined by how many situations you get multiplied by how successful you are in those situations. You want to pile up the RISP situations, and let the rates like batting average and on-base percentage work out as they do and make those RISP situations fruitful.  I am trying not to write a novel on here, so it is hard to give all the details of what I am trying to say. Hopefully this gets my point across."

minnesotatwins,366lzx,Aluminum_Love_Cradle,4,Sat May 16 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of guys would have tried to catch that with a slide and cushion the impact of the wall with their legs.

minnesotatwins,367jcw,hail_termite_queen,1 point,Sun May 17 07:10:50 2015 UTC,"All 3 guys are still really young for their level. Buxton and Sano have shown flashes of complete dominance at times, mixed with the usual struggles that any normal 20-21 year old would face at AA, especially after missing as much time as the two of them did last year.  Short answer: we shouldn't be concerned at all. All three will be Twins regulars by this time next year, barring injury."
minnesotatwins,367jcw,NotPercyChuggs,1 point,Mon May 18 13:58:20 2015 UTC,"Except they aren't struggling. Don't look now, but Sano was the Twins' Minor League Player of the Week, drawing walks, hitting homers and doubles and basically being a machine. Things are trending upwards for Buxton as well - he's hitting better, stealing bases and playing great defense. Also, Berrios will be just fine. He's got a hell of a breaking ball."
minnesotatwins,367jcw,audiocranium,-6,Mon May 18 20:30:26 2015 UTC,Buxton will be fine but I have my doubts about Berrios and Sano. Keith Law thinks Berrios' ceiling is a #3 starter. Sano can't play defense at all and I wonder if he can do anything offensively except hit homers and strike out. He could be the new Adam Dunn. I guess that would be fine except the Twins have several guys already that can't play defense.

Walk the concourse to see the whole place. Get some grub, there's lots of great foods to try. Sit back and relax with a beer while you watch America's great pastime. Baseball is considerably slower than hockey, but you never know when you might see something great; a great pitchers duel, a long towering home run, a late inning bang-bang double play. The more you know about the game, the more you will love it. There's TONS of details to learn; everything from what's an RBI to defensive player shifts to match scouting reports.   TLDR, Sit back and relax with a beer while you watch America's great pastime."
minnesotatwins,364bpv,EastWhiskey,5,Sat May 16 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I believe we will be getting there earlier and will probably have a few on the way there (stopping at bars, not while driving). We're driving from Iowa and are really hoping for dry skies.

It helps to enjoy baseball to get into the pitcher-hitter duel, even if it seems dull at first. It's such a delicate little battle when you start to understand it.  Consider a pre-game beer at Cuzzy's."

minnesotatwins,364bpv,AdaAstra,1 point,Sat May 16 22:26:36 2015 UTC,Half hour? I would go hours early and just wander the bars around the stadium as the energy is awesome. Especially if it is a nice day.
minnesotatwins,364bpv,tsaylor83,1 point,Sat May 16 05:30:19 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. One of my favorite parts of baseball is that each stadium is, to varying degrees, unique. I love seeing each one. Basketball, football, etc all seem to be the same. Baseball stadia have character IMO. Enjoy Target Field.   There are lots of great food and drink options. Get there early to find what you want and be in your seat for the anthem/first pitch. Enjoy the game, learn the rules a bit beforehand maybe if you are totally unaware, so you can enjoy the game knowing the basics."
minnesotatwins,364bpv,33165564,3,Sat May 16 13:01:08 2015 UTC,"You can bring food in soft sided containers as long as you can eat it in your seat. Sandwiches, peanuts, candy, anything you want. You can bring an empty water bottle (small-ish, plastic) and fill up at a fountain inside, or a sealed bottle of water from the store. No other beverages allowed (except baby milk, I think). The food at the park is amazing, but expensive. Just throwing it out there.   Bags must be smaller than 16x16x9 and will be checked by security. There are metal detectors at the field, so you'll have to empty your pockets to go through.   Sunscreen is probably advisable.   Pretty much any seat is awesome. The place I've sat that I didn't like was the Powerball Power Seats (right-center above out of town scoreboard) because they were very narrow. The cup holders are on the armrest instead of the seat back in front of you, so it makes them pretty narrow. Good view, but narrow seats.   Parking isn't too bad, ABC ramps should be sufficient for a weekend day game with nothing else going on downtown. If you're coming from the east metro, be advised a large section of 94 is closed this weekend so take 494 or 36 or 694. I personally like to take the train, but it really depends where you're coming from.   If you don't mind walking a few blocks, you can find a spot on the street for free (or cheap at a meter). I'm not sure what the ABC ramps cost (they're the closest), but Park And Shop is $5 all day on weekends, I believe. It's near 8th and LaSalle, if I'm remembering correctly.   Just some tips off the top of my head. If you have any specific questions, let me know."

Once you get a feel for it, start asking about particular pitches.  Perhaps one of the three will care enough to guess with you what is the next pitch for any given situation - fast or curve; outside, inside, low, or high; in strike zone or out.  If the batter whiffed at an outside pitch, do you think the next pitch will be exactly the same?  If the batter fouled off a fastball, will the next pitch be off-speed?  Paying attention to each pitch and treating each one like an event in itself makes the game more interesting than just treating each pitch as waiting for the next batted ball."

Very solid advice. I appreciate it."

minnesotatwins,35zhz2,incredibleridiculous,4,Fri May 15 02:08:17 2015 UTC,"This nails it. We are in a position where we don't have to sweat out wins and losses, because we all know this isn't a title (or playoff) team. So we can look for other things - the young guys getting reps, players getting better, slowly learning, pitchers adjusting and raising their ceiling. We all know that regression will sink in when it comes to our record, but we can still appreciate things with this team beyond Ws and Ls. It should still be a very fun season."

minnesotatwins,35zhz2,darmir,2,Fri May 15 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"While some of it has been luck, I don't think that luck is the only factor at play here.  The bullpen has been really good.  Looking at WAR (fangraphs) they are 18th (0.4WAR), but looking at WPA they are 5th (1.9 WPA).  Perkins has been playing extremely well, and closers who have really low ERAs outperform WPA compared to their WAR (Mariano Rivera had 40WAR but 57WPA).  Thompson has also been playing really well, and his ERA has been much lower than his FIP.  Fangraphs has him as a 0.1WAR player, but he is 12th for relievers with 0.88WPA.  I don't know if this is at all repeatable, but this is almost a 1 win swing.  Also, the two teams that are underachieving the most according to BaseRuns (Indians and A's) have both had terrible WPA for their bullpen.  Combined they have 0.0 WAR but -6.6WPA.  I don't know if this will continue, but it's interesting to see the two worst win differentials according to BaseRuns correspond to the two worst WPA reliever teams"

To be clear, I don't think they will finish above .500, but I also think they will win at least a few more games than they did last year (which I may not have said on Opening Day). I just think it's hypocritical to call someone an ostrich when you act like you have had your own head in the sand for the first month and a half of the season."
minnesotatwins,35zhz2,tennisspears,-3,Fri May 15 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"they will win at least a few more games than they did last year   They could be a worse team than last year and random variation could see them win a few more games than last year. When I say they are a 90 loss team, that doesn't necessarily mean they will actually lose 90 games. They could lose 86 games. Or 94 games. It's a ballpark number. And if you look at this team, especially the pitching and defense, it is hard to come to any other conclusion. A tiny little hot streak against some teams that are playing badly doesn't change reality."
minnesotatwins,35zhz2,RobertService,3,Fri May 15 15:32:18 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: a team that loses 84 games is not a 90-loss team. It is an 84-loss team.

minnesotatwins,35zhz2,RobertService,2,Sat May 16 04:30:22 2015 UTC,My guess is that they will regress to the 85-90 loss mark. But that is neither here nor there.  What I take issue with is your subjective records. You essentially said a 94-loss team is the same as an 86-loss team just because you view them as a 90-loss team.

If our bullpen can hold out until dumbass Santana gets back I can see us maintaining a good record.  Boyer and Presley have been stepping it up and I have nothing but good things to say about Gibby, Thompson and Perkins.  As long as Pelfrey doesn't have any more fucking meltdowns like he did yesterday and Nolasco keeps improving I like our chances against anyone.  Also, we always have Tommy Milone on standby if we need him.  Our defense is solid and we have a lot of talented hitters."

minnesotatwins,35yk6z,Tannekr,7,Thu May 14 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"Anibal Sanchez pitching for the Tigers. 5 pitches for him. The fourseamer and sinker both sit at around 91-93 mph, he uses the regular fastball about 36% of the time, and the sinker 11%. There's the changeup at 83-86 mph (used 23%) and the slider at 85-87 mph (used 22%). Lastly, the curve at 78 mph (used 7%).  Sanchez does a really great job of throwing all 5 pitches to both LHH and RHH, and throws them all at the same consistency no matter the count. Only key points is that he loves throwing a first pitch fourseamer 47% of the time, and if he has a LHH down to two strikes, expect the slider or change. His changeup is the swing-and miss pitch (21.09% whiff), and his slider is pretty good at it too (15.43% whiff).  Anibal has been struggling a bit this season - 2-4 with a 5.44 ERA (4.14 FIP), 37 strikeouts to 12 walks in 43 IP. His WHIP is at it's highest since his 2010 Marlins season, and giving up more HR/9 ever (yes, in a small sample size). He's given up 43 hits (17 XBH) in the 43 innings so far, including 9 hits in 7 innings last time he faced the Twins.

Did you honestly think, after 3 good games (with a couple typical stinkers mixed in there) that Mike Pelfrey, he of a career  4.50 ERA at 31 years old, had suddenly found some magic beans that turned him into a quality Major League starter? I am honestly asking you what your thoughts on him were, and if you are aware of how track records, age, and ability factor into how players perform over the course of an entire season, not just a small sample size of games."
minnesotatwins,35yk6z,NotPercyChuggs,1 point,Thu May 14 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Pelfrey is likely not a breakout candidate at 31, it is feasible that recovered from TJ finally and is a reasonable #3-4 starter... not the pitcher that we were seeing with the sub 3.00 ERA thus far this season... but not one with an ERA over 5 either.   I understand baseball just fine. I was not among the ones clamoring this was a breakout... he was never as elite as he has performed to begin this year over a full season. I understand that. Hot streaks happen for most pitchers. You just seem to be rooting for him to fail to say I told you so, while it takes a completely casual fan to think he is a #1-#2 level performer. I think if he stays healthy he provides plenty of value as a ~4.00 ERA type pitcher.. especially with how bad our rotation has been.   Regardless of what I think, I'd rather be an overoptimistic fan than a overly cynical. What joy do you get out watching/following baseball? I am honestly asking."
minnesotatwins,35yk6z,paranoid____android,1 point,Thu May 14 20:55:29 2015 UTC,"That would imply that Mike Pelfrey, before Tommy John, was a reasonable #3-4 starter, which he wasn't. Maybe by National League standards, but definitely not in the American League."

I think he is definitely a serviceable #3 and #4 starter on an average rotation, not on a team with a deep rotation (Nationals, etc.). We can disagree though. It really does depend on your definitions. He wouldn't be a solid #3 or #4 on a favorite for World Series contender, but I think it's reasonable that he could be one on a playoff contender (if the offense can pull the average rotation... not saying that is the case with the Twins).  You didn't answer my main question though. Why do you bother following baseball (especially the Twins) if it just brings out the angsty teenager in you?"

minnesotatwins,35vp90,swashbucklerjak,3,Thu May 14 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"Kyle Lobstein pitching for Detroit. 5 pitches for Lobstein - the fourseamer and sinker both sit around 87 mph and account for about 60% of his pitches. A cutter/slider that's at 82 mph (thrown 21% of the time) is thrown more frequently to LHH. He also has a changeup at 80 mph that is thrown exclusively to RHH, and then a curve at 75 mph thrown the least often.  He doesn't have any pitches that will get a hitter to swing and miss often, the most common is the changeup to RHH (17.54% whiff), where he often throws it when behind and the hitter is expecting fastball. Second best one is the cutter/slider (14.14% whiff) that is thrown in any count vs LHH.  So far this season, Lobstein is 3-2 with a 3.00 ERA (3.25 FIP), and 11 BB to 15 K in 33 IP. If you watch the Twins broadcast tonight, ""crafty lefty"" is bound to be used on him at least once.  Twins lineup vs. Lobstein -  Dozier: 1 for 4, 1 BB, 1 K  Hunter: Never faced  Mauer: 1 for 4, 2 BB, 1 K  Plouffe: Never faced  Suzuki: Never faced  Rosario: Never faced  Escobar: 3 for 5, 1 2B  Hicks: 0 for 2  Santana: 2 for 4, 1 3B, 1 BB, 1 K"

minnesotatwins,35vp90,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed May 13 23:39:29 2015 UTC,Really liking these new flairs. Thanks for that.
minnesotatwins,35vp90,NorseWolves,2,Wed May 13 23:41:28 2015 UTC,Alright I hope you learned from your mistakes last night Twinkies! Let's get at least a sac fly here.
minnesotatwins,35vp90,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Wed May 13 23:44:09 2015 UTC,That is a slow ass pick off move.
minnesotatwins,35vp90,NorseWolves,3,Wed May 13 23:45:51 2015 UTC,Not watching right now. Did he just lob it over?  (I'll see myself out.)

minnesotatwins,35vp90,Fortehlulz33,2,Wed May 13 23:54:05 2015 UTC,We needed that explosion of runs. SKOL!

minnesotatwins,35vp90,guiltycitizen,3,Thu May 14 00:25:55 2015 UTC,Literally maybe?
minnesotatwins,35vp90,CantaloupeCamper,3,Thu May 14 00:26:19 2015 UTC,Hypothetically quite possible
minnesotatwins,35vp90,guiltycitizen,2,Thu May 14 00:27:09 2015 UTC,Did Nolasco lose weight? I don't know what it is but he looks more fit.
minnesotatwins,35vp90,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Thu May 14 00:26:32 2015 UTC,I thought I heard he had over the offseason.
minnesotatwins,35vp90,tennisspears,2,Thu May 14 00:27:08 2015 UTC,Best shape of his life!
minnesotatwins,35vp90,CantaloupeCamper,2,Thu May 14 00:27:33 2015 UTC,Yep. Lost something like 30 lbs. in the offseason.

minnesotatwins,35uwto,hail_termite_queen,8,Wed May 13 18:41:36 2015 UTC,Man I'm excited for this kid
minnesotatwins,35uwto,Bickle19,9,Wed May 13 20:43:21 2015 UTC,I'm really happy this sub is really involved with farm club news. It really helps a lot to get excited for the future.
minnesotatwins,35uwto,A_Little_Off_Center,4,Wed May 13 23:56:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If you want more coverage, Twins Daily does a great recap of the farm system every day."
minnesotatwins,35uwto,wstrauss,6,Thu May 14 01:44:41 2015 UTC,Seth Stohs is the man.
minnesotatwins,35uwto,audiocranium,2,Thu May 14 03:57:24 2015 UTC,"This. They also have an awesome ""adopt-a-prospect"" forum."
minnesotatwins,35uwto,varjar,0,Thu May 14 02:37:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's going to be awesome when he's ready to be promoted.  I can't wait for 2020."
minnesotatwins,35uwto,audiocranium,6,Thu May 14 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"A few more of these type of games and we'll be seeing him in Rochester and Minnesota real quick. Good to see Kepler and Polanco raking too! Buxton and Sano will be interesting to watch over the next few weeks. They could probably each make the case for a midseason call up with some timely hitting. As is, it's looking more and more like September."
minnesotatwins,35uwto,audiocranium,5,Thu May 14 00:02:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah you have to think he's the next in line, which is exciting. If there's no reason for these pitchers to be down you want to call them up before they do too much damage to their arms. He did pitch 113 pitches today and he would instantly be the most electric pitcher in our rotation."
minnesotatwins,35uwto,lion_in_a_coma,2,Thu May 14 00:05:18 2015 UTC,Exactly. And we sorely lack strikeout guys. His 12 k's per 9 would be more than welcome in Minni. (even if that will  might go down a bit)
minnesotatwins,35uwto,Heyitscharlie,2,Thu May 14 00:14:23 2015 UTC,niceeee
minnesotatwins,35uwto,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Thu May 14 12:59:02 2015 UTC,"The thing that I love about  Berrios as opposed to some other prospects is that the kid really works. That's all anyone ever say's about him is that he will out work you in every way, shape, and form which really bodes well for him adjusting to the major league level."
minnesotatwins,35t2ln,Natrone011,7,Wed May 13 07:25:48 2015 UTC,That was me last night in ten inning when Santana failed to bunt and hicks failed to steal second. Ooofta
minnesotatwins,35t2ln,DoubleOhFour,2,Wed May 13 14:20:54 2015 UTC,Yeah. I had to leave the room after that. I knew we lost.
minnesotatwins,35t2ln,dirtywood,1 point,Wed May 13 15:02:57 2015 UTC,Hicks wasn't truly trying to steal. It was a full count to Dozier who should be able to lay off a ball above his eyes. Easily was ball four.
minnesotatwins,35t2ln,ndpool,-2,Thu May 14 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"I thought it was fitting that the game ended with Hicks holding the ball from the walkoff. He had to be thinking ""well crap, back to the minors I guess""."

minnesotatwins,35rhia,RichardManuel,11,Wed May 13 01:50:00 2015 UTC,"Alfredo Simon pitching for the Tigers. Simon relies heavily on his sinker at 93mph (thrown 40% of the time) and then pitches LHH and RHH severely different. Against lefties, it's the sinker and his splitter at 82mph, with the occasional curveball at 75mph and a rare changeup at 68mph. When he's facing right-handers, it's the sinker, a cutter at 86mph, a four seamer at 92mph, and the occasional curveball.   His strikeout pitches are the splitter to LHH and cutter to RHH. He has 23 K this season, 18 of them accounted for on those two pitches.   He's been both a starter and reliever with Baltimore and Cincinnatti from 2008-2014, was an All-Star last season with Cincy. He was part of a trade to Detroit last December and signed a $5.55M contract for this season. In 2015 he's 4-1 with a 3.44 ERA (3.85 FIP), 23 strikeouts to 10 walks in 36.2 IP.

minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed May 13 01:54:20 2015 UTC,So a mediocre career pitcher pitching above his ability is a ok with you but a young guy being called up too early and underperforming means he'll never be any good?

minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,2,Wed May 13 01:49:41 2015 UTC,My buddy and I made this joke all the time when we played baseball games on xbox.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed May 13 01:50:41 2015 UTC,Nice chop Hicks
minnesotatwins,35rhia,17th_knight,3,Wed May 13 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"Uh, not sure what the heck that was Hicks, but I'll take it."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,AdaAstra,3,Wed May 13 01:53:53 2015 UTC,HICKSY
minnesotatwins,35rhia,y2jayjk,3,Wed May 13 01:53:53 2015 UTC,Nice fucking bunt.......
minnesotatwins,35rhia,AdaAstra,3,Wed May 13 01:55:27 2015 UTC,Are you fucking kidding me.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,NorseWolves,3,Wed May 13 01:55:31 2015 UTC,That is not we wanted at all...
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,3,Wed May 13 01:55:33 2015 UTC,Science!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,CantaloupeCamper,3,Wed May 13 01:55:55 2015 UTC,Damn it Danny.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,3,Wed May 13 01:56:03 2015 UTC,I like to think Brian is calling his shot...
minnesotatwins,35rhia,CantaloupeCamper,1 point,Wed May 13 01:57:13 2015 UTC,Air batter.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,59179,3,Wed May 13 02:13:46 2015 UTC,I just realized we'll have the same record as the tigers when we win this.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Wed May 13 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we have been beating up on some teams that are really struggling.  Tigers pretty much always have our number."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,AdaAstra,3,Wed May 13 02:00:46 2015 UTC,Get Hunter up..... gah.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,CantaloupeCamper,2,Wed May 13 01:58:38 2015 UTC,Just gotta make it through this inning.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed May 13 01:59:22 2015 UTC,and we thought Hicks was fast...
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,3,Wed May 13 01:59:05 2015 UTC,Yayyyyyyy. The Twins are back.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,NorseWolves,3,Wed May 13 01:59:12 2015 UTC,It's hard to believe we'll win after that fucked up inning. But its not over..
minnesotatwins,35rhia,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Wed May 13 01:59:18 2015 UTC,sigh  Such is the way of a Twins' fan.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,AdaAstra,3,Wed May 13 01:59:54 2015 UTC,Fuck
minnesotatwins,35rhia,NorseWolves,5,Wed May 13 02:05:09 2015 UTC,"Fire Molitar, trade Mauer, give Dozier the C!!  Wait... Wrong sub."

minnesotatwins,35rhia,SemiCharmedMike,2,Tue May 12 23:16:06 2015 UTC,Gibson is making VMart look uncomfortable.  Shocking
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Cheehos,2,Tue May 12 23:19:43 2015 UTC,Come on Gibson!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SemiCharmedMike,2,Tue May 12 23:20:31 2015 UTC,A K right here would be huge for momentum...
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Cheehos,2,Tue May 12 23:20:36 2015 UTC,FINALLY I can join a GDT! LGT! Welcome back Hicks!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,WildStar81,2,Tue May 12 23:32:20 2015 UTC,Nice catch Hicks
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,2,Wed May 13 00:06:07 2015 UTC,Thank you Hicks.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed May 13 00:06:16 2015 UTC,"Gibson with 61 pitches thus far, 21 going to the two V-Mart ABs."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed May 13 00:20:57 2015 UTC,Kyle Gibson for 1B!!!!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,taffyowner,2,Wed May 13 00:40:55 2015 UTC,Gibson is the best Twins pitcher by a long ways at covering first base. Seems he makes plays like that one fairly often.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,2,Wed May 13 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"Best fielding pitcher for the Twins, easily."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed May 13 00:44:50 2015 UTC,First baseman Kyle
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Bickle19,2,Wed May 13 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"Lead-off triple, yum."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Tannekr,2,Wed May 13 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"That's the way to get out of a slump. Now get this run in, damnit."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,2,Wed May 13 01:14:14 2015 UTC,"Nice rip, Danny!"
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,2,Wed May 13 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"Damn, is Santana quick. I'll take a leadoff triple.  EDIT: And he scores!"
minnesotatwins,35rhia,novafire08,2,Wed May 13 01:14:49 2015 UTC,Cmon TORII... Deep fly ball.... All we need...
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Cheehos,2,Wed May 13 01:16:10 2015 UTC,TIE GAME
minnesotatwins,35rhia,y2jayjk,2,Wed May 13 01:16:54 2015 UTC,Wow those outfielders don't have very good arms.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Wed May 13 01:16:57 2015 UTC,Cespedes is pretty nasty in left.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Cheehos,2,Wed May 13 01:18:08 2015 UTC,We got this. We got this. Please...
minnesotatwins,35rhia,17th_knight,2,Wed May 13 01:25:18 2015 UTC,And that's why you intentionally walk. Perfect situation.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,jcwitte,2,Wed May 13 01:35:22 2015 UTC,Nice catch Torii!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,17th_knight,2,Wed May 13 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"Don't know how much I care for Boyer staying in over Perkins here, but three righties up so I guess it might be the right call."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 01:45:34 2015 UTC,Perkins? I'd consider Pressly and Thompson before him in this situation.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Wed May 13 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"Even Thompson? I'd think if you're bringing in a lefty, might as well make it your best one, even if he's your closer.  Since it was righties all the way through the bottom of the lineup, I could see Pressly though."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 01:49:29 2015 UTC,Maybe giving peek an extra day unless they need him.  Boyer has to get better vs right handed batters sometime....
minnesotatwins,35rhia,CantaloupeCamper,2,Wed May 13 01:48:12 2015 UTC,At least there's no sac
minnesotatwins,35rhia,17th_knight,2,Wed May 13 01:47:47 2015 UTC,EXTRA. INNINGS! Anyone play that game on Super Nintendo by chance? Fun times playing that in my friends garage after baseball games
minnesotatwins,35rhia,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Wed May 13 01:51:30 2015 UTC,There we go Hicks!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,2,Wed May 13 01:53:46 2015 UTC,Nice free out
minnesotatwins,35rhia,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Wed May 13 01:55:31 2015 UTC,Good start good start
minnesotatwins,35rhia,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Wed May 13 02:02:33 2015 UTC,"Please don't let this fucker on base again.  Edit:  Awesome, this freakishly fast dude who likes to steal is on 2nd again."

minnesotatwins,35rhia,17th_knight,2,Wed May 13 02:04:56 2015 UTC,fuuuuuuu... at least it wasn't a blow out
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,2,Wed May 13 02:05:14 2015 UTC,Molly should make the team watch that top of the 10th inning for a couple hours straight as punishment. So ugly.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,2,Wed May 13 02:05:45 2015 UTC,Damn. Wasted such good pitching.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,59179,3,Wed May 13 02:09:43 2015 UTC,I totally forgot how much I hated Hicks until I looked at the box score.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,5,Wed May 13 01:52:32 2015 UTC,I'm in love with his glove. His bat keeps breaking my heart.   Edit: and I love dat speed
minnesotatwins,35rhia,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Wed May 13 01:53:16 2015 UTC,I'll take .250
minnesotatwins,35rhia,spin8x,3,Wed May 13 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"He's been tearing up AAA and we need to find out if he's settled down or if he's a dud. His first few times up were underwhelming, but give him a chance. Besides, it's his first game up, so BA means nothing right now."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,novafire08,2,Wed May 13 01:57:14 2015 UTC,0-8 with RISP.  They didn't deserve to win that game. Gonna need to show up the next couple games to even be mentioned as an actual contender.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,overthedwaynebowe,1 point,Wed May 13 02:07:25 2015 UTC,I'm liking this patience at the plate the Twins are showing.  Aaaand Escobar strikes out.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SemiCharmedMike,2,Tue May 12 23:38:03 2015 UTC,"It's a nasty splitter, especially with 2 strikes."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Tue May 12 23:39:20 2015 UTC,Hicks looks a little slimmer this year.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,kaiserj1982,1 point,Tue May 12 23:39:10 2015 UTC,"Tough first at bat for Hicks, but it's out of the way now. Let's keep driving up the pitch count so we can get to the famously garbage Tigers' bullpen."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Cheehos,1 point,Tue May 12 23:42:33 2015 UTC,Oh snap. Bidding on that Guardado pitching lesson.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Cheehos,1 point,Tue May 12 23:44:25 2015 UTC,Fucking embarrassing to not get 1 there.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Tue May 12 23:46:07 2015 UTC,The double eephus!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Tue May 12 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"How about that Vargas double? Lucky is nice, too."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Wed May 13 00:30:36 2015 UTC,Nice short at-bat for Victor there. That's better.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 00:55:10 2015 UTC,I find it stupid that it was considered fielder's choice for Escobar
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,1 point,Wed May 13 01:04:18 2015 UTC,Gibson raising that K/9
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 01:07:31 2015 UTC,6th and 7th inning dominance.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Wed May 13 01:10:49 2015 UTC,More strikeouts in the 7th (3) than he had per 9 coming into the game (2.7).
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 01:11:16 2015 UTC,Good to see at least one guy get some K's
minnesotatwins,35rhia,RichardManuel,1 point,Wed May 13 01:11:59 2015 UTC,Gibson's looking like one hell of a pitcher.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Wed May 13 01:11:31 2015 UTC,Gibson is dealing. Nice.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,rbizzy,1 point,Wed May 13 01:11:33 2015 UTC,Danny Triple!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,1 point,Wed May 13 01:13:59 2015 UTC,"Damn, Santana, if that ball hadn't hit rain drops on the way out there, it would be a tie game.  Edit: It's now a tie game."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,jcwitte,1 point,Wed May 13 01:14:35 2015 UTC,DANSAN!!!
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Cheehos,1 point,Wed May 13 01:15:25 2015 UTC,Damn BABIP luck on that Dozier hit.

minnesotatwins,35rhia,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Wed May 13 01:17:33 2015 UTC,Whew. Thank goodness for a bad throw.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 01:17:37 2015 UTC,Don't think there was any thinking of holding him after JD's throw on the first out & unable to score so far. Had to take a chance.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Wed May 13 01:19:38 2015 UTC,"Yep. I also think Gene Glynn knew they could run on Gose, whereas J.D. and definitely Cespedes have better arms."

minnesotatwins,35rhia,SHOWTIME316,1 point,Wed May 13 01:26:25 2015 UTC,Boyer is just a damn adventure out there...
minnesotatwins,35rhia,taffyowner,2,Wed May 13 01:28:05 2015 UTC,Hard to blame him for an infield hit and a pretty good bunt.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 01:29:07 2015 UTC,Whew. Glad that stood.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,17th_knight,1 point,Wed May 13 01:31:00 2015 UTC,End it end it end it....
minnesotatwins,35rhia,17th_knight,1 point,Wed May 13 01:34:00 2015 UTC,Unsure why Iglesias wasn't able to advance to third on that broken bat groundout.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Wed May 13 01:34:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, was wondering the same thing. Didn't look like Boyer really checked him too hard."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 01:34:53 2015 UTC,Maybe didn't wanna risk it and assumed he'd score on a single whether he was on second or third. That'd be my best guess.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Wed May 13 01:35:27 2015 UTC,"Just such a big difference on ways to score from third rather than second, ball wasn't hit hard at all and Boyer didn't even give a glance. Oh well, just glad they didn't score."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,ChiefakaJames,1 point,Wed May 13 01:38:38 2015 UTC,I just cant believe that I have faith in our pitching...
minnesotatwins,35rhia,NorseWolves,1 point,Wed May 13 01:35:47 2015 UTC,How the Twins scraped together this season so far beyond me.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,StnkBy,1 point,Wed May 13 01:54:31 2015 UTC,Can someone tell me why Eduardo Escobar is still playing defense right now?  Get Schafer or Rosario out there.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,3,Wed May 13 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"Shafer's off roster. That's why Hicks is up.  Eddie's been hitting, and he 's doing a good enough job.   Don't want to over play Rosie."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,59179,1 point,Wed May 13 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"Schafer is not off the roster. Robinson is. Even if I'm somehow mistaken, one of those two is around, and a better defensive option than a converted SS."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,tennisspears,1 point,Wed May 13 02:14:22 2015 UTC,Way to fuck up that 2nd and 3rd situation with no outs boys....
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SplurgingSpurgeon,1 point,Wed May 13 02:05:32 2015 UTC,"Hey! Look! A CFer that actually has upside!  Welcome back, Hicks. Now don't fuck it up."
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SemiCharmedMike,0,Tue May 12 23:24:44 2015 UTC,You win this one Hicks but you can't play in the MLB with just infield singles.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,4,Wed May 13 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"1st game, calm yourself"
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,0,Wed May 13 01:54:44 2015 UTC,150 games and a career .201 hitter.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,3,Wed May 13 01:57:17 2015 UTC,I get it. We suck. But the just baseless pessimism in this sub is astounding.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Bickle19,0,Wed May 13 02:05:33 2015 UTC,I don't believe we suck. I think we're a solid team with a lot of upside. I don't however believe it is baseless pessimism to say that Aaron Hicks is not who we expected him to be.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,2,Wed May 13 02:14:36 2015 UTC,that's not even a full season and he has been hitting much better in AAA than previous years
minnesotatwins,35rhia,Markoshollo,1 point,Wed May 13 02:01:28 2015 UTC,I hope he turns it around I really do.
minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,2,Wed May 13 02:18:40 2015 UTC,How's his on base percentage?
minnesotatwins,35rhia,RobertService,1 point,Wed May 13 02:06:09 2015 UTC,Career is .293
minnesotatwins,35rhia,swashbucklerjak,-3,Wed May 13 02:11:52 2015 UTC,Tied in the bottom of the 8th? I got an idea! Let's put in Boyer!!!  Edit: Downvotes for calling out Boyer? Sorry :/
minnesotatwins,35rhia,SemiCharmedMike,1 point,Wed May 13 01:26:36 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's a moronic move even though it worked."
minnesotatwins,35spey,DoubleOhFour,4,Wed May 13 04:39:19 2015 UTC,Everything will be ok. I believe in our batting !
minnesotatwins,35spey,JakeIsWet,3,Wed May 13 14:23:28 2015 UTC,Wow sorry. My thoughts and prayers are with you and yours. Once I went to a game in Oakland and had to watch Carlos Silva so I know what it's like to watch a fat POS pitch.
minnesotatwins,35spey,AnalAttackProbe,1 point,Wed May 13 05:27:49 2015 UTC,Nolasco is going to have it tough. Hopefully the offense picks it up today.

I don't know if anything has clicked for him yet, but I do think the Twins owe him another shot after they pulled the trigger too soon and destroyed his confidence.

minnesotatwins,35o30g,y2jayjk,8,Tue May 12 02:16:45 2015 UTC,"I doubt its Rosario, I'd put my money on Schafer"
minnesotatwins,35o30g,Heyitscharlie,1 point,Tue May 12 03:46:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sending Rosario down when Schafer is struggling makes absolutely no sense."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,Kruse,1 point,Tue May 12 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"It could make sense, depending on the role. If Hunter, Hicks, Arcia is your starting outfield, all three of those guys are going to play nearly every day probably. You also want Rosario playing every day, not sitting on the bench as a 4th OF. If Rosario has a bad next few days, I could see them sending him back to AAA for a little while, and keeping Schafer or Robinson as the 4th OF. Rosario wasn't performing all that well in AAA when he did get called up. Sure, he had a good debut and first few games, but he could still use some polishing as well."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,tennisspears,2,Tue May 12 16:09:47 2015 UTC,"Not yet, Rosario will be gone when Arcia comes back."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,mnsportsgeek,4,Tue May 12 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"Hope he's ready this time, his defense is such a plus he really just needs to be an average bat to be a solid player."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,DaDoviende,-10,Tue May 12 02:39:23 2015 UTC,A plus compared to what?  I remember him robbing one home run and the rest of the time taking terrible routes and making mental errors galore.
minnesotatwins,35o30g,Ricky_Droschmidt,0,Tue May 12 12:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile right now,  but I think that he had a negative DRS for his career. He needs to learn how to take better routes to the ball."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,dat_1_dude,-3,Tue May 12 23:41:41 2015 UTC,"Shhhh, this sub still believes that Hicks has elite defensive skill."

minnesotatwins,35o30g,Ricky_Droschmidt,6,Tue May 12 15:09:47 2015 UTC,We couldn't leave him down in AAA any longer with the numbers he's been putting up. I really hope he takes advantage of the opportunity this time.
minnesotatwins,35o30g,Heyitscharlie,9,Tue May 12 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"How is it a no brainer?  Edit: 330/412/553/965 in AAA Rochester, thats how."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,FlannelBeard,-8,Tue May 12 02:25:44 2015 UTC,"Feel like were missing an opportunity to bring up Buxton. Team is playing well, buxton has been playin well in AA, and we have Torii up here to really mentor the kid. The same way that Kirby did with Torii. But nope let's bring up the kid who has failed over and over and over again and hasn't progressed one bit at the big league level."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,Ricky_Droschmidt,7,Tue May 12 12:26:06 2015 UTC,"So yesterday when you said   I didn't say to bring him up today.   (http://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/35l7sz/its_time_for_aaron_hicks/cr5nv0j)  you actually meant ""I didn't say to bring him up today. Wait literally just one more day to do it."""
minnesotatwins,35o30g,tennisspears,-4,Tue May 12 12:29:49 2015 UTC,I went on to say that if you're going to bring up Hicks just bring up Buxton instead.
minnesotatwins,35o30g,Ricky_Droschmidt,1 point,Tue May 12 13:05:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that's wrong too. This shouldn't be an either-or kind of thing with Hicks and Buxton.   When Buxton comes up is based entirely on his own readiness, nothing else. Even if the major league team has no outfielders capable of catching a fly ball, they won't call him up unless he is ready. On the flip side, even if the major league team has 3-4 fully capable outfielders, they will find room for Buxton if he is ready. That's what you do with top prospects. They haven't called Buxton up yet, so that means they just don't think he is ready, and I would not argue with them. Up until two weeks ago, he was struggling hard in AA. Two good weeks at that level are not enough to show you are ready to handle the MLB."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,tennisspears,-7,Tue May 12 13:20:48 2015 UTC,We are replacing a mediocre outfielder with another mediocre outfielder. Get the kid who has actual potential up here and get him some experience while we really have nothing to lose and have a great mentor in Torii Hunter on the roster.
minnesotatwins,35o30g,Ricky_Droschmidt,8,Tue May 12 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"You didn't understand what I said.   Buxton. Isn't. Ready. For. The. MLB.  You don't rush a prospect just because you mismanaged the outfield previously. You still keep him on his own schedule, if he is as good of a prospect as Buxton is. It doesn't matter if the Twins have an outfield of Torii Hunter, my grandma, and a cardboard cutout of Brian Dozier. They will not call up Byron Buxton until he has shown them more than two weeks of good baseball at AA."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,tennisspears,4,Tue May 12 13:32:08 2015 UTC,You didn't understand what I said.   That seems to be his thing or something.
minnesotatwins,35o30g,CantaloupeCamper,0,Tue May 12 13:56:00 2015 UTC,And Hicks is?
minnesotatwins,35o30g,mostdope92,2,Tue May 12 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"Byron Buxton at AA: 29 G, .270/.331/.504, 11 BBs, 27 SOs  Aaron Hicks at AA+AAA: 245 G, .288/.383/.457, 141 BBs, 197 SOs  I don't know if Aaron Hicks will ever be a successful MLB player, but he has shown more success in the upper levels of the minor leagues than Buxton has so far. The only advantage Buxton has (over a small sample, that is) is power hitting, which is not Hicks' game anyway. If you think Buxton is ready right now on 5/12/15, then based on minor league numbers, you should also think Hicks is.  I'm not saying I prefer Hicks going forward to Buxton. Buxton will be a much better player than Hicks in the future. I'm just saying if my options are:    Call up Hicks now, Buxton in a few months after he has played more in AA Call up Buxton now, Cut Hicks loose/leave him to rot in AAA forever   I'm saying option 1 is the best long-term option."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,tennisspears,1 point,Tue May 12 15:22:21 2015 UTC,"Call up Hicks now and hope that when Buxton is ready in a few months, Hicks has been playing well so he can be traded for a decent return rather than left to rot in AAA forever."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,sj79,-5,Tue May 12 17:14:23 2015 UTC,"""Rushing a prospect"". If you can play then you can play. Yea he would struggle at first but then you'll see a little bursts of greatness if he's as good as everyone says he is. We have nothing to lose and recycling hicks with the same result helps no one."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,Ricky_Droschmidt,1 point,Tue May 12 13:43:44 2015 UTC,"Seriously dude? Hicks struggled in his first couple call-ups, like many players do. He's still relatively young and has obviously earned another shot with his AAA numbers. Imagine if the Twins had given up on Plouffe after he struggled badly in 2010, or for a more extreme case, if the Angels had given up on Trout after his first call up.  There's no rush to bring up Buxton, so we might as well see what we have in Hicks."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,kimjongslice,1 point,Tue May 12 12:41:55 2015 UTC,Buxton is in AA. He needs to play well in AAA before he can come up. And hes not playing that well in AA.
minnesotatwins,35o30g,FlannelBeard,3,Tue May 12 13:03:08 2015 UTC,High level talent often skips AAA.
minnesotatwins,35o30g,mnsportsgeek,1 point,Tue May 12 14:33:16 2015 UTC,"Danny Santan skipped AAA. Hes not high level, but if spending some time in AAA means being a more ready hitter, Id say give him some time. Hicks still can pan out."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,FlannelBeard,2,Tue May 12 14:35:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not advocating that Buxton is ready to be called up. I'm just saying that he likely won't spend any time in AAA.  The talent level between AA and AAA is pretty minimal. If he sustains AA success for a month or more, then he'll be ready for a call up. AAA is usually reserved for dead end players or guys that need to work on their mechanics."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,mnsportsgeek,2,Tue May 12 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"Jorge Polanco has a career OPS of 1.333 and he skipped AAA and AA!  Seriously though, you know who actually skipped AAA?  Aaron Hicks.  You know who else did?  Joe Mauer.  Fact is that it really just depends."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,DaDoviende,1 point,Tue May 12 14:51:02 2015 UTC,The problem wasn't that Aaron Hicks skipped AAA. It was that he never had a chance to dominate AA.
minnesotatwins,35o30g,mnsportsgeek,2,Tue May 12 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"He was pretty good in 2012 but I suppose he wasn't really dominant.  Then again, Buxton hasn't been, either."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,DaDoviende,1 point,Tue May 12 19:49:34 2015 UTC,"Santana started in AAA last season. He only played there for 24 games, but he didn't quite skip it."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,tennisspears,1 point,Tue May 12 14:45:13 2015 UTC,"He won't need to play in AAA; it is very possible that his eventual promotion to the Twins is straight from AA. A lot of top prospects come straight from AA. AAA is used more for guys who need polishing, like Hicks and Pinto, and for older minor league players that are used as emergency call-ups, like Doug Bernier and Chris Colabello.   And Buxton started out really slow, but has picked up his game significantly over the last couple weeks. But overall, you are right that he shouldn't be called up now. He needs to show more than two or three good weeks in AA before earning a call-up. Another 6-8 weeks of playing like he is now will have him making a trip to Minnesota."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,tennisspears,1 point,Tue May 12 13:24:35 2015 UTC,"While he doesn't need to play in AAA and is, in fact, playing very well for a 21 year old in AA coming off a lost season (.835 OPS), he does definitely need to stay in the minors for a bit longer. If he continues to crush as he has recently, he will be up by the All Star game...likely much sooner."
minnesotatwins,35o30g,hail_termite_queen,2,Tue May 12 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"I am going to guess it's Schafer. Edit: Per FSN, Robinson is going on family emergency list."

minnesotatwins,35o30g,Ricky_Droschmidt,-1,Tue May 12 16:03:21 2015 UTC,I don't think I have any illegitimate children.
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,rocketpig,10,Mon May 11 12:23:59 2015 UTC,"I think Twins brass wants Hicks' next call up to be his last, one way or another.  And I don't agree with the ""his career line is the same as the guys he'd be replacing so just bring him up already!"" mantra because he should be better than that.  Much better.    When he comes up it has to be as an everyday starter, too, because just sitting on the bench will do him almost no good at all (as evidenced by earlier stints in the bigs).  If the Twins don't think that all of those pieces are together yet, then I'm fine with him staying down for a little bit longer."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,DaDoviende,2,Mon May 11 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"I think the career line bit makes sense when you add it to his superior defense. Why not have someone who, worst case scenario, is the same offensively, and actually an upgrade to your atrocious outfield defense?"
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,Opie59,5,Mon May 11 15:00:00 2015 UTC,Because Robinson has been fine so far and you want to give yourself the best chance to avoid the worst case scenario as possible.  It's easy to get swept up in this winning streak and start pushing for stuff like this but sacrificing the long term because of the short term is how we ended up losing 90+ games for four straight years.
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,DaDoviende,3,Mon May 11 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"Hicks has the higher ceiling. He is the long term (hopefully.) If he finally gets his shit together, an outfield of Rosario, Buxton, and Hicks in the long run would be far more ideal than letting some journeyman with a career OPS of .621 play now."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,Opie59,3,Mon May 11 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"Hicks has the higher ceiling. He is the long term (hopefully.)   Yes, he is.  Which is why calling him up with the mindset ""well he can't be worse"" instead of ""let's make sure we give him the best chance to be better"" is the problem.  Calling him up too soon (again) just increases the chance that we end up closer to the floor than the ceiling.  And since we already have the former on the roster (Robinson), I'd rather give him time to increase the chance of the latter."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,DaDoviende,1 point,Mon May 11 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"Ooooooooh, I follow you now. I'd agree with that. I don't know if I agree in Hicks' case. But I understand your meaning now."

minnesotatwins,35l7sz,taffyowner,4,Mon May 11 23:41:09 2015 UTC,"Both of our CF haven't been horrible, just Schafer.  Robinson has actually been pretty good, and even though he probably will start to regress (.378 BABIP) he has played good defense in CF.  Also, Robinson has been 14th in WAR for CF (according to fangraphs) despite not being a full time player.  They should see if Hicks keeps this up for a few more weeks and also see if Robinson is able to continue to be a valuable player"
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,The_No_Lifer,1 point,Mon May 11 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"Neither Shaefer or Robinson are full-time options.  4th OF and defensive replacement at best.  Neither should be playing full time, thus get someone in there who can.  I also think Rosario has played CF in the minors.  Why not have an OF of Rosario (CF), Arcia (LF), Hunter (RF) when everyone is healthy?"
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,dabecka,2,Mon May 11 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"Robinson is just a 4th OF, but we don't have a legit MLB-ready CF in our organization.  Rosario has had an OBP of about .280 in AA last year and AAA this year.  Right now, Rosario will be a much worse option than Robinson in CF.  Ride out Robinson now while he's hot then bring Hicks up when he falls back down.  Also, that outfield would be a defensive nightmare.  Rosario can play CF, but at best he would be average now, and neither Hunter or Arcia are average corner OF.  With Hunter and Arcia, we need a guy who is an above-average fielding CF"
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,The_No_Lifer,1 point,Mon May 11 16:27:02 2015 UTC,Yep Rosario played 184 games in center in the minors. 204 gp at 2nd and 50 in the corner outfield spots.
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,RichardManuel,1 point,Mon May 11 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"Arcia is not a major-league caliber defensive outfielder.  While I'm not a big fan of Shaefer/Robinson in CF, with Rosario in left the outfield defense is at least passable."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,tenthreeleader,4,Mon May 11 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that the Twins wanted more than just numbers from Hicks, they wanted to see extra effort as well, he wasn't putting in extra practice time when he was at the MLB level.     Hicks seemed pretty pissed when he went down.   I haven't heard if he has been putting in the extra effort or not."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,CantaloupeCamper,2,Mon May 11 14:03:52 2015 UTC,Hicks has a shit attitude. Odds are that he'll be traded before long.
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,Kruse,2,Mon May 11 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"Note that the best player produced by the Twins vaunted farm system in recent years didn't become productive until he was traded (Gomez).  It's clear that these players are being over-coached by esoteric baseball minds who think smart at-bats means a .230 average with a shitload of walks.  Let Hicks play, don't Gomez him."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,BlylevenTVProfanity,1 point,Tue May 12 22:18:01 2015 UTC,I think that's pretty valid.
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,southsideson,1 point,Wed May 13 07:04:05 2015 UTC,Gomez didn't come from the Twins system. The Mets rushed the guy and the Twins doubled down on the Mets' mistake.

minnesotatwins,35l7sz,DaDoviende,5,Mon May 11 13:24:13 2015 UTC,He needs to be playing every day imo.  If he can't do that in the majors then leave him in AAA.

minnesotatwins,35l7sz,dabecka,5,Mon May 11 13:48:33 2015 UTC,Because rushing the last CF prospect worked out so well??
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,Ricky_Droschmidt,-5,Mon May 11 16:05:59 2015 UTC,"No because hicks is useless so if they're planning on bringing him up just don't and move up Buxton instead. Bringing up prospects has worked well for a bunch of other teams. Mike trout, George springer, Jose altuve, Jose abreu, kris Bryant just to name a few of the recent players that have made an immediate impact. If buxton is as good as everyone is saying he is why replace mediocrity with more mediocrity instead of bringing up a kid with a chance to be a legitimate game changer on both sides of the ball."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,tennisspears,6,Mon May 11 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"Mike Trout: 91 games played in AA, 20 in AAA before being called up  George Springer: 95 in AA, 75 in AAA  Kris Bryant: 68 in AA, 77 in AAA  Jose Abreu: was 26 when he was signed, not at all comparable to any of these guys  Jose Altuve: 35 in AA  Byron Buxton: 29 in AA, after missing essentially an entire season with injuries  So Jose Altuve is the only one that is even remotely comparable to Buxton when it comes to games played in the high level of minors, and that's only if you ignore the fact that Buxton missed almost all of the 2014 season. You can't say that because these guys produced, Buxton will too. Their situations were completely different than his is."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,Ricky_Droschmidt,-4,Mon May 11 17:04:01 2015 UTC,I didn't say to bring him up today. But for my money if they're going To call up hicks I would rather have buxton called up. I wasn't trying to compare time spent in the minors it was more of just saying guys can come up at a young age and make a serious impact. They're taking it slow with buxton which is totally fine especially considering the injuries last year. But I just can not bring myself to ever want hicks back up here again. He's just absolutely painful to watch and I lost any respect for him after being told to stop switch hitting and he basically just disregarded it and then turned down the option to play winter ball. That just screams unprofessional and immature and we have no need for that in the lineup or in the clubhouse.
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,DaDoviende,1 point,Mon May 11 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"He wasn't told to stop switch hitting, he decided on his own to do it and told the Twins that's what he was doing.  Then when he realized it was a dumb idea he went back to switch hitting."
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,Ricky_Droschmidt,-4,Mon May 11 17:23:43 2015 UTC,You can stick up for him all you want he's just not good and I have no interest in watching him play in a twins uniform.
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,DaDoviende,6,Mon May 11 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sticking up for him, I'm correcting misinformation.  The Twins had nothing to do with him not switch hitting anymore.  http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24572913/aaron-hicks-will-stop-switch-hitting-due-to-lack-of-confidence-from-left-side"
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,Capn_Barboza,1 point,Mon May 11 17:30:17 2015 UTC,I think ultimately had buxton not been hurt last year he'd be our starting cf right now...  As for his call up ive heard as early as mid 2015 to early 2016... THE WAITS ALMOST OVER!
minnesotatwins,35l7sz,Ricky_Droschmidt,1 point,Mon May 11 20:16:56 2015 UTC,You're probably right. Buxton will be up before the end of the season. If not soon after the all star break he will be a September call up.

minnesotatwins,35i2s8,Markoshollo,4,Sun May 10 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"Looks good, but we're going to need more loons."
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,Taub-NUT,3,Sun May 10 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, that Dozier hair is more than I could ask for! Good work, sir!"
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sun May 10 17:21:40 2015 UTC,Awesome man. I love adding more flair.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,FlannelBeard,7,Sun May 10 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"Might be because I missed the first 4 or so innings, but this loss doesn't even feel bad. 9 of last 10 feels too good."
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,ChiefakaJames,3,Sun May 10 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Sucks to lose, yes, but even the ""best"" teams have lost their fair share of games."

minnesotatwins,35i2s8,ChiefakaJames,6,Sun May 10 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"So if we win and Tiger lose, we are tied for second place with the Tigers."
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,kaiserj1982,7,Sun May 10 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"But if we win and the Royals lose, we're only a game out of 1st place."

minnesotatwins,35i2s8,BrianDoziersHair,10,Sun May 10 17:13:09 2015 UTC,So there was a tornado that just went right over my small city in SD. And I was more worried  about being able to watch the game.  I might have a problem....
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,AdaAstra,3,Sun May 10 17:29:35 2015 UTC,"I live in SD. Woke up to the same issues, including a tornado warning. First thing I did was sit down, turn on the game, and stress about the score.   We live in tornado country, we have our priorities set."
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,17th_knight,2,Sun May 10 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"Are you still there?  How about your small city, is it still there?"
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,onceamennonite,3,Sun May 10 18:04:07 2015 UTC,"I am. My city lucked out as the tornado never touched down until after going over, but the funnel cloud was there and we were expecting it to drop at any moment. But apparently one smaller town took a pretty big hit and this system is heading north into other areas.  Just fueling tornadoes and lots of hail.  Quite a bit of rain too (couple inches an hour), so expect flooding will be a problem.  If you are in mid-northern SD......good luck!"
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,AdaAstra,2,Sun May 10 18:08:24 2015 UTC,"That's not a problem, that called having your priorities in line!"

minnesotatwins,35i2s8,DetectiveWoofles,5,Sun May 10 17:30:11 2015 UTC,Does anyone else remember that one year when Jacque Jones had tons of leadoff homeruns? He was awesome that year.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,Taub-NUT,4,Sun May 10 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"Looks like he had 11 leadoff homers in 2002, which is fifth all time and was third all time at the time."

minnesotatwins,35i2s8,DetectiveWoofles,4,Sun May 10 17:37:27 2015 UTC,Gotta get his pitch count up and tire him out and I'm thinkin' he'll throw a few meatballs near the end.  Just my crappy prediction.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,BrianDoziersHair,2,Sun May 10 17:39:10 2015 UTC,something something great minds

minnesotatwins,35i2s8,DetectiveWoofles,4,Sun May 10 18:19:22 2015 UTC,Double fuck for kicking the ball away.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,kaiserj1982,2,Sun May 10 18:19:52 2015 UTC,Triple fuck for beating the shift.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sun May 10 18:23:23 2015 UTC,Almost a really nice play.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,onceamennonite,4,Sun May 10 18:19:58 2015 UTC,Damnit.....Rosario almost had that.     ....and there is that fucking drum.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,AdaAstra,4,Sun May 10 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Man, that's not a real easy play, but it has been a rough day in the outfield for Rosario."
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,tennisspears,0,Sun May 10 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"The Twins have a lot of severely flawed prospects. In Rosario's case, he can't hit enough to be a corner outfielder, doesn't have enough range to be a center fielder and can't play second defensively either. They should try to trade him before all this becomes too apparent and he settles in as a 4th outfielder in MLB. Edit: If he gets that far."
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,RobertService,-1,Sun May 10 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that most Twins prospects aren't that good.  Sano and Buxton are exceptions.  You see all these young stud pitchers coming up all over the league, and all the Twins have produced in the past 5 years is Kyle Gibson.  As for Rosario, I like him so far but you make some good points.  I'd get rid of Arcia if possible, but I'm absolutely sure that nobody's interested in him.  Gonna be a long year."
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,RobertService,2,Sun May 10 18:59:56 2015 UTC,The best pitcher the Twins organization has drafted since 1996 when Ryan became GM is either Matt Garza or Scott Baker. That's 2 decent pitchers in almost 20 years. They have zero clues how to draft and develop pitchers.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,DetectiveWoofles,5,Sun May 10 19:10:00 2015 UTC,"You know this is basically a perfect game, too bad Dozier had to ruin it.  Now I can't even use the IT'S A PERFECT GAME jinx."
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,swashbucklerjak,3,Sun May 10 19:10:41 2015 UTC,I think that qualifies as settling down

This is exactly what happens to most teams when they face good pitching.  The Twins, being a below-average team, are going to get conked around in games like this.    Tigers should sweep the Twins easily.  In fact, if the Twins win a game in Detroit, I'll never come back here again."

Even in the few games where he has managed to pitch well he still looked pretty bad. A shame that Alex Meyers is looking like a bust too.   Downvotes? ok. Dude hasn't pitched well since SINGLE A. At AA he never had a sub 4.5 ERA. Is rocking a 1.54 WHIP and is 26 in September. In the MLBs 7+ ERA last year and a 5 ERA this year.
minnesotatwins,35i2s8,kaiserj1982,2,Sun May 10 18:24:53 2015 UTC,I've been saying for quite a while that his ceiling is a bullpen guy in MLB. But I fully support giving him a chance to start and I would give him a nice long leash to try to prove I'm wrong. He has a better chance of being a decent starter than almost anybody in the Twins organization.

I live in Isanti so 96.3 is really spotty so I usually just pop on the app so I don't miss anything.   I also use the Tune-in app for listening to ESPN 1500 but the Twins are on KFAN which is a Clear Channel station so it's on the Iheart Radio app but I have never tried it.

minnesotatwins,35gtz6,FlannelBeard,11,Sun May 10 05:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'm increasingly tempted to believe that this is the impact of Molitor as the new coach.  People in the offseason were laughing about the idea that the Twins could even go .500 -- with people guessing that a best case scenario would be improving by maybe 5 wins and getting to something like 75 wins.  I thought .500 was optimistic but doable.  It's super early, but I've seen enough to already say that nobody was expecting them to have even a short stretch this good.  My hunch is that Molitor is not only a better coach but also that players like playing for him better."
minnesotatwins,35gtz6,HAL9000000,7,Sun May 10 14:06:21 2015 UTC,Or it could be because we're beating up truly terrible teams....if we look this good halfway through June I'll feel some of that temptation.
minnesotatwins,35gtz6,Lager17,3,Sun May 10 16:07:35 2015 UTC,Maybe. But dominating bad teams is still impressive.  Most people would have thought that Minnesota would be one of those terrible teams.  So at worst they are middle of the pack.  And they won the only Royals series so far.  We'll find out about reality one way or another this week when they play Detroit and Tampa Bay.
minnesotatwins,35gtz6,HAL9000000,1 point,Sun May 10 16:14:30 2015 UTC,"Gardenhire had the team above .500 in May, too. Also we've both won a series vs. the Royals and lost. I do believe they are the only >.500 teams we've faced.   I DO think we're a better club, but I think that's more on the performances of Gibson, Perkins, and Hunter than anything Moli has done."
minnesotatwins,35gtz6,Lager17,1 point,Sun May 10 16:33:12 2015 UTC,we also played the Tigers but we lost 5 of 6 against them. I think this week is going to be a good test for them with the Tigers and Rays coming up.
minnesotatwins,35gtz6,forgetfulburglar,3,Mon May 11 01:02:13 2015 UTC,Our offense hasn't ever been bad. The last few years its been top 10 or top 5. Pitching has always been the problem
minnesotatwins,35gtz6,HAL9000000,2,Sun May 10 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"Truth. But even WITH Ervin Santana, people still thought they'd be the worst team in the Central.  There's no question they are playing better than people believed they would.  And I would even argue that the way Molitor is handling pitchers differently than Gardenhire is helping the pitchers play better.  He's not so rigid about wanting to leavea guy in when he starts to struggle.  The other day the Twins were up like 7-2 and I forget who was pitching for the Twins but he had loaded the bases.  It was kind of early in the game and I think Gardenhire in this case would have left the guy in just because he's focused on trying to get guys 100 pitches.  Molitor yanked the guy and the reliever ended the inning with the bases loaded.  There are more examples, but my observation is that Molitor is making smarter decisions.  The way Gardenhire was, he was so fixed on his own very strict blueprints for managing that I honestly felt like he could give the batboy a one page set of rules for how he wants the the team managed and the batboy could do the same job."
minnesotatwins,35gtz6,HAL9000000,1 point,Sun May 10 17:57:25 2015 UTC,That's more just thinking that the other teams improved more than the twins. I think adding Neil Allen and everyday Eddie has helped more than anything
minnesotatwins,35gtz6,PogueMahone82381,2,Sun May 10 19:47:23 2015 UTC,"Sure, well, adding Molitor means him choosing new staff.  So I give credit to his staff but I give the most credit to Molitor for picking a good staff and working well together with them.  Another weakness of Gardenhire's --> finds his favorites and can't work with some people.  Obviously a good coach in some ways but for me just too inflexible."

Guys are sitting 4 seem and letting him try to nibble and often miss with that cutter.    I think the book is out on the ""new hughes"" - he's gonna throw you strikes, often time a fastball, be ready for it and don't miss.  Also, he has been catching a LOT of plate, and not working in and out effectively on the corners.  He has traditionally been a slow starter in his career, so hopefully he's about ready to turn the corner.  When Hughes has absolute control of his back door cutter, like he did last year, we will see a different pitcher."

I checked out the last two years because the Twins did too.  If they're not willing to spend their way through a bad stretch of no internally developed talent I'm not gonna waste my time and money to watch them field an awful roster.    I understand why they did it, and it appears the farm system is replenished.  But that doesn't mean I have to watch it.   Also, trading Span after he signed a team-friendly deal since he wanted to stay here left a bad taste in my mouth.  Again, I understand why they did it... I don't have to like it."

minnesotatwins,35f535,kaiserj1982,10,Sat May 9 23:13:16 2015 UTC,"Again today, where are all the Torii haters at?"
minnesotatwins,35f535,swashbucklerjak,4,Sat May 9 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"My wife saw that highlight pop up on MLB Tonight a few minutes ago and was like ""Still think we shouldn't have signed him?"" And I was like ""ehh not so much if he is this productive for the next 4 months."""
minnesotatwins,35f535,novafire08,3,Sat May 9 20:17:53 2015 UTC,"It was a legitimate thing to question over the winter. We were signing a 39-year old outfielder when it was our pitching that was weak last year. Now it's the season though, Torii's producing and our pitching is better than last year, so people are shutting up after being proved wrong."
minnesotatwins,35f535,RobertService,3,Sat May 9 21:17:27 2015 UTC,No. Nobody has been proved wrong yet. And on top of that the pitchers still suck. You're just showing knee jerk reactions there.
minnesotatwins,35f535,serpentinepad,2,Sat May 9 23:15:26 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm one of those.  I love Torii, just didn't like the signing.   Still don't."
minnesotatwins,35f535,Taub-NUT,6,Sat May 9 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"Life is good, don't take it for granted. Appreciate every day and every Twins run. Or don't, whatever floats your loon."
minnesotatwins,35f535,kcpistol,7,Sat May 9 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"Hey hey TwinBros! We sent the Tigers back toward you standings-wise today.  Much as I like Bruce Chen as a person, I'm for you guys pushing Cleveland further down into the cellar with the spiders. Looks like you've got a great start on that!"
minnesotatwins,35f535,swashbucklerjak,3,Sat May 9 20:58:23 2015 UTC,Woohoo! I love to see the Tigers lose.
minnesotatwins,35f535,DetectiveWoofles,6,Sat May 9 20:59:37 2015 UTC,Damn it feels great to not be the worst.
minnesotatwins,35f535,SplurgingSpurgeon,8,Sat May 9 21:33:09 2015 UTC,SCHAFER DON'T DO THAT TO MY HEART
minnesotatwins,35f535,DetectiveWoofles,7,Sat May 9 22:41:33 2015 UTC,11 for 11 for Perkins!
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,8,Sat May 9 23:12:53 2015 UTC,Twins win again! 9 of their last 10!
minnesotatwins,35f535,17th_knight,6,Sat May 9 23:13:03 2015 UTC,Let's see if Torii goes full scrub and has one at-bat where he doesn't get a hit
minnesotatwins,35f535,ChiefakaJames,6,Sat May 9 19:44:04 2015 UTC,Torii on a tear.
minnesotatwins,35f535,DetectiveWoofles,6,Sat May 9 20:13:47 2015 UTC,Damn Torii.

minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,5,Sat May 9 20:16:52 2015 UTC,we have to distinguish ourselves from the RoyalsBros somehow though!

minnesotatwins,35f535,cardith_lorda,7,Sat May 9 21:31:42 2015 UTC,LOON SHOT FOR THE BULLDOZIER!
minnesotatwins,35f535,Jerickson13,5,Sat May 9 21:37:46 2015 UTC,Jesus Schafer make that catch look a little more dangerous
minnesotatwins,35f535,SplurgingSpurgeon,6,Sat May 9 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I thought that was gone. My baseball watching abilities still aren't there yet."
minnesotatwins,35f535,DetectiveWoofles,7,Sat May 9 22:42:41 2015 UTC,ONE MORE PERK.

minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,4,Sat May 9 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"30 pitches for Chen, 7 for Hughes. Awesome."
minnesotatwins,35f535,FlannelBeard,5,Sat May 9 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"Boy, gamethreads around here sure pick up when the team is winning. We'll see how these go when August arrives, and we have actually had to play good teams."
minnesotatwins,35f535,swashbucklerjak,5,Sat May 9 20:27:50 2015 UTC,You know what if bandwagoners wanna show up to game threads I'm fine with it. I just like seeing the discussion.
minnesotatwins,35f535,FlannelBeard,2,Sat May 9 20:28:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I just know in previous years, there were threads with like 5 comments for a whole game. Those are painful to put up with."
minnesotatwins,35f535,SplurgingSpurgeon,2,Sat May 9 20:30:34 2015 UTC,"Well the Wild lost, so there's not many other sports to watch."
minnesotatwins,35f535,NorseWolves,4,Sat May 9 20:34:08 2015 UTC,Chug home big guy! Nice inning.
minnesotatwins,35f535,kaiserj1982,2,Sat May 9 20:41:23 2015 UTC,I couldn't tell if that was thunder I was feeling or him running.

minnesotatwins,35f535,dannygopher,3,Sat May 9 21:21:13 2015 UTC,Hunter has been on base every time he has been up to bat this series.
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,5,Sat May 9 21:46:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty sad when a lefty reliever has to get replaced by another lefty. Your main job is to get lefties out, Duensing."
minnesotatwins,35f535,d00dsm00t,2,Sat May 9 21:48:48 2015 UTC,Thought the same thing. No confidence there from Molly. Interesting
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,6,Sat May 9 22:39:11 2015 UTC,About fucking time.   God lord that inning was brutal.
minnesotatwins,35f535,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Sat May 9 22:42:34 2015 UTC,The boys just want Perk to get another save
minnesotatwins,35f535,d00dsm00t,5,Sat May 9 22:41:40 2015 UTC,2nd best team in baseball with runners in scoring position and 2 outs?   The Twins?

minnesotatwins,35f535,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,4,Sat May 9 20:16:19 2015 UTC,I WANT A VARGAS BOMB
minnesotatwins,35f535,swashbucklerjak,3,Sat May 9 20:22:24 2015 UTC,Me too! I want this kid to show keep some restraint at the plate.
minnesotatwins,35f535,Mariox,5,Sat May 9 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"3 quick outs, and back to the Twins to score another run!"
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,4,Sat May 9 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"Man, Hunter is just destroying Cleveland. 6/6 this series is impressive."
minnesotatwins,35f535,DetectiveWoofles,4,Sat May 9 20:27:52 2015 UTC,Good baserunning there!
minnesotatwins,35f535,Mariox,2,Sat May 9 20:47:30 2015 UTC,Looks like we got Cleavland on their backs now!

minnesotatwins,35f535,guiltycitizen,3,Sat May 9 21:46:38 2015 UTC,I hate Swisher as much as Newman hates Keith Hernandez
minnesotatwins,35f535,DetectiveWoofles,4,Sat May 9 22:17:56 2015 UTC,Looks like Hughes night is gonna be over sooner than we thought.
minnesotatwins,35f535,SplurgingSpurgeon,4,Sat May 9 22:20:15 2015 UTC,This game is much more stressful than I initially thought it would be.

minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,3,Sat May 9 22:41:24 2015 UTC,thank god
minnesotatwins,35f535,kaiserj1982,3,Sat May 9 22:41:28 2015 UTC,That inning took 1 yr off my life.
minnesotatwins,35f535,novafire08,2,Sat May 9 22:41:38 2015 UTC,"Good, my heart can start beating again."
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,5,Sat May 9 22:41:45 2015 UTC,I don't miss that drum.  I remember now why I always hated games in Cleveland.
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,4,Sat May 9 22:41:55 2015 UTC,Aaron Thompson is so money.

minnesotatwins,35f535,swashbucklerjak,3,Sat May 9 20:09:36 2015 UTC,TORII!
minnesotatwins,35f535,iGiveWomenOrgasms_jk,3,Sat May 9 20:12:13 2015 UTC,Alright! That's our clean up guy!! #MVP
minnesotatwins,35f535,BrianDoziersHair,3,Sat May 9 20:14:59 2015 UTC,That wrapper scooting between the pitcher's mound and home was a bit distracting.
minnesotatwins,35f535,y2jayjk,3,Sat May 9 20:17:50 2015 UTC,Torii Hunter MVP
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,3,Sat May 9 20:20:02 2015 UTC,I was on a call so didn't hear what was up with Plouffe.  Anyone know outside that it was just a family matter?
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,5,Sat May 9 20:31:12 2015 UTC,His grandpa died last weekend. Funeral is today.
minnesotatwins,35f535,ChiefakaJames,3,Sat May 9 20:36:55 2015 UTC,Damn that wall.
minnesotatwins,35f535,SpicyElectricity,3,Sat May 9 20:37:31 2015 UTC,Go Twins!
minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,3,Sat May 9 20:43:48 2015 UTC,haha we score again!
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,3,Sat May 9 20:50:47 2015 UTC,Hell fucking yes!!!!!!
minnesotatwins,35f535,dannygopher,3,Sat May 9 20:57:08 2015 UTC,Nice gamble by Hunter right there. Let's keep scoring runs guys.
minnesotatwins,35f535,NorseWolves,3,Sat May 9 20:57:31 2015 UTC,Everthing is clicking so far. It is quite the show.
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,3,Sat May 9 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we are beating up on teams that are under .500, so I'm still treading on ice with my hope for the Twins being as good as they seem to be."
minnesotatwins,35f535,NorseWolves,3,Sat May 9 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"I am just enjoying it while it lasts. And if this is legit, even better."
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,2,Sat May 9 21:26:47 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong about them playing bad teams, but over the last 4 years, the Twins were one of those teams, so beating up on them now is still a good sign. Not only that, but the Twins haven't just been beating them, they have been scoring 6+ runs per game against them all. The only team that has been definitively better than the Twins so far this year (among the teams they have played) is the Tigers. They split with the Royals and have beaten the rest pretty convincingly."
minnesotatwins,35f535,NorseWolves,3,Sat May 9 21:28:30 2015 UTC,Fuckin Grand Slam incoming.
minnesotatwins,35f535,FlannelBeard,3,Sat May 9 21:35:38 2015 UTC,88 pitches through 5. Damn Chen had a rough day.
minnesotatwins,35f535,Jerickson13,3,Sat May 9 21:25:22 2015 UTC,If we can beat Bruce Chen we can beat anyone!
minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,3,Sat May 9 21:25:29 2015 UTC,More runs!
minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,3,Sat May 9 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"7 0-2 base hits! Edit: Also, first Eddie hit without an RBI"
minnesotatwins,35f535,pman5595,3,Sat May 9 21:31:03 2015 UTC,7 hits on 0-2 counts for the Twins today!
minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,3,Sat May 9 21:33:05 2015 UTC,Complete game shut out for Hughes? Looking likely!
minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,3,Sat May 9 21:33:27 2015 UTC,I feel like Santana should sit one of these days 3/16 the last 4 games
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,3,Sat May 9 21:42:02 2015 UTC,Boom baby!
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,3,Sat May 9 21:46:21 2015 UTC,Hahaha.......8/8
minnesotatwins,35f535,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sat May 9 21:46:30 2015 UTC,Hunter on base again... this is some juju shit.
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,3,Sat May 9 21:48:25 2015 UTC,Is that Scott Ullger coaching third for the Indians? No? Really?
minnesotatwins,35f535,FlannelBeard,2,Sat May 9 21:48:34 2015 UTC,Google says no.
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,3,Sat May 9 22:00:06 2015 UTC,It was a joke based on the questionable send there. I know it isn't him.
minnesotatwins,35f535,FlannelBeard,3,Sat May 9 22:02:54 2015 UTC,Well now I feel stupid
minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,3,Sat May 9 22:03:52 2015 UTC,I honestly couldn't tell if it was a joke or not. It seemed like it but at the same time it seemed serious
minnesotatwins,35f535,y2jayjk,3,Sat May 9 22:06:12 2015 UTC,Uh oh. TONKIN COME SAVE US
minnesotatwins,35f535,AdaAstra,3,Sat May 9 22:06:15 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, bring out the Loon!"

minnesotatwins,35f535,guiltycitizen,3,Sat May 9 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"Okay, now get some back, boys!"
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,3,Sat May 9 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"Holy cow, Suzuki. Unhook the plow! I thought that would be a much closer play at first than it was."
minnesotatwins,35f535,Markoshollo,2,Sat May 9 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"I really hate when players don't hustle, even on easy outs. I mean you hustle and get thrown out and what, you're tired? Well you are going back to the bench anyway"
minnesotatwins,35f535,tennisspears,3,Sat May 9 22:49:47 2015 UTC,"Ah man. That's a tough play, but I'm so used to Plouffe's good defense right now that I feel like that play should've been made."
minnesotatwins,35f535,DetectiveWoofles,3,Sat May 9 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"Okay Perk, close the door."
minnesotatwins,35f535,onceamennonite,3,Sat May 9 22:53:09 2015 UTC,Moss has to sit down!  Guess he wasn't expecting the fast ball!

minnesotatwins,35fyst,frownifdown,8,Sat May 9 23:53:36 2015 UTC,"I'll go.   The Twins actually had a top 10 offense last year and look to be poised to be even better this year.      Leading off: 2B: Brian Dozier     Leads off and plays second base.  He's a homegrown guy who won't blow you away.  But he's got a lot of traits that are above average for his position, if not better.  He's got a good eye at the plate, so his combination of his ability to drive the ball (66 2B's + 41 HRs over the last 2 seasons),his ability to draw walks and get on base that way, and his smarts on the basepaths (he's not super fast, but he knows how to take extra bases and read pitchers)...offsets to some extent his typically low batting averages. (.242 + .235 respectively)  He's got a high baseball IQ and is pretty athletic as a former converted short stop...he's definitely above average as a fielder for a second baseman.    To sum it up: Dozier provides great pop from the top of the order and his ability to work counts and see pitches makes him great + take extra bases on the basepaths make him a pretty good player.  All star caliber probably.    Expect... .  240-250ish avg/.340-.350ish obp(6th most BB's in MLB last yr) 100ish runs  30ish doubles  20 ish hrs 60-70 rbi's 15-20 sbs    Hitting 2nd: RF Torii Hunter     We all know Torii, the former fan favorite, who the Twins let go back in 07 because he was supposably going to be on the decline very soon.   But since he's left he's really not stopped hitting.  Really basically putting up the same types of numbers he did on his years with the Twins.  And the 39yr old doesn't seem to be slowing down this year either.  He's currently on pace for about 35 2b's 25 hr's and 100 rbi's while hitting almost .300.  Although he's not the fielder he once was and no longer mans CF like he used too...he's still a smart defensive player even if he's lost a couple steps.    What can you expect?    .270-.280 avg 30-35 2b's 15-25 hrs 70-80 rbi's    Hitting 3rd: 1B Joe Mauer    Yes Mauer is overpaid and yes he won't provide the kind of pop that you would ideally want from your first basemen.  Yes he grounds into a lot of double plays and gets beat more than he used to.    But, he still has one of the purest strokes in the game and when he's content to work counts and use the gaps...he's a great hitter.  And he's still our best player and the calming presence in the middle of the lineup.  Mauer has yet to hit a HR this season, but is on pace for over 40 doubles and 5 triples...so he's still driving the ball.      What to expect?  .290-.300 avg - .350-.360 obp 60-70 runs 30-40 2Bs 3-5 3Bs 10ish HRs 65-75 rbis    Hitting 4th: LF Oswaldo Arcia    Currently banged up and on the DL, but when healthy he's one of the best pure power hitters in the game.  The guy can mash.  He's yet to be able to replicate the +.300 avg he's put up for his career in the minors, but he's only 24 and has already played parts of 3 seasons in the majors.  And last year he hit 20 HRs in just over 100 games.    He's had some injury issues that have kept him from really being able to put an entire season together, but he's a really promising young player.    What to expect?  He probably won't play enough to reach these numbers, but if Arcia can remain healthy for most of the season and find that consistency...  .250-260 avg 30ish 2Bs 30ish HRs  80 ish RBIs    Hitting 5th: 1B/DH Kenny Vargas    Vargas exploded onto the scene after being promoted straight from AA late last season.  The switch hitting 1st baseman has drawn comparisions to a former Twin DH named David Ortiz.  Ortiz himself even alluded to it in an interview last season.  Similiar body type and power potential.    Vargas started off pretty slow this season.  The 24 year old with only 300 ab's above AA seems to be rewarding the Twins for their patience.  The power hasn't consistently come quite yet, but he's hitting over .400 in May, striking out less, and has hit 2 HRs in his last 8 games.     What to expect?  .250ish avg 25ish 2Bs 20-25 HRs 70-75 RBIs    Hitting 6th: 3B Trevor Plouffe  Plouffe has made himself into a nifty player and is actually a pretty nice option at 3B, but his long term future on the team is relegated to holding down the fort until phenom Miguel Sano reaches the majors.  What to expect?  Plouffe has added elements to his game every year.  And has shown more patience than ever this year   .255-.265 avg/.340-.350 obp 25-30 2Bs 20-25 HRs 65-75 RBIs    Hitting 7th: C Kurt Suzuki    Kurt Suzuki is average and can get on base and make contact, but this is probably the biggest area of weakness in the Twins organization.  What to expect?  .250-.260avg  7-10 HRs 20ish 2Bs 40-50 RBIs    Hitting 8th: CF Jordan Shaefer    The Twins traded away both Denard Span and Ben Revere with the hopes that Aaron Hicks would prove to be the player they thought he was and be able to fill that spot until Buxton develops.  But unfortunately Hicks has not been able to replicate his minor league and spring training success at the major league level.  Schaefer is a speedy player who uses his speed to be an above average player defensively and as slap hitter who struggles to drive the ball, but can get on base slapping the ball around and using his speed.  What to expect?  .240ish avg 25-30 SBs     Hitting 9th: SS/CF Danny Santana    And Danny Santana mans SS and rounds out the lineup providing some speed, base stealing ability, and a little offense from the bottom of the order.  He played really really well last season and posted numbers well above his minor league numbers  He's good enough where he's not a weakness, but probably not much better than that.  What to expect?  .270ish avg  70ish runs 5-7 HRs 7-9 3Bs 25-30 2Bs 40-45 RBIs 20-30 SBs    Strengths: DH, 1B, 2B, LF Solid enough: SS/3B/RF Weaknesses: CF, C    What's next?"
minnesotatwins,35fyst,thetimeisnow1095,4,Sun May 10 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"How to fix the weaknesses:  CF Jordan Schaefer is just keep things warm until Twins phenom, CF Byron Buxton reaches the majors.    Catching:  Josmil Pinto has the bat to be an above average major league catcher, but won't supplant Suzuki until he becomes better calling a game behind the plate.    The other promising catcher in the system is defensive wiz Stuart Turner.  His calling card will always be his defense...so if he can prove he's at least capable with the bat...he'll be a really interesting player.  He's been solid at the plate so far in his minor league career.  Doesn't hit for a high average, but draws a decent amount of walks and has flashed enough power and ability to drive the ball to keep you interested.    I'm optmistic about a Pinto/Turner tandem, but the Twins should continue to address this position in the future in the draft.    Upgrading 3B, SS, RF    3B:  Plouffe is actually a pretty good hitter.  But the Twins have a prospect by the name of Miguel Sano who might currently have the best power potential in the minors--40+ HR potential--and is 1 of the top 10 prospects in all of baseball.  Hopefully the Twins can still keep Plouffe around as he's a pretty useful player since he can fill in capably at DH, 3B, 1B, LF, and RF.    Sano isn't great defensively while Plouffe has flashed some pretty good defensive ability at 3B at times.  SS:  Danny Santana is fine for now at SS.    And he'll likely man the position until a couple really promising middle infield players SS Nick Gordon (who's been ranked as high as the 33rd best prospect in the MLB by mlb.com)    Gordon projects to be solid in the field, but also be a very good player defensively.  The twins drafted him in the 1st round and have high hopes for him.  Jorge Polanco is another prospect scouts rave about and one of the top 100 in the league.  He's been a very very good hitter for a middle infielder, but has looked shakey in the field.  His value will be better if he can stick at SS.   RF:  unter will be 40 starting next season, but the Twins have a couple guys in Eddie Rosario--who's currently debuting during Arcia's injury--he's another guy who's struggled to find a position, but been a great hitter.    He'll have more value if he can figure out how to play the 2B position, the position he's primarily been at in the minors, but the Twins combination of lots of very good middle infield options and his lack of consistency at the position might push him to the OF.  Luckily his bat should be good enough to play there.    The other guy to keep an eye on is Adam Walker.  He mashed 25 and 27 HRs respectively over his last 2 minor league seasons at A and A+ and he's continued that same trend at AA.  He's already hit 7 HRs in 25 games this year.  For Walker it will always be about if he can make enough contact to let his power show.    He's been able to do it in the minors, but he still strikes out too much and doesn't walk quite enough (although he's not awful) he'll have to continue to work on that as the pitching gets better and pitchers at higher levels start to throw him more breaking balls.  But, he's answered the bell at every letter so far.    When the Twins are hitting their window there offense should look something like:  C-Turner/Pinto (splitting time...Mauer as emergency)  1B- Mauer (Vargas/Plouffe)  2B: Dozier (Polanco/Rosario)  SS: Gordon (Polanco/Santana)  3B: Sano (Plouffe)  LF: Arcia (Rosario/Plouffe)  CF: Buxton (Hicks/Santana)  RF: Walker (Rosario/Plouffe)  DH: Vargas (Plouffe/Rosario/Pinto)  If the kids all pan out...Dozier will be a nice trade piece and you can run with:  2B: Polanco/Rosario SS: Gordon/Santana/Polanco  I'll do the state of the Twins pitching staff later."
minnesotatwins,35fyst,thetimeisnow1095,2,Sun May 10 03:44:44 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Dozier has had nearly an abrupt turnaround in his playing abilities as Glen Perkins has over the last three or four years. I heartily disliked both back when Perk was a starter and Dozier was a shortstop who honest to god made more errors than Jesus himself would have. But man have they rebounded and both are now two of my favorite Twins, and I'd hate to trade Dozier unless it was for a nice prospect."
minnesotatwins,35fyst,Jorgenstern8,1 point,Sun May 10 05:36:58 2015 UTC,"Oh I completely agree both ways.  Dozier is actually my favorite player on the Twins.  Dozier's contract ends in 2019 and he'll then be on the wrong side of 30.  If Rosario and/or Polanco pan out like we hope...Polanco will be 24 and Rosario will be only 26.  Polanco's starting his 1st full season at AA and it's only been 23 games...but he's on pace for about .290/352Bs/20hrs/80rbi/30sb.  Rosario had an off year last year, but if you go by his previous numbers he's a guy who looks like he can put up .300/402B/15HRs/80 rbi/15 sb.  We'll see how there power develops.   Right now they both have gap power with a little bit of pop, but as they develop...one could put some projection there.  Both have Doziery speed as in 15-20 SBs and just make really good contact, like Dozier, so they can drive in a lot of runs for a middle infielder.  Dozier's still putting up big numbers so far this year.     He's on pace for like a   .250-120 runs- 60 XBH (40 2B- 5 3B- 15 HR)-80 RBI-12 SB type  season and he's just entering his prime. Dozier ranked among 2B last year:  14th in avg 1st in runs Tied 7th in 2B Tied 1st in HR 6th in RBI 1st in BB 4th in SB 5th in OBP 4th in wOBP 5th in SLG% 4th in OPS 2nd in ISO Tied 1st in Ultimate baserunning (Dozier has 6.9, 3rd place 3.2) 3rd in wRC 5th in wRC+ 4th in wRAA  So I guess maybe we shouldn't trade Dozier.

He's six-foot-nothing on a good day, but Berrios regularly works in the mid-90s with his fastball and complements it with a good curveball and changeup. Not yet 21 years old, he spent much of 2014 at Double-A, made a cameo at Triple-A, and was named the Twins' minor league pitcher of the year.  Berrios dominated high Single-A hitters to begin last season, starting 16 games with a 1.96 ERA and 109/23 K/BB ratio in 96 innings while holding opponents to a .218 batting average. He was one of just three 20-year-olds to make at least 15 starts in the Florida State League and then in July he moved up to Double-A, where he was the youngest pitcher in the Eastern League to throw more than 40 innings.  Even with a poor season-ending start at Triple-A included his overall numbers were brilliant for a 20-year-old, with a 2.77 ERA and 140/38 K/BB ratio in 140 innings. Berrios is often overshadowed within the Twins' system, but he'd be the No. 1 prospect for a lot of teams and could be knocking on the door to the majors in the second half. It's subjective, of course, but Berrios' mix of upside and polish makes him arguably the Twins' top pitching prospect since Matt Garza in 2007.   Kohl Stewart | Starter | DOB: 10/94 | Throws: Right | Draft: 2013-1   YEAR     LV      G     GS      ERA        IP       H     HR      SO     BB 2013     RK-     6      3     1.69      16.0      12      0      16      3          RK+     1      1     0.00       4.0       1      0       8      1 2014     A-     19     19     2.59      87.0      75      4      62     24 Considered the top high school prospect in the 2013 draft, the Twins selected Texas right-hander Kohl Stewart fourth overall after college stars went 1-2-3. On draft day scouting director Deron Johnson described Stewart's ceiling as ""unlimited"" and he signed for $4.5 million, bypassing a chance to follow in Johnny Manziel's footstep as Texas A&M's quarterback. Stewart had a great pro debut with a 1.35 ERA and 24/4 K/BB ratio in 20 rookie-ball innings.  He moved up to low Single-A last season and on the surface Stewart had similar success, posting a 2.59 ERA in 19 starts and holding opponents to a .233 batting average. However, he managed just 62 strikeouts in 87 innings, struggled to maintain peak fastball velocity, and was shut down with shoulder problems. High school pitchers make risky top-10 picks for a reason and Stewart failed to crack Baseball America's annual top-100 prospects list after placing 52nd last year.  Along with the sub par strikeout rate he did induce plenty of ground balls and allow just 17 total extra-base hits in 360 plate appearances, so if the shoulder issues prove minor Stewart's first full season was hardly a disaster. If not for the hype attached with being a top-five pick simply holding his own against low Single-A hitters as an 19-year-old with 20 post-high school innings under his belt would be very encouraging.   Nick Burdi | Reliever | DOB: 1/93 | Throws: Right | Draft: 2014-2   YEAR     LV      G     GS      ERA        IP       H     HR      SO     BB 2014     A-     13      0     4.15      13.0       8      0      26      8          A+      7      0     0.00       7.1       5      0      12      2 In recent years the Twins have gone very heavy on drafting hard-throwing college relievers and the returns have been underwhelming so far. That could change with Nick Burdi, their hardest-throwing college reliever yet. His college numbers at Louisville were video game-level ridiculous, with a 0.62 ERA and 127 strikeouts in 73 innings for 2013/2014, and Baseball America's pre-draft scouting report unequivocally called him ""the hardest thrower in college baseball.""  He was originally drafted by the Twins in the 24th round out of high school and they picked him again last year, this time 46th overall. He signed for $1.2 million and skipped rookie-ball, starting his pro career at low Single-A and quickly moving up to high Single-A. Between the two levels the 6-foot-5 right-hander racked up an incredible 38 strikeouts in 20 innings while regularly cracking 100 miles per hour. His low-90s slider (yes, low-90s slider) is considered a plus pitch too.  College relievers in other organizations tend to move quickly through the minors and while the Twins in general tend to hold back their draft picks Burdi making it to Fort Myers already is a sign they have him on the fast track. As you might expect from a triple-digit thrower his control needs a lot of work, but his walk rate is merely bad and not disastrous. Burdi could be the first pitcher to truly usher the Twins into the modern era of high-velocity arms and he could do it in 2015."
minnesotatwins,35fyst,thetimeisnow1095,1 point,Sun May 10 06:18:52 2015 UTC,"Lewis Thorpe | Starter | DOB: 12/95 | Throws: Left | Sign: Australia   YEAR     LV      G     GS      ERA        IP       H     HR      SO     BB 2013     RK-    12      8     2.05      44.0      32      2      64      6 2014     A-     16     16     3.52      71.2      62      7      80     36 Lewis Thorpe was signed out of Australia by the Twins for $500,000 as a 16-year-old and one year later he dominated rookie-ball hitters in his pro debut, racking up 64 strikeouts versus six walks in 44 innings. Convinced he was ready for full-season competition, the Twins had Thorpe skip advanced rookie-ball and sent him to low Single-A as an 18-year-old. Not surprisingly he got off to a rough start, allowing 13 runs in his first 18 innings.  Thorpe turned things around quickly and finished the season with a 12-start stretch in which he posted a 2.52 ERA and 73/26 K/BB ratio in 54 innings while holding opponents to a .213 batting average. Those great numbers become spectacular numbers when you consider he was the only 18-year-old in the entire Midwest League to throw at least 70 innings and the average age of the hitters he faced was 22.  Things came to a screeching halt in September when Thorpe was diagnosed with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow, which can often lead to Tommy John surgery. He skipped pitching winter ball in Australia and is expected to be ready for Opening Day, but given the Twins' recent history with such things it's hard not to be pessimistic. If healthy Thorpe has top-of-the-rotation upside and his performance at such a young age really stands out.   Michael Cederoth | Starter | DOB: 11/92 | Throws: Right | Draft: 2014-3   YEAR     LV      G     GS      ERA        IP       H     HR      SO     BB 2014     RK+    11     10     3.55      45.2      41      1      42     18 In their ongoing effort to add more high-end velocity to the organization the Twins picked San Diego State right-hander Michael Cederoth in the third round last year. Cederoth was a starter in 2012 and 2013, but shifted to the bullpen in 2014 and topped out at 100 miles per hour while racking up 20 saves with a 2.28 ERA and 55 strikeouts in 52 innings. Despite that relief success Cederoth made his pro debut as a starter and fared pretty well for rookie-level Elizabethton.  Making the abbreviated outings that are common for rookie-ball starters, he posted a 3.55 ERA with just one homer allowed and a 42/18 K/BB ratio in 46 innings. His fastball predictably wasn't able to reach triple-digits as a starter, but Cederoth worked in the mid-90s and his control was encouraging. He walked 3.5 per nine innings, which is a lot, but in college Cederoth walked 5.2 per nine innings.  Converting hard-throwing college relievers into pro starters has repeatedly gone poorly for the Twins in recent years and Cederoth's mediocre results as a college starter leave even less room for optimism, but he's 6-foot-6 with an equally big fastball and there's always a role in the majors for that profile even if it's yet to be determined. This year he'll make the jump up to full-season competition at Single-A and try to develop his secondary pitches.   Stephen Gonsalves | Starter | DOB: 7/94 | Throws: Left | Draft: 2013-4   YEAR     LV      G     GS      ERA        IP       H     HR      SO     BB 2013     RK-     5      2     0.63      14.1       8      0      18      7          RK+     3      3     1.29      14.0      10      0      21      4 2014     RK+     6      6     2.79      29.0      23      1      26     10          A-      8      8     3.19      36.2      31      1      44     11 Stephen Gonsalves was viewed as a first-round talent in 2013, but fell to the Twins in the fourth round following a suspension during his senior year of high school in California and then signed for second-round money at $700,000. His pro debut was impressive, as the 6-foot-5 lefty logged 28 rookie-ball innings with a 0.95 ERA and 39/11 K/BB ratio without allowing a homer. He stayed in rookie-ball to begin last season and then moved up to low Single-A, where he thrived at age 19.  Despite being younger than around 90 percent of the pitchers in the Midwest League he started eight games for Cedar Rapids with a 3.19 ERA and 44/11 K/BB ratio in 37 innings, striking out 30 percent of the batters he faced while opponents hit .228 with one homer. Toss in his rookie-ball numbers and through two pro seasons Gonsalves has a combined 2.39 ERA with 109 strikeouts and two homers allowed in 94 innings.  His control still needs work and Gonsalves' off-speed pitches generally receive mediocre reviews, both of which may need to change for his success to continue against tougher competition if his fastball stays in the low-90s. He also needs to handle a full-season workload for the first time at age 20, so expectations should be held in check, but Gonsalves looks like a potential mid-rotation starter down the road if things go well."

With football subs you have a crapload of discussion topics because you have so much time in between events. But with baseball I can just watch the game almost every day to get my Twins fix.
minnesotatwins,35azrw,vagrantwade,1 point,Sat May 9 19:42:47 2015 UTC,I had a hipster moment the other day when I said I was watching the Twins before they started winning. My first season I ever watched was 2010. So I've seen more losing seasons that winning seasons.

minnesotatwins,35brht,DoubleOhFour,1 point,Fri May 8 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

minnesotatwins,35ad1g,BrianDoziersHair,1 point,Fri May 8 19:34:18 2015 UTC,My brother and I split it every year
minnesotatwins,35ad1g,audiocranium,1 point,Fri May 8 20:33:57 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the only people I know who care about baseball all live in the respective states/television areas of their teams. Haha
minnesotatwins,35ad1g,swashbucklerjak,3,Mon May 11 12:10:45 2015 UTC,"If for some reason a game is blacked out for you, hit up Hola.org for the Hola extension (Firefox, Chrome, and Safari supported), and have fun being able to see EVERY game! :)"
minnesotatwins,35ad1g,swashbucklerjak,3,Fri May 8 15:19:46 2015 UTC,Thank you for that. I have the MLB package through Verizon and they only play the home team broadcast and I would much rather watch Dick and Bert
minnesotatwins,35drrn,innesota2,11,Sat May 9 10:04:01 2015 UTC,"Bro who cares about history. This is a new group who has never even been a relevant team with an even somewhat respectable record. Who knows, maybe this version of the twins sweeps the AL east this season but can't win on the west coast. Just cuz we couldn't beat the AL east when we had fucking Morneau and cuddyer on our team, that has nothing to do with this team."
minnesotatwins,35drrn,The_Only_Abe,3,Sat May 9 13:36:23 2015 UTC,You must have full commitment to the twins wehrmacht otherwise you'll be reported.
minnesotatwins,35drrn,Lager17,0,Sat May 9 14:15:10 2015 UTC,Everyone knows this is unsustainable. Don't be rude and point it out!
minnesotatwins,35bkdq,ImNotFamous,6,Fri May 8 19:10:52 2015 UTC,If we keep thinking like this we're going to turn into /r/minnesotavikings .... they already won 3 super bowls this offseason... and I'm not sure they're done yet.
minnesotatwins,35bkdq,CantaloupeCamper,4,Fri May 8 21:23:31 2015 UTC,Hey! I am one of those guys.
minnesotatwins,35bkdq,Crixus_champion,2,Sat May 9 01:55:29 2015 UTC,We all are in our hearts...
minnesotatwins,35bkdq,CantaloupeCamper,3,Sat May 9 01:57:13 2015 UTC,Haha! Those guys were REALLY into the draft.
minnesotatwins,35bkdq,guiltycitizen,3,Fri May 8 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, okay now time to pump the brakes. The recent win streak is great, but we're barely over the one month mark. There's still 5 more full months to play. Last year we did pretty well before the All-Star break and kind of fell apart from there. Gotta make it happen over the long haul, and one month isn't even close to enough of a sample size with the way the past 4 years have gone."
minnesotatwins,35bkdq,poisonous_crotch,0,Fri May 8 19:22:46 2015 UTC,In what world? We're two games back in the AL central.
minnesotatwins,35bkdq,Ctrl5,3,Sat May 9 13:52:10 2015 UTC,Wild card bud.
minnesotatwins,357oxz,swashbucklerjak,28,Thu May 7 20:09:55 2015 UTC,WE BACK?

minnesotatwins,357oxz,Crixus_champion,27,Fri May 8 03:26:21 2015 UTC,"In the last 7 games the twins have the most runs, and the best average in the league too!"
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,12,Thu May 7 20:28:22 2015 UTC,These stats get me so hyped
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,6,Thu May 7 20:29:21 2015 UTC,Awesome
minnesotatwins,357oxz,BrianDoziersHair,6,Fri May 8 03:28:27 2015 UTC,These stats make me so awesome go twins
minnesotatwins,357oxz,audiocranium,23,Fri May 8 03:28:46 2015 UTC,"Side note: I just saw that there are 80 fans milling around this subreddit right now, that's probably the most I've seen in a good while. :U"
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,10,Thu May 7 20:16:20 2015 UTC,~2k fans at this point last year as well.
minnesotatwins,357oxz,CantaloupeCamper,9,Thu May 7 20:23:06 2015 UTC,Hell yeah! Lets get this sub active!
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,4,Thu May 7 20:23:29 2015 UTC,Brian Doziers hair is awesome! Go twins
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,15,Fri May 8 03:27:34 2015 UTC,His hair is longer now and more glorious than ever!
minnesotatwins,357oxz,50in15,8,Thu May 7 20:16:17 2015 UTC,God that is awesome.
minnesotatwins,357oxz,50in15,5,Thu May 7 20:20:55 2015 UTC,No you're awesome. Go twins!!
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,5,Fri May 8 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, you're awesome, and go twins"
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,14,Fri May 8 03:28:16 2015 UTC,"Woo! First post ever on the Twins sub, but have been a fan for well over a dozen years. Really encouraged by the explosiveness of our offense in this homestand. Pitching is bipolar as usual, but who cares we're on the rise!"
minnesotatwins,357oxz,rootlinuxusr,10,Thu May 7 20:32:15 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  This isn't the best team, I don't think anyone here will say that but goddamn if this last week and a half hasn't been a great time to be a Twins fan."
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,5,Thu May 7 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"Just the right timing too. The Wild are embracing the 2nd Round Sweep, and try as I might every year to pretend that I don't have time and emotional capacity to watch the Twins, they suck me in without fail."
minnesotatwins,357oxz,emteereddit,3,Thu May 7 20:36:34 2015 UTC,Don't sweat it bro you're awesome anyway go twins
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,6,Fri May 8 03:29:21 2015 UTC,i certainly don't care go twins and you're awesome keep bein awesome old timer  PS in those dozen years which was your favorite season and why was it 2006???
minnesotatwins,357oxz,ON_3,1 point,Fri May 8 03:37:44 2015 UTC,Only one acceptable answer: Bradke.
minnesotatwins,357oxz,BrianDoziersHair,2,Fri May 8 18:12:55 2015 UTC,I dunno bro brad rad was pretty killer that year but Morneau Mauer and Santana were all pretty killer plus the come from behind story line and all that. It's insane that we got swept by the a's!!!  Keep being awesome bye

minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,5,Fri May 8 03:35:34 2015 UTC,Royals bro here!! Have a updong!   i like yo duck btw
minnesotatwins,357oxz,lion_in_a_coma,2,Fri May 8 12:58:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, someone with skills needs to edit this into a Twins version.  (But it's so fucking cool anyways; I love the hat flip!)"
minnesotatwins,357oxz,lion_in_a_coma,10,Fri May 8 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"Fucking hell.  I've had season tickets for the last four years, and cancelled them this year because it got so depressing, and now they decide to light a fire under their asses.  Oh well, glad to see they're on the up and up and I can always buy tickets.  It's just such a stereotypical MN thing to happen.  When you give up hope they start being good until you have hope again, and then they can bring you back down again."
minnesotatwins,357oxz,CantaloupeCamper,10,Thu May 7 20:38:42 2015 UTC,immediately gives up on the Wild this series  gives up on Vikings next year  I don't care about basketball
minnesotatwins,357oxz,giantgnat,5,Thu May 7 20:42:01 2015 UTC,Fucking Wild....
minnesotatwins,357oxz,CantaloupeCamper,4,Thu May 7 23:20:37 2015 UTC,Bro don't underestimate teddy ballgame or wiggins but for now go twins
minnesotatwins,357oxz,giantgnat,2,Fri May 8 03:34:47 2015 UTC,You should care about basketball. The wolves are about to get good so hop on the bandwaggon now.
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,2,Fri May 8 14:09:12 2015 UTC,I've been told that since Garnett left.
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,2,Fri May 8 15:03:23 2015 UTC,Lol whoever told you was dumb then. Right now we have some of if not THE best young talent in the league (with a top 4 pick this draft). Basketball is fun to watch and we have a young team that has a huge ceiling. You should give it a shot :D
minnesotatwins,357oxz,giantgnat,1 point,Fri May 8 15:09:07 2015 UTC,I'll try...maybe...but probably not.  I'm still trying to get into hockey after 25 years.
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,5,Fri May 8 15:21:28 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you can still get season tickets if you want.
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,6,Thu May 7 21:46:51 2015 UTC,"I can, but we knew we were cancelling them so we blew that budget on Wild games..."
minnesotatwins,357oxz,1iI1iI1iI1iI,10,Thu May 7 21:49:45 2015 UTC,Oh  Oh my  hug
minnesotatwins,357oxz,davricle,5,Thu May 7 21:50:31 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I needed that.  :(
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,5,Thu May 7 22:11:25 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah that's some team spirit keep being awesome
minnesotatwins,357oxz,TheMichaelN,5,Fri May 8 03:33:47 2015 UTC,Sorry bro chin up tho twins are winning
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,3,Fri May 8 03:33:22 2015 UTC,Yep :) had time to watch the game today and was pretty excited to see them do well.  Good timing for another mn team to start kicking ass!
minnesotatwins,357oxz,tdawg4rul,4,Fri May 8 03:55:38 2015 UTC,Great suggestion go twins
minnesotatwins,357oxz,BrianDoziersHair,3,Fri May 8 03:34:09 2015 UTC,sorry bro that sucks have an upvot

minnesotatwins,357oxz,guiltycitizen,4,Fri May 8 00:07:21 2015 UTC,That's pretty weird but you're awesome and so are the twins
minnesotatwins,357oxz,kgthdc2468,3,Fri May 8 03:32:43 2015 UTC,That's the greatest thing I've ever seen on the internet!
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,1 point,Fri May 8 04:49:42 2015 UTC,So I read that Torii brought up the idea of having a dance-off type thing after each win this year.   http://www.startribune.com/hot-twins-aren-t-blowing-smoke-after-8-3-homestand/302972691/?recirculation=section&section=sports
minnesotatwins,357oxz,boqueno,6,Fri May 8 15:24:23 2015 UTC,I think we are currently in the wild card spot. Never thought I would ever say that after the past couple of years and our start this year
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,5,Thu May 7 23:37:25 2015 UTC,God damn that feels good thanks for that update go twins and you're awesome
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,3,Fri May 8 03:30:29 2015 UTC,I know and it is REALLY exciting!  But I've been hurt before...

minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,5,Fri May 8 03:31:06 2015 UTC,It feels sooooooooooooooo good!
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,5,Thu May 7 20:51:43 2015 UTC,Cautiously optimistic. It's good to see them competitive at the very least!
minnesotatwins,357oxz,WholeLottaThinMints,3,Thu May 7 22:18:15 2015 UTC,Go twins you're awesome
minnesotatwins,357oxz,jargonista,4,Fri May 8 03:25:14 2015 UTC,"Does this mean I can stop saying ""I know... I know..."" every time I tell someone I'm a Twins fan?!?"

minnesotatwins,357oxz,17th_knight,4,Fri May 8 01:34:19 2015 UTC,Go twins ur awesome
minnesotatwins,35chkp,ilovemnsports,4,Fri May 8 23:59:00 2015 UTC,Can somebody tell me the rankings for errors committed against a team this year?  It seems to me that teams play their worst baseball against the twins.
minnesotatwins,35chkp,tdawg4rul,2,Sat May 9 03:53:15 2015 UTC,It is possible if we can maintain until Santana returns and maybe get some help pitching before the deadline.
minnesotatwins,35chkp,crippletown,2,Sat May 9 02:36:41 2015 UTC,Ok negative Nancy
minnesotatwins,35chkp,Crixus_champion,2,Sat May 9 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't think the tone was that negative. It points out a lot of what was already pretty apparent, the pitching needs to do well, and the lineup needs to continue bringing in runs. I do have to agree at this point that our run is likely not sustainable season-long unless pitching can perform. I hope I'm wrong though, it's been exciting to watch!"
minnesotatwins,35chkp,poisonous_crotch,1 point,Sat May 9 13:01:03 2015 UTC,so actual factual analysis of interesting and relevant statistics isn't  ok now because it's negative? Jeez

minnesotatwins,357p36,PigFarmington,4,Fri May 8 15:55:49 2015 UTC,GOOD JOB GUYS
