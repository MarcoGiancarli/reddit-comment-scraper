If it was just a standard shipping cost, then there is no negotiation. She wouldn't be worried about being lowballed. There would be a fee determined by the shipping not something that would be negotiated. It wouldn't vary.   ALSO, how are they deciding a number beforehand? If you charge for shipping, the charge is based off of how much the shipping costs. They don't know the shipping costs but they are already discussing a price.   Finally, at 1:50, she says the person comes ON-SITE and just takes the tissue. Where are the costs in shipping/handling that PP is incurring? The plain out sold it."

But the amount of money they're talking about here is peanuts. $100 per 'specimen'? That is not trying to make a profit, that is simply recouping the costs associated with any type of tissue donation. There a lots of costs to preserve the tissue, transport it safely, etc. Again, I'm very much against the heinous act of abortion, but the attempt to make it look like PP is making a lot of money from this is pretty feeble and unconvincing. And ultimately, I think these weak cases just make us look less credible and only strengthen the public opinion that PP is good, and we're a bunch of crazies looking for any petty excuse to shut them down. I think they should be shut down, but a petty $100 fee is not our strongest argument, and I think it's just distracting from the real issues."
prolife,3e2jea,mjackl,3,Tue Jul 21 14:19:08 2015 UTC,"My understanding, and I believe she affirms this in the video, is that the rep from the company that is taking the tissue is typically actually right there in the building where the abortions happen. PPFA isn't shipping/transporting the ""tissue"" to some location, they simple hand over the ""tissue"" to the rep who is right there. Thus, charging 100 bucks for the ""transportation costs"" is pretty much a cover for actually making a good amount of profit off this."

Typically, an abortion clinic pays to have medical waste disposed.  In this case, a company is offering to turn some of the trash into cash.  Does that create an incentive to alter care for the patient?  Dr. Arthur Caplan, a pro-choice bioethicist, says it does.   ""In abortion the primary goal is to give the safest abortion possible,"" Caplan said. ""Your sole concern has to be the mother and her health.""...  If a provider is considering how to get the tissue that's in the best shape, ""that's a huge conflict of interest. ""   In other words, the potential to subsidize each procedure by up to $100 creates a conflict of interest for the doctor performing the procedure.  Do they subtly pressure women to consent?  override the consent?  Change the procedure even though PP's consent form says they won't?  PP performs 300,000 abortions a year.  Even if only 10% of women consent to donate tissue, that's 3 million dollars a year.  People have done a lot worse than step around an informed consent form for that kind of incentive.  A pro-choice person who really cared about women's health would be pressing Planned Parenthood to discuss this ethical issue.  Both doctors caught in these stings seem very open to discussing skirting their ethical duties in order to subsidize their businesses.  They never said they had done it, they never said they will do it, but they are open to it.  If my wife saw a video where I said I had never cheated on her, and I never said I would cheat on her, but seemed as open to cheating as these doctors do to altering procedures for financial incentives, I would have a lot of explaining to do to Mrs. gnujack."

Morality, like politics and economy, depends on human beings existing to have some kind of meaning.  You can't find the moral worth of something by looking at that thing. Moral worth is a value judgment we make and give on something. Morality is not intrinsically part of the universe, it is a system of how humans interact. It's like trying to find the rules of chess by looking at the pieces themselves. That's not how it works.

prolife,3dv803,PeterXP,0,Mon Jul 20 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  Atheists could assign value to making an oath to gods that they don't believe exist. The value of such oaths however have often far less to do with making the oath binding personally, and far more to do with social cohesion, to avoid being ostracized by their religious peers, or singled-out and shunned.  Atheists could also consider oaths to humans meaningless, and these atheists would most likely be either sociopaths, psychopaths, or anarchists. These people represent an incredibly small segment of any population, and odds are Christian sociopaths, psychopaths, and anarchists probably wouldn't fare much better with the oaths anyways.  So, while you are right in that my position was either self-contradictory or incomplete, I'd still say that in general it's correct, with small exceptions."

She essentially said yes, it would be permissible and when I questioned how she could believe such a thing when it directly conflicted with the ethical codes and moral standards entrusted to doctors she bogged down that stance and conceded saying ""I don't know"".  Truth is she has her own ethical standards that directly conflict with her professions code of ethics. It's not worth arguing with her, because if she is proven wrong, she'll most likely never admit to being a murderer.

But I can't guarantee the person I'm arguing with subscribes to that same moral code (I believe that it of course applies to them regardless).  Hoping you're in America.  My position on abortion is genuinely rooted in the Constitution.  I believe that government has a duty to protect the lives of Americans and that most definitely includes the weakest among us -- the lives of the unborn.  People nearly (over 99%, I'd say) believe that policy must comport with the Constitution.  So, at that level, it at least evens the playing field for discussion.

prolife,3dv803,VineyardPoloCrew,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you asked.  The vast majority of my study and research is ""public policy"" focused.  I'm of the belief that the ""best"" (or better) public policy is always a result of two things.   The Politics The Policy   Now, a good policy can be passed when one is awful and one is strong.  For example, imagine a scenario where the POLICY behind allowing abortion is awful (as I suspect we hold it is).  But, if the POLITICS are right -- capitalizing on women's rights or something along those lines -- then the policy can be pushed through.  You saw this with Obamacare.  Many across party lines would have told you then and will tell you now that the policy is flawed.  But, the politics were right.  So it passed.  On the other hand, occasionally there is a policy that is SO good that it must transcend politics.  You see this recently with the human trafficking bill.  It passed the Senate unanimously.  Now, to be sure, there were most likely provisions in that bill that each party had a problem with (whether directly related to the human trafficking aspect or not) BUT the overall policy is so good the politics must be forgotten.  So, ""public policy"" is made based upon whichever side can develop and then persuade the American people is the better policy AND when the politics add up.  Abortion is a tremendously difficult issue for public policy because it's very black and white.  For the Left, the politics are correct and for the Right, the policy is correct.  Also compounding the issue is that the issue now draws upon a wider base of policy considerations with complicate political support.  For example, the Left can draw upon the policy of women's rights to gain political support for abortion, which may allow them to persuade some folks who are against the policy (""I personally wouldn't do it but it's not my choice"").  So, in that sense, it takes more than just good policy to become policy."

I'm not sure what you mean by the question, but a bit of reading here seems to indicate that abortion wasn't really illegal in most of the USA prior to 1821, and in 1900 all states had laws in place restricting abortion, with some provisions in the case of medical necessity. Only 5 states had abortion being a crime before quickening (the 24th week mark, ish), but on the whole abortion was illegal and could not be sought, except for medical needs.  Abortion remained taboo for another 50 years, until rubella epidemics and thalidomine medication began producing babies physically deformed and mentally impaired, facts which the burgeoning feminist movement used as part of their efforts to get abortion legalized. Source here.  Roe v Wade changed that when a woman sued the state of Texas for the right to have an abortion as a private medical procedure. The Supreme Court voted 7-to-2 that abortion was a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, and that the state needed to demonstrate a compelling reason to forbid an abortion.  In short, abortion was made illegal in the 1800's, remained illegal until the 1950s, and then USA made a huge U-turn by making abortion not only legal, but also a fundamental right of the mother, in one fell swoop.

The empiricist gave a popular lecture in which he said that all life could be nothing more than a dream, and our senses are fooled just as they are in dreams.  The one student wasn't having it.  The other said ""But how do you refute it?""  The first student picked up a stick and whacked the second student and said ""I refute it thus.""  If this abortionist found out that her family's grave had been vandalized, she would be outraged, not talking about how ""all morality is illusion."""

prolife,3dv803,jamesberullo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:33 2015 UTC,"the abortionist can do whatever the abortionist wants because ""morality doesn't exist.""   Outside of human scope.   Morality doesn't exist outside of a human scope in the same way that tastes doesn't exist outside of the human scope.   If there were no humans on the planet to describe 'sweetness', then sweetness would cease to exist. 'Sweetness' is how our brains feel that we are eating sugar. There is nothing at all in sugar that makes it sweet, or have the property of being sweet. The sweetness does not come from the sugar, it comes from our tongues.  In the same way, morality exists when we are talking about two humans interacting. If there is a single human being left on the planet, or if there are no human beings left at all, then morality is either meaningless or ceases to exist."
prolife,3dv803,BCRE8TVE,4,Mon Jul 20 12:29:35 2015 UTC,That's only true if you believe there is not an objective standard for morality.
prolife,3dv803,jamesberullo,0,Mon Jul 20 12:40:10 2015 UTC,"I believe there is an objective standard for morality, the same way I believe there are objective rules to chess. Objective morality just means that there are rules for governing what is moral and what isn't, and that those rules are not subjected to a specific person's personal preferences. Objective morality doesn't mean it's the best view of morality, that it's an accurate view of morality, or that it's a view of morality that doesn't change.   Objective morality only means that there are rules by which you can tell if something objectively is morally good or morally wrong. If I decide that running across the highway is morally good, I can say that building walls to stop people from running across the highway is objectively morally bad, given the premise that running across highways is morally good.  What you are talking about is an absolute moral standard, one that doesn't change with time, that is declared to be absolutely correct, and that applies to everyone at all times and situations."
prolife,3dv803,BCRE8TVE,3,Mon Jul 20 12:45:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, you're right given the definition of objectivity that you are using, but you essentially redefined objective to mean subjective. What you are saying is that ""objective"" moral standards are subjective to how a person wants to define them. Objective standards, in the sense that those words are used by the vast majority of people, refer to what you would consider absolute standards, but even that definition is flawed. An absolute standard would not be one single objective standard which is universally applicable but rather the parent set which holds all the objective standards which define morality for any given situation. I suppose that semantically, your definition is better, but you still sidestepped the point. The ""objective"" morality you have defined makes no claim to truth, and therefore is not objective in any useful sense. I can reject your objective standard out of hand because you assert it out of hand.  That is to say, for a moral standard to be objective, it cannot simply be a means of measuring whether a given thing is moral. It needs to objectively assert its validity as an objective standard."
prolife,3dv803,jamesberullo,0,Mon Jul 20 13:16:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, you're right given the definition of objectivity that you are using, but you essentially redefined objective to mean subjective.   Objective:not influenced by personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudice; based on facts; unbiased:   being the object of perception or thought; belonging to the object of thought rather than to the thinking subject (opposed to subjective ).   Subjective: existing in the mind; belonging to the thinking subject rather than to the object of thought (opposed to objective ).   pertaining to or characteristic of an individual; personal; individual: a subjective evaluation.  placing excessive emphasis on one's own moods, attitudes, opinions, etc.;   Although there is also this definition of objective:  of or relating to something that can be known, or to something that is an object or a part of an object; existing independent of thought or an observer as part of reality.   All the above definitions come from dictionary.reference.com by the way.  I think the way I defined objective, politics and economy would be seen as something that is objective, though neither politics nor economy would exist if there weren't brains around to conceive of them. I may be wrong, but if you were to say that the way I define objective makes it the same as subjective, then by that same definition then the rules of chess would be subjective as well.   What you are saying is that ""objective"" moral standards are subjective to how a person wants to define them.   Yes. This seems to be true no matter what, because it's usually the case in these discussions that moral standards are subjective to either how a person or groups of person wants to define them, or subjective to how God defines them. I agree with both those statements, though I don't think God exists. However, once the subjective basis of morality has been defined (ie health is good harm is bad) then we can objectively see what actions would lead to the consequences we want to see, we could objectively see what is better and what is worse.   An absolute standard would not be one single objective standard which is universally applicable but rather the parent set which holds all the objective standards which define morality for any given situation.   I'm not sure I understand this. Can you elaborate for me please?   The ""objective"" morality you have defined makes no claim to truth, and therefore is not objective in any useful sense.    It makes claims to truth in the sense that an objective morality, as I have defined it, can tell you what is objectively moral, immoral, or amoral, given a set of predefined goals. If we subjectively decide that morality is about well-being, then we can see that killing people is objectively immoral.  I'm not sure I understand what kind of claim to truth it would take for you to accept how I defined objective. The way I see it, there is no truth about morality to be found in the universe itself. Morality is how we attribute judgment to something, so to find morality we have to look at what we mean by it. Looking for morality in the universe is like trying to find 'wet' in the ocean. There is nothing in the ocean that intrinsically gives it the property of 'wet', you can't find 'wet' by looking at the chemical composition of sea water.   That is to say, for a moral standard to be objective, it cannot simply be a means of measuring whether a given thing is moral. It needs to objectively assert its validity as an objective standard.   Certainly fair enough. I defined objective more in the sense of the structure of morality, and not its content. I'm not making some claim as to some morality or another being an objective standard that all others must either obey or comply with, I'm simply stating that in order for a set of morals to be objective, it must comply with the way I've defined it. It's like I'm saying how you must build your foundation and walls for a house to be solidly built, and you're saying that I haven't shown how the house I built isn't the best.  I'm not asserting that my model of objective morality is the best or most accurate, I'm saying that if a system of morality doesn't fit within the definition of objective I have given, then it's not a system we can use to make objective moral judgments. It's not a standard, it's how we see whether the standard we set is consistent/not subjective."
prolife,3dv803,TrustedAdult,3,Mon Jul 20 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"I'll try and explain myself more directly. You are correct, semantically, and as I have already acknowledged, the way you are addressing objectivity is probably better than the traditional way of looking at it. However, most people do not look at it the same way. When they refer to objective standard, they are referring to what you would consider an absolute standard. The dictionary definitions you cited can be taken for either interpretation. All I was trying to say is that despite being right and speaking more accurately than most people, you are actually obfuscating the issue of morality, not assisting the discussion.    I'm not sure I understand this. Can you elaborate for me please?   Let's take the objective moral statement that killing is wrong. That could certainly be an absolute moral standard, but for all practical purposes, few people would consider it to be such. Instead, they would say that different objective standards should be applied in different situations. Is killing wrong if doing so would actually save other lives? Is killing wrong if done in war? Is it wrong if done as euthanasia? We can answer those questions many different ways, but my point is that for most, the absolute moral standard would be comprised of various objective moral standards. It would not be [Killing is wrong.] but rather [Killing is wrong, except in cases of A, B, and C. It is wrong in the case of D but not when condition E is applied...]. Absolute moral standards are generally a set of objective standards, not one given standard.  I am a bit short on time now but I'll try to illustrate my larger point through your chess analogy later."
prolife,3dv803,TrustedAdult,2,Mon Jul 20 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing normative ethics and meta-ethics which you seem to get when you say:   I defined objective more in the sense of the structure of morality, and not its content. I'm not making some claim as to some morality or another being an objective standard that all others must either obey or comply with   I understand objectivity in meta-ethics to mean there are mind-independent facts about how people ought to act and objectivity in normative ethics to mean there is an established standard (based on mind-independent facts or not) by which actions are judged.  So if you take a principle like ""what's right is to maximize the happiness for most and minimize suffering for the most"" then you can (ignoring problems with ""happiness"" or ""suffering"" calculations) arrive at what is the best course of action.  When people talk about objective morality usually they're not talking about normative ethics."
prolife,3dv803,TrustedAdult,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing normative ethics and meta-ethics    Certainly could be the case. I'm not nearly as well-read in the subject of ethics as I would like to be.  After reading the wiki page on normative ethics, I think you are right, and I was conflating ethics with meta-ethics.   When people talk about objective morality usually they're not talking about normative ethics.   What do people on here mean then when they say that morality is objective?"
prolife,3dv803,TrustedAdult,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:27 2015 UTC,"I'll try to explain with your chess analogy. I'm not extremely well read in ethics either but I will try to explain it in practical ways, which means I might get a few things semantically wrong. To be honest, a lot of philosophical and ethical discussions get bogged down when we insist on rigorous rhetoric.  You could say that for practical purposes, we can describe 4 levels of objectivity. Suppose that there were rules for chess but players could choose to follow them or not. If we were playing and I wanted my pawn to move like a bishop, a set of rules that allowed that would be purely subjective because it allows players to determine the rules they want to follow. That is the first level, which we can call subjectivity. In real life, that would be comparable to a purely subjective moral standard where people can decide what they believe is moral.  The second level would be what you have called ""objective"". That would be rules of chess which say that they must be followed by players. Pieces must move in certain ways, players must take turns, etc. This is an objective standard by which to judge people playing chess. In real life, this is like the moral standard you have described, which allows for moral behaviour to be judged rigorously and objectively. You refer to this as objective, and I think you are right in doing so, but most do not.  The third level is the one that most people consider objective. The second level lets you judge things from an objective perspective. The third level states that it is the standard which must be used to be judged. In chess, this would mean that the rules say you must follow them if you wish to play chess. You cannot play chess if you are not following the rules; if you do, it is no longer chess. The difference is that the second does not include that requirement. The second says that players must follow the rules, but it does not say that the rule requiring players follow the rules must be followed. That is to say, a third-level standard states that it is an accurate and true standard. This distinction is important, because without such a requirement, most would say that the rules are defacto subjective. Regarding morality, the same thing applies. While a standard might be second-level objective, if it does not make a claim regarding its validity as a standard, it might as well not be objective because it is not an applicable standard. If you say that murder is wrong, but you do not say that standard is applicable and true, then the standard cannot be applied to someone who disagrees with the standard. A third-level objective standard is one which which is applicable regardless of perception about its applicability.   The fourth level is the one that gives authority and validity to the third-level standards. It could be split into two levels, a level of 'absolute' standards defined as I have previously explained and a level which gives authority to the absolute standards, but then the chess comparison wouldn't work as well. To keep the analogy going, this fourth level would be the World Chess Federation which creates the rules and says they are valid. Now, we could create an infinite number of levels, each giving the subsequent level validity and authority, but let's stop here. When discussing morality, this is where God comes in. For most people, God is the fourth-level authority which gives validity to third-level standards, but that is not always the case. Some would say the physical nature of the universe ultimately dictates morality (I know you do not), and there are a myriad of other ways to find a fourth-level authority. Unrelated to the subject, but this is the reason many people question why atheists believe in moral standards, as without a fourth-level standard, you cannot give a reason for the validity of third-level standards, which means that you cannot necessitate the applicability of second-level standards.  Most of us on here are referring to third-level standards when we discuss objective morality. We try to remain as secular as possible, and keeping in the spirit of the American Constitution, we do not make it about the fourth level. When discussing policy, we tend to focus on the third-level standards which American policy is built on: human rights. When discussing abortion in a more philosophical manner, that is when we say that you need objective standards, referring to third-level objective standards. I don't really care which fourth-level standard you use to determine your third-level standards. Frankly, I don't think I can change your entire worldview about religion, so I don't much want to argue that when I am discussing abortion. The point is that if you deny ""objective morality"", meaning third-level standards, then there is no valid reason to believe in ""practical morality"", meaning second-level standards. I hope that this makes it a bit easier to understand where we come from regarding objective morality.   I'd also say that for practical purposes, objectivity is not the ideal word to use when discussing second-level morality. Like I've said, you are semantically right, but I think that would be better referred to as practical morality."
