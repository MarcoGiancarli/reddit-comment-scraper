CullenMancers,3e0fri,StarryEyedGamer,10,Tue Jul 21 00:21:08 2015 UTC,"I romanced him with both a Lavellan First and a mage Trevelyan, since I play almost exclusively mages.   While Samahl Lavellan has awesome lipstick, I really didn't enjoy the way I perceived her dynamic with Cullen.  She didn't really know humans, and she knew almost nothing of the Circle or Templars.  She didn't feel prepared for what she was getting into, and with some of the decisions she made (siding Templar, for example, and accidentally getting her clan killed), I feel like she was seeking his approval in ways that almost made the whole damned thing feel skeevy.  My mage Trevelyan, on the other hand, really did feel older to me, and more like she'd been around the block.  She sided mage, so she got to see a whole lot more of Cullen, and she felt more independent and less trusting.  It felt more like a relationship of equals, so I liked that dynamic a lot better.  Plus, of course, being a Circle mage opens up other dialogues with him, so there's that."
CullenMancers,3e0fri,yesthatnagia,5,Tue Jul 21 01:03:28 2015 UTC,I romanced him with both as mages and I liked Trevelyan more pure story wise. The only time being an elf was brought up was once and just a passing thought really.   I found Trevelyan being from a circle made a more interesting dynamic between the two.
CullenMancers,3e0fri,myrrar,3,Tue Jul 21 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"I liked my mage human romance most of all.  A Circle mage, especially one from the Free Marches, would have a very good idea of what exactly it is that Cullen's been through, and what he is trying to atone for. Kirkwall was bad, and Cullen was Meredith's second-in-command. He's seen mages do some terrible things, and he's almost certainly done some terrible things himself. Talk to him about the Tranquil conspiracy sometime in DA2--it is not a nice conversation.  So for me, the fact that Cullen and a Circle mage can get over this divide makes the whole game a lot more hopeful. When I went with the mages and then killed Samson, Cullen was like, ""Hey, a bunch of Templars are joining up!"" And I thought, Templars joining up with the remnants of the mage rebellion? Maybe we can all heal, and there doesn't have to be another war.  At the end of the game, when he's like, ""Thanks for taking a chance on me,"" I felt like we both really had taken a chance."

CullenMancers,3e0fri,theRadioStarr,5,Wed Jul 22 05:01:12 2015 UTC,"I romanced him first with my Mage Trevelyan (first name Ceranna, yeaaaa).    I liked their dynamic even since her personality is similar yet contrasting enough that it definitely was a relationship between two adults.  In my head, my Inquisitor was actually a year or two older then Cullen!    My second one is a sassy, ridiculous, and young Rogue Lavellan who is currently caught between Solas and Cullen.  She's cute as pie (freckles all over her face!) but I guess personality wise imagine a Dalish Sera that's less annoying...  Surprisingly though, my favorite play through has been as a Qunari Mage that romances The Iron Bull.  There's something about stomping through the Hinterlands and crushing my enemies while wearing a Flower tiara that's just amazing"
CullenMancers,3e0fri,ceranna,2,Tue Jul 21 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"My main is a Trevelyan mage. I just realized I haven't played much else besides her, haha. Mostly because my very first playthrough was the same; but I missed so many companion quests due to bugs, and the game is so enormously vast that I felt very disconnected from the characters and story, since I spent SO much time running around trying to complete maps.   This playthrough (with the Trevelyan in the pic), I did all the map side-quests first, then started the story, but I'm not even technically finished yet xD. I tried rolling a Lavellan to romance Solas but the moment I got to the first cutscene with Cullen I was like AW CMON (i'ma bang him)."

CullenMancers,3e0fri,theRadioStarr,2,Wed Jul 22 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"Hehehee, no.  While Anast basically is a Dalish Atheist (inspired by my Jewish Atheist friends from college), she also gets WAY too annoyed at Solas for his incessant ""The Dalish are doing it wrong"" commentary."
CullenMancers,3e0fri,Crystallyne27,5,Wed Jul 22 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"I'm all about the mage!Lavellan.  I think I've explained before how I feel about it - while yes, Lavellan is pretty new to the world outside of their Clan, I feel like Cullen has a strong protective instinct, so even with a mage, I feel like I can see him stepping into the role of, ""hey, probably best if you don't do that in future, here, relax, take these silver and go grab a few drink to unwind, it'll be okay.""   Plus there's the whole, ""I'm a Dalish falling for a shem"" dynamic too, and the racial stigmas of both peoples that they'll both have to compete against.   I'm not doing a very good job of explaining it, but I personally feel like Cullen and Lavellan overcoming their differences and falling for each other is a much more compelling story than two humans who happen to work together and don't have cultural differences separating them.   Not that I disliked my mage!Trevelyan romance with him, I just... prefer my tiny elf next to him. He towers over her, it's kind of hot lol."

I had this idea that their bond was SO strong, that Alistair having to marry another woman wouldn't be an issue; they perhaps would even look at suitors together for him and end up having a really nice polyamorous relationship. I've rarely ever found anyone who isn't repulsed by that idea in the fandom, haha, but I don't care too much, tbh (sometimes the fandom cares TOO much about what other people do with their own OTP's, tbh).

CullenMancers,3c65hr,MaryPopNLockins,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:17:35 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm still nowhere near done my game time fic but I think I'm going to need to start this one very soon. I may do it as a series of shorts.
CullenMancers,3c65hr,khaosanomaly,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"The moment you said Scientist for Dorian, I thought of a cosmetics or beauty products developer...   That popular shampoo and soaps you love so much, Cullen? I made it, now tell me if this does anything for you? /hands over prototype cologne."
CullenMancers,3c65hr,ceranna,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"A chemist? I like it. He still gets to play with fire and since he's so vain, it works perfectly. Thank you!"
CullenMancers,3c65hr,ceranna,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"Oooo I like the idea that Bull owns a gym and the chargers are his employees!  You can even keep the name, ""We are the Chargers and We Will Charge You Up!""   Bull can be the flashy celebrity while it seems that Krem is the one in the background doing all the grunt work. Plus I bet there is a way to tie in Bulls spying for the Qunari"
CullenMancers,3c65hr,ceranna,2,Sun Jul 5 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"I want this whole thing to be super real world, so everyone's going to be human, but built a bit more like their racial builds, so Bull will be like a giant, probably about 6'6"" or 7"" and built like a lumberjack.   However, I could make a tie in to religious spying... Like if he's an inside member of ISIS here, but instead feeds Leliana information on them."
CullenMancers,3c65hr,dingoesatemycat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"This is super stereotypical but...  Instead of ISIS, what about North Korean?  The Qun seems to have more ties to Asian cultures then Middle Eastern, plus the whole rare/different looking would be a natural tie to Qunari."
CullenMancers,3c65hr,khaosanomaly,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's probably a better idea. Less touchy."
CullenMancers,3c65hr,dingoesatemycat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:07:37 2015 UTC,ISIS would be a good stand in for the Venatori though!    Actually that would be super cool with Dorian!  He could have left his country in disgust with the shift towards radicalism.
CullenMancers,3c65hr,dingoesatemycat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"I was discussing this with my boyfriend, and he thinks the North Korea idea is solid, but that I should leave ISIS out. He suggested Dorian fleeing his homeland over an arranged marriage (because that's kind of still canon to his character) and his parents disowning him for that reason - they don't know he's gay, but he comes out after he moves away.   It was brought to my attention on the Dorianmancers sub that he's actually supposed to be East Indian, if he were equated to our world. I always thought him more olive-toned Mediterranean, but if that's the official word from Gaider, that's what I'll go with. I just need to do some research into East Indian culture before trying to write out any of his backstory. I think he'll still be from a wealthy family who probably prioritized teaching him English though, so he'd be bilingual.   I'm wondering if the whole 'was supposed to be' is still what he actually is, though, because apparently they wanted at East Indian accent for him at first, too. Still haven't found the source for that particular piece of info on him, but I plan on looking further."
CullenMancers,3c65hr,Crystallyne27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:49:12 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of Dorian as a chemist, but could also see him as a weapons specialist of some kind who became frightened of the prospects of his research and is redefining his career (a la Tony Stark). Fits somewhat with his stance on Tevinter. And as a side note, I've really been enjoying your Lupa fic and will most definitely read the one you're working on now! And not just because you're situating it in my hometown as well ;) (btw I can also see Cullen as a resident of Parkdale who's been involved in its recent gentrification)."
CullenMancers,3c65hr,Crystallyne27,2,Sun Jul 5 18:50:50 2015 UTC,I think my mind just exploded with the thought of Dorian as Tony Stark in an avengers au or even just meeting Tony... Which is not helping my Cullen as Cap urges.
CullenMancers,3c65hr,Crystallyne27,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:08:15 2015 UTC,"Omg, Cullen as Cap...how did I never see the similarities??"
CullenMancers,3c65hr,blackink82,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"Ooh Parkdale, I like it. Lots of work for him there! And Victorian era homes? He'd be in so much business lol. Is Dorian his roomie, though, or just his best friend?   Would a weapons specialist need to be employed by the military though? I wasn't really thinking he would be.   Also I'm really sorry, I've edited this like four times - I'm at work and keep losing my train of thought. I'm so glad you're enjoying my current doc! Sorry the updates are taking so long now. But there's still plenty more to come, I haven't forgotten about it."
CullenMancers,3c5uet,khaosanomaly,2,Sun Jul 5 02:40:20 2015 UTC,There's a pirate Cullen?  O_o. Where??    That's been a need of mine for awhile now.  To the point where I'm working on my own short story lol
CullenMancers,3c5uet,ceranna,2,Sun Jul 5 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"My guiltiest AU for Cullen (well, besides ""under pressure precious things can break"") is probably a modernized AU where the Circle is more a university system.  I like imagining him as a very frazzled final year Templar student (and barracks RA) whose academic focus is military history."
CullenMancers,3c5uet,yesthatnagia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"Recently had the idea for a modern/real life AU - I need Cullen as a private contractor, covered in paint and sawdust but otherwise super hygienic and with shoulder length hair.   I'm still trying to work out the details but I don't know, I feel the need for this AU in my bones. It's not exactly trash heap worthy, but I thought I'd share anyway."
CullenMancers,3c5uet,theRadioStarr,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:54:02 2015 UTC,Working blue collar Cullen? I second that notion! Especially if he has shoulder length hair. Would it be horribly curly or wavy? For some reason I'm thinking something akin to Zoisite from Sailor Moon. Lol
CullenMancers,3c5uet,theRadioStarr,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:23:55 2015 UTC,"Like it's super straight at the roots and he just pushes it back but they curl up around his collar in like, 1 inch curls.   I swoon over that hair every time I see it."
CullenMancers,3c5uet,xStephyG,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:41:51 2015 UTC,Vampire/Succubus Inky is in my WIP pile at this very moment. Just complete trash. =D  Summary and my freaking out about it being so cliche.
CullenMancers,3c5uet,Khirsahle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:20:29 2015 UTC,"Oh Maker, yes! I actually had the idea that Cullen's stint with desire demons or at least Kinoch may have made him a pseudo vamp/sex demon due to a non!Warden Amell/Surana making a deal to protect him but it goes horribly sideways. Or something I don't know. Lol  Feels like I'll be using the same plot device from my Red Lyrium/werewolfish Cullen fic that.... I have yet to post here, whoops."
CullenMancers,3c5uet,Denimjo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention but this is a guilty pleasure and probably slightly off topic but...   Honestly I keep wanting to read/write a fic where Cullen is hung like a Qunari. An average Qunari probably (thinking humans are average around 6/7inches erect, with Qun being twice that--maybe). Just something funny and something perhaps an Inquizzy being too damn ""oh my Maker"" crazy about after that infamous Wicked Grace seen"
CullenMancers,3c5uet,ceranna,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"cough Chantry Brother cough  Templar works for me, but forbidden priest romance reaaaallly works for me."
CullenMancers,3c5uet,Denimjo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:37:00 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Cullen and Norrington from the Pirates of the Caribbean series were fairly similar, so I've pictured Cullen in a similar role (naval commander charged with taking down evil pirates)."
CullenMancers,3c247o,theRadioStarr,2,Sat Jul 4 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"I think you're spot on with early rock/old blues/Elvis,  Maybe some gospel or Beatles. Probably some Beethoven or Bach when he's laying in bed trying not to think about lyrium.  But when he's in a good mood and no one else is around, you better believe he turns up the Jackson 5 and sings and dances around his office."
CullenMancers,3c247o,steggo,2,Sat Jul 4 01:59:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with Beethoven or Bach but I love the idea of Cullen singing Jackson 5 in falsetto and nailing it. lol Thanks for the chuckle, you made my day."
CullenMancers,3c247o,YukariTanuki,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:21:15 2015 UTC,"Obviously, the same messenger walks in on this."
CullenMancers,3c247o,steggo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"lol Or Michel de Chevin. He roamed into Cullen's office when I was in there the other day and just walked into the other (closed) door, turned around and left through the open one like nothing happened."
CullenMancers,3c247o,YukariTanuki,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:27:30 2015 UTC,MOTOWN YES
CullenMancers,3c247o,RoraMitchell,2,Sat Jul 4 02:27:41 2015 UTC,"I think he'd listen to things with a lot of acoustic guitar, like Ed Sheeran's ""Thinking Out Loud"", Eddie Vedder's ""Hard Sun"", and Michael Schulte's cover of ""Mad World""."
CullenMancers,3c247o,steggo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"Ooh, good suggestion, I like it."
CullenMancers,3c247o,kelonwheels,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"Now I'm imagining him sneaking out to coffee houses and singing ""behind blue eyes"", Giles style"
CullenMancers,3buuey,Crystallyne27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:47:21 2015 UTC,He can totally pull it off.   Please pull it off.
CullenMancers,3btfji,AlphaLimaMike,4,Thu Jul 2 00:22:36 2015 UTC,Argh my heart can't handle this much feels .... :'(
CullenMancers,3btfji,mango_star,2,Thu Jul 2 06:28:39 2015 UTC,GAH!!!!  So many feels!!!
CullenMancers,3btfji,Crystallyne27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:49:12 2015 UTC,Sigh. So sweet.
CullenMancers,3brs0w,ifeelwitty,2,Wed Jul 1 16:58:37 2015 UTC,That's awesome!  But no Greendelle or LilyRutherford?  D:
CullenMancers,3brs0w,ceranna,2,Wed Jul 1 19:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right? I guess they don't submit their stuff for Bioware to see?"
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,Crystallyne27,3,Wed Jul 1 10:24:50 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of Val forming a relationship with Solas. She's already said she gave up the idea of ever being with Cullen again, even if seeing him might have triggered some feelings. Her and Cullen could ease into a tentative friendship, since they have to work together so much. Solas charms her into a romantic endeavor that, as we all know, ends poorly for her. Cullen has, of course, been a bit jealous the whole time, but remained friendly for her sake. When Solas breaks it off, Cullen is there to support her. Their relationship kindles  anew!"
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,4shitsngiggles,2,Wed Jul 1 11:54:44 2015 UTC,"I need to consider this, I'm not sure.  I never intended for Valaina to enter a true romantic relationship with Solas, but there may come a point when she finds herself questioning the possibility of being closer to him.  It's something I'm now mulling over in my head...  I'm too much of a romantic.  I want Cullen and Val back together already, damn it!  HAHAH!!!"
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,4shitsngiggles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:11:34 2015 UTC,Imagine how much more satisfying their reunion would be after so much angst! :p
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,ceranna,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:39:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've definitely thought of that.  heheheh"
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,itriedtoquitreddit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:47:53 2015 UTC,Ooo I like this!
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,KittyDrakeheart,2,Wed Jul 1 19:50:38 2015 UTC,ugh no solas please  he's so creepy
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,insideofadog,2,Fri Jul 3 13:52:05 2015 UTC,HAHAHAHA!!!
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,steggo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:24:28 2015 UTC,"I quite like the idea of something perhaps almost blossoming between Val and Solas, this then obviously causing some conflicting emotions for both Cullen and Val. It could be what Cullen would need to see that he can't move on from her, but then also bringing about the debate about what the future could hold for the two of them, with Cullen willingly keeping his mouth shut (for a time) because he wants her to be happy. As you said yourself it is something that's been used countless times in fics but then again it feels like most things are these days! And I personally don't mind reading the same kinds of ideas as long as they're well written because everyone has their own style so that makes enough difference for me. Rant over :P edit: Clearly wasn't done! They could always reconcile when you plan and then have the option of jealous Cullen. The paranoia of his jealousy would also tie in nicely as perhaps something of a symptom of his lyrium withdrawal as well ...okay now I think I'm done haha"
CullenMancers,3bqlm1,ceranna,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:17:51 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with playing with tropes. People have been baking cakes for a long time but I still like cake!  Why not write the chapter with your new idea and if you don't like it, toss it? I often write something, find the hook of an idea or snippet of conversation I want in it, then throw the rest away and spin off of that one more-interesting moment."
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,AlphaLimaMike,4,Mon Jun 29 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"I love this photo so much, and I don't even know why.  He just seems more centered, I guess, more put together and in control."
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,lies_like_lavender,3,Mon Jun 29 21:37:09 2015 UTC,I think I'm in love with that little bit of chubbiness he's got going on. All soft and pudgy!
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,lies_like_lavender,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:14:47 2015 UTC,Isn't it just adorable?
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,xStephyG,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"I need to cuddle it. Like, yesterday."
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,PoesRaven,2,Tue Jun 30 01:06:27 2015 UTC,The goatee is a staple in my Cullen's appearance. I can't play if he's got the full scruff.
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,xStephyG,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:05:37 2015 UTC,Awesome pics.. is he playable in the Jaws of Hakkon? (I don't have it)
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,PoesRaven,2,Tue Jun 30 20:01:25 2015 UTC,No. No temporary companions in JoH. Those were in the prologue on the way to the Temple of Sacred Ashes.
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,xStephyG,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"oh, derp. Hehe been a while since I saw that. I wish he was playable."
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,Crystallyne27,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:10:40 2015 UTC,"It must be just me, but I actually don't like the goatee. I much prefer the stubbly look he has in DA:I. Everyone's different, obviously!"
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,ceranna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"I fell for a sweet, shy Templar Knight in Kinloch Hold five years ago who had a goatee, fell in love all over again two years later with the angry Knight-Captain he turned into (who also had a goatee). I needed my strong, handsome Commander to have a goatee, as well.  He just seemed wrong without it."
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,Zero_Teche,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"I've gotta agree with AlphaLimaMike on this, but I totally understand where Stephy is coming from!  heheheh  XD"
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,ceranna,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:11:59 2015 UTC,The goatee is back!!  Now I'm imagining Dorian teasing Cullen mercilessly about it.
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,gabtinha,0,Tue Jun 30 01:54:25 2015 UTC,Isn't he close to that age now though?
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,ceranna,7,Tue Jun 30 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"No, he's apparently only 29 in DA:I, which kinda blows my mind."
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,Zero_Teche,4,Tue Jun 30 04:32:27 2015 UTC,"I decided that he is around 33 to 35 in my head... I cannot cope with the 29, seems so young!"
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,ceranna,3,Fri Jul 3 03:48:03 2015 UTC,I do the same thing!
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,Zero_Teche,2,Fri Jul 3 04:55:53 2015 UTC,rhat means he was like 17 In origins.
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,quartzquandary,3,Tue Jun 30 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, well at least 18/19. In the latest World of Thedas, they say that he was placed in Kinloch at 18, and was barely a year there when the events of a Broken Circle happens."
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,ceranna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:49:43 2015 UTC,Interesting. I need that book.
CullenMancers,3bk3f1,quartzquandary,2,Wed Jul 1 03:45:27 2015 UTC,That... can't be right. What?!
CullenMancers,3bkzrf,ceranna,2,Tue Jun 30 02:03:14 2015 UTC,"So it officially begins! I actually love that burning muscle, I-actually-did-something-healthy-for-once feeling. Hope it goes away soon though!  My Monday was pretty good actually, aside from a few blisters. Went out for breakfast with my irl boyfriend, then did a bit of shopping before coming home and booting up the PC and PS4. All-in-all a good day.   Speaking of Carver, I just started a new playthrough of DA2 on PC (and one of my mods made an absolutely hilarious thing happen)... I was wondering what happened to all the DLC? None of it shows on Origin at all."
CullenMancers,3bkzrf,theRadioStarr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"I love/hate it haha.  But its summer so I'm ready for summer sports and swimming!  Much swimming!  And oh god, those glitches are awesome.  I love the random rainbow road.  Do you have monday off?  Jealous :D"
CullenMancers,3bkzrf,theRadioStarr,2,Tue Jun 30 03:05:09 2015 UTC,"I get Mondays and Wednesdays, usually. Monday off would be better if I also got one of the weekend days off, but working in retail/grocery/I don't really know what to call my job officially means working literally all weekend, every weekend."
CullenMancers,3bkzrf,theRadioStarr,2,Tue Jun 30 03:17:20 2015 UTC,"means working literally all weekend, every weekend.   e_e that's a soul killer right there.    Jobs...why you gotta be like thiss"

CullenMancers,3bkzrf,theRadioStarr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:02:09 2015 UTC,"Just FYI that graphic issue isn't from Mods.  There's an issue with the most recent graphics drivers processing the graphics.  If you revert to an old graphics driver (you'd have to look online to find out which one for your card) it will display fine.  The other alternative is to select DirectX 7 instead of DirectX 9 in your graphics options.  The graphics may not be as good, but I know for me it really doesn't make much difference.  You may see other graphic issues like missing body parts (like heads) that is also due to this issue.  I'd rather have the slight graphics loss and enjoy my game then have the graphics issue.  lol"
CullenMancers,3bkzrf,Crystallyne27,2,Tue Jun 30 08:41:18 2015 UTC,"I couldn't stop laughing, but I can't go the entire game with only Aveline's head lol. I'll try that, thank you! We did just recently upgrade to a 960(?) so that's likely the problem."
CullenMancers,3bkzrf,theRadioStarr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"HAHAHA!!!!  Yeah, I get very immersed in the game when I'm playing, so having graphics issues like that feels like a slap in the face drawing me out of the immersion.  LOL  Poor Aveline!!!  XD"

It looks like it'll be a long chapter, already over 4000 words.  Most of my chapters run between 4000-6000 words.  But I still have at least two more scenes to write, or more!!  I don't really feel like I can break them up into two different chapters, for the flow of the story.  We'll see how it turns out!  XD"
CullenMancers,3bkzrf,AlphaLimaMike,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:11:49 2015 UTC,Yeah sometimes that happens. My chapter tend to average the same (around 9 pages) and one of them ended up being 12 pages long... I thought it would never end! But don't worry about it being uniform. It doesn't need to be!
CullenMancers,3bkzrf,gabtinha,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:39:44 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm not worried about uniformity of chapter lengths.  heheheh  My longest chapter so far was my ""Broken Circle"" chapter, which was over 6800 words.  My shortest chapter was only 2790 words.  So there's some definite fluctuation between chapters.  heheh  The one I'm working on right now is when they meet with the Chantry in Val Royeaux, and then meet Sera and Vivienne.  I'm probably going to cut at least one of those meetings short, like mention in passing that Viv joins them, possibly in a different manner than in the game.  There's some story specific content in there adding to the length.  heheh"

Anatomy and physiology is kind of my thing, and even though advanced A&P is hard, I know I'm not going to fail. It's just so hard to concentrate with all the other shit going on: today my husband had his PET and CAT scans done so that next week when we meet with his oncologist, we'll have a better idea of what we're dealing with. Fucking cancer, man. I wish it were me instead of him."

Oh, and that irresistible smirk he gets after a kiss?   And hi Gabtinha :) I am working on the sketch for you tonight."
CullenMancers,3bi0nz,Ccino,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:07:24 2015 UTC,Ahhh that scar!!!!
CullenMancers,3bi0nz,insideofadog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:24:43 2015 UTC,...is a mystery. :D
CullenMancers,3bi0nz,insideofadog,2,Wed Jul 1 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I was all where did they pull the Cullen X m!Hawke pairing from? Keep forgetting Cullen was in DA2.   s2g Cullen in DA:O/2 is a beast of a completely different hairdo than Cullen in Da:I"

CullenMancers,3bd8b3,RoraMitchell,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:58:43 2015 UTC,Tonight meaning Sunday night? And is there any information on how he's receiving recommendations? I just looked at Twitter and didn't see anything concrete...
CullenMancers,3bd8b3,theRadioStarr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:03:33 2015 UTC,It went until about 2230h PDT Saturday.
CullenMancers,3bc0f7,AlphaLimaMike,3,Sat Jun 27 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, darlin'.  As we used to say back in the LJRP world: RL > fandom.  You take care of yourself, work through what you need to work through, and focus on getting through it.  Try not to feel obligated about the fic: you'll finish it when you finish it, and we'll all just be thrilled to read."
CullenMancers,3bc0f7,yesthatnagia,3,Sat Jun 27 21:05:40 2015 UTC,"I know I'm not the first one to say it, but please don't worry about apologizing.   You need to take care of real life things first. That's understandable, and if anyone gets their knickers in a twist over it, then they're just... not very good people.   I did just snoop in your posting history, out of curiousity, and I'm sending you another big, long internet hug, okay? I'm really sorry to read that, and I'm sending some positive vibes your way. I know it's not much, but it's sadly the best I can offer. Just know that if you need to talk about anything, you can send me a PM - I'll be more than happy to listen, and I'm sure even the community here would be happy to help you through if you needed more support, too.   If you've been enjoying writing, then maybe you'll find it to be a good coping method (that's not the right term, but the word I wanted to use literally just escaped me as I was about to type it in).  Don't be afraid to take some time to yourself and let words hit the page if you need to - even if you never publish them, even if they're just for you, and only you. Find something that gives you strength, and make sure you have access to it when you need."
CullenMancers,3bc0f7,theRadioStarr,2,Sun Jun 28 02:35:53 2015 UTC,I hope everything gets better for you soon. Take care of yourself!
CullenMancers,3bc0f7,Khirsahle,2,Sun Jun 28 02:53:35 2015 UTC,"I have so been there, not to the same extent as you, but I think all writers go through periods where it's very hard for them to keep going, for whatever reason.  Take care of yourself and your husband first and foremost.  That is all that matters!!"
CullenMancers,3bc0f7,Crystallyne27,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:50:02 2015 UTC,"You don't need to apologise. Really. When you finish we will all be here to read it, be sure about that! Take care of yourself. I can guarantee you that this is the most important for us here!"

CullenMancers,3bd40v,khaosanomaly,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:52:57 2015 UTC,"I like option 7 the best.  It looks good with the skin tone, and I think it'd look great out in the actual game play.  Oh, have you seen the hair mods for long pony tails/long hair for elves?  I'd think it'd look so good, especially for Lupa!"
CullenMancers,3bd40v,ceranna,2,Sun Jun 28 03:33:31 2015 UTC,"I had a kind of wavy/curly ponytail mod before, but I just updated it to a straight-hair long pony, because her hair is naturally very straight.   Now if someone talented and wonderful could make a long over-the shoulder braid with a bang fringe, I'd be in the Maker's bosom.   Thanks for the input! I thought 7 was a bit dark for what I was picturing but another person in the other thread suggested it, too, so I'll need to revisit it and see how it looks."

Your art is wonderful! ...and maybe having an art to go with my writing will be just want the doctor ordered for this block.  Anyway despite being late to this offer, I am definitely going to follow you on my seldom used Tumblr. ^"

I may not be able to promise you anything, but I'd love to get prompts and ideas from people in case I get an artist's block (is that an actual thing?), so please feel free to send me an Ask! :) If you could PM me a link to your fanfic, I will bookmark and read it when I can, and will also follow on Tumblr if you could PM me your account name. And if I find myself with extra time to draw new things, I will contact you. :)"
CullenMancers,3b10wd,insideofadog,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"Holy hell, that is some gorgeous art.  I'd be daft not to follow you!

It's been so good to find fun again :)"

CullenMancers,3av8ah,karinabean,3,Tue Jun 23 22:24:41 2015 UTC,I love that justkissalready is one of the tags the author uses. Every time I pull up a new chapter and I scroll past the tags it makes me chuckle to see that one particularly.
CullenMancers,3av8ah,thejilldonahue,2,Wed Jun 24 02:20:40 2015 UTC,Those gifs are amazing representations of how it's feeling. I read the whole thing in a day and now I'm just sitting here waiting for more. Got any other good recommendations for me to kill time with?

CullenMancers,3av8ah,VintageLydia,4,Wed Jun 24 04:21:40 2015 UTC,*places you gently in a containment field* it will happen eventually. When it does I'm sure it'll be perfect. I'm banking on them to be arguing and him to just grab her and kiss her. I feel like Celene will probably win Varric's bet.

As for tips and tricks, you can the FOV settings to zoom in closer to the subject of the shot than you would normally be able to.

CullenMancers,39oam0,Crystallyne27,5,Sat Jun 13 05:02:03 2015 UTC,Drools  I wish he was one of the companions. I would give anything to see him in action. The tiny bit we get during the Samson questline is not nearly enough.

CullenMancers,38p76b,StarryEyedGamer,17,Fri Jun 5 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a little very biased here.  I haven't romanced Solas, and I have no intentions to.  I loath speaking with him and want to punch his face every time he pops up.  Now Cullen, on the other hand...do you want a Disney prince?  A real man who deals with real problems and shows he has a huge capacity to change?  From DAO to DAI, Cullen has seen the absolute worst that humanity can throw together, from being mind raped in Origins to seeing the insanity of Meredith to almost crippling lyrium withdrawal, and yet through it all he still strives to be the best man he can.   He does feel guilty over how he acted in DA2, even if he was (in a way) completely justified.  As I said, he was mind raped in Origins.  Yet he was still able to turn it around and back Hawke against Meredith.  And in Inquisition, he wants to put his past behind him and focus on the future.  If you don't romance him, he does just fine.  He's capable of taking care of himself, which in a relationship is extremely important.  If you do romance him, he lets you in and accepts your help, and the gratitude you receive is breathtaking.    Then there's the physical aspect of it.  Cullen is gorgeous.  I don't know if you get shirtless/naked scenes with Solas, but you do with Cullen and Maker's Breath his ass is out of this world.  He's not cocky about it, either.    Oh, and here's the most important part about Cullen's romance; he doesn't lie to you.  Even about things where it would be in his best interest to.  Terrible things he's done in the past?  Yup.  Awful, crippling nightmares and headaches over lyrium withdrawal?  Yup.  Even honesty about how unsure he is about himself?  Yup.  He's such a perfect mix of fumbly and sexy that he's even more appealing, to me, than Alistair.  Because when he gets past the fumbly bit, Cullen is all smooth, suave, and sexy.  He knows what he's doing.  He knows what desks are for...  I'm a klutz in real life, and there's one particular scene with Cullen that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  I have an ex who made me feel like a fool for how klutzy I was...Cullen knows how to make even the klutziest woman feel sexy.  You want rambly?  There's some rambly reasons to leave the lying SOB that is Solas and enjoy a dashing ex Templar with a heart of gold."
CullenMancers,38p76b,Rhydnara,6,Fri Jun 5 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"Seems I have a thing for sweet yet sassy guys.  I was with Alistair in Origins, Fenris in DA2 (just couldn't handle an Anders so unlike Awakening), and now really considering Cullen.     I went with Solas at first because I was an elf and he was race gated, plus I heard that his romance was heartbreaking but good...well, a friend spoilered a bit for me so now I'm not so sure that sounds like fun, especially with his future unknown in general, let alone a romance.     If I loved Alistair's would I love Cullen's? I realize they are totally different people, but Alistair had is personal demons and such too to overcome. :)"
CullenMancers,38p76b,Rhydnara,8,Fri Jun 5 18:30:22 2015 UTC,"If you loved Alistair you will adore Cullen.  He's a little less innocent when it comes to sexy times than Alistair, but in terms of personality they are extremely similar."
CullenMancers,38p76b,Emptyplates,2,Fri Jun 5 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"Really?! I'm pretty much sold then....now, since I didn't do the personal quest for Solas, the dance or anything, I should be able to swap over to Cullen right? I hope."
CullenMancers,38p76b,Elorenalory,3,Fri Jun 5 18:56:01 2015 UTC,I need  a desk that big in my life. Your description was absolutely perfect. And exactly why I love Cullen so much.
CullenMancers,38p76b,AlphaLimaMike,6,Sat Jun 6 00:28:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't really jump ship. I created a mage Trevelyan to romance Cullen... needless to say, I never finished the game with my little elf that was supposed to romance Solas :( I finished DA:I twice as a rogue and a mage and romanced Cullen both times! I'm a lost cause, I think."
CullenMancers,38p76b,jfedoga,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:28:16 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with that though ;)
CullenMancers,38p76b,jfedoga,5,Sat Jun 6 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"I romanced Solas in my second playthrough (my first I romanced Blackwall, but found him so boring, I scrapped the entire thing).  I knew how it would end, and I did it anyway because he reminded me of my husband: bald, opinionated, and bitchy.  I thought I was prepared, and I wasn't: when he left, I was destroyed.  I felt as though my own husband had betrayed me.  So I started a new game and romanced Cullen.  No regrets!  He also reminds me of my husband: headaches and health problems, but so sweet and caring... I love both characters for what they represent, but Cullen is the better option, IMO."
CullenMancers,38p76b,Crystallyne27,5,Sat Jun 6 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"As for whether it's worth it, you're going to get some rather biased answers on this sub. :)  You should still be able to break up with Solas and switch to Cullen at this point. I don't think that first Cullen flirt option at Skyhold is required to get a relationship going later. I romanced Cullen in my first game, Solas in my third, and to be honest Solas's romance plot was fine, but low on content and so not quite the emotional gut punch for me that it is for a lot of people. If you think you're going to replay and do both romances it probably is worth doing Solas first, though. Since Solas only has one romance-only cut scene, doing it on a second playthrough doesn't feel like it adds much new content. Cullen has several romance-only scenes."
CullenMancers,38p76b,Crystallyne27,2,Fri Jun 5 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"Yeahhh, I mean, I get that he's a tragic character, and I want him to have his happiness, but without spoilers it obvoiusly wasn't resolved and I have no clue what the future will bring, so I mind as well get together with the would-be-bros-with-Alistair ;)     I feel a tad guilty, though.     It'd be a pain to be a human now, as I'd have to go through a bunch of levels I really don't want to do, but seeing as how my world state wasn't completely perfect when I made it, I mind as well? Plus I would see the progression of Cullen's romance from the get go. I could stay as an elf, but I really made her with the intention of Solas, so it feels a tad odd being one now but not with Solas, if that makes sense? For RPing purposes."
CullenMancers,38p76b,Fandabbidosy,6,Fri Jun 5 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"If you didn't flirt with Cullen up until now some of his responses are super cute, but it is a big time sink to restart. If you do decide to restart and pursue Cullen from the offset, I think it's worth doing it as a mage. It adds a layer of character development for him (and gives you that Templar/mage thing, if you go for that) and has a couple class-specific lines. I like cross-race romances, so elf mage is actually my favorite for Cullen. (I also wish I could have romanced Solas with an Andraste-worshipping human, because I go for that kind of dynamic and I guess I'm a bit contrary.) So I ended up with two female elf Inquisitors, distinguished  for RP purposes by age. Cullen's Quiz is in her 30s and experienced, while the one who went for Solas is about 19 and naive, because I see falling for Solas as a bit of a rookie mistake."
CullenMancers,38p76b,Atiesh,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely thinking I'll be a mage, as they're my favorite type in games. Rogues are fun and all, but not having any sort of barrier/health until I get guard gear and/or mage AI takes care of me is a bit hard....a bit undecided though."
CullenMancers,38p76b,YukariTanuki,2,Sat Jun 6 02:42:32 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Mages too, but I have to admit that I absolutely love Archers in this game.  For me they're more survivable, and work very well as an Inquisitor, for one reason: Stealth.  Getting attacked?  Drop into stealth, slip away, and resume attacks.  Plus you can attack while moving.  heheh  But I digress.  Mage + Cullen is a perfect pairing!!!"
CullenMancers,38ltam,sophe_s,4,Fri Jun 5 01:28:12 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind finding him in my kitchen every morning :) Would make waking up to go to work much more pleasant.

CullenMancers,38milf,gabtinha,2,Fri Jun 5 04:23:58 2015 UTC,"There are two ways you can add starting/end notes to your story.  One way is to add it while editing each individual chapter, and it should ONLY appear in that one chapter.  The other way is to edit the entire story.  When you're accessing your profile, click ""Works"" on the left.  This will bring up a list of all the stories you've posted on AO3.  There is an Edit button you can click there, which edits the entire story.  Clicking Edit will take you to a screen that looks very similar to the page where you edit an individual Chapter.  On that page will be a ""Notes"" section, where you can add starting and ending notes.  If your ending notes are appearing on multiple chapters, then I would suspect you added the ending note while editing the entire story, instead of that one chapter.  I have noticed that when adding an starting/ending note to the entire story, it will only appear under the most recent chapter, and subsequent chapters.  It doesn't actually appear on ALL chapters.  So it's kind of confusing.  I hope this helps.  It's kinda hard to explain.  heh"

CullenMancers,38hw3v,Crystallyne27,3,Thu Jun 4 09:19:24 2015 UTC,"I wrote very heavily in a different fandom a long time ago and one of the things that stopped me writing was that it began to feel more like a chore than something I actually wanted to do. I was updating stories for everyone else and not because I was enjoying writing any more.  The key to my coming back to fanfiction and my motivation was finally feeling excited again. For as long as I have written I've never been 100% happy with anything! When things begin to feel like a slog I tend to take a step back, leave things for a few days and then read it again once its completely out my mind. Fresh eyes make it easier to see either what is actually good! Or what it was I didn't like in the first place."
CullenMancers,38hw3v,KittyDrakeheart,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:50:59 2015 UTC,"I've been really distracted lately and feeling really guilty about not posting, but my problem is less that I don't want to write, and more that there are other things I'm more excited to be doing.   It's okay to take a break from writing if you feel like it's becoming a chore. However, writing at least something every day is good practice. I've definitely felt it when I went two weeks without even looking at my story.   My advice is actually the worst ever - I knew people were waiting on me to write something, and I felt guilty for not writing anything for so long, so I buckled down and wrote it. I'm sorry I have no better help for you :(   EDIT: I'm sorry, I meant to make this a separate comment, not a reply, and now I can't delete it because mobile -_-   ANOTHER EDIT: /u/VintageLydia just mentioned my vignettes (I'm going to be selfish and assume they're mine, because I think I'm the only one writing them as of right now, but if I'm wrong, I'm sorry). I got the idea to write more of them when I realized they're a great way to showcase my characters that normally don't get detailed parts in the main story. Maybe writing something like that on the side would help? Even if you do it strictly for yourself and never put it out there.   Also, another thing I forgot to mention: music. Believe me, listening to the right thing at the right time can do wonders for you."
CullenMancers,38hw3v,theRadioStarr,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:42:32 2015 UTC,That's quite alright :) I find it really interesting to see how differently people approach the same thing!
CullenMancers,38hw3v,KittyDrakeheart,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:56:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to write at least something every day!  I'm trying to make it a goal to write for an hour each day, but I need to allow myself to work on other stuff so I don't get burnt out on my main story.  :)  I like your suggestion of writing vignettes or side stories.  I might play with that a bit in future chapters.  :)  I also think I could work on stuff completely unrelated.  Hell, I've got a series that I've been wanting to write since high school.  Completely original to myself, and I've never done much with it.  lol  I have such a hard time listening to music when I'm writing.  I actually use ear plugs so I can focus completely.  I like the idea of listening to music while writing though, I may have to play around with that idea a bit more."
CullenMancers,38hw3v,theRadioStarr,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"Different people need different things - I find silence terrifying, like in a 'three-year-old with no nightlight' kind of way. So for me, music is so important when I'm working on something. I need the constant wash of sound, the steady beat to help my fingers move across the keys, and if I'm listening to the right music, if I get stuck, I just close my eyes and focus on actively listening for a bit.   But if it doesn't work for you, don't force it. Maybe try it one time, or for a few days in a row, and see how you feel about the amount of content you got done, and about the quality of the work. If you're finding it works for you, great! If not, don't feel like you've failed or something. Everyone works differently.   And let me tell you, once again, about how much fun my vignettes are. They're a challenge all on their own, writing your other intimidating characters who don't get much spotlight, and I'm trying a bunch of different styles for a bunch of them, too - making them more artsy, if that makes sense."
CullenMancers,38hw3v,KittyDrakeheart,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:05:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's kinda what I've ended up doing over the last month or so.

But the story was still percolating in the back of my mind, coupled with my guilt of not getting another chapter written, and it was becoming a constant drag on me emotionally.  I will say, though I made this post here, things have improved for me!  I've just sent my latest chapter to my proof readers, and hope to FINALLY have it updated in a couple days.  heh"

CullenMancers,38hw3v,VintageLydia,3,Fri Jun 5 07:42:10 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere recently where an author recommended just writing your way through a slump...If you're stuck in a section, just jot the basic stuff down, make a note, and get to a point in the story that is more inspiring to you, then go back and work on the trouble spot when you're in that zone.  From the stories I've read, I feel like many people get stuck to the game. Many of the most successful fics I've read have mixed things up a bit and focused on original content vs summing up the game. Your story specifically is not a novelization of the game, so don't get stuck too much on specifics"
CullenMancers,38hw3v,VintageLydia,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"Excellent suggestion, and something I've had a hard time doing but I should work on.  Just sit down and write things out.  I tend to be very self critical, and get frustrated when it's not coming to me as smoothly as it usually does.  But just getting the ideas down and working through them, without judging myself on how crappy it sounds, would be a really big help I think.  :)  Something for me to work on!!  And yeah, I'm trying to find ways to avoid ""rehashing"" the game storyline.  That's been part of my dilemma with these chapters, figuring out how I'm going to proceed.

CullenMancers,38hw3v,alexanndrian,2,Thu Jun 4 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"An author once told his audience that if a chapter is boring to write, it's boring to read.

CullenMancers,38hw3v,sophe_s,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"I think this is why I'll probably never write fanfic the way most people do (if ever at all.) I hate the format of writing chapters in order then releasing them as I finish. My stories change so so much from start to finish that my first draft is down right incomprehensible until I can go back and fix things (everything from minor character quirks to major plot points.)  The first thing I'd suggest is writing an outline. I do separate outlines for each major plot thread than figure out how everything fits together afterward (my current story will have 3 major threads: what the main character is doing, what the antagonist is doing, and what a group of secondary characters in another location is doing.) Do whatever works for you, but having a clearish road map from point A to point B can help you figure out those transition scenes.  Secondly I'd consider writing the scenes you want to write then write the transitions later (editing it afterward to make it more smooth.) Then release the entire work once it's finished. Or do what at least one author here does and write in vignettes (which is super easy to do in fanfic because we are all so very familiar with the source material. Fill in the blanks between quests. Or expand things, like obviously it would take more than 4 people to storm and take over Suledin Keep, but gameplay prevented how something like that would actually be done, so write about that.)"
CullenMancers,38hw3v,xeferial,2,Thu Jun 4 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"I've got a very rough outline for future chapters, but I could definitely add to it to flesh things out so they're no longer in my head.  Great suggestion.  :)  I've been resistant to write future chapters only because I tend to change quite a bit as I go along.  But this would be another good reason to write a more detailed outline!  Thank you for the suggestions!!  I think I'll work on my outline and play with future chapters.  _^  One advantage to writing the way you do is that you have things fleshed out pretty well before you start posting them online!  If you've got a story to share, I'd encourage you to share it.  :)  I think your style of writing is more in line with traditional writing, which is always good.  heheh"

CullenMancers,38hbwh,karinabean,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems like we're all writers these days, so you may get a lot of people pushing their own fics.   Like me :P  Mine is very long, and includes two little vignettes towards the end of what I've written so far. My story is called Capitolina Lupa, and I'll let my summary on AO3 do the explaining for me. Cullavellan.   I don't really follow any others that aren't shared regularly (and I'm really terible at finding new stories without being told here, read this!), but I do have a bookmark for a completed Solavellan that's incredibly well written, if you're cool with that pairing, that I'd be willing and happy to share."
CullenMancers,38hbwh,theRadioStarr,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:34:10 2015 UTC,"Might as well throw it up here! :) I prefer good writing over a particular pairing, really. Thanks for pushing your fic, nothing wrong with self-promotion :p and yeah, seems like we are all writers these days!"

If you go to my profile, it's in my bookmarks under the series 'Through Prism and Shade'.   EDIT: Here's the series. There's an alternate epilogue piece, and two separate prologue pieces that are really well done, too."

I can't read enough of it currently, such a brilliant story. It has an OC Liz who is thrown into Thedas through the Inquisitors rift also. It's not like your typical self obsessed OC fic, this is phenomenal. At the moment the Cullen romance hasn't played out (writer is going for the slow burn) but it will soon enough and it's going to be incredible, I can feel it! Haha."

I have a group project due on Monday that was literally JUST assigned to us, another group project due at the end of the month, exams for lecture AND lab on Monday (TWO!!! EXAMS!!!) plus next weekend I'm taking a class to get CPR certified.  I cannot study anymore today. I can't. I refuse. Someone hold my hand and tell me it's going to be all right!"

How 'bout I one-up the handholding with a big, long virtual hug?   You need to take a break. Over-doing it can lead to worse results. Go out, take a walk to a coffee shop, and just enjoy your drink. Get a good, healthy snack (if you like blueberries, they're apparently great study fuel). If it helps you unwind, write! Take your mind off the schoolwork so the information has time to sink in.   I hope I helped!"

Writing does help me relax, but what's keeping me sane right now is studying while I ride my stationary bike.  Stress relief!  Feeling prepared!  Multitasking is awesome!  Tomorrow I don't have school, so I'm going to get my son on the bus (he's five), I'm going to ride my bike for an hour while I plow through my notes, run some errands, and then sit down and write for a while.

CullenMancers,378yzq,karinabean,3,Mon May 25 21:11:55 2015 UTC,Eeeee. So cute. Disney prince-style Cullen.
CullenMancers,378yzq,ifeelwitty,2,Tue May 26 04:31:00 2015 UTC,there are some other really cute ones too! this one and also this Beauty and the Beast inspired one that pretty much made me melt in the floor

CullenMancers,36yjyt,thesmonster,6,Sat May 23 05:07:04 2015 UTC,There needs to be a DLC where the Inquisitor and LI do this. Like - the entire DLC. ;)  Just kidding. But I would pay money for another story DLC where this is a moment that happens. Plz.
CullenMancers,36yjyt,ifeelwitty,3,Sat May 23 16:39:48 2015 UTC,Mmmm.. Dragon Age Inquisition's edition of the Citadel DLC. I'd pay big bucks for that.
CullenMancers,36yjyt,RakishiM,2,Sun May 24 23:42:31 2015 UTC,I'd pay big bucks for the following:  Return to Kirkwall  Inquisition version of Citadel  Paragon/Renegade interrupts
CullenMancers,36yjyt,ceranna,3,Tue May 26 15:34:41 2015 UTC,I would have loved a renegade reaction to Bianca's bitch comments. I was angry that she got you throw down and walk off without me getting to give her a piece of my mind
CullenMancers,36yjyt,RakishiM,2,Tue Jun 2 05:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. Also, most likely not ever going to happen, but if they were ever to allow us to play our beloved Warden again, I would pay big for that."

CullenMancers,36ysk3,itriedtoquitreddit,4,Sun May 24 06:00:18 2015 UTC,"I saw the best one ever on Tumblr yesterday:   I need less modern AU Cullen in college, and more modern AU Cullen who spent ten years working for Goldman Sachs and is very, very sorry.    Well sort of sorry.   He still doesn’t necessarily see anything wrong with securities trading so long as it’s done ethically, but hey, at least he’s no longer cooking the books for arms companies, and he’s mostly off the cocaine."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,ceranna,2,Sun May 24 12:57:27 2015 UTC,"Ya, I definitely wouldn't want college aged Cullen. He should be the age he is in DA, like 34/35. I need a man, not a boy."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,ceranna,3,Mon May 25 02:05:36 2015 UTC,Apparently he's 29. D:    I'm still tripping over that
CullenMancers,36ysk3,ceranna,3,Tue May 26 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"I was guessing he's older. There was a post saying that in the Dragon Age Origins toolset his age is listed as 24.  And I don't think he'd be younger than Alistair in Origins. Alistair was 20, and recruited 6 months earlier and he wasn't made a templar yet, and Cullen's already a templar so I think he'd be at least a couple of years older than Alistair."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,theRadioStarr,2,Thu May 28 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"In World of Thedas Vol 2, they state his age as 18/19 at the time of Broken Circle in Origins.    It just makes more sense for him to be older though"
CullenMancers,36ysk3,ceranna,2,Tue Jun 2 13:21:37 2015 UTC,"Really? I feel like it's too weird for him to be younger than Alistair. Well, whatever, I still have my heart set on a mid 30s Cullen."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,theRadioStarr,3,Thu Jun 4 03:41:38 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of Cullen being a priest,  but maybe one that's left the priesthood due to disagreement with the order (not lack of faith) and ends up working as a counselor or something?  Or maybe a member/leader of a highly trained top secret military force that quit after he realizes that his group is being used for nefarious purposes.  But it's hard to find a modern equivalent."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,khaosanomaly,3,Sat May 23 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"Ooh, just thought: maybe he's a baptist but when Westboro goes nuts about the military and LGBTQ rights he leaves? Then Trevelyan is the only survivor of a terrorist attack on a Rights protest?   Extreme enough to downvote, apparently. I never said it was perfect, but there's a parallel for you."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,Crystallyne27,1 point,Mon May 25 02:55:01 2015 UTC,"I like it, definitely a parallel there.   Ooo or maybe a missionary who has a come to Jesus about the devastating cultural impacts/effects on the indigenous people after a civil war is started.  This could tie in super well with a Dalish Inquisitor!    Also upvoted to try to balance that downvote"
CullenMancers,36ysk3,khaosanomaly,2,Tue May 26 15:45:04 2015 UTC,"That's a great one, like if he's in South America or Africa on a missionary trip!   Heh, I'll give him a missionary trip..."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,Crystallyne27,2,Wed May 27 01:15:25 2015 UTC,"I tend to think military but like special forces. Something say Marines or some other special branch for his occupation but at the same time I could also see him being a Military Priest of sorts (cause oh god, i have a religion kink and ~corrupting priests is a thing~).  The addiction would need to stay, too but in what manner I don't know. I don't feel like it should be drugs or alcohol but maybe a physical enhancer or sorts. Not quite steriods but something needed (believed to needed) to be used to enhance soldiers ala Lyrium in whatever special forces he's in.  And he could start withdrawing from the actual field due to his want to stop taking said drug by starting to devote his life more as a pastor/priest... Oh god the ideas are endless."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,theRadioStarr,1 point,Sat May 23 20:03:37 2015 UTC,"Instead of an addiction to some kind of chemical, you could go a different route and have him essentially dealing PTSD given his background, which is pretty much how his in-game withdrawals manifest themselves.  If he was in the military, there would be plenty of sources to cause various levels of PTSD."
CullenMancers,36ysk3,Crystallyne27,2,Sun May 24 09:45:07 2015 UTC,You're right! Could definitely use that instead of adding an addiction to his mess of problems.
CullenMancers,36ysk3,Elorenalory,1 point,Sun May 24 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of him serving with the Police or Fire Department.  I would almost say Military, except that I see him more in a position where he's working with (and helping) the general public more directly.  He would be devoutly religious, but would probably have some kind of dark past.  (Not illegal, but...something that haunts him.  heh)"

Why do I ever think it will stay straight when it's 40 degrees Celsius outside?

CullenMancers,36qa34,karinabean,7,Thu May 21 07:14:41 2015 UTC,We should just have a permalink to Greendelle's tumblr somewhere here.
CullenMancers,36qa34,theRadioStarr,3,Thu May 21 15:21:45 2015 UTC,That's a drawing for Diplomatic Ties (I can't link here) by Felanderis on AO3.  I highly suggest reading it.
CullenMancers,36qa34,Rhydnara,3,Thu May 21 15:44:11 2015 UTC,I have not read this. I just looked at the summary on AO3... Why have I not read this. I need to read this. Why am I at work right now nooooooo
CullenMancers,36qa34,lia_fanel,1 point,Thu May 21 21:08:02 2015 UTC,Read the first chapter and I can't continue. I can't help but feel like Alistair is betraying my Hero and that breaks my heart.

CullenMancers,36qa34,Rhydnara,3,Thu May 21 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't as big a fan of the sequel.  The last chapter was pretty good, but I thought the second was, well, not so good.  The author also switched from past to present tense again in the middle of the story.  That kind of stuff drives me crazy, and not the fun kind of crazy."

CullenMancers,36owrv,ifeelwitty,2,Thu May 21 01:37:54 2015 UTC,They're my favourites from the sampler too. Both so sweet and delicious :D

CullenMancers,36owrv,MaryPopNLockins,3,Thu May 21 00:58:39 2015 UTC,I just brewed up a cup of Cullen- added honey and a splash of half&half- and I'm in heaven. It tastes like a cookie. It tastes like a ginger snap to me.   I'll try Alistair tonight.
CullenMancers,36owrv,theRadioStarr,2,Thu May 21 15:23:50 2015 UTC,How delicious is it? I've been eyeing it for a while...

CullenMancers,36mknj,Rhydnara,5,Wed May 20 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"Seen in game:  -Shortened temper. (Him throwing the box, snapping at Cassandra, etc).  -Headaches (Mentioned by Cullen repeatedly).  -Worsened Nightmares (Mentioned by Cullen).  -Insomnia either due to the nightmares or general restlessness, apparent by the fact Cullen seems to be lacking sleep (Dark circles under the eyes, having a hard time focusing). I think this adds to him being a bit more temperamental as well since lack of sleep brings a whole new bundle of negative side effects.  I think Cullen mentions the shakes as well, but it's been awhile. (*Cole mentions that Cullen gets the shakes.)  Signs of Lyrium Addiction as per Dragon Age Wiki:   The effects of lyrium addiction for templars include paranoia, obsession, and dementia. Over time, templars grow disoriented, incapable of distinguishing memory from present, or dream from waking. They frequently become paranoid as their worst memories and nightmares haunt their waking hours.    When I get back home I can check the books I have if they've got more information to add to this. (So long as I remember. You can PM me if I don't add anything in 8 hours to remind me ;) )"
CullenMancers,36mknj,Staleina,2,Wed May 20 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"I have to wonder, are they warned that that is going to happen before they join the Templars?  It's just horrible."
CullenMancers,36mknj,Staleina,6,Wed May 20 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"I would have to say that the majority are not.   Lyrium is used as a leash to keep the templars loyal to the Chantry. I believe either Alistair or Cullen mentions this. It's part of why Cullen wants to help other templars quit it as well.  The Templar Order even will withdraw lyrium rations as a means of punishment, as shown in Confessions of a Lyrium Addict.  Of course those who are familiar with the effects are aware, but I think most join The Order of the Templars as an honorable thing and are unaware of the effects of Lyrium. Ex: Noble families sending off the third child to join the order, poor families sending any of theirs since they can't support them on their own etc etc.  The side effects are kept fairly hush hush as I'm aware. Either the ones showing the worst sign are kept out of the public eye or are cast out and made beggars. I doubt Thedas would view forcing your soldiers to become addicts to maintain their loyalty as a good thing."
CullenMancers,36mknj,Staleina,2,Wed May 20 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"See, that's why I have a problem with Vivienne becoming Divine.  She would do a great job redoing the Circles and making sure mages are treated well, but I think the Templars would still end up being abused."
CullenMancers,36mknj,autowikiabot,2,Wed May 20 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"You're correct that she does encourage lyrium use with them when you first bring them to Haven and it's something I haven't reflected on before. Though I believe it was to prevent withdrawal issues and to be sure they could use their powers, not so much as her wanting to keep them addicted.  I like that she wants to keep them on a tighter leash, though not the lyrium one. I mean that she wishes to have them under harsher scrutiny, preventing abuses, not causing them.  Vivienne doesn't like weakness, so I'm not sure that she'd actually allow the use of lyrium to become great enough for them to become addicts. I think she'd enforce stricter rules to its use, or perhaps she'd listen to Cullen's council on the matter. Who knows. She does respect both Cullen and Cassandra, neither of them are fond of lyrium."

CullenMancers,36mknj,Staleina,2,Wed May 20 15:22:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I would really chalk his throwing the box and snapping at Cassandra as shortened temper.  It seemed more to me like he was really anxious and almost panicking, and was lashing out helplessly.  You don't act rationally when you feel like you're losing your mind.  The only reason I think this is because he admits that ""these memories have always haunted me.""  If he's having flashbacks, his lashing out probably has more to do with anxiety than a short temper."
CullenMancers,36mknj,perarduaetal,1 point,Wed May 20 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"When I think temper I think of someone being on edge. Not necessarily angry, but that could be a language thing.  Lashing out regardless is showing a lack of restraint when he's usually a very collected person."

CullenMancers,36mknj,yesthatnagia,3,Thu May 21 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"Short-term symptoms include hallucinations and delirium. General loss of lucidity as seen here from DA:O.  Cole's dialogue also indicates that he has shaking fits. ""The little bottle makes him shake, but he tests the chains."""
CullenMancers,36mknj,gabtinha,3,Wed May 20 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"Cullen's symptoms as of DAI:   insomnia implied tremors PTSD flashbacks, nightmares headaches (possibly migraines?) loss of emotional equilibrium   Symptoms of lyrium withdrawal seen in DAO and DA2:   inability to distinguish fantasy/memory from reality (see Irminric in DAO) cravings short-term memory issues (repeating words, phrases, lines of conversation - see Irminric in DAO)   Dementia is generally seen in Templars who have been using lyrium for an entire career.  The ones who've served well or with distinction tend to be treated fairly well.  There's a pair of Templars in Denerim, right outside the Chantry, who may be indicative: one of them is experiencing dementia, but still wants to serve; the other is fully aware of his co-worker's symptoms, but is patient and tolerant about the whole thing.  Also keep in mind that Cullen is physically active and mentally and emotionally stressing himself on top of lyrium withdrawal, PTSD issues, is possibly drinking himself to sleep, sleeps under a hole in a roof, and may not be eating properly or may not be keeping food down.   My point is: DAI seems to treat stopping lyrium use as about as medically risky as breaking a heroin addiction.  Cassandra will tell you that attempting to break the addiction has killed other Templars.  With that in mind, and considering that Cullen may be taking poor care of himself right now, I'd be willing to accept very nearly any bundle of unpleasant symptoms and medical issues."
CullenMancers,36mknj,ifeelwitty,1 point,Sat May 23 15:47:34 2015 UTC,I was going through Alistair's banter yesterday on Youtube (for my fic) and he mentions that if he would have ended as a drooling lunatic... So I guess the dementia is a big thing with Lyrium.  One thing that I don't understand is: I understand the Chantry not telling them about the side effects and stuff. But wouldn't the new recruits see that happening with the old templars? And wouldn't word spread around about the eefects of Lyrium? and wouldn't that make people at least hesitate to join the order?

There are quite a number of songs that I feel really speak to me regarding Cullen, even if they aren't a perfect fit:   From Eden: I guess because he seems to be romanticizing a troubled past. Like I said, not perfect, but still makes me think of him.   Take Me To Church: because having your humanity taken away from you by an organization (not specifically religious, but in this case, religious), and struggling to retain it.   Like Real People Do (this one's live/acoustic): because putting their pasts behind them and just trying to be normal people between all the crazy Inquisition stuff.   Another group I love is the Airborne Toxic Event, and they have a few good ones, too:   The Graveyard Near The House (another live/acoustic, don't think there's an official, sorry): beautiful but strained love, professed unconditionally. Just heartbreaking, if a little macabre in the first verse. Trust me, and listen right to the very end.   The Storm: can't really explain better than the song itself - a person being comfort. Reminds me of /u/insideofadog's Cullen in TSHBM.   I'm sure I'm missing a bunch more, but here's enough to eat up a good half hour of your time.

Heck I could see lil Hawke struggling to find a moment of peace. Omg, Isabela would so ruin his/her first date. You KNOW she would have the talk with them before Hawke got a chance.  I could see Fenris teaching lil Hawke how to fight and whenever the opportunity presented himself, he would read the kid bed time stories.

CullenMancers,35wt7k,ilyahna,7,Thu May 14 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"I think Samson is a great foil to Cullen.  They have so many similarities yet end up in vastly different places.    It definitely makes you think about where they would be with tiny or huge changes in their paths.    IMO,  I think regardless of the situation,  the outcome is going to be the same-ish.  Samson is weak, while Cullen is a stronger person.  Cullen never broke completely after ever thing that happens to him, while Samson breaks the moment he gets kicked out of the Templar Order."
CullenMancers,35wt7k,ceranna,11,Thu May 14 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"Cullen also had an insane amount of support after leaving in regards to his lyrium  addiction (both to quit, but not being cut off if he didn't want to.) Samson did not. Samson was kicked out for a bullshit reason. Cullen left on his own accord. Their situations were not at all similar.  I do not think he would've been recruited in Cullen's place because he was totally disillusioned with the Cantry, rightly so, I might add. And when Cullen was recruited, the Inquisition WAS the Chantry.  ETA: Cullen absolutely broke completely after Kinloch Hold. He wasn't completely unaware of what happened at Kirkwall and he still completely distrusts mages as a whole even in Inquisition. I love Cullen, I really do, but he's not by any means without serious fault."
CullenMancers,35wt7k,VintageLydia,3,Thu May 14 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"I feel that... comparing the way the both of them handled their lyrium addictions doesn't work. If anything, we should be drawing parallels between Samson's reliance on lyrium and Cullen's fear of mages.   Samson's lyrium withdrawal and Cullen's PTSD became the all-consuming, central tenets of their lives. Samson's life became all about getting his next fix of lyrium to stave off the harsher effects of the withdrawal, and Cullen's became all about control and ensuring that the events of Kinloch Hold would never be repeated. Both of them were in completely unsupportive environments. Samson was left in the gutter with no friends, family or anyone who would grant him even a shred of sympathy or dignity. Cullen had Meredith and her cronies constantly reinforcing his fear and hatred and constant exposure to blood magic and demons as Knight-Captain.  Both Samson and Cullen ended up doing some really dubious things while coping with those central influences. It seems unlikely that Feynriel and Olivia were the first children to end up in the hands of slavers. Samson had to way to ensure the safety of those who obtained passage and transport out of Kirkwall from him. Cullen ended up turning a blind eye to some of the really horrible things in the Gallows. His actions were far more damaging because his position as Knight-Captain gave him much more power than a man living on the streets.  Cullen worked his way past his fear to become a better man and that's why he's one of my favourite characters. He made the right choice to protect people and turned against Meredith, then he did everything he could to help fix Kirkwall.   But Kirkwall-era Samson is no less deserving of respect. Even when he's living in the gutter, he still has principles and he still tries to help mages. He could have started robbing or murdering people for money to buy lyrium, but he didn't, and at the end, even while living with the stress of his addiction, he still found it in him to rescue Maddox and share what food and supplies he had with him."
CullenMancers,35wt7k,Gerenoir,2,Fri May 15 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"Situations differ, but I don't think the difference is enough to say that they aren't great foils for each other.  Samson absolutely got kicked out for a bullshit reason, agree there. But in DA2, you do have the option to get Samson back into the Templar Order under Cullen.  How would that affect Samson's development from there, is stuff that I like the think about.   I politely disagree with you on the matter of Cullen breaking after Kinloch.  Mainly I base that off of what Cole wrote to Cullen about Uldred, that ""Uldred marked you, but didn't make you. You stayed you… The center never changed, kept safe like a coin in your pocket.""  To me this implies that while he went through personal and mental hell, and it colored his perceptions and interactions for years after, he still remained whole.  Plus I also think that if he had broken at Kinloch Hold...then he probably would've be killed by the demons.    I'm not trying to imply that Cullen is perfect and shiny by saying he is strong. I've always maintained that the guy has some serious accounting for, since at BEST he spent years ignoring serious crimes against the mages under his charge in Kirkwall.    Both men have flaws and strengths, and a history of trying to do the right thing, however misguided.  Its just an interesting ""what if"" to think about if situations where changed."

He sympathized with Kirkwall's mages and unlike a lot of other people in or out of authority there, he actually tried to help them. He went back for Maddox even before he needed him because he knew no one, including the mages, would think of the Tranquil.  I think by the time Corypheous recruited him, he hated the Chantry so much that literally anything else was a better alternative. By the time he was in the state of mind to question his decisions, he was in too deep. He still felt like what he was offering the Red Templars was better than what the Chantry did, so you know, he wasn't exactly blameless, obviously."

CullenMancers,35uzo7,karinabean,8,Wed May 13 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"It's fur. His helm - which we never get to see in game, sadly - is in the shape of a lion's head. Lion's have fur, chicken's have feathers.  EDIT: Also on Ultra/Fade-Touched it're pretty clear that it's fur: Closeup (also using my recolour but it doesn't make any real difference in the quality)"
CullenMancers,35uzo7,xStephyG,2,Wed May 13 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"Unf... that helm is.. um.. really nice.   I really wish we actually got to see him completely decked out at some point in the game... but I won't complain about getting to see his face.  I think it's the long strokes of colour that were throwing me off. Reminded me more of feathers than fur, but then fur can be long too. It also makes a lot more sense, especially in terms of a lion's mane. Rawr."
CullenMancers,35uzo7,xStephyG,1 point,Wed May 13 21:23:57 2015 UTC,I followed all the media from the moment Inquisition (still called Dragon Age III) was announced so I had seen Cullen in the lion gear from the moment he was revealed. Never once did I see feathers because I know he's a lion. Not a single feather on a lion in real life or in Thedas. :P

CullenMancers,35uzo7,khaosanomaly,2,Fri May 15 22:46:54 2015 UTC,Fur... And Cullen needs a pet bear and mabari..If only to have pet rivalries with Leliana.
CullenMancers,35uzo7,Angelavenger,1 point,Wed May 13 20:03:59 2015 UTC,at least she was nice enough to give him the prettiest one of her pidgeons. the lion has a bird kind of sounds cute.

CullenMancers,35u32p,ilyahna,5,Wed May 13 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people would go the ""forcible"" route but I think it's much more intriguing to think about what would make Cullen join Red Templars vs Inquisition.  And I don't think his thought process would differ.  Imagine if Cassandra didn't get to Kirkwall right away.  So Cullen is stuck as knight-commander, trying to keep his templars safe in the insanity that followed the Chantry explosion and the dissolution of the Nevarra Accords.  Of course his men are probably beginning for direction and he really wants to help because he's a leader.    But he is probably dealing with a lot of conflict internally because of the corruption within the Order that was exposed during all these events.    What if they got the news that a new revolutionary Templar order,  the Red Templars, based in Therinfal Redoubt is offering just the change that Cullen desperately is hoping for?    What if they offer a new type of Lyrium?  One without the negatives and without the ties to the Chantry?"
CullenMancers,35u32p,ceranna,5,Wed May 13 19:20:41 2015 UTC,...oh god this needs to written. Badly!

CullenMancers,35u32p,ceranna,1 point,Thu May 14 04:10:53 2015 UTC,"Haha I mean...it can end happyish.  Maybe Cullen figures it out before its too late and leads a Templar rebellion that then joins forces with the inquisition.    Although he's probably be super bitter that another one of his choices turns out to be a bad deal.  Maybe he loses faith in the Maker and becomes more of a darker, less awkward more broody type,  whose glowers send delicious shivers down the inquisitors spine and frustrates her endlessly because she can't figure him out"
CullenMancers,35u32p,StormAge,1 point,Thu May 14 04:55:07 2015 UTC,"I read one story where Cullen and Dorian went to a Magisters house, as he was supposed to have a cure for Lyrium withdrawal. Dorian was locked up, and Cullen was basically knocked out or drugged, and woke strapped to a table and had red Lyrium shoved down his throat.  They then used him to kidnap the Inquisitor, and...it hasn't been updated, so I dunno. But, not on purpose on Cullen's behalf, at least."

Maybe something goes wrong in some battle with him as Commander and it ends up with him being infected and they have to deal with it.  Or a non-commander takes the inquisitor and she ends up helping him re-find his humanity; he dies saving the Inquisition(?) Or!!! he is like a vigilanty Red Templar. Like, he was infected after Kirkwall (non-Commander Cullen), but because of his past trauma he escaped or was resistant or something, but he still did lose some of his reason/humanity. (I feel like I see an Amell in that one...)"
CullenMancers,35u32p,Graendal,1 point,Wed May 13 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"I was one of the people suggesting it and I am no writer, but I guess what I had in mind is that the events of Inquisition have already started, a relationship is already established, and then he gets infected somehow (maybe when he comes along with you in the field to find Maddox?). And then they have to deal with the consequences of that.  Or, he's there in the future at Redcliffe and has been infected. Or both! Maybe you get a glimpse of what will happen to him if he's infected in the future, so it's all the more frightening/devastating when he actually does get infected in the ""real"" timeline."
CullenMancers,35u32p,ifeelwitty,1 point,Wed May 13 17:21:49 2015 UTC,Maybe Samson finds a way to ambush Cullen at the Dumat temple and forces red lyrium on him in hopes of revenge/making Cullen his second/for the evulz.
CullenMancers,35u32p,AlphaLimaMike,1 point,Wed May 13 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"Here's how I think it would go down: since red lyrium is just lyrium with the blight, the Inquisitor picks up the blight without realizing it as she's out in the field, and it's not enought to harm her, but she accidentally transferrs it to Cullen when she gets back to Skyhold, and it taints what's left of the lyrium in his body.  Super angsty, right?  She loves him, and she killed him."
CullenMancers,35u32p,khaosanomaly,1 point,Wed May 13 17:56:12 2015 UTC,"I actually finished a (horrible, disgusting, terribly bad writing) fic based on Red Lyrium Cullen for the Big Bang based on a Kink Meme prompt.  Basically it's Cullen post-Kirkwall being imprisoned, forcibly fed Red Lyrium who never became the Commander but i have more ideas for that AU where he eventually does become the Commander (hopefully with less bad writing).  Anyway, i think you can go with the forced fed method or even a dubious consent where he's tricked into taking the Red Lyrium based on the lies of whoever. More like he's taking it but doesn't really know better and it's supposed to help him get stronger or whatnot."
CullenMancers,35u32p,gabtinha,1 point,Wed May 13 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"I think everybody would go for Cullen being fed red Lyrium or not knowing what it is, but what if it is on purpose? What if he chooses to go down that path to forget all the bad things that happened to him? Might not be everyone's cup of tea (certainly, not mine) but it would give you a chance to write something really dark"
CullenMancers,35u32p,gabtinha,2,Wed May 13 22:08:57 2015 UTC,I have zero qualms about dark. I'm asking some other questions in other threads because I have a super crazy idea that has spawned from all of your brilliant thoughts.

CullenMancers,35pe3c,Nerdette5,10,Tue May 12 12:44:52 2015 UTC,"I've done both, it's pretty cute. <3  Some people really criticize him for his awkwardness as a Templar when you hit on him (sans mod).  But seriously folks, he likes her and he shouldn't due to his position in the Circle. If they got caught, it means they could be punished. That doesn't mean just a slap on the wrist. Depending on who caught them and how they feel, that could go from one of them just being told to stop, one of them being transferred or her being made Tranquil if someone wanted to claim she used blood magic to seduce him. So...leaving before anything ""untoward"" happens is usually the better option. Though...with more finesse would have been better. Silly lion.  Of course none of US would speak ill of our Cully-Wully. But...I have heard people say it. Makes me sad panda."
CullenMancers,35pe3c,Staleina,2,Tue May 12 20:28:47 2015 UTC,I always loved how bashful he is. Maybe awkward isn't the right wording. I didn't really think about the implications before but you're totally right. It was just amusing when he starts stuttering and after you're done talking he bolts.  I noticed it a lot in Inquisition though when you're flirting with him because I think there he still has the mentality of being devoted to duty above forming an intimate relationship with someone. But at least by Inquisition he is no longer with the Templars so he can be with whomever (mage or not) he wants. But it definitely would not be easy to get past those feelings if the Templar mentality/treatment towards mages kinda drilled into your head for years.  I <3 our Curly (even with his stuttering and bashful ways)
CullenMancers,35pe3c,Staleina,2,Tue May 12 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"Yep! He even admits it to you if you talk to him at the docks. Not in so many words, but pretty much implies that even if you were there and he was attracted to you, he would not have acted on it. (As much as he would have wanted to.)"
CullenMancers,35pe3c,ifeelwitty,2,Tue May 12 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"Plus Cullen was like, what, 18, when the Blight happened? And he spent all of his teenage years in the Chantry wanting to be a templar. The guy's not gonna be smooth."

CullenMancers,35ab0u,xStephyG,6,Fri May 8 17:33:22 2015 UTC,LOL I have the opposite problem. I need to throw Cullen out of Skyhold so the temptation of romancing him is gone. He's just always there!

Something else I miss from Origins is how everyone was all up in your business when it came to the romance. Like Wynne giving Alistair and Cousland more or less welcome advice, Alistair asking Leliana for advice and the comments from Shale.  I really miss that in Inquisition. You get comments from Dorian and Sera, but other than that there's nothing. Hmph."
CullenMancers,35bee4,MaryPopNLockins,2,Fri May 8 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. The banters for the Alistair romance are hilarious. I love how everyone teases him in some way or another. I always giggle like a fool when I hear them. I have a stupid grin on my face right now just thinking about them!  I really hope a future DLC adds more banter revolving around the companions being nosy about the Inquisitor's business. There are so few for all the romances. There isn't enough gossip in DAI!"
CullenMancers,35bee4,Rhydnara,2,Fri May 8 21:04:43 2015 UTC,"Yeees, I'm hoping for some sort of DLC that adds more activities and friendship shenanigans around Skyhold. Perfect opportunity for nosy companions!"
CullenMancers,35bee4,YuinoSery,1 point,Fri May 8 21:22:48 2015 UTC,Maybe because no one wants to tease the Herald of Andraste. Teasing a young Warden seems less...intimidating?

CullenMancers,35bee4,MaryPopNLockins,5,Fri May 8 19:42:28 2015 UTC,I think we ALL want a pretty Winter Palace dress.

CullenMancers,35bee4,theRadioStarr,1 point,Sun May 10 11:44:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I personally am not a modder myself, so I have no idea on how hard that would be. From what I saw of other mods, I rather thought it would be easy to mod something like that, so I kinda expected a mod by now. If it is a lot harder though, than I guess we all just have to wait ~"
CullenMancers,359sra,Crystallyne27,10,Fri May 8 08:35:32 2015 UTC,"It's weird trying to write things that involve game mechanics, because they are not consistent.  In DA:I, lyrium potions don't give you mana, they give you 30 seconds of +magic.  There's no reason the Inquisitor would ever need to use them, whereas in previous titles, with healing mattering, and running out of mana could get you killed, lyrium potions could be considered a staple part of a mage's life.  In DA:I, I'd look at it like alcohol.  Cullen's an alcoholic, the Inquisitor is not.  The inquisitor imbibing isn't going to physically harm the commander, but choosing to forgo ""social drinking"" in deference to the commander's problem would be a nice thing to do.  He could smell it on her breath, or taste it when they kiss, and that's got to be hard.  In earlier game mechanics, the analogy would be different, and somewhat more tangly web of tragedy."
CullenMancers,359sra,Dramatological,5,Fri May 8 11:16:44 2015 UTC,"I like your analogy to Alcohol.  I also agree about the game mechanics...  Lyrium potions are like completely useless in DA:I.  :(  Personally, I prefer the idea that it gives you a boost to your magic pool, enabling you to cast more spells.  I think I will have my character realize at some point that if she takes Lyrium, then it can cause problems for Cullen, and she'll stop using them for his sake.  I just like that idea.  :)"
CullenMancers,359sra,Staleina,4,Fri May 8 11:27:19 2015 UTC,"I've seen people mention lyrium on the Inquisitors lips being problematic for Cullen.  IMO, I'd say she carries water around to wash her mouth out before she ever goes near him or makes a conscious effort not to use it when she knows she'll be near him. Which wouldn't be hard, the time you're more hard pressed to chug potions you'd be out in the field. He's typically back at Skyhold or with your other forces. You'd have plenty of time to wash the taste out of your mouth.  It's like Dramatalogical said, I'd ascribe it to being with someone who's quitting smoking/drinking when you're still doing either of those things. You need to make a conscious effort not to make things difficult for them.  (I personally don't smoke nor do I date smoker now. But I remember back when I did date a smoker, he'd make a conscious effort to keep his mouth 'fresh' before being around me, which was kind of him.)"
CullenMancers,359sra,MaryPopNLockins,1 point,Fri May 8 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"Excellent point!  It did cross my mind that it would take time for them to get back to Haven/Skyhold, and by then the Lyrium should be long gone from her lips or whatever.  But there may be other situations where there could be some concern about it.  heheh"
CullenMancers,359sra,MaryPopNLockins,6,Fri May 8 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"In my head canon- so I'm pretty sure it isn't lore or real canon- I've always seen the lyrium that Templars take and the lyrium that mages use in potions as different things. The ""Lyrium Leash"" is a much more concentrated and pure form whereas the Lyrium potions that mages use is changed by the brewing of the potion and much more diluted. It is only called a lyrium potion because one starts with a small amount of lyrium and changes it with other ingredients and magic into something else.  So, Cullen wouldn't even be tempted by the potion because the potion isn't what his body is craving.   EDIT- When you create a Lyrium potion in DAI, you don't use lyrium at all. It only takes elfroot. And, according to DAO blue lyrium is mined from a node. So, really not the same thing at all. They're only the same color."
CullenMancers,359sra,Rhydnara,1 point,Fri May 8 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting way to look at it, and now that you say that I can't recall any references to a Templar taking the same potion as a Mage.  So it would make sense that they're two very different things.  Also, the stuff the Templars take is referred to as a draught, or philter.  Those terms are never used for what Mages take.  I'll take all this into account for my story.  :)  One thought I had concerning Lyrium potions in DA:I, my personal take is that they already have the Lyrium being brought in for the Mages/Templars serving the Inquisition.  So there IS Lyrium in the potions, and the elfroot you provide is just added to it, along with whatever other ingredients they might use."
CullenMancers,359sra,gabtinha,1 point,Fri May 8 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"You're right. elfroot+lyrium=lyrium potion. So, in my head canon, there would be lyrium present but it would be so changed from brewing and whatever else they do to the ingredients that it isn't in a form that Cullen would crave."
CullenMancers,359sra,gabtinha,1 point,Sat May 9 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, there's still Lyrium present in the potion, even if it's diluted.  But I think the only way it might cause Cullen problems (in terms of his love interest being a Mage) is if she ingested a Lyrium potion very recently.  As suggested above, if she's been gone for a few days, it wouldn't be an issue.  Or she can drink something to cleanse her mouth of the taste of it.  That's how I see it in my own head canon.  _^"
CullenMancers,359sra,insideofadog,2,Sat May 9 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"It would probably be a constant struggle for him, but I doubt he'd say anything.  He'd feel too guilty, thinking he was making her stop using it when she may or may not need it.  So basically, I think Cullen would want her to stop but would never ask her.  If she's in tune with him enough, she'll hopefully stop using it around him, and make sure her mouth doesn't taste like it when kissing him."
CullenMancers,359sra,wookieeTHEcookie,1 point,Fri May 8 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"I really like your point of view, and I agree with you.  It's wouldn't be in Cullen's nature to say something about it.

CullenMancers,353yek,worldlyshuku,10,Wed May 6 22:18:04 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. I love Cullen as well, but I wouldn't even begin to consider spending this much money for a panel about Cullen unless the writers/actual creators for the character were there! I'm sorry, I love a great VA, but there's only so much insight that you can gain. Not trying to downplay Greg Ellis's work, b/c I do love his voice acting. I'm just more interested in the other aspects of the character."
CullenMancers,353yek,serenanana,3,Thu May 7 13:19:58 2015 UTC,"I think it was Keythe Farley (Thane Krios) who said that he wasn't Thane.  If you wanted to thank someone for the character, thank the writer. All he did was read off the lines.  So I agree.  A panel with the VA, the writer, the face model (if we can ever find him!), the animator, etc would be fantastic.  Just Greg Ellis?  Not worth the price tag.  And besides, Ellis has done panels at other conventions before (look it up on youtube, there are a ton of videos that I can't link right now), and I don't think he got paid for those."
CullenMancers,353yek,Rhydnara,1 point,Thu May 7 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"To add to that, there are tons of BioWare panels and interviews that can be found on youtube or in podcasts--all of which were free and extremely informative/entertaining.   The Keythe Farley thing is completely on point. There's only so much Greg Ellis would be able to say about Cullen, though I'm sure he'll talk a ton about his experiences as playing the character, which might be really fun too. It's just so weird that it's not just a regular con panel. Well, I guess there are swag bags."
CullenMancers,353yek,serenanana,6,Thu May 7 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"""there is also a limited edition art print exclusive to the event created by the talented Greendelle to commemorate the occasion"" xO!!"
CullenMancers,353yek,jess72,6,Thu May 7 01:16:46 2015 UTC,I'm more frustrated at missing the print than meeting Greg Ellis...

CullenMancers,353yek,mix-oh-lydian,6,Thu May 7 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"Copied directly from site:     Enjoy a unique one night event with Greg Ellis, the voice talent behind Commander Cullen Rutherford from Bioware's Dragon Age Inquisition!  This is a one of a kind evening event created along with Greg Ellis with the Cullenites in mind.  The event will include a personal panel discussion with the man who brought our favorite Commander to life.  Ask those questions you have been wondering about regarding your favorite ex-Templar and the Dragon Age universe.  Perhaps we can sway him to sing a line or two for us.  Each guest will have the opportunity to have their photo with Greg and there is also a limited edition art print exclusive to the event created by the talented Greendelle to commemorate the occasion.  As a keepsake, the Cullenites will have a swag bag including exclusive one of a kind Cullenite goodies along with a specifically designed t-shirt created for the event. Are you a Cullenite who lives too far away or are you unable to make this event?  Greg Ellis knows the Cullenites are spread far and wide, and while he would love to meet everyone in person, the next best thing is to have the entire event on a live webcast for those unable to attend in person.  Be a part of this night and make your voice heard by asking the questions you've always wanted to know from the comfort of your home!  Details and information about the webcast will be made available online soon. Ticket Price: $155 Includes event ticket, a swag bag and exclusive event t-shirt, limited edition art print, photograph and autograph with Greg Ellis Webcast Event: $25 Live website access to Cullenites Event including participation in Q&A Date: July 25, 2015 at 8:00pm CST (for those logging in via webcast) Event Ticket does not grant access into Magic City Con.  You have to purchase a Saturday 1 Day Pass (or a 3 Day Weekend Pass) in addition to the Event Ticket to access the Cullenite One Night Event.     I'm not in Alabama, but the event itself sounds pretty awesome.  Got wind of it from the FUCK YEAH CULLEN! Tumblr.  It seems pricey (more than the Con itself), but the goodies you get are probably worth it (Greendelle art? Yes, please!).  Not super keen on the webcast costing $25 though... The Cullen Tumblr also mentioned Greg Ellis would be playing DAI with prompts from the audience.   Thought I'd share just in case though."
CullenMancers,353yek,Rhydnara,6,Wed May 6 22:21:56 2015 UTC,"So this is going to get a little ranty...  Last year, the voice actors for Thane Krios and Ashley Williams, along with the face models for Samara and Kaidan, came to PAX East dressed up as their characters.  They held a panel where anyone could ask questions, then had professional pictures taken with fans for around $30 a picture.  The money all went to Saint Jude's Children's Hospital.  They offered autographs as well, for $10 a signature.  The event was live streamed for FREE.  I love Greg Ellis (obviously), but this seems ridiculously steep.  I get charging for the event, because swag isn't cheap.  But $155 a ticket?  And what really gets me is charging to watch the live stream.  Here's the thing about live streaming; it can be a no cost additive.  Twitch is free.    Now maybe if they offered battlement kisses with him dressed in Cullen's armor...but I think that gets into the ""creepy"" aspect of fandom."
CullenMancers,353yek,mix-oh-lydian,2,Thu May 7 11:51:25 2015 UTC,"My sentiments exactly.   Just to play devil's advocate: I'm sure it would be argued that the difference between the two would be Thane/Ashley's voice actors have done less work, and that the other two folks were just the facial models for the characters. Greg Ellis has done quite a lot of voice acting, and has been in major motion pictures. On top of that, PAX East receives a much, much higher turn out than I'm sure this small local con will reel in, so it was probably far easier to pay the actors based on ticket fees alone + the small signing fee.  But, like I said, I personally agree with everything you said completely."
CullenMancers,353yek,Rhydnara,2,Thu May 7 12:03:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, Kimberly Brooks (Ashley) has been in a ton of stuff, and won major awards for her work in Bioshock Infinite.  Keythe Farley has also done a ton of work, but is rarely credited because he usually does the VA directing.  So I wouldn't say Greg Ellis is a bigger VA than these two.  As far as I know, neither of them were paid for the event last year.  They managed to fund everything through donations."
CullenMancers,353yek,mix-oh-lydian,1 point,Thu May 7 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That's all interesting information, indeed. I knew Brooks was in Bioshock Infinite, but I hadn't realized she won serious awards for her work in it. As for Farley, I didn't even know that about him at all.  Like I said originally, seems kiiiiind of cash grabby to me. :/ Especially since those convention people have said that Ellis was going to be at the convention already, and there would be opportunities for autographs and photographs with him outside of the ""Cullenite Evening"".... which actually makes it seem even more lame.  EDIT: Here's a link to the comment from the convention staff saying that Ellis will be speaking at other panels during the event/will be around for typical photo/autograph opportunities. It seems more and more like $155 gets you a Greendelle print, a shirt, some swag, and the opportunity to watch Ellis play Dragon Age/answer questions about his interpretation of the character of Cullen Rutherford based on the lines he read. :/"
CullenMancers,353yek,VintageLydia,2,Thu May 7 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"Its often the convention, not the talent, who decides on the prices. I have no idea whether that's the case here, though."
CullenMancers,353yek,gabtinha,1 point,Thu May 7 13:33:45 2015 UTC,"Wow. I thought the price tag for one of those events was around the $150, everywhere! I had no idea it could be this cheap in the States. When you into this perspective, I guess the price is a bit too much... And that we are being ripped off in Australia"
CullenMancers,353yek,thejilldonahue,3,Thu May 7 22:08:22 2015 UTC,I'm very sad it's all the way over in Alabama :(
CullenMancers,353yek,kendiara,2,Wed May 6 23:17:59 2015 UTC,The Alabama part isn't the problem for me...its the 155 dollars lol.   *Edit  My husband decided its my birthday present so I get to go!
CullenMancers,353yek,thejilldonahue,2,Thu May 7 01:06:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is pretty steep. Plus you still have to pay to get into the con! Edit: a letter"
CullenMancers,353yek,mix-oh-lydian,2,Thu May 7 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's steep as well, but I'm sure they're overcompensating for the cost of the items. They likely want to make a profit and even in bulk, printing art and shirts aren't super cheap. Plus, the value of getting a picture and an autograph. $100 would still be too much for me, but I can logically see why it might be so high."
CullenMancers,353yek,gabtinha,3,Thu May 7 04:48:25 2015 UTC,"Making a profit? Sure, absolutely - that's totally fair and expected. However, I think it depends quite a bit on what is in that swag bag. I work in printing currently, and shirts/printing art is not  really not that expensive in bulk... unless they're going to be far nicer than a 2-3 color standard cotton shirt and like an 8"" x 10"" print on some glossy cardstock or photo paper. If there are a ton of other items in there as well rather than, say, 3-4ish cheap items, then I'd probably balk at the price far less. It's really hard to say without knowing exactly what's in there. It also would be helpful how know how long the event is scheduled to last.  Greg Ellis' time is absolutely money, and even if he was already scheduled/being paid for appearing at this convention, I'd expect there to be a charge for direct fan interaction/photo and autograph signing, plus the cost of the goods. But $155 + $30/$40 (1 day vs 3 day cost) to go, and $25 for the website interactions? I dunno. It just seems like way too much, and I'm genuinely curious to see what kind of turn out they'll receive... especially in Alabama.   All this aside, I definitely commend this convention's staff for their effort in creating a truly memorable experience for a comparitively tiny niche market. I would honestly love to go, because it sounds like it's going to be a blast... plus, you know, Greendelle art... and Greg Ellis voice in person.  Then again, they also have Jennifer Hale listed as an appearing guest. Interesting... I wonder if they're doing a similar thing with her, or if she's just doing a typical panel setup."

CullenMancers,353yek,lateday24,2,Thu May 7 02:33:46 2015 UTC,I would so but that for a dollar. But i don't live close to Alabama. :(
CullenMancers,353yek,esca6angel,2,Thu May 7 05:36:12 2015 UTC,Yeah it seems really steep but these things aren't really a money grab for anyone.  It is a way for the actor to make a bit of money to appear and to cover the rest of the cost. As much as it seems there are a large number of people who are fans it is still a niche market thus the high price.

CullenMancers,34oa8k,Brennanlemon,5,Sun May 3 04:26:22 2015 UTC,They're both adorkable. I did romance Alistair (repeatedly) in Origins. I think I have a type.

CullenMancers,34oa8k,ifeelwitty,3,Tue May 5 13:27:42 2015 UTC,"I romanced Cullen first, it was lovely and gushy and perfect.  Then I romanced Dorian. I like playing male characters. And, come on, nice butt...  Then I romanced Solas and it seriously made me so angry.   So I made a Cadash and romanced The Iron Bull for hilarity-- because height differences and positions. It was really sweet and fun, and all around great too, but not Cullen.  So, then I romanced Cullen again. Yum!  Now, I'm romancing Cassandra. Fun, but kind of cheeseball. Not as cheesy as Josie though-- from what I've seen.   I may not finish Cass and just create ANOTHER Inquisitor so I can romance Cullen again.   ...I have a problem."
CullenMancers,34oa8k,RoraMitchell,2,Sun May 3 04:42:46 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh, I always gravitate towards Cullen because what happens if he's a part of the next game? I don't want him to be alone, he deserves happiness! Hnng, I need to play as a male inquisitor so that the option just isn't there.   I have 5 characters going, 3 of which are stout cullenites. I have one character for Solas and then one for Iron Bull. My inquisitor still sighs over the commander from afar, but she doesn't stray from baldy or the bull."
CullenMancers,34oa8k,alias-of-a-girl,4,Sun May 3 04:00:21 2015 UTC,"I've only made 2 quizzies, and both have gone after Cullen. I can't help it; he's such a darling.

I've had the same thought, actually. He's been in every single game so far. Just, please don't break my heart Bioware like you did with Alistair and my Amell. They're madly in love but you have the entire continent separating them right now?? Are you kidding me?"
CullenMancers,34oa8k,Nerdette5,2,Sun May 3 16:12:33 2015 UTC,I did the same.  Cullen's romance is so satisfying on every level.
CullenMancers,34oa8k,blackeryattackery,1 point,Sun May 3 18:03:43 2015 UTC,I had to create two Lavellans to play simultaneously. One for Solas an one for Cullen so I wouldn't 'accidentally' romance Cullen with my Solas one.

Some of the information isn't concrete.  But, for example, Dorian's birth year is specifically listed in the book, marking him as 30 years old in DA:I.  In Cullen's case, apparently he is 29.

CullenMancers,34ovzv,ceranna,3,Sun May 3 19:36:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in my head cannon he's around 35 years old.  Screw what BioWare says.  HAHAHA!!!!"

CullenMancers,34ovzv,lionesspride,1 point,Mon May 4 00:10:44 2015 UTC,Same. My personal headcanon age is 33-35ish. maybe as old as 37 if i really want to push it.

CullenMancers,34ovzv,ifeelwitty,1 point,Thu May 7 04:33:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the book myself, but the DA Wiki page says the novel takes place in 9:10.  http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Age:_The_Calling  There's another source I recently came across that lists a bunch of details taken from books and codexes.  It uses the dating system according to the Elven calendar, but the year (8409) also correlates to 9:10.  That website is here:  http://virdirthan.wikispaces.com/Standardized+Timeline  Like I said, I haven't read the book myself.  Does it say in the book itself that it's 9:14?"

CullenMancers,34ovzv,khaosanomaly,1 point,Sun May 3 17:58:51 2015 UTC,I think the limited edition was sent out ahead of the regular version.  So the info coming out is from that version.
CullenMancers,34ovzv,Crystallyne27,1 point,Sun May 3 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"Guess the rest of us will find out when on the 12th. To think he's still only 29 at the beginning of DA:I... I mean it's plausible. He was a brand new recruit (acted one at least) when DA came out and he does mention full duties weren't bestowed until you're 18. :|a  Well, we could always headcanon DA:I didn't take only one year and he aged up a bit more. (I personally think DA:I might be 2 or even 3 years based on travel times)"
CullenMancers,34ovzv,khaosanomaly,2,Sun May 3 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he had been a full Templar (19 years old) at the beginning of DA:O.  DA:I starts about 10-11 years after the end of the Fifth Blight.  So 29-31...  I guess officially 29, but he looks and acts older!!"
CullenMancers,34ovzv,Crystallyne27,1 point,Sun May 3 22:16:40 2015 UTC,"I think we can blame the Blight/Kinoch and Kirkwall. If you're stressed horrible and over time, it can age a person much more than they naturally would.  Hell even drugs (Lyrium addiction going overboard like him taking very high dosages post-Kinoch) could do the same thing."

CullenMancers,34ovzv,Crystallyne27,1 point,Mon May 4 01:02:34 2015 UTC,It's so delectable... He should get his bottom grabbed everyday. Preferably by everyone. Maybe there should be a counting chart? How many times shit did not happen because we grabbed Cullen's arse.
CullenMancers,34ovzv,khaosanomaly,1 point,Mon May 4 03:03:57 2015 UTC,It's really tripping me out that Alistair is older then Cullen O_O
CullenMancers,34ovzv,ceranna,1 point,Sun May 3 23:11:20 2015 UTC,"How old is he? Cause if he is, I'm going to cry that I can't use him as the Templar Recruit from Cullen's Wicked Grace story a possible friend for Cullen during Templar training.  EDIT: Oh wait, found it. Alistair is ~31 (born 9:10)... Mm... I suppose I could still may be able to work that this headcanon."
CullenMancers,34ovzv,khaosanomaly,1 point,Sun May 3 23:18:25 2015 UTC,"I know right?  I'm having a hard time getting my mind wrapped around the fact that he's only 29.  That just seems way too young.    Plus you got the fact that Templars usually take their oaths at 18,  Alistair mentioned that he was just about to take his before being recruited to the Grey Wardens ~6 months before DA:O,  so he had to have been 19ish since he was 20 during DA:O.    Cullen was already a Templar for at least a year, so if anything it would make sense that he's either the same age or slightly older then Alistair."
CullenMancers,34ovzv,ceranna,2,Sun May 3 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I mean, Maker, even if we do go with the theory that stress/lyrium made him look older than he is... He still would need to be around the same age/slightly older than Alistair.  ...I actually peg Cullen to be more around 33 though aged like he's 35+. I mean there's some spots where he just looks older in some scenes than others....  Maybe Alistair was a late bloomer? That is, he stayed in Templar Training later than most whereas despite Cullen's statement he wasn't a very studious/attentive student... He was probably still in the high ranking/early bloomer recruits. :|a"

A Wicked Grace game. Pick a war table mission and explore Cullen-as-Commander. Templars adjusting to ""new Cullen"" after joining the Inquisition. Cullen prepares to assist in Samson's judgement. A pointed conversation regarding Kirkwall with Varric and/or Hawke. A newly recruited Cullen ponders his choice to join the Inquisition."

Bonus points if you touch on some kind of long harbored regret/longing of never getting a chance to pursue her past the innocent flirting they do in Haven.  Alistair and Cullen's ""reunion"" at Skyhold, and their reactions to each other about how their paths have lead them away from the Templars? Bonus if they reminisce about a sacrificed Hero of Ferelden (maybe Alistair romanced Mage Amell?!).

Also if Alistair is a drunk in Kirkwall,  where is he during Inquisition?  I'd like angsty story that ends on a happy note exploring that one :).   Inquisition from a refugee point of view.  I always thought it'd be interesting to read a story from the POV of someone outside of the Inner circle.  Do they believe the Inquisitor is someone holy?  That sort of thing.  I had this idea of a Fereldan woman whose husband was a Chevalier (but died during the Civil War) and was returning home with her children only to be swept up into the conflict."

Hell, throw Vivienne in there, too if you want. Maybe written in journal entries? Maybe a special section written by Mother Giselle showing her opinion? And if Varric is a believer but would never step foot in a chantry, who does he hope becomes the new Divine? Whoever is chosen will obviously somewhat represent the Inquisition- who does Josephine hope becomes Divine, to make her job easier? Templars and the Chantry are obviously closely intertwined- what does Cullen hope for? Does the idea of Leliana becoming Divine frighten him?  I'm just really interested in seeing something political. Thanks!"

I can understand wanting something all to yourself but don't show it. I have a personal version of my Cullen armour mod but I won't ever show it to anyone.

CullenMancers,343nkl,gabtinha,13,Tue Apr 28 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"Voice actor is the same for all three games, which is awesome, but he looks sooo different in DA:I vs the rest of them.    I kinda liked DA:2 Cullen,  (look wise, personality wise he was a dick).  He just looks super worn down which makes sense and almost older then he looks in DA:I.  The taro card for him (and the concept design) look more like DA:2 Cullen."
CullenMancers,343nkl,ceranna,10,Tue Apr 28 01:47:00 2015 UTC,"I know the actor is the same (bows down to Greg Ellis), but the voice sounds so different. He sounds much older and mature now, which means that Ellis did an awesome job! I wonder why they decided to change how he looks. If I am not mistaken him (and Allistair to some extent) were the only ones that had such radical changes."
CullenMancers,343nkl,ceranna,8,Tue Apr 28 02:10:53 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure either!    I mean I'm not complaining...he looks wayyy better in DA:I.    It might've been a need to really differentiate how Cullen looks from Alistair (Both ex-Templars, both brownish hair and eyes). But I'm just guessing."
CullenMancers,343nkl,AWeirdCrab,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:19:53 2015 UTC,"Not complaining either!!! I think he actually looks younger now. And seriously, those lips...  Ok, stop dreaming and go back to work!!!"
CullenMancers,343nkl,elfhelpbook,3,Tue Apr 28 02:35:47 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that the engine to design the games had changed for DAI so they had to recreate the animations for a new system. Hence all the differences.  I was out of the DA loop for a few years until my boyfriend played DAI. When Cullen came on screen, I was paying no attention and thought he was Alistair!  He's certainly been prettifed, perhaps to make him a more of a typical love interest."
CullenMancers,343nkl,AWeirdCrab,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:59:09 2015 UTC,"It is just funny that they kept Cassandra, Leliana and Varic (even Strout and Loghain) looking the same, but Cullen is a completely new person, so resemblance at all to the character in the previous games."
CullenMancers,343nkl,cipher_six,8,Tue Apr 28 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"I think Varric looks quite different, but your eyes are just so drawn to the chest hair you don't notice the difference as much."
CullenMancers,343nkl,ifeelwitty,3,Wed Apr 29 00:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think if you compare Leliana in DAO to how she is now, she's still quite a bit different. Though I suppose that's to do with the passage of time more than anything.  But yeah, it's also interesting how Cullen's tarot card, as ceranna said above, is a lot more like his former self. Perhaps he's some kind of Dorian Gray and there's a portrait of his older self stashed away in a crypt.  Either way he should be presenting some sort of Thedas makeover show so we can all learn his devastating beauty secrets."
CullenMancers,343nkl,Elorenalory,2,Wed Apr 29 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, yes his looks did change somewhat. However, I think they kept enough things (like bone structure, etc) the same that he's not completely unrecognizable as the same character.   Or maybe I don't see the changes as much because I've been a fan since Origins came out and so the change just seems more gradual to me. Origins Cullen to Inquisition Cullen is a big jump (I blame that more on Origins graphics being incomparable) but DA2 Cullen to Inquisition Cullen not nearly so much."
CullenMancers,343nkl,YuinoSery,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:45:13 2015 UTC,DAI Cullen is also off lyrium cold turkey and fighting for a cause he believes in. That might've turned back to the clock on his face a bit.
CullenMancers,343nkl,Elorenalory,8,Sat May 2 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"I just replayed DA:2 and also noticed how worn out Cullen looks in this game. I mean did you notice the black shadows under his eyes? I think it's because he was in a very bad place mentally while he was in Kirkwall. So I can even forgive him for being a dick :)  I think it's good that he looks much better in DA:I because it shows that he finally feels like he is making a difference, like he is doing something meaningful. He feels better about himself, so he looks better, even after his decision to quit taking lyrium."
CullenMancers,343nkl,ifeelwitty,6,Tue Apr 28 12:28:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's because he was in a very bad place mentally while he was in Kirkwall.   How long after the events of DA:O is DA2 again? I don't think its even a year after, so basically Cullen is mentally in a so dark place, its so dark that Amy Winehouse couldn't sing a song about it (if she was alive)."
CullenMancers,343nkl,Rhydnara,7,Tue Apr 28 14:42:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. From what I remember, the Hawkes escape Lothering right after the defeat at Ostagar. They arrive at Kirkwall during the first blight. The Warden ends the blight sometimes during the first year that Hawke works in servitude either to the smugglers or the mercenaries.   So when Act 1 starts and we meet Cullen, he has barely been transferred out of the Ferelden Circle, maybe 5-6 months after the horrible events there. Talk about PTSD. Poor guy is NOT right in his head at that time, and his stay in Kirkwall doesn't help him at all.   Frankly, I'm very surprised at how whole and together he is in Inquisition, nightmares notwithstanding. Our Cullen managed to pull himself out of a very dark place indeed and make himself whole again all on his own. Even just for that he has my respect and love."
CullenMancers,343nkl,perarduaetal,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:00:44 2015 UTC,Our Cullen managed to pull himself out of a very dark place indeed and make himself whole again all on his own.   He could've easily been another Samson or Carroll.
CullenMancers,343nkl,wingedmurasaki,3,Sat May 2 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"I noticed the shadows under his eyes, but I think I noticed them on the other Templars, too.  I headcanoned that it had to do with the lyrium addiction.  No more lyrium, no more bags under the eyes."
CullenMancers,343nkl,Elorenalory,4,Tue Apr 28 17:20:06 2015 UTC,He's also Second-in-Command under Meredith... That's gotta be a hella stressful job...
CullenMancers,343nkl,Rhydnara,3,Tue Apr 28 19:10:10 2015 UTC,"Plus I suspect a certain amount of grooming by Meredith to make sure he fell even more towards her anti-mage sympathies, which would not aid the PTSD at all."
CullenMancers,343nkl,quartzquandary,2,Wed Apr 29 14:47:14 2015 UTC,"Hm... I think the shadows are more pronounced on him though. For example, here is Thrask and Here is Cullen  Cullen looks like he hasn't sleep in days. Thrask seems healthy and well rested in comparison."
CullenMancers,343nkl,Staleina,2,Tue Apr 28 18:43:39 2015 UTC,"I accidentally head cannoned a lot of other things, too.  Like the blue eyes on the Templars, I thought that had to do with lyrium use as well.  Nope, my mind just apparently decides things and then forgets to tell the rest of my brain that I made it up and it's not actually in the game."
CullenMancers,343nkl,Rhydnara,2,Tue Apr 28 19:41:59 2015 UTC,I personally love how grizzled he looks in his tarot card!
CullenMancers,343nkl,Staleina,8,Tue Apr 28 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"I like how he looks in DA:I better.  DA:O and DAII he just had no idea how to style his hair. I'm so glad he finally figured that out. ;)  I find in DA2 he looks so worn because well...he's stationed in Kirkwall. I doubt he'd getting a wink of sleep in a place crawling with blood mages and his boss slowly going more and more insane.  DA:O He was tortured so yeaaaaah.   I figure DA:I he still looks a bit worn (look at the veins on his face, the pale complexion etc, which I can understand comes from the stress of Command and Lyrium issues) but he is happier with his lot in life and probably finally getting regular meals. He's a Commander in the Inquisition, I'm sure most of his needs are being met and he has a bit more control over his life. He's proud of what he's doing instead of being under someone else's thumb 24/7."
CullenMancers,343nkl,Staleina,8,Tue Apr 28 16:33:58 2015 UTC,Leliana actually comments on him styling his hair...it leads to a giggle fit between her and Josephine.
CullenMancers,343nkl,ifeelwitty,4,Tue Apr 28 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"Yep _. Where he tries to deny it, then admits to it. It's pretty cute."

CullenMancers,343nkl,Rhydnara,3,Sat May 2 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"I watched a couple clips from DA:O and DA2 recently, not having seen them since I beat the games so long ago, and I was a little startled by the difference, too, in both character model and voice. I attribute the voice difference to direction (and Cullen really was pretty minor, plus seemed to have a sealed fate in DA:O), since Greg Ellis is always awesome, and DA:I just really let him open up. Check him out as Awakening Anders for additional head-spinning."
CullenMancers,343nkl,lionesspride,2,Tue Apr 28 04:02:05 2015 UTC,"He was a kid in Origins. By the time of of DA2 and Inquisition, he's seen things. And he's physically older. I think Ellis did an excellent job aging his character's voice."
CullenMancers,343nkl,cipher_six,3,Sat May 2 16:29:32 2015 UTC,it's like he went through a second puberty
CullenMancers,343nkl,lionesspride,2,Tue Apr 28 04:19:08 2015 UTC,I guess I would love to go through another one if meant that I would improve that much!
CullenMancers,343nkl,ceranna,3,Tue Apr 28 08:28:49 2015 UTC,I like to think that it's the love of Inky that gives him his youthful glow.
CullenMancers,343nkl,ninetozero,3,Tue Apr 28 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"It's kind of scary to think how much he owes to the Inquisitor.  Giving him purpose, convincing him to stay off lyrium...can you imagine how broken he'd be if you dumped him?  And the scene that plays if you actually DO dump him...the game doesn't show much, but I'd imagine he'd be absolutely shattered."
CullenMancers,343nkl,lionesspride,5,Tue Apr 28 19:44:11 2015 UTC,"I sometimes think Cullen might have issues with, um...being a bit clingy? His comments about the Warden (if you played a mage in DAO) are cute...until you overhear this bit of dialog between Leliana and the messenger. Link to a YouTube video - convo starts around the 1:55 mark if you are on mobile. Some people speculate that her anger is directed at Cullen and his Warden obsession. Not sure I believe it, but if it's true, it does come across as a bit creepy."
CullenMancers,343nkl,lionesspride,7,Tue Apr 28 20:22:24 2015 UTC,"Hm, I always viewed Cullen as being very self-sufficient. He solves his own problems, makes his own decisions, etc. He doesn't ask for much from the Inquisitor besides support and even that seems hard for him to do since he tries to hide his withdrawal symptoms from her.   I'm not sure why asking about a common associate/friend is ""creepy."" And Leliana's dialogue here is really bizarre -- there is no evidence whatsoever in the game that Cullen abuses alcohol so for her mind to go in that direction doesn't make any sense. Further, Cullen does try to ask her, directly not via a messenger, at the War Table and Leliana doesn't seem put-off by it at all. She actually teases him about it to the point where Cullen can't even finish his thought. So yeah, I don't know what this is about."
CullenMancers,343nkl,ceranna,2,Wed Apr 29 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not really sure what to make of that clip myself, to be honest. It really is out of nowhere. I guess the only reason I found it creepy is because Leliana seems so put off by whomever she's talking about. Personally, I like to believe that she's not talking about Cullen."
CullenMancers,343nkl,khaosanomaly,2,Wed Apr 29 14:00:46 2015 UTC,"What I'm guessing,  is its a super specific piece of dialogue for a situation where she's talking about Warden Alistair and the HoF died (but also tried to kill Leliana).  Which makes her really bitter and angry tone make sense and why Alistair would be all sad and drunk and reminiscing"
CullenMancers,343nkl,ceranna,2,Wed Apr 29 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"Brianne confirmed this is about Cullen, but it's a super specific dialogue that only happens if your imported Warden was a female mage who romanced Leliana. In addition, this banter only triggers is Cullen is unromanced in DAI. That's why Leliana is angry, the Warden was her girlfriend and Cullen is being creepy and invasive about their relationship."
CullenMancers,343nkl,lionesspride,2,Fri May 1 04:24:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, interesting. Thank you for sharing!"
CullenMancers,343nkl,ceranna,1 point,Sat May 2 01:26:43 2015 UTC,Maybe she's talking about Oghren. The thought of a still drunk Alistair after all those years is really really heartbreaking. :(
CullenMancers,343nkl,Rhydnara,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah that whole bit with Leliana is so strange. She's so angry too.    It's be my guess, but maybe that piece of dialogue is an regards to maybe Warden Alistair about the dead HoF?"
CullenMancers,343nkl,cipher_six,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:36:33 2015 UTC,"That.. actually would make sense if Warden Alistair had been a Drunk!Alistair in DA2. I think I read it somewhere that if he was exiled from Ferelden, he does come back to the Wardens as Hawke's Warden Friend?"
CullenMancers,343nkl,butterfly_beatrice,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:59:43 2015 UTC,Hrmmm I'm not sure :(.   There's another theory that if he is a drunk then he ends up dead by Inquisition but I don't believe it!
CullenMancers,3421os,commander_pup,19,Mon Apr 27 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not a writer so I'm not going to try but probably things about his failure to save his templar brothers in Kinloch Hold, his failure to see Meredith's madness and stop it in the Gallows and how he will fail in stopping lyrium and fail in his duties for the Inquisition. Telling him he shouldn't even try because he will fail no matter what. That he is a failure and nothing more.  His greatest fear is failure. It's pretty obvious, if you ask me.  And I'd imagine his only response to the Demon (since everyone had one) would be a few lines of the Chant of Light. Either Benediction or Trials. He wouldn't respond to the Demon directly.  I'm so glad he can't come with you during HLTA. It's heartbreaking enough hearing the terrible things the Nightmare Demon says to everyone else. I don't want to hear it taunt Cullen too."
CullenMancers,3421os,xStephyG,6,Mon Apr 27 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's a mercy that he wasn't with us in the fade. How horrible it would have been to be a direct witness to his being taunted and mentally tortured by a demon, especially about the things he fears most. It would have ripped my heart right in two. </3"
CullenMancers,3421os,macynell,2,Mon Apr 27 20:30:56 2015 UTC,Especially since it wouldn't be the first time a demon tormented him. I can imagine his hate and rage afterwards.
CullenMancers,3421os,calicoisms,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:35:28 2015 UTC,"Either that, or it would bounce right the fuck off of him... He's grown a lot over the course of the game, he doesn't even realize how much. Beating lyrium is monumental feat of willpower, after all."
CullenMancers,3421os,perarduaetal,3,Sun May 3 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"I'm... actually writing a fic that deals with this and I had the same thought process. I agree, after everything Cullen has been through, I think failure is the thing he fears most. I think it's the reason he pushes himself so hard for the Inquisition."
CullenMancers,3421os,auroraschildren,7,Wed May 6 12:56:19 2015 UTC,"That he should just give up, go back on lyrium, and fade into failure and obscurity.  Also that he doesn't deserve the Inquisitor after all of the terrible things he's done."
CullenMancers,3421os,Rhydnara,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:00:41 2015 UTC,"Oof, this one hits me right in the feels."
CullenMancers,3421os,lionesspride,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:13:19 2015 UTC,"...That... is probably the most accurate and most hurtful piece the Nightmare could actually tell him.   That and possibly, everything has done and will do shall never ever absolve him of every horrible thing he has done/said. That it all means absolutely nothing."
CullenMancers,3421os,khaosanomaly,2,Mon Apr 27 20:22:20 2015 UTC,"Also that the Inquisitor is going to die, and it'll be his fault.  My specialty is delving into a person's deepest fears and insecurities.  I actually had a hard time making my Inquisitor at all vulnerable around Cullen, because Cullen's vulnerabilities are just so profound.  But considering I had my Inquisitor accidentally consorting with blood mages and causing the murder of most of the Ostwick circle, and is then haunted by a demon herself, I think I did a pretty good job."
CullenMancers,3421os,Rhydnara,13,Mon Apr 27 21:37:49 2015 UTC,"I see Failure as a big one, but I think (even more so then Leliana) his fear isn't that he fails.  It's that he yet again put his faith and is trust in something (this time Inquisition) only for it to be just another corrupted ideal.  Think about it.  He believes that Mages should be treated like people and then Kinloch happens.    He restarts in Kirkwall, dedicating himself to Meredith as her Knight-Captain.  Whelp.  His whole life, he served as a Templar, only to see them fall to corruption.    Yet somehow he finds the strength to put faith into a fledging endeavor, leaving his old life behind.  I honestly think Cassandra was right (partly).  It's not if he weren't Commander anymore that would destroy him.  It would destroy him to see all his hopes and dreams of finally being part of something good go up in flames."
CullenMancers,3421os,ceranna,9,Mon Apr 27 19:57:13 2015 UTC,"Ooohh, that's a good one. The fear that the Inquisition is (or will become) just as corrupt as every other organization out there...so pretty much Envy's vision of the future. Poor Cullen."
CullenMancers,3421os,ceranna,6,Mon Apr 27 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  I think it would have destroyed Cullen completely if Envy took over.    I mean, the guy will go back to taking Lyrium for the Inquisition if you don't stop him.  He is willing to sacrifice his own oaths (to stop taking Lyrium and disassociate himself from the Order) for the Inquisition.  I bet he doesn't even allow himself to entertain the thought that the Inquisition could be corrupted (like Cassandra) because it's such a big terror.    It's probably one of the (many) things keeping him a wake at night."
CullenMancers,3421os,xeferial,6,Mon Apr 27 20:48:51 2015 UTC,"I think his tombstone in the fade would simply say, ""His Past"". He's trying so hard to change himself from who he used to be, even going so far as to stop taking lyrium even though it could kill him."
CullenMancers,3421os,RoraMitchell,3,Mon Apr 27 18:27:31 2015 UTC,"To a Cullen romancing an Inquisitor Mage:  ""Tell me, Templar.  What would your beloved say if she knew in your dreams you always make the killing blow?"""

CullenMancers,3421os,SpyGlassez,2,Fri Jun 5 04:58:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe becoming Meredith and/or Samson: a mockery of the oaths he swore to uphold the Chant and protect and serve mages. He came close, especially the first several years he spent in Kirkwall."
CullenMancers,341zir,quartzquandary,7,Mon Apr 27 17:58:59 2015 UTC,"I am glad you have come to the Light (read right) side Quartz. Ignore the girls at Solasmancers, Cullen is the way to go to heal your heart. <3  Kiss him every time you come back to Skyhold of course. Something you don't get with Solas."
CullenMancers,341zir,Staleina,3,Mon Apr 27 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha! I do so love the tragic romance, but I decided I needed a little healing before I put myself through THAT nonsense again.   UGH I SO WISH I COULD HAVE KISSED SOLAS WHENEVER I WANTED. I was so mad. My girlfriend romanced Blackwall and always kissed him 'good night' when she was finished playing and about to turn it off. So jelly."
CullenMancers,341zir,Staleina,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"I'd never be jealous of kissing Blackwall. I hear he never bathes. Imagine the remnants of viscera stuck in that beard...-shudders-.  But I agree, I was all ""Hold on here Mr.Fatalistic. I get not wanting to kiss here where we have an audience -points up to those in the Library and Spy floor-, but it's not that many steps to a secluded hallway for a good night kiss. Come on now."""
CullenMancers,341zir,Staleina,2,Mon Apr 27 19:15:49 2015 UTC,"It's really cute though, if you kiss him enough, he says something like, ""I thought the beard would bother you, but I guess I was wrong..."" after! That romance is so good. I might roll another human to get with him next time.   Seriously though! We could have gone, I don't know, A COUPLE DOORS OVER TO MY CHAMBERS... AND KISSED... or MAYBE we could have had more Fade kisses! Damn you Bioware!"
CullenMancers,341zir,Rhydnara,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"To be fair on the chamber part. It's across the throne room and at the other end, as well as up a ridiculous amount of stairs. Seriously, who designed that thing? If you look at your balcony from outside, I think it's on the 4th freaking floor. W T F Because what you want to do after weeks-months on the road doing quests, fighting monsters and random stupid requisitions is climb a crap ton of stairs before you can have a bath and relax."
CullenMancers,341zir,Rhydnara,6,Mon Apr 27 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"First off, welcome welcome.  Glad to see you've come to your senses.  I hate playing as a mage, but from a story standpoint, romancing Cullen as one is definitely the way to go.  Obviously don't say nice things about lyrium.  Kiss him as often as possible.  Romance him as soon as possible.  Read all of the amazing fanfiction out there.  Seriously, it's amazing.  Kick Solas in the elfy balls.  Imagine wearing a swishy dress in Halamshiral instead of that awful uniform.  Feel as pretty as a Disney princess, because he's a Disney prince (the sexy ex-Templar, not the lying elf)."
CullenMancers,341zir,Graendal,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :D   It's already too late for me to restart as a mage (I hate playing mage anyway) but all the rest of what you said will help! Should I ally with the mages or Templars? Obviously the Templars, right?"
CullenMancers,341zir,insideofadog,2,Mon Apr 27 19:06:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, from a romance standpoint it doesn't really matter.  Cullen isn't initially pleased if you side with the mages, but he understands and it won't affect your relationship with him.  I side with the mages from a moral standpoint; they probably have kids with them."
CullenMancers,341zir,xStephyG,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, cool. That's good to know!"
CullenMancers,341zir,Graendal,2,Mon Apr 27 20:15:50 2015 UTC,I would actually pick mages so that you can do Cullen's personal quest (Samson stuff) and he'll come with you in the field for part of it. There's no added lines for the romance but you can use your imagination.
CullenMancers,341zir,xStephyG,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:06:36 2015 UTC,"You get one romance line before you go out in the field with him, but it's totally worth it anyway to drag him along. I don't know why, but I just imagined him being really stuffy the entire time."
CullenMancers,341zir,lionesspride,10,Mon Apr 27 23:57:16 2015 UTC,"Be a mage. It's as simple as that. The romance is so much better when the Inquisitor is a mage. There are extra lines and some added tension.   The Cullen romance was made for a mage Trevelyan, if you ask me. Everything else was an after thought."
CullenMancers,341zir,Rhydnara,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Oh no! I rolled a rogue. That's okay, I'll remember that for next time if I decide to romance him again. :)"
CullenMancers,341zir,Rhydnara,3,Mon Apr 27 18:55:05 2015 UTC,I romanced Cullen on my first playthrough as a warrior Trevelyan and found the experience delightful.
CullenMancers,341zir,Rhydnara,2,Mon Apr 27 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"LOL No worries. It's good as a rogue, as well. I always play rogue my first playthrough of a DA game - just a personal tradition - and BW had denied me Cullen for two games so there was no way I wasn't going to romance him my first playthrough. It was just as sweet as you've been led to believe I just prefer mage Trevelyan and Cullen.  My fourth playthrough I rolled a mage to see if there was anything interesting with his romance and a mage and found the added dialogue and bits of tension were much more enjoyable than the non-mage romance. That was when I realised Mage Trevelyan and Cullen is my canon. It's just wonderfully heartwarming.  Okay, I'll stop before I start giving spoilers for the romance. You go experience that sexy man for yourself now!"

CullenMancers,33yqmi,gabtinha,3,Mon Apr 27 02:51:18 2015 UTC,This is absolutely top 3 for me.
CullenMancers,33yqmi,FoxIzBeast,2,Tue Apr 28 00:38:38 2015 UTC,This is by far my favorite one.  I've reread so.e of the scenes dozens of times.
CullenMancers,33yqmi,Rhydnara,10,Mon Apr 27 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, Knight-Captain – (Cullen x Hawke) I’ve mentioned this one here before, but I can’t recommend it enough. Set in Kirkwall around the time of DAII. Knight-Commander Cullen and Hawke do not get along, but find a way to make it work. Very explicit with Dom/sub themes. This was written a few years ago, so canonically it’s a bit out of date, but I enjoy it so much I can overlook that.  The author recently started a conclusion to this fic to bring it in line with Inquisition. It’s also worth a read.    I cannot recommend this story enough.  Well written, good conflict, and well-rounded characters.  What more is there to ask?  Seriously, this is the fic that canonized Cullen as a bit of a Dom for me."
CullenMancers,33yqmi,sophe_s,2,Sun Apr 26 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"SAME. I can enjoy the lighter, fumbly Cullen fics, but uuuunf, this one just made me want more Dom Cullen in my life."

CullenMancers,33yqmi,Crystallyne27,7,Mon May 4 00:49:00 2015 UTC,"I tend to write more than I read, so I hope no one minds a shameless plug for my own Cullen fanfic.  heh   Bridging the Divide - (Cullen x Inquisitor) The female mage Cullen has a crush on in DA:O is not actually recruited into the Wardens.  In fact, she was a friend from his childhood.  They're reunited at the Circle Tower, only to be separated after the events of Broken Circle.  They get a second chance when they're reunited, ten years later.   A couple friends of mine have also written some fanfics featuring Cullen that I highly recommend:   Who She Is - (Cullen/Solas x Inquisitor) Okay so this is more of a threesome, I hope no one minds me posting it here.  I love her unique take on the story, and there's plenty of adorably awkward Cullen moments to be had! She Came To Me In a Vision And Laid Her Hand On My Heart - (Cullen x Inquisitor) Cullen is struggling with his Lyrium withdrawal.  He begins having ""dreams"" of a woman coming to him, giving him pleasure and making his nights easier.  My friend just posted the first chapter yesterday, and I can not WAIT for more!! You Were Blushing.  It Was Adorable. - (Cullen x Inquisitor) Amazingly well written (and humorous) one-shot based on the Wicked Grace scene!   Moving away from my more selfish suggestions...  The only other one I can think of at the moment (that wasn't mentioned above) has already been linked in another post here.  But I'll throw it in, for good measure:   As the World Falls Down - (Cullen x Inquisitor) The Inquisitor is looking forward to a chance to blow off some steam at a masked ball, where no one will recognize her.  There she finds herself enthralled with one of the guests, having no idea it is Commander Cullen, who had the same idea as her!"

CullenMancers,33yqmi,4shitsngiggles,4,Tue May 19 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"I have been reading quite a few fics lately, but this has been my absolute favorite.    It's a series called Sidelong Glances, by GilShalos1 on AO3.      Side by Side - First in the series. Killeen Hanmount gave up her position in the Kirkwall Guard to follow Cullen Rutherford to the frozen roof of the world because he couldn't pass up a chance to save the world - and her world isn't worth saving without him in it. But watching the man who thinks of her as a good friend and reliable soldier fall in love with the beautiful Herald of Andraste turns out to be even harder than watching the world fall apart. The events of Dragon Age: Inquisition from the perspective of Cullen's loyal and trusted second-in-command.       By His Side - Same story, but from Cullen's POV. It's not at all redundant, and is much darker than its predecessor.       Blindside - The sequel to the other two and it's still ongoing. There is considerably more smut in this last one than the other two, but there is still a solid amazing story at the core.      Also, the author updates very regularly, so you're never waiting for long!"

CullenMancers,33ven0,itriedtoquitreddit,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"I think personally, I like Trials the best but at the same time, the locales ones seem to be good because I think he, as a character in Inquisition, is finally able to look at them as not as a really traumatic event that happened recently but somethng that did happen but isn't affecting him as strongly anymore.  That's not to say he isn't going to get completely over it, his nightmares is a sign of it but I like to think he can move pass it and use it as a warning system. Plus the places aren't inherently bad? Just the events that happened there.  I keep thinking of a horrible car crash that may affect you strongly for the first few weeks, months but as time goes by... It's still there but isn't horribly affecting your life and mindset? Then again, you could be right given how strong his PTSD toward Kinoch could be."
CullenMancers,33u9n7,ceranna,4,Sat Apr 25 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"I came across this one the other day.  I certainly enjoy the smut, but I kind of feel like that's not really Cullen.  Sure, we don't know what he's like in bed, but this one seemed a little too...teacheresque (which is now a word).  Still hot, though."
CullenMancers,33u9n7,Rhydnara,8,Sat Apr 25 20:36:09 2015 UTC,"That's the problem all writers face when it comes to fanfic.  My Maric is very dominant leaning very close to being abusive if Catte couldn't break him if she wanted to.  In my brief Cullen/Catte fic, he's also dominant.  And lastly, he is definitely the top in Shield Mates (btw, expect a new chapter or two posted tomorrow).  But Cullen has become my character in a way.  He's true to my interpretation of him, if not other writers or readers.  In my fallout fic, the usual protagonist is a seriously twisted individual and the usually described sick and twisted individual is pretty reasonable.  But we, as writers, create an unwritten pact with our readers.  We might not take you along the path that you expect or hope for, but we will do everything in our power to entertain you and if you're willing to hang around to the end, you might be pleasantly surprised.  It's an agreement of consent.  The reader consents to putting their conceptions of the character aside or they'll never enjoy the story.  My general rule of thumb when reading or writing fanfic is that the only canon I can bring along is their physical description.  Everything else is up for grabs."
CullenMancers,33u9n7,sophe_s,3,Sun Apr 26 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"Oh Maker, i completely agree with this. My biggest worry about writing a beloved character is going too far and sometimes i worry too much about it.  But in my opinion, i want to add that as long as the effort to make the character still be recognizable at the end of the day, then I did a bam up job but... Honestly, we are not the real original writer, we can't be so... There is a lot of room for personal headcanon for us to squeeze in. Physical appearance and basic likes/dislikes and habits that everyone knows is true from the canon (rubbing the back of his neck, stammering slightly during some insecurity scenes, calibrating trebeuchets...) is the only thing we, writers, can really promise our readers."
CullenMancers,33u9n7,khaosanomaly,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:44:04 2015 UTC,"I have nothing to add except for my complete excitement of news that Shield Mates is going to have new chapters - yes, I squealed in delight, and yes my cats think I'm insane now."
CullenMancers,33u9n7,perfectlypeachy,2,Mon Apr 27 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"OK, I know I promised new chapters, but things like real life got in the way.  Once I get things settled, I'll do a cursory edit and post the two chapters to AO3."
CullenMancers,33u9n7,sophe_s,6,Thu Apr 30 23:32:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that the Cullen isn't quite Cullen, but it's pretty hot.    I mean I read it for the plot  Yes..."
CullenMancers,33u9n7,lionesspride,4,Sat Apr 25 21:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kinda understand where you are coming from. I headcanon Cullen as being pretty dominant in bed, but this fic straddles the line between him being a dom and being an instructor. And that, combined with the Inquis being sexually naive, put me off a bit at first.      However, once I put my headcanons aside and just enjoyed it as a bit of well written OOC smut, it totally started doing it for me. The smut, she is delicious. :)"
CullenMancers,33u9n7,VintageLydia,2,Sat Apr 25 22:17:08 2015 UTC,This is where I am with my favorite smut series. Its completely OOC and the inquisitor is literally a blank slate (she doesn't even have a name!) But you don't read them for the plot.

CullenMancers,33ogha,MaryPopNLockins,8,Fri Apr 24 04:45:51 2015 UTC,"I find it helps me to think of the first scene as disposable. Start writing it knowing you plan on probably trashing it and rewriting it once you're done. That takes the pressure off getting words on the page, and once you find your way, the rest tends to come naturally.  If you're really having trouble getting started and can't even get it going knowing you'll probably toss the first scene, start the story somewhere you know you absolutely would not keep. So if your story was set at the Winter Palace and was going to be about The Game and all those serious machinations, start it in a tavern with the Inquisitor getting drunk and singing dwarven drinking songs with Varric. Do something silly and fun to get the jitters out, then segue into where you want the story to actually go. After you've got the swing of things, you can go back and rewrite that first scene in the tone and style of the rest of the story.  Good luck!"
CullenMancers,33ogha,Khirsahle,2,Fri Apr 24 13:55:45 2015 UTC,"So I am there too!  I've got an extensive DA:O through Inquistion outlined, as well as a stupid ""Cullen=Pirate"" AU that I can't for the life of me make leave my head.    The best thing I've done is to stop reading fanfic for awhile, and just let it flow.  Write in what ever media comes naturally to you (for me it's literally pencil and paper).    For the extensive fanfic, I'm still struggling. Its a lot to tackle, but I'm finding that starting from an outline and getting more and more detailed makes it easier.  The silly one is just like...I can't stop thinking about it/writing it so its much easier."
CullenMancers,33ogha,ceranna,2,Fri Apr 24 05:08:24 2015 UTC,"So the first chapter of any story should start with an action or be in the middle of something.  Ubi Amor started with my protagonists in the middle of their flight away from the antagonist, but I used a very short prologue to fulfill some requirements.  However, it was not the first chapter I wrote.  I cut the first 1 1/2 chapters because they dragged.  Typically, a story follows a specific trajectory.  The first chapter will do a few things: it will introduce the protagonist, usually starts with an action, and gives the reader a reason to keep reading (they have to like the main character).  This is the hook.  It needs to hook the reader, get them interested, and make them ask questions.  This follows the scene concept, which has an identifiable goal that the reader finds out early, a conflict or something that blocks the protagonist from getting to the goal, an event that distracts the protagonist from their goal, a reaction to the event, the protagonist needs to analyze the distracting event, how the protagonist will get back on track with the ultimate story goal (achieve scene goal and successfully navigate event), and then finally setting up a new goal for the next chapter.  This is the basic idea of story structure that most novels follow.  Look at the books you like, pull out a chapter and it likely follows this outline.  Also look at how every book you like starts.  Here's the secret, the first words you read are not the first words written.    So, outline and structure aside, just start writing.  Ask a question about your protagonist and then write the answer to it.  In my current original work, I am asking questions about my protagonist that my reader(s) will never see.  How she and her mother relate to one another, why she does she go to clubs and date the man she does, and how all of these answers all feed back to her brother.  I know my first chapter and have written bits of it, but I have also written 4 chapters that happened before this first chapter and no one will ever see them.  That all said, this is better advice for a gardener as opposed to an architect.  If you're an architect, do a search for story structure outlines and fill in each line with a specific sentence.  (If you have Scrivener, there is a template you can download from the national novel writing month.)  Basically, it comes down to goals.  Know your end goal.  Know the small goals that get you to the end goal.  Once you know that end goal everything starts falling into place.  (Also, as an aside, ignore the jumping, 2k words away from my daily goal of 10k and a little punch drunk.)"
CullenMancers,33ogha,sophe_s,2,Sat Apr 25 01:04:34 2015 UTC,"Update: I've been writing and doing well. However, it has grown out of control. It has gotten very dark and personal. I'm okay with the personal, but I try very hard to not fall into darkness. I'm going to have to reassess and dial it back."
CullenMancers,33ogha,theRadioStarr,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:18:30 2015 UTC,"I was worried starting too - my first serious fic, first time sharing, all those jitters. I totally get where you're coming from. Just remember at the end of the day that you're doing this for you. Your happiness, not anyone else's.   I actually gave a pretty heavy retell for my first few chapters. It helped me to set up characters, and then I deviated from there. Maybe you'll find it easier to do something like that, where it'll give you more of a mindset of the characters.   Honestly, what I did could be either the best or the worst advice ever: I just started writing. Sat in front of my laptop, and just went for it. Now when I go back to my early chapters, I see all the awkward phrasing and things that can be cleaned up, but that's okay, because it can be done later.   What I would actually suggest, if you're worried about characters and dialogue and such, is to replay the game. Replay it, but play it critically: who says what and how they say it; make notes for yourself of important lines that stand out; watch the little things they do in the way they're animated. By the time I started writing, I had gone through six full playthroughs back-to-back, so I had (I think) at least a decent grasp on the characters themselves, and dialogue has never been a worry for me (except for Cole, because Cole).   I don't know if this is helpful at all, but I hope it is. Don't be afraid to ask any of us more specific questions if you have them! I made a similar post a couple of months ago here before I started writing - maybe you can gain some insight from there, too."
CullenMancers,33ogha,Crystallyne27,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:37:33 2015 UTC,I've played through the game several times. Playing it through again won't hurt. Lol
CullenMancers,33ogha,VintageLydia,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:11:31 2015 UTC,"My first suggestion is this:  Just start writing whatever pops into your head.  Don't worry about trying to write the story yet.  It could be something as stupid as ""Ugh...  I really want to write this story about Cullen and Trevelyan, but I can't seem to find the words!""  As you start writing, your thoughts will begin to flow.  Write down the ideas for your story, get them down on the page.  Don't worry about writing the actual story, yet!  As you start writing down ideas, it should help you to flesh out your ideas.  There's a lot of ways you can go, it just depends on your style.  Personally, I like to create a very rough outline.  With something like DAI you can even base it off of actual in-game events.  For the story I'm working on right now, I've got chapters set aside for each major quest in the game, and filling in what happens along the way as I go.  I would also recommend RadioStarr's idea of playing the game through again and thinking of it as research.  Imagine how your character would actually respond in any given situation.  Try and pay attention to things you might miss, otherwise.  In the story I'm writing, my Lavellan is rather timid.  Much of the in-game dialogue makes your Inquisitor a strong character, very firm and decisive.  So I have set up a game with a character that looks exactly how I pictured her in my head.  As I write each chapter, I play a bit more of the game and I think about how she would respond in ways that might be different from (or the same as) what actually happens in the game.  Last tip...  Keep practicing.  I've just recently started getting back into creative writing, myself.  The more you write, the more confident you'll be, and the more you'll be able to recognize any mistakes you might be making, so you can write better.  I hope this helps...  Good luck!!"
CullenMancers,33ogha,VintageLydia,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"It helps me to remember writing is a multi-step process. You WILL want to edit it.  My writing is all over the place. I get scenes in my head so I write those scenes down. Usually in order, but not always. So I spend a lot of time trying to connect those scenes. At this point my work is a hot mess. Then I try to figure out what my actual plot is (protip: Don't do this. Figure out plot first. I don't actually publish what I write anywhere so if it's not going anywhere, the only person I'm annoying is me, lol.) THEN I streamline things and adjust dialogue and rewrite scenes to fit. Then I go through it again because I inevitably change something so I have to fix stuff again.  So, don't do what I do if you want someone to actually READ it. I guess. But I have heard more than one writer just write out scenes and fit them in later (or not, if they don't actually fit.) It helps to not have to start at the ""beginning."" The beginnings are easier to write when you know what the next step is. This is how I wrote essays at school. I left the introduction to last and usually wrote the conclusion first. That way I knew where I was going and how I want to introduce the subject."

CullenMancers,33jq7r,theRadioStarr,11,Thu Apr 23 01:55:54 2015 UTC,"I am not a talented shooter player either, but I had zero problems with ME on the easier setting. And by ""not a talented shooter player"" I actually mean so bad it HURTS.  But I so recommend playing the series. I adore it. You really bond with your character, even more than the Warden or Hawke or the Inquisitor, because you see her or him through three games. It is intense and wonderful and complex. The first game isn't my favorite, but ME2 is just so much FUN, and ME3 is really powerful, especially if you get the Citadel DLC. (Make sure you get the Citadel DLC!)  As for romance options, it depends on what you like. Assuming you're playing FemShep, your options are limited in ME1. You have Kaidan or Liara. Kaidan is very cerebral, very focused. He's a good romance if you like a steady, warm romance with some hitches along the way. Liara is an adorable nerd who slowly grows increasingly badass over the games. She's sweet and lovely and makes the best friend. Both of these options are really only around for significant chunks in ME1 and ME3. I can't say more without spoilers.  Options open up in ME2. A lot of people swear by Thane. He is a little tragic and wonderful. Jacob also appears in ME2. He's a steady guy with a strong moral compass and some baggage. Both of these options are really only around for significant chunks in ME2.  My completely biased FAVORITE option is Garrus. Garrus Garrus Garrus. He's in all three games, though you can only romance him in ME2 and ME3. His character makes a marked improvement in ME2, going from a good character in ME1 to a freaking AWESOME character in ME2 and ME3. He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's loyal to a fault, he always has your back no matter what, and he's such a sweetheart. He is basically Varric, except you can romance him. (Not that I'm bitter about Varric being nonromanceable...)  There are a ton of great options, but Garrus is my #1 fav for a femShep because I like snarky best friends to lovers romances. BUT a lot of people swear by Kaidan and Thane!  (And if you play male Shep, Tali is adorable, and Kaidan becomes an option for a slash romance in ME3.)  Have fun!"
CullenMancers,33jq7r,Khirsahle,3,Thu Apr 23 02:07:37 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of Garrus, actually, I remember thinking he was super awesome when I was watching my boyfriend play forever ago.

CullenMancers,33jq7r,Khirsahle,4,Thu Apr 23 03:11:15 2015 UTC,"Is it weird that I am super excited for you?  Oh! One more thing occurred to me. I found that playing a biotic made things SO much easier for me. If you play a biotic and have gifts like shockwave or slam or reave, you can map them as hot buttons. Then just make sure you don't carry too many guns (as they make your powers recharge at a slower rate). That way, you can fling powers at people and don't have to use your gun as much, which is soooo nice for people like us who are better with swords than guns. :D"
CullenMancers,33jq7r,yes_it_is_weird,2,Thu Apr 23 02:37:14 2015 UTC,"It's totally not weird at all, despite what the (actually) weird bot is trying to tell you.   I'll totally remember that - probably would have gone that route just looking at it, too."

CullenMancers,33jq7r,sophe_s,3,Thu Apr 23 02:37:33 2015 UTC,Garrus please! He is always my favorite. I have no joke played all 3 games more than 10 times and I can never not love Garrus.
CullenMancers,33jq7r,myrrar,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:20:45 2015 UTC,It's going to happen. There's no way it's not going to happen.
CullenMancers,33jq7r,KindOwl,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:22:20 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of great options, but Garrus is my #1 fav for a femShep because I like snarky best friends to lovers romances. BUT a lot of people swear by Kaidan and Thane!   In all fairness, Kaidan has an amazing ass.  Just like I like my chantry boys, I have a penchant for the cute biotics.  I am not great at fps, but Fallout popped my proverbial cherry and it was just natural to take the ME plunge.  The one huge thing I love about ME is that I was Shepherd for the whole trilogy (and yes get the citadel dlc and if you have a PC, the mod that lets you play the dlc after the end of ME3 - or alternately, just don't finish it).  I honestly love all the characters, especially Joker.  Plus, there is some amazing fic out there.  The one where they go to Disneyland, cracks me up every time I read it.  Then there's one with peanut butter sandwiches, which I can't find now and it kills me because it seriously made me weep.  Basically, there is a lot less noise in the signal to noise ratio in the fic, and the head canons aren't filled with Mary Sue's.  Also, there's some cool ME/DA cross overs! (How sad, I consider fics when I think about recommending games...)  But seriously, play it.  It's worth it.  It is an amazing example of the artistic and theatrical potential of video games.  Plus, you will rejoice in knowing that Weekes is taking over the DA verse, because his skills in writing makes Gaider look like a 13 year old girl.  Just be prepared to drink a lot when it comes to the mako."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,jadefirefly,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:02:51 2015 UTC,I'm so excited to get started now! You guys have just made me even more pumped for it.
CullenMancers,33jq7r,ifeelwitty,4,Thu Apr 23 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"I love shooters, ME on the shooter scale is very very easy. If you enjoy Bioware games for the story and it not having DA style combat won't be a breaker for you I'd absolutely play it. Play it on the easiest setting if it gives you any issues(1 is pretty clunky, it gets easier in 2/3).  I'd also probably play a Soldier your 1st time, especially in ME1. They're by far the easiest and the most straight forward. Adepts are fun, but super squishy and damage in ME1 can be pretty intense some areas. Party AI is awful so can't really depend on them to carry you. You get to choose a new class if you'd like in 2/3 if you want to branch out. Party AI is also significantly better in 2/3 so you won't be gimped.  As far as romances go, Garrus is my IT ME romance. He's my Alistair/Cullen, I literally can't romance anyone but him and he's my favorite character out of any game I've ever played.  I was pretty reluctant to play ME my 1st time because I didn't like shooters. It's been my all time favorite series since and I've played them dozens of times. It also made me willing to try more shooters, which now make up the majority of my favorite games.  Do it! Just don't get frustrated in 1. The Mako made me quit the 1st time I tried to play through it..."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,jadefirefly,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   I'll do my best with the mako. Now my boyfriend is telling me about how awful it is, I'm not looking forward to it, but the rest of it sounds fantastic!"
CullenMancers,33jq7r,aoibhealfae,3,Thu Apr 23 03:51:48 2015 UTC,"do you have any advice for someone who's never played it?    I started as a soldier class, but I suck so much at shooters that I kept dying even on easy. One thing that helped me was staying in the tank called the mako and killing everything at a distance. There's even this level where the path is blocked so you're supposed to get out and approach on foot, but I was like fuck that! So I wedged the mako in sideways between those rocks and then proceeded to gleefully blast and run over all of my enemies.   Honestly, I didn't really enjoy playing ME1 the first time. Sci-fi doesn't capture my attention as much as fantasy, I hated the gameplay, I didn't feel as close to the companions as in Dragon Age and I didn't enjoy the quests as much. What helped me get through it was looking up which quests would affect the later games and then only doing those. Oh, and cheating... a lot. I never bothered scanning any planets for resources or for fetch quests, because I just edited my save to give me a lot in ME2.  Things got a hell of a lot better for me in ME2 though! It was more focused on the companions and the vanguard class was very fun. Not much aiming required. It's very thrilling to zoom around, charging into people and then falcon punching them to death.  The mass effect sub has a helpful beginner's guide in the sidebar that you may want to check out. Also, looking up builds helped me be a little less squishy.   Who are your favourite romances through the series?    Garrus! Garrus reminds me of Alistair. Dry humor, adorably awkward in matters of romance, and someone you can trust to have your back. I love the best friends fall in love romances. It's a very heartwarming romance, because he's so endearing and you've watched his development through the whole series. Since you can only romance him starting in ME2, I actually didn't romance anyone in ME1, because I didn't want any drama.   Would you still recommend that I play it, even though it's totally outside of my element of gameplay familiarity?   Wholeheartedly recommend it! I might like Dragon Age more, but it's my second favorite series and it's such a fulfilling experience to play the same character through all three games."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,Emptyplates,2,Thu Apr 23 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"I will definitely check that out, thank you so much for all the advice!"
CullenMancers,33jq7r,aoibhealfae,3,Thu Apr 23 14:19:18 2015 UTC,"Garrus. Garrus Garrus, Garrus Garrus Garrus Garrus."

CullenMancers,33jq7r,Rhydnara,2,Thu Apr 23 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I forgot how angular they are.   Like seriously Garrus, your waist-to-hip ratio is blowing mine out of the water, and I'm not sure how I feel about it."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,aoibhealfae,3,Fri Apr 24 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"Its the least hard FPS game ever and I hate FPS games. I start playing as casual until I get used with the play style. I jump from Casual to Normal to Insanity pretty quick. I found myself enjoying Infiltrator the most. I played Soldier on insanity in ME1 and its ridiculously easy and ME became a point and shoot game... which is boring for me.  I'm replaying Mass Effect 3 now (modded the game earlier). I love FemShep/Kaidan and for me their romance fit the trilogy as a whole rather than a romantic subplot. For me, theirs the kind of permanent cosmic relationship OTP thingy. I always love how they look at each other. He's a bit like Cullen.  But if you're pursuing Garrus, just don't start a romance with Kaidan in ME1 if you don't like the drama. Everyone who really HATE him tend to resent him accusing your Shepard of cheating if you had a relationship with him in ME1 and then pursue another romance in ME2. Raphael Sbarge is good at many thing but he can sound even more ruthless if you broke his heart. Had a big argument with people about this... its pretty funny tho."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,Rhydnara,3,Thu Apr 23 09:19:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man. Kaidan, my first Bioware love. Garrus is my bro, i just can't romance him. I'm a Kaidan girl all the way."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,Rhydnara,2,Thu Apr 23 12:32:42 2015 UTC,I tried flirting with him once and then he said he's unsure about interspecies thing and then I thought about Tali giving my Shepard's death glares from behind her mask and I back away fast.
CullenMancers,33jq7r,ceranna,2,Thu Apr 23 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"By the goddess, do not make Tali angry. She'd likely be as frightening as a thresher maw lol"
CullenMancers,33jq7r,Khirsahle,2,Thu Apr 23 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"This was my take, too. Kaidan was my first video game boyfriend and Garrus was my first video game bro."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,ceranna,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:53:26 2015 UTC,What's a good game without some rivalry? :P   Thank you for the heads-up though. Was totally going to do that...

CullenMancers,33jq7r,ceranna,2,Thu Apr 23 15:23:50 2015 UTC,LOOOL gotcha. Too bad for Kaidan that Garrus is a BAMF.

CullenMancers,33jq7r,trbstr,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:38:48 2015 UTC,"So I was at the BioWare Base at this past PAX East, and Sarah Hayward mentioned cheating on Kaidan, and I shouted out ""I did not cheat on him!""  It got a laugh out of everyone, and she went on to say ""If you're taking a break from Kaidan...""  No.  I did not cheat on him.  I am not taking a break from him.  He broke my heart and I moved on.  To THANE."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,ifeelwitty,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"I saw him at Huerta Memorial just now. Its too cruel to make him fall in love with you when he's near the end of his life. And he have his wife waiting for him at the other side and they really love each other. So, I'm not going there."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,ifeelwitty,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"See, I think it's top cruel to leave him alone.  He says to you that he was essentially dead until he met you, and you gave him hope and a tiny bit of happiness at the end.  In my head canon,he was never a very good match with Irikah.  They loved each other, but she didn't understand the brutality he had inside.  She wanted him to change.  Whereas Shepard accepts him for who he is.  Sometimes the best way to protect people is to kill other people.  If you romance him, you can see him really light up again."
CullenMancers,33jq7r,dingoesatemycat,2,Thu Apr 23 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"Oh man oh man oh man...  First off, DEFINITELY play them!  I also suck at aiming, so go with easy play.  Now, as I'm the Spoiler Queen, I'll try really hard not to spoil anything, but if you're super sensitive to that sort of thing, you may want to avoid reading this.  Advice for the first game: Play as Femshep (duh).  Jennifer Hale is a far better VA than Mark Meer.  And broShep is just out to get alien tail.  Femshep may be as well, but at least she's more classy about it.  Listen to Wrex over Ashley.  Stick with Kaidan over Ashley - there's no room for racist bitches on the Normandy.  Don't get sucked into Kaidan's deep eyes or glorious ass - Thane's eyes and ass are much more glorious.  Be nice to Conrad Verner.  The results are hilarious.  Make sure to punch Al-Jilani.  The results are also hilarious.  Second game - I love Garrus, but he's been permanently friend zoned by my Shepard.  I'd much rather get high and a little bit itchy than go into anaphylactic shock.  This will make sense once you play the game.  Don't trust the Illusive Man.  He may be Martin Sheen, but he's still a terrorist.  Spend as much time as possible with Joker and with Thane.  Because Thane.  THANE.  There's some fantastic smut out there with Thane (just call me the Spoiler Smut Queen).  Again, hallucinations > anaphylactic shock.  Hang out with Tali a lot, too.  Liara's ok, but she tried too hard to be badass in the second game, and it came off as kind of childish to me.  Avoid Jacob.  I'm not quite sure why I hate Jacob as much as I do, but I really hate him.  Try to get as many crew members loyal as possible (it's possible to get them all, but difficult).  Even if a few aren't loyal, it's still possible to get the best end game.  I can't elaborate more on that without spoiling stuff.  Third game- Don't be a dick.  This game gives you the most chances to be the galaxy's biggest dick.  Don't do it.  Read up on the Indoctrination Theory when you get close to the end game.  It's unfortunately the only way it makes any sense.  Also get lots of tissues - you're going to need them.  DLCs to get: Lair of the Shadow Broker is the best for the second game.  Arrival is important for the story.  None of the DLCs for the first game are that important, or good for that matter.  Overlord carries some emotional punch.  Leviathan adds a lot of back story.  Citadel is purely fan service, but it's fun.  Although it does add a really super soul crushingly sad bit for Thane...cries in corner  So I was at the BioWare Base this past PAX East, and Sarah Hayward mentioned something about cheating on Kaidan in ME2, and I shouted out ""I didn't cheat on him!""  I still maintain that stance, too.  As far as I'm concerned, Kaidan ended it himself in ME2, leaving me free to jump Thane's bones.  The Thane fandom has universally agreed that Thane ""goes commando"" and is ribbed for your pleasure.    I always fall for the guys with enough baggage to sink a ship.  Thanks, BioWare, for ruining me for normal men!  Also my next planned tattoo is the N7 insignia.  I just need to decide where to put it.  I'd like to get the Inquisition heraldry on my back calf, but I need to let this obsession simmer for a bit longer before permanently carving it into my flesh.  I've been into Mass Effect for six years, so I think that's long enough.  Dragon Age's only been on my obsession plate for four months."

Does the above reference refer to the game or unofficial literature?   ...My next play through, I'm going to romance Cullen again, aren't I? It's the Alistair affect."
CullenMancers,338x8g,steggo,3,Mon Apr 20 22:52:13 2015 UTC,"The link is an AO3 fic. It's a little spoilery for CotJ so if you haven't done the quest read at your own risk. Not that I've read it. But my friend, yeah, my friend told me...  And yes, it's definitely the Alistair Effect. It's like one minute your Inquisitor is walking along all ""la di da di da"" and then BAM! she's kissing Cullen on the ramparts and you're all ""wait, how'd this happen."" Then he gets all growly with that runner and you just decide it doesn't matter anyway. Same thing with Alistair, one second your killing darkspawn the next this sweetheart of a man is handing your Warden a rose and you just can't say no! He's so nervous and shy and sweet! Ugh! I'm going to have to play DAO again! At least that's how it happens with me. :P  I can't stop picking the flirty options with these two. I've got a serious weakness for Templars. They are irresistible.  EDIT: Hehe. ""Alistair Effect"" A game where all the characters are Alistair in space. Oh Goodness! BW needs to make me this game!"
CullenMancers,338x8g,xStephyG,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:11:52 2015 UTC,Research tells me that story is not how I want my Commander.  I would totally play the space Alistair game. Totally with you on the weakness for Templars...none of the DA2 romance options had quite the same innocent/naughty feel to them.
CullenMancers,338x8g,steggo,2,Tue Apr 21 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"Oh I completely agree with you. I would never want Cullen to be this way but a little smutty AU never hurt anyone. ;) Besides it was mostly the squeaked in fluffiness at the end that sold me on this fic. I'm a sucker for fluff.  I think the closest thing we got to a sweet templar romance in 2 was Sebastian ""Holier than Thou"" Vael. And that was just... really, BioWare!? A chaste relationship with this arrogant prick? He's pretty and he's got a sexy voice but the shit that comes out of his mouth makes me want to punch his stupid face. No thank you! I'd rather see my Hawke die alone before I see her end up with him."

To be more specific, I think it's a comfort issue.  Leading men: check Advising the Inquisitor: Check Flirting with an attractive chick:  oh maker fumble  Like, it's not even sexual situations in general that cause him to fumble (watch his reaction to the Iron Bull scene), but any time he could be put in a vulnerable position he hesitates.  Then as soon as he's assured that he isn't at risk of being hurt, he's all over you on the battlements and taking you on his desk.  It's adorable :D."

CullenMancers,32v31n,ceranna,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:27:46 2015 UTC,"OK, so going into to detail (this is my head canon that I've been scoping out for a fanfiction that will probably never see the light of day)  My Amell isn't actually the HoF or a Grey Warden.  Aedan Cousland becames the HoF (and ends up with Morrigan,  see when I say everybody gets a partner, I mean everybody).  When Duncan came to the Circle tower, she leaves with him to head to Ostagar but ditches him on the way to live a happy life (or so she thinks) as an apostate in the Wilds.  Darkspawn ruin everything of course, so she ends up fleeing to Lothering where she runs into Alistair, Aedan, Morrigan, and Barkspawn.  And then the rest of the story follows Origins.  (she has a er passionate first love type of relationship with Alistair that ends in angsty goodness and bruised hearts at the end of Origins).  The story kinda touches on the timeline from Origins through Inquisition from the POV of someone who is sorta outside of the main events.  It's really a way for me to tell the story and add in lore and my bits of theory in without running the risk of creating a total Mary Sue OC.    Totally AU, I know."

CullenMancers,32v31n,cipher_six,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:23:11 2015 UTC,"HA! I have a story JUST LIKE THAT that's my headcanon too! The whole thing started because I was sore that there was no apostate origin for mages and no commoner origin for humans. I ended up with two Wardens too, because everybody needs to have somebody!  Ayla - human rogue of the Ranger spec (or whatever it was called) who learns to be a bard from Leliana.  Belladonna - elven apostate of the Arcane Warrior spec and a penchant for blood magic.   First things first, on his way to Highever, Duncan comes across an apostate elf who beats the crap out of some random nasty humans who are trying to have their way with some other city elf girl, in clear view of some templars who decide they aren't going to intervene until she reveals herself as a mage. Duncan approves of her sense of justice (even if it is a little harsh) and doesn't particularly like the idea of her getting arrested for doing what amounts to the right thing, so she gets recruited.  While in Highever, Belladonna, who was originally from the alienage there, goes to visit her grandfather while Duncan stays in the castle. The attack occurs, the Cousland recruit is killed and Duncan returns to find Belladonna's grandfather's house collapsed due to fire. He can't find her, so presumes that she's dead and moves on. Belladonna, for her part, spends two days trying to dig herself out of the rubble and, upon finding that Duncan left without her, decides to stick around to help heal the wounded.   So, on his way back to Ostagar, Duncan stops at Redcliff to talk to Eamon about sending troops, he meets Ayla who is, at the time, a shepherd trying to get people to pay attention to her warnings about some kind of blighted wolves attacking the sheep. Duncan takes her seriously, they go off to find the source, Ayla proves she's got talent with a bow - boom, recruited.  They get to Ostagar, Alya and Alistair meet up, Alya performs the Joining, yada yada...  After that, the main difference is that the first half of the game is split between two parties. Ayla, Alistair, Morrigan, Barkspawn, Leliana and Sten all end up in one group, while Ayla ends up running into Levi the Trader and promises to help him with his Warden's Keep issue, at which point Zevran, hunting for Ayla and Alistair, stumbles across the sight of a woman with a sword slicing through darkspawn, makes an incorrect assumption and attacks Belladonna thinking she's Ayla. The end result is that Belladonna ends up traveling with Zevran, Shale and her own dog (having taken Aedan's with her after Aedan died).   Belladonna wants to Join, and accidentally does so when she drinks the mysterious potion at Warden's Keep. The two groups eventually meet, Alistair has a small explosion when he learns Belladonna was supposed to be at Ostagar but wasn't, and things continue as normal, culminating in Alistair and Ayla on the throne with Belladonna and Zevran running off to Antiva together to take control of the Crows :)  Later Hawke and Anders end up in a chance meeting with Belladonna after the events of DA2... my headcanon hasn't quite finished working itself out around the events of Inquisition yet :P  Sorry for the long, un-asked-for story. I just love head-canon like this :D"

I've been slowly outlining it all and getting it on paper just so I don't forget the epic drama that spans multiple POV and years haha.     Alistair has a small explosion when he learns Belladonna was supposed to be at Ostagar but wasn't   haha, that's in my headcanon too!  When Alistair finds out Amell ditched Duncan to go play apostate, he flips shit.

It's sad how beaten down he is at this point, but honestly? Beaten down but not broken. He never broke.   I don't remember exactly where I got it from, maybe it was in Origins somewhere and later got taken out, but I always thought Templar abilities were tied to Willpower. Cullen survived where nobody else did through sheer force of his will. I always thought that must make him one of the most powerful/formidable Templars in all of Thedas. I imagined him being able to Holy Smite a legion of demons once he recovered and I was really hoping to see him in action in DA2/Inquisition.   But nay, much like Kaidan in Mass Effect we never got to see his powers in a cutscene. I will be forever disappointed."
CullenMancers,32v31n,Emptyplates,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:26:39 2015 UTC,It's totally my headcanon too that Templar abilities are tied to willpower. I can't think of any official lore regarding it though. Hm!

CullenMancers,32tfk9,Rhydnara,14,Thu Apr 16 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"I believe it's just a common trope with no actual canon backing.  I kinda prefer the Cullen and Dorian becoming good friends idea myself. Now, whether or not that happens after a bit of jealousy, well, that's up to the writer.  Also, I'm at work so I'm not going to find and link it, but The Scarecrow and the Tin Man on AO3 is excellent for this (it might be the other way around, I don't have my bookmarks here).   EDIT: I am now home from work.  The Scarecrow and the Tin Man."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,wingedmurasaki,2,Thu Apr 16 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"Aw, that was sweet :)"
CullenMancers,32tfk9,Glocksnkittens,10,Fri Apr 17 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of him being insecure jealous until he realizes Dorian is gay and not hitting on the Inquisitor, and then they become chess playing besties.  And then the Inquisitor and Dorian gossip endlessly about Cullen's glorious backside."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,ceranna,8,Thu Apr 16 18:53:45 2015 UTC,Indeed  I think it's just universally accepted fact that any Inquisitor that romances Cullen has Dorian as her BFF
CullenMancers,32tfk9,Doctor_Wife,8,Thu Apr 16 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is mentioned in game. I was actually really disappointed that I didn't get as much gossip or jealousy as in DAO. You get that one jab about strapping young templars from Dorian and that's it. Especially playing a mage, I was expecting to get a lot more shit for that.  That said, my husband was jealous of a gay friend of mine when we first started dating until he noticed my friend being almost as interested in him as I was. I can see a similar Dorian/Cullen interaction happening."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,ceranna,5,Thu Apr 16 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"There's the Orlesians in the hall that gossip about relationship.    They even make snide remarks if you aren't in a relationship D:  Not as great as DA:O though,  I agree with that"
CullenMancers,32tfk9,radtastic,4,Thu Apr 16 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"""We've reached the climax!""  ""We're not the only ones...""  I do wish there was more gossip, but it's there if you look for it!"
CullenMancers,32tfk9,laurathexplorer,5,Thu Apr 16 19:43:33 2015 UTC,At one point when I assembled my war council Leliana makes this snide remark about someone being rather eager to see the Inquisitor. I was rather hoping for more though.
CullenMancers,32tfk9,theRadioStarr,6,Fri Apr 17 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"I'm guilty of writing this, but it was purely from an ignorant standpoint. Because you can flirt shamelessly with Dorian through the entire game, I imagined it more as an insecurity: she's been giving Cullen some attention, and maybe he's starting to get his hopes up, and then she starts hitting on Dorian, hard, so he gets confused and jealous.   Then he learns that Dorian also likes him, and he realizes he still has a chance, so him and Dorian become friends."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,cipher_six,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:38:51 2015 UTC,So everyone says that in-game Dorian is attracted to Cullen. I've never gotten a line/gossip about that in the game. Do you know where it comes from?
CullenMancers,32tfk9,theRadioStarr,3,Fri Apr 17 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure to be honest. Maybe because of the comment he makes to you after you and Cullen are established? But that doesn't make sense either, because Dorian says it's something he finds adorable about the Inquisitor.   I always thought that Dorian would appreciate the fact that Cullen is a good looking man, but also knows that's not where Cullen falls sexually, and probably just teases him for the sake of making Cullen blush. Thats what I mean when I say ""likes him."" He knows he won't get anything and he's happy to just watch from afar and enjoy the show for what it's worth.   That's how I've written it, myself. Can't speak for others. It's probably just an accepted collective head canon."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,ceranna,3,Fri Apr 17 03:32:52 2015 UTC,"I think Cullenites are like ""Who WOULDN""T want Cullen??"""
CullenMancers,32tfk9,theRadioStarr,3,Fri Apr 17 03:44:06 2015 UTC,There's also basically this.
CullenMancers,32tfk9,ceranna,5,Fri Apr 17 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's mainly people's personal head-canon.  If anything from the game,  Cullen isn't the jealous type at all.  Just like a lot of people kinda assume that Cullen is either sexually inexperienced or kinda a prig (which is soo NOT the case, see his reaction to Bull romance)  Sure, if you are flirting with Blackwall and/or Solas and start up with Cullen, he asks you to break it off with them but it never comes off as a jealous thing.  For me it's more of a ""I'm not here for games/casual, not anymore. So if you want this,  is prefer it if you were all in, the way I would be.""  And if you choose to say no,  he still respects you.  No raging no drama."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,ceranna,6,Thu Apr 16 17:24:02 2015 UTC,I like to think of Cullen being a stuttering fool when flirting and then super confidant dom in bed.  But that's probably because that's what I want IRL.
CullenMancers,32tfk9,nionvox,8,Thu Apr 16 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"Haha I think it's quite possible!  I mean he's only super adorably awkward when he's unsure of your affections.  Once he knows you like him, BAM he has you against the battlements, in front of every body.   (Also yeah...I agree with you...I like the quiet reserve until it's bedroom time)"
CullenMancers,32tfk9,khaosanomaly,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"Ca we all agree that scene was very, very hot? Hawwwwwt."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,khaosanomaly,2,Sun May 3 15:16:39 2015 UTC,"I'm seriously in this camp right here though my headcanon is that he's really inexperience with intimacy/relationships in general but he had to have visited the Blooming Rose at least once or twice in his tenure at Kirkwall. Confident with the smut, not so much with the emotional part of relationships."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,cipher_six,2,Thu Apr 16 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know where he would have learned all the things he does in my fantasies, but I like to think he knows what he's doing down there."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,Staleina,3,Thu Apr 16 21:14:36 2015 UTC,"I have this weird headcanon that post-Chantry Blow Up, Viscountess Hawke finally decided to get Cullen out of his funk about not stopping Meredith by dragging him to the Blooming Rose and/or used him as a freinds-with-benefits thing cause Sebastian left her for not killing Anders (Killing everyone isn't the answer, ok?)  THAT or... Isabella decided to give him a few pointers."
CullenMancers,32tfk9,khaosanomaly,2,Thu Apr 16 21:35:41 2015 UTC,"Someone sends him to the Blooming Rose. He wouldn't go on his own (he could barely even bring himself to discuss visiting in a professional manner). So they send him because they realize he needs it and they buy only the best for him, someone who can give him the emotional treatment as well as the physical...and there you go. Also this woman, understanding Cullen's reserved personality, taught him a few things to use when he does find The One. Hence his special tag on Tumblr. ;D"
CullenMancers,32u6rx,ceranna,11,Thu Apr 16 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"Although I haven't put too much thought into it I have no doubt that a templar Inquisitor would be just awful. Even if they supported his decisions regarding lyrium use it would be cruel to be with him and use lyrium yourself. It would be like drinking in front of a recovering alcoholic. Not to mention him having to watch the woman he loves disappear right before his eyes as the Inquisitor starts to lose her memory and all the other nastiness that comes with lyrium usage.  Also, blood mage. I know he'd never ever be with a blood mage but still can you imagine trying to romance him as a blood mage after what was done to him in Kinloch Hold? That would just... ugh! I don't even want to think about it!"
CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,8,Thu Apr 16 19:23:01 2015 UTC,"I find it cruel that a warrior Inquisitor has the chance to specialize as a Templar.  And then go around collecting lyrium philters.  I can imagine (I don't want to, but I can) her going up to him and asking how to take lyrium...and his heart just exploding in agony."
CullenMancers,32u6rx,Rhydnara,6,Thu Apr 16 21:16:45 2015 UTC,"Oh goodness. This young, sweet warrior walking up to him all wide-eyed asking him about becoming a templar. Telling him how she wants to protect the faithful and he wants to tell her not to do it but her devotion to the Maker is something he loves about her so he helps her even though he knows it'll destroy them both... ;_;  I don't want to talk about this anymore!"
CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,4,Thu Apr 16 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"Oh god, Stephy you just had to run with it!!"
CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,5,Thu Apr 16 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"I know, I'm sorry!"
CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,4,Thu Apr 16 22:31:37 2015 UTC,"So this tangential to the conversation, but I always felt that Cullen just would not be attracted to a much younger/innocent woman.    Like I understand the attraction of that fantasy, but I feel like Cullen would be all like ""you need an adult?  You're the herald of Andraste FFS""  Buuuut that's just me."
CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,3,Thu Apr 16 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"When I say young I mean a woman in her mid to late twenties. As for innocence I think he'd be okay with that, but not naivety. Something that a lot of people mix up. Someone can be innocent in the sense they've lived a sheltered life and not experienced much hardship but they don't have to be naive.  I was picturing Trevelyan in this description. With either origin (Noble or Magi) they've lived a sheltered life. They either grew up a noblewoman who has been promised to the Chantry or as a Circle Mage who lived in the ""sedate"" Circle of Ostwick. Neither of these upbringings leave a lot of room for hardship, hence my description of ""innocent.""  But some of this is going on conversation choices I make in my game. I don't actually know if you can have a more ""life-hardened"" Trevelyan if you choose different options. My choices are always ""was fine in the Circle, gets along great with the family.""  I wasn't talking about the ""school girl in pigtails"" fantasy. That's just... ugh, no. Cullen would definitely not have any interest in a woman that acted like she had air between her ears. Also, she would be dead before she could even make it to Skyhold!"
CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,2,Thu Apr 16 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a lot of fan fic where it the Inky is like 21 or 22 (there's some that do it REALLY well), but most its a little like....hmm...  I get the difference between innocence and naivety when you put like that.  Kinda like practical knowledge vs theoretical.    For some reason, and maybe it was just the way I ended up designing my Mage Trevelyn (she looks fierce yo, I loved it), but I also had it in my head that she was in her 30s, and like Wynne spent time outside of the Circles, and was a bit more world weary."
CullenMancers,32u6rx,steggo,2,Fri Apr 17 02:59:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's all a matter of our own headcanons. My mage Trevelyan is in her mid-twenties and lived a privileged life. She was fine in the Circle because she never had troubles there. She was free to visit home and live the life of a noblewoman. But she isn't stupid. She knows that not every mage had the same experience as her. While she never saw anything first-hand she heard the whispers, the stories coming out of Kirkwall. She chose to stay neutral, like many in Ostwick's Circle not because she believed that mages should be locked up but because she was content in the Circle. She doesn't want them abolished, she would rather see them turned into something a little more akin to what Dorian describes the Circles in Tevinter as, places of higher learning. A safe place for mages to practice their craft, not a prison. She just wants every mage to be able to have the same experience she had.  She's an optimist. She just wants to believe there is good in everyone, that the world can be a better place for everyone. Some may call it naive but I'd rather think of it as optimism. I personally believe all this for the real world (I mean the equality bit, not the mage bit) and I don't think I'm that naive. Gosh, I hope I'm not naive. Would I know if I was? Oh no! Now I'm worrying I'm a fool! :P"
CullenMancers,32u6rx,Bubblystia,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely headcanons!  A lot of people kinda complained that the Inquisitor doesn't have much of an orgin story, but I actually liked it.    It allows us players to come up with such diverse backgrounds and personalities :D.  Like my Inquisitor was practically cut off from her family, but was able to leverage her nobility to get her into the thick of things.  She was a bit of a radical, leaning towards the more revolutionary side of the Aequitarians, but the events of Kirkwall were a ""Come to Maker"" moment for her.    She ends up heading to the conclave with the purpose of restructuring the function of Circles to places of learning, not prisons (much like yours does as well).    But because of her experiences, shes a bit more of a pragmatist with a biting sense of humor.    Gosh, I hope I'm not naive. Would I know if I was? Oh no! Now I'm worrying I'm a fool! :P   Nah!  Im an optimist too!  Besides...we live longer :D"
CullenMancers,32u6rx,Rhydnara,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:41:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I prefer the approach that was taken with the blank slate background for DAO and DAI. I liked 2 but I sort of felt that BW really wanted us to choose one path and make Hawke have one set of beliefs: Side with the mages, believe in mage freedom. I would have chosen this path regardless for my canon but any playthrough I tried where I chose anything other than this went unfinished because it felt strange.   Meredith was made to be too much of a cartoonish super villain, IMO. I'm always half expecting her to reveal some hilariously ill-conceived super weapon, like a ray gun that only fires on Saturday mornings between 9 and 9:30 am but oh no! it's 9:29 am! Tune in next week kids to find out if Hawke can thwart the dastardly Knight-Commander! And don't forget to ask your parents to buy you Hawkey-Os! It's the cereal of Champions! ;)"

CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,2,Fri Apr 17 13:27:12 2015 UTC,I agree! I would say a Mage Trevelyan Inquisitor in her mid twenties and an ENFP is perfect for him. While the worst would be a Warrior Templar Inquisitor either very young or old and something more T and S like an ISTP/ ESTP or ESTJ
CullenMancers,32u6rx,Rhydnara,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:47:47 2015 UTC,"My head canon warrior Trevelyen wasn't exactly sheltered...She was sent to be fostered with her second cousin, future Warden Cousland, and the two kind of...  Not very sheltered at all."
CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe she's not that innocent otherwise, though. I mean, the Chantry keeps the whole downside of lyrium addiction on the DL, and maybe the Inquisitor hasn't quite put two and two together yet about blue lyrium sucking too (not as bad as red, but still).   Oh. I can see it now. The Inquisitor coming to Cullen to tell him all about how she's going to follow the path of the Templar. Especially now that the world needs real templars more than ever, what with the collapse of the order. She'd imagine he'd be proud of her..."
CullenMancers,32u6rx,xStephyG,6,Thu Apr 16 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly!   A Templar and Cullen would be just...really terrible.  Every time he'd kiss her he'd taste her daily Lyrium dose.    Angsty.  Blood mage!  Oh, I totally forgot about that.  Yeah that would not be healthy. Although now I'm picturing Unromanced Cullen meeting up with F!HoF Amell post-Inquisiton,  feelings reignite, and then he finds out she's a blood mage."
CullenMancers,32u6rx,Rhydnara,5,Thu Apr 16 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"Oh no! Blood mage Amell is far too angsty for me! Not touching that one. Don't even want to think about it. Sticks fingers in ears Lalalalalala. I'm not listening.  And there's actually a fic I can't find that describes how Cullen would feel about a templar Inquisitor perfectly. It's the embodiment of why I don't read angst. It made me cry. I wish I could find it, though. It was really good! I'll keep looking. If I find it I'll update.  EDIT: Ugh. Couldn't find it but as consolation here's a love song that reminds me of Cole's remark about the Cullen romance: ""Safe and solid, protecting and proud.

I don't necessarily consider Necromancy as it but it's probably as close as you can get to Blood Mage in DA:I I think perhaps a full-on Pro-Chantry, Templars on Leashes Inquisitor might be... detrimental to him too. Any Inquisitor that insists that he continues to use Lyrium during the entire game. I mean I get it, you want your Commander in peek condition but at the same time those vids on Youtube, it's just... heartbreaking to see him succumb to something he didn't want. I honestly would have rather he just be replaced than force him to stay as Commander while taking Lyrium.

CullenMancers,32pgi3,xStephyG,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:43:57 2015 UTC,Oh my god. Running to Amazon to buy this right now. Can't wait for May!
CullenMancers,32pgi3,butterfly_beatrice,7,Thu Apr 16 07:23:11 2015 UTC,"It was confirmed by Cullen's writer he's second oldest, and his brother and him are very close in age, which would make it Mia - Cullen - <brother> - Rosalie!  I can't find the link right now, but it was on her twitter a while back. :)"
CullenMancers,32pgi3,voodooflag,4,Wed Apr 15 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"Yessss,  my guess was right"
CullenMancers,32pgi3,ceranna,5,Wed Apr 15 22:54:11 2015 UTC,Alistair wearing Cullen's pants...twerking? I approve of this and all of its implications.
CullenMancers,32pgi3,Doctor_Wife,2,Wed Apr 15 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   You have to be following her in order to see her tweets, so I'll confirm if my request doesn't get denied."
CullenMancers,32pgi3,theRadioStarr,3,Wed Apr 15 22:50:15 2015 UTC,"Wait! Someone has the WoT Vol. 2 already!? But BW isn't supposed to be shipping them for two more weeks!  Also Rosalie Rutherford is a lovely name. I hope we get to meet Cullen's family eventually. As for his brother's name, I wouldn't venture a guess, myself. I'd headcanon a name and when it didn't match BW's actual name for him I'd be disappointed."
CullenMancers,32pgi3,xStephyG,2,Wed Apr 15 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"Not received but apparently it's in a preview pages for the book? I haven't exactly gone to search though I plan to.  And I know what you mean about not wanting to name his vrother. Though honestly, i can probably slap my preference as an alias for an in-hiding Cullen fanfic. :P"
CullenMancers,32pgi3,xStephyG,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:42:55 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... Just checked the tumblr and they didn't give a source link so I'm going to remain skeptical until I either see actual proof from a source or I get my hands on my book and see for myself. It's not that I think they're a liar I'm not just willing to believe everything I read on the internet blindly.  And there's nothing wrong with giving your own name. There's a chance BW may never reveal the other Rutherford brother's name. I doubt it, we Cullenites are rabid fans and we must know everything. BW knows this so I'm sure they'll tell us everything we want to know but there's still a chance it will remain a mystery.  Personally, I'm more curious about Cullen's parents. He mentions his siblings are still alive but not his parents. Are Mr. and Mrs. Rutherford still around?"
CullenMancers,32pgi3,xStephyG,-1,Wed Apr 15 18:57:04 2015 UTC,"You do realise the preview pages are from the actual book, right? That doing this is tantamount to pirating the book."
CullenMancers,32pgi3,theRadioStarr,2,Wed Apr 15 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"I can't even tell you all how much I wished I had seen this yesterday. I may have to make a few minor edits to my fic now.   Either way, thank you so much for sharing! Has anyone figured out if Rosalie is older or younger than Branson?"
CullenMancers,32pgi3,ceranna,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:18:02 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah,  you would huh?  P.S. Loved everything about the last chapter and I owe you a detailed comment on Ao3  I would make an educated guess that It goes Mia, Cullen, Branson, and Rosalie.   Cullen leaves home at 13,  and he talks about practicing chess with his brother which makes me think they are close, and in particular close in age.  The fact that he barely mentions Rosalie makes me assume that she must have been fairly young when he left (i.e he doesn't know her they way he does Mia and Branson)  Of course...I could be totally wrong"
CullenMancers,32pgi3,theRadioStarr,2,Wed Apr 15 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I'm always open to feedback, as I've mentioned many times before.   You make a good point... I assumed his brother would be the baby. Oh well, I'll just have to make another minor edit when it all comes out and the info is final."
CullenMancers,32pgi3,ceranna,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:37:28 2015 UTC,Is all good.  Now though I'm totally headcanoning that Mia practically raised Branson and Rosalie after their parents deaths during the Blight.    Family relationshipppppsss
CullenMancers,32pgi3,theRadioStarr,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"Basically, this. Canon accepted.   I was thinking this while writing, actually, that even if Cullen's parents were still alive, that Mia would be in the best place to take care of everyone. Their parents would be starting to get up there, and she's still young enough to care for everyone effectively."
CullenMancers,32pgi3,ifeelwitty,2,Wed Apr 15 22:55:41 2015 UTC,"As the eldest, I can totally understand Mia's wrath in her first letter to Cullen about not knowing if he was even alive. It's up to me to take care of you all and keep track of you and yet you neglect to let me know you're OK or not OK?! Little siblings, am I right?"
CullenMancers,32pgi3,theRadioStarr,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:48:42 2015 UTC,"As an only child, I can only dream.   I was supposed to be the oldest of three, though, and I feel like that's totally the way I would be, too."

These are just a few of my favourite romance shots from the game so far - including my fly cam of the desk scene. ;)  A little head canon for funsies: This is Evelyn ""Evie"" Trevelyan, Knight Enchanter. She was content in the Circle, studying Creation magic to be a healer. She was completely smitten with Cullen the moment she met him but also scared because he was a templar and she was a sheltered Circle mage and noblewoman. The kiss scene on the ramparts was her very first kiss.  I'd love to see other people screen shots or just hear your head canon's for your characters and/or romance!"

CullenMancers,31wwm4,insideofadog,7,Wed Apr 8 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"Epistolary fics are brilliant! Thanks for pointing it out--I definitely need to read it. I've been trying to avoid Cullen fics as much as possible until I finish my own, but now that cross-pollination isn't a concern, I can start the overwhelming task of catching up!  PS: The average novel is 95k, so 135k+ is pretty extraordinary."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Khirsahle,3,Thu Apr 9 01:50:59 2015 UTC,Are you....you wouldn't happen to be the writer of As The World Falls Down would you?
CullenMancers,31wwm4,ceranna,3,Thu Apr 9 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, hello! Yes. :) I'm late to the Cullenmancer party, but I heard this was an awesome subforum."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Khirsahle,6,Thu Apr 9 02:21:41 2015 UTC,"Eep!  Just so you know,  you kinda have a fan club going on in this here subreddit  Annd now I feel a tad creepy"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,ceranna,5,Thu Apr 9 02:28:49 2015 UTC,"That is way too nice of you to say! I swear, the Cullen side of the fandom is the nicest ever. I'm so glad I joined you guys."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Khirsahle,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, actually--I haven't read an actual fanfic since mid-January. For whatever reason, I was having problems finding things I wanted so I decided to write my own. Since then, I've seen some interesting things but I can't read them! I suppose they'll be there when I'm ready to start up again."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Khirsahle,2,Thu Apr 9 02:22:10 2015 UTC,"I'm so curious about your process. I've never tried an epistolary story before. Did you have the entire story plotted, or did it unfold as you went? Did you find you needed to adjust your style to the format, or did it come fairly naturally?"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Khirsahle,2,Thu Apr 9 02:31:39 2015 UTC,"Oh snap you asked me about my process. Brace yo self:  Well, I basically ran by the canon DAI story, so it was already plotted out for me. I mostly wrote it as I went, though. My main goal was to always keep my Inquisitor moving, and if she wasn't moving, she or Cullen needed to be working on something else: their pasts, their relationship with each other, or, to a lesser degree, the Inquisitor's friendship with Cassandra. If a letter or a chapter didn't accomplish this, it got tossed. Each letter/chapter also had to either reference an ongoing motif (birds, dreams, etc.) or advance along something that I'd had in a previous chapter (which I thought of as my Chekhov's guns).  It's not entirely epistolary--I knew there would have to be some solo journal entries if I wanted characters to actually be able to talk to each other (and HAVE SEX), so I set up the context for those journal entries early to hopefully smooth the transition. But I do use letters whenever I can, because I want to evoke that old-fashioned romance feel.  My Big Secret (which isn't a secret at all) is that I have read an awful lot of romance novels and an awful lot of Victorian literature and what I think has happened is that I have an ear for both of these now. The overall structure of letters/journal is not super different from Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. About halfway through my story, a particularly astute reader asked me, ""Is your Inquisitor modeled after Jane Eyre or Lucy Snowe?"" and she is, an awful lot, and I didn't realize it until then.  So did I have to adjust my style? I found they went together quite naturally. My heroine was already an academic, a writer, and kind of a teacher-lecturer type. And actually tons of Cullen's letters already exist in the game: whenever you do a War Table mission with him, he sends you a note, and you can read those and get an idea as to his written voice.  I actually stepped outside of my comfort zone the most when I had to write an action scene or the card-playing scene, which involved a new narrator, a lot of different voices, AND two embedded stories."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Graendal,2,Thu Apr 9 03:19:24 2015 UTC,"""If a letter or a chapter didn't accomplish this, it got tossed.""  That's a lesson I still haven't learned, at least in my own writing. I edit novels for a living, and I am very good at pointing out what needs to be cut in other manuscripts, but the self-discipline it takes to edit your own work that way is pretty impressive!  I'm curious: what do you do to internalize and write in a character's voice? You mentioned elsewhere that you had trouble with Varric at first--was it just writing more in his voice that made it snap into place, or did you have another method? I tend to go by keywords or phrases that we associate with the characters and using those to trigger the reader's memory of how it sounded. So Vivienne is an obvious example--when writing her, I make sure that she says ""dear"" early in her dialog, because I have such clear memories of her saying that in the game. The problem with that is that the impulse becomes very strong to overuse those triggers."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Graendal,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:52:33 2015 UTC,"See, I like cutting. Tightens things up. You say to me, ""Most books are 95k"" and I think, man, what can I get rid of? But that's not really the nature of fanfiction, is it? It goes up, and it's out there. If I edit, it'll have to be the whole thing, probably all at once.  The voices are actually a bit easier for me when I'm writing entire journal entries or letters from someone's POV. I don't have to think about how they'd talk, I have to think about how they'd write. Varric makes lots of snide remarks about narrative structure, for example, and leaves notes like ""punch this up later"", because he's an author (I wanted to put in a joke about ""STET"" because he bitches about his editor, but didn't find the right place).   So, for me: write a whole entry in someone's written voice, focusing on levels of formality and diction, hit my stride about halfway through, go back and fix the beginning. Once I've written something written by someone, I have a much better grasp on what their spoken dialogue is going to look like.  I keep my scenes small and personal, too. If Varric is talking in Cassandra's journal and he has six lines and only, oh, four or five are really spot-on, nobody notices. Lots of the game's banter is in small pairs or groups, too, if you notice.  But if he's, say, at a sexy masquerade party (sorry I haven't read your story yet, see above about not reading other folks' stuff) where everyone is talking, and he has only one line, it has to be absolutely perfect. That is stressful for me. I was able to do it passably in the card scene, but I also use in-game lines and fill in around them, so it was less stressful because the framework was already there.   I'm about to put up a big group banter that's entirely mine, though, and we'll see how it lands. It's hard to tell if something's really good unless you can barely remember writing it, and truly see what it actually says, and in a way, that kind of delay is not the nature of fanfiction.  So I'll put it up today and see if people like it, and if they don't, well, hopefully they'll like the next one. Fanfiction readers tend to be a kind bunch, and even if they don't like it, they'll let you know in a way that makes it easier to fix, at least in my experience."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Graendal,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:18:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to do lots more edits and cuts you could always go the route of 50 shades... change the names, modify the setting so you don't get sued... publish a best-seller, get a movie deal..."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,ceranna,4,Tue Apr 14 19:37:40 2015 UTC,I've been following this one and I think the format of letters and journal entries is pretty interesting. It gets surprisingly sexy given the constraints of the format!
CullenMancers,31wwm4,ceranna,2,Wed Apr 8 21:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it ended up sexier than I initially intended. I was like, ""I'll put in maybe one quarter of the sex that shows up in the things I usually read, that will be good"" and then I cut out a bunch of sex and was like ""there's really only two really racy paragraphs left here, that will be fine.""  And then I re-read it and was like, man, when did this get so sexy?"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Rhydnara,3,Wed Apr 8 21:47:38 2015 UTC,"Well, uh... no complaints here  Edited to add: You could put up an ""outtakes reel"" after the story is finished, with the stuff you cut out. I'm sure your readers would appreciate it. :P"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Elorenalory,3,Wed Apr 8 23:22:38 2015 UTC,"Most of this is genuinely no good. It's the literary equivalent of a trash can full of dicks I pruned off and then threw away. Without any context, they aren't any fun.  Just sad, pruned dicks.  snort  Anyway, don't worry. I'll write somethin' sexy before the end, I promise."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Rhydnara,3,Thu Apr 9 02:42:28 2015 UTC,"Oh man!!!  I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity.    Honestly I've been following your fanfiction for a long time.  I think it's brilliant and is definitely my all time favorite CullenxTrevelyn fan fic.    I really have just so much respect for your writing and your characters.  Looking forward to the ending and if I may be so bold to ask, are you planning on a sequel?"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Rhydnara,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks!  Honestly, I don't know about a sequel. Most of this story is just two people trying to figure themselves and their pasts out enough so that they can relate to another person in a healthy way. You know, using your words and stuff. It is secretly an incredibly boring story about communication.  One thing that I've tried to avoid is really Big, Persistent Misunderstandings, and I don't know what Evelyn and Cullen would have to work through that wouldn't involve such a thing.  ALTHOUGH, someone has suggested a story where a bunch of second-stringers and OC's like Ser Rylen and Ian the hedge mage and Captain Smythe go on adventures, so who knows??"

CullenMancers,31wwm4,perarduaetal,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:53:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the love! What was your favorite part, so far?"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,perarduaetal,3,Wed Apr 8 22:24:17 2015 UTC,My favorite part - the whole misunderstanding between them before on the way to the temple of Dumat and how they managed to work through that. I love the way you showed how their relationship became stronger after that.
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Rhydnara,2,Thu Apr 9 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"Probably the first/second time they have sex.  I'm a big fan of smut.  Or when she whispers 'cunt' to him.  I normally hate that word but his reaction was hilarious...and when she says penis.  The game of wicked grace was funny, too.  Just...everything!"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Rhydnara,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:33:48 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the not-so-sexy sex words came from writing about people who are themselves trying to write and talk to their partner about havin' sex. Writing about writing + sex = metasextuality?"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Rhydnara,2,Wed Apr 8 22:45:39 2015 UTC,Also the dream sequence after they have sex was brilliantly written.  I'm so jealous.  I have a really detailed head canon but can't get it down on paper.  I wish I had your writing skill.
CullenMancers,31wwm4,xeferial,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:37:42 2015 UTC,"WRITE! This is the first fanfic I've ever written, and by far the longest anything I've ever written. I really feel like I've improved as I've gone along.  If you feel like you can't just sit down and start writing, why not make a list of all the important things you think need to happen? It seems like you already have a story floating around in there. Then sit down and pick the one that you think would be the most fun to write about, or you feel like must exist, and then write that. Then start filling in around the edges, and see where you end up. After a while, you'll go back and look at your first scene, and you can fix it up the way it needs to be.  Writing is a process! You might just need to find the right process for you."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Elorenalory,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:54:00 2015 UTC,"I would like to second this. Most of the other stuff out there is alright but their Inquisitors are so generic. Your quiz has so much personality, she's actually interesting, I love it. The balance of actual story + sexy stuff is perfect. I'm not ashamed to read it in public. Sorry for gushing again! Now I'll go be a creeper over in the corner..."

CullenMancers,31wwm4,KindOwl,3,Thu Apr 9 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"Hello, hello! You might remember me as the person who spotted the Austen reference, was confused about whose letter was from whom, and one of two or three who knows what Epistolary means (I <3 you, /u/Khirsahle!). Thanks for the fix, it helped me when I went back for a re-read. Nice to be in a format that allows for more conversation!   It's been extremely refreshing to read an Inquisitor with as much intelligence and competence as your Evelyn and Cullen. Their own self-doubts and insecurities aside, as a mature professional, I enjoy seeing that sort of maturity that really does make sense.   Coming back to your fic -- and a rare few others -- is really like coming back to visit dear friends... Something that I think is the ultimate goal of fan fic.   So. You win fan fic."

CullenMancers,31wwm4,VintageLydia,2,Sat Apr 18 01:25:17 2015 UTC,"I gotta tell ya, I was really surprised about how enthusiastic folks were about the sex. I guess all the other smut I've read has been real smutty for like pages and pages and mine is like...3 paragraphs of sex and a bunch of talking and maybe a joke."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,KindOwl,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:49:38 2015 UTC,"But it was good!  I like the talky feelies and then the sex, and then more talky feelies."

CullenMancers,31wwm4,Rhydnara,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:41:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks for being patient now that I'm not updating as fast. I realized that things have to sit for at least three days or they're just not as good, and longer scenes take longer to write. The story's actually almost done; I'm just putting things up when I think they've been sufficiently revised.  I'm sad it's ending, too, but sometimes it's good to have an end, right?"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,theRadioStarr,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"As The World Falls Down   A bit off topic here, but do you have any other fanfiction or original works out there?

CullenMancers,31wwm4,theRadioStarr,2,Thu Apr 9 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party but I'm re-reading this now and it's the best fic I've read in a long time. I know others have said this, but I'm older and it's so nice to read something about two people my age who think and act and speak in a realistic way. About red templars and magic. With Jane Austen elements. What I'm saying is it's basically my favorite thing ever.   Something that's really standing out to me on this read through are the bits about Cullen and touch. Being allowed to touch Evelyn, Evelyn being willing to touch him. It's heartbreaking to me, especially how casually he thinks these things. I'm thinking it's because he sees himself as tainted and unclean, but if you have more thoughts on it I'd love to hear them because apparently I like to be sad about Cullen.  Also do you have a tumblr or blog you'd be willing to share?"
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Phaydre1,3,Sat Apr 11 06:31:55 2015 UTC,"I still haven't quite been able to figure out how to use tumblr properly--one disadvantage of ""older."" I'm still running at, like, LiveJournal speed. If I can piece it together, I might put a revision up on a tumblr. I've been keeping some general metrics and a journal of what it was like to write this story, too, so those might be fun to share.  I think you're spot-on with your ideas about what touch means in this story. I think for my Cullen, touch symbolizes everything in the entire world that he wants but isn't allowed to have, either because the world says he can't, or because he thinks he doesn't deserve it.  So I think, yes, it's primarily about him thinking he's unclean and undeserving of love, because of what he's done in his past and the fact that she can actually feel the physical manifestation of his guilt, the lyrium.   Also, there's the element of physical contact between mages and Templars being strictly forbidden, and the fact that dude is just really, really lonely. In the game he tells you he's come from this big, loud family, and that he didn't make a single friend in the past ten years at Kirkwall. The romantic encounters I wrote in for him sounded dreadfully impersonal and not very fulfilling, especially for someone who might be looking for more of a connection to a lover.  And finally, there's just that idea of wanting something so bad that you're worried that if you touch it, you'll break it, and it will be ruined.  Out of all of the stuff I write, those parts always make me cry when I write them. Everybody needs to be touched.  Speaking of touch, I have to go do a final proofread of some sex before I publish the next chapter. EDIT: I suppose that has to do with touch, too. My personal rationalization for why Cullen is writing down such filthy things is that it's very important to him that This Really Happened, that Evelyn let him touch her and he didn't just imagine it; it wasn't just a dream."
CullenMancers,31wwm4,Phaydre1,2,Sat Apr 11 17:28:18 2015 UTC,"Oh livejournal. I kind of really miss it. And the kmemes. I know they're still around but it's so much easier to find stuff on ao3. I mostly lurk on tumblr for fandom stuff and sad headcanons. Let me know if you decide to set one up!  Speaking of sad headcanons, I'm just going to be over here crying about Cullen. Yes yes yes to everything you wrote. His loneliness, his isolation, and how forbidden and impersonal sex and touch has been for him.  He's been an interesting, tragic character to me since my circle mage warden play through. I'm happy bioware made him a love interest just so he can find some measure of peace and belonging. You've fleshed him out beautifully.   (Also yay to another sex scene before the end! Yaaasssss! )"

CullenMancers,31p7tp,gathayah,13,Tue Apr 7 01:52:53 2015 UTC,I tried this recently. As soon as he shot me down (because I can't not pick the flirt options!) I abandoned that playthrough and made another Trevelyan.  sigh  I'm so glad I got some of the other romances out of the way in my second (the Bull) and and third (the Wall) playthrough. Then I took a Cullen break then I made a male Trevelyan just for Dorian!  OH! You should get yourself some Dorian! He's wonderful! Plus flirting with Cullen as a man is really fun! He's very sweet about letting you down gently.
CullenMancers,31p7tp,xStephyG,7,Tue Apr 7 02:35:21 2015 UTC,"Dorian is one of my favorite characters in the entire series, I would love to experience his romance. I've just never particularly enjoyed playing male characters. I might change my mind one day, but for now I think he's just destined to be the reliable BFF of every Inquisitor I make."
CullenMancers,31p7tp,xStephyG,6,Tue Apr 7 02:40:21 2015 UTC,"I can only play as a male if he's gay. I might be a bisexual woman but I can't romance another woman as a man in games. My brain is really weird.  Playing as a man does take some getting used to but once you get over the ""I'm a dude. This is weird."" part it's just the same as playing as a lady.   And Dorian's romance is so sweet. And that mustache! me-ow"
CullenMancers,31p7tp,wingedmurasaki,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:55:40 2015 UTC,I usually do not play male characters either; Dorian is so awesome I had to try it anyway. I'm enjoying the character more than I thought I would but I'm still unlikely to do it again.

CullenMancers,31p7tp,QuantumLeek,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:36:57 2015 UTC,Yay come to the dwarf side! Bull is a fun romp. My only suggestion is don't choose i love you when the option comes up during a romance scene. the first choice is more romantic and the last choice is phenomenally hilarious.
CullenMancers,31oe6c,manhattanmartini,26,Mon Apr 6 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"I prefer a mage Trevelyan for Cullen, because Lavellan is for Solas."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,AlphaLimaMike,6,Mon Apr 6 22:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd assumed most people would. I myself ship Trevelyan/Solas with a passion, because apparently I just can't help inflicting this sort of pain on my person."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,Blimington,2,Mon Apr 6 22:38:54 2015 UTC,Same!
CullenMancers,31oe6c,xStephyG,7,Mon Apr 6 22:51:52 2015 UTC,This.  EDIT: Also the elves look like prepubescent girls to me so I never play as an elf. =/
CullenMancers,31oe6c,AlphaLimaMike,3,Mon Apr 6 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"My first PT, I played as a rogue archer Trevelyan who romanced Blackwall, but he was so damn boring I scrapped it and played as a mage Lavellan so I could romance Solas.  That egg broke my heart, so I had to start a new PT and romance Cullen with a mage Trevelyan.  Both romances are awesome for different reasons, and I actually really enjoyed playing as an elf. It was just so fun to see this teensy little wisp of a mage annihilating everything in front of her."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,xStephyG,0,Tue Apr 7 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I think the elves are adorable but it's the same way I think my six year old cousin is adorable.  It's a personal preference thing. When I play a game with romance options I prefer the woman I'm playing as to look like well, a woman. Not to say slimmer women look like little girls. But the overly slim hips and small breasts on the elves reminds me too much of me when I was twelve and it's just too weird.   I just want to ask Lavellan if she wants to play Barbies with me. I might be 24 years old physically but I'll always be the 12 year old girl Lavellan reminds me of at heart and 12 year old me loves Barbie!  But I would never tell anyone to not play as an elf or any other race for that matter. I just can't play as an elf, personally so I fall on the Trevelyan/Cullen side of this discussion but I'm not going to say anyones headcanon is wrong. We each get to create our own stories here. That's the beauty of BW games!"
CullenMancers,31oe6c,Bubblystia,-1,Tue Apr 7 01:16:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, i tried to play as an elf the second time round but i couldnt make her face anywhere near as beautiful as my human, and when i saw that she looked well like a stick insect i was like NO. Even slim girls like me don't look that waifish, it was just distracting. And Cullen is a big dude, it would be kind of creepy him going after these prepubescent looking young elves. I am on the Trevelyan side, especially mage, because that keeps it very interesting."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,xStephyG,2,Wed Apr 8 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Cullen hanging outside the local middle school waiting for his thirteen year old girlfriend to finish. She's really mature, he swears. But her curfew makes their love hard. Also he has to keep reminding her not to tell her parents. Shudders I've just creeped myself out.  And yes, mage Trevelyan the best way to go. Played as rogue my first playthrough - it's kind of a tradition for me, my first class ever in DAO was rogue, so I did rogue first in DA2 and had to keep it going to DAI - while the romance was sweet it's so much more interesting as a mage. All the added lines and tension is just grand!"
CullenMancers,31oe6c,Bubblystia,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:28:40 2015 UTC,"IKR Cullen is a man, like a really manly man. All tall and muscly, not to mention ultra mature. Him with a little girl? Nononononono The mage arc also makes it awesome for fan fiction, because not only once a templar always a templar, but it has only been a year since Kirkwall, and when he said mages weren't people, I don't think he would have lost that bigotry IMMEDIATELY. Not saying he doesnt want to shake it, but old habits die hard. So that produces some excellent angst."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,xStephyG,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad I'm not the only person who sees the weirdness of Cullen being with Lavellan. Logically, I know Lavellan is an adult but I just can't shake off the fact that she looks like a little girl and it's just creepy.  As for FFs... I'm more of PWP person, myself. I'm all about the juicy bits. :P"

CullenMancers,31oe6c,theRadioStarr,17,Thu Apr 9 11:53:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of Cullavellan. There's something so lovely about them coming together on a couple of levels, especially if she's a mage: there's the mage/Templar, and the Dalish/shemlen. Plus I'm a sucker for the whole 'tiny girlfriend has a big bulky boyfriend to protect her even though she could probably destroy him in a fight' thing.   I know, as /u/AlphaLimaMike mentioned, that many consider Lavellan to be for Solas, but I had no interest in Solas until I already beat the game once, so Lavellan will always be for Cullen in my eyes."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,thinkpink913,7,Mon Apr 6 22:39:02 2015 UTC,Your comment. Everything about it. Just yes.
CullenMancers,31oe6c,theRadioStarr,5,Tue Apr 7 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"You get me on so many levels!   By the time I got around to romancing Solas, I'd already gotten it into my head that Lavellan/Cullen was part of my canon - and there's something about the teacher/student vibes that doesn't sit right with me, IDK. (fondles chin)"
CullenMancers,31oe6c,MieuFX,5,Mon Apr 6 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"YES. If I can be totally shameless for a moment, I'd like to (also) direct you to my very long Cullavellan fic, for your reading pleasure. All these dynamics are there!"
CullenMancers,31oe6c,theRadioStarr,2,Mon Apr 6 22:52:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome, been looking for something like this. Ao3 seems to prefer Cullen/Trevelyan."

CullenMancers,31oe6c,Crystallyne27,13,Tue Apr 7 16:09:10 2015 UTC,"I lean towards Cullen/Lavellan, myself.  But I have a thing for elves in general.  :3  I also haven't done a play through with Trevelyan yet, but I have started one.  I've got an ongoing fanfic right now with a Mage Lavellan.  I've changed things up for her story, setting it up so that she and Cullen actually knew each other as children, and she was in the Mage Circle during the events of DA:O.  (One of her grandparents was Dalish, but she was raised in a farming community alongside Cullen's family.)  They later reunite for DA:I, so they have an established relationship already.  heheh  My Trevelyan playthrough will be mostly for research to see what differences there are between the two romances.  heheh  (If you care to read my fanfic, here is a link...  Be warned it is Explicit for a reason.  heh  http://archiveofourown.org/works/3589317/chapters/7915788)"
CullenMancers,31oe6c,Sophiieesticated,3,Mon Apr 6 22:08:42 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen on Youtube, there aren't many differences in the romances apart from like two dialogue choices, which is a little disappointing IMO, since Cullen's romance is race-specific. They could've at least made them more divergent!  And yeah, I know what you mean - elves are usually my top pick, too (though playing with an Adaar Inquisitor has made me reconsider this stance)."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,Crystallyne27,2,Mon Apr 6 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would have been nice.  There are other reasons for me to do a play through with a Circle Mage besides the Cullen romance.  I want to see how other characters react differently, as well.  And as I'm playing I'm also thinking a lot about my story and looking for little things to add to it, to make it more interesting.  Things I might not think of just sitting here actively writing.  heheh"
CullenMancers,31oe6c,mechaangela,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:02:12 2015 UTC,Ooo! I love your fic! I'm subscribed to it and I get all excited whenever you update :)
CullenMancers,31oe6c,KindOwl,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"Why thank you!!  :D  I'm working on Chapter 8 now, which I'm starting to think I should divide into two chapters.  But it deals with the events of Broken Circle, so I figure it all belongs in the same chapter.  heh  It's gonna be a BIG ONE!!  And poor poor Cullen...  It's been tough writing his torture.  T_T  I just hope I do it justice..."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,MaryPopNLockins,6,Wed Apr 8 00:24:26 2015 UTC,"My first playthrough, I did not want to be a human, much less a human noble. I was forced to be one with Hawke, and I was irritated about that. (I went Qunari first, in fact.) But then I went Mage Lavellan with the intent of a Solasmance. Flirted with Cullen. There went that plan. They do look adorable together. So for my Hard playthrough, I decided to do mirror universe choices and Solasmance, made another Mage Lavellan. So hard to resist Cully-Wully, but I did it. I also started to binge on DA novels and was refreshed on the whole Circle Mage experience. I played a mage in Origins, although not for my canon playthrough because King Alistair. I started thinking about Origins Cullen and got curious about Trevelyan after all. Now I'm doing my Nightmare run, which I aim to be my canon playthrough, with Cullen/Mage Trevelyan. Many have commented on the angst. Yesss. [tents fingers] To me, Cullen's renunciation of his Templar life is just a little bit more loaded, especially when you consider Trevelyan very well could have been under his power back when he was very harsh toward mages, and you know they will both be mindful of that. So not only does it mean a teeny bit more for him to have this relationship with a circle mage rather than an elf mage, but I think it makes Trevelyan's acceptance of his past a little more powerful, too. Lavellan's difference is an interesting dynamic, but I just prefer the narrative symmetry with Cullen/Trevelyan, especially if you're going for a Leliana or a Cassandra Divine outcome.  Although really, playing through a romance with Cullen...I mean...if there were Dwarf, Qunari, boy options...I would find a reason for those, too, I suspect."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,Crystallyne27,9,Tue Apr 7 04:29:10 2015 UTC,"I personally liked Cullen/mage Trevelyan, because I am a complete sucker for the circle mage/templar forbidden romance dynamic. I just love the idea of both parties being wary of the other based on their past experiences in the Circles, but with time, discovering that they actually have more in common than not.   Since they've both spent most of their lives in the circle, I imagine that they both feel a bit displaced and have a hard time relating to the others who grew up in the outside world. I like to think that mage Trevelyan has a hard time adjusting because the culture and customs inside the circle are totally weird to outsiders. So the ex-templar, the last person she ever thought of befriending, let alone fall in love with,  is the only one who gets her. Like they remind each other of home, however fucked up it was.  I was also completely obsessed with Cullen/Amell fanfiction prior to Inquisition's release, so of course I had to play out that fantasy with Trevelyan/Cullen in my first playthrough. My second playthrough with Lavellan/Solas cemented that preference, because Lavellan belonged to Solas.   Now that I'm planning my 7th playthrough though, I think I've finally gotten over the angst from Solasmance enough to do a Lavellan/Cullen playthrough. I think it'll be interesting to explore how two people from entirely different cultures relate to each other and fall in love. I haven't done much reading on the pair, so I have no headcanon for it."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,ceranna,5,Tue Apr 7 03:37:00 2015 UTC,"I got so angry with the Solas romance that everytime I roll a Lavellan I get to the part where Solas and Lavellan have their first kiss and then break it off with him, where I go and promptly make out with Cullen. Of course I had been flirting with Cullen the whole time, I just wanted to break Solas' nonexistent heart."
CullenMancers,31oe6c,ifeelwitty,2,Tue Apr 7 21:56:00 2015 UTC,HAHAHAHA!!!  This made me laugh so hard!  XD
CullenMancers,31oe6c,gathayah,6,Wed Apr 8 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"I'm more of a fan of TrevelynxCullen, probably because Im heavily influenced by The Soul has Bandaged Moments.  Although I'm doing a run through with a Dalish rogue that bounces back and forth between Solas and Cullen, so we shall see if it changes my mind.    But my own personal headcanon = AmellxCullen forever!"

CullenMancers,31oe6c,osc630,2,Tue Apr 7 01:58:22 2015 UTC,"I prefer Trevelyan ever so slightly because I think it's easier from a roleplaying standpoint to make it fit. The Dalish interact with humans only if absolutely necessary and some of them are completely distrustful of humans their entire lives. Voluntarily entering into a a relationship with a human could be seen as taboo or even completely unforgivable, depending on the clan (that's just speculation on my part, but I think it's pretty logical). I was only able to make my Lavellan's romance with Cullen make sense after I accidentally killed off her tribe at the War Table (oops...) and inadvertently made her clan's approval/disapproval a nonissue. The Travelyan romance doesn't have this cultural disconnect, which I think makes it easier."

CullenMancers,314siu,MieuFX,4,Thu Apr 2 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"Red Lyrium Cullen is my kryptonite. If the events of Inquisition happened less than 5 years earlier, he so would be."
CullenMancers,314siu,VintageLydia,9,Thu Apr 2 02:40:07 2015 UTC,"Not only would he have been a Red Templar but you know he'd have been General Cullen, Leader of the Red Templars. And the Inquisition would have been completely effed!"
CullenMancers,314siu,ifeelwitty,5,Thu Apr 2 02:43:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. Imagine if instead of fighting Carroll -- a Templar from DA:O who had a small part -- we had to fight the other Templar whose name starts with ""C"" and also had a minor part."

Most of this isn't seen during the actual cut scenes so they could just clipped everything (like in the chess scene with Dorian) and no one would've been upset. But no. Bioware knows its fangirls.

CullenMancers,315n5l,ZiggyStarstuff,7,Thu Apr 2 04:23:47 2015 UTC,"I shall make a list of ones that are near and dear to my heart.   1.Calling On Song Inquisitor Travelyan is a tavern singer/rogue/bodyguard before becoming Inquisitor and finding our favourite ex-templar. The characters are very well written and it is very heartfelt. WIP 2.The Templar Mage Trevelyan doesn't know what to think of Cullen, being used to cruel Templars. He proves how nice they can be. Complete 3.Tearing Down the Heavens This one is a particular favourite of mine. It is part of a series called What is it with Red-Headed Rogues, Anyway? which also has a Cousland/Alistair story and a Anders/Hawke story. The latest story ark has been particularilly delicious. The writting is very, very good. WIP 4.The Tranquility of Faith This one has an interesting spin, where the Inquisitor is the mage that Cullen loved in the tower but instead of becoming a Warden, she was made tranquil. WIP 5.As the Crow Flies Cullen doesn't know what to make of the Antivan Crow that is Inquisitor. WIP 6.[Past the Shades where Blind Men Grope] Cullen's past suddenly becomes his future when Amell becomes Inquisitor. WIP 7.As the World Falls Down A favourite of the Cullenmancer community, both Trevelyan and Cullen decide to let their hair down at a Masquerade ball, completely in disguise. WIP 8.The Soul Has Bandaged Moments A series written entirely in letters. Mage Trevelyan is studious and a researcher through and through, and she turns her quick mind, and heart to Cullen. WIP (On it's last chapters) 9.Her Lion A collection of Lavellan/Cullen one shots (all the same inquisitor). They vary from fluffy and funny to serious and angsty. WIP   If you need more, I will delve further into my list!"
CullenMancers,315n5l,xeferial,2,Thu Apr 2 08:44:51 2015 UTC,I second #8. Just finished spending every waking moment of the past 2 days reading it or thinking about reading it. I probably dreamt about it too for all I know. Loved it.

CullenMancers,306n6p,a_little_red,2,Wed Mar 25 03:57:09 2015 UTC,Truly great. I haven't seen a lot of fic that uses an Inquisitor who fell for Blackwall and then started seeing Cullen. It definitely scratches an itch. :)  You have a good command over the English language. If you don't write professionally I hope you at least keep up the hobby.
CullenMancers,306n6p,Graendal,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:51:25 2015 UTC,"My first inquisitor fell for Blackwall and then broke it off the first time he came to her quarters, then started seeing Cullen. I kind of wish I'd kept it up with Blackwall until his personal quest was over just to see the drama and then switched, but I didn't know the spoilers at the time and just felt like there was more chemistry with Cullen. So this fic should be an interesting read!"
CullenMancers,306n6p,a_little_red,2,Sat Mar 28 03:23:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the sweetness, guys! Just to let you know, I posted some more just now! I posted it all pretty much as I wrote it the first time around, and had a lot of things in later days that I wish I'd done differently. I'm adding scenes, changing when some things happened, etc, so that accounts for the staccato posting even though the story is finished. Hopefully there won't be more than a day or two between each post until it's up."

So, basically someone who makes him laugh, is more outgoing/gregarious, and pushes him to stop frigging working all the damn time.  At the same time,  the woman would have to have a keen sense of duty and compassion to the point where Cullen would be like ""no sweetheart, you can't save every man, woman, child, and mabari in thedas.  It's impossible"" because he's super pragmatic.    Plus in the game he always seems to react positively when you choose humor.  And despite he's stammering,  he totally likes it when you tease him."

CullenMancers,30014l,Jirni,3,Sat Mar 28 07:55:47 2015 UTC,"Cullen strikes me as an INFJ (though I've seen others say he's ISFJ), and with that in mind, one of his best match ups would be with an ENFP. They tend to naturally gravitate to each other. So a lot of what /u/ceranna said would fit right into that. ENFP tend to be passionate and love... well... everything.

I happen to be an ENFP and yes i love everything and everyone, it's probably the reason i gravitate to him. Yaas this post is awesome!  As an ENFP, i love having introvert friends to bring them out a little bit, i think Cullen needs that. What are you?"
CullenMancers,30014l,princessDB,3,Tue Mar 24 02:20:43 2015 UTC,"I'm also a ENFP! (If you haven't checked it out, /r/enfp is a place and we will throw a huge party with balloons, and kittens and.... wait... was that a butterfly? You totally saw that right?)   A lot of Cullen resonates INFJ to me. His battles with his imperfections and wanting to be a better person. His very caring and gentle but fiercely protective nature. The way he's closed himself off on a personal level except to the people that he truly wants inside. And lastly, the way that he just seems to know in his heart what and who other people are and does what he can to support the good things he finds."

I didn't want to give over-much away in the thread post, but it's fun to hear someone looking for that regime of fic. I'll warn you, it's a long story, and the entire first novel builds up to the birth of his children (twins!) - it doesn't happen until literally the last chapter. They are central points of the sequel, as five year olds, which is when you'll see the best character development with him as a father. I agree with you. He'd make a great daddy! Since you're into this, I'd love to have ideas and thoughts! Ty!"

CullenMancers,2zym62,sophe_s,3,Mon Mar 23 02:04:54 2015 UTC,I don't mind a little angst because not all families are full of sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes though angst gets a little too much.

I came across this fic, Noli Me Tangere, with a very, very individualized Trevelyan.  It's incredibly long and well thought out, building on the relationship between former-templar Cullen and this mage Mirèio, and we haven't even gotten to mpreg yet!      Like, if mpreg isn't your thing, read at least what's there, and you're very likely to find yourself hooked anyway.  I know I am.  I can't wait to see what delicious things Mirèio can divulge from the commander."

CullenMancers,2zta8e,thesmonster,25,Sun Mar 22 06:42:46 2015 UTC,"I thought it was odd because you have to change into armour anyway, so why not have a dress to begin with? I was thinking, long red silk the colour of dark Antivian wine, but daringly backless with the Inquisitor logo in fine gold lace across the back. THAT is how you bring the Inquisition to the ball. How would your dresses look?"
CullenMancers,2zta8e,Bubblystia,8,Sat Mar 21 18:51:01 2015 UTC,I'd drop by your seamstress because that dress sounds wonderful.

CullenMancers,2zta8e,ilyahna,14,Wed Mar 25 04:22:23 2015 UTC,I would like a pretty dress dlc. please?  I feel like the Inquisitor of all people should be wearing something...not ugly and dull. Instead she's wearing exactly what everyone else is wearing! It feels wrong to end the ball with 100 approval.
CullenMancers,2zta8e,Gloomier,13,Sat Mar 21 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"I mean, it looks weird to be wearing the same thing as your advisers and friends, right? I'm pretty sure my Inquisitor could still kick ass in a ball gown and be done in time to blush for Cullen."
CullenMancers,2zta8e,ifeelwitty,13,Sat Mar 21 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it would have been awesome to see personalised outfits for the friends etc. Cullen i get and he looks lovely, but Josephine and Leliana are way more girly than stiff coats! Maybe it's because I'm ultra feminine and i also wanted more feminine armour. Incorrigible!"

CullenMancers,2zta8e,ilyahna,9,Wed Mar 25 04:22:47 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I'm going to a ball, of all places, and I'm the inquisitor, so why shouldn't I get a fancy dress?  I find it odd that Josephine, Leliana, and Vivienne would let me go out in something so tacky."
CullenMancers,2zta8e,Selitae,14,Sat Mar 21 21:36:20 2015 UTC,I find it odd that THEY would let themselves go to the ball dressed in such manner.
CullenMancers,2zta8e,commander_pup,9,Sun Mar 22 00:18:08 2015 UTC,"I was thinking something more like this: Imgur  Also, red clashed horribly with my Inquisitor's hair. As a fellow redhead, Leliana should have put her foot down."
CullenMancers,2zta8e,itsallsamantics,8,Sun Mar 22 15:57:51 2015 UTC,"I think I may be one of the only people who didn't mind it.  I mean, a lovely gown would have been fantastic. Maybe a scene with Josephine where she shows you a few different options and you can choose one.   But changing into my armour from the military formal dress would be hella easier than from a complicated Victorian-style Orlesian ball gown, even though to the player it would be effortless. I guess it just made sense to me.   Not sure if the whole 'three nights of a ball' thing is canon (I've always believed it, but can't remember where I would have learned it other than fics; just tried to do some research and can't find anything specifically about Orlesian salons) but I imagine that after the whole 'Save the Empress' thing is over, we get to enjoy the next two nights of celebrating where we wear whatever we damned-well please, but because it's not important to the plot, we don't see it."
CullenMancers,2zta8e,theRadioStarr,3,Sun Mar 22 16:47:55 2015 UTC,"Thank the Maker I'm not the only one!  I can't imagine changing in and out of a corset (even with a busk) AND petticoats every time I had to stealthily search the palace.  I'd lose court approval if I returned improperly laced or with my skirts askew.  Maker knows what court approval would be if I showed up (gasp!) without a corset at all.  I do think her formal attire should have been slightly different to her advisors, enough to demonstrate a distinction, but not too much to indicate a significant gap in rank.  Having them all in similar outfits speaks to a solidarity within the Inquisition inner circle, an idea of equality akin to the knights of the round table.  Still, adding a little gold braiding to the Inquisitor wouldn't have been too much to ask.  Also, while the red jacket with the blue sash is striking (certainly no one else at the ball was wearing such bold colours), it wasn't my favourite combination.  After working some armour-tinting magic in the undercroft, my personal favourite is Samite for the jacket and Highever Weave for the sash.  As for the ""three nights of a ball"", the only place I've heard of that is in fairy tales, but if the Inquisitor is to be considered fashionable by Orlesian standards in order to maintain a high court approval, it just might take that long for her to change in and out of her clothes.  Perhaps wearing a metal corset, which just snaps closed, would facilitate ease of dress; something like Cersei in Game of Thrones wears here:   http://i854.photobucket.com/albums/ab104/stephanieplusverb/tumblr_m6646i7J3S1rqjbleo1_1280_zps0f54dfd3.png  Certainly not functional armour and I can't imagine it being comfortable, but pretty in a militaristic way, no?"
CullenMancers,2zta8e,RoraMitchell,5,Mon Mar 23 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"My Winter Palace glitched for the final scene and for some reason I was wearing my Skyhold outfit. Happily, it was modded, and I was rather pleased with the result."
CullenMancers,2zta8e,permanentthrowaway,4,Mon Mar 23 01:14:35 2015 UTC,"There are some mods that make the colours a bit nicer - like white and blue or black and red. I understand the charm behind wearing a dress to the ball, but in canon, the Inquisition is a military organization, and they put a LOT of effort into presenting themselves as a legitimate faction that people need to take seriously. That's why they all wear matching uniforms, to represent the unity and dedication to their own cause. That however doesn't mean I wouldn't love to see my lady inquisitor in a nice ball gown.  I've been working on a (rather long) cullenxtrevelyan fic, and I really wanted a scene with a dress as well - except I didn't like the idea of making her go to the ball wearing one as it would go against the above reasoning. Instead, I'll be writing a little fluff bit where Josie brings a bunch of dresses (that were gifted via many Orlesian noble allies) up to the Inquisitor's quarters so they can try them on for fun. I'm hoping somehow they get called down to the war table or something for an urgent update, and don't have time to change so Josie, the Inquisitor and Leliana are all standing in front of Cullen with fancy ballgowns on for funny/cute reactions."

I can understand if you don't want the commitment if you're only going to buy one tea, but trust me, once you've tried actual good loose leaf tea compared to the dust in teabags there is no going back. I've ordered over 25 of Cara's (the girl who designed the Cullen tea) teas and, trust me, the Cullen blend is one of her best."

CullenMancers,2zj6yp,LordFrith,2,Thu Mar 19 02:11:15 2015 UTC,"Scroll down. Took me a minute to find it, too."
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,theRadioStarr,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:37:34 2015 UTC,Sorry about that. I should've linked directly. I also didn't realize it took you to the top of the page if you weren't logged in. Maybe this link will be slightly better. (Still might have to scroll down a bit.)  Bold In Deed
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,LordFrith,2,Fri Mar 20 02:03:19 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile and can't link, but eternalshiva on AO3 has some good stuff. Her 'Chants and Mirrors' was linked here a short while ago, I'd recommend that as a very good place to start."
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,theRadioStarr,2,Fri Mar 20 02:39:41 2015 UTC,"Yup...already read that one.  Other than the switching between past and present tense, it was awesome."
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,LordFrith,2,Thu Mar 19 00:51:15 2015 UTC,"Read the others, she has an entire series of one-shots. Most are not smut but a few are and they're also good."
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,theRadioStarr,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:04:08 2015 UTC,Pfffft. I think you should have plugged your own fic. I love it!
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,thesmonster,3,Thu Mar 19 01:12:08 2015 UTC,"AHHH I'm freaking out a little, thank you! I would love to but OP wanted less story, more... uh... Science."
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,worldlyshuku,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, right. My reading comprehension lately has been... So-so.   Anyway, hope you're going to update soon!"
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,worldlyshuku,2,Thu Mar 19 01:51:00 2015 UTC,Chapter is in the works! Last night's celebrations have kind of dragged out the writing but I'm trying to have it done before I go to bed.
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,lionesspride,1 point,Thu Mar 19 03:00:40 2015 UTC,Yessssssssss.
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,worldlyshuku,3,Thu Mar 19 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"If you're still up, I just posted it!"
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,lionesspride,1 point,Thu Mar 19 03:13:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, thank you! I'm so happy! Yet another great chapter."
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,worldlyshuku,1 point,Thu Mar 19 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"Hey, I like story, too.  Story and smut.  Link away!"
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,lionesspride,3,Thu Mar 19 05:25:50 2015 UTC,"Mine is called Capitolina Lupa.   Very little smut so far (once is a memory with an old lover, the other is a lonely private moment), but there's lots of the gushy starting to fall feels. I think, anyway.   Also it's turning out to be novel length. Hope you enjoy really long stories."
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,worldlyshuku,2,Thu Mar 19 14:46:30 2015 UTC,Chants and Mirrors
CullenMancers,2zj6yp,lionesspride,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:04:42 2015 UTC,That one's woooooonderful.

CullenMancers,2zegmc,lionesspride,4,Tue Mar 17 22:14:13 2015 UTC,"This has been one of my favorite Cullen fics for awhile now. It takes place in Kirkwall (DA2 era) and Cullen and f!Hawke are the main characters. This fic doesn’t get as much attention as it should, IMO, and I thought I’d share it with my fellow Cullenites.   There’s definitely a lot of smut and lots of dom!Cullen, if you enjoy that kind of thing. (I do!) But the story is also well written. It definitely has dark moments, so be warned.  Oh and if anyone else has other dom!Cullen fics they enjoy, please share! I’m always on the hunt."
CullenMancers,2zegmc,gathayah,3,Tue Mar 17 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I've got one! It's full of smut and completely NSFW, but it is...very steamy."
CullenMancers,2zegmc,sophe_s,3,Wed Mar 18 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thank you! Uh, I'll be in my bunk...."
CullenMancers,2zegmc,Dramatological,3,Wed Mar 18 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"I love this fic, especially because it's a great story that happens to have kinky sex (and aftercare) as opposed to just smut.  Definitely a great read."
CullenMancers,2zegmc,ceranna,3,Wed Mar 18 05:12:39 2015 UTC,"I'm writing one in which Cullen is very grrrar.  But it's also DA2 era, and f!Hawke is a mage, and Cullen is in character.  The pairing is meant to bridge the gap between kill-them-all-Cullen and I-really-regret-Cullen.  There's some fluff, and some adorableness, but the only really explicit scene (thus far) is kinda dark and disturbing.  So it's not really smut, either.  Not really sure it's what you're looking for, but it's here: http://archiveofourown.org/works/3440570/chapters/7542584"
CullenMancers,2zav16,redheadedalex,3,Tue Mar 17 01:23:49 2015 UTC,"That is a fab tattoo - such vibrant colours!  Also, the title of this stumped me for a bit. I imagined Cullen posing on an armored tank, like an entry for March on some kind of charity army calendar. 'Twas a diverting image :)"
CullenMancers,2zav16,AWeirdCrab,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:27:58 2015 UTC,How long did the delivery process take for you? I've been waiting a month and a half for my delivery from them.
CullenMancers,2zav16,xeferial,1 point,Tue Mar 17 07:03:20 2015 UTC,"Chiming in for the sake of comparison. Mine took about 2-3 weeks and I live in the Netherlands. Might be worth a call indeed.  OP: Sweeeet \o/ looks great, and it's so comfy!"
CullenMancers,2zav16,Eivene,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:26:38 2015 UTC,About two weeks. Where are you located?
CullenMancers,2zav16,xeferial,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:48:13 2015 UTC,"Toronto. My local post office has the shipping information, but not the actual product yet. I guess I'll try calling them."
CullenMancers,2zav16,theRadioStarr,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:04:44 2015 UTC,"I'm also from Toronto, and I had one shirt from a different site take 3 or 4 months. For some reason it sometimes gets held up elsewhere for a while. I had almost given up on it when it showed up in the mail.   Not sure where Bioware ships from, but if it had to go through somewhere other than the US and Canada, that may be what's taking it so long."
CullenMancers,2zav16,beezabubs,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"I'm from the Toronto area, and I also bought this shirt. It came in about two or three weeks for myself! Have you looked at the tracking number for it?   It might be held up in customs..."

CullenMancers,2zb02x,theRadioStarr,5,Tue Mar 17 02:05:28 2015 UTC,"Two Steps From Hell  I can't even begin to name the full extent of my playlist though, but Two Steps makes everything feel epic. Varien puts out a lot of stimulating music as well."
CullenMancers,2zb02x,Gloomier,2,Tue Mar 17 02:16:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, Maker.   So Cullen's writer actually had a few songs she listened to while writing him. Google The Sound and the Fury if you're curious (each writer comments on what music/songs inspired their writing, pretty cool stuff) and I really, really liked Falling Slowly  Other favourites are Little Hell by City and Colour and just yesterday I stumbled on Smother by Daughter, and Megladena by A Perfect Circle is pretty good.   Also anything by Tesseract, but especially Of Matter   There are more, but right now I can't think of 'em, haha."
CullenMancers,2zb02x,Shady_Intent,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"Depends on what I am writing.    Nina Simone and bluegrass or old school outlaw country for my fallout fic.  Bad Blood for my modern DA universe.  Recruitverse is usually my iPod on shuffle.  And lastly, my original work is whatever music that I am feeling.  Sometimes that's popular music, sometimes its obscure, and sometimes it's the playlist of random songs that move me (brother in arms, say something, three of us in a boat, sail, and Cecilia are just some examples from that playlist).  For me, music is an integral part of my writing.  Sometimes it acts as inspiration, sometimes it's motivation, and sometimes it's just ambient noise.  What is interesting, now that I think about it, is that some of my work is so clearly defined by the music I was listening to at the time."
CullenMancers,2zb02x,sophe_s,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:04:11 2015 UTC,"I had Muse, Time is Running Out going on repeat while writing F!Mage!Hawke/Cullen."
CullenMancers,2zb02x,Dramatological,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:58:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on the story and mood for me!  Sometimes I just need music that fades away from my ears while I slap words onto the page.  For my current Cullen fics, I listen to a lot of folk. Like. A LOT.  My playlist is over here"
CullenMancers,2zb02x,yesthatnagia,0,Sat Mar 21 05:14:47 2015 UTC,"I can neither write nor draw but when I play I listen to love songs. Sappy, sappy love songs. Or the games music depending on the situation."

CullenMancers,2z3bo7,perarduaetal,3,Sun Mar 15 04:54:39 2015 UTC,Short but sweet chapter :3 I love her and Sera's friendship so much.
CullenMancers,2z3bo7,cipher_six,2,Sun Mar 15 04:07:09 2015 UTC,Am I a dork because I was listening to this as I read this chapter?
CullenMancers,2z3bo7,KindOwl,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:34:36 2015 UTC,No judgement here. Can't be as dorky as shedding tears of happiness while reading the chapter and then crying again upon reading it again.
CullenMancers,2z3bo7,butterfly_beatrice,2,Mon Mar 16 20:52:03 2015 UTC,I've been having such a bad week and seeing this update last night made me so happy. :)
CullenMancers,2z11ej,ceranna,3,Sat Mar 14 16:01:59 2015 UTC,He kinda looks like a young Kurt Russell. That's not at all a bad thing.

CullenMancers,2z11ej,sophe_s,3,Tue Mar 17 08:06:53 2015 UTC,"Here's another  Plus I love the little exchange between Dorian, Cass and Cullen added on."
CullenMancers,2z11ej,xStephyG,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:16:00 2015 UTC,Love it!   I'd probably run around Skyhold making damn sure no scissors gets close to that head of hair XD

CullenMancers,2yx6io,icels,2,Fri Mar 13 17:32:01 2015 UTC,haha that was the best response. So true too!
CullenMancers,2yx6io,Angelavenger,7,Sat Mar 14 02:16:22 2015 UTC,"I have no problems at all going for a sub Cullen but if I had to choose, having a more assertive Cullen when it comes to physical excites me more.  All the more because he IS so sweet and gentile natured most of the time so maybe in my head it plays out more like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in a way.  To each their own tho! I have enjoyed reading plenty of sub Cullen and it works for sure :)"
CullenMancers,2yx6io,TechnicolorRabbit,3,Sat Mar 14 15:01:50 2015 UTC,"Mmm, he does have to be the biggest, baddest, scariest, untouchable motherfucker to be the Commander of the Inquisition's military... But is a really sweet guy when not being Scary Commander. I could see that. :)  Remember, Cullenmancers, most anytime he's not talking to the Inquisitor, he's confident, self-assured and... well... commanding.   That must get tiresome."
CullenMancers,2yx6io,perarduaetal,2,Sun Mar 15 02:28:23 2015 UTC,Never mind being head and shoulders taller than most other people...
CullenMancers,2yx6io,perarduaetal,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yup! I imagine he has the fierceness he displays when he's so rudely interrupted during the first kiss scene with the Inquisitor. ""... What."" death glare"

CullenMancers,2yx6io,bicyclecat,2,Sat Mar 14 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"I wish I were better about bookmarking fics on the meme since it's pretty hard to search and there's some good stuff over there. On AO3, there's Welcome Home, Women who Inspire, Sharpen Your Sword, and You Get What You Need (not positive I'm remembering that one correctly, but I think it has a more dominant Inquisitor).   In other pairings, there's Kings and Commanders (Alistair), The Price of War (Sebastian), Sating her Needs (Hawke).     I think there are a few more Inquisitor/Cullen ones I don't have marked but should be searchable by tag. This one is mine. (It's the only DAI fic I have completed and posted; I have so many drafts but I'm so bad about finishing things.)   /switching to a throwaway for linking porn"
CullenMancers,2yx6io,cipher_six,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's submissive. I think he's very egalitarian, maybe with a slight dominant edge. It's equal between them, give and take depending on their individual moods and circumstances. He's actually very assertive in the relationship once he knows where he stands (the sudden kiss on the battlements, the lifting the Inquisitor onto the desk for amazing desk smex), so I while can't really seem him always sitting back and allowing her to ""take the wheel,"" as it were, he wouldn't have a problem with her doing so once in a while, either."
CullenMancers,2yx6io,Bubblystia,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"This . Perfect description, he obviously respects women he is the only man in a leadership of them and he doesn't have a problem with taking orders from them haha. I mean am i the only one who thought it was awesome that its (potentially) 5 women and 1 man leading the inquisition at the War table, counting Morrigan later and Fem/Inq, and no one bats an eyelid. It made me feel empowered. He is also a brave and assertive ""Commander"", even the word is sexy! I can imagine he would be dominant in the bedroom and gentle in the relationship. He is practically husband material."

CullenMancers,2yozzv,theRadioStarr,5,Wed Mar 11 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe if you put up your questions we could better help you?  Really it boils down to everything is done anonymously and there is always a main prompt post where users can post new prompts. At some point, this post will be closed for new prompts and a new main prompt post will be started. You'll see these on the main page as Part XVII, Part XVIII, etc and they'll always be labeled as ""open for prompts, open for fills"" or ""closed for prompts, open for fills."" Mods will post on the thread when the thread is closed, something to the effect of ""no new posts/go to Part XXX here"" as the final comment. Sometimes overflow threads are created; I'm not as clear on how those work.  You can post fills on any thread at any time. Just be respectful of the prompt/requester and ask any questions you may have of the prompt author before filling. LJ users can track their prompts within their LJ inbox so you should get a response from them. Non LJ users have to do it manually. When you post a fill, ensure you are replying to the prompt post and not just posting it to the general thread, otherwise it'll get lost.   If you're looking for specific types of prompts (ex pairings, kink, etc), they're all tagged and archived. I forget the site they moved the archive to, but the link is on the Kmeme site.  I haven't done any fills in a long time but I did them for the same reasons you did - to improve my writing. The Kmeme was pretty good for that and as long as you're respectful it's really fun. Good luck!"

Getting to actually (finally!) romance him was amazing. Unfortunately, I had to reevaluate all of my post-Origin head-canon. Now I have my head canon based off of the story from Origins to Inquisition, as well as an AU head canon that has Cullen and my mage Warden getting together after Origins."

The Solas romance made me so angry and then it gets locked in and you can't go looking for love anywhere else. I was so mad, my next play throughI played  a dwarf who romanced the Iron Bull for a little humorous fun.   I romance Dorian first... I like playing dudes, even though I'm female because... reasons that have to do with a time back when I played MMOs, and a social experiment.   But, I digress. The mod was fun to play with, but it is super short. Cullen doesn't run away from you though, so that's good...  As far as DA:I goes, Cullen is by far the best... I'd slot Dorian second... I've never done Cassandra's eww. I was disappointed in Josephine's. I kind of wish I could do Cole (future DLC or game maybe?) It took Bioware years to give us Cullen after all... it could happen."
