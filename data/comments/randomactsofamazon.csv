randomactsofamazon,3e2sd8,SwissMidget,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:44 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who loved finding the original, military grade paracord bracelets that would hold 50 lbs.. or maybe 250 lbs? And he thought it was great when he could buy such a great product for a reasonable price. Then he realized that there are now a TON of cheapo ones out there that might hold 8 lbs or so maximum and he is really ticked off that paracord bracelets have become a fad type thing...   That's really all I know about paracord bracelets... I have no opinion of them myself though.. couldn't care less."
randomactsofamazon,3e2sd8,axclover,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:01 2015 UTC,I use commercial 550 paracord in all my bracelets. It has a breaking strength of (go figure) 550 lbs. Since its commercial you aren't technically supposed to use it for like rock climbing or as actual parachute cord. For some stuff you could probably still get away with it.  Â   However I can get mil-spec for a bit more and make a bracelet that can be used in climbing. I can also make a few necklaces or I can wind hundreds of feet into a donut shape that is easy deploy as much as you need. I can do quite a bit of stuff with the paracord and I enjoy it really. Selling it is just a bonus and the income is nice.
randomactsofamazon,3e2sd8,RedemptionX11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:08 2015 UTC,I like them. I made a matching bracelet and collar for my dog a while back. I'm not sure how much I'd pay since I like to make them myself. Maybe $10-15?
randomactsofamazon,3e2sd8,LolaBunBun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:33 2015 UTC,Putting the same thing on your comment as another commenter. I am way under charging apparently. I was setting my price point at around $3.00 for a two strand (colors don't matter) 7 inch bracelet. I'm still making a ton of profit at that price. Its scary the markup on them.
randomactsofamazon,3e2sd8,LolaBunBun,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:08 2015 UTC,u/NGWoosh has made me several and I've been thrilled. I'd pay $10-$20 each depending on difficulty and added charms

randomactsofamazon,3e2sd8,LolaBunBun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:15 2015 UTC,I pay more for handmade items because I suck at crafts for the most part and I understand how hard it is for start ups to get off the ground.   If it were paracord bracelets from the store I'd pay no more than $5

randomactsofamazon,3e2sd8,goonie21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"I used to make them all the time, each bracelet uses about 10ft of cord. And I can buy 100ft for $6 so I usually sell single color for $4 and 2 color for $6. It doesn't take longer than 10 minutes to make one and pretty much only costs $.65 cents to make in materials. I think making $20-$30 an hour isn't too bad.  I make them a little different than most everyone else. I do them to they're easy to take apart (about 15 seconds or so) if you need to use the cord for an emergency."

After spending some time with a completely broken foot, you learn just how lucky you are to be able to walk. I also never realized just how much you depend on/take for granted the ability to walk/stand up, etc. Heck, even when my foot was broken I thought.. well at least I can move the rest of my body.. there are so many more people that can't move their legs/arms/something... So even when I had a broken foot it was just temporary and wasn't as bad as it could have been.  I am also very thankful for my family and their health. Any of us could have it worse off.. Finally, I'd say I'm very thankful for living in my home where I am. I know a young girl whose family lives in a single bedroom apartment with the following arrangements: the seven members of her family in the 1 bedroom, 2 men on the couch in the living room, and 1 man in a closet... THERE IS A MAN WHO LIVES IN A CLOSET... and no this is not a euphemism for being gay... It is so sad... but she is still happy and hopeful! So, yeah. I am very thankful for having my own bedroom. And I'm thankful that she can still keep a smile on her face. I'm thankful for living in a house. I am thankful for a lot. I am very thankful for where I live and the fact that I was able to grow up in this environment.. it is one of the richest counties in America(which is why the schools are very good, and we also have TONS of immigrants... which is great because we have more diversity and get to learn about people like the little girl whom we can help), and America is one of the most well off places in the world.. so.. a lot of times I feel like.. hmmm, geographically, I'm probably in the 1%(this county) of the 1%(USA). I'm also thankful for the freedom of thought and speech we have in this country... yeah I sense people spouting off propaganda-induced ideas sometimes.. but it is much better than the complete brainwashing I have witnessed from other countries... (the other day I received a VERY homophobic postcard from a postcrossing user in Russia..) So yea, I'm thankful I don't live under Vladimir Putin... Also! These will be my last 2 points, I promise, because I feel very strongly about it! I am thankful I do not live under the Kim regime, and I'm thankful for having a toilet and indoor plumbing... there are 1 billion people without access to toilets, and the economic and health effects that causes on them are horrible :[  TOILETS FOR THE WORLD!!!

I'm thankful for my amazing husband of 15 years. He makes me a better person and supports me no matter what. Next week will be 20 years since we started dating and I love him more all the time.   I'm thankful that even though I was laid off last year I was in a place to be able to wait for the right job and not just take something out of desperation. Even when the job I was offered last September kept getting pushed back I was able to pay rent. Now I have 2 part time jobs I love and a temp gig that allows me a lot of flexibility and enough money to pay bills.

Even with all the problems in this country, I am grateful to not live in place with less freedom or more poverty, like Saudi Arabia.  I know some good people including nice Redditors.

I recently was told by the school I had to go to a scholarship dinner where I would meet the man that gave me a huge scholarship. I am thankful for the people that pay out of pocket to help struggling families send their children to college. Personally, without the man I met I would probably be unable to go to the school I am at. Other college kids - its not something we normally think about, but please do appreciate those paying out of pocket so that you can get an education. I am truly humbled by this man's generosity and will be forever thankful for it."

Sweet potato + pineapple/peaches with cinnamon, and/or summer squash + onion. Chicken quesadillas wrapped in tin foil, or hobo pockets: commonly made with beef/potatoes/carrots all wrapped up in foil, but for a not-as-hobo pocket, maybe a pork chop with sliced apples and brown sugar. Portobello caps with balsamic vinegar? Maybe stuff the mushrooms with quinoa and tomatoes if you have a bowl to nuke the quinoa in. The best thing I've ever had grilled was a sting ray, but that's probably harder to come by in Wyoming.  *for not wanting to leave spices behind, the grocery store I go to has single serving pouches by Badia in the Latino section.

randomactsofamazon,3e13fy,HagerEKU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:13 2015 UTC,"Don't flatten it out like they tell you, leave it big and plump. Best way is a thermometer at first - get it to 150 degrees and then take it off, cover in foil for about 15 minutes to rest. After you do it a few times you can tell by feel. Other than that I don't know... you can calculate the exact time if you know exactly how your grill heats but that probably isn't the case in a hotel. You can find cheap meat thermometers at dollar stores sometimes, it'll be enough to do the trick. I typically cook a chicken breast 4 minutes, rotate 90 degrees for grill marks, then flip after 4, repeat process. That tends to get it to 150, but that's on my grill."

No one I know enjoys parties.. its more a casual 2-3 people get together and eat outside or make the persons favorite meal.  Edit: I also wanted to add you aren't alone in planning. A great idea would to be look up the main interest your kid is displaying or even ask what they want. Take said want and look for it in YouTube or Pinterest with ""birthday"" as the second word.

Due to time it takes and cost we hadn't gone into Dublin until today.  Apparently we really should have stayed in Dublin since getting in to town is sort of a pain but the price difference seemed worth it at the time we booked.  Lesson learned. On the plus side it's a cute little house and we can do laundry. and chill and it's much less than if we had stayed in Dublin.  Today we did bus into town to go to Trinity College Dublin.  We took the tour and saw the old library, which is amazing and the book of Kells, which is a huge deal for hubby!  The library was fantastic although we were sad you can't actually see the books.    After this drink we're planning on finding the pub/pub crawl area and getting silly!  Hope everyone has a good week and a good Monday!  Love Ya <3<3 MrsSquishy"

It doesn't really feel like anything. The initial sucrose only injection is a little cold. But I don't feel the infusion going in at all.

Today was the last day of Ottawa Blues Fest so I'm kinda bummed. I'm here for one more day then back to Watertown (where some things are going to be put into motion whether I want them to or not) for a while.   The entire festival was absolutely amazing and I wish it was a year round thing. Today was incredible with so many bands and everyone coming together enjoying the last day. The weather stayed nice for the entire festival (only one rain sprinkle briefly on one of the days), I survived relatively well (besides passing out one day it was super hot but we won't talk about that).   I just cannot say enough amazing things about it."

randomactsofamazon,3dw3uj,joelthezombie15,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:46:56 2015 UTC,Nope. None of the stuff I wanted / needed (or similar items) were on a sale and I had a whole kindle debacle as well (it's somewhere in my comment history you can read) so that was a failed day for me.
randomactsofamazon,3dw3uj,drcrombi,2,Mon Jul 20 01:39:52 2015 UTC,I found out about the sale way to late. I wasn't able to purchase prime and afford items at the time. If it was two days later I would had my check.

That being said, for as ""useless"" as the stuff was, everyone bought it all up :P I'll be online next year and hopefully I can actually snag one of their Fire HD tablets for cheap!"
randomactsofamazon,3dw3uj,joelthezombie15,2,Mon Jul 20 00:54:06 2015 UTC,I thought prime day was a one off thing because it was the 10th 15th year of amazon.

randomactsofamazon,3dva5g,Omphalophobiac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"Italian Beef Recipe  Â   Ingredients:  Â    5 lbs chuck roast (I think that was what I used) 1 package French Onion Soup 1 package Dry Italian Dressing 1/4-1/2 a bottle of Pepperoncini juice Italian Seasoning (I bought mine from a local spice shop) Beef stock (lots) (I also made my own so I could control the flavor a bit) 3 full heads of garlic (or as many as you think you want)   Â   Â   Start by coating the roast with the italian seasonings completely and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. Put the roast in a turkey/roasting pan along with packet of french onion soup, packet of italian dressing, and the pepperoncini juice. You can add some peppers if you want. Peel the garlic and cut in half. Add garlic to the roaster. Pour in beef stock until it just covers the roast. You can substitute water in place of the stock if needed. Set the roaster on 375 degrees and cook for 4-6 hours. Let cool a little and shred. Put into a foil pan and cover with the juice to keep moist. Be sure to get all the garlic and even pop a couple pieces into your mouth. Slice slider buns and make sandwiches.  Â   This recipe is a play by ear type thing. You can add chicken broth for a little bit of flavoring if you want. You can add more spices if you like a certain one. I got this recipe from a friend of ours originally. Hope that is what you wanted and hope you have fun making it.  Â   Sorry for all the edits. Finally figured out what I was doing wrong... forgot to add space between the start of the ingredients and the words. Reddit formatting is confusing.  Â   I also just realized that I posted this on the wrong comment oops. Oh well I will keep it up anyways. As for the cheese covered onion rings... I don't know there is a recipe. It would have to be something that is winged."

randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,Ruff_Dog,2,Sun Jul 19 05:00:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I'm a Computer Science major who's contemplating minoring in Security and Risk Analysis.  It's fairly related and I view it as more of the 'applied' side of things.  It's absolutely fascinating, too.  I love it.  After class, I'll often hang around and talk to my professor for awhile -- the dude welcomes it, being that it's summer session and no one interacts with their professors much.  It helps that I excel in that class (I have a 98% halfway through the class).  This guy definitely knows his stuff and it's amazing.  So I totally agree with you -- it's nice to talk to people that know what they're talking about."

Iâm so sad thereâs only 1 day left.   Iâm basically having a complete mental break down on my tumblr (really on my facebook snapchat and twitter but everything is all put together on my tumblr) but itâs okay, Iâll be okay, Iâm making lots of revelations and realizations that are good for me. Between what happened at 6 am today and what happened around 4 / 5 pm Iâm emotionally drained.   Iâm going to go get very very drunk, as in very very drunk. Probably wonât be on much or at all until Tuesday or Wednesday. Tomorrow is an extended day & the last day of the festival then Monday is the 6 month anniversary of me ignoring a text which eventually led to my boyfriendâs death soooo yea. Lots of stuff going on. I feel like I just need time for me, which is what this festival was supposed to be but it kinda got ruined in that sense by the ohio people so Iâm gonna do a disappearing act temporarily <3   My tumblr is probably gonna be very active for a few days so if yâall actually want a dramatic saga, feel free to creep on my life."
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,GolldenFalcon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:11:17 2015 UTC,"I just read this and feel abysmal.  I've been having a lot of terrible thoughts lately and have been in slight to major depression as well, although haven't really lost anyone important to me. I've kinda lost myself, but that's irrelevant. If you wanna talk at all, PM me. Forewarning, it might take me a while to answer since I'm having my breakdown on my phone atm, so might not be on reddit every day... I'll be sober too. Not old enough to drink yet.  EDIT: I just checked out your wishlist. Are you a musician by any chance...? :)"
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,Rising_Star1et,0,Sun Jul 19 13:16:14 2015 UTC,"thanks <3 I've had severe depression since I was little so I know how bad it sucks...TECHNICALLY in the states, I'm not old enough to drink either, but it doesn't mean I don't.....in Canada it's 18 / 19 depending on which province you're in so I'm completely legal here though.   What qualifies as musician? I've been a singer and writer ever since I can remember. Only lyrics though, I never learned how to write / read music. I know what notes are on a staff but can't belt out a pitch on the drop of a dime. I've always wanted to learn guitar and maybe eventually piano. I dated so many drummers and I like them, I just don't have a preference to learn to play them."
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,Ruff_Dog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:54:43 2015 UTC,"I've had severe depression   Hey!  So I'm not depressed or anything, but I have an avid interest in psychology, but have you heard of this book?  It's really helped me out when I've been upset.  Other people who have had it worse than me say they've experienced dramatic changes due to it.  I just think it's a solid book."
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,GolldenFalcon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"Well, the reason I asked, is because I'm a musician, and I thought that maybe some time we could just have a makeshift jam session or something across the internet. Music definitely helps my mood and emotions, even if only temporarily. When I'm with my instruments, is basically the only time I'm truly happy.  From what you'd told me, I'd definitely consider you a musician. Being able to sing is pretty huge in music. And tbh there are a lot of experienced musicians out there who have no idea how to read/write music, so no worries on that part.  And also, maybe if we could figure out a way, I could teach you guitar if you wanted. I've never really taught anyone before, so it might go a bit rough, but the offer is out there if you want.  All in all, I hope everything turns out alright. I can't be the extreme optimist and guarantee it, because I know the pain, but we can all hope."
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,Rising_Star1et,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:19:05 2015 UTC,Yea I'd love to try to figure out some way to do an internet session. I just finished writing the last of 7 songs I imagine being on an EP someday (then have a few more in the works for the next one after that; kind of a chronicle of all the things that have happened the past few years). Of course I know I'll never get to record them or release anything and definitely never get to sing with some of my biggest dream collabers but it's fun to imagine.   I've got covers filmed to go up on youtube I just haven't gotten them up yet.
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,GolldenFalcon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:22:54 2015 UTC,"I know I'll never get to record them or release anything   Never say never :)  I know it's stupid and cliche and everyone says it and usually it never happens and why should we even imagine but seriously. Do you think Boyce Avenue expected to have multiple million subscribers? :D  We gotta work at these things! Sometimes, we might get really lucky. :)   And hey, songwriting is a really good skill to have, even if it's only acapella or vocals, since words (in my opinion) are stronger than notes.     Which makes me extremely sad that I cannot sing."
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,Rising_Star1et,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"haha yea if I would have kept up with the youtube scene when I was in high school I probably could have gotten bigger. It's a lot more commercialized now and I don't have the right equipment to keep up with it (I used to be a vlogger too) anymore.   Maybe someday something like youtube will be born, if and when youtube ever dies, and it won't be so professional and I'd have a chance.   Right now, it's all about the politics of youtube. There are groups, and levels, and it's all about people know people know people. It's kinda like high school almost. I tried a few months ago to jump back in but it was too much for me with everything going on."
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,GolldenFalcon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:27:57 2015 UTC,":/  Yeah I guess you're right. I've never really thought that deep into it actually.  I always had the mindset of, hey why not give it a shot? Just for fun you know. And if I get famous, that's a bonus. It'd be great to do something you love for a living.  I dunno. I'm still young. I think."
randomactsofamazon,3dsyf2,Rising_Star1et,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:33:14 2015 UTC,"haha I""ll upload stuff and keep recording, eventually....and hopefully one day I'll get into it enough to actually buy a camera and do stuff. I've just been having so many other things and wanted to try to focus on life for a second and when I finally thought things had calmed down, everything the past few weeks has been going on and I don't handle things well.....

randomactsofamazon,3dstea,Michlerish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"Aww, don't worry about the debt. I think it's becoming extremely rare for people to graduate without debt.  I've been out of university for 6 years, but I'm on track to pay off my debt in less than 3 years now (but I'm not working in my field of study). Plus you've been through it before, so you'll probably be a lot better with your money this time around.  I dream of going back to get my Masters and PhD one day, but the new debt scares me.  I think you've chosen a pretty safe field, career-wise.  You might even be able to work remotely!  Check out elance.com if you want contract jobs.  You've been all over the USA!

They even have canned food, cleaning supplies, personal care items (some brand names).  Especially pens/pencils, notebooks, etc.  I would check there first, then Walmart.  Best recipes for budget eating would involve rice, beans, lentils, legumes, carrots, potatoes, and frozen vegetables.  They can all be purchased in bulk for low prices, and you can cook a large dish on Sunday evening and eat leftovers throughout the week :)  I used to purchase whole chickens wherever they were on sale, roast on Sunday, eat the legs that night for dinner, use the rest for sandwiches throughout the week, then freeze the carcass. Next Sunday (or a couple of weeks later), I'd use 1-2 chicken carcass' to make a huge pot of soup or broth!  Then you can portion that out and freeze some.  Very economical and delicious.  :)"

It's a lot calmer than the past few days where I was wanting to be near the stage for the bigger shows so I didn't get to walk around and chill as much.   As for the ex saga, I gave him the chance to move in with it, and he completely ignored it, so much for wanting to prove how much he care and how sorry he is. So I'm done. I cried for a while, had a panic attack of maybe I'm doing the wrong thing, then grabbed a bottle of crown royal. If any of the other 3 Ohio guys do the same thing, since they're all starting to contact me randomly again after years, I'll give them the same choice. Either move from Ohio into my apartment in Watertown with me, or leave me alone.   Tomorrow there is A LOT of bands, second to last day of the festival, and it's an extended day. Simple Plan is playing halfway through the night, which I haven't seen them in YEARS, so I'm excited but they're the only ones I know so it should be another fun day :D"

I had no boxes or anything and figured cause it was only in the building next door it wouldn't be a big issue. I had a friend help me before he went to work to move the couch, dressers, and bookshelves which was the really heavy stuff, got that done in about 2 hours. 8 hours more of just me and my gf moving stuff and still only about 90% done. Did some more the next morning (extremely sore) before work but was having a really hard time doing stairs so said fuck it I'll wait til Saturday to finish. Only a few trips worth of stuff to do Saturday so no big. Down side is the building they moved us into is a bit more expensive for rent, but is a much nicer unit and now I have a balcony which is great because I'm a smoker and keeps the place from smelling like an ashtray.

I have recently started playing League of Legend but haven't had the time to sit down and actually learn the game. It seems like I easily could get addicted though."

Mario and Kirby are awesome, Pokemon is where it's at (Arcanine da bess). I spent well over 300 hours on ACNL before I pulled myself out of that hole, now I'm addicted to Rocket League. PS Plus gave it out for free so I've invested heavily in it.  League is something I'll probably never get fully into, just because I'm always in that ""I can tank everything forever"" mentality from other games and MMOs."

And local information like what people think of them.   One thing also if there's public transportation find out what it is like. When I lived in Pittsburgh. I found out certain buses were terrible. So I learned to avoid them.   Last, if you have friends you can ask them their experiences. If not there's bound to be a sub about it do some digging there and you'll find a wealth of information from other redditors.   Oh and don't be afraid to explore! You'll find things that may be of interest to you. Just check the crime rates first if you are worried about that Haha.   edit: Some really terrible grammar fix. Geeze.

Kilkenny is a neat city, the castle and its gardens are beautiful, but there's also a trail walk you can explore around it. Sometimes they also have a farmers market in the same area.

My fog was a bit tense to start, but just kinda chilled with us humans. The cat loved to explore, and kept trying ti get in the bedroom. She got under the bed. It took a while to get her out. We went for dinner and seperated yhen. My dog stress peeded on the couch :/. But when we let the cat back out he kept trying to sniff her butt, and approach her to have a new friend, but backed off when she hissed, and then tried again. Such a nice boy!  Also I loved spending time with my sister. It was just so fabulous! I miss spending time with her (and her fiancee)! We did a lot of wedding talk!!!! AHHHH . I am just so excited!

Imagine a 10 story floating mall and that's what we were on!  We got to Belfast but decided to continue straight on to Dublin because there's been a lot of craziness going on there the last few days.    Once we got to Dublin, we tried to get to Arklow but had a lot of misinformation and confusion.  After missing a few buses we finally got on one to Arklow where the person who's apartment we're renting picked us up and took us to the house.  It's a cute little One bedroom house that will perfectly suit our needed for the rest of our time abroad.  Today is just a rest and get groceries and relax kind of day.  We'll check out Dublin another day and spend our time split between Dublin and this area until it's time to go home.    This trip has been so amazing and we've learned so much. Not just about the places we've visited but ourselves as well!  Hopefully the internet here will cooperate enough for me to post our blogs (mostly I'll be using my daily posts from here since its hard to remember everything that's happened lol) and pictures!!    Thank you all so much for reading and keeping me sane at the times I needed it! I love this community so much and you all have made my life so much better since I found raoa!!!

Now all of that stopped it's just raining with little thunder.   Edit. Okay because i'm weird like that and scared shitless. I downloaded my snapchat to youtube.

There's Loca the Pug  And this joke:  The coach had put together the perfect team for the Baltimore Ravens. The only thing missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win.  Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in the West Bank. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Israeli soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. KABOOM! He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. KA-BLOOEY! Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. BULLS-EYE! I've got to get this guy!"" Coach said to himself. ""He has the perfect Arm!""  So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Ravens go on to win the Super Bowl. The young man is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his Mother.  ""Mom,"" he says into the phone, ""I just won the Super Bowl!"" ""I don't want to talk to you, the old woman says."" You are not my son!""  ""I don't think you understand, Mother,"" the young man pleads. ""I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""  ""No! Let me tell you!"" his mother retorts. ""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!"" The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says, ""I will never forgive you for making us move to Baltimore!!!!"

I walked into the breakroom for my first break, to find that someone decided to take my lunchbox out of the fridge and sit it on the counter to make room for their huge bag (i have a tiny lunchbox dammit!!) several hours ago.   My leftover salad (covered in dressing already) disintegrated. My milk is hot and will have to be tossed. My soda is hot but will obvs be fine. My mayo/tuna cup is sweating so Im just gonna toss it.   What does this mean? I get to go a 12 1/2hr shift with just a soda. Fuck people. :("

Hope you all had a more restful night than I :)  After I posted last night we got on the train in Glasgow to Ayr...it was clearly the drunk train and we got to enjoy our ride with 3 lovely screaming completely trashed individuals.    Upon arriving in Ayr we found out that the train station closes after the last train (ours) and with much frustration, frantic fruitless internet searching for a place to keep warm, and eventually help from a nice rail station worker we figured out that the place to go when you have no place to sleep/keep warm is the airport.   One quick/expensive taxi ride later we found ourselves in the Glasgow preswick airport with ~30 other weary travelers crashed out on every available semi comfortable space.    Btw the way of you ever find yourself in need of a place to sleep for a few hours in a city with an airport but no 24 options....go sleep at the airport, apparently it's the thing to do.  Not the best sleep in the world but not the worse we've had on this trip.  We're now on the bus to Cairnryan where we'll catch the ferry to Belfast.    Hope all is well with you all!! <3<3"

I have never gotten to see them perform live and it was just so special for me. Itâs so special for me to be able to see artists like Hedley, like Kira Isabella, like Dallas Smith (who I get to see perform tomorrow night!) because not only are they amazing artists, the way I found them, and the reasoning behind why and how I got into their music is so comforting and so special to me. Iâve gotten to see Kira a ton of times and Dallas a few but never got to see Hedley until tonight.

If you want to weld or be an artisan, there is no real reason to go to normal college.... also, I guess you are past this stage now, but there's no reason to apply to more than 4-5 schools... I was amazed by people applying to 10-18 at my highschool... WHY!? You're just throwing money away when college app costs can be $100-150, if you apply to 10-18 schools.. oh my gosh!

However, the same concept applies to what I'm about to tell you. I'm 27. I'm not old, but I've pretty much got this adult thing figured out. I finished high school at the age of 17 and went right into a job at a call center for a year while I figured out what I wanted to go to school for. A year later I had a pretty good idea, but no money and didn't want a huge amount of crippling debt. Another year later, no money. Another year later, still no money. 7.5 years I spent in that hell hole telling myself I didn't have enough money or the debt was too much to handle. I realized one day I was making excuses. I bit the bullet and applied for a few courses and OSAP (Ontario Student Assistance Program). Went to school for 2 years and guess what!? Now I'm in debt! And it's really not so bad! Student loans help your credit, you get amazing tax write offs, and you get the life experience of going to college (or university). It's worth it. Dive in, you'll be fine. (Just do your best to go to school for something that has available jobs. Don't be one of those 17th century history mojors bitching about not being able to find work in their field after school.)"

randomactsofamazon,3dd2m3,Doctor-Kitten,3,Wed Jul 15 13:07:48 2015 UTC,"Community colleges and Technical Colleges are generally free rides with financial aid if you qualify for the PELL grant. Where the ridiculous student loans come from in the United Stats is kids go off to some high faluting ""reputable"" school for their core classes  for the ""college experience"" and end up with easily 20k in debt for virtually nothing before they even truly start their major.  Pile on the fact that they will take out excessive student loans to have money for partying/beer/games/cars/rent and that's why that TIL exists.  Irresponsible people. It's super duper easy to minimize the loans. They're just like a credit card. People think ""Free money!"" and don't think ahead.    You can easily do your core classes and associates degree at a community college and transfer to a more ""elite"" university for a Bachelors, if that's your aim, to minimize the student loans you would have to take out for tuition/boarding. My friend has finished his masters in Microbiology with minimal student loans. The college he is at is paying for his PhD as he is doing research for them and is a teaching assistant.   It's all about being smart. Street smart that is."

Don't give in and go into a career you will hate for the rest of your life unless you absolutely have to. This is your one shot at life, why would you want to spend it doing something you hate? I clawed my way into the job I am now (software engineer), and I absolutely love it because it's been my dream. Was it easy? Hell no. But I didn't settle for less when I was working at a rubber factory before my software engineer job. I realistically was making plenty of money at the factory, but I hated it because it wasn't my dream.   Don't get me wrong, if you have no other options then yes take the shitty job you don't want. But until you're backed into a corner with nowhere else to go, keep trying for what you love and what you want to do. People will try to get you to take the easy way out but just remember that if you work hard enough you will get what you're after. Put the time in, work the hard jobs and get your ass kicked if need be. But don't ever settle for less than what you want. Get that career that you have always wanted."

randomactsofamazon,3dcajw,MrsSquishy,2,Fri Jul 17 04:01:03 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone!!! Sorry it's been a few days, didn't have good signal for a bit.  I apologize in advance for how long this post is going to be ;-)  So last post was about our last day in Edinburgh, from Edinburgh we went to Glasgow for the night on our way to Oban.  We didn't do a whole lot but we did see the Kelvingrove Museum and tried out a few pubs :) a,d got caught up on some seriously nessicary sleep!  Monday morning we took a bus through some amazingly beautiful glens and lochs and arrived in Oban, Scotland.  Oban is absolutely gorgeous and right next to the sea.  That first night we wondered around the town and walked along the coast eventually ending up by Dunollie Castle.  We then found a beach and watched the sun go down, which was fantastic!    Tuesday we went to see Dunstaffnage Castle and Dunollie Museum, Castle and Grounds, which are the former and current homes of my husband's clan.  Dunstaffnage is very cool, you can still see what used to be where and it is very well preserved.  There's even the remains of the chapel, which we had a little ceremony of sorts in ;-).  Dunollie is really awesome but you can go in the castle part since they just started preserving and opening it to the public a few years ago. It was really cool to see his family's history though!  Today was the best part of Oban so far!! We went on a three isles tour which included a ferry ride to Mull, a 90 minute bus ride across the isle of Mull, another ferry to Iona, and finally a smaller ferry to Staffa and then of course repeated but backwards.  Mull was incredibly amazing the highlands are gorgeous and I loved seeing all the animals all over the place!   Iona was fantastic especially the Abbey, which was the main reason we went to Oban and on the isles tour!  Since my husband is a medievalist, Iona is super important to him because of how old the nunnery and Abbey and because of how it was used in the spread of Christianity. And as amazing as the first two were Staffa was just the icing on the cake!!!  Staffa is a tiny uninhabited island on the west coast of Scotland.  Its home to Fingal's cave and so so many puffins!!! Omg the puffins were so cute! And we got to be litterally less than 2 feet from them and their nests! They were everywhere and the make the cutest sound, kind of like a small motor boat, which we couldn't decide if it was a growl or a mating sound. Either way most adorable and unexpected sound to come from them. We got to sit next to them and watch them fly off and on the island and go into their nests!  After chilling with the puffins we went to the cave which was so beautiful!!   The entire day was so incredible and everywhere we went was so insanely gorgeous my words or pictures could never do it justice!  After finishing the return trip we got onto a train (which is where I'm typing this from) going to Glasgow. Once we get there we'll get on another train to Ayr, where we'll get another train to Cairnryan.  From there we'll get on a ferry to Belfast in Northern Ireland, at which point we will either explore a little bit. If we aren't too tired, we'll hang out for a few hours in Belfast and then catch a bus to Dublin then another bus to Arklow, where we are staying for the rest of our trip.  If we're too tired then we'll just go straight through to Dublin then  Arklow.  It's been a long day and we're only about halfway through!!  Whew! Thanks for reading all that, lol! I miss you guys and I'm sorry I've been off the grid for a few days but that shouldn't happen again :)  I hope everyone's doing well and has had a great week so far!  Love ya, MrsSquishy!"

It's a simple design and easy to use, and there are a ton of budgets you can set and alter. There is both a mobile app for it as well as a website you can use. I found it really helpful in being more aware of my spending, and showed me where I'm putting my money and how much it would benefit me to move funds around towards other things.

randomactsofamazon,3d9s03,drharris,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt, YNAB. It's well worth the money, IMO. I've used it since it was just an Excel spreadsheet template, and it has always been the way I like to think about money. Keep in mind that it's not just a piece of software, but a methodology. It follows something like the Envelope method, meaning that you basically take income and give every dollar a ""job"", or thing to be put towards. There are different ways you can do that, but to me YNAB just makes things easy. You could also find similar spreadsheet templates online and just do it yourself in Google Docs. As long as you are taking income, assigning that income a place to be spent, and ensuring your transactions for each category total less than your budgeted amount, you're golden.  If you'd be ok using a version older (Windows only), I can officially gift you my old YNAB v3 license through their website. They also allow you to do a free trial on the newer stuff. Just PM me an email and name to provide them and I'm willing to gift it over.  Edit: my personal testimonial I did a few years back.

Alright, so I partially lied about the order; this one deserves the top spot. While I have not read a lot of EU material, I am a huge Star Wars geek. I am sad to hear they're making more canon Episodes (the movies told the story of Anakin Skywalker, and that story is over; if they want to make more, they should start a new enumeration), but I will undoubetdly go see it and love it anyway. Because nostalgia. ASOIAF. I discovered the books last year, and I bought and devoured all of them. I don't particularly like the show, but in the absence of new books, I have started watching it. Meh. Archer. Another recent discovery; the SO and I are working our way through the series on Netflix. The writing is always brilliant. Doctor Who. I was introduced with Matt Smith's first episode, and then went back and watched from Season 1. I've seen smatterings of the original series, but not as much as I'd like. Firefly. Own the series and the movie; working on getting my hands on the comics. Red vs. Blue. Friend showed it to me in middle school, and I haven't stopped watching it since. RWBY. It is charming despite its (many) flaws. I am apprehensive but hopeful about it continuing in the wake of Monty's death. Homestuck. Great way to waste a few hours each day at a computer when you can't do your job because your coworkers refuse to do theirs. Sherlock Holmes. The Doyle stories, not any of the (how many are there now?) ridiculous TV shows. Though I enjoy RDJ's portrayal, I don't like the liberties they took with the character. Avatar the Last Airbender. This hit right as I was deciding I didn't like kids' shows anymore. For a cartoon at a time when cartoons were idiotic, this was fantastic. The fact that I am also a martial arts geek definitely helped. I haven't watched most of Legend of Korra, but I probably will at some point. The Lord of the Rings. I'm not nearly as into this as my SO is, but I greatly enjoyed the books and mostly enjoyed the movies."

Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe (because it's one of my favorites) Deadpool Kills Deadpool (because Pandapool) Deadpool Dracula's Gauntlet (because vampires) Deadpool Merc with a Mouth (because it's hilarious) Deadpool Corps (because more Deadpool!) Deadpool's Art of War (because Sun Tzu, duh) Deadpool Pulp (Because it has awesome art and gritty story) Night of the Living Deadpool (because zombies) Return of the living Deadpool (because more zombies)   Edit: The popular schizophrenic Deadpool style is really only in the 2008-2012 comics.

randomactsofamazon,3d7r1h,jbrake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:49:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, I own a bingo company and have my own format."
randomactsofamazon,3d7r1h,drcrombi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:12:55 2015 UTC,What makes your BINGO unique?  Why would I want to play your BINGO other over BINGOs?  I do love me some BINGO.
randomactsofamazon,3d7r1h,jbrake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"I wrote about this in another thread, so I'm gonna copy paste some. I also don't want to go too far into detail about format without it being a business conversation because people seriously try to copy it constantly.  In my format of bingo, you have a better chance of winning for starters. See, bingo prizes are fixed, meaning the odds are directly related to the amount of people playing. You have a crap ton of folks playing in bingo halls, but not as many in bar bingo, meaning you have a better chance coming out to a smaller night. Not only that, but legit casino bingo involves buying your own cards, which brings with it another set of probabilities (buying the ""right"" cards, how many did others buy, etc). Also, you should avoid side bets and line bets like the plague. In Utah where I'm based, gambling of any sort is illegal. The way I get around this is charge nothing to play and provide the cards to people. The prizes and cash jackpot are put up by the bar and in return, people come out and spend money on food, drinks, etc. (but I can't give extra cards for folks who do that or it's called ""consideration"" and is once again illegal). Because of the initial fixed card ratio, plus I bought all the cards and know there is no duplicates, you have a much better chance of winning. Also, not paying to play means no tax issues when you win the cash jackpot.  Second, my format is more fo a show than just bingo calling. There's very audience involved tiebreakers, contests, jokes, etc. The cash jackpot is also progressive so it keeps going up as people miss requirements each week to win it. Biggest it has ever been is $5300, and some guy won that for free for playing bingo in a bar."

I still have to make a thank you thread  it's been a busy week. The gift that we (my wife and I) received came at the perfect time. She was having a horrible day and that little brown box brightened her day. It's the little things like that which is why I will stay a part of this community and pay it forward when I have the chance.
randomactsofamazon,3d6fwk,not-gonna-tell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"I like that this sub is small. I gravitate more to it because it's small, yet still active. I like that there are rules, but the mods are still approachable and don't just ban people for the smallest thing. I like that the mods do monthly bombs and bigger bombs, even though it's a lot of work.   I miss the semi-regular CAH games, but I could be starting them, too, and I havent, so....  I don't have any complaints,  though I'm not in any hurry for this sub to get huge because I've seen what that does in other subs.  Overall, I think this sub is great."
randomactsofamazon,3d6fwk,budgiebum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:14:37 2015 UTC,"The sub is fine. I have faith in you guys. You really take care of anything that may arise, and that's great.  I enjoy the people and come back for them. Gifting subs have great user bases and are fun to interact with.  Definitely want to see more growth. A wider variety of people to talk to. I'm looking forward to the big contest bomb again though. Will you guys do one for the fall? Twice a year would be fun :3 Exchanges are fun, and so are the mini-bombs, but regular bombs are AMAZING.  I can only think of one thing i'd like to see less, but it's truly personal and not worth mentioning. I guess technically i'd like to see less not-gifting. Myself included.  All I want is for you guys to keep protecting the users. I'm curious if you partner with the other gifting subs in scammer bans? Summer time seems to have brought them out. Or at least this is my first time noticing."
randomactsofamazon,3d6fwk,budgiebum,2,Tue Jul 14 02:02:33 2015 UTC,"The fall, when everyone comes back for school is when we plan on doing another big bomb. It'll be on the heels of this Dog Days exchange.  I'm working on gifting more honestly. Trying to do once a week :/  We don't necessarily partner with the other subs. We share information informally but we don't have an official all ban list."
randomactsofamazon,3d6fwk,Doctor-Kitten,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"As expected :) I'll be waiting for it!  I liked seeing the group gift yall did this past week. It allows everyone to help and gift someone else. I wish I had known about it. Maybe find a way to streamline the knowledge about those? I definitely love group gifting.  And as for the last here, that's fine. I think, personally, that once the sub gets bigger it should be addressed. I've personally found that every sub over 10k gets a lot of shit people and shit posts. I love growth, but ya invite the bad with the good. In my eyes your role is to protect your users, which you do well :) and I thank you."

Side effect of being a small sub.   Alot of stuff I do is all online / social media centered as far as working with brands / growing my personal empire so it's easy for me to come on reddit whenever I want (sans the past week / upcoming week where I'm at a music festival).

randomactsofamazon,3d6fwk,Rising_Star1et,2,Mon Jul 13 22:36:12 2015 UTC,i know

The others, well they have responded to being summoned with a friendly demeanor. Although I wish I would see the other mods around a bit more often. It would be nice to know they are well... involved.  I am here for the people. I like the idea of a community. I like having people to talk to. Its nice. And it is in a nice setting.  You need a daily button of the top for links... but thats jsut me being nitpicky haha.  I like the monthly bomb... but maybe advertise it a bit more.  You need to update the sidebar for more recent info for our outside activities like the Skype group etc. When I went to it, it was locked, and it took me a bit to track down how to join.  I also don't particulary care for the line about people lying about sob stories. I am sure some are, but some people arent... yea if someone is barnd new and comes on and makes a sob story.... immediately... well yea I agree... maybe make it a bit less ... blunt?  Maybe have some weekly/monthly activity that can have all of us able to ineract with each other a bit more?

I also use a ""clacker pad"" I don't see them around often but its a sticker that goes on the bass drum that has a metal insert in the middle and you stick it right where your beaters hit. It really helps for double bass on a single bass drum, you get a thicker sound that gets you right in the chest."

But thanks for the reminder about them, because I made a mental note last time I was recording to get one. I started recording for a punk band last year and I've had trouble getting a good attack out of the kick drum. The engineer is a little new and all I'm getting is a boomy tone. I'm hoping one of those pads will tighten up the sound a lot. I've got the wooden beaters that came with the iron cobras so I'll pair those two up and see what happens! Thanks!  Edit: added to wish list ;)"

randomactsofamazon,3d37hy,Rising_Star1et,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:35:44 2015 UTC,"I'm so super tired because I couldn't sleep because I kept having weird dreams about the 3 / 4 people from Ohio that I would rather not be having dreams about so I laid down at 6 am and was back up at 8 am and waiting for 2 pm for Day 5 to start.   Day 5 was insane....fairly intense..it's really starting to hit me being out & about doing stuff for over half the day, every day, because I usually don't but it's definitely been an interesting experience  I guess they decided after 5 days of fun, especially with the weekend being longer days, that people needed a day off because today (Monday) is a day off. I almost wish it was tomorrow because tomorrow makes 5 months that I would have been engaged if my boyfriend hadn't died. Usually on the 7th, 14, and 20th of each month I spend all day sitting by the river and crying and talking to him, and I'm sure I will tomorrow just not into the night like I usually do.  Lots of new artists I've never heard up lines up for Tuesday though, plus one of my all time loves Brantley Gilbert. I have no doubt that's not a coincidence because his song ""Saving Amy"" used to be one of my favorites and it's taken on so much more meaning to me ever since my boyfriend died. Even though I'm pretty sure he won't perform it, just that idea in my head makes it amazing.   I definitely think today is going to be full of sleep and / or maybe driving back to Watertown, New York (about 2 hours away) where my apartment is and trying to get some stuff done there. I'm in the mood for fruit.....I kinda wanna go find some fruit.....I might have to drive to my apartment though because there is very little that stays open in Canada at night. I was shocked back in January to discover that walmarts here close!!! Of course in Watertown the only things open are Walmart, Walgreens, planet fitness, and a few random diners but I mean come on, that's better than nothing!  Wow this was a novel tonight, I'm sorry you guys <3"

Lots of farms, so if you've ever wanted to trash talk a cow, we've got that covered. :P  Massena is a better place for shopping. They have a ""sort of"" mall, and a pretty decent shopping plaza. Probably 20 minutes from Potsdam, depending on if you get stuck behind a tractor"

If Takeda and Miyamoto run it for an increased amount of time, I don't think I'll be able to control my excitement.

Signing in to .co.uk and shipping to the UK means no extra costs other that what you see as shipping. Signing in to .com and shipping to the UK means more. Prime is limited to the region you bought it for unfortunately.  As an aside, shipping for UK is free for orders of Â£20 and over or Â£10 of books usually. If it's not from marketplace sellers."

Prime can only be used on the website you bought it for. For myself a Canadian who want to gift in the US with prime shipping means I need 2 prime accounts.

randomactsofamazon,3cz7ev,Talllkitten,2,Sun Jul 12 21:44:57 2015 UTC,Bah thats tough because i love my kids names. I was the ultimate fan boy with my youngest amd named him Xavier after professor x. And my oldest is named after a friend who passed who was a big inspiration to me.   But to answer your question. I would name mt oldest Superfly (that what i wanted to name him in the first place but my ex wife wouldn't let me) and my youngest would be Luigi

He has to pick 11 PM or later?  I mean, sure, class ends at 2 for me.  I'm generally not here when he gets back at 3.  And lately, I've been out till six or so.  Then I come back for an hour..  Then go back out with friends.  I study at 11.  I don't want to be angry at 11.    And ooh, three jobs.  Sounds intense.  How's MiniCrombi?"
randomactsofamazon,3czclq,drcrombi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:48:49 2015 UTC,I think I am going to like the variety and flexibility of the 3 jobs. All 3 are completely different types of pharmacy.

They also have what is labeled as Chocorooms at the checkout where you would find chips and other grab and go snacks. The Japanese name is kinoko no yama. Both of these are great to start with! If you have an asian market, go there and try to find others and just try them randomly. You can also get ideas from taste testing videos on YouTube"

I already had these black pepper flavored potato cube things that were pretty good and a tube of grape flavored candy jelly. It probably isn't worth $25 but I like the presentation and it's definitely not stuff I would have thought to buy myself so I'm happy with it :)  Edit to add picture: http://imgur.com/wIU6pJN

I made sure to thank the people who've helped and/or encouraged me & praise those that deserved it. I hope anyone reporting to my Supervisor will be understanding & not just outline my at times harried stressed attitude. I now have a new understanding for my Supervisor's position.

My favorite part was the breath taking views of the city!!! Every time you turn around there's another amazing view!    After we finished the castle we went to the Scotch Whiskey Experience!! It was really fun, first you go on a ride, which was kind of like of Disney made whiskey and wanted to teach you about it.  After the ride you there's an educational part about the different areas of Scotland where the whiskey is made and what makes each whiskey different.  After that is the tasting in a room with thousands of bottles of whiskey collected by 1 man who never drank any of them. Each one is still sealed.  I did try a whiskey that has honey in it but wasn't up for the tasting so hubby made that sacrifice.  After the tasting he tried 4 more whiskeys, one from each region.  We then walked down the royal mile in search of food.  We ended up getting appetizers at one place and then going to the World's End for drinks and dinner.  I really liked the bartender and the food was super yummy, we even tried haggis!  I liked it but still prefer my lamb/sheep in a chop or kebab or gyro.  But I'll keep trying new things ð We then checked out a few other pubs and headed home.    I think our plan today is to try to go to the national museum but you know how plans go, lol.

randomactsofamazon,3cvnvi,Rising_Star1et,2,Sat Jul 11 06:51:01 2015 UTC,"Well I woke up, felt like complete crap, the sun was way too bright, and I didnât remember anything that happened past midnight so one guess what happened.   Finally decided to get ready, burnt myself for the third consecutive day on my curling wand trying to get ready. Got lost for the 3 consecutive day in the festival grounds, why am I so bad with directions?!   Got to have an amazing time discovering more new artists, and got to see Marianas Trench perform!! Swung by the Kanye Wet show for a while but I hadnât eaten for 3 days, so I decided to get food instead (sorry Kanye).   I am going to go find a bar and have some fun and tomorrow there are no artists I know (well supposedly IGGY AZALEA is in the lineup but I donât like her so weâll just ignore that) so I am going to go discover more people.  I have really been loving discovering all these new bands, getting to meet some awesome artists, and overall am having a complete blast at Ottawa Blues Fest. Day 4 starts in about 17 hours, letâs take bets on whether Iâll burn myself again getting ready and / or get lost on the festival grounds, AGAIN.   Random note: you guys know I havenât really been on reddit except to pop in here every once in a while (because of the festival) and I clicked on the front page (stupid phone, clicking wrong things) and thereâs drama again in the corporate world of reddit?

I do appreciate the fact that they have all forms and genres of music at this festival (Last night there was Chance the Rapper and Kanye West among others; we've had some country artists and more to come, traditional blues music, alt music, ect) I just cannot for the life of me figure out why there was such a high demand for Iggy.....like if we're going to get bad pop / hip hop / whatever she is music in here, couldn't they have at least gotten Nicki Minaj?"
randomactsofamazon,3cvnvi,LillyMerr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:35:26 2015 UTC,It sounds like a really really awesome festival!  It's awesome that they mix all genres for sure. But I'm not even sure how popular Iggy is with people now. They had to cancel her tour. Haha.
randomactsofamazon,3cvnvi,Rising_Star1et,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:37:55 2015 UTC,hahaha idk everyone went crazy for the fact that Kanye West was in Ottawa so maybe it's one of those things where Canada doesn't get a lot of American artists so maybe she's more popular up here?

randomactsofamazon,3cvnvi,Rising_Star1et,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:57:25 2015 UTC,"haha yea I feel bad for the west, usually all the tours go through Toronto or Montreal, never out west. Sometimes bigger artists go th BC / Vancouver.  + It's farther away for everyone here. Usually in the bigger states, you're never more than 4 or 5 hours away from a tour stop unless you're in the plain states. I know when I lived in Ohio I would have my choice of driving less than 2 hours north, 2 - 3 hours east into PA, 2 hours south to Columbus or 4.5 hours south to Cinci on any given artist's tour. In Canada there's only those few cities that American artists usually go to so people have to travel far to go to concerts. Not a huge fan of rap or Kanye, I went by the show last night then went and got food. Half the people were going insane, and half were pissed he was 20 min late."
randomactsofamazon,3cvnvi,LillyMerr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:12:30 2015 UTC,Yeah. No one really goes there because it's soo far away just to do one show. I'm sure it takes a lot to make it worth it. Only people as big as Taylor Swift or someone like that even go there some of their tours.  Haha. Were they actually expecting Kanye to be on time? That doesn't seem very likely.

I found out one of the deals that's going to be happening on amazon prime day (anyone need salt / pepper grinders?)   I do not remember anything that happened past midnight last night and I still think the sun is too bright right now.....  a little over an hour before festival starts tonight & Marianas Trench is performing tonight but before that I get to discover all sorts of new artists!! (and get lost on the festival grounds again because I STILL don't know how to navigate it!)

randomactsofamazon,3crd1i,MrsSquishy,3,Fri Jul 10 13:50:03 2015 UTC,Happy Birthday /u/ngwoosh and /u/diemonkeys!!!  Yesterday we arrived in Edinburgh and it's amazing!!!  So green and beautiful and the buildings are so cool!!  The first thing we did was find a park since we couldn't check in right away.  I saw holyrood park on the map and off we went.  At that point we figured out tbat this park was actually huge and had mountains and hiking trails and is amazing!!! I got to see the inside of Scottish parliament for a sec (i had to pee and couldn't find another bathroom) which was very cool and I want to go back and hubby hiked to the top of the hill and said it was amazing and we want to go back lol.  Once it was time to check in to our Airbnb room we headed in and eventually found our way to a very nice couple's townhouse and did some much needed laundry.  We then wondered back to the city center and found food near the royal mile.  I had some incredible Mac and cheese and steak and hubby had skink soup and a much better version of fish and chips.  So far the first day was great and I can't wait to get out and explore the rest of the city that I've already fallen in love with!  Also we've figured out our key to happiness(or at least what we need while traveling) is a nice park lol!  Today the plan is to head back to where we were yesterday since there's a bunch of museums and we want to check out the park more and see parliament!  I hope everyone has a great day!!! <3<3 MrsSquishy

I ask because Bed, Bath, Beyond sends out their catalogs every 3 - 4 weeks with 5 off 15 coupons on the back (you can only get the 20% off one item emailed to you, which is great for bigger items but for smaller t he 5 off 15 are good). There's some stuff there I want for the apartment but don't know anyone in this new town to just ask them to hand over their (seemingly useless) catalog to me.   I used to know some of the older people in my neighborhood back in Ohio and they would gladly let me take their catalogs off their hands (one less piece of junk mail). I don't need the whole catalogs, just the little strip coupon on the back of them."

The last location we went to we almost gave up there, because we got lost and went on a much longer hike than we needed to, but we were so proud when we found it! It was decently hidden and quite the find. It definitely helped with the urge to explore that I've had lately. So summer also means friends to me, and I've actually been hanging out with them a lot which is awesome! Normally I'm a bit of a recluse because I never really got invited to stuff, but this time I've gotten to go out, do things I've never done, and surprised another coworker who was in the hospital for a really long time which gave me that warm fuzzy feeling inside. I've got so much planned for this summer that once fall hits, I'll be doing whatever snow does for a few months."

Yesterday we went to st Peter's church in Sunderland and Durham church in well Durham. Both were cool in their own way, but they were definitely more hubby's thing than mine.    After we got back to Newcastle we went to a bar called Gotham town, which was pretty cool.  I got proper drunk and was feeling really good til that last drink hit.  I've been drinking vodka oranges the whole trip so I'd gotten used to them but last night I had all triples...of which I had 5 in roughly 2 hours. Not my best plan lol but I had fun during ;-)  hubby got us home and took care of me.    My plan was to sleep it off but a combination of nausea and a fucking car alarm that has been going off all night has prevented that so far.  I've slept some just not as much or as consistently as I wanted.   So hubby talked to the front desk and they can't do shit about the car alarm but the whole hotel can hear it and it's been going since midnight.   I think this is karma reminding me why I don't normally drink lol.  Anyways gonna attempt to sleep...or possibly join the guy who offered the brick as a solution.  Love ya guys <3<3"
randomactsofamazon,3cifmb,VKilledTInternet,3,Wed Jul 8 04:40:04 2015 UTC,That's a bit of booze! I know the feeling of being excited and overdoing it. Hope some of that sleep was restful!
randomactsofamazon,3cifmb,MrsSquishy,2,Wed Jul 8 11:23:11 2015 UTC,got about 2 hours.  lots of water and a cheese toastie and I'm doing much better!

We decided that we wanted to keep going when the tour was over so we continued on to Amsterdam, England, Wales, and will be heading for Scotland and Ireland soon!

It was more than likely because there were a group of people going through my profile downvoting everything / reporting everything and the reddit system itself flagged my account.

randomactsofamazon,3cdwpv,Rising_Star1et,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"Long story from about a month ago. Basically me & this girl made friends in another sub and we were talking because we both had a similar but tragic experience happen to us so we were kind of, I guess bonding, or sympathizing with each other, and all of a sudden we started getting messages from the mods of the sub, that ultimately led to us being banned and them either creating a million fake accounts or having each other downvote / report us into oblivion. They stalked my profile for a few weeks because the second something I posted would go up, it would have almost a dozen downvotes, while continuing to message us. She eventually deleted her account and they spilled over onto my other social media sites to the point where I had to lock them all down (my fault for using my real reddit account / real screen name; makes it too easy to find my other sites). I thought it had finally stopped and they'd moved on but I guess they were still reporting my stuff.  I'm not worried about it at this point.   I am getting ready to be at a 12 day music festival and have fun, I got approved for 2 more partnerships, I have amazing people on this sub I can talk to, PLL sub is about to be hopping tonight because of the new ep. I am curled up in my hotel watching Fast Five for the 100000 millionth time because I love this series.  Life is good :D"

randomactsofamazon,3cdwpv,Rising_Star1et,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:04:36 2015 UTC,".....well that's not sketchy at all.....  I remember in high school one of my friends was doing dual enrollment (taking college class for college credit at the college part of the day while still being in high school for part of the day) and she went to register for her second semester, they took her money, everything was fine, then they started saying they didn't have her in the system, she never registered & payed, ect even though she had all the documents proving she did. They refused to do anything so she transferred to another local campus until she actually went to college after high school graduation, but lost like $10,000."
randomactsofamazon,3cdwpv,VKilledTInternet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:16:56 2015 UTC,That's frustrating. Hopefully it's not a significiant amount and you can make it go away :/
randomactsofamazon,3cdwpv,BowtiesAreFabulous,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:50:34 2015 UTC,$1700 is significant unfortunately. They won't tell me why it's owed either. The only upside is that Missouri is a non collection state and they can sue me but that's about it. They'll get their money in October

I'm loving the beard more and more throughout the day but I'm looking forward to when I forget that it's purple or that it just becomes normal. I prefer it that way; I'm not sure why.
randomactsofamazon,3cdwpv,manathe,2,Tue Jul 7 19:27:32 2015 UTC,Yeah i know the feeling! I actually had purple hair for 6 months i think.   Only picture i could find with my purple hair. And it's very heavily edited...

randomactsofamazon,3cdwpv,JMFargo,2,Tue Jul 7 20:02:03 2015 UTC,Ooooh. Now to go buy some liquid latex body paint. For SCIENCE!
randomactsofamazon,3cdwpv,dnd1980,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:54 2015 UTC,Something like this. You just use a brush to paint it around the nail and on your finger. You can also clean out an old nail polish bottle and pour it into that so its easier.

So we went to Alnwick Castle and Gardens yesterday, which is where they filmed the scenes in the first movie of learning to fly brooms and when Harry learns how to play Quidditch.  It was so cool!  The castle is still in use by the Duke and Duchess of Northumbridge and is gorgeous.  It's super family friendly, they have tons of areas for kids with crafting, dress up, dragon quests, and the best part: Broom Flying Lessons!!!  We even got to watch 2 falconry shows!  The house part of the castle (where the family actually lives) is gorgeous and I want to commandeer their library!  One of my favorite parts of the library is that in the amazing 2 story room with thousands of hundred plus year old books is their sitting area where the family hangs out, so there's family pics (even one with the Queen of course), this huge flat screen tv, Cards Against Humanity, and been bag chairs.  They also used it to film parts of Downton Abbey so they ave displayed props and costumes from the show,  you cant take any pictures in the manor :( but its super gorgeous and decorated to the nines lol!  After the castle, we went to the gardens and they were completely breath taking!  Since I've lived my whole life in a desert seeing this much greenery and seeing so much water in fountains, canals, channels, etc is so trippy.  We've been to so many places that have water flowing everywhere and constantly, for example in Germany there was a gutter (not the gross kind we have in America) of fresh water just running through the city streets, because they can!  The fountains were incredible and the gardens even more amazing!  I never liked roses as much before but after seeing so many awe inspiring English rose gardens, I'm in love with them!  There's no way I could recreate their beauty back home so I hope my pictures will suffice until we can come back to Britain in the future!  I have to say of all the places we've been to on this trip Great Britian has been my favorite so far!  We still have a couple more days before we head to Scotland and then Ireland and I am so excited for the next 2 1/2 weeks!  I'm also so happy to be going home soon, I'm not exactly home sick but I'm just about ready, if that makes sense.  Any way to wrap up this super long post, I love it here and I can't wait to share today's adventures in Newcastle with you all tomorrow! :) <3<3 MrsSquishy"

randomactsofamazon,3cdvnc,Talllkitten,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:21:00 2015 UTC,So a chicken run is the enclosure in which the chickens are free to range. They are generally chicken wire or machine cloth sides often corrugated PVC  roofed.  As opposed to a coop which is a house-like structure which the Chickens use to sleep and nest in. Their old run was too small and they have been pissed and not laying eggs. The new run is much bigger and will hopefully placate them.
randomactsofamazon,3cdvnc,MrsSquishy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:59:14 2015 UTC,I just imagine a chicken run as like a little suburb of mini chicken coops surrounded by a big fence. Would that be safe to assume?

I like movies, video games, comics, cars, obstacle course races, tattoos, fishing, gardening, shooting, archery, I'm a Freemason, dogs, running, lifting, cooking.  Wanna chat about any of them?  I'll chat about anything, but I know a lot about those topics."
randomactsofamazon,3c9m8k,Sides4peace,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:08:30 2015 UTC,"I like comics and movies and tattoos and animals and yoga. Archery and a free mason? You have peeked my interest!   I recently applied to be a piercing apprentice at a tattoo studio, it would be amazing but I doubt I'll get it.  I'd like to see more comics made movies than the popular ones, a Fable movie would be neat, I do love the Wolf Among Us video game tho.  I am feeling a little detached from life right now, no real friends and all"
randomactsofamazon,3c9m8k,Dark_Knight7096,2,Mon Jul 6 14:50:33 2015 UTC,"Yessir!  I haven't been into archery in years, still have my old bow but no arrows left to speak of, went to go buy some the other day and was blown away by the cost of a dozen arrows.  All these crazy kids and their crazy carbon fiber arrows... hahah  Piercing apprentice would be neat, what makes you think you wouldn't get it?  I'll be honest with you, that kind of attitude can radiate from you, you need to go into interviews and applications thinking you are the shit and that if this place doesn't hire you they're stupid and will fold within a month.  The confidence will radiate and they'll see it.    A fable movie would be pretty cool, but I think the best part about Fable was the fact that there were a million possible endings and outcomes, not sure how well that would translate to a movie, but it would be neat.  I mean, the tricky part about unpopular comics being made into movies is they may not do well so you'd be hardpressed finding a studio to take a chance, I'd like to see some more one-offs become movies.  I'd love to see a Red Son movie, a Flashpoint Paradox movie, Godfall movie, I would say a Dark Knight Returns movie but they already have the animated one that's pretty damn good.  Sorry to hear that man.  I kinda know where you're coming from, I have a buncha friends but we are all ridiculously busy and doing our own things so we never talk or see each other much anymore.  It gets to a point where it just kinda feels like you're going through the motions."
randomactsofamazon,3c9m8k,Sides4peace,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"So basically I'm a little bit convinced you are like a youngish relief version of hawk eye crossed with an awesome sort of cocky guy thing.  But those are all interesting little asides.   My reasoning for them taking a chance on an unpopular comic, like say Preacher, is that Guardians of the Galaxy did not flop and I can safely say not one of the people I went to the theater with knew about them before the movie, or even know Star Lords dad is basically a bad guy   And I wish I was into an awesome sport like archery at any point in my life, I am trying to set up a class of Krav Maga instruction so there's that"

Krav Maga is a lot of fun, i've taken some classes, I don't take them any more though because I lack any free time but it was fun, except one guy who took it way too seriously.    I weigh like double this guy and I'm a full head a shoulders taller than him.  Instructor pairs us together for a warm up spar and says, ""For the first drill, try to stay moving, and impact your opponents shoulders and knees with an open handed slap.  Not hard, just make contact.""  Ok cool, we line up, I try to touch fists with this kid, nothing, he's a hardass, i'm blocking and evading, I get a slap on his knee, we reset, another slap on his knee, reset, he grabs my wrist, armbars me, slaps my face.  Hmmmmm, ok, reset.  I slap his shoulder he kicks my shin and punches me in the stomach, instructor sees it, stops all sparring looks at us, ""Center of class....Ok, full contact.""  The look on the kids face was sheer terror.  It was fun."

Not much, I have two jobs and am working both of them today, gonna hit the gym afterwards, pretty uneventful.

The fourth man is put behind a screen (or in a separate room). He gives all four men party hats. The jailor explains that there are two black hats, and two white hats; that each prisoner is wearing one of the hats; and that each of the prisoners only see the hats in front of him but not on himself or behind him. The fourth man behind the screen can't see or be seen by any other prisoner. No communication between the prisoners is allowed.  If any prisoner can figure out and say to the jailor what color hat he has on his head with 100% certainty (without guessing) all four prisoners go free. If any prisoner suggests an incorrect answer, all four prisoners are executed. The puzzle is to find how the prisoners can escape, regardless of how the jailer distributes the hats.""

Do I have to hunt, or am I given enough food/supplies for the year? Or are we just talking about Extreme hot vs Extreme cold. If that, 1 year in Antarctica. I can not stand the heat, and I can always warm myself up easier than cooling down.  Assuming we're not including eyelashes, do I have to shave it every day, or is it just professionally removed?

So while I am only fluent in English I sort of know a couple other languages.  I'm feeling a bit lazy after these 4th of July festivities... so ice cream for dinner. wooooo! P:"

Other languages like ASL and French are much harder to find. Spanish music and movies are pretty easy to locate too. I just was never interested in Spanish despite the fact that I could have learned it for free when I was in school. As we get older it's much harder to learn a language, it doesn't make it impossible it just makes it more frustrating."

randomactsofamazon,3c78ec,ngwoosh,2,Sun Jul 5 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"Good story...  I was a bassoonist in middle school and high school. Love that instrument and I wish they were affordable, otherwise I'd still play. But when I got to high school I found out that's not a marching instrument.   Now I've seen marching bassoonists before, and man... they are carrying a dangerous thing. The mouthpiece or neck is a skinny pipe called the bocal that you attach the reed to. You then put this skinny pipe with a sharp reed in your mouth. You then march. Well, marching involves a LOT of tripping and falling. And that's where I'll end that.  The high school I went to had a strict ""No Marching Double Reeds"" policy. So bassoon, english horn, and oboe players were stuck in percussion. This could be marching a bass drum if you were good enough, cymbals, or joining the sideline percussion section or ""Pit"" as we called it.   I was put in the Pit last minute. There I learned how to play marimbas and hit big drums and gongs and all the other fundamentals of drumming.  I got super into it and basically taught myself how to play a drum set by looking up a picture of a set in a magazine and visualized where everything went in my mind. I had a pair of sticks at least, so I played air drums. I did that for almost 2 years before I got a real kit.  Favorite TV shows right now are Walking Dead (havent seen season 5 yet), Sherlock, Agents of Shield, Star Wars Rebels, and Once Upon A Time.  Favorite movie will always be Shawshank."

She drove from WV to Philadelphia to have this at a specialist. There were delays so her surgery was delayed a few days which is stressing her out a lot. I didn't realize how worried I was until I had multiple dreams last night she didn't make it through surgery. I hate being across the country from her at times like this.

Then as I improved, he suggested selling them at Cons he occasionally works at; which we've done every other month this year.

randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,3,Sun Jul 5 13:37:43 2015 UTC,"Morning all,  little I'll natured this morning.   My plans for the 4th were ruined by my brother and his last minute plan to take over our house for a family  BBQ,  which would have been fine except (and I already knew this would be the case) He and his family didn't show up til after  8, by then my kids were ill and  hungry and by the time he got his shit together and had the food made,  it was too late to go watch the fireworks.   I didn't even comes out of my room the entire time.. I mean really,  I was being nice,  cuz if you don't have anything nice to say it's best to just  stfu,  right?  And I managed to get a good portion of  No Country for Old Men read so whatever.. How did everyone else's 4th turn out?"
randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,Doctor-Kitten,2,Sun Jul 5 11:50:13 2015 UTC,"Wow so rude.... you def need to say something to them. Like next time, we have to have food earlier or something.... Dont let them walk all over you.. its one thing to be quiet when you don't have something nice to say (like not liking someone's dress) but when it involves something so rude, you need to stand up for yoruself!"
randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,2,Sun Jul 5 14:18:27 2015 UTC,"Well I normally would have,  I'm rather known for speaking my mind lol,  but my dad and his girlfriend and the kids were here and they (especially my dad) we're tired of hearing me bitch about it from 4 o'clock  to 7 o'clock so I figured I'd hole up and read,  I'm pretty sure he knew I was pissed as I didn't speak to any of them the entire night... and I would say something but it won't matter,  that's just how they are,  you can never count on them for anything including being on time or caring much about what anyone else had planned smh..."

My day was pretty awesome but the pills didn't work for Jericho so he still barked all night. So no fireworks for me. It's all good though. Any plans for today?
randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,3,Sun Jul 5 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"Inconsiderate,  exactly the right word lol.   And no plans today,  it's grey and slightly rainy here and my little boy woke up with an earache,  from being in the neighbors pool I think so I'm hanging pretty tight by him for now.   Gave him some ibuprofen and a few drops of alcohol in his ear and he says he feels better.   What about you?"
randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,dnd1980,2,Sun Jul 5 13:44:50 2015 UTC,No plans today. I did get a new container and plants for my next mini garden. I'll send you pics later

randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,dnd1980,2,Sun Jul 5 14:15:13 2015 UTC,Home depot had a bunch of succulents and a really cool container. Still didn't find the other plants I want so had to settle for more succulents
randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,2,Sun Jul 5 14:05:09 2015 UTC,And they're hard to kill too lol
randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,dnd1980,2,Sun Jul 5 14:12:44 2015 UTC,Yea that's probably a good thing. I think I killed my tomato plant :/. I got two more veggies plants when I went yesterday too. Not sure why. I suck with keeping plants alive haha
randomactsofamazon,3c60xo,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,2,Sun Jul 5 14:23:58 2015 UTC,"You should see our tomatoes.. 3 plants are huge and thriving, the rest look like survivors of a nuclear assault lol"

It's definitely for the fans, I think if you weren't a fan it would be fun but not as exciting an experience. you get to go on an adventure with the Dr (can't say more...spoilers) and see a ton of prop and costumes! I got the souvenir ticket so it came with a t-shirt, companion guide, and other goodies!!  We're going to explore Cardiff a bit before heading off to Newcastle upon Tyne for a few days.  Hubby has a few medieval sites he wants to check out, I want to see Hogwarts :) after that I think we're heading to Scotland, then Ireland, then home.  We finally have tickets home and they weren't even that expensive!  That's all for now, sorry I fell asleep before starting a cah game, I'm going to try for one at the next place, internet willing :)  <3<3 MrsSquishy"

We still have about 20 days before we leave the for the states and a couple more before we're home but we'll make the most out of it!  I'm pretty excited to go to Scotland and Ireland, especially since it's where hubby and I have talked about visiting the longest but I'm also pretty excited about going home.  I'm glad we still have more time here, although I miss my family and furbabies a ton!!! I can't wait to cuddle the fuck out of my puppy and kitties!!! And of course my family and friends lol.

I'm now a functional human being. It does still crop up and bother me from time to time but I know how to handle it the right way. When that fails I do have some medz that will help. Not everything can be fixed with medicine and not everything can be fixed without them either.

Kind of like before and after when i dyed my hair. But in a wrong order, it's more like after and before.   This part is the hardest... :D  1) I like my cheekbones.   2) And my eyes and lips.  3) And my personality, because i don't really care what other people think about me so i can do whatever i want.

That is so important and necessary and so many people don't.  As much as I have trouble remembering to take my meds I know it's important, it makes me a more functional, calmer version of myself and I know it's just something that I have to do to help correct the parts of my brain chemistry that aren't performing as well as it can.   Go you!!  I'm on Megabus Wi-Fi so no pics unfortunately but I will post things that I love.   Currently I love what I can make my body do, I haven't been able to say that for years and years (almost a decade) but right now I'm proud of and happy with what my body can finally do.  I never thought I'd be able to say walking 3-4 average is no big deal, that IS such a big deal for me.  For so long I've felt trapped in a body I hated, that I felt betrayed by, but now my body does things I never thought possible.  I don't care that my weight doesn't seem to be changing much, because I am healthier, I have a capable body that can take me to all these beautiful and amazing places that I never thought I would see.  Thank you for reminding me to appreciate that, I've thought about it recently (hiking straight uphill to our tent the other day for example) but I hadn't really taken the time to live myself for it :D I love my hair!! It's never exactly the same color twice and I love to play with it.  I posted pics of it a couple weeks ago. I love my ability to see things from a different perspective.  (i also love that my teachers feel that way too ð) I love my geekiness and weirdness.  It's so much fun and I LOVE nerding out!!! I love my brain....even when I hate it.  My brain tortures me and makes me feel yucky sometimes, but it also shows me the world and lets me see the whole picture.  That's invaluable and will help me make the changes in the world that I want to see.   That's all I want to say for now besides thank you again, I'm so glad you're doing what you need to to be happier and in the process you made a whole bunch more people happy too!!! <3<3"

I've gotten a lot more self confident lately and I think I can pull them off.  Sorry, I'm not digging through dozens of pictures focused on male packages to show you... Do your own digging.  I can't stand types with tight netting because it itches and feels rough. That and it tends to chafe.  Currently I'm using a pair of board shorts until I can get the money together for a new pair. They're a little too loose and long enough to reach my knees, but that's become an annoyance to me.  As far as women's swimwear goes, I've never understood the strapless style except for strictly sunbathing. Or if you're an exhibitionist I guess. But aesthetically, I like the one piece bathing suit style that is just as open as a bikini. Which I just found out is called a monokini"

I had to get strappy ribbon put on 2 of my formal dresses in high school because the dress was strapless.   I just cannot get on board with the monokini style of things. There's just something about it.
randomactsofamazon,3c5ovb,Masterniles,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:34:41 2015 UTC,"I agree guys are extremely limited with swim shorts. You're either wearing long baggy trunks, loose baggy trunks or if you've got the confidence to pull it off tight fit either square cut or brief style.  The only woman I ever see wearing strapless are fairly flat in the chest or I hate to say it, but the ones who seem to want to go topless.  I'm not find of the string monokinis, but I like the style of the open belly and back ones that are closer to one pieces. String monokinis are a little too revealing for anything more than a private pool party in an extremely intimate setting."

As I've gotten older I've kind of popped out of my shell, but still enjoy being by myself. I also just got out of a relationship, one that I didn't want to end. I've really wanted to be alone but then I have this feeling that I'm missing out on something, and then I get lonely.   I find that bouncing around on Reddit kind of takes the loneliness away when I don't physically want to be around people."
randomactsofamazon,3c5twt,LongwaytoLA,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:01:02 2015 UTC,"It makes sense. See, despite the fact this woman was horrible to you, interaction with her on a near constant basis (I assume) was a social ritual of yours. Go ahead and think about all of the other daily rituals you have and imagine how hard it would be to break any one of them.  These rituals make up a perception of yourself- who you are, what you do. When those rituals are disrupted, your perception of not only yourself is changed, but your perception of the world and even your future. Until recently, THIS is how you interacted and existed within the world and it showed you a glimpse of your future. Now, that's changed, and uncertainty of your position and your future has your subconscious self grasping for that ritual so you can ""fill in the blanks.""  What you recognized was the world to you, and the future it presented, was basically going to be shit if you stayed with that succubus to be blunt. Now, you have to be careful with whom you decide to share and rebuild the intimate social aspects of your daily vicissitudes. Be cognizant of the fact you're vulnerable and don't rush it. Having social support will help, so lean on it until you find someone worthwhile to rebuild with. Good luck!"
randomactsofamazon,3c5twt,jbrake,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:50:29 2015 UTC,"What type of social interactions are easier or comfortable for you? Do you have a place you feel happy to be hanging out in regardless of who you're with?  For example I like parks and sometimes pubs, even if I'm alone or with my friends.  I like to just hang out and people watch/read/listen to music, if I find someone to talk to great, if not its ok.  Sometimes for me just being in social situations even if I don't socialise is enough to make me feel not as alone while being alone.    If this would make you feel more lonely disregard that and find someplace beautiful or that makes you feel relaxed and chill there. Sometimes just that act of leaving the house can have a profound effect on that isolated/lonely feeling.    Last but not least throw yourself into a hobby, if there's something you haven't been able to do but love doing then get back into it. Hope that helps and remember as you know you have a community and support system that loves you!"

Get you outdoor shoes/clothes/etc. ready, grab a pet if you have one, and just pick a direction and explore!   Take you time and enjoy everything around you - fresh air, bright sunlight, the interactions of people, insects, animals around you  Or perhaps you like physical activity? Try running or jogging with music you absolutely love and just get lost in the rhythm and beats and really find yourself.  Chin up and believe in me who believes in you <3"

randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,dnd1980,2,Sat Jul 4 12:52:11 2015 UTC,Something to do with that fact that I'm a moron I'm sure.
randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,2,Sat Jul 4 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"Or more likely a glitch in the system.. I can't get to my own wish list from here but apparently everyone else can so NO it wasn't you and you're NOT a moron, cuz I don't love morons ha-ha but I <3 you !!!"

randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,dnd1980,2,Sat Jul 4 13:09:39 2015 UTC,Good morning! You know every year after the fourth there are always stories of some idiot who shot their gun into the air and then someone else somewhere else getting shot because the bullet just doesn't dissappear.  Such morons.  Be safe out there today! If you are drinking please have a designated driver or use taxi or Uber or whatever. Just don't drink and drive please!
randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,Doctor-Kitten,2,Sat Jul 4 12:41:40 2015 UTC,<3 how are you darling?

randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,2,Sat Jul 4 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"Yea they're everywhere here, the idiots I mean.  I guarantee I hear more gun shots than fireworks tonight.. gotta love crazy neighbors smh, hopefully we'll be somewhere else watching the fireworks :)"
randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,dnd1980,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:56:43 2015 UTC,Yea it doesn't normally happen in my neighborhood thankfully. But the whole thing just baffles me. Why shoot into the air? That's what the fireworks are for. Do you just love your gun thay damn much? Well then great! You should know and love gun safety too!
randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,2,Sat Jul 4 13:04:54 2015 UTC,"Lmao, yes exactly.. GUN SAFETY, but down South they forget to teach that to all the good ole boys smh, at least it seems that way :)"
randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,dnd1980,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:10:54 2015 UTC,That's for sure. Although even though we're as south as you get I don't think we're considered the south. We more have stupid thugs and wanna be's with the guns I think.
randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,2,Sat Jul 4 13:22:03 2015 UTC,Where are you again?

randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,diemonkeys,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way with Skype.  IRC is easy, connect to server then go to the channel.  And most of the time links take you directly into the room.  You don't even have to register to use it."
randomactsofamazon,3c2j0y,IfuDontKn0wNowuKn0w,2,Sat Jul 4 14:50:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed!! I'll talk to anyone, we always find something in common :) and I don't have a Skpye account but I will definitely get one since you asked lol"

We're on the bus now to Cardiff, hopefully the place we are staying is nice, although it really doesn't matter as long as they have a bed and shower!! Camping was lovely!

And hubby even got me the souvenir ticket which comes with a t-shirt and some other goodies :D. I'll let you know how it goes later tonight.   We should have Wi-Fi so I should be able to be on later, if it's good enough, I'd love to get a cah game going if anyone's around ;-)  Love ya all <3<3 MrsSquishy!"

If it's that good I want to know more.  Is it a fairly recent show..somehow I missed out on all this..."
