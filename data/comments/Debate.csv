Debate,3e36ra,quickquestion1066,4,Tue Jul 21 16:37:48 2015 UTC,"That's kind of a compound between a lot of fallacies, but I'm not sure that it is one in particular. It is kind of a slippery slope, because it assumes that premises are true and applicable to an extreme. I think more what it is isn't a fallacy, but just a syllogistic argument with a false premise. ""You wouldn't have gotten a job if you were a woman"" is generally not going to be substantiated, and it's probably wrong. Both of the first premises in those examples are wrong, and the conclusion on the second doesn't even relate to the first premise. In conclusion, I'm not sure that it's a fallacy more than a false syllogism."

I've looked through lists of fallacies before and I've never found one that fully encompasses what I'm talking about, so it makes sense that it's several put together.

Debate,3e36ra,ralph-j,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"I think that would qualify as a Red herring:   As an informal fallacy, the red herring falls into a broad class of relevance fallacies. Unlike the strawman, which is premised on a distortion of the other party's position,[2] the red herring is a seemingly plausible, though ultimately irrelevant, diversionary tactic.  The expression is mainly used to assert that an argument is not relevant to the issue being discussed. For example, ""I think that we should make the academic requirements stricter for students. I recommend that you support this because we are in a budget crisis and we do not want our salaries affected."" The second sentence, though used to support the first sentence, does not address that topic."

We tend to get stuck in our niches and behaviors and terminology, and forget about the essence of debate. I would recommend trying to adapt to a different format. Specifically, I would try something like Parli or World Schools. The rounds are very dynamic and require analytical arguments more than evidence. I have found (as a PFer) that it is an extremely useful exercise to do those formats, because they are so creative and dynamic. You will also forget the 'formula--' the little things that you get stuck in with each style, and teach you a lot (or help you remember) what the essence of debate is, which is an argument. Take some time that you normally drill, and try a different debate. If a completely different style isn't for you, try an extemp debate. Pick a resolution or question, take 4 minutes to prepare arguments and blocks (it should be very quick), and do a 2 minute speech followed by 1 minute of cross-ex and then another 2 minute speech (each side).

American Parliamentary Style (which obviously isn't British, but is similar) actually discourages the use of evidence.   The NSDA has a series of Webinars on World Schools Debate, which is very similar in the theory and application. I think you have to be a resource package subscriber to watch them though."

If I think of an argument, the analytic part of it means it has to make sense logically and have the correct links proving why your assertion is true and the thematic part means the relevance of it to the certain motion."
Debate,3duyyf,Crisissss,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:51 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should reword that. The logic of a debate is often not presented-- 'dropped' arguments don't mean you lose, and underlying assumptions that are always there in American debate are largely absent. I shouldn't have said that logical arguments aren't present, because they are. What I mean to say is that evidence isn't used very often. In WSD and APDA, it often times frowned upon to rely on evidence (APDA actually punishes you for citing it). Consequently, you rely on analysis and very constructive 'common-sense' arguments, instead of relying on evidence. You are absolutely right that logical syllogisms are made, and that is really the only type of argument that can be made in debate (that and enthymematic). The 'thematic' arguments that I bring up are really just emphasis on themed speeches, themed narratives, etc. Judges want to see confident speakers reading long quotes, nice introductions, solid conclusions, and having a cohesive narrative about 'what the world looks like in the opp/prop world.' I should say that the speeches are more thematic than the arguments. Feel free to message me if you have other questions-- sorry that wasn't clear."

The resolution says that they would go to all African Americans. Anything else is a misinterpretation of the resolution. However, you can warrant reparations being needed with other injustices African Americans have historically faced, such as Jim Crow.   If the latter is so, in what fashion would the USFG be able to distinguish between those who were of slave descent and those are aren't?   As the latter is untrue, the federal government would not have to determine such a thing.   Also, where would the money going to reparations come from and how much would it be? Would you empirically go off of examples such as Japanese internment and the Germans after WWII?   In general, pro teams don't have to defend implementation beyond it being generally feasible. For example, if I advocated for an African-American colonization of Mars as a form of reparations, there would be grounds for a con team to call that out as unfeasible. However, if I were to propose subsidies for education or housing as reparations, I would only need to prove that it's a feasible idea; not propose a specific plan. Therefore it is unnecessary for a pro team to propose a plan based on Japanese internment and the Germans after WWII - it's not their job to defend specific implementation of reparations.

If the idea of giving reparations is because the USFG has committed injustices in the past and wants to make up for them simply making a piece of legislature doesn't do that. For example, if a black man couldn't get a job because people were racist and wouldn't hire a black man a proper reparation wouldn't be saying that in th future people wont be able to discriminate against him in regards to employment because what about all the lost wages due to not being able to get work which is why the monetary reparation is not only valid, but necessary. If 620,000 people died for the cause you're talking about a reparation isn't just saying it wont happen again but about repaying the loved ones of those 620,000 people for losing their family members due to the USFGs past because they lost in the past and telling them the future will be better isn't actually repairing their loss but simply preventing more of it."

There's actually a huge lit base on this. The fact that there were no reparations to begin with can be seen as a huge causality for high incarcerations rates, poverty, housing issues, and many other systemic issues faced by the African American community. Just because a problem is being faced currently doesn't negate the fact that its roots can be traced back over two hundred years, if not more. If you form a strong link from the present to the past I think the whole ""making a civil rights act or whatever doesn't make up for past injustices, it just prevents new ones from happening."" argument totally out of the water.

The difference is that they are not stating implementation procedures, which is why what the aff is advocating is not a plan. That makes it completely legal. Negating in a traditional sense means advocating against, but now neg advocacy has evolved to more alternatives, or even in some cases, kritiks.   You would have to find a tradeoff to giving to every race reparations, either it's not feasible, the USFG doesn't have a moral obligation to them, or frame the debate really well."
Debate,3dmide,DasnoodleDrop,5,Fri Jul 17 15:56:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, the aff isn't advocating a plan, but the resolution is specifically targeted towards giving African Americans the benefits of reparations. The neg can make the argument that giving just reparations can cause a racial divide because other minorities aren't getting the same treatment as African Americans, but the neg can't say that all oppressed minorities can get reparations by negating.   That advocacy necessitates a counterplan, because by affirming, at least some minorities get reparations, whereas when you negate, nobody gets any reparations.  To be more specific, by negating the resolution, a judge wouldn't give reparations to African Americans. Negating doesn't allow a judge to give reparations to everyone.   Think about it this way. A PF resolution is phrased basically as a statement you can answer yes or no to. The neg can answer ""no"" based on a couple of grounds:   The USFG shouldn't be the one paying the reparations Reparations to African Americans are harmful (cost-benefit).   Meaning that when you negate, you answer no, either because the USFG shouldn't be the one doing it, or because reparations cause more harm than good.  If you answer ""reparations should be given to everyone,"" you affirm the resolution as well as add in the portion in bold:  The USFG ought to pay reparations to African Americans as well as all other oppressed minorities.  In essence, because the neg advocacy requires an addendum to the affirmation of the resolution, the judge should feel comfortable affirming. At least that's how I see it. The neg can say that paying reparations to just African Americans is bad, but the neg can't advocate that because payment to just African Americans is bad, we should pay everyone. The judge can't vote based off of the fact that paying everyone is better - the judge must vote based on the fact that paying reparations to just African Americans is a bad idea."
Debate,3dmide,bryceps41,2,Fri Jul 17 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"An alternative is generally supposed to provide an advocacy other than that which the affirmative has put forward whereas a counterplan must show competitiveness, advocacy and implementation. Simply advocating for a new proposal, which is what the opposing team likely did and showing a tradeoff, or competitiveness is an alternative, which is allowed. Further, as you had said, ""A PF resolution is phrased basically as a statement you can answer yes or no to. The neg can answer ""no"" based on a couple of grounds:   The USFG shouldn't be the one paying the reparations Reparations to African Americans are harmful (cost-benefit) Or there are other ways to maximize equality, aka giving reparations to all minorities   The overall key is a tradeoff, if one can adequately show a tradeoff between giving reparations to just African Americans as opposed to everyone, that shows that there is an inherency problem and the judge should feel comfortable voting neg."
Debate,3dmide,DasnoodleDrop,2,Fri Jul 17 21:10:57 2015 UTC,"That makes more sense to me. I'm thinking that would fall under the second category though - because reparations to African Americans, while they would benefit African Americans, would harm overall race relations in the United States to the point of being irreparable in the long term, I believe the neg could advocate for that.  The way OP phrased his original post was that the neg team simply said ""instead of affirming and providing African Americans with reparations, negate and provide everyone with reparations."" The team that OP faced made this claim without any reason as to why reparations to just African Americans would be harmful, but instead solely said that reparations to everyone would be better.  Am I right in believing that sort of advocacy should lead to the aff team winning? Or is that a reasonable stance for a neg team to take?"
Debate,3dmide,bryceps41,3,Fri Jul 17 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised the judge voted against you. Did you explain why the con team would be affirming, or did you just say so?"

Debate,3dmide,thankthemajor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"I think the problem might have been that you adopted their proposal instead of treating it as irrelevant.

Debate,3dmide,mcctres,3,Fri Jul 17 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"You need to establish two things. 1. By affirming the resolution that does not trade off with reparations for other minorities.  If anything by setting the precedent by affirming that the USFG would pay reparations then in that world they probably would be paying for reparations to other minorities.  2. If they don't buy that you need to say look, other minorities may have had a hard time in recent years, but no group has literally been enslaved to such a great extend by the United States.  Thus, that establishes that if anything we should prioritize reparations to these individuals because they have literally been oppressed/taken from their homes and still suffer because of it."

Start at 75% speed then make your way up to 100% within a couple seconds. Otherwise you'll start at 110%, stumble drop down to 50% speed. Practice makes perfect. Don't expect to spread at 400 wpm out of the gate.  Read something familiar (like your theory file) for 3-5 minutes, then move on to more unfamiliar territory. I use the ""A,E,I,O,U"" drill. Start reading your first card and say the letter A after each word. On your next card say E after each word and so on.  You'll notice a lot of debaters sway when they spread. This is because it helps them form a quick consistent rhythm. Better to consistently spread at 300 WPM then 350 WPM with stumbles. Listen to some loud quick paced music while spreading."

Debate,3d126s,llamalord,2,Mon Jul 13 16:29:50 2015 UTC,"Good question!  You would need to know what their sample size is and where the sample came from. Can you get your hands on the questions asked because they can be biased and lead the taker to give certain answers. Also people often give the answers they think are wanted instead of their own. Or if this was something they had to opt in to take then they are more likely to give an extreme opinion one way or the other. Also surveys are a part of what we call quantitative data. They get the numbers that you can put on a graph and/or plug into a spread sheet, but they fail to get the personal side of the answers which is what qualitative data does. So depending on what is being argued you can always say 'Hey this survey may say X, but do we know what caused the people to think X? No. Do we know how the backgrounds of the people who said X? No.'  Do you know what kind of surveys they are citing?"

Debate,3czqea,Clusterfist,3,Sun Jul 12 06:40:14 2015 UTC,"This is why I don't like this topic. Being more responsible is hard to prove.  However, on your example, I would argue House is held responsible. Doesn't matter what his intentions, his actions eventually led to the situation at hand.   However, I realize that thinking has a lot of flaws. The first thing that popped in my mind about this topic is the butterfly effect: is the butterfly flapping its wings halfway across the world responsible for the tornado which eventually happens? If the butterfly is necessary but insufficient to the eventual outcome, is it more responsible? Is it responsible at all?"

Saying how irrelevant of the police giving protesters a reason to protest it is still the protesters who chose to do that. So they are the ones responsible. Also you can put how its the moral obligation of civilians to protest when something is wrong and link to responsibility. Or thirdly talking about how protesters do it to create change, and they shouldn't be denied responsibility for the change they create. Do we credit white supremacists for the end of the end of segregation? or the blacks who protested for it? Of course its the blacks, but then again to run that argument you have to show that responsibility can also be credit - an easy definition based argument."

However, I think a good way to spin the neg would be to say that yes, police are corrupt (again, there's a huge text/research base for this.) but it's the protestors that are causing the majority of the civil unrest currently, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. To give credit to the police for this would be discrediting huge social movements, largely driven by people of color (especially women of color.) And that the social unrest (even the rioting and looting, think of MLK saying it's the language of the unheard,) is absolutely vital to societal change and progression.

But, you should disabuse yourself of the notion that you need any more experience than what you have to do policy debate in college. Some folks join college policy teams having never done a debate round of any sort in their life. Camps (like the Arizona Debate Institute at ASU) exist specifically for training college policy debaters. I just, today, listened to the DoF from ASU (who also happens to be the director of the ADI) say almost exactly that very thing to a room full of high school debaters of all sorts. In fact, his best CEDA/NDT debaters from the last couple of years began their careers as LD'ers in high school.   There's no collegiate analog for PF. Even Parli, these days, looks a heck of a lot like policy debate (less time spent cutting cards, but the same general set of arguments). There's a good community for whichever type of debate you wind up doing, and it's a very rewarding activity. It's the next step in the process of becoming a better debater. Give it a try!

The people you meet all the way to the lectures that are given. Try to be as attentive as possible and take as much notes as you can. 2) days change through camp. A normal day was usually working in the lab in the morning, then either lectures in the afternoon or research, then usually practice rounds at night. 3) don't feel anxious.

Debate,3ci187,Clusterfist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:58:23 2015 UTC,That would be a fun topic except for one problem--I don't think the USFG even has the legal authority to legalize it in all 50 states because the 10th amendment of the Bill of Rights states that all legal matters not enumerated in the Constitution are to be left up to individual states.
Debate,3ci187,gcp04,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:22:56 2015 UTC,"Drug enforcement has developed into a somewhat concurrent power of the state and federal governments. Federally, there is the DEA, which has marijuana as a Schedule One controlled substance. Each state also has their own policies regarding Mary Jane: CO, WA, AK, OR, and DC have it legal recreationally. A whole host others have legalized medical weed. Most still ban it outright.  Under /u/clusterfist 's proposed resolution, you are right in saying that the feds could not change individual state policies (kind of; I'll get back to it.)   But it would get removed from the DEA controlled substance list, and people would no longer be sent to federal prison for possession, use, and distribution.  But the weird part is what happens when state and federal laws contradict, as they do in states like Colorado. Under the preemption doctrine, federal policy can nullify state policy when the two are in conflict and both levels have jurisdiction. So in a theoretical world, the DEA would override the legalized pot in Colorado. But the Obama Department of Justice has said that they will not take action against the legalizing states.

There is a huge difference between just protestation (may as well be caused by police) and the often violent unrest that we're beginning to see. Unrest which civilians alone are responsible for because, you can argue, they are directly responsible and bound by their own actions. Does that make sense?

Debate,3bp6fp,Argo4444,29,Wed Jul 1 01:01:37 2015 UTC,"From a coach's perspective: funding. Oh my gosh funding. Debate is probably the most valuable yet also the most underfunded and most undervalued high school activity I can think of, for a variety of reasons. From the time I spent as a competitor to my days as a coach I saw students excel in debate that came from all walks of life, from cheerleaders and other student athletes, to students where debate was kind of the only thing going for them. Meaning, it's one of the few activities there is that has a broad appeal that most students can break into, regardless of their background. Yes, there are a lot of issues in regards to private schools, being able to afford camps, what region you're in, etc. But the debate community itself is so diverse to begin with, that itself should be a huge selling point. So with that being said, I can't think of any other activity that offers you real world, applicable skills than debate gives you. Research (I can't stress how much this will help you elsewhere in life), critical thinking, how to give a professional presentation and how to be an effective communicator. What educator wouldn't want every student to participate in this kind of activity?   But the thing is, is that you can't really have a debate program without funding. That's why I don't coach anymore. It's simply unfeasible for me to do it on a volunteer basis. And it was unfeasible for my students to attend tournaments when they had to pay everything out of pocket. If debate was a part of school curriculum or part of extracurricular budgeting it would help the debate community exponentially."

If debate was a part of school curriculum or part of extracurricular budgeting it would help the debate community exponentially.   I've seen this happen to so many schools. Every time I went to a bid tournament between junior and senior year, I saw a school with a great coach suddenly lose funding and have their English teacher come along with them, not realizing what the coaching job entails.  In the state of Texas, they've also reduced the value of debate course credit so now there's an even smaller incentive for students to join; inevitably, they'll then start cutting funding and coaches. This would totally kill all parts of the activity, even PF- there's a certain set of styles that are effective, and underfunded programs lead to weaker debaters and less intellectual growth for the community as a whole."
Debate,3bp6fp,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,4,Wed Jul 1 10:57:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly! That's almost exactly what happened to my program and it's a damn shame. English teachers can be great substitutes for debate coaches, but in regards to those without any debate experience whatsoever, it's as if they're just acting as a chaperone and that's just not adequate, or fair to the students. Rarely do they understand the reality of the situation they're walking into and inevitably turn to parent volunteers, and that doesn't turn out very well, like ever. And then the program collapses.   The real travesty of it all is that debate also happens to be one of the most cost effective high school/college activities I can think of. It doesn't require a lot of equipment that sports do, activity related injuries are at a real minimum (granted I did sprain my ankle at a tournament one time, hahaha,) it requires less money to get involved on a basic level, etc. And you can even tie common core/STEM requirements into debate, making it even more appealing to an educator.

If you value, love and appreciate debate - let your administrators know, and have your parents say something as well.

That is to say, after reparations are paid, never realistically fixing all of the societal disparity caused by slavery, the public will see civil rights issues as solved. When activists come with ideas for change, the public would say ""sounds great, but you people have already been paid."" To use a slightly policy oriented term, black activists would lose political capital.  Another argument might be that reparations increase political entrenchment, which is what happens when different societal groups become divided and start acting as opposed voting blocks. This was the main political cause for racist policies in the post-15th amendment South; racist politicians knew that they could increase their power by oppressing the voting rights of the black voting bloc.   Reparations might worsen entrenchment by causing the appearance of racial division; white taxpayers paying black reparations.

Having done both debate (in high school) and Mock Trial (in college), I think the best thing to study here would not be a PF opening speech but instead a Mock Trial open.  You want to structure it like this:   Tell a story Explain the background Provide a framework (implicitly in this case) Systematically cover your burdens under that framework Pre-empt rebuttals Summarize and close with a call to action- an ""if you... then you must...""   So, for example, in the ""providing a framework"" part:   We have a moral duty to save lives and reduce human suffering whenever it is within our power to do so.   is a bit too explicit. It's something that makes the fedora-wearing-skeptic voice in my head go ""Who says?"" Instead, make it a hidden assumption, something like ""We need to look at this in light of our moral duty to save lives."" where your claim that we have a moral duty to save lives isn't the main claim of that sentence and becomes an easier pill to swallow since it's just an assumption you snuck in there.  I feel like you're also providing more pre-emptive arguments than direct ones- e.g., you talk about harmlessness of operations, how little a second kidney matters, etc., very early on when they're really just responses to counterarguments instead of arguments that build your case."

The assignment requires one of several specific format options - this one follows a ""comparative advantages"" format which needs 2-5 sections for key arguments. Also, there is a grade penalty for going over 9 minutes, so I might have to edit some of this out.) Introduction  [Opening] There are 3,000 convicted inmates on death row in the United States, who have been sentenced to execution by judges and juries. But there are over 120,000 other people who have been condemned to death by the federal government without ever having committed any crime at all. These are the patients listed on the organ recipient registry, who are forbidden by the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 from receiving an organ for which the donor has received any compensation.  [Topic statement] Today we will examine the reasons why it is time to repeal this morally abhorrent law, and legalize kidney selling.  Over three-quarters of the people on the waiting list for organ transplants are in need of kidneys, and the number of people in need vastly exceeds the number of donors. According to the American Transplant Foundation, another patient is added to the list every twelve minutes. Without a transplant, these people will eventually die of renal failure.  Most of the public opposes organ selling, but experts almost unanimously agree that it would be a good thing. A recent survey of professional economists conducted by the University of Chicago found that this is the issue with the highest degree of agreement across liberal and conservative economists. It is tragic that such a horrible problem has such a clear solution that hasn't been implemented yet, and learning about this topic was what inspired me to register as an organ donor.  [Thesis statement] Repealing the National Organ Transplant Act will benefit organ recipients and donors alike.  Section 1: Benefits to Organ Recipients  First, let's look at the benefits to patients who receive the organs. It is our moral duty to save lives and reduce human suffering whenever it is within our power to do so, and legalizing the sale of non-essential organs would be an important step in this direction. You only need one kidney to live, and the chance of long-term injury or death to the donor during a transplant operation is less than 0.04%. Losing one kidney makes no difference to the quality of life of someone who has two, whereas for someone who has no kidneys, it is literally a matter of life and death. The same goes for liver donations: livers are like starfish, and if you cut yours into two pieces, each half will grow into a new liver, so it's completely safe to give someone part of yours. However, these facts are only true for people who participate in legal organ transplants.  [Reason #1] The prohibition on organ sales has left a huge shortage of kidneys and livers. Over 90% of people on the current transplant waiting list will eventually die without receiving a transplant in time. Faced with this prospect, some desperate patients have no choice but to turn to the black market. These illicit organ transplants must be done in secret, hidden from government oversight, so they are not inspected by the established medical licensing authorities, and offer low standards of medical care. Before abortion was legalized, women had to go to shady back-alley clinics where the surgeries were performed by unscrupulous coat hanger thugs, leading to many patient injuries. If organ sales were to be legalized, transplants could be performed at safe hospitals by qualified doctors.  [Reason #2] There used to be a severe blood plasma and bone marrow shortage, but you'd never know it because there's plenty available now. If you go into the hospital tomorrow in need of a life-saving transfusion, you'll get one, but fifty years ago, you'd have died. How did we solve this problem? We let the Red Cross reward people for donating blood. Today, people are dying because of this organ shortage, because even though there are billions of people who have two kidneys and don't need the extra one, the law encourages people to do the selfish thing and let a stranger die. Hospitals are prohibited from offering to pay the donor's medical expenses for post-operative care, or even pay for their transportation to the hospital. We'd repeal any other law this deadly, but we haven't rejected this one yet? The waiting list size actually understates the real level of need. For example, the UK Department of Health has found that doctors in England are reluctant to even put a patient on the list if they think you won't survive the waiting period before you can get a transplant. And many patients are removed from the list or become ineligible because they have waited too long and their health has deteriorated past the point where a new organ could save them.  [Reason #3] The average time between being placed on the list and receiving a kidney is about three months. But that's only including the 10% of people who eventually get one. The situation is actually much worse, since the average person who gets placed on the list spends over three years waiting! According to the National Kidney Foundation, it costs $72,000 per year to keep a patient on dialysis, so not only must the patient endure three years of pain and suffering, the financial costs are enormous as well. In light of this issue, the government could instead buy kidneys from donors for $30,000, and then give them to the patients who need them most urgently. This would ensure that they are distributed fairly and do not simply go to the highest bidder. This will also cut healthcare costs by reducing the time these patients spend in the hospital: the kidneys will literally pay for themselves! If you're opposed to people selling their organs for money, we can instead pay donors by giving them free health insurance for life.  [Section summary] Thus, repealing the NOTA will make organ transplants safer, save lives, and be more cost-effective in the long run.  [Transition statement] And not only will the recipients be better off, but this change will benefit donors as well.  Section #2: Benefits to Organ Sellers  It is often claimed by opponents of organ selling that if this practice were to be legalized, the poor would be unfairly exploited. The reality is that the poor are the group most harmed by the prohibition on organ sales.  [Reason #1] The rich are the only people who can afford medical tourism. They can fly to other countries to get organs on the black market there, whereas the poor have no such luxury and are stuck on the waiting list. Since they also cannot afford the same quality of medical care, they usually die before the transplant arrives (the average wait time for a kidney is over three months, and only the rich can afford dialysis for this long). Similarly, Steve Jobs famously circumvented the system by having houses in many states, which let him get onto multiple waiting lists and then get an organ from the fastest one. The poor obviously can't buy houses everywhere whenever they need to get treatment. And legalizing and regulating the organ trade in the United States will eliminate most organ trafficking in third-world countries.  [Reason #2] People often argue that poor people should not be allowed to sell their organs, because then they will be forced to undergo these dangerous procedures at risk to their own lives because they desperately need the money. But this argument is unreasonable because poor people also do other dangerous activities for money, such as taking jobs as firefighters. If it is exploitation to pay them to save lives by giving their kidneys, then it is just as exploitative to hire them as firefighters: according to the National Fire Protection Association, a professional firefighter has about a 1 in 4000 chance of being killed in a year of work, which is about the same as your chance of dying when you donate a kidney. But this is not exploitation - firefighters are heroes, and so are organ donors. And there is nothing morally wrong about compensating them for their bravery - in fact, it would be wrong not to do so.  [Reason #3] Finally, donors ought to have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. If they want to sell their kidney, liver, hair, sperm, or eggs, they should be allowed to do so. These are very safe medical procedures and it's not our place to tell them they can't. People are allowed to smoke cigarettes, go skydiving, or get plastic surgery, which are risking your health just because you felt like it, so why not be allowed to risk your health to help someone in need?  internal summary  Conclusion  [Still need to write this part.]  Let's not leave all these helpless hospital patients on death row.  Save a life: sell your kidney. Thank you."

Debate,3bbzfe,pfdebater123,4,Sat Jun 27 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"Imo this is ultimately a question of what being responsible for an action means. You can argue that although the protesters may be justified, they are still responsible for their actions. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just depends on how you interpret responsible. The actions of the police justify the actions of the protesters, but the protesters are responsible for their own actions because they chose to commit them. A lot of this is going to come down to using a good framework for moral responsibility."
Debate,3bbzfe,xwjitftu,2,Sat Jun 27 21:46:22 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, but I don't think that really resolves anything. My understanding of your framework is some rule like this:  ""An actor is responsible for the effects of any actions he/she commits regardless of whether or not the action is justified.""  Let us say, protester violence = X Police brutality = Y  Under your framework, Protesters are responsible for X. But the police are ALSO responsible for X (it is an indirect effect of their actions).   Protestors are responsible for X. Police are responsible for X+Y  if X>0 and Y>0, the police are more responsible for the violence than the protesters.  One could attempt to make a distinction between direct effects and indirect effects, modify the morality framework to say something like: An actor is responsible for the direct effects of any actions he/she commits regardless of whether or not the action is justified but not responsible for indirect effects.  But the bright-line between direct and indirect effects is unclear. You could try to make a similar distinction between ""intended"" effects and ""unintended"" effects, but again the bright-line is unclear."
Debate,3bbzfe,xwjitftu,0,Sun Jun 28 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"I might attempt to use a framework for moral responsibility that takes into account agency. You're assuming that causing something makes you responsible for it. I would argue that though brutality was the reason for the unrest, the protesters had the free will and agency to pursue another course of action. They didn't, and are thus responsible for their own actions. Your discussion about the brightlines is interesting but I think a reasonable brightline would be that an actor can only be responsible for the effects of actions if there was no room for other consequences. For example, if I make fun of your art and you become Hitler, I'm not responsible for the Holocaust because your free will introduced an element of uncertainty - other results could have occurred. On the other hand, if I push you in front of a train which damages the train, I'm responsible for the damage because there's no other way that situation could reasonably have gone. There was no element of free will in between my action and its consequence."
Debate,3bbzfe,pfdebate123,0,Sun Jun 28 18:57:56 2015 UTC,"It seems to me like you are proposing a distinction between ""forseeable"" effects an ""unforseeable"" effects (again establishing a bright line is problematic but for sake of argument let's assume we can distinguish between the two). I don't think this resolves anything. The question becomes do we consider protests a ""foreseeable"" consequence of Police brutality. This point needs to be debated, but I think pro probably wins the argument that protests are a foreseeable consequence."

Debate,3bbzfe,Clusterfist,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. Yes, you can use the steps outlined above to show the connection between police brutality and the existence of protests but that's not the same thing as the police being responsible for the existence of civil unrest as the resolution says. Maybe police are more responsible for the protests taking place but in no way are they necessarily responsible for unrest, as you can argue that those actions are carried out by civilians and only they can be responsible for their own actions."
Debate,3bbzfe,Slash_Bane,0,Sun Jun 28 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"You're discussing a concept called an infinitism. But is it really the police officers fault? Really you could blame their parent, since if they didn't exist then the police would not have been able to create the protesters. Or really you could blame their grandparents, or great-grandparents. Or we could just blame the Big Bang, or whatever religious creationism you believe in.   The point being: arguments that rely on ""but x wouldn't have happened if y didn't exist"" contain a huge logical fallacy. Don't blame the messenger kind of thing. For example, if Fox News reports that a terrorist attack has occurred on the U.S. homeland, and Americans decide to go off and kill every middle eastern, is it Fox News's fault? They were just reporting the news. It's really the fault of the people who physically killed the people.  From what I understand, this is the basis of deontology (correct me if I'm wrong LD'ers). Morality is based off the intention of the action rather than the consequences, since any consequence can occur and no actor can prepare for them all. In this sense, the police were doing their jobs (or some of them not really) and can not be held accountable for the actions of protestors."

Debate,3bcxxi,pfdebate123,2,Sun Jun 28 21:45:13 2015 UTC,I disagree. Reperations for African Americans is a specific policy measure which has been proposed a number of times in the past. The civil unrest topic hinges on the abstract assignation of blame.
Debate,3bcxxi,SuperSharpShot2247,2,Mon Jun 29 01:21:31 2015 UTC,"Two quick notes:   Reparations involve a historical argument regarding the culpability of white Americans in the longitudinal suffering of African Americans since colonization began in North America. Whether or not it should actually be implemented is contingent upon both the assignation of blame and if today's inhabitants bear some sort of cross-generational moral burden. If anything, that is an abstract discussion worthy of a nuanced philosophical debate. In short, some policies are more rooted in abstraction than others. Civil rights unrest isn't as abstract as you might think. There is a significant repository of evidence--much of it statistical--that indicts both protesters and law enforcement agencies for the current state of race relations. It's a very ""cause and effect"" topic that is worthy of Public Forum debate.    I will concede that some topics in Public Forum are more philosophical than others. ""Developed nations have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change"" is an example of this (2012)"

How many defining characteristics must change before the parties will agree they're using the same word for distinct things?  Are they a ""true Christian"" if they also don't believe in the Bible?  How about if they believe in the bible, but consider Jesus to be allegorical and not literal?  Are they ""true Christian"" if they're a so-called ""Christian Atheist""?

Maybe my first comment was too general, what I'm trying to say is that the debate risks getting too logistics-oriented when definitions and all of that other implementation stuff gets involved. It seems to me that the best debating will happen when teams step back from the 'how' and focus on whether or not reparations are the correct way to address the issue.

The bottom line is that these are not topics we can look at and figure one is better.

TL;DR: Don't blow this post off"
Debate,3ayx2h,Argo4444,5,Wed Jun 24 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"I still disagree. I have said it in other posts, so I will say it again.    1) Serious wording problems within the resolution that will make for terrible debate   I think the wording is great. It is worded to be a fact round, which is good for PF. Moreover, there is a slight amount of vagueness, but nothing a good definition cannot fix. It additionally allows you to discuss civil unrest that is not specifically black lives matter, unless you want too. Furthermore, the resolution places no moral judgement on either side. You do not have to argue over the ethical ""good"" or ""bad"" of protests or cops. The resolution is merely looking at cause. I think that is a perfect wording. It lets students explore a variety of topics relating to a serious issue in the States. The only issue I see with the wording is the word recent. Recent is difficult to define, but I don't think it would be hard to argue that recent means since Zimmerman or recent means the Civil rights movement. Both of those are educational.    2) Bad Topic literature   I have no clue where you are getting this from. There is literature on either side. There is a ton of info on both racial reparations and protest/police culture.    3) Way too confusing for incoming novices. (I'm coaching the new debaters on my team, and the police topic is going to be an absolute nightmare. I assume that on a national level, this may be everyone's experience as well.)   I don't see how this is a confusing topic. It seems fairly straight forward. Who causes the civil unrest? My kids at camp, novice and varsity, understand the topic well. They get what is going on. Are tough conversations being had about race in the United States? Yes. But I would argue that is a good thing.   My main issue with the reparations topic is the lack of a plan in public forum. I cannot say we are going to give $1 to every African America. What does that mean? That means that economic evidence is worthless. There is a huge difference between a $1 reparation and a $1000 reparation. You could try to calculate a standard reparation, but if you were worried about a source/definition war with the police topic, the reparations debate would be worse.   Since the topic can't look at economics, it becomes hypothetical. Thus, we must look at the moral/ethical obligation of reparations. I think that this becomes a much more difficult debate to be had. This might be a good resolution for policy or LD, but for public forum, a good fact debate is needed. The police topic does that, and you don't have to be inherently racist on either side since you are not debating the goodness of the protests."
Debate,3ayx2h,Thornwell,-3,Wed Jun 24 18:32:39 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about the wording, but for the reparations topic too. How much reparations? We talking $1 or $1,000? Which African-Americans? Undoubtably some African Americans have no relationship to slaves, or a people who came to America from Africa, similar to the Lost Boys of Sudan integrating into U.S. society. What is the definition of African American? Recent debate over trans-racial people excluded, there are many races who live in African countries and immigrate to the United States. For example, a large portion of the South African population is white. Do we pay them reparations?   This is all besides the fact that the reparations topic will be heavily biased. Some judges have a vested interest in voting pro, even if the debate is hypothetical. Rephrase the topic to, ""Resolved: a portion of the population should be given free money"" and a person can see why that select population would say yes 100% of the time."

Issues surrounding defining African-Americans as well as the issue of how much is to be paid are feasibility questions the neg can use and also just implementation questions that their is tons of literature for. They aren't problems with the resolution. The distinction in terms of wording with the unrest resolution is that, as opposed to this resolution which is just a cost-benefit analysis (do this or don't), the unrest resolution is asking us to say who is more responsible for an extremely complex, confusing, and muddled issue that cannot be clarified in a PF round. For example, are police ""more responsible"" for inciting unrest or are protesters ""more responsible"" for actually carrying out the unrest? This not only a. leads to an insurmountable and muddled definition debate, but b. makes for an extremely unclear round on the whole. Novices need a clear resolution to start the year with."

Both deal with highly sensitive issues that deserve more than just a debate round, and many people who do a lot of research on the topic likely won't remain engaged with the issues after the last tournament in October. ""Almost the entirety of the judging community just so happens to be White."" - In my district, local tournaments can be upwards of 80% Asian-Americans (Indian and Chinese being the largest population represented). Around the country, Asian-Americans, especially Indians, are disproportionately represented in debate. Yes, in some districts, judges are mostly white. In others, there's a large black population.

Even though the term ""African American"" never comes up in the resolution, ""recent civil unrest"" and the inclusion of police as a weighing mechanism tie the topic explicitly to race relations. Trying to avoid the intended topic by discussing some other protest would make the negating team far less persuasive.  Both these topics are connected to race and social issues, so assumptions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 apply to the first topic if you change a few words.   Toes will be stepped on no matter what topic is selected.

This topic has the entire summer + 2 months to get it covered. There's no better time to discuss a topic that needs to be researched as heavily as a race topic. Also, I don't agree with the idea that just because you're not black you can't internalize the ideas behind reparations, and you don't really state your reasoning behind this so I'll just leave it at that. I'll combine 2 and 3 because they're both about debaters using evidence to skew their views. Personally, I find that in most situations, "" totally unique"" arguments aren't usually as succesful as debaters that choose to pick a major issue, really develop and flesh out the argument to give it some depth. Also, I think literature abuse would happen on both topics, regardless. It happens on every topic. I don't think that's legitimate grounds against this topic; it's more of a protest against ethics in debate.   You make the argument about tokenizing, but under that standard, should we never discuss any topic? In order for a person to learn about race, do they have to learn about it for the rest of their life? I think that just having an introudction to race in the United States is a good thing. Most kid's probably wouldn't get this education otherwise. Some will be interested, some won't. I just don't see how this could be bad.  As a side note, do you feel ok with policy and ld discussing race? They've been doing it for years, and I'm sure some debaters take the literature out of context.  I'm wondering, do you have an issue with race being discussed in debate?   I don't think you've thought this through if you think white guilt will win this debate, or that lay judging is inherently unfair. There's plenty of arguments that reparations will harm other minorities. Also, bias is present in every topic, and lay judging as well. Do you honestly think people aren't as, or more, biased about topics like gun control or environmental protection? Learning to deal with biases and lay judges, and learning to adapt, is a skill that debaters should learn. It's a good thing. Race is something that's discussed in the real world; learning to discuss it in the context of debate can be beneficial in learning how to deal with it.   I also don't think that most judges are white, or that would be a bad thing in and of itself. My judges are usually pretty diverse, but I don't know why someone being white would disqualify them from being a good judge.   I didn't really understand this argument. I don't get why 45 minutes is too short. Like, how long is ""long enough""? Why is it acceptable to discuss race in policy and ld, but not in PF? And I really don't get why first-hand experience is needed to talk about a subject. I don't need to talk to a gunshot victim, or be one, to understand the suffering.  You also kind of menioned how people will ""act like experts"". Honestly, no one in their right minds would take a high schooler's opinion in a truly serious fashion. I really don't see that as an issue. Imperialism I don't this appropriate here. This topic doesn't just affect a third party, if reparations were to happen, basically everyone would have to pay taxes for it. But let's assume you're right; does that mean we should never have topics about groups that aren't present? No topics about the middle east or china? I don't think that talking about a policy that will affect a certain group is imperialistic; it doesn't explot them in any way, or create some kind of power imbalance.   Main Point  I don't think you really made a case as to why the other topic is any better. I think the reparations topic is going to be much less biased, because it's less current, as well as being more educational, because it deals with ideas of equality and justice, with good literature to back it up. The protests topic deals with causality and blame. Both topics will tackle race, but I think the reparations topic will handle it better.  edit: sorry, reddit formatting is kinda odd, so the numbering is off"

Remember that distortion of the discussion harms all participants, and then remember that the fact that my opponent even advocates for it in this response. This not only reinforces the harm, but also is an attempt to make it legitimate.

Honestly, no one in their right minds would take a high schooler's opinion in a truly serious fashion. I really don't see that as an issue.   Flow my impact on misappropriation and miseducation through the round and you're going to vote for me right here because the education of discourse from debate is the biggest single impact you create in any debate round. Miseducation of the participants is thus the ultimate harm because people will further miseducate others. It outweighs on scope.

Every topic has a concept of degrees of separation that make certain types of discourse acceptable to certain degrees because it is socially acceptable to talk in a certain fashion depending on how removed the situation is. Because race is so close, and because the genuine possibility for participation by the African American sect is completely possible, but because the demography of debate does not allow for it, that is what makes this imperialism. Remember that there are better platforms for discussion that include the minority such as through primary education systems and others. But even then, remember that imperialism is not exploitation but the extension of power of one entity over the other. Discussion of ""what to do with African Americans"" while not including them in the discourse is the definition of such.   As a side note, do you feel ok with policy and ld discussing race?

But realistically, that's just not gonna happen. Providing massive amounts of genuine exposure to the legacy of racism  to high school kids would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible. I think it's better that kids are forced to take an academic approach, and look both sides of this issue, rather than go through their life with their only discussions about race being inside their small, personal, social bubble.   This response is really poorly fleshed out. You say that it occurs in almost every topic regardless. My point is that for it to occur with this topic is disastrous. Furthermore, non-uniqueness does not make it less of a harm. It just means the harm occurs in other areas as well. Even so, my specific point, once again, is that this harm in particular is bad. Furthermore, turn this response because the fact that it occurs on both sides only makes the matter worse. In response to the point about the other side, remember that I specifically tell you that I'm not making an appeal for the other side.   Alright, I'll make a different argument. Even if a debater goes and tries to make unique argument on this topic, they still have to go through the basic literature to understand the topic. That's already more of an education than most debaters would recieve regardless. Second, the norms in debate, especially speaker points, check debaters back from being overtly racist. That kind of check might not exist in their social circles where these discussions would otherwise take place. Third, I think it's important that if deabters do make offensive arguments, they should be brought out. Debaters should learn what is and isn't acceptable. Basically, yeah, debaters might skew the topic, but I think the educational benefits are more important.  Lastly, if you're not defending the alternative resolution, then what are you advocating for? Honestly, we just have to choose the one that's the best, and if you're arguing for the sake of arguing, it seems kind of pointless.   Remember that if the discussion is bad, the education is also bad. If misappropriation does occur, then you harm the discourse at the same time as you educate the participants. Remember that there are alternatives and better implementation to a cold and non-intro'd PF topic as grounds to discuss race and that these alternatives are far safer, but that once you open the door for these people, the initial impression is the lasting one. I outweigh on probability because the majority of alternatives or safe implementation of racial discussion create greater benefits than cold, unintroduced education.   The reason the education won't be bad is because they have to defend both sides. There aren't better implementations of where this discussion could happen. I've never seen classes discussing modern racism in high school, and in college, only in very specific majors. Otherwise, social circles are unpredictable. Public Forum debate at least forces you to be open about your sources, ideas, reasoning, and forces you to look at both sides. This is the best alternative. Give me on better example that has a better way of discussing races that also looks at both sides. At least this initial impression literally can't be biased, because you must defend both sides.   White guilt might not win the debate but misappropriation of arguments occurring in this debate in particular is singularly harmful. Remember that distortion of the discussion harms all participants, and then remember that the fact that my opponent even advocates for it in this response. This not only reinforces the harm, but also is an attempt to make it legitimate. Remember that this is the definition of desensitization because it is the appropriation of emotion as a backdrop to justify turning an issue like race into a high school competition.   The wording of this is kind of confusing so I might be misunderstanding. Basically, I think you're saying taht people are going to use emotion to guilt trip people? Fine, you can do that on literally every topic. Healthcare? Appealing to people dying of cancer. Terrorism? Appeal to the poor children that die from our drone strikes. Debaters need to learn to deal with these arguments, because it'll happen in the real world too. The benefit of debate is that every participant and judge will be subject to multiple rounds, so the impact of emotion will be drowned out. The kids are also forced to read literature, so even if they use emotion, they'll still be forced to understand the logic behind it.   Flow my impact on misappropriation and miseducation through the round and you're going to vote for me right here because the education of discourse from debate is the biggest single impact you create in any debate round. Miseducation of the participants is thus the ultimate harm because people will further miseducate others. It outweighs on scope. But it also outweighs on magnitude because it is the promotion of bigotry and the concept of exceptionalism through exclusive reading of literature as exposed to exposure that fuels this.   I really don't understand why you're using jargon like extend and outweigh. We're not debating to win a ballot, I'm genuinely trying to have a discussion. I'm not gonna address a full paragraph of jargon.   Every topic has a concept of degrees of separation that make certain types of discourse acceptable to certain degrees because it is socially acceptable to talk in a certain fashion depending on how removed the situation is. Because race is so close, and because the genuine possibility for participation by the African American sect is completely possible, but because the demography of debate does not allow for it, that is what makes this imperialism. Remember that there are better platforms for discussion that include the minority such as through primary education systems and others. But even then, remember that imperialism is not exploitation but the extension of power of one entity over the other. Discussion of ""what to do with African Americans"" while not including them in the discourse is the definition of such.   I think the standard of ""social acceptance"" that you set is too vague and unreliable. 20 years ago, it would've been ""socially unacceptable"" to talk about things like LGBT rights in America. It's just not clear how this standard applies; some African Americans do debate, I've met plenty. How much seperation do we need before it's acceptable or unacceptable? Where is the bright line? Under this standard, it would never be clear what we could debate.  This isn't a discussion of ""what do we do with African American's,"" it's a question of what are African Americans due? It would be akin to asking, do seniors deserve social security? Do the sick deserve healthcare? If we can debate those without it being imperialism, than I don't think this constitutes imperialism. We're not extending power of one entity over another.    The whole point is that PF Debate is an improper platform. I'm not familiar with the other formats so I can't really speak on either of them. I think a discussion on race, when properly conducted is great, but when introduced in the fashion that the NSDA has seen fit in this case, I don't think as much. I'm not sure how race was introduced into either LD or Policy though, so you're going to have to excuse my ignorance here.   I'm not overly familiar with LD or Policy, but I have a general idea, but I'll just defend PF. Basically, PF is a good platform for this for the reasons I stated earlier. The alternative platforms don't force you to look at both sides, to look at your own reasoning, to have a broad understanding, to be open about your sources, and to be subject to a variety of different arguments. Classrooms, social circles, etc, all lack those benefits.   ***Sorry, there might be a ton of typos, its kinda late and I don't type that well."

It's a fascinating question that's actually relevant, while the first topic forces one side to take an incredibly unpopular and potentially racist stance.   If I was to hear two months of debate on a topic, I'd prefer it to be the deeper one."
Debate,3awfr7,Jfqian,7,Wed Jun 24 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"Well said. There are major problems with how vaguely this resolution is worded. The idea of assigning blame for unrest to either police or protesters if extremely unclear and confusing considering the police themselves incite protest often but the protesters themselves are by their own actions perpetrating unrest. These are very confusing waters for novice debaters to navigate. 2015's PF novices should start their year with a clear, balanced topic. People aren't necessarily leaning towards the unrest topic though. CBI is using the reparations topic."

Debate,3awfr7,Zeus1325,-4,Wed Jun 24 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"The reparations topic is worse. The points you bring up are the reason why to pick the police topic. I think it is great to have to define recent, responsible, and civil unrest. There is a ton of evidence about groupthink and protest culture. Any good teams wont be using foxnews anyways, so I don't know where your concern is.    The police topic isn't even centered around a general trend, but rather many occurences, which means each case needs to be evaluated individually.   The most frightening comment. What are you talking about?? You could easily do a google search and find out about the black lives matter movement. There is no reason to have to debate individual instances. The wording of the resolution is talking about the civil unrest on whole, not just singular events.   Moreover, I have no idea how public forum will quantify reparations in any meaningful way. Since there are no plans, economic evidence is thrown out. There is a big difference between $1 and $1000 reparations. This means that we have to look at the moral justifications of it, to me that is a much more boring round. These are just opinions of us reddit pundits though, so I suppose we have to wait until the vote comes in."
Debate,3awfr7,Thornwell,3,Wed Jun 24 04:42:07 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're trying to get at by saying ""civil unrest as a whole,"" but under that interpretation how would anyone be able to negate? The negative would literally have to say that protestors are somehow responsible for civil unrest because they're protesting police brutality. Either way the topic is bad because if you view it under your interp its extremely aff skewed"
Debate,3awfr7,Thornwell,-3,Wed Jun 24 05:13:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is that aff skewed. I think an arg saying protestors are purposefully protesting could be convincing if you define civil unrest as things like nonviolent protests (laying in the street, blocking roads) then you link it to the same logic used in the civil rights movement. There's tons of theory on nonviolent protest politics. You don't have to be a racist unless you want to be. At first glance, it seems aff bias, but I think neg args can be equally convincing.   Edit: if you were too scared to debate police brutality, you could even be vague about what police are and talk about any U.S. Agency that polices (NSA?). That's certainly farfetched, but I've seen crazier."
Debate,3awfr7,Christiangruz,2,Wed Jun 24 05:33:27 2015 UTC,"Plus, if the purpose of public forum is for topics to be ripped from the headlines, the police topic is more suited to what public forum is supposed to be."
Debate,3awfr7,Jfqian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:17:17 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but even if teams use supposedly unbiased sources to argue that protesters are the reason why unrest is happening, judges will automatically take a stance. As a coach, you should know that.  I also don't buy the ""many occurrences"" argument, since most pf topics force people to analyze more than one thing.  Quantification is easy to bring into any topic. It's still a moral question, and you can easily use numbers to back up your arguments. If you think public forum shouldn't discuss ""moral justifications,"" then skip debate and become a math major."
Debate,3awfr7,Thornwell,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"I just mean quantification of reparations. We can quantify all sorts of things, but without a plan, we have no idea how much the reparation will be. So unless you have a source saying the USFG will specifically use this economists reparation plan, then you have nothing.   This turns it into looking at the ethical considerations of reparations. I love a good ethics debate. Hell, I even think we should probably start accepting pseudo-K's in PF more, but the thought of a bunch of high school kids discussing who is black and whether they are worthy of government reparation just seems like a good syllabus for racism 101, especially given the primarily white demographic.  On your first point, I get that judges be judges. That is inevitable. However, I do think there are ways to say the protestors are responsible without saying the protests are bad. I would even encourage my students to say the protests are good, but that doesn't mean the protestors didn't cause them. Does that make sense? The mere question of who caused what doesn't force a question of right or wrong. In fact, that question is totally irrelevant to the debate."
Debate,3awfr7,Jfqian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"The resolution doesn't specify amount, that's correct. Regardless what amount is provided, both sides will still be on equal footing. The lack of specificity doesn't exclude evidence, either. If anything, it lets more statistical evidence be topical, and forces debaters to weigh impacts.  I think you'll see far more racism 101 with the police topic. It might not say ""African American"" in the resolution, but it is explicitly tied to race, both in framers' intent and by discussing police brutality.   There might be ways to talk about protesters without being a bigot, but there are far more ways to discuss reparations. I suppose it's not really a right or wrong question, but it forces debaters to argue that protesters are the ones responsible for unrest, not police, which is incredibly problematic."
Debate,3awfr7,Thornwell,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"You cannot have impacts without a plan. If you tell me, According to Mr. Economist, a $1 reparation will cause 1B in debt. My response, how do you know the US will do that? You don't. That is the fundamental flaw with any econ arg for that resolution.   At the point where you have to define african american, it becomes almost impossible to not be racist. The police one is better. It prevents you from having to discuss moral obligations, while also letting you chew on a bit of a huge issue facing the United States."

Debate,3aqt0t,lbt86,12,Mon Jun 22 19:30:15 2015 UTC,I can already feel myself getting judge fucked on that first one.
Debate,3aqt0t,sean585,20,Tue Jun 23 02:27:50 2015 UTC,I'm glad I graduated. Both resolutions force teams to assume the position of bigot. That's not cool.
Debate,3aqt0t,AlbertMax,11,Mon Jun 22 19:42:09 2015 UTC,tbt to  the Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act topic that made left-wing high school debaters say that voter fraud is a serious issue and Voter ID laws are good lol  Still managed to have some really really good debates on that topic though
Debate,3aqt0t,jameshues,3,Mon Jun 22 22:34:21 2015 UTC,"Back in Texas where that kinda stuff was allowed, I ran a CP that said that the decision was justified bc it allowed a more strict preclearance formula to be passed."

Debate,3aqt0t,tattermandelion,6,Tue Jun 23 04:33:15 2015 UTC,Okay this comment doesn't deserve to be downvoted. I had the exact same reaction myself. CPs are a definite no in like 95% of the PF world
Debate,3aqt0t,jameshues,2,Tue Jun 23 10:11:52 2015 UTC,"You're projecting your own personal biases and ideologies onto this. I see nothing in either resolution that shows bigotry as endemic to either side. If the resolution was something along the lines of ""Resolved, blacks are inferior to people of other races"", I might see your point."
Debate,3aqt0t,Mnemniopsis,2,Tue Jun 23 06:09:56 2015 UTC,How do these resolutions do that exactly?
Debate,3aqt0t,EverybodyWantToBall,2,Mon Jun 22 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"Two things are blatantly obvious: first, civil unrest is a response to hundreds of years of white supremeacy and institutionalized racism; and, second, reperations will never be enough to even slightly mitigate the aforementioned status of American society. That being said, attempting to promote equalization is probably a good thing. Saying that the power structure isn't soley responsible for prompting civil unrest seems ignorant and bigoted. Who are the real violent terrorists - the class of individuals demanding respect and dignity, or the system that originally approached the black body with violence?"
Debate,3aqt0t,AlbertMax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that you understand what the words ""bigot"" or ""bigoted"" mean. I would say it is bigoted to dislike a group of people for who they are. Opposing reparations is certainly not an intrinsic expression of dislike for African Americans, because there are African Americans who oppose reparations and because one can oppose reparations on a host of perfectly reasonable grounds, like economic or political ones, for example. It is even more obvious that saying it is not the police, but protestors, who cause civil unrest, is not bigoted, as this is clearly not an expression of dislike for a certain race of people, given anyone can, and indeed many different types of people do, protest. Perhaps the words you are looking for are ""ignorant"" or ""uninformed,"" though I would disagree with the usage of these words as well."
Debate,3aqt0t,EverybodyWantToBall,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:33:05 2015 UTC,Same. Unfortunately I may have to help teams prep on one of these topics.

Debate,3aqt0t,pfdebate123,7,Mon Jun 22 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"Some of them were bad imo. For example, I wouldn't have liked gender equality for the same reason as I don't like these choices. Also entitlement programs and medical ethics could have been annoying, while arctic development or emerging areas of conflict could be cool"
Debate,3aqt0t,rowrkinky,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:46:15 2015 UTC,"Gender equality? Where did you see gender equality? If it's the income inequality topic area that may be the disparity between the rich and the poor, not men and women. Did I miss something?"
Debate,3aqt0t,Toastytoastcrisps,18,Sun Jun 28 21:09:49 2015 UTC,Good luck to all the debaters still in high school. You'll be hearing the word 'ignorant' a lot.
Debate,3aqt0t,Clusterfist,4,Mon Jun 22 21:02:57 2015 UTC,"Neither Con side is forced to bigotry or ignorance or racism... For the first topic, one can argue that reparations entrench racism into institutions by following politicized (along racial lines) logic. Furthermore, one can argue on the con side implementation and logistics as Aff can't propose a specific plan and ""reparations"" can literally be anything.  For the second, one can define ""responsible"" as civic/criminal responsibility so that any people participating in civil unrest are bound by their own actions and there are no excuses for ones actions, so that by definition they are responsible. After all, one of the biggest equality movements concerning such issues was peaceful (without the more violent sides of civil unrest, which is a very broad category including riots, protests, rebellions, strikes). Police brutality is a huge issue across America and incidents of it have not increased over the past several years (CNN). Media has politicized the issue, making it harder to resolve. The simplest reason why police brutality exists is because a huge percentage of officers (75%, according to one trainer) join the force to hold ""more power"" over the citizen (i.e shooting guns, arresting people, driving fast, promoting racially charged agendas etc..)   Both sides have much to debate and some very interesting arguments. Hopefully there won't be too much of ""You're racist"" kind of stuff. A prepared defense for such remarks is necessary, as I most definitely know most everyone in the debate community is not racist."
Debate,3aqt0t,Dababy345,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:37:07 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in that 75% stat, could you link me please?"
Debate,3aqt0t,Slash_Bane,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:09:10 2015 UTC,Ill see if I can find it. I read it on my iphone several days before the topics were released so I did not note the article down. But it is written by a police trainer who worked with around 3000 people if that helps.
Debate,3aqt0t,Dababy345,7,Tue Jun 30 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"I'm in favor of the first resolution, for a couple reasons.  1) I think that the second resolution is more clear cut and harder to run a legitimate con case on, especially since it very politically charged.  2) I think that the vagueness and open-endedness of the first resolution expands the domain of the debate. Debaters need to question what the brightline on reparations is, and I think that adds into the multidimensionality of this resolution.  3)  Are reparations for African Americans mutually exclusive with reparations for other minority groups? Intuitively no, but government spending is a zero sum game, so money for reparations for African Americans necessarily comes out of another budget; hard to prove a tradeoff tho.  4) Will the monetary aspect of reparations be explored? It's hard to weigh money vs. justice...  This being said, I dislike both resolutions and I wish the NSDA would reconsider their choices."
Debate,3aqt0t,pfdebate123,3,Tue Jun 23 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"On number 3, I don't think so. You could give reparations to both black who are descendants of slaves and Japanese-Americans who are descendants of those in the concentration camps."
Debate,3aqt0t,MetropolitanVanuatu,3,Tue Jun 23 02:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm curious as to whether debaters will frame it as an opportunity cost. However, your position is certainly correct, as there isn't a fixed budget for reparations and there really isn't mutual exclusivity."
Debate,3aqt0t,pfdebate123,2,Tue Jun 23 02:29:18 2015 UTC,"Some definitely will frame it as an opportunity cost, but I will discourage that when I'm prepping people out because it's hard to determine precise costs, even harder to determine the opportunity cost, and harder still to properly argue it in most cases."
Debate,3aqt0t,MetropolitanVanuatu,4,Tue Jun 23 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"I feel as though the debate concerning the first topic choice centers on whether or not the US government should pay reparations for slavery specifically, so would the wording include those African Americans who are not descendants of slaves? If it depends on the definition and usage of 'African Americans', then debates could get very muddled in my opinion"
Debate,3aqt0t,hawkeyes459,7,Mon Jun 22 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"It doesn't talk about slavery specifically, you could instead say African Americans deserve reparations for other forms of systemic racism perpetrated by the government. For example, forced relocation, etc."
Debate,3aqt0t,rowrkinky,7,Mon Jun 22 20:11:25 2015 UTC,There are a myriad of extremely valid examples of racism in the status quo that don't hinge on being a descendant of a slave. I don't think that slavery has to be assumed in this resolution.
Debate,3aqt0t,EasternZone,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:40:24 2015 UTC,The first one seems like a topic that if you vote neg you instantly become a jerk. Idk I'm just thinking of that in a parent judge's eyes since I mostly go to lay tournaments
Debate,3aqt0t,32rahul,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:36:14 2015 UTC,completely agree. this is worse than the food security topic for LD. the second one is also very polarizing.
Debate,3aqt0t,We_Are_Grooot,-8,Mon Jun 22 20:05:14 2015 UTC,I know that's how I dropped at districts because of 3 mom judges and since its food security guess what they voted... Surprise! They voted AFF
Debate,3aqt0t,32rahul,2,Mon Jun 22 20:10:10 2015 UTC,"that's why you have to turn the aff. ie if all of these ""just"" gov'ts try to ensure food security, it will strain our already resource depleted world. So if just gov'ts were to actually ensure food security, it would only make food insecurity worse"
Debate,3aqt0t,Bioprospecting,-2,Mon Jun 22 21:42:51 2015 UTC,Ya I know how to debate but lay judges do have a certain bias already before the debate.
Debate,3aqt0t,32rahul,5,Mon Jun 22 21:51:33 2015 UTC,That's why it's your job to change that
Debate,3aqt0t,Bioprospecting,-1,Mon Jun 22 21:55:00 2015 UTC,I completely understand that and I've done it before. I'm just showing the one example I've had that food security has done bad to me and explaining it since the PF topic seems to have a similar skew. It's just a thought
Debate,3aqt0t,32rahul,2,Mon Jun 22 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's an awful pf topic, but you can turn it too. It's more of a kritikal res. All you need is to prove that the government is racist and would only worsen tensions."
Debate,3aqt0t,Bioprospecting,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:29:26 2015 UTC,kritikal  All you need is to prove that the government is racist and would only worsen tensions.   Good luck convincing parents about that.

Debate,3aqt0t,pfdebate123,2,Tue Jun 23 12:54:18 2015 UTC,no it was just a prediction based on what camps have picked in the past.  and i'm referring to the civil unrest topic.

Debate,3aqt0t,hawkeyes459,2,Tue Jun 23 17:24:18 2015 UTC,Are they prepping the second because they want it or simply because they already prepped the first one when it appeared on the 2014-15 list of potential LD topics?
Debate,3aqt0t,db8dinosau,-5,Tue Jun 23 12:26:18 2015 UTC,"I like the second one best. I think it has a lot of ground on both sides. You can even debate both sides without being a bigot too! Moreover, when I judge, my rfds will get to be nice and long as I explain the world to the silly, ignorant kids."
Debate,3aqt0t,Thornwell,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"""explain the world to the silly ignorant kids""  You are the worst kind of judge"
Debate,3aqt0t,Neetoburrito33,4,Mon Jun 22 21:35:56 2015 UTC,"Nah, Probably the best. I know debate theory well and I am tabula rasa unless you are racist, sexist, or otherwise offensive. I can't help that the debate community is filled with people who think it is ok to say offensive shit. I wont put up with it, and frankly, I think it is fun since I am in the South and get to watch these kids get actually educated from a debate round and a good RFD. The only reason you think I am the worst kind of judge, is probably because you say offensive shit and get dropped.   The first topic forces you into the black debate, which I don't mind, but others apparently do. The second topic however, does not have a bias unless you are too blind to see past ""OMG racism in MURICA"". There are tons of ways to run the resolution without being offensive, and still provide valid, thorough defense of your side.   I would mainly worry about lay judges, that being said, I always tell my kids to worry about lay judges. I get that you want to downvote me because you're scared of the res, that's fine, but just like another comment says, all you're doing is projecting your own biases about the resolutions on the other commenters. Additionally, if you are so afraid about talking about black people, the resolution never limits the debate to the black lives matter movement. You could easily make other definitions and really talk about any ""policing"" agent and any sort of protest. Civil unrest is super vague."
Debate,3aqt0t,Thornwell,0,Tue Jun 23 05:42:30 2015 UTC,"Nah, Probably the best.   You're not the one who can make that kind of a call."

Debate,3agt3e,d3b8r-,21,Sat Jun 20 01:17:27 2015 UTC,"Here's the funny thing about debate. It's a mind game. Winners act like they are winning no matter what. Your wins and losses in debate weigh heavily on your attitude. I see it on my own team.  I have this debater. Disorganized, doesn't care to learn structure, doesn't care to learn theory. But every time he hits a 'good' team that well known he tells me 'Coach I'm not worried they're trash.' And he's not, he really isn't because he thinks like a winner, and he acts like a winner.  And half the time he wins. I have another debater who is brilliant. Goes to top camps, knows theory, very organized, good speaker, but he gives into the name hype. And every time he hits a big name he loses. And he brushes it off with 'Well it's them coach what was I supposed to do?""  And I tell him that names mean nothing only arguments do. But I get it. It is easy to say what you are saying and think the community is at fault. Some teams are just good. Some times a team with a flawless record can screw up. A room can throw a debater off their game but that is an excuse. You want to be #1 you need to own that room, not be owned by it. You need to shut the room up with your crossfire strat not be laughed at for it.   And hey I've been that judge that dropped the big name team. I've been yelled at by coaches for it, and hugged by teams I have given my ballot to for it. I've also voted up those teams because they were impressive, won my flow, and acted like winners. The middle reason is the only reason to vote for them, but the other two sure does make my job feel better.  Your post forgets that judges are human and those of us who debated know how you feel. Trust me I remember. But I also know what it is like to be on the other side of the room and have two amazing teams that could go either way on a single argument, and it is damn hard to make the call when you know both deserve it. I try to do a lot when I judge. I try to make sure everyone feels comfortable and is having fun in the round. I try to be open to any and all arguments, and encourage debaters to run their craziest stuff for me. I try to be fair with my ballot. I try to be clear with my feedback. But the one thing I do not do is to make the popular team win. I don't think most judges are like that."

But, in short, the analysis is wrong.  Good debaters are, in some ways, a lot like actors or salesmen. They learn to read and play their audience. They aren't just doing random shit, they figure out who these tactics work on and who they don't. That's why they get away with shit that ""lesser teams"" wouldn't. It's not just some kind of magic with regards to their stature, though that's also part of it.  And, watching great teams debate, you definitely see a big difference between them and worse teams. It's largely confidence."

Debate,3agt3e,stonedshrimp,12,Sat Jun 20 13:47:44 2015 UTC,"Well said, and I agree with nearly all of it. One point, however, is on the rudeness in crossfire. In the finals earlier today, the second cross was a little snippy. Yes, it was rude at points, but there were other jabs that were perfectly legitimate.  I can sympathize with having everyone in the room be against you. At UoP in fall 2013, my partner and I defeated a team from a large private school in a bubble round. They were not happy with the result. They, and some of their teammates, proceeded to show up for our rounds the next day, and were then joined by the teammates of another major private school team who we had beaten in quarters. In our semis round (the bid round at UoP), there were about 30 or so spectators in the room. All of them were on the side of the other team, who wasn't even affiliated with the other schools we had beaten. During my speeches, one of the people in the crowd, a very good debater in their own right, tried to throw me off by essentially making funny faces. It didn't work, and we won the round, but I will not forget that feeling. It was a feeling of not being wanted, but knowing that we belonged. We ended up becoming friends with the teams we beat in the bubble round and quarters over this past year, and they're good people.  The lesson, if there is one at all, is this: people will sometimes hate you for no apparent reason or just because you beat them. That makes them petty in that instance, but does not make them a petty person overall. Trust that most people are good, and most people want to have good competition, and you'll come away with a good outlook."

Debate,3agt3e,Christiangruz,5,Sat Jun 20 17:18:35 2015 UTC,"I debated for a pretty large team on the national circuit a few years ago in PF, and I coach/judge today. I'm going to make a few comments:   Hype isn't exclusive to top teams, and is something you have to learn to deal with.   In a debate round, there will always be an imbalance, kind of reflecting life. It might be sophmores vs seniors, or circuit teams vs local teams, or whatever. This is a part of debate, and honestly, a part of life. It's important that debaters learn to focus on themselves and their effort as opposed to their opponents ""rep"".   You made this comment about how debaters might get in room support. Fine, but that's usually because they know how to control a room, which takes skill. Being able to crack jokes, and have the audience support you is a skill you have to develop. Look at Falmouth GM (Kyle Griegel and Michael Norton). They were the only circuit debater from their school, and yet they won a ton of tournaments and were excellent. No one in outrounds supported them ""by default"", they had to build that support through what they did in the round and how they debated.  You also have to realize that every team that has a rep now, had to get there as someone that didn't have one. I used to think of kessler and urda as being OK but nothing special in their junior and sophmore years.   Hype doesn't affect judging as much as you think it does.   This is especially true in PF. Lay judges, many college students, and coaches, don't follow the circuit like it's some kind of drama. They have more things going on in their lives than just debate, or they just don't know/care about competition. The hype around certain teams is honestly centered around a pretty small community of people who actually care.   Plenty of good teams are nice people.   I think when you make the comment that Whitman AA is condescending, you're letting your own perceptions color what you think of them. I've met them, and see like pretty normal/nice kids. When I debated, there was a top team that just had my number all season, knocked me out of out rounds in like a bunch of major tournaments. I didn't like them, I saw them as arrogant, and then I graduated. I talked to them a few times afterwards, and like, they were pretty chill. Sure some debaters are arrogant, but it's also not exclusive to top teams. I've seen terrible teams that were horrible and arrogant.    The problem with ethics is a seperate issue.   I agree with this problem, but I think that has to do with people prioritizing winning over everything else as opposed to teams being good. Lots of regular/bad teams do this as well.  I think you're giving too much weight to this ""elitist culture."" It's really not as significant as you're saying it is."

I do other extracurriculars besides debate, and each has their hierarchies and people that they 'worship'. Someone below said that it happens in all aspects of life, and it does. But I have never seen it to this extent.       I sat in on PF finals round at nats, and it was a really enlightening experience. All of the people around me were talking straight crap about the Dougherty team, saying that they didn't deserve to be there and how Whitman would ""rape"" them. (yes, rape) The worst part was Yik Yak. Most people couldn't see it because Yik Yak is specific to geography. It was BRUTAL and 10x worse than the Nats15 app. There were so many remarks that were sexist, racist and just plain rude. Nobody deserves to be treated or talked about in that manner. It was completely public and people unaffiliated with the tournament saw it. This is such a bad reflection of the NSDA. When they announced that the decision was 9-6, people started laughing. Everyone was so surprised that they picked up 6 ballots and had won a decent amount of the panel. I felt so bad for the Dougherty girls; they had worked hard to qualify, break and get to finals at nats only to be treated as a joke by the debate community. Something needs to change. Everyone can't win the TOC and everyone can't make it to finals at nats. So when unfamiliar faces make it to these big rounds, we need to celebrate it. I'm not talking about giving everyone a participation medal and singing kum ba yah, but we need to support each other in our successes, our failures and our general forensic endeavors.

They are not immortal and don't deserve that blind following. Respect yes but never the kind of obsession that exists now. Like I have to remind my students and prove to them sometimes they do. It themselves, rankings and tournament record doesn't mean squat if you can look beyond it. Teams that have been unbeatable or had one major tournaments have come up short this year. We have seen upsets in the past and we have seen underdogs pull through not just in debate but in sports. It happens all the times which means they should never psyche themselves out. In reality though THAT isn't the disease debate has. That isn't even close. Let's be frank when someone mentioned the master suppression techniques earlier, I don't think anyone bothered to look at when it is typically employed or used. It's mainly used to humiliate and ridicule. That bothers me. It really bothers me because they sure did that and no one seems to notice that it is a recurring issue and no one seems to address it. The behavior the original poster meant is that we all just condoned unprofessional and really immature and CHILDISH behavior. It's the type of technique that I hope the majority of us HATE seeing from our politicians because it doesn't really lead to much constructive debate. And that happened in this round by the ridicule of how the debate turned out."
Debate,3agt3e,rumv87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"2 of 4 This round I will admit was sloppy and but argumentation wise I think the negative really had them beat in the fact that the affirmative dropped all the responses against his contention on the affirmative and not just any arguments but TURNS and I would say pretty good ones too as they were examples of how minority opinion,   minority groups in particular, lose the ability to even talk about really important social issues without completely erasing their identity and the very issue itself. The example of how the only way women can do any work online anonymously to avoid harassment makes it difficult for women to not only actually get credit from society for their contributions and for those that want to create discussion about disadvantaged groups online where it's suppose to be a space for more progress on issues of democracy and equality cannot do so because of harassment and jut straight up intimidation and no regard for that person's identity. I think the first part about not being able to be taken seriously as a women because a women cannot identify whatsoever online as a woman because of fear of being bombarded with traumatic photos is pretty damning in my opinion and the fact of how aggressive and just condescending and dismissive they were of Dougherty is enough for me to say the ballot should have gone neg. If teams are losing for conduct if there is truly and honor code, if there is truly to be education and discussion I think perhaps we should make sure that the decisions that judges make balance all of that out and I think that this time a lot of the aspect of education and he ability to discuss serious topics as this is truly a sensitive topic and I'd say the topic itself was kind of an example. All I know is that I don't know any debate I have ever seen where a team drops a straight turned argument. If someone could tell me why in public forum that would be otherwise that would be great because I think that argument itself showed a deficiency of the first amendment protections that exist on the justification that they would protect minority groups and encourage discuss about minorities not only in the form of unpopular opinion like communism or labor rights but even groups that WERE EXTREMELY discriminated against or ""unpopular"" but continue to receive less than equal treatment or respect (popularity) to be treated seriously and be an equal on any sort of playing field whether you consider debate as a game, a form of education, a form of dialogue, especially political dialogue or like a lot of the literature on both sides actually used which was discourse, you'd realize at the fundamental level almost in most paradigms that should have been a win but perhaps that's not how everyone thinks. I am just truly bothered by that sort of behavior and why we truly do continue to condone it at every aspect of this activity still. This popularity and the complete dismissal of a teams form of argumentation and the feeling of being called anti-something is bothersome. I believe someone mentioned something shady extensions and how all teams including elite teams this happened in this round. If anyone is going to tell me they did address the issues of the offense on minority speech I would say no. For those obsessed with stats and How's it's proof. They had them.  11% decrease in women involvement in online discussion or discourse. DROPPED. on the basic issue of the ability to create political dialogue or discourse to lead in progression in democracy or even under framework of good governance, isn't the government supposed to protect the people, the whole people? Isn't that why they said whistle-blowers are important. They protect others. But a minority whether online discussion in general about issues minorities face on a daily in regards to discrimination and stereotyping, or whether  we are talking the purpose of the government being protecting the Public, that really isn't happening because these folks cannot whistle blow you could say and they are not always protected in some forms of retaliation under the argument of antislapps or slapps at the core of certain court cases filed under John doe and dealing with certain violations you could say that you could bring as a grievances to court (like workplace discrimination like sexism or racism which were examples also from the minority group,) some individuals would lease some form of their identity that makes them easily identifiable to the person who is asking for their identity in court, that leads to some forms of extra judiciary retaliation that you could say is not necessarily addressed just by a mere dismissal of the case. There are other costs that they do not recover they never address the issue of attorney fees that these people have to pay because let's not kid ourselves these John does probably have to pay for them. Furthermore sometimes these minorities like women and people of color sometimes are literally the minority as well as politically in the sense that they still are being discriminen against and they sometimes when bring up issues of legality regarding issues of discrimination that minority groups like women deal with daily, these groups just by trying to do so and believe that it's truly protecting them but it's not. It has prevented the enforcement or good governance of certain laws like work place discrimination."
Debate,3agt3e,rumv87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"part 3 of 4 No team told me why governance of simple money which by the way was missing in my opinion from the final focus as I don't think I heard those numbers in the last speech (someone correct me if I'm wrong)  but when the arnesen are saying good governance is what is most important in my mind I'd say that at its core anonymity does not do that on a lot of issues including at the theoretical core for the reason why the protections existing including the publications of the federalist papers or publius or the other various examples that judges may or may not know or the debaters may or may not have been referring to. Or just simply at the logical reason that many think the idea or protection exists is also kind of the justification the courts gave on the original rulings that each team may or may not have been referring to in that contention that went dropped. I think there is no way any team especially as the affirmative can recover from that. I feel like that argument covers many judging paradigms and I don't see how that could have been ignored especially since it was conceded not a simple piece of defense was extended nor was there a clear justification for why it should not be evaluated because like I said if you were a flow judge which many of these folks in here climate to like and claim to debate like, I don't see how anyone could think they won. I think should have been the other way around and by that margin I don't think you can give me many reasons why a team who wins offers on one contention from the aff shouldn't win. Does no one get that the arnesen own case says there are balancing scales and they say that perhaps the current protection from the first amendment aren't enough and that we need to build laws. They avoid the negative who I do believe questions them as to why the current laws don't currently protect anonymous whistle-blowers. They don't provide a proper explanation for how they currently do unlike Dougherty who actually provides I believe a few times that it was because of the Commerce Claus. I do think that that takes out a lot of the affirmative offense or claim that anonymous whisteblowing blowing value or impacts are protected in court because of the fundamental right they conceded by their own logic it can and purely be for good governance which can come from and be promoted from other parts of the Constitution. Especially something like monetary."
Debate,3agt3e,rumv87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"4 of 4 The arnesen don't even try to properly engage or even provide a clear explanation in my opinion of any sort of defense on the minority opinion argument and why their suppose clear extension which were actually non existence in the rebuttal as well as not even an actual direct refutation of the statistics or reasoning and impacts of anonymity on various political minority group as interpreted literally by the first amendment like the publication of political groups and the ideas of democracy but also the practice of democracy can be hindered smoke and I think that the negative showed that in reality it's doing more than good at its core as a theory and in practice. In practice the protections of an action like whisteblowing can only be protected so much but unfortunately for many individuals they lose too much from just speaking out and can and has had a chilling effect especially groups like women. I do not think that's ever discussed and I think at its core that is a lot of offense AGAINST affcase. I think that you do not need to be a flow or lay judge to understand that dropping offense on the first contention was enough in my opinion to vote against them considering the lack of framing and comparitive analysis byut both teams. If people are doing work for the Arnesens to win the round, I do not see why the same should not apply to DV as they had straight turns dropped right out of the rebuttal. If someone disagrees I'd like to hear.    Also apology for the lack of spacing. I tend to just go with the flow of what I think. I am also typing this on the phone on our way back to California. Please keep the discussion about all the sensitive issues discussed here or else If I ever find out who ever you are I'll make sure I have a talk with your coach, school administration or district.

Even ISD worships the Arnesens in their social media posts.  Identical twins closing out TOC with AZ is very amazing, but in a way that it's easy to obsess over it.  Throw in another TOC win and their recent victory, and there's no wonder why people worship the Arnesens.  Did I mention they're IDENTICAL TWINS! I didn't watch Dougherty's rounds except for finals, so I don't really know that much about what they are like in round.  I've heard some nasty things that seemed exaggerated at first, but after watching their second speaker's pre-rebuttal speech and and the team's move to race-based arguments, I didn't seem that surprised by allegations that they yelled at an opponent and called him sexist.  Again, I've barely seen them debate so I can't make a definite conclusion that confirms or denies some of the worse things about them said on this subreddit.  Dougherty was definitely interrupting Whitman in crossfire, and Whitman got cheeky with Dougherty in crossfire.  Although I understand why people might be upset with Whitman, they act the way they did for laughs, while Dougherty repeatedly interrupted Whitman to delay them from asking and answering questions.  I don't believe Dougherty deserved to win because they were lossless up to finals.  In any round, the team that out-debated their opponents is the team that deserves to win, and I honestly believe that Whitman debated better in that round.

The only offense I have Whitman going for is on their C2: Whistleblowers, and MK showed that whistleblowers lose their anonymity with slaps, so there's no net benefit to trying to protect it, in fact it's a net harm b/c the impacts are conceded in the con case. Then both C1s are dropped, and even if they weren't, there was no weighing on either side or even any clear impact framing so idrk what I'd do with it if I took them into account. Then if there were any doubt in my mind, con argued that minorities' lived experiences influence people and laws better than if they were anonymous on the pro C1, so there's more con offense.  Overall, I thought Whitman kept going for arguments that were already responded to, e.g. corporations lose slaps 92% of the time when NK said that winning doesn't matter because the anonymity is lost, or C2: slaps means we expand the first amd protections when NK said that expansion doesn't make sense because if the first amd said what pro said, then we wouldn't need new laws in the first place.  Curious as to what y'all think.

Then, as schools w better debate programs can afford to send a lot of kids to each tournament, their debaters can scope out the field much more rapidly and thus prep out any small team, accelerating their advantage.  Thus kids from smaller and.poorer schools are cyclically excluded from outrounds which ultimately whitewashes the debate community. Backlash against this is what lead teams like emporia (?) to win both national tournaments some years back using black narratives, as they were able to convince the judges of this bias iirc."

They say stupid shit."
Debate,3aben2,JaggerStapp,22,Fri Jun 19 21:43:13 2015 UTC,"I'm reading this and I just want to say something.  Dougherty Valley MK may not conform to your style, they may be terrible debaters, they may run unfair arguments, they may not have succeeded, and they may have killed your family.  And yet, the fact that you have the audacity to come onto a forum which is supposed to enhance the communal aspect of debate and do your absolute best to defame a team that has rightfully won their spot in the final round of public forum is worse than anything Dougherty could have ever done.  The question you have to ask yourselves is: even if everything you're saying is true, and their actions are visibly illegitimate, why are they in finals? The majority of judges here (especially late elims) are traditional: they don't vote on spreading or accusations of homophobia in cross ex.  They vote on presentation and they vote on the flow.  And the fact that Dougherty is the only team that was UNDEFEATED in elims at this tournament is representative of the fact that - maybe you're wrong, maybe they really are winning these rounds.  Because by definition, in order to win a debate, you need to convince judges to vote for you.  And as the last 14 rounds (excluding their bye in round 15) have shown, they are doing that.  That being said, we have seen that Dougherty was/is not the best team in the past.  But I will say this.  They are damn good on this topic.  Maybe not the best, but they are good - good enough to have rightfully won the ballots that got them where they are.  Here's the point - if you think Whitman will win, as many do, then good.  And even if you want to publicly state that you are rooting for Whitman, as many are, go for it - I can't stop you.  But if it takes undermining every single aspect of another team to justify who you are supporting in the finals, then keep it the fuck to yourself.    Remember.  Finals are a debate like any other.  And debates are won by teams who convince judges - if they made it this far, they're doing something right.  The fact that you can argue that anonymous defamation is harmful on your con case and then come onto this subreddit the same day and do just that is probably a sign that what you're doing is wrong."

If they deserved the ballots on this topic then so be it, that's truly awesome and hats off to them. But the point of a forum is to share opinions. Presidents get criticized by people who shouldn't even be leaders of the neighborhood watch. Unfortunately, this is reddit, not ""letsmakeeverybodyfeellikeasuperstar.com"". If someone states that they don't believe a team deserves to be in finals, that's ultimately just their opinion, and it's an opinion they have the right to share on any public forum. I highly doubt that Dougherty is going to see this thread and say ""oh look, people don't like us, better give up!"". They'll probably take it instead as a reason to be better debaters, as I'm sure you did when people said you were just a freshman.   tl;dr; these are criticisms that people should be allowed to share on reddit.

Honestly, I didn't believe they'd be in finals either - but I just feel like the reason why we should prefer a respectful dialogue regarding the situation is because most of the examples of Dougherty's past successes/failures are irrelevant.  When I went to watch a couple of their rounds here, I was so surprised - but they do have a grasp of the topic and they have been winning these rounds not off of the shit they did in the past, but off of convincing judges.  I'm not saying I think they'll win, nor am I denying your right to say that you think they'll lose.  But if you're gonna make a point, keep it respectful (""[Dougherty's] appearance in the NSDA Nationals final round is a disgrace to public forum"" is probably unnecessary if the only intent is to express opinions on who one thinks will win) and think it through.  Some of the points made are that Dougherty did bad/unethical things at tournaments before this - and this probably explains why they didn't do so well at these tournaments.

Now I understand that the perception of our team is a bit tainted which is WHY we took actions to sanction the member of that team who acted dishonest in round by not allowing him to compete at the first bid tournaments of the next year.  the fact that now YOU are accusing MY OTHER debaters of being cheats is incredible. The FACT that we NOT only qualified in a league that NOT only uses the pilot rules (which are stricter than the current district rules let alone National tournament rules, look them up so you know what I am talking about) which Nationals will probably adopt in a few years , is hypercompetitive (we compete against Leland, Presentation, Harker, St. Francis, and Nueva) AND judges tend to call for cards at pretty much ALL of our local bid tournaments, I do not think you can equate Mission San Jose KS or MY team as a whole as a cheating team. I can assure you that KS and the majority of our teams during the year upheld the integrity of the activity. I can also assure you if you look at the larger sample size of events this year, we won the majority of our rounds fair and square with the only EXPLICIT incident of evidence integrity being compromised being at the National qualifier and earlier at the Presentation invitiational. At both tournaments, the teams responsible for the actions were reprimanded and their parents notified. The team that unknowingly used the edited file at Presentation was not punished but the team providing it was punished and was forced to apologize to the tournament director and the rest of the staff, they were also not allowed to compete at one of the bid tournaments after Presentation as well as had a discussion with their parents about the issue. We also found that MULTIPLE teams from various schools were using evidences from questionable websites. This is why I remind my students to check the stats to see if they are too good to be true by seeing if they can find another source referring to the same statistics.  Overall I think that you should not talk about a situation you probably know nothing about. Again I understand the perception argument, its the reason why the Patriots superbowl win is in question, the Cardinals reputation is tainted now, but the facts are that if you look at the individual records of our teams, they are not cheats and their record at tournaments show. Freshman do not make it to the finals of Stanford AND Berkeley with questionable evidence.

Debate,3aben2,HotCurrySwagYolo,5,Fri Jun 19 06:46:40 2015 UTC,"sorry but how do they make you question the ethics of Public Forum debaters? is this merely an attack at the misrepresentation of evidence by debaters which sadly is something that teams besides Dougherty do year in and year out? If so, I think you have no right to direct your anger at just them. Direct them at the lack of uniformity of rules for evidence in debate. To me it seems like you need to provide some context for your comments because right now you sound like the typical privileged debater. So please check yourself or provide more information to this. To me you just sound salty. Not very classy."
Debate,3aben2,rumv87,0,Fri Jun 19 06:08:59 2015 UTC,"No, misrepresentation of evidence is understandable and unavoidable. Attacking someone personally by degrading their character by telling them they don't care about women is not ok nor ethical. Worse so, is calling an individual a homophobe. They don't know anything about that individual and have no right to belittle another debater purely to win a debate round."
Debate,3aben2,HotCurrySwagYolo,4,Fri Jun 19 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"again what was the context of what caused them to say such things. maybe they perceived sexist or homophobic undertones in your responses. whether that was intentional or not, if you are not gay or a woman, its hard to notice them. Watching them in rd 14, even some of the judges made some pretty ridiculous and sexist comments to them. For example to YOU if you are man (not sure if you are but I will assume so if they called you sexist), being told by a man to smile more, even in the context of debate, is not only degrading but sexist.   again I do not know the full situations of both of those rounds but I do not feel those are issues of ethics. I doubt the majority of  judges (whether at the local or circuit level) vote on them as much as they do in policy of LD. This seems to be an issue of conduct and maybe professionalism if it was truly baseless.   an issue of ethics would be cheating and doctoring cards, clipping cards, hacking someone's computer for their evidence, etc. simply calling someone ""names"" which is essentially what you seem to interpret this as, is not an issue of ethics in the eyes of most judges including myself."
Debate,3aben2,rumv87,-1,Fri Jun 19 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe ethics isn't the right word. In the context of Public Forum, yes, they are not breaking any ""rules"". I merely recalled my experience where they attempted to gain ground in a debate by verbally abusing an opponent.  Full context:  They argued that globalization caused human trafficking, specifically women.  We refuted this point by  1. Pointing out that their evidence said nothing about globalization, only that trafficking was a problem.  2. We whole-heartedly agreed that trafficking was a major issue especially for women in developing nations. However globalization improved conditions for women within those nations. both are pretty stock responses. They asked to clarify on these points, and when I did, they followed up by asking if I thought trafficking was bad. I said yes, obviously. Out of nowhere, she screamed the above quote. It was so loud and forceful the judge visibly recoiled. (A policy judge who in the RFD said that the yelling was definitely excessive and unneeded). So, unethical? depends on the definition of ethical, which is a debate that does not belong in a Reddit Thread. Rude and disrespectful? I think so."
Debate,3aben2,HotCurrySwagYolo,4,Fri Jun 19 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"I can see the rude and disrespectful aspect because that happens quite often, our teams have dropped rounds for that very reason (whether they agree its a valid reason to lose, I do not care but its a fact that it happens and its something as debaters they should be cognizant about). but as a matter of ethics especially in the context of debate where norms and rules are established, this justs seems like a matter of conduct which as we all know if it was a prelim round, can be punished with low speaker points. I have seen it done against my teams, I have seen it done against others in my league as well. but yea, that sounds like something that was completely uncalled for if this is everything that happened. were the cards you used on the globalization topic the ones that states that it gives them the ability to get better jobs which prevents the need to go into human trafficking or being forced into it? From the soudns of it, yea it was probably a bad argument if the links were not properly there. Our teams never debated them but having heard this argument from other teams, I think that the response given against human trafficking are not really sexist. I think some of the best answers to it were good as they point out that it can get rid of the necessity to go into prostitution or whatever in order to improve yourself economically.   In general though, debaters in PF seem to have this problem of getting overly aggressive and I think its something definitely all debaters should be aware of, they should definitely avoid it as much as possible ESPECIALLY if you get the type of reaction from the judge as the one in that round."
Debate,3aben2,rumv87,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"Debate is a game. I am 100% sure they only said that with the purpose of winning. Sure, it's a cheap strategy, but it's ridiculous for you to take it personally."

Debate,3aben2,We_Are_Grooot,3,Mon Jun 22 00:22:06 2015 UTC,"Ok so I wanted to make something clear. My understanding about the team's decision for Dougherty's opponent flipping aff was incorrect, they flipped aff due to knowledge that Dougherty strongest side is aff and had a great case they were winning on. I hope to clarify that as I don't want people to insinuate anything about their opponents being discriminatory in that round. That one judge on the other hand..... That was a little on the unnecessary side."
Debate,3aben2,rumv87,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"There was nothing stopping you from making the exact same claims.

Debate,3aben2,We_Are_Grooot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:04:44 2015 UTC,"I experienced similar treatment. In a break round, I had to endure being called a ""homophobe"" for criticizing their argument about LGBTQ teens."
Debate,3aben2,nat_tourney,6,Mon Jun 22 00:21:09 2015 UTC,"My question for you is, HOW did you criticize it that would provoke being called a homophobe, I DOUBT that they would just automatically call you that for a reason. Given where Dougherty and my team is from in California, I can assure you that they would only say that if they truly believed that your answers could be intepreted as homophobic.   I don't know you and can only take an educated guess but @nat_tourney and @HotCurySwagYolo probably fall into the biggest demographic of debaters, straight men (no need to mention race). Given that, I have a hard time believing that they had no justification for saying what they said considering HIGH SCHOOL debaters lack of understanding of privilege. But if I am wrong by all means please clarify your points.  From my understanding from talking to coaches and competitors, a ton of teams avoided any sort of confrontation on the LGBT argument at this tournament. From what I heard the team they hit in Rd 14 purposely choose affirmative to avoid debating them on the issue of LGBT which not only upset that team's coach (the coach from my understanding had already prepped out DV's case), it probably cost them that round.   To all the folks here with the opinion that this team does not deserve to be in this round, understand that what happened earlier in the year is not always indicative of future success. You see it in sports all the time (My Giants were a wildcard and managed to beat teams that had a better history of sucess, yet we have now won 3 of the past 5 World Series. Was luck involved? Yes. Skills? the primary factor of those wins). After watching them debate in a practice round against our team prior to Nationals and watching them in Rd 14, I can assure you that this team made drastic improvements in their style, argumentation and rhetoric that led to come out as the ONLY undefeated team left at the tournament.   Any accusations that that was accomplished by unethical means are baseless. Unless you can provide specific instances of unethical behavior, then like everything else, this is just your opinion, and a bad one at that.  We have to remember that in public forum we have judges from all walks of life in debate and the tournament just comes down to a combination of your skills and adaptation at the tournament. Clearly they did that and deserve to be in there. Lay debate or flow debate, they have the skills to be in the final and they proved it. Again if you think that ""traditional"" PF debate is the base of Public Forum debate and will stay that way, stop kidding youself, when public forum was first introduced when I was in high school, as a policy debater I predicted that public forum would eventually be what is has become today. You have your traditionalist who seem to bicker about the direction the debate is moving and will strike those who dare to change it, and you have your ""non traditonal"" debaters who probably are coached by people who crossed over from other debates (like myself with a policy background) who have moved the debate to where it is today and who tend to downplay at times the importance of adaptation and strictly want to have an evidence debate. To me it seems like that is part of the resentment many of you have against this team and quite frankly, that is an issue that will never be resolved. The fact is that despite this schism, this tournament's judging pool has a mix of both as well as non-debaters and it goes to show that this team clearly took their coach's advice and adapted to the judges they had in their round. If you cannot accept that, then I guess there is not much we can do."
Debate,3aben2,rumv87,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:12:49 2015 UTC,"I really don't get it....no one thought anything was homophobic. They saw it as an easy chance to win, and it clearly worked for them."
Debate,3aben2,We_Are_Grooot,2,Fri Jun 19 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"As someone who knew them personally, I can say that they definitely didn't do anything that would go against the rules. They worked very hard to get to where they are at, starting out in a partnership rather tumultuously, but finally getting to finals. So when they saw this, the night after the round, you have to think about what they felt.   Be mad that they beat you, because if you resort to going on the internet and beating them down there, you definitely aren't someone that could ever go against them."

Debate,3a4nu7,razikain,6,Wed Jun 17 05:01:05 2015 UTC,"It's actually rather straightforward- a NTS occurs when no rule is offered to define the group. In other words, they simply exclude a counterexample without offering any justification why.  NTS is actually misapplied quite often, so there's lots of cases where the argument wouldn't be affected by the fallacy. However, that doesn't mean that the argument is valid. For example, I could redefine a group along my claim (""All people in Group X are nonviolent because, under my definition, Group X excludes violent people"") and that would essentially make my claim tautological and meaningless- in which case, you can't respond with ""NTS!"" but should instead debate me on the validity of my definition."

B: But Milton Friedman came out in favor of a negative income tax.  A: Ah, but Friedman's not a real libertarian.  Which is a case where NTS applies. Alternatively:  A: No libertarian I know supports any form of basic income.  B: But Milton Friedman came out in favor of a negative income tax.  A: See, in order to be a libertarian, you have to be opposed to wealth redistribution in any form. Therefore Friedman by definition is not a libertarian.  In the second case, you just call them out on their weak and self-serving definition of libertarian."

For example, where I'm from, PF/LD/CX are in fall and the speech events are the only thing referred to as forensics and are done in spring. Congress is done the Friday night before Saturday forensics tournaments. Because of this, there's a weird conflation of debate and speech--all the PF/LD/CX kids do it as their spring event but view it as speech.   But other places do it differently-for us, it's almo less legitimate that other debate forms, we'd run fun/crazy stuff, but for some it's just as important. Nats brings together people with different traditions/ customs."

I see congress as more of a cross between a speech and a debate event - however, all the bad congresses I've sat through sound like the one you went through. Don't worry, it's better than that. The good congressmen/women's speeches are a balance between refutation and advancement of their own agenda. Other speeches are used to either promote or tear down the bill as a whole, not other people's speeches. It's a fun event, no doubt, but in my opinion, it requires more ""people skills"" than PF. While PF is objectively harder because it is purely debate, you have to sell your point more in congress, and that's what makes it so unique."

If he's comfortable with an argument, then find ways to integrate that into most cases, but then while at home or practice expose him to different arguments that seem to be doing well. PF is a really differnet event, but if he can master it then the skills will transfer very very well. Perceptual dominance is a big thing also. You mentioned body language and that is key. My freshman year, my coach had be practice body language and introductions by having me introduce myself to different faculty members at my school I did not know, and this made me more comfortable and then increased my exposure to people I didn't know, but had to be overtly friendly to. It's good to see and hear that he is formidable in rounds because that will get him far, in the realm of winning rounds and making friends on the circuit.

By that, I mean, look for someone who's strong where you're weak, and with whom you communicate well. Are you good at bombing out detailed responses in the member speech? Find a partner who can do big picture analysis and see the whole board (so to speak). Keep an eye out for somebody who matches your work ethic, maybe somebody who thinks like you on a large scale, but whose reasoning is a bit more abstract (or more linear) than yours.   It's tough to find good chemistry, but when you do, it's like magic. Run some practice rounds with the newbies and see if you can find somebody who feels right. You don't have to be best-of-pals, but mutual respect and complementary skills are absolutely critical. Because you're a more senior member, hopefully you have some say in the matter of who you debate with, but also listen to your coach's intuition on the subject. We often have the years of experience necessary to see when a particular pairing is going to work well together.   NINJA EDIT: Also, be patent with the newbies. Bring them along, invest time in training them. That's for your benefit as well as theirs. It's absolutely our responsibility to make sure that everybody gets the most out of the activity.

As someone who has spent a bunch of time working with incoming novices this year on APDA (and been reasonably successful pro-am'ing), the biggest thing I can say early in the season is look for enthusiasm.

Debate,38zprb,Ahmad1799,4,Tue Jun 9 01:06:08 2015 UTC,"I know a few people who have this problem, and most often it stems from their brains working very fast and their mouths trying to catch up. The first thing you need to do is learn how to organize your thoughts so that you don't have to say everything on your mind. Sure, you have a lot of different threads and points that you want to get to, but it is better debating and easier on your speaks if you can tie it all together nicely. Once you're able to do that, you wont have to say as much and so you can go slower."
Debate,38zprb,MetropolitanVanuatu,2,Mon Jun 8 07:20:22 2015 UTC,"Pace is always an important aspect of speaking. Speaking at solely one speed (whether fast or slow) is almost never an effective way to convey your arguments. Use pauses for your advantage-- comedians do this all of the time, great poetry is made with built-in pauses, not to mention all great speakers incorporate pausing in their speaking style. Pauses are a great way of ending your thought (among other things), while also forcing you to slow down and have a break in your speech.  For PF, practice starting all of your speeches at a slow, conversation pace. Try using more descriptive words/practice word economy, instead of just saying a lot. The time you spend thinking ahead, think of HOW you want to say what you're thinking. The best speakers in PF know how to condense there speeches down to the most important material-- they may not speak at a fast pace 100% of the time, but they can pack their speeches full of material. Use your prep time before the speech and outline what you want to cover-- be organized, and don't start ranting. Make your point, and move on.  To help practice, re-do some of your rebuttal/summary speeches. Focus on saying more with less, but also have someone (like your partner, coach, maybe even your parent) who can tell you when to slow down. Also, always be more deliberate during FF (or when weighing), there is absolutely no need to go fast (especially with lay judges)  tldr- Pace yourself, work on how to phrase what you want to say. Don't be afraid to pause. Start your speeches slow, don't jump into it. Slow down when impacting/weighing"

Second, be willing to not cover everything, (I get that that is a hard concept to adhere to when you're good enough to cover everything), but considering it's lay judges that are having trouble with your speed, it's also lay judges who don't catch every bit of flow from your opponents; so focusing on the important stuff, or limiting yourself in the amount of refutation you do won't hurt as much as you think it would."

Debate,38zcs9,mjr1234,7,Mon Jun 8 02:55:11 2015 UTC,Nationals in extemp is extremely hard. For the most part you have to get all twos and some ones to break. It is necessary to memorize 10+ sources plus author names and dates and be able to use them with no hesitation and incorporate amusing anecdotes as well as humor. The people who are in the top 60 are robots who will not stutter or trip over a single sentence. What makes them special is lots and lots of practice and research. don't rely or even temp yourself with things like extemp engine. Knowing the evidence allows them to speak about any subject with ease. When they read their topic they will have already prepared for it numerous times.
Debate,38zcs9,Neetoburrito33,3,Mon Jun 8 03:09:36 2015 UTC,"As an extemp coach, this is an exaggeration. Fluency breaks are common even in national finals. To break at nationals, you have to get ranks that are mostly higher than 3.  Practice is necessary, and knowing things is necessary, but you don't need to ""know everything."" Read the Economist, NYT and WSJ occasionally, and try to have 1 source in the intro and 2 in every point."

When you get your topic you will then be able to takw care of presentation instead of research causing you to do better. Top 60 is impossible if u dont prepare. Its like debate you wont win if you get somebody elses case so you need to prep by yourself A LOT.
Debate,38zcs9,32rahul,6,Mon Jun 8 03:55:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree with /u/Neetoburrito33.  Breaking to top 60 just requires basic knowledge of topics and an ability to explain concepts clearly and consistently. Just do lots of research and practice, but if you make some fluency breaks you'll be fine. You won't need 10+ sources, lol I sure as heck never used that many at Nats, and you certainly don't need to force humor.  Creds: 4th last year in USX, 13th two years ago in USX."

There's the power triangle of movement, the organization around a metaphor (for example, my necro oratory had three parts: ""first, we will dig up the facts; then, we will do the deed of explaining why necrophiliacs, too, deserve justice; and finally, we will bury millennia of oppression against just another group of people who want to exercise their right to the pursuit of happiness.""), and the tendency of topics to be something that the judges 85% agree with already (kind of circlejerky) but also still kind of ""edgy.""  Oh, and your intro has to be really good. One of my favorite oratories was about wasted food- this guy began with a very vivid description of macaroni that caught everyone's attention. Don't do cliched stuff like quotes- you really want to grab people's attention, and a good part of that is also having mastery over your voice at tha time.

When you have a debate that devolves into people repeating themselves or talking circles over each other it's just sad.   Think of the 1AR in LD, this is how you need to imagine every speech in terms of efficiency. You need to be able to reduce the debate down to one or two defensive and one or two offensive arguments and do comparative analysis all in a much shorter time frame than you are use too. I've judged a bit of PF this year and I think that the easiest way to win a PF round is to know the arguments that are going to win you the round. The teams that seem to identify the BEST arguments seem to win. If your last speech has the good arguments in it and theirs does not you win easy as that. At a higher level it then becomes about the way you frame clash or your level of analysis etc. Before I worked in the minutia though I'd just focus on efficiency and being able to choose the best arguments.

Second speakers have to refute an entire case and be prepared for anything, then take the entire round and crystallize it in the FF for the judges - which can be hard, depending on how the round went. Essentially, Speaker 1 steers the round, and 2 is the engine. They're both equally important in many regards and the top teams have talented first and second speakers.

I think the best piece of advice to add to what has already been said would be this:  Public Forum is more about the judges than in LD. What I mean by that is that the nature of PF is essentially a debate broken down to a form best understood by a general audience (hence ""public forum""); your job in PF is now to appeal to your judges and their lieniency towards a type of argument. Everything you say must be broken down and explained articulately and effeciently, except in less than half the time of an LD debate. Think about the general scope of your arguments, and how easy it is for your audience to buy them. It's much less about the complexity and specificity of your arguments in PF.   As for transferable skills, I would say transferring PF skills to LD is much easier, and there are more of them to do so with. But, the biggest asset you will have coming from the LD circuit is simply your ability to persuade others of your moral superiority. It sounds silly, but as I mentioned, your job in PF is to appeal and to sound right. LD is all about values and what our moral obligation in society is; if you can take that pathos and use it in a PF round, you can more easily persuade the judges that you and your partner are winning. Don't claim a value in the debate necessarily, but you can transfer your moral and ethical persuasion to a PF round.  Good luck!"

At the end of the 1990s the share of the top 10 developing countries receiving the largest amounts of FDI amounted to 78 percent (see Data Table 4). Note that about half of all developing countries receive little or no foreign direct investment. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole receives about 5 percent of all FDI and most is concentrated in countries rich in petroleum and minerals.

Debate,38bk0o,32rahul,5,Wed Jun 3 03:50:11 2015 UTC,"-Local PF in Georgia is fairly straight forward. There are a good bit of lay judges, flow judges, and ""flay"" judges (usually parents that have judged for a few years). Returning debaters are also not hard to find. Unique argumentation is usually a quick key to success at local tourneys as most kids run general arguments. Despite only having a few national circuit teams, the idea of more technical or progressive debate has seeped in well. Evidence debates are not uncommon, but they are preventable. Framework focused debates are also not uncommon.    -TOC Bid Tourneys (assuming that's what you meant) : I have limited experience with these tournaments. From what I've seen, prelims are all about adaptability. There are a lot of returning debaters but there are often first time judges as well. Outrounds quickly become more progressive, technical, and animated. The evidence standard throughout the tournament is of a higher quality than locals. I suspect the TOC itself best imitates the outrounds at good TOC Bid Tourneys    -NCFLs: From my understanding, very lay"

More abstract interpretations of the resolution, faster speaking, the inclusion of things like solvency, and framework debates that are less about why the impacts should be weighed on util or an opportunity cost, and more about why governments or organizations shouldn't even consider util to be a reason why they act.

Fourth place at NSDA Nats last year (the other top ten mentioned by victory briefs didn't do that well) and 2nd place in the Texas State tournament this year. These rankings are part of a circuit-biased system that consistently favors teams from the northeast. With many local judges at this year's tournament I think it'd be crazy to count out good Texas teams like Berens-Martin or Brotzensmith-Vick.
Debate,38agzw,cool_coffee_meme,6,Wed Jun 3 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"These rankings are based off of an ELO rankings system. Points are awarded to those who attend national tournaments, defined as those with TOC bids. From what I understand, the teams you mention do not compete at very many of these tournaments. In regards to the charge that these rankings favor those on circuit and those in the northeast is completely true: those teams attend more and perform at a higher level than other teams.  Admittably, the teams you list are competitive teams. They have done well at larger tournaments but the idea that they would be top ten is to me highly suspect."

Is the TOC less intense in PF/Congress or is NCFL way more intense? As awesome and challenging as NCFL Nats for LD was I could never imagine it being a direct qualifier to TOC. (Admittedly this might have a lot to do with the fact that NCFL and TOC LD are basically two different events, but still)"
Debate,384onr,VisonKai,2,Tue Jun 2 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of everything you say. CFLs is an autoqual in those events because NCFL PF/Congress is more or less the same event as TOC PF/Congress. Lots of circuit schools attend the tournament in those events; as far as I know the winner of CFLs has always been a TOC qualified team, and many of this year's congress finalists were also TOC qualifiers. Any entry that succeeds at CFLs in PF or Congress is very likely to succeed at the TOC, which is why they are granted the autoqual. If I remember correctly (I haven't seen this year's PF/congress bid list in a minute), the majority of entries that autoqualled at CFLs also received 2 or more bids the following year.  It isn't easier to win CFLs in LD than it is in PF or Congress, but it also isn't a good predictor of success at the TOC. Like you say, CFL LD is basically a different event from TOC LD, so winning CFLs and qualifying to the TOC take very different skill sets. While it's true many recent LD champions have been TOC qualifiers, only one (Harrison DD) did well at the TOC the year that they won CFLs. Taking a step back, most participants in outrounds of CFLs wouldn't be able to qualify to the TOC. This makes it unreasonable to grant an autoqual to outrounds participants. I don't really know anything about CFL policy, but I'd assume that the situation is at least somewhat comparable to what it is in LD."
Debate,384onr,cookimonster,2,Tue Jun 2 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"That makes a fair amount of sense. I was wondering if the TOC for PF had a more progressive angle to it than other PF tournaments, but after watching a couple of minutes of a TOC PF round after I asked the question, I realized that's essentially not the case.  Interestingly in regards to CFL and TOC LD requiring two completely different skillsets, I went up against William T. Dwyer WY in octafinals for NCFL and he absolutely destroyed me. One of the most intelligent people I've met at a debate tournament, and the only person I faced the whole weekend to engage my AC on the contention level (it was basically entirely extemped too, I think he pulled up a single card from Mar/Apr for it). Anyway, we were talking afterwards and he had pretty limited knowledge of progressive LD. So, someone who got as far as quarters at NCFL nationals would struggle to pick up any rounds at most bid tournaments. Just something I found very interesting."
Debate,384onr,VisonKai,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:34:41 2015 UTC,"someone who got as far as quarters at NCFL nationals would struggle to pick up any rounds at most bid tournaments.   I wouldn't say that's wrong, but I think that might overestimate the height of the barriers of entry to circuit debate. My junior year I went to maybe 3 circuit tournaments (and didn't have a particularly impressive result at any of them), but I did do a lot of traditional debate and got to quarters of NCFL nationals, like the debater from William T. Dower. I went to camp before my senior year (this year), and was fairly successful on the national circuit. I think that my experience in traditional debate gave me fundamental skills that were transferable to circuit debate; I knew how to cover the flow, generate arguments,  crystalize at the end of a round, and a bunch of other things.  If someone (like the debater you mentioned) who had a solid traditional background spent a summer at debate camp learning circuit tech and strategies, I don't think that there's any reason why they wouldn't be pretty successful on the circuit the next year. People dramatically underestimate the importance of being able to intelligently answer arguments, especially when the arguments in question are terrible (most popular arguments on the circuit). Because the circuit seems so impenetrable, a lot of younger debaters who start circuit debate ignore the skills they have in favor of adopting the latest circuit trends, which is less necessary than they think.   That being said, I'm speaking from the position of someone who had a lot of advantages that that made the transition to circuit debate easier; I went to a circuit school that hired dedicated circuit LD coaches, had circuit teammates who helped me out a lot (I'm looking at you, Bump), and went to camp before my junior year so I had a working knowledge of most circuit concepts."

Debate,381g86,mjr1234,17,Mon Jun 1 03:56:49 2015 UTC,"These days, it is really difficult to enter many events like LD or some specific speech events. A few times it involves coaching, and other fines to just improve. So many styles of debate require learning from past debaters/having some way or another, but then there is PF.

Debate,381g86,Clusterfist,9,Mon Jun 1 04:35:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who has a lot of experience doing circuit LD and a working understanding of how policy works, I'd have to respectfully disagree with you about PF having more evidence trading than the other events. LDers (at least on the circuit) share and trade prep all the time, and most debaters post cites to their cases online on the NDCA wiki. In policy, sharing is even more part of the culture. Everything is disclosed, and hundreds of cases are posted online every year as part of the open evidence project."

Debate,381g86,Lewan72,15,Mon Jun 1 09:43:05 2015 UTC,"I do PF for a few reasons....   my school doesnt have an active coach, just a supervisor.   PF is something I can easily teach myself and teach others, CX probably not. It took two tournaments for me to make Semis in PF. In policy, I probably would be dead on arrival.  The barriers to entry in other events are too high. My state is one of the strongest policy states in the nation. So to just keep up, you have to be able to compete on the national circuit. 1/3 of my school is on reduced lunch, we're a minority school that has trouble recruiting non-IEs, and we get bare-bones  school support. We can't charge enough in dues to build that type of program. We wouldn't be allowed to constantly miss school for tournaments. We've focused mainly on PF + IEs to build any recent success because we have to. I like it. It was what I was put in at the begining, and I've grown to love it and the community.    People love to attack PF/Congress without knowing that some kids honestly would have no access to debate without it. Since I'm not national citcuit, I know I wasn't really able to answer your question, but this is why I compete."
Debate,381g86,EasternZone,3,Mon Jun 1 13:20:58 2015 UTC,"Public Forum Debate has increased in popularity for a few reasons. Primarily, because the NFL (excuse me, the National Speech and Debate Association.) has achieved their intended goal of PF debate when they originally created it, (I believe in 2004, when it was originally referred to as Ted Turner Debate,) which was that it would appeal to the common man. Many debate students of any level of competition, regardless of background and experience, should be able to jump into PF and have a certain degree of success depending on effort. Lincoln Douglas and Policy Debate both are not nearly as accessible to your average student either. Whether it's because of resources, other time constraints, etc., PF debate appeals to students who may have difficulty immersing themselves in a different, more rigorous and demanding style of debate.   In addition to that, nearly any common person, from a parent to a bus driver, should be and often is able and qualified to judge a PF round. So it has an appeal to coaches and tournament organizers as well (from a coach's perspective, not having to hire a heavily qualified judge with a background in debate is a miracle.)"

Debate,381g86,MetropolitanVanuatu,5,Mon Jun 1 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"Pf is something of a new frontier: it hasn't been around for long and people are still learning new ways to debate it.  It hasn't been overrun with k's like LD and policy.  If a novice were to watch CX, LD, and pf rounds, they'd be able to understand the pf round more than the others.  Pf is advertised and viewed by some as laid back and requirng little effort, so slackers will see it as an easy way to do debate.  (Any self-respecting PFer knows this isn't true, unless you never intend on winning a round.)  Pf topics are about things people might have actually heard about.  Pf has more emphasis on speaking skills, making it attractive to speech people or people who otherwise would have done speech."
Debate,381g86,eslondon,2,Mon Jun 1 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"Another important factor is that traditionalist coaches in a lot of places hate policy (naturally) and more and more of them are realizing that LD is not what they've been thinking it was, at least higher levels. As a result, lots of established programs are encouraging more and more students to go into PF. I've noticed this particularly in my region (Florida) where policy is largely dead (only 18 teams at our varsity state tournament this year, and I recognize a good portion of the names as being LD competitors) and LD is rapidly shrinking in certain parts of the state.   I will also admit that PF is vastly better for training public speaking skills and for a lot of kids going into debate, they want to get better at public speaking, not research and argumentation."

Debate,37vw88,gethereddout,6,Sun May 31 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"During the next few minutes, the officer used verbal commands and less-than-lethal force, including an electronic control device such as a Taser, physical force and a so-called “impact weapon” to subdue the man but was unsuccessful, according to police. The man started moving toward the officer again and said he was going to attack the officer, police said. The officer shot in response. Long Beach firefighters then began treating the man at the scene. He was taken to an area hospital’s trauma center at 7:43 p.m., Fisk said. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.   Unfortunate, but please do not attack, or threaten police officers."
Debate,37vw88,DebateGod2015,0,Sun May 31 03:14:41 2015 UTC,.there is no commenter here saying it's his fault. Only comments saying that the cop over reacted or that there is too little stuff known to decide yet
Debate,37vw88,Zeus1325,12,Sun May 31 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"police said.   You have to realize that a hyped up person who was just attacked probably didn't recognize this was a cop. Secondly, this is a testimony from a cop, so who knows what happened. Moreover, if the cop was able to get close enough to hit him with a baton and otherwise use physical force, then the officer should have also been able to continue using non-lethal force, or, you know, call back up. There is no reason to have killed him."
Debate,37vw88,Thornwell,2,Mon Jun 1 00:24:59 2015 UTC,so who knows what happened  there is no reason to have killed him   I'm interested to know how you can make both statments
Debate,37vw88,Zeus1325,2,Sun May 31 04:53:07 2015 UTC,"Since we only have the cop's perspective, we can't really know what happened. It is in the cop's interest to make Morad sound as deranged as possible. Secondly, eye-witness testimonies are known to be inaccurate. I would feel much better with the testimonies of the cop and other witnesses being added to the story. On the second point, if the cop were able to use non-lethal force and is supposedly well trained in conflict mediation, there is no reason to switch to lethal force. We don't know all the evidence yet, but if they used all of the non-lethal methods, I don't see why they weren't able to subdue him or continue using those methods or call for back up."
Debate,37vw88,Thornwell,-1,Sun May 31 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"all we can do is speculate. We cant make definitive statements like, ""there is no reason to have killed him"" yet"
Debate,37vw88,Zeus1325,2,Sun May 31 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"Sure it is speculative, but even one of your own comments agrees that we need more than just the cop's side of the story. My opinion is said as a statement, and I think I give a reasonable explanation as to how I arrived there. Nonetheless, when more information is provided, we will know what happened for real -- perhaps."

The police have shown that they have an incredible capacity for spinning stories to make murder justified in many cases. It's impossible to know if their actions were justified or not in this instance, though like /u/vitate said even the official story doesn't make it sound like lethal force was absolutely necessary."

Debate,37syjj,ww_pimp,6,Sat May 30 03:27:19 2015 UTC,"Our school has a few officers who run events and whatnot. They're in charge of running the team, basically. Then we have event captains who help novices. We used to have one or two event captains per, but that led to people shirking responsibility so we just changed it (Debate, Interp, Limited Prep).  As for fundraising, we do a yearly showcase where people get chosen to perform their piece and there's a debate. Pretty fun.   Edit: Saw the fundraising question"
Debate,37syjj,sometimesadog,4,Sat May 30 03:44:23 2015 UTC,"we just do Debate Captain and Speech Captain (two of each, or one of each depending on the size). Our responsibilities were basically organizing the bulk of our tournament, assisting novices, suggesting what tournaments we attend, and making sure people are prepared for friday/saturday. Our tournament is our main fundraiser. Most of our community outreach is done in other clubs, but I know that other schools do ""public debates"" in grocery stores or restaurants."
Debate,37syjj,EasternZone,2,Sat May 30 04:29:40 2015 UTC,"We have a captain of each event, and an overall president/vp/treasurer (these are usually also captains). The captain is effectively an event specific coach that trains novices and usually has to be at novice only tournaments to observe and give suggestions, etc.  We are absolutely awful at fundraising but hosting tournaments seems to work well, try hosting one of your local CFLs. Concessions + lunch is a loooot of money and HS students are so desperate for volunteer hours in most cases that you'll have no shortage of labor."
Debate,37syjj,VisonKai,2,Sat May 30 14:51:31 2015 UTC,"In order of your questions--  1.) I teach at the UT Austin camp for PFD (I was there last year, and also am teaching this upcoming summer). It runs like most debate camps: I don't know much about the ""sophomore select"" portion for CX, but I know the CX camp runs with skill-level labs mixed in with varying electives. The schedule is going to be stuffed from 8am to 9pm (with a lunch and dinner break of course), plus you'll be doing a ton of research/card cutting/case writing after 9pm. Enjoy yourself! Camp is a great experience not only because you can network with debaters from all over, but you receive instruction from some pretty good coaches and former debaters.  tl;dr-- Work hard and enjoy yourself, but don't get burnt out too quick!  2.) My school had a pretty similar setup to the officer/captain stuff you were describing (i.e. Prez, VP, Trez, Sec, Hist.) while also having a ""Speech Captain"", ""PF Captain"", ""LD Captain"" and ""Interp Captain"" (we didn't really have any policy teams).  3.) We didn't do much community outreach, but when it came to fundraising, our tournament was by far the biggest money maker. We did other fundraisers on the side (i.e. Car washes, Homecoming sales, etc) but the tournament was probably around 70-80% of the money our team made.  Good luck!"
Debate,37syjj,lbt86,2,Sat May 30 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"Just FYI - if you are looking for a fundraiser besides a public debate or a tournament, Chipotle will host a fundraiser for you where you get 50% of profits between a 4 hour time block of your choosing. I know that most restaurants will host fundraisers, but most of them only give 15% back -which means that if there are $500 of food orders during your time block, you'd only get $75) - in my opinion, not worth it unless you can guarantee a lot of traffic."

Debate,37refp,mcctres,8,Fri May 29 20:07:21 2015 UTC,"Probably because pro case rests almost entirely on their opening interpretation of the resolution as a moral question based on the clash between two ethical ideologies: Utilitarianism and Deontology. By establishing that the neg case must use utilitarianism to defend the current position of the United States drug policy (contentiously offered as the Kingpin strategy) the pro has access to all of the harms to util when the neg tries to voice support of the policy because as Grant (pro 2nd speaker says), ""our policy is to kill people.""  The neg uses a substantial chunk of prep time to thoroughly go through their blocks to this primarily philosophical case by attacking the scope of the pro, saying that focusing on just the kingpin strategy is parametricizing the resolution into an unfairly narrow discussion. Without losing any of their presentation skills, they deftly navigate through centuries of philosophical discussion, apply it to the drug policy (noting what they think is a crucial difference between policy and implementation of that policy). Then grant's pro rebuttal comes and all hell breaks loose. It's, for me, an example of a round that demonstrates what PF can be--not just the two extremes of PF that you often come across: either highly presentation-based, purely persuasive charisma rounds or the statistic-spitting rapid fire evidence-reading that many have fully embraced. These two teams are not just good debaters, they are really fucking smart too--they don't just read cards and act like they're hot shit because they can give a rebuttal, they understand things on a conceptual level and are able to accurately, persuasively present really esoteric concepts in less than 45 minutes. That's why it stands out."

Debate,37refp,EasternZone,2,Sat May 30 04:32:44 2015 UTC,"It's tough, but I think I would vote for Grant and Aishu based on two big reasons: First, Anuj and Aneesh's arguments are very strongly hindered by their lack of distinction between actions and omissions, which is one of the first things that the pro case mentions. This means that their turn (""by not killing the kingpins, we're using the civilians as a means to an end to keep the drug cartels alive"") falls flat, since that is an omission, not an action, and therefore does not generate offense within the scope of the resolution and in fact reaffirms pro's argument that Util is an inadequate philosophy. There is never really a meaningful response to this, and I buy pretty strongly into the idea that taking a legitimate action has much larger moral repercussions (e.g. knowingly killing someone as a means to a policy goal) than NOT doing something. Second, Grant pretty much destroys the ""prohibition is our policy"" when he gets Aneesh to admit that US foreign drug policy is determined by our domestic policy and that a sizable portion of our own citizens support legalization of marijuana, which shows that prohibition isn't the unchanging, steadfast policy that the neg wants the resolution to focus on. They eventually kind of admit they're losing on this argument and focus on other areas, but at that point, I would be close to signing the ballot for pro. Great round overall."

Thats why you ask how they feel about K's in the first place or look them up on judging philosophy.

The key to running a K successful in PF is being able to make it comprehensible to the normal person in the time constraint that you have. A PF K is going to be substantially different from a policy one because of the way you have to format it. In PF, you will not structure the argument as ""link, impact, alt, framework"". You should structure the argument in the way best conducive to explaining the particular kritik you'd like to run. Here is an example of one way you can format it. Contention one the link Contention two the implication Contention three the alt/advocacy Contention four the role of the judge/ ballot Optional Contention five no perm.  Above everything else, make sure you REALLY know what you are talking about. You will not be a successful kritical debater if you don't have a substantial knowledge on whoever or whatever you are reading. If you have time actually read the literature instead of the cards cut from it because it's far more valuable to have the a full understanding of the context of the it. Also, do not spead!!!"

Debate,37n1vl,cjfaulkner,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:00:35 2015 UTC,"I ran a fem K on my local circuit a few times. With that one, I'd say it had equal success and failure. Obviously feminism can be a touchy subject for some people. Some of the judges really liked it and some really didn't (sorry I don't remember the win rate bc it's been a while). Usually the ones that liked it were previous policy or LD debaters. Keep in mind that my district is fairly progressive and it's not unusual to see PF style Ks in later rounds depending on the tournament and the team you hit. At state, on the community college topic, I ran a Freire K. Basically, it said what's the point of having a free CC if education in itself has become oppressive. 2 judges really really loved it. One judge hated it because he does not believe in seeing Ks in PF. If you do choose to use a K only use it when you know you have the judge right for it. Looking back, I know I could have prevented a few losses if I hadn't been stubborn and just chose to run my other case rather than my one with the K (which I find more fun to debate). If you're at a tournament where there are no judge philosophies on Joy or anything, then just ask the judge if they are okay with Ks. With that in mind, always make sure you have a backup case if you have a lay or a judge who doesn't want you to read it. At state, we had one judge that heard about the Freire K we had used and right when we walked in the room and hadn't even said a word, he said we could not run it and if we did he would automatically down us(bit questionable since his philosophy said he was all for ""progressive"" style in PF...then again he also got in trouble for some very unethical things that went on in our round).

Debate,37n1vl,nerdierthanyou,5,Fri May 29 05:04:59 2015 UTC,"They were doing a K on the neg. They played music from their phones and read narratives of people in poverty from other countries on the feb topic. They said in round that if I wanted to vote for the other team it was cool with them. They were just happy to have a judge not yell at them for running a K. I ended up voting for them because the other team started making these really gross racist and classist comments because they had no clue how to respond which bit into the K super hard. So it was easy for me to vote on the k and against that other team. The team that ran it was able to run it well because it wasn't really your normal k and they didn't have it structured like a more standard k might.  Idk it was an odd round, and obviously pure experimentation. But I think they learned from it, and I hope they ended up running more Ks. I'd like to see a bit more debate in pf tbh."

Debate,37n4so,michaelg2000,11,Thu May 28 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"National tournaments as in bid tournaments? Or as in just college tournaments?  In either case, here's what I found different:   The geographic distribution of debaters. You might not realize it, but your local and state circuits have their own flavors of debate, even when it comes to progressive debate. It's like this set of preferences (of which arguments to run, which paradigms judges have, which ""ridiculous""/left/complex arguments judges just don't vote on, how dominant things like theory and K's are) that have accumulated over the years that uniquely define your circuit. There's also trends that happen geographically- for example, there was a certain kind of theory-laden case that was very popular among people from a certain camp's top lab from a certain year and spread in certain geographic areas. So when you're at a tournament that's got people from even just a couple of states over, you're getting exposed to a broader range of perspectives- broken out of your local/state bubble. It's also stuff you're less prepared to handle (as I found out the hard way). The competitiveness of debaters. If it's a bid tournament, at least some of the people there are going to make it to the TOC (or at least get a bid- that's literally guaranteed). People are also going to bring their A-game, at least by the late outrounds, so you're going to be facing the very best that your branch of debate can offer. Judges! Yes, there are some crap judges that make it to bid tournaments because schools save money/meet obligations by providing a judge. But the vast majority of judges, especially if you've got a winning record after the first 2 rounds or are in outrounds, are going to be fantastic at what they do. They'll be the ones that have put some serious thought into what they do, what your branch of debate is supposed to be like, what it's really like, and how to handle arguments that debaters make. They'll also be the ones who've probably heard something at least very similar to your case before (or have something to suggest, from their own area of specialization). At a local tournament or (outside a few state circuits) even at your state championship, you'll rarely hear that literally the best Kritikal judge is there, judging outrounds. You'll never get that sort of feedback at a regular tournament, and while it might be a bit scary to get ruthlessly crushed in octos in front of your role models, the critiques after the round make it worth it.   I don't know what it offers on the traditional side; I usually went to these tournaments because I was a progressive debater and they offered some really good opportunities for progressive debate (and didn't require me to focus on my stock cases to the point that I was only able to come up with 2-3 progressive cases on each side; I was actually able to diversify because the judges were much more diverse and weren't going to strike me most of the time the moment I started speaking faster than 50 wpm or said the word ""kritikal"") but there were a few traditional judges I ran into, primarily in r5 or r6 when I hadn't broken yet."

Debate,37n4so,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,3,Fri May 29 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"college admissions   Winning or getting far at a bid tournament is probably going to count a lot more than winning or getting far at a few locals, since the field is going to be actually competitive. If you're doing debate to make your resume look good, it's going to look a hell of a lot better to win a tournament at someplace like Harvard (even to the uneducated) than it is to win a tournament at some high school nearby. That said, winning Berkeley is much harder than winning a local HS tournament, no matter how competitive your local circuit is.   team/individual prestige   If you do well, you do ""pop up on the radar."" A lot of schools that are really competitive notice other teams a lot better when they frequently pop up as competition at bid tournaments.

We chose the topic by having a team meeting where people threw out topics they liked, narrowed it down to a few, and kids voted on the topic they were most excited about. One topic that really seemed to get the audience engaged was an old LD topic ""Resolved: Juveniles charged with violent crimes ought to be tried and punished as adults."" The one spin was that it was showcased PF style (no criterion, value like in LD). I would also suggest possibly getting a recording of the showcase to use if the team is ever applying for a grant.

Debate,37fg0o,oxygentlemen,9,Wed May 27 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"OK let's break this into chunks shall we?   As feelings, and indeed many varieties of feeling, can...be recognized as an ingredient of will, so, in the second place, can thinking: in every act of will there is a commanding thought--and do not imagine that this thought can be separated from the 'willing', as though will would remain over! Thirdly, will is not only a complex of feeling and thinking, but above all an effect, and in fact the effect of command.   For starters Nietzsche claims that ""will"" is made up of a combination of thought and feeling.  Specifically he says that there is an overarching thought that is 1. inextricably linked to whatever you will to do and 2. directly causes the will.  (I'm guessing he talked about the relation between feelings and will directly before this passage)  An example: You are hungry and see a cake sitting on a table sitting across the room.  You decide to walk over and eat a slice of the cake.  The feeling in this scenario is the hunger, your desire for the cake and probably some other stuff.  The overarching thought is the decision to walk over and eat some cake, and the will is you physically doing it.  (this isn't entirely accurate, but I'll correct myself in a minute)  I'll leave it to you to prove to yourself these concepts fulfill their obligations.   What is called 'freedom of will' is essentially the effect of superiority over him who must obey: 'I am free', ""he"" must obey--this consciousness adheres to every will, as does that tense attention, that straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, that unconditional evaluation 'this and nothing else is necessary now', that inner certainty that one will be obeyed, and whatever else pertains to the state of him who gives commands. A man who wills commands something in himself which obeys or which he believes obeys.   First thing to realize is that he who obeys and he who commands are both the same person.  (once again not entirely accurate but I'll correct myself in a sec)  Here Nietzsche makes the claim that because you have a body that follows commands - and that this is something that you just intrinsically know - and that your mind is under no such constraints that you have ""freedom of will"" e.g. the ability to decide to do something and then actually do it.   But now observe the strangest thing of all above the will--about this so complex thing for which people have only one word: inasmuch as in the given circumstances we at the same time command and obey, and as the side which obeys know [sic] the sensations of constraint, compulsion, pressure, resistance, motion which usually begin immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are in the habit of disregarding and deceiving ourselves over this duality by means of the synthetic concept 'I'; so a whole chain of erroneous conclusions and consequently of false evaluations of the will itself has become attached to the will as such--so that he who wills believes wholeheartedly that willing suffices for action. Because in the great majority of cases willing takes place only where the effect of the command, as we be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the sensation, as if there were here a necessity of effect.""   Nietzsche claims that when we think of ourselves - when we think ""I"" - what we think of is both the mind (presumably including consciousness, the sum of our experiences and so forth), and our bodies.  This isn't correct and we should realize the duality between the two because doing otherwise leads to a series of erroneous assumptions and statements.  (this is the error I made in the first statement of that second passage)  What happens as a result of this false assumption is that we expect action to be a result of will. (namely because whenever we will something in the majority of all cases it happens)  To give an example: you decide to say something, and you do.  This happens every time you speak.  However pretend that without your knowledge your voicebox was ripped out, or that your tongue doesn't work, but you forgot about it and you decided to speak.  In this scenario you have the feeling and the thought which directly lead to the will to speak - but the action doesn't happen.  This is the error I made in the first passage.  The will is not the physical act (almost always the physical act happens as a direct result of the will via electric signals and so forth), but rather the unconscious decision to take the action."

If they're reading a piece of evidence (which you can usually pick out when you hear [name][year] e.g in the first video you can hear 'Rom, 08' around the 2:00 mark) it will be off of a computer or piece of paper. You can practice trying to just pick out tags/authors and not worry about card content. As the debate goes on the 'scriptedness' of what they're reading tends to drop and drop and most 1AR/2NR/2AR's are completely extemporaneous. They have at most 10 minutes to prepare a speech, and that's if they saved every second of prep for the entire round and spent it all on one speech. Some debaters prepare everything they'll say ahead of time, others fly by the seat of their pants.  And sorry if those are too fast, I'm trying to find videos that balance speed, clarity of speech, and sound quality and it's a tricky combo. What I will say is that you can totally get to where you understand what they're saying, and it's okay to listen to super fast (these are on the middle upper boundaries for the most part) debaters and not get most of what they're saying.

There are just some arguments you can't thoroughly cover in 6 or 7 minutes without speeding up a little, and those arguments are hell of a lot more fun than the arguments I used to read before I could spread.  EDIT: Your argument is also premised on the view that debate's only purpose is to prepare people for something in the ""real world."" Some of us just do it because it's hella fun and makes us think. There's lots of things I do, after all, that aren't going to help me suck the dick of capitalism in the corporate world or convince people to do something/etc.- some things we just do because we want to do them, because we see them as ends in themselves."

Debate,37cb6i,VisonKai,2,Wed May 27 00:34:05 2015 UTC,"No prollem, I would say that spreading and theory are rather uncommon other than in round robins. I only do it with really progressive judges, if Im bored, or if im desprete and need to flood the flow."
Debate,37cb6i,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,4,Wed May 27 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"Totally agree re: slow LD rounds. Just finished up NCFLs and, while it was partially because of the resolution, I'm pretty sure a high school 1 semester philosophy class covers basically everything I heard. I think there was like, one meta-ethic round that I had to do and everything else was human rights, social contract, etc. And it's not like these kids that have never heard of progressive debate or spreading are dumb, the guy who knocked me out of octas was great. But the arguments were simplistic and boring even if the arguing was good."
Debate,37cb6i,VisonKai,1 point,Wed May 27 01:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think this judge paradigm (see ""Old paradigm"" since he's added a serious one between 2013 and now) sums it up pretty well. There's this weird conservatism in traditional LD that discriminates against valid educational arguments on the grounds that they're either ""too policy"" or ""have no real-life application.""    Two words: value clash  Whoever wins the value wins the debate. Game over. I especially enjoy the clash between the values of justice and morality. I think this is a key portion of the debate and so you should focus on it accordingly.   I do not allow counterplans because this is LD not policy and we need to keep LD values based by banning logical arguments that encourage critical thinking and advocacy skills.   There's just a thrill to the game when you run into some stray Heidegger/Butler/Zizek/Wilderson/insert favorite author here and you have to think really, really fast to understand what your opponent just said and be ready to condense it to something usable for your cross. It's even more fun to figure out how you're going to respond to their argument, especially considering the reality that there's no way you could've prepared for it through sheer research or just better card-cutting- even if you're that lucky school that gets 10 coaches to cut cards for you and have some brilliant theory ready to go to block good arguments you can't respond to. Those sorts of arguments are what kept me addicted to debate even as it became an increasingly large time investment.  There's just this incredible depth and complexity to these arguments that you can't cover talking at <100 wpm in 6 minutes; you can't summarize Heidegger or Foucault in that way and act like you did justice to this guy's life's work (or expect to win, in most cases, with a good judge). Spreading was great because it essentially liberated debate and turned it into this wide open space where each round became more interesting than the last and the possibilities were literally endless. There was no way to say that ""the topic boils down to X vs Y"" because of how much literature suddenly became accessible in a progressive environment."
Debate,37cb6i,backcountryguy,2,Wed May 27 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, even with spreading things like DnG are hard to effectively do in LD, without it it's completely impossible. And, I think, debate also becomes much more fulfilling and you feel like you achieve much more when you include technical/mechanical skills like spreading. At least for me when I give a 1AR where I successfully cover all the neg offs, engage the NC on substance, and read my own off, I feel absolutely fantastic because I know for sure that 99.99% of people in the world can't do that because they just aren't able to talk that fast."
Debate,37cb6i,WellHeresMyFourthAcc,2,Wed May 27 03:57:12 2015 UTC,@ that paradigm: wtf is a prestandard?
Debate,37cb6i,f4therfucker,1 point,Wed May 27 04:08:28 2015 UTC,"It's a term that only makes sense within the context of LD. They're also called prima facie and a priori arguments (I don't know whether they've popped up in the policy space under those names; I doubt it, though) but these are basically arguments that come before the actual substance of the case. Usually very abusive attempts to get an automatic concession from a drop by your opponent (they do work like a charm in this regard, although they don't make for very fun rounds).  Mostly, they're just used for additional layering. At least when I debated in HS, being a good LDer was about being good at layering, and prestandard issues give you something to go to between the theory/K (all the ""pre-fiat"" issues) and the actual cases."
Debate,37cb6i,f4therfucker,6,Thu May 28 01:30:07 2015 UTC,"Well, being able to even think cohesively at 300 wpm is a useful life skill IMO.    That said, I'd prefer to speak at ordinary speeds as well, but if other debaters are speaking lightening fast at top tournaments, I'm going to need to get to their level in order to debate them."
Debate,37cb6i,f4therfucker,2,Thu May 28 01:35:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know; I feel like anyone who can say something great and cohesive at 300 wpm can say something really great at 90 wpm.  CX doesn't just teach research, it teaches you to think (and speak) on your feet."
Debate,37cb6i,f4therfucker,2,Tue May 26 21:49:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, I completely understand the importance of good speaking and persuasiveness.  As I said in the post, I've been doing policy in a league that discourages spreading.  We use mostly lay and parent judges, so the policy I've been doing is essentially PF with a year-long resolution.  Throughout the year, I've had to be confident and persuasive in order to get anywhere.  I recognize the value of persuasiveness.  I'm not saying the quality of what you're saying is dependent upon your rate of speech.  I'm just saying that speaking at 300 wpm requires you to be incredibly quick on your feet.    For example, in my last year of doing policy, I've noticed that most of my speaking is extemporaneous.  I usually go up to the podium having no idea what I'm going to say.  Oftentimes I'll start a sentence with no earthly idea of how I'll actually finish it.  Sometimes I don't finish it, just because I haven't thought up something to say yet.  This is speaking at a normal speed.  If I were able to speak insightfully at 300 wpm, I think I would run out of insightful things to say much less often when speaking at a more reasonable speed."

Debate,374ow1,JaggerStapp,8,Mon May 25 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"You sir are incorrect. First off I know for a fact that they link it to the topic exceptionally well. I heard that case 3 times, (prelims, octos, and finals) and every time nobody was able to successfully argue topicality. Their link into that whole contention is diffusion of best ideas. Not only do they give them the technology, but they also teach them how to use it (they also teach general concepts ie farming & drip irrigation...). Even further, an argument isnt to be excluded from the debate because it occured in the past, by that logic we can only ever look to hypotheticals. But it wasnt really in the past per se, just like they argued against ridge and me in prelims. This is true because death is the terminal impcat in the cycle of poverty the green revolution ended. New practices (green revolution) solved and prevented the deaths, and also breaking a cycle that would still be continuing today without Norman Borloug's genious."
Debate,374ow1,JaggerStapp,-1,Mon May 25 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"The debate was status quo. ""Is"" not ""have been."" In addition teaching someone to use a mosquito net isn't education any more than a YouTube video teaching you how to shoot a gun is education."
Debate,374ow1,Clusterfist,3,Mon May 25 01:22:23 2015 UTC,"First, in response to the ""is"" thing you just said, you literally are limiting the scope of the debate to hypotheticals; no judge would buy that. And second, if you watched finals, youd remember that they defined education as disseminating new information. Thus, granting them access to the best practices. But even if everything you are saying is correct, Jacob and Ben are really good they would easily find a way around it. This claim is justified in three ways. First, they have the single year bid record (they win alot). Second, they made it to semis at TOCs. Third, they won CatNats."

Debate,36lgcr,veyronboss,1 point,Wed May 20 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have evidence, but I have a similar case for parli.  Good, relatively unique arguments can be made about the jury selection process.  First under this, it takes less time because there's less to figure out about people. This frees up some time in the justice system, which is relatively zero-sum. Every hour that's not spent doing jury selection can be used to prevent forcing somebody into a plea bargain. You can probably find lots of cards to draw impacts from increasing time.  Secondly, since pretty much all firms now have some access to info about jurors since they are serving on multiple juries, it eliminates the skew in the status quo where only the rich firms can influence jury selection and this creates a more equitable system.  Next area of argumentation could be about eliminating biases. Pretty straightforward. Find some cards about how the CJS is racist in sentencing, guilty verdicts, etc. Even if professional jurors are just as racist as the average guy, you're less likely to rely on your biases as to who ""looks suspicious"" or who ""talks like a criminal"" when making a decision about something where you ACTUALLY know what to look for.  Finally, and related to the previous one, the most obvious argument is that you get better decisions. Set up some framework where protecting rights of the innocent outweighs anything because sending someone to jail is an enormous, irreversible rights violation. Standards like ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" are really hard for people to adjudicate without some prior experience as to how they're applied.   There's also a skewed perception as to what should actually be considered evidence, so good lawyers pander to misconceptions prevalent in the general populace. Google the ""CSI effect,"" it's a real thing.   Additionally under this point, you can talk about how in a group of random people, bad dynamics occur when they make the decision. For example, as a debater, I'm very convincing and also very convinced my opinion is right. In a group of average people, this means I'll have more control over the decision than anyone else in the room and can lead the jury to a biased decision. When everyone knows what they're doing, this is less likely to happen."
Debate,36fz6t,unknown145,7,Tue May 19 02:18:33 2015 UTC,"As a second speaker, I flow vertically on lined paper, with the opponent's case in the margin and then numbered responses with arrows for the rebuttal. When flowing the case, make sure that you abbreviate as much as possible to keep the case in the margin and label! Put exclamation points next to impacts, number warrants, etc. It will keep everything a lot more organized.  Also, keep in mind that it also helps to do a pre-flow on a SEPARATE sheet of paper to keep track of your own points. You should do this before the round, and flow it in the same way that you would flow your opponent's case. That way, you can write down their responses from their rebuttal on that second sheet of paper and more easily address them. For summary and FF, I flow them separately on another sheet of paper, but I also know a lot of people use arrows for extensions and just continue on their original flow. I think either way works fine- the first might help to organize your thoughts better and have a clearer structure, while the second will help you follow the flow of the debate and which things have been cleanly extended vs. muddled.  One final note: I flow in two colors, which helps me keep track of whose points are whose. You don't have to do this, obviously, but I think it makes things more organized."

On one half of the page, I write the contention number and tagline, and then any useful info indented under that. After that, I draw a line separating that from the rebuttals I write, then number my responses, and the opening sentence of each response.  I'm a second speaker so after that I just write general notes on the other side of the paper, then outline a final focus during grand CX.

Debate,35p8kh,SHAGGED_UR_DAD_M8,5,Tue May 12 11:44:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is a specific fallacy, but I do think it's illogical. The statement that the sentence seems to put forward is, ""A person who decides not to vote, forfeits their right to complain about the victorious party"". Or maybe even, ""A person who decides not to vote, cannot hold legitimate views about the victorious party"". Whatever the phrasing or meaning, there isn't one that relies on logic to give a decisive answer.  What this is, is an opinion, or a moral judgement. It only really makes sense when subjective, eg. ""I think a person who decides not to vote, cannot hold legitimate views about the victorious party"". Even then, it probably comes close to Appeal to Law (I think it's called) which is the mistake of thinking that because something is against the law or the rules (in this case, their own rules), it is wrong, or can't exist, etc.    There's a lot of debate about abstaining from voting. Some countries actually require you by law to vote. Abstaining can be a sign of protest that the system or the constitution is in a state of malfunction. If a person disagrees with at least one thing from each party, should they be required by law to vote for something they don't believe in? Is it desirable to have everybody vote? What about ignorant people who don't follow politics? Is their vote worth that of someone who has followed politics for 50 years? Should a person with no interest in something be forced to vote? I'd kick right off if I had to vote for X Factor or something.  Then you've got the issue of, if you didn't vote, was it because you couldn't be arsed or was there an emergency and you couldn't get to the polling station? What reasons would be valid enough to retain your right to criticism?  Finally, if people think it is your duty to vote, do they not think it is also your duty to criticise and check the government and take an interest? What is legitimate participation? Should big newspaper owners be allowed to print political stuff and influence voting intentions even if they live in America, have Australian citizenship and cannot vote?  So it is a big subject. I hope that's given you something to think about. I think the TL;DR is just that it's not a logical statement but just someone's opinion."
Debate,35p8kh,Wulfruna,5,Tue May 12 13:05:57 2015 UTC,"""if you didn't vote then you can't complain"" is a fallacy, it's form of ad hominem fallacy where the messenger's credibility is being attacked instead of the message which is being ignored.

I've really grown to despise thoughts like this. Similar sayings are ""You gotta exercise your rights, otherwise you lose em."" If this is how you encourage young people to vote, then you have proved you don't care enough about who s getting voted in. One shouldn't encourage young voters to vote because they have the right, but because they're informed and are able to help us make the best decision."

Debate,35p8kh,eslondon,-1,Fri May 15 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"In no way is it a fallacy.  Most ballots actually have an option to vote for no one, or to abstain.  If the UK's ballots don't have this you could probably still argue that they should.  So while yes it's a ""good"" thing to vote (most of the time keep in mind I write this from the POV of someone in the US) all you did was abstain.  That being said in no way is what they're saying a fallacy informal or otherwise it's just kind of weak if anything.  Actually you calling it a fallacy to discredit it in a way is a fallacy.  That one is called the fallacy fallacy.  You would not believe how much this comes up in debate. It's depressing how often someone tries to claim something is a fallacy in order to discredit your whole case.  Anyway, I hoped that helped."
Debate,35p8kh,veyronboss,3,Tue May 12 13:07:28 2015 UTC,"It's a form of ad homeniem fallacy. Whether or not voting is good, desirable, easy, or required, the merits of the complainer's arguments do not depend on whether or not they voted. It's a fair criticism of the person that they should have voted if they feel so strongly about the issue, but that's not a criticism of their argument; attempting to discredit their argument by citing their non-voting is, thus, a fallacy."

Because aff has to prove the resolution true while neg can do a lot of different things. Also, can't you just prove one instance of where individual liberty is more important and then you win? And for that one instance, you could use empirical evidence.  So for the points, how about 'laws can harm individual liberties while also harming society as a whole (societal benefit seems like a logical aff impact) like restricting the right to vote for certain demographics.' And I wouldn't do this personally, but couldn't you escalate the points until it reaches the part where a gov can form a dictatorship in the aff world because laws would be more important than liberties? And then you can say something like ""that's why there should be an equal balance."" Like these may not be solid ideas/cases but that's what came to mind.  EDIT: Also, what about saying that the aff has to prove that ""laws are more important than individual liberties for all?"" And then you can use past examples where the laws don't apply to everyone and how that would continue (e.g. people don't have the freedom to not pay taxes but some still don't, thus implying that their individual freedom of not paying taxes is more important than the laws they're supposed to follow.)"

If they (aff) don't have to prove that laws should apply to all, then wouldn't it be kinda supporting an unequal society which seems like it would contradict a common logical aff (societal benefit). I mean, the aff can also not run societal benefit and then can protest the all or nothing. But like I said, these may not be solid ideas ;)"
Debate,35ctqr,livmoore,4,Sat May 9 21:38:28 2015 UTC,Just look at camp files for a really squirrelly anarchy k and run it.  No one will know what to do.  Or just run a discourse k in conjunction with what you were already planning to run.  Sec k could work great here as I imagine a lot of aff advantages will be increased security through laws.
Debate,35ctqr,veyronboss,3,Sat May 9 04:51:33 2015 UTC,Depends on the debate class. Probably shouldn't do this if the teacher doesn't approve of progressive debate. Anarchy K might be able to be traditionalized if it's run as a libertarian minded anarchy case though (also depends on the format of the debate.. libertarian NC would be strong in LD format) but that's only if the teacher is a little on the conservative side politically.  (If OP trusts the teacher to just be completely tab the annoying anarchy k probs the best suggestion though)
Debate,35ctqr,VisonKai,1 point,Sun May 10 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"Just thinking about this for a few minutes, I would probably center it around that the law doesn't always adequately protect individual liberties. Sure, laws usually encompass and protect liberties (freedom of speech, religion, freedom from being murdered, etc), but sometimes they don't. I'd bring in some extreme examples, (like during the second world war in Germany, concentration camps were totally legal) and more modern, less extreme examples, if you can think of any. Basically, the point is that laws don't always do a good job at protecting individual liberties, and so they can't be more important."

Debate,35ctqr,mjr1234,1 point,Sat May 9 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you could really just turn the 'the law' evidence for a negative. The author argues that laws are a collective. This means that before we establish law, we have to have liberty to base it off of. An enslaved man has no power.  Try to restrict negative to where you don't have to defend super ridiculous types of liberty (to kill, to rape, to steal without just reason, etc.)"
Debate,35ehpw,ToCatchAPredditor_,27,Sat May 9 15:45:51 2015 UTC,"The way to get better at debate is to not do less research. The problem with PF is actually that it requires way too little research. The problem is that PF debaters read cards without understanding the warrants, meaning that there is zero clash in the round. Card battles exist because the research done is not in-depth enough to understand the warrants behind the arguments. This leads to just reading a card without ever explaining why it is good or means that the other team's argument is wrong. PF doesn't need less evidence, it just needs more evidence comparison. It also needs to reward debates that include a lot of great extensions and warrant comparison.   The reason these things don't happen isn't because PF debaters do ""too much research."" The format of PF makes card battles inevitable. A) You simply don't have enough time to have a good debate with warrant comparison. The rebuttals are far too short. B) The entire first two constructives are purposefully non-responsive. The negative doesn't begin to engage in anything the affirmative has to say until the 4th speech of the round. This isn't enough time for arguments to actually develop because the speeches after this are just far too short. This leads to shallow debates in which neither team are doing any sort of macro-level argumentation about who should win the round based off of which arguments they are winning. Even if they are doing this, they are not doing the micro-level argumentation well either because, as stated above, the format of the activity is just not conducive to actual arguments about warrants and evidence comparison.   Regardless, the advice of doing less research is just silly. The best skills debate teaches are debate and critical thinking. This is what you will need in college and eventually in your career. PF already requires almost no research. You shouldn't rob it of what little research it requires."
Debate,35ehpw,shinymuskrat,18,Sat May 9 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"Okay. Since you've given your advice with your record and background, how about I disclose that I took 4th at NFL nats, outperforming everyone else in our state, that we were undefeated until we got to nats, and that our program was two years old?  ""Do less research"" is just wrong. Maybe you did the wrong type of research, but PF is entirely a contest of knowing more about the subject than your opponents. You may have tried to research ""why is X bad"" which is the wrong way. Have you ever just read and read and read, and then asked questions, and looked up answers to those questions? My partner and I knew about state laws as well as relevant federal court cases for inter-state commerce. We knew not just the stats but the breakdown, the ideological skews that played out when researchers disagreed, etc.  I agree that PF is not as card-heavy as policy, but that's not so much a function of research being a bad idea as it is one of high schoolers sucking at cutting and applying cards. If you don't have the fundamentals of debate under your belt, your ""killer card"" will look like a waste of time to the judge; but you should still have that evidence in reserve. A good team will probably cut 3x as many cards as they'll run, because they're just ready for you to invite the debate.  What you're missing is that the actual authors who write in the topic area are also using logic. If you paused to follow their logic, you wouldn't have to reinvent this.  You're looking at your past and thinking what might have been, but you're approaching it wrong. I competed on the college circuit for a competitive team, and the motto ""always be cutting"" was life. You have a ten minute break between classes? It only takes four to get to that class. That's six minutes to cut cards. You finished breakfast early? Cut some cards. THAT is the attitude the successful teams are pushing. However, what you need to know is that in addition, they expect you to understand them. I ran into my coach at a Kroger once, and he asked me why one of the cards from my affirmative (by name, not place in the AC) was correct. When I couldn't answer, he said ""I need to see you for drills tomorrow."""
Debate,35ehpw,sick_burn_bro,6,Sat May 9 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your points and wholeheartedly agree with shinymuskrat. Whenever I have higher quality PF rounds, it always come down to analysis, warrants, logical turns instead of ""my evidence outweighs"" therefore we win. One can easily win a PF round with a lay judge by giving good analysis and a story while making your opponents sound likes fools because they don't know the why/what of their evidence besides the stats. The mindset of the latter degrades the quality of debate and makes it impossible to run creative arguments.  For example, at school recently, I had a practice debate round on the ISIL topic in which my partner and I ran Security Kritik and Unilat. Bad against our TOC team. This kind of debate is much more interesting and requires argumentation, although as shinymuskrat said the time limitations are strangling. I had to spread (relative to reg PF @ ~250 wpm) to be able to fit in my argumentation. This doesn't work with lay judges, although worked great with our coach.

I agree that voters based ENTIRELY on statistics are boring and not compelling but that's not how a majority of good pf rounds end up on the national circuit. Research is extremely important especially if you think it's crucial for debaters to sounds smart (which is true). I think using good stats to then develop a logical story that not only is factually true but is also compelling is what a majority of good debaters have mastered. So ultimately, stats end up being really important especially if you want to sound even the least bit credible. Just my opinion though."

An easy way to get around this is make a huge deal about how lack of methodology makes the evidence useless and stress and nag about it. Your opponents will likely cave.  I'm not sure, but I'm pretty positive speaker points are by person, but it may be by team. It is one of those two.  In order to break at NCFLs you have to be 12-3 or higher.

At most tournaments on the national level, people are hesitant to preside because they are afraid that the judges will overlook them, but this usually isn't true. Most judges at nationals will probably have experience judging congress and know when they see a good P.O. So when who want to move around the docket, just say that you'll P.O for session 2 as long as they move the bill you really like into session 1 while taking the bill that you don't like that much out of session 1.

Debate,34unc4,Hope_Homesick,1 point,Fri May 8 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"A stock, unmodified Mac (one I'd get from an Apple store, or a tech store) runs OS X, which is a UNIX operating system. This makes it basically unsuspectable to major viruses, and, viruses that are meant for windows. Although even the strong UNIX can be infected, it's highly unlikely compared to Windows.  However, Windows may be the strongest in terms of usage. Definitely not in security, but... compatibility. Most companies make software for Windows, x86 or x64 bit software, and while Mac software is distributed as well, it has a much more limited library than Windows. As well, a number of video games run only on Windows. That being said, some video games still do run on Macs. I'm pretty sure you can get a (buggy but good) Windows emulator for the Mac.  Macs often tend to run faster, and not because of some wizardy hardware, but the way they're structured digitally, and the people they're used by. However, Windows computers can run just as fast if you put in some extra work to keep it clean.  They're both good computers. Though, I would recommend a Windows because it doesn't supply with any exclusivity issues. It also continues what the old IBM copy metaphor stood for: make it better, but make it compatible."

Debate,34rz52,joejackdebate,8,Mon May 4 02:46:29 2015 UTC,"Lets start with Rebuttal. At higher levels you have to do more than just refute the opponents arguments. Many top level debaters will give an overview before digging into contentions. This might give burdens for the other team to meet or establish why some arguments are more important. Some do this as an underview but in my (humble) opinion, it works better at the top.  Within the core of your rebuttal you need to start weighing arguments (using timescale, probability, magnitude, threshold). Even if your impacts are climate change and theirs are nuclear war, you need to weigh and compare seemingly separate arguments so your judge can make a decision if both you and your opponents have offense. Make your offense matter more than theirs, and that starts in rebuttal."
Debate,34rz52,EasternZone,5,Mon May 4 04:33:00 2015 UTC,"My experience might not be the best but here goes nothing: Really everything is just elevated. There's not much that changes, but there's better execution of what needs to happen in the round (i.e: less dropped arguments, better use of time management, understanding of what cards need to be read, and what those cards actually mean). More technical kids start to move away from the cost-benefit analysis or utilitarian frameworks that populate most novice rounds (if a framework is read at all). The line-by-line is generally the way to go with rebuttals: addressing your opponents' points in the order they were read, and having a number of responses to them. Final Focuses are still about extending the right pieces of evidence, and crystalizing the debate to the best of your ability. While some teams do get more creative with their approaches, the general rule of thumb is that Varsity is just a more experienced group of PF debaters, with no format changes."

They tore it up at Stanford too.   Their ability to crystallize the round at the end of the debate and extend key lines of offense is unparalleled by most teams and they are of very high caliber. They're more of a ""lay"" team (probably because they're in California) and that disadvantages them in some ways (they don't spread), but it also gives them huge advantages. I remember a couple of posts ago, people (I think from MSJ and Amador) were arguing how MSJ has never beaten them, and a lot of it was blamed on lay judges.

Debate,34hca7,anpack,5,Fri May 1 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"Google Scholar is a great place to start. If your school's library has any subscription to academic databases (LexisNexis is fantastic to look through)  You don't want to rely on getting evidence from NYT, WP, or any news sources unless it is a hyper-timely topic (refer to NSDA Nats 2014) instead, for high quality evidence, look through Academic Journals, Think Tank publications, and Working Papers."
Debate,34hca7,lbt86,2,Fri May 1 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of those articles on the NYT, WP, etc. often provide insightful information and often cite studies which you can access through the articles themselves."
Debate,34hca7,Christiangruz,5,Fri May 1 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"I've found a good place to start is actually on wikipedia articles. They link to a lot of other good articles that you can actually cite.   Additionally, google and google scholar yield really good results, and you can limit the time on google pretty easily. If you click ""search tools"" on google you can narrow your results by date (IE 'within the past year' etc) and this will bring up more recent (and better) results. Also, you can find some great articles in the reference section of research papers.   Also, if you have access to databases like lexis nexis, ebscohost, etc, these are great places to find research. Most school libraries have subscriptions to at least a couple of databases, if you're enrolled in dual credit courses at colleges you have access to all of their subscriptions. Most public libraries also let you access these databases for free with a library card/free membership of some sort."

In order to find good evidence, you have to be prepared to read a LOT. Just read a lot to learn, and the evidence will show itself.  Additionally for impact cards, check out the Open Evidence Library and download some basic impact files. Policy debaters pass around the same impact cards from year to year and they're usually pretty good. Really the only topic-specific research you'll need to do is for the uniqueness/links."

Less glibly, it doesn't solve the problem but it does give tools to the debaters (and coaches) who attend to resist and undo it, and helps people to psychologically cope and overcome some of the damage that patriarchy entails.

Debate,34epk9,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,9,Thu Apr 30 17:38:17 2015 UTC,"...  There's no ""less chance of going to camp"" going on here. Nobody is taking camp slots away from anyone, these are new camp slots that are being funded to give women in debate a chance to attend a camp that they otherwise might not be able to go to. Moreover, it helps to even out a male dominated world in camps and debate in general. This is, no matter how you try to cut it, a good thing."

Having seen numbers from a number of camps. There is also absolutely a gender gap in participation in debate, especially at the upper level. These things go hand in hand.  B. When substantive reforms are being done across the competitive field to even these participation gaps out then, maybe, the WDI will be superfluous. As long as A is true then the WDI is doing good."

Any coach going there that judges already sure as hell doesn't do anything sexist intentionally or unintentionally.   No, this is not a judge issue. Try again.  There is a gap in:   The number of women who are in debate. The competitive level which women reach. The hospitality of the community directed towards women participants. The number of women who attend camps.   and more. (And this is to say nothing about the community's lack of response towards issues of sexual and gender harassment.)  Having the WDI directly addresses these issues by encouraging women to stay in debate, giving women a social and supportive atmosphere, helping them to reach higher levels of competitive success, and teaching coping/survival strategies to help deal with an otherwise inhospitable debate community. These are all good things.  And, even if the WDI cannot solve these things alone there's only a risk it makes these things better and no chance it makes it worse."

Debate,343qen,nerdierthanyou,2,Tue Apr 28 03:49:42 2015 UTC,"It requires a policy judge. Other than that, it works pretty much the same as a k in any other event. This one works very well, since every team I've encountered just tacitly assumes that invading another country without their consent is something that the United States can and should do without argument or protest. I would advise staying as topical as possible, and being prepared to explain yourself well in crossfire for teams that may have not hit a k before."
Debate,343qen,debatrrrr,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"Overall, really interesting. I like the unique approach to the resolution. I just wrote some of my thoughts, and wouldn't mind discussing the K if you would like.   I have couple of concerns on the link - It seems like affirming the resolution isn't inherently a use of military power without another nation's consent, for example, committing ground troops could be in the best interest of the United States as well as the best interests of some of the countries that the ground troops are committed to. In addition, you claim that america is ""killing its own citizens"" but the aff is likely to provide a cost benefit analysis that shows why the use of America troops prevented much larger harms.  Also, you say ""Americans don't have to follow rules that apply to everyone else"" but what is so different about Britain or some other nation intervening? If other nations regularly break the ""rules"" so what is unique about American Exceptionalism? I understand that the topic limits the discussion to the U.S. but if other countries also don't follow the rules, I don't think there is a link to the impact.   Lastly, it's not clear exactly what ""rules"" the U.S. is not following. Can the U.S. ever intervene? If so, when? If not, the world of the alt seems much less attractive as the U.S. wouldn't be able to intervene to stop human rights abuses, genocide, etc.   Nice k, thanks for sharing."
Debate,343qen,eslondon,2,Wed Apr 29 02:58:50 2015 UTC,"With regards to the link, Bashar Al-Assad has made it very clear that he does not want US troops to operate in Syria. Therefore, committing US troops as the resolution specifies would be an act of war, regardless of how it might benefit the Syrian people or government.  The difference is that the American foreign policy machine, as explained in the Greenwald card, doesn't follow the rules. Everybody thinks that because America is the Greatest Country to Ever Exist in the History of Ever, they have no obligation to follow the rules. Other countries look to international law when deciding whether to intervene; the United States does not. Even if other countries also don't follow the rules, the impacts are still real. The US still gets involved in endless conflicts and still kills a lot of people.  Finally on the alt, the k is purely pre-fiat: we admit that no US government policy changes will take place as a result of negating (or affirming), so it doesn't create that world at all."

By coming here, we've agreed to debate the assigned resolution, which is often a current issue in American politics.  Public Forum is an American event rarely practiced elsewhere, so my opponent's kritik of the resolution is irresolutional and unjustified."""

Debate,342a9k,panzercaptain,5,Mon Apr 27 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"Most of the judges I had at Nats were parent judges, and even a few coaches (though almost all for speaking events). I wouldn't bet on many flow judges even through the first couple out rounds, and you may get lucky after that because I believe they begin to pref coaches towards the later rounds."

Judging is region locked, meaning if you are from a region, for me the south east, you cannot be judged by a judge from that region. You'll only get judged outside that region, I tend to get west coast/Midwest"

Make sure to exclude jargon and debate rhetoric from the round. You and your partner need to make sure not to have any fluency breaks when you give your speeches, because you can be downed because of it. Remember that debate is a public speaking event so the speech is a big part of it."
Debate,340p55,NiereSon,3,Mon Apr 27 11:27:51 2015 UTC,"Hi!  If you don't mind me asking, what country are you from? The debate in your country may differ from another, in the same way Britian has a much different typical style of debate than America. Be sure the podcasts you have listened to talk about the style of debate you want to teach, and make sure that style of debate is actually practiced in your country.  It would help to have a solid foundation and understanding of how debate works before you start teaching and start a club. If you are an underclassman, or someone early on in their high school career, get a year of studying and practicing debate under your belt before you start your club. It makes the whole process easier if you know what you are talking about, and school administrations are usually more generous with funding for a club that can be well represented and easily explained by its leader.  Assuming you can get the club started, I'd recommend offering and teaching events that would resonate with your student body. If you find a lot of students in your school are involved in theater, offer speech, or I.E, events. If people tend to be more analytic, learn and then teach the debate events. Conform to what is going to get you the most members possible, so you can give your club some strength early on.   P.M me with any questions about what I said or how I phrased certain things. English isn't my first language either, I remember those struggles!"
Debate,340p55,purkamern,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:17:17 2015 UTC,"What country are you from? Would like to know so I can give additional information. Is there a ""debating society"" or something like that? In my country there is a single NGO that delegates all debate clubs under itself and holds tournaments - any idea if you have something like that? If you do, contact them, they will probably help. Read about debate. I'm assuming you're from Europe, I'd recommend reading different guides on different formats.    a) World Schools Debating Championship Format - One of the main formats for highschoolers in Europe.  b) British Parliamentary - Mainly for uni students, but I'd still recommend it.  c) Karl Popper - Prevalent in Eastern Europe and Asia. Was used in my country for years, hated it entirely.  d) Australs format - Popular in Australia and Asia, similar to WSDC.  Where to read?  http://howtodebate.blogspot.co.uk/  http://idebate.org/sites/live/files/9781617700163-web.pdf  http://betterdebatemanual.wix.com/better  http://www.monashdebaters.com/downloads/AADG.pdf   http://www.sofiadebaters.com/docs/default-source/textbooks-and-guidelines/debating-world-schools1.pdf?sfvrsn=4 -   Introduce debate to people in your school. Go class to class talking about it, should help you get people interested.   /Edit - Heres a whole guide on how to start your debate club, by IDEA.   http://www.ru.idebate.org/about/debate/startclub  /Edit2 - If there is no ""set"" format in your country and debate is REALLY new. I'd suggest picking out a format for your club which you should run, since if there is no debate ""scene"" per se, tournaments probably aren't run by a single entity or so. If you have to pick a format, I'd go with the WSDC one.  It consists of two teams with 3 members, proposition and opposition. Both sides have 3 constructive speeches (8mins long) and two reply speeches (4mins long), that either the first or second speaker give, the opposition goes first with it. The format relies on evidence (for prepared motions), persuasiveness, team consistency and most importantly, solid logic for your arguments."

Debate,33pp5d,sick_burn_bro,5,Fri Apr 24 14:17:07 2015 UTC,A short history of the United states by Robert v Remini is a great tool for looking at the us government and how politics emerged. You'll only need to read from the 1960s on though to truly understand modern politics and such. It should be mentioned this book is written with an admitted liberal bias
Debate,33pp5d,MisterBenis,5,Fri Apr 24 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"For international relations, I'd recommend ""The Next Decade"" by George Friedman, which looks forward, but references recent history to justify its position.  Another option would be ""The Tragedy of Great Power Politics,"" by John Mearscheimer, which is incredibly dense.   An absolutely necessary book for debaters and extempers is ""Naked Economics"" by Charles Wheelan.   Looking into the past is useful, but honestly, I'd just recommend you read an AP world history textbook for anything comprehensive past the 80's."
Debate,33pp5d,Jfqian,2,Sat Apr 25 04:37:29 2015 UTC,A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn is a fire social revisionist view of American history
Debate,33pp5d,fedorasean,2,Fri May 1 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"tl;dr Read specific books efficiently and train yourself to think like a historian so your use of the past makes some sort of sense.  Policy history major here, although I never been on a debate team, I've participated in my fair share of debates and policy and business case studies, not to mention history is all about arguing about the past until you're blue in the face. Since you're probably going to want something different for every topic, here is /r/askhistorians book list. There is a modern section for pretty much every topic.   While it is certainly fun to read the more general history books and they have some value, you would probably want to look at more specific books for anything useful.   Two more quick notes, your ability to use history in debate is going to be much better if you have some idea of historiography and the historical method. Here is AH's recommended historiography books. I like giving John Lewis Gaddis' Landscapes of History to people interested in this. It's a very quick and entertaining read and makes for a nice introduction to the topic, despite some issues with it. It'll get you in the historian mindset.   I believe it's very important for you to do this. Plenty of people ""know"" history, but have little understanding of what to do with their knowledge. Having even a little bit of understanding of that will help you tremendously and help you stay out of /r/badhistory (which is another source for training yourself to think like a historian, but in a very humorous way).  My other piece of advice, which you probably already have some idea of, is that you probably should read the entirety of a book unless it's extraordinarily important for you. Read the intro and conclusion of a book so you know the argument and some idea of the evidence brought up. Figure out what info seems most useful to you and go through the table of contents and look at the chapter names. What are the most useful chapters for your argument? Read those chapters, starting with their intro and conclusions and then reading through the chapter. This is called gutting a book and is the savior of history majors and grad students everywhere. There's other methods which may work better or worse for you, but this is probably the most efficient for your purposes.  If you ever have any questions, let me know."

Assuming you're talking about the April topic, as aff you'll mostly want to block arguments that say local forces will defeat ISIL, because it's not too hard to paint the picture of ISIL going around killing people and causing general instability. As neg, you should be blocking stuff about the effectiveness of US ground forces and the long-term impacts for the US and the region.  The only weird argument I've seen on this topic is one where the neg said that instability in the ME led to a stronger US oil business. In most cases this puts your opponent in a double bind, because defeating ISIL outweighs that stuff."

Whether you're doing extemp, PF, Policy, or even OO, judge adaptation is an integral part of forensics- with that being said, there are similarities across all styles (I'll cover debate events specifically) to figure out and adapt to your judge.  Don't:  -Ask the judge if they ""have any paradigms"". Most judges will either: a.) Not know what a ""paradigm"" is; or b.) Not want to have to explain their paradigm in depth. These judges will just prefer specific questions.  -Disregard any paradigm they gave pre-round (If they don't like speed, and you decide to spread, that's on you)  -Confuse the judge  -Bad mouth the judge outside of the round. Follow the 10-10 rule, you want to be at least 10 minutes, or 10 miles away from someone until you start talking shit. What goes around comes around, especially in a close knit community like debate.  Do:  -Realize what tournament you're competing at, and know what to expect from the judge pool (even though there are always exceptions to this)  -If you can access the judge paradigms out-of-round (tournament books, strike sheet, iDebate, judgephilosophies.com, etc), definitely go that route and do your work early.  -Ask specific questions to the judge/panel (i.e. How does the judge feel about framework?, Do they have any prior judging experience?, Do they accept theory?, etc)  -Keep track of old ballots. Having one judge multiple times over your debate career can be a blessing, or a curse.  -Write down the judges feedback (if verbal) after the round.  -Have a personality. Most judges like debaters that aren't simply robots. Don't be overbearing, but definitely be genuine.  Hope this helps out! Good luck"

Debate,3361kt,pfballer,2,Sun Apr 19 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"It's a fantastic camp; I really recommend that you go.  I have gone twice and both of my summers were different. The first time around I was a pretty unknown sophomore. I was placed in top lab and learned an absolute ton. The lab leaders were super informative and it was really obvious that they knew how to coach and that they had a lot of success. The junior staff was very chill - there was an equal amount of time between learning from them and straight up hanging out with them. The second summer was a bit different in that I had a pretty successful season. They already knew who I was so they gave me special treatment, but it was still really chill and I had a great time nonetheless.   Overall I really enjoyed myself at ISD. It was very laid-back, which is honestly what you want in a debate camp experience (after all, it's the summer. Why would you want stress?) Even though you don't feel like you're doing a lot of work, you come out of it with a lot of insight on your style as a debater and excellent skills across the board. I definitely attribute ISD to my successful senior year."
Debate,336flo,ChocolateDelight,4,Mon Apr 20 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"I have two things.  First, the article is about immigrants, not illegal immigrants.  It says twenty billion dollars came from emigrants, which is the same number they attribute to illegals.  So the article is falsely assuming that everyone is am illegal immigrant skewing the data.  Second, just because people spend money elsewhere does not mean that they are not contributing to the economy.  Five people could send twenty dollars of their hundred dollar salary home, or one could send back all of their salary.  We need to look at percentage of wages sent back compared to the percentage of wages not spent by a average American, not a straight number, because those four hundred left over dollars from the five immigrants could still contribute more to the economy than the money that comes from frugal Americans."
Debate,336flo,Arrianus,3,Mon Apr 20 01:05:44 2015 UTC,Generally wages are given in turn for labor. So the emigrants are still giving labor to the market/economy but their compensation is flowing out of the country. This takes away the multiplicative effect of consumer spending but still gives the original labor into the market economy.
Debate,336flo,Dababy345,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"You might argue that all those wages being sent back are preventing the appearance of an even more radically poor, unstable hell hole of a third world country existing just below America. That money might be a lot cheaper than having to occupy a failed state on the southern edge of U.S. territory. Some of the money going there finds its way back to the US through the profits (and resulting share price increases) of American companies providing services there. I don't think the jobs Americans are losing (tech-related, service industry, manufacturing) are the ones illegal immigrants take on (lawn waterer, cement pourer, car parker)."

Debate,32xivg,le_beards,15,Fri Apr 17 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"Judge here.  1) Answer the question.  You know, the one you drew half an hour ago?  That one.  Not some other related question on your mind that your files support.  Say something like, ""Which brings us to today's question: 'Should we thank Obama?' We can see that the answer is yes for three key reasons....""  2) Congrats!  You've answered the question (again, the question you were asked) and given me a thesis (""yes, we should thank Obama"") and three key reasons. You are making a good impression on me.  Now what do I want?  Analysis.  You're debaters, you should have this.  Make your tags an argument.  So, for example, ""We should thank Obama because of the economy"" is a shitty tag.  Obama made an economy?  Wooooooo! Try ""We should thank Obama because his economic policies have had a direct positive influence on the lives of Americans.""  A claim! Whee! NOW give me evidence.  3) You're doin' well here.  You've answered the question you were asked and you've made some arguments.  Now what?  It's time to .... transition!  Remember, I'm a debate judge and I'm buried in a ballot/flowing/counting sources.  I don't fucking look at debaters and I rarely look at extempers.  So in addition to walking in a triangle, give me a verbal transition.  ""Now that we've thanked Obama for pushing strong economic policy we should also thank him for improving foreign policy.""   Ok, cool.  Now I know that you're going to move from economics to foreign policy.  Mmmmkay.  But if you really want to get my 1 in the round use that transition sentence to build your analysis.  How is Obama's thank-worthy economic policy related to your next point? An extemp speech is not a long 1AC with separate contentions. Link the three points together in a unified analysis.  So you could say something like ""We should thank Obama because he is a strong relationship builder"" as your thesis and then go to ""Now that we have seen Obama's consensus building skills in the domestic economy, we can also see how he has built relationships abroad.""  4) International Extempers and Econ Rounds: Now before I continue, I want to tell you that I love extemp. I beg to be put in an extemp final every time I judge.  I have a soft spot for the Economist and I give accurate time signals.  Having served on many final round panels, I know that some people would rather be in the DI round.  They're not on top of this shit.  NX rounds are more accessible to lay extemp judges who don't follow the news.  However, IX and econ (NX and IX econ rounds) need some background.  In your introduction give a little bit of background.  For example, if the question is ""what will be the long term impacts of the Boko Haram kidnappings"" don't assume the lay judge knows what that event is!  Give us some background on the terrorists, what they did and what the current status is.  Spend 30 seconds to do this.  Also may be helpful for econ and tech rounds.  Even though I'm not a lay judge I appreciate hearing the background because it shows that you know what the fuck is going on.  The extemper who told me ""net neutrality is bad because businesses want it and they'll make more money and they don't want to""... right idea.  Wrong information. Have my 5.  Ok, so now you've answered the question (what question? The question you were fucking asked, not some other question), provided some analysis (not evidence cards) and transitioned between points.  You've even provided some background for the judge too busy with DI rounds to follow NPR.  Cool.  You're really close to getting my upper ranks, some nice comments and a hefty pile of speaker points.  But you want my 1, right?  You want me to know that your shit is in order and you are the best mothafuckin' extemper in the room.  You want me to know that you can extemp on anything.  Cool.  Pull out your LD files.  Give me some philosophy or law or history.  Give me a broad general principle.  Talk about laws, talk about court decisions.  For example, if the question is about Indiana's RFRA, connect that to Plessy v. Ferguson and the history of laws on discrimination in public accommodations in the USA.  Extemp questions aren't generally about completely new issues.  The same shit keeps coming up.  Over and over.  Same shit, different envelope.  Show me how you know history, politics and culture.  That will set you apart and THAT, my extemper friends, will get you my 1.  Go out.  Get my 1.  PS. Don't mumble.  Act confident. Balance your time across intro/conclusion/points.  Cite sources.  Cite real sources. Wear a suit.  Look like your shit is together."

They have corporate partnerships that sponsor it but also serve as talent development for the companies while teaching skills. This in turn means that more people have access to technical fields. It increases our STEM capacity. It gives more opportunities. This also can be tied into arguments about how unprepared graduates are for work. These programs can give graduates a venue to showcase their skills, but also mitigates the growing inaccessibility of college education in areas such as tech."

My partner and I used something called ""hedonic pricing"" to quantify the human benefit/quality of life impacts. Basically, its like a logarithmic measurement of real estate changes in an area isolated to represent the introduction of positive externalities (like the presence of sports stadiums) in communities. Kinda a way to see how people value the sports stadiums (people pay more for increased utility; housing in a ""better"" area becomes more expensive, since some house buyers are more willing to cough up the dough for a new home if their favorite sports team plays near it).

Basically we said that ISIL is going to fail, what matters is who does it. We found cards that said if regional forces take the job of defeating ISIL, it's going to cause more ethnic war and instability. This is because the Kurds would have to annex land to successfully defeat ISIL, and this would spark a Kurdish-Arab conflict. Also, if Iran exerts their power to defeat ISIL, it would only increase Iranian hegemony, which in turn would exacerbate Sunni-Shiite conflict. We argued that if the US did it, we could avoid all these problems and there would be more long term stability."

Debate,326iae,layasfuk,4,Sat Apr 11 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"Karankaushal has probably got it right to some degree.  With a couple exceptions you aren't going to go from having a stock issues circuit to a super K friendly circuit super quick.  This means that the more ""stock""/generic/policy friendly K's are more likely to be hit.  Thus prepping specific answers to those seems like a good first step.  In general: Framework: policymaking good (normally wouldn't advise, but in a circuit like yours), permutation, and the fact that the alternative solves neither the links nor the aff seems like the way to go."
Debate,326iae,backcountryguy,3,Sat Apr 11 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, we aren't looking to switch to regularly running K's in our league- we're comfortable, and reasonably good at doing the standard level stuff. We just want to be at least somewhat ready for what we'll probably hit at the state tournament.  Would you agree with the above comment that having some answers to those two K's would probably keep us safe? Or are there other stock one's you'd suggest?"
Debate,326iae,backcountryguy,2,Sat Apr 11 19:00:33 2015 UTC,"Heck if I know. I've seen like 3 debates on this topic.  In days of eld I would say cap is pretty much the only stock K across topics, but on this one being ready for anthro and perhaps some kritik of the way we deal with environmental issues are what I'd suspect you might need to deal with."
Debate,326iae,attikous,4,Sat Apr 11 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"I'll play devils advocate and disagree to this. Our local circuit wasn't one that likes the K much, but my senior year we said fuck it and started running the K in any highflow neg rounds, and went 14-1 on it in the first 6 months. You can change peoples minds with the K, that's why its an argument. But people grab k's like anthro off the bat and start reading it down a shell, which is why they don't understand the k and can't sell it in a way that would cause a community to want to listen to it. So my advice for running the k is to read all the lit that you'll read in round, front to back. You should be able to recite all of the evidence with out cards in your own words. Then, after you cut that ev, make your 2nc/2nr blocks to it before you make the 1nc shell, that way you read the 1nc with purpose, instead of just reading a generic shell and having to do too much link work in the block. Then just do rounds to practice. As for answering the k, write some kickass theory for perm, status, and procedurals (which would include framework) and use that as your offense and then use some defense or turns to the k. Hope that helps!"
Debate,326iae,attikous,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:31:58 2015 UTC,"Could you be a bit more specific in terms of the theory for perm/status/procedurals? I'm aware of what a perm is and how it works, but what exactly do the others entail?"

Debate,31p2bg,MythicalAlot,2,Tue Apr 7 17:56:30 2015 UTC,I don't have much confidence in Bronx CD. Saw them at Emory and felt that the first speaker of their team was really lacking. Also if anyone checks their evidence it's game over
Debate,31p2bg,Clusterfist,0,Tue Apr 7 18:43:29 2015 UTC,But their speaks are so damn high.
Debate,31p2bg,MythicalAlot,2,Tue Apr 7 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"Yea I know, the second speaker deserves it. He flows very well and speaks conversationally. He says things like, ""ready, cool beans."" It works. The first speaker kinda trailed the second and come off as kind of douchey. Don't get me wrong, he is a fantastic speaker, but when compared to teams like Whitman AA, Miami Beach SM, Princeton MO they will be going against great first and second speakers. We can look to Emory finals as an example where a great summary vs a good summary can cost the round."
Debate,31p2bg,Clusterfist,2,Tue Apr 7 19:43:30 2015 UTC,I watched that round too and I totally agree with you. I honestly think the first speaker was just having an off day but the fact he couldn't answer basic questions about his own case did not look good. Also they dropped one of their contentions in that round which is just sloppy debating.

I also don't like the idea of lists like these. It contributes to idolizing certain debaters, making it so its harder for judges to drop them, and also doesn't actually reflect the quality of the debaters.  the key to success at toc is not ""past success"" or ""a large team""  walt whitman aa helped close out last year while at larging pine view won the year before that  without, either of those.  at this point in debate everybody knows everybody. getting flows is ridiculously easy.  these list are basically just fandom lists of who seems to have done well on the circuit this year, not who actually stacks up well against other good teams, specific teams, or who is good at toc type debate. there are a few teams you guys mentioned who absolutely will not do well at toc, even if they've done well throughout the year.  please, don't engage in this type of thing."

Debate,319stg,MetropolitanVanuatu,0,Sat Apr 4 04:24:31 2015 UTC,"Fairmont KP is an excellent team but they may have issues with adaptation and hitting a team multiple times (if they break). This was particularly noticeable at ASU, if I remember correctly.  BASIS is good as well, but they haven't faced very stiff competition to the extent that most of the NorCal teams have. It will be interesting to see how they respond."
Debate,319stg,Cisosophy,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you for the most part, I've watched both teams debate and they have the potential to do well this year, but even if they don't I'm pretty sure both teams are juniors and can do well next year. But I think they have a few advantages that other West coast teams don't. Fairmont has a lot of experience debating East coast teams cause they went to upenn and glenbrooks and Basis has been in a ton of bid rounds this year and also broke at glenbrooks."
Debate,319stg,hoac23,0,Sun Apr 5 02:01:33 2015 UTC,"That's a good point on Fairmont and the East Coast teams; that may be helpful for them. What do you think about some of the one time (or non-powerhouse) NorCal schools, like Amador, Foothill, Los Altos, or Nueva? I doubt they have much of a shot to go far, but I think a couple could potentially break."
Debate,319stg,MetropolitanVanuatu,0,Sun Apr 5 03:35:09 2015 UTC,"I think they have a lot of potential to do well, but they need to adapt much more for the east coast judges. The big problem is that west coast debate often boils down to impacts and just throwing out numbers whereas a lot of east-coast judges/coaches want a lot of warrant debating. Unless the west coast teams can jump that gap between extensions of just impacts and warrant-level analysis I doubt they have much hope at the TOC. For the teams you mentioned, I think Los Altos has a chance of breaking but I don't think Amador, Foothil, or Nueva have enough nat circuit experience (at least this year) to do well.   That's also why I mention BASIS and Fairmont. Because when I say those teams I saw them do warrant level debates."
Debate,319stg,Cisosophy,0,Fri Apr 3 07:17:00 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I've seen the top west coast teams engage in pretty good warrant debate when they hit each other in front of flow judges, but that's probably not enough to really get the experience necessary to be as good at warrant debate as some of the East Coast teams who see it more frequently."
Debate,319stg,MetropolitanVanuatu,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:24:51 2015 UTC,I think you guys are forgetting about Harker BR and CH also. They have 3 bids and 4 bids respectively and BR has beaten some top teams like Durham YD and Fairmont KP

Debate,30zzw1,losingmyshirt,10,Wed Apr 1 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"To rectify some confusion in the comments section here - to qualify to the Tournament of Champions you have to make it to a certain level of outround at a tournament that is competitive enough to be designated a ""bid"" tournament. You need to do that twice, and get two ""bids"" to qualify to the tournament. For example, if I made it to quarterfinals of a tournament that gave bids in quarterfinals, I'd get a bid. But if I made it to quarterfinals of a tournament that is designated a semifinals bid, I wouldn't get a bid.  So, if you get one bid, yet still want to attend to the TOC, you may apply for an ""at large"" in which the TOC gives you another bid so you can attend without actually getting to ""bids"" from tournaments. Not everyone who applies gets in, and it's a competitive field of really great debaters that are ranked by a committee at the TOC to figure out who gets the at larges."

Debate,30zzw1,Fire_monger,3,Wed Apr 1 04:05:24 2015 UTC,"Someone answered this above but just to repeat, the TOC committee evaluates tournaments all over the country and based upon degree of difficulty/field size, gives them certain bid levels. The most difficult/largest tournaments are octofinals bids and more local smaller-scale tournaments are semis or finals bids. If a tournament is an octas bid (take Yale for example), then debaters need to reach octafinals to get a bid (so if they last through double octafinals, they receive a bid). If you have at least two bids (or if you're auto-qualled by breaking at the TOC, Nats, or CFL Nats the previous year), then you are guaranteed a spot at the TOC. For the many teams that only get one bid, there is an alternative route called the at-large. For the at-large, teams need to fill out an application listing win/loss records at tournaments throughout the year, record against top teams/teams that also have bids, etc. The coach of the team is also allowed to submit a one-page letter explaining why they should be accepted and any extenuating circumstances. For example, one of the teams that got accepted for Public Forum only had one bid, but they also had like 4 other bid rounds that they lost on 2-1 decisions against top teams in the country. Additionally they had a really good record against other teams that had bids and were consistently good throughout the year. Other teams got accepted because they were only able to go to very few tournaments due to location/financial/etc. and demonstrated that despite the small pool of tournaments, they were still able to do well and receive a bid.  TL;DR do well at specific tournaments throughout the year"

Debate,30z7fz,Callisto_Star,8,Tue Mar 31 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"Where do Iraq and Saddam Hussein fit into this?    The Hussein part of this question is much easier to answer. Saddam Hussein was, above all, a Ba'athist ideologically. Baath governments (like Hussein, Nasser, and Assad) are both totalitarian and secular. Hussein fits into the ISIL equation in two ways. One, he made a lot of enemies in the Islamic movement during his time. The institutions and groups that became ISIL were and are opposed to Ba'athists. Second, AQI, later ISIL, was able to come to power in the power vacuum left after Hussein left. He was by all accounts a very bad guy, but Saddam Hussein knew how to keep order in Iraq.   With all that said, Hussein is definitely on the lower end of important things for this resolution.   And what state is Iraq in politically?   It sucks. The problems in Iraq could be traced back to the end of WWI. With the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the UK and France divided up the Middle East for themselves. After WWII, colonies were no longer the hip thing, so Europe decided to leave the Middle East.   For the longest time, the Levant had been ruled by Middle Eastern empires (Abbasid, Umayad, Ottoman, and British/French), not by nation-states that are the archetype today.   This imperial history and the rapid withdrawl of the post-war Brits combined in the creation of artificial ""countries"" like Iraq. Jon Stewart got it right here. The concept of ""Iraq"" does not carry any real historical weight. It really would look more like this if you followed the traditional societal lines of the area.  This partitioning and amalgamation has led to extraordinary sectarian violence in Iraq in the past few years. One incarnation of this violence is ISIL, which fights for the Sunni side, as opposed to the Shia or Kurdish sides.  Much of the violence in post-colonial Africa has the same cause   Who are its political enemies   The Shia (Iran), the Kurds, the Ba'athists, Israel, Saudi Arabia, the US, the rest of the West (especially France), and anyone who stands in the way of a Sunni Caliphate.   and how is this related to the U.S?   That's the debate."

Debate,30nfwj,aatanaka28,10,Sun Mar 29 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"Technically, no CPs are allowed in PF. However, alternative advocacies are perfectly fine.  Quoting someone from a thread about running alternatives that I posted yesterday:   In a round, it's better to frame ""alternatives"" in PFD as lost opportunity, or an opportunity cost. E.g. - if you make X decision, then you can't make Y decision, and you lose all the lives plan Y saves, and all the money plan Y saves. Most judges are pretty open to an alternative advocacy if you frame it as a lost opportunity, and most opponents won't reflexively shout ""counterplans aren't allowed in PF."" It's the philosophical grounding of a Counterplan anyways, but it makes infinitely more sense to a judge. The practice of saying ""no counterplans allowed"" was based on a lazy reading of rules and the promise of an easy argument.   I haven't done any march prep, but as far as April goes, alternatives include cutting off ISIL's cash flow, increasing air strikes, strengthening regional actors (i.e. Kurds and Iraqis), and letting ISIL solve itself. The latter two are pretty much just letting the status quo continue."

You can't isolate the impact directly from community colleges and so you can't draw a substantial impact from it. Furthermore, it also falls to a no access contention that Neg is likely to run anyways in that students won't be getting into these community colleges anyways."
Debate,30gpx7,nerdierthanyou,16,Fri Mar 27 05:46:21 2015 UTC,"The NSDA doesn't actually ban alternative advocacies.  If you read the actual event rules, the NSDA bans counterplans AND plans. What the NSDA actually wants to prevent is people narrowing the scope of the resolution to fit a specific plan or counterplan, like what is required in Policy, where a resolution asking for ocean exploration would be whittled into an Aff plan about deep sea mining.  Policy Debate is focused on a broad resolution, with the Aff presenting a specific advocacy within the topic area of the resolution. They want to prevent the same thing in Public Forum, and essentially have the debate treat the resolution as a simple statement of truth.   Besides, if the vague advocacy ""letting regional actors solve"" is a ""counterplan,"" then the resolution itself would be a ""plan"" and would not be allowed by NSDA rules, since it has an actor and an action.  In a round, it's better to frame ""alternatives"" in PFD as lost opportunity, or an opportunity cost. E.g. - if you make X decision, then you can't make Y decision, and you lose all the lives plan Y saves, and all the money plan Y saves. Most judges are pretty open to an alternative advocacy if you frame it as a lost opportunity, and most opponents won't reflexively shout ""counterplans aren't allowed in PF."" It's the philosophical grounding of a Counterplan anyways, but it makes infinitely more sense to a judge.  The practice of saying ""no counterplans allowed"" was based on a lazy reading of rules and the promise of an easy argument.  TL;DR - you're never going to technically get into CP territory, and even if your judge believes otherwise, you should frame your alternative as an opportunity cost."

Debate,30gpx7,Jfqian,5,Sun Mar 29 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why one couldn't do both. Along those lines,  the reason why counterplans are strategic in policy is because they (presumably) solve all or part of the affirmative and avoid some sort of disadvantage. If you aren't fiatting that, say, regional actors send troops to fight ISIS then I'm not sure what saying ""it would be nice if regional actors would send troops to fight ISIS"" since that wouldn't solve the aff case. On the other hand, if you do try to fiat that regional actors fill in, then you have to grapple with all the theoretical reasons why fiat in pf is bad."
Debate,30gpx7,ribwomberly,3,Fri Mar 27 06:12:45 2015 UTC,"In this specific case, the disad of sending in US troops would be something like increasing anti-western sentiment. In my experience fiat is assumed in PF, since otherwise you can't really do much because no theory and no kritiks."
Debate,30gpx7,ribwomberly,2,Fri Mar 27 06:32:19 2015 UTC,"I guess at this point it depends on what you mean by ""getting too deep into counterplan territory."" It seems to me like either you fiat that other nations supply troops which is a counterplan, OR you don't solve any of the aff case because the judge has no way of controlling whether or not other nations supply troops.   Of course, all of this quibbling could be obviated if pf would get over its aversion to plans..."

Debate,30gpx7,Clusterfist,3,Fri Mar 27 12:17:11 2015 UTC,"You really can't advocate a counter plan. However you may be able to woe some judges into believing that your argument isn't a plan. A good trick is to make your advocacy seem so minor. ""We're not advocating passing House Resolution 14223 that would fund $6 billion for the arming of Iraqi soldiers or anything like that. We are simply saying we should consider making other attempts to solve the issue before resorting to the end of the spectrum and risking American lives.""  An even better way is to have some sort of evidence of a trade off. Something saying like, ""Commiting ground troops will eliminate diplomacy between the group and the U.S. and further strain tensions with ___. A better option would be to strengthen diplomacy and our ties. They are effective, ground troops aren't. However affirming the resolution takes away this possibility""   That's how I would try and swing it   Edit: If you go with the first route, one thing I just remembered a lot of people did on the December topic was suggesting that we don't go to extremes. The example often used was comparing issues in private prisons to a car with a flat tire. A person doesn't simply compact the car and buy a new one once he or she gets a flat tire, instead he fixes it. The extreme would be a complete overhaul that has serious costs, with the car the price of a new car and maybe this resolution American lives. A better alternative would be to take a lest costly avenue and try and fix the problem with the old strategy rather than try a new one all together."

Counter-plans aren't some evil thing that need to be banned, they are just an argument that says ""we can solve the problems outlined by the affirmative team while avoiding the problems the affirmative position would create."" This is how you should frame it. You need to argue that there are other ways to combat ISIS, and that troops on the ground would lead to more problems. These are the essential components of a counterplan, but as long as you don't advocate a specific solution you are probably fine.  This is one of the many reasons that PF is silly."

You should outline all of the bad things sending troops will cause, and at the end of your constructive say ""and we can solve the problem in other ways, for example we could work to reduce their funding, we could do X or Y.

Debate,30bdxu,Crisissss,11,Sat Apr 4 20:47:20 2015 UTC,"Girls in policy can wear blouses jeans and sneakers and be fine. The standard is really set by the judging pool sadly. Parents get it in their heads that the kids should be dressed up. Debate judges who used to debate themselves really don't care. That being said wearing a real suit does lend you extra credibility. You look better, and automatically people have more respect for you.   It sounds like you have a more lay and conservative judging pool. Either your coach needs to step in and have a word with these judges and get them barred from judging, or you're going to have to figure out which side you want to take. You can either bend and dress up, or still get comments but stick to dressing how you want.   I was told by my coaches in college when I was doing speech events that I had to clear every outfit with them and they would drop me if I showed up in anything else. They knew that girls in speech were expected to have a certain look. Suit, hair up, nice heels, classy jewelry. When I was debating I could wear business casual outfits that didn't need to be approved because they knew it didn't matter. Does it suck. Maybe. But I have a ton of really nice outfits I can wear to work and I was really prepared for that. I wouldn't have been if I had been able to be casual all the time."

Debate,30bdxu,Prometheus720,4,Thu Mar 26 06:45:02 2015 UTC,The only legit attire rule is if you wear a hoody you need to rep the school you're debating at.  Anything else is superfluous.
Debate,30bdxu,backcountryguy,7,Thu Mar 26 05:25:26 2015 UTC,"The illusion here is that men only have code to adhere to which is formal, and that's untrue. Both men and women have different formal attires for different occasions, and that's the issue at hand.  Many non-suit alternatives for women are still formal, but they are meant for certain occasions. Dresses are meant to accentuate the woman and focus on making her attractive. You wouldn't wear a pantsuit to an upscale party, and there's a reason for that.  Suits, however, are reserved for focused events. Debates, work, job interviews, you name it. The point of a suit is not to make a woman appear particularly beautiful; it's to make her appear crisp, the same way men's suits do for men. And if you want to wear a miniskirt type thing with the jacket, that's fine too, it's still a suit in my book.  However, men also have formal options which are used in certain situations. While we're typically stuck to a suit, there are a lot of different dress options that are equally dressy but are meant for different occasions. White suits aren't a good idea for the workplace; they're distracting and somewhat impractical, rather like a dress. But when you're at an upscale party in some warm climate and you rock the white suit like an actual gentleman and not a neckbeard, you are a hero. You wouldn't go to a job interview wearing a tuxedo, for the same reasons, but if you wear one at a party, good job, you look like a hunk of man.  Men don't get quite as many ""fun"" options, which I kind of resent as a man, but whatever. The point is that if you want the focus to be on the ideas, conform to the dress code as much as possible. If you want the eyes to be on you as a person or your body, don't conform to a dress code and wear something flashy or sexy, respectively. Not that a woman in a suit can't be sexy, but you get my point.   Now, not to sound rant-y, but that's simply ridiculous. As long as you dress formally, what you wear shouldn't impact the chamber. It should be the content and the tone of your speeches and questions that determine the quality of the speaker.   Bullshit. No offense, I have respect for you for bothering to bring this up, but that's patently false, and if you've ever watched an election, you'd know it. Appearances are so important. It changes how people understand everything you say and what they think of you the moment they see you. You should never wear something just because it's formal. Always wear something that puts you at an advantage. A friend of mine is a great debater, makes it to nats every year, and he intentionally dresses down. He wears a Euro-cut light gray suit, the exact same as his partner, and they even match ties. They're formal and they're a team. And yet, if you look down, you'll see the most ridiculous American flag socks on this guy. And it works with his personality and body language and overall appearance to give him this persona of, ""I'm a professional but I still know I'm hot and I still like to make debate fun."" And it works, and not just on the judges.  You will always be judged on your appearances, and it would be wrong for competitive debate to fail to reflect that. It's a hidden law of debate. People who succeed and those who understand and follow hidden laws like that have a pretty wide overlap.  So let's pull this full circle. I'm not a female fashion expert so I don't exactly know what's out there, but most dresses don't belong in a debate round, and neither do white suits. Wear something which presents you as a particular kind of person. If you're doing congressional debate, wear something you'd wear in congress. If you want to stand out, wear one thing which grabs their attention. Bright-colored shirt, a more colorful suit, a piece of jewelry, or maybe do something with your hair. As far as colorful suits, Angela Merkel has been seen in orange, and she looked like a damn professional, although that's thanks in part to her resting bitchface. That might be too far for American tastes, but I think you get what I'm saying."
Debate,30bdxu,Prometheus720,9,Thu Mar 26 06:28:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly though, I understand your point and I think it's bullshit because yeah, at congress I obviously have to be dressed more sensibly, but at an LD round I can't wear a conservative dress? Yeah I get that the ""dress code"" for a debate is mainly conservative but to have some guy tell me that I can't even wear a pantsuit or a dress is ridiculous. It confines me to a fucking skirt when i would rather be in slacks. You can DEFINITELY dress professionally in a dress or a pantsuit. I am 1000% sure."
Debate,30bdxu,gr4nnycats,6,Thu Mar 26 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"Wait a fuck, they told you you had to wear a skirt? That's ridiculous.  Pants are fine. There are probably some dresses which are fine, but like I said, I'm not exactly an expert in women's fashion. Most aren't.  And again, I'm not saying that you shouldn't be allowed to wear what you want. As far as I'm concerned, tournament rules should allow all legal dress, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't wear what's going to make you successful.  I'd also say that the rules should make no mention of dress other than that ""It is not an adequate reason to decide on a contestant."" They should allow judges to be influenced by dress. Debate should be teaching you how to convince people and infect their minds through every attack vector available. Dress is one of them."
Debate,30bdxu,Prometheus720,4,Thu Mar 26 16:03:11 2015 UTC,"Debate isn't an election or a job interview - it's barely even a public event. It's a competitive speech giving activity where the content of the competitor's speeches is what scoring should focus on. It's terrible for debate students when lazy judges let their personal biases about how boys and girls are ""supposed"" to behave and look get in the way of focusing on the comparative quality of the speeches because it means the competitive bar for everyone in the event is arbitrary lowered by an entirely tangential factor. The fact that you refer to a particular type of suit as ""euro cut"" and Merkel's ""resting bitchface"" indicate that you probably don't, and won't, get it, though."
Debate,30bdxu,f4therfucker,-2,Thu Mar 26 17:42:28 2015 UTC,"the content of the competitor's speeches is what scoring should focus on.   The content doesn't matter. Ask a politician. Nobody listens to content. They listen to delivery. If it was about content, you would never need to practice a speech, as long as it was well-written. The reality that you need to face is that every single person in the real world will judge you based on a variety of factors, some of them out of your control, some of them well within your control. If someone were ranking you down due to your race, I would have a lot more sympathy. Or if you were poor and couldn't afford professional clothes, which I have been myself, I would have a lot more sympathy. But you simply are unwilling to accommodate your audience, and that means you're a shit speaker, and your rank should reflect it.  Your own personal vanity doesn't fucking matter on a stage, kid. It's not about your ego. Nobody wants to listen to you talk. They want to listen to you say what they want to hear. They want to see someone who thinks like them, talks like them, dresses like them. Give them that, and they will be receptive to you.  Why do you think you debate both sides in LD, the original format? Because it teaches you your opponent's arguments? You could learn those without actually using them. Because it's convenient for competition? You could just flip a coin instead. No, it teaches you to suspend your own beliefs. You have to lie to yourself and lie to your judge. There is no room for your personal vanity if you want to win. And that's actually the way many things are in life. If you want to win people over, you have to kiss their asses. If you want a promotion, and your boss thinks you dress improperly, do you get your panties in a twist? No, you grin and bear it, fix your clothes, and then when you're the boss, you remember what happened to you and then treat your subordinates more kindly. You're not important. You're not a special snowflake. You're a debater, and you want to win. Start acting like it.   The fact that you refer to a particular type of suit as ""euro cut"" and Merkel's ""resting bitchface"" indicate that you probably don't, and won't, get it, though.   I have no clue what this has to do with anything.   Average Americans are notorious for wearing ""sack suits"" which are more boxy than the current fashions in many places in Europe and the more progressive areas of America. Also, shoulderpads. I have immense respect for Angela Merkel. Hillary Clinton pretends she's a feminist. Fuck that, she wants votes. Merkel has done more for women than Clinton ever will. She and Margaret Thatcher proved that women can be incredibly competent heads of state and most certainly go toe-to-toe with anyone in the business. She makes Obama and Bush look like a couple of damn pansies. All that, however, does not change the fact that she usually looks very grumpy."
Debate,30bdxu,Prometheus720,2,Fri Mar 27 02:00:15 2015 UTC,"The content doesn't matter. Ask a politician. Nobody listens to content.   You're wrong. Content matters all the time. Content is the reason that this speech by Bill Clinton was better than every speech that was given at the 2012 RNC combined. Great content is what drives political action, law and policy making, business success, and economic advancement. Your stance places marketing before creation of a product. Fundamentally, the ability to put forth great content is what drives success and reward in almost every field and your viewpoint is not a recipe for success in the real world.  Overriding importance of content aside, it's funny that I predicted you would miss the point because you totally did just that. Debate is not a court room, election trail, work place or job interview - it's an educational competition. Quality of the speeches should carry the day above and before all else because the competitor's speeches are what the different events are designed to place into comparison. It's good that debate is not the same thing as those other places mentioned because debate is optimized to teach kids competitive speech giving and the intellectual tools that great debating relies on, such as cost benefit analysis, critical thinking, cross-examination, decision making, research and argumentative writing, extemporaneous speaking, and other forms of delivery. Debate is a great place for those things. Debate is not the optimal place for kids to learn how to ""dress for success!"" because the judge's ballot is most educationally valuable to the student participants when it solely determines ""who did the better debating"" and leaves non-intrinsic issues out of consideration. This is how judges and competitors demonstrate respect for one another despite often being from dramatically different personal worlds. Besides, there are hundreds of other venues where kids can learn how to dress appropriately for different situations. Leave fashion advice and business casual tips to the FBLA Club. Debaters have more important things to worry about and more importantly, learn about.  Your paragraph that compares this stance to vanity and claims debaters have to lie to win is ridiculous. Debaters and judges prove that wrong every weekend."
Debate,30bdxu,f4therfucker,-1,Fri Mar 27 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"We'll agree to disagree. Competitive debate is about debate, but it encompasses the entire presentation to an audience, in this case judges. If you expect to win, if you expect to win trophies and awards and things, then you should do everything in your power to get your message across.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, back when he was a bodybuilder, won the Mr. Olympia contest against a man who was considered unbeatable for years. After a long stalemate, the judges were still undecided on a victor. Arnold and the incumbent agreed to forget it, walk off the stage, and let the judges have time to decide, but as the two were walking off, the crowd booed.  Arnold turned around, walked back on stage, and posed a few more times. And he won. If he hadn't won that title, he might never have reached the level of fame he did. He may never have become governor of California. But he went the extra mile to win the audience.  You can do what you want. It won't affect me directly. I've given you my invitation. That's all I have."
Debate,30bdxu,Prometheus720,2,Fri Mar 27 03:55:13 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying the answer to this question is definitely going to vary by circuit.  When I competed, I never was discriminated against for wearing a dress in lieu of a pantsuit.  That being said, most of the time I wore a dress it was black/solid colored, knee-length or so, and I usually had a blazer on top of it.  Sometimes pencil skirts with a button down top.  When you say formal outfits, I assume you mean something like this.  There was a girl I knew who'd wear a short little pink party dress (and on occasion a tiara--seriously) and she'd get comments on what she wore.  In my opinion, that's not a problem--she might have been dressed 'nicely', but not professionally.  On the other hand, dresses like I originally mentioned are definitely professional wear--I'd dress like that for business; it's acceptable for debaters.    Now that I'm out of high school I judge and I just don't comment on debater's appearances, male or female.  Debate is an activity that can help break down socioeconomic barriers, but so often I see the students from the disadvantaged urban schools without formal wear.  My dad coached a team at a school with such poverty and related issues that not only did they need to get donations to pay for tournament fees, they had to get donations for button-down shirts for the competitors.  Earlier this season, I saw a coach from an inner-city school wearing formal pants and an undershirt.  One of his debaters showed up that morning and didn't have a formal shirty to wear, so he had literally given the shirt off his back to the student.  I know this is a bit off topic, but really, I think holding strict standards of what is debate-appropriate attire limits the ability of debate to access students in disadvantaged schools."
Debate,30bdxu,ItsOnDVR,4,Mon Mar 30 21:56:37 2015 UTC,"As a male debater, I think there are pretty ridiculous standards of dress in debate in general. I'm not sure how a person in a suit, red shirt with a neon yellow tie could possible be taken more seriously than someone wearing a nice blazer, khakis/jeans, and an unbuttoned shirt. Of all the countries that have debate scenes, Americans are by far the most strict and conservative about dress code - international tournaments very often allow students to debate in shorts and t-shirts, though most people choose to dress a bit nicer.  I think a lot of the same logic applies for female debaters - I've seen some pretty weird-looking power suits. Looking presentable and speaking well is what's important, not way one looks.  That being said, I think dressing nicely is healthy for the activity and promotes good skills for later in life, but not so much that it ought to be a factor in judging."
Debate,30bdxu,JPrimack,2,Thu Mar 26 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily about the fact that it's a specific suit compared to something more casual. You have to keep in mind that: 1. Scientifically speaking, you are taken more seriously when wearing something very formal (however, this can change when people actually start listening to you speak) 2. Its about the standard. Debate should be an environment that is held to a high standard. (I guess that's more of my opinion)"

Being sent up to the office until my mom brings me new clothes. Being lectured for dressing a certain way. Those god forsaken white and purple plaid skirts. That’s pretty distracting to me. Don’t let me forget about the derogatory and misogynistic comments at speech and debate. Of course, “Don’t wear those clothes again. That could be distracting to your male opponents.” “Cover up.” “You kind of look like a whore.” But it’s never just that. You make your presence known in every round I step into. If I’m up against a male opponent, I can never be assertive or I may risk looking like a bitch. I'm told never to raise my voice to a male opponent – i'll probably emasculate him. You teach us that a woman must never be with more than one man or she risks looking like a slut; a man can be with hundreds of women however, because that’s pretty cool! Expressing one’s sexuality is seen as an act of corruption to your body and a big ""screw you"" to the creator. Losing your virginity outside of a marriage is equivalent to losing your ticket into heaven if you're a woman. I hate to break this to you, but women are much more complex than scriptures within the text of a bible. Our minds and bodies are not in existence to please a man and serve him to the fullest. We own our bodies, we own our knees and our shoulders, we own our reproductive systems, we have the ability to stand up to misogyny that’s promoted day to day, and we’re stronger than you think we are. According to you, writing this may display me in an unattractive, bossy, and negative light; but nothing is more unappealing than everything that you are. But that’s just one feminist’s opinion."""
Debate,30bdxu,jswiftydowell,2,Thu Mar 26 16:00:30 2015 UTC,"I think as long as you look professional it shouldn't be an issue. I wear both suits and just regular dresses and I've never had an issue. I also wear ties/bow ties and have never had a negative reaction to it. Having a more professional look is a lot easier for guys just because most dress clothes are viewed as professional for them. While it's a bit more difficult for us to do, I still think female debaters should be maintaining a professional look at debate tournaments, because the nature of the activity is to act professional. If you wouldn't wear it to work at a corporate job, then you shouldn't wear it to debate."

Debate,30bdxu,mathpop09,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:18:39 2015 UTC,"I debate in an extremely conservative/lay circuit where girls go so far as to wear skirts that touch their ankles. I generally wear business dresses with a blazer, pencil skirts and blouses, and dress pants and blouse combinations, and I often get both positive and negative comments on how I dress. The problem I have with circuit dress codes is that we have male policy debaters that dress incredibly casually, and never have a problem (example: in last years state policy finals round all of the debaters wore sweatshirts and socks or no shoes and didn't get a comment) As a team captain it is my duty to set an example and help regulate what my team is wearing, but I have a hard time telling my female debaters to change what they're wearing because they don't look formal enough, yet I have to let my male debaters that only wear semi-formal sweaters and vans continue to wear what they do. In actual business environments, dresses are just as acceptable as suits if they're actually meant for that purpose so to limit our ""business"" dress code further than that seems ridiculous.  Some people don't look good or feel comfortable in suits or dresses and they shouldn't have to force themselves to wear something they don't feel comfortable debating in because it will probably harm their performance."

I was wearing a long-sleeve button up with a black blazer and black pencil skirt. I had my school band jacket over my blazer cause it was a really cold day but then as soon as I had to speak I took it off to look more ""professional"" and not casual. They said my pencil skirt was too short, even though it went past my fingertips like regulations said with maybe an inch extra, and it made me look unprofessional and my jacket was distracting. (which I wasn't even wearing while speaking?) But the previous 3 rounds did not say anything about it and they ranked by how we spoke and not how we looked. What ticked me off the most was our opponents wearing Nikes with neon laces but I was the one who looked unprofessional in the round. I was still fourth speaker.

Stability in the Middle East is generally good for the US because that means functional governments that the US can support and make deals with. The US also has oil interests in the ME, and probably wants to protect those interests for the sake of the global economy.  Another part of the impacts of the fall of ISIS is whether the region will actually be stable, and if it does stabilize, how the balance of power shakes out. In the status quo, Iran figures to be the most powerful country in the region, since they're backing Baghdad and a bunch of Shiite militias that are fighting against ISIS. This could be bad for the US because of two reasons: 1) Iran-backed Shiite militias are committing war crimes and burning Sunni villages, which is alienating Sunnis right now and could fuel future insurgency and 2) Iran is aligned against US allies in the region like Saudia Arabia, UAE, and Turkey, and a stronger Iran gives them more leverage in diplomatic affairs like the current nuclear talks with the US."

Like if it's something informal, as it usually is, the idea of recognizing the fallacy is good for the sake of having an easy motif in your back pocket to respond.  I.e., some kind of obvious appeal to authority.  I'm not going to call it an appeal to authority explicitly, but I might ridicule the underlying logic by making an analogy.  I suppose if they make a straw man argument I'd call that out, but I guess it comes down to the context.  Generally, I don't think lay judges are interested in hearing someone prove that they passed a predicate logic class; they just want to hear why the other guy is wrong.  Just my .02"

You have to explain how there are differences between the evidence(s) and how it makes yours more valid.   For scientific and political issues, I think it is extremely important to check the dates of articles. For example, last year at nationals in public forum debate, the topic was very current. So current that events were occurring that changed the scope/ way the debates played out at the tournament. EX: I say that russia is going to nuke america however, because my evidence is 4 days old and my opponents evidence is two days old and it says that they made a statement saying they won't nuke the us or an article explaining how they don't have the technical capabilities to do so, then I would lose that argument.

A significant number of people go beyond the 3 years, including me, because something may be relevant. But as for an unwritten rule about what to cite, 3 years is what I would recommend.

Debate,2z76wy,gayunderbridge,20,Mon Mar 16 04:15:18 2015 UTC,"Great question.   My final high school season ended last month, and over my debate career I've seen a lot of novices go up against some competitive varsity debaters. Through the time I've spent watching these rounds, I've watched some novice debaters with some GREAT points; the in-case analysis and level of research was WAY impressive. However, their opponents were much more experienced than them. The opponent's public speaking abilities were fantastic, their presentation solid, everything.... but most of the time, what they were saying could EASILY be refuted. Some absurd claims were made, and some poor analysis was used to draw impacts to their contentions. You could imagine the opposing novice teams were able to take them down with ease, due to the nature of their advanced understanding of the topic, right?  Not quite. Unfortunately, the ability for these varsity debates to shut their opponents down with the confidence and forceful public speaking abilities they possessed alienated these talented novices from the actual debate. What those rounds became was less about logic and meaningful impact, and more about who ""sounded"" correct. The novices become intimidated, and weary about the true legitimacy of their claims, even though they were sound and logical. Judges buy into the experienced, confident debater's arguments, because a non-confident speaker loses credibility. When you're too nervous to stand up to these varsity debaters, your brain enters flight mode and you lose your round because you were too shaky to rebut your opponent.  I've watched COUNTLESS rounds like this, and I have to say, it KILLS me. You know why? Because I used to be the terrified novice, who was too scared to stand up to the debaters. They were persuasive and scary, and I lost a lot of rounds. Now, I've grown more confident and I've realized that these guys don't win rounds because their points are better. They win because their points SOUND better. The way I've conquered these irrational debaters, these debaters that are making you and many other novice debaters nervous about debate, is to do this:  Breathe and Listen  When you're feeling intimidated, when you're feeling nervous in a round, when you're about to get up to go speak and you don't know what to do while your scary and experienced opponent is seemingly crushing you, do this: 1) Take 10 seconds to look around the room, look at EVERYTHING around you so that you are completely aware of your surroundings. This allows your brain to relocate itself, and be aware of your environment. Once you do this, you can focus and alleviate the nervousness you're experiencing. 2) Listen to what your opponent is saying. No, REALLYYY listen to what your opponent is saying. It may sound nice, and it may seem like they're right... but are they? Are the assumptions they're making to connect their logic all that reasonable? Is there a hole in their argument? Are they making any logical fallacies? Are they even addressing your arguments directly? This is SO vital. Most of the time, your opponents may not even be saying anything at all.. simply talking circles. Their presentation is great, so it sounds irrefutable. The reality is, there's something wrong with it, and you just have to relax and poke the holes and attack their links.  3) Now that you've relaxed and understood what you opponent is saying, you need to DIRECTLY rebut the claims and the links that you've discovered are, in fact, completely fallacious. Attack the center of their argument, so that you create inherent clash within the debate. When you do this, the judge will think,  ""whoah, wait a second... this guy just SOUNDS nice. The person coming up to give their rebuttal speech has realized that what their opponent is saying really isn't that indestructible!""   And, of course, remember that your nerves will subside with experience. The more you debate, the more confident your speaking will become. Give it time and patience.  It's unfortunate to hear that your team isn't very encouraging. Debate is a fantastic experience, and helps you develop some real-life skills that are vital in today's job world and society in general. Don't let the nerves discourage you--- because once you get past those, you'll be able to tackle any argument with grace and excellence.

Even if you have no idea what the fuck you're doing, realize that they too have no idea what they're doing, because in debate, especially parly, no one, not even the judge has the slightest clue what the hell is going on. This was my first year debating and my partner and I both did extremely well at all our tournaments. Realize that even if you don't know what you're saying, say it anyway with gusto. If you go into it under the premise that no one knows what's going on at all you'll be fine. One of my best debates happened when I was still kind of drunk from the night before."

Definitely don't be nervous about it.   Also, BU's team honestly isn't that prestigious (not that they're bad, they're just not consistently a top team) so there's not too much pressure. The people I know from the team are really nice, too! It should be a really good environment and APDA is a great time even for the community in addition to the debate aspect.  I'd recommend going to 2 tournaments this year so you can keep your novice status next year but still get lots of practice. Providence, UConn (hosted at Brown) and Wellesley are all running upcoming tournaments that you can get to on the commuter rail so any of those should be easy to get to for your first tournament.  Feel free to ask any questions about APDA, the northern APDA circuit, etc.  Edit: also, videos.apdaweb.org has recordings of APDA rounds if you wanna see some"
Debate,2ynkr0,llamalord,5,Fri Mar 13 01:44:21 2015 UTC,They seem to do APDA style Parliamentary debate.  Here is a link to a video of one of their teams I found. This is pretty soft ball style of debate. You should be fine. I would advise you really start getting your current events knowledge up to snuff. But I think this is something you could jump into and do well in.
Debate,2ynkr0,VisonKai,3,Wed Mar 11 20:09:34 2015 UTC,Don't forget that parliamentary is almost always completely extemporaneous so it's not quite as easy as the video makes it look.

Debate,2ynkr0,Aquanker,3,Mon Mar 16 14:01:13 2015 UTC,"Speaking as the president of a club that almost exclusively comprises itself of non-HS debaters i think i can give you a straight answer.   Theres a huge learning curve. Strong public speaking helps (its the only thing that kept me confident), but speaking well in debate is totally different. Takes A LOT of practice to get 'good'. This can change, depending on how well you're trained and what degree youre in. Debate mannerisms are just very different from normal conversation.   Were mostly a science school so learning things line philosophy, international relations, etc are even harder to pick up for most of us. If you're in s liberal arts program at least you have the benefit of learning high level arguments in class.   But you get what you put in. Personally ive watched dozens of recorded WUDC debates and lectures from debatevideo.org (google it) which i think helped three most especially coming from our school.   So getting good is doable but the best debaters literally practice/ learn all the time in ways that helps them get better. All skills have their professionals, how bad do you want it?"

Went to Big Bronx all four years in high school and it was always impeccably run; Jon was probably one of the most enthusiastic and energetic people I ever knew in the HS debate community, and though I didn't ever have any extended interactions with him, the times we did talk were absolutely cordial and entertaining.

Debate,2y37d8,ANALFISSURES123,7,Fri Mar 6 01:17:01 2015 UTC,"I am done with this topic, so if you have any general questions, PM me.  Here are some of the general ideas that I would consider. Pro: Decreased Tuition leads to higher enrollment You can impact this very easily (and avoid all of the con counters of dropout rates) if you say that just going to college is good. Even though people might not graduate, if they take a Spanish class, they'll still learn Spanish (so life benefits). There is a good piece of evidence from the Hamilton project that says that just going (not even graduating) leads to a $100,000 benefit  Higher Graduation Rates  There are multiple ways to argue this and here is just one example. You can argue that since people don't have to pay their tuition, they can work less. As a result, people can spend more time on college and no longer have to skip classes for work. This leads to higher graduation rates. There are many ways you can argue this.  Better Quality  You can argue that when colleges get more students, it can improve the quality of the education it provides. This is more of a side argument that helps combat the neg but it could be offensive as well. For example, when colleges get more students, they can offer classes that there previously weren't enough students for. Thats just one of many ways you can argue that more students -> better colleges.  Con There are many unique stances you can take on the con.  Waitlists  This can be a very strong argument. You can argue that decreasing the tuition won't do anything because they will just get placed on the waitlist, and there is no increase in enrollment (ex. look to Californian colleges). If you are very progressively oriented, you should argue that we shouldn't make it free, if we can accomplish the same thing by reducing the price to $1,000. You can also link this to income inquality and hurting the poor because there are community colleges where you can pay to get off of the waitlist (only rich can afford).   Decreased Quality  Another very stock idea would be that it decreases quality, however just can't be run in conjunction with waitlists. For decreased quality, you can argue that it overpopulates community colleges, which harms education in multiple ways. Some ways would be extremely large class sizes, which is bad, or use of part time teachers to compensate, which is also bad. The other quality argument here is devaluation of degrees, which really isn't that good of an argument since it is very elitist and has a ""only wealthy people should have degrees"" mentality.  Increased Tuition, Increased Price, Increased Dropout rates  Even though it says free for two years, that does not make tuition absolutely free. Most students finish college in 5 years, so they still have another 3 years of going through college. As soon as the two-year ""free trial"" ends, people won't be prepared because they haven't had a job to deal with this, and will dropout. Or that since the government is footing the bill, colleges will increase prices. There are multiple ways you can go about arguing this point. This argument is good only if you do REALLY good research.  Guaranteeing things are bad  This is more of a logical idea that you can argue. The resolution says guarantee students (note the difference between the resolution and the Obama proposal) which means we would be guaranteeing free college for people who skip class, don't care about their education, and fail class but still graduate high school. We shouldn't guarantee free two years, and should rather give it to only some students.   Those are just some general ideas, let me know if you need any more help. Good luck with your tournament!"

You can talk about how just lowering the price to $1,000 (which they did in California) was enough to max out enrollment. As a result, there is no reason to make it free, or making it free in other states will just put people on the waitlist. https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2012/08/29/huge-waiting-lists-california-community-colleges http://sites.ewu.edu/admissions/2013/04/26/waitlisted-in-california/"

Debate,2y37d8,Clusterfist,1 point,Fri Mar 6 11:54:56 2015 UTC,"Drop out arguments aren't strong as they can be countered by the pro easily. The same situation occurs with the argument that 'tuition isn't everything'. The tuition argument is easily forwarded through the round by the pro. As far as waitlist I haven't heard much about that. Might be interesting to look into, just might be overlooked with the huge benefits of the pro."
Debate,2y37d8,Argo4444,2,Fri Mar 6 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"Well from my experience at states, most of the con arguments aim to minimize the impact of the pro and outweigh on cost. For dropouts, many con teams will not that students drop out not because of the cost of tuition, but rather to work full time or to assist with their families. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has some good evidence on this. An impact like this cannot be turned by the pro because it concedes tuition would be free and that the impact is simply not enough.   As for the tuition isn't everything argument, the pro gains little ground as well. Many con teams frame the round looking at the middle class, as the lower class can receive grants and the upper class can conceivably pay for college already. With this, the con team cites a ton of evidence suggesting that even if tuition was free, many students would still be unable to afford college. Georgetown looked at this idea and found that tuition was only about one fifth the cost of a college student and many students would still be unable to cover the cost of attendance even if tuition was free, something that directly link turns the pro.  Waitlists is probably the strongest con argument I've heard on this topic, as it turns the entire round. Evidence from California and Minnesota found that as higher scholarship amounts were paid the more overcrowded a school would become. As a result, the school would have to start creating a waitlist in which two things can happen: students are discouraged and choose not to enter college or students stay on the waitlist of a long time and are unable to pay to get off. Overall this furthers the idea that free tuition wouldn't benefit those who need it. In addition, this means that the government would be paying for tuition but students would never get to go to class, meaning no education, no degree, no job, no pay and no return on investment"
Debate,2y37d8,Clusterfist,2,Mon Mar 9 06:45:58 2015 UTC,"The pro has the ability to link finance as a reason for dropouts, and even if they are dropping out, it doesn't matter due to another route the pro can take.  The tuition isn't everything argument I will admit is muddled. The main reason I personally think the pro is stronger is that you can have tuition free + pell & other grants + scholarships. There is no reason that just because it won't cover all the costs, it means that you have to negate. (It will cover the costs more than just pell+others)  With waitlists, again, I haven't looked into this. However, it seems it runs parallel to quality of education. Which, is a strong argument. As for it being the strongest argument, I believe that credit inflation is one of the hardest to both refute and run on this topic."

When comparing community college graduates to students who only received a high school diploma, the returns are even greater.

Debate,2xv4bt,theyfoundtheotherone,3,Wed Mar 4 02:51:39 2015 UTC,It's also pretty strategic: turns out being responsive leads to winning too.  I've been judging traditional LD lately and people just kinda ignore the value debate.  For the life of me I don't understand how debaters expect me to evaluate a round without some articulation of why I should prefer one value over the other.  Having two values doesn't function.

Debate,2x6kzl,mjr1234,12,Thu Feb 26 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"Hey,  First, relax your tone. You're straining your voice, and should put less force and effort into each sound.  Second, provide three clear reasons why your answer is correct. You provide an answer, ""no,"" but don't justify why that answer is correct. Provide three points that are reasons why your answer is true. If you can start the tagline with ""because,"" you're going in the right direction.  Third, add more sources. Include at least one source in the introduction, and at least 2 per point. You can provide up to 2 in the introduction, between the attention grabber, and the question, and a maximum of 4 per point. Keep them 2 months old.  Fourth, professionalism is important. Don't make self-deprecating jokes about urinating or reference Dr. Phil in your attention grabber. If you make a joke, make sure that it's one that a judge would be impressed with. Professionalism is critical to maintain any credibility with the judge.  Your fluency is awesome and you make sense, but you still need to work on a few structural and stylistic issues."
Debate,2x6kzl,Jfqian,4,Thu Feb 26 03:37:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot!  With the tone, is there any specific style of speaking that I should aim for?"
Debate,2x6kzl,asthedrivensnow,6,Thu Feb 26 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I'm going to preface this all by saying that I'm not a big expert on extemp styles, so I'll be giving more general feedback on persuasive speech. As others have said, there is a ton of stuff you did really well, but I'm going to focus on being critical (sorry), and I'm going to structure this response kind of strangely. I'm going to begin with a bunch of things that didn't quite work for me in the speech, and then at the end I'm going to go into solutions, because I think the same solutions apply for a lot of the things I want to highlight, and it’s basically my normal coaching to intermediate speakers stuff, but applied to the example speech you gave specifically.   So the first thing that jumps out to me is that the logic of your argument seems a bit disconnected. The logic you are using is ""This is the reaction, that sort of reaction is justified, therefore this reaction is justified"". That's what your speech is when you boil it all away to its simplest logical structure. In a bit I'm going to talk about whether that's the best logic to use, but I just want to make a point in terms of how you deploy this idea. So your first point is the first premise of the logic (this is the reaction) and your third point is basically the second premise (this reaction is justified). However, there are some problems with that structure. Your second point is a part of both without really committing itself. The two premises are so far apart that the syllogism isn't instinctive. When you are saying at the end stuff like ""these aggressive actions mean Europe's reaction is justified"" I'm trying to remember your two and a half minutes of describing that reaction so I can work out if I believe you.  The second thing I want to highlight is that you didn't seem to connect enough to what foreign policy is on a conceptual level. So what I mean by this is that for every topic you speak on, that topic can usually be distilled down into a broad conceptual argument. In this case, the argument is ""Is the best foreign policy response to aggression one that focuses on openness, integration, co-operation and mediation, or is it a foreign policy that focuses on retaliation, punishment and so on."" That is the central question at the heart of virtually every international conflict. But when I get to the end of your speech I really don't know what you think about that issue in a broader sense.    The third thing I wanted to talk about is that there was a lack of specificity to a lot of what you were saying. You open your first point by saying relations have been ""severely affected"" between Russia and the EU. But that could mean anything. It's a very intangible way of talking about it. The same applies when you say that the EU has a ""very negative view of Russia"". Again, it could mean anything, and it becomes a real problem later when you try to argue that this negativity is justified, cos I'm just not sure what that means.   One final piece of criticism (before I get on to how to improve these things) is something that sounds small but can actually be really big. From this speech I basically don't know anything about russia/eu relations from before 2014, but that previous history can actually be turned into a big advantage for you by setting up a broader trend.    OK, so those are the areas to improve on (sorry that section was so negative), now I'm going to talk about the solutions, which are all sort of interconnected with each other, which is why I wanted to do it all at once.   So I would advise changing around the structure of the speech so that your three points are three mini versions of the logic you already have. So the first might be ""Economic sanctions are the only way to punish Russia's breach of Ukrainian Sovereignty"", your second might be ""Russia cannot be trusted with entry into transnational institutions like the G8"" and your third might be ""Europe is right in trying to protect the sovereign rights of post-soviet states"". Now, those probably aren't the best arguments to run (I haven't done any research on this topic in ages), but they illustrate my point. They are specific, it’s easy to see that this action by Russia justifies that reaction from the EU. They are phrased actively. At the end of this speech, even if the judge only remembers my titles, I've already done a huge amount to persuade them.   Within these points the logic can be really clear. ""This is what Europe did. These are the circumstances in which those actions were justified. Those circumstances apply here, therefore the EU was right."" That will be the logic inside each argument, and because it’s done within two minutes instead of seven it is a lot clearer how it fits together.   Because I talk in each about what makes a negative reaction warranted in foreign policy, and because the action and reaction are specific in each case, everything is a lot clearer, and therefore a lot more persuasive. And over the course of the speech, as you fill in each little bit of analysis, you build up into a coherent picture of Europe's reaction to Russia, and what makes such reactions justified.   And then you just need to use your introduction and conclusion you set up the context. “There is a trend towards greater antagonism between Russia and the EU. Is it right for Europe to follow that path? Yes, it’s the only correct response to repeated Russian aggression against sovereign nations. Here are the three most important parts of the EU's response and why they got it right.“ Obviously color that in a bit, I’m just trying to show what I mean!  The reason I think it is better to do it that way (and this will be the part that will apply to virtually every single speech you ever give) is that good speech writing isn’t about setting out one clear argument. It’s about building the world in which that argument is true. All reasonable people have the same facts about the EU, Ukraine and Russia. But they can still disagree about the best outcome because everyone lives in their own philosophical world where those facts add up to a certain thing. Some believe that free markets create peace and prosperity and integration, so the EU response only makes things worse. Some believe that when a nation is aggressive it must be punished as a disincentive. So each argument you make in a speech needs to contribute to building that idea of the world, because ultimately that is what will be persuasive. Each part of the speech adds layers to the question of “when is distrust and antagonism justified”. If, by the end, you have built a clear idea of the answer to that question, then all the facts will seem to be on your side. Some topics mean you can make that argument directly (in a lot of liberty topics, your first argument is just going to be “when can the government take control of people’s lives?”) but the important point is having that goal in mind when you make your speech.   That’s all very… esoteric, isn’t it? Well, I can’t really help that, sorry.  It’s kind of similar to setting up a framework in some American debate styles. If you have questions (which is… reasonable) then ask away. As others have said, you present quite well and speak quite eloquently. In particular, you are comfortable with silence, which is huge and you use it well. I think you have tons of talent, and the fact that you will let yourself be criticized be the internet tells me you have the mindset to improve and go very far with your speaking. Good luck!"

Don't ask rhetorical questions, make personal jokes, quote Dr. Phil, use weird analogies (like about bears and baskets), lean in to emphasize a point, or smack your lips. Think about it this way - if you were a judge, you'd really dislike this kid for making corny jokes. You'll be taken more seriously if you talk seriously.  -your voice is too strained. Imagine giving a Powerpoint presentation to a class, you'd be far less loud.  -Don't use personal pronouns in phrases like ""we can see"", or ""my answer is"". It sounds awkward and wastes time.  -use your hands! if you're not using them for gestures, let them hang by your sides instead of holding them together.  -pace between points, but don't move back and forth during each substantive point."

I'm a senior, and I've done both Congress and PF now, and would love to go to nationals, considering this is my last year. The last time someone went to nationals was when I was a freshman and not in the same school as the debate team (our high school at the time was 10th-12th). We have no idea how to bring it up. Another issue is that our coach is fiercely a speech coach, and not a debate coach. She barely knows what debate is, and I'm not exaggerating."
Debate,2x21t1,Dovesongz,3,Wed Feb 25 01:26:24 2015 UTC,I think you should go for it especially since from what you tell me you could probably qualify! What I know is to never let your team or your coach slow you down.

As long as your school is going, you should be affiliated with them. However, if no one from your school is participating it gets a little more complicated.  If no one else is competing, then you also need the permission of your coach and school. The rules are iffy about non-affiliated entries when it comes to ToC and Nats.  Either way, if both partners really want to try for Dallas, there is no harm in asking. Just understand the entire situation and that should help you to explain it."

Debate,2wn6wl,franktheclassic,2,Sat Feb 21 09:49:27 2015 UTC,"Easily the ELO rankings, no question. They measure every round based on not only who wins or loses but how good the opponent is. Debaterankings only takes into account quarters and on and doesn't take into account the difficulty of reaching those elim rounds. The ELO rankings account for teams having a very easy path to late outrounds, but one of the best things about the ELO rankings is that losing rounds lowers your rankings. A team that just does well at one tournament won't stay high on the rankings for long which is how it should be."
Debate,2wn6wl,pelican251,2,Thu Feb 26 22:35:44 2015 UTC,I'd guess VBriefly because I would argue that ELO systems are far more reliable in determining better teams than simply giving points for winning.
Debate,2wn6wl,Raorm,2,Mon Feb 23 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"I think ELO is better. The problem with Debate Rankings is it doesn't rank skill, it ranks wins, but the problem is, various different tournaments have different top teams and competitors, so you could win a national tournament but be the only 'good' team there (assuming there is a theoretical perfect list that could be created to be compared to). I think the most accurate way to figure this out is to rank what happens between teams and provide points based on what happens in those rounds, which is what ELO does. Sadly, it isn't perfect, but it does do what its trying to accomplish better than debate rankings: rank the top teams in some sort of order."
Debate,2wn6wl,metaman33,2,Mon Feb 23 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Debate Rankings. Because of judges. In prelims, judges tend to be more random and teams are more susceptible of judge-fudges and such other scenarios. Debate Rankings looks towards not how many judges pick a debater up, but how far they go in a tournament, which is determined by how good they can debate. Obviously, both have their flaws."
Debate,2wn6wl,lurbz,1 point,Tue Feb 24 02:28:05 2015 UTC,"Elo is not applicable to Debate, the system was developed for chess, which isn't the same thing at all.  Neither system is perfect.

Debate,2wn6wl,Clocking,2,Mon Feb 23 16:40:11 2015 UTC,In what significant way does chess differ from debate that makes the ELO system unusable? The ELO system would simply measure the win/loss outcome of each debate round: indistinguishable from the win/loss result similarly received from a chess match.
Debate,2wn6wl,Clocking,0,Mon Feb 23 23:55:48 2015 UTC,"4 ways   There is a definitive winner of a chess game. No judge, someone wins. There are a set number of outcomes a chess game can have, a big number, but a set number. Chess is always the same game. Debate's topics change. you can play hundred of chess games in a year and get definitive elo score, we just can't debate often enough to make full use of the system.   and it's Elo, not ELO. It's a guy's name. Doesn't stand for anything."
Debate,2wn6wl,autowikibot,4,Tue Feb 24 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"Brief overview, the only point you make that actually explains why some difference between chess and debate is #4, and everything else just asserts some random difference as crucial.   Debates don't end in indecision; someone always definitively wins. But to be charitable to your argument here, I'll assume you're arguing that judge fallibility can undermine the significance of a win. Judge variability, however, is just like any other confounding factor in any other game/sport: it comes part and parcel with the activity. Adaptation is, often times, half the battle and the best teams understand this. (and thus their ranking) Debates can have three outcomes: win, loss, and tie (in round robins). Chess has the exact same possibilities. Being charitable again and assuming you're talking about in-round permutations or possibilities in terms of argumentations, recognize that that's completely irrelevant. It doesn't matter how many ways there are to achieve a win because, at the end of the day, the win indicates one team's superiority, no matter the means.  Having variable topics has no bearing on whether or not the system can work because the recorded W/L is a measurement of each team's debating ability and not necessarily the substance of the debate. As a matter of fact, chess and debate keep a consistent format no matter when you play, such as rules of play and speech times, but the substance of the game changes every time, chess openings and different topics respectively. e.g: Opening with the Sicilian Defense vs the King's Gambit AND Economic Globalization vs GMOs: both result in different games in terms of what actually transpires, but the format remains the same. The two are analogous, therefore, in this respect. This is the one issue that does make some sense, however in relative terms, the system is still superior to debaterankings, because a measurement of tournament success is just as prone to random chance and luck and therefore it doesn't provide enough of a comparative benefit. One idea being thrown about is that the system be extended beyond one year, with the non-graduating teams left on, because the system doesn't unfairly advantage those who compete more. (this change would solve back the issue of a small data set) And one last benefit of the system is the ability to compare debaters from different years and seasons to each other using a more accurate measure than just looking the tournaments they placed at. (Tournament quality varies tremendously year-to-year) Overall, the slight inaccuracy incurred by the small data set is rendered irrelevant by its comparative benefits.

Then Spend 8 minutes trying to convince the judge to direct U.S funding into weed investments. Because, as we (the government) legalize weed, we slowly become the main owners of the U.S supply of legal weed.   Harms:  -Black market drug trade -Debt -violence -dehumanization  Solvencies:  We solve the black market when we legalize. But then, we trigger a solvency of debt by cashing in on profits following legalization and subsequent expansion of weed companies in our country. We solve Violence because violence is a direct result of a black market drug trade. Legalization decreases demand in the black market, which is violent. Thus, we limit violence. Finally, you link into a solvency of dehumanization. Currently, we dehumanize drug users by treating the plight of the user in the violence of the trade as if it is a sufficient trade off to limit drug use on a larger level. First, this is bad because weed isn't as harmful as you'd think. Second, Kant argues that people should not be means. We use the plight of humans as means to limit drug use. This dehumanizes.  Don't use dehumanization as the main voter in the impact calc, it's super weak, only there as an elementary spike. Just use limiting debt, paired with limiting violence in the trade."

Its simply not efficient to spend 60 Billion dollars to help the 5% of the people that can't currently afford CC. That 60 Billion would be better off going to other forms of CC. Currently about 50% of CC students have to take at least 1 remedial course. Less than 25 percent of remedial students at community colleges earn a certificate or degree within eight years. These problems stem from k-12 education not CC. All the benefits that we get from this resolution can not be found if those students don't graduate. Currently CC has a graduation rate of 32%.  Moreover theres evidence saying that students that don't have to pay for their college education have lower gpas than students that do. (of course these studies are from trust-fund students) but i feel like we can extrapolate that data to this resolution.  Basically i wanna argue: Lack of efficiency: many people can already afford CC, and its not wroth the 60B dollars to help pay for CC. And students will have lower GPAs. Money can be better Spent in other ways"

Debate,2whb9c,Trainer_Kyle,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:51:01 2015 UTC,There is a number even bigger than the 60bil outlined in the obama plan.(Be careful with 60bil b/c it is over 10yrs) I heard a figure of 340bil over 10yr @SWSDIT.
Debate,2whb9c,aadithyap,1 point,Mon Feb 23 03:45:09 2015 UTC,I'd be careful in saying most people don't go to CC because they don't want to go to college in general - there is quite a bit of literature proving the opposite.
Debate,2whb9c,aadithyap,7,Mon Feb 23 05:18:26 2015 UTC,"For those of you who don't know, the resolution is as follows: In the United States, students should be guaranteed two years of free tuition to a community or technical college."
Debate,2whb9c,UnlckyDuck,2,Sat Feb 21 20:09:13 2015 UTC,Ok would this be considered a counterplan or no: It would be a better use of our money to spend the money in other forms of public education such as public k-12 education and/or public colleges?
Debate,2whb9c,richardimr,3,Sat Feb 21 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"No that's not a counter plan, that's called an opportunity cost argument"
Debate,2whb9c,Argo4444,0,Mon Mar 9 05:41:01 2015 UTC,"ok thats what i figured, but the last time i did that our opponents said we provided a counter plan, and we were just like ummmm no it isn't."
Debate,2whb9c,EasternZone,4,Sat Feb 21 22:38:50 2015 UTC,Thats a counterplan. If you are advocating for an alternate implementation then by definition you are advocating for a counterplan. An opportunity cost argument would say that funding is being detracted from k-12.
Debate,2whb9c,db8er,1 point,Fri Feb 20 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"^ It's almost the same argument, but you have to word it correctly or it will come off as a counter plan."
Debate,2whb9c,Bringing_Sexy_Back,1 point,Sat Feb 21 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"I would say that the argument falls under a generic refutation. Because they aren't shifting the whole debate to whether or not to put more funding into K-12, I would say it isn't a counterplan."
Debate,2whb9c,exexpatriate,2,Sat Feb 21 16:04:58 2015 UTC,"For the con side, I'm thinking of running something along the lines of abusive for-profit schools (think ITT Tech). Would this work?"
Debate,2whb9c,mmurph123,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:32:49 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate a little bit more on that?
Debate,2whb9c,Argo4444,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:58:30 2015 UTC,"Sure. Essentially, my definition of technical schools overlaps with a definition of a for-profit college, and we see a lot of technical schools are operated at a profit. We see disgruntled staff, students harmed by predatory loans, and some for-profit schools basically scamming the government. Essentially, you paint for-profit technical schools as literal satan and then ask the judge why the feds would want to prop them up.  The reason I'm worried about it is because the link between for-profit and technical school isn't very strong."
Debate,2wkeb2,Babadookk,7,Fri Feb 20 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"Don't you think it's the other way around?  That rich and successful people are more attracted to a conservative viewpoint? Not to mention there are plenty of successful liberals and unsuccessful conservatives.  Your assumption is based on stereotypes, not to mention a ridiculous claim that they are ""more efficient and superior thinkers."""
Debate,2wkeb2,MylesofTexas,2,Fri Feb 20 17:51:58 2015 UTC,"1) They aren't superior thinkers, nor are they more efficient. The very fact that you'd make this post using a hypothesis contrary to fact proves that that isn't true. Or at least, that you're the exception to the rule.   2) It's more likely that the rich simply benefit more from the republican platform than that success is derived from believing in what republicans support.   And being from the deep south, it is extremely easy to find unsuccessful conservatives.Trust me. You're mixing up the cause and effect.   And I just took a brief glance through your post history, wow. I don't know what your fascination is with trying to overgeneralize black people like me as ghetto or ""street', but I suggest you get over it."

I know that when I went to watch a prelim domestic round last year for fun, the judge disclosed to me that he had ranked speaker one last place. I thought that he was the best speaker. Is there any specific judging preference to look out for at nats?"
Debate,2w1447,JPrimack,2,Mon Feb 16 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"Not really. Just clearly answer the question with three separate points, speak confidently in a relaxed manner, and also try to show the judge why the question is important."
Debate,2w1447,JPrimack,5,Mon Feb 16 17:04:35 2015 UTC,"I've competed at NSDAs twice in DX, doing pretty well both times(13th and semis sophomore year, 4th  and finals junior year).  -going over time is ok, as long as you're under 7:15  -the tournament releases topic areas a couple months in advance. File them from the day they release.  -find friends from your district at the tournament - being a stranger in a room of hundreds of extempers is a little scary.  -Have fun! Qualifying as a sophomore is very impressive, and you'll get a great chance to see great extempers from across the country."
Debate,2w1447,JPrimack,3,Tue Feb 17 15:20:53 2015 UTC,"Jesus christ, congrats on doing that well! I know that NSDA releases speaking videos of finals occasionally. Do they have any of you that I could watch?   Thanks for the advice!  Edit: I am such a stalker, found you immediately. You were exactly the kind of guy I was hoping would find this post.  A few questions:   1) Is there any type of topic to avoid completely?  2) Do judges tend to prefer a specific style of intro?  3) What is the best way to organize points? General, specific, or what?  Thanks!"
Debate,2w1447,cammyblove,6,Tue Feb 17 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"1) Yes. Know your files and avoid topics that aren't well filed on. You should also avoid topics that people could hold extremely strong political convictions on. Last year, a friend of mine was knocked out in semis for taking a pretty liberal take on a question when half his panel were conservative Midwestern judges. For IX, I think the relevant comparison would be taking an emotional issue in foreign policy, ex. Israel/Palestine, and not taking a 'grey' stance on it - pushing one side's perspective. 2) Not really. Because judges are diverse, you can pretty much go for anything. In general, I'd go for topical introductions that can be somewhat funny or emotionally heavy as long as they don't feel canned(written in advance of the tournament and memorized). 3) There really isn't a 'best way' to structure points. The way I usually organize each substantive point is Ontop Analysis -> Argument Tag -> Subpoint A -> Subpoint B -> Impact/Solution/Etc.  The videos of me online aren't exactly my best speeches. As it happens, I was recording Harvard finals yesterday and now have the entire video online. While each of the speakers is very strong, I think Shawn and Eitan represent the type of speaking that tends to do very well at Nationals.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP4X0KfzQ5CMdZjyZ--C1F42e0GmqCknb  Let me know if you have more questions!"
Debate,2w1447,cammyblove,2,Tue Feb 17 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the advice!  1) How is Extemp Draw at nats?   2) Do they check everyone for internet connection? I'd like someone to verify my lack of connection, because I use Gmail offline, and I don't want someone to mistake that for a connection and DQ me.   Thank you so much!"
Debate,2w1447,elephantower,2,Tue Feb 17 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"1) Everyone in a giant gym, questions are in a styrofoam tray and not an envelope. DX and IX are separated but in the same room.  2) There've been a few people each year DQed for setting up hotspots in the draw area. I personally use an offline email client for some of my files, and it's never caused trouble. As long as you don't connect to the Internet can explain the program you're using you'll be fine."

Debate,2w1447,elephantower,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"I go to school with Patrick, one of the extempers that was linked to, and all I can say that I've seen him do is giving a shit ton of practice speeches and working on hand motion especially. The National IX Champ last year, Arel Rende, went to my high school and both of the have really good presence. I don't have much insight as to answering questions, but the best advice I can give from watching these guys is to give a bunch of practice speeches and pay attention to your critiques. Focus on your weaknesses and address them."

Debate,2w1447,elephantower,1 point,Fri Feb 20 02:37:03 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that there's a preferred style, but a lot of people get into a habit of moving one hand non stop as if it's helping them to get the words out. It's really distracting and takes a lot away from your speech. I would suggest you always keep in mind what your hands are doing and only use them when you're bringing up new evidence, explaining the magnitude of an impact, or moving to a different point."
Debate,2w1447,JPrimack,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:10:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for recording Harvard finals! Can you explicate the particular qualities of Shawn (who I thought was a relatively weak speaker) and Eitan that would make them compelling at Nationals? Also, do you know if there was anything in particular that caused Mark Rinder to get 6th? His speech seemed quite good, and his style similar to my own. (I'm an IX competitor prepping for my Natquals, btw)"
Debate,2w1447,MrFunEGUY,2,Mon Mar 9 06:39:53 2015 UTC,"Shawn is not a particularly commanding speaker, but his analysis is very logical, and he cites an extremely large number of statistics. He speaks in clear, grammatically correct sentences.   Eitan also isn't a commanding speaker, but he draws together his analysis very well, and answers the question very precisely. His mention of faith-based groups and building community ties, while not exaggerating the pope's influence, was very appealing. You'll notice that Eitan knows exactly what he wants to say, and obviously is extremely well read on the topic of his speech.  Mark doesn't speak in grammatically correct sentences, made a questionable and canned joke at the beginning of his speech, and uses weird jargon(we can see, we understand essentially, however, when it comes to) that you'd never find in a normal conversation. It helps that he has a low voice, but otherwise I think his style is very unattractive. His logic in his speech and CX is very exaggerated - the Pope obviously can't stop Boko Haram(as Eitan points out), just because an African court can't check a terrorist organization isn't a compelling reason to not have an African court, and it's unrealistic to imagine that African diplomatic relations will fall apart after an exit from the ICC. I just don't believe most of what he says, and neither did the judges or audience in finals. Remember, extemp is supposed to be about making accurate claims, not ridiculous assertions."
Debate,2w1447,Gwendoleyn,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:09:04 2015 UTC,"I'd better listen more carefully to each of these. I must admit (with the exception of Eitan, because I recognized his name from Extemp Central), I simply played it in the background while working on other things to get an idea of vocal cadence and basic structure. It seems I missed some important points (I thought Mark was perfectly convincing).   Listening again, I agree, Mark's intro irks me (I particularly dislike canned intros; not sure how I missed that!), and his speech is less convincing than the others. I still like vocal style, though. Also, Shawn's intro seemed similarly weak.   In summary, then, NSDA nationals specifically elevates logical conclusions, copious evidence, clarity of thought, and topic knowledge over speaking style? To be honest, after watching Adelman's 2014 finals speech, I had drawn the opposite conclusion (he seems to only use a few sources, and his points are well-explained and interesting but don't seem to draw on extensive background knowledge or unique arguments).   EDIT: Grossly misspelled name :("
Debate,2w1447,ConverseToothbrush,2,Thu Mar 12 03:55:07 2015 UTC,"Well, Dylan's speech in finals was the subject of some interesting discussion afterwards. He went 8:40 or something, and went for a full-blown emotional appeal. I don't think most people can pull that off - keep in mind what works on the finals stage doesn't necessarily work in prelims and outrounds. Of course, the reverse is true. My speech in USX finals last year was one that might have worked very well in a quarter or semifinal, but lacked the pizzazz to do well on the stage.  In general, you're right about what NSDA nationals wants, especially topic knowledge. If you can couple that with an ok speaking style, you'll get pretty far, farther if you can be coherent while doing that."

Debate,2vx6rq,United14,7,Sat Feb 14 23:42:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds like only 2 teams qualified for Nats in that case.  If 3 teams qualify, there are 5 teams left, and 1 is undefeated, then yes, the undefeated byes to Nats and the remaining 4 debate to determine the remaining spots."
Debate,2vx6rq,stewartwonderbear,2,Sun Feb 15 14:01:46 2015 UTC,That's what made sense to me but no being the last undefeated team we still debated two more rounds. Also of the last 4 teams we were the only ones without a bye in the tournament
Debate,2vx6rq,stewartwonderbear,5,Sun Feb 15 14:24:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah...the requirements for a bye are tough.  As long as you are undefeated, you will not be eligible for a bye. Once you lost, there wasn't a need for a bye since there were only 4 teams left.  In your situation, if you had won that first round, you would have qualified flat out, and the 2 remaining teams would have debated another round to determine the second qualifier.  After you lost, there were 4 teams left, 2 debates, and the 2 winners advanced.  Those are the rules, as cruel as they are."
Debate,2vx6rq,Zeus1325,2,Sun Feb 15 14:27:36 2015 UTC,I guess so it's just tough going from believing we got a auto bid to nats and instead becoming 1st alternate
Debate,2vx6rq,stewartwonderbear,1 point,Sun Feb 15 14:29:40 2015 UTC,"not how it works, check the rules. If a bye is necessary then the bye is drawn randomly from the remaining contestants left, if there are undefeateds left, the undefeated bracket is paired first, which might be against a down one"
Debate,2vx6rq,Zeus1325,5,Tue Feb 24 03:06:42 2015 UTC,"As the auditor for my district for the past 10 years, I am aware of the rules. I'll try to type slowly. A bye is always given to a once defeated who has lost to a current undefeated. If there is nobody meeting those criteria, then it goes to a random once defeated. In the above scenario, there were 5 teams left, one undefeated. If three teams advance to nationals, the rules change. The undefeated gets the bye, and the remaining 4 once defeated teams debate to determine the remaining 2 qualifiers.  In his situation, since only 2 teams qualified, the bye was drawn from a team he had beaten. The remaining 4 were paired up. He lost, one team was eliminated, and the bye remained for a total of 4 once defeated teams. One last debate left 2 teams standing. Losing both of those meant OP was an alternate.   Want to know about the scenario if a district qualifies 4? Boom. <drops mic>"

Debate,2vx6rq,Zeus1325,1 point,Sun Feb 15 16:41:28 2015 UTC,Hopefully the thing is out of the two teams that qualified one is really close friends with my partner and I and we were hoping it would be us and them going together. But instead the team that took our spot are the most conceded pricks especially their second speaker who will always cut you off during crossfire and believes he gets an endless stream of questions and you get none. It sucks cause we already beat them earlier in the day but now they are taking what should be our spot at nationals.

Both kicked some ass at Berkeley and Stanford. But in terms of Mission KS, I would be very scared of them if I was paired to them. On the east coast, we don't hear much about small public school teams in the west. What we do hear about are two freshmen who final at two of the largest invitational of the year. Especially when they beat our NCFL semifinalists (Lake Highland SD) in quarters. I saw them debate at Berkeley and their skill level as freshmen is just crazy. They have potential to octa at the TOC this year, and I'd be scared for the debate circuit twhen they're seniors. Again, Harker KG and Amador GS are both amazing teams, but don't judge Mission till you hit them."
Debate,2vqph3,Smarvin,2,Thu Feb 19 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"I voted for AB in the Sem. Most of their responses fell in line with, in my view, the correct interpretation of the resolution.  At the same time I could see how Mission won that round. We each just differed in our judging preferences.  Amador had been the dark horse of the tournament. They've always been very talented, but coming in if you were to ask who would be in finals Amador wouldn't have been in most answers. Mission was at least more likely.  Besides mission just had a repeat in finals against Harker."
Debate,2vqph3,SquidHatSalmon,3,Thu Feb 19 09:43:42 2015 UTC,it looks like Mission KS was prety good if they made finals of Berkeley and Stanford. too bad they lost in both finals (Harker and Amedor)

Debate,2vdk7v,michaelg2000,3,Tue Feb 10 03:03:29 2015 UTC,"I am a coach. As a debater I went to six weeks of debate camp, three before my junior, and senior year respectively.   Yes.   Debate camp is worthwile."
Debate,2vdk7v,babeigotastewgoing,3,Tue Feb 10 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"Camp is awesome. I like to think of it as an investment. If you want to be a serious debater, you have to go to camp. Yes, it can be expensive (depending on where you go), but I think it is very worth it. If you are looking for a less expensive camp, I recommend WSDI (Weber State Debate Institute), but if you can afford more, I would go for something like Harvard or Victory Briefs Institute. Not only that, but the relations you build with people from other teams is great."
Debate,2vdk7v,aspentreeee,2,Wed Feb 11 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"I think it absolutely is worth it. That kind of intense, focused practice only makes you better. The right camp can build additional skills that will help you make your team better as well. I help run a debate camp precisely because I think it is a very useful tool for building skills, and building a sense of community."
Debate,2vdk7v,IAmScience,2,Tue Feb 10 05:42:40 2015 UTC,"If a person truly wants to be competitive and if debate is more than just a hobby, debate camp is a must."

Debate,2vdk7v,llamalord,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:00:33 2015 UTC,It depends on the event and it depends on the camp. What are you looking for specifically?

Debate,2vdk7v,stewartwonderbear,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:54:34 2015 UTC,Confirmed. Went to swsdi over the summer and was great
Debate,2vdk7v,jswiftydowell,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:24:01 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the Camp/Event.  There are some camps that, while fun, may not have the impact that you are looking for. I think the most important thing to identify is what you want to get out of it. If you are fully focused on getting better at debate, then camp helps but you still need to choose the right one for your current and desired skill level."
Debate,2vdk7v,Smarvin,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"if you can afford it, debate camp is completely worthy of your time. i went to high school and college debate camp and learned an immense amount about debate, researching, and basically life in general. it also provides you with a lot of resources that you may not otherwise have access to, which for me was huge because my HS program was severely underfunded. there are kids from all over the place there that you're likely to make strong bonds with. camp shenanigans are some of my best memories from high school and college. and it will probably improve you as a competitor.   definitely worth it."
Debate,2vdk7v,yachterotter,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:54:10 2015 UTC,"I would say that while camp is fun and helpful, it really depends on what you are looking to get out of it. If you want to increase your prowess on the national circuit and develop skills that you already possess, then I would absolutely encourage you to go. On the other hand, if you are just starting out and need more basic instruction and guidance, camp may not be the most effective way to accomplish that (both cost wise and time wise). What specifically do you want to get out of Camp?"
Debate,2vdk7v,lax_bro16,0,Tue Feb 10 07:06:26 2015 UTC,Best time to go to camp is in between Sophomore and Junior year or Junior and Senior to really get the full effect of debate camp. Otherwise its kind of a waste since you will still be learning debate as a whole.
Debate,2vd0hc,bubblycrim,7,Tue Feb 10 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"Hey! Congress coach here.  The goal in almost every circuit of Congress is to have a fluid delivery with very few stumbles, and make a good, new argument in every point.  At the bottom of every point, respond to arguments previously made. If you have done another form of debate, think of it as crossapplying your point to opponents' points.  Speak extemporaneously and bring only an outline with sources. Use 1-2 sources per point, and provide specifics. Judges also like to see you make an impact at the bottom of every point. Talk about why your argument should mean other congresspeople vote in either direction.  Berkeley's a big tournament, so make sure to have good research on every bill in prelims.  Also stand up to ask questions during every questioning period. Your job isn't to give 2 speeches and mope around, it's to consistently show that a judge should place you high in the chamber.  Hope you do well!"
Debate,2vd0hc,Jfqian,6,Tue Feb 10 03:02:26 2015 UTC,"Reposting some advice I gave in this sub a few weeks ago.   I've pretty much done congo exclusively for three years so I'll try to help you.  • Make sure you mention other senators in your speech. Refutation is the most important part of any speech.  • Have good posture when you speak, act confident and be loud, but not too loud.  • In questioning make sure you move closer to the senator that is questioning you, don't answer their question from the other side of the room.   • If you want to do well at a local tourney, don't be the presiding officer, inexperienced judges will not notice you since your job is to not be noticed, but a good presiding officer will be appreciated by judges on the national circuit.   • Be friendly with other people in the chamber, they can help you out of a pinch.  • Don't be the third speech in a row for one side of the argument unless you have a speech that is completely original.  • Try to avoid rehashing others points as much as possible, judges hate that.  • In questioning, make sure your questions and answers are straight forward and short.   • Be nice to the judges! They will appreciate that.  These are just a few tips, congress is a lot more in depth than just this list. Good luck in congo!"

One thing that made a big difference,  speak extemporaneously, at least, don't bring up any papers, take notes at your desk, then go up empty-handed. It looks better, and typically the quality of your speeches don't go down too much, but maybe I'm just different because I also do impromptu.   Good luck."

Debate,2v597d,hZf,7,Sun Feb 8 04:41:31 2015 UTC,I appreciate this post. Debate is a positive sharing of ideas to see issues in a more well rounded way. I see this sub as an extension of that. People should have the ideal of encouraging education in the debate community. Oh well just make the most of it and try to set a precedent!
Debate,2v597d,fleamarketninja,7,Sun Feb 8 23:27:39 2015 UTC,"I come from a lay/traditional circuit that allowed a person who had an unwarranted standard of util and  unwarranted contentions of property rights to break all the way to semifinals in OPEN at one of the biggest tournaments in the state. I happened to drop to this person in prelims from a judge who hates my guts.  Seeing myself qualifying from this circuit is tough. Don't know how to prepare for something like this other than learn how to speak prettier and become one with the system of screaming ""this is morally unright and unjust"" at the judge(literally how every freaking round goes)."

Debate,2uql19,Clusterfist,3,Wed Feb 4 17:53:13 2015 UTC,i've heard definitions of poverty as intellectual poverty so whoever proves better access to education wins because they solve for a general lack of knowledge.

Debate,2uql19,fleamarketninja,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"This is the worst way death=good has been argued that I've seen. Regardless, I'd come back with theory about why that argument is bad for debate+the resolution. Also, Id say death is the worst form of poverty. AKA if poverty defeats you, you die. Thus, there's an increase in poverty from extinction."
Debate,2uql19,CaptainDave13,3,Wed Feb 4 21:07:04 2015 UTC,I never say death good. I literally identify the win condition within the resolution as who reduces poverty more. I obviously define poverty pretty explicitly in the case and I doubt other competitors will preempt this with a definition that specifies that poverty is possible while dead.

They all immediately say it's awful without seeing any of the actual writing. Not really fair! Also, people seem to forget that really, why do we do this activity but to enjoy ourselves? Let's talk about extinction! Death solves poverty! Sure why not? It's about proving points. Debate chiefly teaches defending an argument you know not to be 100% valid."

Refutation is the most important part of any speech. Have good posture when you speak, act confident and be loud, but not too loud. In questioning make sure you move closer to the senator that is questioning you, don't answer their question from the other side of the room.  If you want to do well at a local tourney, don't be the presiding officer, inexperienced judges will not notice you since your job is to not be noticed. Be friendly with other people in the chamber, they can help you out of a pinch. Don't be the third speech in a row for one side of the argument unless you have a speech that is completely original. Try to avoid rehashing others points as much as possible, judges hate that. In questioning, make sure your questions and answers are straight forward and short.  Be nice to the judges! They will appreciate that.   These are just a few tips, congress is a lot more in depth than just this list. Good luck in congo!"

Im a sophomore going to Harvard next weekend and TFA State in march. So most importantly, be active in the chamber. Im not just talking about the # of speeches. I talking about ask as many questions as possible, try to be able to make motions because that will make the judges think you know your shit. Secound is prepare evidence. Have at least 2 aff and 2 neg points for each legislation you will be debating. Some believe you can go up and basically extemp the whole thing in Congress, but let me tell u that is not true. Next is quality over quantity. Don't be the dumb ass who gives 5 really crappy speeches and gets like 2 points for each speech. Now try to give as many as possible, but if you know u can't make a good speech on a certain topic, don't give a speech on that one, just do a lot of questioning.

Surely it is not expected that every student needs to buy a personal copy.   I am not advocating for the furthering of these posts, and I think they are actually pretty annoying, but there is some arbitrary line that should be identified."
Debate,2t8rsm,serendipitybot,4,Thu Jan 22 22:50:45 2015 UTC,"For instance, is it illegal for a coach to distribute a brief to the members of a team   IANAL, but that depends on what sort of license you purchase. If you're authorized to distribute it to certain people (or up to a certain number of people) by the seller/producer, then it's fair game.   Surely it is not expected that every student needs to buy a personal copy.   It might be, but that's up to the producers/sellers and even if it's stupid we can't legally do anything about it other than not buying the product.  But yeah, there's definitely some parts that confuse me. It's probably under the ""remix"" part of copyright law since the evidence in these briefs is not produced by the companies that make them- there's a lot of things that aren't clear to me.  However, what needs to be clear (with regard to moderation policy on this sub) is pretty clear- no matter what we want to do, we can't have these posts. We have to remove them, and that's totally cool. However, when they proliferate and we remove them (we try to be pretty lax moderators because debate can't thrive without free discourse, so they're the majority of posts we remove), they train the spamfilter to take out legitimate posts as well. I don't know what algorithm the filter uses, but most spam filters I know of rely heavily on machine learning (I can't really think of a way to make an effective one that deals with a lot of data that doesn't rely on ML) and there's a lot of things you can screw up a binary classification algorithm (""spam"" or ""not-spam"") with if you give it the wrong training data- based on my rudimentary understanding of ML."

Debate,2sysld,publicforumdude,7,Tue Jan 20 06:35:12 2015 UTC,"Some unique arguments I was running:  Neg: Imperialism. UN Offensive Action throws a sense of imperialism onto a host country. This triggers terrorist counter action. We had a warrant that quantified a spike in terrorism when offensive force was used in a host country.  Aff: Natural Resources. When offensive action is used, the UN can seize back diamond mines from terrorist groups who are selling those diamonds to fund their regime. Then, we read a card that said terrorism in Southern Africa is fueled by stolen diamonds.  Spillover Effect. We had a big warrant story that said the only reason why we see violence in the Congo today is because we failed to stop it in Rwanda and Bosnia etc. these foreign fighters triggered the violence in DRC. Had offensive action stopped past genocide, we wouldn't even see violence in the Congo today. Because current violence is just spillover, once it is stopped, we won't see violence in Congo for a sustained period. Combine that with a genocide prevention point and effectiveness of offensive action point and you can solve for violence in the past, present, and future."

Debate,2sysld,rogarze,3,Thu Jan 22 12:18:08 2015 UTC,"For affirmative arguments, I recommend the following: Terrorism, you can argue that the UN is equipped to fight ISIS. Also there is evidence that terror in Africa won't end because all current efforts lack proper equipment while the UN DOES have proper resources to combat African terror. You can talk about how offensive missions take down corrupt regimes, allow weapon seizures to prevent genocide which relates to Rwanda, etc. Deterrence s another decent option. For the negative, structural violence occurring through increased militarism. Only do imperialism if you have great links and impacts such as resource extraction but it is very hard to run. The UN being the wrong actor isnt too bad of an option, or that the enemy becomes stronger or violence increases.

Debate,2sysld,Thornwell,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:05:14 2015 UTC,Offensive defined as repulsive. Maintaining latrines is repulsive but also stops disease. Saves a ton of lives. Vaccines are literally penetrating people. Also saves lives. Also no one dies.

Debate,2svfpe,rozyrowen,3,Sun Jan 18 22:38:10 2015 UTC,"former debater here  1) what problems r u exactly having; ehen you lose/win, the judge says how you can improve and thats the best advice anyone can give, follow it to the dot. Affs are mostly trial and error  2)seems to me that you shouldnt have those definitions, they r wasting time  recognize that a negative is not going to dispute all those definitions, and if they do, it is a time skew... all those definitions are a tine suck for your team.  you should also sneak those in the  l8er speeches to further solidify your stances or to counter neg  i like to think of the aff as your in a spaceship being chased by another space ship  you shoot back at the neg with case and counter args to their off case (their bullets fired at you are offcase)  they can drop the offcase or case (they can self distruct all of those bullets fired as long as one hits your ship) as long as one is a solid argument which puts doubt in the judges mind"
Debate,2svfpe,mp3nerd31,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:14:34 2015 UTC,"in MY debate league, EVERYONE attacks undefined terms from the resolved :( the main issue involves them not understanding anything and acting as though what they say is true. The one common argument they make is that we shouldn't invest in the plan bc there MAY not be any cures. It's a really easy point to counter (I do so by stating that sitting around doing nothing about the problem at hand is a guaranteed way to ensure NOT finding a cure, and by bringing up a Schrodinger-like statement that there probability is equal between there being and not being cures.)  The judges just do their judge-y stupid thing and don't listen to what I have to say.  My physical and verbal presence is very well put together too, so it's not that.  It's just efiqjeofijqeo frustrating."
Debate,2svfpe,mp3nerd31,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"is the undefined terms under topicality? your teams files should have a large compilation of counter args to undefined terms  look through it or ask a coach/more experienced player/partner. if eveyone has it as an arg, then always have it on hand haha  on terms of the chance that there may not be a cure  simply counter with try or die, if we dont try we will be killed by x disease haha  you should have why finding a cure is important in ur aff, jusy extend that evidence by giving an overview (remember, why r u doing the aff plan god dangit. what justifies that spending)   maybe find a arg which states that money is not a factor, lives cannot be weighed against tangible/monetery values  gotta hammer in the impact of your aff  if your plan doesnt happen, what bad thats going to happen"
Debate,2svfpe,panzercaptain,3,Sun Jan 18 23:44:14 2015 UTC,"Not a policy debater, but I have many years of experience debating and coaching.   your case is structured terribly. this makes it difficult for your judge to flow. If the judge can't flow it then they won't vote for it. Additionally your only argument is basically ""the plan works"" but it's very poorly laid out, enough so that when I read the speech I'm not even convinced it works. your case has very little solvency. there's nothing about how exactly providing grants will lead to the development of newer, more effective vaccines, or about how many people those vaccines will save. You need some evidence that says the problems could be solved with more grant money. you need some additional advantages, the more the better. The 1AC is an opportunity to throw as much out there as possible because your opponents can't say anything about it. Instead, you waste a lot of time on intros and definitions (defining oceans? seriously? just tell them that the definitions are contextualized and prepare some 2AC T blocks) that you could be using to make heg/econ/etc advantages."
Debate,2svfpe,FunkMasterFranklin,2,Mon Jan 19 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"can you give me some tips on formatting? it's difficult for me to fit so much in such little time/space.  the solvency is in tact due to the goal of our plan not necessarily to develop cures, but to allow a larger number of interested parties to research the topic. In the end of the 2nd aff, we reference a TIME article talking about how null results are equally valuable to positive results. we HAVE to define oceans :(. It's absolutely ridiculous. In our league, it's standard to define terms or get RIPPED ON for not doing so.  E.G. One team may define Ocean as ""a large expanse of something"" (which teams do and proceed to talk about the desert) Teams will fuck your shit on inadequate definitions as well. No one knows why, but topicality attacks regarding definitions of the resolved / technicalities are ubiquitous in our league."
Debate,2svfpe,panzercaptain,6,Mon Jan 19 16:33:02 2015 UTC,That sounds like a fucking awful league. I can hear the education of the debate draining away.
Debate,2svfpe,oxygentlemen,3,Wed Jan 21 05:51:38 2015 UTC,"It's a shitty league with a few kids that are actually...good at what they do. Our plans have to be REALLLYYYYYY fucking specific, and NONE of the judges are familiar with the rules of debate. The only school with a concentration of good judges is my own, meaning I RARELY get a good judge on a VARSITY level. Also, there are a LOT of dumb debaters. (dumb debaters + dumb judges = tons of bullshit)  HOWEVER, our league DOES have some very talented kids in it, and it's genuinely fun to go against them."
Debate,2svfpe,danliu1229,3,Wed Jan 21 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"First on structure. It should go like this: framework, contention 1 (inherency), plan text, contention 2 (solvency) based on the way your speech is laid out already. Right now it's just a bunch of words that aren't very organized. Structuring it will make your speech easier to understand and flow.  Regarding solvency: I read the handbook that someone else posted, and it appears to me that in your league, solvency is THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF DEBATE. With that in mind, you need to pull out your good solvency cards in the 1AC, not leave them until the end of the 2AC. There are no arguments in the 1AC as to why your plan text works, or what makes it work, or what specifically those benefits entail.   On definitions: How common is it to run T in your league? I figure you can just define the most important terms, say that the rest are contextualized (because once you read the plan text, the plan becomes the focus of debate, rather than the resolution), and prepare some kickass T overviews for the 2AC (mainly on predictability). You really need to trim the fat and add some ADVANTAGES. Besides solving the problem, what GOOD does your plan do?  edit: here's an example of a well-formatted medical microbes aff: http://openev.debatecoaches.org/bin/download/2014/Northwestern/Medical%20Microbes%20Aff%20-%20Northwestern%202014.docx"

Debate,2ssjuy,jswiftydowell,17,Sun Jan 18 02:13:40 2015 UTC,"At my last tournament a judge didn't critique anyone (or disclose) because she ""didn't want to do our coach's job for her"". Another time a judge thought the round was over after the 2NC and she wouldn't let us finish the round. She also didn't understand our warming args and yet she claimed to be an Environmental Science teacher."
Debate,2ssjuy,karankaushal,10,Sun Jan 18 02:56:35 2015 UTC,I think this is where you petition for a double win at tab
Debate,2ssjuy,Hoganbeardy,4,Sun Jan 18 04:50:09 2015 UTC,"As a judge, I don't usually disclose or give OC. I think it's important to respect everyone's time, and frankly the debaters don't want to hear me talk. I do write a thorough ballot and tell the debaters that if they have specific questions after the round or after they see my ballot, they can ask. But honestly, I don't like it when I give my decision and the kid who dropped starts arguing with me."
Debate,2ssjuy,ItsOnDVR,8,Sun Jan 18 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"You should at least disclose. I always give brief, but in-depth analysis at the end of the round too. Usually, the kids understand that if they lose my ballot, they actually lost it. But sometimes, they like to argue and that's when I start dropping 1 speaking point for every 20 seconds of my time they waste yelling at me."
Debate,2ssjuy,Thornwell,5,Sun Jan 18 16:57:16 2015 UTC,"Disclosing isn't too common on my circuit, so I have no problems forgoing it.  As a debater, I never saw much benefit in critiques right after the round because rarely was it something I could immediately change (that's the only time when I will say something), and more often than not judges that give oral critiques also give sparse ballots because of it.  And like I said, if a debater approaches me later in the tournament or online, I have no problems telling them how I voted and why.  I've seen so many tournaments get terribly slowed down by judges that just want to hear themselves talk and go on and on that I'm not willing to slow the tournament down when I can just fill out my ballot and make myself approachable."
Debate,2ssjuy,ItsOnDVR,4,Sun Jan 18 23:42:28 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. My High School circuit did not disclose, ever. It wasn't annoying since I thought everywhere was like that. I usually try to keep my comments short. The real thing that slows down tournaments is when a judge doesn't pick up their ballot on time."
Debate,2ssjuy,Thornwell,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:50:17 2015 UTC,Do you write you email on ballots? How exactly would one go about talking to judges after ballot distribution?
Debate,2ssjuy,elephantower,1 point,Fri Feb 6 01:37:29 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty small circuit, so the debaters recognize or know me (or their coaches do).  My email is on my paradigm, which is easily accessible to them."
Debate,2ssjuy,ItsOnDVR,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:28:32 2015 UTC,In our circuit we're asked not to disclose. That's what the ballot is for.
Debate,2ssjuy,legumey,24,Sat Mar 7 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see the opposite of this: judges, describe some debaters who just didn't get it.  Because I could tell you some horror stories!"
Debate,2ssjuy,SeayaB,13,Sun Jan 18 08:41:52 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I have so many. A bit of background on me, I was the college Parli national champ in 2011. I know some things about debate, I'm not just a dumbass judge. There have been many times people have been angry with me over a decision.   Most of these are... well, not worth recounting. They're just entitled people who cannot understand why they lost and who are angry about it. But, there were a few that I, to this day, find hilarious or bizarre. I'll recount two especially great ones for you. I'll obscure the details to some extent.  You don't understand your own card  This has happened to me a few times, when people make an argument or read a card and then draw an impact from it that in no way follows from the argument.  Sometimes, it's just that things are poorly explained. But, not always...  A few years ago in LD, I saw a kid read a card in a round to support his standard. It was some boilerplate stuff from a philosopher to support his standard.  What was weird was that, if you listened to the card, it seemed to actually refute his standard. Neither of the kids in the round were great, it was round 2 at Harvard, so I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and called the card to see if he had just misspoke--which he might have. It was only a small wording change that would have made it support his side.  Yea, he didn't. Since it was the only thing holding up his standard, I had to vote him down, there were no other arguments he'd made that could survive without his standard. (It was a sadly undiverse case.)  I sat with him for like 20 minutes trying to explain to him what his card meant. His opponent clearly grasped it immediately, but he didn't. This is literally the only time I'd seen this happen, with an argument as simple as the one he was making.   And he didn't appear to just be stubborn. Oh, I've seen that enough, or trolling. He clearly was just not getting it at all.  It's not my fault you gave yourself a stupid burden!  The worst thing you can do is give yourself an unnecessary burden. If you don't need to give yourself a burden, don't do it. Now, sometimes, people misuse the word burden and it's usually clear, so I try to give them the benefit of the doubt.  This isn't a story about that.  There was a parli team, who was quite good, who decided to fuck around against some bad novices. They started off their first opposition speech with, ""Our burden in this round is to prove that morality doesn't exist."" This burden was totally unnecessary, it had no place in the round. It was just a bizarre thing. I know what you're thinking, I thought the same thing. Just keep with me here.  They proceed to give three minutes of analysis meeting that burden. The arguments weren't totally terrible. The bad novices made a single argument against it. The argument was okay, it should have been trivial to refute if they only... well they dropped it. The novices drew it through in the rebuttal.  Silly me, I too the phrase, ""our burden in the round is"" to mean that it was their burden in the round. They didn't quite see it that way when I disclosed that I'd dropped them.   They were so angry with me.  I have a bunch more of these stories, so many of them from years of judging, if people are interested."
Debate,2ssjuy,Nemnel,5,Mon Jan 19 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"care to share them? i've heard seldom few stories from the judges about horror debaters, only horror judges."
Debate,2ssjuy,shits_mcgee,9,Sun Jan 18 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"I judged a round with two novices.  One was running something a little bit different than most, and his opponent clearly did not know how to refute it, so he called abuse.  (It was not in any way abusive, I think he just had heard it the previous round and decided to say it.)  His opponent explained why it was not abusive, but this debater decided that was going to become his main argument.  He literally spent an entire CX saying, ""You are abusing me.  Excuse me sir, you are abusing me.  Judge, please.  You are abusing me.""  I'm not exaggerating, for every question, abuse was the answer."
Debate,2ssjuy,ItsOnDVR,14,Sun Jan 18 23:47:25 2015 UTC,that kid could go places as a theory debater...
Debate,2ssjuy,shits_mcgee,5,Mon Jan 19 00:45:08 2015 UTC,I love this story.
Debate,2ssjuy,Nemnel,2,Mon Jan 19 01:39:52 2015 UTC,This happened to me sort of. I was debating puf and the kid asked the first question and I tried to answer it  and I would say half of a sentence he would say I know where your gong with this and then attack what I was going to say every single time I spoke. I asked him if I could have a question and he said not until I'm done explaining. I yelled at him because he wouldn't let me answer and kept interrupting me. The judge likes it and we win. On the ballot it said way top stock up for yourself kid
Debate,2ssjuy,Kadenz1,9,Thu Jan 29 23:21:21 2015 UTC,"I think the worst was when a guy thought he could just make up a bunch of evidence and facts because the topic was pretty obscure and no one would know better.  Sadly for him, I had taken a course in college on the topic, and knew that the things he said we're false.  There was one time that a guy's speech was so incomprehensible that I spaced completely out, until I hear him shout ""giant killer space robots,"" at which point I basically decided the other team had won.   I could tell dozens of stories about debaters who ask what my preferences are, and then say ""oh"" and completely ignore them.  If you don't really care and are just going to run your one thing you have no matter what, then don't bother asking.   There was also a debater who left in the middle of an opponent's speech because his mom had brought him food.   I could continue."
Debate,2ssjuy,SeayaB,5,Sun Jan 18 17:56:53 2015 UTC,Shouldn't it be up to the other team to call him out on his bullshit?
Debate,2ssjuy,Nonmir,2,Sun Jan 18 23:02:32 2015 UTC,"This was in an LD round, actually, so the other guy was mostly attacking his value arguments, as he should be.  It turns out, even if the guy hadn't just made up stats, he would have lost because the other guy just had better arguments, and stated them more eloquently.  But, I'm sure he was used to just getting away with it, because not many people have much knowledge of trade markets in southeast Asia."

Debate,2ssjuy,ExcaliburMXVI,24,Sun Jan 18 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds like most of you guys are right to complain about bad judging, but sometimes I think some overestimate their communication skills.  I judged a lot of debate this weekend and I had to sit through slur stutter spread debaters who also tended to be rude and generally unpleasant.  I am positive they did not win, but I'm also positive they think they win every round."
Debate,2ssjuy,adobefootball,25,Mon Jan 19 01:31:01 2015 UTC,"Debaters always forget (or never understand in the first place) that it's never as clear to the judge as it is in your head. When people get ""judgefucked"" 3 times out of 4 it's just because the judge didn't evaluate a certain argument the way they wanted and they never told the judge how to evaluate the argument in the first place. The only time a true judgefucking happens is when a judge evaluates the round in a way that is inconsistent with how they claimed that they would evaluate the round. In that instance, there is nothing that a debater could have done, because they were unaware of what was actually going on in the judge's mind."
Debate,2ssjuy,cookimonster,10,Sun Jan 18 05:31:26 2015 UTC,This! There are only two instances where I really get annoyed with judges...   Judge intervention When an RFD doesn't match what happened in the round (or if no RFD was given altogether).
Debate,2ssjuy,akacesfan,9,Sun Jan 18 06:26:55 2015 UTC,"i agree. the best way to show it is with two examples. The first is not judge fucking but my opponent thought he got judge fucked and the second was a legit judge fuck  Example one: Round 5 at the Glenbrooks in VLD.  The debate came down to a convoluted theory debate/meta theory debate on how to weight spikes out of the AC vs the theory he read against my aff. The judge ends up voting on my meta theory analysis. My opponent thought he got judge fucked because he thought he explained why metatheory doesn't exist/should preclude other theoretical offense. The argument was clearer to him than the judge.  Example 2: Round 4 at Iowa Caucus.  I read a ton of perms and turns to the K my opponent read. The judge in her RFD said she doesn't buy any of the arguments i layer on the K because ""You don't have authors to support your claims so it feels sketchy voting on them"". It wasn't arguments like the K was empirically false. I read args that called out the K for actually hurting the fight against oppression and a bunch of philosophical warrants. The judge just legit did not understand that in LD people can read analytics and it is still a legit argument."
Debate,2ssjuy,shits_mcgee,3,Sun Jan 18 07:07:17 2015 UTC,"Well...in fairness: It CAN be a legit argument, if you make it one. Consider that your analysis in that round may have been blippy and inconsistent. I've chucked arguments for just being downright unpersuasive. It's hard to vote for an argument that just doesn't have enough juice, even if you can see where the argument is going.  I don't know what the round looked like. I've never been to the Iowa Caucus tournament, and I don't know you from Adam. BUT, I think there are plenty of times when debaters think they've clearly won a set of arguments that they just didn't do the work they needed to do. It puts me in a position to intervene against your opponent if I have to do your work for you. Now, maybe you got totally hosed. But maybe you didn't do what you needed to do to pick up that ballot.  You don't have to win the arguments. You just have to win the judge. You can win every argument in a round and still lose the ballot. I know, I've done it."

Debate,2ssjuy,United14,2,Mon Jan 19 02:19:30 2015 UTC,"Sophmore year I was at congress elims for states and I thought I had absolutely killed it. I was completely expecting to get my qual for states so I was surprised when my name wasn't called at the trophy ceremony. When I looked at my results sheet, I saw that my only first round judge gave me first place in my chamber and by two second round judges ranked me second and last in my chamber respectively. There were no ballots at that tourney so I sill don't know why the judge ranked me last.  Note: All rankings I mentioned are out of the 10 people in the chamber, if that one judge ranked me sixth or higher, would have qualified for states."

Debate,2ssjuy,hufflepuffblood,2,Sun Jan 18 06:34:42 2015 UTC,"Slightly late, but I need to rant about this. My partner and I are doing PF for the first time and had 2 amazing rounds prior to this one. We finally understood how to attack and defend and pull cards however, we walk into a round and thats when it started. The round was good...for us. Our opponents agreed with our first contention, attacked ""our"" second contention and never even touched our third. We brought up the fact that our opponents attacked the wrong contention and then during our final speech my partner gave his final voter ""But Judge, if this debate comes down to one deciding factor and we are tied on the three other voters I just gave you, please look at your flow, our opponents did not attack any of our contentions. They attacked contentions and had formidable arguments, but they never attacked our contentions, and for those 4 reason I must urge a vote in the negation of today's debate.""  We lost that round. Not because my partner said that but because (paraphrasing here) 'I got sorta confused so  instead of looking at the example cases and related arguments, we have to look at morality and conflict resolution.' ... ""Morality"""

Debate,2ssjuy,Kadenz1,4,Wed Jan 21 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"I am the king of judge fucks. They happen to me often. Here a couple of my most memorable judge fucks.   JUDGE FUCK #1- JAN. 2014, Sahel topic PF @ Emory- Bid round. We had just won our bubble round against a team from the SAME school that we were going against. In our bid round, our opponents were running the SAME case as the team in the round before, same arguments, everything was identical. My partner and I were like PERFECT! So they ran a card saying that the reason military intervention fails is because it needs to be increased. We ran a turn that said the reason why it fails is because ANYTIME you increase military aid you get an increase in terrorism by 125%. So if you vote for them, increasing military aid, you vote for a world where you continually increase terrorism by 125%. It was a 2-1 for our opponents, the two judges who voted for them said that they bought that the reason why military aid fails is because we need to increase. We asked them what they thought about our turn and they simply ignored it and just didnt care because apparently you have to increase military aid.   JUDGE FUCK #2- November Topic (GM Foods) 2014, PF @ Nova Titan- So I was aff, this was my bubble round. I ran vaccines, cold resistant crops, increase in biodiversity and the green revolution. Literally 3 billion people had their lives saved due to GM crops... It already happened, its an impact I gained access to through GM foods. Throughout the round there was no clear response to it so we carried it across the flow. At the end of the round our judge goes ""let me see your cards about vaccines"" I go ""ok"". He looks at them and goes ""if you read the small print, these haven't happened, they're experiments"" and I go ""I know, I didn't read it as if it happened, I read them as studies which found these vaccines produce x effect"" and he goes ""well still you read it as if it happened"" and I go ""even if, thats why I read to you my 2nd observation which tells you that all I have to prove is that GM FOODS HAVE QUALITIES THAT ALLOW FOR BENEFITS TO OCCUR. They don't respond to it, we extended it and we show you that gm foods allow for edible vaccines."" and he still refuses to listen to me and goes ""well still I read the small print and its not what you're saying"" and then I say ""ok but what about the 3 billion lives that were saved by gm crops and the fact that our opponents agreed that lives were the most important issue in the round"" and he goes ""yeah but I read the small print from vaccines and it said they were experiments"" at that point I was done."
Debate,2ssjuy,Christiangruz,3,Thu Jan 29 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"While I can understand the motivation for this post, it makes no sense when you think about what debate is.  Your only goal in this activity is to persuade the judge. Not a hypothetical ideal judge, but the one in front of you. If you don't do this, you failed.   This is true even when judges vote in ways you disagree with. We know this because rules (or common practice) use minimum qualifications for the judging pool (high school degree if you're judging high schoolers, BA if you're judging college), and therefore anybody above that standard is accepted. If there were stronger norms, or even formal standards, for deciding rounds, then there would be mechanisms to measure and ensure higher reliability. This is true of social science research, or other evaluative endeavors like the grading of AP/SAT tests."
Debate,2ssjuy,Anaphoric,6,Tue Jan 20 03:59:31 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more with this. The dude in the back of the room may be a hee-hawin', mouth-breathin', slack-jawed stoned-out tweaker moron that tab pulled off a bus stop bench to judge the round, but HE's the guy with the ballot.  That's not his problem, it's YOUR problem. You better figure out a way to make Cleetus the Tweaker understand why it's important to value the things you value. You better persuade him that a vote for you is the right vote. I don't care how smart you think you are, that ballot is the important thing in the round, not your ego.   Granted, if this scenario happened to one of my debaters, I'd FLIP MY STACK all over whoever handed that ballot out. But, ultimately, my debaters should be able to pick up that ballot. And, sometimes, there's some bad stuff that happens (vendettas, personal biases, etc.), but that sort of stuff can be generally handled by the community (cheater judges shouldn't be invited back). Ultimately, the onus is on the debater, however, to make herself fully understood by WHOEVER is in the back of the room."

How exactly are you supposed to persuade the judge when the judge won't even allow you to speak? Argue with them after the vote?  There's only so much a debater can do. The most eloquent debater won't always get through to a judge who made up their mind after hearing the resolution."

The main countries right now are India, Russia, and Iran. These countries contribute most of the troops. Countries like the US and Britain, along with most other 1st world countries, give pretty much no troops. Denmark does, and one of the UN generals was quoted as saying they had to strategically deploy the first world troops for maximum effectiveness - the others kinda suck. If countries are reticent now, what would compel them to give up more for a more casualty-prone conflict situation? Requiring them is pretty much a plan, which you can't do."

For example, you could say that giving every peacekeeper blanket authority to have the option to act offensively will bypass problems involving political gridlock with the security council.  You could also advocate specifically for ""robust"" peacekeeping; I'll let you research the benefits of that on your own.  It's good that you're diversifying.

In certain parts of that state, that would never ever fly. However, the region I'm from, and the national tournaments I attended, it was totally fine most of the time, aside from prelim rounds at state or national qualifiers. During out rounds stuff like that was able to fly a bit more. If it is absolutely crucial to your case (as a coach and as a judge I can tell you that it probably isn't, and looking into synonyms for certain words to shorten it down, etc., may be a good idea,) keep it, if not, shorten it down a bit.   A great tip, if there's part of a contention that you're trying to make or a piece of evidence that you need to get out in the first speech, save it for your partner to give in a rebuttal or something. Use it as an attack rather than to build your case. A good offense is a good defense, etc."

Debate,2rpc7h,ANALFISSURES123,5,Thu Jan 8 03:13:45 2015 UTC,I don't think this could for this specific resolution haha. It's hard to connect the US and peacekeepers
Debate,2rpc7h,driswalker,3,Thu Jan 8 03:34:10 2015 UTC,What I was thinking is that I could just run that the UN is corrupt and doesn't do anything right so the US should do all actions offensive and defensive.

Debate,2rpc7h,yachterotter,2,Thu Jan 8 11:53:34 2015 UTC,First of all: Yes that is a counterplan  Second of all: Are you realllllly going to call the UN out for corruption and suggest the US as a better alternative.   Like just think about that for a second. CIA torture report? Our colonial legacies on basically every continent on earth? And you're gonna say that UN peacekeepers are the corrupt ones here.   Come on. You can think more creatively than that.

Debate,2rh2oa,mehatch,1 point,Fri Jan 9 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. The only unique argument I've come across is about gaining situational intelligence and cyber attacks that could be used since they are considered offensive. I've written cards focusing on the phrasing of ""the power to"" since it implies that it's only a tool to be used if the situation proves necessary. Even with this, the pro has to be very defensive this month. Anyone got other ideas?"
Debate,2rh2oa,3iry,2,Fri Jan 9 03:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have come across those situation intelligence and cyber attack arguments, but they just seem sketchy. I do not think I personally would be comfortable using that as my main argument just because of the uniqueness. Obviously, offensive operations are just another tool in the toolbox, so I think it would work very well as a supporting argument to ""benefits of offensive operations.""  Interesting point."
Debate,2rh2oa,kookoo831,1 point,Fri Jan 9 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"Pro can refute any argument made by con about the improbability of implementation by saying that the word ""should"" in the resolution doesn't imply that implementation is feasible.  For example: starving children in Africa should have enough food to eat. However, they don't and it's not feasible to give them the food they should have. Peacekeepers should have the power to engage in offensive operations. But it might not be feasible. That way you don't really have to have anything other than reasoning for that one."

Debate,2r0m64,moonkitty555,9,Thu Jan 1 17:06:07 2015 UTC,I think this should be a great month. There's tons of topic literature on it and it's broad enough to run some cool stuff. Let's just get through January...
Debate,2r0m64,TheAgnostic,3,Thu Jan 1 17:32:49 2015 UTC,It seems hard for Con to win. Maybe you could argue more poverty by less money made. For example there are less people making 1$ an hour but there are people who are making less money and thus are in a deeper amount of poverty. This could possibly be coupled with a framework that supports this argument.
Debate,2r0m64,Artunism,2,Sun Jan 11 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"Con isn't bad. You have lots of arguments here let me lay out some. For example, economic globalization often effects countries and communities more than direct households. Due to this, you can look at stuff like the Lorenz curve that lays out distribution of income and argue that though yes there is more. Money in the pool, a significant amount of it is going to that top % of the population, not the masses and therefore poverty isn't really helped (especially when looking at relative poverty of them to people in their society).   There are also arguments of (to be oversimplified), ""hey let's take all these local fishers jobs by introducing a Kroger"", thus increasing economic globalization but raping poverty. Theres a lot to look at here.   Also, remember the burden of proof lies with the pro. They have to prove it's helpful, con doesn't have to prove it's hurtful, just that it isn't necessarily helpful."
Debate,2r0m64,dirj15,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:12:40 2015 UTC,can u explain the lorenz curve
Debate,2r0m64,jzehnuny,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"Basically there is a line that lays out perfectly equal distribution of income that is basically the line y=x. There are curves below it for a particular country that look like the right side of a parabola. The further from the y=x line you are, the more income disparity there is in the country.   The axes are: Y - % income X - % population"
Debate,2r0m64,dirj15,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:48:21 2015 UTC,"You would probably have to define poverty as relative, which is a really tricky definition to defend if it gets challenged.  Otherwise, you're basically saying that the fact that relatively rich people in developed countries are getting poorer (but mainly still able to support themselves) completely negates all of the gains by poor people. This is pretty tricky to approach.  Are there any definitions of poverty that might hold up better?"

Debate,2r0m64,dirj15,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"but that's just it, because places that were poor before now have housing, Internet, good roads, and everyone's income has much higher purchasing power than before (allowing further economic development, including grocery stores and hospitals).  You have to show that things are relatively the same or worse as before to win as con, which means you have to say that other developing areas, or developed countries, are seeing exactly the same (or higher) decline in standard of living as people in these growing areas see in improvements."

Debate,2r0m64,dirj15,6,Thu Jan 15 07:46:11 2015 UTC,"What's the con angle going to be like? It seems to be a seriously difficult topic, because in many places it's an objective truth, esp. in India and China, that globalization has brought employment and a higher standard of living to many people."
Debate,2r0m64,Brawldud,3,Thu Jan 1 22:45:18 2015 UTC,"I guess maybe you can make the case that globalization has exacerbated/entrenched economic inequality and thus hurts the long term cause of ending worldwide poverty. I don't know how well that will hold up against empirical evidence that the standard of living in historically impoverished countries has risen, but it is all that I can think of.   I don't like this topic."
Debate,2r0m64,Brawldud,1 point,Fri Jan 2 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"You can always define poverty as absolute poverty (i.e. Only monetary) but that's a pretty weak argument. One good angle to look at though is the disparity between economic growth and economic development. These days,  economic development has been turned into human development, meaning an increase in the standard of living. But economic growth does not always help this. Often impoverished areas can grow economically while not having the means for development (e.g. You now have 7 million dollars, but no access to clean water or health care. Whoopdie, that 7 Mil means nkthing"

Debate,2r0m64,miretchin,2,Wed Jan 7 00:49:37 2015 UTC,"""there are lots of impacts to poor people that aren't about whether they get more money or not""  ?  For example, globalization can lead to climate change, which hurts the poor.  Or globalization stabilizes regimes, which helps the poor etc etc.  Almost any impact you can think of for globalization can be spun in a way to impact poverty reduction.  If anything this just provides a weighing mechanism for rounds.  I think it's a great topic."
Debate,2r0m64,miretchin,3,Thu Jan 1 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"Well the problem is that poverty reduction deals more strictly with ""do they have more money/more employment"" vs the welfare of the poor in general."
Debate,2r0m64,Brawldud,2,Fri Jan 2 19:37:12 2015 UTC,I think it comes down to more creative definitions for poverty.  Like instead of defining strictly on income--perhaps quality of life is another important indicator?
Debate,2r0m64,miretchin,2,Fri Jan 2 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"That raises another important question: is poverty relative?  Regarding climate change, does globalization cause climate change? In addition, does it disproportionately affect the poor? How?  Also: does globalization bring stability? It is important to bear in mind how global dependency on natural resources (i.e. fossil fuels and earth metals) can lead to conflict. For example, ISIS thrives by exporting oil, which the rest of the world frequently imports from the Middle East, and in Africa, painful steps must be taken just to ensure that satiating developed nations' thirst for metals and diamonds doesn't fund internal conflict.   I think you are right that in the long term, globalization will bring about far more stability, but there are always contemporary events to point to that suggest otherwise."

I have gotten numerous definitions so far, but how far can I go without the opponent stating that it is abusive?  Also, I do not believe that poverty is strictly related to: ""do they have more money/more employment."" Poverty can be related to their welfare of life and their background and other aspects of their life.  Also, could you please tell me some short and long term effects of globalization?"

I've recently been working on making a Python script to automatically collect articles and frankly, it's going terribly. So, seeing this is practically a godsend :P  Anyways, first of all, thank you for spending your time making something for somebody else.  Secondly, here are some of my ideas:   I think the idea of being able to filter out certain websites or only allow certain websites is very important, as in debate quoting RandomTeenagerblog.com isn't very acceptable. I do suggest having an adjustable delay between hitting different pages/bandwidth throttling so as to not spam sites.  Having an open or closed beta would be great (and I would be totally game for helping). The ability to scrape every article from a certain website (IE scrapping all the articles on BBC's world news section). The ability for the program to sort the articles by what topic they are on, or what news source they're from, or the month or date they are from (when written, not harvested from the sites). Something like that would be really helpful.  The ability to filter articles with certain keywords may also be helpful with sorting out irrelevant stuff. Having the ability to ensure there aren't duplicate articles would be good too, as certain sites (such as BBC) will sometimes repost older articles on their front page if relevant again (so a month old article that was already harvested won't be harvested again).    If there is any way I can help feel free to ask :) I have a little programming experience, but I don't think I would be much help with that. I can definitely help test for bugs and how it does with a very large workload as my internet connection is halfway decent and I have a lot of HDD space (if you do want to test it with a large workload, IE 100s of websites and tons of data).   This is such a cool idea and sorely needed by small teams (cause I understand what it's like going into an extemp round and having no evidence since your team doesn't collect much, since it's a small team)."

Debate,2q8ixd,Maxreed69,3,Wed Dec 24 03:38:58 2014 UTC,"I think the best application for peacekeeper is a person who participates in peacekeeping, whatever that includes. Peacebuilders and peaceenforcers are separate in my mind and your opponents would argue that. However, because of the clear parallels that can be drawn from peace enforcement and offensive peacekeeping, one could argue that the effects of peace enforcement are applicable to the idea of offensive peacekeeping given the lack of literature and time since first taken (March 2013). Many judges would beleive that to be reasonable"
Debate,2q8ixd,moonkitty555,3,Wed Dec 24 04:12:13 2014 UTC,"Who else would define that but the UN? Since the UN is the actor, I defer to its own definition of what peacekeeping is which lays grounds for peacekeepers' jobs.   I am linking you (and everyone else)  this pdf I found. This defines the standards of being a peacekeeper within the UN and also seems to discuss PKO's: http://www.peacekeepingbestpractices.unlb.org/Pbps/library/Handbook%20on%20UN%20PKOs.pdf  This seems to be a document of best peacekeeper practices. You did point out something rather interesting. What/who is a peacekeeper?  This two websites should give a picture through what the UN defines as such.   Here's this job description on their own website showing what they rely upon: http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/about/work.shtml  More interesting is this through their volunteer website that definitely describes what they look for in peacekeepers: http://www.unv.org/en/how-to-volunteer/register-to-be-a-un-volunteer/un-peacekeeping-operations.html"

So you could potentially find the most limiting definition of peacekeeping that you can and read that. I would honestly look around the internet and find a definition of peacekeeper completely irrelevant to the UN, like the hunger games peacekeepers and say they aren't dressed in white and carrying guns. I would probably win every round. Although I have no idea how puff works (or what the resolution is) so I imagine that it needs to be somewhat reasonable. (end joke)     In all honesty, don't even limit the word peacekeepers. Limit the actions that they can do, like building houses is just making another target we probably have to bomb.  EDIT: I just read the topic. Please disregard the above. Anyways, peacekeepers by definition (google) have to help both sides maintain peace.

And no, its technically not abusive because the pro can propose a more reasonable definition of peacekeepers and say that in the context of the debate this is the only way we can have a reasonable conversation. Then you say yours is the most real world. And then the judge burns the flow and votes on something else.    It is worth mentioning that for the last few months I've been running pure topicality in my policy rounds. I'm literally a cancer apparently."
Debate,2q8ixd,xwjitftu,2,Fri Dec 26 18:43:55 2014 UTC,"The issue is that in pf, if the definition you provide makes it impossible for one side to win, it's an abusive definition. A better way to approach this in a manner similar to what you proposed would be to argue that offensive force would make it more difficult for peacekeepers to achieve their goals, not that someone who uses offensive force cannot be a peacekeeper."
Debate,2q8ixd,Hoganbeardy,0,Fri Dec 26 19:01:08 2014 UTC,"See, the thing is its not an abusive argument at all. Its the other side that was abusive, because the definition that they made their pro case with was inherently wrong. This destroys con ground and stuff. Besides, they have to spend SO LONG to prove that the definition is abusive. if they spend any less than a minute on answering something that you spent maybe 15 seconds on then you just straight win. They have to prove that your definition 1) sucks 2) is abusive 3) they have to impact out the abuse 4) they also have to read some form of defense on their definition. This includes reading an alt and proving that it is 5) Halfway decent 6) good for education. If they fail to answer these things you just win.     Also topicality is something you can never ever lose on, and it takes so little time to read and it surprises the hell out of the other team when you go for it. Also, there is absolutely no reason that you cannot read both arguments, it should take like two minutes in total, leaving another three for whatever you read in public forum."

He makes great analytical arguments as to why the US should exercise restraint and retrenchment rather than further flexing its military capabilities and building up its global presence. You can use these as criticisms of military hegemony more generally.

Debate,2pbj3p,jswiftydowell,3,Mon Dec 15 02:38:17 2014 UTC,"I have the opposite problem, I feel Con/Neg is much harder to argue. It seems to me that the United Nations has a bad reputation for being ineffective and powerless to stop conflicts, especially that of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.   Not to say that violence is the sole answer to solve these complex conflicts--diplomacy is still a big part of it--but being able to use force would help turn the tide away from genocide and other atrocities. I feel like that argument, (that ultimately, the offensive ops are going to protect innocent civilians and foster peace), if backed up with proper evidence, can win Pro/Aff easily."
Debate,2pbj3p,ThatGuyOnTheRoof,7,Mon Dec 15 22:12:58 2014 UTC,"Why do you say that Aff is harder? Personally I think it's skewed towards Aff... Specifically because it seems like Neg would have to prove that offense operations will never be necessary or helpful in any situation, whereas the Aff can claim that the ""power"" to engage is good, simply because it's good to have as a fallback that could be used for future unknown situations, not that it necessarily will be used."
Debate,2pbj3p,TheAgnostic,2,Mon Dec 15 02:53:34 2014 UTC,"This is a cool response. That could even be framework, something along the lines that since the resolution denotes ""power to,"" the neg must prove not that actual action would be bad, but that just simply the power to do such is bad."
Debate,2pbj3p,AmazingZebra,6,Mon Dec 15 07:06:57 2014 UTC,"I think you can argue that it is:  a) Abusive, EVEN if you vote neg, the possibility to use it in one minute scenario calls for an afff ballot?  b) My con harms still exist by voting aff, you would have to outweigh my harms somehow  c) Probability? I outweigh on probability alone because my harms will happen, your benefits MIGHT happen."
Debate,2pbj3p,Christiangruz,2,Tue Dec 16 02:37:10 2014 UTC,"That framework was used a lot and pretty successfully in last year's Sept/Oct topic on nuclear proliferation (most teams called it ""a tool in the toolbox"").  I think a good way to respond to that given this specific resolution is that when you give them the ""power to"" do something, it won't exclusively be done in the best case scenario, so then you can look for outweighing with probability etc."

I would say that, moving forward, what may be most beneficial for you will depend on what you're looking to get out of the activity itself.  I think of debate like this: a mutually exclusive goal attainment game (in order to win, your opponent must lose and vice versa) played within certain set boundaries. These boundaries, in the loosest sense, are:   the speaking times,  the participants' burden to argue different things, and the judge's obligation to decide a winner.    In one sense, anything under the sun is ""permissible"" if you stay within these constraints. Most debate functions on the level of content: You, as the judge, should prefer voting for my side because X is true. This would suggest that one good way to prepare for debate is to know more stuff.  Debate also functions on a meta level: ""How, within these boundaries, should debate take place?"" Competitors benefit from a familiarity with this species of argument as well. For example, debate is good because the participants learn things by virtue of their participation, my side was the source of more education (and here's Y evidence for this), so you should vote for me.  The common element to both levels is the ""vote for me."" Without it, there is no debate, only discussion.   I'm reading a very compelling book right now titled Finite and Infinite Games by James P. Carse, and he has an incisive quotation relevant to this subject: ""Finite players play within boundaries; infinite players play with boundaries."" I would encourage you to do both, but attempt more of the second than the first. It's more fun that way."
Debate,2p0xge,Thornwell,1 point,Fri Dec 12 00:33:51 2014 UTC,"What event are you doing? LD is generally going to be heavier on the philosophical side, PF is the stereotypical idea you have of debate before you start, and CX (policy) is something else entirely. There are also a slew of speaking events.  I made this reading packet for my team a long time ago. I made a larger folder with more things as well.   The way to get over your fear of speaking, something I can relate to, is practice. After a few tournaments it won't even bother you anymore."
Debate,2p0xge,walrusbeans,1 point,Fri Dec 12 02:24:50 2014 UTC,Just know that participating in debate will make it 2.3 times easier to slay the fuck out of pussy.
Debate,2p0xge,Thornwell,2,Sat Dec 20 04:06:45 2014 UTC,"This isn't constructive. You're just being an asshat. We don't even know OP's gender. OP ignore this comment. Unfortunately, we still have assholes in this sport. To /u/walrusbeans, GTFO of the debate space."
Debate,2p0xge,walrusbeans,1 point,Tue Dec 23 05:31:51 2014 UTC,Nice recognition of sarcasm. And doesn't concern over OP's gender make you homophobic because both males and females can slay pussy. Asshat.
Debate,2p0xge,db8coach,3,Tue Dec 23 05:46:11 2014 UTC,"Nice try? But I ultimately think the use of the word slay in regards to pussy is problematic. It commodifies women regardless of gender using the slang. So if OP identifies as a female, then it commodifies her. If OP is any other gender, it still perpetuates harmful mindsets. As a dude, even I find it offensive since I don't want to live in an asshat world.   Furthermore, it doesn't make me homophobic to be concerned about OP's vagina possibly being slain. There is no connotation of sexuality about it, but even if you do add sexuality to my initial comment, look above and see the response to that.   Moreover, you obviously suck at reddit since sarcasm should be followed by /s. But whatever, you're just a high school shit-twit, so I suppose we can just take offensive things and try to pass them off as sarcasm completely ignoring larger societal impacts. You know, for a debater, you should know more about impacts and terminalization of actions, but since you like to commodify women, I'm going to assume you're a shitty debater who hasn't read up on any good arguments yet. Enjoy your shit-twit privilege!"
Debate,2p0xge,walrusbeans,1 point,Tue Dec 23 06:03:32 2014 UTC,"Alright my dude; here's how this is gonna go down. First of all, I'm gonna apologize to OP  for being such a massive ""asshat"". Second, I'm gonna assume you've never slain pussy, because it is not necessarily so negative. You're a debater, so let's look at the other arguments. One could say that slaying pussy, or, according to Urban Dictionary, the art of absolutely pummeling a girls vagina with your cock sword, is an expression of both parties' healthy sexuality. Moreover, it is a term that implies extreme sexual prowess on the male end; nothing to be ashamed about, and satisfaction on the female end. Third, I'm actually better at Reddit than your are, just observe my 1.1k comment karma compared to your shit amount. Not that there is anything overtly impressive about karma. Fourth, I'll address how you pointed out that ""slaying pussy"" was in part offensive because we do not know OP's gender. Therefore, you express a subtle layer of homophobia in that you implied vaginal relations are strictly for men. Of course, you might say that the definition I provided furthers your belief that pussy slaying is strictly for men; ""cocksword."" Yet, I pride myself in looking past gender barriers in that both sexes can satisfy their partners sexual desires. Fifth, since you're so good at debate, I'll see you in Dallas. Until then, I hope you have a good season."
Debate,2p0xge,db8coach,2,Tue Dec 23 06:29:50 2014 UTC,"I made a reddit account just because I feel that this needs to be responded to. As a debate coach (and a coach of an all-female team), I do not think this is how you want to represent yourself or your program. ""Slaying"" a woman's genitalia is fundamentally violent slang. Saying that debate is a good way to access vaginas further demotes women to their genitalia alone, and promotes rape culture in the sense that we are only concerned with how to get into a woman's pants. You show a basic disregard and lack of respect for women. You could have said that debate is a great skill to have to impress people, or debate is a great activity to meet girls in. While still probably slightly sexist, those are examples of how your language could reflect reflect some marginal amount of respect for women in general. Instead, you choose to say that debate makes it easier to ""slay the fuck out of pussy."" As a female, I can attest to the fact that this exactly the type of language that makes us feel unsafe in a predominantly male debate space. To represent the debate space in this way, especially to a brand new debater, is unacceptable. Your use of ""pummeling"" and especially ""cock sword"" further attests to the unacceptably chauvinist undertones of your language. You will not be seeing Thornwell in Dallas, because he is a college debater and obviously knows a lot more about what is both mature, inclusive, and appropriate than you. Please think about how your words affect other people, and how they make you look as a person and as a debater. Debaters, above all people, should understand how their rhetoric matters and you are doing a really poor job of that."
Debate,2p0xge,Thornwell,1 point,Tue Dec 23 06:40:29 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for your advice. I will take it into consideration the next time I promote debate. And for the record, nowhere did I say debate should be used directly to get into a lady's pants. In fact, debate is a terrible way to form a romantic and/or sexual relationship. It was more of a satirical added bonus, as we all know debate is not at the top of the ""cool list."" Once again, I'd like to apologize for my seemingly chauvinistic undertones and sexist language. As a matter of fact, I have great respect for females, and some might consider me a feminist in real life. Of course, from what you know of me, it is impossible for you to believe such a statement. However, I just want you to know that we should not judge each other based off of this thread, as I know I have made mistakes in my writing. Much love fam."
Debate,2p0xge,walrusbeans,1 point,Tue Dec 23 07:03:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks for being receptive. I'm sure you're a great kid, it's literally just my job to point out problematic rhetoric where I see it, and I only commented here because you were speaking to a new debater who may not have understood the sarcasm, as I didn't. I know that when I was a high school debater, I felt too intimidated to tell males when their language (even their sarcastic language) was making me uncomfortable, so I try to be that voice now. Sexism, ableism, and racism are always things that creep into even the best debaters' language, especially when we are surrounded by a society that is not nearly as progressive as most people in the debate space."
Debate,2p0xge,smilesbot,0,Tue Dec 23 07:12:00 2014 UTC,"Good job for apologizing. I don't get where you're getting this homophobia argument. I'm worried for any slain vagina. ""Absolutely pummeling"" a vagina seems a tad bit dangerous regardless of what gender is doing it. I won't even begin to get into your use of binary gender norms.   You also try to say that you break gender barriers and aren't homophobic, but your description of ""slaying pussy"" makes it impossible for anyone without a cock sword to do so. Thus, it is impossible for you to make this gender barrier arguments since your definition inherently links into them. Unless you were talking about this but cock fighting is illegal in the States, so you probably weren't. Moreover, fighting a rooster wielding a sword with a vagina seems pretty dangerous too, so you lose again.   I won't argue Karma with you since we both think it means nothing, but Link Karma probably means more than Comment Karma.   You won't see me in Dallas next June cause you're a shitty debater. You conceded that you're an asshat. That will never win a ballot. Good luck getting that bid though. Take it from someone who coaches, conceding arguments never wins."

Know how your studies were conducted. Know who conducted your studies. This is called methodology, and it is important to know in case your evidence is challenged.   Go over your cases. Make sure they are timed out, make sure you can pronounce everything (sounds silly, I know), and be sure you know what it is talking about.

Debate,2p12j5,Zeus1325,6,Fri Dec 12 00:37:04 2014 UTC,"Debate at its finest.   You could run a basic education/fairness k. In essence:  1) Education is achieved if we focus on the round, and the topic itself. If one team has their voice, and we don't, this will skew the round into the realm of judging based off of speaking. This is bad because it takes away from the round.  ~ back that  up with some schools of thought in epistemology that hold debate to yield highest results, or even something like intellectualism (logic + knowledge = good)  2) The other team has a basic advantage by being able to speak. The other team should speak the same way, as to not affect the overall results of the round.   Fairness is crap theory most of the time, but meh.  Or, you could go:  1) Egoism would hold that we need to do what is best for ourselves. If my opponents whisper too, they are helping their fellow debaters, and will feel good about themselves. If the judge allows it, and doesn't hurt us in speaks, he is allowing this happiness to occur, meaning that he gets more power in the round, making him feel good about himself. Util based, we benefit the most people in this room by whispering.  2) egalitarianism= equality.  OR  1) Judge, vote for the best debater. We lost our voices debating, demonstrating that we are extremely committed to debate. My opponent, however, has a pristine voice, like butter. It's beautiful. This means that he hasn't been speaking a much. Vote for me because I lost my voice winning, and can still win on argumentation.  I don't cut cards, except for the card I cut to back up the argument that I don't have to have cards. So you gotta do that part.  Hope this helped"

The philosophy behind that K is basically that too much equality is going to ruin life.

This criticism is as true if applied to a single interaction or the kind of systemic policy Vonnegut's dystopia illustrates.  This argument, while likely coherent with some philosophical systems of thought, intuitively feels punitive. As a judge I would likely not accept it, and would certainly never coach a team to attempt it.  Reddit is not a debate round. There is no judge, and no flow from which to drop an argument.

Debate,2okg6f,shits_mcgee,7,Mon Dec 15 01:32:03 2014 UTC,"I went to my first tournament of the year, GMU.  Went 4-1 prelims (won aff 3 times, con 1 time and lost aff one time), and won triple and double octas, marking the first time I've ever made it to outrounds.  All fine until the bracket put my partner and I against another team from my school.  My partner, our coaches and I all thought the other team should walk over me (this team is very well-known and very good.  They're urrently ranked near the top of the best 10-20 pf teams)  They asked my partner and I if we were sure we wanted to let them walk over, and we insisted they do so.  They 'won' our octas round, taking them to quarterfinals and securing them a bid.  (These guys did VERY well at TOC last year and didn't need a bid anyways, but I accepted a 'ghost bid' because I wanted them to win and I was so amazed I'd come close to a bid, I was glad to concede to the superior team)  They lost, meaning my partner and I could have lost too but at least gotten a real bid.  If my partner and I absolutely insisted we walk over to quarters, the team that 'beat' us might have reluctantly accepted, the PF coach there would have said no, the head coach would have said no, the coaches we called would have said no, and our former PF coach who was helping us out a little would have said no.  I still have Blake, Lexington, Harvard, and Sunvitational, so even if I only get one real bid, my partner and I can apply for an at large TOC entry.  Seeing how I went 6-1 and got something of my first bid ever at my most first serious tournament since my JV efforts in last year's local cfl final tournament (going 3-3 at harvard camp session 2 doesn't count!), I'm very proud of myself this weekend, even if i was screwed out of a real bid.  Next week, the local circuit won't know what hit them."

Debate,2oi4uu,NeutralWhale,4,Sat Dec 6 23:53:29 2014 UTC,"In your rebuttal to read new evidence that answers your opponent's case independent of your own. If you are only only making cross applications from your own case, then all your opponents have to do is answer your case, and they gain access to all of their offense. Before the tournament, make a list of all of the arguments that you expect to see. Brainstorm, talk to your coaches and teammates, and do research to see what the most common arguments are in the topic literature. Find 3-4 good pieces of that refute the argument and put all of the evidence that you prepare for refutation into one easily accessible block file that you can access during the round. Your block file should have several good responses to the half dozen arguments that you expect to see the most.   Don't reexplain your case in rebuttal. The judge got it the first time, and if they didn't then you need to make your cases clearer. You have the summery and the final focus to extend and explain your case. The judge will get bored hearing the same argument again so soon, and it does nothing for you. Instead, use this time to make more offensive responses to their case.   Unless your opponents made an extremely important concession in CX, don't spend any time talking about it. Your final focus should on 2-3 key issues in the round. For each voting issue, explain why you are winning the argument and why it matters. The latter is usually done by weighing the impact against your opponents. An easy way to think about weighing is to see it as probability times magnitude. For example, say you are affirming and make an argument about how affirming prevents terrorism, and the negative makes about how affirming will hurt the economy. You could say (based on the arguments made in the round, which you should specifically mention) that there is a very high probability that affirming will prevent an act of terrorism, while there is a very low probability that affirming will hurt the economy. You could then say that the magnitude of the impact of terrorism, which will lead to a loss of life, is worse than the magnitude of an economic impact because it's worse to kill someone than take their money.   I hope this all helps! Let me know if you have any more questions."
Debate,2oi4uu,cookimonster,1 point,Sun Dec 7 04:41:11 2014 UTC,Hey. Little late sorry about that. Anyway I argue moral and ethics which I understand is bad in public forum. Do you think there's a way I can keep arguing this way and still consistently win rounds? Also what contentions are you expecting for this upcoming topic (for profit prisons).
Debate,2oi4uu,eslondon,3,Sun Dec 7 20:29:44 2014 UTC,"All of this comes from a first speaker with a very good partner  Rebuttal tips: Never waste time in a rebuttal.  If you can rebut your opponent's case with your own that's great, but you'll also want to bring up new evidence.  If you have nothing to say and the clock's still ticking, go over what you just said or go over your own case.  If you are the second team to speak, you can even defend your own case by going over what your opponent said in his/her rebuttal.  What you have to remember is to have clear goals, and divide up your opponents case in a way the judge can better understand you. 2nd CX: Like any cx, try to start with a goal in mind.  ask about the methodology, credentials, or causality of anything read in your opponent's rebuttal.  If you or your opponent mentioned framework, ask them about that/ or get your opponent to concede to something.  Grand CX: If your partner can easily take over for you in this speech that might help you as a novice, but to grow as a debater, you can't rely on your partner.  Find a working system for you two to equally split off grand cx.  Final focus: Don't bring up any new evidence, and avoid any new arguments.  Act like the round has ended, and tell the judge why you have won it based on what has already happened.  Morality and ethics aren't alway preferable in PF, but especially with the December topic, a good framework can help you with those issues. ex: 'Because human lives and rights are more important than money, any con evidence of cost savings should be seen as secondary in this round' Especially for a novice, framework isn't always required, and less experienced opponents and judges might not understand it very well. Try to weigh in on the importance of the specific issues.  Even if another side can prove something that benefits them, tell the judge they'll still vote for you because you win on a more important, bigger part of that issue.    If your opponents ever cite something specific to one place or area point it out as ""non-holistic"" because for example, privatization increasing costs of one or two prisons in Florida doesn't look to a nationwide resolution, and can't be seen as reflective of private prisons as a whole.  If your opponents ever say something along the lines of 'when x did this, y did this', ask about causality.  I might be able to show you that private prisons have lower costs, but I might not be able to show you why the private nature of these prisons is the cause of low costs, because in fact, low costs come might just come from from the lower security risk and reduced medical needs of the younger drug offenders found more often in private prisons.

I would say what might help is to make sure you're being honest. As in, knowing in yourself you're truly reaching for truth in your argument, rather than trying to spin or win a 'zinger'. But what if you've been assigned to defend a position you're not in agreement with outside of the context of the debate? This is actually where it matters the most. By taking on the role of the opposing position, you can form good, true arguments without being disengenuous because everyone there knows the context. And since you agree with the other side, you'll represent your opponents fairly...that'll make it harder, but make you a better debater. By being a paragon of honest argumentation, that shines through even stronger taking the opposite view. And better yet...  after it's all over and you're back in real life, you'll argue more honestly againt that position because you won't be tempted to misrepresent it, or straw man it.

The issue is, rounds will be nothing like the real world! I still to this day never understand why people assume that debate rounds will replicate real life arguments and argumentation in any type of debate, because that's completely illogical. Debates will always be different because of having to use multiple arguments, weigh, use legitimate evidence, and many other factors. This topic is going to be really bad because although it seems good on face like I said, because of a lack of written and published literature, the topic will inevitably devolve into obscure plans and counter plans and weird turns and a bizarre framework debate over multiple words in the definition that will take up time in every speech and probably won't resolve anything.

Fact: As it pertains to international relations, security is generally more accessible to the average individual than trade regulation, obscure territorial disputes, or climate change.  Fact: This is actually really important, as determining the scope of UN peacekeeping operations is quite important in the pursuit of maintaining sustainable peace in conflict ridden nations. I think we'd both agree that governments should be more concerned about the status of conflicts which erode foundations of human security than a somewhat trivial debate about GMOs (prisons are pretty important, though).  Fact: My username essentially proves that I'm biased."

Debate,2nzrvt,Clausewitz1996,2,Tue Dec 2 04:05:07 2014 UTC,"Yes, but we have other case studies which can be used to determine the effectiveness of armed intervention. To use an oft-quoted example from last January's topic, Operation Serval in Mali. Or NATO's peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, which first involved an extensive air campaign. Or Operations Deliberate Force and Joint Endeavor.  The counter argument to this is that the aforementioned examples involved well armed, highly trained, and combat experienced soldiers from Western nations. Conversely, UN missions are generally paid for by Western nations yet are executed by soldiers from developing nations.  Yet we can see the success of African militaries (who would make up a large percentage of these UN forces) in previous interventions. Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist organizations which controlled large swathes of territory in Somalia were pushed out by a U.S. supported AU mission.   Yes, but that example involves a U.S. backed force. Who says that America, which is already cracking under the strain of multiple security commitments, would support a UN force with the necessary ISR assets?   So on, so forth. As you can see, there is definitely room for both sides to make good arguments. Moreover, there have been studies on the effectiveness of the UN offensive in the DRC. Honestly, this topic has the potential to interweave economics, security sector reform, gender, and political reform together should the participants craft nuanced cases.

Debate,2nwq46,xwjitftu,8,Mon Dec 1 04:08:54 2014 UTC,"The burden of proof on ""impossible"" is extremely high, and therefore I'd  recommend not using this line of argumentation. The fact that prisons have been public in the past (and in much of the world are public today) is highly suggestive of the idea that it's possible. If your case is predicated on this argument, and you lose it, I vote you down immediately.   A quick survey of wikipedia mentions that for-profit prisons (as a whole, rather than sub-contracts for specific services like prisoner healthcare or transport) have only been around in the US since sometime during the 80's. This corresponds to increasing incarceration rates as a result of the war on drugs. An eminently convincing argument against your suggested case would be that the pendulum is swinging back, and states are once again raising the thresholds required for prison sentences as pertains to drug use. For example, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Washington D.C.'s legalization of recreational marijuana. If demand for prisons goes down, why not shut down the for-profit prisons we contracted with, ostensibly, to accommodate additional demand as that demand wanes?  Your ""Where would you put all those prisoners?"" question also lacks defense on the possible proposition stance that we don't need to do this all at once. We can build new publicly operated prisons prior to transferring prisoners.   The only place I see this idea gaining traction is that it may be impossible for the United States to attain the required level of political will to enact any possible re-nationalization scenarios, but that argument is contingent upon the idea that we will never, ever, ever have this collective willpower. This, once again, presents you with an extremely high burden of proof, and one rooted in many subjective interpretations of political dynamics. Although I see a few possible ways to get there, including a permanent high level of income inequality as a result of Thomas Picketty's r > g idea, once again, I do not recommend attempting to get there."

I think it can easily turn into a definition war, which is awful in my opinion. I have never had a judge say: ""Oh! I loved how much you got into your definitions! Keep doing that!"" It won't run well.   Also, when you are arguing this political support argument, you are saying that something needs to be supported to be right. Look to the Dred Scott case in 1857 when ""the United States Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, declared that all blacks -- slaves as well as free -- were not and could never become citizens of the United States."" (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2933.html) While this was a popular political argument in the region, it doesn't mean that slavery is-or ever was- okay. Just because something is popular doesn't mean it is ever right.  This form of argument makes it nearly impossible to get to merits of the debate if running this type of argument in PF.

Debate,2nwq46,elephantower,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:33:14 2014 UTC,"This isn't the first time I've heard this type of argument and honestly I'm saddened to see that it's very prevalent in pf debate. I full heatedly believe that all debaters should be taught (or at least seek, if one doesn't have the sufficient means) the mechanics of modern debate. The plague that runs through PFD is that of ignorance, and I'm not talking about poor judging, because in the end, that is something that's absolutely uncontrollable, but rather I am talking bad debating because of the lack of knowledge regarding proper debate.   In debate, there is a term called ""Fiat,"" more prevalently heard in Policy and LD, but it means ""Let it be."" Fiat is when the debaters assume that the resolution is something that has already happened, regardless of hypothetical situations and it derives its justification from the concurrent usage of ""Resolved"" and ""Should,"" within the resolution. Because of the resolution's word choice and tense, as debaters we are to assume that whatever the resolutions entails, it is implementable or has already been implemented. The reason why we do this, is to promote actual discourse within the round and so that arguments presented come off the benefits/ detriments of the resolution. At the point we digress away from the stock of the resolution, we also digress from the intent of the framer and we end up with poor argumentation and absolutely no clash. Long story short: Fiat is the debate version ""For the sake of argument.""  In regards to the resolution at hand, debating the validity or the possibly of for profit prisons, we divulge into the aforementioned harms, resulting in very poor debates."

Debate,2ntd4v,gmoore016,8,Sun Nov 30 03:43:10 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I wouldn't go for humor in round. No matter how you approach it, there's always a chance it will rub the judge the wrong way. If you are being told that you're ""dull and monotone,"" look for other ways to make yourself more interesting. Add some power to your voice, work on inflection, etc."
Debate,2ntd4v,Six-76,4,Sun Nov 30 06:27:31 2014 UTC,"Some thoughts:  Ask any comedian: humor is hard. Every audience is different, and sometimes, despite best efforts, it just doesn't connect. While a good joke can sharpen a round, a bad one will deflate it. You, apparently, are not doing good jokes. Don't take it personally, except to the extent that it changes your speaking style.   I've never heard of any surefire techniques to being funny; it's more of a soft, unconscious kind of thing. It's certainly something you can work on, but it will take time. So the question is what you do now.  For starters, I'd suggest working on reigning in the jokes. Try to limit yourself to one or two per round, if that. Consciously experiment and observe what those who you consider funny do. Consign yourself to the fact that maybe in-round jokes aren't for you.  I should note at this point that there is a fine line between making light and derision. Both can sound like jokes, but the latter can just be mean and off putting, especially when you're talking about serious topics. This is another reason to try and avoid comedy in debate except when you absolutely feel in your bones that it's appropriate. Personally, the best kind of debate humor is dry. It doesn't point so much as gesture at flaws or silly conclusions in your opponents' arguments. But the line there is never clear.  So, if humor is out for now, then that means you need to work on the other side of your equation: not being ""dull and monotone."" That's much easier to solve. Energetic speaking is easily faked/adopted. Stand up straight, project from the diaphragm, make (non-creepy) eye contact, speak at a steady speed, gesture/move (or at least don't appear locked up), and SMILE (or otherwise make facial expressions). Like most soft stuff, film yourself speaking and/or get someone you trust to watch you speak."
Debate,2ntd4v,jimibabay,3,Sun Nov 30 06:38:40 2014 UTC,"Don't make fun of the other debaters. Make fun of the politics. Example:  Other team runs argument regarding how the UN is good for the US to back.  Start the argument against US backing of the UN with a hilarious example of budget overuse, such as that time they pent like 4mil on new light bulbs that weren't even eco-friendly. ""Glad to know our cash is going towards these hugely successful light bulb operations, UN"".   I've always loved it when people use a recurring joke as a theme to guide arguments. With the above example, you could use the light bulbs thing.  I have three arguments. First, the UN seems to misuse its funds (light bulb as primary empirical example). Second, the UN's actions seem to go contrary to their supposed beliefs. Use substantial evidence this time, but hint at light bulbs (not eco friendly, yet worthy of our 4mil).  Finally, the United Nations, while wonderful at choosing the right light bulb decor for all of their ironically environmentally unfriendly needs, fails miserably at obtaining peace.   Basically, don't get sarcastic at them, but poke fun at politics. Protip: abortion jokes don't do well.   Hope that helps!"

Debate,2ntd4v,joejackdebate,4,Sun Nov 30 05:56:43 2014 UTC,"Final focus seems to be the big defining factor there. Humor isn't meant for final focus. Final focus needs to be concise, riddled with enough word economy to get every argument in."

Debate,2ntd4v,hawkeyes459,3,Sat Dec 6 16:11:27 2014 UTC,"Debate humor is all about timing, and that means waiting for good oppertunities. You won't get a chance to crack a joke every round, and that's fine. Judges are really, completely okay with debaters who don't try to be funny, and as you recent experience shows, it's worse to make bad jokes than no jokes. Especially if those bad jokes are at the expense of your opponents. A little kindness goes a long way, and coming across as friendly and personable will gain you more favor with the judge than any joke. If you're worried about sounding monotone, practice varying your inflection to emphasize important points or get an emotional reaction from the judge."

Debate,2nsbf6,Jfqian,3,Sat Nov 29 21:21:45 2014 UTC,"""For-profit prisons in the United States should be banned.""   It limits it to the United States. What do you mean by the legal system specifically?"
Debate,2nsbf6,Christiangruz,2,Sun Nov 30 01:56:29 2014 UTC,"just because it limits it doesn't necessarily mean he can't argue other nations/ use them as an example.

However, I think many debaters can easily respond to using other nations as examples however, I think those who actually can explain why the U.S differs will have an advantage."
Debate,2nsbf6,jswiftydowell,2,Sun Nov 30 02:06:30 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't run that as a framework, it's already within the resolution and should be assumed.

Debate,2nsbf6,BocefusD,1 point,Sun Nov 30 22:31:35 2014 UTC,"What he is asking isn't wether or not he can limit this to the US, i think.

Debate,2nsbf6,mt_xing,1 point,Sun Nov 30 03:20:24 2014 UTC,"Personally, I think it is abusive because you kind of have to look to other countries to prove anything and everything.

Debate,2ns377,mt_xing,1 point,Thu Dec 4 14:02:32 2014 UTC,"In your local circuit that may be the case. On the national circuit, and for simply judge appeal, logic and strong warranting of arguments is something that most winning and successful teams use. A lot of teams end up throwing numbers and cards at the judge, but the issue is if the judge isn't flowing like a lay judge they won't follow at all. Plus, integrating the reasoning of why the statistics are true and cutting back on throwing out study names is going to make you sound more convincing for the judge, and it will also help you shoot down opposing arguments simply by asking why does this happen, and force your opponents to give you an explanation before they go to impacts. Warrants and reasons really are the most important part of PF on every level, especially high quality and high level rounds. I suggest trying to explain your arguments and asking you R opponents to do the same on the local circuit. It'll help you win a lot of rounds and convince a lot of judges."

Debate,2njksl,llamalord,2,Fri Nov 28 15:54:32 2014 UTC,"Which tournament was this OP?  So like 5 years ago when I was in my last year of college level debate I got conned into judging the Jack Howe (CSULB) for $100. Horrible I know. Rounds were going on into 1am. My last ld round was double flighted, one half of the first flght had been taken home by his angry mother before postings had gone up. The second flight the aff asked if he could lose the round and asked myself and the neg to read over his aff to see if it was any good. They don't feed you either.   To be fair to CSULB they have gotten so much better about their tournaments and they are lovely to go to now.   However. CSUF needs to check themselves. They run two of the worst tournaments and every year I see a ton of issues. This year they kept a judge who was sexually harassing female debaters on to judge well into the out rounds of debate. I know this guy, and he creeps me out to no end and he has a solid reputation of only voting for girls when they are against guys. No male debater has ever picked up against him while against a girl. But back to CSUF. In years past I have heard stories of schools getting their students threatened by other students, and nothing being done about it. Rounds run hours behind. And then they don't feed judges. They have a $100 judge bond they hold over the heads of every school and keep it when judges don't show for rounds yet they have the nerve to force their judges off campus for food. Adorable."

I don't own a laptop and I don't think I should have to buy one because the people at Bronx Science want to make things negligibly simpler.  The obsession they had with making that tournament paperless was just obnoxious. They refused to even print out paper pairings. How many sheets of paper would that have taken? 3? 4? It was childish.  Another thing that pissed me off about that tournament was how poorly they treated judges. My dad's been judging various formats of debate for 13 years now and they had the nerve to repeatedly call him a ""novice judge"" just because he asked for paper ballots.   Also, some of the rooms left open for debate were downright insulting. They were closets, more or less. And they were often connected to other rooms where other people would be debating, so you'd have six or nine people clustered together, with doors that didn't exactly block out noise very well.   It's rare that I don't enjoy a debate tournament but Bronx Science came pretty damn close. Some of the people (not all, there were plenty of helpful Bronx Science students and a couple of courteous alums) running that tournament were condescending pricks who really ought to learn some basic manners.  Edit: Also $130 ($50 school fee, $80 registration fee) for one LD debater is absurd. There are so many tournaments out there that are way better and cost less than half as much."

First, what is functionally the negative block is dominated by one partner. Without back end rebuttals (whips from the member speakers), this one debater gets to interpret the whole round. Second, the PM only gets 3 minutes to argue against 10 minutes of LO. I don't know community norms, but it seems to me a smart LO would spend 5-6 minutes responding to the MC and then spend of her or his time making new arguments. There is no way a 3 minute PMR could adequately address the new arguments. If the LO isn't allowed new arguments, then it seems the gov would always win because they get 14 minutes to generate arguments while the opp only gets 7."

Point of Order system has the potential to be extremely chaotic. Only 15 minutes to prepare your speeches for the debate. From the debates I've seen CP doesn't tend to make reference to researched and verified evidence or have in depth debates of value systems; debaters just sort of try to appeal to very simplistic interpretations of value systems and use anecdotal evidence and assumed shared knowledge to support their arguments.  Nice way to introduce parliamentary form to debaters, but honestly I think it's a bottom of the barrel form of debating - down there with Congressional. Sort of like a marriage between extemp and a pseudo-debate.

There will be more former debaters and coaches judging, and most of the judges will know what they are doing. A much larger percent of the judges are flow judges at national tournaments, so thats a good or bad thing depending on how you debate.   Competition wise, there will obviously be more competition. Breaking at Princeton will probably be a challenge if it is your first national tournament, just because there are a lot of really good teams from all around the country going.

Debate,2ncaca,ocbdandchinos,4,Tue Nov 25 04:51:47 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, here is the run down of the top 5 camps I would recommend    1. Champion Briefs Institute: a fantastic camp with a staff of some of the best debaters in the country. I have hit many teams that were good but are now great as a result of going to CBI. They also recently added locations in California and Indiana, in addition to the original Florida location. 2. Institute for Speech and Debate: ISD attracts a lot of attention because it's a good camp. The staff consists of some of the best coaches from well recognizable schools and former debaters with very good credentials. A very good camp that should be considered if you want instruction by coaches more than previous debaters. 3. South West Speech and Debate Institute: Many of the top debaters have attended SWSDI. I put this one at the top of my list for two reasons: it's low cost, nearly half of others for a two week camp, and focus on both PF and extemp. Many would dislike having one week of PF and one of extemp, but I firmly believe, as a debater coming from a camp that offered the same thing, this is the best strategy for a debater in particular a second speaker. 4: Capitol Debate Institutes: Capitol is great and more flow oriented. If a person wishes to perform well on the national circuit, I would suggest this camp. The camp has great staff and is available in more locations than any other camp. 5. Mean Green Workshops at UNT: This is a camp not many people would recommend but I believe it is noteworthy because of its great ability to teach the basics. Many debaters get caught up in card-debate but lose argumentation, and this camp teaches argumentation better than any other camp. Although it is relatively unknown, that's a good thing as class size is low and one on one time is great. The camp also has great flow debate, as the camp is well known for policy and LD. Above all, the director is a wonderful guy and experience is very pleasurable.   These are the camps I would recommend. Always keep in mind cost, dates available, location and staff while picking a camp. Any of these 5 would work out great!"

You discard the idea that we can view drug use of the past: use by past generations, use by our peers, use in day to day life. Saying that the lack of hindsight mitigates the moral worth of drug use is incorrect. Just as with any action, legal or illegal, we can (sometimes reliably) predict the consequences of an act. It is based on this (in the consequentialist view) that we make moral judgements in the present. Why is it only a issue of health? Why is criminality and health mutually exclusive? In the case of many crimes, they are issues of both criminality (violation of legal code) and health (often mental health)   It was a quick read , those three ideas came to mind first."
Debate,2na1uh,iKnife,1 point,Mon Nov 24 20:39:42 2014 UTC,"1) The morality argument was gateway to the round, dependent on the moral nature of the resolution itself, not the agent. 'Ought' is where we derive the sense that the question is moral. 2) I am not sure where you got that I was saying that second part there. The argument on the aff was never that drug use is moral. The only argument that pertains to hindsight is that we ""can only understand absolute morality by viewing it after the effects can be and are observed"". Applied to the resolution, we're still talking about the comparison between what seems to be two competing views on drug ABUSE. To the latter part of your second argument: The affirmative argues that, because we have not yet changed the way we view drug use, on a national scale, be it federally or (somehow) socially, we cannot view the effects of the ideological comparison/ prioritization here. Therefore, linking back to the V/C framework, we need to look for an objective way to view arguments while lacking the ability to ascertain a full perspective.  3) That is an excellent setup for a kritik of the resolution, False Dichotomy, I believe. However, it would be, in my mind, assumed that the resolution is talking about a general prioritization of views, rather than a radical false dichotomy of two things that may share some ground. Additionally, I'd argue that, if that argument were true, and the resolution was inherently flawed, the aff is burdened by defending it. It'd be like making someone affirm a resolution that a grasshopper jumping on Putin's nose causes nuclear war. Can't make aff defend a logical fallacy. Because of this, with the goal of fairness and education in mind, we give the resolution my aforementioned benefit of the doubt.  Thanks for the response, and great points!

'Hammering' the argument because I didn't appear to substantiate the claim would (hopefully) result in a theory spike sort of argument. I'd immediately address it by bringing up that I made the argument that aff should not have to defend a resolution that's a logical fallacy, or inherently flawed, and how this takes away from fairness and education. Once you had dropped this argument because you were 'hammering' my assumption, I would bring up how the affirmative 'assumption' results in both a more fair and more educational round.

Your case relies on misdirection and deployment of philosophical terms which you use to take the entire issue into a nebulous, abstract, and ultimately vacuous place. From the neg, I would argue that is viewed as a matter of public health, and is additionally rightly viewed as a matter of criminal justice. Prioritization happens in a way that cannot be generalized as aff attempts to do, and is not the core focus of the resolution, as aff mistakenly supposes.   By analogy, I would suggest that all deviant acts, from theft to battery, ought to be viewed with a mind to prioritize mental health before criminal justice, and ask if that doesn't sync with whatever garbled criteria aff has set forth, and what meaning such a ""resolution"" would ultimately have.  See below about word salad. Virtually every reply indicates that you are being intellectually dishonest in this case, and each time you dodge the issue.    EDIT: A lay judge will be totally lost in your sea of pseudo-philosophy, and a judge like me (B.A. Philosophy) will consider it transparently hollow. How do you really see this playing out, champ? Neg team concedes?"

Debate,2mxrrb,akacesfan,2,Thu Nov 27 08:32:36 2014 UTC,"I think that could be an awesome argument, but I would ask how they measure human dignity.  For example, you can say X amount of people are in private prisons and Y amount of people dislike it, but polls are almost never accurate because only the super opinionated will respond. You don't get a neutral baseline.   So, while human dignity is huge, at the same time I don't know how it would measure up impact-wise in Public Forum debate.

Debate,2mxrrb,aspentreeee,2,Tue Dec 2 04:07:49 2014 UTC,"You're absolutely right in that it's impossible to measure human dignity in numbers. However, dignity is based off of more than just whether people like private prisons or not. Things such as mistreatment in private prisons and health issues are known to diminish a person's dignity.  Near the beginning of the case, I think it would be important to mention that diminishing a person's dignity has several consequences that include, but are not limited to, psychological effects, social inadequacy, and dehumanization. There's a real impact to the loss of human dignity on a person's quality of life. Therefore, you need to look towards human dignity first because a person's quality of life hinges on it.  This is how I'd frame it if I was in PF anyways. It's a strong way to establish that human dignity is important and that it comes first because it gives life worth."

You come into a round telling me racism increases and I'll ask you for the harm, and the answer to that can not be that racism is bad(that's circular logic: increasing this is bad because it's bad). You'll need to empirically show why those things are harms. Now on this topic you have some wiggle room, the topic is asking us if we should ban these prisons. If you run human rights abuse it's very easy to say we should ban things that cause human rights abuse because inherently it's a harm (might want to find a quote but it probably won't be necessary, I don't see novices fighting that). All in all be careful about weighing because arguments without numbers are easier to outweigh (example: ""Judge my opponents are saying that there is an increase in racism, but this is impossible to quantify, I can not see an increase in 3 or 4 racisms. They also do not show tangible harms of this so you're going to be outweigh this on the very tangible economic savings to the tax payers"")"

Even in policy where we have to justify the fear of death, or extinction being bad we generally think racism is an impact.  I am one of the biggest supporters of Icalc in debate, especially because a lack of it makes the debate a pain in the ass and super vacuous besides.  That said racism is an impact, and even if it's not the cards talking about how black people experience social death in the sqo probably makes any impact calculus you do super racist.  (well almost any impact calculus, but it's tricky to get right, especially first try which is something that probably matters at the point you will run an arg probably 6 times.) Even if your Icalc args aren't fucked, racism probably outweighs anyways. Also private prisons probably don't solve any death impacts regardless.  The internal link level is a separate issue.  This is mad fucked up.  Making the arg you shouldn't make args about race because people don't evaluate it in the right way/puff is structured shittily is probably not a reason that a good case can't change this."
Debate,2mxrrb,MrFunEGUY,7,Fri Nov 21 18:44:08 2014 UTC,"PF doesn't have a shitty structure, you just seem to be unable to understand it. In PF, you can't say any idea or concept is an impact. To your first post, yes you have to justify the reason racism is bad by explaining the harm (impacts) that come from racism.   ""cards talking about how black people experience social death in the sqo"" - Saying this is a harm. You gave an impact. You just did what a PF'er would have to do. I can't walk into a round in PF and say that Racism is bad because it's racism and racism is bad because it's just bad. Even though it's common sense, in PF, the judge cannot judge based off of anything not said in the round. They can't insinuate the real world problems that racism causes, because the team has to explain to them the problems that racism causes. It's not ""mad fucked up."" It's sensible. If you could just state that any idea or concept was an impact then you would have so many ridiculous arguments in PF."
Debate,2mxrrb,SuperSharpShot2247,2,Sat Nov 22 04:12:03 2014 UTC,Yeah we're saying the same thing.
Debate,2mxrrb,dwightschrute1,2,Fri Nov 21 15:16:25 2014 UTC,"Answered below but basically what I'm saying is racism isn't an impact Its a link to an impact. The best example is bullying. If you show an increase in bullying you can't stop there. While yes, bullying is bad, it's not an impact. Increase levels of suicide and depression would be your impacts. So with racism I feel like it's only run effectively if you can show an increase in human rights abuse or murders due to an increase in racism. Even a disproportionate level of incarcerations directly linked to for-profit prisons would be fine."
Debate,2mxrrb,mt_xing,-1,Fri Nov 21 12:36:25 2014 UTC,Yoo this comment is actually pretty messed up.
Debate,2mxt65,Agent78787,3,Fri Nov 21 01:37:06 2014 UTC,"Congress often has a very good speaking style, although many can say it is soft. However, on evidence, congress has very poor researching and evidence is scrutinized on a far lower level."
Debate,2mxt65,Clusterfist,2,Fri Nov 21 01:58:37 2014 UTC,"Would you say that that research is on a broad, and not deep, level compared to other events?  For example, other events discuss the same topic for multiple meets while we have 15 bills in a season (plus 6 district bills) and discuss up to 6 of those bills per meet."
Debate,2mxt65,Clusterfist,2,Fri Nov 21 02:11:05 2014 UTC,"Yes, I would agree that the level of research in congress is just as broad or broader than other events. However, I do believe the depth of research is what matters more"
Debate,2mxt65,Dovesongz,2,Fri Nov 21 02:16:41 2014 UTC,"I did both Congress and PF. I wouldn't say the topics aren't researched deeply in Congress because they're usually current events, and at least in my diocese, it's really cards based. It isn't that it's less research, it's just less time.  In PF you have more time to research (a month as opposed to a week) and develop arguments (every tournament per month has the same topic, as opposed to Congress being more per tournament based.)  It depends on what you prefer. If you can speak very persuasively and coherently and like clash, and thinking on your feet, do Congress. If you like order and a slower, more focused debate, pick PF."

Debate,2mw66b,MrFunEGUY,2,Thu Nov 20 21:05:51 2014 UTC,"What you're proposing to debate is a plan, and in PF, plans are illegal. You can't force the opponent to present a plan and you shouldn't present plans either."

Debate,2mw66b,jameshues,4,Sat Nov 22 04:01:24 2014 UTC,"Yo, a trick that I liked to use in PF a lot was to just debate the round operating under that assumption. If you explicitly state in framework, ""An aff ballot means you immediately shut down all private prisons,"" then 90% of the time you'll get called out on it, but if you just try to skate by painting your opponents as people trying to shut down private prisons, most of the time you can get away with it."
Debate,2mw66b,Vault713,2,Sun Nov 23 02:51:58 2014 UTC,"What would the other way to debate the round be? Like, if the round wasn't debated under that assumption, what would it be debated under? Also, what would the other team call them out on? Is there a specific rule or something that that assumption is breaking? (Sorry for all the questions, I'm new)"
Debate,2mw66b,Dont_Quote_Me_On_It,2,Thu Nov 20 17:45:54 2014 UTC,"The standard interpretation would be that the negative argues in favor of for-profit prisons in a general sense.   Under a policy-based framework (aff has to defend the effects of an immediate change in the status quo, rather than just advocating for said change to happen), it would be very difficult for the affirmative to win. They would essentially be stuck defending the immediate closure of 7% of all prisons.   To address your last question, maybe. Public Forum is unique from other forms of debate in that the rules explicitly disallow plans and counterplans. Other than that, ""the rules"" are basically up to interpretation and argument like in other events."
Debate,2mvl36,trick_shop,3,Thu Nov 20 14:19:30 2014 UTC,"You could go back to John Locke's social contract -- say the Constitution is a binding contract on the states, and if they can leave it at whim, then it's not a contract.  Or, say that the people within the state aren't citizens of the state, but citizens of America, therefore trying to divide would be disingenuous."
Debate,2mvl36,pvejunky12,2,Thu Nov 20 14:28:13 2014 UTC,"Wow thanks, I wasn't even aware of the social contract and you second point is really good."
Debate,2mvl36,jimibabay,2,Thu Nov 20 15:37:15 2014 UTC,"I dunno if this will really by an issue in your debate, but be mindful that Locke's social contract does not entirely support your side. Locke himself recognized the right to revolution, especially where, as your opponents might argue, grave injustices have voided any contract. Further, as a matter of natural or other law, simply because a contract is voidable, rescissible, or unenforced doesn't mean that it's not a contract. Contracts are defined by the exchange of consideration, not by the fact of their enforcement."
Debate,2mvl36,jimibabay,2,Thu Nov 20 19:55:59 2014 UTC,"FYI, since you spelled it incorrectly twice, the correct word is secede not ""succeed.""   It seems fairly clear to me that it is untenable to say that secession is never justified. For example, the Colonies seceded from the British crown and many Americans would be hard-pressed to argue that was a bad thing. So if you have to argue that it is categorically wrong to secede, then you are kind of screwed. Please let us know if that's the case.  Otherwise, there are various sources at various levels of generality and sophistication, e.g. Wikipedia or the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. You might also consider cribbing language from, say, Lincoln where he discusses why the Union was fighting to unify the country. Seriously, do a Google search, provide credit to your sources, and incorporate the arguments that you find persuasive."

We generally use the values of [fairness/education]  Use use these debate theories in order to say that an argument that they are using is not fair. For instance if they are making the resolution to restrictive then they are taking away from fairness and education which shouldn't be allowed for the purpose of the most benefit of debate.   The other form of debate theory is the assumed burdens that the affirmative and negative hold. The affirmative has the burden of proof [ Meaning they need to provide a stance with qualified evidence. Where as the negative has the burden of Clash, meaning they have to create argument that conflict or negate the affirmatives stance.

Debate,2m5gdc,parth556,6,Thu Nov 13 04:30:35 2014 UTC,"Great to see you wanting to improve yourself, something some first year debaters lack. Well quick note i'm captain of PF debate and have been teaching incoming first years how to do what we debaters do, so i have a fairly good sense of what to advise. 1. Make sure to utilize the briefs to their full potential. There are some good pieces of evidence buried within the huge piles of words in there you just have to look beyond the practice cases and extensions to find it.   Its also highly beneficial to read the blocks for pro and con sides so you can get an idea of what you need to find evidence for offense and defense.  2. I suggest trading briefs to expand your evidence pool and no brief is exactly the same.  3. You can start off with just typing the resolution into Google and see what you get.  4. Once you fully understand the resolution and have been exposed to multiple arguments then it becomes easier to narrow down what you want to find. 5. For example, as you said you got crushed in the practice round for sucky evidence, now you know what you want to find and improve on. If you didn't have evidence for lets say how much of GMOs in the world come from Monsanto, just go onto a search engine and type in something like ""Monsanto's GMOs in the world market"". Youll find what you need if you just go like that. 6. Stay away from blogs because your opponent will bitch about it not being credible 7. If your going to google it preferable click on .org .edu, articles by phds or credible studies so that you wont get fucked over on credibility 8. If your doing the GMO topic then its preferably to get evidence that provides numbers. Simply quoting something that a professor says isnt good enough because sometimes they can be biased and numbers are usually weighed more then opinions 9. Stay away from evidence cards that say ""could' ""if"" ""possible"" ad so on because the status quo is what judges are usually concerned about  This is pretty much all i can say now because most of the skill for speaking, researching and etc kick in once you have some experience. I hope these tips helped and good luck out there!"

Debate,2m2zim,A_Freudian_Slip_,3,Wed Nov 12 16:12:24 2014 UTC,"Slow down. PF has speed, but not to the degree of CX  Loaded questions are fine. If you can trip up the team in the first crossfire then you can easily win the debate. A lot of PF is about momentum with the slowest speeds in the NFL save congress and speeches of only 4 or 2 minutes.  If you come off as a dick, you also have to win every argument. At that point one argument lost can swing the match to your opponent. Be polite but assertive at the same time.  Can't help much about your other questions though (graduated). Sorry."
Debate,2m2zim,CTR0,2,Wed Nov 12 17:11:15 2014 UTC,"One of the main factors for the aggressiveness is your judge. If you have what we call a mommy judge, you should pay more attention to your presentation and make sure you are not aggressive, but you still have control of the arguments. If you have a flow judge you can be more aggressive, but you still should avoid coming off as a dick. Other than that you should just slow down and make sure you are speaking to (and appealing to) whatever judge you have.   Edit: regarding the topic specifically I haven't really looked at it yet so I can't say much about it. Generally in PF people go for tangible impacts, so you'll be more likely to see arguments on this topic that are along the lines of economic costs of prison rather than philosophical arguments regarding the worth of a criminal's life. Still, this topic has more of a philosophical vibe to it than most PF topics, so I wouldn't be surprised if you hit an argument like that."
Debate,2m2zim,confetti27,2,Wed Nov 12 22:40:15 2014 UTC,"ok so first, as others have outlined PF is more persuasion based than policy, as the speed and style of your case is more important than in policy.  Argumentation still trumps persuasion (with most judges unless its a lay judge) so its still important to have a good case.  Regarding the December topic area: Resolved: For-profit prisons in the United States should be banned.  There are tons of good free PF resources, Bauschard, everyday debate come to mind.  the main arguments in favor of banning private prisons will likely be that private prisons violate prisoners rights, especially with minorities, and this will likely be weighed against the economic benefit of keeping for private prisons.."
Debate,2m2zim,islandersfan1,2,Thu Nov 13 02:36:54 2014 UTC,Basically don't give abstract impacts just stick closely to the resolution because linking everything to nuclear war will not sit well with a PF judge. Don't speak like your on Adderall be assertive and polite when it is appropriate. Don't ramble on or speak over your opponent too much. On a scale form sunshine to total asshole you want to be a persuasive bitch. Some judges have no idea what's going on so presentation is pretty important which is why spreading and rudeness is frowned on.

Debate,2lmvq4,brocktehrock,3,Sat Nov 8 01:18:09 2014 UTC,"It's not.  Privacy can be a value, and your criterion can be its maximization, but that:  a) doesn't belong in a contention, and b) is a hard point to sell.  Privacy is important, undoubtedly, but your claim offers no qualification. As the standard, you're saying that no other considerations should enter the calculus for the worth of any action. If an action is immoral (whatever that means), we probably don't want it private. We could maximize privacy by dissolving the FBI/CIA/NSA/Police, etc., but that wouldn't be particularly smart. There's a balance to be had between privacy and security.  Privacy and the internet is an enigmatic issue in part because security and privacy aren't in as stark of conflict as usual. It may be that an individual's right to be ""forgotten"" increases that person's security by diminishing the capacity of online stalkers.  Also consider a contention about self-fulfilling prophecies. If people can't escape their pasts (re: online sex offender registries) does it raise recidivism? The Internet is a powerful tool to democratize information (mostly?), but that may increase vigilantism (decrease security of a vulnerable community) and lock people with criminal pasts out of certain jobs, neighborhoods, etc,. There's some interesting literature coming out of Scandinavia that supports this point, including this article in The Atlantic:  http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/why-scandinavian-prisons-are-superior/279949/  EDIT: Plus, this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QGKl_AQ4HU"

Debate,2lmvq4,Anaphoric,5,Sat Nov 8 23:03:05 2014 UTC,"I don't want to second guess your coach, but I've always understood values/criterions as the following:  Value: what you want Criterion: how you get what you want or how you know you got what you want  If your coach is pushing you to this format, at least try it out, but your willingness to come on Reddit to search out other input tells me you value other perspectives as well.   If I were to judge you, however, and you made that claim, I would immediately be skeptical about your case. Any sort of oversimplification on that scale smacks to me of hubris. The world is a complex place, and privacy is cool, but I just don't judge the utility of x action based on its potential impact on my privacy.   Privacy itself isn't what I'd call a terminal impact, and on the scale of human history may be a relatively new invention. Jared Diamond's new book documents a number of hunter/gatherer societies that had little privacy. Their method of sheltering children from explicit sexual intimacy of parents was to tell children to close their eyes. What else could they do if they have young children and the whole family lives in a one-room hut? And you know, cultural norms what they were, this didn't pose a problem. How do I know? These societies still exist in remote places today.  Privacy affects quality of life. Take the privacy of a severely depressed person. If social isolation is a factor in their mental health status, their right to privacy might be something to consider when deciding appropriate remedies (I can guarantee you it is), but there's a higher goal, namely to ensure a high quality of life. Low privacy in our current society usually lowers our quality of life as in illegal searches and seizures, or a policy like NYC's stop and frisk, but privacy is still for something, serves some purpose. This is what I say when I mean privacy isn't a terminal impact.  If I were you I would re-frame my value/criterion like this:  Value: Respect for human dignity  A value defined as an action casts the issue as something we can do. Governments can act with respect, or not. Give some examples of what this means in different contexts. Always ground your philosophical arguments in concrete examples, like the best of poems. Also, it's not ""your"" value. It's the value you'd like the judge to adopt.   Criterion: Maintaining a proper balance between privacy and other concerns.  There's lots of evidence in today's world that the pendulum has swung away from a focus on privacy. This strategy allows you to concede that other issues are of great importance, but that we've overstepped appropriate boundaries enshrined both in common decency and constitutional principles (secret trials, government memos on when it can kill citizens without a trial, and data mining programs come to mind). Done well, a criterion will also serve as a standard by which you can measure whether or not you've upheld your value. So think about how privacy can uphold dignity. It may increase autonomy, or the perception of autonomy, and with it a sense of responsibility. Growth is more possible when community expectations of your behavior aren't stuck in a rut: the person portrayed in ""Star Wars Kid"" still suffers harassment as a result of the video, which has over 29,000,000 hits (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPPj6viIBmU). What are the possible concrete measures you can deliver on to uphold human dignity in his case, specifically?"

""I stand by my assertions that although you can know what happens to any individual species that you modify, you cannot be certain what will happen to the ecosystem.""  Except, here is the kicker, we can know what happens to an ecosystem. That's why thousands of tests and studies have been done and will continue to be done on this topic. Anything deemed too dangerous will not be used any the public and if complications do occur a product can be recalled. (well at least taken off shelves, and then have appropriate measures taken by the company who would be liable, this liability being the reason they must be certain when they release a product)  Next he tries to relate this to the issue of ""malnourished fat people""...  Malnourishment comes from a lack of proper nutrition, not necessarily caused by a lack of food. People can be fat from eating tons of fatty non nutritious foods. Anyone in any country can be malnourished no matter how much they eat its the QUALITY of what they eat, in this case Bill is right, but he ignores the fact that companies are trying to solve this problem by developing GMO crops which are greater in QUALITY. (See, Golden Rice). Bill creates a strawman here, representing the argument for GMOs as if they only increase yield and because of that it doesn't solve true issues in the world, ignoring the fact that companies are working to increase the quality of foods to help deal with malnourishment.  On another note you can't argue that having more food in a malnourished area will have no impact on malnourishment, certainly more food is better then less food, even if the more food doesn't give you 100% of your suggested intake of Vitamin C.    While i'm at it see these quotes from various experts and doctors reporting on real studies which support all claims I made and probably a couple more   [A'ndrea Elyse; Senior Science and Research Information officer at Pennsylvania State University; Genetically Engineered Foods Are Needed to Feed the World; 2012; Gale Group Databases]  “A 2010 report recently published by the European Union on GMO safety research over the past 10 years concluded that GMO crops are not different from crops modified by other techniques. ...in the face of overwhelming evidence of positive economic, agronomic and ecological impacts and the absence of detrimental impacts, people in many countries remain adamantly opposed to genetically modified organisms.""  [Ronald; Science Correspondent; The Top 5 Lies About Biotech Crops; Reason; 13 February 2013; http://reason.com/archives/2013/02/22/the-top-five-lies-about-biotech-crops/print; retrieved 3 October 2014]  The Institute for Responsible Technology’s list simply fearmongers on this one, claiming, “By mixing genes from totally unrelated species, genetic engineering unleashes a host of unpredictable side effects.” Not really. All types of plant breeding—conventional, mutagenic, and biotech—can, on rare occasions, produce crops with unintended consequences. The 2004 NAS report that I alluded to above includes a section comparing the unintended consequences of each approach; it concludes that biotech is “not inherently hazardous.” Conventional breeding transfers thousands of unknown genes with unknown functions along with desired genes, and mutation breeding induces thousands of random mutations via chemicals or radiation. In contrast, the NAS report notes, biotech is arguably “more precise than conventional breeding methods because only known and precisely characterized genes are transferred.”  Jon Entine, (Senior Fellow at the World Food Center's Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy at the University of California-Davis), FORBES, Oct. 14, 2013. Retrieved Oct. 10, 2014 from http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2013/10/14/2000-reasons-why-gmos-are-safe-to-eat-and-environmentally-sustainable/.  Every major international science body in the world has reviewed multiple independent studies—in some cases numbering in the hundreds—in coming to the consensus conclusion that GMO crops are as safe or safer than conventional or organic foods. But until now, the magnitude of the research on crop biotechnology has never been cataloged. In response to what they believed was an information gap, a team of Italian scientists summarized 1783 studies about the safety and environmental impacts of GMO foods—a staggering number. The researchers couldn’t find a single credible example demonstrating that GM foods pose any harm to humans or animals. “The scientific research conducted so far has not detected any significant hazards directly connected with the use of genetically engineered crops,” the scientists concluded.  [Dick; Founder of Sense About Science; Genetically Engineered Crops Do Not Threaten Organic Food Production; 2012; Gale Group Databases]  “Outside Europe, GM has been applied more rapidly and extensively than any other new technology in the history of farming. In 1996 GM crops covered some 1.7 million hectares worldwide. By 2009 the figure was 134 million hectares, much of it in the developing world. Various crops that will help reduce disease and hunger are nearing commercial cultivation, from golden rice that can prevent children going blind to crops that may help farmers in Africa cope with drought and avoid losses from pests and diseases.”  David Zilberman et al, 2014 (Zilberman, David, et al. ""Biotechnology And Food Security."" Journal Of International Affairs 67.2 (2014): 91-105. Academic Search Complete. Web. 13 Oct. 2014. David Zilberman, Scott Kaplan, Eunice Kim, Steven Sexton, and Geoffrey Barrows)  ¶ As argued earlier, food security is measured not only by the availability of food,¶ but also in the enhancement of nutritional value, which is especially appropriate in the context of developing countries, where limited access to crucial vitamins and minerals leads to poor diets. Studies have shown that only 25 percent of GE vari- eties in field trials target pest control or are third-generation traits that attempt to enhance the nutritional value of food.''' The potential of this research to improve human well-being is vast. For example, vitamin A deficiency is a major cause of blindness among children in Asia and Africa. Golden Rice is a GE variety of rice that has increased vitamin A content and has been available for commercialization since 2002, but regulatory pressure has prevented its introduction. Studies have estimated that earlier introduction of Golden Rice could have reduced vitamin A deficiency in children in Asia and Africa and prevented 600,000 to 1.2 million cases of blindness.    Now, to get more in-depth on the ecosystem question, we see that when used, GMO crops have multiple positive impacts on an ecosystem. Such as the decrease in Herbicide/pesticide use, Soil Erosion, and greenhouse gasses. I'm too lazy to write a case but here's some evidence to back all of these claims in another comment because too long"
Debate,2lfh5v,backcountryguy,2,Thu Nov 6 01:55:24 2014 UTC,"[Ronald; Science Correspondent; The Top 5 Lies About Biotech Crops; Reason; 13 February 2013; http://reason.com/archives/2013/02/22/the-top-five-lies-about-biotech-crops/print; retrieved 3 October 2014]  A 2007 study done for the self-described non-advocacy think tank National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, founded in 1984 by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, reported that planting biotech crops in the U.S. had reduced in 2005 herbicide use by 64 million pounds and insecticide applications by about 4 million pounds. Another 2007 study, by a team of international academic researchers led by Gijs Kleter from the Institute of Food Safety at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, concluded that in the U.S., crops genetically improved to resist herbicides used 25 to 30 percent less herbicides than conventional crops did.  Pamela Ronald, (Prof., Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis), SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, Aug. 11, 2011. Retrieved Oct. 10, 2014 from http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/08/11/genetically-engineered-crops/.  Planting of Bt crops has resulted in the application of fewer pounds of chemical insecticides and thereby has provided environmental and economic benefits that are key to sustainable agricultural production. In Arizona, where an integrated pest management program for Bt cotton continues to be effective, growers reduced insecticide use by 70% and saved $200 million from 1996 to 2008.  Charles Conner, (President, National Council of Farmers Cooperatives), HEARING TO REVIEW THE OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY, Hearing before the House Agriculture Committee, June 23, 2011, 11.  Biotechnology cotton has resulted in a decreased in pesticide usage by as much as 75 percent. As of 2010, 93 percent of U.S. cotton was genetically engineered, and cotton yields have increased approximately 33 percent as compared to the average cotton yields prior to the introduction of biotech cotton in 1996.  Charles Conner, (President, National Council of Farmers Cooperatives), HEARING TO REVIEW THE OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY, Hearing before the House Agriculture Committee, June 23, 2011, 9.  Biotechnology developments have reduced pesticide use, improved conservation practices and afforded a more sustainable way for farmers to provide us with food, feed and fiber. For example, adoption of biotechnology products has encouraged the expansion of no-till cultivation. The increased use of no-till reduces herbicide costs by 20 to 50 percent, erosion by 90 percent, greenhouse gas emissions by 88 percent, and fuel use by 20 to 50 percent, while enhancing habitat for beneficial insects and birdlife. These benefits, in turn, reduce farm production costs, improve soil and water quality and conservation, increase carbon retention in the soil, and reduce fuel use and emissions.  Drew Kershen, (Prof., Law, U. Oklahoma College of Law), KANSAS JOURNAL OF LAW & PUBLIC POLICY, Spr. 2007, 432.  By using environmentally-friendly herbicide and pest resistance, biotechnology makes agricultural runoff less harmful to receiving waters by producing a runoff with fewer chemicals. The runoff would be the same in amount - just cleaner. However, biotechnology indirectly controls runoff because farmers who adopt transgenic crops are also able to adopt conservation tillage. Farmers can adopt conservation tillage more easily and more readily with transgenic crops because transgenic crops provide the agronomic tools to control weeds and pests without tillage. In other words, transgenic crops allow farmers to adopt environmentally-friendly tillage practices.  When crops like Bt corn are grown, they naturally resist weeds and pests, not only reducing pesticide use, but also meaning the farmer doesn’t have to till as much land and they don’t have to work pulling up weeds as much. This is important because as we have shown these conservative tilling practices greatly reduce soil erosion, meaning farm land is more sustainable and the enviroment is protected.  Kenneth Lisaius, (Vice President, Biotechnology Industry Organization), HEARING TO REVIEW THE OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY, Hearing before the House Agriculture Committee, June 23, 2011, 35.  In 2009 alone, less fuel use and additional soil carbon storage from reduced tillage reduced greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equivalent to removing 17.7 billion kg of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or removing 7.8 million cars from the road for one year."
Debate,2lfh5v,backcountryguy,3,Thu Nov 6 02:02:23 2014 UTC,"The only card that is really relevant in this long list of cards is the Entine card. (the pesticide stuff is probably tangentially related) I'm not going to say Nye is correct, but the fact that out of 20 cards (or whatever...counting is a pain), only one speaks to the issue Nye talks about is indicative that discussion of GMO has been framed as whether or not they are directly harmful to humans.  Nye takes a position on the secondary debate, that is on the debate over whether GMO has the possibility of hurting the environment.  I will say what Nye says, that we cannot know what happens, is one hundred percent true.  By definition.  The debate is assessing how big this risk is, and whether the risk is acceptable.  I will say he's dead right on the second issue of nourishment.  GMO's being more nutritional isn't relevant.  What needs to happen is to make super nutritional foods super cheap.  GMO may be cheaper than organic food, but they're still more expensive than a microwave dinner. (or whatever)  There is a reason obesity has a correlation with class."
Debate,2lfh5v,Nemnel,1 point,Thu Nov 6 17:57:22 2014 UTC,"At the end of my first comment I make couple more arguments, it may be hard to see, but the second comment of cards was for the environmental benefits of GMOs. I was trying to frame my discussion to relate to the resolve, on balance the benefits of GMFs outweigh harms, showing all the good environmental impacts brought on by GMOs. I probably did throw in a bit too much, I was just lazy.  On the nourishment issue I would agree that having golden rice or other similar types of foods won't necessarily solve the issue but it would be  a step in the right direction. I also wanted to point out how he brings that up, he's trying to say GMO's shouldn't be bothered with because they won't solve the ""real"" problem as he sees it, but even if they don't that does nothing to disprove all of the good that would come from/ comes from having GM food. Hence the straw-man."
Debate,2lfh5v,ethidium-bromide,1 point,Thu Nov 6 23:29:14 2014 UTC,"Ahh.  Missed that.  Regardless I think that independent of good things for the environment it is a highly advisable idea to have cards that talk about the internal link chain that Nye implies. (which is a transgenic species does something funky and fucks everything to pieces.  A virus, perhaps, or an interspecies breeding thing that kills everything.  Also this is why the Entine card looks good because it says this shit happens a lot and nothing has happened)  I don't think you can weigh the good things GMO does to the environment against the bad things it might do to the environment (at least not well), because they are on such vastly different levels.  Also on the nourishment issue thanks for another cap link. :p"
Debate,2lfh5v,backcountryguy,-2,Fri Nov 7 00:52:40 2014 UTC,"Studies don't and can't prove that it won't harm the environment. The environment is what's called a 'Chaotic system,' which means a) that there are things you cannot predict about it and b) there is always more interconnection than you can measure. So, studies are nice but a) they cannot disprove what Bill Nye said, what he said is a mathematical truism and b) they will never, ever cover even the tip of things."
Debate,2lfh5v,Nemnel,6,Thu Nov 6 05:16:40 2014 UTC,"What he said isn't specific to GM crops.   It would also apply to any artificially selected crops.  There's nothing magical about transgenics that makes it any more or less predictable than environmental impacts of other crops.  It's also kind of beside the point that massive scale farming is, by definition, ecological destruction.  It doesn't matter if you plant 4 million acres of GM or non-GM corn, both are extremely artificial plants that would never exist on those scales naturally.   Being transgenic doesn't magically make it dangerous or more unpredictable.  The best way to reduce ecological destruction by farming is to ensure that however many acres you are farming are being farmed efficiently and yielding optimally.  If you have 4 million acres of GM crops that produce as much food as 4.5 million acres of non-GMO crops, then the GM variety is the lesser of two evils.  So yeah, what he said is true, but in no way specific to GMOs.  He just argued against farming.   Removing transgenics isn't going to magically make the ecological impacts of farming predictable."
Debate,2lfh5v,ethidium-bromide,1 point,Thu Nov 6 06:42:34 2014 UTC,"two things.   We farm way the fuck too much food now.  GM crops have little to no effect.  Uniqueness needed. This is much shakier, and tbh I am guessing there is no lit on this (and if there is more likely than not goes the other way), but I wonder if there is any ""natural mutations happen in one plant, GM crops are introduced like everywhere all at once"".  Possibly a ""shit changes too fast for adaption"" arg?  Just an errant thought"
Debate,2lfh5v,Nemnel,-5,Fri Nov 7 01:01:12 2014 UTC,"When making scientific claims, you need data to back up your assertions. Saying that 4.5 million acres is bigger than 4 million is true, but it doesn't mean there's the same level of harm that's being done by both crops. The ecological damage done by Corn is different from the ecological damage done by, say, tobacco. But without data to back it up, you can't just make that claim blindly. (Now, this gets even worse when you start discussing how monocultures, which GM crops all are, are vastly more ecologically harmful than the alternative.)  So, no, he didn't argue against farming. He was saying that we don't have the data on this to even begin to make an assessment of this, especially when these crops are being introduced in lots and lots of different ecological zones at the same time. What holds true in one ecological zone is totally different in another. While Bull Frogs are just mildly loud nusiances in most of the world, their introduction in Australia as an invasive species without a natural predator has been ecologically destructive beyond your wildest dreams.  So, look here, the claims you're making are just totally off kilter. You just claim that data exists, I haven't seen this data across the myriad of ecological zones that these crops are in. While, we have lots and lots of data across these zones for traditional crops (and lots of places don't just plant invasive crops). And, furthermore, even nonnative  crops are usually adapted to the environment at hand, GMOs are a vast monoculture controlled in such a way that the vast majority of them are never allowed to adapt to the environment they are in.  Finally, the kinds of mutations that are introduced are generally outside of the range of behaviors that we have actual data on. While Golden Rice just beefs up the vitamins and nutrients, most GMOs are more similar to BT corn than they are to Golden Rice, and they exhibit behaviors that could have unquestionably harmful impacts to the ecology if they are not well contained within their field they are in (they never are and it's basically impossible to do that).   So, the whole argument you're making is pretty bullshit. You don't have data on it. While I believe that some data exists, we don't have the data to back up these claims. We have it for more traditional crops. So, I just find your argument totally unconvincing.  Source: I'm a scientist."

(Now, this gets even worse when you start discussing how monocultures, which GM crops all are, are vastly more ecologically harmful than the alternative.)   One of the single largest indicator of environmental impacts due to farming is by land usage.  It's extremely obvious to see how converting 4.5 million acres of wild land into 4.5 million acres of stripped-down farmland results in greater ecological destruction than covnerting 4 million acres of wild land into 4 million acres of stripped-down farmland.  This is a ""mathematical truism"" as you'd like to put it:  4 is less than 4.5.   However, critics argue that organic agriculture may have lower yields and would therefore need more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss, and thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices   When considering environmental impacts on a per land usage basis, a measurement known as the ""environmental impact quotient"" is used.  GM crops have measurably lower environmental impact quotients than non-GM crops   The adoption of [GM] technology has reduced pesticide spraying by 474 million kg (-8.9%) and, as a result, decreased the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on these crops [as measured by the indicator the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ)] by 18.1%. The technology has also facilitated a significant reduction in the release of greenhouse gas emissions from this cropping area, which, in 2011, was equivalent to removing 10.22 million cars from the roads.   By reducing the environmental impacts on a per land usage basis, one can reduce the ecological destruction due to herbicides, insecticides, and possibly most importantly the long-term ecological effects we are seeing due to global warming.   GMOs are a vast monoculture controlled in such a way that the vast majority of them are never allowed to adapt to the environment they are in.   Almost all massive scale farming is a monoculture.  This is nothing specific to GMOs; you are arguing against conventional farming practices here.  Furthermore, GMOs are also bred into the most appropriate local variety using backcrossing.  Here's helpful diagram of the process created by /u/hexaploid -  In other words, a transgene can be bred into any variety you'd like with any local properties and adaptations.   Finally, the kinds of mutations that are introduced are generally outside of the range of behaviors that we have actual data on.   This is completely wrong as the mutations and genes that are introduces are among the most well studied genes and mutations in the world of molecular biology.  Far more is known about these transgenes and mutations than is known about any plant that undergoes random mutagenesis (massive numbers of mutations, genes swapping around the genome, etc), which is the go-to method for creating a new variety of plant without GM technology.  In fact, many mutations and newly-created genes from random mutagenesis are not even studied for health or ecological impact before introduction as a new wide-scale crop.  With GM plants, they are studied.   So, the whole argument you're making is pretty bullshit. You don't have data on it. While I believe that some data exists, we don't have the data to back up these claims. We have it for more traditional crops. So, I just find your argument totally unconvincing.   I'd say your entire argument lies upon FUD which is more of a marketing and quick debate tactic than any sort of rational argument.  Honestly if this were a real-life debate in real-time, that'd be a great strategy to go with as nobody can respond to those sorts of uncertainties in real-time.    Source: I'm a scientist   Same.  I work in this field.  After being so high-and-mighty about asking me to cite my sources, you should really do the same.

(That being said, I think you for commending me on my strategy, it's just this kinda thing that made me national champion back when I was a college debater.) :P  For instance, is the size of the farm an important factor in assessing its damage. Duh. That's like saying that gravity is an important factor in assessing how much you'll get hurt when you fall. But that doesn't mean that it is the most important factor in any given case, it just means that it's important. In fact, the study you linked to said that it's not always the most important factor, that other local factors are frequently more important.

Debate,2lfh5v,Nemnel,7,Thu Nov 6 15:53:29 2014 UTC,"Benbrook measured pesticide use by weight, classifying all of them with the same toxicity.   He 'spun' the numbers to achieve the greatest impact.  Herbicides like Lasso or Atrazine are falling by the wayside in exchange for those with less residuals and environmental impact, like Glyphosate and Glufosinate.   He also didn't highlight the ecological benefit of reduction of application of broad spectrum insecticide use."

I don't seem to see that anywhere.  Anyway, as I already pointed out, given the exact same land usage GM crops have lower environmental impact quotient than non-GM crops.  So, in these other important factors you mention, GM crops are overall superior.   Also, there are plenty of studies that have shown that, rather than decreasing pestacide use, GM crops have increased it. This study put the increase at 7%: http://www.enveurope.com/content/24/1/24[1]   Can you find any peer-reviewed papers that say this besides Benbrook?  If there are ""plenty"" I'm sure you can find more.  Benbrook's study is considered to be extremely flawed and directly contradicts more thorough studies published in both Nature and Science.  He also used ""extrapolated"" data (e.g. he used fuzzy statistics to make it up) rather than vetted USDA data, as the USDA data goes against the conclusion he wanted to make.  He's an outlier against USDA data as well as a large number of high-impact peer-reviewed journal articles and his methods were entirely questionable.   I did not know about the local variation thing, which is interesting, though it actually also doesn't really support the idea that these plants can possibly be tested thoroughly enough to minimize or eliminate all risk.   Nothing can be tested thoroughly enough to eliminate all risk.  You're doing the FUD thing again here.  Conventionally bred plants undergo zero mandatory testing.  All risk cannot be removed from conventionally bred plants.  You need to make an argument upon why GMO plants are inherently riskier than conventionally bred plants - this is the root of your failure so far.   Also, plants can undergo mutations, but they don't affect every plant in the field. They only affect a very, very small number. So, it's not really a reasonable or fair comparison to compare how much is known about one or the other.   Yes it does.  Random mutagenesis is a breeding technique.  The seeds of randomly mutagenized plants are then sowed into entire fields.  I'm not talking about a lone plant getting a mutation in a field, I'm talking about the methods organic and non-GM farmers use to create new breeds of plants."

Debate,2l0vp3,strangestdanger,6,Sun Nov 2 00:35:25 2014 UTC,"I teach environmental science for a living, as well as coaching debate.  Here is some advice:   Lower quality/unhealthy:  false.  PF values current research, not outdated and disproven research.  Even if you were trying to persuade with false information that scares people, your judge should be trained at least enough to know that the research is too out of date.  Also, every PRO team will be able to handle this, unless they are novices. Economic burdening:  There are two routes to take with this.  First, the patenting of seed genetics has lead to a harmful burden on any farmer who is not interested in buying GMO seeds yearly.  Large companies will bully them in courts until they run out of money, even if they are operating legally.  All it takes is for a little GMO seed to blow over from their neighbors field.  Second, GMO's allow for monoculture farming, which focuses on high volume, preventing developing country farmers from being able to compete in the market place.  Without GMO's, monoculture farming would collapse to to pests, regardless of the amount of pesticide use eventually.  The reason for this is that crops that are food to one pest may be poison to another.  If a pest colony developed in a monoculture, those pests would have no other species to poison them, and they would spread very quickly.   It is important to note that GMO's are engineered to be herbicide resistant, pest resistant, and increase yield.  Some GMO's (such as golden rice) are engineered to be more nutritious, but this isn't the norm.  The primary goal of the GMO is that the crop can survive the herbicides that kill the weeds, and survive the pests so less pesticide can be used.  This increases yield, which decreases price.  Price is driven back up by the US ordering crops to be burned (while paying the farmers).  This gives the US an unfair market advantage overall.   Unintended harms:  This one will seem pretty empty, since there are no viable unintended harms that aren't related to economic burdens. Increased waste is pointless.  They were purposefully wasting extra crops prior to the advent of GMO's.  They have even come up with dozens of uses for their waste to make it less wasteful (such as ethanol, corn based plastics, animal feed, high fructose corn syrup, etc.).   If I were you, I would stick with economic arguments, and I would also stress that Monsanto has basically set up a feudal economy, where every farmer must pay them tribute just to be a farmer."

Debate,2l0vp3,ProudNZ,1 point,Fri Nov 7 05:01:52 2014 UTC,"You might want to look in to your claims about large companies bullying farmers (assuming here you're going off the myth that monsanto sues farmers for accidental contamination). I think you'll be hard pressed to find any actual evidence of this bullying behaviour. You'll probably find a lot of anecdotes on various anti-gm websites, but no court documents or anything solid.   Also monocultures exist outside of GM crops, GM isn't really helping the issue here, but it isn't intrinsically part of the problem. As a side note reducing diversity by removing GM options wouldn't help either."
Debate,2l0vp3,adamwho,9,Mon Nov 3 23:37:00 2014 UTC,There are no harms unique to GMO.  You will find that all the arguments against GMOs are either false or are actually about modern farming in general.

Debate,2l0vp3,llsmithll,1 point,Wed Nov 5 15:32:41 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I think the best route to take here is linking GMO increase to excessive pesticide usage. It looks like a lot of crops are genetically modified to primarily maintain a resistance to these pesticides. Glyphosate is the primary pesticide, and it's being unceremoniously drenched over crops so that pests can't harm them, but glyphosate has so many awful, negative effects. It can be linked to cancer, autism, Alzheimer's, etc. This can also be an inefficiency argument as well as environmental collapse, since countries are beginning to emulate this practice."
Debate,2l0vp3,selbert,3,Sun Nov 2 16:34:46 2014 UTC,"Corn and soy are commodity products. If you look at the market for it, you'll see an increase in price the past 20 years. Landowners saw the value and what happened was a lot of beef pasture got turned into corn/soy. With that came an increase in pesticides simply because area increased."
Debate,2l0vp3,llsmithll,0,Sun Nov 2 17:29:24 2014 UTC,"Even if that is the case, people still persistently use the pesticides because the plants have been modified to withstand it. The fact that the area of the land used has increased makes it even worse.   So, even if the argument can't be made that pesticide overuse is entirely attributed to GM crops, it can still be argued that GMs facilitate this overuse. It's from 2001, but the relevant information is still applicable. Something useful:  Overview of the Use of Genetically Modified Organisms and Pesticides in Agriculture  Author(s): David Pimentel  Source: Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies, Vol. 9, No. 1, Symposium: Sustainable  Development, Agriculture, and the Challenge of Genetically Modified Organisms (Fall, 2001),  pp. 51-64   ""Since the 1980s, many crops have been genetically modified to create benefits such as resistance to insects, pathogens (including viruses), and herbicides. In addition, many crops have been genetically modified for improved features such as slower spoilage, improved nutrition, high protein, seedless fruit, and sweetness. Up to thirty-four approved to enter the market.16""  ""Since the advent of DDT use for crop protection in 1945, the global growth of agricultural pesticide use has been phenomenal. In 1945, about fifty million kilograms of pesticides were applied worldwide. Exhibiting an approximate sixty fold increase, global usage is currently at about three billion kilograms per year.46 In the United States, the annual use of synthetic pesticides have grown thirty three-fold to about 0.5 billion kilograms since 1945.47 Unfortunately, the increase in hazards is even greater than it might appear, as the toxicity of modern pesticides has increased more than ten-fold as compared to those used in the early 1950s.48 In 1945, when synthetic pesticides were first used, there were few pesticide poisonings. Globally, pesticide use increased to a high of 1.3 billion kilograms per year by 1973. At that time, the number of human pesticide poisonings reached an estimated 500,000 (with about 6,000 deaths annually).49 Two decades later, the World Health Organization reports approximately three million human pesticide poisonings each year worldwide.50 Approximately 220,000 cases each year result in death, and an estimated 735,000 result in chronic illnesse.51 Several pesticides, especially the organophosphate and carbamate classes, affect the nervous system by inhibiting Cholinesterase.52 This is particularly critical in children, since a child's brain is more than five times larger in proportion to its body weight than an adult's.53 In California, forty percent of the children working in agricultural fields have blood Cholinesterase levels below normal, indicating organophosphate and carbamate pesticide poisoning.54"""

Debate,2l0vp3,llsmithll,0,Sun Nov 2 18:04:35 2014 UTC,"No, I don't act like that. We were using them before, but at lesser levels. Cyclically, we would discover one to be too harmful after suffering major damages and switch to another. The purpose of a lot of genetic modification to crops was so they could survive high dosages of pesticides and herbicides. This facilitates overuse.   Even if you could prove proportionally, the amount used per acre of crop hasn't increased, the fact that GM crops are becoming common place shows that pesticide usage is only going to increase as other countries emulate the practice.  Edit: Downvoting me doesn't magically make me wrong.."

About how humans who eat diets containing GM crops have significantly higher levels of glyphosate in them than those who consume organic foods, and about case studies linking GM crops to increased herbicide use, as well as the studies linking glyphosate to cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Autism, and celiac disease.   It's about winning on the negative side.  Edit: Oh, and ill humans or those with weak health are shown to have higher levels of glyphosate in their bodies."

Debate,2l0vp3,TomCollator,7,Sun Nov 2 05:55:53 2014 UTC,I suppose.

You can't just mention super weeds, you'd need to try and explain why they are bad, which kind of falls flat on the GM front.   In the case of GM causing super weeds, it's nothing to do with the plants being GM and everything to do with the overuse of a single herbicide. So if we do end up with 'super weeds' immune to glyphosate it would only effect farmers using glyphosate, and only glyphosate as their herbicide.   It's not really a problem with GM, it's a problem with farming methods, and it won't effect any farms that aren't using that herbicide."

Greenhouse Gas/Pesticide Reductions   Third World Humanity Implications   We don't use any subpoints in this contention. Most of the evidence that we cite uses increases in yields in the third world.   Economic Benefits   a. Surpluses  b. Poverty  c. Job Creation  All three of these subpoints are fairly self explanatory.  Our con case we have had less success with and don't like as much, as it's too defensive. However, we run:   Health Issues Implementation Issues   a. Third World Problems  b. Ecological Harms  c. Corrupt Research   Biased Studies/Unforeseen Harms   We're planning on removing our last contention to make room for a better argument, such as the problem of superweeds, and using what we have written more as a block.

Debate,2l0q0z,jameshues,2,Sun Nov 2 00:00:18 2014 UTC,"Hi! As a second speaker that just started PF debate two months ago and now has a few tournaments of experience under his belt, let me offer some advice:  Pre-writing blocks to common arguments that the other side will make, and then timing those arguments, is probably your best friend. I would advise finding the arguments that each side makes, and write out a block to each of those arguments. That way, when the time comes to refute the opposition, you already know exactly what you're going to say, you just have to pick and choose the correct argument from the pre-written document.  Secondly, if you find that you still have substantial amounts of time in the rebuttal (a problem I had when I first started out) just bring up some new evidence. You don't even have to necessarily make a grand connection to your case - at worst, it's something new for the opposition and the judge to think about, and if the opposition doesn't address that, you can hammer it as a voting point by the end of the round.  Thirdly, if you are doing both of these things and find that you are still having problems filling the time, I would advise spending half of your prep on the rebuttal. This way you have more time to structure what you're going to say. Don't be afraid to use prep time! Remember that the rebuttal is the main response to the opposition's entire case: it is extremely important for setting up the summary and final focus speeches.  I can provide a couple of examples of the blocks I'm talking about if you PM me your email. They won't help you with this month's topic, but I have some blocks left over from last month's sports subsidies topic that might get you on the right track."
Debate,2l0q0z,bryceps41,1 point,Sun Nov 2 03:07:44 2014 UTC,"What I do to fill  extra time is have something to read as filler when I ready my speech. Sometimes I use a piece of evidence, sometimes something from the briefs, or sometimes something from my case."

So, the big thing is to write blocks, also called PTORS, I like to have at least 3 responses to every stock point on the topic, write them in a way that you can just read them. In addition you should read all of your evidence thoroughly. KNOW THE METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY. That way, if you have extra time, you can explain why your evidence is the best evidence in the round.

Debate,2km6cw,OlderBear,9,Tue Oct 28 22:28:41 2014 UTC,"There are a couple of things to remember that can do a whole lot to help you get a win over other new debaters. Also, how much time do you have to prep? my experience is with BP which has a 15 minute prep time and 7 minute speaking time. If yours is different, adapt accordingly, I guess...  First, every debate has at its core a single ideological clash that defines that debate. It might be ""big government vs small government"" or it might be ""development vs environmentalism"" or it might be ""punishment vs rehabilitation"". Figuring out what that clash is should be the first thing you do in prep time. A lot of teams in prep time will panic, they will say ""shit, I've got 15 minuets(or whatever you've got) before I need to speak. I need a thing to say. This is a thing. therefore I will say it."" Writing arguments that do not hit on the clash of the debate waste your time. Figure out the clash, then write the arguments. Most new teams lose simply because they don't spend their speaking time talking about anything relevant.   Secondly, when you are proposing something you need to have a clear problem you are setting out to solve. When you hear the topic, take a moment to think ""why did they set this topic?"". The people who set it probably had a particular debate in mind that they were looking for, if you can find that you are well on your way. Then when you know what problem you are solving be really clear to the judge what that problem is and why it is a problem. Then lay out clearly how your solution affects that problem. Avoid things like a ""problem/solution gap"" where you claim to solve a giant problem with a tiny uncontroversial solution. If you are on opposition and see the proposition do that, point it out to get an easy win. Be bold with how you set up the debate.   Thirdly, adopt a world view that supports your side. Your need to remember that no one proves anything in an impromptu debate, no one has statistics or evidence. What you need to do is make a particular type of understanding about how the world works more compelling for the judges. This goes back to my first point, about finding the clash. If you are on the small government side of a big vs small government clash then there are a couple of things you can intuit about the debate. When the other side asks you about some random issue that you haven't thought about, because you know that you favor a small government world you just need to ask yourself ""what do small government people think about this issue?"" and give that answer. When the other side has an argument and it doesn't have any immediately obvious logical gaps or factual inadequacies, you will at least have a philosophical alternative you can clash it with. So the result will be that your answer on a lot of issues will be ""we need less government intervention"". And when the other side makes an argument you say ""yeah, but free markets actually solve a lot of those problems cos it's not good business practice to only serve one race at your business"", or ""people don't need the government to protect them from this, they are smart and can look after themselves"", or ""the government can't decide how I should act for me cos only I know what will make me happy, or how happy this will make me, so I should decide"". All of these things don't just sit on their own. They slowly build up into a picture of the world that says that small government is the best option.   Fourth is the slightly more advanced version of that (you may find it useful anyway) which is to understand that small gov vs big gov is not a dichotomy but a spectrum. On a spectrum of how we understand government intervention there are a whole lot of places you can put yourself. Down one end is some sort of anarcho-libertarian position, at at the other is complete communism. Obviously both of those are silly positions to take in the debate (unless the topic is crazy, in which case it is your only shot at the win). You should take the time to define clearly where you stand, saying why you don't want to go into big government world, but also why you don't want to be radical libertarian. This firstly helps to make your world even more clear to the judge, and secondly stops the other team straw-manning your arguments by saying ""If the free market solved everything they'd privatize the fire departments!"". Take the time to protect that flank, so you have already said ""Obviously some things should be solved by the public sector, things like national defense or the police force, but when something is a subjective individual decision, like the choice to get healthcare at the cost of wages now (or whatever your debate is), that should be left to individuals to decide."" So at the cost of only a few words you have protected yourself from a whole lot of attacks.   Lastly, if you are struggling for things to say there are some ways to think about this. You can look at stakeholders. These are all the groups who might be affected by this topic. Work out how each will be affected by the debate, you may have missed someone who could be important. Second, make a wish list of what you would like to be able to prove. Then see if you can think of ways to prove it. Third, just write out everything you know about the situation as it is now. Sometimes that will jog out a an idea. Lastly and most importantly, going back to what I was saying before, ask yourself what sort of reasonable person supports you side of the topic, and then ask what that person believes about the world.   Those are my thoughts for now, if I think of more things I'll let you know!"

As I read these comments, I want to give a heads up that you do not need to spread to be successful in policy (especially novice and JV). Yes, many people speak quickly, but some of the best people do not (the finals of the NDT are often won by a slow and meticulous speech).   There's a free book available on intercollegiate policy debate - you can find it here: https://www.academia.edu/2403650/Finding_Your_Voice_A_Comprehensive_Guide_to_Collegiate_Policy_Debate  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions. I've been involved in the community for over a decade, so can possibly provide some answers."
Debate,2kii6p,maegman,3,Tue Oct 28 13:22:22 2014 UTC,"A couple of things.  First, if you really want to debate for Northwestern, you should contact their head coach and talk to them. They'll be able to give you better, more specific information than anyone here on their program, and what they expect in the transition.  Second, apply to a variety of schools, and consider what kind of policy debate sounds appealing. Some schools specialize in particular styles of debate and you should be aware of that going in. Does talking about government policies, political backlash in Congress, and the economy sound good? Then you'll love a traditional styled team like NU or Georgetown. Does a more philisophical apporach that questions the foundations of knowledge and action sound cool? Then you might like more non-traditional schools like Emporia, West Georgia, or Wake. Do you want a really diverse mix? Then schools like Weber are probably a good choice. Obviously you can't know everything you're interested in yet because you haven't done policy debate, but think it over. It's easier to do some styles in some programs.  You don't have to spread to be competitive, but many do. It's an acquired skill like anything else, and you can start practicing now if you'd like to hit the ground running. Especially in a novice division, spreading isn't a thing that really happens. It's a little more common in JV, but even then it's not true spread (compared to the nat'l circuit), just an uptick in tempo.  If you'd like to see if policy debate is for you, talk to some college debaters, honestly. Watch some debate in person or online from a variety of styles to see what the best of the best have to offer. And if it's a video with lots of spread, don't worry - no one starts off being able to listen that fast, you'll adjust :)"
Debate,2kii6p,KingOfSockPuppets,5,Tue Oct 28 21:46:11 2014 UTC,"At the rate PF is evolving, it's going to be a slightly watered-down version of policy very soon. When I come out of a round, people comment that my way of debating is very policy-like already, since I do spread and throw cards during the debate, although I've never done policy in my life. In the end, it kind of just depends on how you personally did PF previously, and how you compare to both types of the debate. I'd definitely say policy is much more evidence-oriented than PF, and you'll be dealing with a lot more other forms of argument in the round such as kritiks and plans. Go ask an actual experienced policy debater for more help and a better explanation of what to look for."
Debate,2kii6p,ggdebatelyfe,2,Tue Oct 28 01:59:04 2014 UTC,"Video of the kind of the competition you would see at the highest levels.  If you can follow, then you're probably set. If you can sort of follow, then you can probably learn fairly quickly. If you can't follow at all, then you are likely going to need to start working now. Sidebar has stuff to get started. Transition to your policy team if you can/have one.  Note: follow doesn't necessarily mean only being able to flow. You'll notice that not everything is getting flowed, and that's probably because they have each other's cards. By follow, I mean understand what's going on if someone starts talking about theory (e.g., ""T,"" ""switch-side debate,"" ""jurisdiction,"" why T is important and how it functions in the round versus other arguments, etc.) and kritiks (the piece of paper itself and the usual philosophies you see).  All that being said, I don't know how NW picks their team. It may be something where they're open to everyone, or maybe you have to be chosen, or maybe you have to compete to get in. If there's some sort of barrier to entry, then you should definitely start working now."
Debate,2kii6p,jimibabay,5,Tue Oct 28 02:18:31 2014 UTC,"I would disagree about flowing and speech comprehension - it's an acquired skill, same as anything else. Any team that you join will have you observe a series of practice debates and you'll start picking things up pretty quickly.  As for Northwestern, there team is open - you just email the coaching staff and indicate your interest. As an FYI, nearly all teams are paperless these days, so you'll need to familiarize yourself with the tech (it's WAY easier now than it was 5 years ago)."

Debate,2kii6p,maegman,2,Wed Oct 29 18:08:39 2014 UTC,"Former PF debater here. To be perfectly honest, Northwestern isn't the best pick, not to say that you can't transfer from PF to policy and do well, its just that given the way that some programs focus on some things (some focus on winning the largest national championships at the end of the year,  while others try to get more people involved for all levels, and attempt to win national championships), other schools would offer many many more opportunities for you to relatively grow. Most schools on the east coast are more likely to give debaters who are transitioning from Public Forum to Policy a much better experience than Northwestern would. I'd also recommend George Mason if you're interested in debating policy in college. But the best way to find schools that will give you the most opportunity to enjoy yourself and debate frequently is your best bet. Though it shouldn't be that way, Northwestern will not give you many, or the best opportunities to be successful with your transition.  Also I can't really speak for parli debate, Policy does offer a bit, in at least research and some speaking skills that are only unique to that format of debate.  PM for details if you're interested."
Debate,2kii6p,FirewaterDM,2,Tue Oct 28 06:12:50 2014 UTC,"Experience knowing people who went to northwestern: You will not make the team. They are incredibly selective about their debate team. The fastest, and probably smartest debater in Kansas in 2012 missed a spot on the team, they didn't even respond to his inquiries about joining the team. Not until he got a recommendation from the KU coach Scott Harris did they give him a walk on position. He never went to any tournaments and just cut cards the entire time. It took all that to become a card cutting machine. If you wanna debate in college, do not go to northwestern unless you are one of the best debaters on the national circuit of policy. You have to be that good."

Like there are automated citing systems (Mendeley for one, and Verbatim has there own), but what if you use a chrome extension and it not only cites the document (I.e., pubmed, sciencedirect, springer link, CNN, nyt, Reuters, arxiv etc.) but also formats them automatically as a card (the tag would be the article title, and obviously this is changeable anyway), so that all you have to do is highlight the important text?  That would save a ton of time."

Debate,2k8nsb,fangerooooo,5,Fri Oct 24 22:43:50 2014 UTC,"I think both of those are really tough cons. For the private prisons I do have some thoughts. Firstly, you need to set up exactly what the contracts for private prisons should look like. Specifically, you need to find a way to contract for rehabilitation as a KPI. Maybe impose a retroactive fine on the prison if an inmate re-offends once released. There's a bunch of other stuff that can be contracted in, but that's the main one.   So moving on to arguments, I think the most important thing is to portray the public prison system as being caught between the willingness of politicians to be ""tough on crime"", which increases prison population, and political unwillingness to spend more on actually housing those prisons. The only way out of that is to reduce the cost per prisoner, and private prisons are able to do that. The fact that they are a step back from the political/electoral process means they don't have to be standardized. They can try new forms of prison management without being worried about the consequences of a political backlash. Over time, those that adopt policies that save money, or better fulfill their contracted KPI's survive as companies, win more contracts etc. This is the power of free markets to increase efficiency and correct inefficiencies over time.   This process is likely to actually increase standards of living for prisoners within that system over time, as small increases in prison welfare dramatically reduce the violence within prisons and so reduces the cost of housing them. When cost is the driving factor that process is possible. Politicians, however, don't want to be associated with ""luxury prisons"" and so don't allow the public prison system to undergo the same process.   Those are my thoughts. I personally think its a pretty crap case, but it might be the best you've got, and I actually think it's a bit better than the military surplus for police one, tbh."
Debate,2k8nsb,asthedrivensnow,4,Sat Oct 25 02:38:23 2014 UTC,"Since the resolution discusses a broad ban and not a cost benefit analysis, could be effective to set up a framework on the con that says something along the lines of ""Pro must demonstrate that no possible implementation of private prisons will be beneficial"" since they are burdened with advocating for a ban of all implementations.

However, Baily's claim that congress is ""by far the most change prone event in forensics"" is laughably false. While their might be some small and gradual shifts in judging (which debaters can and should pay attention to), finals of Harvard ten years ago didn't look much different than it did today. In that same time period, PF has become significantly more techincal, policy has seen a large increase in the prevalence of performance and K Affs, and LD has practically morphed into a different event through the mass proliferation of theory, speed, and dense philosophy. Of the four debate events, congress is by far the most static. Again, this isn't a reason why the article is wrong (it isn't); it's just an argument for why it would be more persuasive with a different framing."

Debate,2jxr2s,vinadvani,-1,Wed Oct 22 07:09:05 2014 UTC,"I have way too many stories to tell here.  Once, during a round against a nationally-ranked debater( who was a redhead) I asked if the carpet matched the drapes. The judge was not nearly as amused as I was.  Another time, while debating energy, I told my opponent in crossfire that I would love nothing more than to have a nuclear power plant in my backyard, they are, after all, completely safe.  Yet another time, I said that I was irrelevant that China has a bigger army than us, we have more nukes and could nuke them into submission. Audible gasp from the Asian judge.   Probably my crowning fuck up: During a congress round, I said that we should deal with Latin American child refugees by summarily executing them.

Debate,2jvben,ashton90,7,Tue Oct 21 07:47:53 2014 UTC,"I'm a believer in pen drills. I think they're great for enunciation. The pen goes sideways in your mouth, held between molars. It should stretch your cheeks back a bit at the corners of your mouth. Then read something, quickly, aloud. This forces you to work your cheek muscles, and maneuver your tongue around that pen. Make sure you're working your cheeks and lips.   Another effective tool is to make a fist, and extend your index finger such that you have just the folded-up knuckle sticking out. Then place that between your front teeth and talk around it. That hurts like hell, so don't do it for too long, but it'll help you keep your mouth wide, which is key to enunciating clearly.  As for other things to help with speed, I would recommend taking your text and deliberately inserting a word in between each word. (Me and Suzie and went and to and the and schoolyard...etc. You get the drift.) Reading backwards from the bottom of the text to the top is useful too. The idea is to sort of decouple the mechanical act of speaking what is read from that instinct in the brain to subvocalize words as you read. Spreeder (spreeder.com) is also a useful tool for working on this skill. Crank it up and read aloud. When you're comfortable at one speed, crank it a little farther and do it again, etc.   As you get better with enunciation and with rapid reading aloud, more rapid delivery without the script becomes a natural consequence. Good luck!  Source: 2 NFL Diamonds, and 19 years in the activity."
Debate,2jvben,IAmScience,5,Tue Oct 21 09:54:15 2014 UTC,"Another thing is I've done (only for prepared speeches) is to read your speech backwards. I believe it helps with out having to think about what word is gonna come next so you can just read and not focus on the actual structure of the sentence. I like this because it helps with speed, and when you're actually reading you're thinking less about saying the words, and more about the topic you're speaking."

Debate,2jvben,BocefusD,2,Tue Oct 21 20:07:51 2014 UTC,"Perhaps you should consider using a wine cork instead of a pen. We did so and it was much more comfortable to chew on cork. However, this exercise might help you work on your pronunciation, but (at least in my case) slowed it down instead of speaking faster.   Although you might been tempted to deliver more content to an audience by speeding up your speaking, a moderate tempo appears more convenient for the listeners (in my opinion)."
Debate,2jvben,z3ng3l,1 point,Tue Oct 21 08:19:33 2014 UTC,"The pen trick is what has helped me the most!  You line it up with your eyes, as you said, and bite down on it with your molars. Then you read through a paragraph or a speech repeatedly until someone can understand what you are saying. Then, take out the pen and speak your piece again.  Your enunciation will be better!"
Debate,2jvben,ninjabutterfly8,1 point,Sun Nov 2 02:05:53 2014 UTC,"For enunciation, I always do alphabet aerobics before rounds. Its kind of dumb, but it really helps.

Debate,2jncow,jaycgibbs,7,Sat Oct 18 23:30:51 2014 UTC,"Absolutely not. Did you report the judge? Sounds like a blatantly obvious case of inappropriate bias to me. If he admits that you won the debate, and then dropped you because of evidence he called ""asinine"", that's him personally challenging the evidence, which the judge should never do in a proper debate."

It worked and I got a new judge."

Debate,2jncow,Clusterfist,3,Mon Oct 20 22:13:35 2014 UTC,"It shouldn't at all. If you won the debate round, then you should have won the ballot, as the judge's only job is I determined which team won the round."
Debate,2jncow,dragomaser,3,Sun Oct 19 01:26:14 2014 UTC,"Dang, that sucks. I know that feeling though. We were at NatQuals last year debating the single gender classrooms topic and were debating novices in one round.   What happened in the round:  *We (Neg) completely wrecked their evidence (everything they had was from Leonard Sax, we said super biased source and opponents never responded)  *They (Aff) tried to attack my study by saying it didn't isolate factors but I literally just read the sentence in the study that said all factors were isolated and single gender classrooms were the only factors in affecting the results (Also offered to show the judge the evidence in case he didn't believe it... opponents dropped their attack at this point)  The judge's RFD:  ""Well, both sides did a good job but you know, this Leonard Sax guy the pro mentioned, I really like him. What he says really makes sense to me. Also, the con's study is flawed. I know this because I did some research on this topic because my son does PF too.""  (At this point I, once again, offered to show the judge the evidence.)   ""No, its ok. I know what the evidence says.""  (I say, once more, that I can show him where the study isolates the variables... judge flat out refuses to see my study)  ""Therefore, because I really liked this Leonard Sax that the Pro brought up and because the Con had no arguments, Pro wins""  TL;DR: Judge disregards legitimate con evidence and believes shady pro evidence instead  But yeah, thats what happens when you have lay judges."

Debate,2jncow,EasternZone,2,Sun Oct 19 04:29:07 2014 UTC,"The judge should have determined which team did the better debating, not which team he agreed with more. It's unfortunate but these kind of things happens on occasion, and there's no real way to deal with it."

We ended up totally killing the other team, but the judge voted us down because we said we would save ""American lives""; however, the judge thought it was more correct to say ""saving the lives of Americans as well as visitors and illegal aliens."" Apparently we were being completely discriminatory, so we were dropped. I thought that was a pretty ridiculous decision."
Debate,2jncow,elephantower,-1,Sun Oct 19 15:06:07 2014 UTC,"Ugh my partner and I have had that before. Once a judge's RFD was along the lines of ""well, you won the substance debate, but you were dicks and so I'm voting you down"". Now, that would have been reasonable, except for the fact that it was our second tournament, and we had apparently broken some arcane evidentiary rules known only to the judge (thus the RFD), and certainly weren't trying to be mean."

Debate,2jkw45,Hoganbeardy,2,Mon Oct 20 17:23:54 2014 UTC,"Are you interested in doing debate in college? If so, what format? Public Forum is very small in college; few schools compete in it. More common are Policy (CEDA/NDT), Parli (NPDA/NPTE which is just policy sans cards or APDA, which is more ""lay""), NFA-LD (1 vs 1 policy with rules against speed and many k's), British parliament or Worlds (4 teams of 2 in a lay style debate). There are videos of all of these on YouTube, Vimeo, WUDC.   If you want to get into policy or parli policy, I would recommend judging high school rounds. You can judge novice, get some basic instruction and get paid for it. It's a good way to learn how a round ""works."""
Debate,2jkw45,omnomnub,2,Mon Oct 20 22:59:35 2014 UTC,"I have thought about doing debate in college.  Unfortunately, I have some personal issues that would make it difficult for me.  I've always had problems with articulation, for which I've seen a speech pathologist for most of my life.  In high school I was good enough to break in most tournaments, but judges sometimes commented that my speeches were slurred and I remember once an opponent said in her NC that she couldn't understand me.    But I could try being a high-school judge, yeah.  That had never occurred to me.  Thanks!"
Debate,2jkw45,omnomnub,1 point,Mon Oct 20 23:18:11 2014 UTC,"If you want to do college debate, then you should do college debate. You should see what type of events your school competes in. While you obviously know your speech impediment better than I do, there has been a large push in college forensics -- especially NPDA Parli and CEDA/NDT -- to include people who may not traditionally participate in debate. I have seen debaters with autism, debaters who are partially deaf and debaters with speech impediments be nationally competitive."
Debate,2jkw45,vapan25,2,Wed Oct 22 13:53:36 2014 UTC,"Policy is quite advanced and usually those who can understand the debates are those who have done it themselves.

Usually, you should be able to understand all the arguments and chain of thought. After a while you may be able to upgrade yourself to LD and eventually policy."

Debate,2jh5f4,Gamati,4,Fri Oct 17 01:30:50 2014 UTC,"My team has come to a consensus that this topic is bad for one reason, the current media on it and its effect on the judges. With all the attacks on GMOs coming from the media, it will be incredibly difficult to convince lay judges that GMOs are anything but bad. This in turn leads to debates possibly coming down to the coin flip depending on your judge, which is something I never want."

Debate,2jh5f4,Clusterfist,3,Mon Oct 20 01:11:00 2014 UTC,"Oh god, I completely disagree. I think the topic is incredibly pro heavy. Like the subsidies topic, there is a consensus among scientific research that gmo's are healthy and beneficial. Such studies include a meta analysis of over 2000 studies, a study of 1 trillion meals and a study of health on over 1 billion animals. I think no judge will be able to deny these.   Plus, pro makes logical sense. Gmo's are designed to fit certain conditions, like drought, high heat or high salt content and would logically preform better than their non-altered counterparts that lack treatment in these areas. It's difficult to provide a warrant why gmo's fail. Pro has distinct ground on a worldly basis, as countries need these changes. One study showed a billion lives saved as a result of the introduction of gmos   Worst of all, con has very little ground that is well research. Most arguments make sense but lack depth of impacts. For example, teams run that increased pesticides/herbacides create super organisms. So what? It's a natural adaptation that farmers have had to overcome for centuries. The idea of increased pesticide/herbacide as a result of super organisms sounds great, but has no affect on health. Also, many teams will run harms to organism populations, like bees or the monarch butterfly, but these arguments lack support. First, these arguments rely on chemicals, not the gmos, such as neonictinoids to cause damage. Not only is this nonunique to gmos, but also has nothing to do with the gmos themselves. Second, the impact isn't huge. If gmos killed 1/3 of the world's bees, I'm pretty positive the news would talk about it and the world would be in chaos, as 1/3 of the world's food would just vanish   I really struggle to see how con can win rounds. Just like pro on the subsidies topic, con is simply going to be destroyed with stable, very well supported arguments"
Debate,2jh5f4,Clusterfist,1 point,Mon Oct 20 16:58:48 2014 UTC,"Well to be honest I'm not so sure pro is actually that skewed in actual research. A lot of the stock arguments for pro don't measure up in the real world- I've spent far too long looking into this, and I'm fairly confident that if the con focuses on more sociopolitical impacts, instead of fearmongering about human health risk, they have a clear shot to winning. It just seems to me that everyone's taken this ""con is ridiculous and requires BS arguments"" stance before looking into it deeply, because there are some points that pro just can't contend on. GMOs are dominated by Bt resistance and herbicide resistance- the share of research on crops that are amazingly useful in a developing country is almost nil simply because their governments can't afford to do the research themselves and major corporations don't have an incentive to create an engineered crop that won't sell globally. There's also the fact that while Roundup is an amazingly low-impact herbicide, environmentally, we're reaching the point where it will start to lose efficiency due to those superweeds- while they're not unique to GMOs, GMOs have directly caused the increase in Roundup usage that isn't sustainable. We're going to have to switch to a new main herbicide before long, and it's unlikely that we can develop one that's so non-damaging (for a pesticide) as Roundup."

Debate,2je3fq,thewaybricksdont,4,Sun Nov 2 01:01:40 2014 UTC,"I don't think that this will really change the issue of it being ""un-educational"" because if you look at policy (which is fundamentally what you would turn PF into) you already know which teams run which arguments and you have a set strategy for each case. There are like 5 cases that ever get run and the strategy never changes. You have your same DA shell, Your same theory or kritik blocks every time and it become repetitive (everything leads to famine, biodiversity loss or nuclear war, or loss of the human condition..... Always).   For PF the education comes in researching the pro's and cons of a new topic monthly and having to argue each case. Your education is much more topic based, and it's hard to deny that you find that in PF. Each month you have a new strat, write new plans and new speeches. PF teaches you speaking skills and eloquence which are not learned in policy.  You will never see these things fully implemented in PF because there is a reason they have distinctive debate styles, each one focuses on and teaches different aspects of argumentation and debate. PF allows you to debate the pro's and cons of a stance while policy is about defending the merits of a single course of action.   However, to address your question more specifically, For all of them it is in part time but more importantly it's because if you added them you would functionally have policy debate which already exists.  Theory/Topicality: You see this a bit, but not in the same way. And certainly it has a much greater presence than when I was in high school 7 years ago. It's ran as definitions and framework-ish arguments, you also see arguments about framers intent and when people run abusive limitations and interpretations of the plan. You really can't spend too much more time or get in greater depth because you still have to run contentions.   K's: This is another issue of time and place. Some topics do offer a more K like argument (I remember one on civil disobedience which afforded more flexibility). We already struggle on comparing quantifiable and non-quantifiable impacts and adding K's only muddies the water. Furthermore, you fundamentally cannot run K's without also being able to run framework and theory.   Plan's: Because this fundamentally undermines the purpose of PF. PF is there to discuss the pro's and cons of a topic. A plan limits the debate to a single course of action. It limits the scope of discussion.   Overall, you can't add one or two of these things without ultimately adding all of them. You also would have to change the rules of PF and make it policy."
Debate,2je3fq,confetti27,2,Sun Nov 2 03:49:07 2014 UTC,"If you think kritiks promote discourse, you should really look again. At least where I am from (PA), kritiks always became a race to the bottom attempt to spew cards first and not explain them later. They always were some obscure piece of philosophy which the debaters couldn't explain, and which if they did understand, they wouldn't argue for.   If you want to make philosophy arguments, make them in an accessible way, and make them make sense to the judge."

Debate,2je3fq,bubblycrim,1 point,Thu Oct 16 12:40:08 2014 UTC,"There are ways to do it, but they can't be run in the traditional sense of kritik and such from Policy. Its often very risky, as the nature of PF is to gear towards a public audience. Things like direct plans are in fact banned in the rule book to establish a separation with policy. I don't think rounds become repetitive, because there are a lot of creative things you can do and a lot of interesting arguments and ways of giving those arguments that can be creative. Its all about the performance when it comes to PF, which I personally like. I mean, you're going to lose rounds if you aren't prepared up to the brim, but the performance is where that all goes."

Debate,2il89k,WhiteMagicalHat,3,Tue Oct 7 19:47:12 2014 UTC,"One key argument for the opposition is that the kind of crimes that would warrant the death penalty, particularly murder, are not generally crimes that are committed by people who are thinking rationally about the benefits and costs of doing so. These are crimes of passion, driven by complete anger or contempt.   It's not like people sit there planning a murder thinking 'hmm, now the benefits of me killing my abusive ex-girlfriend are pretty great, but the penalty in place is really harsh, and the benefits don't really outweight the punishment, so I think I won't do it.'  Also, they may well claim that even if people do think rationally about the consequences, convicted murderers might actually prefer the death penalty to life imprisonment because it's over much more quickly, in which case it's a less effective deterrent than a life prison sentence.  As far as I know there are also a load of statistics about US states that have the death penalty and have a higher rate of violent crime than those that don't.  If your opponents are even vaguely competent, some of this material will come up. To be honest, this is quite a hard motion for proposition."

Debate,2ihne1,MrPsychic,2,Mon Oct 6 21:34:16 2014 UTC,"Mr psychic, first I would like to say that this is not in fact the best subreddit for your inquiry,  try /r/gument or/r/gue forgot which one it is, this sub is for organized debate competitions at the high school and college level  But to get to your question a little, first that's a really fucking broad question one that I think that depends more on the individual then anything, though their are societal norms of security it is very difficult to determine the proper balance, to address your main talking point of freedom -> violence, I'm not sure I buy that, i think you can argue that lack of security would allow for that sort of violence to take place, but I'm personally compelled by the argument that too much power in the hands of the state leads to violence against individuals, I think a better argument to make is again that the state doesn't really over step it's bounds too much and that I'd rather have to deal with some increased government presence in my life and know I'm safe in my bed every night because big brother is watching, because at the end of the day, there's no way you can be happy if you're dead  Those are just a few thoughts, again your topic is pretty broad best to break it dien into a few germane examples like nsa and tsa and stuff and point to places where the government has successfully protected us, though I would advise against bringing up iraq or police effectiveness or marijuana/drug stuff"
Debate,2ihne1,mistuhgee,1 point,Tue Oct 7 01:25:10 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the advice on it, and I know the topic is broad but it is my teachers first year teaching the class and she wants to do different stuff than the norm that was laid out for her. Also I was thinking about going along the lines of big brother protecting us and making our lives stable at the cost of freedom. But what you said might be like the cut line to base our arguments on. You can't be happy if you are dead and if you are free to do whatever you want the masses lives get put in danger."
Debate,2ihne1,mistuhgee,1 point,Tue Oct 7 01:36:38 2014 UTC,"Is your teacher a fresh college kid?  And yea something along those lines, though again I would try to steer clear of giving freedom to the masses -> violence, because the only way I could see that being an issue is if either the state was completely dissolved and there was just anarchy, or if we lived in a postapocalyptic society where everyone is cannibalistic  I think another argument you can spin off of life key to happiness, is that at some level the government is needed to protect and provide ways for individuals to find happiness."
Debate,2ihne1,mistuhgee,1 point,Tue Oct 7 01:42:29 2014 UTC,She isn't but she has been teaching 7th and 8th grade kids for a while and the previous AP English teacher retired and you need a masters degree to teach the class so she had to take it.

You could make the argument that if Israel is more stable (like your two state solution will make it), then the region as a whole will have a power player to move the new found Israeli stability to the region as a whole."
Debate,2igflg,mhsMILKe,2,Mon Oct 6 19:36:46 2014 UTC,"Hey OP pm me and I'll send you some sources and articles. I've done a lot of work with a very large national organization on this issue, and have lobbied for bills on it. Start out with the basics, look up Council on Foreign Relations' Israeli-Palestinian Conflict background thingy. It's interactive. http://www.cfr.org/israel/crisis-guide-israeli-palestinian-conflict/p13850  I also advocate for a 2 state, it's been bipartisan US policy for decades, and the only realistic solution to advocate for, right now. The Israeli people place a HUGEEE FUCKING amount of importance on having a Jewish state. If there were a binational solution, the state would be controlled by the Arab majority, thus losing the Jewish nature of Israel. Wikipedia 2 state solution.   In Foreign Affairs most recent book on the conflict, it's noted that by 2020 the 2 state will no longer be possible. Hell it's barely possible now with settlement growth, because if we're working with 1967 borders in any solution (which both parties assent to), then there are tons of Israelis living in the West Bank, which will be the future state of Palestine (fingers crossed). They'll either be relocated or Israel will have to give 1-1 land swaps (what even right wing 2 staters would at least have to assent to).  Simply put, the 1 state us idealistic. It will NEVER fly with Israelis, especially the right wingers, some of which say it should be a one state, all Israel all Jewish. So the 2 state is about pragmatism, finding common ground between two peoples who will almost never negotiate the solution themselves.  Forcing the 1 state down Israels throat isn't gonna work. The politicians are masters of propaganda and fear mongering, building unity. If we ostracize the country they'll only galvanize the right wingers support because of it, and they'll retreat into this nationalism.   Edit: found them   Links links links: Martin Indyk's (former U.S. special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations) page on Brookings Institute:http://www.brookings.edu/experts/indykm Assumed Martin Indyk being anonymous and talking about why the most recent round of negotiations failed:  http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4515821,00.html  Council on Foreign Relations:  http://www.cfr.org/israel/israeli-palestinian-negotiations/p32136 http://www.cfr.org/israel/israeli-palestinian-negotiations-three-things-know/p31156  Kurtzer's model:  http://wws.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/content/Israel-Palestine-Negotiations_Online_Version_Lowres.pdf  State Dept.

Because if you're Congress, then the argument will be harder, if you're saying we should advocate this or this generally, then the 2 state is a pretty clear winner for competent people, since Congress is very ""Israel can do no wrong"" on this issue.   Also I'm not Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, nor Muslim. I was introduced to this conflict last year, the bias is unimaginable on both sides."

Cut yo own damn files)  I will note beforehand that all yo' con cases need a GMO means genetic insertion definition.  Selectively bred crops are technically GMO, but make this topic more fucked than it already is.  GMO -> genetic pollution -> bad  Malthus  Bio-diesel bad  GMO -> artificially constrains gene pool -> super plant viruses and/or random mutation makes a disease effective against waay more of a single crop than it would naturally -> food collapse bad  implementation of GMO is cap -> cap bad   That last one is especially interesting.  It should be noted that we produce a huge amount of food.  A substantial amount of this food rots because we don't anyone to sell it to anyone because people can't afford it (people meaning internationally) This means the pro cases talking about all the people they feed is probably bull - GMO can be beneficial, but it isn't.  A fun quote for you now read:   ""The world already produces more than 1.5 times enough food to feed everyone on the planet. That's enough to feed 10 billion people, the population peak we expect by 2050. But the people making less than $2 a day — most of whom are resource-poor farmers cultivating unviably small plots of land — can't afford to buy this food. Put these factors together and the picture is clear. Modern hunger is not a consequence of food scarcity, but of poverty, inequality and corporate control of the food system.

Debate,2ibl1h,backcountryguy,1 point,Sun Oct 5 17:04:53 2014 UTC,"I think the neg actually has a pretty great opportunity on this topic. It reminds of the multilateralism topic a few years back when I was debating. If I were still debating PF here's what I would do after giving the documentary Food Inc another watch:   Small farms. The existence of GMO's allows large farms to buy out small farms, gain a monopoly on food and then jack up food prices while effectively engaging in slave-labor. You basically get a whole contention to talk about why Monsanto is evil to people. Your framework arguments can talk about human capital being the most important type of capital. This argument has a lot of strategic flexibility. GMO's are a large justification for the ownership of life.  The ability to own life is SUPER threatening. You can go far left and talk about biopower, go far right and talk about how life, freedom of life is sacred.  Super bugs. Some argue GMO's could very well lead to a superbug wiping out a good portion of the human race. It doesn't matter if people have enough food if they all die from diseases we can't fight.    Finally I would spend the rest of my time generating offense against generic positions on the gov. People are obviously going to talk about food aid -- doesn't happen with GMO's and copyrighted life. People will talk about pesticides -- doesn't matter if we cause superbugs in another, worse way. Another route to take could be that moving away from GMO's could signal a move to small, sustained agriculture. This is a great topic for the neg because the aff is going to be so bad at engaging much of the literature base."
Debate,2ibl1h,giantsaints12,2,Tue Oct 7 18:33:40 2014 UTC,Non-Unique that is problem with patent system not with actual genetically modified foods Also non-unique just because Monsanto has a patent on the gmo's does not make them inherently bad Once again non-unique do to natural selection super bugs would occur any way (I also don't see any showing a super bug that would wipe out a could portion of the population) the only legitimate way to argue that is the increase in speed in which that occurs which is out weighed by the benefits that gmo's provide
Debate,2ibl1h,backcountryguy,2,Mon Oct 6 03:07:04 2014 UTC,The smartest thing a neg team can do is run some RA that says implementation of GMO is core topic ground.  Implementation gives them access to args 1 and 2.  In relation to number three timeframe is not how anyone should be framing a superbug issue.  There is an invisible threshold on when these impacts occur.  Instead phrase them in terms of probability.

There might be an example of the food itself going bad, but the reality is current  testing probably mitigates any potential harms. The other posts in this thread should have that covered.  You should make this debate about the actions of Monsanto. They use GMOs for their own benefit, exploiting farmers with crops genetically designed to last only one season, so they have to go back to Monsanto for more, at every growing (pardon the pun) prices.  This is pretty bad. So, maybe, the harms of that outweigh the benefits of GMOs, given that GMOs have the most utility in the third world, and also the most harms."

Debate isn't about wining and losing, its not about proving your point or changing someone's opinion. If that's your goal you have the whole academic sport wrong. It's about learning. At the point where you say there is no other side and that your side is right you have ended the learning.     I'm not going to list my points for you on the con side, as this is both an academic and a competitive sport, so by me giving you my ideas and points I have ended your learning and have given you a competitive advantage.

Because this is the culmination of thousands of other peer-reviewed articles, I can't see how it doesn't represent widespread scientific consensus that GM foods represent NO risk to animals.

Debate,2hzorq,BigWilley01,2,Sat Oct 4 16:52:06 2014 UTC,"Sorta. Its true that we have been focusing on GMOs in mostly rich countries, but according to this article there is growing promise that GMO use in developing countries is improving yields and cutting back on pesticide and herbicide use. Sauce   For the decade between 1991 and 2001, cotton yields in India were flat, at around 300 kilograms per hectare (a hectare is about 2.5 acres). In 2002, Bt cotton was introduced into the country. Farmers adopted it quickly, and yields of cotton soared by two thirds in just a few years to more than 500 kilograms per hectare. Between 1975 and 2009, researchers found that Bt cotton produced 19 percent of India’s yield growth, despite the fact that it was only on the market for 8 of those 24 years. The simpler view is that Bt cotton, in India, lifts yields by somewhere between 50 percent and 70 percent.  In China we’ve seen similar impacts of Bt cotton, with multiple studies showing that Bt cotton increased yields, boosted the incomes of 4 million smallholder farmers, and reduced pesticide poisoning among them.   The article goes onto say that,   All of this is to say that GM crops have more impact in poor countries than rich ones. Where other types of inputs, like fertilizers, farm equipment, and pesticides are harder to afford, GM crops have more to offer. That can help increase food, reduce pressure on deforestation, and lift farmers out of poverty.   I definitely mispoke when I said that they have been a leading factor for solving world hunger. I more or less meant that the evidence is very promising."
Debate,2hzorq,foxfact,1 point,Sat Oct 4 18:46:27 2014 UTC,"Oh, totally I understand the potential for increase in yields. I'm not debating the effectiveness of GMOs, I am saying though that it needs to be looked at in the context of how that effectiveness is brought about. Right, so con needs some sort of ground to say that pro's benefits are negligible. Your India example is what I'm talking about. Even though there's yield increases, farmers are committing suicide and put into a cycle of dependency on Monsanto that they can't get out of."

Your framework should tell me how to evaluate the round, so it should include a weighing mechanism.  If you tell me how to evaluate the round, then there is no chance I have to intervene.  More broadly, just weigh.  Don't just refute the warrants and logic of the other team's arguments (though you must do that), and don't just extend your own (though you must do that as well).

Debate,2hwe73,jfar0615,5,Tue Sep 30 22:38:32 2014 UTC,"I don't know how much luck has to do with it, but I know that any debater should be able to win a round in front of a ""lay"" judge even without ""luck.""  Think about it this way: if debaters can communicate only with those within the debate community, what good is the activity?  In terms of specifics, be sure you slow down and actually vary your tone.  ""Lay"" judges often judge off more than just the flow, so being persuasive and delivering your speech well can be more important in these rounds (though it is important in any round, to varying degrees).  Analytically, be as clear as possible.  Don't use jargon, and be sure that you are explaining everything--don't let evidence speak for itself, and don't assume that the judge can infer exactly how your evidence leads to your impact or how your evidence ties back to your claim.  These are things you should be doing in any round, but they are especially important in lay rounds.  Also, I put the word ""lay"" in air quotes because I think the term is often used negatively/implies that communication in debate is somehow part of another communicative world--ideally, this shouldn't be as true as it is."

Debate,2hwe73,treknotechno,2,Wed Oct 1 00:25:23 2014 UTC,"I have a question about counter plans in LD. For the current topic about organ procurement, I would like to run a counter plan talking about a better method than presumed consent for taking organs. Even if I show a better alternative as neg, wouldn't the aff still win because all they need to do is say presumed consent is moral, or would I be able to win because i am ""more moral ""? In regards to something being moral (basically every LD topic), I don't see how a counter plan would win because it wouldn't directly state the aff is immoral, only show a better system. Could you please clarify how to win with a counter plan in LD? Sorry if this question makes no sense"
Debate,2hwe73,sherryyfengg,2,Tue Sep 30 22:57:11 2014 UTC,"LD is not always a debate about morals.  LD is (usually) a debate about values, and morality is one of those values.  So you'll have a value--which could be morality, justice, or something else--and a standard for achieving that value.  That's your framework.  With a counter plan under that framework, there are a couple of ways to win a round in a substantive debate on the topic.  First, you prove that your framework is better than the other debater's (i.e. you're winning the framework debate).  That means that your framework determines how we weigh the round.  If your counterplan links into your framework (and your opponent's contention-level arguments don't link into your framework/are effectively refuted), then you're golden.  You could also link you're counterplan into your opponent's framework by saying that, in addition to achieving the value under your standard, your counterplan does a better job of achieving your opponent's value and standard than his/her own contention-level/substantive arguments.  The short answer is that it isn't always about morality."

Debate,2hwe73,FiReDebate,1 point,Tue Sep 30 23:35:23 2014 UTC,"Wow, lots of questions!    When I was competing, I was really an analysis debater.  I cared much more about the argument than the delivery.  Since I've started judging PF, LD, and Congress, though, I've realized that Congress' uniqueness comes largely from the fact that it forces students to both speak well AND analyze well.  So I try to weigh both evenly when I'm judging.  I will say, though, that major analytical gaps can hurt you more when I'm judging than issues with delivery.  Along the same lines, the best Congressional debaters had strong, impact-level analysis combined with the ability to captivate and audience.  In any event, I really don't like rudeness or lack of respect for opponents or judges (but I love sarcasm, so it's a fine line!).  In terms of arguments, I take pretty significant issue with debaters' buying into dominant discourse or using that discourse without explaining it.  So if you frame an impact in a way that assumes that Islam is an inherent security threat, or talk about ""radical Islam"" without telling me what that means, I'm not going to be happy.  Be more specific and don't assume that the American news media always uses terms correctly.  With regards to my novices… it depends on the tournament and the novice.  I can't remember what I said to the last novice nor can I predict what I will say to my novices before the first tournament this year.  My advice here would be to coach in the moment."

It helps to jog my memory when I glance down at my flow to ask a question. Especially for newer debaters, I like to write out some questions that could come up before any tournaments.

It includes the components of an argument such as a main contention, premises, co-premises, objections, rebuttals, and lemmas. Typically an argument map is a “box and arrow” diagram with boxes corresponding to propositions and arrows corresponding to relationships such as evidential support.  Argument maps are commonly used in the context of teaching and applying critical thinking.  [page needed] The purpose of mapping is to uncover the logical structure of arguments, identify unstated assumptions, evaluate the support an argument offers for a conclusion, and aid understanding of debates. Argument maps are often designed to support deliberation of issues, ideas and arguments in wicked problems.  An argument map is not to be confused with a concept map or a mind map, which are less strict in relating claims.    Image i - An argument map.

Spreading has almost no utility as a speaking style outside of a debate round.  But debate judging is a skill. The value of that skill is learning to set aside personal ideologies, and decide a round based on the issues that were presented by the debaters. Too many lay judges can't or won't do that, and  wind up making decisions which appear random to the competitors. Certainly experienced debate judges aren't perfect.  But the power of debate is empowerment. I have seen young person after young person get excited about the opportunity to run unconventional arguments and experiment with ideas which lay judges would reject out of hand.

Parli is being treated as the red-headed step child event at the Jack Howe so to speak.   You guys are going to have to debate out on the grass on tables. And I assume they are only going to be giving you guys parent judges as the flow judges will be given first to varsity policy and LD.   That being said. A lot of the Orange county and LA area schools debate like this. This is how I tell my students to debate Parli. Dunno what area you are from. CBSR?   So for a Policy case on the Aff you want to spend a minute or less on your top of case, definitions, setting net bens and all that, and then a minute on plan reading the mandate, agents, funding and time frame with the rest of your time being spent on advantages. That's how I teach it at least. The Aff has a burden to provide a plan that solves for harms in the Squo. So you need to make sure that you have time for your Advantages or Harms and Solvency points. Depending on how your structure your case.   The Negative can run T, but a T should take like 45 seconds to read. You shouldn't spend more than a minute on it. Not even reading fast. But there are so many other things to run like DA's and Counter Plans. You can run vagueness spec, a/e/f-spec.   Yea the guys in the video are great debaters but they are debating in front of judges that are college level Parli Debaters. Remember this is the first tournament of the year, people are rusty, and you will probably be in front of a parent judge. So don't try to go too fast. Make arguments that are logical, and stay structured. I would advise against spending a ton of time on T on the Neg. I would advise that anyways.

That's way too short to establish for a parent judge the standards and voters. I would spend around 1:30 to 2:00 in front of a lay judge. Most of these parents are watching their first round, ever.

Debate,2h5gns,sick_burn_bro,3,Mon Sep 22 19:30:26 2014 UTC,"In terms of vegetarianism and luxury products the logic is only really bad in so far as it is incomplete. Basically the logic trying to be employed is ""you have claimed that if something is produced unethically then at is sufficient reason to not consume it. Yet there are other products that are produced unethically that you consume."" What is missing from that logic is the implied conclusion ""therefore unethical production would seem insufficient in determining not to consume a product. We instead make a judgement on how harmful the production is versus the inconvenience to us of giving up that product."" Strategically this is really useful in a debate where one side is claiming a certain principle, and the other wants to move the debate onto practical grounds. Once that shift has happened the debate becomes a lot easier for an anti-vegetarian team to win. They show they are not required to prove animals don't suffer, just that the inconvenience to people is enough to warrant that suffering. Just to clarify here, in informal contexts this may well be a fallacy, but in a debate where one team is required to defend a principally consistent position, it can be an important tactic. Real people don't have to be consistent, the lucky bastards.   As for the ""why do you focus on this issue when more demanding issues are present"" thing, that only works when the other side can demonstrate that attempting to solve one problem would sufficiently worsen the other more serious problem. Otherwise the logic is ""we must identify the most harmful thing in the world. No other problems may be thought about until that problem is solved."" That logic is crazy debaterland bullshit that is obviously stupid. Problem solving resources are not zero-sum, having a functioning, happy and prosperous society makes it easier to solve other problems and resources for one problem are not necessarily what is needed to solve another.

I'll admit I'm the first one to rat out to coaches if a student is being rude, but I think being rude is like saying something sexist, or calling the other debater an idiot or stupid in round. Or like this one kid who timed his opponent with a timer that announced very loudly every minute that had passed. That stuff is rude and uncalled for. But unless it was really bad I wouldn't vote on it, but they would take a sharp hit to speaks.  Imo try to strike her as a judge or tell your coach to tell tournament admin that they shouldn't let her judge you anymore. She was out of line with her comments and if I was you coach I would have had words with her and probably asked she be removed from the judging pool. These things shouldn't make you lose rounds."

I think the whole ""or nawwww"" thing is something that contributed a lot to it because it seems like you aren't serious about speech. I don't think the ""or nawwwwww"" was professional but the good thing is that that's an easy fix to a reason you might have lost.

Debate,2h25pr,cookimonster,1 point,Sun Sep 21 20:06:44 2014 UTC,"That judge sounds awful. It's super common, especially on the national circuit or at large tournaments like nationals, for debaters to tell the judge how to vote or what to do. Any judge that minds you saying things like ""make sure you flow this"" is controlling and completely out of sync with the norms of debate. Remember, you picked up the habit of saying that from an extremely successful debater who obviously didn't run into any problems saying that. However, you probably should drop the ""or naww"" thing. Some judges might laugh at it, but no judge will ever vote for you because of a joke. However, there are judges (like this one!) who will drop you for it.   If you really did act normally in that round, it just indicates that the judge had a problem. It's really unlikely that every other judge you've had this year was an idiot and this judge was the only one who was able to see you for who you are. Most likely, that judge was either crazy or (much more likely) having a really awful day."

You may only speak to your partner, may only write your case on the flow paper you are given, you may have a laptop to prep, but it cannot be connected to the internet, and you may not charge it while you are in prep.

If you can control first crossfire respectably and take apart the opponent's case it is really hard to come back. With limited time to speak, it's kinda about momentum.  Make sure you have 3 copies of your cases and (if either of you are clumsy) two copies of your evidence.  General rules of thumb (for Northwestern circuits): *2 minutes of downtime available per team *First speech is all new arguments and typically has no refutations *Second speech is where you bring in new arguments and refutations *Third speech it is considered unprofessional to bring in new arguments. New evidence is fine. *Fourth speech is final focus. No new arguments or evidence allowed. Tell the judge why you won"

Debate,2go78m,mjr1234,8,Wed Sep 17 16:24:03 2014 UTC,"I think the central question here is whether or not you want to consistently push your rounds toward discussion of abuse over discussion of issues. As an opportunity for generic arguments (educational value of round harmed, for example), will this case be the most fun? Winning and losing aside, will you actually learn more or less from it?  Also, I refuse to believe that there's no other way to argue any case. I imagine your potential for abuse rests on some squirrely definitions, and there are other ways to approach a contested definition than abuse."

Debate,2go78m,Anaphoric,0,Wed Sep 17 21:08:36 2014 UTC,"Education is blocked already, this message still addresses the topic in full. In addition to that knowledge, the other debater learns more about debate. I may even pair it with the odd argument:  My opponent, in promoting education as a voter, WANTS and NEEDS to lose. A debater that wins will not learn as much as one that loses, because losing drives the competitor to get better. So my opponent learns, and will try to get better, whereas I will only learn. No one loses, but if he/she loses, by their own standard, they actually WIN. :0"
Debate,2go78m,confetti27,3,Wed Sep 17 21:11:08 2014 UTC,"I understand that you can block out a response and that learning technique of debate may be important, but you aren't really addressing my question. Will you learn more, mostly from a content perspective (not about theory of debate itself)? Do you think the rounds likely to ensue would be the most enjoyable possible for you?  Alfie Kohn in his book No Contest outlines a compelling argument for why competition is just plain bad, so your 'defeat leads to increased motivation' isn't a given. As a coach and a judge, I can say that your simplification of the educational value of debate to a zero-sum game troubles me.  I can't weigh in on the possibility of a contested definition since you're not releasing specifics, but you have me very curious. I'm currently unaffiliated with any team with no plans to either coach or judge this coming season. Would you be willing to share your thoughts with me in a personal message?"

The best strategy is to pepper them with these so that you can quickly get them off-topic by answering your question and they'll miss the main points of their speech.

They are expected to (depending on the circuit) take 1-2, but you don't get to constantly force questions on them.  Often poor/inexperienced debaters take many POIs. Don't do this, it's usually better to just sit down if you have nothing to say or pause and collect your thoughts if you have nothing to say at that moment/have lost yourself in your notes.

Debate,2gbxbs,Harportcw,12,Sun Sep 14 00:16:01 2014 UTC,"Argument From Fallacy Fallacy. This fallacy occurs when you assume that because an argument is put forth in a fallacious manner, it must be wrong.   Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_fallacy"
Debate,2gbxbs,mjr1234,3,Sun Sep 14 00:36:07 2014 UTC,"Argument from fallacy:       Argument from fallacy is the formal fallacy of analyzing an argument and inferring that, since it contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be false.  It is also called argument to logic (argumentum ad logicam), fallacy fallacy,  fallacist's fallacy,  and bad reasons fallacy.   Fallacious arguments can arrive at true conclusions, so this is an informal fallacy of relevance.

Debate,2gbxbs,PQie,1 point,Sun Sep 14 01:13:03 2014 UTC,"to be fair, the argument IS wrong. It's just that the conclusion may be true, but isn't backed up by a valid argumentation.  Pointing a fallacy IS debating. You're not avoiding anything. Finding a fallacy is refuting an argument (not necessary a conclusion), and it means that the ball is sent back into the argumenter's camp."
Debate,2gbxbs,confetti27,2,Wed Sep 17 14:20:19 2014 UTC,"Closest thing I can think of to what you described is a red herring.

Debate,2gbxbs,ralph-j,2,Sun Sep 14 00:30:30 2014 UTC,"In a true debate, one that isn't governed completely by laziness and intellectual dishonesty, employing a fallacy is insufficient to be convincing. One ought to fully explain how an opponent's argument constitutes a failure logically, and/or present some kind of brilliant analogy to further the point.    tl;dr crying fallacy is like a mechanic saying an engine's making a noise like something isn't right. beware comments like this from non-mechanics."

Debate,2ftdld,mjr1234,10,Mon Sep 8 15:45:09 2014 UTC,"I honestly think it's 50-50. Or even 60-40 in favor of preparation. I'm an excellent debater, but if I don't understand the entire topic inside and out, my skills are nothing more than confident delivery of my assumption of the facts. My assumption could be correct, or it could be totally off and ridiculous. Either way, the safest bet is to have all the facts at hand and prepared. I used to be a poor debater at first; nervous, no eye contact and I'd speak way too quickly, but I still went 5-0 my first year of debate because I had every corner of the topic at hand covered and memorized. I had an excellent rebuttal for absolutely anything my opposition said. Now, I've fixed my speech, posture and confidence, but I still prepare with the same due diligence as when I was weak.  Preparation is absolutely key for debate, especially if the judges, or your opposition, know the facts or have prepared better than you have.  Edit: ""Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard"""
Debate,2ftdld,Atallahnator,3,Mon Sep 8 16:33:15 2014 UTC,"Depends on the debaters and the topic. In PF, I did hardly any prep out of round and enjoyed lots of success because our rebuttal speech was normally designed to move the debate away from statistics comparison and towards either an examination of their stats or a debate of ideas. It's my understanding this is less possible in policy and LD, and it's not possible with some PF topics (most foreign policy ones, for example are just cost vrs benefit and here you always needs lots of stats and cards)."
Debate,2ftdld,iKnife,2,Mon Sep 8 17:41:38 2014 UTC,"In policy at least, you can get away with writing blocks and extensions well into the rebuttals which can definitely help people improve on their skills in areas where they may have otherwise been weaker like delivery, strategy, etc."
Debate,2ftdld,ribwomberly,2,Mon Sep 8 16:00:07 2014 UTC,"It's obviously hard to quantify, but I agree with the spirit of your coach's view. It's hard to attribute any success to ""talent"" or ""critical thinking skills"" independent of hard work because those things must be developed, and preparing for debates is a very good way (but not the only way) to develop them."
Debate,2ftdld,bakeryjake,2,Mon Sep 8 18:30:44 2014 UTC,"I tell the kids I help this: 1. A strong case means everything, so work on that and learn the evidence. 2.

Debate,2ftdld,Clusterfist,3,Tue Sep 9 22:39:38 2014 UTC,"Why should debaters rely on others' prep rather than establishing good research habits and skills for themselves? Do you recommend reading other debaters' theory blocks in round, too?"
Debate,2ftdld,dancon25,1 point,Mon Sep 8 22:06:24 2014 UTC,"If you're prepared and don't screw up, you should win. If you don't win, you screwed up or didn't prepare enough or didn't prepare correctly. Tournaments are won before the tournament begins, and your coach is right to tell you that.   Preparation isn't just card-cutting, but it also includes familiarizing yourself with your arguments for better rebuttals, thinking about debate theory and debate situations constantly, honing a sharp sense of strategic vision, practicing spreading, speaking, and flowing, and dedication to making your rebuttals faster, more efficient, and mute strategic.  Competitive debate is an art that takes a lot of work - as clever as you might end up in some rounds, and as crucial as it is to be able to adapt to unforeseen arguments and situations, it's all in your commitment to making yourself a strong debater."

I've never sped/spread. (However, just because they don't need it doesn't mean they don't do it. Good debaters can spread, but in my mind they shouldn't feel forced to to be competitive).

My partner and I refute that with mounds of evidence against their claims and tell the judge there's no link.   The judge buys their arguments even though the flow shows my team to win.

The judge is a couple moments away from giving the win to the other team - I burst into the room, and don't even go to my table - i start speaking (coat, backpack, everything).

Additionally, he had a box that was OVERFLOWING with colored pencils. Not sure why he had them.   So the round starts (He was on neg and didn't have a case for some reason... it was strange) and he's stuttering and sweating through his speeches. He kept saying ""contigion"" instead of ""contention"". I am physically cringing. After what seemed like an eternity, the round ended and I went in for the handshake.  Huge mistake.  So back to the box filled with colored pencils. He stood up for the handshake while closing the lid, which closed on his tie. The box flipped over. Colored pencils freaking EVERYWHERE.

Freshman year:  -My partner and I lost a round because my partner's suit jacket didn't match his dress pants (at least that all the judge's flow said and our opponents agreed that we won).   -(China topic) Our opponents say that jobs going from China to the US is a harm. We explain how it is, in fact, a benefit to the US (we were aff). Our judge votes against us saying ""PRO, you can't draw benefits from both sides of an argument. If jobs go back to US from China, you lose.""  Sophomore year:  -Judge says that our contentions flowed through and opponents' did not. Then proceeds to say that my partner was being a ""douche"" when he kept opponents' evidence to cite in his final focus. Votes for other team because they were ""nice""  -(Single gender classrooms topic) We're neg and we cite a study showing no benefits. Opponents proceed to attack that by saying it doesn't separate external variables. We say it does, quote from the study, and offer to show the judge the evidence if he doesn't believe us. Opponents cite Leonard Sax, we call him out as a biased source. Round ends, we thought we did pretty well. Judge says he voted for Aff. We're disappointed but accept that we lost. Then judge begins his RFD. (to us) ""I know your study and I know that it doesn't take into account external variables"". We offer to show him where it says it does. Judge refuses to see evidence claiming that he ""already knows all of it"" Then, he goes onto Leonard Sax. ""I don't know, this Leonard Sax guy really seems like a nice guy in my opinion. I've done some prior research and I thought what he said makes sense"".  What I'm thinking: wtf you literally just ignored the entire debate and judged based on your own opinions.

Debate,2euhhz,AmazingZebra,12,Thu Aug 28 20:39:19 2014 UTC,"Exactly. I can't stand it when PF teams spread, even on the national circuit. The reason they invented PF was to have a form of debate that the normal, everyday person could watch and understand. We don't all have to act like we're policy!"

Debate,2euhhz,llamalord,1 point,Thu Aug 28 20:31:25 2014 UTC,It might not since it is an event that is only done by High School Debaters atm. But if it ever gets picked up by college teams as a new event it's doomed.
Debate,2euhhz,KingOfSockPuppets,4,Sat Aug 30 19:17:49 2014 UTC,"? There are college public forum teams and competitions. Even so I don't think PF will move to a 'true spread' unless the number of professional judges far outweigh the number of 'average on the street people' judges. Spreading can only thrive in an elite environment where the judges understand and are willing to vote for arguments at that speed. If pofo never makes such a change, I find it extremely unlikely that spreading will 'catch on' in pofo."
Debate,2euhhz,llamalord,2,Thu Aug 28 20:43:13 2014 UTC,I have never heard of one. What are a few that do have it as an event? A college team I work with tried to host one to see if they could get any interest at all and they got no one and were told they wasted their time and money and should have ran a parli tournament instead. So it is a shock to me that there are any college level pf tournaments.  Edit: I looked it up and found around 4 colleges that do pf. Odd.

Debate,2eq6gw,Diabeatnik,10,Wed Aug 27 14:20:56 2014 UTC,"Lots of this debate is devolving into hissy fits and assertions on both sides, so lets take a step back and look the issue. To discuss the role of spreading in LD, we need to identify and acknowledge the unique education benefits provided by progressive and traditional LD.   Progressive/Fast LD: The biggest impact that spreading has on a debate round is that it allows for more arguments to be introduced and for arguments to be explored in greater depth. There several reasons why this is education.    It's been said before and better, but the critical thinking benefits of progressive debate are enormous. If your opponent spreads a complex 2400 word AC, you have to a) process a vast amount of complicated arguments almost instantly b) Understand not only the content of each argument, but also its function in the case. That means knowing how it relates to and supports the arguments around it and what the implication of the argument would be if you dropped it c) Think of how the affirmatives argument interacts with negative positions that you want to run and d) Think of answers to the aff that are independent of any negative position you are going to read. Being able to do all of this well is unbelievable difficult and equally rewarding to learn Progressive debate encourages a deeper study of argumentation. Going fast lets debaters add more warrants to their arguments, spend more time dissecting the arguments that their opponent makes and ultimately spend more time explaining their positions. This both allows for more advanced arguments to be made in round and allows for a deeper discussion of some issues.  The greater variety and depth of argumentation that spreading allows  for dramatically increases research burdens. Doing academic research out of round is arguably the most educational aspect of debate because it both teaches debaters to be able to quickly learn a great deal about any given issue (a skill that extends far beyond debate) and also brings debaters into contact with a large amount of academic literature, which in turn teaches them more than any class could hope to.    Traditional LD: Emphasizes clear communication of an advocacy. People who are successful at NCFL/NSDA nationals and on traditional circuits write very intuitive cases and then holistically explain why their position to superior to their opponent's. Success in traditional LD requires explaining complex ideas in simple terms.   Now lets look at why progressive debate is at least a viable alternative to traditional LD. I'll start by addressing some of the arguments against spreading that OP has made in the thread description and comments.    Saying LD is a ""values debate"" misunderstands and exaggerates the difference between traditional and progressive LD. At its core, debating values means evaluating a normative statement (the resolution) through a specific ethical framework. Traditional and progressive cases typically have a similar structure: A framework that establishes what it means to be ought/just in the context of the resolution, and then offense that explains how affirming/negating best meets that normative framework. Some policy type arguments are a little different, but I'll explain why that doesn't matter in a minute. In a lot of ways, progressive debate does this better than traditional. My local circuit is extremely traditional, and a lot of frameworks go something like ""I value justice because it has a strong link to the resolution. My value criterion is reducing poverty because it's unjust for some people to have more money than others"" followed by several PF style contentions about how affirming reduces poverty. I've heard that framework verbatim at least once, and similarly unwarranted frameworks are commonplace. On the circuit, debaters have to justify normative claims. A common circuit framework is based on John Rawls' concept of distributive justice. It says the same thing as the traditional framework (poverty is unfair and bad), but does it through a deep understanding of modern political philosophy, not two seconds of assertions.  What does a values debate even mean? When people talk about how LD should be a values debate, they never define what it really means to debate values or why there is any educational value to debating values. Most of the ""values"" debates that I've seen come down to dueling assertion about which broad and underdeveloped value comes first.  OP says that progressive debate only turns that activity into a speed contest. That is simply not true - the people who truly dominate the national circuit usually aren't the fastest: their the ones who are the best debaters. That means making good, strategic arguments, having good issue selection, and being able to effectively advocate for why a position is preferable to the alternative. While debaters who spread don't get as much practice in a certain style of public speaking, they make up for it in understanding of argumentation. Finally, it is much easier to learn to adapt to traditional debate. While the national circuit doesn't dominate NSDA/NCFL nationals, there are always circuit debaters who do really well at those tournaments. Both NCFL finalists were from circuit schools, as was debater who finished 3rd at NSDA nationals. Last year the national runner up was also a finalist at the TOC. In fact, 4 of the last 8 national champions have been from circuit/progressive schools. The reason for this is that these debaters developed a deep understanding of debate and argumentation through national circuit debate and then learned how to adapt that to a less debate savvy audience.  Finally, you assert that spreading is not understandable to most people. While this is true, there are very few, if any, people who cannot learn. Spreading has been around for over three decades, and in that time it has been mastered by tens of thousands of students. I've met people who were willing to put in the time to learn, but I've never met someone who put in the time and couldn't.    I'm not saying that all LD should be progressive. I just want to show that there are benefits to both traditional and progressive LD. Both help educate students. Some debaters might prefer one over the other for any number of reasons, and that's completely okay. Both traditional and progressive LD have a right to exist, and both should."
Debate,2eq6gw,cookimonster,6,Thu Aug 28 00:13:18 2014 UTC,In real life there aren't 5 speeches and aren't time limits.  Speed is a good tool to increase depth in argumentation.  It is depth that in general rewarded - which IMO is a good thing. (depth over breadth yo!)
Debate,2eq6gw,backcountryguy,-3,Wed Aug 27 17:34:54 2014 UTC,"Part of being a skilled debater is being able to explain arguments in the given time as effectively as possible. And in real life debates, there definitely are time constraints. Your ""sink or swim"" mentality is exactly the problem. Spreading should make you sink."
Debate,2eq6gw,fleamarketninja,4,Wed Aug 27 18:52:04 2014 UTC,I think what you are not understanding is that debate isn't a hobby that's primary goal is to go argue with people outside of debate rounds. Like the point of debate is not to go beat other people in spontaneous debates.  The point is to learn information on important current events in an interactive medium (debate). Fairness and education >>> speaker skills.
Debate,2eq6gw,fleamarketninja,-1,Wed Aug 27 23:30:20 2014 UTC,how does spreading make it MORE fair?
Debate,2eq6gw,fleamarketninja,3,Wed Aug 27 23:33:03 2014 UTC,Spreading allows both sides to use their time strategically and optimize answers to. Both the aff and neg are helped with spreading and neither side gleems an advantage.
Debate,2eq6gw,fleamarketninja,-1,Wed Aug 27 23:44:00 2014 UTC,Can't we use our time strategically without spreading?
Debate,2eq6gw,fleamarketninja,6,Wed Aug 27 23:45:54 2014 UTC,Yes you can. Which is why we see stylistic matchups. It's not uncommon to see a slower speaker beat a faster speaker or vice versa. They can co exist.
Debate,2eq6gw,fleamarketninja,1 point,Wed Aug 27 23:49:04 2014 UTC,Fair enough. Thanks for not being an asshole about it.
Debate,2eq6gw,fleamarketninja,2,Wed Aug 27 23:56:44 2014 UTC,What's the point of sitting on this subreddit and talking to people about debate if our goal isn't to improve the debate community? Seems silly. However I do encourage you to read up on debate theory. It will make your slower style much stronger when against spreading.
Debate,2eq6gw,asthedrivensnow,7,Wed Aug 27 23:59:31 2014 UTC,"When I began judging LD I too felt that spreading was a manipulative tactic and purely a competitive tool, HOWEVER with more exposure to it I can now make a very strong argument proving that it improves the rounds educational value immensely.    With more speed deeper argumentation can take place. It allows more literature to be brought up and more information to be given. I promotes more critical thinking. You are forced to think about which of your opponents arguments are stronger or weaker and hammer on the appropriate option rather then going with a wide scattered counter attack. It promotes the idea of grouping! Grouping requires more critical thinking, because it forces you to think outside of the box on how you can answer more then one of your opponents arguments at once. This can also be applied to a case turn.   Don't confuse bad rounds that use spreading unconstructively with spreading in general. Your problem should be with people not with techniques. The core of the issue is that the debates that you are seeing are not trying to learn or be fair but rather use tools to win. It's very easy to answer this style with theory cards and restore balance."
Debate,2eq6gw,asthedrivensnow,-1,Wed Aug 27 17:20:49 2014 UTC,"Spreading is not a realistically effective way to communicate, and building communication skills ought to be our prime goal. Also, the depth of the argument is damaged by 1.) People not hearing points and 2.) Scrambling to keep up with a wall of arguments. Part of being a debater is being able to explain things well in a short amount of time, and spreading is a cheap shortcut that we reward by supporting."
Debate,2eq6gw,yazhao,3,Wed Aug 27 18:49:53 2014 UTC,"In regards to your points 1 and 2. It sounds to me like you can't keep up and you're getting frustrated with spreading and blaming it for problems. It adds a bit of a learning curve, but once you pick up on it you don't miss much of anything... the point of ld is to win the value criterion debate. The built in frame work is fairness and education. Education and fairness highly out weigh minor improvements to persuasive speaking. I also disagree that you can't practice persuasive speaking partnered with spreading. Faster does not mean worse quality to trained spreaders."
Debate,2eq6gw,yazhao,-2,Wed Aug 27 19:46:53 2014 UTC,"You're right, people who are trained spreaders don't have issues.

Debate,2eq6gw,llamalord,1 point,Wed Aug 27 19:45:20 2014 UTC,I'm talking about the kind of spreading that you have to be trained to understand
Debate,2eq6gw,llamalord,3,Wed Aug 27 20:02:29 2014 UTC,All of debate is something you have to be trained to understand. Non-debaters almost always need training to become good debaters. Why should speaking be any different?
Debate,2eq6gw,llamalord,2,Wed Aug 27 20:04:31 2014 UTC,I really disagree with the notion that you have to be trained to understand all types of debate. PF utilizes lay judges most of the time if I'm not mistaken. A lot of regional styles of debate use lay judges. It works out fine.

I did PF a little in high school (2004-2008), and PF was still a young activity where anything went. But by the time I came back to judge in 2011, it already was trending towards more research and speed, with judges who had done PF (I think the one exception is the TOC, which from PFers I knew younger than me, was hated for using lay judges since to qualify from the big national tournaments you needed to be more ""circuit"" to get your birds).     And the point is that it doesn't ""work out fine."" I did primarily regional debating in front of lay judges. I've done debate in college in front of lay judges. They are on average the worst judges, not because they aren't intelligent, but because they didn't understand how competitive debate (in any format) ultimately worked. In the worst cases, I had one judge who voted for me solely because I looked and spoke more confidently than the debater I was facing, with literally zero evaluation of any arguments made, and I've won a round because my opponent's accent made him less understandable. Generally though, here are the biggest problems I've found with lay judges:   They don't understand the concept of the flow. You might say ""so what?"" but the flow is important to any debate format. I've coached debaters, and the hardest part of any new person I've coached is to help them understand how note taking via the flow is different. People have a natural tendency to treat everything as if they're taking notes in a meeting or a lecture, but in debate this leads them to not be able to delineate the chain of argument/response/response that generally happens. This means that to lay judges, everything that's said in the round are just floating arguments. Laying aside the fact that this can lead to abuse when debaters introduce entirely new arguments in their last speech, it generally leads to less evaluation because a judge basically just waits until she hears the argument she wants rather than going through any kind of general voting structure (like the value debate in LD, or just burdens or criteria in general). Lay judges have a much harder time with avoiding prejudgment. In high school debate, this means they're not tabula rasa, which effectively kills a lot of solid argumentation. Being able not to prejudge arguments is a skill that you learn as a judge, and it's not easy. Lay judges, like most normal people, will often walk into a tournament telling themselves to not do this, but it's an unconscious bias that takes time and training to overcome. Lay judges are more likely to reject arguments they personally disagree with than to try and evaluate arguments more on their own merits, or at the very least are much less forthcoming about their flaws in this regard.     Look, this isn't an attack on lay judges per se, but rather an acknowledgement that it does take effort and work to become an actual good judge. The idea that using lay judges turns out fine, rather than the reality being that using and training lay judges is a necessity due to lack of other options, is being just a bit unfair to the debaters who put in a lot of time and work outside of their classes to dedicate their weekends to such an activity. I've always appreciated the contribution of lay judges to making sure debate even exists as an activity, but I would be remiss in saying that merely being a lay judge is adequate. Debate is so much more than just adapting what you can say to any audience: the entire premise behind that supposed skill is that you need to develop a more complex understanding first that you can adapt. The primary goal of debate (especially LD) is the intellectual training, learning how to do research, and formulating complex arguments. Adaptation is secondary."
Debate,2eq6gw,llamalord,0,Sun Aug 31 17:00:41 2014 UTC,"Because it promotes poor presentation technique and turns the round into a giant clusterfuck of arguments just so a few people can get a leg up. If you don't have the skill to get points across at an undestandable rate, then you need to work on that rather than sacrifice the value of presentation."
Debate,2eq6gw,llamalord,2,Wed Aug 27 20:47:42 2014 UTC,"I don't think you understand: In college I was part of a league where people spoke at an ""understandable rate"" (a highly subjective term) and a lot of them came from spreading backgrounds. Speaking at the rate of a normal conversation is not a ""skill."" Being able to compact more arguments into the same amount of time is: that's what spreading teaches. Slow down a spread debater, tell her she needs to go at a ""normal"" speed, and they will still be able to put more arguments into the same amount of time relative to an average person. That comes from spreading, because it's not the ""talking fast"" part that's important, but rather the thinking fast enough to catch up with your speaking."

Debate,2eq6gw,InsertCookieHere,-1,Wed Aug 27 23:21:26 2014 UTC,I'm not saying you shouldn't compact your arguments. It's easier to learn that skill without spreading.
Debate,2eq6gw,fleamarketninja,3,Wed Aug 27 21:33:55 2014 UTC,"Spreading is ultimately just compacting arguments. Learning to do that requires fast thinking, which is easier to do when you can spread."

Debate,2eo24v,killerhornet25,2,Wed Aug 27 05:34:50 2014 UTC,"I guess this was funny for the opposition and audience but not for me. It was my first debate where you only had 1 hour prep time. I was used to a week to prep my whole speech including writing out most of my rebuttals as well (I know, I know but it worked for me). Anyway, I basically wrote one cue card's worth in that hour and had to make up the rest of the 8 minute speech on the spot. So I ended up repeating things at least twice and then instead of saying 'Edward Snowden', I said 'Jon Snow' and I didn't even notice until everyone was laughing at me. At the end of the debate, the opposition congratulated me on my Game of Thrones reference. It was mortifying then, but now I laugh.  Another time, I was watching this debate, not participating, and the topic was about parents slapping their children. One of the girls was a beginner and announced that slapping your children was okay because her mum slapped her and she turned out just fine. After the debate, the adjudicator pulled her up on this by telling her that the worst case scenario is that the opposition could have have rebutted her anecdote by saying slapping is ridiculous as she didn't turn out fine.  Also, I know it's rude but I cannot help laughing behind my cue cards when I debate against the 'pointers'. You know, the ones that rebut your points by arguing in your face and pointing at you. I'm sure they don't mean to look like that, and aren't aware of it either, but it's just too funny."

All the novices this year will have to begin in the Student Congress Room, where we can effectively teach all of them at once some of the skills necessary for debate/speech. After a few tournaments (2-3), where they have been able to see some events in out-rounds and actually observe how the event it, they will be able to choose what event they want to do. I am expecting some Divergent-like choosing day, but I doubt that will happen. We are approaching it this way this year, because in the past we would have very little novice retainment, usually due to the kids jumping the gun and choosing an event based on ""well the LD room had good food on presentation day... I'll stick here"". Then they find out that they never liked the event to begin with and instead of switching rooms to find another niche, they just drop off.

If they want to do other events, then they're reliant on using graduated members and/or older members of our debate team for extra coaching. It works really well because people know all the nouveau techniques of debate. However, for events like PF and Congress, people are really at a disadvantage in terms of talking eloquently to sway lay judges. (However, talking eloquently is an acquired skill.)   In terms of speech, we don't really focus TOO much on speech. Spend a week going over each type offered in tournaments, then people can choose which events they'd like for each tournament. It's good because you can let people experiment and see what they like and don't like. On the down side, we don't do too well on speech events like DI and HI, but extemp is a really strong point for us.   My school just might be weird."

Debate,2e53i8,7yearsdown,2,Thu Aug 21 02:02:54 2014 UTC,"You're really making two points here. The first is that other media are faster at delivering information and that television's ""main use is to earn money"". The two explicit impacts I'm getting are ""more choice = watch less television"" and ""advertising bad"".   Before I jump into any analysis I'm also going to point out that you haven't defined television, either, which really comes into play with your first argument.   In terms of the choice argument, where you state that we should be decreasing television consumption b/c other media are more timely, I'm not seeing any defense against a perm-esque argument. There's no reason to decrease television consumption based on your first point. I mean, sure, do let's watch more youtube or whatever, but why shouldn't I maintain current consumption levels / increase them? I don't buy it. You also compare television with computers, tablets, phones, and other devices but in my mind this is not a very solid comparison. This is where the definition issue comes in. You talk about television shows, but I can watch television shows on any of your example devices. I can watch Community on a computer as easily as on an LCD (although maybe not any more). This basically makes it very difficult for me to buy your over-arching strategy of going for an opp-cost argument, because I don't see any kind of distinction between television and any of your alternatives. And for impacts I only really get ""choice"" out of it all, which is never fully explained - why is choice good? How is television uniquely limiting?  Your second argument on advertising is not really fully established. You do make a decent argument that advertising is prevalent in television, but the two missing links / ILs in my mind are 1: advertising uniquely present and 2: advertising bad. I understand your link where television isn't the best avenue of information if it's profit driven but this leaves you open to some very easy arguments: 1, why is information the ultimate good considering the majority of the media mentioned serve as entertainment mechanisms (opens you up to easy mitigation with your first ""news-quickly"" argument) and 2, advertising is equally present, if not more so on the internet - Google basically gets ALL its revenue from advertising - and 3, advertising good for consumer / capitalism. There aren't any real impacts that convince me here.  Looking at it on a strategic level, I think it's a bit silly to go for the kind of opportunity cost argument you're making here, where television watching is not as good as a choice as X alternative. The reason is because you don't fully uphold the resolution, which is to actively DECREASE tv consumption, not to demonstrate that tv is not the best option. I would go for unique harms from television and push tv bad, therefore stop watching.  On a tactical level, you're making a lot of assumptions and not fully backing them up. Why is information consumption a good thing? Why is important that I get information as fast as possible? Why should I be watching anything? (You end up arguing that I as TH should watch more computers / phones / tablets which like I said previous not only lacks logic but also gives hella ground to aff.) You also make a bunch of statements and move on without substantiating them, like saying ""How can television be the best way to inform us, if it’s main use is to earn money?"". Give me a warrant, some kind of logic or evidence that tv only benefits advertisers - and again, why is it important that tv provide me with timely info?, etc, etc. And finally, you make lots of tangential points that could be stripped out and let you spend more time on more important points. Taking the previous quoted statement, you talk right before that about ""main themes"" of shows. Are you going for news? Shows? It's really unclear.  Looking at your paragraph (at this point I've written more than that - albeit rather incoherently), my single recommendation for you is to better signpost your content, or at least have some kind of rudimentary organization. Is this a block, a warrant, or an impact? I want to know where what you're telling me goes when you're telling me it and not have to figure out some kind of outline for your speech afterwards. As a judge this pushes me almost off the bat to go for the other team if I understand their arguments better. Make it easier for the judge."

Way I see it, really more of a rebuttal to prop than explaining your side.  Television does not promote active obtaining of USEFUL info - elaborate - give eg, what kind of active learning do you do through other mediums - why is that not present for television? finally, - why should you watch less television because of this passivity of learning?"

I don't know what the schedule would be like at that school, but my team practices four times a week, about an hour-90 min Monday-Thursday. We split the week, two days in speech ad two days upon debate. The different kinds of speech and debate groups separate into different classrooms, and a student captain directs practice/research. Just a few ideas  2) As far as I have ever seen, people can definitely switch events throughout the year. And where I'm from, some people do two speech events at any given tournament along with one debate. I don't know whether that will work at the tournaments you attend.   3) You got me there. I have no suggestions.   4) Fundraise, of course. Maybe charge $10-30 if you feel it would be necessary. You should also think about hosting a tournament at your school. That's the main source of my team's funds: concessions, entry fees, etc.   Good luck"
Debate,2dwujy,jimibabay,4,Mon Aug 18 20:37:24 2014 UTC,"As a way of assessing my credibility, I debated in HS and college, and I was an assistant coach for a high school while I was in college.  1) Twice a week is probably good. If you're going to do 3 you shouldn't do it on the weekends. Kids won't want to commit (and I think justifiably so), they may have other commitments, and once season starts that will be when most of your tournaments are held. More important than number is the quality. Hunt down local college students who used to compete. They can run the training, drills, practice rounds, provide evidence and strategies, and otherwise be a good source of info for your students and you. They will know the circuit and its quirks.  2) i) Your kids should do whatever they're interested in, but be prepared to be a rock when they struggle with doubts, i.e. don't just let them quit an event because they didn't break. Feel out when they actually don't like an event. ii) You can double (even triple) enter at many tournaments, e.g. a speech and a debate event, but it will be very tournament specific because they set the schedule. Call your tournament hosts and see what they do.  3) I would start small for now. 3-4 shouldn't be too bad... in fact I'd say that's not a lot. In HS I went to like 10 tournaments a year, excluding State, Nationals, etc. as they arose.  4) Funding is always a problem. Debate requires money. Travel is obviously huge. Paper, pens, food/snacks, timers, and tournament fees are also a few more costs. You will always need more money. Get it from the school, fundraising, grants, anything you can get your hands on. If you can charge a club fee you should.  Some other thoughts:  A) If you haven't already, you should seriously consider what type of program you want to run. If this is just a fun activity then you should be less intense, e.g. less tournaments, less practice, less travel, etc. If you want to be good then you need to work on developing that base now. Establish a work ethic and expectations, identify and cultivate leaders, find and lock down other coaches, reach out to parents and get them behind you, start making yourself a fun and attractive club because there will be attrition, and be prepared to dedicate a lot of your time to this. You will be spending hours after school, whole Saturdays at tournaments, and lots of emotional energy. In many ways you are becoming a parental/coach figure to these kids and that is not always easy.  B) Keep in mind that debate requires a lot of outside support from parents, etc. Notably, in many circuits, the parents will have to buy suits/dress clothes for their kids. Parents will also have to be able to drop their kids off at the ass-crack of dawn/drive them to tournaments, pick them up after practice, and otherwise be supportive of an activity that they might believe is squandering their children's time as compared to studying or playing a sport. This goes to the money Q, but it also goes the larger context of what you're trying to get off the ground.  C) Make sure to follow-up with other coaches. When you go to tournaments make friends and ask questions. Get coffee/drinks with them. Find college students or alumni of other local debate programs. Your kids will be looking to you to be two steps ahead of them and any problems they have."
Debate,2dwujy,PortableDinosaur,3,Tue Aug 19 00:13:22 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for your response. I'm definitely looking at making this a more serious team. I have an information meeting planned tomorrow that basically states we can't take anyone who can't commit to serious time spent outside of school.   My plan is to charge a small club fee to join (to give us a little capital to start with) and then charge $20-30 a tournament, mostly to pay for entry fees and lodging. I don't think this is unreasonable, especially since I'll have our calendar drawn up within a month and they'll have plenty of advance warning.   And I'm planning on sending out a parent letter and having a parent information meeting after our first month of practice or so."
Debate,2dwujy,SuzyturquoiseBlue,2,Tue Aug 19 04:31:26 2014 UTC,"Hey! This thread has some posts that would answer some questions. After you've read through these, don't hesitate to contact me with further questions and logistical stuff.   Good Luck!"
Debate,2dwujy,SuzyturquoiseBlue,2,Mon Aug 18 20:13:42 2014 UTC,"My school has a class for it but additionally we do have practice nights twice a week.  Other schools in my area vary from group practice twice a week to five times a week.  My coach helps one kid or pair at a time and has whoever else is there practice in another room.  When he isn't there we generally watch each other perform our events then critique each other.  I find this really helpful because it lets me get another perspective from people who may not know the event so well.  No little detail is lost when performing in front of that many people if you're doing something wrong someone will pick up on it.  And don't just critique them, tell them what they are doing well.  Its discouraging to have ten people rip into you about something so my team has a rule that when critiquing you also have to say something nice that they did.  We have parents host the practice night sometimes because we get cookies out of it and also because some of the judges at tournaments are going to be parents that have no idea what they are doing.  So parent opinions on your performance can be very helpful, or well sometimes you should discount them.   2.NO NO NO! Don't limit events at all!!! Debate events are generally a one a tournament kind of thing.  My team requires that you must have one Debate event and at least two speech events to go to a tournament.  Yes they can switch events as often as their heart desires.  They will do better if they pick one event and stick with it though and that is what my coach suggests but they will switch events a lot at first to see what fits.  Now my team actually hates tournament limits on how many events you can enter.  There is at least one kid on my team that is quadruple entered every time they can.  I've only been to a tournament once where I wasn't running from round to round all day. That being said it doesn't work for everyone the kids that pick up four speech events have pretty much devoted their lives to competing. You give up a lot of time for debate and they should understand they need to put in a lot of practice time in for whatever they choose. And should be practicing outside of their time with you.  3.Honestly I have no idea how my coach decides on this.  We did a lot of overnight trips until our funding got cut.  Now he told us we are going to be doing a lot of one day tournaments. (Yuck. They are just really draining.) One day tournaments are cheaper to go to because you don't have to pay for a hotel but they come with some downsides.  One of those being that your kids will be exhausted it takes a lot of effort to do debate one day and then the speech events the next.  One day tournaments just drain me of energy and you don't get the full experience of meeting other people from different schools because you are so busy.  That being said they are also pretty great because then I don't have to be away from home for another day.  since our funding is being cut my coaches have also arranged some things with parents where no one is expected to go but if they want to go their parents will have to take them. We have tournaments scheduled almost every weekend.  Our state has an eight tournament limit but that is still a lot of tournaments to go to.  Four tournaments should be a good starting place.    4.My team charges a one time 50$ club fee.  We used to have to pay 5-20$ every tournament.  So the club fee is cheaper and easier to keep track of who has paid and who hasn't.  Fundraisers help us a lot and after we got established some of the local businesses have started helping us pay for kids to go to nationals.  So yes especially if you don't have funding have the kids pay.  Also we have to bring judges to tournaments otherwise we get charged a fee and the tournament runs much slower than it should.  So make sure to get parents involved bring them as judges.  I cannot stress this enough.  The reason the cheer team gets their bus decorated and they get candy given to them on their trips isn't because they win, they actually lose a lot. Its because their moms know they need to have cheerleaders of their own.  A lot of parents don't realize that we put in as much if not more work and time than football players do. So they don't care to help their kid out.  We actually need help from our parents on this one even if its just them listening to us for ten minutes their encouragement can help a lot.  You can tell which kids have their parents help them because they usually end up going home with trophies.  Debate kids really don't get a lot of recognition.  We are the nerds of the school and we need some recognition for all the hard work we've done, especially if we win. So invite parents to practice nights and to help out with fundraisers.  Parents really are what make or break a fundraiser.  Bake sales, for example, if run right can bring in a lot of cash. You simply can't run a bake sale without having parent involvement.  Well I can go on and on about what makes doing Debate easier for me and out team but I'll just leave it at that.  Please ignore any glaring grammatical mistakes I typed this kind of fast."
Debate,2dwujy,strangestdanger,1 point,Mon Aug 18 20:38:58 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for your input! This was all so helpful.   I'm most worried about parent involvement. My school is very middle class and has some parents who are very involved and some who are pretty absent. Luckily, I do have quite a bit of staff and support from other teachers, so I hope to rely on some of them too.   And unfortunately because of where we are, we'll have to travel, which is why I'm looking at a limited tournament schedule for this first year. There are NO local tournaments, despite being in a midsize city. Almost all of them are 2 hours north."
Debate,2dwujy,strangestdanger,1 point,Tue Aug 19 04:33:47 2014 UTC,Our team is 1-4 hours from any given tournament. We also don't get a lot of parent involvement either. :/ Regardless as long as the kids are willing to work hard I'm sure you'll have a great first year.  :)
Debate,2dwujy,strangestdanger,2,Tue Aug 19 05:18:40 2014 UTC,"I'm also a coach who started a team 3 years ago.   Yes, that is probably plenty of practice time. You should limit the events your first year.  Speech and Congress are easiest to accommodate as a coach (1 judge for 5 participants, usually, vs. 1 judge to 2 students at the local level or 1 judge to 3 students if they are flighting at bigger tournaments).  LD and PF are the most useful from a teachers perspective.  They have nearly all the public speaking value of speech and congress, but they also have the research and argument formation that makes it truly valuable.  However, you can't teach debaters and speechies at the same time, and if the team is new, you won't have any captains to do it for you for at least a couple of years. You should decide the tournament schedule based on what your school will give you for transportation.  You are basically asking them for a favor since you didn't have a budget at budget time.  Unless your medium sized city is particularly wealthy, your competitors probably shouldn't go to tournaments that you have to fly to (I find air travel to reduce the equitable access for some students). You are going to have to charge them.  I would ask your school for transportation and dues to either the National Speech and Debate Organization (formerly the NFL), or the Catholic Forensics League (CFL).  CFL is cheaper, but NFL gives them stickers, and they will love stickers.  If the school won't pay for it, you'll have to charge a club fee.  In addition, there is also a registration fee for every entry at every tournament.  Our state charges $7 a student for every tournament, but the national circuit tournaments can be anywhere from $60-150.  You shouldn't absorb that cost regardless. Parents:  You'll need their parents to help by judging, or you'll have to hire judges, which can be expensive.  I would highly suggest finding any resource that tells how much debate helps acceptance into top tier colleges (the statistic is something like 60% boost from being a debate team captain, 20-30% boost from state or national suggest, compared to 5% for sports team captain, 5% for class president).    Edit:  Someone asked me to find the source for the statistics, and I found it:  http://www.pbs.org/accidentalhero/parents/college.html"
Debate,2dwujy,Corex303,3,Tue Aug 19 03:04:44 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much!  I have another teacher to work with and want all of my kids doing one speech event and one debate event. This way we can have one practice devoted to each and two people for them to rely on. Frankly, I'm not nearly as comfortable with the speech events, but she is and I think that ought to really help us out.   We've decided against policy (for obvious reasons) and Congress because of it's scheduling (we can't get kids to tournaments at 8 AM on Fridays without spending two nights). We also probably wont' do extemp or interps because we don't feel prepared.   We'll mostly be travelling a few hours north. No flying at all, at least for this first year.   I'm planning on a per-tournament charge ($20-30). Is that reasonable? I figure that way they'll have a lot of time to plan on payment and if they miss one, they can make it to the next one. Hopefully after this year, we'll be able to get some funding from the school for travel."
Debate,2dwujy,Jfqian,1 point,Tue Aug 19 04:42:09 2014 UTC,"For the per-tournament charge, is that what the registration fee is?  My debaters would usually pay about 20-30 dollars (7 registration, 5 for lunch, and then we stop for dinner on the way back).  I wish they didn't have to pay this, because I know of at least two students in the last three years that stopped doing debate because it was too expensive.  However, we weren't given a budget for the past three years, either."
Debate,2dwujy,joshsmithld,1 point,Tue Aug 19 10:56:34 2014 UTC,"Registration fees and their ""share"" of a hotel room. We HAVE to stay somewhere just because of how the tournament circuit is in my state."

Debate,2dwujy,Nickerwinjr,1 point,Tue Aug 19 15:03:14 2014 UTC,Could you pm me where you found that statistic?
Debate,2dwujy,Nickerwinjr,1 point,Wed Aug 20 00:30:40 2014 UTC,"A great starting step for a new coach is using resources from the National Speech and Debate Association.  Charging fees will be an issue, since travel will need to happen. Renting a vehicle or having a parent volunteer to drive would be best, and asking for a fee from students before every trip might be the best way to go. Another thing you can do is reach out to alumni of speech high schools or colleges in your area, to ask if they can volunteer some of their time to help coach."

Debate,2dwujy,backcountryguy,1 point,Tue Aug 19 01:25:36 2014 UTC,"1) Practices are a must! At first you may want to have them every day of the week for about a few weeks in order to help all the novices get situated and know what they're doing. After a while when you see that they have a pretty good grasp of things, then I would switch to about twice a week practices in order to polish up their skills and to work on anything you think is necessary.   2) Honestly, this has to be a choice you make. Personally I agree with both sides. I think it's good for a student to be able to choose the event they are in, however, I think it can also be challenging for that student if they sort of have to teach themselves. Unless that student is really dedicated, they won't become successful in events that you are not good at teaching. EX: My HS is prominently composed of speech students. My freshman year (3 years ago), I wanted to do debate however, not many people could help me with it. My coach did the best possible job as well as other members but I can definitely tell you that I was not taught in the same manner as another school that is ""debate oriented"" (ex: I learned what drills were half way through my debate career meanwhile most students are doing drills asap as a novice). However, if you're a lot like my coach and you want your students to succeed no matter what, you will do as my coach has done for me and provide the resources that are necessary for success.   3) Talk to other experienced coaches from your state to help you out with this one.  4) Yes, fees are a great way to raise revenue for the club and also avoid individuals from joining the course/ club just to make themselves seem good on paper. It will probably make it so those who are really interested will be the ones who will pay the fee to join."
Debate,2dwujy,Demonoid_,2,Tue Aug 19 01:31:12 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much! I'm working with another teacher who I think is going to focus more on the speech side of thing, so she'll focus on speech and I'll focus more on debate composition and research. I think we'll balance each other out fairly well."
Debate,2dwujy,finalendpro,1 point,Tue Aug 19 04:35:15 2014 UTC,"1.) Probably, but if your students want to be competitive, highly encourage that they work outside of practice on finding evidence and writing cases.  Practices should be utilized to run practice rounds and drills, as well as to get some quality coaching and critiques. 2.) Generally, one debate and two speech events is allowed per tournament.  I definitely would encourage your kids to do as much as they are willing to do, but not to spread themselves thin; it definitely has to correlate to how much time they devote into preparing for debate. 3.) As many tournaments as possible. 4.) Yes, but don't drive kids away with the price.  It can get very expensive very quickly with cost of travel, evidence briefs, tournament entries, etc.  However, make it clear that fees can be waived in special circumstances, if possible, because it would be unfair that a kid could not debate because they cannot afford it."
Debate,2dwujy,nuggetbasket,1 point,Tue Aug 19 02:43:57 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I'm definitely planning on optional practice days leading up to tournaments, but we probably won't be going anywhere until November.   I'm planning on requiring kids to do one speech event and one debate event, mostly to keep them busy and relatively equally engaged.   I'm trying to keep fees as low as possible, so I'll probably charge a per tournament fee. That way if they can't make it to one, they'll have ample time to save up for the next one. Unfortunately, travel is a necessity for us and we don't yet have the funds to absorb costs for students who can't afford everything. I am considering this for the future."
Debate,2dwujy,cassie1896,1 point,Tue Aug 19 04:37:53 2014 UTC,"I know that our school asks parents to help with travel and it works quite well.  This may not be feasible for all schools, but keeps the cost down for ours significantly."
Debate,2dw09z,anish99,2,Mon Aug 18 14:52:45 2014 UTC,It's a good idea to have a few questions in your mind that are good cf starters - questions that work with almost any round and don't leave you standing there without anything to ask.
Debate,2dw09z,blankenhorn,0,Sat Aug 30 20:48:06 2014 UTC,"As long as you're prepped you have all you need, but in the end, it may come down to the little things. Own crossfire. The strategy I've heard that sounds weird but can work is to interrupt while looking like you were the one who was interrupted, and try to ask questions you know they can't answer without screwing themselves over. After that it's just a matter of word economy, signposting, and pulling the right cards at the right time."
Debate,2dupea,RagingRoosters,10,Mon Aug 18 03:01:40 2014 UTC,"EDIT: We posted on the NSDA/NFL's facebook page about your predicament, here is there response:    National Speech & Debate Association That's so exciting! Looks like he's already set up a membership with our organization. He can always reach out to Matt Delzer, Director of Membership at Matt.Delzer@speechanddebate.org. More importantly, though, he should connect with the district leaders in his area who will have more information about specific tournaments, scheduling, etc. Contact information for district leaders can be found here: http://www.speechanddebate.org/aspx/content.aspx?id=1211   Hello and welcome to the speech and debate community.   If you live in Sonoma County you are part of the California High School Speech Association's (CAHSSA) District 1, GOLDEN GATE SPEECH ASSOCIATION. You can find contact information for the district chair and other leaders here : http://www.cahssa.org/area_information/area_1 . CAHSSA is the organization that oversees many of the ""local"" debate competitions that take place in the state.   Here's a general outline to starting a debate team: http://www.wcdebate.com/4coach/71startteam.htm  I would suggest focusing your resources on mastering Public Forum Debate, a debate event focused on logical arguments, research, and persuasion. This event is one of the easiest to access for those who are new to the activity. There are a lot of free public forum resources online. I will compile them and post them here in a bit.   While working to understand the format of Public Forum Debate, work on securing an adviser for your team. This person is normally a teacher who is willing to let you use their classroom for meetings and practices. The best advisers are those who previously participated in speech and debate, as they will understand the event and will most likely be excited to help you in your pursuits. Advisers are especially important because you will often be required to bring a representative from your school to debate tournaments.   Tournaments: There are two types of tournaments, local tournaments and circuit tournaments. Local tournaments are often hosted by high schools in your area, and competitors will be from surrounding are as most local tournaments restrict attendence to only those in their CHSSA district. In your case, you'll want to tournaments in the Golden Gate Speech Association (GGSA). You can find these tournaments on the website, http://www.joyoftournaments.com/bystate.asp?state=CA .   How do you prepare for tournaments? I'll try to respond to this question tomorrow, but the short of it is that you are given the topic you are debating ahead of time, and you prepare arguments on both sides of that topic before arriving at a competition site. The Public Forum Debate topic for September and October was just released a few days ago, it is Resolved: On balance, public subsidies for professional athletic organizations in the United States benefit their local communities. So for tournaments using this topic you would prepare arguments for both sides, in the format used by the event, before arriving to the tournament. Often times multiple tournaments will use the same topic if they are taking place during the same month.   The second type of tournament is known as a circuit tournament. Circuit tournaments are larger tournaments, often hosted by universities, that draw competitors from across the country which results in tougher competition. Circuit tournaments are often more expensive as they require hotels, transportation, etc. In California, we have a lot of circuit tournaments. The most prominent of which are UC Berkeley, Stanford, Harker, Presentation, and University of the Pacific. Most of these tournaments are in Nor Cal, which is convenient for you. If you can manage it logistically, I would suggest attending the Harker tournament. It's a fairly small tournament, with great food and competition. Most recently they have offered a Novice Workshop, which allows for those who are new to debate to learn and participate in a casual competition. Harker also offers housing and other accommodations that are helpful to those who may not have enough resources to make their own accommodations. You can learn more about the tournament here:https://www.tabroom.com/index/tourn/index.mhtml?tourn_id=2346 . You can also contact the tournament staff with a message on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/HarkerDebateTournament.   I will contact a few other California coaches to see if they have any additional information that could be useful to you. Can you PM or post your email address and I can forward it to those who can help?  Please feel free to let me know if you have any other questions. Debate is a great activity, and we wish you the best of luck in it."
Debate,2dupea,thepublicforum,2,Mon Aug 18 05:29:47 2014 UTC,"This is great, thank you!  I PM'd my email.  A few more questions, if you don't mind:   How can I find more small invitationals like the Harker?  Is there a schedule of circuit tournaments anywhere? What's the difference between joyoftournaments.com and tabroom.com? Why do they list completely different tournaments?"
Debate,2dupea,mistuhgee,3,Mon Aug 18 10:17:50 2014 UTC,"Okay, some more specifics to your situation:  LOGISTICAL ASPECTS  This link from /u/thepublicforum is good.   You need support from your administration. After understanding which format you'll be moving into, getting a good idea of what tournaments you want to go to, how often you'll be doing practices, and getting a good grip on the basics in general, you should go to someone in the administration. This is probably your principal, maybe a teacher responsible for clubs if you have one (maybe not with a school size of ~300). Not only will support from your administration make it easier for you to handle paperwork like liability forms, but you also need the school signing off on your registration for GGSA and CHSSA. You're probably going to be registered officially as a club, which means that you need to find a teacher advisor to sign off on club paperwork. When you talk to teachers, make sure you have a clear list of what you need from them. Do you need to use their room? Do you need them to handle checks for tournament fees and more? Do they need to be there during practices (almost certainly under CA law)?   As with any sport (debate is arguably one), you need to have regular practices. You need something to do at practice, you need somewhere to do it, and you someone to lead it. You can probably find good curriculum out there for whatever format you do, but what you do will change depending on your format.  Budget. Revenue - costs. Costs I can think of off the top of my head include league dues (I believe CHSSA and GGSA waive for first year teams), tournament fees, team fees, transportation, and possibly other resources. Make sure you have an accurate budget.  Recruit. It sounds like you have a great size pool of people, so this isn't as much of an issue. I'd use the suggestions in the link up top.   DEBATE Parli ASPECTS   Choose your format wisely. If you've spent a whole bunch of time learning one format, it's not really a good idea to switch to another one. You obviously can (this will come up in a sec), but there are nuances to each format and different traditions that make it unwise.  Pick parli. My understanding of the state of pufo (maybe limited to CA) is that enrollment has been dropping at both the HS and college level, and that tournaments are being cannibalized by cx and parli competitors. The format is similar enough to both of those that cx and parli debaters can easily compete in pufo and win, since the field is not as strong in pufo. Pufo occupies that sweet spot between cx and parli, so a parli debater can't go into a competitive cx tournament and expect to win, but can with pufo. So then your two options for team debate become parli and policy (cx = policy), and between the two parli is definitely the better option for newcomers. Luckily for you, basically all the good parli teams and tournaments exist in CA and Oregon. Unlike pufo, parli is growing pretty fast, with more and more competitors each year and an increasing number of tournaments. There are small and large tournaments, too. Unlike pufo, there is no clearly defined national circuit (since HS parli exists largely in CA), but this has been changing with the introduction of tournaments like NPDI and TOC @ Cal."

Debate,2dupea,lexdevil,1 point,Mon Aug 18 13:42:45 2014 UTC,"On #3: They list different tournaments because the tournament hosts choose which to use. Joy of Tournaments is a for profit site. It has been around longer than Tabroom and used to be the only game in town for online registration. Tournaments that use it pay Joy at least $150 for the web entry service (more in many cases).  Tabroom was created/sponsored by a non-profit and is free of charge. It is more commonly used on the East Coast, but is gaining popularity with West Coast tournaments (you can't argue with free!). Many tournaments stick with Joy, however, because they are unfamiliar with how Tabroom works, or because they also use the Joy software to tabulate their tournament, or because they believe that Joy is more widely known and will bring them bigger entries. Over time, as familiarity with Tabroom increases, the balance will shift.  As a team, you will use BOTH (unless you choose to attend only tournaments that use one or the other)."
Debate,2dupea,lexdevil,2,Tue Aug 19 12:41:57 2014 UTC,"OP, this person knows what they are talking about.   However, I suggest doing parli instead of pufo. The latter is dying in California.   I'll update this post with more specifics in about 8 hours."
Debate,2dupea,lexdevil,5,Mon Aug 18 08:11:23 2014 UTC,"thepublicforum's advice is excellent. Here are a few more comments/ideas.   Public Forum v. Parli: PF is not dying, though Parli is popular in CA because it was introduced first. That said, there are some disadvantages to Parli that you should consider in choosing the event on which your team will focus at first. --PF is an official event of The National Speech and Debate Society (formerly NFL); Parli is not. That means that for the purpose of amassing honor society points, you will receive more points for PF than Parli (6 points for a win as opposed to 4 in Parli). --The CA High School Speech Association made Parli one of its official events many years ago, so it is offered at CA league tournaments (but so are Policy, Lincoln Douglas, Student Congress, and Public Forum). This is not the case in most other states. As a result, if your long term plans for the team involve travel, you will find a shortage of Parli opportunities in the West, but outside of CA. There are, however, many large Western invitationals that offer Public Forum competition (as well as other events). These include tournaments at UNLV and ASU. --In Public Forum it is possible to qualify for and compete at several national championships: the NSDA Championship, the Tournament of Champions in Kentucky, and the National Debate Coaches Association Championship, and NCFL (Catholic) Nationals. There is no Parli at these tournaments. Parli opportunities: If you do decide to try Parli (you could even do both), there is an early Parli invitational at Analy HS in Sebastopol, which is close to you. Your school does not have to join CHSSA/GGSA to attend. It is called the Banana Classic and will be held on 9/13. The following weekend (9/20) the GGSA will host a Parli and Student Congress competition at Santa Rosa HS.  Entering Tournaments: Most tournament invitations can be found on either tabroom.com or joyoftournaments.com. For tabroom, each team member should have their own account. The coach's account should be used for making entries and the team member accounts should be associated with it. For joy, there should be a single team account administered by the coach. The GGSA (your local league) calendar is here: http://www.ggsa.org/calendar Coach: Yes, you need to find an adult at your school to chaperone, plan transportation, process tournament entries, etc. This job could be done by a parent, but that is not ideal. Parts of the job could be doled out to various student officers if absolutely necessary. It is, however, better to have a single adult in charge of most administrative details (making sure the team enters on time, making sure to drop entries of students who are not going, etc.). Errors in this area can be costly (you could end up paying hundreds of dollars in fees for kids who decided not to go at the last minute). It is best if there is a single point of contact (usually an adult teacher) through whom everything is run.  The good news is that the teacher coach need not have debate experience. It is, of course, better if they do, but both PF and Parli are not too hard for new coaches to pick up."
Debate,2dupea,lexdevil,2,Mon Aug 18 12:26:05 2014 UTC,Thank you! One thing: how did you manage to find out about the Analy invitational? I'm struggling to find smaller events not run by a league.
Debate,2dupea,cookimonster,2,Mon Aug 18 14:33:54 2014 UTC,"I know about the Analy tournament because it is on the GGSA calendar, which I linked. They host it at the same time each year. Entry is usually on Joy of Tournaments, though I do not see it listed yet.  You may be reluctant to join CHSSA and the GGSA because of the cost, but I recommend it. Yes, your school will need to pay annual dues (GGSA dues will be waived for the first year), but the entry fees at GGSA tournaments are generally substantially lower than those at invitational tournaments. GGSA entry fees tend to run around $15 per person or less. Many invitationals charge more like $100 per person (though some, like Analy, are very reasonable). The cost of competition will be lower overall if you join the league. Additionally, the GGSA offers divisions for novice and JV competitors, and not all invitationals do.  Here are a few upcoming invitationals and GGSA tournaments offering PF or Parli:  9/13-14/2014    Garcia Memorial Invitational (Policy/LD/PF/Cong)    St. Francis HS, San Jose  9/20/14 GGSA Congress #1/Parli #1   Santa Rosa HS  9/27-28/2014    Jack Howe (All Events)  CSU Long Beach  9/27-28/2014    Nichols Invitational (PF)   Harker School, San Jose  10/11/14    GGSA Debate #1 (PF, LD, Policy) Dougherty Valley HS, San Ramon  10/17-18/2014   CSU Fullerton (Policy/LD/PF)    Fullerton, CA  11/1/14 GGSA Debate #2 (PF/LD)  TBA  11/8/14 GGSA Debate #2 (Parli/Congress) TBA  11/15-16/2014   Presentation Invitational (PF)  Presentation HS, San Jose"

Debate,2dupea,CTR0,2,Wed Aug 20 22:24:52 2014 UTC,"Don't make the mistake of assuming that league competition is larger/more important/harder than invitationals. In the SF Bay Area the GGSA offers competition that is low priced (far cheaper than most invitationals). It always has Novice and JV divisions. Though the tournaments may be large (several hundred debaters), the debaters are broken into different events and divisions. It is really the most appropriate place for beginners to start out. My team, for example, has a heavy national travel schedule, but we always start our novices at GGSA. It doesn't make sense to invest more in going to an invitational until the debaters have done a bit more work.  Also, most invitationals are two+ day affairs with 6 preliminary rounds followed by elimination rounds. They are a major time commitment, and often have high entry fees. A one day, 3-4 round GGSA tournament is a much kinder/gentler place to start.  Even if you are not competing at GGSA #1 on September 20, you should still send a teacher/parent/coach. Because it is the first GGSA tournament of the year, there will be a league coaches meeting. This will be a good opportunity for that adult to learn about the league and make connections with other coaches in the area. One or more of them may even be willing to serve as a mentor."

Debate,2dit55,instinctivity,2,Thu Aug 14 09:32:46 2014 UTC,"In general? You should have a meta level overview at the top of each flow. In policy this means emphasizing the arguments that you feel matter most so that you win the advantage/disadvantage outweighs your opponent's impacts. In Lincoln Douglas and pf this should go at the top of your case flow. Explain why your argument is net more important than theirs. Offense - defense is important as well. Offense is a reason why voting for you is good (if we don't stop online gambling, people will get addicted) while defense is a reason why voting for you isn't bad (if we federally prohibit online gambling, the economy won't be harmed). Other than that you should be debating off of your flow/doing line by line, because judges won't evaluate new arguments"
Debate,2dit55,ribwomberly,2,Thu Aug 14 11:59:45 2014 UTC,"Delivering effective rebuttals is very difficult. After 4 years, even I haven't mastered it. However, I do have a few good things I learned along the way.   Starting a rebuttal can be difficult and awkward. The best way to deal with this is providing an overview, presenting weighing mechanisms. This is the best time to present a baseline for weighing, present the different mechanisms and provide a blanket response on a case. Tie framework comparisons in, if an overview is not appropriate or if you have extra time. Dealing with arguments: The one thing to keep in mind when delivering rebuttals is that a person doesn't want the judge to think for themselves. A good debater thinks for the judge. When blocking a contention, provide a variety of responses, including critical reference to topicality or uniqueness, evidence that denies the claim, evidence that turns the claim, and/or evidence that weighs opposing claims. By providing so many responses, a person simply states that no matter how a person views it, we beat it. Often times teams will runs cases with a bunch of contentions (more than 2 or 3). With a limited amount of time, group arguments that are similar to become more efficient. For example, a person can argue that decriminalizing marijuana will reduce usage rates and reduce crime. These arguments can be grouped, because increasing usage defeats the first arguments and link turns the second.  Using time effectively: It's hard to plot out a rebuttal but remember to speak slowly and keep a good pace (in PF). Try to, based on how many contentions and the quality of each, get a basic idea on how much time to use on each. A good idea is to spend only about 1 minute on overview/FW and 3 on contentions, but this will vary. At first it will be difficult, but gaining experience and redoing rebuttals will help to consolidate and help a person to be more concise.  Closing a speech: Many people will simply end a rebuttal by simply finishing a block and saying ""for these reasons, we..."" This isn't a bad strategy, but the most effective tool is to provide the judge with a lasting ultimatum that can be stressed in future speeches. ""Ultimately, if you want to stop ____ and benefit ____, you vote for...""  Setting up future speeches: The rebuttal isn't only about this speech, but is necessary for future speeches as well. Weighing mechanisms are the most important thing. Touch on them in the rebuttal and present them in more depth in the Summary speech, with critical reference to responses and standing evidence. A good rebuttal will also extend into crossfire/examination. The rebuttal crossfire can be difficult, but it is time that a person should really stress how things work. The key is to try and make your opponents slip up or admit a fault. Keep asking ""Why?"" and 90% of teams will eventually slip up.    These are all the points I can stress beyond the basics. The most important thing to realize is that success isn't instant, and a person will only become successful through practice and experience. Always keep pushing yourself"
Debate,2dit55,Clusterfist,2,Thu Aug 14 12:14:52 2014 UTC,"Hard to answer this properly without knowing what event you do. Since I do pfd, ill answer this about pf (and im sure if you do a different event a lot of the ideas carry over)   Make sure that going into the round you have a lot of statistics and information that you don't use in your constructive that could be used against common arguments. If you spend the entire rebuttal just rehashing your constructive and crossapplying arguments without adding any new cards or statistics you will have a hard time.  Timing is super important in rebuttals. Starting out, 4 minutes seems like a long ass time to talk without having anything prepared, but as you advance as a debater you find that you will have more than 4 minutes worth of things to say a lot of times. Make sure you keep up a good pace and keep an eye on your time so that you don't have to abruptly cut off your speech.  Make sure you address all of your opponents contentions and framework. If you leave something out, they will abuse it.  Don't just throw evidence and information at the judge and expect them to understand it all. Make sure you are not only giving evidence but also analysis as to why their arguments are flawed and yours are not. After every piece of evidence I'll generally add a quick ""this shows..."" or something along those lines and put the evidence in my own easy to understand words.  I had something else but I can't remember what it was now. EDIT: I remember now. Organization! its really important that all of your information is organized before standing up for your speech. It looks really bad if you are fumbling through papers and pausing every couple of seconds to find what you are looking for. Find a method of organization that works best for you.    Most important thing is just being prepared and confident."
Debate,2dit55,confetti27,1 point,Thu Aug 14 18:29:32 2014 UTC,"Hi, I'm a parli debater. Not sure what kind of debate you're doing and most probably you're doing PF or LD.  But I believe the general tips for rebuttals are substantially similar.   These are general tips for rebuttals quoted from 2010 Monash Association of Debaters Member Training Guide:   General Rebuttal Tips Although a well researched and persuasively presented case are an enormous help when trying to win a debate, it’s usually the quality of rebuttal that separates two good teams in a debate. Rebuttal is the ‘dark’ side of debating since it requires you to locate and exploit the mistakes and weaknesses in your opponent’s arguments. I guess that’s why I like it so much. So here are my tips on mastering this essential element of debating.  (1) Do you know how much rebuttal you are supposed to do? Be certain. The number one complaint made by adjudicators in relation to rebuttal is that speakers are not doing the appropriate amount of rebuttal. Never mind the quality, most debaters are just too eager to get off rebuttal and to start their prepared material. Make sure that you know how much rebuttal is expected of you (see the section on speaker roles in this handbook) and aim to meet those requirements.  (2) Listen very carefully before you even try to think of rebuttal. Small details can be crucial. The longer most people debate, the less attentive they are to the finer details of their opponent’s arguments. Do not assume that after 10 or 20 seconds of listening to your opponent that you “know what they are saying” and can then focus on formulating rebuttal. Listen carefully and pay attention to details, especially when a team is presenting a model. You don’t want to be accused of misrepresenting an argument or misquoting a speaker – it makes you look unprofessional and ill informed.  (3) Save nothing for later – hit ‘em as hard as you can, as soon as you can. Rebuttal needs priorities, with the best points coming out first. Especially for the 1st Negative speaker. Remember that your opposition has just had several minutes of uninterrupted time to persuade the audience. You need to very quickly undermine the credibility of their case and take control of the debate. However at every stage of the debate speakers should use their rebuttal to change the momentum of the debate, and reassert the superiority of their teams argument.  (4) Good rebuttal combines accurate criticisms of your opponent, with references to your own team’s case. Whenever you point out a flaw in your opponent’s logic or in the practicality of what they are proposing, that is the best time to demonstrate to the audience that your team did not make similar mistakes. Continuous comparing and contrasting of the opposing arguments throughout the debate is an effective and methodical way to simultaneously tear down your opponent, while propping up your own arguments. Just be careful not to spend too much time discussing your own material; just refer to it as a reminder of the strengths in your case.  Cheers"

Debate,2dit55,that_random_potato,1 point,Sat Aug 16 05:27:07 2014 UTC,"There are a number of effective ways to create rebuttal. I will go over a few techniques.   Outright Rebuttal. This is a way in which you defeat the argument by pointing out a flaw in the argument. For example, If I argued that Legalising Drugs is a good thing because it takes money away from criminals. A rebuttal to this could be that you don't get rid of the drug dealing ability of these criminals as they will still be the only people selling more dangerous and creative drugs than the government. Shrinking Circles us another form of rebuttal in which you claim that what they have said is not important as it doesn't effect many. For example if I argue that by banning eating and production of meat. You could in return say that in the grand scheme of things that is not very important. Cross Benefit Analysis. This is where you agree with there point but say that compared to all the points you brought it is not very important and that you still win out. This is good if you genuinely cant think of a response to a point."

Debate,2dhpf7,advocateforkittens,11,Thu Aug 14 00:29:00 2014 UTC,"Well, for your team, here's a basic rundown of what each brief contains:   Champion Briefs: Best evidence and topic analysis for most debaters. A large criticism is that the brief is too soft and is oriented too much towards novices. I agree, but I still think it is invaluable in terms of grasping a topic Foundation Briefs: Very good evidence from a variety of sources. However, the evidence is often power tagged and has little substance. Still worth the price. Planet Debate: A more policy/LD oriented brief that has more obscure evidence. It's a more of a hit or miss brief; good some months, bad others. Planet Debate does have a large amount of power tagging and is in many cases difficult to understand for the beginning debaters Paradigm Research: Very good brief with great evidence. Features more obscure arguments, but has great evidence on core arguments as well. The only real downside is it has probably the worst consistency, hit or miss.  Forensic Files: Lower level brief that is produced quickly. The evidence isn't that great, but has decent contentions and blocks pre written, as well as cases. Not the best. West Coast Publishing: By far the fastest to produce evidence, with decent evidence every once and a while. More policy/LD oriented but is not bad. Not the best. PFDebate: In my opinion the best. PFDebate produces three files that cover every argument, including a file to counter evidence in other briefs. Only downside is it is costly unless purchased with a subscription. Bid Round Briefs: The best brief in terms of blocks. Has good evidence on a variety of arguments and is well organized. Very good, but is inconsistent sometimes, but for the most part is worth the price. Winning Words: PLEASE PRODUCE ANOTHER BRIEF. I loved this brief and if they still sell, they are Clusterfist approved as amazing. Cover every arguments with great evidence.  Commander Files: Newer debate company, but has great evidence. Not very consistent, but had been improving recently. Worth the money, and I expect it to get better this year. Debate Doctors: Don't buy this  Resolution Briefs: Great brief company that is just starting out. Very good evidence. I expect good things from this. Big Sky Publishing: Very well organized and has great evidence. A little expensive, but good overall.   These are all the ones I can think of. I would consider almost any of these, with particular notice towards Champion Briefs and PFDebate"

Debate,2dbgaa,ZwischenzugZugzwang,9,Tue Aug 12 07:56:55 2014 UTC,"Practice. If you don't have anyone on your team who can spread (or has the time to help), watch videos of national circuit LD and practice.  You want to make sure you flow well, then work on grouping arguments (as in finding commonalities so you can respond to them as a group instead of individually) and identifying the most important parts. You won't be able to respond to each little point individually, and you don't need to.  The more arguments there are on the flow, the less time each one is going to get. So there's probably going to be holes in their argumentation, so learn to identify and call them out quickly. If they make a claim and don't back it up, all you need to do is point out that there's no warrants, and therefore no reason to believe it. If something is false but unimportant, you probably just want to leave it alone or just give a cursory ""nuh-uh"" response (which will allow you to attack it later if it turns out to be important). If something is hard to explain, it might just not be worth it.  Learn the jargon and debate theory too. You don't have to explicitly employ it, but you need to understand it. Each bit of jargon represents a really important idea, so make sure you have those ideas down. Not how to just throw a word around (which some people do), but what it means and represents."
Debate,2dbgaa,MangoBitch,6,Tue Aug 12 10:01:08 2014 UTC,"Adding on to this, grouping is the best strategy to combat spreading.  Consider the expression, ""don't miss the forest for the trees,"" i.e. don't get lost in the details. Grouping is a strategy that focuses your judge on the forest. This means you need to understand your argument forwards and backwards. What are you advocating, and why is it different than your opponent's position?  Once you understand that you can simplify and generalize your opponent's arguments. For example, if you're running with a deontological framework, and your opponent is running an ontological framework, then you can group his points and point out why they're immoral. (This then turns the debate to the framework/CV-criterion. You can then prep serious front lines for why your framework is better.) You can do similar groups with no-warrants, attacking the credibility of certain sources, and attacking any common point of causation.   If you're not planning on trying to keep up/out spread, then part of your counter-argument also needs to highlight the forest v. trees dichotomy. Point out that your opponent has just dropped a bunch of nonsense into the flow. The ease at which you can combine and dispatch them shows your opponent's case is mostly bluster. Further, you should argue that debate is an educational activity, and whatever the merits of spreading, your opponent certainly isn't helping. The spread should be used to get more good ideas on the flow, not to dump a bunch of bad ones. This argument will minimize any drops/undercoverage, and potentially provide an offensive/independent reason for your judge to side with you, even if you're less than convincing."

In other words Fast is not neccisarily better then slow. If you have made good results with your style make sure you don't compromise it by studying up on this more progressive style.   As for learning to become more competitive in that stylistic match up I suggest the following  1) Listen to spreading as much as possible. Whether that means debating a sister team you have that is more open to a progressive style or even just youtubing old videos of spreaders.   2) Use your narrotive style to your advantage. Because you are going slower you have the upper hand on things like inflection and emphasis. Highlight the largest points in the round and force your opponents to hyper focus on the issues that you set as pivotal points.  3) Out prepare your opponents. Most debaters have TONS of evidance ready to counter what there opponents say, however because you have accepted a lower words per minute then your oppnent you have accepted a burden to prepare more blocks that will cover there arguments in a shorter time. Time your blocks and try to make them as efficient as possible without letting them get long.  4) I'm hesitant to put this last one, but be open to the idea of grouping and case turns. This is the easiest ways to reduce time arguing and rather talk on a larger scale addressing all there points at once."

You should certainly be prepared to debate against it. Bear in mind that when you're debating someone faster than you, even when you're grouping arguments its a game of 'what can I safely drop?' Don't get pressured into responding to argument C on sub point A-1 if that's not necessary. Respond to the most dangerous (to your case) arguments first, and use what you have as leverage against whatever it is they say you dropped."
Debate,2dbgaa,Nickerwinjr,2,Wed Aug 13 04:51:40 2014 UTC,"My best advice is really just to watch videos and observe rounds with spreading. After a while you are just able to understand it fairly easily. If you are in a round where your opponent is spreading just go walk behind them and look over their shoulder at their speech or laptop and just copy some stuff down so you dont need to do that all in prep. If you still arent able to get anything they said, just find out their value and criterion and just try knock out their framework. In regards to debate jargon, you just learn that as you experience it because new phrases and things are always being brought into debate."
Debate,2d7ss4,reykan,15,Mon Aug 11 07:42:29 2014 UTC,"There are literally hundreds of logical fallacies, but for debating you don't need to know that many. I'll run through some basic ones for you.  Appeal to Tradition- Essentially boils down to 'this is the way it's always been done, so it should continue to be done in this way'. Fairly basic logical error here, so it's not really seen that often in debates. If you're saying that something should be done in a certain way, you need to explain why that way of doing it is actually advantageous. Taking down an Appeal to Tradition is pretty straightforward. You simply need to point out that your opponents haven't logically justified their proposed course of action. Perhaps briefly mention things that were traditional but have been proven to be wrong e.g. slavery.  Appeal to History- Similar to the Appeal to Tradition but not the same. An Appeal to History is very common in debating as people will try to bring up previous examples of a policy to justify using that policy in another country. For example, 'Marijuana was legalised in Arizona and consumption fell by x% and it raised x million dollars from taxation, so if we legalise it in the UK, consumption will decrease and tax revenue will increase'. This is an Appeal to History as it asserts that past actions are a reliable guide to future actions. The point being made might be completely valid, but this isn't a valid way of justifying it, so call them out on this, and if you're trying to disprove their case, explain how the circumstances are different in the country being discussed and try to show why the same effects would not occur.  Appeal to Authority- This is when you try to justify an argument by saying that a powerful or authority figure also supports your case. For example, 'David Cameron supports a cap on immigration, so we should try to reduce immigration'. Powerful people can be, and often are, wrong, so this doesn't back up your case at all. In a debate, I would say something like 'The Opposition's claim was backed up by the support of ......, but clearly this doesn't support their case as they haven't offered any logical reasoning as to why this policy would be successful'.  False Cause/Post Hoc/Cum Hoc- Three different but similar fallacies here. A False Cause is when you suggest that B was caused by A when there may be no link. You need to show why A will cause B. Post Hoc is when you assert that A caused B because A happened before B. Cum Hoc is when you assert that A caused B because A happened at the same time as B. All three of these are fallacious. You ALWAYS need to logically prove why A will cause B.  Tu Quoque- Very common in debating. This is when you say that something potentially bad should be done because it's not as bad as an alternative solution. For example, 'Smoking is legal and it's more harmful than marijuana, therefore marijuana should also be legal'. This isn't a reason to do anything. It would be like me saying that stabbing you in the leg is acceptable because it's not as bad as stabbing you in the head. Show why something should be done by explaining the actual advantages of doing it.  Circular Argument- Most arguments in debates are complex enough to avoid this error. This is when one of your reasons is the same as the concusion. For example, 'We can prove that God exists because it says so in the Bible, and the Bible must be true because it's the word of God'. This is completely circular and requires the assumption that God exists in the first place to make any sense.  Conflation- When you say that two things are the same when they're not, that's a conflation. I've been in a debate where a guy said that legalising torture for suspected terrorists (which is what we were proposing) was the equivalent of abolishing human rights. Don't do this; it makes you sound like a fool.  False Dichotomy- One of my personal favourite fallacies, and very common in debating. This is when you reduce an argument to two very extreme options, when there are other, more reasonable options. For example, 'We either do nothing and watch innocent people be brutally slaughtered by the corrupt military, or intervene with our own military, causing further conflict and destabilising the relationship between the USA and Russia'. There are other options than these two- peace talks, negotiations, financial sanctions, etc. You're likely to find in a debate that one of the options put forward sound significantly better than the other. This should be a big warning sign to you that this fallacy might be occurring. Try to disprove the seemingly perfect option and then show other more reasonable options if you're trying to destroy the opposition's arguments.  Straw Man- Taking one aspect of an argument and completely exaggerating it, then claiming to have disproven the entire case. For example, 'A: Sunny days are good. B:If all days were sunny, we'd never have rain, and without rain, we'd have famine and death.' There's also a whiff of conflation here, as B incorrectly believes A is saying it would be good if all days were sunny, which he isn't.  Slippery slope- Very common in debating. In British Parliamentary format, judges hate it when you do this, and I'm sure it's frowned upon in other styles too. This is when you take the opposition's argument and make several unsupported leaps before arriving at a ridiculous and unlikely outcome. For example, 'legalising marijuana will make everyone more lazy, so people will stop going to work, so the US economy will collapse, so the world economy will collapse, so the world will descend into poverty and famine.'  Hope this helps :)"

Considering that the September/October topic is going to be a) a topic we have for August, September, AND October, and b) a topic used to teach novices, I think it should be a balanced, clear topic like the interscholastic sports one.

Debate,2cyt4n,amccarsh,7,Wed Aug 13 08:07:26 2014 UTC,"I value your opinion, but I believe for the same reasons that the interscholastic topic is very difficult to debate.   The topic is very one sided, with much of academic literature supporting the fact that participating in sports is shown to increase grades, likelihood of attending college and long term earnings, among other things, while the neg evidence receives very little academic literature and is instead oriented towards obscure arguments about discrimination or trade offs.   Also, the evidence for the topic is incredible weak, mostly poorly supported rhetoric and a distinct lack of statistical studies. If this was to be chosen, the debates, in my opinion, would become stale very quickly, considering there are few arguments for either side, like the February 2014 topic.  In my opinion, there is better literature for the subsidies topic. While there are economic problems and intangible impacts, there is logical reasoning behind it. If the economics were the only factor, then libraries and museums wouldn't exist, however communities recognize their value beyond economics. In addition harms are temporary while benefits exist in the long term. The harms of a sports subsidy most occurs in the one time cost of building a stadium, renovation among other things is only a fraction of the cost.  However, once a team has relocated into a community, it stays for a long time, meaning the harms are shared between a large pool of tax payers, around $10 per capita, yet provide benefits for future generations as well. With solid knowledge, pro is quite debatable against the favored con.   In addition, actual evidence exists on this topic like time series analysis on a state-wide level. If we want to teach novices to be introduced to winning research early, than a person should vote for the subsidies topic.   It's a close one, and that's why I can see it going either way. Like I said, I expect it to be one of the closest votes in recent months."
Debate,2cyt4n,SuperSharpShot2247,2,Fri Aug 8 17:17:47 2014 UTC,"I debated interscholastic sports at camp, and actually preffed con. Plenty of literature exists saying that it is correlative, and doesn't show causality. Arguments like distractions, trade offs, teachers giving athletes unfairly higher grades, etc all are pretty stock and easy to make, which makes the topic accessible to novices. And economic benefits and harms are going to be biggest, and a topic where there is a consensus as to which side is right isn't good. Things like civic pride exist but don't weigh well against monetary harms. Weighing and comparing this is also really hard for novices, especially considering how intangible pro impacts become. As for long term benefits, there's also some near irrefutable answers, including a study that said only 8 out of 50 (or somewhere around that ratio) stadiums actually produced the long term benefits. Harms like tourism harms are also long term harms."
Debate,2cyt4n,hawkeyes459,2,Fri Aug 8 17:59:15 2014 UTC,"Well, if we are talking about novices in particular, I still side with the subsidies topic. Many arguments can be made on pro for the subsidies topic that are very easy to understand. When there's a sports stadium, outsiders visit the games and spend money. When a stadium is built, a city looks more attractive and my home value goes up. When there's a stadium, that stadium requires jobs to build the stadium, maintain and operate as well as concession and food stands. While these are arguments that have good evidence against them, they are very logical and easy points to start out from.   For a topic standpoint, it's not all about novices though. For me, this is my senior year and I'd would prefer to debate a topic will solid evidence and potentially numerous arguments. The interscholastic sports topic makes me, personally, feel uncomfortable with arguments. For example, I would love to argue that there are distractions from sports, but most evidence agrees athletes receive higher grades. Well, the teachers give them higher grades, well they also perform better on standardized tests isolated from teachers and admission chances. Well that's correlation not causation, except when standards are put in place to require certain grades and test scores to participate and studies independently isolate the effects of sports and education. Also teen pregnancy. It's not a fun debate.  Atleast on the subsidies topic there is some literature to debate with, as well as fundamental logic and good methodology arguments. Weighing is easier on the subsidies topic than you think.   Vote as you may, I'm still favoring the subsidies topic."

Extension cords and surge protectors will make you very popular.  My team started bringing one and its very handy for cellphones.  Bringing candy or snacks is really nice.  Most of my team tries to quadruple enter when they can and don't have much time to find food.  Its a godsend to see something to fill our bellies on the table.  For girls bringing a surplus of hairspray, bobby pins and rubber bands is a good idea. Also a brush.  A bad hairday will bring your confidence down a lot and the hairspray has saved some guys too.

Debate,2bupaa,dancon25,14,Sun Jul 27 11:48:08 2014 UTC,"That's a hard question to answer because they typically don't do debates like how we do. We debate as a game or a competitive sport, where a judge is given the jurisdiction to designate a winner and a loser. When public intellectuals ""debate,"" it's much more of a dialogue than a competition - the Chomsky-Foucault debate over power and human nature for instance was more of a butting-heads of different takes on language, power systems, history and the like, rather than a battle for the ballot like we engage in. As such it's usually much more an event of idea-exchanging and even viewpoint-confirming than winning and losing arguments, if that makes sense to you."
Debate,2bupaa,mcook85,6,Sun Jul 27 19:12:18 2014 UTC,"This is true. The Chomsky-Foucault debate, if thought about in American policy debate terms, ultimately came down to two different starting points. Chomsky felt that institutional power could be isolated from other systems of power. Foucault attempted to demonstrate techniques of power to be isolatable, but still function the same (their incompleteness, their constant productivity, and the privileging of particular knowledges). Foucault characteristically avoided normative claims about particular institutions while Chomsky took aim at several as malicious. There was very little clash other than semantic differences between locations of power.   To the main point, though, Zizek and Chomsky do engage opposition, but often on paper, where they can articulate and support themselves. That's how academics typically address criticism. The Habermas/Foucault debate on power/critique is a good example of debates squandering due to the unwillingness to agree on fundamental terms."
Debate,2bupaa,dancon25,3,Sun Jul 27 20:08:00 2014 UTC,I agree! Do you have a link to the exchange between Habermas and Foucault? I've not heard of it before now.
Debate,2bupaa,mcook85,2,Sun Jul 27 20:10:49 2014 UTC,"I'm reading a book now about it. ""Critique and Power: Recasting the Foucault/Habermas Debate"" ed. Michael Kelly, MIT Press. 1994. It's a collection of essays on the subject of Habermas/Foucault. The debate never happened formally, though many have carried on where both left off. Good reading."

Debate,2bupaa,dancon25,1 point,Sun Jul 27 21:01:34 2014 UTC,"I think that's for sure, but if you look at the Chomsky Foucalt debate that someone posted below there is a clear sense that Chomsky comes off worse at the end.  There isn't a clear judgement, certainly, and that's not what I was looking for, but there can still be a 'winner'."
Debate,2bupaa,dancon25,1 point,Mon Jul 28 05:58:12 2014 UTC,"Fair enough. I read the book, didn't watch the video, so it could have just not transmitted.

Debate,2bupaa,Jalor,1 point,Mon Jul 28 18:55:29 2014 UTC,"I would add that it's especially difficult to judge who ""won or lost"" a free flowing exchange of ideas like that in part because neither Foucault nor Chomsky were specifically affirming or negating a resolution statement."
Debate,2bupaa,ravendb8,2,Fri Aug 1 02:57:36 2014 UTC,"Agreed! I think the idea of ""judging"" such an event is hopeless - neither intellectual even had it in mind to ""win"" the discussion, I imagine."

Debate,2b6yo8,indian-princess,2,Sun Jul 20 14:59:34 2014 UTC,"Policy is longer, but the differences are more extreme than you let on.  LD is about affirming vs negating the resolution. ""Jury nullification is immoral"" vs ""no it's not"". Policy is about creating a plan vs defending the status quo; i.e. ""the united states should deploy troups to japan... in this specific way"" vs ""that's stupid and will fail, we should keep things as they are""  LD is very low on facts. Policy debaters were once known for carrying giant bins full of note cards. Nowadays we all use laptops. You must reference all your ""spending increased by 200%"" data with names, dates, and journalistic sources.  LD, at the lower levels, doesn't have much spreading. Policy will. If you aren't familiar, spreading is the technique of talking very quickly so that you can get more information into the time slot and your opponent can't keep track of all all your points.  Policy is very research heavy. As mentioned above, you will be expected to have a lot of ""factoids"", cited with sources, to support the ""case"" that you build. Unlike LD, you usually don't come up with a new way to argue every tournament. Most policy debaters stick with one ""plan"" for the entirety of the year.  Most importantly, LD is done individually, while policy is done in pairs."

Debate,2b6yo8,Historically,1 point,Sun Jul 20 22:52:33 2014 UTC,"So are you planning to debate policy throughout the year at all? Honestly, an LD camp probably would've been better, but policy encompasses a pretty wide scope. The kritiks and stuff will probably be especially helpful, and the DAs not-so-much. You may want to focus more on portable skills policy gives you (think fast/talk fast, presenting yourself and your arguments, etc.). A lot of the content may be policy-specific, but these skills will still be applicable to LD.  I haven't been to camp before this year, so I won't be much help, but usually lab leaders are pretty helpful even if you're super new--my lab has a guy who never debated at all before. So ask a lot of questions and show your lab leaders you're genuinely interested in learning."
