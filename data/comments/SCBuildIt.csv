About 3 hours ago I used a feeder city to buy some items off my main city. The coins went away from my feeder, the item went into my feeder's inventory, but the main city still shows the item in the depot. The feeder shows the main's depot empty.

Of course, the llamas would probably fuck something up before the deal got done though.  I tend to think there should be a different price based on supply and demand.  Like in the stock market, you should be able to put out bids (I need an ice cream sandwhich and i'll pay 1200) and asks (i have an ice cream sandwhcih and I'll take 1500 for it).  That way, when you want something right now, you can get it.  Of course, this would screw over newer players who dont have enough coins, so maybe your market system needs tiers based on what level you are.

SCBuildIt,3dpwxo,SJHSports,3,Sat Jul 18 08:15:59 2015 UTC,Once you reach the top tier they won't upgrade further. If you do not have luxury buildings at that point you need to bulldoze them and rebuild.

SCBuildIt,3dpwxo,howlatthebeast,2,Sat Jul 18 09:51:17 2015 UTC,"The blue line shows how much the park is adding to the population, it doesn't show how much more the zone can upgrade. For an RZ, there is the base zone (the cleared area with the fence around it and construction equipment). The construction hat bubbles let you build on that zone, up until you reach the 6th tier. After that point, the building won't upgrade anymore, no matter what you put near it. Luxury buildings don't give anymore population than standard buildings, the difference is entirely cosmetic."
SCBuildIt,3dpwxo,CheerstoChicken,2,Sat Jul 18 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"You may need to demo and rebuild to get luxury buildings, but that's just aesthetics. If you want advice, have FUN! Maybe wait until later to worry about it.  At level 17 I'd take what I got and just keep expanding. Mainly for the tax money that comes with more buildings. As long as you max out ANY building's upgrades you will get the max population that specialities and parks allow, whether it looks luxury or not.   But if you're looking for the reason why you're not getting luxuries it's because you have to have at least two speciality areas covering the area while you're updating and building. That said there's something to be said with just building. The buildings may look different but it's all to the same end, which is focus on specializations.   Hope that helps!"
SCBuildIt,3dpwxo,MostlyNotADouche,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks, CheerstoChicken. This is helpful. Can you answer a couple questions please about how to get ""luxury"" buildings?   Does only the final upgrade need to be with two specialties applied to the building?  Do parks or beach buildings count? If a building is asking for an upgrade, can I move it to where it has two specialties and then upgrade it and get a ""luxury"" building? Or does it have to be in range of the specialities when the upgrade is first requested by the building?   Thanks!   (Daddy wants pretty, shiny buildings!!! ;)"
SCBuildIt,3dpwxo,CheerstoChicken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:43 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. Well there was a post where someone laid out the exact numbers needed for luxuries in a comment and I'll try to find it quick. That said for now can tell you I don't think you can move it once you start construction, since luxury buildings take up more services from the get-go.   Anyone should feel absolutely free to correct me if I'm wrong though, okay? Okay cool. Be right back with those other numbers, hopefully."

First off, the entry square to the city is off by one space up. No biggie, probably swap the admin buildings with reactors and push the whole thing one space down.  Oh, and as for the beaches, it might be impossible to get all Relaxing Beaches and Marinas since they both have pre-reqs and there are no other positions to transfer beach buildings to. Maybe swap 2 RBs with one Pier?"

SCBuildIt,3do9sh,frownface84,2,Sun Jul 19 16:44:55 2015 UTC,I meant that you get an effective 5rz coverage out of each Wheel. I might have phrased that poorly.

You do not get keys.  Tokyo town zones bring a bit of culture and variety to your otherwise homogenous town. They also have 20% more population. The catch is though that they require twice as many services (i.e. 2 power, 2 water etc) and they require tokyo town tokens to build, (1 token, then 1 token, then 2 then 2, then 2 and finally 3) requiring 11 in total.  Disappointingly you can only do 1 shipment every 18 hours which will mean that it'll take a long while to complete even a modest number of tokyo skyscrapers. Though in recent updates you can now get them from gift bubbles and from daniel. You can also buy them on the GTHO (but GL with that)  A lot of people get put off by the scarcity and sheer number of TTZ tokens required that they give up. Usually in a reddit posting rage.

SCBuildIt,3dembm,chief-ares,2,Wed Jul 15 18:54:24 2015 UTC,I have 2 Android devices I use. Both lose out on deals all the damn time. No solution but I feel your pain.
SCBuildIt,3dembm,greeneyes826,2,Wed Jul 15 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"It's not really internet. It's a mistake to think that when an ad appears on your screen that nobody else has seen it before. All ads are shown to multiple people, and any given ad may have been shown to someone else five or ten seconds before it was shown to you, and internet speed isn't going to help you at all in that situation.  I have excellent internet and find that most high demand items (expansion items mostly) are ""Sold"" when I click through, and if not, chances are about 80% that it will be llama'd when I click on it. 95% of what I do manage to buy is not advertised and I find it behind some other boring item."
SCBuildIt,3dembm,howlatthebeast,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:06:05 2015 UTC,"I hear that. Makes sense. Doesn't make me any less frustrated. I haven't been counting, but I think I might have clicked on, easily, 150 consecutive ""sold"" items. FML"
SCBuildIt,3dembm,Cl1ffsa,0,Thu Jul 16 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"I used 1,5Mb vs 56kbps and conclude i will choose 56kbps because i feel the same. Items still sold out and actually by randomly click we must see items before anyone see it for sure to get it."

SCBuildIt,3dembm,pohpoha,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:52:50 2015 UTC,How about you try playing when most of the US is asleep or busy doing something else? When you have more people trying to buy stuff at certain hours you're likely to get more failures as well. Consider it global trade hq rush hour.

Moved my game over to my iPad mini and I am now able to get those items.    It looks like if you want greater success at getting those items, you need the latest and greatest device as well as a fast wireless connection."

SCBuildIt,3del4n,furyoutbreak,3,Wed Jul 15 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"you should trade based on scarcity, the face value means nothing"
SCBuildIt,3del4n,BlkSmurf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"Doesn't scarcity vary by player?  A week ago I couldn't find a muffler if my life depended on it.  This week, I am finding mufflers all over the place.    From the other trade sites, it is usually based on value."

SCBuildIt,3del4n,BlkSmurf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:08:03 2015 UTC,In up for this too (beach for Vu. Or anything for Vu)
SCBuildIt,3del4n,hypnotwist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"If there is someone willing to trade, just name the price. I am open for negotiations."
SCBuildIt,3del4n,BlkSmurf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:36:33 2015 UTC,How many are you looking for?
SCBuildIt,3del4n,BlkSmurf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:56:58 2015 UTC,I could buy/trade all your Vu controls... something like 10 or 15
