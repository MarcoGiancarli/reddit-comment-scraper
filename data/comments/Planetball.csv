Planetball,3d9tso,hopsafoobar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:11:11 2015 UTC,Just curious. Why using dV instead of saying acceleration?   Or are those two separate concepts?
Planetball,3d9tso,Drkfnl,5,Wed Jul 15 15:25:46 2015 UTC,"Different concepts. dV: velocity change in m/s. Acceleration: how fast you can make that velocity change happen, measured in (m/s)/s Let's assume I want to raise my orbit a few hundred meters: To make that happen, I will need to perform a Hohmann transfer, that is, two burns at opposite sides of the planet, each increasing my velocity. The total velocity change for the maneuver might be around 10 m/s. If I can accelerate with 1m/s/s, my engines will burn for a total of 10 seconds, If I have bigger engines or a lighter spacecraft, I can accelerate faster, say at 5m/s/s and only have to burn for 2 seconds. Because we mostly don't care how long the burns are once a spacecraft is in orbit, it's usually better to use the smallest (and lightest) engine possible that is still fuel efficient."

By 5 billion years in the future rolls around, the Sun becomes a red giant, and begins to expand.  Once the Sun is 13 billion years old, it will expand rapidly, eating Mecury, Venus, Earth, Apophis (random asteroid), and the Moon.  Then the Sun's fusion will end and most of the Sun will radiate away into a planetary nebula, leaving a white dwarf.

Anyway, Gliese 581d and 581g were some of the first planets discovered which possibly had habitable life. This was before the Kepler telescope discovered them by the truckload so the hype was big on these guys. 581d was supposed to be a very big planet just outside of the habitable zone but could potentially stay in because an atmosphere would heat it up, while 581g was smaller and smack dab in the zone.  Unfortunately we're pretty certain now that 581g never existed, it was just other things going on with the star that we didn't account for. Likewise 581d and another planet, 581f, are highly disputed and probably don't exist either.  Still, at least they've been made pretty irrelevant by all the stuff Kepler found.  (Oh, and there was another planet, Gliese 581c, which is in the habitable zone but probably has similar conditions to Venus. It's not disputed and probably does exist.)"

They aren't strictly necessary for the plot, but I really enjoyed drawing them.  Context: The Voyager Golden Record, attached to both voyager probes, contains encoded photographs, greetings in many languages, and a wide selection of music from around the world. The track most people are likely to remember being on it, however, is Chuck Berry's ""Johnnie B. Goode"" - perhaps because it was mentioned as a punchline of a 1977 SNL sketch by Steve Martin. (It was remembering that sketch that gave me the idea for this comic's plot, anyway).  The 6-balls live on a Ringworld covered with purple vegetation."

The Cassini-Huygens Space craft, a satellite/lander that was sent to Saturn to explore the surface of Titan.

My favorite cereal, which is what I was eating when I came up with this comic. (notice how I changed the name to Huygen's Bunches of Oats, super clever.)

Planetball,36kqlb,Spacetime_Inspector,110,Wed May 20 02:34:30 2015 UTC,"...compared to the enormity of the Universe.  Instead of a traditional context, I'll offer panel-by-panel commentary:   Panel 1 - Earth is marginally larger than Venus in mass and volume, so it is the largest terrestrial (rocky) planet. Panel 2 - But of course, the gas giants are much larger. Jupiter is actually underestimating - he's bigger than all the other planets put together, twice. Jupiter does a Russian laugh in this panel because he is feeling large, and Russia is the largest country on Earth. Panel 3 - Sol puts even Jupiter to shame, making up 99% of the solar system's mass. This may be the only depiction of the sun ever made that is both accurate enough to include sunspots and ridiculous enough to include sunglasses. Panel 4 - A large zoom out here to Milky Way (purple) and Andromeda (yellow). They are speaking in broken Latin because they are very old, and their children speak largely in languages descended from Latin. Translation: ""Ah, Andromeda. It's funny for us to hear the little ones announce the are the biggest, when WE are the biggest there are, yes?"" ""What do you mean by 'WE'? I am bigger than you! I am the biggest!"" Panel 5 - ""Andromeda Big!"" Panel 6 - ""Andromeda Stronk!"" Panel 9 - Say hello to Universe, who is smiling happily because it knows it's truly the biggest one there is! I am reasonably certain that I am the first planetball artist ever to use Universe as a character, but since it's a flair for the sub I figured it was fair game. Universe is not on a black background (like planetball) or a white background (like polandball) - instead, it's on a transparent (alpha-channel) background, since nothing exists outside the Universe. I have big, big plans for Universe in a future comic."
Planetball,36kqlb,Necro991,70,Wed May 20 02:44:51 2015 UTC,"That universe is adorable, and I'm not quite sure why... Use it again in another comic, please."

Planetball,36kqlb,columbus8myhw,3,Thu May 21 02:47:31 2015 UTC,Aren't there other structures made up of galaxies? And structures made up of those?
Planetball,36kqlb,columbus8myhw,3,Fri May 22 00:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, clusters and superclusters. But they tend to be very diffuse to the extent that they wouldn't look like anything special or even discernible at all if you looked at them from far away, so I decided to skip past them.  OTOH, there is one in the flair list for this sub... maybe I should figure out how to treat one in a future comic..."
Planetball,36kqlb,Guppyscum,2,Fri May 22 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"But they tend to be very diffuse to the extent that they wouldn't look like anything special or even discernible at all if you looked at them from far away   How would we even know? We can only see 13 billion light years in any direction; maybe they would look very discernible, if only we had all of the light we would need."
Planetball,36kqlb,UnFisico,3,Fri May 22 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"Your typical galaxy cluster is very small compared to the size of the universe - somewhere below 30 million lightyears in diameter. A supercluster might be ten times that large. So we can see them just fine from quite a large relative distance. Using visible light, they look like just a bunch of galaxies that happen to be near each other. It's only in other frequencies, like radio, that we can see the Intracluster Medium that forms the bulk of their contents and defines the boundaries of a cluster.  But I guess since this is silly comics there's no rule saying we have to be limited to visible emissions..."
Planetball,36kqlb,10gamerguy,2,Fri May 22 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"speculation powers activate What if there are extremely large objects, billions of light years across, that we don't even know about because we don't have the light?  There's no reason to expect that structures just don't happen once you get large enough, is there? I'd expect there to be structures of every size, no matter how large. (After all, for most of human history, the idea of something as large as a galaxy would have sounded implausible.)"

Planetball,34y286,Spacetime_Inspector,81,Tue May 5 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"Context: This is the 100% scientifically accurate depiction of how novae usually happen (except for the talking and the vomiting metaphor). When a star expands into a red giant, its outer layers often end up outside its Roche Lobes (the regions of space in which an object's mass is sufficient to keep it together despite outside influence). If the giant happens to be in a close binary orbit with a white dwarf (a star that ran out of fusible material and collapsed into a dense, warm core), the dwarf will siphon off some of the giant's mass with every pass it makes through the Roche lobes. This mass forms a veneer of hydrogen on the surface of the dwarf, and thanks to the extreme gravitational forces at the dwarf's surface this can sometimes result in fusion reoccuring all across its surface at once.   It's possible for this to be stable and sustainable, but the more likely situation is that the dwarf accrues hydrogen faster than it can fuse it, and soon the entire atmospheric shell collapses through all the stages of fusion, which normally take a lifetime of stellar activity to traverse, in just a few days, resulting in a release of all the potential energy in the dwarf's shell in one cataclysmic explosion. We call this explosion a nova. Sometimes they are so violent they destroy the equilibrium that birthed them, but other times, as in the comic, they just reset the system so it can happen all over again.  The title is a reference to the venerable PBS science show NOVA."

Planetball,34y286,Stalgrim,3,Wed May 13 01:02:50 2015 UTC,"Question: if this reset occurs is it a state of the system to self reproduce, essentially, infinitely? Or is each event different and they have a chance of destroying themselves with each nova?"
Planetball,34y286,ChocolateSawfish,3,Thu May 21 09:13:13 2015 UTC,"It's possible for it to reproduce a whole bunch of times - the system this comic is loosely based on, RS Ophiuchi, has gone nova every twenty years for at least the past century. But it won't go on infinitely. The system reaches one of two ends - either the amount of mass expelled by the nova (while very tiny) adds up enough to make the other star no longer massive enough to support the accretion of the white dwarf, OR, the more likely and fun option is that the amount of material left over on the dwarf's surface builds up and builds up with every nova, until it reaches the Chandrasekhar Limit (about 1.4 solar masses) and explodes way more violently in a Type 1a supernova that obliterates the dwarf and likely its partner as well."

Planetball,328dsy,Toby-one,12,Sat Apr 11 15:12:42 2015 UTC,"yeah in fact I think Geo is for ""ground""... Geo for ""Earth"" would be Terra.  I think.."
Planetball,328dsy,yaddar,8,Sat Apr 11 15:35:37 2015 UTC,Geo means the earth (Example: Geocentric model of the solar system). It is used as a prefix for stuff that is related to the earth and there are similar prefixes for the moon and the rest of the planets but I'm not sure if they are actually used to distinguish between stuff like Geology and Selenology.  Terra also means the earth but it also means landmasses like for example Terra Australis because it technically means dry land. There are actually large landmasses on other celestial bodies in our solar system which are called terra (terrae in plural). It can become confusing because they have the same meaning in some circumstances but they also mean different things.
Planetball,328dsy,House_of_Suns,5,Sat Apr 11 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"A lot the terminology is a bit fleeting. Take the concept of terraforming, once could interpret that as simply ""forming earth(i.e. landmasses)"" or making a world Earth-like."
Planetball,328dsy,Raumkreuzer,6,Sat Apr 11 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"well that's true.  I guess the problem is that, back them they didn't call the Earth a Planet.. (and they didn't know some bright dots in the sky were made of rocks) so ""Geo"" and ""Terra"" are very Earth-centric terms.  for me, in spanish we use ""geo"" mostly for rocks and ground sciences (except as in ""Geocentric"" like you pointe dout) and we use ""Tierra"" to name the planet Earth, so the derivate ""Terra"" is mostly planetary-related (like Terraforming)  I think ""moon geology"" would be a branch of Selenology overall... just as ""moon tempeature"" or ""moon orbit"""

For everyone who is wondering, Venus has the metal music make-up because it is one of the most metal planets in our solar system, with all that volcanic activity, acidic atmosphere and scorched surface.

Oh, and the cake is composed of three pieces: the asteroids in cake form, just like the asteroid flair, a cake like the surface of the Earth's Moon, and the bridge between them is the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko."

It was just kind of accepted. Recently, however, more and more scientists are saying it should be. And now, people are accepting Pluto as a planet again. That's fine and all, what I don't understand is why no one made a comic of this yet on r/Planetball. You'd think this would be the easiest event to make a comic out of, and with Twitter and other social media websites going crazy about it, I know I can't be the only one here who's heard this story. Technically, I suppose Pluto is still officially a dwarf planet, but who determines that? A bunch of scientists on Earth? They can't stop Pluto!  Also, in the party scene, you only see dwarf planets because most planets, like Earth, really don't care that much about whether or not Pluto is a planet."

Planetball,2b1va4,Lazerfeet,9,Sun Jul 20 03:42:25 2014 UTC,"In order to be roughly the same volume as pluto, Russia would need to take with it a depth of ~376km along with its surface area.  This is ~3% of the equatorial diameter of the earth, and would leave behind a hole 35 times deeper than the mariana trench, exposing the mantle (assuming russia took only land directly below its borders)."
Planetball,2b1va4,LucarioBoricua,5,Sun Jul 20 06:39:03 2014 UTC,"Would this mean that if Russia took with it all the clay and mantle and core below it, up to reaching Earth's physical center, it'd be a lot bigger than Pluto?"
Planetball,2b1va4,Lazerfeet,6,Mon Aug 11 04:07:08 2014 UTC,"There are multiple ways to interpret that question.  The center is just a point, so if Russia were to conservatively take with it a depth defined by the radial lines from earths center to its borders (so that it took a fair portion from each layer of earth, roughly speaking this is a ""cone"" with a base that is defined by Russias borders), it would have a volume of approximately 3.6 * 1013 m3, so it would be about 5.7 times larger than Pluto in volume."
Planetball,2b1va4,LucarioBoricua,2,Mon Aug 11 05:30:12 2014 UTC,Excactly as I envisioned it!  And the number is quite impressive.  By diameter that'd be 1.78 times bigger than Pluto.

Planetball,2a586y,bestur,2,Wed Jul 9 13:45:10 2014 UTC,"Nice hidden ""superba stronk"""
Planetball,2a0eoy,Medibee,28,Mon Jul 7 01:19:57 2014 UTC,"I really like the way you drew Earth here. The others as well, but yeah, Earth especially."
Planetball,2a0eoy,Hansafan,9,Mon Jul 7 06:01:15 2014 UTC,"Its crazy, its a bunch of scribbles and yet it looks so damn realistic!"
Planetball,2a0eoy,Halalaka,15,Mon Jul 7 22:41:15 2014 UTC,"Not sure what der context is, but I like the artstyle of the planets. The polandball-equivalent of photorealism it seems."
Planetball,2a0eoy,Fenrirr,12,Mon Jul 7 11:24:52 2014 UTC,"So Mars was a commie. Always knew the ""red planet"" sounded a little communist.  And btw wonderderful comic!"
Planetball,2a0eoy,last4entry,8,Mon Jul 7 12:44:21 2014 UTC,Nice allegory at the end
Planetball,2a0eoy,Sielgaudys,5,Mon Jul 7 07:42:39 2014 UTC,"I love the moon, it's so cute!"
Planetball,2a0eoy,Hashtag_Taha,2,Mon Jul 7 14:00:08 2014 UTC,I love how the map of the continents turned as the Earth faced different directions.
Planetball,29uhpt,feline_crusader,28,Fri Jul 4 19:04:44 2014 UTC,"Baking soda volcanoes are popular science fair projects, even creating life pales in comparison to the mighty Io!"
Planetball,29uhpt,calumj,13,Fri Jul 4 19:07:11 2014 UTC,I made Io for my science fair project. Safe to say Zeus was pretty mad after :(
Planetball,29uhpt,bestur,2,Fri Jul 4 23:06:02 2014 UTC,B-But muh Krakatoa!
Planetball,29uhpt,atomfullerene,10,Thu Jul 10 23:12:31 2014 UTC,Mars won with a volcano last year too.  Judges are biased.
Planetball,29uhpt,ProbablyNotLying,9,Sat Jul 5 03:33:47 2014 UTC,Based on the title I thought this was an /r/badhistory post for a moment.  HAIL VOLCANO
Planetball,29uhpt,KippLeKipp,4,Sat Jul 5 06:25:10 2014 UTC,based io will save us
Planetball,29uhpt,BTGr1,3,Sat Jul 5 12:14:05 2014 UTC,Dammit. This hits too close to home.  I built a wind tunnel for a science project once and it lost to a volcano
Planetball,29uhpt,agmaster,1 point,Sun Jul 6 09:27:49 2014 UTC,Volcanoes for the win!
Planetball,29tptp,penguins300,14,Fri Jul 4 13:29:58 2014 UTC,This was my contest entry in the last contest in Polandball. It won 8th place which is cool for my first contest so I hope you like it Reposted it because I accidentally put up the wrong comic before.  Context: Constellations don't look like what the name says it does  Edit: Sorry Mobile
Planetball,29tptp,Halalaka,3,Fri Jul 4 13:30:49 2014 UTC,"Context: Constellations don't look like what the name says it does   Ahhhhh. I thought this might have been due to the constellation appearing differently for Mars due to it different position and orientation from earths ""viewpoint"".  TIL."
Planetball,29tptp,TheHockeyist,7,Fri Jul 4 13:35:20 2014 UTC,I think it still looks the same in mars
Planetball,29tptp,OmegaVesko,5,Fri Jul 4 13:52:16 2014 UTC,It would look the same pretty much anywhere in the solar system. Even Sedna probably wouldn't notice a difference.
Planetball,29tptp,TheHockeyist,7,Fri Jul 4 15:49:29 2014 UTC,"It takes much more massive differences in position to visibly change the constellations. You could go to Alpha Centauri and it would still pretty much look the same, obviously with the absence of its own stars and the addition of Sol in the night sky."
Planetball,29tptp,theghosttrade,3,Fri Jul 4 16:53:52 2014 UTC,"A few constellations noticeably change shape, but you should still be able to navigate (more or less)."
Planetball,29tptp,Hansafan,1 point,Fri Jul 4 17:03:44 2014 UTC,still dun get it
Planetball,29t6n9,wifidudejj,8,Fri Jul 4 07:13:56 2014 UTC,That fifth panel took me a second to realise you're supposed to read from the bottom to the top.
Planetball,29t6n9,Colsta,1 point,Fri Jul 4 11:23:14 2014 UTC,Theia?  That's what it's called?  I didn't know it had a name.  Does the dinosaur-killer (now in in Mexico) have a name?
Planetball,29qq96,feline_crusader,19,Thu Jul 3 14:21:41 2014 UTC,"Binary stars are like beautiful dancers, elegantly moving together. Our star and celestial neighbours are… different."
Planetball,29qq96,TangleF23,5,Thu Jul 3 14:23:07 2014 UTC,What about those Trinary stars with planets?!
Planetball,29qq96,TangleF23,7,Thu Jul 3 15:34:12 2014 UTC,I've never heard of that before now! It must really suck for those planets.
Planetball,29qq96,Dentarthurdent42,4,Thu Jul 3 16:08:02 2014 UTC,"Well, they're partially fiction so-  Still, they're likely to exist. If a binary star system is at the centre- say F class and F class- with scorched planets, and then there's a trinary star far out that's a G class, it's possible there could be life on one of the G class planets."
Planetball,29qq96,TangleF23,1 point,Thu Jul 3 16:22:29 2014 UTC,Would it be possible for two smaller stars to orbit a larger star in conjunction?
Planetball,29qq96,wxns,2,Thu Jul 3 20:36:52 2014 UTC,"If you have one really massive star (soon to be black hole or already), yes. Not sure if we've found one yet, but Cygnus X-1 proves it's possible for at least one star."
Planetball,29qq96,SomberD,2,Thu Jul 3 21:43:12 2014 UTC,Hey! No bows for binary stars! Is Sun secretly of gender?
