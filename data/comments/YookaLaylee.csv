So is the underscore an 'extended character'? I would say no. Every character set includes the underscore I would have thought. It's not like ""ಠ"". But I'm not sure.

You had about 20 different ways to damage him, but you could use each only once, as he changes his tactics or does something to block that. It requires you to use all of your in game knowledge of you want to try every way to hurt him."

The first Ty the Tasmanian Tiger had a somewhat Banjo-Kazooie feel to it. A big Australian themed collect-a-thon where boomerangs are your main weapons.  Scooby Doo: Night of 100 Frights is a surprisingly solid platformer for a licensed Scooby Doo game. It has its problems, but I think it's an overlooked gem.  Pac-Man World 2 is a great 3D platformer set in a bunch of different environments in the Pac-Man universe.  Tak and the Power of Juju is about a shaman's apprentice trying to save a village from evil shaman. Lots of natural environments and is pretty free-roam.  Spongebob: Battle For Bikini Bottom is an amazing 3D platformer about robots invading Bikini Bottom. It sounds silly, but it works for Spongebob and plays really well."
YookaLaylee,3dsahn,Plokster52,2,Sun Jul 19 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for Spongebob.  Game is very structurally like Banjo-Kazooie, if slightly more linear. Pac-Man World 2 is also fantastic."

YookaLaylee,3dsahn,GrayMagicGamma,6,Sun Jul 19 01:57:58 2015 UTC,GOG is just as easy to use. And my brothers can play without using family sharing and taking up my Steam account.

YookaLaylee,3dsahn,nutntubear,6,Sun Jul 19 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"Psychonauts has a great story and is pretty solid all around except for a dip halfway through the game between a steady upwards difficulty curve and a massive difficulty ""spike"" that comes out of nowhere due to the past half of the game being so easy.  Jak and Daxter is pretty good, but instead of refining it in sequels they genre hopped. The sequels aren't bad (especially not the third game), they're just not what you're looking for in this thread.  Spyro 2 and 3 are pretty fun romps through colorful worlds, but make sure you avoid Spyro 3's game breaking bug, and if you don't, look up the level select cheat.  Grow Home is a very short but enjoyable game Ubisoft released out of nowhere. If you want to play a platformer that isn't over a decade old, this is one of your few choices.  Kiwi 64 is a short, free indie game based on BK. It's weird.  I hear the PS1 Crash games are good. I hated their PS2 successor, Wrath of Cortex, and never really gave the originals a solid chance."

YookaLaylee,3docol,ceribik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:49:53 2015 UTC,Could it be due to this?  http://i.imgur.com/uwPLgZJ.png  Notice there are two 20pound levels.
YookaLaylee,3docol,ceribik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:04:23 2015 UTC,I didn't upgrade or anything - I pledged through their Paypal page and it clearly states the PC version is included. I contacted them to hear what they know about it. :)
YookaLaylee,3docol,EggnogMan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:54:03 2015 UTC,"I'm in the exact same situation as you. If you click on the upgrade tier on the backer page, you can clearly see two different 20 pound options which are differently named (see pic).   If you switch to the other one, it will probably let you choose the PC version."

YookaLaylee,3docol,shyPiano,2,Fri Jul 17 23:47:48 2015 UTC,Have you pledged through Paypal too? Could it be that the £35.00 Paypal pledge is set up wrong?
YookaLaylee,3docol,Meduax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Paypal. If it's just a problem with the Paypal pledges then that explains why I don't see a lot more people complaining about this."

YookaLaylee,3dh6do,ilovegames4life,14,Thu Jul 16 06:15:13 2015 UTC,"Wii U, I trust Playtronic to give it the attention it deserves as anyone who owns a Wii U knows it can make really good graphics with some care and attention and I want to see what cool things they do with the gamepad."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Nidonocu,-2,Thu Jul 16 13:13:57 2015 UTC,"My only concern is that there is a history of games not getting DLC on the Wii U, but I trust that Playtonic will deliver"
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,aweshucks,5,Thu Jul 16 14:52:55 2015 UTC,There's no history of a developer promising DLC for a Wii U game and not delivering.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,GrayMagicGamma,10,Fri Jul 17 08:28:35 2015 UTC,"I was tempted to go with Steam, because Steam just seems the most logical option. Being able to log on wherever I am and start playing.  However, in my heart I have always been and always will be a Nintendo kid. I played the original Rare games on SNES and N64 almost two decades ago, now it seems appropriate to start playing Playtonic games on my WiiU."

I would like to wait until they announce the specs for each console (or if the gamepad will get some special treatment)"
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,BubbleWrapGenocide,3,Thu Jul 16 10:03:11 2015 UTC,PC has best graphics. It will do it justice.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Bamzooki1,3,Thu Jul 16 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"While Yooka-Laylee looks quite pretty, the graphics do not look like they would be difficult for any console to run properly.   I think it will look pretty much the same on any platform."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,labonted,5,Thu Jul 16 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"Wii U does an exellent job delivering graphics, especially bright and colorful graphics. Yooka Laylee's style perfectly fits Wii U imo."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Sandoz1,2,Thu Jul 16 20:13:20 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of good looking games on the Wii U, but it turns out that because of the streaming video to the pad actually takes some of the processing power. Which actually puts Wii U at a lower scope on terms of graphical power compared to the Xbox one and PS4.  The game experience should be about the same on all systems. I doubt playing on the Wii U will change that."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,CzarSquid,7,Fri Jul 17 03:20:13 2015 UTC,PC. I love PC.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Bamzooki1,8,Thu Jul 16 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"It didn't have a why option but I picked Xbox One because having Banjo-Kazooie, Tooie, Nuts & Bolts, and Yooka-Laylee all on one platform is going to be amazing."

I had trouble to decide at first between Wii U and PS4, using the pad screen would be nice, but I actually want to enjoy it on the big screen anyways. And if there is any chance, that the game looks more detailed and shiny with higher performence, I'd go with the PS4. On top, I like the to play with the DualShock controller more than on the ProController for the U."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Zankou55,3,Thu Jul 16 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"I made a second account for two copies.  Steam and Wiiu.   It makes more sense to play Playtonic's games on a Nintendo console,  but I want to be able to lend it to friends and keep it forever when the Wiiu dies."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,BuIbousaur,3,Thu Jul 16 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"I chose Steam, because:   Gaming on PC is just more convenient for me than on Wii U due to family members using the TV. If the game is optimised well, it will be the best performing platform on a technical level. It was cheaper."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Marxally,3,Thu Jul 16 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"As a BK succesor, it must be played on a Nintendo system. But hey, maybe if I upgrade my PC I might get it for Steam too!"
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Zankou55,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:52:27 2015 UTC,I did both.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Swerdman55,3,Fri Jul 17 13:02:31 2015 UTC,"I had a really tough time deciding between Wii U and PC. PC just made more sense considering I'm a PC gamer and I'm always at my PC.  But I went with the Wii U version. I'm a Nintendo gamer at heart and Yooka-Laylee just feels like it fits on a Wii U. Plus, I really want to see what can be done the gamepad. I'm also not worried about DLC. Smash and Mario Kart got DLC fine, and I'm sure Playtonic will manage to make it work."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Zionboy,3,Fri Jul 17 02:53:03 2015 UTC,I went with Wii U since I don't have a PS4 or Xbone. I will be getting this on PC as well when it actually comes out as I only backed it enough to get the console edition.  Yooka-Laylee is the type of game that's most suited for the Wii U. As the original Rare games were on the SNES and N64.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,SuperLufkin,2,Fri Jul 17 03:03:40 2015 UTC,"I'll get the PC boxed version, plus the Wii U version! I'll play the Wii U version, and probably keep the PC boxed version sealed!"
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,RobKhonsu,2,Thu Jul 16 14:31:19 2015 UTC,PC - Because I don't have any of the others.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Vinnyboiler,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:50 2015 UTC,I went with the Wii U copy. I also have a boxed PC version coming as well.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,MuffinAlibaba,2,Thu Jul 16 17:53:40 2015 UTC,Wii U because of off-tv play.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,TDWP_FTW,2,Thu Jul 16 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"Wii U.  I feel like it'll just feel more appropriate since Banjo started on Nintendo consoles.  If there's any version disparity later on though, I'll probably switch to Xbox One, because I do want the best experience possible."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,manbearkat,2,Thu Jul 16 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Haven't bought a console since the Wii, so I kinda have to go with PC.  Will the PC version have options to play with a controller or will it only be like a traditional PC game? Never got a PC controller before but it seems worth it for a game like YL."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Plokster52,2,Thu Jul 16 21:44:54 2015 UTC,WiiU because I've had it for 2 years and only have 4 games for it.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,CzarSquid,2,Fri Jul 17 00:38:50 2015 UTC,"PC for several reasons.   Years (decades) from now, I can still play Yooka-Laylee without worry of a particular console dropping support for backwards compatibility. Mod support. The toybox mode is for PC only as far as I know. Cheaper kickstarter reward than the console. Faster load times if you got the hardware.   That said, I'm sure Yooka-Laylee will be amazing on any system you play it on."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,mrbstro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:13:08 2015 UTC,"Well I understand what your saying. But if you've ever tried to run an application for win95 on windows 8, it gets a little funky for some of them. But I agree."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,CzarSquid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:50 2015 UTC,Yeah but thankfully its not too bad when it does get funky. The PC community is incredible and if something doesn't work and the game is really good then someone will find a fix for it. I don't think it be a problem though cause Unity works on most platforms these days.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Hurricane12112,2,Tue Jul 21 20:20:28 2015 UTC,Surprising with the amount of PC people...
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,AnarquistaLibre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:00:20 2015 UTC,"Me too! But Wii U is still big as expected. I think, one reason would be for the PC gamers, that a lot didn't buy a next gen console yet. Maybe a lot Nintendo people from back then couldn't sympathize with the leck of games at the launch of the Wii U."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,danSTILLtheman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:05:04 2015 UTC,"Being a PC gamer, I'd say I speak for many of us when I say the Wii U is about the only console worth owning. Nintendo exclusives will always be the best IMO. Can't wait for the new Legend of Zelda and I want a new Metroid Prime to come out so badly."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Papa_Shin,2,Sat Jul 18 23:52:54 2015 UTC,"Xbox one, the best case scenario for the Wii U is that it looks/performs the same as the other consoles. I'm afraid of missing out on something cool being done with the game pad and I feel like Yooka-Laylee should be played on a Nintendo console, I just can't justify buying it for the Wii U and risking it being the worst version."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,trevorsaur,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"I have the boxed edition for PC, and I'll also be getting a download code for the Xbox One. I considered getting it for my Wii U instead, but for some reason getting it on Xbox One just felt like the right choice."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Marshfellow,4,Tue Jul 21 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"I was all for the Wii U but now it seems that Nintendo is ready to leave it in the dust. I don't want my digital download to sit on a dead console, so I might go for PS4 instead."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,TheMightyCraken,11,Thu Jul 16 13:37:45 2015 UTC,What? The nx is years away... I'm sure Microsoft and Sony are both also already working on the next consoles
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,trevorsaur,3,Thu Jul 16 17:33:20 2015 UTC,"Why not on Xbox One so you could have all the classics (Banjo-Kazooie, Tooie, Nuts & Bolts from Rare Replay) + Yooka-Laylee on one console? Thats my plan."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,somephotographs,3,Thu Jul 16 13:59:36 2015 UTC,That's a good plan! I'd do that but I chose PS4 over XB1 :P My only regret is that I still have to pull out my N64 to play BK :(
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,connormxy,3,Thu Jul 16 14:23:08 2015 UTC,Get a cheap 360 and get BK+BT on there!

YookaLaylee,3dh6do,lostimage,2,Thu Jul 16 15:26:43 2015 UTC,PS4 All the way. Only because I can't stand my Wii U's game pad. Plus I like the Dualshock 4 over my old 360 pad for my PC.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,stormforce5,3,Thu Jul 16 12:05:22 2015 UTC,You know you are able to use your PS4 controller to play PC games right?  There are programs such as DS4Windows that make it appear as a 360 controller which is what I do.
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,MuffinAlibaba,2,Thu Jul 16 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"Even so, I'd rather get it for my ps4 so I am 99% sure that it'll work first time. Where as my pc isn't that good of a spec, so I wouldn't want to get for pc and then realise that it won't run on my machine."
YookaLaylee,3dh6do,Smitehades,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"PC because the consoles this generation are pretty disappointing to me, so I have none of them.  Also after I've played the game a million times, I'm interested to see what mods we get."

YookaLaylee,3dejbt,SuperLufkin,14,Wed Jul 15 18:06:21 2015 UTC,I LOVE Laylee's voice! So cute! I think I watched it like 20 times since Grant tweeted it!

YookaLaylee,3dejbt,RobKhonsu,8,Thu Jul 16 07:00:36 2015 UTC,The ending was awesome too aha
YookaLaylee,3dejbt,TameFlame,4,Wed Jul 15 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't get this ( sorry, never played Banjo-Kazooie :/ ), care to explain?"
YookaLaylee,3dejbt,RobKhonsu,7,Wed Jul 15 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"While they weren't pictured here, you needed a specific number of notes found all across levels to open those doors through the over world. However the golden Jiggies as pictured open up the actual levels.  So to better illustrate as you go through the overworld you have your first level that's in a small lobby and further progress is blocked by a note door. You collect both a bunch of notes and a few jiggies in the first level. Your bunch of notes will unlock that door in the overworld that gives you access to two or three more levels to unlock with your few jiggies. Further access to much more difficult levels is blocked by a much larger note door.  In other words you have a beginner lobby with one level that's free to enter. Then an intermediate lobby with a few levels, an advanced lobby with a few more levels. An expert lobby with the final levels, then the boss lobby."
YookaLaylee,3dejbt,Quadnot,10,Wed Jul 15 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"I think I understand; so in simpler terms Yooka and Laylee found an essential note for Banjos and Kazooies survival and progression, and thereby doomed them. Therefore the skeletons next to the note door?"
YookaLaylee,3dejbt,Papa_Shin,5,Wed Jul 15 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"Well there are 100 notes in each level and not all are required to finish. So they would have collected a bunch to render the game impossible to complete, but you get the point. :0"

It'll be funny to look back once we know more about what the characters are really gonna be like personality wise and see how different this probably is. But seeing the characters with their animations and personality showing makes me oozing with anticipation once again for this game even though it's cooled down news wise. Well done."
YookaLaylee,3dejbt,Senno82,7,Wed Jul 15 18:45:34 2015 UTC,Saw this tweeted by Grant Kirkhope. I went in expecting a shitty little amateur cartoon but was caught of guard and surprised by how non-shitty it was. I thought it was pretty funny and animated really well
YookaLaylee,3dejbt,wookiestackhouse,3,Wed Jul 15 22:55:35 2015 UTC,Only problem I have is that Trouser is a One-eyed Trouser Snake. Not just a trouser snake. Other than that this is perfect.
YookaLaylee,3dejbt,UnknownJ25,2,Thu Jul 16 15:39:16 2015 UTC,Haha - that is cute. The animation and voicing is top notch. Maybe Playtonic can use these guys for an attract video on the website or something.

If there's not one in the base game, I'd like to see a ""cliche-combiner"" world like what Hailfire Peaks did. Perhaps... Desert + Water? Halloween + Factory? Cave + Sky? So much room for invention.  I'd also love some sort of permanent transformation that you can bring between worlds, just like Dragon Kazooie in Banjo-Tooie. Thing is, Yooka probably would have waaaay too many moves intricately tied to the fact he's a chameleon, so maybe it would have to be Laylee. Perhaps bird Laylee? Wyvern Laylee? But then, what could those new forms bring...?"

YookaLaylee,3dccvc,Freddybone32,7,Wed Jul 15 04:29:50 2015 UTC,Having it go dry seems like the best thing for right now I think. We don't want it to become over saturated with fan art and music covers. It'll pick up immensely once the game is released

And to be fair, there's not much to talk about. All we can really do is fan-related stuff. And that'll die down by March next year at best.

YookaLaylee,3cfelg,Terryanny,37,Tue Jul 7 14:15:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of things that was put at downsides were things that I really like about Tooie. I love the darker tone, the sarcastic almost mean conversations that contrasted the cartoony characters, and the interconnected worlds. The feathers/eggs in one selection is much more convenient to me over having to run around just to refill my ammo, and while the Jiggy Get animation was cute and charming (and I loved that there was a unique one for getting all 10), when it plays every time it gets in the way of the gameplay. I'd much prefer just having one animation for getting all 10, personally.  However, I would agree that the notes were downplayed a little too much, and that the worlds were bigger (and a little less memorable) than they needed to be. There should've been more Jiggies to accommodate the larger sizes, since you do slog on for a while before getting them. I also see that it being literally darker (with the shadows) gets a little annoying when you're trying to navigate your way through.  While I personally prefer Tooie overall over Kazooie, I did feel like Kazooie was the shorter, butpurer, more fun experience, the distinction of which was nailed perfectly here. Thanks for sharing!"
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,Marshfellow,4,Tue Jul 7 16:33:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely! The interconnections was awesome and the darker tone was the absolute best. It reminds me of sondheim's into the woods (the was a sub par movie made recently of it) where the first act as all fairy tales and the second it gets... really really dark but still in a silly way
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,CaptainPorcupine2,3,Wed Jul 8 06:43:16 2015 UTC,"I recently finished watching a 100 percent Let's Play of Tooie, and it made me realize why the game ultimately bored me as a kid, even after I had adored Kazooie. It's really simple: In Kazooie, most the jiggies are rewards for either simply exploring the world, or solving a simple puzzle. In Tooie, most of the jiggies are rewards for either beating a bland minigame (seriously the number of lame minigames in Tooie is asounding) or performing a tedious fetch quest, whether it's literally picking up random items for an NPC, or fetching Mumbo for some single-button magic spell that presents no physical or cognitive challenge at all. Even more tedious are the split pads, which are a fetch quest in disguise, as they have you running back and forth and back and forth endlessly. Even the guy doing the Let's Play (NintendoCapriSun, who is a big fan of the game) couldn't help but frequently moan and groan about how tedious it all is.  There are just SO many times in the game where you KNOW what to do, and there's no real platforming or exploration challenge involved in the task you need to do, but you're forced to traverse some huge empty world anyway in order to do it."
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,CaptainPorcupine2,5,Fri Jul 10 02:04:46 2015 UTC,"I'm replaying Tooie right now, and a lot of what I'm finding is there are more mini-games than traditional gamplay, but it isn't devoid of platforming challenges, even if many are delegated to the main hub and earlier levels (Most of Mayahem Temple's Jiggies are completely exploration based).  I don't know if you guys have seen this, but Beta64 had a great interview with Playtonic. One thing I really appreciate him asking is which Banjo game they enjoyed more and why, and basically all of them said ""Kazooie"".   At first I thought, ""Aww, no Tooie love?"", but hearing them talk about how they plan on differentiating Yooka-Laylee from Banjo is by a few things:   More open world Pagie upgrade system   And one point in particular, in that, when they looked back at Kazooie, they found that the moves were something that was introduced, but not something you could reutilize in earlier levels as much. They instead want to give you more open access to movesets, and have each world utilize everything you can do. Banjo-Kazooie only really has the Speed Shoes in Freezeezy Peak as a backtrack kind of thing.  It was then that I realized that my favorite gameplay aspects of Tooie will basically make it into Yooka-Laylee, but perhaps with the better structure of Kazooie as a base. One thing I appreciate a lot about your criticism is that, while Tooie for me did a lot of daring ideas, they werent as fully realized. There were interconnected worlds, moves you needed to go back to worlds to use, and a darker, more alive space. But they are all...unrealized if left to be muddled by copious amounts of minigames (which I really found more prevalent going through Witchyworld especially) and fetch quests.   I feel like Tooie is still the more daring game, but perhaps the least successful because of it. It introduces new ideas, but it might not be until Yooka-Laylee that we'll get to see them used in a way that puts exploration and platforming first."
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,Merfen,3,Fri Jul 10 03:03:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the very thoughtful reply!  Witchyworld is definitely full of minigames, and Cloud Cuccoo Land might be even worse. That world is little more than hopping from floating island to floating island to play the minigame on each one. There are a couple of non-minigame jiggies, but not that many, I don't think any of them are exploration-based. What a waste of an awesome theme for a world!"
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,akadros,3,Fri Jul 10 03:36:25 2015 UTC,"I knew the first time playing Tooie that I didn't particularly like Cloud Cuccoo Land, but never quite knew why, that might be the ""why""!   I do prefer Tooie's more imaginative themes, it's just a shame they're hit and miss in terms of execution. Perhaps Mayahem Temple's more mixed design is a result of it being a level out of Kazooie originally?"
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,Petertwnsnd,2,Fri Jul 10 04:24:56 2015 UTC,"The animation thing only niggled me because you really do have to slog to get them, I wanted just a tiny something to just allow you to sit back and relish that fact that you got the damn thing!  But I guess if you know how to get each Jiggy already and just replaying, then the animation would get annoying! Maybe they should of just added different alternating animations, or the ability to switch them off! (Is thatpossible in N64 days)  And for all your other points, DAMMIT FOR MAKING IT MORE ELOQUENT THAN MINE!!!"
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,Merfen,3,Wed Jul 8 01:44:05 2015 UTC,"Aw shucks, thanks! I love hearing dissenting opinions on game's I love, no sarcasm at all in that. It's interesting to see things from a lens of what's different, and what might turn off or draw in players. I definitely think that there's pros and cons to the animation details, on the one hand it was probably a godsend for speedrunners, but it also adds a nice rest note to gameplay.  One thing that I do see that make Kazooie stand out so well is that no space was wasted. It was filled with an enemy, a note, an egg, an NPC, everything was detailed in each and every level. I finished Kazooie after Tooie, and I walked away feeling completely happy 100% the game. Tooie...it's a bit more of a struggle. It does waste more space than Kazooie for the sake of bigger worlds. Still, I think it was an admirable and even daring sequel idea. Most sequels I think are better than the first (like you pointed out) because they polish what was already there. Like Sonic 1 thru Sonic 3, there's an evolution of polish to both the level design and the gameplay.  Kazooie...was already nearly perfect. Rather than just give players more of the same, they dared to do something different. Bigger, maybe to its detriment, but also darker. Older (even in Banjo's combat skills, now relying on Kazooie more, and his deeper voice!). Funnier. More connected, and even more alive. There's more NPCs that don't feel like they're just there, but they're living there, from the shacks in Jolly Rodger's Bay, to the Mayahem Temple denizens who guard gold and play kickball. Characters have living spaces, and something that was a small note in Kazooie with Mumbo's Hut and a few living quarters like the Beaver in Click Clock or Boggy's Igloo show up in almost every level. There's people who are just as concerned with their jobs, homes, and pointless lives as there are mindless goons out to kill you, and that's really rare for a platformer and is probably my favorite part of Tooie.  If Yooka-Laylee takes how alive Tooie felt, with the level of focus and detail Kazooie has, heck, it could even match or surpass its older inspiration. I think Pagies expanding worlds are a sign they may instead have worlds that end up the size of Tooie when complete, but have the level of polish of Kazooie's world's throughout, and that idea is really exciting. Thanks again for an awesome video (and your kind words) to get us talking about the older games that'll hopefully inspire Y-L in all the right ways! :)"
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,manbearkat,13,Wed Jul 8 03:00:29 2015 UTC,"Until this video I had no idea BT was less liked than BK. Personally I played BT first then BK a few years later and found it to be too small in comparison to BT. A lot of the negatives he went over were actually improvements in my eyes, like the more complicated world linking. I found it fun when I went around trying to figure these all out and it was rewarding as hell when you finally got them to work. It almost feels like whatever one you played first is going to be your favourite as this youtubers stated he started with BK and BT did not live up to his expectation, meanwhile I felt the opposite, BK seemed much smaller and like it had less to do than BT."
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,Petertwnsnd,13,Tue Jul 7 17:20:34 2015 UTC,It almost feels like whatever one you played first is going to be your favourite   Not for me.  I played BK first and absolutely loved it.  But I love BT even more.  I absolutely agree with your other points.
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,infinitelives,7,Tue Jul 7 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"Until this video I had no idea BT was less liked than BK.   That's because it's not. I don't know where he got that impression other than pulling it out of his ass, but I've never seen someone complain the the first one was better. Every single person I know or have seen online that has played Banjo-Kazooie has also known about and/or played Banjo-Tooie and has said it's better."
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,usernumber36,3,Wed Jul 8 00:06:41 2015 UTC,At least I am not the only one. In my group of friends BT was better received as well.
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,usernumber36,2,Wed Jul 8 00:57:21 2015 UTC,"It's not really complaining I would say though. I fully admit that Banjo Tooie is a 'better game' because it allowed to improve on everything!  But most person I've heard, met and talked to about it would say there was just something about the original that pulls them back to it. I found that strange because I had the same opinion but I couldn't figure out why. I would happily play Ratchet and Clank 3 over Ratchet and Clank 1 because of its improvements. But something happened in BT that completely turned me (and others I've talked to) off.   But that impression could be out of my ass too :3"
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,manbearkat,3,Wed Jul 8 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"I liked BK more too and I think it's because of how simple it is. It's innocent like a child's book or dream (which is what BK was originally based off of with Project Dream).   BT moves away from that and tries to explore the BK world by going outside Gruntilda's castle. It's kinda like ""leaving home"" and growing up I guess. It does create a different tone like you said.   Obviously there is no quantitative difference between the two themes that makes one better than the other (it depends on personal preference), but BT's complexity does hurt it at times which is why I like the original better."
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,Hideous,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:59:40 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying your were complaining, but you talked about other people saying the first game was better.  I have no idea who you've been talking to but the consensus that Banjo-Tooie is ""overlooked"" or that the first one is considered better by most is ridiculous. I don't claim to know everything every thinks or feels about the game, but in every discussion I've EVER heard about the game, be it in the Nintendo Community, Rare Community, Yooka-Laylee community, or even gamin community in general Banjo-Tooie is not only considered to be one of the best video game sequels of all time, but easily one of the best games on the Nintendo 64. There's been more chatter around Banjo-Kazzoie in general lately as well with the Smash Ballot, Yooka-Laylee, and Rare Replay all being in the news lately the Banjo-Kazooie franchise has been talked about a ton recently and in all of that I have still not seen any people, let alone most people, saying Kazooie was better than Tooie."
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,hittes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:52:24 2015 UTC,"It almost feels like whatever one you played first is going to be your favourite   I don't think that part is necessarily true for everyone.  It's true that Banjo-Kazooie is the one I played first, and is also my favorite, but I attribute that to the lighter tone and upbeat music, which appeals more to me in every game ever and has nothing to do with the order I played the games in.  I prefer Saints Row to Grand Theft Auto for the same reasons, and I got hooked on Grand Theft Auto first."
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,simozx,5,Tue Jul 7 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"only thing in this review I can really agree with is the notes thing. They did reduce the notes too much, and I didn't like the nests thing. But it was necessary once they removed the mechanic of having to get all 100 in a single stage, which is actually what I think is one of kazooie's best and most unique features. Doing notes that way rewards skill of the player as opposed to their problem solving ability, and rewarding skill is VERY hard to do in a 3d collectathon outside of isolated mini-games. Banjo rewarded you for being skilled at the meaty part of the game with the notes system and I loved it. It also gave an incentive NOT to lose a life, which was something tooie utterly lacked. Why care if you're low on health if you lose nothing from death? But with the huge worlds of tooie that great system was impractical, so it was gone. Which is a shame, because I love tooie's big, integrated worlds with long challenging puzzles. They compensated for the difficulty by requiring you to find less of the jigsaws to finish the game, and making the puzzles longer gave you more play time and triggered your exploration and investigation and putting the pieces together, as opposed to kazzoie, which was just a matter of covering all the ground in the world. The interconnectivity of the world blew my mind too, and I don't think the difficult puzzles ruined that. I think including that and building on it almost lets you lead into something like what super metroid achieves: the way that a skilled player can reach some areas sooner than the path a novice follows. For example in tooie you can learn hatch before ever opening terrydactyland if you're good enough. But unfortunately that's about the extent of it. They way they've been talking about Yooka Layle I'm optimistic they're planning on building on that potential."
YookaLaylee,3cfelg,manbearkat,4,Tue Jul 7 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with note collecting is that the punishment is just so high for losing a life. You can easily take anywhere from 15 mins to 40 mins collecting notes, only to have to do it all over again. Some might like that challenge, but I think for the majority it's a little unfair to have such a steep challenge for every level. The downside to losing a life is already adequate enough, you lose your life, you have to go back to the beginning of the level.   I'd just much rather have the difficulty be about traversing the land and making your way through the world. Losing a life means you have to retry whatever puzzle you were working on to get a Jiggy, and I think that's totally fair since it doesn't take exorbitantly large amounts of time to get to wherever a Jiggy is. It punishes the player even in Tooie, but it doesn't take away a big chunk of time to redo what you lost. There's still incentive to keep your health up in multiple scenarios, especially those that reduced your health bar, like splitting B-K up to get Kazooie's Inferno Jiggy in Witchyworld. 4 hits or so and you're dead, and those little sliding buggers are hard to avoid without the right timing. That was a perfect way to use health in a meaningful way that didn't just take all the challenge out. I wouldn't have minded if they booted you back to the beginning of the level instead of just to the last Split Up Pad, but it's still adequate enough to focus on just the puzzle ahead of you."

YookaLaylee,3bvpea,Pno24,8,Thu Jul 2 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"Banjo-Tooie was my favorite between all the Rare games because of the NPCs and how they made the world's feel believable. It gave me an extra bit to look forward to, seeing what kind of world the next one would be, who would be living there, and how they would interact with B-K. This was helped because it felt like each level was truly interconnected to each other. There weren't just platforms, there were houses and stores and varied landscape that fit in to the hub's location.  If there's one thing I want them to take away from Tooie, it's at least the element of a ""lived in"" world, rather than just a space for collectibles and platforming."

And Galaxy usually has a lot of different planets and such in the background. The 2nd Galaxy was like how you're describing though, as is 3D World.  I do know what you mean though, I understand why you feel that way and you're right about Banjo and DK64 seeming more living and breathing.   The level Playtonic has showed off is not going to be recognizable in the final product as they've stated, and if you've seen the hub world, you can see it's enclosed much like Banjo and DK64.

YookaLaylee,3bdnxw,simozx,2,Sun Jun 28 06:00:13 2015 UTC,"Big fan of Banjo Kazooie, and so am looking forward to Yooka-Laylee! After finding out about Tooka-Laydee (a tribute game by Owlstice Games), and completing it a couple times, I wanted to do an amatuer speedrun of it. Speedruns of Banjo-Kazooie are incredible, which makes me curious to see how Yooka-Laylee will go.  Because there are no existing speedruns for this, I didn't know what would entitle as a completion of the game, so I made up some rules:   Collect all 7 Pages Learn all 3 moves from the Red Snake Guy (Collect 20+40+20+30 Coins) Capture all 5 Creatures Read Big Book, and play as Tumble Dryer Collect all 7 Pages as Tumble Dryer Read Big Book for final credits   There are 117 Coins in total. To buy Flutter, you'll need 20. To buy Roll, you'll need 40 + Page. To buy Tongue, you'll need 20. Additionally, to get your Page back, and initiate the Big Book, you'll need 30. So really, you only need to collect 110 Coins to progress successfully.  If you also Capture all 5 Creatures, the credits will finish and start a second game, playable as a Tumble Dryer which you can also collect Pages and Coins. Once all 7 Pages are collected, you can read the Big Book again to get the final credits. I'm not sure if the Tumble Dryer should have been included, but it did complete the game, and gave incentive to Capture the 5 Creatures.  I started and ended the time when the player started interaction, and when the final button was pushed to complete the game. And so, time starts when you press 'Space' to begin playing, and time ends when you push 'Space' to enter the final credits.  I had completed the game a couple times beforehand, and decided to go for it. I didn't really make an extensive route or strategy, and so this is really just me playing it quickly. I had spare time and wanted to do this for fun, and clearly it can be done quicker. I'll get around to smashing that time soon. Hope you enjoy it.  EDIT: I made an overlook of the whole map here: http://i.imgur.com/BnjhSy9.jpg - Yeah, paint quality, literally. This will break it all down, and so a proper route and strategy can be made."

The last paragraph is about he expectations but he dosnt even seem to have read all of the kick starter page or seen many of the images as most of his information on the project only seems half researched and as he says both BK and YL have the same art style, which is wrong they are similar but the SAME!?  Garbage article, dont both reading."

YookaLaylee,3azkd7,TheFaustin,14,Wed Jun 24 19:40:42 2015 UTC,Grant is probably my favourite person in the video game industry. I never had the chance to really talk to him but he often responded me on Twitter and even retweeted/favourited some of my tweets before. He's awesome!
YookaLaylee,3azkd7,stormforce5,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:27:30 2015 UTC,"He's funny too, even if he doesn't think so himself."
YookaLaylee,3azkd7,P13666,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"He also think that he's not that good at making music, which I think it's sad... I don't like when people think too much of themselves and I love that Grant isn't like that, but he IS a great composer. His Kingdom of Amalur music is amazing and should be up there with movie music like John Williams'. It's not because he makes video game music that his music isn't as good as movie music...  But also I have zero knowledge in music, so I probably don't know what I'm talking about...  He also thinks that he speaks too fast and nobody understands him which is funny because my first language isn't English and I can understand him perfectly!"
YookaLaylee,3azkd7,CoolGuySean,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:20:45 2015 UTC,"I think he knows people likes his music, so I'm sure if I'd say he thinks he's a bad composer, but he definitely doesn't put himself on a pedestal by any means.  He definitely seems like a genuinely humble guy from what I've seen in interviews (this is probably my favorite one, funny you mention because they do talk about John Williams a little bit!). It also seems to be a bit of a cultural thing, the British don't like to talk themselves up as much as Americans.   I love how open he is with the fans, even lesser known YouTube channels or people sharing stuff with him on Facebook."
YookaLaylee,3azkd7,MuffinAlibaba,5,Sat Jun 27 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree with Grant being generally great. The only interaction I've had was posting the Freezeezy Peak music and stating I wanted to do an arrangement of it which he liked, meaning I showed up in his news feed and he dug it. Very minor but very cool."
YookaLaylee,3azkd7,bashothebanana,3,Thu Jun 25 04:45:34 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat unrelated but before Game Grumps had him on their show JonTron geeked out big time about GKH. He gave nebulous ""I LOVE YOU GRANT"" speech out during one of his early playthroughs of Banjo Kazooie and I thought nothing would come of it.  A little while after.. he showed up on their show. This was right when GameGrumps became a ""thing"" and it was still in its infancy.  I thought his appearance was pretty telling in his involvement in his fans and the Internet community at large. It made me really happy."
YookaLaylee,3aweyj,StripedOtter,4,Wed Jun 24 01:19:27 2015 UTC,"When Kickstarter says the funds are denied, they won't try again. Kickstarter gives up and waits for you to say you're ready to try again. This should be detailed in the email you got - the same happened to me because during the campaign, I moved across country and my old billing address was no longer tied to my credit card. I updated the information on kickstarter, pressed the button to retry the payment, and it succeeded, and now the kickstarter says I'm a backer again.  Edit: You only had 7 days after the end of a kickstarter to do this, though. So sorry this method is outdated."
YookaLaylee,3aweyj,AdeonWriter,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"Playtonic didn't say for how long Paypal will be available exactly, but not for very much longer. It will probably be removed very soon..."

YookaLaylee,3aweyj,Guvante,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:19:59 2015 UTC,It probably posted today. CC transactions are a multiple step process.

YookaLaylee,3as5ry,Pno24,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:27:45 2015 UTC,The payment failed. There's a solution in the Kickstarter FAQ somewhere.
YookaLaylee,3ar3zx,Klonoak,3,Mon Jun 22 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Most Prepaid gift cards don't work internationally. So if you bought the visa gift card in the USA, it would not work for kickstarter projects such as Yooka-Laylee that are not in the USA. I have had this problem with the Google Wallet Card."
YookaLaylee,3ar3zx,comrad5055,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:54:29 2015 UTC,"I had read up a little on these cards and I figured that because kickstarter was based in the USA that it would work.  It didn't cross my mind that the money is probably going directly to playtonic though, so that makes sense as to why it won't go through.  I'll try to find another way to fix my pledge.  Thanks for the help."
YookaLaylee,3ar3zx,Spinal83,2,Mon Jun 22 23:53:52 2015 UTC,"From what I read on Kickstarter's support page, if you use a prepaid credit card, you need at least 1$ more on it than the amount pledged to run a test authorisation thing (won't be charged), whatever it is. Are you sure that you have at least 1$ more?    Otherwise, you probably should contact Kickstarter's support."
YookaLaylee,3aojsf,ChaosCreeper59,9,Mon Jun 22 05:31:56 2015 UTC,"I'm getting the game for PC, so I would love this. But if PC exclusively got it then I think it would only be fair to others if they could play on the levels at least, or get a creator for themselves at most. If not I don't think it'd be wise to divide us like that on their first game :/  But a level creator would be freaking awesome!"
YookaLaylee,3aojsf,stormforce5,7,Mon Jun 22 05:34:40 2015 UTC,"Heyyy. It's a breath of fresh air to see a PC gamer online who doesn't have an irrational hatred of people who play on consoles. So that's neat!  Honestly, I think if they could make a simple enough editor, all platforms could use it. During the Xbox/PS2 era, there were a lot more games that had level editors from Tony Hawk games to Pariah to whatever. But maybe that should be a feature for a sequel.  Again, just gonna plug my idea of Yooka-Laylee: Nails and Screws where you build your own levels in addition to Playtonic's levels."

YookaLaylee,3aojsf,The_Lightkeeper,8,Tue Jun 23 02:00:58 2015 UTC,"I do not think this is a good idea. I don't think the game will need it and I also think you vastly under-appreciate the amount of work that would have to happen for this to be possible.  The game is made in Unity, what if some significant part of the level creation process takes place within Unity's editor? This is one small issue of many."
YookaLaylee,3aojsf,Kasc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:24:01 2015 UTC,"So what if editing takes place in Unity's editor? Why is that a bad thing?  Making levels for Unreal Tournament takes place in UnrealEd, making levels for Half-Life/Counterstrike/etc. takes place in Hammer. I don't see the problem..."
YookaLaylee,3aojsf,Spinal83,3,Mon Jun 22 06:07:45 2015 UTC,"Hammer and Unity are entirely different beasts. Hammer is a pure level editor whilst Unity is where you build your entire game.   I have not had experience with UE, but for Unity you would either need to expose a lot of your inner code to the public, or recreate a dummy prefab for any placeable object in your game.   Put simply, Unity was not designed to let you use it as a level editor after the game is already compiled."
YookaLaylee,3aojsf,Kasc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:23:58 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with Unity, so I did not know that you have to expose any code. In UE, you don't have to do that AFAIK. It can definitely be used as level editor after the game is completed and it can really add to the experience."
YookaLaylee,3aojsf,Spinal83,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have some sort of 3d model importer, would be perfect to test out my hopes and dreams of creating a 3d platformer level designs!"

Since the game is multiplatform though I doubt it'll be a ""must use"" feature, but it might be fun for you guys. Who knows?"
YookaLaylee,3aojsf,stormforce5,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:00:23 2015 UTC,"For the Wii U gamepad it should essentially be the pause menu, showing health, ammo, number of collectibles found or collectibles that needed to be found, and a minimap."

YookaLaylee,3agm3i,wasniahC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"I'm also kinda more excited for Yooka Laylee. Fallout 4 will most likely be utterly rad, but Yooka Laylee looks so colorful and fun, I can't help but be thrilled for it."
YookaLaylee,3agm3i,Ketsu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:45:57 2015 UTC,They will likely keep you on a list of people who are getting the keys. Just like how they are going to distribute the game codes themselves (via e-mail most likely) you will likely get the DLC keys in the exact same way.
YookaLaylee,3agm3i,MuffinAlibaba,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:38:58 2015 UTC,Hmmm...that is a real tough call. I am extremely excited about both games. It certainly has been a longer wait for Yooka-Laylee but damn I love me some Fallout.  I will spend hours upon hours in both.
YookaLaylee,3agm3i,IHideMyBlade,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:40:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'll ever pick up Fallout 4. I'll play it if one of my brothers get it, but I'm an open-source fan, I really believe in all that, so the only closed-source games that I can really justify paying money for are DRM-free games. Yooka-Laylee is coming to GOG.com so works for me."

YookaLaylee,3aekn4,Live-Hedgehog,4,Fri Jun 19 15:02:59 2015 UTC,Source? I hadn't heard any news of minecart gameplay.
YookaLaylee,3aekn4,AVileBroker,9,Fri Jun 19 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"It was a stretch goal. It actually blatantly says ""a mix of 2.5 and 3D"" on the kickstarter so this thread is pointless haha"
YookaLaylee,3aekn4,connormxy,3,Fri Jun 19 15:14:50 2015 UTC,"Probably a lot like Banjo-Tooie, right?"
YookaLaylee,3aekn4,Secret_Wizard,9,Fri Jun 19 17:27:10 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so. Banjo-Tooie's minecart was an unholy button-mash-fest against the spawn of Satan.  I'm thinking they'll be like a mix between DKC's take and DK64's."

YookaLaylee,3aekn4,Secret_Wizard,5,Sat Jun 20 03:49:27 2015 UTC,"There are two secrets to beating Canary Mary. The first is to exploit the rubber-band AI, and keep slightly behind her until the final stretch, then suddenly mashing with all your might to pull ahead. The second is to just pause the game when your fingers get tired."
YookaLaylee,3aekn4,Firocket1690,4,Sat Jun 20 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"Or you could not be a coward and power through. You can win by mashing as fast as possible. :D  Edit: to be on topic with the original question, I think the possibilities would be old school DKC, DK64, and DKCR, the last of which has a back/foreground. While DKCR looks pretty I personally hope it will be the old style DKC, as there are less distractions. I really don't like things 'coming out of the background' and hitting you."

YookaLaylee,3a87zt,NaClO_Official,16,Thu Jun 18 03:09:05 2015 UTC,"Probably because the swimming is not implemented yet and they where told by Andy to not bother. Like we saw briefly in this video, they would just go through the water because it's just a non-solid floor..."

YookaLaylee,3a87zt,Zankou55,0,Thu Jun 18 10:48:55 2015 UTC,the whole video was just so unfunny though
YookaLaylee,3a87zt,Indigoh,-1,Thu Jun 18 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"I think what he's referring to is Nuts and Bolts, where they ditched the collectathon for some stupid racing game after making that remark.   ""The worst thing I've ever seen"" describes Nuts and Bolts perfectly."
YookaLaylee,3a87zt,Zankou55,4,Thu Jun 18 16:50:10 2015 UTC,I was specifically referring to the way the portrayal of the characters in the intro to Nuts and Bolts was derogatory and insulting to the previous work of the company and the intelligence of its fans.
YookaLaylee,3a87zt,Indigoh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:39:09 2015 UTC,Yeah. It was part of why that game is so disliked. We all made it pretty clear that we wanted more Banjo Kazooie. That we really liked that stuff. So they responded by telling us what we wanted was dumb and gave us something awful instead.
YookaLaylee,3a87zt,Zankou55,2,Thu Jun 18 20:49:58 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that, when the Rare replay comes out, I shouldn't play Nuts and Bolts?"
YookaLaylee,3a87zt,viddy,7,Thu Jun 18 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"Ignore Indigoh, he sounds like a petulant child. Nuts & Bolts is a good game, people just get pissed because they think it shouldn't have been a Banjo Kazooie title. Rare itself didn't think what gamers wanted was dumb, they were pushed by Microsoft to go the direction they did, and parodied that frustrating situation in the dialog.  Try out the game without any expectations of what you think it should be and you may enjoy it."
YookaLaylee,3a87zt,DigRatChild,4,Thu Jun 18 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you ignorant toddlers actually PLAYED Nuts and Bolts, you'd begin to realize that LOG is just symbolizing Microsoft and it's ""collectathons are bad, yo"" attitude."

YookaLaylee,3a9mae,gilthoniel,6,Thu Jun 18 09:13:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know about BK and BT budget and I don't know if we'll ever know it, but before making comparison, let's keep in mind that +/- 45% of the amount goes to paying taxes, business costs, reward fulfillment, payment processing and Kickstarter fees. So only around £1,100,000 goes to the game itself.    There's also personal and other kind of funding that they had before the Kickstarter that we don't know about."
YookaLaylee,3a9mae,BloodChicken,4,Thu Jun 18 10:54:36 2015 UTC,"Closer to 55% but the point all the same.  But I would imagine that the Banjo Kazooie games cost a fair bit more than what Playtonic received through Kickstarter. Double, maybe even triple would be my guess if not more.  The main difference being that they would've had a publisher behind them to front that money.  I don't think exact numbers are out there at the moment but making a game is a lot more expensive than most people think. I have no doubt that Playtonic have a sizeable budget that they went into with, enough to make the game at least. The Kickstarter was a way for them to build hype, make pre-sales and potentially get the attention of other interested parties.  For comparison, Psychonauts (another 3D platformer) took 5 years to make and Playtonic are planning on finishing in just under 2. Double Fine said that making a sequel to Psychonauts would take about $15-18 million. So lets say about 6 Million would be the rough amount of money Yooka-Laylee will cost total on the low end of the scale? Probably closer to 5 since it won't be as storyline and cutscene heavy and cutting things like voice acting."
YookaLaylee,3a9mae,BlueHarpBlue,2,Thu Jun 18 12:59:12 2015 UTC,you've also got to take into account that BK started as a completely different game. who can say how much of the ground work was finished during Project Dream
YookaLaylee,3a9mae,alejandro240,4,Thu Jun 18 16:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's another thing. At the time the team was much less experimented and toyed around concepts and ideas, going through two games, before finishing Banjo-Kazooie.    Playtonic is now much more experimented and they know (more or less) exactly what they are doing, so they won't lose money for toying around. Also, they don't need to spend money on making their own engine, which is a big thing too. They are also making some personal sacrifices, like being payed less than normal in the industry, etc...    I personally think that we can't really compare the two because it is so two completely different things."
YookaLaylee,3a9mae,Injuredism,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:20:27 2015 UTC,"You also have to remember that they don't need the approval for anything they do in their game since they don't have a publisher, which means the game making process is a faster than most."
YookaLaylee,3a9mae,mrgrandgrind,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:02:48 2015 UTC,I imagine that inflation also drastically changes the financial comparison.
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,shyPiano,13,Wed Jun 17 11:53:00 2015 UTC,"Ahhhhh! I was waiting for new gameplay, finally seeing some! It's the same level that was shown before, though. Movement seems really fluid and fun, I love it!  I'm really sad we didn't get to see gameplay in the Hub yet! :( Such a tease, being there in the menu and all, and still no gameplay!  The end was hilarious! :D"
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,GrayMagicGamma,15,Wed Jun 17 12:12:28 2015 UTC,"They improved the level a bit though! The textures are a bit better, there's new trees and some grass!    And I think it's better if they don't show the levels too much. I don't want the levels to be spoiled. I'd prefer to play the game completely blind... I even have the feeling that this level will be the one on the Toybox-demo thing and won't even be in the game."
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,metroideye,3,Wed Jun 17 12:33:19 2015 UTC,"Hub worlds are highly susceptible to change over the development of a game. Imagine if we saw Grunty's Lair before they came up with Witch Switches, Mario 64 before caps, or Spyro 3 before adding Moneybags and egg thieves."
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,GrayMagicGamma,2,Wed Jun 17 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"They showed Grunty's Lair as the Giant's Lair waaaaaay back before Grunty existed. A few seconds of footage exists of it, actually."
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,donpianta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:49:13 2015 UTC,"It's been confirmed that that's not Giant's Lair, it's Mount Fire Eyes, many of whose concepts were realized in the fire side of HFP."

YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,BigPoofyHair,8,Wed Jun 17 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"I hope the proper levels have a more organic feeling than this one. Also not keen on the sound effect of those coins, but other than that it looks great."

YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,CinEther,8,Wed Jun 17 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"Don't murder me here, and I know we didn't see the full level, but I don't like the level design. It looks fantastic, but most of the B-K, SM64, etc. levels had 'paths'. Basically you could see every bit of the level by following a single path. (maybe there was a 'back yard' area where you had to branch away to get to. This just looks like a giant open area with obstacles thrown in. (AKA Every world from Nuts and Bolts.)  Also, the theme is dull in my opinion."
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,JubJub87,11,Wed Jun 17 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"This is most probably a fancy early test level. It have pretty much everything an early test level has : some enemies to test AI, some simple platforms and moving platforms to test jumping, slopes to test the slopes limits, water to test the swimming, etc... It probably won't appear on the final game or it will be changed immensely. Banjo-Kazooie also had test levels but they were not as fancy because they didn't have to do a Kickstarter! :P   I have the impression they will probably use it for the Toybox demo for backers."
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,BigPoofyHair,3,Thu Jun 18 00:12:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, the level design for this level isn't that amazing. It might be a temporary level for prototyping though. :)"

YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,Darth_Dio,2,Wed Jun 17 17:30:51 2015 UTC,I feel like the lighting is a little oversaturated but other than that the game looks great. It looks as good as N&B looked. Say what you will about the game play but N&B was visually stunning.
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,Anonymouse753,2,Wed Jun 17 18:22:33 2015 UTC,Looks better than Mighty No. 9! Can't wait! Everything other than the eye animations look more smooth than before.
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,stormforce5,2,Wed Jun 17 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"Not trying to start a war here, but I agree. Might No.9 just looks a little too bland to me. At least from what I've seen."
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,Anonymouse753,2,Thu Jun 18 22:23:47 2015 UTC,This game is going to be AMAZING.

YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,Seepy_,2,Wed Jun 17 16:26:35 2015 UTC,I can't tell the difference between their voices. Maybe my ears just suck :(
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,stormforce5,3,Wed Jun 17 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't be so hard on yourself! They're both voiced by Chris Sutherland, so they do sound a little similar. To clarify, Yooka's voice is heard when he is jumping, and at the beginning and end of his rolling animation. You can hear it in the first couple of seconds in this segment. On the other hand, Laylee can be heard during the gliding animation, as well as during the rolling animation. (She's panting from running along Yooka's back!) The gliding sound can be heard here - keep in mind that Yooka makes his jumping sound first - and both of their rolling sounds can be heard pretty well here. I hope this helps!"
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,Pno24,3,Wed Jun 17 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"Wow it actually got pretty easy to tell them apart after that! Thanks, I was just expecting them to be as different as Banjo and Kazooie's voices, so I guess I wasn't listening hard enough."
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,supamesican,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:21:47 2015 UTC,"Somehow I really wish that Yooka didn't blend into the grass that much... Looks like it would be hard to see him against it sometimes.  Annoyingly, the only way I can see around that would be to change his colour to something more striking such as yellow. This is unlikely to change though due to Playtonic having already set up the whole green/purple thing.  Ahh well... I can just hope that the majority of the game isn't set on freakin grass."
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,Haddy95,5,Wed Jun 17 18:45:00 2015 UTC,Well he IS a chameleon.  Sorry.
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,supamesican,2,Thu Jun 18 22:22:28 2015 UTC,It's very easy to tell the difference..  Edit: Welp I guess I'm the only person here who's not color blind then.
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,Haddy95,2,Wed Jun 17 19:50:45 2015 UTC,I can tell. There aren't fifty shades of green there but theres a few.
YookaLaylee,3a5jfy,Saught,3,Wed Jun 17 23:50:20 2015 UTC,Actually the human eye can see more shades of green than any other colour.
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,JorWat,9,Tue Jun 16 23:16:44 2015 UTC,"ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ We did it, reddit! ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ  No but seriously, this is absolutely amazing. This'll be one of the most agonizing waits of my life... But then, I'll probably be just finishing up with Fallout 4 once October '16 rolls around. I'm proud to be one of those 73k backers!  Cheers!"
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,Secret_Wizard,5,Wed Jun 17 00:06:26 2015 UTC,You think you'll be able to finish Fallout 4?
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,DaKillur,4,Wed Jun 17 01:46:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, I was sort of meaning I'd be collapsing of exhaustion right around then."

YookaLaylee,3a3k88,seavord,6,Wed Jun 17 02:12:59 2015 UTC,October 2016 is the expected release date of Yooka-Laylee. I was saying I'll be playing Fallout from its release to that point.

YookaLaylee,3a3k88,MuffinAlibaba,2,Wed Jun 17 07:10:47 2015 UTC,I'm wondering the same thing.
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,slendermax,4,Wed Jun 17 12:09:03 2015 UTC,Anyone else have their card declined? I think it might be because they are accepting the money overseas (I'm in the USA) and some banks think that's suspicious activity and decline the transaction.
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,Nickthegreat,2,Wed Jun 17 12:16:56 2015 UTC,"Mine was also declined, and it seems to be a common problem. The FAQ says it'll be resolved soon. It also happened to me the last time I backed an overseas kickstarter, so you might be on the right track with that theory."
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,TauVee,2,Wed Jun 17 21:27:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, glad I'm not the only one with this problem. I want Playtonic Games to take my money!"

YookaLaylee,3a3k88,TauVee,2,Thu Jun 18 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"I just got a call from my bank this morning! I was right, they thought it was suspicious activity so they declined the transaction. It's all good now!"
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,Nickthegreat,3,Thu Jun 18 18:11:48 2015 UTC,Wow we actually made the final stretch goal! I'm surprised and impressed!
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,SooperBread,3,Wed Jun 17 01:48:17 2015 UTC,Glad to be apart of that large number.
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,TheFaustin,3,Wed Jun 17 05:25:35 2015 UTC,"This was my first Kickstarter project that I ever backed, and I couldn't be happier with the results!"
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,edcellwarrior,3,Wed Jun 17 06:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'm still pretty bummed out that I couldn't afford to back this. Ah well, have to wait till it releases. And I'm happy it got funded to such a level."
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,Piecatcher,4,Wed Jun 17 07:33:36 2015 UTC,You can still pay through PayPal.
YookaLaylee,3a3k88,Piecatcher,2,Wed Jun 17 09:06:18 2015 UTC,Oh my goodness. thank you for showing me this. Does this opportunity expire soon or do I have until the estimated delivery?

YookaLaylee,3a64ay,stormforce5,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:13:41 2015 UTC,Maybe the mods could make a PayPal flair? :)
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,Zankou55,15,Wed Jun 17 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"I want the exact same formula of Banjo Kazooie, but new characters, worlds, moves, items, story. This is exactly what we are getting!"
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,Tidus1117,6,Wed Jun 17 17:52:38 2015 UTC,"Enough time has passed since a traditional BK game that I would be perfectly okay with more of the same. However, in interviews and previews and stuff they're definitely aiming to evolve that formula, not just rehash. Sounding like a beautiful mix of new and old."
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,ColonelOfSka,4,Wed Jun 17 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Banjo-Kazooie is a short game, even for a platformer, and we haven't gotten a game similar to it in almost 15 years, so I think it's fair to get another one like it."
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,StickyHand,5,Wed Jun 17 20:12:48 2015 UTC,"TLDR  Many platformers use the same formula. It's hard to really do anything new in terms of mechanics as it's all been done. And the reason it hasn't changed is because that formula is GOOD. Making great platformers comes down to tight controls and interesting level design. Besides, YL is essentially a sequel to the first two BK games so it makes sense that it shares so many similarities PLUS we haven't really seen this genre in many, many years so it's not like it'll feel stale in any way.    A few things.  First of all, like other have mentioned -- this game is filling a niche that we haven't had for at LEAST 10 years. Psychonauts was one of the last games to feature that 3D platformer collectathon vibe, really. Even the Mario games don't feel like SM64 which had a lot in common with BK. So even if it was nigh identical to Banjo Kazooie, it's not like we've had over-saturation of these types of games, in fact we've had practically nothing like it for a long time.  Second, it is essentially just the third BK game in everything but name and characters due to legal issues. Sequels should feel very similar. Of course, that's not to say they should just rehash the same content over and over but when they change too much, it no longer feels like the same game. But again, as a pseudo-sequel to BK, it's fine if it was 99% the same since we haven't had that time of game in years.  Third, Playtonic probably wanted to make a game they were confident they could hit out of the park. Something that at once feels fresh due to the absence of these types of games as well as something immediately familiar. So they didn't want to deviate from the BK formula especially since everyone really wanted Nuts and Bolts to be similar to the first two games but wasn't.  Fourth, we've only seen one level so far and it's the introductory level. Of course the world is going to have numerous similarities -- the first world is supposed to be the simplest and designed to ease the player into the game. This is why they typically offer a serene, pretty, and welcoming vibe to them. That's why virtually all platformers utilize the green, hills/forest/jungle vibe as a starting level: Green Hill Zone from Sonic, World 1-1 in Mario is almost always a foresty/jungle/hillsy level with lots of grass and the like, Mumbo's Mountain, Bob-Omb Battlefield in 64, and so on. Some games subvert this trope but all these levels feature a very similar aesthetic and atmosphere. We also can't assume that all the abilities we've seen them use are the only ones in the game -- maybe we unlock new ones as we progress that change how it plays. Maybe other levels have interesting new elements never seen in BK. We have no idea.  And lastly -- here's the thing about platformers. They're hard to innovate. The 2D formula was truly established by Super Mario Bros. and all the great platformers that followed took from that game because there really is no other way to do it. The 3D platformer formula was established with the era of the N64 and has endured. While Galaxy is vastly different from SM64, 64 laid the groundwork and Galaxy simply added to it by featuring the whole planetoid exploration and gravity mechanics. But there's a secret behind that -- while it seems new, it's not. What that is a result of is not only technology making it possible but level design. The secret of making great platformers really comes down to two things: tight and excellent controls and level design.  You need tight and excellent controls that are easy to learn and make sense. They need to be consistent and they need to be able to be used by more experienced players in ways that novices may not be able to. Because, at the end of the day, if the character(s) don't move or feel right, if it feels clunky or too floaty or too rigid or just off in some other way, the game will really fall apart.  And level design because you need really well designed levels for the character(s) to run through and explore. If the level design is too boring, it's not fun. If it's too difficult, you lose widespread appeal. If it's too easy, it has no challenge and is no longer rewarding. Carbon copy levels wouldn't be too great. If Rare released a total remake of Banjo Kazooie, then fine, that's one thing. But even then, it'd be more interesting to see remixed levels where the layouts have been altered, sometimes minimally in areas and sometimes drastically in others. Yooka Laylee won't have identical levels. We can already see that the first level is unique. So now that we know that, the important thing is to hope that the levels will be well designed and considering who's making it, we can be safe in assuming they will be.  Of course, having something new as long as it doesn't feel too gimmicky is better. Psychonauts' levels are very unique, some of the most unique levels of any platformer 2D or 3D. The first level is an ethereal warzone for instance instead of the archetypal green, grassy levels most platformers use. But it's not exactly bad for YL to utilize long standing platforming tropes as long as they utilize them excellently."
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,thehypotheticalnerd,2,Thu Jun 18 21:05:54 2015 UTC,Thank you for your very insightful and thorough reply.
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,Dooley27,3,Thu Jun 18 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"Seeing as it hasn't been stated yet, you do know that playtonic is the ""real rare"" that made the original banjo-kazooie games right?"
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,Dooley27,4,Thu Jun 18 00:52:06 2015 UTC,"Oh yes,  sorry.   The context was someone arguing the opposite.  Arguably,  both groups have equal claim to the name of the ""Real Rare"", just for different reasons."
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,BloodChicken,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:29:47 2015 UTC,Okay was just making sure. I apologize if my post came across as rude.
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,AdeonWriter,2,Thu Jun 18 02:34:56 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a legitimate concern but I think that, especially for the company's first game, they want to do something they can nail out of the park. It just also happens to fill a niche that hasn't been filled for about a decade or more.  Personally, I'm just treating this as Banjo Three-ie because it is in all but name. You wouldn't be annoyed about a sequel being ""too similar"" to the game it's a sequel of and I think that's the case here. Yooka-Laylee is a BK sequel in all but name and is delivering on what everyone wanted Nuts and Bolts to be.  If Playtonic as a company proves to be successful through this game, they might have the funds and the rep to be able to innovate again, probably with the help of a publisher if they had to but I think that they need to have a solid and well received product out there and Yooka-Laylee is just the story and product that will boost them into innovation sooner."
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,jdmoser,2,Thu Jun 18 12:46:35 2015 UTC,"I'm really hard up for more Banjo-Kazooie, so I want more Banjo-Kazooie. And this game seems to be exactly that. It's... pretty much exactly what I want. I get if it's not what everyone wants, but it's spot on for me, and that's why I poured money into it."
YookaLaylee,3a6kyl,stormforce5,2,Fri Jun 19 00:33:09 2015 UTC,I think right now it's way too early to be worried about that. Keep in mind they're still conceptualizing.... there's barely any game actually made here yet.

And if the first DLC isn't $10 and is instead $1, but then the second DLC is $10 (because everyone here is saying Playtonic's DLC would be worthwhile...), they'll complain that the free DLC incentive was falsely alluded to being greater than it turned out to be.  There are now guaranteed losers in this whole situation with free DLC coming."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,Exaskryz,9,Tue Jun 16 03:56:27 2015 UTC,"They've already stated that the 15 dollars is a special kickstarter price as well, since it's going to have far more content than a 15 dollar game would.  So if you want to wring your hands and worry over something completely inconsequential, worry that we all paid less than the people are going to have to pay at release too."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,bedabup,-7,Tue Jun 16 04:08:58 2015 UTC,Will do.
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,Exaskryz,3,Tue Jun 16 04:11:35 2015 UTC,Community divides do not happen over a single player game with DLC. Don't be stupid.
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,MisterBreeze,-1,Tue Jun 16 12:20:29 2015 UTC,"This thread is a case and point. This subreddit is a case and point.  I and others who believe DLC to be an ill-though idea for this game, for this company, are being harassed. In those harassers' own words, we are ""stupid""."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,Exaskryz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:06:36 2015 UTC,"DLC actually being present is not the same issue as people having DLC and other people not having it.  It would be a different situation if this were a multiplayer game, with maps which would actually cause a community divide. Not an imaginary one cause by a non-existent problem."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,MisterBreeze,-2,Tue Jun 16 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, sure, honeybees dying is an imaginary problem all the same just because you haven't seen the consequences yet. But go on."

YookaLaylee,39zp9c,MisterBreeze,2,Tue Jun 16 21:33:16 2015 UTC,"Nobody's forced to buy the DLC, and development will start after the game is launched."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,GrayMagicGamma,-9,Tue Jun 16 10:03:04 2015 UTC,"No one's forced to buy cars either. But if you see everyone in town who had lived there for a year longer than you getting free Ferraris, you'd probably feel some sort of negative emotion, yar?"
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,Exaskryz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:04:29 2015 UTC,"You would, and you won't see other gamers with the DLC playing next to you. So yes, you're correct, not interacting with and being at a disadvantage due to not being a DLC user is a great and humane way of adding content to the game, glad we agree."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,GrayMagicGamma,-9,Tue Jun 16 10:06:17 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is all players without DLC are to be shunned from every community?  GG. It's sad to see bigotry falling into the games meant to just bring out fun for people... It's already apparent just from people voting and speaking out against anyone critical of DLC. (And yes, I've seen your sig on the playtonic forums. I know you just love buying DLC in every game possible.)"
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,Exaskryz,2,Tue Jun 16 10:11:56 2015 UTC,"No, you were saying that they'd be shunned as if they didn't own a car. I was saying there's no need to even interact with other players in a single player game, so there's nothing to be jealous of."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,GrayMagicGamma,-8,Tue Jun 16 10:13:31 2015 UTC,"Except there are these online communities and players who don't buy the DLC will keep seeing posts about DLC, no doubt. I've seen that in each community (though sparse because of my preferences) where there was DLC or extra-pay content.  Try participating in a community that is focused on the sequel to a game, without having played the sequel. You'll get to see exactly how that will feel to someone in the community who is not able to afford or is abstaining from DLC. They could well enjoy the end of 2016 being able to participate in all discussions. But once everything has been discussed - anything new that is introduced, like DLC, will become the seasonal topic and anyone who can't experience the DLC will feel alienated or deserted."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,Exaskryz,2,Tue Jun 16 10:16:18 2015 UTC,The same could be said of sequels. Those minorities that join said online communities would be just as likely to be spoiled about a sequel's content as they would be a DLC's.
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,GrayMagicGamma,-8,Tue Jun 16 10:21:46 2015 UTC,"It's not even about being spoiled. Just the difficulty of discussion.   What's your favorite part of Halo 5's 17th map?   Kind of hard to say when you haven't played it, eh?   Who loved that race challenge in the new F-Zero map in Mario Kart 8?   Well, I didn't, cause I haven't played it yet.   What's your favorite attack of Ryu's in Smash Bros?   Hmm, I'm not sure, I haven't tried to play as him..."
YookaLaylee,39zp9c,Exaskryz,2,Tue Jun 16 10:34:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and there's nobody asking you unless you opt into a community that makes up a small minority of the players that will experience the game... and like I said, the same applies to sequels. ""Do you like BK or BT more"" is hard question for someone who's only played BK."

YookaLaylee,39vjf6,crudmaster,10,Mon Jun 15 03:42:38 2015 UTC,It's pounds people. Not dollars.
YookaLaylee,39vjf6,MisterBreeze,3,Mon Jun 15 13:44:54 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that it's a lot less than £70K  they need. On last report (Which was 3 days ago so it's likely more by now) they had £27K from Paypal.   https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playtonic/yooka-laylee-a-3d-platformer-rare-vival/posts/1261966  And as of right now it's £1,938,000 on the Kickstarter. So that makes the current total as of the time of this post at £1,965,000 or more. Needing only £35K in 33 hours. It's sure to go up pretty significantly in the last day so I don't think we need to worry about reaching the last goal, really.  Edit: As of right now they're getting about £2K an hour. Already at about £1,940,000 on the Kickstarter page. Seems like a sure thing at this point IMO.  Edit 2: At £1,945,000 now. So in 3 hours it's gone up 7K and it needs 28K (or less) more. So they'll probably reach their goal by the end of the day honestly.  Edit 3: At £1,957,000 now. So in those 3 hours it went up by 12K. With the last reported paypal the total is up to £1,984,000. So... I'll guess it gets announced they've hit the mark in 2-5 hours.  Edit 4: As of 10:40 PM Eastern US time the total on KS is at £1,974,000. Add £27,000 to that and we're at £2,001,000. So there ya go. Now let's all jump over to support Shenmue and get subtitles in every language."
YookaLaylee,39vjf6,Kewl0210,2,Mon Jun 15 13:44:15 2015 UTC,"So, are we over the stretch goal, presumably? I have no idea if the Paypal is counting towards it."
YookaLaylee,39vjf6,darkforce547,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:24:41 2015 UTC,"In theory, yes. I'm assuming the Twitter account hasn't announced it yet because it's like 4AM in the UK. But yeah, there's less than a 27K difference to the 2 million now. Glad not everyone jumped ship to go support Shenmue before we made it over the goal line."
YookaLaylee,39vjf6,Kewl0210,2,Tue Jun 16 02:32:42 2015 UTC,Thank god Shenmue was announced today. I have a month to get the money ha. This way there's no doubt about getting both.
YookaLaylee,39vjf6,darkforce547,2,Tue Jun 16 02:34:10 2015 UTC,I can pretty much tell you we will get atleast 100-200k over the last stretchgoal with ease : 3

YookaLaylee,39umiu,TheFaustin,3,Sun Jun 14 22:40:59 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling they will definitely take advantage of whatever power they have, in forms of resolution and frame rate, and potentially fidelity.  I can safely bet on PC having both the lowest and highest in terms of fidelity and options, with the PS4 beating the WiiU for example.  I wouldn't worry too much about it, since it'll be the same game whether  if it's at 720p, 792p, or 3840p, and if there's 10 patches of grass or 20.  I'd be more worried if they said they wanted to match graphical fidelity and screwed over framerates in the proccess."

YookaLaylee,39rqmt,Cozilz,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:37:39 2015 UTC,There are a lot third party adapters for these kinds of things. I personally prefer adapters from Mayflash. Here is their Amazon page.  I would stay away from controllers that someone has built a USB cable into like this N64 controller. In my experience these modded or custom made controllers don't feel like the originals. The buttons are sometimes hard to press and the joysticks feel like they're grinding on something.  EDIT: Some people don't like Mayflash and prefer the controllers. Do research because I am just speaking from my own experience.
YookaLaylee,39rqmt,CityOfChamps09,2,Sun Jun 14 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, I bought that N64 controller that you linked, and it's one of the best and most responsive 3rd party N64 controllers, and I use it for Project 64 emulation. The brand name is Retrolink. It works awesome!"
YookaLaylee,39rqmt,NuclearFej,2,Sun Jun 14 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"I've had good and bad experiences with those controllers.

Some games characters would slowly move forward in one direction when I pushed the stick in that direction far forward because it was picking up inputs for that direction (this happened in multiple games and I tried multiple controllers. This happened to both adapters and then the third adapter I bought was the smash adapter for wii u and pc because no one can keep stock of the official nintendo one, it had the SAME PROBLEM."

YookaLaylee,39opst,Icy_Slice,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:10:46 2015 UTC,Well I mean the game itself is worth more than what they're selling it for on KS. I figured that getting the toybox was just a nice small bonus for paying a little more for the game itself.

YookaLaylee,39opst,Alteran195,-17,Tue Jun 16 16:58:39 2015 UTC,"No. Fuck the DLC. I want this to speak to the devs by saying we don't want DLC. The fact that the last 25 days has only raised like £400,000 even with the reward of a free DLC says a lot to me and I really hope we do not reach that threshold.  Regardless, I will back on the console tier because that will be cheaper than getting at retail launch.  (Edit: Can I see some people actually going for discussion rather than downvoting through pure blind passion for Playtonic devs and absolute faith that in no way could a video game company ever make a mistake or wrong their customers in any way?)"
YookaLaylee,39opst,Exaskryz,6,Sat Jun 13 20:20:06 2015 UTC,"DLC that they are going to be working on after they finish the game is different then DLC being content they exclude from the game just to sell it later on.   I also don't have a problem with how some companies do DLC, if they add enough additional content to make it worth the cost (Blood Dragon, Assassin Creed Tyranny of King Washington, AC 4 Freedom Cry, ACU Dead Kings, and Skyrims DLC come to mind) where its more like an expansion pack of the older days is fine to me.   Given how much passion Playtonic seems to be putting into this game, I have faith that the DLC they will be making will be more like an expansion pack then something small and insignificant like a lot of other companies DLC which is a good thing.   Unless you also hated old school expansion packs as well for some reason."
YookaLaylee,39opst,Alteran195,-4,Sat Jun 13 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"DLC for yooka laylee detracts from time and effort put into other Playtonic games. Never mind that they want to release multiple DLC packs and they're not even close to done with the main game.  I would much rather they put their ideas for Yooka into a sequel. Games like Smash Bros, Mario Kart, and Splatoon do well with DLC because they focus on the multiplayer aspect. Expansion packs (and I do admit that DLC can be on that scale) are great in campaign games like World of Warcraft.  I don't think Yooka Laylee fits into either of those. If Playtonic ever made a Diddy Kong Racing successor, that would be fine to make DLC for IMO. I just cannot imagine a platformer collectathon will do DLC well."
YookaLaylee,39pk59,Alteran195,11,Sat Jun 13 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"It will be supported, as it's the primary controller for the system, and Playtonic has discussed possibility of Amiibo support as well, which would require the gamepad."
YookaLaylee,39pk59,NaClO_Official,2,Sat Jun 13 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"Oh God Amiibo support, that would be pretty awesome, but i'm not looking forward to trying to hunt down another Amiibo that will probably be rare."
YookaLaylee,39pk59,korrt106,4,Sat Jun 13 16:16:44 2015 UTC,But they're not Rare at all.
YookaLaylee,39pk59,CzarSquid,2,Mon Jun 15 22:15:38 2015 UTC,The honest answer is we don't know. I assume yes because it is the Wii U but I doubt it will serve much use. Mostly because it's going to be the same game on all consoles. Maybe we will get a map view or a streaming feature of the game.
YookaLaylee,39pk59,GrizzledSage,3,Sun Jun 14 03:40:10 2015 UTC,"I guess it would be overall better for it to the exact same game across all platforms. That way no one gets cheated, and has to buy the game twice, and in a since we do get dlc for the game. We shouldn't need exclusive content i suppose."
YookaLaylee,39pk59,CzarSquid,2,Sun Jun 14 08:53:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As much as I like the Wii U and appreciate the pad, I just don't see how a multiplatform game will fully take advantage of the gamepad. Heck, I'm just glad to see this game on any system of choice for everyone to enjoy."
YookaLaylee,39pk59,bogidyboy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"At the least, it will allow Off-TV play. At most, it'll put an quest-status screen on the game-pad. I'd rather be able to play with the pro-controller anyway."
YookaLaylee,39pk59,CzarSquid,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:06:17 2015 UTC,Which isn't a problem considering that the gamepad is the pro pad without the screen and yookalaylee is going to have a traditional control style.

The 64-bit cart is an actual N64 cartridge, re-stickered with Yooka-Laylee artwork and it will contain a built-in 64GB flash drive – storing data will never be the same again! It’s not a N64 version of the game you can plug in and play on the N64 itself, that’d require real magic! (Even our very own programmers, Jens and Chris couldn’t pull that one off!...

YookaLaylee,39fv8g,Wazzok1,2,Mon Jun 15 06:47:48 2015 UTC,"He means literally, a new instalment in the Banjo-Kazooie franchise."
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,thehypotheticalnerd,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:26:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they know that. What they're saying is, if the new BK is like the original game or Tooie and not a weird spin off type game like N&B, then great!"
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,Wazzok1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:33:13 2015 UTC,He said 'If it's a platformer in the style of Kazooie/Tooie' and then compared it to Yooka-Laylee. It's fairly obvious he didn't mean a new BK game.
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,thehypotheticalnerd,2,Thu Jun 11 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  ""If it's a platformer in the style of Kazooie/Tooie""  The operative word here is ""it's."" We can easily replace that word like so:  ""If the new BK's a platformer like Kazooie/Tooie""  Here's an example:  Nuts and bolts is a game that is NOT like Kazooie/Tooie because it plays so differently. It's not a platformer like Kazooie/Tooie.  Now pretend we made a thread or a comment thread about Nuts and Bolts and we're discussing that. Take that second sentence and cut out the first sentence I made. What are you left with?  ""It's not a platformer like Kazooie/Tooie."" Based on context, you know I'm referring to N&B and you know that I'm saying that the gameplay is vastly different. They're different types of games, right? One group (Kazooie/Tooie) is a 3D platformer and the other featured vehicle building. Way different.  So in the actual situation, we were discussing if Microsoft made a new BK, how we'd react. So they said ""if it's a platformer in the style of Kazooie/Tooie"". What we can gather from that is that they're potentially saying this: ""I'd be excited if the new BK is a platformer in the style of Kazooie/Tooie and not a vehicle builder in the style of Nuts and Bolts.""  I'm not saying you're wrong, you may very well be correct but you could just as easily be incorrect. The wording is a bit vague but it doesn't guarantee what you think it does.    TLDR  ""If it's a platformer in the style of Kazooie/Tooie"" doesn't necessarily mean he's saying this:  ""If their new game is a platformer in the style of Kazooie/Tooie""  It could just as easily mean:  ""If the new BK game is a platformer in the style of Kazooie/Tooie""  And we know this is an option because pretty much every BK fan agrees that Nuts and Bolts is a completely different game and that Rare fucked up the threequel. So they could easily be saying ""if it's like the old games and NOT like N&B.""  And yes this TLDR is, itself, rather lengthy.    Edit: Just checked and ya no, I'm still right. You could be correct but you could also be incorrect.   They compared it to Yooka because we're in the Yooka sub and because Yooka is a spiritual successor to the original two games and not to N&B. He'd feel bad because Banjo-Kazooie is more widely known and has that legacy. That said, I think Playtonic doesn't have to worry because they still get to say they were behind the original BK games.   And that only helps bolster the possibility of you being incorrect because he's comparing it to Yooka which is similar to the first two games. So if Microsoft/Rare reveal a new BK game that is a TRUE sequel to Kazooie/Tooie by being a platformer, then they'd be interestes. But if it's some type of N&B bullshit all over again... then no."

YookaLaylee,39fv8g,mrcc93,8,Fri Jun 12 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"My only thing is..the guys who created Banjo-Kazooie are now making Yooka-Laylee. So people who have probably never worked on a Banjo-Kazooie game will be making it. I'm not saying it'll be bad, but they won't really know what to do with it like the veterans at Playtonic Games. Honestly at this point, after Nuts & Bolts, Banjo-Kazooie needs to just stay dead and let other platormers come on. Cause I seriously don't trust Rare to make a great game anymore.

YookaLaylee,39fv8g,IshuK,2,Thu Jun 11 18:12:11 2015 UTC,If it holds up to the previous two games then it might be the reason I buy an Xbox One. Not to mention that a little friendly competition is always good (for both Banjo & Kazooie and Yooka-Laylee).
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,supamesican,4,Thu Jun 11 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"Since it will most likely be xbox exclusive, it will make no difference to me at all."

YookaLaylee,39fv8g,doctorvonscience,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have a new once since I've played all 5 other games, but I don't have an Xbox One, so I'd be pretty sad. I have a Wii U, but that'll never happen. For the first time I'd feel disconnected from some of my old favorite childhood game characters. Most of my favorites are first party Nitnendo, but not those guys. Also, I'd hope it wouldn't hurt support for Yooka-Laylee."

I feel like the characters (including Gruntilda, Mumbo, etc) have all kinda been played out now. This is in large part because of Nuts and Bolts. If it's a good platformer I'd give it a chance though."

YookaLaylee,39fv8g,Haarberger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:44:15 2015 UTC,I doubt Rare will be able to put out a proper Banjo Kazooie sequel at this point when half the talent is over at Platonic games. Not to say they couldn't do it well but it be mighty hard to capture that same feel without the right people.   If Rare does it then great because it means more great games. However the history says otherwise and the Rare I used to know is dead at this point.
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,Icarus599,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:43:04 2015 UTC,Couple things I would want for a Banjo-Kazooie announcement. - Grunty's Revenge in 3D - First game redone with better textures and co-op (First plan before N&B)  and the biggest thing I would hope for is Banjo Threeie.

YookaLaylee,39fv8g,SenoraSies,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"My immediate reaction would be ""Well there goes any chance of Banjo and Kazooie EVER being in Smash Bros. now."" Nintendo wouldn't put in a character that would drive another console.   And then I would think ""This will be a 3D platformer. Rare and Microsoft better not fuck this up again."" Yooka Laylee will most likely show other developers who aren't Nintendo that people DO still love a well crafted 3D platformed, and a revival of the genre may come to pass if the new Banjo game is any good."
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,Exaskryz,0,Thu Jun 11 15:23:55 2015 UTC,I'd be disappointed. I'm not going to pay $560 for a game.
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,SenoraSies,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:57:30 2015 UTC,Does $300 plus two games sound more reasonable?
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,Exaskryz,2,Thu Jun 11 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"$300?  I see a $389 on there (and if Membership is free, get $40 off that). Still, $350 is terribly pricy for three games to play. (I really don't care about Halo (do they even have servers online for 1 and 2 still?) nor Resident Evil, so, yeah... I honestly don't think there's a game on XBox ONE that I even want to play...)  Edit: But I will say that it is nice that the One is under $400. Better than a PS3 running $600."
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,SenoraSies,2,Thu Jun 11 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"$389 minus $90 using the coupon code that's listed right above that price in bright orange letters. Halo 1, 2, 3, and 4 can all be played seamlessly online through the MCC. I don't really like RE games either, but it's worth something as a trade-in.  If you aren't interested I ain't gonna try to convince you otherwise, but an Xbox One plus a game hasn't been $560 for a while now."
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,Exaskryz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"Huh. There's a Halo 4. I thought that was still in development....  So, 5 games and a system, that's not too bad actually. I still wouldn't get it because I don't have enough time to actually use a ONE if I got it. Any time I would I want to put on a system I know I'd have fun with, so I'll stick with the Wii U.  Edit: I still don't see the $90 discount cost. And the membership is $20/mo, so that's really makes it a $369 system on my end. Still, 5 games which would be like $40 average each I guess is $200 and makes the system itself only $169."
YookaLaylee,39fv8g,tokyozombie,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:57:01 2015 UTC,"The discount code is for $90 off the undiscounted price and is in orange right above the Market Value price listed (which is itself located right above the orange member discount you looked at instead). It takes a bit longer to pop up on the page than the rest. Here's the code anyway: 4GTZ0JB?LSRGSH  Halo 5 is the game still in development with a release pegged for this winter. As far as interesting games, I'd say look at Sunset Overdrive. It's made by Insomniac who did the R&C series on playstation.  Speaking of playstation....

And the fact that ""platonic"" is a kind of love and then there's the word ""play"" for gameplay, I thought I'd just combine the two, make it called ""Playtonic.""

The track could go trough the main hub world and/or all the worlds in the game, as an epic final overview of the awesome adventure we just completed.  That way, they don't waste too much time(they are reusing almost everything they already made for the game), it could be epic to revisit every worlds in a different perspective with some crazy tracks, they could use that to hint at some secrets and other crazy/funny things Playtonic can think of.

YookaLaylee,3966l6,Rozenrot,6,Tue Jun 9 15:48:51 2015 UTC,"Easily, there is always a mad rush at the end provided they make a campaign for it. Considering the pre-E3 furor begins now I'm expecting that push to begin any time now.  Here's Mighty No. 9's numbers for reference: http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/mightyno9/mighty-no-9/#chart-daily  And a link to Yooka-Laylee: http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/playtonic/yooka-laylee-a-3d-platformer-rare-vival/#chart-daily  The big wrinkle here however is Bloodstained is ending at the same time. My wallet's really going to feel it this Friday x_x"

YookaLaylee,3966l6,dance1211,3,Tue Jun 9 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"It's already past the 2mil mark in Freedom Dollars, so there's that.  But seriously. Campaigns like these usually always have a big surge by the end. It'll pass it no problem, I'm sure."
YookaLaylee,3966l6,mightyno9,2,Wed Jun 10 00:58:19 2015 UTC,"definitely. we will probably exceed it, theres a huge surge when a kickstarter is coming to an end"
YookaLaylee,3966l6,DamascusRose,2,Tue Jun 9 16:35:33 2015 UTC,Does that number include the paypal donations? because if it doesn't we might be closer than we think.

YookaLaylee,38z2br,NaClO_Official,3,Mon Jun 8 14:51:05 2015 UTC,"I would be very surprised if they had a booth for a game they are developing for just 4 months.    But I wouldn't be surprised if they had some short mention in the indie portion of Nintendo, Microsoft or Sony conference, with maybe some new footage."
YookaLaylee,38z2br,Cindres91,5,Mon Jun 8 19:44:30 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the progress they've made in 3 months? They've let multiple people from the media play it. Plus, they said they were even hoping to have the Toybox++ available shortly after the kickstarter is over."
YookaLaylee,38z2br,RobKhonsu,2,Mon Jun 8 10:09:18 2015 UTC,"Of course I've seen it, and it's very impressive."
YookaLaylee,38z2br,sargentsuicide,4,Mon Jun 8 11:45:19 2015 UTC,I know they said that the Kickstarter ending when E3 starts wasn't a coincidence but I think that might just be for the Kirkhope thing. Either way I'm assuming no big announcement or anything too special. I get the feeling we've seen all there is to see (or they want us to see) at this point in time in their videos and updates.
YookaLaylee,38z2br,sargentsuicide,2,Mon Jun 8 11:50:56 2015 UTC,I have a feeling we'll be seeing a trailer along with all the others that normally come out in the days before E3. Same with Bloodstained (both end on the day E3 begins). There's usually a bit of pre-E3 fervor that I feel both of these campaigns want to try to capitalize on.
YookaLaylee,38z2br,HowdyDoodlyDoo,6,Mon Jun 8 10:56:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think a game that had to be funded through kickstarter will be there. I'm sure we'll see what rare has been up to, but as far as this game we probably won't see anything."
YookaLaylee,38z2br,meganev,6,Mon Jun 8 14:05:44 2015 UTC,"Well the game didn't have to be funded through Kickstarter, the game was happening regardless. So maybe they planned something for E3 before the Kickstarter idea.    A booth isn't going to happen, but a short video with new footage for E3 is probable, whether it is at a big conference or just something they will put up on their website."
YookaLaylee,38wtzx,crudmaster,8,Sun Jun 7 14:43:52 2015 UTC,That number honestly seems low for how much people freak out over BK

The odds that you are the first person to come up with this joke are very slim.  If I were to come up with something like this on my own, I would honestly assume someone else has already, because I am not so specially clever that I expect I beat everyone to the punch. To that end, what I would do if I came up with something like that is first search and see if it has been said before. It has been said here A LOT of times, not just once or twice. Searching very briefly would have likely shown that.  Imo, that's the best thing to do. When you think about posting something like this, just make sure it hasn't been done before.

YookaLaylee,38o36y,TypicalTyrian,6,Fri Jun 5 13:49:25 2015 UTC,"Really interesting to hear their answer about their ability to make platformers while at Microsoft. I know they said in their AMA that Microsoft was always supportive of what they did at Rare, but in the interview they did mention that the pressure of having to make the next big thing in a multi-million dollar coorporation was bit of an obstacle (for them personally).  I feel like those are two pretty interesting pieces that compliment more than they sound. We all know that DK64 and Star Fox Adventures got flack while Bad Fur Day was relatively praised. I think Rare just had some foresight that they were getting burned out on platformers, and those titles that were more successful were those that were a bit more linear and focused on the adventure and story. Bad Fur Day wasn't really much of a collectathon as it was a platformer with a straightforward story to it, and that shows considering one of their first Microsoft games was Live and Reloaded.  I think Rare (as a whole) just burned out on platformers and legitimately wanted to try new things. I think that's why we got Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Perfect Dark Zero, Kameo: Elements of Power, and the Viva Pinata games. If anything, I feel like Kameo was a much better executed vision of what they wanted to do with Star Fox Adventures, since both are fairly Zelda like adventure titles, but one has fully original characters and honestly the better design (Kameo). Rare really wasn't a ""Kinect only group"" until the past years following Nuts & Bolts, and I think they did it to try out new tech and do, yet again, something new.  Rare's still Rare, they just changed their vision and focus a lot compared to what they are best known for. I'm glad that the Playtonic Games team left Rare, and I genuinely get the sense that it doesn't have any malice to it (except maybe from that rather odd dialogue in the beginning of Nuts & Bolts). Maybe some regret and a little splash of contempt judging on some of Grant's comments expressed before on the Guest Grumps comments and a few things he's said before on Twitter, but I think they're kind of put in a hole to want to survive in a big sea while at Rare (Kinect did really great in sales), but with Kickstarter and Yooka-Laylee, they can be a smaller team with less corporate obligations and more focus on smaller passion projects.   Hopefully the resurgence of platformers in the indie scene has caught Microsoft's attention, which it seems to judging from how Phil Spencer has been talking in regards to Rare. How great would it be to have Yooka-Laylee and a dedicated Banjo-Threeie side by side? Can't wait to see what happens, and really liked the interview even if it didn't tell much new about Yooka-Laylee."

I've had lots of good times getting together and gaming with friends, but I can't recall another game that made us laugh so hard we were all out of breath and about to cry. The chaos of it is just insanely amusing, and the semi-competitive aspects (trying to steal the crown from each other) are equally funny.  On the other hand, it's only fun if you're all about equally skilled and a bit competitive. Trying to do legitimate co-op with someone who's not great at the game is a nightmare."

YookaLaylee,38hsdi,Prutzle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:04:24 2015 UTC,"A complete Banjo clone.  I'm getting less enthusiastic about this game the more I see the news. So many opportunities to INNOVATE a genre that has not seen any attention in forever, and so far it seems they are content in making ""Definitely not Banjo 3"".  To give an example, Divinity : Original Sin and Pillars of Eternity were both kickstarters based on isometric RPGs like Baldur's Gate.  Divinity : OS is pretty darn close to a 10/10 game for me, they innovated a lot, made it look awesome, etc. It's such a fun game to play and your mages aren't limited to using a spell once in a blue moon.  Pillars of Eternity is ~6 or 7/10 for me. It's pretty much a complete clone of the old isometric RPGs. It's alright, but it's very limited in what you can do with your characters. It uses the same text formats as old games, the same feel, etc... Everything down to the UI feels old and overall it feels very lacking by comparison of a modern game like Divinity : OS.   I love old games, but innovation of modern games shouldn't just be thrown aside. I see so many fans asking for them to make a Banjo clone and I'm saddened by it. Hell, I've seen people say ""the text bubbles suck, make them like Banjo!""...  Just because BK was a successful game in this genre, doesn't mean you can't put a new spin on it with this game!  *EDIT : Not shocked I got downvoted. Disappointing that people don't want innovation in their games and just want to replay the same game with a different skin."

YookaLaylee,38dupc,dougiefresh1233,3,Wed Jun 3 17:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a bit so-so. I tried to ask a question that wouldn't give away too much if answered (Wii U control options, will worlds have multiple tropes, how long might it take the average player to beat Yooka-Laylee) but it was towards the end of it all. I can get why the last one might be hard to answer, but surely some idea of Wii U control options would've been nice to hear!   I kinda wish this AMA was on this subreddit since there was a buttload of questions, and a lot of the questions were really general or unrelated to Yooka-Laylee, sadly. Still, we got some interesting little tidbits about the DKC titles (Mr. X's purpose confirmed and a funny story from the development) and a few tidbits on Y-L.   It looks like Yooka's color changing abilities might stack with your other moves like your rolling ability, though this has been apparently mentioned before The villain might rhyme! They'll be trying to put in some fun Rare-reference easter eggs so long as they aren't ones that'll get them sued Features to support speedrunners Features to support handicapped folks  The Kickstarter price of $15 is a ""special price"" so the full game may cost more More strange and wacky worlds to be revealed Blob and dynamic shadows will both be used Aiming for an E10+ rating    The only thing that was really new was their aim for an E10 rating, a hint at wackier worlds, and the blob/dynamic shadows both being used. Ah well. Kinda glad they're being secretive still like the old Rare, but some extra info on options, control schemes, etc. would be nice to see in the coming development months."
YookaLaylee,38dupc,CityOfChamps09,2,Wed Jun 3 20:47:28 2015 UTC,I'm sure we'll hear more at E3 (I hope). They said that they were going to have a booth there.
YookaLaylee,38dupc,dougiefresh1233,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:28:51 2015 UTC,Yeah the motion control stuff was asked like 3 times and none of them got answered. A lot of the ones they did answer  (and ones you listed) were answered in a previous interview (they said they were aiming for E or some variance of E). I do agree that I kind of like how little we know because it will make the game a suprise when I play it.

YookaLaylee,380yvg,Dudewat126,17,Mon Jun 1 01:27:23 2015 UTC,"I dunno - hearing Super Mario Galaxy's (or, more relevant to this type of games, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts') soundtrack, I never once felt that the orchestration made the soundtrack less enjoyable. Quite the contrary, in fact. Those games have amazing soundtracks!  I also don't see how MIDI will age better than actual real instruments? It's not like today's recording methods are that far behind or something...  Unfortunately, I don't think an option would be... an option *bdum-tsh* Having twice as much music in the game, having to create both versions of every song twice, etc... will all be very had work. It's not just something one can implement with pre-existing content or anything!  Personally, I say give the orchestral soundtrack a try. I'm sure you'll enjoy it while playing the game! If not, then there most certainly will be MIDI remakes of the game's soundtrack, just like this one!"
YookaLaylee,380yvg,shyPiano,2,Mon Jun 1 09:31:53 2015 UTC,"It's not like today's recording methods are that far behind   Today can't be behind.  That's what makes it today and not yesterday.  Also, I know some games, like many in the Touhou project had the ability to switch between Midi and other. With all the money they've raised, I'm sure they can afford to make 2 full soundtracks. As for implementing them, that really wouldn't be hard from a programming standpoint.  It's a simple if statement."
YookaLaylee,380yvg,BobTheLawyer,14,Wed Jun 3 05:36:54 2015 UTC,Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts is the aim. It sounds amazing orchestrated! I can't imagine it as midi.
YookaLaylee,380yvg,Dragonmind,3,Mon Jun 1 05:57:07 2015 UTC,I just listened to that soundtrack. That totally changed my mind about this. It's going to sound amazing!

YookaLaylee,380yvg,trevorsaur,3,Mon Jun 1 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. The soundtrack for that game was amazing. I love the Banjoland Theme, hearing an orchestrated medley of so much of the music from the original games."
YookaLaylee,380yvg,TheShadowThief,5,Mon Jun 1 14:39:14 2015 UTC,can we have an option to switch from Medi and Orchestral sound modes?   So you want them to do double the work?  They made a decision as artists to create orchestral work for a stretch goal because it's what they wanted to do. I feel like crowdfunding comes with a lot of entitlement because of innate involvement with the community. I think we should trust the composers to do a good job since they're exactly who people would want composing this game in the first place.
YookaLaylee,380yvg,joebillybob,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:40:33 2015 UTC,"While I think this guy's suggestion is a bit ridiculous, having MIDI as well as Orchestral tracks is hardly double the work. MIDI tracks don't even come close to the amount of work, time, and money required for recording and mixing a live orchestra. MIDI is the easy way out, really. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the composers use some sort of DAW or MIDI program to flesh out the pieces before going to record with an orchestra, so theoretically the MIDI files would already be in place (assuming the composers are using Finale or some comparable software). On another note, I'm baffled people would prefer sampling through a 30+ year old digital audio protocol over recordings of a professional orchestra."

YookaLaylee,380yvg,MeisterD2,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"MIDI:       MIDI (/ˈmɪdi/; short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that describes a protocol, digital interface and connectors and allows a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers and other related devices to connect and communicate with one another.  A single MIDI link can carry up to sixteen channels of information, each of which can be routed to a separate device.  MIDI carries event messages that specify notation, pitch and velocity, control signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato, audio panning, cues, and clock signals that set and synchronize tempo between multiple devices. These messages are sent via a MIDI cable to other devices where they control sound generation and other features. This data can also be recorded into a hardware or software device called a sequencer, which can be used to edit the data and to play it back at a later time.  :4  MIDI technology was standardized in 1983 by a panel of music industry representatives, and is maintained by the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA). All official MIDI standards are jointly developed and published by the MMA in Los Angeles, California, US, and for Japan, the MIDI Committee of the Association of Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI) in Tokyo.

YookaLaylee,380yvg,Marco_732,3,Mon Jun 1 02:07:03 2015 UTC,That is incorrect.  I made that mistake at first as well.  The N64 option is literally just a flash drive encased in an N64 cartridge.  Not actual N64 graphics.

YookaLaylee,380yvg,stormforce5,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:36:01 2015 UTC,"2 days late on this thread, but a good orchestral arrangement to check out is the Blake Robinson's Synthetic Orchestra version of Banjo-Kazooie (Grant has spoken highly of this himself).  iTunes  You can find it on YouTube as well. I listened to nothing but this for months after I bought it.  See the Mario Galaxy games for the value of having a live orchestra do your soundtrack. It'll be beautiful and still with those Banjo-esque sounds that we desire."

YookaLaylee,37z0p8,GameMaster366,12,Sun May 31 19:59:33 2015 UTC,A Hat in Time is amazing and definitely worth looking into.

YookaLaylee,37z0p8,GameMaster366,3,Sun May 31 20:27:14 2015 UTC,"The kiwi is my favorite animal. But truth be told, it looks like something whipped together for a senior project. Yes, it does look like an N64 game. But that doesn't mean its automatically good."
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,scubast,2,Sun May 31 21:01:33 2015 UTC,Its not. Very cute game though for what it is.
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,grangach,4,Sun May 31 23:09:08 2015 UTC,It's zoomed in so far
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,grangach,3,Mon Jun 1 10:02:22 2015 UTC,Luckys looks a little too linear. Happy hell looks mad cool though it's got the most unified and unique art style of them all.
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,Chockrit,7,Mon Jun 1 10:09:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone else noticed, but I really appreciated the sound effects on the stars in Lucky's Tale. The sound effect is random, but it's chosen to harmonize with the music at any given chord. Really nice detail on that one."
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,shyPiano,6,Mon Jun 1 04:20:31 2015 UTC,"It's great to see the Collect-a-ton genre of platforming games making a come back! :)  I was aware of A Hat In Time and Lobodestroyo, but not following closely, as they seem to be still far away from completion, and (IMO) didn't show the level of potential than Yooka-Laylee does.  A Hat In Time seems to be aiming for a closer feel to Super Mario 64 than Banjo-Kazooie - which is great as well! I'll be waiting for it to be finished!  Lucky's Tale, however, seems to be very linear - more like a regular 3D Platforming game than a Collect-a-ton. Nothing wrong in that, but I am not sure if it fits this list? Either way, thanks for sharing!"
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,sargentsuicide,4,Mon Jun 1 13:19:19 2015 UTC,I love the look of lucky's tale but I wish it didn't have a fixed camera angle. Also the world didn't look as open as I would have liked.
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,TheMasterDS,4,Mon Jun 1 03:18:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's more of an Indie Super Mario 3D World than a Collectathon 3D Platformer."
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,sargentsuicide,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:02:27 2015 UTC,Well it's a fantastic base for a collectathon 3d  platformer. Nice graphics and characters and moves.
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,warriorseeker,2,Mon Jun 1 06:22:07 2015 UTC,"It's being developed exclusively for the Oculus Rift, so the camera isn't gonna be static like that. It'll change depending on where you're looking. I'm not really sure why they did a video for it without showing off the VR, as that seems to me the main draw for this game."
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,sargentsuicide,2,Tue Jun 2 21:39:22 2015 UTC,Well dang. I probably won't be getting oculus rift for a while though.
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,warriorseeker,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:13:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me neither. But honestly, Lucky's Tale looks pretty bland to me apart from the VR functionality, so I'm not too bummed."
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,sargentsuicide,3,Wed Jun 3 03:27:54 2015 UTC,I like games like that. I liked Tak and the power of juju and all sequels. Reminds me of that more than banjo-kazooie.
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,xWaffleicious,4,Wed Jun 3 04:20:48 2015 UTC,"I think A Hat in Time is going to be amazing, I've had the alpha and now the beta is out and tbh it's amazing.  The control is almost perfect, the art is great, music is amazing, levels are fun, etc.  I think that and YL are going to be the two best imo and I think they'll both be very well received.  If you haven't checked out A Hat in Time you have to. Especially if you're a fan of games like SM64 ir SMS"
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,Quicheauchat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:59:25 2015 UTC,I agree. Hat in time is great. Ive played through the beta like 5 times.
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,thehypotheticalnerd,3,Wed Jun 3 07:31:07 2015 UTC,"A Hat in Time really has an impressive beta right now. Movement felt pretty loose in the alpha, but the badge system is a smart way of keeping the moveset controls simple while allowing for a wide variety of options, and they definitely cleaned up jumping animations and physics in the beta.  Level layouts and missions feel much more Super Mario Sunshine than they do Banjo-Kazooie, though. Acts make the missions more focused to one task or goal rather than having everything strewn about the map from the get-go."
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,Ikunuku,3,Wed Jun 3 13:02:08 2015 UTC,"Lobodestroyo looks alright. I'm not sure how much the game has been updated since that trailer but everything looks so stiff and the art style is... it's like it's going for a similar look as AHIT and Lucky but it just seems...off. not sure how else to describe it. A Hat In Time is easily the one that is the most professional. It's also by far the most creative of the bunch. All the rest are using animal-based characters like Banjo and DK because that's what they're emulating. AHIT is clearly inspired by those games but isn't stuck in the nostalgia. The characters are fun, charming, quirky, and creative. Like a more bright and colorful, less twisted and less demented version of Psychonauts. Think ""Disney vs Invader Zim"". The graphics have come along way since the original reveal and they were already great. That's not to say the other games are bad because of the nostalgia because Yooka-Laylee clearly is too but yeah. It's neat to see something a bit different among the bunch. Regardless, it's great to see more 3D platformers coming along. Kiwi 64... sigh. Nope. It looks boring, bland, and unoriginal. They made Kazooie a tiny round bird and have him the backpack he sits in in B-K. Despite having the graphics of the N64, it doesn't seem to have any of the oomph the old games had. Maybe with more time it'd get to where it and everyone else wants it to be at. Still, once again, it's good to see 3D platformers because even with potential duds, the influx is good for fans if the genre regardless. Happy Hell... man oh man, this one is really neat looking. I like the retro cartoon feel of the main character and the idea of being trapped in a devil's nightmarish world is pretty solid for a 3D platformer. I'm not too fond of the strange nose (I would have preferred a more normal nose that would have made him look a little more like Felix the Cat) but yeah. Solid idea and impressive if it was made by just one guy... i honestly think itd benefit from a Psychonauts type of comedy style. It looks like it didn't get backed though so...? Lucky looks pretty. Not so sure about the gameplay but it definitely looks real nice. I'd say it's a little better than AHIT but both are definitely the most gorgeous of the bunch.   I've had my eye on AHIT for a loooong time and backed it for the retail version. I'll keep my eye on Lucky as well as Lobodestroyo. Of the list, I'd rank them as:   A Hat in Time Lobodestroyo Lucky's Tale (shame it's exclusive to Oculus though) Happy Hell Kiwi 64     While not quite the same, Jet Set Radio Future always reminded me a bit of 3D platformers: swap out traditional floating platforms for rails to grind on, build up momentum and ""platrailing"" by jumping from rail to rail. The graffiti spots you'd tag were essentially like collecting items to finish the level like other 3D platformers, the levels were sandboxy with challenging elements.  You collected spray cans in order to ""collect"" (re: tag areas) spots on the level. The biggest difference was that there were no enemies throughout levels. Typically just civilians. Falling, passing cars, etc. were the usual causes for concern. Actual enemies like cops would be fought at certain spots in levels and opposing gangs would be raced or fought via tagger's tag.  I mention this because Hover: Revolt of Gamers is unabashedly inspired by JSRF and it looks amazing. It, A Hat In Time, and of course Yooka-Laylee are some of my most anticipated games announced."

Or at least I hope it was....  But still, I am somewhat worried that the only public update about the game has been fake...."
YookaLaylee,37z0p8,warriorseeker,2,Wed Jun 3 02:15:21 2015 UTC,good point on both counts. either way leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'm glad we have Yooka-Laylee. I trust these guys.

YookaLaylee,37z0p8,grangach,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:13:26 2015 UTC,"Lobodestroyo looks really interesting to me, and it has for a while now. I'm sad I missed out on the Kickstarter. Unfortunately, it seems like only Kickstarter backers are getting any info on development, so I'm not really sure how far along is or how it's shaping up. I'm definitely keeping an eye open for any further development on this, though.  I'm incredibly excited for A Hat in Time. I did manage to back this one's campaign, and I got a beta code when those came out. The variety in the levels (both in how they play and their moods) is really exciting to me. They also put out a backer-only update to their Kickstarter not too long ago, and I'd estimate we'll get it early 2016 at the latest. Don't quote me on that, though.  Kiwi 64 looks like it might be a fun little time-waster, but it's not anything I look forward to playing like I do for the first two. I saw a post about it not too long ago on this sub, but I haven't gotten around to playing it yet. I might at some point, but like other people have already said, it looks more like it was just thrown together as a school project or to practice game development than it does a game that the creator really cared about.  Happy Hell is the first of these I hadn't heard about before this post. It definitely has an interesting flavor to it! And I don't mean that in a condescending ""at-least-it-has-that"" tone. This one looks legitimately fun and it seems to have an aesthetic we don't see a lot in this genre, which I look forward to. I'll have to watch out for this one, as well.  Lucky's Tale is the other one I haven't heard of yet. Honestly, it looks a bit bland to me. Its website says that it's being developed exclusively for the Oculus Rift, and it looks like that's the main appeal of it. Nothing about it looks special or interesting. It just looks like a generic 3D platformer with another happy animal protagonist. If anyone can convince me otherwise I'll gladly welcome it, but I just don't feel like I can get behind this one right now."

YookaLaylee,37qhil,rump_truck,7,Fri May 29 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"From the announcement:   In their physical days these articulate phantoms were the scribes behind Yooka-Laylee’s mysterious book worlds.   Free their spirits for a special reward…   From the Kickstarter:   Our main collectible, Pagies, are used to unlock and expand new worlds in Yooka-Laylee.   I'm guessing this is the mechanic for the expanding worlds. They wrote the book worlds, and were subsequently trapped in them. You find them and free them, then you can pay them pagies to have them write sequels for you to explore.  The fact that there are 5 of them is kind of confusing though. Is there one of each in every world? Is there one per world, and only 5 worlds? Some subset, perhaps 2 or 3, in each world?   There are a variety of different types hidden in every world   If it were one per world, it wouldn't make sense to pluralize types. I'm thinking one of each in every world, and each one unlocks a single expansion to that world in exchange for pagies."
YookaLaylee,37qhil,dance1211,2,Fri May 29 18:02:14 2015 UTC,I want to think that the ones shown aren't all of them. If there's going to be a challenge to get them then obvious one of them is going to fly (as opposed to floating around) so one of them will have wings. There could possibly be 20 of them with a handful in each world.
YookaLaylee,37qhil,rump_truck,3,Fri May 29 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"The ghost was originally going to be one character, but I sketched so many thumbnails (50+) it sparked the idea of having 5 separate ghosts with different abilities.   That sort of makes it sound those 5 are all of them. I'm going to guess one of each of the 5 in every world, just like the jinjos in BK.   I'm curious about the different abilities part. Clearly that means they're going to be doing something. Are the abilities platforming related, so that you have to chase them down and catch them? Are they going to be combat related, so you have to fight them? Maybe a few of each?"
YookaLaylee,37qhil,dance1211,2,Fri May 29 19:11:15 2015 UTC,"I think I missed that bit. I don't think it will be directly combat related but, depending on the colour, you have to catch them in different ways like sneak up on one, fight another, chase a third etc."

YookaLaylee,37qhil,usernumber36,0,Fri May 29 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is closer to the right answer. We've heard a lot about expanding current worlds and strange things like being able to beat 'the first final boss' and then go through all the worlds again in a new way. I think these guys are likely to present challenges which, when completed, will allow world modifications and expansions.

YookaLaylee,37qhil,TheMasterDS,1 point,Fri May 29 22:26:34 2015 UTC,You're way off base. I believe they mentioned a sort of Book Thing at the hub area of each world you put the pages in. The Book Thing will not be the ghoulies. The ghoulies are the new Jinjos with a twist.

YookaLaylee,37sbo3,hijuliaa,2,Sat May 30 11:23:41 2015 UTC,I think it's great
YookaLaylee,37sbo3,grangach,2,Mon Jun 1 10:11:57 2015 UTC,Nope I love her nose too.
YookaLaylee,37sbo3,Heatinmyharbl,2,Wed Jun 3 04:29:23 2015 UTC,I hope characters in the game will joke about the nose and make Laylee mad.

YookaLaylee,37sbo3,DudeitsLandon,1 point,Sat May 30 06:16:02 2015 UTC,At first i hated it but i've learned to love it
YookaLaylee,37sbo3,ZebraRT,1 point,Sat May 30 14:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'd like it if the nose was shrunk, just a little."

YookaLaylee,37r50t,WaveParadigm,26,Fri May 29 18:54:05 2015 UTC,"Do people feel like this would get more eyes on it if they did this in the official AMA sub, /r/IAmA? Don't get me wrong, I love this sub, but there are only 3k people subscribed here, compared to 8 MILLION in /r/IAmA.   I think if they do it in that sub, it would get a lot more interest and eyes on the campaign, which means more success for them. Possibly people that don't know about it would be informed of its existence and we can come up with like 5 questions, as a sub, to post over in the /r/IAmA thread.  This sub's reach would expand organically, the closer we get to launch. It happens with almost all games' subs on reddit.  I think I'm going to suggest it to them on the Kickstarter and @ their Twitter, and you all should too! More exposure is a good thing!"
YookaLaylee,37r50t,CityOfChamps09,11,Fri May 29 19:35:53 2015 UTC,Their reasoning is probably that they want to reach more closer fans/backers more easily than having a tsunami of questions and not being able to answer everyone...    But it's true that more exposure is a good thing!
YookaLaylee,37r50t,tobiasvl,3,Fri May 29 23:16:17 2015 UTC,Or we could just crosspost the AMA to /r/IAMA
YookaLaylee,37r50t,CityOfChamps09,2,Mon Jun 1 12:59:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we could, if their rules allow it. If not, we are SoL."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,tobiasvl,2,Mon Jun 1 13:39:45 2015 UTC,Well according to my link to their rules they do
YookaLaylee,37r50t,CityOfChamps09,2,Mon Jun 1 13:57:43 2015 UTC,LOL. Didn't even see that link when I initially replied. Mondays...
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Argobast,10,Mon Jun 1 14:34:15 2015 UTC,How long of a game are they shooting for? Please be Banjo or DK64 length +.
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Secret_Wizard,2,Fri May 29 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"They said ""More content than Banjo-Kazooie,"" so I think we can expect a game that's smaller than Tooie and DK64."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Quicheauchat,3,Mon Jun 1 16:16:31 2015 UTC,I hope its more than BK... The games amazing but its pretty short. I finish it at 100% in less than 3 hours.
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Argobast,2,Wed Jun 3 07:33:43 2015 UTC,"""Content"" though is sort of one of those ambiguous gaming words..."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Skynotik,3,Mon Jun 1 17:23:23 2015 UTC,Are they planning on releasing a trailer this year .. Maybe a lil demo for E3 or juste some kind of update on what they will be doing and things like this ?
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Tidus1117,1 point,Fri May 29 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"There is going to be a ""Playtonic E3 Press Conf"" so we will probably get the latest info there."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,BawssNass,3,Mon Jun 1 16:49:47 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to know how they will handle older players. I played BK as a kid and it was definitely a challenge. I wouldn't leave a level until I had finished it 100%. My skills have slightly increased since then, but I'd still love that same challenge. Is that asking too much, I'm not sure."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,H3l1o5,4,Sat May 30 01:31:56 2015 UTC,Would it hurt to cross post to both /r/Games and /r/gaming so it gets a little more visibility?
YookaLaylee,37r50t,CityOfChamps09,2,Sat May 30 04:08:26 2015 UTC,No it wouldn't hurt. I'm sure some user will do it whenever the time comes. That's what usually happens to gaming related AMAs.  I think the best thing to happen would be to hold the thread at /r/IAmA and then link to that from /r/Games and /r/gaming.
YookaLaylee,37r50t,nickc122,3,Sat May 30 04:58:45 2015 UTC,"Based on the assumption that it's too early for them to reveal much more than they already have, my biggest question: How in the world will they manage to get so many names into the Backer Credits?"
YookaLaylee,37r50t,gossypiboma,3,Fri May 29 20:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope they do a Banjo-Kazooie type credits, with 60000 different characters announcing the backers individually."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Tidus1117,2,Fri May 29 23:32:29 2015 UTC,"In columns, I would guess. Something like this:  http://m.imgur.com/kwVXHez  In that pic there are 270. so depending on how slow they show it it can go from 4 to 10 minutes. Sounds a lot but its not impossible..."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Tidus1117,3,Mon Jun 1 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"Questions:   Are they planning on refilling some tiers/rewards for the campaign? How long does it take Steve Mayles to create a character? I heard originally Yooka was a Tiger, Are we ever gonna see a sketch of this tiger? (We would love too) Has there been any idea or concept in the development of YookaLaylee that has been entirely originated from a fan suggestion or comment? What are the plans for E3? Can you at least tease us regarding what will be showing there? You once asked for idead for Amiibo functionalities. We have not heard back on that topic. Did you guys changed your mind about it? Is there still chance for having a Yooka-Laylee Amiibo?"
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Raregamer99,3,Sat May 30 13:31:30 2015 UTC,When you made Donkey Kong 64 you set a world record for the most collectables in a game. How many are we shooting for this time?
YookaLaylee,37r50t,grangach,3,Mon Jun 1 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"My question is if they're planning on making it difficult. I for one love things like the engine room on grunties ship and having to collect all the notes in a single life, and I hope they don't dumb it down."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Mobius_Whitetalon,2,Mon Jun 1 10:14:59 2015 UTC,"I would expect the Quiz Show end would be for those who blast through on a speed play, where the actual final boss will be for those who get 95 to 100 percent of everything in the game.   That's how it was with BK. Finish the Quiz Show to get Banjo's sister back, which could be done without even seeing all of the game. But to really beat Gruntilda, one needed very close to 100% to open those last Note Doors and grab the extras needed to beat her."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,RobKhonsu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:19:10 2015 UTC,As mentioned in a previous interview they plan on making the the game easy enough for casual and newer gamers alike to be able to beat the final boss; however each level will have very challenging collectables for the hardcore fans to master.
YookaLaylee,37r50t,grangach,3,Mon Jun 1 15:29:36 2015 UTC,Then I would ask if they could make a true final boss that's harder for completionists.
YookaLaylee,37r50t,RobKhonsu,2,Mon Jun 1 19:49:55 2015 UTC,That could be cool and not that absurd of a request. DKC2 had a final-final boss that's similar to this. However I'd ask that this be a DLC item; only available after completing 100% of the game content including DLC content.
YookaLaylee,37r50t,mattjaydunn,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:40:26 2015 UTC,yes this needs to be asked during the AMA 1000000%
YookaLaylee,37r50t,RobKhonsu,3,Tue Jun 2 22:10:09 2015 UTC,There was also an interview held with Beta64 that answers some interesting questions as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKUwOWtqxww
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Octopeart,3,Mon Jun 1 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"One question I have is: From what I've read, it seems like you guys are isolating the levels, as opposed to the interconnected style in Banjo-Tooie. Is there a reason for this beyond avoiding backtracking? It's one of my favorite things about Tooie! I understand why it might not make sense with the worlds being books, though.  (I won't be able to participate in the AMA, if someone asked Playtonic this question that would be swell)"
YookaLaylee,37r50t,ilikpankaks,2,Mon Jun 1 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's feasible for a collectables game, but can there be a new game + mode? Or any idea of one?"
YookaLaylee,37r50t,CityOfChamps09,3,Fri May 29 20:26:07 2015 UTC,"They already stated achieving certain goals or collecting in the levels will ""expand"" the levels, adding additional content to complete for that particular level. I don't know about a traditional game + mode, or how they would pull that off. Maybe higher difficulty AI and different, more challenging puzzles?  edit: From the KS   Expandable Worlds: Experience more of the playgrounds you love by spending collectibles to expand your favourites into bigger, more challenging worlds.

YookaLaylee,37r50t,ilikpankaks,2,Sat May 30 04:55:49 2015 UTC,Ay there's the rub. Thanks for finding that! That's what i figured it would be. Some kind of unlock we would have to go back to pervious levels to find with new abilities.
YookaLaylee,37r50t,ZeldaDrummer,2,Sat May 30 12:00:49 2015 UTC,"If like to know, if they did do amiibo, would it be used like how Splatoon is? It's a smart way to make you work for extra rewards!"
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Vinnyboiler,2,Sat May 30 01:41:43 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of asking if they are going to be open with the development of the game or if they are going to slip into their old famous Rare secrecy once the Kickstarter is over.
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Dispy657,2,Sat May 30 13:35:02 2015 UTC,"Well I would like to know the scope of the pc showcase demoes, the descriptions are a bit vague, will we get a full levels worth? Will it have textures, enemies etc?"
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Spinjitsuninja,2,Sat May 30 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they have at least considered trying to get Banjo-Kazooi back, I know its unlikely they'll try, and Microsoft would probably refuse, but Im curious if they'v considered it..."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,BlakeSwift,1 point,Sun May 31 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"Does Yooka's colour scheme have anything to do with the song ""Karma Chameleon"" ? With the lyrics ""Red, Gold and Green"" ?"
YookaLaylee,37r50t,cazaman11,1 point,Fri May 29 21:00:36 2015 UTC,"With the wide platform launch, what features for the WiiU gameplay screen will be involved, I would assume a generic map and stats but I think it would be cool if there were some other features the gamepad would have such as for playing mini games, or a possible motion control for FPS segments. Now I can understand not everyone likes those controls so maybe an option for it in the settings. One more question on the game pad, will it feature the off screen feature where you can play the game just on the gamepad screen.   Thank you guys for being awesome"

YookaLaylee,37r50t,bloodstainer,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:59:06 2015 UTC,"Have any of you guys ever work on a comic book license video game of The Amazing Spider-Man for the Game Boy? I ask about it because I just watch a video for ""All Your History - Spider-man"" (start at around 1:30) and you use to work with LJM (an Acclaim subsidiary). Is that correct? I didn't even know they work on a comic book video game before.  If so, how did it felt like making a comic book license game? Did anyone ever stick real close to the comic book similar to what you did with a movie license game for Goldeneye 007?  Speaking of PC. Did any of guys ever try to build a PC by customizing their hardware instead of buy a pre-build PC you would normally get at a retailer? I can’t help myself, but I’m one of those people who is happy to be a PC gamer and not on a next gen console (such as the PS4 or Xbox one). Perhaps I didn’t jump in to it because of lack of better exclusives games for that system.   Another downside is some consoles (such as the Xbox one) suffered a couple downscale resolutions. Meanwhile on a PC, there were the first to crack in 4k resolution. It can be achieved if that user has the best looking GPU rig in the market or they can use SLI/Crossfire support.   I enjoy some console games, but it get pretty expensive. I want to stop getting a couple console games and move on to Indie games."

While I was an N64 kid growing up, shortly there after I've primarily been a PC guy. Even when I go back to play games like Mario Sunshine I elect to play on a KB&M even though I always have a 360 pad available. I just prefer the experience and enjoy figuring out the most optimal control scheme to master the game. Just last weekend I replayed through Darksiders on PC and while the KB&M options got the job done, they left A LOT to be desired.  I'd really like to hear their position on designing for the keyboard and mouse, or even the Steampad for both this project and perhaps future projects (Perfect Dark spiritual successor?)"

YookaLaylee,37r50t,Joshers744,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:08:28 2015 UTC,Can we ask questions about Rare? Cause I have a few  1) Was it true Nintendo originally purchased 5-10% stake in Rare and gave them additional funding in exchange for more stock in the company over the years?  2) Were you approached to make a Metroid game for the N64?
YookaLaylee,37r50t,ozdarka,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:11:17 2015 UTC,"I might be busy at work, but I'd like to thank them first of all for all the love they have put into their work for years. As a kid, some of my favorite games where made from Rare back in the 90's. I still have the plush Banjo and a Mumbo costume my grandma made for me using the Mumbo plush as a model. A lot of good times with my dad in games like the DKC series as well. Also, I'm a bit curious if they are considering doing anything with amiibo with the Wii U version."

I'd imagine that if they are only able to keep the 5 worlds, and each can be expanded at least twice, it gives us room for an ""Easy"" level, a ""Medium"" and a ""Hard"" level of challenge within each world. Hopefully we'll find out more about how they plan to implement that today."
YookaLaylee,37r50t,Joggingkangaroo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:56:58 2015 UTC,For real I hope the Wii U version supports the Wii classic controller and Wii U Pro controller because I don't like being forced to use the gamepad when I'm already using another controller.

Right now, what has been revealed is a jungle world and concept art for an ice world. Both are really imaginative and beautiful to look at, but I guess what I could ask is whether we will be getting something a little more out of left field for a world, like Grunty's theme park in Tooie.

I feel as though it's already over, the only stretch goal left is for an expansion in the future, nothing tangible to me in the next year probably. However, that's probably how the team wanted it to be. They have all the money they could have wanted for the game so now it's just all gravy. They plan on making more money selling the game, not gaming the kickstarter."
YookaLaylee,37me51,loofawah,2,Fri May 29 06:47:55 2015 UTC,I backed both bloodstained and yookalaylee and I gotta say IGA is handling the kickstarter way better. They send out emails like 2 times a week with new stuff in them while I rarely get YookaLaylee one that has much in it. Plus the bloodstained has those fan achievement stuff that's a pretty neat idea to keep people interested.
YookaLaylee,37me51,Happypumkin,2,Fri May 29 17:05:09 2015 UTC,I'd rather the devs focus on the game itself rather than the kickstarter
YookaLaylee,37me51,Jwalla83,2,Fri May 29 19:08:52 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the bloodstained devs are working on the game and have a different person working on the kickstarter.

YookaLaylee,37me51,sir_chadwell_heath,1 point,Sat May 30 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"You're right, I suppose.  I find I am really disappointed with the content of the rewards and the attitude of the developers towards the campaign.  There's no reason why there shouldn't be a two-copy reward at a lower level than $109.  The devs should have revised it when they saw demand for it.  This game is the definition of crowdfunded, since it's in response to demand from the public for a revival of Banjo-Kazooie, so I feel like the devs should be more receptive to public demand.  Maybe I'm overstating my entitlement, but that's how I feel.    I really wanted them to be the most successful game kickstarter ever, but they don't seem to care about that.  They aren't required to, but I wonder why they don't.  More money for a small amount of effort seems worth it to me."
YookaLaylee,37me51,kemitche,7,Fri May 29 13:07:09 2015 UTC,"More money for a small amount of effort seems worth it to me.   But they blew past their initial (though modest) goal by a factor of 10x. If they believe it's enough and want to focus on making the game instead of tooting their own horn, that's fine by me! I'd rather they underpromise and overdeliver."
YookaLaylee,37me51,loofawah,3,Fri May 29 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"I understand, and I'm in the same boat. I got downvoted to hell for saying they should be more active in their campaign (older thread). They definitely could make more money, but they are happy with the status status quo."
YookaLaylee,37me51,TheMasterDS,4,Fri May 29 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"E3 is coming. Let's wait and see how the last day goes.  Additionally, yeah, Bloodstained is asking for more money for the base game. It's ""get the game"" tier is around 28 rather than around 20. Makes sense it's making more money per backer as a result. If it didn't that'd raise questions about charging more for the ""get the game"" tier. What the point of it was."
YookaLaylee,37me51,VeritasUnae,3,Fri May 29 13:59:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, clearly Playtonic already had enough money to start working on their game, and are likely using Kickstarter first and foremost as an easy thing people can share to their friends (it does say roughly 20000 more people have backed Y-L) to get the word out. I haven't heard of this other game until now, but everyone I talk to in my gaming community is a-buzz about Y-L.  They have the money for the game they want to make, and they don't want people to feel too obliged to dip in any more, except maybe at a lower tier to get the game themselves. (which, as someone else pointed out, is at a lower cost to this other game - it's actually around $15 USD compared to the $28 USD)  i sort of want this other game now that i know about it though"
YookaLaylee,37me51,kemitche,7,Fri May 29 21:51:35 2015 UTC,"I don't care if Yooka-Laylee beats any records - they've almost certainly been funded enough to have a good chance at making a solid product, and that's all I can hope for!"
YookaLaylee,37me51,hitalec,2,Fri May 29 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that Yooka-Kaylee has rather modest goals. They hope to get the game out sooner than Bloodstained. I mean, Bloodstained doesn't even have a gameplay demo and is set for a 2017 release, so they can probably afford to play around with cool ideas like the whole metagame, achievement system.   Rare was always a secretive bunch, Yooka is the absolute most open they've ever been about a project. I don't mind it as much since it seems relatively consistent of them to hold back and not want to overestimate their stretch goals."

As for my own bias opinion though, I hope Yooka-Laylee takes the lead and makes more records from here."
YookaLaylee,37nif6,Cookaie,10,Thu May 28 23:00:59 2015 UTC,"This game is a ""spiritual successor"" to the acclaimed Rare games of old, namely Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo Tooie.  When Microsoft acquired Rare, a lot of the guys who worked there quit. Now, so many years later, those same guys have come back together (under the name Playtonic Games) to create a game just like the ones we used to love.  If you like(d) games like Banjo-Kazooie or Donkey Kong 64, you should definitely look into Yooka-Laylee."
YookaLaylee,37nif6,Swerdman55,5,Thu May 28 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, never really played Banjo-Kazooie or heard Banjo Tooie, but what I heard from Reddit and overall the internet playing the games is equal to hearing and feeling the mist from the palace of eternal fantasticness until the end of time."
YookaLaylee,37nif6,hhhnnnnnggggggg,15,Thu May 28 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"Banjo-Kazooie was like a better version of Mario 64. If you liked Mario 64, then you would have liked BK."

YookaLaylee,37nif6,Swerdman55,5,Fri May 29 09:45:03 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree. BK and BT (and even DK64) made up a big portion of my childhood and I keep a very special place in my heart for them.  However, I would advise you to try and play them before you start to fund/get involved in YK. Not all games are for everyone, plus, you get to enjoy the games for the first time!  (If you don't have access to an N64, the games have also been released on the Xbox Live Marketplace with some updated graphics and a few improvements. Definitely check them out if you can!)"
YookaLaylee,37nif6,Swerdman55,1 point,Thu May 28 23:10:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have an Xbox lying around. Is using an emulator legal? Because I used to use them, I stopped for a few years before I started hearing how they are illegal. That IS a vague memory though, so that might not be true."
YookaLaylee,37nif6,shyPiano,3,Thu May 28 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, emulators are fine. The tricky part comes with the ROMs. Since you're downloading the ROM of a game you don't own it's technically illegal. It's pretty much the same of pirating a game for PC or music."
YookaLaylee,37nif6,Darldmeir,2,Thu May 28 23:15:36 2015 UTC,Aha. Would you recommend I do it to see if I would like this style of game? I still have a N64 emulator lying somewhere in my files...
YookaLaylee,37nif6,shyPiano,5,Thu May 28 23:22:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not going to publicly condone something illegal, but I will say that a lot of people do it with absolutely no repercussions. And that it is a good way to test out a game you don't have access to."
YookaLaylee,37nif6,stormforce5,2,Thu May 28 23:28:54 2015 UTC,"While arguably the weakest of the Rare N64 Colect-a-thons, Donkey Kong 64 is available through the Nintendo e-shop for Wii U. As said previously, Banjo-Kazzoie and Banjo-Tooie are aslo available for the XBox 360.  This, as far as I am aware of, are the only ways to experience these games legally nowadays. With the exception of actually owning an original N64 and the original cartridges, of course.  Also, just want to emphasize the fact that it's not the emulator itself that is illegal. Emulators, as far as I know, are not a problem in that regard. Downloading the games from the Internet, however, is - just as it is for recent titles. This means you could, technically speaking, import the game from an original cartridge you owned to a PC, and play that using the emulator, and that would be OK! In practice, however, retrieving the ROM from the original cartridge is not the easiest thing in the world."
YookaLaylee,37nif6,dogman15,3,Fri May 29 00:02:31 2015 UTC,The statement about DK64 being arguably the weakest is kind of deceiving. There are a lot of fans who like that game the most just as there are those who like BK and BT. What's important is that they are all fantastic games from a genre that is pretty Rare today.
YookaLaylee,37nif6,Secret_Wizard,1 point,Fri May 29 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of fans who like that game the most   Hence it being ""arguably"" - some would argue that is the case, and some would argue that isn't the case. However, I have noticed more criticism of Donkey Kong 64 than Banjo-Kazooie or Banjo-Tooie, which is why I felt the need to warn that, well, YMMV - it might or might not be the best possible offer out there.  That being said, I never played any of these three games, so I can't really comment much on their quality, other than what I've heard others say.  I'm planning on playing through Donkey Kong 64 this summer though! :) In preparation for Yooka-Laylee!"
YookaLaylee,37nif6,Joshers744,2,Fri May 29 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"I love BK, and I have DK64 coming in the mail. It looks really fun! Hopefully it lives up to my expectations.  Edit: If you haven't played Banjo Kazooie yet, I'd recommend getting that first. Yooka Laylee is looking to be more similar to that and it seems to be much easier in the collectathon department. I'd play through BK first to see if you're even into collectathons, as I hear DK64 is BK's collecting times 10 and it may turn you off (Waiting to play it soon, so take this with a grain of salt)."
YookaLaylee,37nif6,Live-Hedgehog,2,Thu Jun 4 07:31:14 2015 UTC,Donkey Kong 64 is on the Wii U Virtual Console.
YookaLaylee,37r6ou,Jamezlap,3,Fri May 29 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"They probably will. This is the same team that made Donkey Kong Country, and Banjo-Kazooie. So, they not only know how to make games in the first place, they know how to work on games with budgets this large as well."
YookaLaylee,37r6ou,Kaminoshi,3,Fri May 29 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"If Playtonic can't manage to make a good 3D platformer, no one can. These guys are pure talent."
YookaLaylee,37r6ou,UndaKuva,1 point,Fri May 29 20:03:19 2015 UTC,"Playtonic has one thing over other Kickstarter backed game devs that makes me trust them. An actual playable proof of concept game demo.  Look at a lot of the most famous Kickstarters that either succeeded or flopped (Project Eternity, Mighty No. 9, Double Fine Adventure), and tell me if they had a playable game when they initially went live. Of course they didn't. All they had was concept art and ideas, no actual implementation.  Meanwhile, Playtonic tells us about their concept months before their Kickstarter goes live, and capitalizes on that concept by making a fully playable showcase in 3 months time. We get to see actual evidence that they're working on a game, not just ideas for a game.  Kickstarter should be about kickstarting actual projects and products, not ideas for them, and Playtonic seems to understand this.  As for the game being a disappointment, I only see it being that way if you want the game to be an almost absolute carbon copy of Banjo-Kazooie with no original ideas or risk taking. I'm expecting it probably won't be as memorable as the adventures of Banjo and Kazooie or the Kong Family due to nostalgia reasons, but I still think it'll be a solid game that will be remembered years later."
YookaLaylee,37r6ou,Rahu_X,1 point,Fri May 29 23:22:05 2015 UTC,"The game was always going to come out on their own money. The Kickstarter money just ensures that they can spend more time developing it.

I like Rayman 2, I like DK64, I like Mario 64...but that pair beats the lot of them soundly in my book.  It's like a childhood dream come true to be involved in Yooka-Laylee, even in a small way."
YookaLaylee,37c9eb,Spinetablet,2,Tue May 26 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"I grabbed the 64 bit package on day 1, and I am still very excited about that."
YookaLaylee,37c9eb,WaveParadigm,2,Tue May 26 16:53:46 2015 UTC,I want to see my name in the credits!
YookaLaylee,37c9eb,Dragonmind,2,Tue May 26 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"Not a reward, but I'm really excited for the N64 Shader mode and the GK rap!"
YookaLaylee,37c9eb,selebu,1 point,Wed May 27 04:15:37 2015 UTC,I still have no Orchestra comparison of Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts.  It's such a unique soundtrack and I can't wait for more with Yooka Laylee!
YookaLaylee,37c9eb,Secret_Wizard,1 point,Tue May 26 18:09:14 2015 UTC,I would love the 64 bit package but I'm too poor for it. I would have also loved to voice a character...   Anyway I will be more than happy with the physical artbook!

YookaLaylee,37c9eb,BaronBrain,1 point,Tue May 26 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to be a backer to help Playtonic — in some small way — create this wonderful game. But I do have a question about the Rewards… as the ones I'm most excited for are Playtonic is reluctant to offer.     I backed at the Deluxe Physical Release reward tier with caveat, I personally do NOT purchase digital-only games or DLC (really… never), so my choice was quite limited.     Why then does the Deluxe Physical Edition come in a PC-only flavor when a Mac version is also being concurrently prepared? Have we leapt backwards in time to the Dark Ages of Computing, where ""mysterious unwritten rules"" hold that PC & OSX versions cannot co-exist within the same ""Deluxe"" retail package?     As we live in the supposedly far-more-enlightened year of 2015, why aren't they BOTH sharing space on the same replicated disc, or each given their own platter in a ""Deluxe"" two-disc set? This certainly isn't an unusual request…     At the very least Playtonic, why aren't backers given a ""preferred version"" option? I personally don't own a PC, I have a Mac… and out of the (currently) 5,421 backers, I'm sure quite a few are Mac users as well. And no doubt they'd all prefer to be running a native OSX version. If we had a choice, of course.  [Addendum: Seems the name of the reward was merely a poor choice of words. Playtonic already responded that the disc will contain PC/Mac/Linux copies of the game. Sweet!]     But the reward I truly want doesn't even exist — a Deluxe Physical PS4 edition…or even just a standard one. I wrote Playtonic about this a while back, and they responded no retail console versions are (currently) in the works. The only way Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo would authorize such is if a proper developer publisher (d'oh!) steps up to the plate to release the console version(s).     Considering how quickly Yooka-Laylee was funded, and by how much, I find it quite surprising this hasn't occurred — the demand is quite obviously there. Hopefully a developer somewhere on this planet will come to their senses and sign a development deal with Playtonic to release it at the retail level. But I'm not holding my breath.     Thank you for the consideration Playtonic — I look forward to playing your game."
YookaLaylee,37c9eb,jdmoser,2,Fri May 29 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean ""publisher"" instead of ""developer"" in your last two paragraphs?  Additionally, your last line makes me suspect that you think I'm a representative from Playtonic.  Trust me, I'd pack up and move to England in a heartbeat if they'd have me, but as of this writing I am just a fan like yourself.  A fan with a Bachelor's in Business Administration, who double-majored in Economics and Management, has two years of experience doing data analysis projects for the government, and has made a private study out of game design (wink wink, Playtonic, nudge nudge), but just a fan nonetheless."
YookaLaylee,37d0tl,CrazyMusicTheorist,15,Tue May 26 19:00:36 2015 UTC,If you are referring to the console versions it means that they will release the same day as the pc versions. it refers the the release date of the game which is not when the Kickstarter is over its in October of 2016 I believe.
YookaLaylee,37d0tl,Guthor,-1,Tue May 26 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm just referring to the (british pound sign here) 175,000 reward, ""PC, MAC, & Linux release DAY ONE!"""
YookaLaylee,37d0tl,askyourmom469,13,Tue May 26 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"Meaning that those will all be released simultaniously, not immediately after the kickstarter."
YookaLaylee,37d0tl,Guthor,3,Tue May 26 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, gotcha! Thanks!"
YookaLaylee,37d0tl,TheMusicalEconomist,3,Tue May 26 19:40:11 2015 UTC,Yeah when the game releases it will be on those platforms first then consoles later. We raised enough that all will release the same day but it's not once the Kickstarter is over. Its gonna take a while.
YookaLaylee,37d0tl,JiggyJinjo,0,Tue May 26 19:51:27 2015 UTC,I gotcha. Thanks!

YookaLaylee,375rpb,Sato_Satellite,2,Mon May 25 03:28:25 2015 UTC,Probably. Big Kickstarters like this always pick up at the end. And it's been doing decently even in this slow mid-campaign days to get there. Kicktraq's estimated total is currently 3.2 million pounds.  http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/playtonic/yooka-laylee-a-3d-platformer-rare-vival/
YookaLaylee,375rpb,Kewl0210,5,Mon May 25 04:51:30 2015 UTC,Those estimates are based on a total divided by number of day and aren't accurate. The projection is much more meaningful: http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/playtonic/yooka-laylee-a-3d-platformer-rare-vival/#chart-exp-projection  It should ideally go above the exponential projection because of the last few day push. It's already on track to get between 1.84 and 2.07 if it just keeps the current pace (not including burst at the end).
YookaLaylee,375rpb,loofawah,1 point,Tue May 26 17:30:48 2015 UTC,4 Million or bust!
YookaLaylee,375rpb,Kitsyfluff,1 point,Mon May 25 08:07:06 2015 UTC,it's possible! hope so... but it has slowed down a lot. do kickstarters pick up towards the last days or do they just dwindle and stop over time?
YookaLaylee,375rpb,chriskicks,2,Mon May 25 12:25:35 2015 UTC,"They generally do pick up over the last couple of days.  Looking through a couple of the top funded projects:   Exploding Kittens OUYA Veronica Mars movie   But then again, it doesn't always happen."
YookaLaylee,375rpb,JorWat,2,Mon May 25 15:08:32 2015 UTC,"Kickstarters that haven't made it always have bowl-shaped pledge graphs, with most of the pledges on the first two and last two days while all the days in the center are basically flatlined. But if the kickstarter has already made it's main goal, the last days of pledges are unpredictable and sometimes a final spike doesn't happen."
YookaLaylee,375rpb,AdeonWriter,1 point,Mon May 25 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"The first and Last 48 hours of any kickstarter/Indiegog are usually the most busy. If we get close enough in range, then we'll definitely see it in the last 2 days. If we don't hit it before then."
YookaLaylee,375rpb,Shujinco2,1 point,Wed May 27 10:34:20 2015 UTC,"I really hope so, that's a damned awesome stretch goal. I have a feeling it'll make it but probably not by a lot."

YookaLaylee,375rpb,warriorseeker,-11,Mon May 25 04:33:18 2015 UTC,"Idk if this is just me, but I feel like the idea of DLC itself detracts from the N64 ideology."
YookaLaylee,375rpb,mouseywithpower,11,Mon May 25 04:49:11 2015 UTC,"They're not trying to make a Nintendo 64 game, though. They've said in at least one interview that they're trying to bring the genre back, and avoiding DLC for the sole reason of it not having the capability to exist on a nineteen-year-old console isn't gonna help with that. Plus, the fact that they're not working on it until after they've finished the game itself tells me that it'll probably be the good kind of DLC, not just stupid stuff that they threw together to make an extra buck."
YookaLaylee,375rpb,warriorseeker,7,Mon May 25 06:56:39 2015 UTC,"this abject hatred for DLC in all forms is so childish and short-sighted, i can't possibly fathom how blind one must be to denounce every single instance of DLC done right in order to damn the whole practice."

YookaLaylee,36yqm7,valahart,3,Sat May 23 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this kickstarter but I think Mighty Number 9 decided to add it to the total once their kickstarter was over, which then led to the next stretch goal being met, maybe Playtonic will do something similar?"
YookaLaylee,36yqm7,Dispy657,2,Thu May 28 08:48:18 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there is a way to add the paypal backers to the kickstarter total, they will have to track it every so often and post it onto the main ks page. Or perhaps they will wait until the end to total everything up."

YookaLaylee,36u5vl,jdmoser,32,Fri May 22 04:22:47 2015 UTC,"Taking into consideration that Banjo was a bear and Yooka is a chameleon, the weight differences are astounding. Infact it's much more believable that a bat could pick up a chameleon then a bird could pick up a bear"
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,Hurricane12112,11,Fri May 22 04:47:14 2015 UTC,I did the math and this checks out
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,Multivers,1 point,Fri May 22 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"A pound of feathers weighs the same as a pound of bricks.  That is to say a chameleon and a bear that are the same size probably weigh roughly the same, and I don't think Yooka's wings would be able to support that weight.  I don't really care either way though, it's supposed to be silly."
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,DrBob3002,3,Fri May 29 17:08:59 2015 UTC,how do you suppose they are the same size?
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,Hurricane12112,12,Sat May 30 00:10:09 2015 UTC,a large bird carrying a bear in yellow shorts with a backpack wasn't absurd?
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,tokyozombie,7,Fri May 22 07:25:29 2015 UTC,I kind of like that they're comically small...she's like a tiny powerhouse.
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,lumpybread,4,Fri May 22 05:01:17 2015 UTC,"That picture of BK is of Kazooie using the flight pad I think. What you're referring to would be the double tap ""A"" jump.   Anyway, I think that bigger wings would look odd on Laylee, but I'm open to all changes."
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,stormforce5,-5,Fri May 22 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"it does look a bit unrealistic to say that she's capable of carrying yooka though, maybe if we complain about it enough they'll include a retort from laylee on how she can do it because she's really strong or something.  I'm in favour of slightly larger wings though.  But I imagine it'd be a hassle since they've already incorporated the current model, and like, moves and stuff, would all have to be remade."
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,Ziazan,1 point,Fri May 22 04:02:25 2015 UTC,I'm sure Laylee's wings would just become huge when needed for a particular move. Kazooie's did.
YookaLaylee,36u5vl,AdeonWriter,2,Sun May 31 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"If there's anything wrong with Laylee's design, it's probably her big nose. Either way, I trust the artists' and animators' decisions and I think she looks really good, good enough that she's not worth changing anyway. Besides, a chameleon is much lighter than a bear, so if anything was more absurd, Banjo and Kazooie flying was."

YookaLaylee,36n26v,InMyRestlessDreams,4,Mon May 25 16:50:00 2015 UTC,They confirmed it's not kinect and a job posting says their project is a triple A adventure game. Yet another thing pointing to Banjo Threeie. Also Playtonic said the kickstarter ending on the first day of E3 was no coincidence. That along with them saying we'll love Rare's new project...  fingers crossed  I actually loved Nuts and Bolts. It was a great game. Just not what people wanted.

YookaLaylee,36n26v,supamesican,5,Wed May 20 17:10:44 2015 UTC,"They actually have more old people than people think. There was a lost circulating around Neogaf which I can't find.  The new project is being headed by Greg Mayles who designed all the Banjo games and they still have Robin Beanland. Not to mention that there's nothing wrong with new talent. Everyone was new talent at some point.   I mean, Rare hasn't really made bad games since Microsoft bought them. Viva Pinata and Nuts and Bolts were both great and competently made games on all fronts (even if Nuts and Bolts wasn't the Banjo game we wanted). It's really just that they haven't done anything much besides kinect in the past few years. Rare isn't Double Helix or LJN or anything. They're a genuinely talented studio. They just haven't been making games based on what fans wanted. Which funnily enough is what Rare has always done according to the old devs."
YookaLaylee,36n26v,supamesican,2,Wed May 20 16:19:35 2015 UTC,"I think they could pull it off, too. Let's not forget that another great studio, Retro Studios, also doesn't have as many of the old folks they used to have, but they're still pulling out great games like Tropical Freeze. I think they could do Threeie if they all really worked towards it."
YookaLaylee,36n26v,supamesican,3,Wed May 20 21:50:18 2015 UTC,And there is a tiny chance it will come to PC after a certain time. Microsoft exclusives that aren't Halo or Gears Of War seem to end up on Steam. We can hope!

YookaLaylee,36n26v,TheMasterDS,1 point,Wed May 20 17:03:05 2015 UTC,I kinda feel like if a game does that it will be this one not a banjo one. But heck I do like 3d platformers so whatever it takes to get more. Especially if they are decently priced(ie less than $60)
YookaLaylee,36n26v,darthfodder,1 point,Wed May 20 17:10:13 2015 UTC,I feel like Rare would make Banjo-Threeie $60 unfortunately. Hopefully I'm wrong.
YookaLaylee,36odd4,valahart,13,Wed May 20 21:19:52 2015 UTC,Alright.   This is how kickstarter works :   First 3 days the money flows in  the next 70% of the kickstarter slows down  The last 3 days it picks up and starts flowing again
YookaLaylee,36odd4,Kluddette,2,Wed May 20 21:59:53 2015 UTC,I'd love to see a source on this.
YookaLaylee,36odd4,hitalec,3,Thu May 21 17:45:15 2015 UTC,Every popular kick starter ever
YookaLaylee,36odd4,Kelsig,3,Fri May 22 02:27:57 2015 UTC,"No, like, you know, actual statistics? Verifiable proof?"
YookaLaylee,36odd4,hitalec,0,Fri May 22 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, google kick starter funding statistics."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,Kelsig,6,Fri May 22 03:18:08 2015 UTC,"Slightly concerned, yes.  If you take the lower end of the daily pledges, you see it's around 8000 pounds. For the remainder of the days it would mean we would not reach the goal. However I read several times that the last few days are as big as the first days so that gives me hope. Also the addition of PayPal will get some extra donations in."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,selebu,6,Wed May 20 21:51:22 2015 UTC,"The last few days are always at least comparable to the first few, and occasionally exceed them by a good margin. A very large number of users click the remind me later button next to pledge, and well be notified when the campaign has 48 hours remaining, this is when you will see the second spike."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,_gl_hf_,6,Thu May 21 01:18:33 2015 UTC,"Meh.... it would be fantastic if they reached it. But the previous stretch goal says ""additional funding also helps us to continue to polish the game to the Nth degree!"" So even if we don't make it, the project is still better off because it's already got £160,000+ worth of additional polish.  Also, the final goal is for whether or not backers get the DLC free... not whether or not they make DLC. Worse case scenario, backers pay for the DLC. Personally, I wouldn't have any complaints doing so... worth it ;)"
YookaLaylee,36odd4,jdmoser,2,Wed May 20 22:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah seriously, we're talking about a worst-case scenario where you have to spend a few extra dollars for extra missions that the team will be working hard on. Even a child shouldn't have much trouble saving up their allowance to pay for it. It's hardly something to be terribly worried about."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,CaptainPorcupine2,2,Wed May 20 22:17:28 2015 UTC,"Well,there are plenty of Europeans not able to back it because we don't have created the cards and Kickstarter doesn't support PayPal."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,TLoFF,1 point,Thu May 21 07:24:32 2015 UTC,well that sucks. But such is life the game will be great regardless.
YookaLaylee,36odd4,supamesican,1 point,Thu May 21 18:24:59 2015 UTC,"They have PayPal support now. It's not a part of Kickstarter, however, they're supporting it separately. They'll probably total the PayPal money and KS money at the end and apply whichever funding tier reward corresponds to that total."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,nin9tyfour,2,Sun May 24 02:37:08 2015 UTC,"No, we'll make it. The last few days will bring in a fair chunk of money, especially if Yooka-Laylee appears during E3 conferences in a big way as we're expecting."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,TheMasterDS,1 point,Thu May 21 14:18:21 2015 UTC,"I just checked Kicktraq (never heard of it before) and it says that the Yooka Laylee kickstarter is ""trending toward"" making £3,918,301 by the end (whatever that means, sounds awfully high to me...). What metric are you talking about?"
YookaLaylee,36odd4,CaptainPorcupine2,2,Wed May 20 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the difference between the ""trending"" and the ""projection"". But if you search the graphics options you'll see a projection in which it gets a little less than £2 million."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,hsxp,3,Wed May 20 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"""Trending"" is a linear extrapolation assuming the average daily pledge total stays the same for the rest of the campaign, ie (current_level ÷ days_so_far) * total_days_in_campaign. ""Projection"" is a more complicated statistical confidence interval that takes into account that the first few days are super intense for a kickstarter and that pledges follow a differential curve and not a linear one.  tldr projection is better"
YookaLaylee,36odd4,selebu,1 point,Thu May 21 18:39:38 2015 UTC,Thx!
YookaLaylee,36odd4,RadzPrower,2,Thu May 21 23:49:24 2015 UTC,"Well, trending calculates the daily pledge amount and just sums it up till the end of the campaign. However, the huge sums from the first days are included in this calculation, and therefore it's not very accurate. The calculated daily pledge amount is way too big."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,Tencha,1 point,Thu May 21 02:02:25 2015 UTC,There's a good chance it will make it.  I know I personally have not pledged until the end with my previous backings.  Many don't pledge because of stretch goals they want to hit first or they want to be sure they'll have the money when it comes time to pay.  This one is different due to the end date since I get paid on the 15th so I know I'll have the money when it comes time to pay up.
YookaLaylee,36odd4,stormforce5,1 point,Thu May 21 03:29:12 2015 UTC,I think we made it.
YookaLaylee,36odd4,Tencha,1 point,Fri May 22 00:54:14 2015 UTC,"I don't really care about reaching that goal. It seems I'm the only one who feels this way, but after the game is released I'd rather have them to start to develop a new game instead of DLC. Look at Shovel Knight. They got so much money they are now developing free DLC, starting with Plague of Shadows. And although it's a cool idea to control Plague Knight, it doesn't really look as interesting as the main game. I hope this doesn't happen to Yooka-Leylee."
YookaLaylee,36odd4,stormforce5,6,Wed May 20 23:26:03 2015 UTC,From what I understand they're working on DLC either way.
YookaLaylee,36odd4,surrenderthenight,1 point,Thu May 21 01:41:57 2015 UTC,"They never said anything about that, or did they?"
YookaLaylee,36lro2,Opixer,7,Wed May 20 09:21:50 2015 UTC,I think they will considering how much they're focusing on making both characters equal as opposed to Laylee being Yooka's sidekick.
YookaLaylee,36lro2,NaClO_Official,1 point,Wed May 20 12:02:03 2015 UTC,from all of the interviews Playtonic has done it seems like this is what they will focus on. I am interested in seeing how they will manage to give them both equal play-appeal throughout the game.
YookaLaylee,36lro2,Dispy657,3,Wed May 20 12:53:50 2015 UTC,"One thing I'm worried is how smaller Laylee is. I mean, it would feel weird having a separation mechanic like Tooie. Wouldn't it?"
YookaLaylee,36lro2,valahart,2,Wed May 20 14:19:50 2015 UTC,"Based on the Gamexplain interview, it sounds like they're not going to split up."
YookaLaylee,36lro2,askyourmom469,1 point,Wed May 20 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, I imagined that. I was just hoping maybe in the next game, as that mechanic added a lot to Tooie."
YookaLaylee,36lro2,valahart,1 point,Wed May 20 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"I know it's not a full seperation mechanic, but I'd like to be able to have Laylee be boosted/thrown by Yooka and fly around a bit to reach new areas. Once Laylee landed, Yooka would grapple onto her with his tongue and pull himself up"
YookaLaylee,36lro2,DigRatChild,1 point,Fri May 22 03:29:26 2015 UTC,Kind of like the classic DKC trilogy then....
YookaLaylee,36lro2,valahart,1 point,Fri May 22 03:33:41 2015 UTC,I am excited for Chameleon twist style gameplay with that tongue.
YookaLaylee,36lro2,Kitsyfluff,3,Fri May 22 12:11:23 2015 UTC,did it really matter that kazooie didn't transform? kazooie did almost everything from the attacks to the pad abilities to running with the talon trot. banjo needed more love.
YookaLaylee,36lro2,tokyozombie,2,Thu May 21 00:43:11 2015 UTC,"Laylee can't hide in a backpack, so that's one reason to make her transform as well."
YookaLaylee,36lro2,selebu,1 point,Wed May 20 15:59:53 2015 UTC,Wasn't Kazooie able to transform into a dragon in Tooie? Maybe we can get a dragon bat in this game :D
YookaLaylee,36idi7,Tatortotts,22,Tue May 19 16:43:20 2015 UTC,Here's the hi-res version.
YookaLaylee,36idi7,neillium,18,Tue May 19 16:44:14 2015 UTC,Here is a .gifv version of it I uploaded. It'll cut down on the loading time. All the credit still goes to Playtonic!  Edit: Here is a gyfcat version. I think it retained more of the FPS than the imgur upload did.
YookaLaylee,36idi7,HowieGaming,3,Tue May 19 16:48:26 2015 UTC,But that isn't 60 FPS though.
YookaLaylee,36idi7,neillium,8,Tue May 19 17:33:25 2015 UTC,"But 24 FPS is more cinematic!   Seriously though, it does seem to have lost some frames when it was uploaded. Not sure why that happened!"
YookaLaylee,36idi7,HowieGaming,3,Tue May 19 17:35:30 2015 UTC,The gfycat one fixed it! :D Looks really good now.
YookaLaylee,36idi7,Sorez,9,Tue May 19 17:41:42 2015 UTC,Thats adorable! <3

YookaLaylee,36idi7,HowieGaming,12,Tue May 19 17:37:14 2015 UTC,October 2016
YookaLaylee,36idi7,GrayMagicGamma,12,Tue May 19 20:00:21 2015 UTC,Assuming no delays- this is coming from the team that intended Kameo to be a GameCube launch title.
YookaLaylee,36idi7,HowieGaming,1 point,Wed May 20 00:19:27 2015 UTC,Oh damn. Didn't know that. Just backed it yesterday actually.   Byt only to some backers?

YookaLaylee,36idi7,Thili905,1 point,Tue May 19 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"No a ""fanboy"" hasnt declare anything except the uselessness of always complaining about the same asinine detail thats been explained away by developer. A complaint that had threads made every 20 minutes about it for a week after the kickstarter begun. Its a conversation that no longer needs to be had. Okay mongoloid?  Edit: much better to delete a post and pretend it never happened ;)"
YookaLaylee,36idi7,stormforce5,-2,Tue May 19 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Is Yooka a boy or a girl? I'm still not sure :/  But yes I agree, a lot of Banjo's charm (For me at least) was what he was wearing."
YookaLaylee,36idi7,initialsdrummer,4,Wed May 20 15:56:07 2015 UTC,They confirmed Yooka was male and Laylee was female
YookaLaylee,36idi7,stormforce5,2,Wed May 20 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the reply!  Edit: Also, why is TerrenceChill being downvoted? He's just making a harmless suggestion..."
YookaLaylee,36idi7,Zombiebucks,2,Thu May 21 00:00:18 2015 UTC,I'm going to assume it's because Playtonic already said they aren't going to have Yooka wear anything. Instead we get a snake with pants (or were they shorts? and I think his name is trousers).
YookaLaylee,36fh7v,Vabawoo,4,Mon May 18 23:50:51 2015 UTC,How long is it and how deep is the gameplay? I'll probably just download it anyway.

YookaLaylee,36fcjx,thelightforest,1 point,Wed May 20 02:15:15 2015 UTC,It's one of my favorites GameCube games. Sad the franchise has been treated so poorly on this side of the world only receiving crappy spin offs :(  I'd give everything for the other DS game to be released in english!
YookaLaylee,36fcjx,Stellefeder,1 point,Tue May 19 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"Seconded! It's a weird little game, and is very hard to explain to other people, but it is very great!   The sequels are less than stellar, so stick with the GC one."
YookaLaylee,36fcjx,MisterMuertos,10,Tue May 19 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"Edit: added more games, put info about a big bug with Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy, and added some links.  Good list, I'd add in Spyro as was already mentioned, along with maybe adding the Sly Cooper games and Kingsley's Adventure for the Playstion One for a lesser known title.  Some other games to consider: Scaler Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy1 TY the Tasmanian Tiger Series Rayman (2|3) Links to GOG store pages. Beyond Good & Evil (GOG|Steam) Croc Gex   and to a lesser extent: Metal Arms: Glitch in the System - more of a Ratchet & Clank than Banjo-Kazooie. Vexx Voodoo Vince Tonic Trouble   I'll see about adding some more as I remember them/find them in my collection.   1 There is a real bad bug in this game that can stop you from progressing. Basically on the Mummy's visit to ""Castle of Uruk"" there is a cutscene involving Set, if you save at a nearby save statue and quit. When you restart the game the door you need to go through is closed and there is no way to open it, making you unable to progress. Most guides will mention when this happens, but be careful when saving as the Mummy."

YookaLaylee,36fcjx,warriorseeker,1 point,Tue May 19 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, A Hat in Time seems to be coming along at a reasonable pace. Beta codes were sent out in March, and the other day they posted an update for Kickstarter backers that described about how much development was left for each chapter. Honestly, I think it should be able to come out early 2016, if not earlier."
YookaLaylee,36fcjx,warriorseeker,1 point,Thu May 21 03:25:37 2015 UTC,"I wish I'd known about that game before Kickstarter was done. Do you mind sending me a message with the backer's update?  I'm actually more anxiously excited about A Hat in Time than Yooka-Laylee.  Don't get me wrong,  I'm absolutely sure the latter will be a masterpiece, but the fact that we don't have even a release window for A Hat in Time, it's been 2 years since the Kickstarter is done and we dont know a lot about the producers, makes me look forward to play it more."
YookaLaylee,36fcjx,Hurricane12112,2,Thu May 21 10:28:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can do that!  I think I'm more excited about A Hat in Time as well, though that may have to do with me not having played through the Banjo games and being able to play the Hat in Time beta, so I have a better idea of what it's going to be like."

I'm just surprised there's no Spyro game on the list, they are classic collect-a-thon platformers with colourful worlds and cartoony, humorous characters."
YookaLaylee,36fcjx,NaClO_Official,2,Mon May 18 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"I've never played Spyro actually, that's why it's not on the list! I keep hearing people talking about it, I'll definitely give it a try soon, thanks!  Which one would you recommend to start?"
YookaLaylee,36fcjx,WaveParadigm,2,Tue May 19 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"Cool, I hope you enjoy it. As for which you should play first, generally I'd tell someone to play them in the order of Spyro 2, then 3, and then 1.  3 probably belongs on this list the most though, so you may want to start there instead. It's up to you."
YookaLaylee,36fcjx,stormforce5,2,Tue May 19 00:33:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for suggesting Spyro! I'm playing Spyro 3 on emulator now and it's very fun so far! I will probably buy a Playstation with all three Spyro when I have the chance!    Some questions from a Playstation noob if you you don't mind : are PS1 games compatible with the PS2 console? If they do, should I seek a specific model of PS2? Or, is there something like the Virtual Console on PS4 where I can buy the Spyro games?"
YookaLaylee,36fcjx,stormforce5,2,Tue May 19 21:44:46 2015 UTC,"Every PS2 can play every PS1 game, but if you plan to play Spyro on them, make sure you get PS1 Memory Cards instead of PS2 Memory Cards, otherwise you can't save the game. There's not a big difference between the PS2 models, but the fat PS2 is a little better, so seek one of them if you can, but don't stress if you can't find any.  The PS4 has PS Now, but that's a fairly new service so no PS1 games are being hosted yet, but it's still possible to download certain PS1 games, including all 3 Spyro games, onto a PS3, PS Vita, or PS TV. So if you don't have a PS3, getting a PS2 or PS TV is probably the way to go."

YookaLaylee,36fcjx,MoreHtsThnSadaharuOh,2,Sat May 30 09:15:37 2015 UTC,Psychonauts is my favourite game of all time. Period. I think it's the best game ever made. I wouldn't mind an essay of your experiences when you finish it.
YookaLaylee,36d15l,UnitedWeGame,4,Mon May 18 12:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you pretty well summarized the whole saga. You could maybe go a little further and add how Grant Kirkhope said on Game Grumps that he'd really like to see another Banjo-Kazooie game and that he felt there was still a demand for this sorta game even if the most popular games nowadays are shooters. The Mingy Jongo thing started up a couple months after that I believe.  I feel like ""dead"" is a strong word here. Realize that the core of this is like 7 guys. The project got off the ground when I think 2 of them decided to leave Rare. They've also mentioned that they're getting paid below industry standard in order to produce this game because they're all passionate about it. They just couldn't logistically do it until the end of last year.  I think that given how they kinda have the staff together for it and actually spent a ton of time building it, making the kickstarter and doing all these press appearances, that they're not just gonna abandon it now. They said that even if Microsoft and Rare make another Banjo or something similar they don't think that means they're gonna just quit, they all want to explore that genre."
YookaLaylee,36d15l,Kewl0210,2,Mon May 18 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"You make some good points, Kewl. I actually did see that episode awhile back and completely forgot that he talked about that.  And now that you mention it, I may have used ""dead"" too much as well. More accurate phrasing could have supported the ideas I was trying to get across. The main thought was that I want to credit them for caring enough about the project to come back to it and push even to make it a reality.  Thanks for the extra info too! I want to know everything I can find out about this project, and I didn't know that they've been working below industry standard to make this happen."
YookaLaylee,36d15l,-MD-,3,Fri May 22 01:20:27 2015 UTC,"I've been following it since the beginning with Mingy Jongo and was really bummed when the project originally got canned.   I was surprised to see the ""Ctrl Alt Del"" tweets back in December, they left us hanging for almost a month without an update and then we started getting a stream of info from then, the account changed to Playtonic, they teased Yooka & Laylee with an image and so on.   Was the project ever actually dead? Perhaps.   It was definitely dead for awhile there, they've only been together as a studio for ~5 months and Mingy Jongo was back in 2012. Sounds like they were waiting for Steve Mayles and Chris Sutherland to exit Rare to get them on board before getting started as Mingy Jongo was originally only like 3 people from the current team.   It would be easy to be pessimistic about the projects chances at this point, it did already die once after all.   Yeah there's no chance this game doesn't get made at this point, the Kickstarter was just way too successful and the Playtonic team sound very happy with their situation, they never originally planned to even use Kickstarter but now they have enough money in the bank to hire more people and create the second team they keep mentioning."
YookaLaylee,36d15l,stormforce5,1 point,Mon May 18 19:21:10 2015 UTC,It's been great seeing that Kickstarter continue to grow hasn't it? Here's hoping we can hit that last stretch goal for the dlc! Did you go for any of the Kickstarter prizes?
YookaLaylee,36d15l,-MD-,2,Fri May 22 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm still a little surprised that there is going to be a new 3D platformer out in the world. I know the 3D Mario games exist, but I haven't really enjoyed them since 64 and Sunshine, whereas I'm still playing BK, DK64, etc.  Not sure if I got my point across with this, I'm just trying to say that I'm really excited!

YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Jimbob0i0,9,Wed May 27 14:43:43 2015 UTC,It is programmed and tested on the PC (obviously). However designed to be played with an Xbox controller.   I doubt there will be any differences between versions. Not only could it endanger the day one release on all platforms but I also think it's against Playtonics design philosophy.   They want to make the game available for as many people as possible. Version exclusive features would limit the experience of some players.   Only thing I could imagine is that the Wii U version will have a little lower graphics. But even then it will look amazing on it I think.
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,selebu,10,Mon May 18 09:13:51 2015 UTC,"Any reason in particular why you believe the Wii U version will have worse graphics? Where exactly are you basing this statement?  Have you seen how good Mario Kart 8 looks? Have you see the gameplay footage or screens for the upcoming Zelda game?  The Wii U can handle a surprising load. It's no PS4 or XboxOne, or super-PC, but the Wii U is more powerful than the PS3/360. Heck, the Wii U has more games on it running at 1080p and at 60fps than the PS4 and XBOne does.  Yooka-Laylee has the same cartoony graphics most Nintendo games are famous for. I don't think the Wii U will have lower graphics at all; and if it does, its probably more due to a lack of skilled porting than a lack of power hardware-wise."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Latromi,0,Wed May 20 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where I offended you. I explicitly said ""only thing I could imagine"" and then also said that it still will look amazing anyway.   I am basing my guess on the fact that PC PS4 and Xbox1 all have higher graphical capabilities. So especially on the PC where you usually are able to adjust a bunch of settings it might look even better."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,selebu,5,Wed May 20 10:56:46 2015 UTC,I don't think u/Latromi was offended. He was asking for a valid reason as to why you think this game won't look beautiful on the WiiU. The WiiU is a fantastic console with great graphical capabilities. I imagine Yooka Laylee will look gorgeous on the WiiU.
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Ream-O,2,Wed May 20 14:09:11 2015 UTC,"Not offended at all. Simply wondering why you might imagine/believe the Wii U wouldn't be capable of playing the game as well as any other system. It's shown that its a very capable system; its also possibly easier to port to due to being out longer than the PS4/XBOne. (I have no idea how Unity Engine games do outside the PC, to be completely honest.)"
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Latromi,2,Thu May 21 07:34:37 2015 UTC,"Alright then. I don't know much about porting either but I believe Unity is especially good for creating multi platform games, hence the name."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,selebu,0,Thu May 21 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"The Wii U has less power. Its a fact. The games can look great, but there's no changing facts."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Kelsig,3,Fri May 22 02:35:36 2015 UTC,"I am not blind to that. People just talk about it like its still as crap as the Wii was. It's slightly/decently better than the PS3 and 360. Of course after 2 years and slapping a larger starting pricetag on their systems, Sony and Microsoft were able to make the PS4 and XBOne way more powerful, but people talk about the Wii U as if its still an SD console that isn't capable of playing games that look really great."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Latromi,0,Fri May 22 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"Because if the Wii U has worse graphics than the Xbone and PS4, it just means Playtonic dumbed down the Xbone and PS4 graphics.  Worse does not mean bad. It means worse. Just like PS4 and Xbone will have worse graphics than max PC settings."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Kelsig,5,Fri May 22 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"WiiU is probably getting off-tv play, which is a great addition."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,valahart,2,Wed May 20 14:23:52 2015 UTC,Actually yes. That's a valid reason to get it on Wii U. I play on game pad a lot when my girlfriend wants to watch TV!
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,selebu,4,Wed May 20 21:32:37 2015 UTC,"The PC version will likely be the most versatile with allowing you to use any type of controller that you want and offering higher resolutions than console allow for, stuff like 4k.  I don't think the game is graphically demanding so I imagine they're aiming for 60 frames @ 1080p on all platforms, WiiU could be the exception but we'll have to see closer to release. WiiU gamepad functionality might be fairly minimal since this will be on ~4 platforms at launch and the team is quite small.  I always go with the PC option when it comes to multiplatform games so that's what I chose. Plan on using my Dualshock 4 when I play."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,-MD-,6,Mon May 18 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"Wii U has more 1080p and 60fps games than the other current-gen consoles, last I looked.  I don't know why so many people believe the Wii U will suffer in the graphics department. I know the Wii wasn't very powerful, but the Wii U has a lot of people making double-takes.  Heck, my own mother thought I was watching a nature documentary and asked me what channel I was watching. . . while I was looking around through the camera in Pikmin 3. Admittedly, she just walked in the room and wasn't studying it closely. . . but at a GLANCE she believed it was an actual documentary and only asked me because she couldn't find a logo on the screen for the television network."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Latromi,2,Wed May 20 03:19:11 2015 UTC,"Because, compared to the others, it will. It is a good console yes but it can't keep up with the other platforms.  I have no doubt the game will look amazing on it, and the controller will be very well used and make it possibly the most fun console version to play, but it will be lacking in some eye candy and theres nothing wrong with that. None of the consoles this round are anywhere near graphically amazing, wiiu most of all, but they do what they do good, and as long as the devs play to their strengths(which outside of graphics wiiu has the most) and make the games fun that is what matters."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,supamesican,1 point,Wed May 20 16:29:52 2015 UTC,"I just think that the Wii U probably wont suffer any graphics downgrade.  You are absolutely right that if they play to each consoles strengths it will be a wonderful experience no matter what. However, porting games to console can be a tricky business. The PS4 and XBOne are both far newer and less understood systems development-wise. I have no idea how difficult it is to do console ports with the Unity Engine, but its pretty standard that MOST consoles suffer bad ports and have less quality graphics than what the console is truly capable of in the first 2, sometimes 3, years. This is true even in first party titles. Uncharted 1 on PS3 was nowhere near as stable graphically compared to its sequels. . . and even Mario Kart 8 could have had AA added without dropping much, if any, frames, yet they didn't add it.   The Wii U has been out longer, so whatever power it lacks in comparison to the PS4 and XBOne may be completely negligible when it comes to making ports, simply because porting to it and programming for it will be more understood through longer hands-on time, since the Wii U has been out longer and people have been programming and porting to it longer than they have been for Sony and Microsoft's systems."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Latromi,2,Thu May 21 07:51:36 2015 UTC,One of Unity's main selling points is the basically one-click porting system. Games can be compiled for all of the main consoles at the moment with only the features built into Unity.
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,official_duck,1 point,Fri May 22 12:48:42 2015 UTC,"The Wii U has been out longer, so whatever power it lacks in comparison to the PS4 and XBOne may be completely negligible when it comes to making ports   hehe no. Not with how much more powerful they are than it gpu wise. Even the xb1 has about 75% more gpu power than the gpu power of the wiiu, and even with it being out longer the consoles use the architecture the pc has been using for 35 years now so they know how to optimize for it.  Now don't get me wrong I don't expect a downgrade on the wiiu ether. I expect it to be low settings the consoles medium and the pc high/ultra when all is said and done. Especially if the game is built from the ground up for the pc, then down porting it to any console will be easy to do."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,supamesican,2,Thu May 21 13:20:14 2015 UTC,"All that just cause I said the WiiU ""could"" be the exception? Nobody said the WiiU was weak or would ""suffer"" it's just clearly the outlier of the platforms when it comes to hardware.   Again, Yooka-Laylee doesn't look like it's trying to push cutting edge graphics, it'll likely run the same on every platform.   Wii U has more 1080p and 60fps games than the other current-gen consoles, last I looked.   This is irrelevant though."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,-MD-,1 point,Wed May 20 03:38:03 2015 UTC,Eh the game doesn't look too demanding so I can imagine it getting 1080 on wiiu.
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,supamesican,2,Wed May 20 16:26:00 2015 UTC,"Ether pc or wiiu. Don't get me wrong there will be NOTHING inherently wrong with the ps4 and xb1 versions, but wiiu will have a unique controll scheme which lets face it knowing these devs like we do will probably be awesome. While the pc will be able to have higher frame rates and resolutions, and even different aspect ratios like 21:9(ultra wide like what movies use) that can give different field of views, and maybe even mods(even if unofficial). Plus any controller you want to use."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,supamesican,2,Wed May 20 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"The WiiU version, because it'll be an N64 Rare inspired game on a Nintendo console so it'll be the best one to play it on."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,YourPassportNumber,1 point,Mon May 18 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"It will probably be pretty much the same on all platforms, so I'll go for my favourite controller(PS4)."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Tencha,1 point,Wed May 20 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"I'm going with the Wii U version, but I'm really hoping they try to make it the same for every console, and from the attitude they have seemed to have with wanting to share the game with everybody they can so far, I'd assume this is their plan anyway. That being said, I'd of course be happy with some Gamepad support in some way. Nothing needed really, but maybe as a little extra in some way."
YookaLaylee,36ckmx,Joshers744,1 point,Fri May 22 17:45:18 2015 UTC,"I'm intending to get it on Wii U, though not for GamePad support.  I'll probably use a Pro controller.  I actually quite like those, and it'll just be nice to play this on a Nintendo console."

YookaLaylee,36blc4,N64Gamer,2,Mon May 18 01:37:38 2015 UTC,I think I remember one Dev saying in an interview that it was his goal get the game physical (I'm assuming for every platform). I might be imagining things though.  Still I don't see it as a reason to not get the game.
YookaLaylee,36blc4,stormforce5,2,Mon May 18 02:14:21 2015 UTC,"I will eventually get the game, even as a digital copy.  However, my problem is that in case they released physical console copies in the future, then I'd feel like I had wasted my money on a digital copy."
YookaLaylee,36blc4,DroidT,1 point,Mon May 18 02:29:07 2015 UTC,Think of it as extra support for Playtonic games! These guys are heroes!

YookaLaylee,36blc4,patty20,1 point,Thu May 21 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"IF they put out a physical version for the console yes, but you'd also get to play it at least a year sooner probably and you may not like it that much and decide not to get the $60 physical version."
YookaLaylee,36blc4,Latromi,2,Thu May 21 19:00:21 2015 UTC,"Still I don't see it as a reason to not get the game.   I don't know about WiiU, but both the Xbone and PS4 install the entire disc to the hard drive. If the digital and physical copies are both the same size, you can save time getting the disc and installing from that instead of downloading off the (potentially slow) internet. I've heard people buy physical-only for this reason"
YookaLaylee,36blc4,afevis,3,Mon May 18 02:38:26 2015 UTC,"I get physical because that way, you actually ""own"" the game.  You can lend the game to a friend or play it on other consoles. With a digital copy, you're limited to only having the game on your console.  also, digital copies could potentially disappear - either by faulty equipment or against your will due to some bullshit terms and conditions"
YookaLaylee,36blc4,patty20,0,Tue May 19 12:05:32 2015 UTC,Also people who have low data caps.  I know people with data caps as low as 120gigs per month. If you have multiple people living in the house and any of them watch HD netflix. . . you start getting creative in ways to conserve every gig you can so you don't get charged for going over your limit.

YookaLaylee,368x26,grotscif,1 point,Sun May 17 10:04:49 2015 UTC,Laylee makes sounds. You can hear it whenever she flies in the gameplay videos.
YookaLaylee,368x26,stormforce5,2,Sun May 17 23:31:36 2015 UTC,Oh woosh... :(
YookaLaylee,368x26,stormforce5,1 point,Sun May 17 23:31:58 2015 UTC,"As cool as echolocating stuff sounds it would probably end up like the Metal Detector in Ratchet and Clank, so I don't think it should happen. Going invisible should definitely be in the game though."

When I summon skeletons on some random video-game, nothing happens to the bones I'm holding for my  dog.  Isn't the game just going to tell you ''hey, this is an ultra-sound'' and visually represent it?  Is it me who am misinformed about the game mechanics?"

YookaLaylee,368x26,ReiBob,-8,Mon May 18 18:10:05 2015 UTC,Laylee could use ultrasound to make dark rooms or hidden objects visible.   I don't think how bats work.
YookaLaylee,368x26,MuffinAlibaba,3,Sun May 17 16:06:11 2015 UTC,i thought yooka-laylee was a video game though?

YookaLaylee,367405,babyaap,2,Sun May 17 08:38:51 2015 UTC,I think they just refer to the levels boss as the final boss of that level.

YookaLaylee,367rbh,xiriusnoodles,2,Sun May 17 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, looks like I was right about the whole storybook theme and the Pagies. GamesRadar article Perhaps the villain ripped pages out of the story, and the Pagies you collect are these lost pages. It's also possible that the villain and/or Yoola and Laylee could be adding their own writing to these Pagies, thereby influencing the worlds in the game."
YookaLaylee,3660hw,T-Rex_Is_best,6,Sat May 16 14:09:29 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks this is one of the better interviews as of late? Lots of questions answered and the length is very nice.
YookaLaylee,3660hw,Arcaenist,4,Sat May 16 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"I actually came here to say this too. Absolutely a great interview, and some really awesome questions too... not the standard uninspired questions most people ask.  For example, I really wanted to know what was up with that Mingy Jongo Twitter account from a few years back and they actually asked about it. Mind you Playtonic didn't have much of an answer except it was just an idea at the time... but it was still awesome to have that brought up.  Another great question was on the subject of who they'd like to expand the team with. Most interviewers have just asked them if they're concerned about getting too big, but not here... they asked if they were going to hire industry-experienced developers or try to source some fresh blood. To me that's a more interesting question.  These guys know how to do a good interview :)"
YookaLaylee,3660hw,jdmoser,5,Sat May 16 20:41:38 2015 UTC,"For anyone wondering, be sure to subscribe to GameXplain if you like this style of interview. It's basically all they do, they tend to focus on all games from Nintendo as well as other games they find an interest in (this time being Yooka-Laylee) they've made a few other videos about Yooka-Laylee"

YookaLaylee,364qli,shyPiano,2,Sat May 16 12:50:16 2015 UTC,"That's good, they just seem so bland"
YookaLaylee,364qli,DudeitsLandon,1 point,Sat May 16 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like darker shadows (especially on the characters) will help this pop out more.  Otherwise, I like it!"
YookaLaylee,362g6m,GrayMagicGamma,9,Fri May 15 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"What I found interesting is that they are removing the different collectibles for special skills, like the red feathers and blue eggs, and instead have one single collectible for all special moves.   I think it's a smart move, it will reduce the feeling of useless collectibles."
YookaLaylee,362g6m,Red-Blue-,4,Fri May 15 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it'll also fix the issue Mr. Patch and some other bosses had where the consimables in the arena spell out how to damage the boss."
YookaLaylee,362g6m,AtrumDelorox,2,Fri May 15 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"For a collect-athon, I never really felt like BK or BT ever had too many that some felt useless. But I see your points. Hopefully the game's not too hard without the obvious ""use this to kill boss"" items"
YookaLaylee,362nka,TheFrodo,2,Fri May 15 16:10:14 2015 UTC,Right Trigger does the roll. Neat! I wonder if you'll do moves OUT of the roll. That'd be pretty cool!
YookaLaylee,362nka,TheMasterDS,1 point,Fri May 15 19:42:56 2015 UTC,"The more I read about this project, the more excited I become.  Like presumably many of us here I grew up on BK and BT and am more than excited to experience this new experience as an adult!"
YookaLaylee,362kgg,JorWat,2,Fri May 15 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I didn't know you posted my video on here lol. Thanks man! :-)"
YookaLaylee,361rp5,justjacksullivan,9,Fri May 15 11:10:54 2015 UTC,"I'd like the game to be hard, but not unforgiving. I think that making people lose all their stuff is a very cheap way to crank up difficulty. Loosing your collectibles upon death is just a very ""old"" way of doing things. Notes were never hard to obtain on their own to begin with, it was just that you could die with 98 of them because 2 were kinda hard to get (over a bottomless pit etc) and you had to collect all the other 98 again, just because you fucked up. I think collecting them like in BT (but harder to obtain) would be the way to go."
YookaLaylee,361rp5,PandaDerZwote,6,Fri May 15 11:31:13 2015 UTC,"BT annoyed me that they grouped all the notes in 5s and 20s. I miss the clever placement of all 100 individual notes from BK, which really made you turn the levels upside-down to find them."
YookaLaylee,361rp5,Hedrigall,4,Sat May 16 10:23:03 2015 UTC,"I swung between the two while playing through BK360. It annoyed me for the first chunk of levels but between Click Clock Wood, Rusty Bucket Bay and one cluster in Gobi's Valley, I was pretty thankful for the lack of resetting.  Really, the win-win scenario for this would be having it be an option when you start the file."
YookaLaylee,361rp5,HeyThatsMyLeg,4,Fri May 15 12:53:24 2015 UTC,Toggle-able when making the save file would be awesome.
YookaLaylee,361rp5,afevis,1 point,Fri May 15 13:20:08 2015 UTC,Old style for hard mode and a more forgiving option for an easy mode seems like a good compromise.
YookaLaylee,361rp5,pokll,3,Sat May 16 11:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think of it as a variable issue — the difficulty of the challenge should correlate to the grandness of the reward.  I'm fine with the system used in Banjo-Kazooie, but the reward for collecting all the notes should be well worth the effort if so.  But I suspect they'll go with the Tooie system, since ""worlds"" will apparently unlock piece by piece, meaning all the notes within a world won't even necessarily be accessible when you first arrive."
YookaLaylee,361rp5,infinitelives,3,Fri May 15 13:02:24 2015 UTC,NO! Just... no.
YookaLaylee,361rp5,Darth_Dio,2,Fri May 15 13:17:02 2015 UTC,I hated that more when I wanted to stop playing mid world or my mum said i had to get off. There was no way of me saving my note count and continuing where i left off. Dying and losing note count seemed fair.
YookaLaylee,361rp5,Slurmeee,2,Fri May 15 13:38:09 2015 UTC,"When I first played BK as a kid I absolutely hated the resetting, because it was my first play-trough and all, but now when I'm older and know the game like the back of my hand I quite like the resetting. It brings a sense of danger into a game that otherwise would be an absolute cake-walk. Do I want resetting in Yooka-Laylee however? Probably not, but some sort of incentive to stay alive would be welcomed."
YookaLaylee,361rp5,Ketsu,2,Fri May 15 14:30:39 2015 UTC,"Two modes, one where its forgiving, one where it isn't"
YookaLaylee,361rp5,xWaffleicious,1 point,Fri May 15 16:00:17 2015 UTC,That won't be viable.
YookaLaylee,361rp5,TheMasterDS,1 point,Fri May 15 13:21:39 2015 UTC,"Please no, if the game wants to be difficult then make the collecting of everything harder, but making you go through a WHOLE ENTIRE MAP ALL OVER AGAIN just because you died seems stupid. Maybe it worked back then, but I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't want that."
YookaLaylee,361rp5,AnonymousXD2,1 point,Fri May 15 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"Seeing as every Rare Collectathon since Banjo-Kazzoie don't reset like that, I'm guessing they have learned their lesson. :P  Even the re-release of Banjo-Kazzoie for XBox Live Arcade didn't reset your notes if you died! So I'm pretty certain this will be the case for Yooka-Laylee"
YookaLaylee,361rp5,shyPiano,1 point,Fri May 15 23:55:15 2015 UTC,"The notes syetem in banjo kazooie was good in the sense that as you say, it did give an incentive not to die. However, that system DOES become problematic when you're playing say, rusty bucket bay where instant death is a cost of some mistakes. I also like the idea of being able to get a 'high score', and something that rewards you for traversing the entirety of the landscape without failure. The notes system rewards your ""skill"" as opposed to the jiggies system rewarding your exploration and puzzle solving.  Perhaps the notes system could be used sparingly - for specific challenge areas only for example?  The tooie way of doing the notes I felt kinda ruined the spirit of having them really. The ONLY time I could feasibly envisage notes limiting your progress would be stopping you from learning'hatch' when you first find it in mayhem temple. Other than that, you had to find few note nests to have enough for a new move, and they typically were in very easy to find places.  If they have something akin to notes, it works better with the kazooie mechanic."
YookaLaylee,361rp5,usernumber36,1 point,Sat May 16 10:49:52 2015 UTC,Didnt they change this for the Bk and Bt Xbox live arcade releases? Im almost positive they did.
YookaLaylee,361rp5,Miadkins,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"They did, but if they're trying to create an ""authentic Banjo Kazooie experience"", i'm a bit concerned they might bring back this mechanic."
YookaLaylee,361rp5,Hurricane12112,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:09:11 2015 UTC,I'm with you.   I liked the old wayyyy
YookaLaylee,360nq6,fashiznit,3,Fri May 15 02:30:59 2015 UTC,Nice list! Is that supposed to be DK64 listed for Grant Kirkhope? Although a game called DJ64 using Grant Kirkhope's music would be pretty sweet.
YookaLaylee,360nq6,RedditUser145,2,Fri May 15 04:49:11 2015 UTC,"HAHA! Yeah meant to be DK, that was an awesome typo though, Freudian slip perhaps. Thanks"
YookaLaylee,360nq6,loofawah,2,Fri May 15 05:21:27 2015 UTC,Honesty question: Who was the creative mastermind behind BK and where does that person work now?
YookaLaylee,360nq6,loofawah,1 point,Fri May 15 06:38:50 2015 UTC,"Woah really. The brother thing is too cool/weird. I bet Gregg knew all about Yooka-Laylee and I'm sure they talked it over. I'm a little afraid that Yooka-Laylee will be stepping on the feet of BK3, but the family ties make that less likely. I just wish BK3 would come out on PC."
YookaLaylee,360nq6,Heatinmyharbl,1 point,Fri May 15 12:42:28 2015 UTC,Is Banjo Threeie ever even happening?  You just got my hopes up...

YookaLaylee,360nq6,Heatinmyharbl,1 point,Sat May 16 06:22:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is what I figured. I have an xbox one anyway, was swindled by Microsoft like so many others to buy one for the joke that was MCC.  If Threeie actually comes out, my xbox one will actually be more than a 400$ Halo 5 machine."

YookaLaylee,360nq6,jdmoser,1 point,Sat May 16 07:39:32 2015 UTC,Gavin was a playtester on DK64 and Banjo-Tooie.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,valahart,24,Thu May 14 13:51:15 2015 UTC,I personally prefer being able to complete a stage on my first visit. That was actually one of the things that sorta took me out of Tooie. It was hard to keep track of which parts of an area I had yet to complete and which parts couldn't be done until later.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,JordanRynes,2,Thu May 14 15:11:16 2015 UTC,"This won't be the case with Yooka-Laylee's expanded levels, sounds like we'll be revisiting each world at least once after we have already left it with abilities earned later in the game."
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,-MD-,11,Thu May 14 19:11:03 2015 UTC,"I prefer Tooie, when I was a kid I always replayed the levels anyway and finding stuff that was interconnected got me so excited!"
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,otwem,10,Thu May 14 16:28:22 2015 UTC,Easily BT-like.  I really thought BK was an awesome game and  found levels like Click-Clock Woods really unique and interesting.  But BT  absolutely blew it away in every way.  I absolutely loved the way that the levels interacted with each other and had so much fun going back into the levels and being able to get to things that weren't accessible on previous visits.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,akadros,8,Thu May 14 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"BT, since its more like the metroid formula which i love"
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,deepkong,7,Thu May 14 16:14:23 2015 UTC,They've more or less confirmed the compromise between the two. The worlds will start off Kazooie sized and you can spend your Pagies to expand the worlds. The expanded worlds will require later moves. They'll likely end up Tooie sized. Real nice compromise that.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,TheMasterDS,5,Thu May 14 17:35:10 2015 UTC,"Yep! I know that and it sounds incredible :)   But what I'm really wondering is if there are going to be any puzzles that require actually doing something in another level to solve. You know? Not just requiring later game abilities. Also, the levels actually being interconnected, like in BT when you could literally go from one to another without using the HubWorld.  Examples in Tooie would be cleaning Jolly Roger's Lagoon water, getting inside Grunty's Industries, cooling the water in Hailfire Peaks... etc."
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,TheMasterDS,2,Thu May 14 17:38:27 2015 UTC,That's a great way to build a connected world! I hope they do go for that.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,shyPiano,5,Thu May 14 17:40:02 2015 UTC,"I feel that Banjo-Tooie's way to interconnect their levels is both brilliant and very unique. I have not seen the idea be developed for any other game in the way it was for Banjo-Tooie, which is rather disappointing, since I never played Banjo-Tooie and never got to experience such. So I really hope they make the levels like Banjo-Tooie's - maybe leave the interconnected parts to the extensions?  Not only that, but coming back to a world after learning new moves and such is something I really enjoy. In a way, I feel more free if they do this rather than allowing me to 100% each level the very first time I enter it - as it serves as a confirmation that, yes, I am allowed to go explore other worlds and actually do things the order I want to. Otherwise, I feel like I must complete every world always before moving on to the next one... A bit ironic, I guess, but that's how I roll!"
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,concretecactus,4,Fri May 15 00:17:39 2015 UTC,BK. I prefer quality over quantity.  Whilst I did enjoy the interconnected levels of BT the size of levels started getting ridiculous which in turn made them feel empty.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,AnonymousXD2,4,Thu May 14 21:02:35 2015 UTC,I prefer quality over quantity.   They aren't mutually exclusive you know.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,Cuddles_theBear,1 point,Fri May 15 04:46:42 2015 UTC,"Both of the games have this weird sense that the levels are empty, in my opinion. I didn't notice it with BK until the last time I played it, which was a few weeks ago. The issue is that everything in the level is a puzzle with the same reward, a jiggy. If you aren't thinking about it or you don't know the game well, you won't see it, but if you know where everything is, I think it really stands out that the only things in the level are tasks to complete. Compare this to, say, Super Mario 64, where traversing the levels poses a challenge even when you're not doing the 3 specific steps to get the star, or whatever.  That being said, BK does a good job (most of the time) of cutting out all the extra space between set pieces, so it feels way less empty than BT. Some BK levels don't even feel like they have this problem (Gobi's Valley, Mad Monster Mansion, and Rusty Bucket Bay are the best about this). I'm playing BT now and holy crap, there is nothing in most of these levels. The giant empty space in the middle of Dinoland stands out the most. I didn't notice it as a kid, but as an adult it bothers me."
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,JiggyJinjo,6,Fri May 15 04:52:09 2015 UTC,"I prefer Banjo Tooie design either, I began with BK when I was 8 but didn't finish it and then I got Tooie finished it and then took BK and finished it. I prefer Tooie because of the level design but I liked how important the collectibles were in BK with the notes and skulls."
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,HammerSpam,2,Thu May 14 13:57:44 2015 UTC,Tooie (I actually like the interconnected backtracking)
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,TLoFF,2,Thu May 14 21:10:36 2015 UTC,I prefer Tooie. Love a big world to explore and find secrets in.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,AnonymousXD2,2,Thu May 14 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Banjo Tooie's interconnected world style. I love being able to explore new areas in old levels because it makes them way more memorable and also encourages exploring the level to find any hidden places where you could use new abilites. Coupled with world expansions we might be looking at some of the most complex levels in 3D-platformer collectathon history, which would be pretty nice.  On a similar note, I think it would be amazing to be able to see other worlds from one world (after they are expanded ofc, no spoilers 4 us), it is one of the things that made Super Mario Sunshine my favorite GC game during my childhood and it would make the world feel more immersive."
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,HyperDan2000,4,Fri May 15 04:44:56 2015 UTC,People will hate me for this but I really like nut and bolts.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,GuatemalanWatermelon,15,Thu May 14 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"Nuts and bolts was a fine game on its own. Most people dislike it because they wanted another iteration of the previous games, but instead they got cars."
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,HyperDan2000,5,Thu May 14 15:13:24 2015 UTC,Do you mean the game or the level design?  I couldn't get past the heavy change from the original genre so I played only the first 20 minutes of it. I don't really know how the level design works there....
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,CoolGuySean,5,Thu May 14 14:40:46 2015 UTC,Level design and the hub world in general
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,awesomepawsome,4,Thu May 14 15:43:35 2015 UTC,"The art style, graphics, and level design (well the way they looked anyway) were amazing."
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,payco,4,Thu May 14 15:52:59 2015 UTC,I did enjoy the hub world a lot actually but I just couldn't get behind most of the actual levels.  They all felt to me like tiny museums in  an air hangar where they just had very few places of interest and too much empty space.  I guess that is what you get with the car mechanics because the world is more of a track than a place to get out and interact with.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,Ketsu,2,Fri May 15 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"I really did too. Part of me would like to make the change in a level more dynamic than just entering a different door, but that also makes it harder to go back and do things that needed to happen before a given trigger--or every iteration of a level has to be backwards compatible with earlier collectibles & challenges, which seems bad.  Maybe instead of an omnipresent set of doors, there can be a time machine (hidden in a different spot in each level, of course, and powered with banana fairies) that can take you back to earlier versions of a level to clean up stuff you missed. Essentially, you hide the door selection until a person decides they want it."
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,Ketsu,1 point,Thu May 14 16:52:01 2015 UTC,Levels like the ones in BT without the back-tracking and need for moves found in upcoming worlds :) Always been that type of gamer who enjoys being able to 100% an area before moving onto the next.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,darthfodder,1 point,Thu May 14 17:03:44 2015 UTC,What do you mean by levels like BT then? Larger levels?
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,supamesican,1 point,Thu May 14 17:11:20 2015 UTC,"Yus! While I love every single level in BK, the larger and more complex levels in BT were, for me, ultimately more fun to play (apart from the back tracking)"

YookaLaylee,35y1vd,Hurricane12112,1 point,Fri May 15 13:13:28 2015 UTC,Everyone is saying they loved BT more. Now I'm so sad I never got to play it. :/ I was pretty young when these games came out. My parents played BK with me so I got through it and loved it. Then they got divorced and I couldn't ever get through BT by myself. I was horrible at games.
YookaLaylee,35y1vd,jaytazcross,2,Fri May 15 13:32:03 2015 UTC,"Well, you can still find a way to play it! They can be bought at XboxLA!"

YookaLaylee,35y1vd,Nickthegreat,1 point,Fri May 15 13:43:26 2015 UTC,I personally prefer the BK design. Simple and satisfying without all the unneeded bells and whistles to distract and make the game longer. I got fed up with BT and never actually completed it tbh...

Do you remember the bucket in Treasure Trove Cove that said something like, ""Rusty has hole in bucket! Needs pebble to block hole!"" (I'm paraphrasing here). I searched ALL OVER for that god damn pebble and never figured it out. Later I realized you just needed to use Kazooie's eggs to fill the bucket..."

YookaLaylee,35x5iu,Chait-hei,3,Thu May 14 09:25:38 2015 UTC,It is. It's something like Mario Party only with using numbered cards instead of dice and it's just all Sonic characters.

YookaLaylee,35x5iu,GrayMagicGamma,3,Thu May 14 23:49:07 2015 UTC,I'd go for a good party game. Mario Party has become too separated from its roots now.

YookaLaylee,35x5iu,KillMeAndYouDie,2,Thu May 14 15:18:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, it doesn't seem that far fetched of an idea to me. Just like Banjo-Kazzoie and Banjo-Tooie, there were others Rareware games that are quite unlike anything we have seen since. In particular, Diddy Kong Racing! Many have commented that there is no other Kart Racer quite like Diddy Kong Racing... Making a ""Rarevival"" of such a game would likely be met with great reception as well, and tap into a demand that has not quite been met.  Not only that, just like how Diddy Kong Racing introduced us to Banjo and Conker, I can see Playtonic use a racing game to introduce us to a bunch of characters they plan on using in other titles. Just add some Yooka-Laylee in the kart racer to ride off the popularity the game will hopefully gather by then, and they would be in the right tracks to fill us with endearing, memorable characters once again! :)"

YookaLaylee,35u0d5,cedriceent,20,Wed May 13 14:30:56 2015 UTC,Needs the eyes.
YookaLaylee,35u0d5,LGarrad,9,Wed May 13 14:52:07 2015 UTC,Rare is only involved to the extent that developers in Playtonic are ex-Rare employees... I wouldn't give a penny to Rare after they bungled Nuts and Bolts so badly.
YookaLaylee,35u0d5,GivePopPopYourHair,14,Wed May 13 17:00:21 2015 UTC,I'm sure it was more Microsoft's decision than Rare's. I assume when you have a parent company you don't really have much creative freedom anymore.
YookaLaylee,35u0d5,DrBob3002,10,Wed May 13 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"According to Gavin Price, Microsoft were supportive of Rare, pretty sure it was Gregg Mayles that decided cars were the best thing for Banjo. Gavin could just be trying to play nice though but he has repeated this stance a couple times lately.  On the flip side after being let go Chris Seavor used to fling shit at Microsoft constantly and claimed they cancelled a few of his projects, some of which were promising. He eased up when Don Mattrick left Microsoft and was replaced by Phil Spencer, maybe Don was the asshole that led to the cancellations (I'd believe it, he did champion the Kinect).  In any case I think it's a mix of Rare being too big for it's own good and Microsoft being a mediocre publisher."
YookaLaylee,35u0d5,-MD-,3,Wed May 13 19:34:51 2015 UTC,Very well said.
YookaLaylee,35u0d5,mattjaydunn,2,Wed May 13 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"He eased up when Don Mattrick left Microsoft and was replaced by Phil Spencer, maybe Don was the asshole that led to the cancellations    I'm starting to realize how negatively Don Mattrick effected both Xbox and Rare. I have no doubt he shoulders some blame. He was responsible for the development of Kinect, which I think mostly explains it being shoved down Rare's throat, and forced on gamers with the Xbox One.  In 2012 he was named a tech visionary. Botches the Xbox One launch the next year. Some visionary."

YookaLaylee,35rp52,be_A_shame,12,Tue May 12 23:18:35 2015 UTC,I'm curious to know how much Banjo-Kazooie cost to make back in the day...
YookaLaylee,35rp52,PlayerTP,19,Tue May 12 23:36:00 2015 UTC,About 250 jiggies
YookaLaylee,35rp52,Kitsyfluff,5,Wed May 13 03:32:42 2015 UTC,"assuming a jiggy is solid gold, i approximate it costed £620,879"
YookaLaylee,35rp52,TheGodsSeemTall,2,Thu May 14 10:29:19 2015 UTC,You should write a What If style article on how you arrived at that figure.
YookaLaylee,35rp52,Kitsyfluff,2,Sat May 16 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I'm not that scientific.

YookaLaylee,35rp52,TheMasterDS,10,Sat May 16 19:59:21 2015 UTC,B-K was a AAA game in 1998. And one of the best looking ones around too. Very ambitious.  Games cost a lot. I think Tim Schafer said Psychonauts costed 13 million to make. I would expect B-K also costed several million.
YookaLaylee,35rp52,friendlysoviet,11,Wed May 13 03:37:49 2015 UTC,Comparing anything to Tim Schafer's budgeting skills is a bad idea.
YookaLaylee,35rp52,TheMasterDS,0,Wed May 13 14:40:55 2015 UTC,People and time cost money. Moreso when said people live in San Francisco and said time is spent in San Francisco.

YookaLaylee,35rp52,friendlysoviet,10,Wed May 13 05:41:38 2015 UTC,It will take significantly less work than building your own engine from scratch. Which is the point.
YookaLaylee,35rp52,DMthePerson,2,Wed May 13 14:39:45 2015 UTC,I'm surprised it's being made in Unity. It looks so nice I thought for sure it was being made in Unreal.
YookaLaylee,35rp52,Scorxcho,4,Wed May 13 02:28:46 2015 UTC,Implementation takes quite a while too. They just don't have to create an engine.
YookaLaylee,35rp52,bb010g,3,Wed May 13 04:14:29 2015 UTC,"Unity 4 is nice. They really picked it up graphics-wise. (IMHO Unreal is better overall, though. Blueprints & open source FTW!)"
YookaLaylee,35rp52,idkartist3D,2,Sat May 16 01:40:36 2015 UTC,"I would think they're using Unity 5 now, which looks way better than 4. And although Unreal obviously looks better, it's also way harder to learn/use. I've used both engines, and coding for Unreal even with blueprints is really difficult and complicated to get into (hell, I still don't even get it). Way more so than just adding a simple JavaScript to an object. Plus Unreal is way more nit-picky, like no overlapping UVs, and having to include collision mesh for everything... Maybe it's because I went from Unity to Unreal, but Unreal is not very easy to learn or use at all."
YookaLaylee,35rp52,jdmoser,1 point,Mon May 18 09:26:15 2015 UTC,"I dunno... they didn't exactly program the Banjo-Kazooie engine from scratch either, though, as Nintendo gave them the Super Mario 64 code."
YookaLaylee,35rp52,concretecactus,3,Thu May 14 01:57:22 2015 UTC,Ive never heard of ninty giving sm64 code to the banjo team. As far as im aware project dream was a 2d platformer in the same vain as dkc. But the the banjo team saw the work done by the conker team and were gob smacked. The banjo team was competitive and wanted to outdo the conker team thus they changed from the 2d acm style to a fully 3d engine.  Anyhow unity is far more project ready then building an engine from scratch for the 64. The 64 had limited ram and a barely documented development suite coupled with the notoriously buggy sgi workstations the original team delt with.
YookaLaylee,35rp52,jdmoser,3,Thu May 14 11:35:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm. You may be right. I'd always heard they got the Mario engine, but I can't find any concrete information on that aside from hearsay on Google :P  And then I came across this interview where an ex-Rare staffer said they never got any code.  I'll be damned :)"

YookaLaylee,35rp52,joebillybob,4,Wed May 13 07:55:33 2015 UTC,"Not a whole lot. It's just often considered to be one of the easier, more flexible engines available."
YookaLaylee,35rp52,RGibonnus,3,Wed May 13 08:50:14 2015 UTC,"Unity has huge multiplateform support. Which means that Playtonic will be able to port the game to PC, WiiU, PS4 and Xbone easily, without having to invest lots of time to make the game work on all platforms."
YookaLaylee,35rp52,friendlysoviet,3,Wed May 13 09:21:40 2015 UTC,"The emphasis was that engines like Unity, Unreal, and Source didn't exist back in 96. They would have had to built the engine from the ground up. Unity makes it so they don't have to reinvent the wheel."
YookaLaylee,35rp52,jdmoser,1 point,Wed May 13 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"Here's the answer I think you're looking for.  Unity allows a developer to make something that can stand on its own. If you want to make something with Source, chances are you have to load up, say, Half-Life 2 first.  If Playtonic wanted to use the Source engine, they would have to license it from Valve in order for Yooka-Laylee to run on its own without having to load a different Source game first.  Obviously that costs money. Unity has both a free version and a paid, but the paid is still considerably cheaper than what licensing Source would cost."
YookaLaylee,35rp52,jdmoser,1 point,Thu May 14 02:00:55 2015 UTC,"Care to elaborate, then?  From Valve's own mouth, the cost for licensing Havok alone is $25,000 if you want to sell your Source engine game.  Unity is faaaaaaaaar more affordable."

And now they announce DLC which by itself already gives negative feedback(Why not just use that effort and money for a sequel?) but on top of that it's free for everyone who pre-orders it by kickstarter, just f'in fantastic, so everyone who doesn't want to spend money on something they don't even know whether they'll enjoy it or don't have the money to spend on it right now will have to cash in some more for the extra content, this action is no better than steam pre-order bonuses."
YookaLaylee,35nit6,hounvs,-8,Tue May 12 13:44:12 2015 UTC,Do you even know what steam is?
YookaLaylee,35nit6,mouseywithpower,-5,Tue May 12 14:56:47 2015 UTC,"Well then, you've just made your own comment completely pointless."
YookaLaylee,35nit6,hounvs,3,Tue May 12 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents: I have a small worry that with so many kick starter backers they won't make as much in regular sales to turn an amazing, sequel-generating profit. I don't blame the kick starter contributers, of course, but I myself have decided to support them by buying it when it is convenient for me financially after release. This DLC ( which is not going to be worked on before release, so it's good in my book.) Is just another way I can support them later on, which is exactly what I wanted. Based on the game price, I can't imagine it'll be EXPENSIVE either. I totally see how this move could be worrisome, but nothing else indicates that I should be worried. From my perspective at least."
YookaLaylee,35nit6,mouseywithpower,4,Tue May 12 15:37:30 2015 UTC,"look at what you're actually saying.  steam's drm is all they've announced, which is whatever, but if you're a backer it's taken care of. just download the game and put it in offline mode forever if it matters that much. it's not fucking securom.  the DLC prevents yooka-laylee from being a moneygrab sequel after sequel after year after year like shooters that do this and become tired as fuck. they've said already that it's not even going to be worked on until after the game is finished and shipped. what's the problem with making a complete game and then adding more to it? they're clearly going to finish the game as intended. giving it ""free"" to the people who helped fund it makes sense also. what, you're going to take these people's money and then make them pay for DLC that only exists because of their money? that would be shitty.   your entire post is just bitching because you don't like steam (get over it, get it on a console if it matters that much) and you have some weird vendetta against actually good DLC practices. grow up. this isn't 3 maps for 30 dollars that were locked away during the first week, it's post release content. bandwagon bitching holds back actual discourse."
YookaLaylee,35o8e8,AKCornelius,1 point,Tue May 12 03:57:16 2015 UTC,I'm glad these guys are sticking to their artistic vision. I love Laylee's big ol' schnoz! Great interview.
YookaLaylee,35n0hj,Nathonator,10,Mon May 11 21:02:26 2015 UTC,"Huh, what a weird coincidence! That is the sort of subtle easter egg I want in this game."
YookaLaylee,35n0hj,danielleewilson,11,Mon May 11 21:20:29 2015 UTC,I'd actually prefer if they used an entirely different character who only came in on coop and had conversation and interacted as well.  I know Yooka was originally intended (in concept) to be something like a tiger.  It'd be neat if the initial scrapped duo came in as an additional multiplayer duo
YookaLaylee,35n0hj,Hareware,3,Mon May 11 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"My wife and I were just playing the multiplayer on Banjo-Tooie the other night, and I forgot how fun it can be. That being said, I didn't even make the connection that the second player Banjo and Kazooie happen to be the same colors as Yooka and Laylee. I know that was just a coincidence, but that's pretty cool! Like you said, I hope the do the same in Yooka Laylee."
YookaLaylee,35n0hj,Joshers744,1 point,Tue May 12 11:14:53 2015 UTC,Well there are brown chameleons and red bats!
YookaLaylee,35m0re,shawntails,2,Mon May 11 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"Nice! It's this sort of stuff I want from the extra money - a stronger core game, as opposed to extras."
YookaLaylee,35m0re,danielleewilson,1 point,Mon May 11 17:02:31 2015 UTC,"It's pretty likely to meet the 1.5 million pound goal tomorrow or the day after. And there's 36 days left. So they'll probably at least consider this sort of thing as they rack up 10K pounds a day. Plus there'll probably be another surge at the very end.   They said they weren't going to go for ""goodies"" as kickstarter goals. But they also said they didn't want to make the release date much later, so more worlds would probably mean they need money to hire more devs."
YookaLaylee,35ome3,BaconShazam,2,Tue May 12 06:25:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds awesome! I'm so hyped for this I want all the info possible lol.  I'm also super interested in that exclusive footage, and your experience voicing characters!"
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,markzone110,11,Mon May 11 03:29:20 2015 UTC,Level editing could be really cool
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,WaveParadigm,6,Mon May 11 06:01:26 2015 UTC,"I'd really love to see online co-op be implemented. I have friends across the globe that I'd love to play this with, but its only local for now."
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,KingKiio,3,Mon May 11 05:53:59 2015 UTC,While that would be totally cool I think it would take too much development time. In my experience only half of the games that do online coop doesn't bug at times.
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,Essenji,2,Mon May 11 07:32:07 2015 UTC,Yeah for online co-op to be done well it seems like a bit of a money sink when they could do so much more with it. Plus sometimes online play like that can really change the feel of the game which they might not want to go for.
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,TimmyAndStuff,2,Mon May 11 14:08:35 2015 UTC,They could go the shovel knight route and release the stretch goals long after the core game.
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,googolplexbyte,6,Mon May 11 18:30:53 2015 UTC,Extra content after beating the game?
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,WildWouterO,5,Mon May 11 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a spending report stretch goal, so there's a more immediate accountability for poor spending.  There's always a risk with a well funded project of overspending."
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,googolplexbyte,3,Mon May 11 17:31:26 2015 UTC,*cough Broken Age *cough
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,thegamer12341,2,Tue May 12 00:51:10 2015 UTC,"N64 Soundtrack Mode to go with the N64 Visual Mode. Or not if you prefer just one or the other.  That'd make sense, plus it'd answer the people who are up in arms about orchestral stuff."
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,TheMasterDS,1 point,Mon May 11 22:25:37 2015 UTC,I actually would love this. Great idea!
YookaLaylee,35k4z3,danielleewilson,1 point,Mon May 11 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly I find it really hard to say, mainly because we haven't got that much information about the game at this stage making it hard to know what isn't already in the game.   The documentary idea certainly is interesting. Or maybe something like the Insomniac museums in the Ratchet and Clank games, where you get to explore cut content and the decision making processess of the team in the actual game itself."

YookaLaylee,35iah5,angrysprinkles,15,Sun May 10 17:24:46 2015 UTC,That's very cool that the mods placed the other entries at the bottom of the page.
YookaLaylee,35iah5,hitalec,9,Sun May 10 17:29:12 2015 UTC,It just seemed like the right thing to do. It was very hard to pick which one was the best since there were several entries of such high quality. Had to make their work worth it somehow.
YookaLaylee,35iah5,me_is_kiki,10,Sun May 10 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much! I'm really glad you guys like it! :D"
YookaLaylee,35iah5,danielleewilson,2,Sun May 10 18:54:51 2015 UTC,And thanks to you again for your submission!
YookaLaylee,35iah5,JamesChapperss,2,Sun May 10 20:19:04 2015 UTC,Yeah seriously great work! Are you planning to keep the fan art coming?  Congratualtions!
YookaLaylee,35iah5,TKDbeast,4,Mon May 11 14:23:51 2015 UTC,"Nice one, congrats /u/me_is_kiki and thanks to the mods :)"
YookaLaylee,35iah5,TKDbeast,3,Sun May 10 20:37:19 2015 UTC,What an excellent compromise! Will we be able to submit more snoos?
YookaLaylee,35iah5,markzone110,3,Sun May 10 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"That would be something that would have to be discussed with the mods. As of now though, no. I think it is fair that the people who entered the contest on time get some time in the limelight first."
YookaLaylee,35iah5,Xhogar,2,Sun May 10 18:10:42 2015 UTC,"I understand. I was just wondering. Heck, I don't even have a Yooka Laylee snoo."
YookaLaylee,35iah5,KFC_Lovar,3,Sun May 10 18:28:52 2015 UTC,Awesome! Very nice of the mods to make it so everyone wins in some capacity! Very much in the spirit of Yooka-Laylee!
YookaLaylee,35iah5,DMthePerson,2,Mon May 11 03:09:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome, looks very good! :)"
YookaLaylee,35iah5,Ziazan,1 point,Sun May 10 18:32:48 2015 UTC,I am glad you like it. Your submission was personally one of my favorites. Thanks for entering!
