KerbalAcademy,3e3a4z,Bonesplitter,6,Tue Jul 21 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that shock cones are better at high altitudes/speeds than ram intakes, and have lower drag, allowing for faster speeds. Ram intakes have a similar advantages over circular intakes, which in turn have advantages over radial intakes.  So why not always use shock cones? If your design accommodates it, you can. But sometimes the other ones look cooler. And they are overkill for the smaller turbojets.  Spaceplanes are tricky because they're not rockets, but they are rockets, sort of. They generally need less wing than a conventional plane, and lots of horizontal thrust to get to orbit. RAPIERs are convenient because they can switch from air-breathing to closed-cycle (outside the atmosphere) so you don't need two different engines, but they are inefficient when run closed-cycle compared to most of the conventional rocket motors. you can get to orbit using ramjet and rockets just as easily.  To close an air intake, right click on it in flight and click ""Close Intake"" - or better yet, make an action group that does it for all your engines at once. Closing an intake reduces drag, but once you're out of the atmosphere it doesn't matter. Just don't forget to open them again when you get back in atmosphere or your jet engines won't fire ;)"

KerbalAcademy,3e01ph,jofwu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:56:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not a skilled programmer and I might not be understanding how things are working... but here's my two cents.   You're having trouble with going into SOIs, right? Not getting out of them? Sounds like it, and that would be the harder problem. If you've got an issue with the second then let me know.  You know the positions of your ship and every other ship/body (in the same SOI) at any point in time, right? So take the orbit of your active ship. Take it's orbital period or the time until it exits the current SOI (both of which I think aren't hard to figure), divide that up by some number, say 10.   T0=0 (now), T1=Period/10, T2=2xPeriod/10,.... T10=Period.   So that's 11 points in time total. Calculate the position of your ship and another object at each time. Compute the difference in positions (vector subtraction). Take the two time points with the smallest position difference. Repeat this process with the first time as T0 and the second as T10. Repeat until the time difference is below some acceptable level (say <1 second). Now you have their positions at closest approach.  If it's an object with an SOI, then each time you pick two new points you should see if the position difference of the two objects is less than the SOI boundary. If not, keep going. If it is, you will have crossed the boundary sometime before. Won't go into details on how to back up from there, since I could be entirely off base and wasting both of our times. :) But I don't think it would be too difficult to figure a way from here.  I don't know what the best number of divisions each time would be. That's a math/computer science problem I don't know much about. Maybe someone else can comment. Or maybe you can find a good number with trial and error. It has to be at least three points I think, for obvious reasons.  Maybe there's a better approach, but that's what I've come up with. :)"
KerbalAcademy,3e01ph,jofwu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:14 2015 UTC,"The vessels can move into and out of SOIs fine, it's a question of predicting in the future when a ship will enter an SOI.  Predicting SOI exits aren't hard, you're right. The edge of the SOI doesn't move relative to the coordinate system, so you can easily do bisection or some other numerical technique to hunt for the edge, because it's a fairly smooth curve. And you don't even need to fire the code to hunt for that unless your apoapsis is larger than the SOI.  What I'm struggling with is finding the entrance to an SOI, because that's also moving relative to the coordinate system, along with the vessel.  I mean, I guess what I really want to know is what's the best way to solve this optimization problem? I have two objects that move in a predictable path as a function of time, when will they come closest?"

And something about circular motion. Rotational kinematics/dynamics/momentum/energy is a plus (moments of inertia and whatnot).  On the math side, conic sections are good to know, trigonometry is a must, and basic calculus will help. Knowing some basics of vectors is also pretty important- what they are and some basic operations like dot products and cross products.  Next focus on orbits. Do some research on Kepler's laws and get a grasp of Keplerian Elements. Study the vis-viva equation, orbital energy, and anything else that comes up as you look at these. Wikipedia can be a good place to start I think. There's a lot of good links that will show up if you search. Here's a fantastic, free textbook: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7WvmGcRs5CzMDVPT3JnV25OdTg/edit.  Then get into design. The main thing here is the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.  You don't HAVE to start with the basics and work through slowly of course. If you're like me you'll start with whatever's interesting and then work backwards if something is confusing. :)  Aerodynamics, like you're asking in your question is... harder. Calculating drag on a ship (which is part of getting terminal velocity) is very complicated. So complicated in fact that the game has to simplify things a lot... which means that even if you have a degree in aerospace engineering you couldn't get very far if you didn't dig into the game and understand how the program works.

KerbalAcademy,3dycdu,ReliablyFinicky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"If your craft is having stability issues, you can try reducing the maximum thrust of your engines. I've had to do this when I'm launching things that aren't really supposed to fly, like mining stations that will be permanent fixtures on Minmus' surface once they get there...  Rather than connect everything needed for stable flight on awkward vessels, I limit thrust and spread my burns over multiple orbits. I find even unbalanced CoM/CoT ships with poor stability and some rubber banding... will fly acceptably when you aren't stressing them too hard. A good starting point is ~1.6-1.8Gs -- I set MechJeb utilities to a max acceleration of 15-18m/s2 and see how it goes from there, but you can also just reduce the max thrust of your engine by right clicking on it, or manually controlling it of course..."

KerbalAcademy,3dvsiw,jofwu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:33 2015 UTC,As part of the mks download you should have installed community resource pack. It comes with it so if you installed correctly extra resources should showmup.  I think that scansat has a setting to enable the new scans (it used to but I haven't used it in a while).  On your large map scan you can then choose which resource to see. If you can't get it to work try the stock scanner. RoverDude (of mks) wrote the stock resource scan code so that should be tried next. If that doesn't work then post in the mks thread on the ksp forums and we can try to track the bug.

KerbalAcademy,3dtqo0,DasNocti,5,Sun Jul 19 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add my observation to this as well, FAR's PID Tuner is actually amazingly useful when you figure out how to use it, but you always have to look it up separately, since none of the FAR tutorials online cover the full range of features available in the mod."
KerbalAcademy,3dtqo0,tehmike1987,3,Sun Jul 19 14:47:44 2015 UTC,What is a PID tuner?
KerbalAcademy,3dtqo0,shakefu,5,Sun Jul 19 23:23:02 2015 UTC,"So a PID is a controller used in engineering to control... Basically anything that has a physical output. From a non-engineer perspective getting a robot to hold a certain speed, follow a line, or hover is actually a pretty big problem. A simple controller for a line following robot for example, would simply say ""If you're too far to the left turn right, else if you're too far too the right turn left."" Now this program will run, but it will cause the robot to zig zag wildly as it follows the line. It can only turn left and right by one amount (say five° left and right), so choosing a larger turn rate will cause it to correct from being very far away from the line (a large error) quickly, but it will also make this larger correction when not very far from the line (small error) and will cause the robot to rapidly shoot past the line, once again creating a large error. So we can choose a smaller turn rate and have it make smaller, more frequent oscillations, or you can have a larger turn rate and have bigger, less frequent oscillations.     What we really need is a way to make a smaller correction with a smaller error. That's called proportional control and is what the P stands for. You somehow measure your error (like the difference between how fast you're going and your desired speed for a constant speed controller) and multiply that by some number you guess will provide good results(your proportional constant or Kp), and use that to control your steering or what have you and bam, proportional control. To think of these concepts imagine a graph for our line following robot where x is our error and input (in millimeters from the line), y is our output (in degrees steering left/right), and Kp is the slope that describes how much input causes how much output. We can visualize (or graph it if you like) two slopes(Kps), one .25 and the other .5. With an error (input) of 8 millimeters a Kp of .25 will cause an output of 2 degrees steering, while a Kp of .5 will cause 4 degrees of steering. A graph of our first line following robot's input to output ratio would be a horizontal line- any error creates the same output. But now we can get a larger output for a larger error and modify how that happens by changing our Kp.    You now have a line following robot that does a pretty good job following a line, but it still makes frequent oscillations. By playing with the Kp you can minimize this, but you can't remove it completely. We can implement two new controller outputs, though. We'll have our controller track how error builds up over time and make increasingly larger outputs if the error continues as time goes on (that's integral, Ki) and another to see how quickly error accumulates and make larger outputs the more quickly we gain error(derivative, Kd). With all three components in our controller we can now make a line following robot that will track beautifully.    Our I and our D need to be played with to find the right values for the situation they are being applied to, just as was necessary with Kp for the proportional part of our controller. So playing with P, I, and D until your controller behaves properly is PID tuning, in this case to control FAR's stability assist. If all this interests you than come pay us a visit at /r/kOS. The community there is absolutely amazing, can't recommend it highly enough."

KerbalAcademy,3dtqo0,tehmike1987,3,Sun Jul 19 16:21:23 2015 UTC,"It was included in FAR as a replacement for the (very badly optimized) default SAS. Mechjeb has somewhat similar capabilities, but the most recent stable build doesn't have the same versatility. In FAR you can tweak the parameters to within six significant figures, but Mechjeb is limited to two. This makes a huge difference on the level of stability you can expect in both atmospheric and vacuum flight, to the point where Mechjeb's PID tuner has to be left off both in and out of atmosphere."

If you have crash reports you might want to upload them for sharing and seek help here. Have you tried forcing openGL instead of directx?  If you haven't been deleting your game folder manually by finding it in */Steam/steamapps/common and just deleting local game content via Steam then Steam won't get rid of anything user-added, so things could still be hanging around causing trouble.  Is the game just crashing with no notice, or do you get an error message telling you it has crashed and saved a crash report? Check your main KSP folder and see if it contains any folders that are named with the date and time of your crashes; these contain crash reports.  If you have a crash report I would recommend uploading it somewhere for sharing and making a post to the unmodded installs support forum.  Something else to try in the mean time is to launch KSP using openGL graphics instead of DirectX, which often helps if it's a RAM issue. If you're launching via Steam then find KSP in your steam library and open it's properties (like when you're verifying the game cache). On the General tab click the Set Launch Options... button then enter "" -force-opengl"" into the window. If you use CKAN you can go to the Settings menu and select KSP command-line then append the "" -force-opengl"" so it reads ""KSP.exe -force-opengl"".  Your symptoms aren't entirely the same as mine, but before I started using openGL I would crash 90% of the time I returned to KSC, whether from a mission in progress or after a recovering a landed vessel. Something about the way the game unloads the flight scene assets and loads up the KSC scene assets always spikes the memory usage into crash territory for me, though that could be due a specific mod I use too. Still, using openGL was such an improvement for me and is so simple to implement that I'd say it's worth a shot.  As a side note, if it does solve the problem you may notice that running under openGL can disable antialiasing and possibly a few other graphics processing features from being applied. This can be worked around, depending on your graphics card/drivers. I have an NVIDIA gpu and through the NVIDIA Control Panel's Manage 3D Settings menu I alter ksp.exe to override application settings and force antialiasing. Gets me all the stability of the openGL launch without the graphical drawbacks. I would assume AMD drivers/config utility can do something similar."

There's really not much you can do with a vacuum stage, other than: simply add way more fuel, asparagus, make it into two stages (more tank dropping), or reduce the payload mass.  All I'll say is that a 0.02 TWR is really really annoying. Getting 400t into orbit is really really annoying. Adding enough fuel to get you to 3k dV is going to put you at more like 600t, which is really really annoying.  To get it into  orbit you'll need to assemble it in orbit, or send it up dry and refuel in orbit.

KerbalAcademy,3dpvf3,ReliablyFinicky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:37:19 2015 UTC,"As others have said, moar fuel. Also put some more engines on there. I get that the idea is less engines to push around means more delta V but any thrust to weigh ratio below .1 is just unworkable. I usually aim for .4 to .8.  Anyway, back to delta V. Using nuke engines you need a mass ratio of about 1.5 (about 1 3rd of your mass as fuel) to get 3000~ delta V. You have mods doing all this math for you, but if you wanted to do it yourself this is how:  There are a few factors for delta V. Wet mass (as in total mass with fuel), dry mass (mass without fuel), and specific impulse. We can't improve What matters is the ratio of wet mass to dry mass, which you can get by dividing the wet mass by the dry mass. A mass ratio of 1.5 would mean that your rocket is 1.5 times as heavy when it has fuel in it, and a 2.0 would mean half your mass is fuel. Then you have to use the log function on your calculator (the ""ln"" button). After you have that you multiply it by Isp. The Isp listed in the part stats is in a different unit than the equation needs so you have to multiply this by 9.8. then you have delta V.  Lets try this with some numbers. 450(wet mass) / 300(dry mass) = 1.5(mass ratio). Then we log that. ln(1.5) = 0.405~. Then we multiply it by the Isp (which is how fast we throw the fuel out the back). 0.405 * 800 (then multiply by 9.8 to convert listed Isp to usable Isp) * 9.8 = 3,175.2. So for 3000~ delta V you want a mass ratio of about 1.5, or about 1 3rd of your craft."

But if you'd rather not spend an afternoon learning how to use a mod, than yeah, just post an example plane and we'll try to help you out. It sounds like your primary problem is having your center of lift in front of your center of mass, and that is an easy problem to solve.

FAR will show you the realistic stability of your plane over a range as the COL moves, tell you if a control surface is underpowered, if it's not located well, and it gives you crucial information on stability. Figuring out your roll and yaw stability at various altitudes and speeds all in the FAR window is significantly better than guessing as to what the causes are and then finding out with many explosions that that your spaceplane has terrible yaw stability at 25,000 meters. And there's unintuitive things, too, like yaw being induced from roll, which can be a very large factor. How do you do all this by just eye balling? Before I used FAR I hated designing airplanes, and now I very much enjoy it. There's more up front design time but there's significantly less sacrificing Jeb to the gods of trial and error.     I recognize that one is being asked to understand a not inconsiderable amount of physics and scary looking data, but the choice is between that and seemingly never ending frustration.

Unless you're looking for Uber performance and are trying to avoid bottlenecks, but that's not a big concern anymore.   RAM compatibility CAN be an issue, but if you grab a couple links and ask the nice people of Reddit, they should come through. Worst case scenario if you buy from a reputable dealer is you have to return the RAM and try a different kit.  For 600 bucks you get something light-years ahead of what you linked.

The ONLY way to get them was (and still is) to make a SLA (Service-Level-Agreement) with Microsoft - which explicitly forbids splitting the package (which usually starts somewhere around 1k copies (or CALs for Server)).

If it doesn't belong there, it's either downright pirated or a 'butchered' license (originally came with a disc / physical CoA / etc) and those are not legal licenses (at least in NA/EU/Australia/NZ).

Not even from big companies. They are either end-user oriented and full of useless gimmicky crap noone needs and include special parts which make upgrading a pain in the ass, or they are office pcs, usually completely underpowered for gaming. Even pre-built gaming pcs are to be avoided, they put in ridiculous expensive hardware and charge you a shitton of money for their brand (eg. Alienware)  Also you want peripherals, namely Keyboard, mouse, screen. Buying the cheapest screen is also a good way to ruin the whole experience for you, and it is probably the thing that will outlive two or more pcs.  My advise: Buy the parts seperately and assemble them yourself. Don't be cheap and try to buy a pc for a single game, build it so it can run games in two years on reasonable graphics setting. (Running games maxed out requires ridiculous eypensive hardware for very small visual improvements)  Find someone you trust to choose and assemble the pc for you, alternatively there may be small shops that build custom pcs."

You'd need to bring a ""professional"" kerbal too.  A lander can or command chair are both lighter than a MK 1-2 pod, and would make great options for a tourist or crew member to land on minmus.  The pod your kerbals will use to get home can stay in orbit around Minmus with just enough engines and fuel to get back.  If you give the lander and booster a docking port, you can land the tourist, launch back into orbit and dock with the booster to refill the lander's fuel and put a ""professional"" kerbal in the can/chair, then complete the survey, then dock again and transfer all your crew into the pod, decouple the pod and go home.  If you want to use lab modules effectively, you need leveled Scientists.  The difference between a lab with level 0 scientists and level 2 is ~0.5 science per day v 5 science per day.  You can get a kerbal to level 2 in one launch by flying by Mun, landing on Minmus, and returning to Kerbin.  You might want to land the tourist and 2-3 Scientists in a hitchhiker storage container, and include a Mun flyby at some point in the mission.

KerbalAcademy,3dcaar,thinkweis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:52:18 2015 UTC,I have only made tests within kerbin SOI and none of them worked on the ground on a 100km orbit or on geo orbit.
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,jayz_7,3,Wed Jul 15 03:07:37 2015 UTC,Do you play Career mode? There's a mod called Contract Configurator and a contract pack for it called Remote Tech Contract Pack. Install those and you can just learn as you play. You'll get contracts that pretty much hold your hand and take you through the concepts one step at a time.
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,jofwu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"LKO stands for low kerbin orbit, which is generally considered below 250km   Have you ever used a protractor before? You probably know that a circle has 360 degrees, right?  Now picture a perfect circle, and then picture dropping an isosceles triangle right over the top of it, so that none of the sides touch the circle.  Now, if you measure the angles of each point, you'll find that they are roughly 120 degrees from each other (exactly if you have a perfect drawing).   Setting up a communications network is exactly the same thing, but in order for the sides of the triangle not to touch the circle, your satellites need to be in an orbit above 1500km and roughly 120 degrees away from each other. It should be noted though, that most people will put their satellites in a geostationary orbit around kerbin to make things simpler. A geostationary orbit is at roughly 2868.2km, and what's special about it is that at that altitude, your orbital speed matches kerbins rotation so that your satellite will stay over exactly the same spot on kerbin all the time.   Now, when measuring the angles of your satellites, it should be noted that 0 and 360 are in exactly the same spot, and for simplicity, you can assume that 0 is directly above KSC (kerbal space center) or wherever your first satellite is.  I hope I explained it enough for you, if you have any other questions, or need a better explanation just let me know. I'd be happy to dig around for some videos or info graphics to help you understand it more clearly."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,Thesciencenut,2,Wed Jul 15 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"I've yet to figure out why geostationary is so desirable. I get that it doesn't move in relation to kerbin, but so what? You still need two more so there aren't blackout periods. If you have an answer I would love to hear it."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,datmotoguy,2,Wed Jul 15 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"There are a few reasons, and they differ based on how you play.   For sandbox, it's done because it's a place that's useful for real-world  comms satellites, and just like space stations, outside of role-play, there's little in-game benefit.  In science and career, making your ring really low means that you need more of them before you lose line of sight because of the horizon.  Putting your ring at higher altitudes means that a lot of the time, (until you unlock bigger omni antennas) your onmi antennas will be out of range of the KSC, and you will need to dedicate a directional dish on every satellite to point to KSC.  At synchronous orbit, only the satellite directly above the KSC needs to dedicated a dish for ground comms. This means that you can either save money by leaving a dish off the other satellites in the ring, or have extras for pointing out to the mun and beyond.  As you unlock larger antennas, both omni and directional, you'll probably find yourself wanting or needing to replace your cluster anyway. A synchronous and useful cluster is actually fairly hard to put up with the most basic antennas, so its also a personal/progression-type achievement to have the tech unlocked to put one that far out."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,spottybutt,3,Wed Jul 15 11:10:17 2015 UTC,"Even the best omni is too weak to do a geosynchronous omni network though. With non KSO synced orbits I can set up all omni sats and devote the bigger antennas to actually communicating (initially with the mun/minimus, then later with a high eccentricity polar sat with longer range)."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:32:56 2015 UTC,I placed my satellites at 236k as it was evenly a 3hr orbit (iirc). Plus my 250k omni worked and my dishes could just point at minmus.
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,datmotoguy,2,Thu Jul 16 07:51:44 2015 UTC,"In real life, it's extremely desirable because it's altitude allows large areas of coverage and more importantly, it allows ground based antennae to be fixed and not constantly readjusted.  However, in ksp, unless you're using a mod that requires you to actively aim for a particular satellite  (like interstellar) having a fixed antenna isn't that big of a deal, but the altitude is beneficial because it's high enough that your missions to Minmus, and the Mun will get better coverage, possibly even from your omni range antennae.  Now, this isn't really common knowledge, but it is actually possible to build a communications network with just two satellites at that altitude, but it requires extreme precision and your satellites need to be positioned at the 90 and 270 degree positions (with ksc at 0)  I would never recommend a configuration of that sort though, because it still has drawbacks like when you go interplanetary you'll be more likely to have your signal cut off by a moon."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,Thesciencenut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"Huh, never thought about the ground satellites. Thanks for the information!"
KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,datmotoguy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:49:13 2015 UTC,"Well, to cover the real basics... LKO is Low Kerbin Orbit. That's an orbit with an altitude above Kerbin's surface that's anywhere from 70km to 250km (that's from the edge of the atmosphere, to the line where science reports go from ""In Space Low Over Kerbin's Oceans"" to ""In Space High Over Kerbin."") I would personally define a Medium Kerbin Orbit from 250km up to 2,868km, math defines kerbisynchronous orbit as 2,868.75 km, and then I'd define a High Kerbin Orbit from there out to the edge of Kerbin's sphere of influence.  Your communications satellites, unless you're doing something really specific, are going to be in circular orbits. Semimajor axis is the average of the periapse and apoapse measured down to the planet's core; for a circular orbit around Kerbin, that's orbital altitude + 600km. The reason SMA is so important for communications satellites is that the SMA determines how long it takes to complete an orbit. If you have three satellites and one takes less or more time to orbit than the other two, it will creep forward or backward and leave a gap in your satellites. If you can get your satellites to have the same SMA to within a few meters, it won't matter if their orbits are a little egg-shaped, the satellites will return to the same position relative to each other on every orbit.  To really answer your question, I would suggest either three satellites spaced equally at an altitude of your choice -- whatever it is, just make sure all three are the same -- between 700 and 800 km, or four satellites at any convenient altitude from 400 to 1150 km."

KerbalAcademy,3dc5wu,TriTraTrololol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:07:22 2015 UTC,"It's possible to build a more efficient network (less sats, less dishes) than this, but here's a pretty good guide to follow to teach you what you need to know. You can follow it step by step to setup your first robust network. And afterwards you should understand how to design your own network. There are also tutorials on the remote tech github page, last I checked.  If you're playing career mode, make sure you have the contract pack mods that add contracts for setting up comm networks.  Edit: Since it's a little dated, I'd double check the math on the electrical usage numbers before launching anything. I don't remember if there's been any balance changes to solar panels or antennas that would change the amount of batteries you need. Here's a battery and darkness time calculator to help with that."

KerbalAcademy,3dc5at,FoolishBalloon,10,Wed Jul 15 03:02:31 2015 UTC,"The term you're looking for is ""virtual machine,"" and while you can do it, you'll get much better performance if you dual-boot."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5at,CaptainTightpants_64,2,Wed Jul 15 03:26:21 2015 UTC,"To add to what CaptainTightpants said, you will get unusable performance using a virtual machine and it will in fact be more inconvenient as you would have to boot into windows and then into Linux. Dual booting is pretty easy to do and I think worth it for 64bit stable KSP."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5at,YabbyEyes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:32:07 2015 UTC,Bang on.  Virtual machine means you basically run an emulator to run linux to run KSP.  Setting up a drive partition will give you much better performance.

KerbalAcademy,3dc5at,CaptainTightpants_64,3,Wed Jul 15 03:31:47 2015 UTC,"I don't have raw numbers off the top of my head, but your system's having to split resources between the host and the VM. The VM also can't access the GPU directly, so you've got a performance hit there as well. VMs are nice if you want to get the feel for Linux before installing it, but I wouldn't run KSP in one."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5at,YabbyEyes,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"The performance will be terrible and I'd be surprised if it worked at all. The reason being that your host system is driving your GPU, CPU and all hardware directly while the VM is running everything through a virtual interface therefore the VM does not have access to your graphics card. While incredibly useful for some things, gaming is not one of them."
KerbalAcademy,3dc5at,vmerc,2,Wed Jul 15 03:42:52 2015 UTC,Modern virtualization is pretty much direct hardware CPU and RAM access. The GPU is really the biggest issue.

KerbalAcademy,3d69md,PrinceHans,14,Mon Jul 13 21:17:25 2015 UTC,Geostationary orbit in ksp is at a height of 2868.4 km. The orbit has to be circular. It's quite high so you'll need some fuel to get there which makes it not ideal for a space station. Rendezvous also isn't easier than in LKO so I see no economic reason to build a station there. It would be cool though...
KerbalAcademy,3d69md,Speckknoedel,2,Mon Jul 13 21:51:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, I guess rendezvous might be a little easier in that you wouldn't have to wait for a particular launch window.

KerbalAcademy,3d69md,XenoRyet,2,Mon Jul 13 21:59:55 2015 UTC,Ah yeah thats quite a height! But sounds like something fun to do in Sandbox! It just seemed like an interesting idea to me for the shits n giggles.
KerbalAcademy,3d69md,DarkwolfAU,4,Mon Jul 13 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"Doesn't help at all for a rendezvous, since you still need to do a launch to intercept anyway, which means every launch to rendezvous is going to have to burn enough dV to get into a geostationary orbit.  Remember that in geostationary orbit, the satellite is still orbiting, it's just going around the planet at the same rate the planet is turning around itself."
KerbalAcademy,3d69md,fibonatic,7,Tue Jul 14 00:25:26 2015 UTC,"The orbit does not have to be circular, only the semi-major axis has to very accurate, since that affects the orbital period, which has to match the side real rotation period of the celestial body.

KerbalAcademy,3d69md,FellKnight,13,Mon Jul 13 22:12:40 2015 UTC,Geostationary does have to be circular or very close to it.  Geosynchronous can be many different types of orbits and only the semi-major axis matters.
KerbalAcademy,3d69md,ReliablyFinicky,5,Tue Jul 14 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"For a geostationary orbit, the semi-major axis has to be very accurate, and the inclination has to be very accurate, and the eccentricity has to be very accurate.  A geostationary orbit that is not circular (eccentricity 0), or is not at the equator (inclination 0) is not a geostationary orbit, it's a geosynchronous orbit (an orbit that also does 1 orbit for each rotation of the planet, but does not stay stationary relative to the ground)."

It's practically impossible to make a completely flat surface, so when do we start calling a surface flat vs irregular?  For what it's worth, when I'm setting the altitude/inclination for my narrow-band scanners, I do achieve the exact inclination and eccentricity desired within the 3 decimal places the game provides. Using RCS and making small adjustments until you're happy... it probably only takes 5-10 minutes.    A statite, a hypothetical satellite that uses a solar sail to modify its orbit, could theoretically hold itself in a geostationary ""orbit"" with different altitude and/or inclination from the ""traditional"" equatorial geostationary orbit."

To reach a geostationary orbit, you'll probably need at least ~5k ∆v. With ideal ascent profiles and whatnot you could probably squeak it out for 4500-4600."

Also, airbrakes are really (maybe a bit too) good. You may need to make sure there is battery power and reaction wheels to keep you facing surface prograde/retrograde, but you can lock it into the flight computer before the connection goes out, and it will stay (you'll probably want at least 3-way symmetry on the brakes, or else it might be hard to keep the ship facing the right way)."

I'm working on a elaborate scenario (A storyline! cutscenes! a goal that makes sense in the context of the game!) that emphasizes stock builds across several tech levels; I haven't talked to coltonf about it yet, but the design is pretty spot-on to what I had conceived and was going to build; the less modeling I have to do, the better so I'm hoping to borrow it. if I can make it work for non-pilots.

So if you have a 500t ship to build in orbit. You will require a lot more fuel and rocket engines to get that into orbit compared to 5 100t launches even though you have to have more overhead (engines, tanks, probe systems)  The Rocket Equation takes a huge role in this. You can work backwards from this to figure out how much fuel and how powerful of an engine you need. If you look at the examples on the wiki page it is rather helpful. Basically for a 2 stage system with an exhaust velocity of 4,500 meters per second. and 9700 Delta-v total. 8.7% of the total launch mass is what remains for second stage tanks and engines and payload. if you make that 8% really big then you need a bunch of fuel plus you need the mass of the first stage tanks and engines. It is really easy to end up making a rocket really, really big to support getting all the mass to orbit.   At some point in kerbal space program, the rocket becomes too top-heavy, too unweildy. In the real world, the rocket becomes just to expensive and hard to operate. Add in the added complexity of more stages, more parts, more chances to fail. This is the primary argument against the SLS and making heavy lift launch vehicles over using what we have now (delta heavy, F9 Heavy) to launch up parts in quick succession and building it in orbit."

This is the primary argument against the SLS and making heavy lift launch vehicles over using what we have now (delta heavy, F9 Heavy) to launch up parts in quick succession and building it in orbit.   Yes, big SLS rockets are more complicated than simply reusing smaller rockets.  But this complexity means any mars transfer vehicle assembled in orbit could be assembled from fewer/larger modules rather than many/smaller modules.  And the number of modules complicates the final assembled vehicle, adding more points of failure.    So the way I see it is you can have a more complicated launch vehicle that could go wrong and blow up on launch (which will have no crew in it at the time)… or you could have a more complicated Mars transfer vehicle that could go wrong and kill the crew somewhere between Earth and Mars.  Which is the lesser of two evils?  Which should be given priority in maintaining simplicity?  IMO the final assembled payload with people in it is more mission-critical, so I'd think that SLS makes sense over using smaller rockets to lift more modules.   what we have now (delta heavy, F9 Heavy)   I'd also like to point out while we now have delta heavies, we do not have F9 heavy.

If one of your 5 launches fails then you have to replace 20% of whatever you're assembling. Not a good thing for sure but within acceptable risk.  If your single launcher fails then your boss is not going to be happy"

You will require a lot more fuel and rocket engines to get that into orbit compared to 5 100t launches even though you have to have more overhead (engines, tanks, probe systems)   Completely false. If you duct tape 3 rocket stacks together you will be able to launch exactly 3 times as much payload.   8.7% of the total launch mass is what remains for second stage tanks and engines and payload. if you make that 8% really big then you need a bunch of fuel plus you need the mass of the first stage tanks and engines.   You are clearly misunderstanding something. If you double the payload everything else doubles in mass as well. You need twice as much fuel, so you need twice as much fuel tank, and since everything has become twice as heavy you need twice the engine power. You seem to think that the engine mass goes up exponentially or something. It doesn't. The engine becomes twice as massive and is therefore the same fraction of the dry mass.   Add in the added complexity of more stages, more parts, more chances to fail. This is the primary argument against the SLS and making heavy lift launch vehicles over using what we have now (delta heavy, F9 Heavy) to launch up parts in quick succession and building it in orbit.   It's the completely opposite. Heavy lift allows for fewer stages, less complexity and lower probability of failure.  The primary argument against SLS, or at least the most effective one as I see it, is that there are no payloads being built for it.

As long as your computer can handle it and the payload isn't to difficult to deal with in one piece, then the single 500 tonne launch is better. If you're decent at rendezvousing and docking the difference might be negligible, but it's there.  If there was a mod that added cost incentives for mass produced rockets, upkeep cost and construction time it would make orbital assemblies more cost effective. Maybe each time a sub assembly is used in a launch it's price drops slightly, and if you stop using it the cost creeps back up?  That would actually create an economic incentive to do orbital assembly that isn't simply part count driven. Would be nice given how much work it takes for the player."

It throws a 9.2 tonne payload https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/p/p5.png  Here's a rocket that's 15 times larger, and it's payload is also 15 times more massive https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/p/p1.png  It would be really strange if this wasn't the case, because then you'd have this mysterious situation where two rocket can lift their respective payloads when they fly in parallel, but their performance magically drops when you actually attach them to each other."

One of the big considerations with this is the structural integrity and part count of the final vessel. Ships that are snapped together with docking ports can be harder to keep rigid and stable.

KerbalAcademy,3d1hg2,eschybach,2,Sun Jul 12 20:21:16 2015 UTC,"No I'm planning a maneuver to escape, so it's typically at periapsis. And there's no atmosphere because I'm at Minmus currently. But it doesn't matter: I think this phenomenon is happening everywhere."
KerbalAcademy,3d1hg2,RumAndCookies,6,Sun Jul 12 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"I've seen this behavior for a long time and it's never caused any trouble (so long as you allow yourself enough time between coming out of warp and burn execution to correct your alignment). MechJeb's autopilot function is even coded to accommodate it, dropping out of time warp a few minutes before the burn time to adjust your heading to the node before resuming warp to the burn time.  I think it's based on your ship holding an orientation that's absolute in reference to the whole solar/planetary system, while the maneuver node's frame of reference is based on whichever body's SOI the maneuver node falls into, but the amount by which the maneuver's vector drifts seems a bit more than it should if that alone were the case."

KerbalAcademy,3d0crc,easytomemorize,2,Sun Jul 12 16:28:13 2015 UTC,You can also tell by looking at the ascending and descending nodes for the target orbit when you hover over them and it shows the angle. If it's close to 0 degrees you're probably fine but if it says something like 180 degrees then you're going the opposite way.  Edit: It's also worth noting that pretty much everything natural is orbiting and spinning counter-clockwise when viewed from above. Some of the satellite contracts with higher rewards will require you to achieve a clockwise orbit because it'll require more delta-v.

You want to look for the part where your orbit and the target orbit ""cross over"" and make the plane correction there.  The other thing is, when you make a manoeuvre node to adjust your periapsis or apoapsis, you can drag the node along your orbit to change the position of the burn. This makes it much easier to not just get the right peri/apo, but also to have them at the right parts of your orbit."
KerbalAcademy,3d0crc,RumAndCookies,2,Sun Jul 12 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"No correction necessary, you're right on the ascending node and descending node markers!

KerbalAcademy,3d0crc,unique_username_384,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant the opposite. The An and Dn that are marked on the target orbit are relative to the equator. You want the An and Dn relative to your current orbit, which is usually different. Because KSP doesn't let you set the target orbit as a target, you have to actually look for the points where your orbit and the target orbit ""cross over"", otherwise you'll end up burning in the wrong place.  Of course this whole point is moot if you launch into a perfectly equatorial orbit in the first place, but how often does that work out?"
KerbalAcademy,3d0crc,featherwinglove,2,Sun Jul 12 16:35:58 2015 UTC,"Derp! I'll take another look next time I've got a satellite contract, but I think you're right about the AN and DN indicated along the target orbit not being relative to your current craft's orbit."

If so, you'd have to ask whoever was on Squad's tech tree rebalance team for an authoritative answer, but I'd speculate it falls somewhere between 3 points:   Realism in tech progress: Radiators were around long before rockets and had plenty of applications besides thermal regulation of spacecraft. Availability for uncommon cases where they're needed early: Even early in the game it's possible to create an overpowered rocket that picks up a lot of heat from leaving the atmosphere at high speeds and could theoretically be saved by adding radiators. Mod-friendliness: I know of a handful of mods that include simple generators or other equipment that generates a lot of heat and is available fairly early in the tech tree."

It's actually fairly complex and I haven't come upon too many really strong references on it yet. You can read about some of the basics on the KSP wiki, but you'll probably need to do a bit of experimenting on your own to figure out what works with your design.  For issues with atmospheric entry I'm not sure how much radiators are going to help since they're going to get heated by the atmosphere as well (and will be too ""busy"" radiating their own heat to draw it out of the rest of the craft); they're generally more useful for getting rid of heat being created by a part within the craft itself."

KerbalAcademy,3czpeu,Urishima,5,Tue Jul 14 12:47:34 2015 UTC,"To clarify, is it just the FPS going down, or is time in the game is actually slowing down, i.e. the flight timer at the top left is turning yellow or red and game seconds are passing more slowly than real-world seconds?  If the timer isn't changing colors and the game time is running normally then it's a rendering issue and you may need to scale back your graphics settings, though this is uncommon as KSP graphics aren't generally intense enough to bog down most relatively modern systems.  If the timer color is changing then you're running into the limitations of the game engine running all the physics calculations through your processor in a single thread. The next big KSP update is supposed to get us on a newer version of the Unity engine that will do a lot to improve this, but that's not of much help right now.  The one thing you can try fiddling with (though it should be done with caution) is the ""Max Physics Delta Time"" slider in the general settings. Explaining it is a little weird and I'm honestly not sure I fully understand it myself, but it generally controls how much the game will increase the ratio of real-world seconds to Kerbal seconds when it has to slow down the game to finish all the physics calculations. I might have the left/right backwards (I've avoided fiddling with this much myself), but if the slider is all the way to the right then Kerbal time will slow down a lot but it will accurately complete most/all physics calculations so your ship should stay stable. If you move the slider more to the left then the game will start to give up on physics calculations when they're taking too long and Kerbal time will move faster, but if the physics calculations that it had to give up on were something important you can end up with larger ships spontaneously disassembling."

If not that than how strong are your reaction wheels? If they are very weak it may be very minor imbalances that are just difficult for the SAS to correct for. Stuff like accidental asymmetrical fuel transfer or small parts applied asymmetrically could be the problem. If your reaction wheels are strong then you would likely need an extra engine.

In a longer fuselage you can actually see your ship porpoising through space, and it can lead to sudden unplanned disassembly.  This is very noticeable if you use a big engine on a smaller stage.  (But the Kerbodyne is so efficient!  Why wouldn't you use it everywhere you can?  Especially with the Tweakscale mod!)  If RCS is turned on, you can also quickly use up all your monopropellent as the rocket tries to correct for its overcorrection.  Try cutting back the rocket's gimbal limit to about 30%.  This will limit how far the rocket's nozzle can pivot during SAS thrust vector stabilization.  I do this in the VAB while building the rocket.  As a rule of thumb, if my TWR is over 1.5, I cut back the gimbal by at least half.  If I'm using asparagus staging, or just a circle of liquid fuel boosters, I'll often lock their gimbals while leaving the center booster's gimbal untouched, or cut back to 50%."

The semi-major axis is pretty easy to calculate or estimate and the gravitational parameter is given for each body in the game (if you focus it in the map screen and hit the little info button).

That's the time for a one-way trip. And it assumes you're taking the most fuel efficient route (or something close to it). In other words, it assumes you're leaving at the typical transfer window.  It's also just the time it takes to perform the main transfer. Each leg of the trip would take more time of course... But compared to the 300 days it takes to go to Duna, what does it matter if you throw a few more days on top of that? (to get form low Kerbin orbit to Kerbin's SOI, for example) Hopefully your planning isn't cutting it THAT close. :)  Make sense?  The problem is that, if you plan on coming back to Kerbin, you'll have to wait for the next transfer window. So you can't just double the one-way trip time and add how long you want to stay. You'd have to figure out when the next transfer window is and stay at least long enough for that. The transfer window planner mentioned by others can help with that."

KerbalAcademy,3cv4yi,Phil_Tact,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:28:34 2015 UTC,Make sure its enabled? It should lock the vertical placement of your radial decoupler and also the tank when you place it on the decoupler. The part should not move vertically when you move the mouse up and down the length of your rocket... heh.
KerbalAcademy,3cv4yi,alias_enki,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:53:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I know what it does. It used to work in past versions of ksp with editor extensions. Thanks anyways.
KerbalAcademy,3cv4yi,Phil_Tact,8,Wed Jul 22 03:04:24 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding your question and this is old news, but are you using the symmetry controls that appear at the bottom left of the assembly screen? It should show a yellow dot in the middle, then when you click on it it will toggle through different symmetry options. With two-sided symmetry enabled any part you attach to the rocket will have a counterpart attached on the exact opposite side at the same height and orientation."
KerbalAcademy,3cv4yi,RumAndCookies,2,Sat Jul 11 01:36:21 2015 UTC,"Alternatively you can use the hotkey X, to toggle symmetry."
KerbalAcademy,3cv4yi,eschybach,3,Sat Jul 11 07:11:04 2015 UTC,"You mean on the same level as the rockets in the central stack? I generally attach a booster to a decouple without caring too much about where it ends up vertically, and then grab the sub-assembly by the decoupler and move that vertically."
KerbalAcademy,3cv4yi,asaz989,2,Sat Jul 11 01:35:45 2015 UTC,"If it's something you can't do using the symmetry tools like others have suggested: with angle snap on, use the offset tool once you have the parts close to where they need to be. The parts will snap to fixed increments, and you just have to make sure they're snapping to the same places."
KerbalAcademy,3cv4yi,katalliaan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:49:59 2015 UTC,"Doesn't happen easily, I usually eyeball it, but you can use the offset thingy, if it's set to snap then it /usually/ snaps to the same places on a given part."

KerbalAcademy,3cq0hl,merv243,3,Thu Jul 9 21:13:18 2015 UTC,"Obviously, this is very basic. Notably, it won't work for stages which contain different engines.   I'm not sure if you simply chose not to mix different engines in a single stage, or didn't know how, but just in case you don't know how to calculate Isp for different engines together, here's the equation for it. (source article)  Bear in mind that's just for a single stage.  And here's a kOS example of how to do it:  set ispsum to 0. set maxthrustlimited to 0. LIST ENGINES in MyEngines. for engine in MyEngines {     if engine:ISP > 0 {         set ispsum to ispsum + (engine:MAXTHRUST / engine:ISP).         set maxthrustlimited to maxthrustlimited + (engine:MAXTHRUST * (engine:THRUSTLIMIT / 100) ).     } } set ispavg to ( maxthrustlimited / ispsum ). set g0 to 9.82. set ve to ispavg * g0. set dv to NEXTNODE:DELTAV:MAG. set m0 to SHIP:MASS. set Th to maxthrustlimited. set e  to CONSTANT():E. set burntime to (m0 * ve / Th) * (1 - e^(-dv/ve)).   I imagine you could kind of fake mixed engines clusters by pretending it's a single custom-mod engine, and inserting the averaged Isp and summed thrust there.  Just an idea.  That would avoid having to significantly change the bulk of your formulas."

Yeah, I've seen/used that formula before but honestly the reason I didn't do it was laziness because it makes the layout more complicated.

Sadly my vacation is almost over :/"
KerbalAcademy,3cq0hl,Majromax,2,Fri Jul 10 13:36:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the ""half burn time"" approximation is appropriate when stages have differing thrusts.  Instead, I think the better approximation would be that half of the ΔV should be expended before the node and half after.  Consider a silly case of a 100 m/s burn, where 99 m/s can be provided instantly by a ridiculously overpowered stage, but 1 m/s will take a minute to produce from an ion engine.  ""Half time"" would suggest beginning the burn 30 seconds before the node, but that expends almost all of the orbit-changing energy well before the node itself."

KerbalAcademy,3cq0hl,jofwu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"Caveat: If you're like me, you use MechJeb for rote tasks like Ascent Guidance to optimize LKO delta-V or generate pork chop plots or do fast Hohmann transfers. Also, if you're like me, Calc II gives you migraines, and it can be difficult to keep a list of numbers in your head straight.  That being said, is the MechJeb stage time column in the Delta-V Stats not good enough?   leftover ∆v. Now, your interplanetary stage probably has a much lower TWR than your launch stage. This makes it harder to time the node, but you certainly don't just want to waste that precious ∆v!   A transfer to Jool will take correction burns anyway, and a handful of dV near Kerbin would be equal to a few thousand km near Jool, so it's not that much saved. Additionally, in my experience, MechJeb inherently takes into account TWR changes and staging when timing a burn, so this reasoning seems altogether invalid.  Also, why not add the rocket equation in place of ""dv""?"
KerbalAcademy,3cq0hl,leforian,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds like we have different uses for MechJeb.  I want to calculate and create my own maneuvers, and execute them manually, except for the MOST trivial things (like circularizing).  If youa re using MJ to execute your node, then yeah, you don't need this.   A transfer to Jool will take correction burns anyway, and a handful of dV near Kerbin would be equal to a few thousand km near Jool, so it's not that much saved   I meant by ditching the stage to have a nice, predictable burn time (given to you by KSP itself when you create the node).

KerbalAcademy,3cq5nu,Cocolumbo,5,Thu Jul 9 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"Put a rudder on it, either a control surface or just a fin. I'd guess you're tipping simply because your craft is wide and flat with nothing aerodynamically preventing gravity from tipping it over as it follows the path of least resistance."
KerbalAcademy,3cq5nu,Scarecrow3,3,Fri Jul 10 01:12:13 2015 UTC,"Right now you have zero yaw control. You need some sort of fin that controls the left/right motion of the shuttle.  Also, if you don't have it, re-entry will be a PITA. Flat spins will happen if you're not careful.  As a general tip for build shuttle, you need to be careful when tilting your SSME's. If you rotate them in an odd way, it can introduce a thrust asymetry which will cause a yaw irrespective of how much yaw control you have.  Last point, download RCS build aid. Its the greatest shuttle building tool ever. Set the mode to ""engines"" and what the torque is like on the craft at different phases of the ascent."
KerbalAcademy,3cq5nu,rootnegative,2,Fri Jul 10 01:49:50 2015 UTC,"Beyond needing rudder to take off, as you get into the hypersonic range your vertical stabilizer/rudder becomes less effective.  If you put a minimal amount of yaw stabilization necessary at low altitude and low speed than you will likely run into problems later on. Look at real hypersonic vehicles like the space shuttle, the X-15, or the SR-71. They have quite a lot of vertical stabilizer relative to their horizontal lifting surfaces.    Tl;dr: If you go really fast you need a lot of vertical stabilizer."

KerbalAcademy,3cpkw9,Aniahlator,-2,Thu Jul 9 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"I'll throw a different idea out there.  Exactly on the apo and exactly horizontal.  This way you're falling back to the planet a bit. If this is the case, you're burning mostly prograde but also a little radial as well. It'll have the effect of having a very controlled effect on your orbit.

KerbalAcademy,3copep,itbrokeoff,4,Thu Jul 9 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts from the handful of times I've done this myself:   If you continue to use a small probe that docks with your main craft again then make sure it docks to the front of your craft (back is fine too assuming you have radial engines that aren't in a position to burn whatever gets hooked up back there) so the additional weight is added along your center line. When you're grabbing the object, pay close attention to your alignment to it. For a cupola approach from either the bottom or the top, and try to grab it dead center with your probe/ship on the same alignment as the part itself. This should minimize how much the center of mass is shifted from your thrust vector. After you've grabbed your target, throttle up very slowly for burns until you find the point at which your SAS can't overcome the torque from your thrust vector and CoM being out of alignment. Adding extra SAS to your craft ahead of time will increase this threshold. If the amount of throttle you can use is significantly less than normal then don't forget to account for this in timing your burns! You probably want to use two craft for this, one for the retrieval and return to LKO, another for reentry. Set the reentry craft up with lots of fuel reserves so it can do a powered reentry that keeps you below speeds where critical heating is a concern.   Edit: One more thing I forgot for when you're making the initial capture - if you don't get the alignment right on the first grab and have to release it again, or accidentally bump your target so that it starts rotating, remember that you can briefly engage time warp to arrest the rotation of everything nearby. Some may view that as a bit of a cheat (exploiting game mechanics) but your only other option is to have two grabbers equipped with SAS and let one grab on with poor alignment and arrest rotation."
KerbalAcademy,3copep,RumAndCookies,3,Thu Jul 9 16:11:58 2015 UTC,"After you've grabbed your target, throttle up very slowly for burns until you find the point at which your SAS can't overcome the torque from your thrust vector and CoM being out of alignment.    This is a key point that also applies when you're flying any unbalanced ship; there's always going to be an amount of thrust that under which, your ship can maintain control, and over which, you will slowly drift off course. For your ship to be unable to fly straight at any amount of acceleration will probably require larger misalignments than part recovery contracts will ever present you.."

This will keep your rocket stable as it comes through the atmosphere.  When you're in space the fins have no air to push against, so you need reaction wheels or RCS to rotate your craft. Most command pods have a small reaction wheel fitted but it's not usually enough to rotate the ship on its own if the craft is large, so you need to fit either more reaction wheels or an RCS system consisting of monopropellant tanks and thruster blocks. Then RCS is activated by hitting R.  Oh and make sure your SAS is turned on during launch by hitting T. A little light should come on next to the navball. This will try and keep the ship pointing in the same direction using fins or reaction wheels during launch."

From LKO I set the SAS to hold prograde, throttled up the engine, and watched TV while the craft steadily spiralled outwards, eventually securing a Mun intercept.  More recently I did a Moho mission with ions and had to deal with some pretty low thrusts, around 0.05 Kerbin TWR. That though was enough that many though not all manoeuvres were handled in an essentially normal fashion, just with a bit of waiting.  Thrusting all the way, like Dawn did, isn't going to be feasible in KSP for journeys to anywhere beyond the Mun, the ions actually do have too high a TWR for that on an interplanetary trip unless you're pushing an insanely large craft and the physics warp limits bite too."

KerbalAcademy,3cm9t2,fullmoan,9,Thu Jul 9 04:06:18 2015 UTC,"Eli5 coming up  Orbits are all ellipses. (Circles are a special case of an ellipse.) Without going into too much geometry, an ellipse is a shape where the sum of the distance from two points (the foci) is always the same, no matter where on the ellipse you are. In all orbits, the planet or mass you are orbiting lies at one of the foci. An eccentric orbit is a really stretched ellipse. Eccentricity values range from 0 to more than one, where 0 is a perfect circle, 0-1 (but not including one) are ellipses, 1 is a parabola, and values more than one are hyperbolas. When you have an eccentricity that is less than one, you are in orbit. Eccentricity values closer to one mean that it gets really stretched. When your eccentricity value is one exactly (super rare) it means that you are traveling at the exact velocity needed to escape the object you are near (escape meaning fly away from forever. Using some physics you can figure out the exact number it is). If your eccentricity value is greater than one, you are on what is called a hyperbolic excape trajectory, which follows the shape of a hyperbola. You will escape this object, but the important distinction between this and a parabolic trajectory is that you have more than the escape velocity at any point.   Now we have covered the three types of orbits. Let's talk about planes!  Planes are basically a flat geometrical shape, like a piece of paper, that extends to infinity. Every part of your orbit is going to be on the same plane, which means that you could take (an infinite) piece of paper, and draw your orbit on it, and your orbit would always be on that paper, in two dimensions. You would follow that course exactly. Not everything is on the same plane though, so we need to visualize another piece of paper that goes through your piece and up.   http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/eduoff/vt-2004/mt-2003/mt-2003-orbit-normal.jpg  This shows it pretty well, with earth and mercury.   The points on your orbit where your planes cross are important. They are where you burn, in the purple triangles ( normal or antinormal) to change your plane. These maneuvers are really expensive (in gas) to do, so you want to do them when you are going slowest, or when you are at the highest point in your orbit. If it is coplanar, it means that you are orbiting on the same plane as the object. Earth and mercury are not coplanar. The difference becomes really important when going to moho or eeloo.   The oberth effect is a neat effect that basically means that it's more effective to change your velocity when you are going fast. I won't go into too much detail, but since you square your velocity to get kinetic energy, when you do an increase in velocity of a smaller number you won't get as big a change in kinetic energy as when you do the same speed change while going faster. What this practically means is that the best place to male big changes to your orbit is as the periapsis, when you are going fastest. This isn't the same with plane changes, since you want to do those while going slowest.   When returnin from the mun, ( and when time is no object), assuming that you're starting from orbit, you can wait until your orbit lines up so that your periapsis is in front of the mun in its orbit. Then you just burn at your periapsis until you escape, and keep burning until your kerbin periapsis ( it'll show up in a different color) is deep within kerbin's atmosphere. Then just hope you packed enough parachutes and heat shields!  How much math and physics have you taken? I can walk you through many parts of orbital stuff if you want."

You'll be able to follow strangely in-depth conversations about orbits. In short: Oberth effect means that you want and forwards/backwards (prograd/retrograde) burns to be at the fastest possible speed. This always means you want to be the closest to the planet/moon possible because it makes it way more efficient. Apsides are the points closest and farthest away from the orbital body. Apoapsis is the point furthest away and where you're the slowest, periapsis is the point closest and fastest to the body."

As long as OP ...I mean OP's friend planned ahead enough to put a docking port on the mobile station.  Try two docking ports sandwiched around a probe core, a reaction wheel, and a small RCS tank.  Strap on some wheels, some solar panels, and the missing antenna.  Use the O-10 motors for landing.  Use 4 of them to get good stability, but know the craft will be overpowered.  Those are the motors that control off the main throttle though, so there should be a good chance of driving away from the landing.  RCS thrusters probably wont be necessary, the small reaction wheel has plenty of torque for something that size.  Or you could omit the reaction wheel and add thrusters to save weight.  This thing's going to be pretty light anyway and the reaction wheel never runs out of fuel, but its your choice.  It might help to mock this up at KSC to make sure the lander can actually dock with the station.  Edit: A lander like this could easily take off also.  You could try adding a small lander can instead of or in addition to the probe core, and you'd get something that a Kerbal could easily leave the station in."

It's this altitude so you can not worry about hitting terrain at all, and so that you have plenty of wiggle room for landing. Make sure you have a claw on it, and landing legs so you can do a short hop to get closer. No roving today! Set your navball to surface and zero your velocity. Coast down, and try to land as close as you can. This should get you within a kilometer or two.   Make sure you packed the linear RCS thrusters for translating over the surface. It should be possible to do short hops with the engine ( emphasis on short. Turn down your max thrust. You don't need much.), and then translate to it. You can now get ready to attach. By the way, your claw should be on top. It should be simple, and in total should weigh 2 tons max. SAS is a must. Once you are all ready to attach and really close, f5. You don't want to start from orbit again if you screw up. Do a short hop (10 m) and line up with RCS. Flip over and coast to a bit of a jolt once you land. You may want to include RCS 4 directional thrusters to do this, as it will be simpler, but it's not necessary. You can do a softer landing with those however.

I'm not sure how that would translate out to having 2/3 of your lander's fuel left when you arrive on Kerbin unless you aerobraked on the way back, so I think there's more to this than just that one odd number.

The wiki has Minmus' orbital velocity at 274 m/s so a return from a minmus escape trajectory would only be 274 m/s max, not ~1200. (Assuming you aerocaptured from your Minmus-Kerbin elliptical orbit).

Everything from de-orbit is wrong because you don't have to do that stuff to get back. You need something under 300 dv from a normal Minmus orbit to get back to Kerbin.  You get back to Kerbin from a normal Minmus orbit by burning more or less retrograde to the direction Minmus is going around Kerbol, which is counter-clockwise if you view the system with north at the top of your screen and south at the bottom.  Make a maneuver node and fiddle with it until your Kerbin periapsis is right. If you have no heat shield, a ""naked"" capsule will survive if you come in at 37+K meters.

It's listed as 355 m/s to return from minmus to Kerbin, and 5500 should be very much more than enough.  You certainly don't need a monstrosity.  A T-200 and terrier engine should get you from after the transfer burn to the circularization, landing, orbit and return easily."

KerbalAcademy,3cj3g5,Wetmelon,2,Wed Jul 8 17:39:12 2015 UTC,It does not. KSPTOT assumes the same orbital mechanics that KSP uses (two body motion).  Sorry about that. :-)

KerbalAcademy,3cj3g5,Desembler,5,Wed Jul 8 23:46:19 2015 UTC,which is exactly what has happened over the long term. fewer people use MechJeb for the autopilot and more for the informational readouts because flying is the fun bit :D

KerbalAcademy,3cj3g5,rootnegative,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:43:30 2015 UTC,"I guess it's hard to say where you might've went wrong without pictures or hard numbers, but here's how I visualize that going:   Just barely leave Eve's SOI, as you did On the opposite end of your next closest encounter (on your first orbit, since you're going to very slowly drift apart), plot a burn to pass eve with a very low periapsis on the side opposite the sun (since you want to enlarge your orbit - i.e. notice how you always burn on the dark side of a planet when going to an outer planet) - this should be your typical CCW/0-degree orbit Now you'll have to dick around a bit to get another close encounter since your orbital periods are off, but you can be patient and wait multiple years in order to minimize the amount of course correction you have to do.  But basically, once you get a close encounter, adjust it (again, from the other side of the orbit), and repeat 2-3 for awhile.   If you end up close to Kerbin, one thing you could try is messing around with nodes there such that you get another encounter with Eve in a more elliptical orbit - basically, use Kerbin to slow you down so that you hit Eve with a higher speed, and thus get a larger subsequent boost.  But as others have said, we just don't have the tools required to do this effectively.  You're also going to have problems timing all this so you actually encounter Jool when you get up to its orbit.  Though this, too, can be solved with lots of patience and some course adjustments.  If you want to practice on a smaller scale, you could use the Jool system and move between moons.  One of my favorite maneuvers is to start in low Jool orbit and use a Tylo assist to boost me up to the height (and more importantly, inclination) of Bop or Pol."
KerbalAcademy,3cj3g5,fibonatic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the lack of pictures, I didn't have them when I posted the question, I understand that they would help. I did pretty much as you described it, but sometimes the gain was a bit too low to make real difference. Maybe I should've dropped my periapsis deeper inside Eve's orbit to get more energy from a flyby, dunno.  As for encountering Jool, as I said, when I set up one of the Eve flybys I saw Jool at a good phase angle, and basically said ""screw this"" and burned for about 800m/s as I flew by Eve to get an encounter with Jool. That encounter originally should have boosted my apoapsis just below Dres orbit.  And yeah, for Joolian system I also used assists. Beause of Tylo assist I only needed 44 m/s to get captured at Jool, which really helped me."
KerbalAcademy,3cj3g5,ReliablyFinicky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:00:05 2015 UTC,"The only reason I can think of to not make your periapsis as low as possible is so that your resulting Sun orbital period is aligned with Eve such that you can get another predictable encounter (e.g. 1.5 times longer or something) or so that you boost up to Kerbin's orbit.  But it sounds like you know what you're doing and just need to try it out some more, so report back if you get it to work as expected!"

KerbalAcademy,3ckpvb,chordnine,2,Wed Jul 8 20:29:08 2015 UTC,nice troubleshooting!
KerbalAcademy,3ckpvb,rickyharline,2,Wed Jul 8 20:44:22 2015 UTC,"You should note that if you have a multi core CPU than maxing out the one core will not show 100% on task manager. So if you have four cores and one core is being maxed out and the others are idle than it will only show 25% CPU usage.     Edit:  facepalm I am dumb, these are linux commands. Works pretty great on linux, please ignore, Windows users!   Other than going through your active processes and seeing what you can disable, one thing you might be able to do is to force KSP to run on a different core with a simple shell script. This allows your OS to be busy on one core and KSP to work on another. This thread talks about setting it up for 64 bit, but all you need to do to get it to work with 32 bit is to remove the _64 from the KSP.x86_64 or replace it with just KSP. This is just the executable in your Kerbal Space Program folder. So if you have multiple cores and you can do this, than for NVIDIA GPUs it would be:    #!/bin/sh  export LC_ALL=C  export LD_PRELOAD=""libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1"" export __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 exec taskset -c 2-3 ./KSP.x86   Or for non NVIDIA:     #!/bin/sh  export LC_ALL=C exec taskset -c 2-3 ./KSP.x86     Save your file as a .sh in notepad or whatever. The way it's currently set up is so that it has to be placed in your Kerbal Space Program folder so you could create a shortcut to it or you could use an absolute URL like: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program\KSP.x86 instead of ./KSP.x86 and have the script located wherever. Then launch the game from the script and see if that makes a difference."
KerbalAcademy,3ckpvb,rickyharline,2,Wed Jul 8 18:11:58 2015 UTC,Well I figured it out. See my post above. Thank you for the suggestion. I might look into this any how and move KSP on to its own core.  Thanks for the tips!
KerbalAcademy,3ckbx5,gerg_1234,3,Wed Jul 8 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"I've not tried it yet in 1.0.4, but here are some thoughts.  You'll want a design that is aerodynamically stable in one direction for the descent, and in the other direction for ascent.  A while ago I used this design in an effort to do just that.  I moved lots of fuel from the ascent vehicle into the lander base for descent and then pumped it back into the ship right before launch.  This kept it stable during descent.  Maybe this can give you some ideas.  Caveat: that design is old (0.24.2), but worked pretty well with FAR.  I didn't have DRE installed either."
KerbalAcademy,3ckbx5,AIM_9X,2,Wed Jul 8 19:48:48 2015 UTC,That is BRILLIANT! Thanks. I'll play with that a bit.
KerbalAcademy,3ckbx5,jofwu,2,Wed Jul 8 20:13:41 2015 UTC,"I've never done it, but here's my two cents: lots of struts, lots of heat shields, enough fuel to capture in a low Eve orbit without aerobraking, lots of parachutes (including lots of drogue chutes) opening at many altitudes, more fuel to help slow the descent?"
KerbalAcademy,3ckbx5,RumAndCookies,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I see a lot about how ""less delta V to get off Eve...they made it easier.""  In the old days you could just use brute force to get off Eve.....I think 1.0.4 has made things 1000x more difficult."
KerbalAcademy,3ckbx5,MrBorogove,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to send a craft that can then leave Eve again, you're probably going to need to go with extra fuel to slow it down a lot as it enters the atmosphere. With how brutally thick Eve's atmosphere is the only things that are going to have much luck surviving an uncontrolled entry are going to be teardrop-shaped or cylindrical craft with a nice big heatshield on the bottom, which doesn't lend itself particularly well to the design of a craft that can then escape that same atmosphere. You could try doing something clever with fairings and a stack separator to keep a slightly less-resilient craft and/or one with a central engine protected until the worst of the entry is over though.  The one mercy is that once you've reached the lower atmosphere intact you don't need quite so many parachutes as you'd need to land the same craft on Kerbin. I'd actually recommend setting up the parachutes in several stages so you can deploy incrementally until you find the sweet spot; with such a thick atmosphere it's easy to overdo it and end up with the long wait of a 1.8m/s descent through the last few km of atmosphere..."
KerbalAcademy,3ckbx5,TMarkos,2,Wed Jul 8 17:38:50 2015 UTC,Airbrakes are fantastic for slowing and stabilizing atmospheric entry to Kerbin; I bet they're doubly so for Eve.
KerbalAcademy,3ckbx5,Perseus33,3,Wed Jul 8 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"Came here to suggest this.  I did the weekly challenge with 16 airbrakes on the back of a craft that resembled nothing so much as a cube, it was rock solid with no RCS input.    Design pics and reentry shots: https://imgur.com/a/vSV3l/#0  Engines work well to absorb heat, I slapped heat shields on where I could but honestly had very little trouble.  The other piece of advice I would give you is to get your periapsis to about 75km and then retro-burn gradually so your periapsis is always about 30 seconds away from you.  This gives you a gradual descent profile that will bleed off a lot of speed before you really get into the crappy lower atmosphere.  Eve really thickens up below 70km, you do not want to be going much over 2km/s at that altitude."
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,ulikel,6,Wed Jul 8 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"You don't HAVE to do this returning from the Mun or Minmus, but I find it helpful (and sometimes do it accidentally!).  My first pass will be very elliptical with a PE of maybe 45K and an AP of 900K.  As I pass through the atmosphere, there is drag as I go from from ~70K down to 45K and back up to ~70K.  Dramatic flaming graphics, but no  serious heating, since the air is so thin.  Whatever heating does occur will dissipate while I loop back through space to my AP and back again.   Given my slower speed, my AP is down to around 700K.  That means I'm going slightly slower when I next hit the atmosphere.  My PE won't have changed much, but that's okay (in fact, it's good, because I want to stay in thin air until I'm much slower).  The atmospheric drag on my next pass will bring my AP down to, say, 300K.   Again, I'm slower when I next loop around to hit the atmosphere, slower yet when I exit it, so my AP comes down again.  It might be 100K when I next hit the atmosphere and I'm now going about 2500m/s rather than the 3300+ m/s when I started.    This time through the atmosphere, drag starts to bring my speed down to where my AP is under 70K and I'm going below escape velocity (~2200K).   Since I'm not leaving the atmosphere, I'll keep experiencing drag.  As I slow even further, my PE starts to decrease and I sink further into the atmosphere.  But, by the time I get to thick enough air to really damage the ship through heating, I've been slowed down enough by drag in the thinner air that it's not a threat.  Somewhere around 14K I slow enough that the flaming graphics go away and am going slow enough to release parachutes at a sufficient height (5 - 10 K typically, depending on the mass of the ship).  I know this isn't very efficient and probably represents an extreme case, but it has the advantage of almost always working, even with reasonably massive ships adorned with ""dangly science bits"".  Just be sure to keep your heat shield facing prograde (i.e. the ship facing retrograde) while in the atmosphere. That's all you have to do -- physics will do the rest.  Actually, this approach is so gradual that I've brought ships home safely even without a heatshield (""Did you remember to pack it?"", ""No, I thought you did..."").   You can get a similar effect with fewer passes and less snickering from experienced Kerbanauts by setting your initial PE lower.  Good luck!"
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,ghoetker,3,Wed Jul 8 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"I often heard people say things like ""I had to do 5 passes before I could safely re-enter"". What does this mean?   They had a periapsis less than 70km for 5 orbits and it gradually reduced their orbital speed to a point that they were comfortable de-orbiting. Or possibly, that it took 5 orbits for atmospheric drag to pull them into re-entry.   And let's say I'm coming back from the Mun should I have to do this?   Nope. The trick to reentry is basically the same as real life. You need to hit a range for your Pe that is deep enough into the atmo that it stops you but not so deep that you burn up.  Around 35km is pretty good i've found.  Pack a heat shield though. Things get a wee bit toasty when you hit atmo going mach 7."
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,rootnegative,2,Wed Jul 8 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"It's especially important if they have the Deadly Reentry mod installed, where if they go through the atmosphere too quickly and too steeply they'll burn up their ship.   Instead, they would choose to gradually slow down over time rather than doing it all at once.  But, if you're coming from the Mun and have an optimal orbit, you shouldn't have to do that."
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,chordnine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:25:19 2015 UTC,you can pull it without a shield but need to be much higher up (takes more passes cause it doesnt brake as much per pass) usually 45-50km works for this.
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,snakejawz,3,Wed Jul 8 23:21:47 2015 UTC,"The technique saves some Dv.  Basically, when you are heading back to Kerbin, you will have a widely elliptical orbit typically, maybe a Apoapsis of a 500km.  So you take your periapsis down to like 70km and then when near the periapsis you would fire retrograde to lower your apopasis, right?  Now normally, with unlimited fuel, what you would do is, lower your orbital speed and therefore your apoapsis, by thrusting retrograde and thats fine.  But fuel is not unlimited.  So, what you do is use Kerbins atmosphere, which begins at somewhere around 69.5 km to slow our orbital speed.  The introduction of atmosphere, will slowly add drag to your vehicle.  So if you periapsis is 60km, and your apoapsis is 500km, each orbit will knock your apoapsis down as you skim the atmosphere of kerbin using the atmospheric drag.  Now at 60km, this would take like 200 orbits (i made that number up, but its a lot).  But you will see that you can go down to about 35-40k without incurring to much heat damage.  Heat damage is the thing your need to worry about while aerobraking.  As long as the ship is not overheating during the aerobrake, you can just keep repeating the process until your apoapsis is very low, and therefore your orbital speed is very low, and now you can re-enter kerbin with less over heating issues as you will hit the thicker part of the atmosphere going slower."
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,HODOR00,2,Wed Jul 8 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"great explanation. I always think of aerobraking as free stopping power, as long as you don't get greedy."
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,BeetlecatOne,2,Wed Jul 8 18:20:54 2015 UTC,"They are putting their periapsis below 70km (into the atmosphere), but high enough that they still come back out. If you have a 60km periapsis coming back from the Mun for example, it's going to take a few times around before the atmosphere slows you down enough to bring you to the ground.  You shouldn't have to do multiple passes when coming back from the Mun, so long as you have a heatshield. Unless you have sensitive parts on he sides of the craft.  That said, it can't hurt."
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,jofwu,3,Wed Jul 8 15:46:11 2015 UTC,so long as you have a heatshield   You can (probably) manage without a heatshield if you can keep your engine pointed forwards (and aren't going too fast on re-entry); engines don't mind getting a bit hot.  Fitting a radiator somewhere on your craft will help stop delicate parts from overheating.
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,Ebirah,2,Wed Jul 8 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"As with all things KSP, it comes down to Δv.  (Delta-V or the ability you have to change your velocity.)    If you have tons of Δv, you can actually come to a stop (zero orbital speed) and drift/fall straight down into Kerbin's atmo.  (I've done this to test landers before).  This results in the lest amount of heat generated.    On the other hand, if I am almost completely out of fuel, I will plot a re-entry orbit that JUST grazes below the 70km limit (make sure it's an orbit and not a hyperbolic that will sling me back out into space).  From there it's just a matter of letting the air grab you each pass, slowing you down a little further and eventually pulling you into re-entry.    Try not to have anything external to your re-entry capsule other than parachutes or the high-temp solar panels.  You can take science from any device that generates it and store it in the capsule.  Having a heat shield can help for the long-fast re-entry profiles."

I don't know what situation could ever result in a ship with 0 orbital speed falling straight towards a planet - other than doing so completely intentionally (and I don't know why you would do that for any reason other than you wanted to see what would happen). The most dangerous part is re-entry into atmosphere. When you're testing for that, you want to simulate a more difficult environment than what you're expecting to face, not an easier environment. That means more heat and orbital speed, not less. I might suggest some destructive testing ;)"
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,ReliablyFinicky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"why you would do that for any reason other than you wanted to see what would happen   Hey! someone else who understands the fun of a videogame! (and I was testing the lander's ability to survive different impact velocities, completely independent of atmospheric considerations.)   I might suggest some destructive testing     I've clipped Jool's atmo at +10km/s.  That's about as destructive as I can get."
KerbalAcademy,3ck3ep,Jaffiss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"When you come back from the Mun you'll normally try to adjust your trajectory so you skim through Kerbin's atmosophere to slow down.  When you are in space you can see the eventual Kerbin periapsis. If there is no periapsis, and the trajectory line goes straight through Kerbin, you are going to explode probably.  If your periapsis is about 70k, you're not going to slow down at all, and will go right back to the Mun, or where the Mun was at least.  if your periapsis is maybe 34-36k -- the lower range could be wider, I don't know -- you'll enter Kerbin's atmosphere, stay there, and eventually land without exploding.  If your periapsis is under 30k, good luck. You can deorbit from Kerbin orbit with that, but coming back from the Mun you're going a lot faster.  If yuor periapsis is 40k+ but under 70k or so, you're going to go through Kerbin's atmosphere and out the other side. You'll spend an orbit in space and com back again. Since your orbit is smaller, since you scrubbed off some speed going through the atmosphere, you'll come back more slowly next time, and will probably stay in the atmosphere.  I don't know what happens in real life. I remember hearing that the early orbital flights were scary because they didn't want to ""skip into space"".  But in KSP this usually just means that you go around again."

Almost every system on Apollo had a backup or a workaround or an abort option if it failed. The ascent engine on the Apollo LM (lander) was one of the few exceptions; if it didn't fire, 2 crew would be stuck on the moon. They couldn't give it a real backup due to weight limitations, so they instead made it dirt-simple and reliable.   In low Earth orbit, your ship is either a few hours away from landing or it's really, really stuck, so there's not much point in keeping twice the expected consumables like food, air, and water around.   Similarly, on the Apollo missions, there was never a situation where there was a realistic possibility that the mission would take longer than a week, and most serious problems would shorten the mission, not lengthen it -- if they couldn't do the trans-lunar injection, they'd come home immediately; if they couldn't do the lunar orbit insertion, they'd come home two days early; if they couldn't get the lander to a Go state, they'd come home one day early.  They carried a little extra fuel in case they had to do more course correction than expected (a small leak could push the ship off course without being immediately life-threatening, for example), but probably like a 10% margin, not twice the fuel. The lander probably carried a bit more than that, particularly for descent, since there was the possibility they'd have to hover looking for a good landing site."

Most things are at least 2 fault tolerance, but some of the much harder to repair/replace units are single fault tolerance and are overengineered like crazy. Idk the exact numbers, for short trips, like to the moon, they usually won't bring much extra food, because worst case scenario, they'll only be delayed a day or so in a return trajectory to Earth, and they can easily survive a day without food. A lot of their air(oxygen at least) is generated by hydrolysis, so you mostly need to bring water, which a lot of water is generated in power creation. So it's a neat little cycle, so unless there is a massive failure where all of their water is evaporated in depressurization, or they lose their ability to produce power/water/oxygen, they're relatively safe on life support as long as they can scrub enough co2."

My last manned Duna mission had 50% more life support stores plus recyclers. Fuel was about 50% extra as well.
KerbalAcademy,3ch0d4,ghoetker,8,Tue Jul 7 21:03:29 2015 UTC,"On the first question, the thing to remember is that a transfer is actually two burns.  One to get into a transfer orbit, and one to go from the transfer orbit to an orbit of the target body, the Mun in this case.  It takes the same amount of delta-v to to from a transfer orbit to Mun orbit as it does to go from a Mun orbit to a transfer orbit, and assuming no aerobraking, the same is also true at the other end.  For the second question, aerobraking is an alternate source of deceleration, so you can get at least some of the needed deceleration from aerobraking rather than from the reaction mass of the craft.  Since the amount of acceleration for both legs of the trip are the same baring aerobraking, then the leg that can take advantage of aerobraking will use less reaction mass based delta-v.  As for the proportion, in the case of a Mun return, it's quite substantial, since the transfer orbit to Kerbin orbit burn takes over three times as much delta-v as the Mun orbit to transfer orbit burn takes."
KerbalAcademy,3ch0d4,Eric_S,5,Tue Jul 7 21:23:20 2015 UTC,"Your second bullet point is the key to the question.   It does take the same amount coming as going. Think about it simply... If you jump upward from the ground at 10 m/s, you go up, come to a stop, fall back down, and hit the ground at what speed? 10 m/s. Make sense?   The difference is that you had to use your muscles to accelerate upward, while landing was mostly a matter of letting the ground stop you.   There's one way to add energy to your ship- with fuel and an engine (like using your leg muscles to jump). There are a three main ways to lose energy. One is with the engine, pointed retrograde. The second is aerodynamic drag (aerobraking). The third is by hitting the ground (not ideal unless you're moving relatively slowly).   Landing on the Mun from a low orbit theoretically takes just as much delta-v as launching from the ground into that orbit. One requires an engine pointed prograde, the other requires an engine pointed retrograde.   So what about a trip from Kerbin to the Mun and back? Going requires an engine for all of the delta-v. But on your way back, much of the delta-v change comes from aerobraking."
KerbalAcademy,3ch0d4,jofwu,2,Wed Jul 8 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"My understanding, and this might be wrong, is that in orbit about the Mun, you're already in orbit around Kerbin. That is - you're already falling towards Kerbin, all the time.  In the same way that going from a 100 km orbit around Kerbin to a 200 km orbit takes X dV, and going back to 100 km takes the same X dV (just retrograde), going from Kerbin Orbit to Mun Orbit takes the same as Mun to Kerbin.  This isn't because you're escaping the Mun, but because you're adjusting your Kerbin periapsis to be lower than the Mun's orbit. The ""escaping the Mun's gravity"" part is pretty much a side effect of that.  Not sure if that's wholly accurate, but it's how I think of it."
KerbalAcademy,3ch0d4,shakefu,5,Tue Jul 7 23:54:21 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that's how it works.  Essentially all you need to go from Munar orbit to Kerbin orbit is a Munar escape velocity.  Once you reach that you achieve kerbin ""orbit"".  However, going from a kerbin orbit to Munar interaction to successful Munar braking is an entirely different beast"
KerbalAcademy,3ch0d4,thee_jaay,2,Wed Jul 8 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the Mun is within Kerbin SOI, any point outside of the Mun SOI will also be within Kerbin SOI, therefore you only need to escape the Mun to get back to orbiting Kerbin. You only need to raise your apoapsis beyond the ~2400km that is the Mun SOI, contrary to the ~11000 km that you need to get from low Kerbin orbit to the Mun Orbit.  Now getting from the Mun back to the orbit you had before or another LKO it's another thing and will take more dV, which is, I think, the value that dV charts consider.  Edit: As for your second point, I think that aerobraking is just an option and you could perfectly not go through the trouble and use some more fuel. Also dV charts are just a reference and not an absolute, so if you want to aerobrake that's up to you. But burning fuel and breaking with your engines is the most direct approach and also the less favorable scenario, which I find reasonable to use when making those charts."
KerbalAcademy,3ch0d4,Azaziel514,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"I will ignore the atmosphere for now. In this case you can say that gravity is time reversible. For example,  x(t0+dt) = x0 + v0 dt + 1/2 a dt2  If you or reverse the time step you get,  x(t0-dt) = x0 - v0 dt + 1/2 a dt2  So if you would invert your velocity you would go back the same way you came. So it would require the same changes in velocity in both directions.  If you use the atmosphere to slow you down for you, you still need the same changes in velocity, but now you have to have to burn less fuel to achieve this."
KerbalAcademy,3cg5ay,phantomlegion86,10,Tue Jul 7 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"Imagine a city block in your head, and you're standing still on the top left corner (orbit) . The bottom right corner is where you're headed (landed). The long sideways street is called ""killing your horizontal velocity Avenue"" and the short vertical side is ""you're going to acquire vertical velocity on the way down, better kill that too Lane"".  To get from one to the other safely, you need to walk the 20km down (from orbit to surface), and you need to walk the 550m/s (from orbital speed to stationary). The order of operations doesn't matter at all, the only thing that matters, weirdly, is the direction you take your final step (as long as you hit the ground perfectly vertically).  Pretend you're moving at 10m/s over the surface of Kerbin, you're 10 meters over the ground (also, the atmosphere is temporarily gone), and your rocket accelerates at 10m/s. If you wanted to ""walk the edges of the rectangle"", you would fire 1 second horizontally, and (because Kerbin matches Earth's 9.8m/s gravitational constant), you would fire 1 second vertically. Cancelling that movement would cost you ~20m/s ∆v.  If you instead fired your engine at a 45 degree angle, though, you could cancel both velocities with a single burn of 1.41 seconds (or ~14.1 m/s).  The most efficient way to land, on bodies without an atmosphere:   Fire your rocket retrograde only until your periapsis is below the surface. For best efficiency, time your burn when you're directly opposite where you want to land. Figure out how fast you'll be going at the moment of impact. You can do this with a maneuvre node -- make a new maneuvre node on your current trajectory (the one that intercepts the surface), drag it to the very end of your trajectory (where you impact), and drag the retrograde vector as far as you can. Figure out how long it will take your ship to change speed by that much. MechJeb's Vessel Info has this (max acceleration). It's simple division -- if your impact is 300m/s, and your ship provides 20m/s acceleration, it's a (300 / 20) 15 second burn. Fire your rockets retrograde X+N seconds before impact, where X is the answer to the previous question, and N is how ballsy you're feeling, on an inverted scale of 0-10 (0 = no fucks given, 1.5-3 = normal once comfortable, 10 = better make sure we land this one, the boss is watching).   From there, you can add in as much buffer as you want. Killing your horizontal velocity higher up makes it easier to land exactly where you want, but introduces larger losses to gravity. Killing your vertical velocity lower is more efficient (going lower on the ballsy scale), but there's a reason they're called suicide burns.  (edit: I don't presume that you needed this much help, but maybe this helps someone else reading it, and maybe someone who knows more than I do will further my understanding and/or correct me if I'm wrong)"

KerbalAcademy,3cg5ay,Konisforce,3,Tue Jul 7 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"well, 580 m/s is an estimate, and probably one that involves a fairly efficient descent strategy.  There are many different ways to descend to a planet, for example, simply retro burning until you have zero surface velocity and then just falling, will also require you to use more Dv to slow your landing.  Right?  I believe the most efficient decent strategy is similar to what they did on the actual Moon landing, where they came in almost on an angle to the ground making last minute adjustments to straighten out.  In KSP suicide burning, which is not easy at all to do, would be highly efficient.  This is where you slow your surface velocity and let the ship fall to the ground on an angle and blast your engines at the precise time so that your vertical velocity is around 0 m/s right as you touch the ground.    For a newb. I say this, give yourself a lot of cushion.  You are very unlikely to match the Dv the Dv maps say you need.  Likely you will need more.  And until you have gotten the hang of it.  I recommend giving yourself as much extra Dv as you can afford.  Once you have done it successfully a few times, it will be come easier, and you can try to better estimate your Dv needs."

KerbalAcademy,3cg5ay,FellKnight,2,Tue Jul 7 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, can you describe your descent? My guess is you are killing horizontal velocity while still too high up and that causes you to burn more fuel fighting gravity."

KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,tam0009,3,Tue Jul 7 08:53:23 2015 UTC,"I can't quite work out whether the gravity of the Mun is low enough to make an inclination change + standard Hohmann transfer more efficient or not, but I have a feeling it isn't.  But transferring from a polar orbit isn't so different. You need to burn prograde when you're on the side of the Mun furthest away from Minmus until your apo is at Minmus's orbit. Time this burn so that you're arriving at Minmus's orbit when it is also there and you'll get an encounter. This will be easiest near AN / DN, but inclination won't be as important as for a normal transfer, as you spend quite a while near Minmus's orbit."
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,number2301,2,Tue Jul 7 10:12:55 2015 UTC,"You kind of touch on it but I think it deserves to be explicitly said - you don't need to do an inclination change.  You can time your burn so that you get up to Minmus's height at the same time, and also put it at a location around the Mun such that you move your apoapsis into Minmus's path.  What I mean is, if you happen to by at an AN/DN with Minmus, then this burn would be at the equator.  But if Minmus happens to be at the bottom or top of its orbit when you want to intersect it, you can just burn from the Mun at the appropriate distance north or south of the equator.

KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,number2301,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"This. And even if you can't get exactly to Minmus with the initial burn, you can get relatively close and then do a correction burn when you're halfway there. The Map's projection of your intercept distance should show you how close you can get."
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,POGtastic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:26:46 2015 UTC,"Changing inclination is ridiculously expensive and should be avoided at all costs - you should ""embed"" all your inclination changes in your transfer burns or correction burns. When you burn normal/anti-normal, you aren't just changing your velocity -- you have to cancel your East/West velocity and add North/South velocity.  If you're going full bore -- a 90 degree plane change -- it's often always cheaper to do an extra burn; the ∆v required to increase/decrease your apoapsis is smaller than the amount of ∆v you save changing the vector of your velocity.  This guy has the math to back it up."
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,ReliablyFinicky,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, but at Minmus or Gilly for example, the cost of an inclination change becomes virtually inconsequential."
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,number2301,2,Tue Jul 7 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"Because of Minmus' inclination, you'd want to leave orbit when the Mun's position is at the ascending or descending node.  It looks like you want to burn when the Mun is 90° behind Minmus and when your craft is about 20° behind the Mun's prograde (pointing outward away from Kerbin). You can factor in the normal/anti-normal at the same time.  Try this planner: http://ksp.olex.biz/  [edit] Ignore this entire post, I didn't notice you were in a polar orbit. You can transfer straight to Minmus without changing your orbit, but getting an encounter may take a bit of trial and error."
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,CambleC,2,Tue Jul 7 10:35:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe there’s a better way, but this is what I’d do:  Wait until the plane of your orbit is parallel with the Mun’s prograde direction. Escape from the Mun in that direction, straight from your polar orbit. Leaving in the prograde direction will give you a Kerbin apoapsis higher up, which is what you want for Minmus. You’ll escape from the Mun with a bit of velocity that’s normal to Kerbin’s plane, because you’re coming from the polar orbit. But by the time you reach the Mun’s SOI it will be much less than it is in your low orbit. After you’re in Kerbin’s SOI it shouldn’t be hard to match inclinations with Minmus and do a transfer.  I’m sure there’s a more efficient way, which we can talk about if you want. But I think this would be a reasonable solution."
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,jofwu,2,Tue Jul 7 12:28:17 2015 UTC,"I tried to demonstrate it in a video to run through the simulation.  link  Basically, make the burn at the right time and you can do it in one.  Depending on the phase of both minmus and the mun, you may have to make a plane change as I demonstrate earlier in the video.  If you're willing to wait/get lucky and the planets are in the right alignment, you can make the transfer without a plane change.  If you have any questions, please ask!  EDIT: Just noticed you're in a polar orbit... That complicates things a little, but the entire theory is still sound. If you're tight on your approach, you can come in polar and it won't be too bad."
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,rootnegative,2,Tue Jul 7 13:05:19 2015 UTC,I'm pretty impressed you made that whole video to answer the question!
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,tarrosion,2,Tue Jul 7 14:55:16 2015 UTC,it seemed the easiest way of doing it :D
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,rootnegative,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"So this worked pretty well, but it raises a new question for me since I was more or less inline with mun prograde. What would happen if I was perpendicular to mun programs? Would the burn I made become more difficult?"
KerbalAcademy,3cemjo,rootnegative,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:02:09 2015 UTC,I'll answer the question I think you're asking :D  It would become more and more inefficient if your Polar orbit is at an angle to the prograde direction of the mun's orbit.
KerbalAcademy,3cexdi,Zero_Kredibility,3,Tue Jul 7 11:23:33 2015 UTC,"Well, the good news is the gravity is pretty weak, so you might be able to manage a steeper slope than you think.  I've never used it before, but SCANsat mod appears to fit your purpose. You'll need the Wide-band scanner, and you'll have to pass over the terrain before you make an attempt, but apparently the mod will overlay elevation/slope."
KerbalAcademy,3cexdi,rogueop,3,Tue Jul 7 12:02:31 2015 UTC,"Lower gravity doesn't change the center of mass. You will still fall over at same inclines, you will just fall slower.  (Unless you can be sure you have enough energy to power a sufficiently strong reaction wheel)"
KerbalAcademy,3cexdi,PageFault,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:04:57 2015 UTC,Yes. Even with minimal horizontal velocity it falls on the slightest slope. Bad design that I was aware of on launch but put into the 'worry about that later' pile.
KerbalAcademy,3cexdi,bigorangemachine,2,Tue Jul 7 18:16:51 2015 UTC,I hadn't considered that. I could send out a probe. Thanks.
KerbalAcademy,3cexdi,BosphorusScalene,2,Tue Jul 7 12:39:12 2015 UTC,Maybe trajectories does this? At least you can get the coordinates of where you are landing

KerbalAcademy,3cdmof,Jake_1208,2,Tue Jul 7 03:19:06 2015 UTC,"huh... That's an extremely good point. I haven't seen any kind of material based around landing weights and parachutes... I'd be interested to have a read of it, if you find it.  In terms of a solution, can you do a reference mission? That is, strap your lander full of ore to a launcher, send it suborbital and see what happens? This is what we call !science!."
KerbalAcademy,3cdmof,rootnegative,2,Tue Jul 7 11:58:27 2015 UTC,"I was wondering how a sub-orbital test result would compare to a Minmus return (starting out quite a bit faster), but the parachute part shouldn't make any real difference (I'd just need to make sure to come in shallow because it will take longer to slow down).  And right before coming up with a test mission, I re-read the contract and realized I only need to bring it back into Kerbin orbit..."

You got it :) The part of the reference mission you're wanting to test is performance under chutes.   The speed at which you can deploy the chutes is going to be the same, so you in effect can recreate it exactly as aerobraking will bring you to the same starting point.   And right before coming up with a test mission, I re-read the contract and realized I only need to bring it back into Kerbin orbit...   lol, points for reading the fine print."
KerbalAcademy,3cdmof,jofwu,2,Wed Jul 8 00:02:25 2015 UTC,RealChute does some similar calculations in-game. You input a desired landing speed and it adjusts some RealChute parachute parameters accordingly or gives you a warning.  I made a post in the RealChute forum about how this is done. If anybody is interested in following up on that and updating the calculator (or making a new one) then report back!
KerbalAcademy,3cdmof,ReliablyFinicky,2,Tue Jul 7 13:24:53 2015 UTC,Add a storage tank full of ore to your final stage and do some (destructive?) testing =)
KerbalAcademy,3cdmof,merv243,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"I've found it to be accurate enough, but I haven't used it on anything that size (a few tons max).  I think you can do your test mission (though I see you've determined it's no longer needed :D) and then compare with what the calculator says, and that will give you an idea of how far off it is (I'd assume the error would be scalable based on craft size, and equivalent for two equally-sized crafts, so if the speed is off by 5 m/s for a 10 ton craft, it'll always be off by 5 m/s and you can just use the tool to get the baseline)"
KerbalAcademy,3cdmof,bigorangemachine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:10:10 2015 UTC,I have msg'd the original developer of the chute calculator B4. I am sure if we show enough love he'd update it.

KerbalAcademy,3cb7ny,AIM_9X,4,Mon Jul 6 15:32:49 2015 UTC,I generally put the core in a service bay and then use adapters and nosecones to top it off.
KerbalAcademy,3cb7ny,CttCJim,4,Mon Jul 6 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"The probe core is likely exploding due to conducted heat from the parts it's attached to.  Putting something with good thermal mass in the stack would maybe help, but what you're really looking for is something with poor conductivity like a heat shield with the ablator removed."
KerbalAcademy,3cb7ny,TMarkos,3,Mon Jul 6 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"Good call - I hadn't considered isolating the probe like that.  Edit: I used a heat shield as a buffer, and it seemed to help.  I also adjusted my descent profile, and I managed to get into the lower atmosphere without blowing up.  (The probe did have a very full thermal bar, however) Unfortunately, upon hitting 'G' during final descent I realized that in my tweaking I somehow erased the aft landing gear..."
KerbalAcademy,3cb7ny,svarogteuse,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:42:17 2015 UTC,Had the same problem with certain probes. Will try the heat shield thing.
KerbalAcademy,3cb7ny,RA2lover,3,Mon Jul 6 20:26:38 2015 UTC,"you should use an insulator to keep thermally sensitive components from heating up, such as a cubic octagonal strut."
KerbalAcademy,3cb7ny,Ebirah,2,Mon Jul 6 22:45:30 2015 UTC,"It sounds ridiculous, but would static radiators inside the fairing help at all?   At the moment the behaviour of radiators seems to be a bit simplistic and magical, so quite possibly.  (My craft mostly fly with a small radiator in the service bay, which takes the edge off re-entry quite nicely. (The bay doors are opened during re-entry, but I do that because the extra drag seems to help with slowing down the craft rather than because I think the radiator needs exposure.))  A 1200 degree heat rating is pretty delicate, though."
KerbalAcademy,3cb7ny,ReliablyFinicky,2,Mon Jul 6 23:32:48 2015 UTC,"1200 degrees (if it's Kelvin; they measure it as ""K"" in the game, I haven't looked at how they measure temperature at all!) is 927 degrees Celcius, or 1700 degrees Farenheit.. That's about 267 degrees hotter than what you need to melt Aluminium, and it's only a handful of degrees before you start melting bronze (950 Celcius). Most common metals will fail completely at that temperature - for example, the yield strength of S355 Stainless Steel is 544 N/mm2. At 950 Celcius, it's about 2.5% of that -- 13.6N/mm2.  544N/mm2 is about 5% of what you need to form a diamond.  13.6N/mm2 is about what you get at the nozzle from a pressure washer.  Considering a probe core is essentially delicate electronics, and 1200 K is enough to cause a pressure washer to permanently deform stainless steel used in bridges, I think those are pretty rugged little units! ;)  Sorry, back to work now..."
KerbalAcademy,3cb7ny,VileTouch,2,Tue Jul 7 15:54:30 2015 UTC,"had this problem with a rather large fairing. unfortunately, you do need a nose cone inside the fairing, and even then, things will get very hot.

KerbalAcademy,3ccio1,PETC,2,Mon Jul 6 21:07:24 2015 UTC,Is your engine producing heat that you're not dissipating?  (I don't have much experience with modded parts)  Maybe try replacing those structural panels near the front with small radiators?
KerbalAcademy,3ccio1,bendvis,2,Mon Jul 6 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe? I tested it on the runway first without the engine or anything even attached to the front of the aircraft.

KerbalAcademy,3cb2pr,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:04:55 2015 UTC,"As long as no other part of the rover is colliding with the ground, having the wheels higher should be a good thing; that should be lowering the center of gravity which minimizes rolling, just like you see on ground-hugging sports cars.  How heavy is the rover? It's been a while, but I used to build some larger rovers using the Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank as the chasis just so the extra weight would reduce twitchiness and I could have a nice wide wheel base. It also meant they could do double-duty as surface fuel transports."

If you have any interest in creating such a mod then I would talk with the creator of that one. Seems like it shouldn't be too hard to make a plugin which adds markers at a ship's last location before it is removed.
KerbalAcademy,3c9ztk,jofwu,5,Mon Jul 6 11:57:22 2015 UTC,"Well, Minmus height goes up to 5 km I think so your guess is likely what happened.  Even if such mod existed, I wonder if it would show info previous to its installation, I don't know if that data is saved somewhere."
KerbalAcademy,3c9ztk,Azaziel514,5,Mon Jul 6 12:42:40 2015 UTC,It doesn't keep data but I had a look at the API and found a Vessel onDestroy. Maybe I will write a mod for that. http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/API:Vessel

KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,PM_ME_YOUR_JOHN_KEYS,8,Mon Jul 6 09:22:07 2015 UTC,"Your vessel isn't symmetric.    Look closely at image #2.  Your centers of mass (yellow ball) and lift (blue ball) are stacked vertically, but that is offset from your center of thrust (purple ball with arrow).  That explains the immediate POaD (pitch over and die) maneuver.  Double-check your construction and make sure that everything is properly symmetrical.  It's easy to accidentally screw up a symmetry mode.  The problem may also lie with the payload inside the fairing, since we can't see it.  Check the symmetry of just the top stage by detaching the rockety-bit temporarily, which should give you the upper-stage center-of-mass."
KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,Majromax,8,Mon Jul 6 13:09:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, the problem happens too early for this to be an aerodynamic issue.

KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,Majromax,2,Mon Jul 6 15:14:26 2015 UTC,"While there is definitely something wrong with the fuel flow, this looks like the main issue to me as well, as I don't think the fuel levels are sufficiently imbalanced to create that much of an issue this fast."
KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,Eric_S,4,Mon Jul 6 19:22:51 2015 UTC,"It's easy to accidentally screw up a symmetry mode.   Clarification for OP's sake:  If you place a decoupler in single symmetry and then place a booster on that in double symmetry, you could easily end up with a booster on each side of the decoupler, with one appearing normally on the outside and the other disappearing (clipped) inside the parent structure. The clipped booster would still produce thrust despite being inside of another tank, most likely off-center."
KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,space_is_hard,2,Mon Jul 6 15:17:49 2015 UTC,Clipping parts seems to have been the problem.

KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,Majromax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"I've encountered... difficulties when trying for symmetry on attached parts and a separate symmetry mode on the main body of the rocket.  Hovering over the attachment resets the symmetry mode to the one used for the attachment, and not noticing the change can lead me to attach the wrong number of parts.  This is particularly annoying when, for example, setting up 2-and-2 asparagus staging but wishing to attach fins with 4-way symmetry to the main fuel tank."
KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,space_is_hard,2,Mon Jul 6 15:20:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately that's one of the difficulties of programming something like KSP's symmetry system. It's difficult to know exactly what the user is trying to do, and it's especially difficult to get the parts to do it."

It's not aerodynamic issues, this happens much to quickly off the launch pad."
KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,SenorPuff,4,Mon Jul 6 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"My guess, too fat. Rockets should be long and skinny with pointy noses, weight at the top, fins at the back. You can add more fins to the bottom, but most rockets flipping over happen when the CoM is too low, CoL is too high, or both."
KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,jofwu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:28:03 2015 UTC,"So try shedding some of the stages on the sides and make the center stack taller.

KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,RoboRay,2,Mon Jul 6 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"Looks like a fuel line routing issue to me.  There needs to be one single path from each tank to each engine it feeds.  If there are cases where fuel from a tank can flow along multiple paths to a single engine, the flow logic goes into an infinite loop, times out, and leaves the flow imbalanced.  So, no loops, and no forks that will converge later."

KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,Balootwo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"Your TWR is kind of low, which could be exacerbating aerodynamic instability. If the payload is relatively light then you'll have center of mass issues. This can be overcome with sufficient thrust, but 1.3 TWR probably won't cut it for an imbalanced ship.  Needs more boosters.  ;)"
KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,jofwu,2,Mon Jul 6 11:56:39 2015 UTC,I never launch with much more than 1.3 TWR. Seems to me that the solution is to balance the ship better.
KerbalAcademy,3ca9bw,Balootwo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:41:21 2015 UTC,"Well you could balance the ship better, or you could add more thrust to compensate. You're probably right that better balance is technically better, but more thrust will work, and it will get you out of the souposphere quicker."

How do I make an efficient rocket that can actually transport the workshop?    Same rules as always, you just need to design it to loft a bigger payload. 4,200 dV to LKO. Ensure your TWRs are good (1.5 ish in atmo on the pad, 1.0 ish for the top stage). I've done a good series on how to do this if you're unsure of how to get the design right.   And what would I need to do to be able to make a full lander/orbiter combo to mine the moon, refine the ore, then come back to the orbiter to make rocket parts and ships? It seems like an awful lot of mass for a small rocket.   It is an awful lot of mass for a small rocket. That is why you generally see these kind of missions split up into discrete packets. One vehicle has one job. So for example, you have a skycrane that is responsible for landing stuff on the mun. Then you have a station that is responsible for storing the resources.  Generally, a mining ship that can de-orbit, land, mine and reorbit back to a station is a good plan. Do the refining in your orbiting storage station.   Also, can I just use vanilla mining parts for this stuff? can the refinery be used in place of the workshop?   Unsure. But the parts into a craft and then launch it. If it has the right options in the context menu, then you can!  My best advice would be to perhaps start with a stock mining operation around Minmus to understand how to design these missions and get them to work. EPL is much more advanced and will require greater planning abilities."
KerbalAcademy,3c8b80,rootnegative,2,Mon Jul 6 01:24:36 2015 UTC,"I know in 1.0.2, you could use the stock drill to harvest the ore, but any processing had to be done through an EL smelter (ore to metal) and workshop (metal to rocket parts). However, it's fairly easy to write a ModuleManager config to add the conversions to the stock ISRU if you really want.  Your best bet would be to set up a mining rig that stays down at the surface and refines it into at least metal, and use a lander that can either land on top of a docking port or be connected via KAS pipes. I'd advise keeping the creation of rocket parts on your construction yard so you also benefit from their increased productivity when you're building a ship.  EDIT: You may also want to have the mining rig process the stock ore for fuel to top off the lander."

KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,lirik7,11,Mon Jul 6 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely start with a retrograde orbit. The initial difference in dV between the two, from the start of transfer burn, can be counted on one hand.  If you've already for some reason captured into Munar orbit, however, it will take far more to change your orbit."
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,jansenart,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:48:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Will try it next time. Should I start from retrograde LKO, or simply capture at near side of the moon? I'd imagine launching to retrograde LKO is too expensive."
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,jansenart,4,Mon Jul 6 00:54:09 2015 UTC,"It's much better to launch with a 0deg inclination (due east, 90deg, on Kerbin's equator) since you get a small velocity boost from the rotation of Kerbin.  From there, I like MechJeb's Hohmann transfer module, and then I use the maneuver node editor to remove just a little bit of prograde burn, so I'd end up in front of the Mun instead of behind.  When you hit the periapsis of your Munar encounter, do a capture burn as normal. Just watch out for satellites and debris coming at you! :D"
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,jansenart,2,Mon Jul 6 00:57:42 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Thanks again. And that small boost is 350 delta v if I'm not mistaken.
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,jansenart,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:02:52 2015 UTC,":) That's about what I thought it was!  Going into a retrograde launch would then be a comparative 700 dV launch, actually!  EDIT: Also, you're welcome!"
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,FellKnight,2,Mon Jul 6 01:04:41 2015 UTC,"No, I've already doubled it. The rotational speed is 175ish, so getting on retrograde LKO should be 350 dV more expensive vs prograde one."
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,rootnegative,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:08:55 2015 UTC,There you go then.
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,jansenart,2,Mon Jul 6 01:25:40 2015 UTC,Absolutely correct.  The extra burn to put your periapsis 10km prograde to 10km retrograde is maybe 2-3 m/s from your initial LKO burn.  Very minor.
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,rootnegative,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:24:41 2015 UTC,"The initial difference in dV between the two, from the start of transfer burn, can be counted on one hand.   This is a great point. I'd be something on the order of 400ms less efficient once you're in orbit i'd guess."
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,krenshala,2,Mon Jul 6 00:55:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, more along the lines of 700! The rotation subtracts delta-V one way, and ADDs it the other."
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,rootnegative,2,Mon Jul 6 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"To do this, you just need to capture into an orbit around the ""other side"" of the moon.  On approach, if you're going to the right of the mun, you just need to make a course correction that takes you to the left. A radial burn should get this to work. Do this before you get to the Mun's SOI. It'll cost you ~20ms dV."
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,jofwu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:54:29 2015 UTC,"OK, cool. 20 delta v is a bargain. I haven't logged how much I spent turning orbit around at the edge is SOI, but it was measured in hundreds for sure."
KerbalAcademy,3c8zl1,jofwu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:05:28 2015 UTC,A free-return path is basically a retrograde orbit of the mun without closing the orbit.  I usually spend only 826m/s Δv to transfer from Kerbin to the Mun plus the burn to put the ship into orbit once its at the Mun.

KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,Zero_Kredibility,14,Sun Jul 5 10:49:23 2015 UTC,"Related - is it better to burn radial and keep your altitude high, or burn retrograde to kill off velocity?"
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,BlackStar4,7,Sun Jul 5 12:52:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would say radial out as you're approaching the thick part of the atmosphere, so say 40km ish"
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,number2301,4,Sun Jul 5 13:52:53 2015 UTC,That's interesting. You use the fuel to maintain altitude and use the atmosphere to slow down. I'll try that next time.
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,tauphraim,9,Sun Jul 5 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with radial is that it exposes the side of your ship, while typically it's shielded to protect retrograde (assuming you can even hold the radial position)."
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,fibonatic,5,Sun Jul 5 14:20:14 2015 UTC,That is why you have to do this at a high enough altitude. I usually find that at 40 km altitude the atmosphere is still thin enough such that your reaction wheels will easily be able to counteract the torque due to drag. Also flying sideways through the atmosphere also increases drag.
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,rickyharline,3,Sun Jul 5 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"Well, a constant altitude landing is a mix of these to keep your periapsis constant, ja? I have found that out works here, too. I'll start burning more retro than radial and then adjust as necessary to maintain my periapsis. I've had problems in the past of burning radial and shooting myself out of the atmosphere."
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,Desembler,7,Sun Jul 5 17:02:56 2015 UTC,"I usually do it when I'm about 100km up still, and I'll burn between the radial and retrograde so I can bring down the apoapse without moving the pareapse too far from 35km."
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,Baron_Munchausen,5,Sun Jul 5 15:36:42 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell without the actual craft design, however there are some considerations.  It's better to ditch the fuel tank before you start, and re-enter with as little as possible (i.e., just the capsule and chutes). This will make re-entry heating easier for you, since you'll have less momentum through the atmosphere, and drag will have more effect on you, in a useful manner.  If you can't ditch the tank, and you're trying to renter with fuel and engines, then there should really be a reason for this. If the reason is just economy, then you probably want to try using the engines to help your landing, so not burning at all until the final stages makes more sense.  You can save the burn until around the 30,000m mark for directing your landing trajectory somewhat - if you're trying to get back to KSC, or land somewhere specific.  If you burn retrograde in the upper atmosphere, you are going to steepen your trajectory, that means less time losing speed in the thin atmosphere, and more time with thick atmosphere slamming you to terminal velocity, so this can be a bad idea. Ideally, if you are going to reduce your orbital velocity, you'd probably want to make low orbit first, and re-enter at around the 2,000m/s mark, rather than try to slow yourself down in-atmosphere. Having said that, it can help in a pinch."
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,rootnegative,3,Sun Jul 5 19:24:37 2015 UTC,My personal opinion is during the heating effects. I have no science (other than having not crashed with my approach) to support my thoughts :D
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,LinguistHere,3,Sun Jul 5 12:52:51 2015 UTC,"Generally I believe it's better to use engines to flatten your trajectory (somewhere between retrograde and radial) while you're still fairly high in the atmosphere so that you spend more time bleeding speed before hitting the thicker part of the atmosphere. It's all about maintaining that shallow, mostly-horizontal descent.  Also, some engines (at least as of 1.0.2-- not sure what's been rebalanced since then) are totally useless at higher atmospheric pressures, so for those, it's burn early or not at all."
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,fullmoan,2,Sun Jul 5 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"As others have said, a radial burn is best. If you keep stages and stuff for some reason, save a little bit of fuel (1s burn) for final slowdown, like the soyuz. Packing chues to deal with that adds more weight, and if you save a little bit of fuel for the very end you save some. The best way to do it though is to aerobrake repeatedly, at 45 km or so, and then dump your stage after lowering the final periapsis a bit."
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,RoboRay,2,Mon Jul 6 06:27:31 2015 UTC,"Why burn it off?  If it's in a detachable tank, just dump it when you no longer need it.  Drag will slow you down to terminal velocity either way.  If it's in a tank you're landing with, recover it for a refund."
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,Hidesuru,2,Sun Jul 5 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"Well if you ARE Lansing with it, the extra weight can sometimes overpower your chutes."

KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,only_does_reposts,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:21 2015 UTC,why on earth not retrograde? That's the best way to kill speed and also keep stability and heat shielding.
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,taylorHAZE,3,Sun Jul 5 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Actually the best way to kill speed is to let the atmosphere do it for you.  The atmosphere will give you a lot more -∆v along your prograde trajectory than your engines can. You burn radial+ to keep altitude longer since aero-braking is a time-dependent activity (ie the more time you spend doing it, the more effective it is).  You burst burn purely to keep altitude. I didn't say you couldn't do a 50/50 burn between radial+ and retrograde, just keep your vertical speed low.  If you let the high atmos bleed your speed off, you spend a lot less time during reentry ionization, the real heat shield breaker."
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,only_does_reposts,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:25:25 2015 UTC,correct as it may be turning the ship away from retrograde could cause thermal or stability problems.
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,taylorHAZE,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:00:46 2015 UTC,Not when you're bleeding speed off at 55-65 km
KerbalAcademy,3c6qbt,jansenart,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"Clearly, if you're already reentering, you'll want to get to your final descent stage as quickly as possible.  That being said, burning hard retro while in high atmo will help mitigate aerodynamic heating."

KerbalAcademy,3c7lj7,Lupus_Praedator,2,Sun Jul 5 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"The best way to find a transfer window to Duna, or from any two bodies in a system (like, from Minmus to Mun, even), is a porkchop plot, which is a graph showing time to departure, duration of transfer, and delta-V necessary for the trip.   Someone once told me of a utility besides MechJeb that also does it, but I just use MechJeb's Maneuver Planner module, which generates porkchop plots in the ""Advanced Transfer to Planet"" menu option (the top one).  You can calculate phase angles and everything by hand if you like, but I find it easier to automate the task."
KerbalAcademy,3c7lj7,jansenart,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:04:59 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, a rocket that can land and return from Minmus is able to reach and orbit and return from Duna. The delta-v map in the sidebar tells you the bare minimum you need to reach the planet.  As for how to get there, you have to wait for a transfer window, when your target planet is in the correct phase angle to Kerbin to make an efficient intercept. There are calculators to show you the phase angle you want for each planet, or you could install Kerbal Alarm Clock, which will calculate it for you and allow you to time warp to the window. Duna transfer windows occur about once a year. Once you're in the window, you basically just burn prograde for the planet until you'll reach it's orbital path at your apoapsis, and then adjust your ascending/descending nodes to be in the correct orbital plane. It can take a lot of finagling to get the intercept perfect because the distances are much greater, but the concept is the same as getting an intercept with the Mun or Minmus.   Also, remember that to return you have to wait for the next transfer window from Duna back to Kerbin, which occurs at a different time of year!"

Also, edit node to achieve a good loooking final orbit (~equatorial, CW/CCW). this can be done pretty much anywhere during the transfer. the more you wait, the more dV it will cost you (a) aereobrake @15km went well? SAVE GAME do another one or circularize above atmosphere. (b) did you explode/crash into the ground? LOAD GAME, try 16km... (c) you could not aereobrake? fine tune above atmosphere and circularize (this will cost you A LOT)   (at #2 you'll google ""aereobrake height $planetname"", find 100 different answer that go ""it depends on your speed. try $x km"", try them anyway)  If you want to land there, I found it much easier to have an apollo-style lander.  craft: transfer stage will be big tanks + 1 poddle engine. Nuclear engine is an option but you'll have a very low TWR, you'll find you need 20min burn time for transfer...

Also, mechjeb (or probably even better Precise Node) to fine-edit the manoeuvre nodes"
KerbalAcademy,3c7lj7,Entropius,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:43:33 2015 UTC,"Here's how I do it:  Strongly recommended mods:   Install Precise Node Install Transfer Window Planner Install Kerbal Engineer and have a ∆v map handy.  This is how you know whether you have enough fuel to get where you want.     For executing an interplanetary transfer:   Using Transfer Window Planner (TWP), set the start time to the present year and day.  Then set the end-time for a year (or more) from then. This will give you a porkchop-plot with a best-choice for when to transfer.  More importantly, it gives you a time to transfer in seconds.  Copy that time in seconds (there's a button in TWP for that). Paste that time in seconds into a node with Precise Node. Copy the ejection ∆v from TWP into the node too. You'll notice that the transfer isn't exactly right.  You fix this by using the +/– buttons next to the time (in seconds) in Precise Node, and fine-tune it by hand.  Tweak when the ejection happens forward and backwards and eventually a transfer should line up (zoom out to see the whole transfer).  You shouldn't need to tweak the ∆v numbers. Note: For highly inclined planets like Moho, Dres, Eeloo, you may not get an intercept by merely tweaking the ejection time by a few seconds and will need to add a 2nd maneuver node at your transfer's Ascending Node or Descending Node, and plot your inclination change to complete your path to the target. When part-way through your transfer, after you've left Kerbin's Sphere of Influence (SOI), you'll need to do a mid-course correction to get the orbit to fly right along the planet's equator.  Even NASA has to do  a mid-course correction.  Make sure you flyby your planet on the correct side of it, so you aren't in a backwards orbit around it (Otherwise that could make landing & launching more expensive)   And as a general tip, remember the Oberth Effect.  Ejection burns and capture burns are more efficient when done while you're closest/lowest/fastest to the planet.  (This is why you should NOT use methods that call for you to do most of your ejection burn outside of Kerbin's SOI.)  The Oberth effect is the difference between a capture-burn at Jool costing 500 versus 2500 m/s of ∆v."
KerbalAcademy,3c7lj7,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"Oberth effect:       In astronautics, a powered flyby, or Oberth maneuver, describes a maneuver in which a rocket falls into a gravitational well, and then accelerates when its fall reaches maximum speed.   The resulting maneuver is actually a more efficient way to gain kinetic energy than applying the same impulse outside of a gravitational well. The gain in efficiency is explained by the Oberth effect, which states that the most efficient time for a burn is at orbital periapse.  In some cases, it is even worth spending fuel on slowing the rocket into a gravity well to take advantage of the efficiencies of the Oberth effect.  The maneuver and effect are named after Hermann Oberth, the Austro-Hungarian-born German physicist and a founder of modern rocketry, who first described them in 1927.

Burn prograde and it gets wider on the far side, burn normal and it tilts around the point where you currently are, burn radial and it ROTATES around the point where you are. This also means that you change your orbit when doing approach maneuvers, because you are changing your speed. Especially if you slowly want to drift closer over 10 or so km, you need to re-tweak your orbit a lot by burning RCS in the normal direction a bit."

KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,bobbertmiller,2,Sun Jul 5 09:35:55 2015 UTC,"Here is the same picture link again, with the added ""easier"" version.. So what's your problem specifically? You want your orbit to be in the same plane as your target's (see normal burns on ascending/descending nodes). You want to have an intersect point with your target's orbit at which you'll later rendezvous. You want your orbit to be a bit longer/shorter than your target's, so you can just wait a few times until it's reasonably close on the next orbit around. You can then burn on pro/retro on the intersect until it is sub 1 km or so. The next orbit around, you can 0 your relative velocity on the intersect and can work from there."
KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,Javascap,2,Sun Jul 5 09:45:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's talk about the rules of orbit. The first thing you need to know to rendezvous is that objects in a lower orbit move faster than objects in a high orbit. You can observe this in Kerbin orbit by watching the Mun and Minmus in their orbits. Now, if you wanted to get to the Mun from Kerbin orbit, you would need to aim not where the Mun is, but where it will be by the time you get there.  Orbital rendezvous is a similar concept, you want to get to where a spacecraft is, and you have gotten really close! 1.2km is close enough that most of the weird effects of orbiting are mitigated. Now, when you select a target, two icons come up in the blue and brown navball at the bottom of your screen. The purple circle with a dot in it indicates you are pointing at your target, and 3 purple lines pointing to a dot in the center means you are pointing away from your target. Those are crucial for the final approach to orbital rendezvous.  Once you've matched velocities with your target and are within 2 km of a rendezvous, try pointing towards the target and accelerating gently, It's not the most efficient method, but eventually, after a handful of rounds of pointing towards the target and matching velocities at the closest approach, whether it is exactly on target or not, you will approach the target and be able to dock."
KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,krenshala,2,Sun Jul 5 11:45:00 2015 UTC,"Don't get too frustrated by this.  It took NASA a few tries to get it right, as well. :D  The counter-intuitive movements of orbital mechanics boil down to four simple rules:   burning forward (prograde) takes you out out takes you back (retrograde) back takes you in (toward what you are orbiting) in takes you forward   So to catch up with your target, a retrograde burn will slow you down and take you inward to a faster orbit which allows you to catch up to the target.  For the target to catch up to you, a prograde burn will speed you up and take you outward into a slower orbit which allows the target to catch up to you.  As others have said, once you are inside physics range (2.4km) the best method is to null your relative vectors (in target mode get the listed velocity as close to 0 as possible) then do a small burn toward your target.  I recommend you close at no more than 1m/s per 0.1km of separation (i.e., slow down as you get closer) to avoid accidentally smashing into the target craft.  You will have to make corrections to keep heading toward the target, and thats where the counter intuitive stuff comes in again.  Make a small adjustment and see where your prograde vector moves comparedto the target marker on the nav-ball. If its the wrong direction just nudge it back the other way.  As long as its small maneuvers you won't really waste enough fuel/monoprop for it to matter."
KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,Desembler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, when it comes to fine tuning your encounter with rcs, basically everything is counter intuitive, so if translating with rcs in one direction increase the gap, just tak the controls back into the other direction until it's as small as you can get it, then fiddle around with the other directions, and you can usually widdle it down a bit more. Once you have an encounter of ~1km though, you can basically ignore the encounters in the map view, just burn (lightly) retrograde from target until you cancel most of your relative velocity, than burn directly towards the target. Don't exceed 10m/s or so, and as you drift closer your prograde will drift away, so you will need to make periodic correction burns. These corrections can also be easily done with RCS and it's good practice for when you get closer. Just keep canceling your relent velocity and then burning towards the target and you should be able to edge closer. And with practice it becomes quite easy."

KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,bluepepper,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:36:21 2015 UTC,"I got a close encounter of 1.2km on a node but even when I executed it with 0.0m/s DV left my close encounter was 6.somethingkm away   There can be variations between a planned maneuver and the actual result, even at 0.0m/s delta-v.  One reason is that a maneuver is calculated as if all the acceleration happened instantly in a single point, while in reality it takes time and you're moving during that time.  Be sure to start your maneuver so that about half of it will occur before the maneuver point and the other half after.  Also be sure to follow the maneuver node, especially at the end.  Ultimately, if you feel the encounter isn't very good after you maneuver, try and put a new maneuver, test various directions to see if one of them doesn't improve the encounter.   then in target mode I pointed retrograde as it told me and held H with RCS on, and that made my close encounter even further away   Retrograde?  And does the tutorial tell you to stop at some point?  When you arrive at the encounter, you're roughly at the same place as the target but not on the same orbit.  So what you do is ensure your navball is set to target mode, point retrograde and burn in that direction (carefully) untill your speed to the target is 0.  That will put you on a very close orbit.  Then you point towards the target and accelerate a little.  This will put the prograde marker on the target.  Don't go too fast and be ready to stop when you're closer (by flipping around and burning towards retrograde again until speed is 0.  All these maneuvers can be done with normal thrusters (carefully), keeping RCS for docking."

This will put you (assuming you stop when speed relative to the target becomes 0) in the same velocity as the target. If you're still far away from it, that will give you a totally different orbit.  You want to wait until you are at the encounter, and only then, cancel relative velocity and start moving toward the target.  6km could be an OK encounter, for a start."

KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,jansenart,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"First, I feel your pain.  It's hard to learn and one feels horribly inept at first.  The ""frigging took off"" effect is, I believe, because of the different curvature of the vessels' orbits.   Imagine holding a ball in front of you looking absolutely straight ahead.  It's probably, say, 3 feel away.  Now drop the ball, but keep looking straight ahead.  It's going to seem to zip out of our field of vision and by the time it's at your waist, is probably no longer visible.  Happens really quickly.  If the other vessel is below you, it will start to curve downwards as part of its orbit before you do.  Using the analogy above, it starts to ""fall"" faster than you ""look down"".  The effect gets stronger as you get closer (imagine the ball being on a table 50 feet way instead of being held by hand.  If it rolls off the table, you'll still be able to see it, even if you keep looking straight ahead.)  The good news, which isn't immediately obvious, is that the other vessel isn't really much farther away.  If the ball dropping from your outstretched hand to your waist is 2 feet and you had held it out 3 feet, it's now just ( 22 + 32).5 = ~ 3.5 feet away.   The same holds with the other craft.  If you re-orient so you are facing it, you'll see it close by and not moving very fast relative to you (since you are close to it, the different in the curves of your orbits is slight. )  So, if you can overcome the psychological impact of having it zip out of sight, it's not so much of a problem.  I also found the mod Docking Alignment Aid very helpful both as a guidance instrument and as instruction on the steps to take: Align your docking port to the other one; rotate so both ports have the same orientation and ""up"" means ""up"" to all bodies in the problem; move in slowly; use RCS translation to steer your ship to where the ports will touch when you get close.  The first video on the mod's home page is especially good, I thought.  The other possibility is that you are coming a bit fast and are a bit below, above, right or left of the other craft.  Think about standing on the sidewalk watching a car approach on the parallel road.  When it's a mile away, it seems to be moving pretty slowly.  Within a few seconds of when it drives by you, it seems to be going really quickly.  Again, more psychological than physical.  Just turn around and move towards it again.  (I seem to do this more with EVAing Kerbals than ships and have sent Jeb zipping past his target when I was overly anxious to get there).  One last thought is to ignore the visual and rely on instruments also entirely, whether just the NavBall or a docking aid mod.  They are less vulnerable to these effects and will freak you out less (at least that works for me).  It's almost impossible to really understand the relative position of vessels since, unless you can position the camera directly behind your craft and somehow look through it, your view is from an angle.  I hope I haven't mis-stated anything and am sure someone will correct me if I have ;-). Good luck and know that it CAN be done.  I'm not particularly good at video games in general or eye-hand coordination in real life, but managed to go from ""This is stupid, I hate this stupid game, this is stupid..."" to ""Almost routine docking, even if NASA engineers miles away inexplicably wince whenever I try to do so"" pretty quickly once it ""clicked"".  Hang in!"
KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,bobbertmiller,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:06:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, first, I've rendezvoused hundreds of times. To be clear, I am an expert.  What happens in the docking tutorial is absolutely NOTHING like what physics dictates because it is horribly bugged: Killing your velocity relative to the target ends up somehow generating more dV right after you finish the maneuver. The two craft literally fly off away from each other for absolutely no reason.  AGAIN: THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN.  Have you tried the tutorial? I did it in my quick way without clicking the ""next"" boxes as they were supposed to be, maybe that caused it."

KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,QuickBASIC,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"Some aspects of rendezvous have been portrayed as being more complicated than they need to be. If you have the navball in targeting mode, and you are within a few kilometers of the thing you are trying to get to, it provides you with enough information to rendezvous with normal engines, and you can ignore this RCS translation business, at least until the exercise is basically over.  The speed you are given above the navball is relative to the target, and your initial goal is to reduce that to zero. How do you do that? The navball's retrograde marker is also relative to the target. Point your ship at that and burn until relative velocity is zero.  Now you want to move toward the thing. How do you do that? The pink dot with arcs around it points at your target. Point your ship at that and burn, then turn off your engines, point at the retrograde marker, and wait. When you get close enough, take your relative velocity back to zero, then repeat this paragraph.  After a few iterations you should be able to get within 10 meters, with zero relative velocity, without breaking a sweat."
KerbalAcademy,3c6krh,yCloser,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"When I first started rendezvous, I just got a really small phasing orbit, waited 10-20 orbits and then nulled my speed once it got close.  It's not as efficient, but it works. Just make sure your orbit is smaller if you're behind the target and bigger if you're ahead.   Once you do this a few times you'll get a feel for the different speeds in different sizes orbits and you can guesstimate where you need to put your phasing orbit to catch up a lot quicker."

You can do it by feel & experience. On Kerbin, MaxQ is somewhere between 8km and 12km depending on how quick you're going. Basically the way I fly is I aim to be at 45 degrees by 10km and I keep my speed at such a level that I don't get the white aero effects. I keep within the prograde vector at all times though, I never deviate too much from it.

That doesn't mean it is easy. The low gravity of Minmus will help some. If you have a strong RCS system you can get into a near perfect hover and use your RCS to maneuver. Then treat it like a normal docking with a very hard deadline. The other option is just like a normal landing (where you just tilt your craft and adjust throttle) but very very precise. Either way you should be careful that your rocket exhaust is not hitting your drilling platform so keep the engines far away from the docking port when building.
KerbalAcademy,3c61le,2silverseas,2,Sun Jul 5 07:34:26 2015 UTC,"You can do either way. I found it much easier to send the drills/ore into orbit, though. Because docking stuff on the surface is very difficult: you have to align the docking ports heights very precisely at ship construction time, no correction possible in-flight. That's without counting landing legs that can be flexible and change the height, or the occasional bug. (this is for docking the ships laterally. one on top of the other sounds very hard too).  On minmus it's not that expensive to bring heavy stuff into a low orbit."

KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,TMarkos,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm already using such tools, and know the desired angle. Let's take an example: Jool/100km->Kerbin/100km needs a phase angle of -238.42°. Now how do I know when that happens, when I'm not orbiting Jool myself ?"
KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,TMarkos,2,Sat Jul 4 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"Like I said, just treat Laythe like the spaceship and make sure you're coming off your ejection parallel to its orbit.  If you eject when Laythe is at -238 degrees and you manage to eject parallel to its orbital vector, then it's functionally similar to making the burn in the Jool SOI at that position.    As to how to know when Laythe gets there...  many people are suggesting holding a protractor up to your screen and frankly I don't have a better option.  There's probably a mod out there that will display phase angles for non-SOI bodies, but I don't know what it is off the top of my head."
KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,rogueop,2,Sat Jul 4 19:45:49 2015 UTC,"If you would rather make things simpler, get outside Laythe's influence so you are orbiting Jool alone. You're going to have to do this eventually anyway.   I think you aren't currently getting a phase angle because KER won't calculate for bodies orbiting a different parent object, i.e. Kerbin orbits Kerbol, Jool orbits Kerbol, but Laythe orbits Jool."
KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,FellKnight,2,Sat Jul 4 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"Won't that cost me more dv ? Escaping Laythe will put me into a somewhat elliptical orbit around Jool, and then when Jool escape time comes, it would be luck if the burn corresponded to the periapsis of that orbit."
KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,fullmoan,2,Sat Jul 4 18:00:42 2015 UTC,It will probably be more efficient to escape and very gently aerobrake (like 5-10km into Jool's atmo aka 190-195km) several times and end up in a ~210-225 km orbit around Jool (correction burn to raise your periapsis at apoapsis).  You'll be going like 5.5km/s and will get a hell of an oberth kick.
KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,FellKnight,2,Sat Jul 4 18:12:09 2015 UTC,"Aerobraking requires lowering the periapsis much more than a simple escape from Laythe. It the oberth gain worth the cost for a simple return to Kerbin ?  Anyway my current ship is not really equipped for aerobraking, I dread having to suffer through dozens of orbits (especially with Jool's timewarp bug) !"
KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,rogueop,2,Sat Jul 4 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"If he was going for the oberth kick, wouldn't he burn like a low mun orbit return and burn again at perijool? He would be going a lot faster."
KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,fullmoan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:34:06 2015 UTC,"True, if the timing worked our properly for the ejection burn to be immediate on the descent, that would be the best option possible.  I was just suggesting the easiest option in case the stars (heh heh) don't line up"
KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,fullmoan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:10:11 2015 UTC,It's also unlikely that Laythe will line up with the periapsis of jool when escape time comes. You are rolling the dice either way.

KerbalAcademy,3c3qxk,Yodaskool,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:41:36 2015 UTC,"Don't leave laythe's soi. You've got a day or two window for the burn and you are really far out from kerbin, so you can adjust a bit on the way home. Figure out a time when you can escape from laythe, burn at perijool and go directly home. Your jool pe should be pretty low, but don't go crazy ttying to get it lower. 1000 km is great. Try it a few times to get the angle right, and then do it. Burn at the periapsis to get one hell of an oberth effect, and you'll be on your way home for (rough estimate) 1.5 km/s or so. A gravity assist would greatly help with the other method."

Dueling SAS - if you have reaction wheels enabled anywhere and the ship is flexible, the wheels can create a positive feedback loop and tear the ship apart.  Same goes for RCS and even control surfaces in atmosphere, although it's less common.  Try turning off all sources of force and seeing if it quiets down.

KerbalAcademy,3c13q3,Ifyouseekey,7,Fri Jul 3 20:15:51 2015 UTC,"Getting into a polar orbit isn't too difficult, but if you want to get into the same plane, you'll need to wait until the Mun is in the right position before doing your LKO burn.  The easiest way to get into a polar orbit of the Mun is to do a standard transfer burn, then put a maneuver node about half way to the Mun.  Adjust the normal / anti-normal to get it into a polar orientation, making sure to note which way your station is orbiting.  You'll likely need to adjust some of the other directions as well.  Focusing the view on the Mun helps a lot with this (double click on it in the map view).  I think the easiest way to see how the orbital plane is going to would would be to put your 2 maneuver nodes (transfer & correction) and see how it lines up to the station orbit.  Then you can time warp ahead to adjust how the angle will work out."
KerbalAcademy,3c13q3,Jim3535,3,Fri Jul 3 20:42:29 2015 UTC,"I have rendezvoused with a station in a polar Munar orbit by adding a maneuver half way between Kerbin and the Mun that adjusts the inclination of the orbit (purple triangle nodes) to make the encounter more polar. Once you enter the Mun's sphere of influence, perform another maneuver that will combine matching the inclination and orbit height of the station.   Edit: Scott Manley's career mode tutorials cover this type of maneuver... Check that out if you don't understand what I am trying to say."
KerbalAcademy,3c13q3,enzlow,2,Fri Jul 3 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"You do not need to time things that accurately.  Remember than when you turn the hyperbolic orbit of your crew transfer vehicle into a circular orbit, you first pass through a highly elliptical stage.  That will put the apoapsis very far away from the Mun, which means that the plane-change maneuver will be cheap if conducted there.   For the most delta-V efficient process, transfer such that the crew vehicle has its hyperbolic periapsis as close to the south pole as you dare.  Burn retrograde to turn that into a highly eccentric, elliptical orbit.  At the north pole, perform the plane-change maneuver to match your station, then raise the periapsis to your intermediate rendezvous orbit.  Circularize, and dock as you would in an equatorial orbit.  Unfortunately, this process may not be very fast, because you will need to complete the highly elliptical (and thus slow) transfer/plane-change orbit.  To make it fast, you would need to launch such that you arrive directly (or almost directly) in the target plane, but that will be very difficult as it depends not only upon the precise timing but also upon your angle of entry into the Mun's SoI.  If you can hit that transfer spot-on, then you will not need much if any residual plane change and can thus perform the maneuver at a lower (and faster-to-reach) orbit, perhaps even at the same time as your capture burn."

If needed you can make later correction burns to make your orbit pass thru Mun's center. Once you get close enough to see the target orbit, burn a low periapsis as nearly in-plane with target as possible. Begin rendezvous planning ...

KerbalAcademy,3c13q3,reddrip,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:15:30 2015 UTC,All the rest is good info.  Just remember that the sooner you do correction burns the less Δv it will require to make that change.

KerbalAcademy,3c13q3,krenshala,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"You should set your self onto a polar mun-orbit path as soon as you finish your transfer burn at Kerbin, if you didn't set it that way during the transfer burn.  Once you are in the Mun's SoI, then yes, you would want to do any inclination changes at apoapsis as it costs significantly less Δv to do so.  Hell, most of the time its more efficient to move your apoapsis up, make the inclination change, and then move the apoapsis back down than it is to just make the change at apoapsis."

Is there some trick to that?    Every time I try to change inclination for a Mun flyby during or just after a transfer burn, it uses a crazy amount of delva-v and doesn't work all that well.  Even thinking about it logically, it doesn't make sense.  It's effectively doing a plane change, so you want to be as high and traveling as slow as possible, as you pointed out.  LKO is the worst place to do that.  I've done experiments with maneuver nodes in different places along the transfer path, and it seems most efficient about half way from Kerbin to the Mun.  This makes logical sense since for the plane change, you want to be as far away from Kerbin as possible, but for the approach to the Mun, you want to be as far away from Mun as possible."
KerbalAcademy,3c13q3,krenshala,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:47:46 2015 UTC,A minor change normal to Kerbin's equator should be all that is needed to move your path from right past teh Mun's equator to passing over (or under) the pole. The farther from the mun you make that change the less Δv it will require.

Here we have a standard equatorial injection burn.  This one puts you on a Mun-intercept (i.e., ""we're gonna crash!"").  Next is the same maneuver, but with the burn adjusted to the normal (e.g., North or up).  I tried to get this to a 90° change to show how much it takes from an 80x85km parking orbit, but right after this screenshot I hit the engines and goofed it all up. :(  As you can see, it takes 871.4m/s for the ""we're gonna die!"" intercept on the equatorial plane, but an extra 24.3m/s (for a total of 895.7m/s) to shift that to a 45° inclination at the mun by adjusting the trans-munar-injection burn northward (normal).  With some careful maneuver node adjustment you can make this pretty close to a 90° inclination I'm just too lazy to do so for this image. ;)  I hope this helps."
KerbalAcademy,3c13q3,Jim3535,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:47:20 2015 UTC,"I did finally manage to get it plotted with one maneuver.  It took quite a bit of fiddling with the position and burn to get it right.  I didn't get the efficiency quite as high as you had, but my initial encounter was also less delta-v.  The missing step turned out to be adjusting the position of the maneuver node as the normal / anti-normal adjustment is made.  Not doing that prevented me from ever getting close to a polar flyby.  I still think it's much easier to do a mid-course correction, unless there is a trick to adjusting the single maneuver node."
KerbalAcademy,3c13q3,krenshala,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:42:26 2015 UTC,"There isn't really a trick.  It can definitely be easier to do the normal burn after the mun-injection burn, though."

From there you need to burn 860m/s to put yourself into a ""Mun intercept trajectory"" (burnin prograde at the right place/time).  And finally you need 310m/s more (retrograde at periapsis inside Mun's SOI) to establish a Mun orbit.

KerbalAcademy,3c00w8,krenshala,2,Fri Jul 3 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. To launch from the KSC and achieve Orbit around Kerbin you need approximately 4500m/s. With fine tuning to both your rocket and your ascent profile you can achieve orbit with much less. For example, I can make it to orbit regularly with only 3800m/s."
KerbalAcademy,3c021d,clownburner,8,Fri Jul 3 15:25:26 2015 UTC,"In order to deflect an asteroid it is cheaper perform a burn while as far away from Kerbin as possible, since the astroid significantly increases your dry mass thus lowers your delta-v. In order to intercept the astroid as soon as possible you have to accelerate towards it more and thus also slow down more in order to grab on to it. So the numbers you stated might be of the right order of magnitude.  If you would have detected the astroid a lot sooner it would have been a lot cheaper to rendezvous with it."

KerbalAcademy,3c0h19,TMarkos,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:31:13 2015 UTC,It's possible that the config is done part-by-part because it was first written before MM wild cards were powerful enough to do exactly what the authors wanted. The part-by-part approach is also less likely to get in the way if you want to set up a particular part differently.
KerbalAcademy,3bze2z,TED96,4,Fri Jul 3 11:26:22 2015 UTC,"How much schooling do you have? Wikipedia will get you a long ways.   Start with the vis-viva equation: v = sqrt(GM(2/r - 1/a)). V is speed, GM is the planet/moon's gravitational parameter, r is distance from planet/moon center (altitude + planet/moon radius), and a is your semi-major axis. This is essentially a reorganization of the equation for specific orbital energy, which says total orbital energy for a given orbit is the sum of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.  You can use vis-viva to calculate position or velocity at any point in an orbit. If you know one (and your semi-major axis) you can get the other. So... If you know your current SMA, the SMA of the orbit you want to be in, and your ""r"" at whichever point you will burn, then you can calculate the speed at that point for each orbit. The delta-v then is the difference between the two.   Examples:   Let's just assume GM=1 for simplicity and ignore units. You have a Pe of 2 and an Ap of 6 (to the planet center, not to the surface like the game map tells you). Semi-major axis is half of their sum, so a=(2+6)/2=4. Velocity at Pe therefore is v=sqrt(1(2/2+1/4))=sqrt(5/4)  Say you want to bring Ap down to 2 to circularize. The new SMA would be a=(2+2)/2=2. The velocity at Pe (or anywhere really since it's a circle) would be v=sqrt(1(2/2-1/2))=sqrt(1/2) . The delta-v to change to this orbit at Pe would be sqrt(1/2) - sqrt(5/4).  What if you want to bump the Ap to 10, from the original orbit? The new SMA would be a=(2+10)/2=6. The velocity at Pe (or anywhere really since it's a circle) would be v=sqrt(1(2/2-1/6))=sqrt(5/6) . The delta-v to change to this orbit at Pe would be sqrt(5/6) - sqrt(5/4).  Make sense? Glad to help more if something's confusing or you want me to go more on some point."

In order to find out how much ∆v is required to change the apoapsis at periapsis, just look at the absolute difference in vp when you use your current radius of the apoapsis and when the new desired radius of the apoapsis. The same can be done for the periapsis, just switch the word apoapsis with periapsis and vice versa."

If there isn't anything to stop this force (like 20 sas units or 20 vernier thrusters) it will flip over on the centre of gravity.

KerbalAcademy,3bw9g3,FaceDeer,7,Thu Jul 2 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"A little while back I landed a drilling rig in what seemed like a high-ore region of the Mun and the surface scanner reported no ore. I had some fuel left in the lander's tanks, though, so I sent it hopping a few kilometers off to one side and the new landing site reported some ore. Another hop and there was significantly more ore.  So I think this might be a matter of resolution. The orbital survey shows the average ore concentration of the area, but when you get down to the surface there are kilometer-scale variations. Makes sense - few ores are spread evenly over large areas, they're usually in pockets or seams.  So now my standard MO is to send down a small unmanned rover with a surface ore scanner, and have it trundle around finding the perfect landing site. Then I use the lander as something to aim for when landing the main rig."

If you can upgrade the right building (I can't remember which one does it), you can shift-right-click on the fuel tanks to transfer fuel around so that all the engines work.  You talk about a total of five fuel tanks, but your diagram only shows four.  Is the fifth tank the center stack?  If so, how is it connected?  This is probably where you run into problems, because if you did it the most logical way, you've got two paths from the center stack to each engine, and that will get you into trouble.  I can think of two variations on this that might work.  Since I've never tried this particular configuration, I suspect that at least one of these two will have issues that I haven't thought of yet.  The first is to run fuel lines from the center stack to the tank-only stacks, and then one fuel line each from each of the tank-only stacks to an engine stack.  That way, each tank-only stack is dedicated to a specific engine and the center stack gets shared.  The other way is to feed the tank-only stacks into the center stack, then feed the center stack to the engine stacks.  This has the advantage that you can drop the tank-only stacks when they're empty rather than waiting until the tank-only stacks and the center stack are empty."

If you are in a 100km orbit, lowering your periapsis to below 30km will be more than enough to ensure a proper re-entry.  Additionally, make sure your capsule is pointing towards your retrograde vector to ensure the maximum amount of drag is applied to your vessel. Your vessel will want to tip pointy-end first if you aren't careful."
KerbalAcademy,3bwxq0,Scuwr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:19:18 2015 UTC,If its just a capsule and chute it should want to come in retrograde. Adding a materials bay or storage bay underneath will throw it off and it will fight you to deviate from retrograde.

Try stacking two of the RT-10 solid boosters (the second smallest). Burn the first stage to completion, then go up at an angle (example 50 degrees) on the second until it runs out, then check apoapsis. If it's much more than 70k meters, try again with a reduced angle, if you undershoot 70k, increase it.  With luck you'll end up low enough and moving laterally enough that you survive.  If you think that reverting to launch is cheese, this won't be for you, obviously.  Another option is powered descent, but that's tricky since you run out of electricity and fuel, and timing is tricky.  The naive ""more boosters"" solution is actually good here, since solid is cheap enough that using too many won't cripple you, and you can get going sideways pretty good.

It'll let you lock the fuel tanks on the shuttle, and very easily (<10 seconds) unlock them again afterwards.

For me, the decision between ion and atomic engine came down to the payload mass.  Ion is great for really light probes, but will leave you wanting to throw things if you try to use it for anything much heavier, and if you throw multiple engines at it, you wind up needing a lot more power.  Also, in 1.0, solar power become a lot less effective once you get out beyond Duna (and even at Duna the difference is quite noticeable), so I probably wouldn't want to try to do a solar powered ion probe to Jool, for example.  Using an LFO tank and enough fuel cells to power the ion engine should work fine, but from what I've heard, that reduces your effective ISP to about 1200.  Still better than the atomic engine, but not by as much."
KerbalAcademy,3btfwo,Eric_S,6,Thu Jul 2 00:34:34 2015 UTC,"It depends. In general it's a lot harder to fly ion powered craft since they're so low thrust. It's possible to not have enough thrust to get a capture orbit (although that should almost never happen). So if space piloting isn't your forte, it can be tough.   That said they almost always have better delta v. There's always trade offs. I'd say, run the numbers (tsiolkovsy rocket equation) and see how much benefit you get, and decide if it's worth it dealing with low thrust."
KerbalAcademy,3btfwo,SenorPuff,4,Thu Jul 2 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"For probes the nuclear engine is usually too heavy, which makes the choice between ions and chemical engines. For modest delta-V requirements such as going to Duna, Eve, or the Joolian system with aerocapture chemicals will generally be lightest. If you want more than 0.5 Kerbin TWR ion engines are hopeless. For higher delta-V requirements such as a multi-destination mission or one avoiding aerocapturing ion engines can be a good choice.

I'd say if the bulk of your spacecraft (minus engines and fuel) is up to like 5t, load up on ion engines until you get the TWR you want, and don't forget solar panels or RTG.  The Nerv itself is 3t, so, probably from like 4t+ of bulk mass, you'll want to consider it, depending on your mission profile."

This makes it a good choice for landings or anything you want to come home.  I would probably suggest making a single ship with super light satellites and a small rover.  The easiest thing is to go for ultralight and make the mission straightforward.  I haven't done interplanetary missions since 1.0, so the new heating system will require heat shields for aerobraking at minimum.  I hear aerobraking around Jool is basically impossible now.

If you are mining and refining the fuel from minimus it could be most cost effective to ship the fuel back to Kerbin orbit...  I am planning on doing a cost benefit analysis of that, just got drills :)  But I have seen a few debates on launching from minimus versus Kerbin - you should be able to find them pretty easily."

KerbalAcademy,3btav5,shakefu,2,Thu Jul 2 14:53:14 2015 UTC,Maybe refuel at Minmus and then swing back past Kerbin for kicking out further into the system?
KerbalAcademy,3btav5,rootnegative,2,Thu Jul 2 00:39:47 2015 UTC,"OK, so how would that work?  Do I need to bring it back to a circular LKO, or would a highly elliptical one be OK so long as I burn at periapsis?"
KerbalAcademy,3btav5,Kansas11,2,Thu Jul 2 00:54:29 2015 UTC,"A highly elliptical is fine so long as you burn at the PE. However, you need to make sure the PE is in the right spot for a good exit vector... That is to say, it'll need to be (very roughly) around the day/night terminator line on Kerbin. That way when you make your transfer burn, the exit vector is close to the orbital vector of Kerbin.  If you put the PE in the wrong spot, you'll end up not being able to get a good exit vector and you'll get a really bad efficiency transfer.  To the PE in the right spot, you'll need to wait until Minmus is in the right spot. Hopefully that coincides with your transfer window.  Hoping that makes sense :D  (this lengthy post is the reason I suggest moving the refuelling station to LKO. Not only does it makes sense in dV terms, its also much easier on the brain to get the timings/locations to work)"
KerbalAcademy,3btav5,shakefu,2,Thu Jul 2 04:47:57 2015 UTC,"He's saying use the Oberth effect around kerbin, not to circularize around it. By swinging close by, you use its gravitational pull to give you more momentum on your eventual way toward duna or wherever. You want to use it like a slingshot (like they did around the moon in apollo 13)"

KerbalAcademy,3btav5,r00bz,2,Thu Jul 2 01:48:20 2015 UTC,I would move the station to Kerbin. You're exactly right the Oberth effect is the difference. Its better to do your refuelling in LKO and then launch from there than to do it around minmus.

KerbalAcademy,3bslsl,agtwork,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, you either don't have SAS equipped or your battery doesn't have enough charge to power it.   Your command modules have a minimal amount (like 5 units) of SAS built into them to allow attitude adjustment for landers and small satellites. The SAS module with 20 units of control is the minimum amount necessary to control a full sized rocket.  SAS is the gyroscopic stability control that keeps your rocket headed in the direction you point it. Along with easing back on the throttle a bit, SAS will provide a lot of the effort needed to keep you from tumbling end over end. Remember, you can adjust pitch and throttle on engines, but not on solid rockets."

KerbalAcademy,3bslsl,FellKnight,2,Wed Jul 1 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm not home right now, but I can describe it. It's basically a bunch of hammers  (I think that's what they're called, really early-game solid thrusters) on the bottom of a little command pod with a couple of mystery goos and a parachute on it. Then I stuck a ton of fins everywhere until I reached either my part or weight limit. I made sure the weight was balanced, and everything is symmetrical, so I don't understand what's dragging it down or what force is knocking it off course."
KerbalAcademy,3bslsl,FellKnight,3,Wed Jul 1 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"You're going way too fast in the thick lower atmo and the drag is causing your rocket to flip.  Use fewer SRBs.  Also, your fins only need to be on the bottom part of the ship for stability.  If you put them up high, you're actually making your ship more maneuverable (i.e. easy to flip)"
KerbalAcademy,3bslsl,2silverseas,3,Wed Jul 1 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"Oh my god I've done everything wrong. I had all of my fins on the top because ""hey, if I separate the bottom stage, I'm gonna lose all that stability, so STRAP THEM ALL TO THE TOP!"" That, and ""I'm gonna go as fast as possible so I don't have as long to fuck up."" Neither of these are good apparently. Will update in a sec after I launch a new one!"
KerbalAcademy,3bslsl,FellKnight,2,Thu Jul 2 01:58:42 2015 UTC,"Good luck!  It can be necessary to put fins on your second stage as well, especially if the first stage doesn't get you above 10km, but usually it's not necessary as long as your control your thrust with the second stage."

KerbalAcademy,3bslsl,FellKnight,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"Solid boosters to get to 15km or so is fine (it may make it difficult to control, but shouldn't be too inefficient.  This is the ship I use for Low Orbit rescue missions. Should work for you too (and have a good amount of spare delta-v for piloting errors). http://i.imgur.com/bYiU7VF.jpg.  Basically, RealChute, Probe core, Lander Can with 4 Solar Panels, Decoupler, FL-100 and Terrier, FL-800 and Swivel, FL-800 and Reliant with 4 Hammer SRBs, fins for stability.  You can trade out the Lander Can for a Command pod and the RealChute for a regular Chute if you like."
KerbalAcademy,3bslsl,Pyromaniacal13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"Multiple stages is the way to go for more altitude. Obviously this is hard early on (30 part limit) but there are ways to improve regardless.  If you're noticing white lines around your craft (or red lines) then you're burning through the atmosphere too fast and getting too much drag. Lower your thrust if using liquid engines, or return to assembly and limit the thrust of your solid rockets to something a little less.  Limited solid rockets to about 20km high and then a liquid fuel rocket to orbit is a decent starting out plan. When you switch to your liquid engines try burning prograde (the circle shape on your naval that should be pointing in the blue. There's another pointing in the red and this is your retrograde) and that should put you into orbit if you have enough delta v.  Also, once your periapsis is at about 70km you can stop climbing and wait until you reach it, once you reach it burn prograde and that's the best way to expand your orbit.  There's lots of trial and error involved but it is absolutely possible to do :)"
KerbalAcademy,3bslsl,Kansas11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"As small and simple as possible (while still remaining mission-capable) is the way to go. (What is the mission, btw?)  The bigger the craft, the more stabilising it needs. The built-in SAS in the pods isn't going to be able to hold a rickety thirty-ton craft on course by itself.  Also, the early part of your ascent should (I think) be done at fairly moderate speed (the thick atmosphere makes high speeds inefficient, and controlling the craft at speed much harder). (Right-clicking on the boosters in VAB allows you to limit their thrust, so they burn longer at lower power, but actually getting rid of some of them will probably work better.)"
KerbalAcademy,3brenn,franklymydeer,27,Wed Jul 1 15:21:42 2015 UTC,"Go to Minmus before Mun. Only very slightly harder to get to, but so much easier to land on and return from. Build your rocket taller to give it more delta v, build wider with side mounted boosters to give it more thrust to lift heavy things, not to get more delta v. In orbit, go on an eva, go a kilometer out from your ship, then come back. It's pretty easy and gives you so much more confidence. I was so terrified I'd lose my grip on the ladder and be lost forever when I first started. You can pull the science data out of a science part and store it back in your capsule, during an EVA. No need to figure out how to land a bunch of material study bay's without exploding them. Screw getting science from Kerbin biomes. They're just like a bonus if you happen to land on one you haven't before. There's no reason to make a rocket just to get to the desert. Just go to space for the science. Planes are tricky, and not worth it because screw getting science from kerbin biomes. It is perfectly ok to time accelerate way into the future. There's no need to set up an interplanetary voyage and then do a bunch of other stuff while you're waiting for it to arrive. Just do one thing at a time. Jeb can live for centuries without any ill effects. An extra solar panel or two is never a bad idea. Science instruments are heavy at first. Don't bring like 8 material bays on your second launch, it'll be a beast to get into orbit. You can get a lot of science just from crew reports and eva's (and temperature data). Kerbal alarm clock. Get it."
KerbalAcademy,3brenn,miyoung1,9,Wed Jul 1 16:59:27 2015 UTC,"#4 and #9 are now easier because Scientists can restore material bays and other instruments to a state of readiness, after their data has been removed.  If you have a Scientist on board, there's typically no reason to carry multiple copies of the same experiment.  I'm used to #7 being very wrong, but only because I use the TAC Life Support mod most of the time."
KerbalAcademy,3brenn,experts_never_lie,7,Wed Jul 1 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"Very true. Scientists can restore instruments. But you can still only carry one copy of each report per capsule, and you need 4 copies to max out the science. So either multiple capsules, multiple science tools, or multiple missions to that biome/situation. It's a tradeoff.  About 7. I'm not sure what my initial thinking was, but I kept feeling like I couldn't waste time. So like I'd launch a rocket, get it on a Mun transfer, launch another rocket to minmus while waiting for the first to reach Mun, and so on. Launching mission after mission until one of them reached their destination and needed my real time attention. I don't know, for some reason I felt that fastforwarding past a couple years so my probe could arrive at Jool was, like, wasting my time. I kept wanting to have as many things going concurrently as possible. Not sure why. Too many Gantt charts at work, perhaps."

Every time I've done one of these I've launched the vessel that did the mining after the contract was accepted. The contracts don't indicate that using a new vessel for it is a condition (like with contracts to place satellites), but I suppose that could be what's going on.

KerbalAcademy,3bq4dy,RumAndCookies,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:44:48 2015 UTC,"I've experienced this once or twice, though it was back in alpha days. I never positively identified the cause, but when I sought advice about the issue I had a lot of people telling me that mods cause this. In my case it wasn't so severe though; occasionally when I had a craft reentering over KSC it would experience the ""collision"" at about 20km up, but if I went back to the last autosave and tried again it wouldn't happen (though the autosave was before the deorbit burn, so I wasn't taking the exact same trajectory in again).  Is this happening with multiple ships en route to different planets, or is this just one ship that it reliably happens to? And if it's just the one then when you go back to the quicksave are you already on the trajectory that results in the collision, or is the save pre-burn?  If your save is with the ship already on the pseudo-collision trajectory then I'm thinking that if you just nudge the ship's trajectory a tiny bit with some RCS before starting the warp you might avoid whatever weird circumstance is causing this.  Lastly, if you're not using any mods then please consider making a copy of that quicksave and filing a bug report! I would love to see the cause identified and stamped out.  Oh, and if you're using Steam then you might try verifying the game cache (right-click KSP in your library, choose Properties, select the Local Files tab, then click ""Verify Integrity..."").  edit: quicksave/autosave"

KerbalAcademy,3bp0ip,TakingSente,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:02:12 2015 UTC,it is described as having no use for reentry in the description. It has a crash tolerance of 6m/s (compare to 14 for mk1 and 45 for the mk2 capsule) like the science lab.

KerbalAcademy,3bp0ip,gigabyte898,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"there is nothing stopping You from using two mk1-2 on top of each other or another mk1 if You just need 4 kerbal total or add a  mk2 lander can (+2 kerbals but 8 m/s crash tolerance).  Other choices are more parachutes (a lot more), there is a unfortunately a bit out of date calculator http://ksp.freeiz.com/  Other options are landing on land with legs, and a semi powered landing with parachutes doing most of the work and a engine (Your orbit engine or maybe a thrust limited launch escape tower) used in the last seconds to get the speed down below Your target.   All in all if You are lazy just slap some mk2 together and deal with the increased weight and if You want a challenge design a bit more complicated lander that can slow down just above ground."

If it's interplanetary, you may have to aerobrake or otherwise slow down to LKO speeds.  Is this a 1.0.3 issue?  Do you have drogue chutes?"

If you use normal parachutes sometimes they will rip you apart because they slow down too quickly, or the 'semi-deployed' will not slow you down as much as you need.  Drogue chutes are better than regular chutes semi-deployed, but worse than regular chutes when fully deployed. So typically you use them first, high up, slow down with them partially deployed and then use your normal chutes after you've reached a reasonable speed and altitude later on."

KerbalAcademy,3bp0ip,HATECELL,2,Sat Jul 4 04:10:31 2015 UTC,"It's not too late to save the kerbals in orbit!  First you need to conserve the electricity. Make the smallest burn you can. Turn retrograde and bring your periapsis down to about 35 km and TURN OFF SAS AND ENGINE. It will show you will still be in orbit, but once you get around 40 km kerbin's atmosphere will start to slow you down. If you are having problems keeping the capsule stable facing retrograde turn on SAS in short bursts by holding F. If your center of mass isnt too top heavy you shouldn't have to make too many corrections. Once you get around 2km deploy the parachutes. If you can, try to land on the capsule, not the hitchhiker. IIRC it has a higher crash tolerance. By making the smallest burn you should have some fuel left. Right before touch down fire the engines full power by pressing Z. If you can't do either of those things (rotating capsule and extra burn), don't worry about it. Hopefully the kerbonauts will land safe, albeit shaken up, and you won't have to notify their next of kin of an ""Uncontrolled descent resulting in a big boom"""
KerbalAcademy,3bnqna,Ezotericy,3,Tue Jun 30 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"There is no strategy for this that works across the board.  If your ship has fuel left, you obviously have some room for error, and if it has air breathing engines, than even more so.    However if you are have little fuel left, then yeah shoot for a periapsis over KSC around 25-30km and the atmosphere should help bring you down.  But in the end, flying skill will get you on the ground safely and nothing more."
KerbalAcademy,3bnqna,HODOR00,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:00:12 2015 UTC,I figured there might be too many variables. I've just been testing it over and over trying to find a good place to deorbit from 100km and what angle should I pitch on reentry.

KerbalAcademy,3bnqna,gigabyte898,2,Tue Jun 30 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"Well the the likeliest issue is simple flying skill.  Aim for about the 25-30 Pe.  Make sure you Ap is not higher than 80k.  I have to be honest, I have not played the latest update which made re-entry a much different animal, however if you arent blowing up, that should not be the issue.

KerbalAcademy,3bnqna,featherwinglove,3,Tue Jun 30 20:44:30 2015 UTC,I just landed at KSC after about 15 attempts. After using the trajectories mod to help me plan my deorbit burn. I enter at about 20° from the horizon(~30° from prograde) Woo!!
KerbalAcademy,3bnqna,TakingSente,2,Tue Jun 30 20:42:49 2015 UTC,"Damn, I'd make a video to help but I'm about 400km away from my PC. I'll try to explain as well as I can through text.  What I do is plant 2 flags, one on each end of the runway. Jump back to the ksc and do that to mark the east and west approach. Now go back to the plane and lower your orbit to about 35 km just to the left of the ksc kinda on the shores between the land and water. The game will tell you you'll still be in orbit, but the atmosphere will slow you down. Make sure you landing gear is up if something goes wrong they will be the first to go, and I don't reccomended landing without wheels.   Time accelerate until it stops you. It will bring you back to 1x when you get close to the atmosphere, keep you nose up 10° when that happens. Soon you will see the shock heating, go to the orbit map. Your goal is to try to make the farthest point on your orbit curve that touches kerbin to be near the ksc. If it is too far out raise the nose to slow down, if it is not close enough pitch down to speed up.   One you get fairly close you will see the flag markers. Target the one closest to you and switch the navball to target view. The two thing you want to focus on are your periapsis marker and your target marker. If your periapsis marker is at the same place the target one is you will land perfectly at the end of the runway. To move the periapsis move the plane in opposite directions. For example, if you want to move the periapsis marker left, turn right. Keep the targets aligned and lower the gear.  Once you are over the runway flare the nose up the bleed off any excess speed, land on the back landing gear, and apply the brakes. Congrats, you are safely on kerbin!"
KerbalAcademy,3bm6ip,bluepepper,7,Tue Jun 30 10:01:03 2015 UTC,"The atmospheric delta v figure in KER is based on the atmospheric performance of the engine. I presume that's based at sea level.  When you launch, you're launching from a few dozen meters above sea level so the total delta v will be slightly different.  But you can ignore all that and just look at the non-atmospheric delta v by adjusting your target delta v. So for a launch from Kerbin, aim for ~3500 m/s and that'll cover it.  The most important information for building rockets is thrust to weight and delta v. Your launch stages only need sufficient TWR, any more and you're wasting weight by going for a bigger engine. I aim for a starting TWR of 1.3 which rises to around 2.0 before the first stage runs out.  Do the same with the stage above, an upper stage doesn't even need a TWR of 1.0 if you use the first stage to launch it on a high enough trajectory that it has time to build up speed. So again, you can use a smaller engine, which means less weight right the way through. In space, technically you can get by with an infinitely small TWR, but anything below 0.3 gets tiresome."
KerbalAcademy,3bm6ip,number2301,4,Tue Jun 30 11:36:31 2015 UTC,"But you can ignore all that and just look at the non-atmospheric delta v by adjusting your target delta v. So for a launch from Kerbin, aim for ~3500 m/s and that'll cover it.   It's important to look at atmospheric numbers when launching, since some engines (like the Terrier and Poodle) have really, really bad ISP and thrust in atmosphere.  3500 m/s in vacuum could be something like 500 m/s in atmosphere."
KerbalAcademy,3bm6ip,bendvis,3,Tue Jun 30 16:11:58 2015 UTC,"Yes fair point, although that can be summed up as don't use upper stage engines for launch."

KerbalAcademy,3bm6ip,wcoenen,3,Tue Jun 30 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"To check the delta-v that is available or consumed by a maneuver, you can also calculate it without any mods. You need only 3 numbers:   the Isp (specific impulse) of the engine expressed in seconds. This is available in the engine stats in the VAB. the mass m1 of the vehicle before the burn the mass m2 of the vehicle after the burn   The expended delta-v in m/s is then Isp * 9.82 * ln(m1/m2) where ln is the natural logarithm.  Maneuvers can be simulated in the VAB by emptying fuel tanks and looking at the mass in the vehicle statistics. The disadvantage of this is that I sometimes forget to fill them again.  Things do get more complicated if there are engines with different specific impulse burning at the same time, and burning out at different times (e.g. solid boosters + liquid fueled core)."
KerbalAcademy,3bm6ip,stampylives,0,Tue Jun 30 10:07:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the formula.  At the moment I'm collecting my delta-v in an Excel sheet (in an attempt to measure an average for each manoeuvre) so it might be sustainable to integrate the formula into my excel sheed.
KerbalAcademy,3bm6ip,stampylives,3,Tue Jun 30 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"The different number in atmosphere is not for drag, it is because engines have different fuel efficiencies in atmosphere and in vacuum. In thicker air, the same rocket will use same fuel per second, but produce less thrust.  If you want to measure the starting and ending ""raw"" Δv while you are still in the atmosphere, you are going to have to break out a calculator -- the Δv displays in flight are for the current situation. But, if you just want to measure your Δv to orbit, you can subtract your Δv once you reach orbit (since you are in a vacuum, it will display the ""raw"" Δv) from the Δv shown in the VAB.  Any maneuver that starts and ends in orbit, you can just use the in-flight readouts.  The selection of body doesn't affect Δv; it is used to calculate TWR, which is pretty important if you want to land. Without using an atmosphere (parachutes, wings), if your TWR ≤ 1, you are going to explode -- gravity will be stronger than your engines. You need to select a body to get a good read on this, since obviously you need a lot more thrust to land on Duna than on Minmus.  (note to self: attach kerbal to winch, attempt soft landing of attached capsule on Minmus using EVA fuel only)."

Ah but of course!  I think I knew that but forgot.  Wait, does that mean the delta-v of not only the current stage, but also upper stages actually changes as you leave the atmosphere?  That would explain oddities such as reaching orbit in an apparent 1000m/s delta-v.  Okay, I think I need to try some stuff here.  I already knew how to use TWR and it allowed me to make my landers lighter by not overpowering them.  So I guess my only remaining problem is that the KER readings are corrected for an atmosphere.  That makes sense since the raw delta-v would produce very different results depending on the engines, but it makes it difficult to to measure how much of it is used for an ascent.  Hmm, I'll have to think about this.  Thanks for the help!  Edit: wait, one more question: KER comes with two parts (Engineer Chip and ER7500) that you can add to rockets so that you can have the information in flight, I believe.  What's the difference between the two parts?  And you don't need them if you have an Engineer on board?  Or a sufficiently upgraded tracking station?  I'm not sure of any of that."

In general, if you shoot for a sea-level delta-V of about 3,200 m/s and keep a thrust-to-weight ratio over 1.5, you'll be going to space today.

Edit: I return, armed with better info.   You're missing a few things you need.  Without taking into account the the longitude of the ascending node your orbit may be rotated around the planet from where it should be.  The true anomaly is the angular deviation from the imaginary line represented by the argument of periapsis.  With that, you can derive the position in radial coordinates and from there go to Cartesian.   It's worth mentioning that you could simply make a small plugin that exports the orbit.pos value from ksp directly, which is already calculated."

The problem is that I haven't been able to find an algorithm to convert the orbital angles and vectors to XYZ coordinates on the orbit.  The algorithm I linked to in the op almost works,  but the resulting orbit is a bit off (too much off to be caused by rounding errors or anything like that). I suspect that there's a similar equation that could be used to correctly determine the coordinates, but unfortunately I haven't been able to find a working algorithm yet.  Regarding your edit:  The algorithm from the link in the op does use the longitude of the ascending node in the equations, but I have no idea if it's used correctly. I have no idea how to derive the position in radial coordinates, but now that I know what to google I might be more successful! I've tried finding a way of going directly to cartesian coordinates, but I guess that may not be the correct way of doing it.  Regarding the orbit.pos value, do you know how this is calculated in KSP?"
KerbalAcademy,3bmedw,TMarkos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know the particulars, but every SoI in the game has its origin point at the center of the reference body.  The vessel has an orbit object bound to it, and that orbit object has properties that describe it's current xyz position, velocity, etc.  There are also methods to obtain the universal position, which is calculated with respect to Kerbol.   You might check the source code for RasterPropMonitor, as there is a 2d orbital display screen in that mod.  Some of their code for that portion may prove instructional."

KerbalAcademy,3bmedw,fibonatic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:15:03 2015 UTC,"First, break the problem into parts. Solve the problem for a planar ellipse centered on the origin, with the major axis along the X axis -- or some other positioning to keep the problem simple. This gets rid of a lot of those variables, for your first step.  Then, you will need to translate and rotate the simply positioned orbit into the reference frame you want.  Unfortunately, the first step is not as simple as one might think -- there is not a closed form for position as a function of time (afaik). There are probably many ways to go about it, but at some point, you will need to numerically solve some form of Kepler's equation to convert from mean anomaly to true anomaly.  There are many ways to solve this numerically; Newton's method is probably a good starting reference.  Once you've solved for the position in the simple planar reference frame, you'll need to translate and rotate that point to the actual reference frame. If you need a reference for what the various parameters mean, Wikipedia's orbital elements page is pretty decent; and if you need help on the transformations, the transformation matrix page is a bit more obtuse, but may at least serve as a starting point.  Just so it doesn't throw you too far afield if you are new to the transformation matrices, you are going to want to use 4-dimensional vectors and matrices, with the 4th component of a position set to 1.  Hopefully thats helpful -- I know its certainly far from complete, and it may be all things you know already; maybe the part you are stuck at is just that there isn't a closed-form equation for position by time.  (edit) there are many ways to do all that, and many sources to read. i am by no means any sort of expert, and this is really meant as a starting point."

Start turning lower and just a few degrees at a time, and keep turning as you get higher so you're almost horizontal by the time your apoapsis is passing 70km. Watch your prograde marker and don't try to turn more than 5-10 degrees away from it either, how much you can get away with depends on the stability if your rocket.  If that alone doesn't help then let me know specifically what part of your ascent things go wrong at and what's happening (flipping over at 12km, engine exploding at 16km, etc).

When I go to store that data in the capsule will it overwrite the data from the lowlands?
KerbalAcademy,3bkw8v,Eric_S,4,Tue Jun 30 03:58:10 2015 UTC,"What /u/Eric_S said.  Something else that's not well-known: after each crew report, take reports  from the capsule, then store them right back in.  This will allow you to perform multiple crew reports in the same mission.  This is because the capsule works as both a sensor for crew report and a storage space for any report.  The sensor part can only contain one report at a time, like any other sensor, while the storage space can contain many reports (but not identical ones).  By taking reports from the capsule then putting them back in, you're moving the crew report from the sensor part to the storage part, freeing the sensor part for another crew report."
KerbalAcademy,3bkw8v,Eric_S,2,Tue Jun 30 09:40:21 2015 UTC,"Excellent point, I didn't even think to mention that, and I like the distinction you made between sensor part and storage."
KerbalAcademy,3bkw8v,merv243,4,Tue Jun 30 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"No.  The capsule can hold one of each unique result for experiments.  For example, an EVA report gives one unique result in space high over a celestial body, but a different unique result for each biome in space just over that biome.  So if you mine Minmus EVA reports, you'll come back with 9 landed reports, 9 ""in space just over"" something, and one ""in space high over Minmus.""  There may be a limit to the number of reports capsules can hold, but I regularly return from Minmus with over 50 results, so it's not a small number."

KerbalAcademy,3bj09y,ulikel,11,Mon Jun 29 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"Might help to see a screenshot of your ship, but in general:  Shallow reentry. Coming in at 3km/s? Aim for 35km peri. This will allow you to slow down in the upper atmo before you get to the denser lower atmo and be destroyed.  Make sure your ship is stable towards the heat shield, as in, make sure the heat shield stays aimed at prograde so it can absorb the heat. Anything hanging off the sides or that swings into the airstream might bake off.  Those are the two main tips. What method are you trying now? Post a picture of your ship. There's lots here who love to help with this kinda stuff."

KerbalAcademy,3bj09y,JThoms,6,Mon Jun 29 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"To add to OC's suggestions if you are still moving too fast when you deploy your chures they essentially just get ripped off your ship.   Radiators and the heat shield are a great way of preventing overheat. But this doesnt help when you are burning up for almost a minute because your descent was too steep. Shallower descent allows you to slow down enough so you aren't burning for that long and so that you are alow enough to deploy your chutes.  I've noticed that if you still see that ""airstream"" effect then your chutes will not work. Just before the effect dies down and just after you will be safe to deploy."
KerbalAcademy,3bj09y,leekeegan,2,Mon Jun 29 22:45:33 2015 UTC,"To add to the part about chutes, if you right click on the parachute part it will tell you whether or not it is safe to open it in the dialogue box."

KerbalAcademy,3bj09y,infinity_minus_1,2,Mon Jun 29 23:29:13 2015 UTC,"Also to add to OC's advice of shallower reentry, I had to completely change my reentry habits. Typically on the mk I command pod, I would have the mk 16 parachute and two radial chutes (just in case). When I came in steeper than 30km periapsis, my radial chutes would burn off.  Prior to 1.0.4, I would aim for Kerbin with a periapsis of 0m since reentry heat was essentially negligible after a heat shield was installed. Since the update, I don't think I've attempted reentry unless my periapsis was above 35km (once I figured out what was going on). With that being said, reentry now takes close to ten minutes instead of 30 seconds; it's much more nerve-racking and adds a lot more enjoyment to the game.  I still have a hard time slowing down enough to safely open the chutes AND maintaining enough altitude for the parachutes to slow me down before violently crashing into the ground. I've learned to come to LKO before attempting reentry, and also aiming for the ocean next to KSC instead of accidentally landing in the mountains (where the chutes don't open quick enough to slow you down)."

KerbalAcademy,3bgfww,Cannotholdme,14,Mon Jun 29 00:26:51 2015 UTC,"There are dozens of different ways of building a rover - just google ""ksp rover"" and you'll find some cool images. Here are some examples - a good looking typical rover, a larger fancier rover, and an ultra minimalist rover. Here's my favorite rover of my own design, first on Duna and again on Ike. It's built around the old Mk1 inline cockpit and powered by RTGs - a great little performer!  A quick checklist of what you need   four wheels a probe core batteries solar panels and/or RTGs or fuel cells some kind of structural frame a delivery mechanism (see below) (optional) science equipment and an antenna (optional) some kind of reaction wheel for stability/control (optional) RCS for even more stability/control (optional) a command chair or capsule for manned rovers (optional) lights for night driving. (optional) a docking port for parking at bases.   Some quick tips   Keep your center of mass low to the ground. Basically, the rover should look flat. Test your rover on Kerbin extensively first, but bear in mind that some bodies will be much less forgiving. Switch to docking controls (bottom left hand corner of the screen) when using a rover. This will stop your rover trying to rotate itself, and will tell it to translate forward/backward/left/right instead. By default, the ""B"" key controls brakes, and all wheels will brake simultaneously. This can make your rover flip happy. Best to disable front brakes (just delete them from the ""Brakes"" action group). You can probably disable the motor and/or steering on the back wheels. Leaving them on doesn't really improve performance and makes the rover more finicky to steer. You can use RCS to help stabilize the rover. Any of the wheels will do, but personally I'm a fan of the TR-2L Ruggedized Vehicular Wheels and Rovemax Model 1M. The rover body structural part is just one kind of part you can use for rovers. But really, anything you can mount wheels on is fine. For example, you can build an ""H"" shape with three girders and attach wheels to the four corners. For manned rovers, I'm a personal fan of using the Mk1 inline cockpit as a core!   Delivery methods   There are a few options for delivery. On Duna, Eve, Kerbin, or Laythe, you can just use parachutes (but pack plenty!). Another option would be a sky crane - basically, a small final stage that typically has radial engines and can deposit the rover on the ground. It then flies away leaving the rover free to move. Here's a super fancy, mod heavy version of this, but anything that can drop off a rover and then fly away will do the trick! A final option - my favorite - is to just stick a couple of fuel tanks with radial engines either side of the rover on radial decouplers. The rover can then serve as its own skycrane, basically hovering till it hits the ground, and then decoupling the tanks. There are lots of other ingenious ways to deliver rovers, so searching the subreddits is a good way to get ideas!   One final advanced tip (and the only things that's REALLY screwed me up) - if you're using Remotetech, make sure you have a hard antenna in place when landing on atmospheric bodies; anything that collapses under aerodynamic stress will result in an incommunicative little rover :("
KerbalAcademy,3bgfww,Doglatine,3,Mon Jun 29 01:44:03 2015 UTC,"That RT landing complication you ran into was what wound up getting me into kOS at first and makes for a fun little project; if you're going with the simple parachute landing you can fire your deorbit burn, arm your parachutes, then run a kOS script that packs up your soft antenna then automatically redeploys it once the rover has touched down. Or if you want to get really fancy you can script a complete controlled descent..."

I'm still a bit new and I'd been stabilizing my rovers with SAS set to 'radial' and sometimes a bit of RCS, but that's been perilous on anything but gentle terrain. This should help!  Quick question (for anyone): Is it very feasible to drive a rover from biome to biome collecting science? I'm finding it incredibly tedious on the Mun, but then I haven't unlocked the top-tier wheels yet. Using small rockets seems a much better use of my time, but those quickly run out of fuel unless I haul a massive ISRU converter and drills.

You time things so the Ap happens when the place you want to serve. Things move a lot slower at Ap, so it spends a lot of time moving slowly over your served area, then races around the back side of the planet at Pe to get back into position. With a few satellites, you can sort of get geostationary orbit style coverage at high latitudes (arctic), where a real geostationary satellite would be too low to the horizon to use.  A Molniya orbit is a specific kind of Tundra orbit, the specifics of which I don't remember off the top of my head. It's named for a series of Russian communications satellites that serve their high arctic (and the Molniya rocket that launched them, which is a slightly modified Soyuz).  I suppose a Kolniya orbit is a Molniya orbit in the Kerbal universe."

This was used by the USSR for communications as the high apoapsis would allow the satellite to get a lot of time over the USSR, before quickly falling down to the periapsis. The satellites would be in a 3 hour orbit, so it would be over the USSR twice a day.   If you want to see what it looks like, search ""Molniya Orbit"" on Wikipedia and you should find it. I'd link it, but I'm on my phone right now :)   I also got all that information from the Wikipedia page, so I might have interpreted it wrong."

If I drag out a lander can, I am able to attach either end of that can to the decoupler.  If I add a fuel tank to the landing can, now I can only attach the free node of the can.

After a quick look at the craft I'm thinking it might need a little more in the way of lifting surfaces so it can attain a higher altitude on jet engines alone. Higher altitude should translate to higher speed with the reduction in atmospheric drag (which may also necessitate more air intakes), reducing the amount of thrust needed from the rockets to get you clear of the atmosphere entirely."

Lifting surfaces (wings, body, etc.) generate lift as air moves past them. If you have two aircraft moving at the same speed, the one with more lifting surface (bigger wings) will generate more lift. As you get higher in the atmosphere there is less air, so the amount of lift generated is reduced. Eventually you get up to a point where there is so little air that the amount of lift being generated isn't enough to overcome gravity pulling you back down, so your plane can't go any higher. Going back to those two planes I mentioned, the one with more lifting surface will get to a higher altitude before it can't go any higher.  More lifting surface on your spaceplane will get it higher into the atmosphere, and while you've got less air to create lift you also have less air slowing you down with drag, so your plane should be able to go faster at the higher altitude (as long as the engines can actually run that fast).  The higher and faster you can get on jet engines alone the less fuel your rocket engines need to use to get you so high that there's no air left to slow you down and so fast that when you fall back down you miss."

Keep a high orbit, as it'll make the plane changes cheaper.    Eyeball the orbit and find either the Ascending or Descending node.  The way to do this with no target selected is to find the viewpoint where both your orbit and the target orbit appear flattened because you're looking at them edge-on.  The point on your orbit that appears in front of the target orbit is your node you're going to burn from.  Make a maneuver node there and adjust the normal axis (pink triangles) until your projected orbit is on the same plane as the target.  You may have to adjust your prograde/retrograde handles a bit to keep from ejecting from the sphere of influence.  Next, draw a line out from Duna through either the periapsis or apoapsis of the target orbit to your orbit.  At this location, burn retrograde until your orbit touches the target orbit.  Once you're at your new periapsis, burn again until you're lined up with the target orbit."

It can be calibrated in knots, feet per minute (101.333 ft/min = 1 kn) or metres per second, depending on country and type of aircraft.  In powered flight the pilot makes frequent use of the VSI to ascertain that level flight is being maintained, especially during turning maneuvers. In gliding, the instrument is used almost continuously during normal flight, often with an audible output, to inform the pilot of rising or sinking air. It is usual for gliders to be equipped with more than one type of variometer. The simpler type does not need an external source of power and can therefore be relied upon to function regardless of whether a battery or power source has been fitted. The electronic type with audio needs a power source to be operative during the flight. The instrument is of little interest during launching and landing, with the exception of aerotow, where the pilot will usually want to avoid releasing in sink.

In practice, doing both at once is more effective. Since the angle between those is 90°, you can just interpret that as the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle:  >>> Kerbin.surface_velocity * sqrt(2) 246.82783532641827   So you would need about 247 m/s more Δv. 300 m/s was close enough.

KerbalAcademy,3bc3f5,krenshala,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:18:28 2015 UTC,The arrow points at the part of the craft being dropped when it detaches.  This means you usually want the arrow pointing toward the root-part/command-pod.

KerbalAcademy,3b9po5,JamesPoulton,6,Sat Jun 27 03:21:02 2015 UTC,"Take a look at this.  Once you get the CoL/Com balance down, I recommend you configure your control surfaces w/ your tail surfaces as elevators (pitch), the tips of your main wings as ailerons (roll), and your tail surface(s) as your rudder (yaw). If your wings are near your CoM, you can also have an inner set of control surfaces for use as deployable flaps."
KerbalAcademy,3b9po5,taofd,5,Sat Jun 27 06:29:26 2015 UTC,Turn on COM and COL and put COM just ahead of COL.  Other than that building like a real aircraft generally works now.

If pitch control is fine for you than nevermind. Some dihedral (point the tips up) would help give you roll stability. If you find that you have poor yaw stability than putting two vertical stabilizers at an angle outward would give you yaw and roll stability, and it would increase your pitch authority to boot. If you do that than disable pitch on the wing ailerons and have the tail elevons to pitch and yaw. This is probably the simplest solution that will have the largest impact."

Mount your rear wheels out on the wings for better stability.  (The spacing of COM and COL in your second picture is about right.) Now, get a pair of winglets, and place them at the front of the plane to get that approximate spacing of COM/COL.   And you should be good to go."
KerbalAcademy,3b9po5,KerbalEssences,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:24:36 2015 UTC,Assign functions to your control surfaces. Your pitch controls should always be those most distant from your CoM. To keep the nose up without SAS you can simply rotate the engine so the thrust points a little below the CoM. This lifts the nose up automatically without you having to steer. The same effect you get from putting your engines below the wings like passenger planes usually do.
KerbalAcademy,3b9po5,nikidash,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"You lack horizontal stabilizers (the horizontal mini wings on the tail of most planes). Without them you won't be able to control pitch. Also I'd move the wings back, the center of lift and center of drag are really close."

KerbalAcademy,3b8gfa,2silverseas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:01:30 2015 UTC,"100km is a good height for a parking orbit. As for time to apoapsis are you referring to how long it says it will take to get there from the time you stop burning? If so the time to apoapsis is determined more by how much thrust you have. If you have a lot of thrust you will reach the speed needed to get to 100km much sooner and hence coast for a much greater portion of the trip. If you have lower thrust you may need to keep the engines on all the way to apoapsis so you can get the speed you need for orbit.  If, on the other hand, you are referring to how long it takes to reach apoapsis from the launch pad you either have ungodly amounts of thrust or you are not tipping your rocket over soon enough (in other words going up to straight). You want to start pointing your rocket east pretty much as soon as you get off the pad. By the time you reach 10,000 meters you should be tilted about 45 degrees."

What we have there is the hitchhiker's cabin with two rechargeable batters and mono-propellant tank topped with a Docking Port Jr.  The other vessel is the science lab with a Docking Port Jr on the bottom.  Both ports are in contact, one vessel has electricity (the Hitchhiker's which is on the right) whilst the other doesn't, both are controlled with a mechjeb, but I right clicked on the docking port and said control from here and targeted the other port.

KerbalAcademy,3b7p84,TMarkos,2,Fri Jun 26 20:34:45 2015 UTC,"The Jr's have a very weak magnetic pull.  For a vessel like you described it's likely they will take longer to find a lockable configuration than if you were using the larger ports.  Just be patient, turn SAS off and let them shimmy around a bit.    I normally use the orient to target prograde in the mechjeb controls, then scale back to simple attitude hold (normal SAS) for the last 10m or so, then finally turn that off right before contact.  Target prograde gets really wobbly as you get close to the port.  Another trick is that you can have both mechjeb vessels point target prograde to each other for easy alignment - just make sure to turn it off when you're closer."

KerbalAcademy,3b68h0,FaceDeer,2,Fri Jun 26 15:08:28 2015 UTC,Extensive revamp of the thermal system. Makes reentry angle much more important - steep reentries are extremely deadly. Added a variety of radiator panel parts. Fixed the memory leak in the overheat indicators.  There's a changelist you can dig up for more details.

KerbalAcademy,3b64dn,Cannotholdme,7,Fri Jun 26 07:35:59 2015 UTC,"Given your current career level (going by date/other missions on offer/etc), I'd just give this contract a miss.  It's a stupid test for an awkward part in an inconvenient place. (You may not even currently have the technology available that you'll need to lift a huge booster (even empty, it's going to be a pain) to Munar orbit.)  Neither the money nor the science make it worth doing. Satellite launches should pay just as well, and will give much less aggravation."
KerbalAcademy,3b64dn,Ebirah,6,Fri Jun 26 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"Are you asking what the contract means, or how to build a rocket that pulls it off?  If you're asking how to pull it off - note that you can empty the fuel out of an SRB in the VAB to make it MUCH lighter."
KerbalAcademy,3b64dn,asaz989,3,Fri Jun 26 07:44:08 2015 UTC,"The latter. I have no idea how to get a huge SRB to the moon  Also, don't I need to activate the engine? How can I do that if there's no fuel?"
KerbalAcademy,3b64dn,asaz989,7,Fri Jun 26 07:46:00 2015 UTC,"As long as it hasn't been activated before, it should still activate. If there's no fuel it just won't generate any thrust.  So, emptying out the fuel first, you get a dry mass of 4.5T, which is big but not too bad. The real annoyance is how tall and skinny it is, and how you can't attach stuff under it. My first approach would probably involve fuel tanks on top with some radial-attachment engines, to keep the center of mass forward."
KerbalAcademy,3b64dn,catsfive,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:10:56 2015 UTC,"Just a side question, but, just imagine what would be needed to re-fill an SRB on the moon for any kind of legitimate use."

You just need to stage the part by creating a new stage, stick the part in it, and putting it above the last stage fired.   So in theory you could use the Kickback to get to the Mun, put the spent Kickback into a new stage, and then activate the stage with the empty rocket at the appropriate altitude once you arrive and complete the contract."
KerbalAcademy,3b64dn,cantab314,4,Fri Jun 26 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"I think the test will be considered complete with no fuel. But feel free to put the minimum amount of fuel in if you want a ""proper"" test. It will still be a reasonably light thing and being a single part it's completely rigid, which helps you deal with the large size.  You could stick it on top of a regular launcher with the required delta-V to chuck its mass at the Mun. If that gives trouble I'd instead put it between two launcher stacks."
KerbalAcademy,3b64dn,Peewee223,2,Fri Jun 26 12:45:05 2015 UTC,"(Unless it's been fixed recently) You don't actually need to activate it, you just need to stage to it for the contract. You can use it for thrust then drag it around in the stage order once it's empty to stage to it again. It feels really powergamey to do though..."
KerbalAcademy,3b64dn,Minotard,6,Fri Jun 26 10:41:45 2015 UTC,"Start with with a probe core.  Put the SRB next and empty it, the empty shell will be the core of your vessel.  Use x6 symmetry, starting from the top of the SRB and build liquid fuel tanks and engines around the empty SRB.  Even make a few stages if you are feeling ballsy.  Edit: I hate typing on phones"

KerbalAcademy,3b5hri,jellyman93,6,Fri Jun 26 03:36:59 2015 UTC,"On a related note, I would recommend you design your completed space station in the VAB first.   You can set out the entire thing with all the different bits and pieces you need.  You could also use this to ensure that the Kerbals can move around the way you want, by simply supporting the entire structure with launch clamps and just have it sit there on the launch pad. When you're satisfied the design works, you can work out how you want to slice it up into multiple payloads and where to put the docking ports necessary."
KerbalAcademy,3b5hri,bibbit123,2,Fri Jun 26 07:01:26 2015 UTC,As others have said kerbals can move anywhere within a ship.

Your first space station will become a laggy beast.   But it will take longer to do so if you try to keep it minimal.

KerbalAcademy,3b5hri,GumboFrames,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:38:08 2015 UTC,I believe that you can transfer kerbals from any pod or module to any other as long as they are on the same craft. Even through things that seem like they shouldn't let a kerbal through like I-Beams or or tiny docking ports.

KerbalAcademy,3b5jj5,RumAndCookies,4,Fri Jun 26 04:46:57 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it a bit more, I may have been premature in asking about the parts anyway. From the images of the broken ships it looks like they did somehow get separated into individual entities at some point, but if you can't switch between them with the [ and ] hotkeys then I would suspect they're broken not just in the ""two pieces"" sense but in the ""bad data"" sense. If that's the case, there could still be a mod to blame; I've only experienced completely inexplicable disassembly like this once myself, and it was on a pretty mod-heavy career that I abandoned shortly after when the weirdness spread.  If you have an earlier save to roll back to that's probably your best bet. If you don't have a save to go back to, you may want to see if you can terminate the broken ships to minimize the chance of any badness living on in your persistence file. The most extreme option is to try to edit reassembled ships back into your persistent.sfs file, but that's getting into territory I'm not sure I'd be comfortable trying to advise anyone on."
KerbalAcademy,3b5jj5,avaratzz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:37:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't switch between them with [ and ] so i figured the game is still treating it as one vessel. Just the one part is not where the rest of the ship is. Luckily, the probe is on a collision course for Duna. So I started some ""research"" into the problem. I time warped until it was quite close and found this. also note that during time warp, the ship appears normal. Unfortunately, I'm playing on hard mode so I don't have any saves to fall back on. HOWEVER, a while back I switch to using CKAN and made a copy of my game as a back up. I just booted that up and got a NaN error with just the skybox when I switched to my probe.  This also confirmed that it didn't have to do with the recent update as this was 1.0.2 version    I'll look into uninstalling mods to see what happens, but it looks like I may have to let Jeb float onwards into the emptyness of space."

KerbalAcademy,3b5rr1,SixInchesAtATime,4,Fri Jun 26 04:58:47 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you may have accidentally used the shrouds (non-decoupling structural parts) instead of the normal fairings (decoupling aerodynamic parts). If you have the normal fairings they should have an icon in your staging list to show which stage they'll decouple in.  If you're not in the position to go back and do the launch over again after correcting the fairings, you may be able to get at the decoupler's right-click menu by zooming the camera in so close that it goes through the fairings. This may end up being somewhat destructive to the payload anyway, but if you're lucky it may eject through the shroud without damage."

KerbalAcademy,3b36my,Doglatine,4,Thu Jun 25 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"In my opinnion the LV-N is overkill for tylo landers except for maybe the last stage to circularize on ascent, because they add so much weight.  Doing it in single stage is a really tough design constraint.  Maybe you could have drop-tanks on docking ports for some re-usability, but doing it all in one seems very hard.  With that low of TWR it will probably take a bit more than 3k dV to land."
KerbalAcademy,3b36my,flinxsl,2,Thu Jun 25 17:43:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, in case anyone's wondering, this is still a 0.90 playthrough (not planning to start a new game till the U5 update)."
KerbalAcademy,3b36my,RumAndCookies,2,Thu Jun 25 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying that; this wouldn't be an ideal setup post-1.0 due to the LV-N tweaks.  Unfortunately I don't remember exactly how much dV I used on my last visit to Tylo, but going off the reported values you're going to be cutting it very close. If it were my ship I'd be more comfortable if I could just squeeze another 500dV in there."
KerbalAcademy,3b36my,Im_in_timeout,2,Thu Jun 25 16:53:33 2015 UTC,The LVN is not the right engine for a Tylo landing. You're losing huge amounts of Dv just from hauling around all of that engine mass. A single Skipper could replace 10 of those LVNs and yield the same thrust for far less mass and probably increase your overall Dv.
KerbalAcademy,3b36my,Im_in_timeout,3,Thu Jun 25 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"Woah. You're totally right. Check it out - an extra 100 m/s Dv, vastly reduced cost, similar starting thrust, but most importantly, a greatly improved maximum thrust.  I feel a bit chastened; 1000+ hours into the game and I assumed that a Tylo lander would be heavy, because it'd need tons of fuel, so an LV-N would be the natural choice. But it's clearly not the right engine - is that just because the payload is pretty small?"
KerbalAcademy,3b36my,Im_in_timeout,2,Thu Jun 25 19:19:53 2015 UTC,"That lander still seems rather large. It is unnecessary and wildly inefficient to haul all of that mass back up to Tylo orbit. You could improve the efficiency even more by using drop tanks. LVNs are best used for taking larger ships on inter-planetary trips. In space, you want high ISP; for lift-off and (powered) landings, you want high TWR."
KerbalAcademy,3b36my,Im_in_timeout,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I realize a multi-stage ship would be a lot more efficient. However, one of the design constraints I'm trying to work with is to use a single descent/ascent vehicle, which will mean going big. My latest version (see edit to the main post) has boosted up the DV to 6580m/s. Any further thoughts?"
KerbalAcademy,3b36my,MrBorogove,2,Thu Jun 25 19:39:17 2015 UTC,I see. The latest version looks rather nice! The low TWR isn't an issue. That will rise quickly as you burn during descent. Looks like a nice Tylo lander. Be sure to let us know how it goes.

So if you leave the physics accuracy at 1 (100%), and try to speed up to, say, 10x, but your ship has too many parts, it'll speed up as much as it can, maybe to 6x, but then cap it so the physics remains accurate.

On the other hand, the regular rocket tanks have a worse mass ratio than the jet tanks after dumping oxidizer. So none of the options feels really good.

KerbalAcademy,3b1j8k,wooq,3,Thu Jun 25 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but its not really that they are lighter, its that they have more mass of fuel per mass of the tank.    If you take an flt-800 and empty the oxidiser you have 440 units of fuel but the tank weighs .5 tons (empty - just the tank).  The mk 2 short jet fuel has 400 units of fuel and the tank weighs only .3 tons empty.  So you have 1,333 units of fuel per ton of tank mass with the jet tank, and only 880 units of fuel per ton with the rocket tank minus oxidizer.  Same logic works for all sizes."

KerbalAcademy,3b1ksx,BillOfTheWebPeople,3,Thu Jun 25 05:52:39 2015 UTC,Doing plane changes in low orbit is always super expensive. Polar to equatorial means that you need to come to a complete stop in one direction and get up to orbital speed in the other. My orbital mechanics aren't strong enough to know if there is ever a point where pushing out your apoapsis out to the edge of the SOI is bad.

The results where that you should do the inclination change directly if the angle is smaller than roughy 40° after which it is cheaper to increase your apoapsis and for angles of 60° and bigger you should raise it aw high as possible.  Now you do not have a circular orbit, but since the inclination change needed is 90° I am pretty certain that raising the apoapsis as much as possible will be the cheapest option, so to the edge of the SOI."

KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,FishBroom,9,Thu Jun 25 06:47:43 2015 UTC,"Turning in space in ksp happens thanks to reaction wheels (which exist irl although they are far less powerful). The lack of  turning power you experienced was likely due to running out of electrical power (which is required by reaction wheels).  Edit: in-game, reaction wheels are either located in crew pods or in dedicated reaction wheel parts. You can see that in the tooltips as 'provided torque' (or something close to that). The force depends on the part and you can stack the torque from several parts."
KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,vlanore,2,Thu Jun 25 06:59:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, cool. Electricity for reaction wheels is the solution. Should I have used up all my electricity when only doing a Munar flyby? Does SAS use the reaction wheels to keep me stable and hence leaving it on all mission used up my power?"
KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,vlanore,5,Thu Jun 25 08:05:24 2015 UTC,SAS indeed uses the reaction wheels for stabilization which in turn consume electricity. It does not usually consume much but it might have been enough to deplete your batteries. Another likely possibility is that you used an antenna to transmit science (which consumes a lot of electricity).
KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,Alby585,3,Thu Jun 25 08:17:01 2015 UTC,"Hah, Antennas. I only made my first orbit day before yesterday. Might look into using them sometime soon. Maybe after I figure out if I've unlocked batteries yet....  Reaction wheels makes sense. It also explains why I seem to have no control during my initial launch stage. It's not the boosters steering me, it's the reaction wheels failing to make any impact on all that mass.  Thanks. I think I understand a bit better what's going on there now :)"
KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,Alby585,5,Thu Jun 25 09:48:09 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting is that while the big rocket engines and also jet engines generate their own electricity while running, small engines don't."

KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,experts_never_lie,3,Thu Jun 25 12:35:34 2015 UTC,The VAB 'more details' section on each engine will say whether it has an alternator or not. Those with alternators generate electricity.
KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,TriTraTrololol,3,Thu Jun 25 12:39:32 2015 UTC,"In KSP there are several ways to control crafts:   reaction wheels which are easy to use but not very strong and which consume electricity; engine gimbal which gives a strong steering power but only works with certain engines and only when the engines fire; control surfaces (eg, controlable winglets) which work only in atmosphere; RCS (basically small multidirectional engines stuck on the sides of the craft) has a fairly good power/weight ratio but requires a dedicated fuel (monopropelant); RCS also allows translation (as opposed to only rotation for most steering techniques) which is very useful for precise manoeuvres  such as docking.   If you have trouble steering on launch, the easiest way is probably to stick some winglets on the bottom of your lower stage and/or to use gimballing engines. If you have trouble steering in space the easiest fixes are adding more reaction wheels and/or using RCS (RCS can be toggled on/off in flight so you can carry RCS with little fuel as an emergency control system)."
KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,featherwinglove,2,Thu Jun 25 12:30:26 2015 UTC,"/u/vlanore appears to have the explanation of what happened covered, but the way to fix it is to carry more batteries or (preferably) solar panels or more advanced ways of generating electrical power."

KerbalAcademy,3b1pcb,dyyys1,2,Thu Jun 25 23:54:44 2015 UTC,"/u/vlanore is right of course. also when you add a bit engine power you gain maneuverabilty due to the gimbaling of the engine but also because they produce electricity so you also re-gain reaction wheel authority.  as /u/experts_never_lie said, just add solar panels and add more batteries (so you can bridge the lack of sun on the dark sun of the planet/moon)."
KerbalAcademy,3b1mff,QuickBASIC,3,Thu Jun 25 06:11:15 2015 UTC,"In target mode the prograde and retrograde markers are your velocity relative to the target. When docking these are invaluable, because they let you know if you're moving towards or away from your target. When rendezvousing, you'll want to get as close as possible(less than 5KM if possible), then kill your relative velocity, then thrust toward the target(which should put your prograde on the target indicator).   Because you likely are not perfectly in front of or behind the target in its orbit, you'll find that the prograde marker moves off of the target indicator over a certain distance, which gives you a chance to correct it."

KerbalAcademy,3b1mff,krenshala,3,Thu Jun 25 06:29:18 2015 UTC,"You are changing your orbit to match that of the target when you null the 'Target' vector.  Your orbit is changing that much because you are applying the Δv needed to do so.  If you did the same maneuver without a target you would get the same change in orbit.

KerbalAcademy,3b1mff,SenorPuff,5,Thu Jun 25 06:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yep. Orbits are determined by position and velocity, which is speed and direction. Nothing else matters, if those quantities match, the orbit will match."

KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,2-4601,6,Wed Jun 24 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"These are... unconventional, to say the least.  What made you go so SRB-heavy?  Yeah, one or two can be cheaper than a fuel stack and an engine, but not when you need so many.  Also, you gain a lot of efficiency with engines, both because they are more efficient, but also because you can precisely control your ascent speed.  SRBs are best used, IMO, when you need a bit of extra thrust to get off the ground, or when you need just a touch more delta-v, but not enough to warrant a whole additional engine/stage.  Check out how simple the rocket is in this tutorial: http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_How_to_Get_into_Orbit  That costs about 5k funds, I'd guess.  You could even add a third stage with a large engine to that if you wanted, and I bet it would get you on a Mun flyby easily, still for less than 10k.  Beyond that, for heavier payloads, you could add asparagus staging, which isn't as effective as it was pre 1.0 but still works in limited quantities.  But the point is that the conventional designs are commonplace for a reason.  It looks like your upper stage (minus that heat shield craziness) is ok - one thing I used to do is add too much to my main stage (e.g. extra solar panels, batteries, RCS, and science, beyond what I needed), and that causes a ripple affect all the way down, increasing the size of each previous stage.  An example of this is planning an Eve return mission.  Just switching from a command seat to the lightest manned pod almost doubles the size of your Kerbin launch stage.  But just verify that you aren't taking anything you don't truly need."
KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,merv243,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"Wait, how did they nerf asparagus?"
KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,BobbleBobble,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:35:28 2015 UTC,"Just with the new aerodynamics.  Previously (as I understand it), the drag was basically just a single value applied against your entire craft based on the altitude (or rather, atmosphere thickness), so it didn't matter whether you had a nice sleek rocket or a wide, flat piece of garbage.  Nosecones didn't even do anything.  Now, building outwards actually noticeably impacts your craft's drag.  I haven't personally done much to see just how much it's changed, so I'm just going off what I've read.  I think one level out is still effective.  My assumption is that there is some tradeoff point between width of your rocket (aka number of asparagus stages) and aerodynamic penalty where it becomes no longer worth it, and that point is somewhere beyond maybe ~6 boosters."
KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,merv243,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, makes sense.  There's just something so oddly satisfying about stages successively dropping off an asparagus rocket that I use it in whatever situations I can :) Like a butterfly shedding its cocoon."

Let's start from the bottom up:  Stage 2 and 3:  You have SRBs connected by girders but not running at the same time.  So when your Stage 3 expires, your Stage 2 is still lifting all that empty mass.  If you don't have radial decouplers, just fire all 4 at the same time and then ditch all 4 at once.  Stage 1... you decouple the lifting stack, activate the top SRB, and... activate 3 radial parachutes.  Why??  You'll be going too fast for the chutes to open and slow you down.  If you are using the StageRecovery mod, the chutes should activate on the stage after the SRB is expended.  If not, these chutes are less than useless.  Stage 0: You're activating your engine (looks like a terrier) and 3 more chutes.  This kills the parachute on reentry.  Also the terrier is going to be difficult to circularize given that you said you are doing the inefficient Apoapsis straight up to space then circularize (you'll need about 2000m/s to circularize, which will take the Terrier about 8-10 minutes to do).  This means that a great deal of your circularization burn will have to be radial to avoid falling back to Kerbin, which means that your burn will likely cost closer to 2500 m/s.  You can use the terrier to circularize if you have done an efficient gravity turn and are already going >1200 m/s horizontally at apoapsis, but if you are not yet confident with that, you really need to use a Swivel engine to get better TWR on your circularization burn.  Your chute was probably getting burned up because you are staging it at the same time as your terrier, which means that it will open as soon as it sense atmosphere (~25000m).  You will be going supersonic at this point, so you'll get it ripped off immediately.  Your staging should be as follows:  Stage 0: Parachutes on command pod.  Heat shield on the bottom of the pod.  You say ""heat and fuel doesn't mix"", but in actuality, heat tolerance and fuel do mix.  It's difficult if not impossible to blow up your engine on re-entry from LKO.  Stage 1: Decoupler and circularization engine  (parachutes for SRB stack if using StageRecovery Only (though you're still probably losing money on this proposition.  SRBs are cheap).  Stage 2: Decoupler and top SRB.  I'd also very much suggest you change this stage to a T-800 and Swivel tank, but that's up to you.  Stage 3: All 4 base SRBs at once."

So when your Stage 3 expires, your Stage 2 is still lifting all that empty mass. If you don't have radial decouplers, just fire all 4 at the same time and then ditch all 4 at once.   There's a reason I limited the thrust coming out of those - too much meant I was hitting terminal velocity.

Stage 1... you decouple the lifting stack, activate the top SRB, and... activate 3 radial parachutes. Why?? You'll be going too fast for the chutes to open and slow you down.

This kills the parachute on reentry.    You are correct, Terrier. There's one parachute on the jettisoned booster, and the other two are one the command pod. It's true that they are not meant to arm then - I activate them on a separate stage manually after going through re-entry.     Your chute was probably getting burned up because you are staging it at the same time as your terrier, which means that it will open as soon as it sense atmosphere (~25000m). You will be going supersonic at this point, so you'll get it ripped off immediately.   As I said, that was an error. This is a revised design - the first had one nosecone chute that overheated before deployment and destroyed the vessel. Then the heatshield took up the nose spot, so I replaced the chute with two radials."

I have radial decouplers, but felt spreading the thrust out further would improve stability - and at launch velocities, that's not a bad thing.   Still better to run all 4 at the same time at a lower thrust than 3 then 1 and carrying the dead weight with you.   Those chutes are for the jettisoned lifting stack, seen on top of the three boosters in the image.   So you are using StageRecovery?  Otherwise this does nothing.  Also, according to the wiki, the full recovery value of an empty thumper SRB is 690, and each chute costs 400.  So at best you are saving 290x 4 = 1160 Kredits by doing this for your lifting stack and 290 more for the second stack.  There are fuel losses for carrying the extra mass, but probably not enough to make it a negative proposition.  Your reworked rocket looks a lot better, though I'd downgrade the nose chute to the Mk-16, as the Real Chute is a fair bit of extra mass and you really don't need so much slowing power for just a pod.  I'd also ditch the radial chute(s) attached to your command pod.  Not sure about the radial chute(s) on your upper stage fuel tank.  Assuming that it would stage after your deorbit burn, I'd think that the fuel tank would remain within the physics bubble of your pod and thus the chute might still get ripped off at 25000m.  Not sure about this though."

KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,cantab314,3,Wed Jun 24 14:21:02 2015 UTC,less is more in most cases. if you think you need to add something to the rocket remember that it is going to cost you in fuel and the whole rocket gets heavier.   Minimal designs to achieve the goals.

KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,maccollo,2,Wed Jun 24 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"SRBs offer relatively high TWR and but relatively low delta-V, meaning they often make for heavy rockets. Thrust-limiting them too much loses one of their advantages. They can still be cheap though, if well designed.  You also have blunt fronts, both on your boosters and with your heatshield placement. That's going to increase drag."
KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,featherwinglove,2,Wed Jun 24 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"Your first rocket looks fairly normal, except for the heatshield on the nose.  That may be affecting your performance, and you could probably just use your deorbiting engine as a heatshield for that.  SRBs are very cheap for their size, so it probably looks more expensive than it actually is."
KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,thisisalili,2,Wed Jun 24 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"You just want to put the capsule in orbit? Then all you need is something like this  Solids make for very cost effective first stages, but because of their lower efficiency that advantage will be lost if you use them in the upper stages.  As you can see it has no wings. Wings are expensive, and if you design and fly your rocket well, unnecessary. If you really need to use wings, use the ""basic fin"".  This rocket is so small that it can be easily control with the pod torque, however as you build larger rockets this might not be possible, such as your first example. Rather than adding expensive wings to an all solid stage it's better to use the solids to boost a liquid fuel sustainer stage, like this. https://youtu.be/OgpZuDw5dqA  Sustainers like these can throw 1 tonne to LEO per 800 funds, which is a fair bit cheaper than what I've managed to do with all liquid designs.  Most of the thrust should come from the solids, while the liquid engine provides control authority at take off.  Because liquid engines are expensive you should use the smallest possible engine to push your payload. In this case the core only has a TWR of 0.6 at booster seperation.  As others have mentioned, good piloting is obviously an important aspect to building an efficient rocket, but it is even more important when you try to push the engine cost, and thus the TWR, down."
KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,hab136,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:23:25 2015 UTC,"My latest boosters for KSP Career/Interstellar Hardcore (preset Hard plus game over on the first death of a kerbal) bear more than a passing resemblance to the design in a 0.8.4 tutorial.  Radially mounted RT-10s or BACCs are good for lifting off because a) they save a part vs. an engine and a tank (important with the Level 1 VAB), b) they're cheap and c) they provide a wide base for your vehicle to sit on the pad, lest it fall over.  The best engines for a second stage are the LV-T45 and the Skipper for their combination of thrust vector gimbaling and decent Isp.  The best engines for the third stage, if you're going into deep space and not just LEO, are the LV-909 and Poodle.  I've had good experience with two types of LEO boosters: One that uses a cluster of RT-10 motors in the first stage and the LV-T45 in the second stage.  It's expensive, but it's low-tech and gets the job done early in the game.  The second type uses an LV-T30 fin-stabilized first stage that gets going fast enough and high enough to switch back and recover (recommend two aft-mounted Mk2R parachutes set to 0.4, 400m; far enough forward that the vehicle will still land tail down; too far forward and it will derotate fast enough to break parts), while the second uses an LV-909 engine with a single T400 tank.  That type of vehicle with a pair of Mk.2R parachutes and a ball probe core on top is excellent for LEO tourism grind and rescue contracts.  On entry heatshields: My experience has shown that they are not necessary for LEO entries, especially if you have a craft stable engine first (engines can take a lot of heat and have been used as heatshields since DR first came out two years ago.)  The Ablator has a mass of 0.2t so once you're going fast enough (returning from the Mun or further), you can offload a bunch in the VAB to save mass.  I usually dump my last stage because a) I have a phobia about tall vehicles falling over and killing the crew and b) an LV-909 and its tank are too cheap to bother recovering separately (...and c) I have neither the technology or VAB parts capacity for landing gear in my current game.)"

KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,kyarmentari,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that you want to avoid the atmosphere, so punch out of there first so you are free to reach orbital velocities without it?  EDIT: Because of the lower specific impulse there."
KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,kyarmentari,2,Wed Jun 24 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"The atmosphere may technically extend to 70 km, but the bulk of the air is down low. In other words, you don't have to go 50% of the way up to see a 50% reduction in drag forces - it'll happen a lot sooner than 35 km.   So a good ascent profile will be mostly (but not entirely!) vertical at first, but your main job in reaching orbit is achieving 2000+ m/sec of horizontal velocity. (Look at real-world rocket launches. They turn towards horizontal very very early in the ascent.) You should tip 5° east by 500m altitude, then aim to be close to a 45° by 10km, then on to 75 or 80° as you pass 30 km.   In my experience these are actually pretty conservative numbers, but the limiting factor in successful ascents is your rocket's stability and your own piloting skill in keeping the nose close to the prograde vector. If you turn too aggressively and tumble, then you lose whatever efficiency you were hoping to achieve by turning early."
KerbalAcademy,3aybsv,old_faraon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:09:36 2015 UTC,"For a proper gravity turn, shortly after lift-off you slowly pitch over a few degrees to the East. If the ship is well designed and aerodynamically stable, you can turn off SAS and not touch the controls at all as the ship slowly continues to pitch over toward the Eastern horizon while staying within its prograde velocity vector. You want your acceleration to increase with terminal velocity as you ascend for optimal efficiency. Just going really fast produces a lot of drag which results in your ship wasting Dv fighting the atmosphere."

As a result, the shield has to be there to protect it.   Are you re-entering nose first?  Normally the heat shield goes below the capsule, and you dump everything else.  You then fly in heat-shield first (rear of the capsule first), which is aerodynamically stable.  Going in nose-first with the rest of the rocket attached is also aerodynamically stable (it's a lawn dart) but as you've seen, you then need to put a heat shield up front.   Straight up until the proapsis hits ~70 km, then wait until within +/- 2 seconds of interception and burn again, adjusting my angle to stay there.   Oh yeah, that will work but it's terribly inefficient.  Watch Scott Manley's video ""Kerbal Space Program 1.0 - Launching Rockets To Orbit"".  The first two minutes are talking about setting up the debug menu to show drag, so you can skip to 2:38 if you like.  Changing the way you fly will let you get to orbit with less fuel and therefore a smaller rocket.  You'll probably be able to lose those 3 boosters.

If your parachutes are being destroyed during launch due to heat effects you are launch to fast and losing alot of energy.  You want a TWR of 1.4ish upon liftoff.  You can set those SRBs to produce less power on luanch in the VAB.    Until you get to about 20k you want be going just fast enough to counter gravity, to fast and you are burning to much fuel trying to push through the atmosphere.  After about 20k the atmo is think enough you can punch it.   Also as others have states you want to start turning very soon after lift off (but turn slowly).  The more aerodynamic the craft the sooner you can turn.  By 40k you should be almost pointing right at the horizon (just slightly above it)."

KerbalAcademy,3avsak,rootnegative,11,Tue Jun 23 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"this is perfect. Once you get that close approach, what you need to do is come to complete stop relative to whatever you want to dock to.  the way you do this is you go to the nav ball and click the speed until it shows ""TARGET"".  once it shows target, orientate your craft to the retrograde vector.  once you are close to the craft you want to rendezvous to, burn in that direction until that speed reads 0ms.   from here, you need to ""dock"". switch on RCS. the trick here is to not look at the craft!!!!. it'll take you a ton of practice so quicksave and reload as many times as you need to.  I did a video on it here if you would like a visual :)"
KerbalAcademy,3avsak,GrungeonMaster,9,Wed Jun 24 01:51:40 2015 UTC,"Holy hell, you've dimed that rendezvous (rv) big time (it's perfect).  There are a lot of folks on this sub that will give you great technical explanation on how to do the next part, so I won't give you a crappy version of what you'll get from them. I do want to relay what I think is a good analogy for RV and docking.  There are 2 parts of the process: RV is the Macro, and Dock is the micro.  RV is like throwing a ball to your friend while you're both running along different paths. The ball in this case would be akin to the direction and magnitude of your needed change in velocity to reach a point in space at a given time.   Docking (the micro part) is like trying to give your friend a high five when while he's walking on an ice rink and you're both in street shoes in shoes. If you've ever done this, you'd know that you cannot curve your walking path on an ice rink in shoes. You basically have to set a course, get up a head of steam and then stop by reversing your thrust. Then you can turn a bit and repeat the acceleration/ deceleration part over and over until you're dialed.   The analogy is great to me.. Maybe it sucks for you.. good luck."

KerbalAcademy,3avsak,dftba-ftw,4,Thu Jun 25 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, when you get to that .4 km separation, make sure you are in target mode, burn retrograde until you have a relative velocity of 0. Then burn towards your target marker, at a good relative speed ( I.E when i'm at 1km separation i tend to go for 10 m/s ). At this point your prograde marker should be ontop of your target marker, watch this, when the prograde marker slips ~ 15 degrees off your target marker burn retrograde and zero out your relative velocity again. Rinse and repeat until you are at your target."

If you can do that, you just need to:   Make sure your orbits ""touch"" at least somewhere Make your ship's orbit larger than the target's Allow your ship to orbit around enough times until the closest point indicators are relatively close together (less than 10km is doable)...sometimes this takes a bunch of orbits and takes a while to wait!   My biggest problem with rendezvous was expecting the craft to be able to meet up within 5km on the first orbit after I matched them up.  Sometimes you have to sit there and allow the ships to complete a few (or more) orbits to allow one of the craft to catch up to the other one before you try to make their orbits the same size again."

In the older version, I'd come in hot, deploy chutes between 5-10km above sea level, and never think about my speed.  Now, I'm much more conscious of my speed once I hit the atmosphere, and then speed control as I go through it.  I've also started using the head dissipators which end up acting as psuedo-wings to slow descent once into lower atmosphere and before deployment at under 250 m/s."
KerbalAcademy,3aw3d3,dickheaddanny,3,Wed Jun 24 15:36:51 2015 UTC,Check your staging. Once this happened to me over and over only for me to realise the chutes were opening whilst in orbit rather than when the craft was in the atmosphere!

I am in career mode, and my final reentry vehicle is simple a mk 1 pod, with a heatshield on the base, and small reaction wheels, and the a chute on top.  I've been trying to get into orbit with career mode for ages, and finally managed a great orbit with the parts at hand tonight.  I blew the apoapsis out to 270km for a very satisfying first orbit, and then came in on a periapsis of 15km.  I see the answer 'try to make sure you aren't going xxxm/s' all the time... but i did not deploy my chute.  I had completely staged, and was ready to just watch a great re-entry... the chute automatically released at about 25km (i hadn't played with any of the chute settings) and simultaneously the parachute icon on my final stage release went orange, and then about 20 seconds later went red and I got the message that the chute had been destroyed.  I'm coming back to KSP after a long while away.  The heat mechanics are new, and I can't find anywhere why this happens (I've seen older posts which talk of bugs, but those are supposedly fixed, and I've seen posts to make my descent shallower, and post that say make it steeper).  It's beyond frustrating.  I'm on because I recommended the game to a friend, and frankly he thinks I'm an idiot.  He can barely control the damn pod now, and I'm managing with the aid of the reaction wheels to do so, and spend nights this week trying to get a reasonably shallow re-entry vector... and then the chute burns off.  It's beyond frustrating."

To help you can right click them and see if they are safe or not."
KerbalAcademy,3aw3d3,number2301,3,Wed Jun 24 11:04:26 2015 UTC,What this guy said. Don't stage the chutes until you're below 250m/s.  And 15km is a crazy low periapsis. You don't even need to go that low on a return from Jool.
KerbalAcademy,3aw3d3,Methesda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:43:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I can see that has confused a lot of people.

What I was trying to communicate was that I had shed all other parts other than the pod, the IRW, the chute, and the heatshield.  The final 'stage'... or the chute, had not been deployed."

I had completely staged, and was ready to just watch a great re-entry... the chute automatically released at about 25km   So, you DID deploy the 'chute.    You commanded it to open up way too high, going way too fast.  Do not stage the parachute until you are a lot lower and slower.  You should be subsonic (below 300 m/sec).  I tend to deploy them at 3000m, as that's close to where Apollo deployed theirs (passing 10,000').  I suggest choosing a higher Pe for the reentry, as well.  30km should do nicely for landing from low-orbit."
KerbalAcademy,3aw3d3,featherwinglove,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:31:11 2015 UTC,"Right click on the chute in the VAB and crank the slider at 0.04 up to 0.40, which is safe everywhere on Kerbin except the highest of mountains.  That done, you can stage your parachutes in space and they will stay in the cans until you're down to 5100m altitude.  ...in 1.0.4 I just lost a second stage as the parachutes shredded from a 0.50 atm pressure deploy because it was going too fast.  How it got that much more aerodynamically efficient while flying backwards?"
KerbalAcademy,3aw3d3,Methesda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:11:06 2015 UTC,"No, I'm sorry.  This is my bad use of the language.  I've put some 200 hours total into KSP.  My chute are always in the final stage, they are always separate from everything else.  When I think of stages, I think of rocket, or propulsion stages.  That is my mistake, and I apologise for the confusion. (Edit: I note that this is technically correct - it's just KSP mechanics that use the 'stages' to describe and implement the deployment of parachutes. Stages are, in part, defined by having propellant and engine(s) - but again, I apologies, we're not talking real life here)  I'm not a 'realism' nerd per se, but I have always found the idea of deploying chutes at over 25km kinda goofy.  I've never in my KSP career deployed chutes until I'm doing less than at least the speed of sound.  Also, when coming in a shallow as I was, I had an original periapsis of 65km (I didn't want to risk another pass with limited battery), and I had only 2/3rds' of a second impulse at Ap - and that changed my Pe from 60km to 15.  That's how shallow my re-entry was."
KerbalAcademy,3aw3d3,Perlscrypt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:42:55 2015 UTC,"The ""original periapsis"" is irrelevant. All that matters is the periapsis of the orbit when you hit the atmosphere.   A periapsis of 65km will barely slow you at all, you could get 4-5 more orbits before you are captured by the atmosphere.  A periapsis of 15km is too low, you will hit dense atmosphere before you have had time to bleed off some orbital speed. In fact, because you are descending so steeply, you might be going faster at 15-20 km than you were in orbit.  You could have fine-tuned that apoapsis burn by setting the thrust level of your engines with Left-shift/Left-control. btw, 2/3rds of a second impulse doesn't mean what you think it means, even though I understand what you are trying to say. (You only had enough fuel to fire your engine on full power for 2/3rds of a second.) The specific impulse of an engine is measured in units of seconds. Most rocket engines have a specific impulse of between 100-300 seconds.  Aim for a periapsis between 30-35 km. 25-40 km will probably be ok for any vessel that isn't coming in from an interplanetary trajectory."

If you have a line from KSC to the satellite and a line from the satellite to the probe, then you should just need to make sure you have targetting set up right so that the satellite targets both mission control and the probe (or active vessel)."

The default used to be 500 meters but that was no longer enough after updates to the aerodynamics.  Vehicles created before 1.0.3 will still have the old default and will therefore go splat. The problem should not occur for new vehicles. For existing vehicles, you can right click the parachute and change it."

KerbalAcademy,3asxnh,2silverseas,7,Tue Jun 23 14:48:38 2015 UTC,"So I feel silly asking but are you deploying your chutes? Because they don't open automatically.  Here are some things to know about your chute. It has five states. Stowed, triggered (but not deployed), semi-deployed, fully deployed, and cut. Obviously it starts stowed. When you activate it through the staging sequence it goes to the triggered state. Then it starts checking atmospheric pressure. As soon as you are in an atmosphere and the pressure is high enough it goes to semi-deployed. In this state it has more drag than stowed but less than deployed. If you stage it in the atmosphere it will likely do this immediately. Then it starts checking distance from the ground. When you get close enough to the surface it fully deploys. When you hit the ground the chute disappears and goes to the cut state.   One thing that could be going wrong is that the atmospheric pressure at which it partially deploys and the altitude at which it fully deploys are variable settings. To change them right click on the chute either in the VAB or in flight and drag the green bars. The interesting thing is that with just one command pod even at the extremes of these settings you should still be fine and the defaults should be even more safe. Your description is not entirely clear but it sounds like your chute is staying semi-deployed all the way until it hits the ground but I have no idea how that would happen."
KerbalAcademy,3asxnh,Sygon,2,Tue Jun 23 07:12:15 2015 UTC,"Haha not silly at all. I should have been a little more descriptive. I am in fact deploying my chute and not just sitting there waiting for it to pop up. I never knew that you could change the altitude at which the chute fully deploys and I'll have to take a look at that tomorrow. That said I have never had a problem with the default 500 m until now. What you are saying is in fact the case. The chute begins to open at the 500 m threshold and then by the time it opens fully, I'm already on the ground. If it's a matter of upping the altitude at which the chute deploys then I guess my issue is moot. Like I said, I'm surviving the reentry just not the landing so if increasing the threshold can slow me down quicker then I'm set.  Thanks for that tip! I've had the game since 0.25 and never freaking knew that was a thing!"

KerbalAcademy,3arwnh,TMarkos,9,Tue Jun 23 00:41:16 2015 UTC,Can anyone figure out if these radiators would allow for low solar flybys? Or is there a point where the radiators take on more heat by themselves than they can give off? I would love to get an atmospheric sample of the sun!
KerbalAcademy,3arwnh,eschybach,8,Tue Jun 23 01:26:06 2015 UTC,"That would depend greatly on how solar heating operates.  I don't know if it takes occlusion into account.  If it does, then potentially you can hide all the radiators and junk behind a heat-resistant shell (think the ship from Sunshine) and have them radiate the heat from the front out to behind you.    I don't think that's the case, though.  I believe ships near to the sun experience even heating regardless of orientation.  If that's the case then it's a straight battle between incoming and outgoing flux.  I think these will be considerably more efficient at radiating out heat than previous constructions, so you'll be able to get closer.  Probably not atmospheric sample close, though."
KerbalAcademy,3arwnh,TheHaugePower,2,Tue Jun 23 01:41:11 2015 UTC,"I've done some tests with radiators close to Kerbol (down to 100.000 km). Kerbol only heats the side facing it, although the heat will be conducted to the parts facing away from Kerbol over time. Radiators would in theory work well at low altitudes when facing away from Kerbol."
KerbalAcademy,3arwnh,CraftyCaprid,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:25:05 2015 UTC,That's very cool.  I wonder what the lowest sustainable altitude is for a solar craft.
KerbalAcademy,3arwnh,stampylives,2,Tue Jun 23 20:37:59 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm not reading the data correctly but are the fixed radiators better for radiating skin heat and the folding better at radiating core heat? Now that we have two different kinds of heat.
KerbalAcademy,3arwnh,featherwinglove,7,Tue Jun 23 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the best way to think of the distinction, it's more about how the heat moves.  Normal heat transfer goes:   Heat is generated and conducted between parts. As each part warms, the skin temperature rises to approach the core temperature. As the skin temperature rises, the amount of heat radiated from the object increases. This process continues until the total energy in the system is lowered.   The new radiators would seem to work more like:   Heat is generated and conducted between parts. The radiator uses its active cooling system to draw energy out of the other parts and into itself.  This system is one-way, and the heat remains trapped behind the poor heat conduction of the radiator. The core heat absorbed by the radiator quickly warms the skin (because of the high core-skin conductivity) and the radiator quickly approaches max radiative heat loss.   So the new radiator functions like the freon coils on the back of a fridge.  They get significantly warmer than the rest of the system while the interior of the system loses energy rapidly."
KerbalAcademy,3arwnh,featherwinglove,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:01:30 2015 UTC,"not even sure if they have the surface attachment to make it work...  but is the idea to stick fixed radiators on your ship to pull out heat, and then stick folding radiators onto the fixed radiators to send that heat off into space?"
KerbalAcademy,3arwnh,featherwinglove,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:23:47 2015 UTC,"No, that would probably be less efficient than just sticking the folders on the hot part.  Every transfer step takes time, so minimizing the distance traveled is good."

KerbalAcademy,3as36m,rickyharline,2,Tue Jun 23 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"There is a simple rudimentary process for airplane design that I recently read in this book, and I really wish I had known about it sooner. If there is interest I might make a video or Imgur album, but I can give you a process that will get you in the air and on your way. We're just going to figure out how much wing we need to get us in the air, as guesstimating is a pretty bad and frustrating way to go. I have no idea why this isn't more common in the KSP community, as the choice of math or frustration seems like one of those cake or death questions.   First off, can you make a simple jet fly? If not than you need to start there. Make a super simple jet with the basic jet engine that doesn't fly across a large speed envelope, perhaps not even supersonic. The steps will be:    1)  Build the fuselage!  Build your entire plane minus the lifting surfaces and use the RCS Build Aid mod to minimize how much your COM moves during flight. This mod is absolutely necessary unless having your aircraft's COM change significantly (read: lose stability and experience rapid unplanned disassembly) is your idea of a good time.    2) Discuss physics!  Now we want to figure out how much wing area we need. Let's use math. There's no use thinking about how our wings will operate when hypersonic if we can't get off the ground, so the first thing we must think of is if our plane can take off at all. So we're going to make our determination based on our takeoff speed, so for a simple jet let's emulate the T-38 and takeoff at 82 m/s, but mach .3 might be a reasonable speed for a spaceplane. Our formula is: S = 2L / (p V2 Cl) Where: S is our desired wing area L is our desired lifting force in Newtons (convert the weight of the plane Kg-->N) p is atmospheric density in Kg/m3, which for us (at sea level) will be 1.225; I don't know what FAR uses exactly, but this is standard sea level on earth and seems to produce good results in KSP V is our chosen takeoff velocity Cl is the coefficient of lift that we need to get from FAR at our desired takeoff AOA; the two factors that affect Cl are wing design and AOA  3) Get our lift coefficient!  If you want to convert units to imperial you could use this tool, but I haven't found one in metric yet. I'll just make one in javascript tonight, I think. Put a main wing on that you'd like to use, and lower its mass to something reasonable, perhaps .25 for our T-38 analog, or .5 for a spaceplane. Now look at the lift coefficient on the static analysis page of FAR and do an AOA sweep with our desired takeoff AOA as the max number, and at our desired takeoff speed. Perhaps 4 for our basic jet, and 6-8 for a spaceplane? This is our Cl- it may be hard to figure the number out as it doesn't tell you, so I do increments of .5 for my Cl. If there's a better way to get this info from FAR I would be delighted to hear about it. Our Cl will almost certainly change as we progress, so we will have to math more than once, but now that we have our lift coefficient, we need one more thing.    4)  Guess our total mass!  Don't forget about the mass of the wings! Remember those wings that we used to get our Cl? Great, now look at how much mass they add. Because the wings will affect two factors of our formula it is best to have a reasonable approximation of what you think they will end up being, but this should be a very quick step. Now how much mass do you guess all the other lifting surfaces will add? This total mass guesstimate is what we will be using the first time round in our formula, but if you guessed well than you might not need to do it a second time.     5)  Calculate!  For my pseudo T-38 I guessed a total weight of 4,200 kg, a Cl of .4, my V is is 82 m/s, and p is 1.225. So I convert kg to newtons: 4200 * 9.80665002864 = 41187.93 newtons of lift force I need to fly .4 * 822 * 1.225 = 3294.76, which I divide into double my lift: 82375.86/3294.76 = 25 m2 wing area I need. Neat!     By using flaps you can get your total wing area for takeoff lower, but I like being able to land at reasonable speed without flaps because contingency. You do you, though.     6) Install lifting surfaces!    Figure out whatever combination of lifting surfaces gets you up to the amount you need. Going a bit over is reasonable if you want more lift, going a bit under and using flaps to takeoff/land is reasonable if you want more speed.  If you calculate your stability derivatives with just your fuselage you will see that your reference area (first thing under aircraft properties), which is how we're determining our wing area, already has some lift area- I believe this is the lift from your fuselage and counts towards your final number, but I may be wrong. Counting it in seems to work out for me. Your rudder however, also adds ref area, and is definitely out. So figure out your wing area sans vertical stabilizer.   Forget about the COL tool in the hangar. It doesn't exist. We have two ways of examining our COM to COL relationship, and clicking on the COM and COL tools is not one of them. At what speed and AOA is it displaying your COL? Dunno, so don't use. Instead first check the yellow Cm line with an AOA sweep on the Static Analysis page. It should be going down; if it isn't, move some lifting surfaces aft. Then check the Mw at our takeoff speed (mach .24 for our T-38) in the Stability Derivatives window. We want to be nimble like a T-38, so we don't want this number to be large.     7) Move things around!    As you're placing your horizontal stabilizer/s, try and get your MOE(under pitch control derivatives) to be very high. This is our pitch authority, and it needs to not just be green, but very much green. Also make sure your Mq (under Pitch Rate) is excellent at this point. This is your pitch damp, that is your plane's ability to damp out pitch oscillations.     Now you can place your rudder, and remember that if you are building a spaceplane than you need a lot of rudder since they become less effective at hypersonic speeds. Check your yaw stability (YB and NB under Lateral Sideslip, NB is exactly analogous to Mw for pitch, so higher is better for stability, lower is better if you want to yaw quickly for some reason) and your yaw damp (Nr under Yaw). Fixing your yaw will probably look like adding more vertical stabilizer, adding more rudder to your stabilizer, and giving horizontal lifting surfaces some dihedral(that is, make the pointy ends go up). Now look at your roll due to sideslip which is a significant factor. If this is bad you will not have fun. You might make it to space, but you won't have fun. Or you might explode. And check your roll damp, which is Lp under roll.  At this point hopefully your roll stability is already good, if it isn't you're either building a really complicated or really funky plane. If you add flaps, check those in your takeoff configuration, too.  Now that you have your takeoff looking good, figure out the rest of your flight envelope. Our T-38 might do mach .9 at 9,000m, for example, so I need to check that on the stability derivatives page. I will most likely have to make some tweaks to get everything looking good again. For a space plane definitely do wide range (mach 0-6, AOA 0-50) sweeps on the Static Analysis page. Once everything's groovy there, go back to our derivatives page, and do multiple altitude and speed combinations. As you go higher you will need more speed to maintain stability. How slowly can you safely travel at 18,000, 22,000, 25,000, 28,000, and 32,000 meters? You may be surprised to find that a very safe speed at 18,000 meters has you way in the red by 20,000. Remember some of the big ones, like I need to be mach 3 by 18,000m, mach 4 by 21,000m, or whatever it ends up being for your plane. Boldly going up with no knowledge of your plane's stability is definitely very Kerbal, but it makes going to space very hard.    8)  Piloting!   Remember looking at the AOA sweep of our plane, especially the really limited one that only went to our desired takeoff AOA? Did you notice how when level your wings produce, like, no lift? So we don't just want to reach 82 m/s in our T-38, we want to reach 82 m/s at 4 (or what you chose) degrees pitch up. Hence another thing the community doesn't seem to do much: pitch up before takeoff speed. This is called rotation, and the speed at which you rotate is a bit lower than your takeoff speed, because you need your wings making lift if you want to fly, and if you rotate at your takeoff speed than you will actually takeoff a bit faster. This is where it is very handy to build a plane to the specification of a real one: the T-38's rotation speed is 70 m/s, and it lands at 69-87 m/s, the lower being full flaps, the higher no flaps. You generally want to descend on final a bit faster than your takeoff speed for the extra stability and control. I highly recommend that you always build your planes with flaps and actually use them properly(read how real planes use their flaps, C-172 might be easiest to find), but then again I highly recommend that you learn how to actually fly- learn how to use elevator trim to hold level, climbing, and descending attitudes, learn how to hold level flight for 5+ minutes, learn both gentle and hard turns while maintaining a constant altitude, learn how to fly a pattern at a consistent and reasonable altitude (300m is realistic) in our pseudo T-38 or similar, actually fly each leg of said pattern and have your pattern look like a rectangle, not an oval, and learn how to land comfortably."

KerbalAcademy,3as36m,2silverseas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"Well as for not taking off before the end of the runway you could try lowering your front landing gear. This will angle your craft up which will help you take off for the same reason that pitching up midair will make you ascend.   The other thing is adding canards (or any control surface in the front). The problem with control surfaces on the wings is that they are usually behind CoM so they work by pushing the tail down. They can't do that if the tail is in the ground. You could also just add more lift.  As for the instability it is hard to say without screenshots but here are some very basic things:  Center of thrust should be in line with center of mass. If you have more mass on the bottom half of the craft (landing gear, drop tanks, whatever) it may not be.  Control surfaces. Have some for every axis. Make sure the force they apply when active is inline with the centerline of the craft (so your rudders don't make you roll when trying to yaw).  Reaction wheels. They wont hurt but never use them exclusively. They are also good for VTOLs.  Move Drag further back. Having the CoL behind the CoM is a good start but they are not the only things with drag. If you have things near the front of the craft that could be moved back (such as batteries, parachutes, what have you) that might help. Or just move the CoL even farther back.  Moar struts. they never hurt The corollary of more boosters is usually not applicable to planes though.  If you just can't make anything work maybe start with the stock craft as see how the react  to slight tweaks. They aren't that good to start so you might be able to improve them.  Edit: formating"

KerbalAcademy,3arnpy,2silverseas,2,Tue Jun 23 07:26:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, welcome to KSP. Docking is a pain in the arse. I'm going to list a few pointers, you may know some but hopefully it helps.   when you're getting close make sure your relative velocity is really, really low. you can switch to docking mode (bottom left, the middle switch) which makes your WASD controls map to RCS translation. when you get to about 10-15 m apart, come to a dead stop. Switch between vessels to keep them perfectly aligned. When in visual range, you can click on the other vessel's docking port to set that as your target rather than the other ship's CoM. Using RCS translation, advance forward at about 1 m/s. This is actually about five times faster than NASA does the final approach, but hey. F5/F9 is a godsend. you may need to rapidly switch between ships to maintain the correct orientation. if you contact the docking port but don't properly connect, you won't on this run.

Press ""v"" until you're in chase mode (so that the controls always move you the same way relative to your view).

Instead of trying to eyeball the orientation as the two ships slowly float together, get it to where you are moving towards it and then use your controls to make the other object ""freeze"" in your view.  If you can keep the ship you're moving towards perfectly still in relation to your ship, you will run directly into it.  As long as you're moving towards the side with the port on it, you should be good."

KerbalAcademy,3aps1n,bea_bear,3,Mon Jun 22 14:48:45 2015 UTC,The first thing I would suggest is moar struts and not just because struts fix everything. The more flex your craft has the more it will wobble. If the pod you are controlling from is not firmly attached it can wobble and point a slightly different direction than the body of the craft. This makes the SAS believe that you craft is (for example) pointing down more than it is. Then it tries to pitch up causing the loose cockpit to swing up which causes the SAS to pitch down and so on. In some cases it will settle out eventually (like yours) while in other it will amplify.  the other thing it could be is that you might have too many control surfaces which could also lead to the SAS overcompensating.
KerbalAcademy,3aps1n,2silverseas,3,Mon Jun 22 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"Be careful though, struts cause a lot of drag.  (That's what I have read about current vanilla aero.)"

KerbalAcademy,3aoe77,LazerSturgeon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:28:59 2015 UTC,"In short, yes the air is too thin. It is also the type of engine you have available.  The basic jet engine gives great thrust for its size and weight but it performs very poorly in thinner air conditions. The turbojets are rather the opposite and operate more efficiently up high, but are less efficient down low.  There are 2 ways you can extend the flight ceiling a bit. The first is to bring more air intakes. Having more intake air lets the engine breath better and operate more effectively. However this does have a point of diminishing returns as you are also adding weight (just like how adding fuel to a rocket may not increase max altitude).  The second method is to build up some speed before doing your climb, and to climb more gently. Stay around 8000m and build up a lot of forward velocity. Remember that (1/2)v2 = gh for how much energy you need to climb (being a plane it is a bit more complicated than that but you get the point). Building speed also increases the amount of air flowing into your intakes.  One trick too is to look at your plane and think ""Am I really going to need ALL of this fuel?"". In real life planes rarely fly with a full tank because it's just extra weight."
KerbalAcademy,3aoe77,krenshala,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has pretty much answered your question, but to help put things in perspective, 12000m is just short of 40000 feet, and passenger jets typically fly at 25k to 35k feet.  The contract wants you to fly and get science at an altitude more than 50% higher than an airliner (e.g., 747) would be."

KerbalAcademy,3alc0w,Rockleg,7,Sun Jun 21 09:41:02 2015 UTC,"Have a look at the Delta-V charts in the sidebar.   It takes barely more to get there (965 vs 950 to reach the SoI), but once you're there it takes less to capture into low orbit, and then waaaaay less to eliminate your relative orbital velocity and land safely.   As for telling the difference between biomes, it depends on how much you're willing to install mods or break immersion in Career mode. The Kerbal wiki has maps that show you where the different biomes are, so you could correlate those maps with the major features you see when looking at Mun.   If you don't mind installing mods, the Kerbal Engineer Redux mod has the option to include biome info in a HUD, both the current biome and the biome where your orbit will intercept the surface once you make a retro burn to land. The KER mod has the option to only show you info once you research and attach a specific part to your ship, or you can have the info available as long as there's an Engineer with a certain level on board the ship.   Aside from those methods, you can also bring up the debug options in-flight and simply mark the one for the map view that paints the surface textures different colors according to the biomes."

For the mun/minimus, the biomes are low/med/highlands (which are defined largely by altitude although there are buggy regions), slopes (which are between low/med/highlands), poles  (latitude) and then larger features such as craters or the different flats on minimus have their own biomes."

How can I easily maximize the amount of science I gather from Mun?   Make a science-gathering ship.  It should contain one scientist (to collect the science and reset the experiments) and one of every science sensor you unlocked (the Atmospheric Fluid Spectro-Variometer is not needed if there's no atmosphere).  If you don't know, you can use those sensors multiple times, as a scientist is able to collect the data and reset the sensors.  You need EVA ability though, which you get by upgrading the Astronaut Complex.  Do it early as the ability to reuse sensors multiple times is extremely valuable for science.  Visit various biomes, trigger the experiments + crew report, EVA report, surface sample in each of them, collect the science and reset the sensors (don't forget to collect the crew report from the capsule) and repeat in the next biome.  Collect all the science and bring it back to Kerbin, that's better than transmitting it from the Mun.   How can I tell the difference between the Munar biomes?   If you don't mind using external knowledge, there are maps available online.  There's also an option in the debug menu (Alt+F12) that allows you to view the biomes in the map view.  If you want to do it without external knowledge and guess the biomes by yourself, look for areas that are geologically distinct.  Flat vs. hilly, big craters or otherwise visible geological features.  One way to locate biomes without using too much fuel is to go into low orbit and try a gravity scan or EVA report.  The report will tell you the name of the biome.  Or if you have Kerbal Engineer, I think it tells you the biome at all times.  By the way, gravity scan and EVA report are another great way to collect science from several biomes without even having to land.  Other experiments in space don't change by biome but you can still run them in low orbit and high orbit.   What suggestions (tips?) do you have for Munar science-y stuff?   There's nothing really specific about science on the Mun, it works the same everywhere.  So you can actually practice on Kerbin.  Did you visit every biome of the space center?  Go to Minmus instead of the Mun and you'll be able to visit much more biomes in one go.  And the science there is more valuable!"
KerbalAcademy,3alc0w,BillOfTheWebPeople,2,Sun Jun 21 12:45:35 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, minimus is a much easier trip overall.    My approach is to do one or two single missions to tech up a little bit.  Then I build a mothership and two landers to send out there.

KerbalAcademy,3alc0w,merv243,2,Sun Jun 21 22:20:12 2015 UTC,"My favorite way to get science early is to go into polar orbits.  Just yesterday on my new career I launched a ship with one of every type of science that I had access to (temp, pressure, goo, materials, plus crew and EVA report of course) into a low polar Mun or Minmus orbit.  A polar orbit allows you to eventually cover every point of the moon/planet.    Once I got into a low orbit (<60km for Mun, <30km for Minmus, I think), I did all the non-biome-specific experiments (crew report + the 4 above), and then did an EVA report from each biome, which took about 30 minutes real time.  This netted me over 1000 science, and I even forgot to collect the data from several experiments that I ditched to save delta-v, so I missed out on at least 100 more.  And it was way easier than building a lander and planning on going biome-hopping on the surface.  I did it all with 1.25m parts and just the entry-level batteries and solar panels, I think."

KerbalAcademy,3alqr6,Desembler,2,Sun Jun 21 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"It generally works for Hohmann transfers where you have big differences between your low energy orbit (LEO) and your destination orbit when the two orbits are close to circular and you have a big spherical body you're only a fraction of a radius above.  Lose the horizon and look for the prograde marker on your LEO being close to the target marker and the horizon of the NavBall for the most general case.  It also works in Orbiter and real life.  The Apollo program never actually used this as a navigational strategy, but noticed it as it was happening in the simulator (due to limitations in GPU technology at the time, the Earth and Moon were rendered by aiming cameras at models.)  In Apollo 13 (i.e. the Ron Howard movie), TLI is depicted as ending with the S-IVB stack aimed directly at the Moon.  Did the movie people know?  I wouldn't be surprised either way.  What actually happens is that your craft goes around about half a rev on the transfer orbit while the target goes around about a quarter of a rev in the same period.  Kepler's math is good enough to predict this, Hohmann could have predicted this (either he didn't or no one noticed - it's also possible that he didn't think of the case where the departure orbit is far smaller than the destination orbit.)  Finally, the astronauts and flight controllers of the Apollo program noticed it in the mid-1960s.  It is probable that Scott Manley introduced the technique to the KSP community, but I haven't confirmed it yet (many of his older vids are delisted, unfortunately.)"

KerbalAcademy,3aley9,wcoenen,3,Mon Jun 22 03:41:12 2015 UTC,Nice.
KerbalAcademy,3aley9,number2301,3,Mon Jun 22 03:45:53 2015 UTC,I've used this simple design to lift 10 ton payloads into low Kerbin orbit:   X200-16 fuel tank (aka a quarter of an orange tank) poodle engine decoupler Orange tank skipper engine three extra thud engines (the white ones that attach radially) arranged arround the skipper   It's more fun to design your own though. The metrics that you need to consider are thrust-to-weight (need >1 to get off the ground) and delta-v (need >3500 m/s to get to orbit). You can calculate these yourself or install the Kerbal Engineer Redux mod.
KerbalAcademy,3aley9,WhatsALogin,3,Sun Jun 21 13:22:39 2015 UTC,"Some great suggestions here already.  You can also look at the Falcon 9, Falcon heavy, and Delta IV  heavy for inspiration. All the same physics are in play."
KerbalAcademy,3aley9,BobbleBobble,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"And this is why I love KSP, you can actually take inspiration from Real life™ and have it work in the game. My medium lifter is basically the Delta IV, using a similar thrust profile to launch more efficiently against the souposphere. Now as for the other way around..."
KerbalAcademy,3aley9,Perseus33,2,Mon Jun 22 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"In general, you need to build backwards. Start with the payload, then build enough dv into the transfer/landing stage to get the job done. Then build the orbital stages (y u no asparagus) using KER to make sure the TWR stays consistent as you burn fuel."

KerbalAcademy,3aley9,snakejawz,0,Sun Jun 21 10:54:45 2015 UTC,"Install Kerbal Engineer Redux. Avoid (minimize) solids. Build your first stage (launch stage) as wide as possible.  I build a ""basket of fuel tanks"" around my ""final boost phase"" to maximize how wide it can be.  The payload shouldn't be wider than the ""boost foot print"".  I built a mega booster in 0.25 (untested in 1.0) that could lift 9 orange tanks to Jool. That one used 13 mammoths that staged into 13 Rhinos with a ring of asparagus Twin boars and an inner ring of asparagus mainsails."

KerbalAcademy,3aglx3,XenoRyet,9,Sat Jun 20 00:05:30 2015 UTC,"I would think that since Ike is within an order of magnitude of the mass of Duna that you would not get that much of of increase in burn efficiency by burning near Duna. Just remember to time your burn so that Ike's orbital motion around Duna is in the same direction that you need to eject from Duna. In other words, time your Ike ejection when Ike is on the sunward side of Duna."
KerbalAcademy,3aglx3,Rabada,2,Sat Jun 20 00:29:33 2015 UTC,I think you're right.  About the only thing I'm still considering is if there is some kind of gravity assist I could use to net enough delta v to be worth the trouble.
KerbalAcademy,3aglx3,Rabada,4,Sat Jun 20 01:18:32 2015 UTC,I would think the difficulty in plotting wouldn't make it worth it.
KerbalAcademy,3aglx3,Eric_S,2,Sat Jun 20 01:51:50 2015 UTC,"I've done exactly that (dive to duna, burn for transfer at periapsis without circularizing), but not recently.  If I remember correctly,  it's more efficient, but only by a small margin.  Probably not worth the added piloting difficulty."
KerbalAcademy,3aglx3,Eric_S,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:50:14 2015 UTC,"And I think Rabada has a good point about relative sizes.  It's a very small margin at best using Ike/Duna, but it's a much larger margin for Gilly/Eve."
KerbalAcademy,3aglx3,CuriousMetaphor,2,Sat Jun 20 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"According to this delta-v map, burning directly from Ike to Kerbin is slightly more efficient than diving down to Duna first.  I would say it's also easier to plot/pilot."

KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,HATECELL,12,Thu Jun 18 10:57:06 2015 UTC,"Basicly a Kerbal is granted XP for different activities. Like performing an Orbit around a body, doing a fly by, landing, planting a flag.  On the wiki there is an extensive list of actions that reward XP, however, every action only yields XP once, so no matter how often you plant a flag on the mun, you're not getting more XP after the first time.  Also note, assuming you bring a bunch of Kerbals, they all need to place a flag in order to get the XP.  I don't know if you just have to be in a stable orbit before the xp counts, or that you actually need to go round the body before it counts.  But the easiest way to train a bunch of Kerbals is by orbiting, flying by, landing, and flagging the Mun, Minmus and (with the exception of flagging) Kerbin  Or just orbit a bunch of different bodies"
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,TheNosferatu,4,Thu Jun 18 11:09:30 2015 UTC,"I believe landing and placing a flag give the same xp, so don't worry about having everyone drop a flag. It won't benefit anything."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,EngineeringSolution,17,Thu Jun 18 12:00:43 2015 UTC,"Flag planting is a slightly more valuable achievement than landing, according to the achievements table.  It may have seemed like it doesn't make much difference because you only get XP for the most valuable achievement on a given celestial body; they don't add up."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,wcoenen,2,Thu Jun 18 12:16:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, I see what happened. I only have dropped flags on Mun and Minmus where it rounds to the same whole number. Thank you for the information!"
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,EngineeringSolution,5,Thu Jun 18 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm under the impression that everyone does has to drop a flag, I remember reading it in the Wiki."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,TheNosferatu,3,Thu Jun 18 12:22:57 2015 UTC,You can get them to lvl 3 by: Orbit mun - plant flag on minmus ( every nerbal has to do it) - leave Kerbins SOI and return to Kerbin.  Only the most valuable achievement per body counts.
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,exingit,5,Thu Jun 18 12:22:33 2015 UTC,Only the most valuable achievement per body counts.   ... per mission/flight.
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,krenshala,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"... per mission/flight.   I don't think that is right.  If a Kerbal orbits the Mun, he/she doesn't get that XP again for orbiting it again in a later mission."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,alexwilson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"No, but others have posted that if you orbit, then come back and plant a flag, you get the xp for the flag in addition to the (previous mission's) orbit.  It is my understanding that it marks the 'highest' action and any new actions 'above' that in the list will earn you XP, while those 'below' it will not (e.g., if you've already gotten that kerbal into orbit he can't earn Xp for flying at Kerbin)."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,krenshala,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:44:48 2015 UTC,"Planting a flagnon the mun doesnt get you more xp if you do it in multiple missions (like flyby, orbit, land, land and plant flag) than if you do it in one go."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,exingit,3,Fri Jun 19 06:00:29 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the exact details, you can find those in the wiki.  But the most efficient mission plan to get kerbals to level 3 is:   take off orbit Kerbin launch yourself to the edge of Kerbin SOI (past the Kerbin escape marker) and immediately go back into Kerbin SOI (I believe the easiest way to do this is to exit the SOI with a trajectory that points towards the sun) orbit Mun orbit Minmus land on Minmus and plant a flag go back home   The order could be different. Does not matter.  You don't need to land on the Mun, which saves you a lot of delta V, just achieve a very high orbit for maximum efficiency.  To get beyond level 3 you'll need to do more, but I'm not sure what exactly you need to do per level."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,Deimos_F,2,Thu Jun 18 13:38:47 2015 UTC,"For my training field trips, I usually eject from Kerbin SOI after Minimus. I can shoot about the same direction as it's orbit and only skim outside the SOI and the return is relatively easy straight back to Kerbin."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,QuickBASIC,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"Achieving high Mun orbit actually requires more deltaV because of the Oberth effect. The most efficient wolud be an orbit with low PE and high AP, but that would make transfer to Minmus more difficult."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,Ifyouseekey,2,Thu Jun 18 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"You are right.  I did not go into a lot of detail mainly because of how dependent on the relative position of Mun, Minmus and Kerbin these missions tend to be."
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,Deimos_F,3,Thu Jun 18 19:16:17 2015 UTC,http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience  TL;DR: you get points for visiting each planet/moon.  You get max points for planting a flag on that planet/moon.  Kerbals don't actually level up until you bring them back to Kerbin and recover them.  There are mods that can let you level-up Kerbals in space instead of having to recover on Kerbin.
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,hab136,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:59:23 2015 UTC,I got 16* of my kerbals to lvl 4 in one mission. I unlocked the shuttle crew capsule and jammed 15 Kerbs in there. Went to Gilly and planted 15 flags.   Orbit Kerbin Orbit the Sun Orbit Eve Plant flag on Gilly Fly by Mun or Minmus on the way home  That got the 32 points needed and now I have a well experienced staff. I'm on mobile but I'll try and post some pics tomorrow. Was a fun mission.   Edit: 16* Kerbals came home.  I left room for 1 that I rescued from Gilly Surface.
KerbalAcademy,3a9ti4,Johnny-Lingo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"Not going into details, but for quick and easy levels I just build a three Kerbal rocket capable of landing on the Mun, Minmus, and breaking kerban SOI to orbit the sun and returning to Kerbin. Throw a pilot and two scientists/engineers in, run the three missions (can be done in two, maybe one if you plan well), and at the end you'll have all three Kerbals at level 3.   Make sure when you land, each kerbal youre trying to level plants their own separate flags."

KerbalAcademy,3a87fl,kmneal,7,Thu Jun 18 00:11:17 2015 UTC,"It is pretty much impossible to burn perfectly on the marker (maneuver prograde) by hand, so once you have completed a lot of your burn and are maybe 2 degrees off of perfect, the marker moving away is sort of correcting the inaccuracies.  You'll notice it more at the end since, if you need 1000m/s forward and 1m/s to the side, it will still look pretty much forward. The correction is insignificant to the remaining burn.  Once you are almost done, if you only need 1m/s forward, and need 1 m/s to the side, to correction to the side is a big part, and the marker will be 45° away from where you were pointing for most of the burn.  You also might want to consider how accurately you are trying to burn... if you are just circularizing on liftoff, and are just trying to get a periapsis somewhere between 70 and 80km, you don't really need to chase... close enough. If you are planning to intercept another ship and want to be as accurate as possible, you will probably want to drop your throttle nice and low and follow the maneuver prograde indicator."
KerbalAcademy,3a87fl,stampylives,5,Thu Jun 18 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"You mean the blue maneuver node marker?  Different from the pink target marker, which shows you the direction towards your selected target just FYI.    If you execute your burns correctly it should not move.  It will move if you are slightly off of it while burning, and even if you are basically perfect it can jump around towards the end, but if you are almost done you can usually ignore it as you should be close enough (check map view to see how your trajectory compares to what you expect).    If it starts to jump around while you still have a ways to burn you need to try to be more precise with your piloting, and you should be staying exactly on it, as it is moving to make up for the errors in your piloting.    Also make sure you are executing your maneuvers correctly.  You want to start your burn with half of the estimated burn time as the time till the node.  Another way of saying that is you want to burn evenly on either side of the node, as the node is showing your trajectory as if all of the velocity change happens instantly at that time.  This assumption can inject some error in longer burns which will result in drifting of the node, but if you are burning correctly it should be minimal."
KerbalAcademy,3a87fl,Toobusyforthis,3,Thu Jun 18 00:40:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks so much. I think I am seeing this more in the maneuvers that are super short. 1-5 second burns. I don't go full blast because I need to have a bit more control so I ramp up making sure to burn halfway on either side of the node but since the time calculations assume you're burning at full power I'd imagine this is introducing errors. That all makes sense. The Maneuver node is trying to correct for errors in my piloting. Thanks so much for the help."
KerbalAcademy,3a87fl,Toobusyforthis,2,Thu Jun 18 02:44:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the short burns are more sensitive so if you are not dead on it can start jumping around really quickly.  Sounds like you have a pretty good handle on it though."
KerbalAcademy,3a87fl,BillOfTheWebPeople,2,Thu Jun 18 05:12:33 2015 UTC,"One thing I picked up from another post here on reddit was to use RCS as I got down really low on things that did need to be accurate (as the above example stated rendevouz versus just getting an orbit.).  I'll burn down to 2 or 3 m/s and then use RCS to get the final little tweaks.  This also depends on the engine... if I have a tiny little engine I probably won't but if I need 1 m/s and I have a mainsail... well, hard to kick on the mainsail for a precision burn."
KerbalAcademy,3a87fl,jofwu,6,Fri Jun 19 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way....  Let's say you need to burn 100 m/s directly East. But you won't get it perfectly. Let's say you are aimed 1 degree North of East the whole time. If you do the vector math, you'll find that your delta-v to the East increased by 99.98 m/s. Pretty good. But you also picked up 1.75 m/s of delta-v to the North.  The maneuver wasn't supposed to leave you with any delta-v to the North, so it says, ""Hey, to do what you wanted we still need to burn 0.02 m/s East and 1.75 m/s South."" The maneuver marker will point out this vector. And guess where a vector of 0.02 East and 1.75 South points? Mostly South. The direction is way off from where it originally was, but the remaining delta-v for the burn is very small.  You notice it happening more with small burns because the level of error is smaller.  You can stick with the maneuver marker, but be aware that when it really starts to diverge it means you're getting close to being done. Don't overdo it. And if you follow the maneuver marker be prepared to spend a bit more delta-v than planned. Because you'll essentially be performing the maneuver AND correcting error. Usually the error isn't super significant."

KerbalAcademy,3a7mdu,CraftyCaprid,4,Wed Jun 17 21:42:37 2015 UTC,"2nd the landing gear recommendation. A lot of these contracts will have readings at the surface, and the easiest way to get them is to land and taxi if there are two adjacent.   Early on I struggled with the measurement points about 15km, it's hard to get a Wheatley powered jet that high, and adding rockets tends to create CoM issues as it burns through the fuel."

KerbalAcademy,3a7mdu,Winterspite,2,Thu Jun 18 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"A couple of ways, neither of them optimal. Sub orbital rockets was one, the other was using a rocket assisted plane and trying to manage the fuel load. Keeping the fuel forward helps, there is a structural fuselage component you can use in the rear of the plane, the fuel will still flow through to a rocket engine (or just use an empty tank). You can also shift fuel in-flight, by alt-right clicking two different tanks you get an option to pump fuel from one to the other. That can be a bit tricky to manage mid-burn but could be OK if you burn > shift fuel > burn again. You should only need to burn with 1/3 throttle which helps keep things manageable.   Adding additional air intakes can help the jets keep running at higher altitudes, although I'm not sure how much that will assist the basic jet. Keep the resource panel open and watch your air utilisation."

Because drag reduces as you fly up (once you cross the threshold where you're no longer approaching terminal velocity) the right moment to drop is when the difference in drag=the difference in weight. If acceleration goes down you dropped too early and drag>weight, if it goes up you waited too long and weight<drag, if the acceleration meter didn't move you're gold."

KerbalAcademy,39yo3q,MrBorogove,6,Mon Jun 15 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"It's easier to experiment than to try to model mathematically. Fly a typical rocket on a typical ascent profile several times, jettisoning at different altitudes, and see which jettison point leaves you the most fuel when you make orbit. Once you've experimentally found the best jettison point for a typical rocket, that will be satisfactorily close for other rockets of similar performance.  http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/35ttcm/i_wanted_to_find_out_what_height_was_best_to/ ended up doing best with a jettison around 20km."

KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,SpuddMeister,8,Mon Jun 15 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"Oberth effect is involved, but I think an easier way to think about it is that to eject from Kerbin, you're looking to reach a certain speed, not travel a certain distance. When you're way up at Minmus' orbit, you're not carrying much speed, so you need a lot of delta v (literally change in speed) to get up to escape velocity.  Down in low Kerbin orbit, you're already carrying a bunch of speed, so you need to add less to get to escape velocity."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,XenoRyet,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:40:20 2015 UTC,"The Oberth effect isn't really relevant to circular orbits, but your explanation is still accurate."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,CambleC,3,Tue Jun 16 10:37:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, it is the Oberth effect.  If all you're doing is leaving the SoI, then it would probably be cheaper from 47Mm altitude.    The thing is, when you're doing a transfer, you want to leave the SoI with enough velocity to place your solar apoapsis/periapsis at the desired altitude.  Because of the Oberth effect, adding 10 m/s velocity to an orbit that is already escaping the SoI at the periapsis will give you more than 10 m/s additional velocity when you leave the SoI.  The deeper in the gravity well you were at the time you added it, the faster you were moving and the greater the difference would be.  That said, the Oberth effect isn't the only factor, so an atmosphere-skimming 70km periapsis isn't always the most efficient.  The more SoI departure velocity you need, the more important the Oberth effect is, the lower the SoI departure velocity you need, the more important your distance to the edge of the SoI is.    This is why the circular orbit requiring the smallest ejection burn is one just over 10Mm if you're targeting Duna, but the smallest ejection burn for targetting Eeloo is at about 250 km altitude.  Also, before anyone gets confused, these numbers are only if you're refueling in your parking orbit.  If you're launching then departing without refueling, you're best off with a parking orbit as low as possible that is outside the atmosphere and allows you to warp at the speed you desire, assuming you don't want to warp from the tracking station.  All said, your cheapest transfer from Minmus to another celestial body will usually be by leaving Minmus in the Minmus-retrograde direction so that you get a low Kerbin periapsis, then burn for your transfer at that periapsis.  Timing that can be a bit of a pain, but I've done it several times.  I strongly recommend a quicksave before leaving Minmus, though, because if you get your timing off, the necessary course corrections can be more expensive than how much you would save by using that maneuver."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,Eric_S,2,Tue Jun 16 17:06:32 2015 UTC,"You put so much effort into that post you almost put me off replying, but the Oberth effect relates to the efficiency of the maneuver at the periapsis, due to the increased momentum gained by falling down towards that point. With a circular orbit, there is no additional momentum gained.  All this scenario is, is a difference in initial velocity versus the ΔV required to reach the desired velocity required for transfer. Generally the difference is greater at a higher orbit, so the cost is greater."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,CambleC,3,Tue Jun 16 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"I don't mind being corrected regardless of how much effort I put into being wrong.  That said, I still disagree, though it may be a matter of perspective.  The Oberth effect happens because a fixed amount of delta-v adds a fixed amount of velocity, but since kinetic energy is based on the square of the velocity, the higher the initial velocity, the more energy the same amount of delta-v adds.  When comparing different circular orbits, the Oberth effect still plays a role since the starting velocities are different.  Saying that it's because you're moving faster doesn't explain why it takes less delta-v to transfer to Duna from 10Mm than it does from 250km altitude, but transferring to Eeloo takes less from 250km than 10Mm."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,Eric_S,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"Different starting velocities is not the Oberth effect. And saying that you're moving faster does explain why it takes less ΔV to transfer, because ΔV is just that - change in velocity.  It costs less ΔV to reach escape velocity from a lower orbit because your initial velocity is higher. That's it. No making use of acceleration due to gravity."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,CambleC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:03:39 2015 UTC,"Then explain the Duna/Eeloo difference I mentioned above.  The combination of orbital mechanics and the Oberth effect explain that the way I described it in my second paragraph in my first post, that adding velocity while lower in the gravity well has a non-linear effect on your velocity after you've left the SoI.  Yes, the Oberth effect means that if you want to most effectively change your orbital energy that you should do it at periapse, but that's an implication of the Oberth effect, not the whole thing."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,Eric_S,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"I have already replied more than I intended and thought I already mentioned a trade-off in burning from a lower altitude, but must have removed it from a previous post.  As you start reducing the orbital altitude and testing ΔV costs, there is a point where starting from a lower altitude actually costs more ΔV. This is probably due to the need to overcome the gravity well of the body you are leaving. You will get greater initial velocity up to a point, then it will cost you more energy to fight the increased gravity at that altitude.  If I could be bothered, I would plot a graph, but you can witness it yourself by launching from various altitudes. I'd be interested to see what kind of difference in ΔV costs you're seeing, because there are other factors which could throw off testing.  It's also worth noting that a spacecraft will get more acceleration from its fuel when it's travelling at a higher velocity, assuming you're burning in the right direction. That's why it's more efficient.  Anyway, it's not a matter of perspective, and if you disagree you disagree. But the Oberth effect has nothing to do with circular orbits. Maybe do a little more reading."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,CambleC,0,Wed Jun 17 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"I've done plenty of reading.  I understand the math, where you talk ""probably.""    The delta-v requirements I'm referring to are coming straight from http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/ to eliminate any environmental issues with the numbers.  Also, a spacecraft doesn't get more acceleration from a given amount of fuel based on velocity (ignoring relativity), it gets more energy, and that's a very important distinction which is at the heart of the Oberth effect.  The specific energy of a given orbit is constant at all points, that energy consisting of potential energy and kinetic energy.  In a circular orbit, the potential and kinetic energy stay constant, but in an elliptical orbit, you're constantly trading one for the other.  Since kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity, undergoing the same acceleration while at a higher velocity adds more total energy to the orbit.  The total energy is important because at the moment just before you cross the SoI, your kinetic energy is the total orbital energy minus the potential energy at the altitude of the SoI.  This kinetic energy determines your Kerbin relative velocity, which combined with Kerbin's sun relative velocity, determines your sun relative velocity after you exit Kerbin's SoI.  This sun relative velocity and the point in space you enter the solar SoI in turn determines your orbit, including the orbital energy of that orbit.  So basically, your ejection burn needs to increase your orbital energy by enough to be equal to the potential energy at the SoI plus the kinetic energy to give you the desired solar velocity.  This amount of energy is the same regardless of where you start from.  However, the orbital energy you start from determines how much orbital energy you start with.  So, while a lower orbit, even a circular one, gains more benefit from the Oberth effect due to a higher velocity component of the orbital energy, it has to come up with more total energy to reach the needed amount in order to transfer to the planet.  Now, the reason a higher orbit is more efficient going to Duna whereas a lower orbit is more efficient going to Eeloo is because Eeloo needs a higher total orbital energy for the transfer orbit.  Since for a given circular orbit, the potential energy remains the same, the transfer burn requires a larger proportion of kinetic energy.  This means that the Oberth effect will be more pronounced, which in turn means that the optimal orbit will depend more on the Oberth effect than the initial potential energy, hence the lower orbit.  For Duna, on the other hand, the total orbital energy is less, so overall the Oberth effect plays a lesser role and the initial potential energy plays a greater role, hence the higher orbit is more efficient.  So yes, despite the fact that you start from a circular orbit, the Oberth effect still plays an important role in the delta-v it takes to transfer to another planet, and different circular orbits will get different amounts of benefit from the Oberth effect.  I don't want to come across as someone that has to be right all the time, but the Oberth effect has a lot more implications than just ""always burn at periapsis.""  I understood that one rule before I understood the wider implications of the Oberth effect, and I'm just trying to spread the wider implications."

KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,svarogteuse,3,Mon Jun 15 23:14:06 2015 UTC,If the refueling station has fuel sourced from Minmus not Kerbin you gain because of the easier lift from the surface of the moon than from the planet for the fuel. If your refueling station is full of fuel from Kerbin then yes its useless since its better to do transfers from closer to Kerbin. Install Karbonite or some similar mod and mine Minmus for fuel.
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,bigorangemachine,3,Mon Jun 15 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"The refueling station is actually orbiting Minmus, about 80km.  Why is it better to do transfers closer to Kerbin?  Should it be less delta/v from an orbit that is near Minmus (4,700km away)?"
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,svarogteuse,3,Mon Jun 15 21:19:49 2015 UTC,No. Because you are moving faster the lower your orbit.  So to escape kerbin SOI you have to reach a certain speed (not altitude). To travel out to minmus you have to change your orbit to a slower orbit. Thus to escape from minmus you are already traveling slower than you would from LKO
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,wwen42,-1,Mon Jun 15 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"Because thats how the math works, its a fact of orbital transfers.  I'm Sure someone can show you the math but its not going to be me I'd have to figure it out."
KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,bea_bear,2,Mon Jun 15 22:17:34 2015 UTC,"You have more speed when in a low Kerbin orbit, so it takes more dv when you're out near Minmus. Maybe figure out how much dV it takes to escape minmus and then circularize into a low Kerbin orbit and design that into your ship  I've been wondering what to do with my refueling situation as well. I considered having a fuel ""truck"" move back and forth from Minmus orbit to refuel missions, but I'm not sure how big I need to make this truck to have enough fuel to put into a mission and then still get back to Minmus."

KerbalAcademy,39yjjx,reddrip,2,Tue Jun 16 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"Well you're not going to get any speed from the gravity assist part. It's just a way to take advantage of the Oberth Effect without having to slow down to Low Kerbin Orbit.  When exactly in Minmus's orbit around Kerbin you leave is what controls where you'll end up. That's your main variable to aim your craft.  You could send your whole fuel station to LKO with a gentle, high altitude (40-50km) many-orbit aerocapture. Then any future mining ships send fuel to LKO."

From an 102x85km orbit I used ~99.95 units of ablator on the starting capsule (Mk 1? i'm horrible with names) or the 1.25m heat shield part.  They key for keeping radial 'chutes alive is to not have them directly in the airflow so the shock-heating doesn't make them explode.  As for your ship tumbling in the atmosphere, it sounds like your center of lift is below the center of mass, so the ship wants to turn around (as if you are throwing a dart backward).

You need to match eccentricity (near circular) and inclination (near zero). Obviously also make sure they maintain connection to KSC and each other. If you have KER, the orbital readout will give you eccentricity and inclination. Otherwise, use the Mun to zero inclination and get your PE/AP as close to each other as you can to zero eccentricity."
KerbalAcademy,39v1ek,SonOfShem,10,Mon Jun 15 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"Your gravity turn should start much sooner than 10km altitude.  You want to be at 45° by the time you hit 10 to 15km (depending on the ship).  Also, try for a 1.6 to 2.0 thrust to weight ratio on the pad.  You'll get much better performance that way.  The flipping is due to one or both of 1) turning too sharply so the lateral (sideways) forces push the nose away from the direction the craft is travelling, and 2) your center of lift is too high so it isn't able to counter balance the lateral forces and keep the craft in a (generally) straight path like the fletchings on an arrow or dart."

KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,bobbertmiller,4,Sun Jun 14 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if I am getting this right, I just need to send out a ship geared up just like the one out there, but with an extra seat for Jeb. Then I send Podlas out on EVA and he goes back and forth between the original craft and the new one transferring all the data from each unit. Old craft stays in orbit, new craft goes home with all the science and Jeb. Correct?"
KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,HonzaSchmonza,6,Sun Jun 14 17:29:04 2015 UTC,"Yup.  You can gather up all the data in one go - there's no limit to how much data a Kerbal can carry.  I've had as many as 75 experiments worth of data on a Kerbal at a time.  Basically, you can treat it like any other rescue mission, except that you also need to rescue the data."
KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,EdgeofCosmos,3,Sun Jun 14 17:31:33 2015 UTC,Awesome. This is great. I didn't know you could do that. Now I just need to figure out how to intercept that ship!
KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,EdgeofCosmos,3,Sun Jun 14 17:34:22 2015 UTC,"You can store all the science in the capsule, you can't store it in experiment boxes afaik (no goo canisters etc). So just bring an empty seat and something to get you there and back."
KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,FaceDeer,3,Sun Jun 14 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, sweet, even better. I'll just send a cheapo stripped down ship out there and grab all the data and Jeb. Awesome, thanks."
KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,Dweller,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"You might have solved it already but you don't actually need to copy the experiment parts on your new ship. The scientific data is stored on little thumb drives that the Kerbals keep in their pockets. When you are on EVA hover near one of the experiments and right click it, ""collect data"", then return to your pod and on the left of your screen there will be a (hopefully) long list of data ""added to capsule"" or equivalent. This is so that you only have to bring back the pod, much like in real life.   In fact the storage capacity in a pod is theoretically endless. My personal maximum has been around 30 different sets returned in one pod with one science dude."
KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,HonzaSchmonza,8,Mon Jun 15 09:23:55 2015 UTC,"Do you have no solar panels? If you don't, this will probably not work, since releasing parachutes won't be possible. Anyway, here goes.   Wait until apoapsis. Do an EVA with Jeb. Get him to push the ship retrograde with his jetpack. When you're running low on jetpack juice, go back inside. EVA again and you'll have a full jetpack. Keep doing this until your periapsis enters the atmosphere (Pe = 50km should be ok. Once at Pe, you'll aerobrake, and your Apoapsis will deteriorate. After a few orbits, you'll aerobrake enough to enter the atmosphere completely. From here, just land normally."
KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,RoeddipusHex,3,Sun Jun 14 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize the parachutes didn't work without electric charge. I've never run out of power before. I forgot the solar panels, so the juice in the pod didn't last long. I didn't really expect to make it to the mun. I thought about pushing, but my orbit is basically that of the mun, which would be a ton of pushing. Also, without SAS (no power) the ship is quite difficult to push without spinning it around. I think I am gonna try and recover the data, abandon the ship, and pick Jeb up in a rendezvous ship."
KerbalAcademy,39tjvj,Sugarbeet,3,Sun Jun 14 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know if they don't work. Haven't tried it. But I seem to remember that staging doesn't work without electricity, so I guess that would mean chutes too.  I think I would go with the rendezvous option, yeah."

Pretty sure it's not due to any of the mods I have installed.  Failing that, maybe have Jeb try to trigger the chute manually while on EVA? If you set the chute's ""min pressure"" high enough it won't deploy until the craft is in the lower atmosphere, after having aerobraked sufficiently for the chutes to survive. Don't know if there's an option for triggering them on EVA though, haven't tried before."

You can use the AGU like a docking port, so they basically docked and I was able to transfer fuel (alt-right click a fuel tank) to Jebs ship and get him home.  First rendezvous, first docking, first fuel transfer and first rescue mission. I was googling a lot this morning."

You will find it very frustrating docking on the dark side."
KerbalAcademy,39tipd,Logicalpeace,3,Sun Jun 14 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"This due to the accuracy of the physics integration of Unity. When using time warp only gravity is applied, such that the Kepler equation can be used to find a closed solution. When other forces are applied, such as atmospheric forces or the forces of rocket engines, there will not be a general closed solution. This is where physics integration comes in, which can approximate almost any kind of forces, however it will build up errors over time. Thus when only gravity is applied it will alter the orbit over time compared to the closed solution of a Kepler orbit. If you mainly use time warp when moving through orbits it should not alter the predicted Kepler orbit that much."
KerbalAcademy,39tipd,fibonatic,2,Sun Jun 14 20:21:15 2015 UTC,Are you saying it's happening because the save is getting old? Cause it happens on new games too. The very first launch.
KerbalAcademy,39tipd,pacology,4,Mon Jun 15 00:53:27 2015 UTC,"I noticed it too. My orbit changes by a little bit (maybe 2 or 3 meters) in space without any force being applied to my ship.  I think it has to do with the code changes for the sphere of influence calculations. If I remember correctly, orbits in 1.0 are recalculated from your previous state instead of your last burn. That might introduce errors in the calculations that become visible as flickering orbits (it's still like a 0.01% error, but it is still noticeable)."
KerbalAcademy,39tipd,shakefu,2,Mon Jun 15 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"It happens rather quickly for me. I have a station around Minmus that started at a 60km x 60km orbit, but it only takes a minute or two before my periapsis drops a kilometer."

You can reduce this effect by lowering the maximum physics time step in the settings. People are also working on a mod which should improve on this (and add N-body gravity).  PS: I assume you mean something like this?"
KerbalAcademy,39tipd,leforian,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:52:54 2015 UTC,"the ""like this"" link has an explanation -- its in physics warp, not time warp. this should use the physics integrator, because it thinks it needs to calculate the orbit step-by-step every frame.  but, this also happens in time warp, where things should essentially be on rails."
KerbalAcademy,39tipd,leforian,2,Mon Jun 22 19:18:35 2015 UTC,I have never had it myself but if I did I would try time warping up to 5X and then back down again. Maybe try throttling up and then down and then turning RCS on and telling it to translate in every direction in case a thruster is stuck on for some reason. If you don't have any RCS or thrusters maybe try changing where you are controlling the craft from? If you have multiple pieces docked together try undocking them and see if one or both continue to accelerate. Someone else may have a better answer but since no one has yet I figure I would give it a shot.

The mod shows you the thrust vectors of all the rcs ports that fire when translating or rotating a particular direction, and any torque that may be applied to your craft (from imbalanced placement).   kspacey is correct. You have a thruster pointing NE and SE, so when you want to go E, they both fire. You will move E because the N and S components of the thrusters' forces cancel out, while the two E componemts add together. Less efficient but gets the job done."

KerbalAcademy,39s1b7,bobbertmiller,8,Mon Jun 15 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"You should not place them near the COM, but as far away as possible. They get a bigger 'arm' for the moment they generate, and are then more fuel efficient.  There is a use for RCS at the COM if you want to do docking, because these generate translation instead of rotation.  But, if you space hem symmetrically around the COM, the COM is balanced out.  Best configuration for a long object is four at the top, four at the bottom. Make sure that top and bottom have equal distances from the COM. This means that one set doesn't fully go to the bottom/top. This maximizes fuel efficiency, and minimizes unintended side effects (translations when you want to rotate)."
KerbalAcademy,39s1b7,Eric_S,5,Sun Jun 14 07:14:59 2015 UTC,"There is a use for RCS at the COM if you want to do docking, because these generate translation instead of rotation.   That's usually my only reason for having RCS on the ship (or more often, on my docking tug)"
KerbalAcademy,39s1b7,bobbertmiller,2,Sun Jun 14 17:04:41 2015 UTC,That's what I do.  I use the Place Anywhere ports for rotation and the thruster blocks for translation.
KerbalAcademy,39s1b7,Eric_S,6,Sun Jun 14 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"RCS doesn't balance anything in stock KSP. If you don't properly put them in the right place, you'll introduce a lot of annoying torque when trying to translate.     Are you using the correct keys (ikjlhn)? Are you 100% certain that they are in the correct location concerning COM, especially when it shifts due to RCS fuel being drained. I would suggest getting at least 2 sets of 3 (2 sets of 4 if that's not too expensive/too heavy), so you have a leaver to get torque in any direction. (Also - pictures are always appreciated ^^)"
KerbalAcademy,39s1b7,Ketsa,2,Sun Jun 14 06:43:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you turn on fine controls (caps lock by default on Win, not sure about other platforms), there is a normalization function that kicks in.  I still prefer placing RCS quads correctly, but it's not critical if you use that."

KerbalAcademy,39m02u,nivlark,10,Sat Jun 13 06:08:04 2015 UTC,"In terms of the maths, the ∆v for a plane change is 2 v sin(∆i/2), where v is your current velocity, and ∆i is the inclination change you want to make. In other words, the required ∆v is directly proportional to your velocity, which (by Kepler's 3rd law) is in turn related to your altitude. So high-altitude plane changes are cheaper because you're travelling slower.  For some insight as to why plane changes are expensive, think of your velocity as a sum of two components: one parallel to lines of latitude and another parallel to lines of longitude (ie. at right angles to each other). Now imagine making a 90o plane change, starting from an equatorial orbit (so you'd end up in a polar orbit). Here, the component of velocity in the latitudinal direction has to be reduced from orbital speed to zero, and the one in the longitudinal direction has to get increased from zero to orbital speed. So the magnitude of total ∆v you'd need is then twice the orbital speed.  This isn't the answer the equation at the beginning gives though, because you've taken the 'long way round'. Rather than changing your velocity components one at a time, you can change both at once. This is like walking diagonally across a square rather than along the two edges: the diagonal path is shorter (by a factor of 1/√2). Then the final answer is that a 90o plane change must require a ∆v of √2 times the orbital speed, which is indeed what the equation will give you."

If you want to go in a different direction you'll need to slow down in one direction and speed up (or push off the ice) in a different direction. On a small rink (a small orbit) you need to go faster to keep your balance, so you have a lot of momentum that you need to redirect. (momentum is a product of mass and velocity) On a larger rink (a large orbit) you don't need to go as fast, so you don't have as much momentum to redirect."
KerbalAcademy,39m02u,cantab314,3,Fri Jun 12 18:08:47 2015 UTC,"I drew you a picture: https://flic.kr/p/ujtKcU  I assume you're a five-year-old who's played Kerbal Space Program, and so you sort of know what an orbit is and what a plane change is.  If you know how to do a scale drawing you can do one to work out how much delta-V you'll need to make a plane change of such-and-such degrees. Draw a line for your orbital speed, measure the angle for the plane change from that line, draw a second line the same length, then measure between the ends of those two lines and that's how much delta-V your plane change will need."
KerbalAcademy,39m02u,Deimos_F,2,Sat Jun 13 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"A plane change implies you want to add normal (""sideways"") motion.  When in orbit, you are moving and being subjected to forces in a plane. However, Newtonian physics state that forces separated by 90 degree angles do not affect each other. When you burn for a plane change, you are burning perpendicular to your present plane, so for better or worse, the Oberth effect does not apply.  Think of it in terms of having two sorts of velocity at all times: velocity that is parallel to the plane of your orbit, and velocity that is perpendicular. When you do ""in-plane"" burns, like periapsis burns, you are adding a few m/s to an already existing amount of velocity. However, when changing planes, you need perpendicular velocity, and you have none to start with, which means it will all have to come out of your delta V budget.  Now, for the ease of doing the adjustment in Ap, think about it this way: an eccentric orbit follows a repeating pattern of kinetic energy being turned into potential energy (during the phase in which you gain altitude) and vice-versa (when losing altitude). When you are at Ap, your kinetic energy is at a minimum, as most of it is now converted into potential energy. In high enough eccentric orbits, you will sometimes have Ap velocities below 50m/s. Those 50m/s are enough to propel you into the descending part of the orbit, during which you will hit thousands of m/s. That scaling of the Ap speed is why it's so efficient to make burns there, because at Ap, a little energy goes a long way. If you want to picture a visualization of this, think of it as an egg, balanced vertically, upside-down. Just a small nudge is all you need to point it towards the direction you want it to fall."

(This is also why it's best to take off in the same direction that the planet is going - so that its pull does some of the work (or at least doesn't make things more difficult), and why we use an encounter behind a body to speed up, and ahead of it to slow down.)"

KerbalAcademy,39m02u,krenshala,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:23:08 2015 UTC,"Another way to look at the 'why is it cheaper when farther out' part is leverage.  Near your apoapsis you have a longer level for changing the orbit.  This is also why small changes early on can make larger differences than big changes late in your flight (e.g., a correction burn on the way to the mun just after leaving kerbin vs just before you enter the mun SoI)."

Another example: Approaching a planet far in the distance with a periapsis that is small compared to the distance. Want to change periapsis?

KerbalAcademy,39mpzc,SpuddMeister,8,Fri Jun 12 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"So your target is on an elliptical solar orbit with apoapsis near the orbit of Duna and periapsis between Duna's orbit and Kerbin's orbit.  If the Transfer Window Planner mod supported selecting another ship as your destination, that would be ideal, but I haven't heard of that being implemented yet.  Here's what I'd do (assuming base game with no usable navigation-aid mods and no life support mods to limit the time of flight):   Leave Kerbin when Kerbin passes between the sun and the target orbit's apoapsis, so the apoapsis of the rescue ship's orbit coincides with the periapsis of the target's orbit. If the target is in another part of its orbit when you arrive at the intersection, set a node prograde or retrograde to give you a close approach on the next pass. At this scale, if you can get an approach within a few hundred kilometers, that's close enough for an efficient direct approach. A day or so out from closest approach, put the navball in target mode and start making burns to keep your target-mode prograde vector pointed directly at the target. Gradually decrease the speed as you get closer so you don't overshoot."

What interests me is the 2: there is no gravity to assist you in a capture. I've never thought about how useful gravity is in that regards. In means the orbital speed you might have had for, say, Duna, you will now have to spend twice that delta-v, once for each leg.  So, if you have a Duna vehicle that had not enough fuel and got stuck in solar orbit, you need a massively larger ship (well, delta-v-wise) to rescue the first one.  I dunno, maybe it's easier just to delete the ship from the tracker and use your red folder instead of your blue one to brief the press. :)"

In astrophysics, the surface gravity may be expressed as log g, which is obtained by first expressing the gravity in cgs units, where the unit of acceleration is centimeters per second squared, and then taking the base 10 logarithm.  Therefore, as gravity affects all things equally, regardless of their mass in grams or kilograms, and because 1 m/s2 = 100 cm/s2, the surface gravity of Earth could be expressed in cgs units as 980.665 cm/s2 and at base 10 logarithm (log g) as 2.992.

Set up your maneuver node like normal, but don't start burning early... wait until you're two minutes away and then start burning.  Stop your burn four minutes later, so you've burned for two minutes on each side of the node.  Then delete the node and continue your orbit.  Your Pe will be where the node used to be.  As you approach the Pe again, point prograde and start burning again.  Make sure you burn an equal amount of time on each side of your Pe marker. It can be two minutes, one minute, thirty seconds, whatever...  it can even be different each time around... just make sure each burn is evenly split around your Pe.  Each time you circle around and burn, you're pushing your Ap higher and higher.  Once it gets out to about the Mun's orbit, set up another maneuver node on your Pe to reach your destination and make one longer final burn to complete the transfer.  You may want to start the process a few days before reaching your ideal transfer window, but they're generally wide enough that spending a day or two doing Pe kicks isn't a problem.  It can be a problem if you try to push your Ap all the way out to Minmus or beyond, because that orbit will take a week or longer to complete."

KerbalAcademy,39fodt,XenoRyet,2,Sat Jun 13 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"Probably not a huge amount, but definitely some.  The node assumes you're applying all the delta v instantly, so any time spent burning outside that exact moment is burning a little off axis and wasting some. By burning half thrust, you're essentially digging farther than you need into that regime where people do Pe kicks instead of one long burn to combat losses. The precision at the end is a nice thing though.  I think best bet is to burn full, then throttle back as soon as the nav-ball burn marker starts drifting and finish out at low thrust."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,pentiumwetwired,3,Sun Jun 14 07:46:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've definitely been doing that wrong - I think my basic understanding of the maneuver node was wrong.  I saw it as a target point to complete your burn, but it makes a lot more sense to burn on either side of it.  I assume that burning an unequal amount of time on the one side would result in some sort of lopsided orbit?"
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,krenshala,10,Thu Jun 11 12:49:06 2015 UTC,That is correct. The node assumes you can add all of that delta V all at once exactly on the node. That's not possible without cheats. You have to compensate for that by doing it in halves.

If you need 12:00 total, do it in 3 burns, not two.  If your parking orbit is less than 100km, then you want each burn even shorter. If it's larger than 100km, then it can be longer. I usually park at 75km-80km, and in that case you might want about a 4:00 burn on each pass (2:00 on each side of Pe)."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,BlackStar4,4,Thu Jun 11 14:29:14 2015 UTC,"To take it a little further...  The shorter your burns, the more efficient your transfer will be because you're applying all of the thrust closer to the ejection angle.  The lower your orbit (meaning you have a quicker orbital period), the more critical this becomes because you're moving a greater distance around the orbit for any particular length of time.  And you always want to make your burns as low as possible so that you're moving faster and can take greater advantage of the Oberth effect."

Since it WILL move, there's some grey area, but they found that you can get about 2:30 on each side of the node without too much fuel waste.

What I have found is the optimal plan is to aim prograde and ever so slightly radial or antiradial(in the direction of the maneuver marker so that you don't accidentally dip back into the atmosphere) and burn until you have 25 m/s or so delta v left to go.   Then aim directly for the maneuver marker and finish the burn.  This should get you the planned encounter.  Of course, same thing that if your burn is more than 4 minutes, just burn prograde 2 minutes before to 2 minutes after periapsis until your final burn is less than 4 minutes then do the above."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,Bananasauru5rex,3,Thu Jun 11 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"Options:   add more engines (or change engine type) so you have better acceleration (which means a much higher launch mass and cost) divide your burns into a series of periapsis kicks and burn a portion of the total dv each time you pass the designated burn point (as defined by the planner).   Number 1 is usually easier (assuming you have the money and/or launch capacity), but less elegant and efficient.    Number 2 can get a bit tedious, and you should try to avoid overdoing it and extending the burns beyond a few orbits - otherwise you can end up missing your window and burning off-target like you are now.  But it is usually the best option, especially for longer journeys (like Eeloo and Moho).  Edit: and another thing about nukes: use liquid fuel-only tanks (especially the Mk2 & Mk3 parts), as they have better mass fraction than LOX tanks with the oxidizer removed.  E2: spelling"
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,Im_in_timeout,2,Thu Jun 11 12:39:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for the advice.  Number 1 is what I've been doing so far. While it works, it feels like I'm really not doing it in an optimal way. Also, I struggle to get much higher than 11.5k delta V on a craft with a lot of big engines.  I've heard of people with 17k+ dV on crafts using nuclear engines, which is why I tried it out. I think my issue was that I wasn't dividing the burns up like you've suggested - going to give it a go tonight :)."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,burrowowl,5,Thu Jun 11 12:43:53 2015 UTC,"In 0.90 the gains of having a nuclear engine was just so stupid that there was almost never a case where any other engine would out-perform a nuclear engine in vacuum. In 1.xx, they've balanced the nuke engines so that at low fuel amounts you'll do much better with another, lighter engine, and at higher fuel amounts you have to deal with the abysmal TWR.  If I'm doing horrible Jool missions with space stations then, yes, Nuclear engines are going to save a lot of mass for equal dV, but I do try my hardest just to use the much more convenient and fun high thrust vacuum engines (even a reliant has less mass and 3x more thrust, even though it's far from being an optimal vacuum engine)."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,burrowowl,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to build a new craft now and see what you mean - its a tradeoff between maximum delta V and minimum inconvenience! A 20 minute burn time will really hurt, especially since the AI seems to wobble when targeting a node, making time warp a pain.  I see the LV 909 mentioned quite a lot in place of a nuke engine, might give that a try too"
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,Baron_Munchausen,3,Thu Jun 11 15:14:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, any of the autopilot locks seem really bugged in 1.xx. I never use them for the actual burns because you lose a bit of dV when the gimble is moving around.  Mainsail, Skipper, reliant, swivel if you need thrust.  909 and 48 7s are both incredible for efficiency since they have such low mass.  Nuke when you're frustrated."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,grottohopper,2,Thu Jun 11 20:40:03 2015 UTC,Adding engine mass to increase your TWR in space will lower your Delta V.
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,Pharisaeus,3,Thu Jun 11 15:03:44 2015 UTC,"For interplanetary missions a course correction once you are out of Kerbin's SOI is also an option, and it usually does not require much delta v to get you back on an intercept course."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,grottohopper,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"I'm slowly getting better at this, adjusting my intercept manually once I've left Kerbin's SOI. I have encountered situations where I just couldn't see a way to fix the orbit though, mainly when my target has an inclined orbit (like Moho).  That is probably down to inexperience though - I'm sure there was a way to do it. I ended up reloading and getting an intercept, however I raced past Moho at 5500m/s and wasn't able to orbit it :("
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,Deimos_F,3,Thu Jun 11 14:45:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, inclined orbits are much trickier. Sometimes I try to match planes with the target planet. But there's almost always going to be a low delta v intercept path. Sometimes it's just really hard to find."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,Deimos_F,3,Thu Jun 11 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"It depends how low thrust you're going.  With nuclear engines, put down the node, and check out the estimated burn time. If it has 10 minutes, then you'll need to start burning 5 minutes before the node (burning equally on each side of the node).   If you have sufficiently skilled pilots or probe cores, you'll be able to set them to keep pointing at the node, and you can physical timewarp (alt + >) whilst burning to reduce the real world time of the burn (so a twenty minute burn would be 5 minutes, with SAS holding position the node, that's enough time to get a cup of tea, or poke Reddit for a bit).  You can also do a series of perigee kicks, burning at periapsis for a couple of minutes several times, then coasting back to perigee to do it again - slowly you'll raise your apogee to escape the SOI.  With really low thrust engines, such as electrical engines and solar sails - (just ion engines in stock, but there are plenty of mod options out there), the above will work fine for interplanetary corrections and highly eccentric orbits, but is more difficult/frustratingly lengthy with closer orbits.  In those situations it can be worthwhile to have the pilot/core pointing at the prograde or retrograde marker with time acceleration, so you'll end up tracing a spiral path as you slowly raise your orbit. It's not the most efficient way to do it (you lose dV due to gravity losses, and you can easily end up having to correct yourself once you've left the SOI), but it's also fairly straightforward. The advantage here is that low-thrust usually implies high-isp, so you'll have plenty of room for error.  Stock nuclear engines (and modded nuclear and electric engines) usually have problems with overheating - do bear that in mind before starting a thirty minute burn - it's not going to be any good if you're going to melt after five minutes. Radiators, and (stock) wing parts can help here."

KerbalAcademy,39fodt,archon286,2,Thu Jun 11 21:54:17 2015 UTC,I thought planing your burn so you start burning early and hit the node half-way through the burn was all you needed to do.  Is that not the case?
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,Deimos_F,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"As I understand, basically it is, but the problem comes in when an engine is so slow to burn that it would take far too long to burn on either side.  The solution, as others have kindly pointed out, is to split the burn up, breaking it down into several parts using your new periapsis as the maneuver node point each time."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,TacosArePeopleToo,2,Thu Jun 11 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, but if I don't mind waiting for a long burn that is perfectly split in half around the node, is there any downside?"
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,rogueop,3,Thu Jun 11 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"The downside is lots of wasted fuel.  Thrusting any direction other than prograde costs you steering losses, and thrusting any direction other than toward the blue node marker is pushing you in the wrong direction.  To do it efficiently, you need to burn while your prograde marker is close to the node marker.  That  only happens for a couple of minutes each orbit."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,Deconceptualist,2,Thu Jun 11 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"A downside I discovered last night that transferring from a 200km circular orbit to a Dres encounter in one burn takes long enough that for my particular craft, the fuel tank overheated and exploded.  Next time, my parking/waiting apoapsis before interplanetary launches is going to be about 2-3 km from maximum Kerbin orbit. Although, if your craft is massive enough, a single nuke engine still might not be enough to complete burns to other planets in one go without overheating something."
KerbalAcademy,39fodt,joe-h2o,2,Thu Jun 11 15:54:22 2015 UTC,You'll find that ejection burns are more efficient closer to Kerbin - I'd aim to leave the system from a 100k orbit rather than a 200k one.

Rockets use lots of fuel fast, so this can mean your CoM is shifting in unexpected ways. Make sure you have enough control authority at high altitudes.  Air is different up there, so you might need some reaction wheels too. Pay attention to your center of thrust if you have any off-axis asymmetric engines.  Generally all engines should thrust through the CoM, even if that means they're angled weird."

KerbalAcademy,39guci,XenoRyet,3,Fri Jun 12 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"You could try to get fancy with fuel lines to make sure you're draining in a way that keeps the remaining fuel centered. Another approach that is sometimes easier is to just place your wings and control surfaces such that the craft is flyable in both full fuel and no fuel states.  That should end up with it working everywhere in between as well. If you can get a picture of the spaceplane in question, you can post it and people can offer some specific advice."
KerbalAcademy,39guci,Gerfalcon,2,Fri Jun 12 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"Everything XenoRyet said is important, especially the stuff about fuel. The main difference between jets/turbojets/RAPIERs and everything else is that those engines drain evenly from every tank on the craft, whereas all others drain from the ""furthest"" tank first, which means CoM changes differently.  Otherwise, advice might need to be more specific. What kind of applications are you looking for out of your spaceplane?"
KerbalAcademy,39guci,Gerfalcon,2,Fri Jun 12 15:09:08 2015 UTC,Well lately Ive been using them for things like science scans contracts around Kerbin at various altitudes. It takes many trials before I get something stable that has enough rocket fuel to get me to the higher altitudes. Just trying to get a better understanding of why it works so I can build better planes.
KerbalAcademy,39guci,rickyharline,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"Well depending on how high you need to go, the easier thing might be to wait for better plane parts like the turbojet and the MKII fuselages, if you don't already have those parts. Turbojets ought to be powerful enough (with a good high altitude thrust curve) to do suborbital hops to anywhere you want to go, and MK II parts just look super cool, add extra lift, and allow for better mass ratios on your LF tanks.  If you really want to stick to the rocket plane design I would check some things before every launch. Check to make sure your CoL stays behind CoM as tanks drain completely and from the front to the back, which can move CoM a lot depending on the size of your craft. You can't really stop this from happening, unless you want to try pumping fuel around the plane mid flight, which could help. However, you can design your lifting surfaces around it to make sure your craft is always stable. Your CoL might have to be well behind your starting CoM to ensure stability later in flight.  Also, if you really feel like you need more fuel, don't be afraid to make use of drop tanks ducted into the main body and attached by decouplers. Just make sure that you consider how burning and jettisoning these tanks will affect your CoM-CoL relationship and you should be fine."
KerbalAcademy,39guci,rickyharline,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:04:44 2015 UTC,"It is hard to build planes without FAR since stock you have way to get feedback regarding the design of your plane. Using your COM and COL tools in the hangar is an extremely problematic and unrealistic way of determining pitch stability. Your COL moves around during flight depending on speed and angle of attack, so what the hell does your COL bobble represent? I have no clue, and no one else seems to either, so completely ditch it. If you're willing to adopt FAR (even if only on a separate install for design) and RCS Build Aid than this may help. Well, honestly, you could still do the wing area calculation without either and the COM movement minimization with just RCS Build Aid, but building a spaceplane that flies is a large task, and doing it blind is spectacularly frustrating and difficult."

You should only need about 3500-3800 m/s delta-v to reach orbit now (and potentially even less), so assuming that your maneuvers are reasonably efficient, it now takes 3800+860+(210+640)*2= 6360 m/s delta-v, plus a little for fudging things."
KerbalAcademy,39cx4x,Eric_S,3,Wed Jun 10 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"the first time i made it to orbit in 1.0, i did it in 3600 dv.  I was astounded and immediately re-checked all the numbers, then launched it again, did a better gravity turn, and got to orbit in 3400 dv. /anecdote"
KerbalAcademy,39cx4x,tippyc,2,Thu Jun 11 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"If you get a good gravity turn you can reach orbit with only about 3.3 to 3.5km/s of Δv instead of the 4.3km/s I used to need with 0.90 and FAR.  I'm using nuFAR, but as far as I know the differences are small enough the numbers should be the same."
KerbalAcademy,39cx4x,krenshala,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"I remember getting to orbit on 3300-3500 m/s delta-v under FAR.  While that range was quite normal in 1.0, with some people managing to do it in as little as 2800 m/s, I personally haven't managed to do better than 3500 m/s vacuum delta-v in 1.0.2, which thickened the atmosphere a bit.    I don't doubt that you can do better than 3500 m/s delta-v in 1.0.2, I just can't do it myself, and if I can't pull it off (probably close to 2k hours played), I'm not going to assume that someone else can."
KerbalAcademy,39cx4x,Eric_S,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:36:08 2015 UTC,My current design (very early career) is failing to reach orbit at 3.7km/s Δv.  Very frustrating since an earlier design using a prototype 909 (that I haven't unlocked yet) gets to orbit on only 3.4km/s.  I'm still not sure where the difference is though I think its extra drag on the newer ship (pair of radial Flea SRBs) eating more than the 'extra' potential change in velocity.
KerbalAcademy,39cx4x,krenshala,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"Launchpad TWR matter quite a bit. The faster you're going the less time you spend fighting gravity and the more you spend working with gravity (within various limits). Alternatively you might be too fast and blowing past terminal velocity (probably not, even with those boosters, I hit TV from 300-500 m/s), in which case drag is eating the dv."
KerbalAcademy,39cx4x,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:14:07 2015 UTC,"Its probably TWR in this case as the design that works has a TWR of 1.65.  I aim for a 1.6 to 1.7 but this design is only about 1.35 due to weight limitations (18t, and none of the 45 point tech nodes unlocked)."
KerbalAcademy,39cx4x,krenshala,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:38:20 2015 UTC,Was there ever an explanation for why they thickened the atmo in 1.0.2? The change seemed swift and sudden.   I rather liked the atmosphere in 1.0.
KerbalAcademy,39cx4x,Alizerin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"It's was part of the battle of reentering pods vs spaceplanes. Pods need an atmosphere that doesn't give a command pod a near-mach terminal velocity, but spaceplanes prefer thinner atmospheres, it seems.  In 1.0.3, it sounds like rather than just tweaking the global parameters (which is what they did in 1.0.1 and 1.0.2), they've accepted that there isn't a good compromise altering just the global parameters, so they're tweaking a few other things as well.  They're also doing some major changes to how reentry heat is managed for similar reasons."
KerbalAcademy,39arfn,wtfplane,11,Wed Jun 10 14:04:24 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, there is a special antenna that you must use on every probes. It's the omni directional one with the lowest range because it starts as 'activated'. You can use it until you reach space, then activate your longer range ones.   You can check your connection status using the flight computer in the top left corner of the screen, just below the time accelerator. The icon looks like a calculator. If it's green, you are connected, if it's red, you are not."
KerbalAcademy,39arfn,ElDyudo,11,Wed Jun 10 14:12:47 2015 UTC,The other antennas can also be made to start activated by right-clicking on them in the VAB — but as /u/killing1sbadong points out most of those won't survive the ascent.

KerbalAcademy,399sh3,NoNoughT,5,Wed Jun 10 07:41:43 2015 UTC,Do you have a surface scanning module at the asteroid? It has some asteroid-related things in its config file.  You may need to use a surface scanner to prove that the material you're drilling from the asteroid is Ore before you're allowed to put it in an Ore tank.
KerbalAcademy,399sh3,undercoveryankee,2,Wed Jun 10 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"Is this a guess? Normally the surface scanning module is optional.  Also according to ""Moon / Planet and Asteroid Mining Guide"" on the Steam forums you don't need any kind of scanners."
KerbalAcademy,399sh3,TriTraTrololol,4,Wed Jun 10 15:01:18 2015 UTC,"It's an educated guess based on the following:   The surface scanning module has code in its config file for identifying resources on asteroids. At least some versions of RoverDude's pre-1.0 Asteroid Recycling Technologies mod had a part that you were supposed to use to measure the composition of an asteroid.   Since there's no other reason I can see that OP's miner wouldn't work, I suggested trying the next thing that I would try if it were me experiencing the problem."

KerbalAcademy,399xm9,BeefyNuggets,5,Wed Jun 10 08:48:10 2015 UTC,"I like to stay close to the original game too but I surrendered to a couple of mods that should just be standard.  Top one is Kerbal Engineer.  Without it you're playing in the kids' pool, really (unless you make your Δv calculations the hardcore way).  Another one that is relevant here is the Docking Port Alignment Indicator (Edit: or the Navball Docking Alignment Indicator).  In the original game, your instruments provide the direction of the target docking port and your motion compared to it and that's it.  There's no way around it, the orientation and rotation of your ship compared to the port are a necessary, yet missing feature.  You have to do it visually instead.  I've done it for the longest time.  My technique is to come close enough to see the orientation of the target, try to orient my ship the same way, then only use translational movements to align in front of the port while keeping my orientation, kill all lateral speed and move forward slowly.  As I get closer I notice that my orientation is not accurate and I correct accordingly.  It's a cycle of: orient your ship with the port (use top and side view), align in front of the port (center the target prograde indicator), move strictly forward (center the prograde indicator).  Repeat as you get closer.  Maybe you'll want to try that a few times, just to know you can do it, but after that I highly recommend a mod that provides orientation information.  It's not really cheating as it doesn't dock for you, it merely provides information."
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,bluepepper,3,Wed Jun 10 11:31:05 2015 UTC,Seconded. The Navyfish docking aid is just as important as KER in my arsenal.
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,Pyromaniacal13,3,Wed Jun 10 12:11:43 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer the navball docking indicator, but yeah, one or another is essential."
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,asaz989,2,Wed Jun 10 12:49:59 2015 UTC,"Ohh, that's brilliant! I didn't know that one.  I like the fact that it works with the existing navball rather than an extra screen, my main beef with the DPAI.  It also uses a single indicator for both orientation and rotation, which is clean and minimalistic as I like.  I'm gonna try it!"
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,bluepepper,3,Wed Jun 10 13:17:36 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer; this only works when the target is near 0 degrees inclination and when you have an encounter lower than let's say 1 - 2 km.  What I often do is have the target docking port point anti-normal (just Control from Here on that docking port and rotate to anti-normal, engage SAS). Then when approaching the target from the other vehicle at around 5 km's out make sure the nav-ball is orientated so translating up is North and translating down is South. From the approaching vehicle the target port is now pointing downwards.   I then start translating left and right to see which way makes the Closest approach go down. When that is known I'll try to get the Closest approach as low as possible by translating left or right. When I cannot get it lower I start translating up and down to check out wether I will pass under or above the target. When I see that I will pass over it I start translating down until the Closest approach goes up again (which means I now pass under the target instead of above).  So now we have a situation where I will pass directly under the target. I usually make sure the approach distance is around 40 - 50 meters. When I hit the closest approach I'm directly under the target docking port. Now turn the approaching craft to Normal and make a few last translation corrections to put the middle of the nav-ball directly over the target. Translate forward to a few meters per second and you're done!  EDIT: spelling and stuff"
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,LockStockNL,3,Wed Jun 10 12:26:09 2015 UTC,"The few hints I can give are the following. Don't use ""docking mode"", go for two handed keyboard controls with wasd and the right side (hn etc). Press ""v"" to change the camera mode so it rotates with your craft."
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,bobbertmiller,3,Wed Jun 10 14:56:23 2015 UTC,"Another thing that might help is to do what is called (I think) ""pulling prograde."" It makes rendezvous cheaper by burning on the opposite side of the target indicator from your prograde marker, so you don't constantly cancel velocity. I've found another application in the docking aspect. Once your ports are decently aligned, you can use RCS translation to keep your prograde exactly over the target indicator, and your rotation controls to keep the ports aligned as you move. As others have said, using the two handed controls on the staging menu works better for this. But by using this, you should only need to disable SAS on contact and be closely aligned enough to be pulled in."
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,Gerfalcon,3,Wed Jun 10 16:46:04 2015 UTC,You can 'control from here' on a docking port which can make it easier also setting the docking port itself as target (both accessible through right clicking and I'm generally assuming you do this already).    Generally I find good RCS placement is key.  Whenever I place a 'Thruster Block' I place a 'Place-Anywhere 7 RCS Port' under it.  Large vessels can be hard to dock due to their mass.  Good RCS placement is key.
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,bigorangemachine,4,Thu Jun 11 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I've used 2 methods mainly.   Just hit it. Target the docking port on the other craft, control from your docking port, align your prograde and the target indicator, go for it. If you're at an angle, don't care. Disable SAS on contact and you should be pulled straight (even with big ships) Just grab it. Use the claw instead of a docking port, point to target, ram it. But not too fast."
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,TheNosferatu,3,Wed Jun 10 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"Bottom line, docking in stock is a pain.  Ive done it, it wasn pretty, and its really silly not to use a mod.  There are simple mods that can do the trick, and more complex ones as well.  Frankly, the simple ones are enough, but without mods, its just a really complicated clunky procedure.  In reality, no one would be able to dock the way the games asks you to do it in stock.  You need a camera, or some kind of alignment indicator."
KerbalAcademy,399xm9,HODOR00,3,Wed Jun 10 13:26:35 2015 UTC,"Bottom line, docking in stock is a pain   Not trying to be smarty mouth arrogant SOB, but after a few dozen dockings in stock it becomes much less of a pain.

""control from here"" on your ships relevant docking port. You will see the target indicator on your navball. RCS on! Maybe turn on precision mode (capslock) if needed. I don't use docking mode at all but i,j,k,l,h,n keys. All you need is the navball from now on!

I can get crafts with 4500dv into circular orbit with just enough spare fuel to get to the Mun. Hope this helps!"

If your capsule was decelerating once it entered the atmosphere, but didn't slow down that much, then I'm going to guess that you're using a very strange, dense, and low-drag mod part and that everything that is happening is correct.  If it was accelerating downwards the whole time then you ran into a very difficult to reproduce bug that I think I killed in the last few dev builds, if you want to go on github and try them."

I have experienced what OP refers to a few times, but only when doing a suborbital hop up above 35km, but staying within sight of the space center.  If I attempt orbit and fail to get there (say, only 2.5km Δv) however, I usually don't have the problem and slow down below Mk16 destruction speeds at 4km at worst."

In the early stages of the game, when your goal is just to get to 70k, you would have the capsule's on-board life support. Then, to do an orbit you would need to add a simple life support canister good for 3 hours. After that, a larger canister, say 3 day's worth, to get you to the Mun and back. Then maybe you would unlock a recycler, to make your life support more efficient. And so on..."

Also launching into an as low as possible (say 6-7 km) around the Mun can also help optimize the usuage of your delta-v, however like Eric_S stated you will still be short a significant amount of delta-v which can't be compensated. Getting your periapsis around Kerbin as low as possibly will make it cheaper to perform a rescue mission."
KerbalAcademy,392r5p,manondorf,2,Tue Jun 9 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think your best bet is to floor it and not let up.  If you can do this, it will be by taking advantage of the oberth effect so that a little bit of extra delta-v at the bottom of the Mun's gravity well translates out to more velocity as you leave the SoI."

I think Jeb is going to need to stay on the mun for a while."
KerbalAcademy,392r5p,manondorf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"1,300,000m seems like a pretty reasonable number for 780 m/s when launching from the munar surface.  I assume you have no RCS?  You can often squeeze out enough delta-v from even a small RCS tank.  Best bet if possible is an immediate pitch over prograde (with a tiiiiiiiny bit of radial) so that a ~750 m/s ejection burn is retrograde from the mun and punch it the whole way, but I don't like your chances of saving 100 m/s due to piloting issues.   Edit: FWIW, a rescue mission is easier in space, so it might be best to use that 780 m/s to get into a nice ~25km orbit around the mun and have jeb hitchhike from there."

If you're patient, wait until Kerbin is directly overhead (a straight line drawn between Mun and Kerbin passes through your spacecraft, inclination is irrelevant), take off and head toward 90deg -level with the horizon. Then GO!  Burn hard, burn fast, don't look back because you're going home!  This method will cause you to ""fall"" out of Mun's orbit retrograde to your Kerbin orbit. It may or may not put you in the atmosphere, but it gives you your best shot.   You can also do this when you're not directly in line with the planet, but it will cost you more dV.  If you're impatient though, just remember that the goal is to go out behind Mun (to the right if viewed above), so it might be worth boosting suborbital then making the last full throttle burn to freedom when your orbit passes that magical line."

KerbalAcademy,3902ys,Quetzacoatel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:46:18 2015 UTC,I just looked into that and you're correct! Any scripts that are triggered/running in kOS before connection is lost will continue to run even after signal is lost.   I still wish that a simple time-delayed part action could be configured in the RT flight computer though... but I guess tomorrow I start learning kOS!
KerbalAcademy,3902ys,aThingy,2,Mon Jun 8 10:34:55 2015 UTC,You can use a time delay in the flight computer for parts. In the bottom right of the expanded window it has a delay setting with a default of zero. Set it using the same format you see when waiting for a node (1d23h5m0s or just 2m23s) and then manipulate the part you want to trigger. It'll show up in the expanded window.   Don't forget to reset the delay to zero when you're done!
KerbalAcademy,3902ys,quantizeddreams,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:20:50 2015 UTC,"Huh, I could have sworn I'd played with that setting and had trouble getting the delay to apply to those sorts of things. I'll have to give it another shot. Thanks!"
KerbalAcademy,3902ys,bondiblueos9,2,Mon Jun 8 14:49:00 2015 UTC,You can queue commands greater than the signal delay. There is a little box at the bottom right of the control window that says signal delay. Just type in the amount (in seconds) that you want that command to execute. I do use this option when i enter atmosphere and i need to close all my satellite dishes during decent.

KerbalAcademy,3902ys,DaysedAndConfused,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. To give a bit more details: type your desired delay in the box, then be sure to click the > button, then click on the part of your ship and click the button to do the action. Nothing will happen, but you will see the command appear in the queue with the desired delay. Unfortunately I think this only works for actions you can currently take, so for example, if your antenna is extended and you want to queue up a command to extend it, you will have to first retract it, then you can queue the command to extend it, then reset the delay and extend it again.  Also don't forget to reset the delay to 0 after you've finished queuing your delayed actions, otherwise you may have an unexpected surprised later."
KerbalAcademy,38y0kr,Miister152,26,Sun Jun 7 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"It's a more complicated function.  Let's say you want a Hohmann transfer between a circular orbit of radius r and a circular orbit of radius R.  A Hohmann transfer orbit has a semimajor axis of (r+R)/2 and the spacecraft is on it for exactly 1/2 of an orbital period (from periapsis to apoapsis or from apoapsis to periapsis).  The orbital period of an orbit is 2*pi*sqrt(a3/GM) seconds, so the amount of time spent on the transfer orbit is t=pi*sqrt((r+R)3/8GM) seconds.  Since the spacecraft on the transfer orbit must meet the second object after t seconds, we just need to figure out where the second object is t seconds earlier, to figure out when we need to burn.    The second object goes around 2*pi radians in a time of 2*pi*sqrt(R3/GM) seconds, or 1/sqrt(R3/GM) radians per second.  That means that in pi*sqrt((r+R)3/8GM) seconds it will have gone around pi*sqrt((r+R)3/8R3) radians.  So the required angle between the two objects when the maneuver takes place is pi*(1-((r+R)/(8R))3/2).  If we assume that r = b*R, we can simplify it to pi*(1-((b+1)/(2))3/2).  So you can find the angle between two objects given only the ratio between their orbital radii.  If you want it in terms of degrees instead of radians, it's 180*(1-((b+1)/(2))3/2).  For example, if you're transferring to an orbit 5 times the diameter, the angle would be pi*(1-((0.2+1)/(2))3/2) = 1.68 radians, or 96 degrees."

KerbalAcademy,38y0kr,undercoveryankee,3,Mon Jun 8 00:01:34 2015 UTC,"The math to calculate the phase angle for a Hohmann transfer doesn't care whether you're transferring from a parking orbit to a target or from one planet to another. For any case with circular, coplanar orbits, you can use the equations in the first section of http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/16511-Tutorial-Interplanetary-How-To-Guide.  The phase angle is a function of the origin radius and the destination radius, but the two radii appear separately in the equations, so it's not practical to express the phase angle as a function of any single variable."

I'm gonna try and answer the question you're not quite asking: How do I do what MechJeb does, on my own, to such high precision?  The answer is, I think, exactly the way MechJeb does a lot of things under the hood: By making a guess, checking the result, adjusting some variables, checking again, and continuing until you're close enough.   I'd recommend picking up the kOS mod and playing around with that. You may discover what I did: that the computer can do approximations and corrections so amazingly fast that the result can be even more accurate than a good formula, and a lot easier to wrap your head around.   In the meantime, learn to use the maneuver node editor. It is incredibly powerful, and abstracts out a LOT of the really tough math of orbital mechanics by letting you use trial-and-error to plan your orbit just right before you ever have to fire your thrusters."

Trying to place the aerodynamic center properly is almost impossible when you don't have linear aerodynamics, so there's not much point in showing it.     I thought that engineers determined the maximum fore and aft CG for weight and balance using the centers of mass and lift? Even the FAA talks about their relationship relating to stability. Is this idea a simplification to try and help us non-engineers understand the physics or something? I think I was taught this in ground school, and I've always thought about it this way when doing a weight and balance.   I've been physicsing wrong?!

D=    No, that's all accurate if you can assume linear aerodynamics.  The second you can't, you've only got approximations of the aerodynamic center at various angles of attack, and it quickly turns into a complicated mess to use that.  The concept has validity and uses so long as the assumptions made when developing it hold.  The problem is that this is KSP, and so those assumptions rarely hold.  The aerodynamic center moves a lot with angle of attack for rockets, and for anything that doesn't have relatively long wings / wings at low angles of attack the same things happens.  That and it's an approximation at one set point, while a graph can show you data at many set points and give you a better understanding of where things are going.

To determine where to place wings, what size to make them, whether to use canards, have an empennage, etc... Are you aware of any resources that go over using the better tools?    I can explain stability with the static analysis graph pretty easily right now:  Your plane / rocket / flying brick has a moment coefficient (Cm) that tells you how strong the pitching moment on it is.  Positive it up, negative is down.  So for a vehicle to be stable, if it pitches up (from any disturbance) it needs to have a pitch-down (-Cm) moment in order to return to its position.  At the same time, if it pitches down, it needs to have a pitch up moment to bring it back.  Okay, so what's that mean to you?  Remember slopes of lines?  Increase AoA -> decrease Cm implies a negative slope on the line.  So you're looking for the Cm line to slope downwards as AoA increases for the vehicle to be stable.  Anywhere it slopes up, it's unstable (note: this can vary with AoA, some planes become horribly unstable when they stall).  So, open up the graph, do an AoA sweep, and check out the yellow line.  If it slopes down, it's stable (and that indicates the aerodynamic center behind the CoM at that AoA).  If it slopes up, it's unstable.  Change the Mach number around, see how it performs at different AoAs if you want.   How is it possible to determine spaceplane tank arrangement without the concept of center of lift? Other than trying to minimize the change from COM-DCOM, which isn't always effective/possible, how can you decide where to say, put a MK2 cargo bay? If from fore to aft I go command pod --> fuel tank --> cargo bay --> fuel tank --> adapter --> engine(s), for example, I would be basing these decisions based on the COM-COL relationship, and I don't understand how making those decisions without COL is possible.    In practice, I don't worry about the CoL at all until the fuselage is down.  And for that, I'm only looking for the CoM of the drained fuselage to be at the same place as the full fuselage.  Including drop tanks, which, if I'm going to mount them on the wing tips, are temporarily mounted on the fuselage for the time being."

KerbalAcademy,38wc63,d_wootang,6,Sun Jun 7 13:29:12 2015 UTC,"I would suggest getting a couple milestones with no addons. Say reaching orbit and maybe docking. I personally did a Mun landing Apollo style before I installed Mechjeb. I din't calculate delta V by hand or anything. I literally had no idea really how rockets work when I started this game.  It all depends. Kerbal Engineer just give you a readout of numbers that you could do by hand if you knew what they were and how to calculate them. That's not cheating and the people who say it is should give up their smartphones navigation, calculator, internet access, etc...  Mechjeb is cheating. Man that auto dock makes things easy. But hey, I'm a designer not a pilot. I get what I want out of the game.  EDIT: to clarify. Getting some milestones before learning your rockets delta V or thrust to weight ratios lets you go back and have a eureka moment. Like ""oh..

I second the recommendation of getting a handful of milestones before using any (non-cosmetic) mods.  Once you are ready to attempt more complex missions, KER is a great tool.  I figure NASA has a whole panel of actual rocket scientists so getting some help crunching the numbers is fine.    I've tried Mechjeb and was impressed with the tools available but found that it took a lot of the fun out of actually flying my missions.    1) No shame here - rocket science is hard! 2) Simple, not necessarily easy.

I used MechJeb for up through 0.90 and I see the difference as that ""does things for you in game"", where KER gives you the information to make decisions.  But make the game what you want - there is good feedback in here - but you really just need to focus on if the game is making you happy(ish).  After 4 failed attempts to get a probe carrying replacement landers to its destination (due to my remotetech mod making things hard) I finally got there.

Example: I was frustrated by warping past my maneuver nodes, so I installed Kerbal Alarm Clock. Later I was frustrated by spending so much time pulling handles on maneuver nodes, so I installed Precise Node.  Why do it this way? Because you can basically mod away the whole game. With KER and MechJeb and transfer window calculators and dV maps and etc etc you know exactly how much dV is needed, the ship flies itself, KER tells you if the ship you're building in the VAB has enough dV, etc.  For example, I don't use KER because I like not knowing if my ship will get me there, or at least having to do the calculation. I don't use MechJeb because I like piloting myself, including the induced error.

The reason for this is not because it's cheating or whatever, but to get a better feel for the different engines on your own before you get in the habit of just looking at the numbers.  Once you got to the Mun / Minmas, yes, install it. Check out the cons / pros of different engines and see if your craft can make it to planet X before launching. See which small changes you can do to improve the Dv of your existing rockets."

It's also nice to be able to tell (without a spreadsheet) when your mission is doomed and abort rather than realizing it when you run out of fuel.
KerbalAcademy,38wc63,stampylives,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:49:09 2015 UTC,"It's not cheating, but it helps greatly to have it. Without it you have to overengineer a lot because you don't precisely know dV and TWR data.  It's better for you if you learn to eyeball it first imo, though,"
KerbalAcademy,38wc63,rogueop,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:37:33 2015 UTC,"There isn't much in KER that isn't just a simple calculation from numbers that the Kerbals clearly know. A lot of it is just a better presentation of what you can already see... you can look at your thrust and your mass and add up your fuel in the VAB, its safe to assume that the Kerbs know the basic rocket equation. I don't think its cheating to not calculate it manually over and over again.  Also, being able to see readily available info -- like apoapsis, periapsis, and time to whichever -- during launch is a big deal. You already get that info, its just clunky to get to it in the stock UI. No harm in being able to see it in flight views when you can see it in map view."

KerbalAcademy,38xoqw,MyUserNameTaken,3,Sun Jun 7 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be to stick with 0.90 or get used to the new aero.  The thing is, a lot of the engines got changed to balance against the new aero so this isn't the simple ""change the aero back"" request that it appears to be.  The engines probably aren't the only thing that have changed, either.  Without the (limited) occlusion that comes with the new aero system, heat shields won't protect anything, so you'll have to turn off the reentry heat system, possibly adding DRE if you still want reentry heat.  That said, I've heard that there are some config options you can set to get behavior more like the old aerodynamics without actually getting rid of the old aerodynamics.  Having not experimented with it myself, I can only tell you what I remember which may not be correct or complete.  Basically, under the ""Physics/Drag"" panel of the debug console, you'll want to turn on ""Apply Drag As Acceleration Instad of Force"" and ""Replace Drag Cubes With Spherical Model.""  Having never played with it, I don't know how close to the old stock aero this will come.  Frankly, in every thread like this I've seen, if the OP was willing to adapt, they overcame the new aero."

Of course other bodies rotate faster, so there is a significant difference between prograde and retrograde orbits.  Check the KSP wiki for details."
KerbalAcademy,38pkqz,archon286,3,Fri Jun 5 21:40:07 2015 UTC,"Well, you're not crazy. In a retrograde orbit you do need to spend more fuel to land. If you think about it, in a standard orbit you're going in the same direction, similar speeds and you're at X altitude. You need to slow down to lower your altitude and match speeds with the ground to land.  In a retrograde, the same is true, but the difference between your orbit speeds and lander's speeds are much different because you're going opposite directions.  Think of it like this- you're jumping a motor cycle from a ramp onto a moving semi. (awesome!) Which is going to be easier to match speeds with and stop on- the semi coming towards you, or moving away from you? :)  -- Edit Apparantly for Mun/Minmus I needed to see how slow they really rotate. While what I said is true in certain scenarios, it certainly isn't that big of a deal if the rotation speeds of those bodies are as slow as claimed."

KerbalAcademy,38pkqz,Ironeagle155,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"Once you've made your transfer burn (i.e. got an intercept with your destination) look at your predicted trajectory. If it passes ahead of the destination body, you'll end up orbiting it clockwise; if it passes behind, you'll orbit anticlockwise. All bodies in KSP orbit anticlockwise, so this is what you normally want to aim for.  If you are going the wrong way, at any point before you get to the destination you can use a radial burn to flip your orbit to the other side. The sooner you do it, the less fuel it will take. Also use this burn to get your periapsis as low as possible, maximising the Oberth effect and reducing the amount of fuel you need to enter orbit.  This becomes really important when going to Jool's moons. Entering the Jool system 'the wrong way' can give you a velocity of about 10kms-1 relative to the moons, which makes landing a bit tricky!"
KerbalAcademy,38pkqz,Ironeagle155,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:07:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, above or below (relative to Kerbin). The conics make it look the way you describe it, but you always arrive at Mün in front of it - since it's travelling much faster than you are. Using a radial burn isn't the efficient way to control this either - better to fully plan the intercept from your LKO burn and focus the view on Mün to fine tune that prograde burn."
KerbalAcademy,38pkqz,Ironeagle155,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:58:13 2015 UTC,"You could set the patched conics draw mode to 0 in the config. This makes the game render each section of an orbit relative to the celestial body, and thus make it easier to see which way you will be going."

It'll take a few adjustments, but you will keep getting closer and closer.  Once you are close, kill relative velocity completely, hit ] to change to the target ship, and EVA the kerbal to your rescue ship (hopefully you have an empty seat, I can't see more than just the command pod in your pic which would be... unfortunate for your space program)."

KerbalAcademy,38n1nd,Rockleg,7,Fri Jun 5 07:27:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely you'll want your final stage to be a probe core, a command chair, and ion (let this be your safety margin, and give it like 3-5k extra dV just so you can get home from anywhere).  Otherwise, you'll want higher thrust stages, especially for the first kick out of Kerbin (you'll get a 40 minute burn time with ion, meaning you're just losing dV because you aren't exploiting oberth). I would probably use a poodle at least for the first ~1200 dV to take you to the Eve intercept.  I would try to do the rest of the maneuver atomics and sparks (a couple stages so that you can ditch the empty tanks, or just asparagus the tanks during interplanetary flight).  This is the best tutorial for understanding gravity assists (you may already know this, however): http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54294-Gravity-Assists  As for how much dV you can get: I just entered Eve from an optimal transfer from 100km parking orbit at Kerbin (costed 1041 m/s dV).  My velocity at the edge of Eve's Sphere of Influence is 1515 m/s. Basically, if you can enter Eve perfectly prograde, and then swing 180 degrees around Eve, and leave it's SOI retrograde, the maximum possible gains would be ~3,000 m/s dV. The more realistic thing will be to enter nearly prograde, and then exit more or less radial/retrograde, meaning that your gains should be between ~1,500 and ~2,200 m/s dV (this would be realistic instead of idealistic). The best I'm getting with an Eve assist is dipping the Solar periapsis a little inside of Moho's orbit, to about 5,500,000 KM above the Sun. With a little work and a little luck it would be possible to go even further."

Instead of doing one 40 minute burn, do six 5 minute burns within kerbin orbit and then do a 10 minute burn (extra 5 minutes for pushing out of the SOI and the burn time burning around kerbol orbit When you exit the SOI and burn toward eve. Look at the India MOM mission or NASA LADEE for an example.)  The most common problem with this technique is the Mun and Minmus getting in the way."

KerbalAcademy,38n1nd,Bananasauru5rex,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:40:07 2015 UTC,"I have to ask about this, because I spent a few beers and some cocktail napkins trying to work out if splitting up burns close the to the periapsis made more sense than one long burn...    I was thinking since my burn became more ""effective"" the faster I got, it made sense to do one long burn.     Burning how far from the periapsis makes for a more effective burn?  Like for example, a 5 minute burn makes sense, but a ten minute doesn't?  Or is it just about long long burns, like 40 minutes"
KerbalAcademy,38n1nd,BillOfTheWebPeople,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"It really depends. The idea is basically this. Your apoapsis will expand more per unit of fuel if you burn right at periapsis compared to if you burn anywhere else in your orbit. This is what is known as the Oberth Effect. It may help if you think of it in terms of speed. If you need to achieve say 7000m/s to escape Kerbin's sphere of influence because you are going slowest at apoapsis you need to burn for longer to get 7km/s. Coming back from the moon, you could be going 3000+ m/s relative to a spot on the surface at kerbin at periapsis compared to going 100m/s relative to kerbin. So to reach the 7000m/s you only need to use 4,000 delta v to reach the desired speed.  This is the basics of the Oberth Effect as I understand it. Here is the Wikipedia for more technical stuff. This is why for small burns (less than 5 minutes or so) it seems you get more effective as you burn longer it looks like you are expanding faster. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect  Now for burn times. It takes time to complete a burn. The general rule of thumb for accurate burns is to take your burn time (say 30 seconds) and burn 15 seconds before the t-0 mark and burn for 15 seconds after the t-0 mark.  If you start to get up to 10-30 minute long burns, you are looking at 5-15 minutes before the mark This is where you lose efficiency. I to get an accurate trajectory, you need to burn off center of the prograde marker (to apply the thrust in the correct tangential vector. This is why for long burns the pointer doesn't point on the prograde marker but a little bit off. If it takes you 60 minutes to do a full orbit and you are doing a 30 minute burn. You are spending half your orbit burning and you are burning up some delta-v burning normal or antinormal as well as burning prograde. The delta-v used to burn anywhere but prograde is just being used to maintain the location of periapsis and apoapsis you have and the delta v used to burn prograde is the only being applied to changing your orbit. Note I am talking about using apoapsis/apogee raising maneuvers.  I hope I still have you. I may try and draw some things in paint to kind of help.  Edit: Tried to draw something in paint, but I am not sure it will help without a video of the edits or something. I am not equipped to handle that. In Sandbox mode you could test it out with 2 craft starting from a station, 1 craft burn constantly until it reaches just outside kerbins SOI, The next craft break up that burn to a couple smaller burns. Because you need long burn times, more than 2-3 minutes, using a really low TWR craft is needed. The difference might be small for that little test, like a couple of units of fuel but for stuff like ION engines and LV-N that are pushing massive interplanetary stations it saved a bunch of DV"
KerbalAcademy,38n1nd,wartornhero,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:56:05 2015 UTC,"Oberth effect:       In astronautics, a powered flyby, or Oberth maneuver, describes a maneuver in which a rocket falls into a gravitational well, and then accelerates when its fall reaches maximum speed.   The resulting maneuver is actually a more efficient way to gain kinetic energy than applying the same impulse outside of a gravitational well. The gain in efficiency is explained by the Oberth effect, which states that the most efficient time for a burn is at orbital periapse.  In some cases, it is even worth spending fuel on slowing the rocket into a gravity well to take advantage of the efficiencies of the Oberth effect.  The maneuver and effect are named after Hermann Oberth, the Austro-Hungarian-born German physicist and a founder of modern rocketry, who first described them in 1927.

If you wish to get in touch with them, they are /u/NotSurvivingLife on voat.co.    Let me try to elaborate.  I have a ship. It is completely stable at 1x timewarp. As in holding to the maneuver node with minimal control input, no wobbling, etc, etc.  It also accelerates really slowly.  IRL, this would not be a problem. You set it up for the burn and wait a few days. In-game, however, it is a problem. To put it simply, ""ain't no-one got time for that!"".  One way to sometime mitigate that is by physics warp. Which is essentially a combination of two things: increasing the timestep size and increasing the number of timesteps calculated per real-life second. For smaller vessels, this works, sort of. However, for large vessels this fails miserably. For two reasons.  First, for larger vessels oftentimes you don't have the processing power to calculate more timesteps per real-life second. This is a bug/limitation with Unity / KSP's physics engine.  Second, KSP's physics engine - or rather, Unity's physics engine, is inaccurate enough that, especially for larger vessels, things become unstable when you increase the timestep. This is a classic issue with rigid-body physics engines in general - and Unity's physics engine handles this particularly badly. The ""tow rope"" (again, this is a puller ship) oscillates ever-so-slightly to the side due to floating-point errors, the larger timestep means that the physics engine overcompensates, and overcompensates again, with a larger error, and so and so forth until the entire thing explodes.    What I am suggesting / asking for a mod that does is something that sidesteps the physics engine entirely.  Monitor the ship for a few seconds / minutes, double-check that at 1x warp everything is stable. Then pack the vessel - stop physics entirely. Treat the ship as a rigid-body and do simple 2-body Newtonian physics integration with acceleration.  It's the same sort of approximation as KSP using 2-body physics. It's not appropriate in all cases, sure. But there are cases where it's a whole lot better than what's happening now.    And also: these are bugs and/or limitations. Please do not say they are not. This is a pet peeve of mine. I know the reasons / justifications for them being in the game - which is why I am not saying ""fix them"", I'm suggesting an alternative workaround."
KerbalAcademy,38iwpt,jofwu,2,Thu Jun 4 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"You should edit this into your post (maybe condensed slightly). I thought you were crazy until I read this. Now it makes a lot of sense.  Nothing exists like it, but I don't imagine it would be super difficult to implement. In fact, it would be very similar to Trajectories! It uses numerical integration to predict your ship's trajectory as it passes through an atmosphere. You want to do the same thing... but instead of drag forces you have the ship's thrust. Which I'm fairly certain is going to be a significantly easier calculation!  And of course on top of that you want to be able to timewarp along that orbit.   I imagine the best way to do this would be to turn on this mod on a per-ship basis. So you get your ship oriented how you want it and the engine's running, and then you click a button to say ""hey, tell me this ship's trajectory."" It assumes the current thrust vector remains constant and figures the trajectory. It could also figure how much fuel you have in the current stage and terminate the trajectory when that runs out. And maybe it gives you a similar option to terminate after a certain period of time or something like that. Ideally a stock orbit could pick up from the end of the calculated trajectory, assuming the position/velocity you end with. Not sure how doable that is.  If you proceeded to timewarp (physics warp or otherwise) the mod would wrestle control of the ship away from the game. Ideally you could warp while the ship is active. And ideally you could see the ship move along it's trajectory on the map while warping. But if nothing else, I don't see why the mod couldn't record your initial conditions, let you flip to another vessel, remove the ship from the game on timewarp, and then add it back in when you slow back to 1x. Might have to do a quickload on you or something maybe? But surely it could work.  I don't know much about modding... Just trying to throw some concepts out there that seem reasonable to me. Honestly, the most difficult part in all of this from my point of view is the interface.  Quick edit and/or TLDR: The main problem with numerical integration to get orbits I think is ""where does it end?"" The on-rails requirement makes sense because you can define the orbit with a few parameters and say where that ship will be at any point in the future. For a constantly accelerating ship it gets out of control. But if you put some kind of limit on the calculation (time, fuel, distance, hitting a planet...) it's definitely not unreasonable. Trajectories does it. All you're asking for on top of that is the option to grab a ship, fast forward, calculate where the ship would be NOW based on initial conditions, and put it there."

KerbalAcademy,38iwpt,TheGreatFez,2,Fri Jun 5 15:56:48 2015 UTC,"KSP doesn't do ""2-body physics"". It does 2-body Orbital Mechanics. There are no physics calculations happening if you are not putting any force on the ship. Its on ""Rails"". With a velocity and position, and you do not change these, the trajectory is set in stone around an inertial frame. Thats why you can accelerate at 100 times because its not calculating substantial, just inputing the parameters and multiplying some numbers based on your time.   What you are asking for is much more difficult. In order to do what you are asking you would have to circumvent the entire engine and do a rigid body analysis with changing mass/acceleration/gravity field. A HUGE analysis that would require you to basically run a simulation, there is probably not a viable analytical solution to this problem. Let alone if you ran out of fuel half way through or changed the throttle.  You would need a analytical solution to allow you to accomplish this. Maybe there are some crazy modders out there that can do this sort of VERY high level math but trust me when I say its damn near impossible. Plus the computer you are running is probably going to have to work just as hard to solve the equations."

Constant-altitude landing calculations, if you're wondering. Including fuel, although not bothering to deal with other resources. Just using a Verlet integrator - it being actually better than RK4 for orbital problems in many cases, being a symplectic integrator.)

It's ok to launch a slightly unbalanced rocket, SAS and gimbal will take care of it. The rocket is constantly changing.

KerbalAcademy,38k90d,squidtrap,4,Thu Jun 4 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"Turbojets will get you part of the way, but you'll need a rocket engine to take over once the jets run out of air. You should be getting higher than 13k before the jets flake, so there might be something wrong with your air intake configuration? I built a simple SSTO last night, two turbo jets fed by 2 rams + 4 structural intakes got me up to 20k and then a LVT30 to kick it in to orbit. I ended up with around 130 delta-v remaining in the tank, so not much but enough.  I believe the most efficient ascent profile is:    Jets up to their functional ceiling. Level off and accelerate as much as possible Hit the rocket and pitch up to 45 deg, and then follow a normal gravity turn for the rest of the ascent.   If you're not using it already I'd recommend the mod KER which provides really useful in-flight info, such as your air intake utilisation."
KerbalAcademy,38k90d,a_lowman,2,Thu Jun 4 23:30:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! Do many people not use RAPIER engines for SSTOs?
KerbalAcademy,38k90d,MacroNova,3,Fri Jun 5 02:08:31 2015 UTC,"Rapiers are better than turbojets, but they struggle a little more at breaking the sound barrier. Some of us pitch down to help punch through it and then climb back up again. That's their only drawback."

KerbalAcademy,38jlwr,Magitek_Knight,6,Thu Jun 4 17:34:31 2015 UTC,Why do you need the reaction wheel? Doesn't the core provide enough control?
KerbalAcademy,38jlwr,CraftyCaprid,4,Thu Jun 4 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"The OKTO2 doesn't, at least according to the VAB. I haven't tested it, so maybe it's just a mislabeling of it?   Edit: Just tested it, the OKTO2 definitely doesn't have reaction wheels built in. I have absolutely no control over it without the inline reaction unit."
KerbalAcademy,38jlwr,fibonatic,2,Thu Jun 4 18:15:18 2015 UTC,"So can't you swap the probe and reaction wheel for another probe which can provide torque, such as the Probodobodyne HECS or OKTO."

KerbalAcademy,38jlwr,undercoveryankee,5,Thu Jun 4 18:52:16 2015 UTC,There's no reason you can't use two probe cores: one OKTO2 for the SAS modes and one HECS or OKTO if that's the amount of torque you need.

KerbalAcademy,38jlwr,CttCJim,3,Thu Jun 4 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"For the life of me I really am not sure why the HECS probe core works, but the Inline Reaction Wheels don't   Your initial instinct was right on the money. The reaction wheel part is too powerful for a vehicle of this size. It provides more angular acceleration than the joint strength and the stock SAS tuning can handle.  The probe cores that have torque have about a tenth of the torque that the reaction wheel does, which turns out to be just about right for your satellite."

KerbalAcademy,38iyvx,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:37:46 2015 UTC,"Struts and Kerbal Joint Reinforcement are both great ideas. You should also check out the fairings from KW Rocketry - they're regular solid parts, and you can use struts to connect the payload to the fairing walls."
KerbalAcademy,38iyvx,Doglatine,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help. When using struts, am I able to place them parallel to a structure? What I mean is am I able to place the strut on one fuel tank and have it connect to the same sized fuel tank just below? Or is it safe to say that if the strut isn't visible then the placement didn't ""work""?"
KerbalAcademy,38iyvx,Doglatine,2,Thu Jun 4 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"The strut needs to be visible (at least before you offset it), although in some cases it might be very small. The strut placement tool is very finicky. I find it sometimes helps to act a structural component like a cubic octagonal strut to give me enough clearance room to place proper struts - directly down from one tank to another often doesn't work."
KerbalAcademy,38iyvx,BillOfTheWebPeople,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"I saw a video where the author had his stuff in the fairing.  From the ship below the fairing he build arms going up over the fairing out of metal work.  Once he had these in place, he started from the pod (I believe) and tried to connect to the arms he made.  The struts would connect to the first solid thing they found which was the inside of the fairing.  He then removed all the iron work.  I took a quick look but did not see the video... hopefully the explanation helps."
KerbalAcademy,38ha34,TyrannicalPanda,8,Thu Jun 4 05:07:28 2015 UTC,"Mine has pretty much accepted this as the new norm. So I do this:  Climb quickly to 10km, flatten out to about a 25 degree ascent, full throttle that bitch up to 1.2km/s or so, hitting rockets before flameout so the extra speed helps keep jets for a while longer. If you keep on this profile, and have enough thrust, just assume a gravity turn at about 45km, and you'll be in orbit."
KerbalAcademy,38ha34,SenorPuff,5,Thu Jun 4 05:20:33 2015 UTC,"it is much harder now but I have had limited success with highter TWRs and higher angles of ascent. The thing is that since thrust drops so drastically you can no longer keep gaining altitude and creeping up on oribital velocity. There seems to be a short window (say 12,000 to 20,000 meters) where if you have enough thrust you can get ungodly amounts of acceleration. Jet thrust is now also tied to speed. If you have enough thrust to make sure you hit that window at a high speed the lower drag will mean you can get even more speed which means even more thrust. I find that it works best to ascend as shallowly as you can without burning up. This will help you maximize your time in the altitude window. You also have to make sure your apoapsis is high enough that you have time to make orbit of course. I made a two kerbal liquid fuel only space plane using this method but haven't made anything more substantial."
KerbalAcademy,38ha34,2silverseas,3,Thu Jun 4 08:06:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed about the short window, which IMO starts a little lower, at 8,000m.  Peak acceleration is about 11,000m.  In my experience, while you want to ascend shallowly, you have to maintain at least 100m/s climb rate (roughly 5 degrees at 1300m/s).  If your altitude peaks at 22,000m in level flight, you're going to burn a LOT of rocket fuel fighting drag while trying to get your apoapsis up.  Solution: More RAPIER / turbojects (so you can accelerate to 1300m/s while gravity turning), more control authority, and a steeper, quicker ascent profile."
KerbalAcademy,38ha34,rootnegative,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:07:02 2015 UTC,I guess I'll have to keep trying to hit that window. I am trying not to rely on rockets too much because I feel like a spaceplane needs to use jets. And too much rocket use is just a rocket with big wings.
KerbalAcademy,38hjcj,iki_balam,4,Thu Jun 4 06:38:34 2015 UTC,"Is there any chance there's a keyboard or joystick somehow connected to your computer without your knowledge?  Call me crazy but my first thought is that this could be caused by having a joystick plugged in that KSP is reading for pitch, with something resting on or against the axis that is assigned for pitch, or having a throttle at just over 50% assigned to pitch, would certainly be one way to cause this to happen.  The other thing I just thought of is that if your joystick is incorrectly calibrated in Windows that could also cause it.  To investigate joysticks and such, you can go through the control panel, or run (WinKey+R)    C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL c:\Windows\system32\joy.cpl   As far as non-joystick related causes go, any mods installed?"

KerbalAcademy,38djdo,Umbristopheles,3,Wed Jun 3 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"From my personal ""bouncing"" experiences and looking at ScienceAlert to warn me when my ship counts as ""landed"" and when not...

Command capsule hopelessly spinning around on the ground? Landed.  Grabbing unit discovering you can't capture moons and planets? Still landed.

Where you connect it to is where the fuel goes. Using this you can decide, to an extent, which tanks will drain first.  Use that with radial staging and you can dump dead weight more efficiently.   As for the root, the first part you put down on a new ship is the root piece. The root option allows you to change it to a different part."

KerbalAcademy,38dw8w,pacology,3,Wed Jun 3 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"You use it for asparagus staging. In short, you can connect tanks so some of them drain first so you can drop them, shedding weight and gaining efficiency."
KerbalAcademy,38dw8w,TheNosferatu,3,Wed Jun 3 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"Weight is a big enemy for every rocket ship, but inside the atmosphere the lack of thrust is an even bigger enemy.  A good way to add more thrust is to add more engines. But this adds weight and later in your trip you might not need the thrust any more.  So, let's say you have 5 engines at the bottom of your rocket, 1 main in the middle, and 4 around it. Do you fire the middle one and risk losing fuel you might need later or do you just use the other 4 to get you as far as possible before engaging it?  Or you use fuel-crossover. Send the fuel from the side-engines to the middle engine, now you can fire all the engines without risking running low on fuel for the middle engine, since it gains it's fuel from the other 4.  Activating the middle engine gives you much more thrust, allowing you to escape the atmosphere quicker.  Let's take this one step further. Crossfeed two of the side-engines to the other two, and crossfeed that to the center. What do you have now?  When launching, you stil benefit from ALL the thrust you can generate. After getting some speed and altitude (both which improve performance and efficiency of most engines) two of your fuel tanks will start to get empty and once they are, you dump them. What do you have now?  You have 3 engines, still burning happily, all 3 are full of fuel because, up till that point, it got the fuel from somewhere else.  Also, apart that you got in thinner air and picked up speed, you also dumped two engines and two fuel tanks. So you're lighter as well. Add all that up and your rocket just became a whole bunch more efficient, and all the fuel tanks are still full  Now, for some bonus bet less important information, in real life this has been considered but pumping all that fuel from one tank to the other fast and save enough is a bit more difficult then just sticking fuel lines between them. There is also that issue that, when you decouple them, the fuel lines don't rip a hole in the fuel tank that isn't decoupled.  I have no idea what a fuel-leak would do exactly to the ship but I assume it's more severe then just loss of fuel / Dv."
KerbalAcademy,38dw8w,TheNosferatu,2,Thu Jun 4 09:52:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for writing all this out. I just woke up and this is by far the most thorough and helpful thing I've read on it yet. I feel guilty doing something that can't be done in real life, but I guess it is just a game."
KerbalAcademy,38dw8w,bacon4321432,2,Thu Jun 4 11:46:31 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad I could help.  Also, it's not that it can't be done in real life yet. It's just that real life space agencies have a very different mind-set then kerbal players.  Real life space agencies will tend to keep things simple to reduce the chance of something failing. Because that would be bad.  Kerbal players tend to try to keep things... well, a bit more interesting and a bit more reckless. Because failure is actually pretty cool as well.  So you're not really being unrealistic by using asparagus staging, you just don't care about risks as much as real life agencies. Bunch of sissies, why not marry safe science if you love it so much? In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you in the butt on the way out, because you are fired! Not you, Jeb. You're doing fine.   Also, you could always try it without crossfeeding first and only resort to it when you just don't have the Dv to do whatever it is you want.  As for myself, before 1.0 I made extensive use of it. Now, I only put it in after the third-orso launch of a vehicle. I usually tweak the design of every rocket I launch at least a bit, so asparagus staging might be added. It doesn't feel like cheating because, after sending the same design into space several times, I'm sure the engineers know exactly how to prevent fuel-leaks and weak-spots and all the other things Kerbal doesn't simulate."
KerbalAcademy,38dw8w,LazerSturgeon,2,Thu Jun 4 12:18:34 2015 UTC,"Well for one you can expand your fuel capacity by taking up horizontal space instead of vertical space- the shorter your rocket the less wobbly it is.   This is also nice for when you make a Lander for a moon.    So another benefit is , say you have 6 tanks radially attached to a main fuel tank.  With fuel lines and staging you make it so two outer tanks drain first, then you can detach them.  Next two after that get drained, you can ditch them. And so on. This means you are not carrying as much weight around so your ship will go faster on the same amount of fuel."
KerbalAcademy,38dw8w,Pink_Munn,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:29:24 2015 UTC,1) To have fuel pump into a higher stage to maximize TWR:Fuel Efficiency. This is linked to asparagus staging. You can then have more engines burning fuel which can save on the necessary dv for a burn.   2) To maintain Centre of Mass. This can be very important for space planes. A drifting CoM can cause a craft to become unstable.
KerbalAcademy,38dp43,theyeticometh,6,Wed Jun 3 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"I find it highly unlikely that this isn't doable by aero braking alone. You only need to shed about 2500 m/s to capture, which is only 25 seconds of deceleration at 10gs, which Kerbals can do in their sleep. You just need to find the right altitude."

KerbalAcademy,38dp43,OnTheCanRightNow,4,Wed Jun 3 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"That's... surprising.  Okay, so then short of sending a rescue ship, I see two options:   Enter the atmosphere with a lower periapsis, and then use your ship as a lifting body to raise the periapsis above the lethal altitude once you're in the atmosphere. This will let you aero brake for longer, but with lower peak Gs. Accept that you're not going to get an aero capture. Instead, aero brake as much as you can in such a way that you end up on a solar orbit which will bring you back to Kerbin in exactly a year, and try to capture then with a lower relative velocity.   A rescue ship seems like the best option."
KerbalAcademy,38dp43,tgood4208,2,Wed Jun 3 19:29:00 2015 UTC,Another 1 is to areo break in a way to get a minmus/mun encounter. If you cross their orbit infront of them they will also slow you down.

I've found placing the COM of the tank slightly below the radial attachment, which should point the nose slightly away from the main craft, then staging just before burnout, so it actually accelerates away from your main stage. The Soyuz does something similar I believe."
KerbalAcademy,38a0xq,SenorPuff,10,Tue Jun 2 22:17:12 2015 UTC,"It also helps if you choose your stage order so that the last set of tanks you kick off is attached laterally and not vertically. Either rotate early in the launch, or spin the parts around in VAB if you always want 90° to be to the right.   I use a 6-tank asparagus configuration to launch heavy payloads, and winding up like this rather than like this has eliminated the potential of discarded stages crashing into my rocket."
KerbalAcademy,38a0xq,Rockleg,5,Wed Jun 3 01:56:44 2015 UTC,Spinning can help as well as dropping the tank under acceleration as /u/SenorPuff recommended.   Another option is to add separatrons near the tank's CoM (empty mass). I will use those on large craft where collisions are likely.

The other 99.93% 99.3% of the ship was just to move that tiny little probe there and back!  It may be possible to do an Eve return with the return stage attached to the lander, but if it's possible, you'd basically double or triple the size of the lander.  You can fly a single vessel from the launchpad to Eve's surface, back to Eve orbit without docking/refueling, but it makes no sense to drag your return stage down to the planet and back up again.

It's an entire order of magnitude of error we're talking about."
KerbalAcademy,38954f,space_is_hard,0,Tue Jun 2 21:23:32 2015 UTC,The exact ratio isn't relevant. The whole purpose of him originally mentioning the proportion was to highlight the importance of having a light probe. So we can assume having the absolute least amount of weight is preferable.
KerbalAcademy,38954f,Stamitos,4,Wed Jun 3 01:36:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the exact proportion (well, maybe not exact, but certainly much closer than an order of magnitude) determines how much weight he needs to shed from a bloated lander to get the desired results. Shedding unnecessary parts of his lander to get to 0.7% mass ratio could involve removing extra parachutes and going with a lighter engine, whereas trying to get it down to 0.07% could mean doing a complete redesign that requires not much more than a command chair and an Oscar-B tank."

You'll likely want to upgrade both of those, even if it does run on your CPU it'll limit the number of parts you can have on a ship without slowing down. The GPU is the more important part to upgrade, but both will likely need an upgrade to run the game well.   Try running the demo to check, though., it might run alright anyways. Worth a try, right?"

This was only for pre-1.0 versions of the game. If you have updated the game to 1.0 or later (1.0.2 is the latest), this is a fairly inefficient launch profile.  Nowadays, its better to tilt a little off the pad and turn gradually, hitting 22.5 degrees at roughly 5,000m and 45 degrees at roughly 10,000m (there is a more efficient way than this, but this should get you started)  As for going to Minmus without a plane change, this is the way I like to do it.   Launch into an equitorial orbit.  Set Minmus as your target Set your maneuver node at the AN OR DN Pull prograde until your apoapsis intersects Minmus Orbit. You should get some Close Approach Markers. If they are AFTER your apoapsis, you need to put the maneuver at the other Node, you picked the wrong one :D If the close approach is BEFORE, click on the maneuver node and wait an orbit. Continue to wait orbits until you get an encounter. Perform transfer same as you would going to the moon.   Obviously, my way requires more patience and occasionally a lot of waiting. Furthermore, you'll have an inclination heading into the Minmus SOI, but that can be easily nulled out with a mid course correction."

Remember, the atmosphere isn't as huge a concern as on kerbin so you should turn rather sharply while not very high up (like, 45 degrees or more by 12k). I generally launch to duna with asparagus staged orange tank/mainsails launcher. Asparagus staging is one the most efficient configurations you can use. Just don't go max throttle when launching from kerbin, you will go too fast and waste fuel.  If you don't have enough science for struts/fuel lines/orange tank/mainsail build a biome hopper for mun or minmus.

KerbalAcademy,386dry,krenshala,3,Tue Jun 2 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"A simple test to see whether KER is properly calculating the Δv for the 48-7 is to build something small with that engine on it, and test it.  A probe core, fuel tank and one engine in orbit is what I'm thinking.  Then, get the wet and dry masses, and on a simple prograde burn see what your change in velocity ends up being. This will probably be easier if you are in a circular orbit, or one where there is very little (or slow) variation in your orbital velocity (e.g., solar orbit instead of kerbin orbit).  While there is sure to be some difference between the calculated Δv and actual change in velocity, that difference should be small enough to see whether KER is having a problem with that engine."
KerbalAcademy,386dry,Rubicj,3,Tue Jun 2 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"Investigation completed. You can view the results in this album.  While all the delta-v readouts were spot on, the TWR threw me. I don't know the math to know what it should be, but it sure as hell shouldn't be that big. Both of OP's pictures also have the same problem.  OP, if you were to post some more statistics on the details of your orbit, I'll try to mimic it precisely. Eccentricity, Semi-minor/major axis, orbital period."

KerbalAcademy,386dry,hab136,6,Tue Jun 2 19:02:40 2015 UTC,"From the navball, you started the burn way too early and you're not staying on the node marker.  You should be burning 50% before the node time and 50% after - if your burn should take 30 seconds, then you should start your burn 15 seconds before the node.  KER gives you numbers for optimal piloting.. if your piloting is less than optimal, then you won't reach the numbers it gives.  It's entirely possible to spend 300 m/s and only get 70m/s of your node, if you burn at the wrong time or in the wrong direction."
KerbalAcademy,386dry,Johnny-Lingo,2,Tue Jun 2 19:03:13 2015 UTC,Definitely not the case.  I wait religiously for t=0.  Fuel is being consumed at a much higher rate than KER predicts.  Pay attention to my fuel available.  I invite anyone to duplicate these results.
KerbalAcademy,386dry,Johnny-Lingo,3,Tue Jun 2 08:58:40 2015 UTC,"I think what Hab is saying is that on the 2nd pic you still have T-1m32s before you reach the node and you've already completed your burn.  Thus, it was too early."

KerbalAcademy,3814uh,TheGreatFez,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I would approach this like a Flight Envelope. Try to hit your max speed at different altitudes and see how they differ. Also check your fuel usage. Technically speaking the most efficient point probably won't be at full throttle (well I would guess but this is a videogame after all), but I am trying to reduce the number of variables to just altitude.   I don't know if you are much into programming but kOS is a good mod for doing custom testing like this."
KerbalAcademy,3814uh,autowikibot,2,Tue Jun 2 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"Flight envelope:       In aerodynamics, the flight envelope, service envelope, or performance envelope of an aircraft refers to the capabilities of a design in terms of airspeed and load factor or altitude.   The term is somewhat loosely applied, and can also refer to other measurements such as maneuverability. When a plane is pushed, for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown ""outside the envelope"", something considered rather dangerous.  Flight envelope is one of a number of related terms that are all used in a similar fashion. It is perhaps the most common term because it is the oldest, first being used in the early days of test flying. It is closely related to more modern terms known as extra power and a doghouse plot which are different ways of describing a flight envelope. In addition, the term has been widened in scope outside the field of engineering, to refer to the strict limits in which an event will take place or more generally to the predictable behavior of a given phenomenon or situation, and hence, its ""flight envelope"" .

KerbalAcademy,3806me,capontransfix,5,Sun May 31 21:44:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't found out how to do this, but there are a couple of workarounds.  (1) For Kerbin, you can set the moon as your target, and use its AN/DN data to get a perfect equatorial orbit (its inclination relative to Kerbin is exactly zero).  (2) For other bodies, I use a little eyeballing coupled with Kerbal Engineer's Inclination readout to get to a perfect zero.  If anyone knows any better options, I'll be interested to hear them!"
KerbalAcademy,3806me,Doglatine,2,Mon Jun 1 00:15:55 2015 UTC,"Also with Kerbal Engineer, it gives an argument of periapsis which can help give an idea where the AN/DN is located. Longitude readout would be better yet if they could get orbital values instead of the current apparently ground-based values."
KerbalAcademy,3806me,reddrip,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment.  Those are the same techniques I've been using.  Also, completing contracts for equatorial orbits allows you to leave a satellite there to mark the equator visually.  I'm hoping someone knows of some other techniques, or a mod solution.  It would be sweet if SCANsat allowed you to mark the equator so it shows on your KSP map, in the same way your landing marker works in SCANsat."
KerbalAcademy,3806me,rootnegative,2,Mon Jun 1 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"just remember that equitorial orbital contracts are +/- a certain error factor. You might not be perfectly on the equator. Depending on how exact you are wanting to be, this may be important. If you aren't overly fussed by being within 0.001 of a degree, then it'll be fine :)"
KerbalAcademy,3806me,2silverseas,6,Tue Jun 2 00:06:17 2015 UTC,The technique I use is to put two satellites in polar orbit of the body in question (at 90 Degrees inclination from each other). If you know those satellites are in exactly polar orbits than an equatorial orbit will have a 90 degree inclination to both of them.  as for how to get those into polar orbit I usually just try to keep my prograde perfectly north or south. I can tell how close I am to polar orbit by watching how long it takes for your prograde to switch from one to the other. The better your orbit the quicker the change. This does take some manoeuvring but shouldn't be that hard.

KerbalAcademy,3806me,jofwu,2,Tue Jun 2 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure how practical this is, just brainstorming... With Waypoint Manager you can set a marker on any planet's equator pretty easily, at whatever altitude you like. So you could put one at your ship's altitude on the equator and then play around with longitude until you get the marker so that it's pretty close to a point on your orbit. That should give you a decent idea of where the nodes are. Of course for an elliptical orbit that would make the altitude bit more difficult."

KerbalAcademy,37r6qm,Toobusyforthis,9,Fri May 29 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"But a frisbee doesn't reduce drag by spinning. The spinning stabilizes the body so it doesn't wobble and produce more drag.   If you held a frisbee straight or had it on a spinning aparatus, I would imagine it produces close to the same drag (the spinning probably a bit more since the instabilities from the boundary layer).

KerbalAcademy,37nqlt,Rockleg,11,Fri May 29 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way - when you are in a Mun orbit, you're also already in a Kerbin orbit. It's just a Kerbin orbit that's a little wavy due to your movement around Mun. Your vertical motion above and below the Munar equator really doesn't make much difference to your motion around Kerbin, but if you wait until those wavy edges are in line with your Kerbin retrograde vector, you can burn at your Mun periapsis to most cheaply reduce your Kerbin periapsis."
KerbalAcademy,37nqlt,Nf1nk,0,Fri May 29 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"When you think of it like that, the answer might not even be a prograde burn.  You may want to burn with a vector that is retrograde to the Mun's orbit."

KerbalAcademy,37lbp9,2A_is_the_best_A,2,Thu May 28 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"As far as I know there is not. They really need to add a data storage part, or at least allow you to use 2 labs to be able to process that 600 data chunk. I think with even 2 labs this is currently not possible."

The situation I described above is hypothetical, I'm no where near Eeloo, but I am in Gilly orbit with a MPL, a (separate) spacecraft capable of returning home and a ton of data that I would like to load up and take the science back to Kerbin with me.    I think I have three options:   Load the MPL up with 500 data and take the rest of the reports back to Kerbin with Jeb in the transfer vehicle. Lose lots of data. Leave the reports in the lab and return to Kerbin with the few I was able to use. Keep Jeb in Gilly orbit for years while I consume the data.   Anything I'm not thinking of?"
KerbalAcademy,37lbp9,asaz989,3,Thu May 28 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"Well, for me, on my latest career game (which I maxed out science wise long, long ago) in 1.0.2, I've never returned an MPL, there's almost no point if you can afford to keep hiring scientists.  Once (out of about 5-6 missions that included the MPL) I had a station in Kerbin orbit where I send up a mission to fetch all the crew except 1 scientist.   But lately, these things are fire and forget, including the crew. The reason why is that it takes YEARS to process 500 data from one of these things (producing thousands of science in the process).   Basically, send one off, land it if possible (getting a mission for that purpose first). Then harvest science indefinitely. When new contracts come up for ""return science data from XXX"" then just reuse the experiments on the same lander.  Without meaningful life support issues, there's not really any reason to return a Kerbal scientist.  What sucks about this is that you don't end up levelling any scientists. I'm still not sure how to pull that off, right now. I think my next MPL mission is going to go up with like 10 additional scientists in a crew module just to see if I can get the processing rate to something meaningful. Right now, you can process like just a few good experiments worth of data in a YEAR."
KerbalAcademy,37lbp9,DZShizzam,2,Thu May 28 18:22:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I have no plans to return the MPL with the lvl 1 scientist I left there.

KerbalAcademy,37k6sm,KeytarVillain,15,Thu May 28 05:50:48 2015 UTC,"Be aware that a huge portion of duna's terrain is very high above 0m; you need to be worried about hitting terrain by around 15km or higher in some places. You want a lot of parachutes, set them to open early, and consider doing the final touchdown under power."
KerbalAcademy,37k6sm,Traches,3,Thu May 28 06:32:51 2015 UTC,"And the atmosphere doesn't even start to bite until about 12km.  I find Duna very difficult to land on with chutes alone, so I always budget a few hundred delta V for a rocket assisted landing.   The apollo style is a great approach, you'll likely have some issues with being unaerodynamic on launch taking extra delta V, but Duna really takes very little to get off of!   I can't imagine you needing a great shield, I never did with FAR and DRE"
KerbalAcademy,37k6sm,number2301,11,Thu May 28 17:19:17 2015 UTC,"Entry - do I even need a heat shield?    That depends on your entry vector. If you don't dive in too far, you could do it without one.  Duna atmo is very thin though, so be careful you don't go too deep either, you won't slow down in time.   And is flipping over as much of a problem as it is with Kerbin?   This has been fixed since the 1.0.2 hot fix.   Is my lander going to flip over on launch if it's top heavy, like half my rockets do on Kerbin?   Yes. Make sure your centre of mass doesn't move too high up the craft. However, atmo is very thin, so it might not be too bad.   The ∆v map says 1300 from surface to orbit - how much extra do I need to account for drag?   If you pack that, you should be fine. Atmo is thin and gravity is low. Its not accurate anymore, but it is overestimated, so you should be ok.   Will making my lander more aerodynamic make enough of a difference on launch (both the possible flipping over and the effect on dV) that it's worth caring about?   Definitely. You want to make the lander look like a bigger version of a crew capsule. Bulbous at the bottom and pointy at the top.  I think you're overly concerned about the flipping effects though. I don't think you'll have as much of a problem with flipping things in Duna atmo.   As with anything, be prepared to quicksave and reload so that you can practice and learn."
KerbalAcademy,37k6sm,rootnegative,5,Thu May 28 06:05:35 2015 UTC,"Overall good advice, but I have to correct you on CoM and aerodynamic stability: A stable rocket will have its CoM high and its aerodynamic center low. Think of a badminton birdie."

Only if your lander depends on the heat shield to keep its center of mass low. I still sometimes have issues with it when I try to land things that are more than just a capsule + heat shield.  But thanks for the help! I might try to make multiple aerobraking passes, just to be safe. And come to think of it, the part that returns to orbit will probably be pretty similar to a ""Toyota Corolla"" lander (assuming that will have enough ∆v and thrust - I haven't built and checked with KER yet), so aerodynamics and top-heaviness probably won't be too much of an issue."

Can you elaborate more? Give some pictures of what you struggle to keep upright?  I think you'll need something a bit different to a direct ascent lander, you won't get the dV required out of it. Basically break it into descent stage & ascent stage. Leave the descent stage on the planet, bring the absolute minmum back to orbit. Eg. Command Pod, fuel, engines, maybe RCS and a docking port, that's it."

So picture a small capsule, service bay, and Science Jr - that would often flip over. Or when I've done rescue missions with a capsule and an inline cockpit.  I seem to recall I also had trouble with my first unmanned Duna probe (which had basically all the science gear, plus batteries, solar panels, antenna, etc) flipping on entry, although I don't remember for sure.   I think you'll need something a bit different to a direct ascent lander, you won't get the dV required out of it. Basically break it into descent stage & ascent stage.

KerbalAcademy,37k6sm,CambleC,6,Thu May 28 06:37:01 2015 UTC,"Even if you slow down using parachutes, I would still recommend slowing down in the last ~100m or so under power. It takes a ton of parachutes to slow down to a reasonable landing speed in Duna's thin atmosphere, but it only takes a small amount of delta v to do a semi-powered landing."
KerbalAcademy,37k6sm,Doglatine,4,Thu May 28 08:13:47 2015 UTC,"I tend to use an Apollo style mission too and it works well for me.   Set your parachutes to deploy at a few thousand meters, instead off 500, to account for the mountainous terrain and shallow atmosphere. You may find you still need to fire your engines on the final descent. Due to the thin atmosphere you probably won't need a heatshield, but it does depend. Flipping is likely to only be an issue on entering Duna's atmosphere, so make sure the lander is bottom-heavy. I haven't checked exactly, but 1500m/s ∆v should be more than enough to leave Duna. Duna's atmosphere is about 1/5th the density of Kerbin's, so aerodynamics aren't such an issue on take-off.   I should also point out that it was previously possible to aerobrake in Duna's atmosphere at an altitude of 13km. If you do this post-1.0 you will crash. Aim for ~19km but it does depend on velocity (the window is quite narrow, somewhere between 18km and 20km. It's very easy to fall into the atmosphere."

Edit: I might suggest making the X axis logarithmic as well, though, since the majority of that axis only applies to Eve (or Jool) right now. 1 atm should be closer to the midpoint or even further to the right."

It's going to take a lot of time though. :) You are aware that you can do physics warp in space by pressing alt+. right? That will probably help your sanity while you burn.  The trick is to do LOTS of burns. Pick a point for the periapse and burn every time you come around, each time kicking your apoapsis up just a bit more.  I would try to avoid burning for more than 2 or 3 minutes each time. Do this until your apoapsis is BARELY inside Eve's SOI. Any more than that and you'll be out in solar orbit. Then, on your final pass, give it all you've got. You'll probably have to burn some more after that last pass (while you are still orbiting Eve or after you're in solar orbit) to get the solar apoapsis out to Kerbin. But that's the way to do it.  The hard part will be figuring out where the periapsis should be. It will take a very long time to reach that ""last pass orbit"". And you need the periapsis to be in the right place so that you eject from Eve in the right direction. I'd use this guy (with your current orbit, and transfer type on optimal) to find when the good windows are. Pick one that's a good ways off... A year? To be very safe? Assuming there are no time restraints, why not?   You'll have to do the math to figure (a) where will Eve be when the transfer window comes? and (b) where should you put your periapsis NOW (relative to Eve and the Sun) so that it's in the right place THEN?  When you've figured that out, set up your periapsis in the right place and start working the apoapsis to the edge of the SOI. When you're there, just got to wait until the transfer window comes and cross your fingers. :)  Be glad to help more if you need it, though I'd need to know details on your orbit, time in the game, etc."
KerbalAcademy,37ia6c,jofwu,1 point,Wed May 27 21:40:30 2015 UTC,"This is a technique used by real life missions. The atmosphere-dissipation-measuring Mars probes that the U.S. and India launched used this method: a sequence of burns at periapsis to push their apoapsis further and further out (taking advantage of the Oberth Effect) was very fuel-efficient and let them leverage low thrust engines to gradually push the craft into transfer trajectories. The ""ideal"" transfer involves an instantaneous imparting of momentum (forgive my terminology if it's inaccurate, I'm an amateur rocketeer), but that simply assumes you have engines capable of that much thrust.  An ion engine with enough fuel could, theoretically, push a vehicle of any size into a transfer orbit to Eeloo, if you did hundreds or thousands of micro-burns at periapsis until apoapsis reached the appropriate distance."
KerbalAcademy,37ia6c,therealfakemoot,2,Thu May 28 02:47:28 2015 UTC,"What Jofwu says is certainly the efficient way of doing it. However, 6k delta-v should be enough to go out directly with a single very long burn and not care about the Oberth effect.  If your thrust is infinitesimally small, then the required delta-v between two circular orbits, when doing one continuous burn, is just the difference of their orbital velocities. Orbital velocity at low Eve orbit is 3200 m/s, orbital velocity infinitely far (that is escaping) is 0, so you need 3200 m/s delta-v to escape Eve with a very slow continuous burn. Then do the same for the orbital velocities of Kerbin and Eve around the Sun. These are 9300 m/s and 11000m/s. The difference is then about 1700 m/s. So together these make 4900 m/s,  thus your 6000 m/s of delta-v should be plenty.  And KSP's ion engines are actually quite powerful and very far from infinitesimally small. So you'll actually use much less than that. Still, as an upper limit it tells you that you should definitely be ok with the delta-v you have."
KerbalAcademy,37ia6c,Olog,1 point,Thu May 28 08:00:37 2015 UTC,"The problem is that with such a small thrust I think you're bound to waste some delta-v, no? What direction would you make this brute force Eve escape burn in?"
KerbalAcademy,37ia6c,jofwu,1 point,Thu May 28 10:38:25 2015 UTC,"Yes it's not optimal as far as delta-v goes but 6k delta-v is still going to be enough. You don't always need to optimise by delta-v if you got enough to do the manoeuvre in some other way. Of course this doesn't really matter in KSP but in real life there'd be time constraints too and only burning at periapsis might just take too long.  You'd be burning prograde to escape Eve. In the theoretical case of a minimal thrust you'd be spiralling out of Eve and completing several progressively larger orbits before escaping, and you'd burn prograde the whole time. And then in solar orbit you'll continue to burn prograde around the Sun until you get to Kerbin. If we had three-body physics then it would get complicated at the boundary of the SOIs but we don't need to worry about that.  But as I said, in KSP the thrust of ion engines is actually pretty big so the burn will only take maybe two to three hours in total. Aiming the burn exactly so that you escape in a nice long single burn is going to be complicated. But since we're going to have the delta-v, we can just expand to a bigger orbit, circularise and then aim properly from there in the normal way as the higher orbit gives us more time to do the burn."
KerbalAcademy,37hxex,NotSurvivingLife,2,Wed May 27 19:36:31 2015 UTC,Is that peak lift due to angle of attack?  Or best climb attitude?  Every aircraft i have made is so powerful that angle of attack goe to basically zero after every attitude adjustment.
KerbalAcademy,37hxex,notepad20,2,Thu May 28 00:20:07 2015 UTC,"Something I've noticed from the aero force display that bothers me is that lift is generated perpendicular to the wing surface, instead of perpendicular to the free stream.

KerbalAcademy,37g5uf,jofwu,2,Fri May 29 04:05:46 2015 UTC,"Ag0r's point was that the craft must be actively connected to the network to perform an experiment. You can't, for example, set the probe to run an experiment on the dark side of a planet. The flight computer let's you schedule burns, attitude changes, etc. for some future point in time when the probe isn't directly under your control. There's no way to do this with experiments (or anything involving action groups or right click buttons as far as I know). Edit: I take that back. I think you can do this if you set the desired manual signal delay in the flight computer before clicking the button or typing the action group.  I don't think this is what you are trying to do, but I can see how he would interpret your question that way.  I haven't played with RT in a while, but if I'm not mistaken you SHOULD be able to run experiments the normal way (right click > run experiment) no matter how far away you are from Kerbin. (as long as you have direct control per Ag0r's point) There IS a signal delay. So when you push the button to run the experiment it won't run immediately. Clicking the button sends the message ""run this experiment"" and then you have to wait while the signal is being sent. If the signal delay is 10 seconds, then your thermometer experiment won't run until ten seconds after you push the button.  There's nothing magical about LKO. The signal delay for direct commands like this happens at all times with RT installed... You just probably wouldn't notice it when you are close to Kerbin because the delay is so brief.  If the probe is actively connected to the network (flight computer button green) and it has power, but experiments do NOT run (after the signal delay) then perhaps you've got a bug."
KerbalAcademy,37g5uf,Ag0r,2,Wed May 27 14:26:56 2015 UTC,There's no button to run them at all. All parts save engines have their mouse controls vanish about half a million meters out (not sure about action groups). I do have the green flight computer.  This is completely abnormal then?

When assuming that each transfer to apoapsis takes the same amount of time, then spacing the transfers burn equally around Kerbin's surface should also result in equally spaced satellites in Kerbisynchronous Equatorial Orbits."
KerbalAcademy,37f1bg,grumpyoldham,1 point,Wed May 27 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"What you propose should work. The second satellite will probably be the hardest, to make sure all maneuvering happens where either it or the first satellite has line of sight to KSC.  Another solution would be to figure out the phase angle needed at launch to launch directly to rendezvous using trial and error in KCT's simulation mode and either Kerbal Engineer or Mechjeb's displays. Then add or subtract 90 degrees as required, and launch at the correct moment directly into the orbital position you want. This won't work if the required orbit is synchronous of course..."

KerbalAcademy,37f1bg,jofwu,1 point,Wed May 27 13:36:31 2015 UTC,"I just did this one myself, same mods. I opted to launch all 4 satellites separately like you are.  Do you have KER installed? Make a note of the first satellite's orbital period.   There's no reason to rendezvous first. Just launch the 2nd satellite with a similar apoapsis and periapsis. Then set the 1st satellite as your target and check out the phase angle that KER gives you. You want them to all be 90 degrees apart, so you want a phase angle of something like 90 or 270. Adjust your apoapsis or periapsis so that satellite 2's orbital period is slightly longer or shorter than satellite 1's orbital period. Watch the phase angle close in, and then adjust your orbit one more time to match satellite 1's orbital period. Repeat for 3 and 4.  Matching the orbital period is the real key. Using KER to check those orbital periods and phase angles is my advice.  I made sure to always have my next rocket under construction in slot 1 for the VAB, so that I could be super patient waiting for the right phase angle without feeling like I was wasting time."
KerbalAcademy,37f1bg,wooq,1 point,Wed May 27 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, I am using KER. My only issue with that approach was that TAC life support is also being used, so I can't just leave him up there forever waiting for things to line up. Rendevous' are pretty straightforward and adjusting the resonance can put me at the correct phase angle in just one orbit. So that 's why I was thinking that way."

KerbalAcademy,37bra7,DemonicSquid,5,Tue May 26 14:42:38 2015 UTC,You can get a lot of science by mounting equipments on a small craft with the first aircraft landing gears and just move around the  biomes on the launch area.

KerbalAcademy,37bra7,get_MEAN_yall,2,Wed May 27 14:00:22 2015 UTC,"What should I do to arrange the timing?  I know people use the map screen to set maneuvers , but they're confusing for me for some reason. All the colors and no context, I guess."
KerbalAcademy,37bra7,Majromax,2,Wed May 27 15:10:28 2015 UTC,"The classical advice is that you should ""burn when the Mün rises,"" and that's close enough to work for maneuver nodes.  Set a maneuver node for the point on your orbit where prograde is in approximately the direction of the Mün, and increase the prograde portion until the resulting orbit crosses the Münar orbit.  You should see your predicted orbit show an encounter with the Münar sphere of influence, then maybe a second Kerbin orbit of what will happen after you exit.  (That orbit won't show up if your current path collides with the Mün.)  (Basic guide to colours: your craft's orbit is in light blue.  Your predicted orbit after you do what you say you will at the maneuver node is the brownish line.)  If you double-click on the Mün at this point, you can see where what your predicted path will look like from the Mün's point of view.  Small burns near Kerbin will change this hyperbolic path a great deal.  If you just want a flyby, you're done.  If you want to achieve orbit, you'll want to burn retrograde at the periapsis where your path is closest to the Mün.  This will be slightly more efficient if your periapsis is close to the Mün rather than farther away.  It takes about 850 m/s of Δv to go from a low Kerbin orbit to a Münar flybay.  It takes about 350 m/s to achieve orbit around the Mün.  (Launching from KSC to orbit takes about 4,000 m/s of Δv, depending on how efficient your craft is.  Once in orbit, you can get a light probe (probe core, batteries, thermometer, fuel tank, engine) to the Mün very easily on a small tank and a terrier, with plenty of room to spare.)  To get back (if you have a crewed vehicle or want to recover experiments), you'll need another 350 m/s from Münar orbit to a Kerbin encounter.  To achieve this from Münar orbit, burn prograde along your orbit in such a way that you exit the Mün opposite the direction it orbits Kerbin.  You want to cancel out the Mün's orbital velocity, essentially.  All you need to do is drop your Kerbin periapsis to 40-50km and you'll aerobrake into a landing.  You emphatically do not need to establish a circular orbit of Kerbin before landing, and doing so via engines is a tremendous waste of fuel.  (Getting back from a flyby can be easy or hard depending on how the trajectories work out, and a bit finicky for beginners.  If you approach the Mün from ""behind"" it, its gravity will kick you forwards and make returning very difficult; if you approach the Mün from ""ahead"" of it you can end up on a ""free return"" trajectory to collide with Kerbin at no additional fuel cost.  This was used in real life for the Apollo missions.  If you want to try a free return, burn towards the Mün such that your apoapsis is just beyond its orbit, so that you sort of hover there for a while while it catches up to your craft.)  The procedure for Minmus is nearly the same, but the orbit of Minmus is inclined (offset to Kerbin's equator) so making the encounter is a bit more difficult.  It takes slightly more Δv to have a Minmus encounter, but once you're there achieving orbit (and landing and taking off) is much easier because of the planetoid's smaller gravity."
KerbalAcademy,37bra7,get_MEAN_yall,1 point,Wed May 27 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"there are six directions, forward/backward, inner/outer, up/down (there are more technical names). For the moons, you generally only want to worry about propograde (forward).   You should burn at the lowest point in your orbit, and only when you have a transfer window to the moon. mechjeb calculates this for me nowadays, but my first flyby was unassisted: Just wait until the moon is rising over the horizon of kerbin, and burn propograde. A good combination of burning at the lowest point and having the moon in the correct position will give you the best efficiency.   Shoot for the moon first, its SoI is significantly larger and I find it much easier to get captured by (albeit harder to land on).  Once you get an encounter just slow down as much as possible at the lowest point."
KerbalAcademy,37bra7,get_MEAN_yall,1 point,Wed May 27 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"The maneuver node just gives you a time to fire the engines, and control over the direction. The yellow markers are forward and backward with respect to your velocity. The blue markers are essentially left and right, and the purple ones are up and down. To plan on a maneuver (which is just some period of time where you fire your engines), click on your path and drag it some direction.  To get to the mun, just drag your maneuver prograde (the yellow one with lines going direct up, and directly left/right) when you will be seeing the moon coming over the horizon. watch your craft, and when the moon is in full view, fire prograde from the map screen. This is hard to time. At first, I would only set maneuver nodes VERY close to my ship because I could see then where the other body would be. You'll get better at it.  Then fire prograde, and try to get an encouter. It takes practice. When you get an encounter, ZOOM on the moon, and you can see your trajectory. Getting it closer to the moon will make your burn to orbit (RETROGRADE = against your velocity = slowing down) more efficient. do this by pull maneuver nodes buttons. Again, grapsing the 3-dimensional nature of this game takes practice."

In general, inclination changes can take a very large amount of delta v to perform, and most mission planners try to avoid them whenever possible to conserve fuel. This is typically achieved by launching a spacecraft directly into the desired inclination, or as close to it as possible so as to minimize any inclination change required over the duration of the spacecraft life. Planetary flybys are the most efficient way to achieve large inclination changes, but they are only effective for interplanetary missions.

KerbalAcademy,3768lw,Aniahlator,3,Mon May 25 06:36:08 2015 UTC,"The easiest way I have found to calculate the Delta V is the following.  dV = Sqrt(2 * V2 * (1 - Cos(i) ) )  Where:  dV: Delta V. The amount of meters per second you need to perform the maneuver.  Sqrt: Square root. You should know this one.  V: Velocity. This is your orbital velocity at the time of the maneuver. More on how to find this below, if you don't know.  Cos: Cosine. You should know this one too.  i: The degrees of the desired inclination change. Going from an equatorial orbit to a polar orbit would be a change of 90 degrees.  To find the orbital velocity of your craft at any given point, use the following.  V = Sqrt(G * M * ((2/R)-(1/Ax)))  Where:  V: Orbital Velocity. Sqrt: Square Root. See above.  G: Gravitational Constant. You can use 6.67 * 10-11 for this value.  M: Mass of the parent body. This is all available online. The mass of Kerbin is 4.7×1016 Kg.  R: Radius of the orbit at the point you are trying to measure velocity for. Don't forget to add the radius of the parent body to your altitude, otherwise you'll throw everything else off. The radius of Kerbin is 600 Km.  Ax: Semi-Major Axis. This is the average radius of your orbit. Add your apoapsis and periapsis together, and divide by two for this value. Don't forget to add the radius of the parent body here as well.  When you perform your burn, set your pilot/probe core to burn normal, or the triangle node until you reach the desired inclination.  Keep in mind, this is for an inclination change without an altitude change. If you want to change altitudes in the same maneuver (more efficient but more complicated) that's a bigger, nastier equation.  I hope this helped, somewhat. I know it's a lot to absorb at once. Took me a long while to get everything in order.  Edit: Formatting."
KerbalAcademy,3768lw,Aniahlator,2,Mon May 25 08:25:11 2015 UTC,Yea I get that all thanks! I just don't get how the wikipedia version is so complicated for essentially the same thing. Is there bits cut out of this shorter one or something?
KerbalAcademy,3768lw,fibonatic,1 point,Mon May 25 09:01:54 2015 UTC,"Well, the Wikipedia one is probably written by professional rocketry/orbital mechanics engineers, for professional rocketry/orbital mechanics engineers. There's a lot of term simplification, using smaller words and such, but this is really everything you need to know for KSP. If you were to calculate an orbital inclination change in LEO, you would probably need all of the information on the wiki."
KerbalAcademy,3768lw,Xilthis,3,Mon May 25 09:40:34 2015 UTC,"The main difference is that the Wikipedia page expresses the orbital velocity at a given point in orbital elements (however after a quick look I don't see why the argument of periapsis is needed, unless they define the inclination change in some other way.)."
KerbalAcademy,3768lw,autowikibot,1 point,Mon May 25 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"In the following, I am going to assume circular orbits.  You have essentially two options:  a)  Perform a direct inclination change. This means you just thrust the vector difference between your old velocity and your new velocity at either AN or DN.  This should cost you 2 * sin (theta / 2) * |v|, where theta is the inclination change angle, and |v| the magnitude of your velocity vector at the given position (vis viva equation!).  b) If your inclination change is high, it is always more efficient to perform a bielliptic transfer up as high as possible and back (In KSP, this is as close to the SOI change as you are comfortable with).  The higher your transfer, the cheaper the dV cost, but the worse the time needed. In the limit, you take infinite time to escape and back, but once escaped, inclination change is free. dV cost then is: 2 * | |v_escape| - |v| |.  It gets interesting to compare which variant is more efficient. The ratio of direct to bielliptic cost is sin(theta/2)/(sqrt(2) - 1). As you can see, the orbit specifics cancel out and only the inclination change remains relevant.  Thus it is always more efficient to change using bielliptic transfer once the inclination change angle is greater than 2 * asin(sqrt(2) - 1), which is about 0.85 radian or 48.9 degrees.  To calculate the precise dV required, plug this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation into the formulas above.  (If there are any errors in my results above, please feel free to correct me!)"
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,last-username,3,Sun May 24 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"Dont set them to follow prograde, let them fall naturally with some touch ups from yourself.  I throttle down to maintain about 300m/s at about 2-5k alt, this usually dosnt need touching again till 35k, when i throttle up to full.  I tilt at lift off, and tap the sas to hit (approx) 60d@7k, 45d@10k, 20d@20k, level at 35k.  I leave the sas off, just tapping the right occasionally for the first half, then left occasionally for the second half.  I budget 2800-3000m/s delta-v in the first stage, and usually end up with a small circulation burn required, less than 250m/s usually."
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,notepad20,1 point,Mon May 25 02:36:23 2015 UTC,I see. Letting them fall naturally also gets rid of the vibrating fins due to the SAS trying to constantly adjust them. Thanks for the help!
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,krenshala,2,Mon May 25 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"I've learned that in any situation if the SAS starts a feedback loop you want to disable it at least long enough for the rocket to stabilize.  The 'F' key (by default) toggles the SAS only as long as held (unlike 'T'), which means it will turn it on if currently off and off if currently on.  Very useful when you want SAS but need to null out an increasingly large wiggle-of-doom."
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,eric_md,7,Tue May 26 06:55:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your TWR is too high actually. I usually aim for between 1.2 and 1.5, knowing that it can quickly rise as fuel is burnt. They key here is you're getting atmospheric effects, which shouldn't really happen. That means you are greatly exceeding terminal velocity and therefore are wasting thrust because of drag.   TL;DR: throttle back (or set the throttle limiter on solid rockets prior to launch)"
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,fibonatic,7,Sun May 24 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"A low TWR usually will mean that your ascent trajectory flattens out to early, namely gravity is able to bend your trajectory, since once you start your turn less and less of your thrust is counteracting gravity."
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,fibonatic,1 point,Sun May 24 16:28:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the fast reply! So I quickly built a test rocket and tried to get it to orbit. I constantly adjusted the throttle to keep the TWR at around 1.4 (±0.1). I still ran into almost the same problem though. Flat trajectory while being fast and not high up enough. Shortly after this pic the rocket started to descend.
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,WazWaz,9,Sun May 24 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"Try a higher TWR since that will keep your trajectory vertical for longer, and thus you will not flatten out at too low altitudes."
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,wooq,8,Sun May 24 16:31:34 2015 UTC,"Your solution worked perfectly! I went full throttle until I reached 24'000 meters, then I throttled down to the point where my velocity was only increasing slowly. I waited until my rocket was angled at about 5°, then went full throttle again to get my desired apoaps.   Circularizing then only took me about 70m/s of ∆v. All in all I launched 3 rockets this way, each one taking about 3600m/s  of ∆v to get to orbit.  Thanks again and fly safe :) ."
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,zilfondel,3,Sun May 24 20:16:03 2015 UTC,Use KER and check your terminal velocity - it's unlikely you'd be reaching it at 24km.
KerbalAcademy,373kwu,Desembler,1 point,Sun May 24 23:04:25 2015 UTC,"Alternately, you can not tilt over as much, just give it a little nudge to the east right after liftoff and let gravity do the rest."

Your comment actually suggests otherwise."
KerbalAcademy,370e8p,Vultatio,-8,Sun May 24 04:07:47 2015 UTC,familiar with aerodynamics and rocketry does not mean the game is 'easier'.    Think about what the subject of this game is and evaluate your statement.

You said, if you know aerodynamics and rocketry it's easier.  I said, most people don't know aerodynamics and rocketry, so for the general population, it's harder.

KerbalAcademy,370e8p,Vultatio,-4,Sun May 24 13:10:39 2015 UTC,"Because if the game behaves realistically, you can read, and question, and learn from the vast accumulation of human knowledge, and apply what you learn to the game.

KerbalAcademy,370e8p,RoboRay,2,Mon May 25 00:36:01 2015 UTC,You keep ignoring my entire point. Not sure why. Being more realistic has nothing to do with whether it is harder or easier.  There's nothing wrong with learning about aerodynamics. But it's still harder to play for the vast majority of the general population. I feel like we're arguing two entirely different things.
KerbalAcademy,370e8p,Vultatio,-4,Mon May 25 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"The point is that ""difficulty"" varies by individual, based on their own experience and knowledge.  It's not some fixed quantity, equal for all players.  I said:   It's actually easier than before, if you are familiar with aerodynamics and rocketry and are expecting the game to behave realistically.   And that is absolutely true.  It also makes learning to play it much easier for those who do not start with relevant experience and/or knowledge, because they aren't limited to merely the game resources for knowledge... they have the whole world's resources at their fingertips Google.

The science part is really boring at the beginning. It gets slightly better towards the end of the tree.
KerbalAcademy,370e8p,gfranzoi,7,Sat May 23 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"my rockets keep tumbling midflight.   At mid-flight, your center of mass has often moved because fuel is draining from tanks.  KSP drains tanks in a certain order, I believe furthest from engine first?  Which moves COM back.  At the same time, aerodynamic forces are at their maximum - at low altitudes you haven't built up as much speed, and at higher altitudes the atmosphere has thinned significantly.  But in the middle you can get some very high pressures.  The real-life shuttle actually throttled back in mid-flight to reduce pressure.  So check your rocket's center of mass vs. it's center of pressure/center of lift with different fuel loads, and play with speeds until you find ones that work better."

KerbalAcademy,370gxs,last-username,7,Sat May 23 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"Think of a dart: very heavy tip, with some fins at the rear. This is basically what a rocket is. Your rocket needs to have a high/forward center of mass(CoM) and the center of drag/pressure/lift(CoL) needs to be at the rear/bottom. This is why fins are at the bottom of the rocket. But fins at the bottom won't fix everything. The center of mass is quite possibly the biggest thing.   If you post a picture of your rocket with CoM/CoL turned on I can help you redesign.   Edit: too short! You need a longer, skinnier rocket. You've probably got way more Delta-V than you need, also. The guidelines I gave you about CoM/CoL need to hold true for every stage that's intended to be in atmosphere."

If you have 4 labs with one scientist each, each one of those labs will operate as though staffed by four scientists.  It's a bit OP and probably not what they intended.  I assume they'll adjust it so that only crew in a lab count towards its productivity."
KerbalAcademy,36wf3a,TMarkos,2,Fri May 22 19:16:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the information! I'm about to send up that second lab module and see for myself now. I'm interested in seeing how it handles adding new data to the labs when I have one that's nearly full and the new one totally empty.
KerbalAcademy,36wf3a,TMarkos,2,Fri May 22 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"So it turns out that this isn't the way it's working, at least for me.  I wound up launching an entire new station since I'd unlocked some better tech (and needed to cut my part count a bit), then I docked a vessel that had just returned from a mission to Minmus. I put a level 2 scientist in each of the labs.  After transferring all the results to one of the labs and processing them into data until the lab was full I then moved the experiments to the second lab to try to process them. When I tried to process them in the second lab I was told I could not do that because data storage was already full, even though the second lab reports 0/500 data.  The second lab will let me start researching despite the absence of data, but it reports 0 science/day output. I need to do further testing to determine if it's actually drawing from the other lab's data and producing science accordingly, but it's definitely still drawing power when active.  Edit: Did a little more testing. Telling the other lab to start researching doesn't do anything but draw power. The lab that is active is producing science at 5 times the rate its information panel says it is though."

I had sent a lab to minmus to process science, then went ""screw that, I have enough fuel, let's connect to my kerbin station and double my labs."" Somehow it worked the first time I filled both with data (I don't think I was docked yet), but ever since then it's will only let me fill one.  Being that my station has too many parts and is wonky, I have no desire to test if I can disconnect the lab, manually transfer data, then reconnect and process into sweet science."
KerbalAcademy,36wf3a,arechsteiner,1 point,Tue May 26 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"If you have trouble filling a secondary lab with data, a workaround is to remove all scientists from the primary lab so it becomes inoperable. Then, all data will go to the remaining operable lab.  Now you move back your scientists to the primary lab.  The result is having data in both labs without having to undock/redock.  Addendum: It looks as if the whole multi-lab thing is buggy beyond data-transferring. Maybe it's best to have multiple single-lab stations in the same/similar location instead of docking them into a behemoth."

It might be good in the beginning if you are still learning to land back and KSC but personally I find it to be a pointless strategy as craft returning away from KSC are things like a command pod with parachute, and the craft that I return back to KSC are the expensive spaceplanes that can be controlled to land right back on the runway."

KerbalAcademy,36xire,JustALittleGravitas,2,Sat May 23 02:59:24 2015 UTC,You'd need some hackery with part clipping to do it. I have a few ideas on how it could be done. But Eric_S's idea is probably the easiest. And generally speaking the elegant solution is the one least likely to screw up.

He has module designs that make it easy to reproduce the port height and have room for a rover to get underneath for transportation.  His trick for adjusting modules into alignment is to just retract the legs near a port that needs to droop. Once you have enough modules with enough legs docked together, you can retract a fair few before the whole world tips over.  If you're on trickier terrain and need self-leveling landing gear, Infernal Robotics is going to be the way to go. If you feel like the shape of the piston end isn't right for your application, consider mounting a conventional landing gear on an IR actuator."

KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Rockleg,11,Fri May 22 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"Minmus is the more efficient option. It takes less delta-v to get to Minmus from Kerbin, it takes less delta-v to ferry fuel from the surface to the orbit, it takes less delta-v to land, it's generally easier to navigate around due to it's much smaller size. It's also easier to launch to interplanetary trajectory too due to Minmus' smaller gravity. Minmus' faster rotation speed may also be useful for solar power.  You should definitely take advantage of the Oberth effect and dip back down to low Kerbin orbital altitudes before doing your interplanetary burn. This will be massively more efficient than escaping directly from Minmus. Of course, don't circularise your orbit at Kerbin. Just dip down and then do the interplanetary burn at the periapsis. You will naturally have to time your exit from Minmus so that your periapsis ends up where you need to do the interplanetary burn. This certainly makes launch window timing more complicated but will make a big difference in delta-v efficiency."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Olog,3,Fri May 22 08:32:27 2015 UTC,it takes less delta-V to get to Minmus? Am I doing things wrong? Surely it's further than the Mun so you need more fuel?
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,AdrianBlake,6,Fri May 22 11:57:33 2015 UTC,"Getting to orbit around Minmus is indeed less delta-v than getting to orbit around Mun. Just getting there in the sense of a fly-by is more delta-v for Minmus than for Mun, but only slightly so as they're both pretty close to escaping Kerbin. The circularisation for Minmus orbit however is considerably less delta-v than circularisation around Mun due to Minmus' much smaller gravity."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Olog,4,Fri May 22 12:30:03 2015 UTC,It takes 5670 dv to get into low Mun orbit.  It takes 5590 dv to get into low Minmus orbit.  http://i.imgur.com/NKZhU57.png

KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,AdrianBlake,8,Fri May 22 14:42:14 2015 UTC,"You need more to get there, but less to stay there."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,JustALittleGravitas,5,Fri May 22 14:47:24 2015 UTC,"It does take more, but only very slightly more. However, the gravity on Minmus is much weaker, so it takes far less dV to land and takeoff."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,mooglinux,2,Fri May 22 14:50:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, getting an encounter with Minmus require more dv (about 70 m/s) compared to Mun. But the gravity well of Mun is much deeper than that of Minmus. Mun's transfer dv advantage becomes completely overtaken by the low gravity of Minmus once you start circularizing. You can compare the value of g depending on the altitude between Minmus (blue) and Mun (purple) to see that it's a huge difference: Picture"
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Dave37,1 point,Fri May 22 14:58:11 2015 UTC,I'm curious: just how big of a difference does this maneuver make? Does anyone have numbers?
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,asaz989,2,Wed May 27 05:21:38 2015 UTC,"It's pretty significant. Say you want to go to Duna from Minmus orbit. If you do it directly, I get a 630 m/s escape burn from Minmus. That'll get you a Duna encounter.  On the other hand, if you do a 160 m/s burn to get down to low Kerbin orbit altitude. From there you need about 150 m/s more for a Duna encounter. So in total 310 m/s. So about 50% cheaper. If you're going further, like Jool, it gets even more significant."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Olog,4,Wed May 27 08:20:39 2015 UTC,"In terms of location, its going to be more efficient to base the operation around Minmus. It'll be lower cost orbiting the fuel etc there.  What I had planned to do though was to keep a station in LKO with fuel and freight the fuel from the Minmus Fuel Depot to the LKO Fuel Depot. That way outbound ships don't have to fool around going out to minmus ot refuel and can leave from Kerbin (simplifying the whole interplanetary thing).  http://kerbalx.com/rootnegative/Whale-Class-Freighter There is my freighter. Its good to carry two large tanks untouched from Minmus back to LKO."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,rootnegative,1 point,Fri May 22 04:02:21 2015 UTC,This is how I would go about it. It makes sense to have your refueling station in lko because it is a common starting spot for all outbound ships.  Just build a mining/refining station at minimus and freight the fuel to your lko refueling base.
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,ScottsRay,7,Mon May 25 03:44:30 2015 UTC,"The advantage of the Mun is that although you're spending more DV on the day-to-day extractions, the stable orbit of the Mun allows you to depart directly from a well-timed Munar burn, slingshot around Kerbin and perform your ejection burn with very tight control over where you're headed.    Minmus, while easy to maneuver on, is much harder to schedule departing interplanetary burns from due to its far-off, heavily inclined orbit.  You'll be waiting a long time for things to line up, waiting a long time to transfer to your Kerbin periapsis, and you frequently encounter an ill-placed mun when you need it least.  You could burn directly from Minmus, but then you lose the benefit of the Oberth effect."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,TMarkos,12,Fri May 22 05:28:01 2015 UTC,"The (actually low) inclination of Minmus is going to have very little effect on your interplanetary trajectory.  Even if it were in a polar orbit and you departed to Kerbin north or south, your solar orbit would be almost equatorial."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,RoboRay,4,Fri May 22 13:19:10 2015 UTC,"The inclination of Minmus orbit might have no effect at all, it depends on where in Minmus' orbit you leave Kerbin's influence. The largest possible interplanetary inclination you can have leaving the Kerbin system is 0.35 degrees."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Dave37,8,Fri May 22 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  0.35 degrees certainly falls in the range of ""very little effect""."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,RoboRay,2,Fri May 22 14:37:03 2015 UTC,If we talk about Minmus the maximal interplanetary inclination resulting from the inclination of Minmus is 0.03 degrees. You will have piloting errors with magnitudes greater than that.
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Dave37,1 point,Fri May 22 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"You could burn directly from Minmus, but then you lose the benefit of the Oberth effect.   Wouldn't that still be better than from a low kerbin parking orbit? since you're pretty much already almost out of kerbin's SOI"
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,thisisalili,5,Fri May 22 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"One way or another I think you should mine from minmus. It is smaller, easier to escape from and doesn't require as much thrust. I would say that the ore density doesn't matter since you can just timewarp to mine anyway.   That said I think there are a couple options for your fuel depot. I would suggest that you don't put it in orbit of either mun or minmus but instead an orbit around kerbin. This way you can avoid having to break your craft free of their sphere of influence. Not to mention that everything is simpler when you are trying to rendezvous with something that is orbiting the same body as you. I would say put it in either LKO, which is easy to get to and makes your ejection burn simpler, or in an orbit just below the mun, which would let you get more of your ∆v out of the way before leaving and potentially make your ejection burn smaller. The reason I suggest an orbit just below the mun is so that you can get a balance of a high altitude (meaning more energy put into your escape pre-refuel) and low orbital period (which means you will be lined up on the correct part of you orbit for escaping more frequently). Being just below the mun offers said nice balance and reduces the chance of accidental mun encounters as compared to above the mun. Just make sure you are lower than it's sphere of influence.  Lastly you have to know the best way to escape. I see three ways. 1) For LKO it is fairly easy. As soon as you have a departure window you just burn so that you escape parallel to kerbin prograde or retrograde (depending on destination). Tweak your manoeuvre node until you have what you need. 2) This is also an option if you are going with the just below the mun strategy, but as you mentioned not the only one. 3) You could instead lower your periapsis and then burn there to complete your escape. As you said to SenorPuff the timing would be tricky but if you play around with a manoeuvre node it would be doable. This is another reason why it would be better to orbit kerbin directly as it would be easier to time if you could slide a node along your orbit. As for which option is more efficient, think of it this way. The orbit you are in when you start from a high orbit and lower your periapsis is the same as if you were part way through an ejection burn from LKO. The question is is it more efficient to raise your apoapsis (and just keep burning until escape) or lower your periapsis. The later also has the benefit of breaking up your burns so if you are using nerv engines they have a chance to cool off. As for which of the three methods is suits you, I will let you decide.  So for my final recommendation I would say have two depots. Get fuel from Minmus and bring it back to a depot in LKO and another one Just below the Mun. This offers more flexibility and lets you get more fuel from LKO even if you just need it for the trip to the next station. And lets be honest here. Docking to space stations is sexy as hell. Who wouldn’t want to do it twice?  As with all my posts I try to explain clearly but if I was unclear or missed something, tell me and I will try to help. Best of luck.  Edit: TL:DR Mine from minmus. Put depot in kerbin orbit just below mun. Lower periapsis to take advantage of oberth effect."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,2silverseas,1 point,Fri May 22 07:14:50 2015 UTC,"TL:DR Mine from minmus. Put depot in kerbin orbit just below mun. Lower periapsis to take advantage of oberth effect.   forgive me but could you elaborate?  I dont know numbers but lets say you put a fuel station at 1,000km (or another more appropriate distance far off the atmosphere) in orbit around kerbin (vs low kerbin at 100km).  Would you dock there, fuel and then intentionally drop your periapsis down to 75km and then burn at 75km to get out of the kerbin sphere of influence?"
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,bluehousekarma,1 point,Fri May 22 07:34:43 2015 UTC,"Basically yes. The idea is that you would first send your interplanetary craft to low kerbin orbit. Then burn out too the 1,000 km station. At this point you can refuel from the station. Then you would drop your periapsis. The idea is that when you get to your periapsis you would already have most of the energy you needed and would only have to add a little more to escape. Assuming that you are measuring ∆v Usage from the last refuelling, it can (at least from higher altitudes) be more efficient to lower your periapsis from high orbit than raise your apoapsis from low orbit.   Now what may be even better is to go up to the high orbit station but instead of lowering your periapsis and then burning from there, you could just burn prograde and escape straight from the high orbit (as you would normally do from low orbit) then you can still take advantage of having the extra altitude (and easier escape) with a much simpler manoeuvre.  To be honest I don't have a good enough grasp of the oberth effect to be able to tell you which option is more efficient and it would probably depend on your starting altitude and maybe even where you are going. I have used the low periapsis method at least once to get from minmus to jool and my manoeuvre nodes said the direct alternative would have taken more but I can't really say at what altitude it becomes more efficient. I hope that this is clarifying and not just even more confusing."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,2silverseas,1 point,Fri May 22 08:06:10 2015 UTC,"The problem with launching from minimus is that you usually aren't in the right spot when the window comes up, and orbital period is super long.  A 1000km orbit though, I get 112 minute orbital period, that works really really well."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Fri May 22 09:13:09 2015 UTC,"Remember that KEO is ~2,869 km altitude, but is on a 6h orbital period.  As I understand it, that should be a short enough period to ensure you are doing your transfer from the correct place for most, if not all, interplanetary transfer windows."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,krenshala,1 point,Fri May 22 21:50:49 2015 UTC,A really interesting balance of all the options. I might give this a shot and take some numbers to have a comparison against the other methods. Thanks.
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,SenorPuff,2,Fri May 22 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"You'll probably use less fuel going from Mun or Minmus back to LKO than you use launching, but I think, if you're already at the Mun, dropping to a circular LKO orbit might cost you more than you save in Oberth gains.   The reasoning I think this is: Kerbin escape velocity from Mun SOI is less than from LKO, and if aimed correctly this gets you about 2/3rds of the way to Duna, as an example. Going further, however, will net more Oberth gains. Going to Jool it might be worth dropping your periapsis back to Kerbin to get those gains.   Math will answer better than my guess, and I'm stuck at work for another hour or two, but I'll see what I can do."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,SenorPuff,4,Fri May 22 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"dropping to a circular LKO orbit might cost you more than you save in Oberth gains.   Would I really need to circularize at LKO, though? Wouldn't it also be possible to fly down to a 75km Kerbin periapsis and do the interplanetary burn right then and there? It'd have to be timed well, sure, but if I'm setting myself efficiency challenges, that seems like it would be part of the fun."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,RoboRay,3,Fri May 22 03:47:32 2015 UTC,"You'd have to time it so your apoapsis after leaving Mun SOI is in the right direction to not need to circularize. Possible, but reliant on Munar orbit."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Khaur,2,Fri May 22 04:30:33 2015 UTC,"No, you would not want to circularize at LKO...  you'd want to wait until whichever moon you chose is on the opposite side of Kerbin from the proper ejection angle for your transfer burn, then give yourself a low Pe over Kerbin.  The catch is that the moon may be in the wrong place when you want to leave.  It doesn't have to be perfectly aligned (45 degrees out will still give a lot of Oberth gains, considering how elliptical your orbit will be), and transfer windows are wide enough that you may be able to wait a week or two to get a better alignment.  Because of the alignment issue, the Mun is an easier place to depart from, since it circles around more quickly.  But you'll spend more fuel lifting fuel off the surface there.    To simplify things, I'd just put the fueling station in LKO and the refinery on Minmus, then aerobrake fuel shipments down to the station."
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,RoboRay,1 point,Fri May 22 13:16:40 2015 UTC,"I think you can get around the alignment issue with a little more planning, by leaving on a previous orbit.  Depart from Minmus/Mun to 75km periapsis earlier, when it is opposite of the desired escape burn.  At periapsis, raise apoapsis to adjust your orbital period so that you end up at periapsis again at the time you want to do your escape burn.  Execute the remainder of the escape burn when needed.  Pros:    It gives you full control over the escape burn You get the whole Oberth effect of dipping from high altitude Having more burns helps if you have low thrust   Cons:   More planning Longer mission time You might get unwanted Mun encounters during your sync orbits if you depart from Minmus (you can probably avoid them by making more period adjustments, but by that point my head is hurting)"
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,CambleC,2,Fri May 22 15:49:29 2015 UTC,Good point... you should be able to get around the moon phasing issue by departing early into a holding orbit that will put you in the right place at the right time.  But the planning for that gets complicated.

KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,Dave37,1 point,Fri May 22 15:05:12 2015 UTC,Maybe a depot in high Kerbin orbit (higher than Minmus)? From it you can dive into Kerbin and burn at PE. It will be efficient due to the Oberth effect.
KerbalAcademy,36u2h7,AdrianBlake,1 point,Fri May 22 10:18:44 2015 UTC,"Before 1.x, I had a station in orbit around Kerbin at an altitude of 15000 km, just outside Mun's orbit. It worked fine for me. When returning from other planets, you could aerobreak in Kerbin's atmosphere as to make your apoapsis intersect the station orbit.  If you put it very high, beyond Minmus, it will take very long to complete an orbit and it will be very sensitive to small dv changes.  Picture: http://i.imgur.com/GiKV5vu.jpg"

Then build back from there.   For example, to return from the Mun you need a return stage with your pod/chute. That's all. You can store all the science in there. Then you need your lander stage, with just what you need to land(return stage plus experiments legs, and fuel).

A couple things to consider is how much science tech are you putting on your payloads and how heavy are they getting?  Science equipment alone can get pretty pricey pretty quick, especially if you're using other mods to collect data.  Some of the equipment I use can run up to 5k a pop easy, and that's for just one piece.  Throw 4 different science collection pieces that I didn't have earlier in the game and suddenly the same lander is now 20k more expensive.  And weight plays an important factor because it adds up quick.  If you add more weight to your lander, you need more fuel to get it back home.  Which means you need more fuel in your transfer stage to account for both the lander weight and return stage fuel.  Which means you need more fuel in earlier stages to account for all of that as well.  So pretty soon you start needing a lot more fuel and possibly even more expensive engines/stages at the base level of your craft.

Because I don't have to land it again, there is no waste of leaving stages behind, all the fuel for getting up there each time.  In one go, this thing did one pickup in just short of mun orbit, then two around the mun, then one at minimus and then headed back.  (Where it ran out of fuel in orbit, but I had another ship go refuel it).  That will more than pay for it.   But, yeah 100,000 is a bit much for a mun mission.  Lot of good tips here on this, so not much I can add.  But think re-use :)"

(if it's ""right next to"", then I don't know why the probe doesn't have a connection through its own LoS) I don't think capsules have SPUs, which you would need for it to be a relay.

The other is whether or not you have enough power.  I've had satellites well within range of KSC fail to communicate because the power drawn by the dishes, antenna, probe core and SAS were about 120% of the power provided by the solar panels.  By shutting down one of my two dishes I suddenly had enough power to run everything else, and it started acting like a relay again.  The other obvious question is -- did it work before?  I've had satellites relay through manned ships when just out of range so from what we can see and you describe, I believe it should work."

KerbalAcademy,36rta9,Elite051,7,Thu May 21 16:46:34 2015 UTC,What is the difference in velocity between suborbital flights and return from orbit flights?  When you return from orbit you tend to be moving much faster then a short suborbital hop. This difference is likely the cause of your issue.  You may need to take a shallower approach when returning from orbit.

KerbalAcademy,36rta9,rootnegative,1 point,Fri May 22 02:14:04 2015 UTC,Especially in the upper atmosphere this can be useful. I tend to pump forward on reentry and backwards at lower altitudes to get a little more maneuverability for bleeding speed and flaring.

KerbalAcademy,36seip,ShrineDog,2,Thu May 21 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"This may not be exactly what you're looking for, but I've got an R script that does something that's similar.  You specify how many satellites you want to put into a circular orbit (equidistant from one another) by means of a phasing orbit, and it tells you where to put the phasing orbit's Ap/Pe.  But if you want just 2 satellites sharing an orbit, and you don't want them equidistantly spaced from one another (some arbitrary angle), this script isn't what you're looking for.   The script:  EquidistantOrbitPlanner.r The table the script needs for orbital info:  KSPConstants.txt   Keep the KSPConstants.txt table in the same folder as EquidistantOrbitPlanner.r.  EDIT:  I just realized the script's path to the table is a hardcoded path, bah.  Just change that path in the script to wherever you put the table."
KerbalAcademy,36seip,Entropius,2,Thu May 21 19:40:52 2015 UTC,"/u/Entropius' solution should work, as it sounds like its doing just what I do manually.  Figure out the orbital period of your desired orbit (for KEO that would be 6 hours), divide that by the number of satellites to be placed equidistant on that orbit, which determines one ""unit"" of time.  Next either add (or subtract) one ""unit"" from the target orbital period and that determines your deployment orbit's period. As long as your apoapsis (if in a smaller orbit) or your periapsis (if in a larger orbit) matches the target orbit, you'll have the correct phase adjustment at deployment.  e.g., 6 hour orbit (KEO) for 5 satellites.  If your deployment orbit was smaller, your target apoapsis is at KEO altitude and the deployment orbital period would be 6h - (1h 12m) or 4h 48m. Then you just drop off a satellite every time you pass apoapsis, switch to it and boost to a (near) circular orbit with a 6h period, switch back to the carrier vessel and wait for the next apoapsis to repeat.  Using my method, the hardest part is determining the target circular orbit distance (altitude) for the desired orbital period.  Easily solved with a spreadsheet and/or calculator."

KerbalAcademy,36qx7x,Kogster,2,Thu May 21 13:11:42 2015 UTC,"Yes having the center of lift ahead of the ""center of drag"" which in reality is best approximated by center of lift gives stability defined as it's ability to maintain that direction without control input. Problem is that the more stable something is the less controllable it becomes and that's why you want them close. It wants to keep a certain heading but not too much."
KerbalAcademy,36qx7x,CraftyCaprid,2,Thu May 21 13:36:45 2015 UTC,"If you are having trouble mid flight and not early flight, make sure to look at your CoM and CoL in the SPH while you have little or no fuel in the tanks.

KerbalAcademy,36qx7x,Salanmander,3,Thu May 21 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"Additionally, approaching the speed of sound can increase drag on the front of the ship, moving you CoL forward.

KerbalAcademy,36ohu0,Deimos_F,3,Wed May 20 21:50:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, with the new aerodynamics in 1.x you can exceed the terminal velocity during ascent without incurring the drag penalties you would have gotten in earlier versions. However, the shape of your rocket/plane will determine whether its a good idea or not (some designs will allow it, others will still behave like pre-1.0 for drag).  If you need to adjust your orbit (raise/lower Pe and lower/raise Ap at the same time) you want to burn radial while half way between the two based on time (which on a circular orbit would also be half-way based on distance).  For inclination/plane changes, you get more efficiency doing the burn at the node, and even more efficiency using the node closest to your apoapsis (farthest from the body you are orbiting).  Mid-course corrections should be done early in your transfer as small changes (fractions of a m/s of Δv) give larger end-point changes the earlier in the flight you make them.  Sometimes RCS is a better choice than your engine for these due to the lower thrust and corresponding greater control in the end result."

Set up a burn to match your new orbit to tangentially meet the targets periapsis.  Match inclinations with the target.  Set up a burn at that periapsis.  (You can burn at your periapsis if they don't line up exactly.  The goal is to get your flight paths as close as possible for that part of the orbit.)  You want to fly to a higher, slower orbit for the amount of time it will take for you to meet up with the target.  As you drag the prograde marker out at the burn node, you will see the target markers move until they are close together.  Execute that burn, and you should have a rendezvous.   Then, fly that orbit until you reach the periapsis.  The target will catch up to you in its lower orbit.  Once you meet up at the periapsis, just burn in target mode to match speeds with the target.  Note:  Starting out ahead of the target is good because in low orbit, you don't have room to burn retrograde to a lower, elliptical orbit.  Thus, you can't speed up to catch the target without encountering the atmosphere.  Also, the node doesn't have to be at the targets periapsis, it just seems more efficient to do it that way.

The thing is that if you haven’t burned enough by the time you reach the AN itself, you’ll have to wait half an orbit to perfect your inclination at the DN (or vice versa).  If you burn a little early, you’ll push the node back. If you have a 20 s burn, start at maybe 15 s before AN. Five seconds into the burn, at full throttle, you’ll find that the AN isn’t actually ten seconds away. It’s somewhat farther.  For a perfect plane‐match in one manœuvre , you want to control your throttle carefully: throttle down if the time to AN/DN is increasing, throttle up if it’s approaching too rapidly.  KER or MechJeb are convenient for time‐to‐AN/DN display, but you can do it from the map screen, too.  tl;dr: Half before, half after is close enough, but err on the side of early."

I have a set of rules - to raise apo do this to raise pere do that, but not why it works.  In case of matching orbit it makes sense that you want to burn at AN or DN, as burn doesn't really change your current position much, rather it modifies orbit, and AN/DN are the only two points where ship is in the plane we want to reach. It makes sense you have to do it along normale, as any acceleration in current orbit plane will only affect orbit shape in the plane and not change inclination. But whether I should burn normal or antinormal is not obvious to me at all."
KerbalAcademy,36pgoc,Artorp,3,Thu May 21 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"Think about it like this, at the descending node you are going downwards, so you'd want to burn up, normal. At the ascending node you're going upwards, so you'd want to burn down, anti-normal."
KerbalAcademy,36pgoc,krenshala,2,Thu May 21 05:26:49 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I'll have to bite the bullet and read up on orbital mechanics -- still feeling confused and uncertain. That and fly more. Definetly fly more.
KerbalAcademy,36pgoc,SenorPuff,1 point,Thu May 21 05:48:24 2015 UTC,"He covered the ascending/descending nodes (normal to the plane of your orbit).  The rest, for me at least, is easily remembered by something I read in Larry Niven's The Integral Trees (story about humans living in a habitable ""smoke ring"" around a neutron star).   east (forward/prograde) takes you out (higher altitude) out takes you west (backward/retorgrade) west takes you in in takes you east   This sums up things like burning retrograde (engine toward your direction of motion) slows you down, which lowers your periapsis, which takes you into a lower, faster orbit, and to stay down at that lower orbit you then burn retrograde again when you reach periapsis.  The end result is you slow down twice to end up going just slightly faster."

Construct a vector with that speed as the magnitude, direction horizontal. That's your target velocity vector. Put it tail-to-tail with your current velocity vector, and the burn vector is the difference (head of your current velocity vector to head of the target velocity vector).  I haven't seen a mod to provide this, probably because there's usually a more efficient way to accomplish most missions that doesn't include a ""circularize here""."
KerbalAcademy,36nu7l,undercoveryankee,2,Wed May 20 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"Calculate the speed for a circular orbit at your current altitude.   Vo = sqrt( M * G / radius )  Radius is your altitude over the body, plus the radius of the body itself.  G is the gravitational constant.  M is the mass of the body you are orbiting.  This gives you the orbital velocity (Vo) for a circular orbit at that radius.  Once you have Vo, you can use it to calculate the orbital period, which can be quite useful for semi-synchronous orbits."

KerbalAcademy,36nu7l,jofwu,2,Thu May 21 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"So reading through the comments you're looking for an easy way to estimate the vector in your head. So here it is.  Your orbit has 4 points: apoapsis, periapsis, and the two points equidistant between those (one ascending and one descending).   Understand how to circularize at any one of the points: at apoapsis your vector is pro grade, at the ascending point your vector will be anti-radial (straight down to remove your vertical velocity), and so on.  Now you've got 4 points and you can pretty easily estimate the midpoint between those 4 points. The vector for those is simply the midpoint between the corresponding vectors. That gives you 8 accurate spots to circularize.  Beyond that will be estimated guessing without the use of a tool."
KerbalAcademy,36nu7l,SnowyDuck,1 point,Wed May 20 22:51:20 2015 UTC,"The ascending/descending nodes are not equidistant between Ap and Pe. In fact, it's entirely possible for the nodes to coincide with them."
KerbalAcademy,36nu7l,jofwu,1 point,Thu May 21 20:58:00 2015 UTC,Not the ascending/descending nodes. Those are when your orbit crosses the equator.   The midpoint between you ap/pe is for vertical velocity. When your vertical velocity is at it's greatest (positive or negative). Which is why you counteract your vertical velocity when its at its greatest - by burning radial/anti-radial.

If you're halfway between Pe and Ap, rising, it's anti-radial.  And if you're halfway between Ap and Pe, descending, it's radial.  That's the same direction, every time...  http://i.imgur.com/Qw6TpN5.png  Or, close to that, anyway.  The actual direction does wander back and forth depending on your position in the orbit, but not a lot.  There's no NavBall marker for it, but it's also not hard to approximate by just checking to see where you are in your orbit.  You should be able to eyeball it to within a few degrees, which is generally good enough for KSP.  If you're in between any of those points, you'll need to adjust in between those vectors, proportionally (if you're three quarters of the way from Pe to Ap, you'd point halfway between anti-radial and prograde)."

KerbalAcademy,36nu7l,SenorPuff,1 point,Wed May 20 19:29:10 2015 UTC,How would it be any more complicated than any other node.  Docking nodes or target nodes are also always moving.

KerbalAcademy,36nu7l,onlycatfud,1 point,Wed May 20 22:29:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's a closed form solution. With docking nodes there's a discrete distance measured in the game. I can try to do the math this evening, but it's not exactly the same as 'go to this location'. You're burning along a circularization vector but the ΔV necessary is different at every point and is dependent upon previous burns."

KerbalAcademy,36orzg,TheGuardianGI,9,Wed May 20 23:01:27 2015 UTC,"Man, that is one unstable rocket. Aside from a redesign, there are 3 things you can do to make it more stable:   Disable gimbal. While very powerful, gimbal has a tendency to overcorrect again and again, which can lead to rapid unplanned dissassembly. If you find that you no longer have enough turning power, add more tail fins. Put a probe core at the point around which is rotating, and control it from there. For this rocket, that would be right between the adapter and the decoupler. All rocket control systems work in relation to the center of control, so if your pod is at the top, and the rocket bends 2°, the system will think that the entire rocket has just turned 2°. This will cause the bottom half of the rocket to turn to -2°, which will travel up your rocket like a whip, and move the pod to -4°, etc. This idea is specific to your rocket: Decouplers/seperators/docking ports are often the most bendy parts, so strutting to them has limited effectiveness. Instead of strutting the fuel tank to the decoupler, strut the bottom of the fuel tank to the middle of the Kerbodyne adapter."
KerbalAcademy,36orzg,Rubicj,1 point,Wed May 20 23:38:53 2015 UTC,Number three was my thought too. As Rubicj said put struts directly between the orange tanks and the adaptor (or even the large tank below the adaptor). I would recommend using struts on both the central and radial tanks.  This will make it so that you are reenforcing the adaptor/decoupler joint as well as the decoupler /engine joint. It should also give the struts more leverage.

KerbalAcademy,36mv55,bobbertmiller,6,Wed May 20 16:37:03 2015 UTC,"The best way to build is from the top to the bottom (of the staging list). You want to get back from the Mün, so build something with high enough TWR to lift off and enough fuel to get back (580+310 to get out of the Mün SOI, another like 400 to get low enough into the atmosphere to aerobrake). If you want to LAND this thing (edit: on the Mün!), add enough fuel on top. Add a transfer stage, add a high orbit stage, add a first lifter stage. Edit 1: Another few hints. Do NOT use SRB for delta v, use them for thrust!  Best way I've found is to have a big liquid fueled center stage that can barely lift the rocket, then add SRB til you have a TWR of 1.7. Once the SRB run out, your liquid fuel should be burned off enough so you get that level of thrust without the SRB. This also means you have an engine that can steer by thrust vectoring and doesn't need finicky fins."

I'd suggest instead working on something more kerbal if you don't have the 2.5m engines: asparagus staging.  I'll let the wiki explain that better than I can. I've also used a similar fuel line free technique whose name I don't know of having different sized fuel tanks in my radial stage. (so engine 1 3 and 5 will have 1 minute of fuel, 2 4 and 6 will have 2 minutes, drop them as they run out) I like this because it lets me burn through  bit more fuel and keep my TWR high after I dump. engines, but its also well adapted to not having fuel lines at all if that's your tech path."

Some pods have more weight per passenger than others.  I suggest you take the pods you have access to, and divide their mass by the number of seats, so you'll find the mass-per-occupant ratio, and use the lowest one.  If I remember correctly, in all likelihood you will be using three single seat pods, as for a long time in the tech tree that's the most efficient way of carrying multiple crew."
KerbalAcademy,36mv55,Burt2004,1 point,Wed May 20 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"iirc, the landing can is the lightest, but you might have to do a rescue mission to get them back from orbit as I'm not sure you really want to do reentry in one of those."
KerbalAcademy,36mv55,wooq,2,Thu May 21 09:26:49 2015 UTC,"First, if you haven't, install Kerbal Engineer Redux.  This will expose essential numbers about your craft, such as overall thrust-to-weight ratio, ∆v, burn time, all per stage and for the whole craft.  Next, take a look at some of the ∆v maps online.  Google ""KSP delta v map"" and pick one, they're all accurate enough.  Now you have some numbers to shoot for.  To land on Mun, return to orbit, and then get back to Kerbin it takes about 1800 ∆v.  That's what you need in your lander/return stage.  Switch your KER readout to reflect Mun numbers.  Build your lander.  Don't be afraid to experiment with asparagus staging (which others have recommended).  It's not really necessary in your lander, but if you can't figure out how to eke out enough ∆v to tackle your problem, it can get you over the hump. It's an easy way to discard extra engines/empty fuel tanks that are no longer needed so you don't have to push that useless mass around.  You also might consider having a landing stage with a high (Mun) TWR engine, then a return stage with lighter, more efficient engines where you don't care about being able to slow down quickly.  Figure out some arrangement that will give you 1800 ∆v.  Be sure to cut weight wherever possible.  You're not going to be using monopropellant on this trip, so empty out the reserves in the command pod.  Think about every part you put on the ship, whether it's necessary or not.  You want a lander that controls well and has the bare essential equipment you need to accomplish your mission objectives (transport two people, collect a bit of science, have electricity, heat shield, and parachutes for the return trip).  You don't need ladders on the Mun, you don't need cool-looking aerodynamic parts in the vacuum of space, etc.  Now your job is to get that to Mun orbit.  Getting to Munar orbit from Kerbin takes about 1200 ∆v.  Build this into a transfer stage below your lander/return stage(s).  This shouldn't be hard to accomplish, just slap a LFO tank or two and a poodle on.  Note you'll probably want to switch over to Earth numbers in KER, since this stage will be used in Kerbin's sphere of influence.  Now you just need to get that into orbit around Kerbin.  This takes around 4000 ∆v with an inefficient ascent profile (you can get to space with <3700 ∆v but never hurts to have spare).  Though, switch your KER to atmospheric mode... most engines lose thrust and efficiency in atmo.  This stage is where you'll see the best results from asparagus staging.  Use big engines but don't overdo it.  At liftoff you can have a high TWR, but you don't need it after you get up to a high enough speed that the stability of your craft takes over.  You only need a TWR of 1.2-1.5 once you're airborne; your TWR will improve as you burn fuel and lose mass (check the numbers in KER!).  Your TWR should not drop below ~1.2 or so at any point, though, otherwise you might not be able to correct for inefficiencies in your ascent.  Make sure to add a couple fins or winglets to the ass-end for aerodynamic stability and control.  If you have fuel left over in your ascent stage once you get to orbit, use it to start your burn for the Mun.  Likewise if you have fuel left over once you're in Mun orbit with your transfer stage, use it to start your descent... you might even carry it with you all the way to your final approach then dump it.  That way you can carry your margin of error into the next stage, so you're sure to have the maximum amount of fuel possible at the end.  If you construct a craft to these parameters, you'll get to the mun and back, with a good bit of margin for error.  TL;DR: you need ~7000 ∆v (with a very good margin of error) all-told to get to Mun and back.  You will need TWR > 1.2 to get to space from Kerbin, and want a high TWR (at least 2) when you land on Mun.  To take off from Mun you need a TWR > 1.  All other stages you can have low TWR.  Use KER to build a craft to that spec, experiment with different engines and staging (especially asparagus staging) to minimize the amount of weight you're carrying at any point.  Don't forget electricity, parachutes, a heat shield, landing legs, and to test that you can get out of the hatch of your craft before taking off.

KerbalAcademy,36mv55,jochem_m,1 point,Wed May 20 18:00:27 2015 UTC,I didnt downvote. But you won't need 7000 dV. Probably closer to 5k. TWR at kerbin to orbit should be at least 1.5 to 2.0. I strive to be be btwn 1.7 but I find it varies.
KerbalAcademy,36kt7o,rootnegative,8,Wed May 20 02:57:18 2015 UTC,"This can actually vary quite a lot depending on the design of the rocket. Overall height, center of mass and drag will make a rocket less or more prone to ""tipping"" into the prograde marker. TWR also plays a part.   I find myself playing with ascent profiles several times whenever I build a new design before I actually send the rocket on its mission. MechJebs Ascent Guidance helps tremendously with this."
KerbalAcademy,36kt7o,Rule_32,2,Wed May 20 05:47:12 2015 UTC,"So does that mean, it would be more efficient to launch at an angle? Say 70 degrees?"
KerbalAcademy,36kt7o,aykcak,7,Wed May 20 08:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, depending on your TWR. The more ass-kicking your first stage, the farther your nose can be from vertical. But you'll need to be careful to have a mostly vertical component at first to keep gravity from immediately dragging your rocket sideways, especially if you have fins low on the body. The sideways component of the relative wind would rotate the tail up and push the nose low if you have more horizontal component than vertical.   Have a look at the way cruise missiles launch IRL: mostly up to get relative wind flowing over the fins/wings, slightly sideways to clear the ship quickly in case of malfunction, and  with a hard kick from the initial boost motor.   Ballistic missile interceptor launches would actually be closer to the flight profile we're after, and they also go mostly vertical to start, but it does look like there's some horizontal component at T-0:00."
KerbalAcademy,36kt7o,Rockleg,1 point,Wed May 20 09:06:00 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that the ballistic missile interceptor spins for the first stage, I presume to lend some stability until it has enough speed for the stabilizers to keep it straight. I might try that sometime."

You lose the Oberth effect of Kerbin, which is much more useful than that of the Mun. There is the very rare phase angle match up where gravity assisting off the Mun puts you in a Duna intercept but that's extremely rare.   Gravity assists give more benefit when going between planets, such as braking around Eve to go to Moho, or boosting off Jool to get to Eeloo"

KerbalAcademy,36kud4,wooq,2,Wed May 20 19:25:55 2015 UTC,"Sure. If you want to do it you can, if you have no problem waiting for that specific window, but it doesn't gain you much. You have to be going on an escape trajectory that the Mun bends and adds a bit of velocity to. Since gravity assists work best with high closing speed and change of direction, the relatively small change of direction drastically limits it's utility. You might save a hundred m/s but not really worth all the work IMO."
KerbalAcademy,36kud4,SenorPuff,1 point,Wed May 20 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"Wait... that doesn't sound right at all. It might not be worth the trouble, but it's still technically a better option. No?  A gravity assist doesn't have to be powered. You won't ""lose the Oberth effect of Kerbin"" by doing a gravity assist. You burn from your low Kerbin orbit just like you would anyways. The only difference is you get a small (unpowered) boost from the Mun on your way out of Kerbin's SOI. Meaning the burn from Kerbin can be a few m/s less than it would have to be otherwise (the slingshot making up the difference).  I don't know how much delta-v it would add (and thus save you), and I definitely imagine it might not be worth the trouble of finding the right position and time for the node (so that the Mun is in the right place at the right time). But it IS a viable way to safe fuel.  Maybe you were only trying to say it's not worth the trouble, but that second sentence is misleading."

That's not more efficient. If you burn all at 80-100km from Kerbin and gain a slight bit by waiting until that burn perfectly coincides with the Mun's and Duna's phases, you'll gain a miniscule amount. It won't be all that much since you're going so fast and at a bad angle to benefit, but you will get some."

Never use the mun as a gravity assist. It does more harm than help. It probably could help if you do a bunch of equations and have an exact burn...but otherwise it won't and will just make you burn more delta-v.  When going back from Jool, a Gravity Assist around a planet (e.g., Duna), could help you slow down and save delta-v, as well as decrease how brutal the aerocapture around Kerbin is (if you are using one).  Finally, if you really want to do gravity assists instead of doing normal Hohmann orbits to save time...use the flyby finder."

Add some more (or less if your periapsis is below Kerbins surface) delta v to your prograde burn until you have the most efficient burn that still gets you to the desired reentry height (I shoot for 25km every time, Mun or Minmus).  You're most efficient burn will most likely point you slightly off from the Muns own retrograde direction. Hope this helps."

Slight inclination means you'll probably have to burn after exiting Mun SOI to get an aerobraking orbit around Kerbin."

So, if you're orbiting the Mun to the east (a prograde orbit), make your transfer burn while over the Kerbin-facing side of the Mun.  If you're going west (in a retrograde orbit), make your burn over the far side of the Mun.  If you're in a polar orbit, make your burn over whichever pole happens to be under you when you're moving in generally the opposite direction that the Mun moves."

KerbalAcademy,36i4w0,KuuLightwing,19,Tue May 19 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, this caught my interest.  I have a weakness for optimization problems (as evidence, I previously solved the optimization of the bi-elliptic inclination change).  So I sat down and solved it. At first glance, there appear to be 3 parameters to consider: the initial velocity with which you approach, the chosen final 'high' altitude, and the chosen 'close' altitude for the insertion burn. But it turns out, with some somewhat clever choices of variables, that the final altitude doesn't really matter, and that the only parameters that effect the result are the initial (pre-insertion) velocity, and the ratio of the flyby orbital radius to the final 'high' orbital radius.  I derived the delta-v required to make the two burns for your second option, and compared it to the delta-v needed for the single burn situation. The resulting equation was rather disgusting (square roots everywhere, nothing simplified, eww), but when I plotted it in Wolfram Alpha the result was staggering straightforward:  The low-orbit circularization maneuver is only more efficient when you approach the system with a velocity greater than the escape velocity of your final orbit. By escape velocity, I technically mean the velocity necessary to escape to infinity, not just escape the SOI. Real-world physics doesn't have sphere's-of-influence, so it's not obvious how to convert this escape velocity into something usable in KSP.  So if you're approaching the body with a fairly low speed, it's better to go straight to your final orbit. High velocity approaches benefit from the low-altitude burn.  The question of what flyby radius is optimal for minimizing delta-v is absolutely straightforward by comparison: as low as possible. My calculation neglects air friction, of course, so this doesn't apply to bodies with atmosphere, but in general, the lower you do your insertion burn, the more benefit you get from the Oberth effect (as you would expect).  I have the derivation on scrap paper, and I skipped a few steps, but I could write it up if anyone wants to see the full process in all its mathy glory."

You won all the Internets :D As you describe it, basically, it's almost always more efficient to go for Oberth-effect maneuver, because for interplanetary transfers, I would usually go faster than escape velocity. Also, if I'm not mistaken, leaving SOI is fairly close in terms of dV to real escape velocity, isn't it?"

KerbalAcademy,36i4w0,listens_to_galaxies,1 point,Tue May 19 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"OK, here is a very illustrative plot of the function. The x-axis is ratio of flyby radius to final radius, and must be between 0 and 1 for the derivation to make sense. The y axis is the initial velocity parameter: v-sub-initial2 over v-sub-final2, and must be a positive number (or zero). The z-axis is proportional to delta-v savings (I dropped some unnecessary prefactors, like sqrt(GM/r-sub-final)).  For the equation: the first two terms represent the delta-v required for the 2nd burn of the close flyby (circularization) while the third and fourth terms are the delta-v for the flyby insertion burn.  The fifth and sixth terms are the delta-v required for a direct-to-circular burn. The first through fourth terms are negative of what I described, so that the equation is delta-v_(1 burn) - delta-v_(flyby+circularization), so that smaller delta-v for the flyby maneuver produces positive delta-v savings.  At the point where z=0, the delta-v required is the same; where z is positive, there is a delta-v savings by doing the close flyby. The plot doesn't show z-values, but the cross-over at y=2 is clearly visible, as well as the tendency towards positive and negative extremes as x approaches 0. (x=0 is a discontinuity, but I don't care because it's unphysical.)"

KerbalAcademy,36i4w0,fibonatic,1 point,Tue May 19 20:11:50 2015 UTC,"I also did the maths and came to the same conclusion. I also expressed the required ∆v's with two variables, but this I was not able to see the easy solution (I initially expected a relation between hyperbolic excess velocity and the ratio between periapsis of target orbit), however after plotting it with matlab the solution became clear, namely when the hyperbolic excess velocity is greater than sqrt(2Gm/r) it is better to do a lower periapsis. But it should be noted that this does assume that changing your intercept to raise of lower your periapsis of the encounter trajectory requires no, or an insignificant of ∆v. This is usually try if you change trajectory sufficiently in advance, but if you are going to have a very hyperbolic encounter (encounter trajectory looks very straight) and you decide to change your encounter periapsis just before you enter the SOI it will be significant.  For example if you want to put a satellite into a circular (and equatorial) orbit around the Mun, which method you should use will depend on how high the target orbit is. For a normal transfer from LKO to an intercept with the Mun will result in hyperbolic excess velocity of roughly 260 m/s. This means that the altitude of the target orbit at which the two methods are just as efficient will be equal to 1727 km (or 1927 km semi-major axis), which is only 502 km ""below"" the SOI of the Mun. So only for very high target orbits around the Mun will it be worth it to perform a capture at a lower periapsis. But this might change if you also have to change your inclination and your target orbit is not circular but eccentric."

KerbalAcademy,36i4w0,listens_to_galaxies,1 point,Wed May 20 21:10:22 2015 UTC,"Escape velocity is kind of a physics jargon thing, and it's different between real life and KSP, so I'll lay out my definitions more carefully here:  In the real world, gravity extends out to infinity. This means you can, in principal, orbit as far out as you like, and as you travel outwards, gravity will always be slowing you down (albeit very slowly once you're at a large distance).  The escape velocity is the speed necessary so that gravity will never stop you, so you will fly out to infinite distance without ever stopping. The escape velocity is a function of your orbit, because the further out you are from your object (doesn't matter if you're orbiting a planet, a Sun/star, or a moon; gravity acts the same for all of them) the less velocity you need to go from orbit to escape.  Just like you need more delta-v to go from a low orbit to a high one, you need more delta-v to go from low orbit to escape than from high orbit to escape.  So every orbit you consider will have some orbital velocity (the velocity needed to stay in that orbit), and every orbit will have a corresponding escape velocity (the minimum velocity needed to from the orbit to infinity). Conveniently, the escape velocity is exactly sqrt(2) times the orbital velocity.  But in KSP, things are a bit different. In KSP, gravity stops when you reach the edge of the SOI. So all the gravitational force that would actually act on an object moving between the SOI and infinity, doesn't exist in KSP. So an object in KSP needs less velocity to escape (since it only needs to get to the SOI to escape gravity of that body) than a real world object (which would have to escape to infinity). Also, the real world escape velocity only accounts for the gravity of one body, so multiple bodies is a more complicated case that isn't included in my equations.  So, the real world escape velocity is not really so useful in KSP. I used it because as a physicist I'm naturally drawn to real-world parameters, and using the escape velocity made the equations a lot prettier. Unfortunately, I can't think of an easy way to convert this into something that you can easily calculate with the information KSP gives you. I think that the most practical approach would be to put in the maneuver nodes for the fly-by transfer, see how much delta-v you need, then put in the maneuver nodes for the direct-to-circular, and see which needs less delta-v. Because you can plan multiple maneuvers ahead of time, I think this sort of guess-and-check is probably easier than any specific calculation you might want to make."
KerbalAcademy,36i4w0,Deimos_F,1 point,Thu May 21 05:57:14 2015 UTC,"I get it. Basically when you mentioned the escape to infinity, you were pointing out the disparity between real-world physics calculations and KSP mechanics. Thank you.  So this means, in order to try to select a capture method, you would need to know beforehand the escape velocity from your desired orbit. Any practical method to verify this while in-game?"
KerbalAcademy,36i4w0,listens_to_galaxies,2,Thu May 21 07:07:28 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this a bit (I actually wrote up a section in my previous post, then erased it), but I can't think of any convenient way to extract the necessary parameters from the game without a lot of extra calculations.  Calculating the critical velocity (at which the flyby maneuver becomes more efficient) is straightforward, because it's the escape velocity, which is easy to calculate: v_esc = sqrt(GM/r_orbit) where r_orbit is the radius (not altitude) of the orbit. So it can be calculated directly from the mass and radius of the body and the desired orbital altitude.  But the problem is determining whether your spacecraft will have a higher velocity than this. Before it enters the SOI, it's under the influence of the parent body, which will affect its velocity, making it harder to predict ahead of time.  In principle it's a straightforward, if somewhat tedious, calculation to convert the escape velocity to the velocity at the SOI boundary (so you can see at the boundary if you are moving fast enough), but you probably want to decide which maneuver you want long before entering the SOI (so you can adjust your periapsis to either the final orbit or the flyby ahead of time). And I don't think KSP tells you the SOI entry velocity in advance, does it?  So the result is that it's not easy to calculate which is better, from the position of where you do your approach burn. In principal it could all be calculated out based on your initial approach burn, but the equations are all rather tedious. It could be built into a maneuver calculator mod, I guess.  I can't think of any more practical way of doing it, other than the guess-and-check method I suggested above."

Before 1.0, it took about 8000 m/s to get into orbit from the highest peak on Eve, now it takes about 5500 m/s, and the atmosphere is almost the same as at sea level on Kerbin, so you can use the same engines.  That ship is designed as an SSTO so that's why it has a very low TWR on take-off (I think it was about 1.1 atmospheric), since you can't add another engine without a big mass penalty.

You could estimate since you've covered 8.3% of the Altitude you've covered about 8% of the Δv needed.  Thus about 11km of Δv.  You could argue less because you aren't in the thickest part of the atmosphere as long.  You can use the Mission Planner to figure out the return trip (when you depart is important)"
KerbalAcademy,36i2ps,Stiffishend4,4,Tue May 19 15:28:45 2015 UTC,"You want to make sure you manage your cash flow and keep completing contracts so you don't run out of funds.  The new world's first contracts gives you a nice boost to your funds and you can usually upgrade a building or two early on.  My early targets for those are the launch pad and tracking station.  The tracking station upgrade gives you patched conics, which makes getting an intercept with moons / planets much, much easier.  Tech-wise, I'm going to assume you have unlocked up through the 3rd level nodes (general rocketry, stability, survivability).  Advanced rocketry would be my next target since it unlocks the LV-909, which is super helpful for ships in space.  The bottom side of the tech tree going towards Electrics is helpful to get eventually since it unlocks probes and solar panels, but I wouldn't go for it right away.  You need to balance rocket parts vs science and accessories.  As far as mission progression, yes, a mun flyby and return would be the next step.  At some point, upgrading the astronaut complex to allow for EVAs is good as well.  That will let you get out of the pod and collect crew reports and most science data and store it in the pod.  During the flyby, you can do science over different biomes, EVA, store results in the pod and repeat.  From there, I would recommend going to Minmus for a landing and return mission.  It's a little harder to get to, but vastly easier to land on and return from.  Make sure to accept the Explore Mun and Explore Minmus contracts, as well as any Transmit or Return Science from ___ contracts."
KerbalAcademy,36i2ps,Jim3535,1 point,Tue May 19 16:50:36 2015 UTC,Cool thanks this should keep me going for a bit. I do have a few buildings upgraded and so i can do the evas which helped get me at least 100 science from first orbit. I believe i have the first 3 sections of tech tree unlocked and will deff go form the extra engines next. Ive heard its better to land on minus first but ive had issues try to get an encounter with it but that could just be bad timing
KerbalAcademy,36i2ps,Jim3535,2,Tue May 19 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"Getting a minmus encounter isn't too hard if you use the right technique.    Assuming you have an equatorial orbit around kerbin, target Minmus.  You'll want to put your maneuver node on either ascending or descending nodes (AN or DN marked on your orbit).  Depending on where minmus is in relation to your orbit, you may need to go out beyond minmus' orbit a bit to get an encounter.    This has the effect of making it take longer to get there.  It's useful, because you can use it to compensate for a less than idea phase angle and avoid time warping in LKO. Since you burn at the point your orbits cross, you don't need to worry about the plane of minmus' orbit as much.    Once you plot and do the initial burn, place a maneuver node on your path half way to minmus.  Double click on minmus to focus your view on it.  Now you can use the maneuver node to make small adjustments and fine tune your approach.  It is much cheaper to adjust there vs in LKO or close to Minmus."

If you are trying to rendez-vous with another vessel, you will only have closest approach marker. Generally you will have to sets when your orbit intercept the orbit of your target."
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,slubman,6,Tue May 19 08:43:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand. Don't you mean ""intercept"" ? I was talking about ""intersect"" markers.  Concretely, I'm orbiting Jool and trying to get to Tylo. Set Tylo as target, matched inclination, raised my apo to epsilon above Tylo orbit. My periapsis is much lower. And now I'm trying to synchronize a rendez-vous (get a Tylo ""intercept"") but the ""closest approach"" markers are not much help (they flicker often, and there's only one pair of them, as opposed to ""first intersect""/""second intersect"" that I have seen in the past)."
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,paralogos,6,Tue May 19 08:54:36 2015 UTC,"Your phase angle is off, meaning you will be close to Tylo's orbit while Tylo is somewhere else along its own orbit. I recommend you keep orbiting and watch the two closest approach markers. The Tylo marker will be moving relative to your vessel marker, jumping after each approach, until it ends up slightly behind yours. Then you increase your periapsis, which will increase your orbital period and delay your orbit sufficiently for Tylo to ""catch up"" with you, during the maneuver you will notice the Tylo marker moving closer to yours, until they overlap."
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,snakejawz,2,Tue May 19 11:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yes that's the generic method I am already following. However, my question was more specific than that, and I wanted to have better markers appearing.  Or do you mean ""closest approach"" and ""intersection"" are of the same nature, only the second appears when the distance is smaller ? I doubt that, since I think I have seen very small distances of ""closest approach"", and long distances with ""intersection""."
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,paralogos,3,Tue May 19 11:41:27 2015 UTC,"a ""closest approach"" marker points the targets position when your orbit nears the target's orbit, this only becomes a intersect/intercept when you will be close enough to be influenced by the targets SOI (for planets) or close enough for physics load to occur (for objects)."
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,wcoenen,1 point,Tue May 19 18:12:55 2015 UTC,"The intersect markers appear if your orbit crosses the target orbit. However, they don't tell you anything about where the target will actually be when you reach them, so they are not very helpful."
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,jofwu,3,Tue May 19 11:54:38 2015 UTC,"You can put a maneuver node anywhere on your orbit, right click it, and then click the little + button to move it one or more orbits ahead. As you do this, you will see the closest approach markers shifting; they show the situation after that maneuver node. Find a situation you like and warp to the maneuver node.   Even better for docking or faster encounters, you can put one maneuver node near an intersection point, then a second one elsewhere. Then use the + button on the second one to find a time when the close approach markers get relatively close to the intersection point. Then tune the first maneuver node and you'll see the effect of that N orbits from now."
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,tal2410,1 point,Tue May 19 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, there are no ""intersect"" markers.  Given the immanence of computational error/rounding, I highly doubt the orbits actually intersect in any case. They might get very close at some point. But they won't actually intersect. Zoom in on the place where you think they intersect and move the view around to a different angle. You will be able to tell.  The game does show you where your ascending and descending nodes are, which are the two points on your orbit that happen to lie on the same plane as the other orbit. If you want to know where your orbits are close to intersecting, then look at those nodes. Try to get them as close to the target's orbit as you can."
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,jofwu,1 point,Tue May 19 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, there are no ""intersect"" markers.   Then I'm not sure anymore about different kind of markers ...

What conditions the appearance of several of them ?"
KerbalAcademy,36gx36,jofwu,2,Tue May 19 12:14:31 2015 UTC,"They are ""closest approach"" markers.

KerbalAcademy,36gx36,Tobl4,1 point,Tue May 19 12:59:32 2015 UTC,"The flickering happens when game is having problems determining what the closest approach will be because the imperfections of the simulation are enough to alter which one it'll be.

KerbalAcademy,36gx36,vmerc,1 point,Tue May 19 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the proposition. But I don't have that much trouble getting an encounter ... eventually. It's just that I feel it could be more pleasant, interface-wise.  I think there should be (or there are) 2 modes: when trying to encounter for docking, dealing with handful-meters distances, the ""closest"" between the 2 objects makes sense. But when trying to get an encounter with a planet, dealing with millions of kms, you don't care about this, but want ""the closest point my orbit gets to the target's orbit"" (wherever the 2 objects are at that time).  My problem is that I'm stuck with mode 1 when I would need mode 2 (and I think I remember having experienced mode 2)."
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,apache_alfredo,8,Tue May 19 02:17:19 2015 UTC,That sounds about right.  The generation rate is proportional to the scientist's levels.  You can read more about it on the wiki.  The generation rate was better for my lab that's landed on minmus than it was for my LKO lab.
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Jim3535,7,Tue May 19 02:30:18 2015 UTC,"Science data gets a higher multiplier from the lab depending on the lab's location. If it's landed somewhere (other than Kerbin) you get a big boost, and if it's in orbit somewhere that's a somewhat smaller boost. There's also a bonus for doing analysis in a lab landed/orbiting the same body that the science was collected from."
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Rockleg,1 point,Tue May 19 03:02:20 2015 UTC,"Do you have to have a scientist in the lab to do research or does that just provide a bonus?  Edit: Okay found my answer, yes a scientist must be on board to do research."
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Johnny-Lingo,1 point,Tue May 19 13:22:34 2015 UTC,You also get boosts for being on or in orbit of the body where you got the science.  Ex: Get science from Mun. A landed Mun station will generate more science than a station orbiting Mun than a station somewhere else.
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,w3y,7,Tue May 19 17:13:49 2015 UTC,"I am playing career.  I put a science lab on Minmus. It basically consists of the lab, lander legs, a lander can Mk2 for extra Kerbals, solar panels, a ton of battery storage (enough to keep it running the whole night) and antennas. I had 3 scientists in the lab (lv 2), plus one engineer (in hindsight, should have sent an extra scientist instead of the engineer).  Then I launched an empty science rover to Minmus. The rover had all the experiments I had access to at this point. I landed the rover next to the lab. The lab sits on top of a hill, so it has easy access to basically 3 different biomes. I used one of the scientists and the rover to go through all of them, and take all the experiments back to the lab. I dumped them in, then proceeded to process data, and start the research. I went back to the lab periodically (Kerbal Alarm clock really helps), to empty out the science point storage (transmitting the science points) and process more data to top off the data storage (the closer to max storage, the faster the research goes).  The lab hasn't gone through all the data yet. It's been churning out about 500 science points every ~120 days, and I still have about 400 data left to process and research. I have collected over 12.000 science points from it. I recently finished the tech tree, and adopted the administrative policy that turns science into funds. I get about 50.000 credits(?) every 120 days from that lab.  I love this, since honestly only getting funds from the contracts becomes absurd, because the contracts themselves become absurd (Put a station in orbit of the sun with room for 12 kerbals. WHY???). And not that I'm role-play inclined, but I do enjoy the plausibility of things Think about it. I have labs on other planets, and I can ""rent out"" the research capabilities to Universities and other institutions on Kerbal, who have the need for low-gravity experiment environments, for materials research, biology, chemistry, physics, among other things. Sounds like something that could actually happen.  I put a second lab up there, 100m away from the first one. This one, however, is populated by 4 level 3 scientists. The rate of research is great. Right now, I'm going through the process of further training my original lab crew, to get both labs up to the same rate. Also, I replaced the engineer with a scientist. I did leave a level 3 engineer in a pod close to the labs, because I'm thinking about starting a mining operation soon. Also, I use KAS/KIS, so I have him there in case something goes wrong/needs fixing.  Very soon I will send a science collection hopper there, to replace the rover (which crashed), so that I can not only grab the more advanced data from the visited biomes (gravioly, for example), but also reach more distant biomes, which in Minmus terms is still close enough not to make it an absurdly long journey.  I strongly advise in favor of this approach. Having a research station, especially on Minmus, is a great way to go about collecting science points, and later, funds."
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Deimos_F,1 point,Tue May 19 14:33:09 2015 UTC,Why have 4 scientists in the second base? Can't a science lab only take 2 crew? Or does extra crew help even if they're in a different module? Or are there 2 science labs?
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,KeytarVillain,1 point,Tue May 19 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"The second hypothesis is correct.  Also, never join two labs in one vessel. It neutralizes one of them, properties do not stack.  I have two separate bases, 100m apart, and in each I have one lab and 4 scientists."

KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Deimos_F,1 point,Wed May 20 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"The thing is, it makes little sense to have one in LKO. You want to compound the bonuses, taking the base data value into account.   lab in orbit? bonus lab landed? bigger bonus (except Kerbin) lab processing experimental data taken from the planet you are orbiting/landed at? even bigger bonus   Max bonus is processing data from a planet, on a lab landed on the planet. Then you have to take into account the fact that data value of data collected from/on kerbin is tiny. Then take into account that you would need to bring data from other planets/moons and put it into the lab, which would mean going there, coming back, orbiting Kerbin, rendezvous with the lab. Fuel expenditure goes up, and actual rewards are small due to lack of bonuses.  Just slap it on a rocket and throw it at Minmus or the Mun :D"
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Deimos_F,1 point,Wed May 20 19:38:47 2015 UTC,"This station has close to 350 'data stored'.

So in theory, the data storage is limitless, there is only a limit on how much data is actively being converted into science. In the long term, the actual data a single lab can process can be in the many many thousands. I produced 12000 science points from my first lab alone, and it still has a few thousands data worth of Minmus experiments to go through."

My lab reads:   Science: 0.483/500 Data: 589.045/500 Rate: 3.3399 sci/day   So, will my Data slowly be consumed, to fill the Science pool?

KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Ed__,1 point,Thu May 28 00:25:02 2015 UTC,"Don't you mean yellow button? The experiments can be stored in the lab, there is no maximum amount of experiments that can be stored.  Then, there is room for 500 data points, which you fill up by processing stored experiments (different experiments yield different data amounts).  Then those data points are passively converted into science points (by research), again to a maximum of 500 stored points (when you reach that max you need to transmit the science points). Each stored data point will yield 5 science points, so each ""load"" of 500 data points will in turn produce 2500 science points. The conversion speed depends on the location of the lab, the biome (planet) of the experiments, the number and level of scientists in the station/base, the amount of stored data (closer to 500 cap means faster conversion), and the amount of science points already in storage (closer to maximum means slower conversion).  Think of it like a fireplace: wood pile --> fireplace --> ashes.  The woodpile can be infinite, the fireplace can only take so much wood at a time, the more wood burning at once the stronger the fire, and the more ashes in the fireplace, the harder it is to keep the fire going. So keep a large woodpile, replenish the wood in the fireplace often, and remove the ashes often."

This can either be put into tech, or funds. Assuming you use a high percentage science-for-funds policy, this means 50.000 funds every 100 days, from a single lab."
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Rockleg,4,Thu May 21 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"Can someone fill me in on the best way to handle the science after all the analysis is done? The wiki says stored science must be transmitted rather than landed, but I don't want to risk transmitting the initial experiments back too, since that would hurt their recovery value. Right? Or do the transmission penalties not apply to science transmitted back from a lab?   I've got a lab orbiting Mun and I've done materials, goo, crew reports, EVA reports, surface samples, seismology, pressure, and temperature studies in six or seven different biomes. Once all the analysis is done, is there a way to transmit only the new analysis and not the original experiments?"
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,CraftyCaprid,9,Tue May 19 03:14:38 2015 UTC,"The lab works completely independent of the old science system.  An experiment can be processed in the lab as data, but it does not affect the experiment.  That can still be transmitted or recovered independently.  When the lab turns data into science, the science must be transmitted to use it.  For example, if you do a crew report.  You can click the +data button to load data into the lab, but the crew report is left intact.  You can still transmit or recover that."
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,Rockleg,3,Tue May 19 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"Cool. So if I store an experiment as data, wait for the data to be processed into new science, and then EVA and choose ""take experiments,"" then the new science from processing won't be taken along? That would be easiest, allowing transmission of the new data and physical recovery of the original science."
KerbalAcademy,36fz1r,boom929,6,Tue May 19 03:40:02 2015 UTC,You don't have to wait for the data to be turned into science. You can store as data then immediately remove the experiments and recover them. The data stays in the lab.

Roughly 7.5km is where the basic jet is pushing the hardest.  You need to find the balance between getting enough thrust (in this case, being low enough) and being high enough to avoid excessive drag. To answer your question about the new aero being accurate, it is accurate in so far as some engines just don't work at higher altitudes. That is to say, yes there is less drag, but there is also a ton less thrust.  To give you an example though, I had a plane very similar to your design that was good for 298m/s and that was it's max. We do have maximum operating heights and speeds for aircraft. It may be that your design just isn't capable of doing it.  If all else fails, add another jet engine :D ."

I have a similar three engine plane I built earlier, and that one got me to just a hair over 300 m/s. Why is this tech node called supersonic?! If I can't even get a tiny, useless plane supersonic than what's the point? I'm really frustrated that the turbojet is at the 300 tech level.

KerbalAcademy,369c51,Deimos_F,15,Sun May 17 13:08:06 2015 UTC,Great tutorial and discussion in the forums about mining
KerbalAcademy,369c51,Lycake,10,Sun May 17 13:16:11 2015 UTC,"Under the stock resource model, ore is located in levels of ""concentration"", as opposed to discrete deposits. Mining a specific location forever will not cause its ore supply to run out; however, mining in areas of higher concentration will yield ore more quickly. You wouldn't have to pack your mining operation up unless you wanted to (found a more efficient location, etc.) -- and if you do, ore-specific tanks can be found in the VAB.  Now I've never used KAS or KIS myself (I'm waiting for a more powerful computer), but I've researched them a fair amount in the meantime, and from what I can tell it would be fairly simple to connect a mining vessel to storage tanks, and add a processing vessel, etc.  Doing a ground survey with the orbital module will enable you to bring up an overlay on the planet's/moon's surface showing the concentration values of ore all around the surface. This overlay can be viewed both in map mode (from the active, orbiting vessel) or from the Tracking Station, and can also be configured to only show concentrations above and below specific percentages. I recommend using it to pick out ideal spots for setting up your mining camp.  I'm not sure about the mining rates unfortunately, so I don't know if using two drills at the same spot would be particularly useful. That said, if I'm not mistaken, the Resource Converter converts ore to fuel at the maximum rate a single drill mines it, so unless you're mining a concentration of no more than 50%, having two drills would probably be overkill.  You can man the drill with an engineer -- doing so increases the drill's efficiency. You can also have the engineer put the drill in overdrive; this is the only way I'm aware of to cause the drill to overheat.  As far as a power source, I think the answer depends on where exactly you plan on mining from. If you want to put the site in a polar region, where the sun is almost always at least partially in the sky, solar panels are probably a pretty safe bet. In any other location, fuel cells or RTGs would be the smarter option for perpetual mining. -- RTGs are expensive, but if you want to make sure you're squeezing the mining operation for every last drop, you probably wouldn't want your processed ore going to fuel cells. Unless you're mining a particularly slow area, though, the facility using its own product shouldn't be an issue."
KerbalAcademy,369c51,MastaSchmitty,2,Sun May 17 16:14:50 2015 UTC,You can also have the engineer put the drill in overdrive   How?
KerbalAcademy,369c51,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Sun May 17 20:04:00 2015 UTC,"I admit I'm not entirely sure, but I would think there is an overdrive button when you right-click on the drill, similar to how most other parts work."

KerbalAcademy,369c51,boom929,4,Mon May 18 02:59:41 2015 UTC,With Karbonite/Kethane you could transfer resources using KAS components so I'd assume the new stock resource is the same on that note.   Minmus could be a good location simple because of the ease of getting there and getting fuel into orbit.
KerbalAcademy,369c51,TheNosferatu,1 point,Sun May 17 13:21:13 2015 UTC,"I actually just talked about that in a different thread, though it was about refueling stations and not just mining,   but the basic consensuses was that the Mun was a better spot for mining, because for Minmus you have to a specific time-window for the orbits to line up instead of the Mun (the Mun has a lower inclination) so it's easier to fly towards. The extra gravity on the Mun makes it harder to get the fuel into orbit but you don't have to waste fuel transporting it anywhere."

KerbalAcademy,369fr3,Dave37,7,Sun May 17 13:52:00 2015 UTC,"Getting a low orbit will be slightly more efficient than a direct ascent to escape velocity from the trailing hemisphere.  But, it's not a lot, and if I've got fuel to spare I'll usually launch directly into the transfer burn."
KerbalAcademy,369fr3,RoboRay,6,Sun May 17 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"By using the vis viva equation (or specific orbital energy) it can be shown that you need the same magnitude of velocity at the same altitude in order to obtain a certain escape velocity. However for the direct vertical ascent you will be ""fighting"" the Mun's gravity more and thus use more fuel. Also due to the relative large mass of the Mun compared to the mass of Kerbin the two different methods will also yield different altitudes above Kerbin at which you would leave the SOI of the Mun. This has an effect on the required escape velocity. Namely when transferring from the reference from of the Mun to that of Kerbin you have to add your velocity, relative to the Mun, to the velocity of the point at which you leave the SOI of the Mun. This velocity is equal to the angular velocity, at which the Mun goes around its orbit, times the distance to the center of Kerbin. So leaving the SOI at a lower altitude above Kerbin adds a smaller amount to your velocity relative to Kerbin. This difference in this will be small, but every small amount can help and you asked about the most efficient way.  For example for a craft which has a thrust to weight ratio of the Mun of 10 would need roughly 590 m/s to get into a low, but stable orbit of 7km around the Mun. After this you would have to perform a 274 m/s burn to get a 30km periapsis around Kerbin. So in total 864 m/s. While if you would ascent entirely vertical, straight into an escape trajectory, you have to achieve over 800 m/s in a short time span. At a TWR of 10 you can accelerate at 16.3 m/s2, which would take roughly 50 seconds, during which you are also fighting the Mun's gravity. At the end of the burn you will also have reach an altitude of roughly 20km, in order to be conservative on the gravity ""drag"" I will use the local gravity at that altitude. This results in a required change in velocity of 892 m/s, which is an increase of 28 m/s or 3%."
KerbalAcademy,369fr3,fibonatic,1 point,Sun May 17 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"Vis-viva equation:       In astrodynamics, the vis-viva equation, also referred to as orbital-energy-invariance law, is one of the equations that model the motion of orbiting bodies. It is the direct result of the law of conservation of energy, which requires that the sum of kinetic and potential energy is constant at all points along the orbit.  Vis viva (Latin for ""live force"") is a term from the history of mechanics, and it survives in this sole context. It represents the principle that the difference between the aggregate work of the accelerating forces of a system and that of the retarding forces is equal to one half the vis viva accumulated or lost in the system while the work is being done.

The short version: going into an orbit is better (accelerating perpendicular to the Mun's gravity means you expend less delta-v fighting it).  For the longer version refer to this comment tree. It's rather long, but contains concrete examples with numbers, pictures and everything. I did my best to explain it in detail why this is the case. I do hope this helps!"

KerbalAcademy,369fr3,WonkyFloss,3,Mon May 18 05:39:24 2015 UTC,"I would still get into orbit. Your orbital burns will still help reduce velocity relative to Kerbin since it will be part of your escape energy anyway. So even though you aren't burning straight up the moon will pull your vector around (it's an orbit afterall).  When you burn straight up, you are constantly getting a mun slingshot because it is trying to pull you back down. When you burn towards the horizon you don't have these gravity losses, but you are still adding most efficiently to your orbital energy by burning prograde. For the same reason, it's why we get in orbit around Kerbin before going to duna rather than just time it when kerbin is facing the right way.  That's my thought."
KerbalAcademy,369fr3,seedmole,3,Sun May 17 18:00:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's good to fire at a 90 degree angle relative to the pull of gravity, since that means the resulting forces aren't being cancelled out. If you're firing upward, the total force is the force of your engines minus the force of gravity. If you're firing horizontally, the total force is the hypotenuse of the triangle made by the force vectors, so it's sqroot(engine force2 + force of gravity2).  That means you will accelerate more quickly, meaning escape velocity can be reached more quickly."
KerbalAcademy,369fr3,horzza,2,Sun May 17 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"Consider the two cases of launching straight up, from the both the twin craters, and the trailing side of the mun: From the trailing side, fuel spent to leave the sphere of influence of the Mun is also fuel spent toward decreasing your orbital velocity, whereas when you launch straight up from the twin craters, you retain your orbital velocity when you leave the Mun's sphere of influence. So I think the answer is to launch as low as you can, then just do a Kerbin de-orbit burn. There's probably a better way though!  Edit: Confused about two things: Twin craters are on trailing-side, and not the farside crater, as well as this just being incorrect even with that taken into account. Orbiting in the same direction of the Mun's orbit around Kerbin, and then escaping the Mun, seems like the way to go!"
KerbalAcademy,369fr3,zettabyte,2,Sun May 17 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? The craters are located on the trailing side of the Mun. Obviously I wouldn't eject from LMuO when I'm above the twin craters, then I would get a higher orbit when leaving the Mun's SOI. I'm asking if you should get into orbit first, wait (roughly) half a orbit and then eject or if you should just launch straight up in direct opposite to the Mun's direction."

Start with the Mk2 parts and build a Mk2 shuttle before you attempt a Mk3.

Hook your engines and external tank up, then play with fuel levels to see what happens to your torque as the fuel level changes.

Most people use liquid fuel booster for simplicity."
KerbalAcademy,366ahg,Leav,8,Sat May 16 15:51:58 2015 UTC,"I suspect that neither of these have been updated for the new aero, largely due to the fact that I think that the answer to #1 is yes.  I stick with a TWR of under 1.7 at all times while under 20km altitude or so, the rocket goes up quickly enough and I don't even get shock effects, let alone heating, keeping my rockets at least somewhat controllable."
KerbalAcademy,366ahg,Eric_S,2,Sat May 16 17:03:54 2015 UTC,Kerbel Engineer claims to have been updated to the new aerodynamics model:  See version 1.0.16.0 notes  Thanks for the info on the way you launch. i'll try it out.
KerbalAcademy,366ahg,cranp,3,Sat May 16 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"Whatever the optimal TWR is, it has to be something above 2.  If the atmosphere were infinite and uniform it would be exactly 2 so that you maintain terminal velocity, but because it is thinning as you ascend you need something greater than 2 in order to keep up with the increasing terminal velocity."
KerbalAcademy,366ahg,Eric_S,5,Sat May 16 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, if the actual launch efficiency is all you care about, then the TWR will be above 2.  It was already 2.2 and increasing with the old atmosphere, and the new thinner atmosphere means that you can push even faster, further reducing gravity losses.  On the other hand, the higher your TWR, the more aggressive your gravity turn has to be, which means it becomes more important that your craft be aerodynamically stable."
KerbalAcademy,366ahg,space_is_hard,4,Sat May 16 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"Whatever the optimal TWR is, it has to be something above 2   The problem with this is twofold:   Atmospheric heating is a thing now, which means that high velocities early on can damage your ship Kerbin's small radius means that a high TWR first stage can throw you up too high too quickly, leaving a long coast between first stage shutdown and second stage activation. In addition, too much initial vertical velocity combined with the inability to deviate far from prograde can prevent you from efficiently reaching lower orbit altitudes without having to accept massive cosine losses from having to incorporate significant amounts of anti-radial velocity. This is a huge waste since you're essentially cancelling out all of your upwards burn with a downwards burn just to keep your apoapsis from shooting out of the planet's SOI."
KerbalAcademy,366ahg,wooq,2,Sun May 17 00:23:29 2015 UTC,"As you fly up through the atmosphere, there is an ideally efficient speed to be going, where you are accelerating as fast as you can without incurring too much loss from drag.  People did the math on this with the old aerodynamics and, completely coincidentally, the optimum speed was identical to terminal velocity.  This is no longer the case in the 1.x aerodynamic model for many reasons, one of which you touched upon (drag is no longer static per vessel, but is calculated from the vessel's shape and orientation).  Terminal velocity is still terminal velocity, but it is no longer the ideal speed to go for maximum efficiency.  I don't know if anyone has calculated a new ""ideal speed,"" but it may in fact be fast enough to create supersonic shock effects (in real life, rockets go supersonic)"
KerbalAcademy,366v0u,SixInchesAtATime,1 point,Sat May 16 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on the skybox you are using.  The default doesn't have a crazy amount of stars, but some of the alternates (via mods) do."
KerbalAcademy,366v0u,krenshala,1 point,Sat May 16 19:17:33 2015 UTC,Well the default skybox (new to that term) had a galaxial plane and a good amount of stars to start with.  Shouldn't I at least be able to see that when I'm behind the Mun?
KerbalAcademy,36652p,imbobbathefett,5,Sat May 16 14:58:28 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Disregard most of that. Suicide burns are an efficient way of landing, but apparently, [constant altitude landings are more efficient.]   Thanks to /u/SenorPuff for pointing that out. The math behind it's here.  The most efficient way is to skip circularizing your orbit and get straight on an impact path with the body, then perform a suicide burn (see edit), where you do the entire burn (killing both horizontal and vertical momentum) at the last possible moment you can to minimize the accelerating effects of gravity. You want to hit 0 m/s basically at the same time you hit the surface.  It's definitely the most efficient way, but it's tough to pull off right and it takes a good feel for the ship to pull off (unless you use something like Mechjeb, which lands like this automatically). Realistically, you'll want to quicksave and practice a few times, and you'll probably end up killing your velocity just above the surface rather than right on top of it. Still, you want to kill off your momentum as late as possible because gravity will cause your ship to further accelerate, requiring more fuel to stop it.  This thread explains a bit better why it's the best method of landing.  Honestly, though, on small bodies like the Mun or Minmus, it's usually not going to make a HUGE difference. It's the bigger ones that give you trouble."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,noplzstop,4,Sat May 16 15:07:52 2015 UTC,"Mentioned in your thread(albeit near the bottom), direct descent suicide burns are NOT the most efficient method of landing. Constant altitude landings are."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,SenorPuff,4,Sat May 16 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's news to me, I've never heard of that technique before but it makes a lot of sense. I stand extremely corrected, time to edit my comment now. Thanks for the info! Now I have to try this..."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,noplzstop,4,Sat May 16 18:26:52 2015 UTC,Hey no problem. You took it better than some people who refuse to believe me even when I link a lot of the math. tavert over on the KSP forums did a great job of proving it.
KerbalAcademy,36652p,SenorPuff,3,Sat May 16 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm surprised this isn't more common knowledge at this point being that the math backs it up. Is it any harder than a suicide burn? Just trying to figure out why I haven't heard of it before today...  I mean, it is pretty counter-intuitive, but then again, so are a lot of things you have to do in KSP at first."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,noplzstop,6,Sat May 16 18:45:29 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not easy, but it's actually safer than a vertical decent suicide burn since you can direct your thrust such that you avoid obstacles. In a vertical descent if you mistime it, you're going to crash.   It makes a bit more sense when you consider the following: by descending, you increase your speed, thereby increasing the velocity you must kill in order to stop. If you descend vertically, you essentially are fighting gravity losses for the entirety of the burn, instead of fighting just the gravity losses that you need to to stay up long enough to not crash. And finally, you lose out on Oberth Effect gains by landing vertically, as you start the burn higher and slower, rather than burning at periapsis just above the surface when your speed is highest.  The biggest con is how difficult it is to pick a landing spot with this method. With a vertical decent you pretty much are going to hit where you put the trajectory. It takes practice with this method to get the braking time down. You can, of course, calculate it, which would give you very good numbers."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,SenorPuff,1 point,Sat May 16 18:57:33 2015 UTC,"Awesome explanation, thanks, I'm thinking I might have to try this out some time soon."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,noplzstop,2,Sat May 16 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"So, if I understand this ""constant altitude landing"" correctly, basically it's instead of aiming to hit the ground, you aim for an extremely low orbit, kill your horizontal velocity so you circularize. At this point you have no vertical velocity so you can wait until you are at the point you wanna be, kill the rest of your horizontal velocity and let yourself fall down gently (probably adjust when getting even closer to the surface)"
KerbalAcademy,36652p,TheNosferatu,3,Tue May 19 13:03:08 2015 UTC,"awesome, i appreciate your answer."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,Perseus33,3,Sat May 16 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"Just remember that that particular video was shot before they re-modelled the Mun surface.  It's difficult to make an approach quite that low now, because the surface is a lot bumpier, and there is a real risk of flying in to the side of a hill if you try and hold a constant altitude that is too close to the surface."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,Eric_S,1 point,Sun May 17 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's only true if you're already on an impact trajectory.  If you're not, then lowering to a periapsis just above the surface, retro burning to start killing your velocity and transitioning to a suicide burn is going to be more efficient than killing most of your horizontal velocity then suicide burning."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,SenorPuff,1 point,Sat May 16 17:09:50 2015 UTC,Even if you are already on an impact trajectory it is more efficient to do a constant altitude landing. This was discussed in depth in this thread on the KSP forums.
KerbalAcademy,36652p,Eric_S,1 point,Sat May 16 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"In the general case, this is true, but at some point you reach the point where transitioning from an impact trajectory to a skimming one takes more delta-v than the constant altitude landing approach would save. I say this as a long time proponent of constant altitude landing, I just didn't want to get into that argument yet again, I'm glad someone else took the time to explain it."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,SenorPuff,1 point,Sat May 16 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"True, but that point is pretty far into the descent. If you're aiming a flyby, using the miniscule amount of dV to adjust it to be a low peri flyover rather than an impact is relatively negligible. You have to be pretty far in the gravity well for a CAL to not be worth the setup."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,Eric_S,2,Sat May 16 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, it's just that when we get into arguments over this, it always comes down to people that either think in terms of having already committed to the impact trajectory or those that think the steering losses of of the constant altitude landing method are going to be greater than the extra gravity losses of the suicide burn.  Personally, even if it's hilly terrain, I'll do something approximating the constant altitude landing method at hilltop level until I'm firmly committed to an impact trajectory at which point I'll suicide burn the rest, because that's what it's good at.  I've been doing that since just about the time Kosmo-not did his video.  You'll even find me turning up in the threads discussing it before it was mathematically proven to be better (I think, it's been so long I'm not sure about the timing)."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,SenorPuff,1 point,Sat May 16 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"Same. The real world isn't perfect, so once you've done the best you can woke staying safe, you go in for the kill with what gets you what you need.   As always though, prior planning will work wonders, if you're willing to do the math."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,Dave37,2,Sat May 16 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"If you lander has a very low TWR, close to 1 or even below, you should land as you describe. Come in at an extremely shallow angle and kill of your horizontal velocity.  Although it's possible to safely land a ship with a TWR lower than 1, it's not recommended out of several reasons. Mainly hills, and returns."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,SenorPuff,2,Sat May 16 15:24:48 2015 UTC,"Direct descent suicide burns, where you approach vertically, are NOT the most efficient form of landing. The most efficient form of landing is the constant altitude landing. This method of landing is what NASA used to land on the Moon.  Here is the thread talking about the mathematics of why this is truly the most efficient form of landing."
KerbalAcademy,36652p,VirogenicFawn21,1 point,Sat May 16 18:18:19 2015 UTC,Can you explain what exactly you're doing in the video?
KerbalAcademy,36652p,SenorPuff,1 point,Sat May 16 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"It's not me, but you have two phases, the braking phase, where your throttle controls your horizontal braking force and the pitch controls vertical descent, and then the approach phase, where the throttle controls vertical descent and the pitch controls horizontal speed.   You set this up by setting a low periapsis and burning at that point. Initially you will be burning retrograde, to circularize. Once you commit to a landing, you will burn mostly retrograde, but since your periapsis is low you burn slightly vertically to arrest the descent to maintain altitude and not crash. This essentially means your entire burn takes advantage of the Oberth effect, even though you to have some steering losses.   Once you've killed most of your horizontal velocity, you enter the approach phase. It's almost a smooth transition, maybe a slight pitch over maneuver, where the throttle is now being used to control your final vertical descent, but as you still have some horizontal velocity you are not straight vertical but pitched slightly to arrest your horizontal velocity.   You come to a stop as you touch down. So you need a TWR of greater than 1 on touchdown to not crash (technically I think 0.95 may be enough for a hard landing)."

The 'k' in km means 1000, so you can just exchange it for 1000 if you're changing units. 2000 m is not equal to ((2000 m)/1000) km.  Dimensional analysis is a very powerful tool even though wikipedia make it slightly more complicated than it is. But basically, keep track of units and treat them just as you would treat a number. You can multiply, divide them as to make them cancel etc. And the prefixes are equal to numbers. k = 103, M = 106, G = 109 etc."

Then set a burn using the vertical controllers either up or down that will adjust your orbit in the direction you want it to change.    You might have to make several burns at each node to get it right without screwing up your current orbit.

As far as the inclination change, I think the most efficient maneuver in your case is  to burn antinormal at apoapsis.  Using the maneuver node, it'll tell you how long you should burn until your inclination flattens out.  I hope that helps, I'm still a relative newbie as well."
KerbalAcademy,363a6f,Salanmander,16,Fri May 15 19:53:16 2015 UTC,"Do you mean ascending node instead of apoapsis? The apoapsis is far outside the plane the OP wants.  To the OP: The general rule of thumb is to always burn at the part of your orbit that you want to stay in the same place, because you can't move the part of your orbit where you are when you burn. In the case of an inclination change, that's at the ascending node or descending node: the point where the plane of your orbit crosses the plane of their orbit."
KerbalAcademy,363a6f,bobbertmiller,1 point,Fri May 15 20:13:51 2015 UTC,Wow. That makes a lot more sense now. Thank you so much.
KerbalAcademy,363a6f,shakefu,2,Fri May 15 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"That is really solid advise for a lot of things. Want to rendezvous with a craft? Make sure your orbits intersect at a point, at that point you can burn prograde/retrograde to make your orbit take more or less time while STILL having one point where you can meet the other craft. [Mabye after several orbits - don't overdo that kind of thing ^^] Both apoapsis and periapsis are wrong but you have an intersection? Burn radial+- to move both at the same time while keeping the intersect point correct. It's really cool what you can do with orbits once you get a hang of what burning in a direction does. You could bring something to orbit and just experiment with cheated unlimited fuel and see what happens."
KerbalAcademy,363a6f,wartornhero,3,Sat May 16 09:44:12 2015 UTC,As a fellow noob the Scott Manley career mode videos were insanely helpful.
KerbalAcademy,363a6f,LatPotato,1 point,Fri May 15 23:14:21 2015 UTC,I have been playing since 2011. I find Scott Manley videos really helpful.
KerbalAcademy,363a6f,WazWaz,1 point,Fri May 15 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"I play since early stages of KSP and I really appreciate those people, who actually make videos with a lot of science in it, not just those like ""haha, lets crash this derp ship, lolololo"". I think that there are so few people who really put effort in describing the life basis in game (the gravity, aerodynamics, etc). Scott is one of those and he is really great in what he does!"
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,d0gmeat,9,Fri May 15 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"My procedure usually goes like this:  1) Launch (or enter SOI) as close to the desired orbital inclination as possible. 2) Get into stable orbit. Circular helps, but isn't super important. 3) Match orbital inclination at ascending or descending node. 4) Burn somewhere until the other side of your orbit just barely touches the desired orbit. 5) Burn at point where they touch until your orbit matches desired orbit. A maneuver node helps immensely with this, because the burn might have prograde/retrograde and radial components."
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,Salanmander,7,Fri May 15 14:45:59 2015 UTC,I want to add that you want to raise your apoapsis first before matching inclinations. This will make the maneuver more efficient.
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,w3y,5,Fri May 15 20:25:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Anything pro/retrograde you want to do at maximum speed, anything normal or radial you want to do at minimal speed."

KerbalAcademy,3629wn,Salanmander,6,Fri May 15 20:29:19 2015 UTC,Scott Manley just put out this video of him completing a polar orbit contract.
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,fakeplastic,2,Fri May 15 19:48:13 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks.  That's incredibly helpful.  I suppose I did actually have an AN and a DN on the target orbit, I just didn't notice it because it looked a little different than it does when you're trying to match a target and you get the lines between the two."
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,marco262,5,Sat May 16 20:34:16 2015 UTC,"In short, my method is:   Change my orbit so that it intercepts the target orbit. This usually involves raising my apoapsis until it meets the ascending or descending now of the target orbit.  At the intersection, create a maneuver node and adjust to match the target orbit.    I have yet to find an orbit that I can't match as long as I can intercept it. The key is learning how to use all three axes on the maneuver node well. Prograde/retrograde will grow/shrink the size of your orbit. Radial/anti-radial will change your inclination at the node. Normal/anti-normal will ""pivot"" your orbit around the node within the orbital plane.   To match a polar orbit, you'll want to make heavy use of the *radial axes. Note that as you change the inclination of your orbit, the *radial and *grade controls will almost switch functions at the maneuvernode. At near 90 degrees, *grade will change your inclination and *radial will grow/shrink your orbit. So keep an eye out for that. The trick is to just mess around with the controls until you get a good feel for them. Remember, messing around with maneuver nodes is free, and zero-risk. If you screw up, you can delete the node and start over.   The above may not be the most efficient way to match a target orbit, but my satellites usually have loads of delta-V to spare, so I haven't run into any issues.   Male sure to pick up PreciseNode to help with adjusting your maneuver nodes. It's a required part of my playstyle now."
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,Salanmander,2,Fri May 15 15:14:35 2015 UTC,"I have yet to find an orbit that I can't match as long as I can intercept it.   Fun fact: it is provably always possible to match an orbit using a single burn at a point where you intercept said orbit. Of course, the dV requirements might be huge, but as you noted, little satellites usually don't hurt for dV."
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,difool,4,Fri May 15 20:25:07 2015 UTC,"First be sure to look at the rotation direction of the target orbit.  If you have the delta V, try to launch directly in the target.  For a polar orbit it should be 0 or 180 depending of the rotation of the target.  If you have to change inclination after launch, always do it in the slowest speed of your current orbit which would be the apoapsis and burn toward the ascending or descending node (red up and down arrows on the nav ball).  Finally, if you have big inclination changes to do, try to either augment your apoapsis before by burning at your periapsis or do it in multiples burns and check / correct your orbits after each burn because sometimes your periapsis could go into the atmosphere.  In that case you can also burn normal / antinormal (blue targets on nav ball) to rotate the orbit (like a hula loop)"
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,fibonatic,3,Fri May 15 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that it would be nice to be able to target a target-orbit, such that the ascending and descending nodes would appear on your own orbit instead of on the target-orbit.  But here is how I do try to find the ascending or descending node. I align the camera in map mode such that the ascending and descending nodes overlap and then I place a maneuver node on my own orbit at the point of overlap. Note that it is more efficient to place it on the point of your orbit which has the highest altitude. Sometime it is even worth the extend your orbit on the other side, such that you increase your highest altitude at the ascending/descending node."
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,flinxsl,1 point,Fri May 15 14:45:24 2015 UTC,"Yea, I missed the ascending and descending nodes since they weren't in their usual spot."
KerbalAcademy,3629wn,davidg75,1 point,Sat May 16 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"For the polar orbit, you probably want to have a dedicated launch for that satellite.  Time warp until KSC is right underneath the orbit, then launch going north/south."

KerbalAcademy,362h7u,kairon156,9,Fri May 15 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"Side note: it's actually not that the pod is heavy that's a problem. It's a little counterintuitive, but for a rocket flying through atmosphere to be stable, you want it to be top-heavy, not bottom-heavy."
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,Salanmander,5,Fri May 15 16:12:41 2015 UTC,I did some reading and I understand that this is how it works but not really sure on the why.
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,encaseme,8,Fri May 15 16:29:02 2015 UTC,"Find a ruler, and tape a weight (couple AA batteries or something) near one end of it. Try to balance the ruler standing on end in your hand, once with the weight closer to your hand, and once with the weight farther from your hand. Much easier to balance with the weight further away, same with rockets (or anything)."
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,Salanmander,-1,Fri May 15 17:00:56 2015 UTC,"This isn't really a helpful way of thinking about it, because the thing is in contact with your hand, and that contact force is not like any of the forces you get when something is flying through the air.  Batter to take that apparatus and throw it. Notice that the ruler tends to stream out behind the weight. That's because when flying through the air, the drag tends to pull the things with more drag and less mass backwards relative to the center of mass."
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,encaseme,9,Fri May 15 19:00:11 2015 UTC,"I would disagree and say the forces are similar. My hand is pushing upward like the engine, and my hand can translate forward/backward/sides, like the fins or engine gimbal make the bottom of the rocket do."
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,Salanmander,3,Fri May 15 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is that your hand is fixing the location, while the rocket is fixing the force. Notably, having four points of contact at the base of your model rocket, and a wide, low center-of-mass base will make your model stable, but it won't make a rocket in flight any more stable than a single rocket would be.  Using an analogy between every-day contact forces and rocket forces is what led Goddard to the wrong conclusion that a rocket with engines at the top would be stable.  In the case of your top-heavy pendulum, the reason that it's easier to stabilize is that the pivot point is your hand, and so with mass further away it has larger angular inertia. This has nothing to do with aerodynamics, because there isn't significant air resistance. A rocket, on the other hand, will rotate around its center of mass, because there's nothing keeping the base of it from moving sideways, so top-heavy vs. bottom-heavy doesn't change the angular inertia. The reason a top-heavy rocket is stable has everything to do with aerodynamics, which is why we never noticed it until KSP made a more accurate aerodynamics model."
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,encaseme,2,Fri May 15 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"I did specifically mention avoiding a large contact area because of course that is going to be stable. It was an analogy only and one that readily illustrated the point while avoiding the shortcomings you mentioned (though I had skirted around them for brevity, should've mentioned them)"
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,Salanmander,3,Fri May 15 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that even with a single point of contact, a rocket does not act like an inverted pendulum. The reasons for having more mass at the top making it stable are completely different in the two cases, which means that that analogy doesn't actually help you understand why top-heavy rockets are more stable."
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,ElectroNeutrino,1 point,Fri May 15 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"I actually think it's a combination of both, at least with rockets. The COP behind the COM will help keep it stable because the drag will tend to push where the COP is, while it rotates around the COM. However, I also think that the extra torque provided by the longer lever arm from thrusters to COM helps the engines keep it right way around."
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,Salanmander,1 point,Sat May 16 01:29:52 2015 UTC,That part does make sense...engines further from COM means your control inputs will do more.
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,TheSkoomaCat,1 point,Sat May 16 02:24:31 2015 UTC,"I think I have an understanding of what's going on here, but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  Imagine the Center of Mass (CoM) is like a pivot point.  The closer the pivot point is to the top of the craft, the less work your fins and engine (if it has gimbal) have to do to keep it steady.  IE, the entire rocket is acting somewhat like a lever with the CoM as the hinge.  The longer the ""lever"" is (the further up the CoM is), the greater the force being exerted radial by fins and engine are.  Now remember, your rocket isn't just pushing itself up through nothing; you are fighting drag from the air as well.  The reason leverage is important here is because if the CoM is closer to the bottom of the rocket, closer to the engine, the amount of leverage that the drag force has is much greater which can (and will, as you've seen) cause the rocket to flip mid-air.  Hope that helps!"
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,Eric_S,6,Fri May 15 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"Also note that any tendancy to flip gets magnified when you go transsonic, so ascending with too much thrust early on can make this problem worse.  I usually try to keep my TWR under 1.7 until I'm above 15km altitude or so."
KerbalAcademy,362h7u,FellKnight,4,Fri May 15 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"this will be very helpful, thanks. only thing is there's no speed control when using solid fuel rockets."

KerbalAcademy,361du1,killing1sbadong,1 point,Fri May 15 15:25:11 2015 UTC,"Assuming they have identical orbital periods and therefore no orbital drift relative to each other, you only need one with a connection to the polar orbiting satellite.   My favorite setup is 3 keosynchronous satellites and 2 highly elliptical polar orbiters; with one polar sat you will have uptime of 99+%, so you can definitely get away with just that. The polar sat(s) then have the necessary antennae to act as relays to the moons and other planetary bodies.   Each keosynch sat should have an omni to connect to nearby ships and directional to the other keosynch sats. The one or two over KSC should connect there, and one should connect to each polar satellite.   More helpful tips here"

KerbalAcademy,361du1,killing1sbadong,1 point,Fri May 15 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"Two more tips to help you along-   Launch all 3/4 geosynchronous satellites in one launch. Connect them all via stack separators (make sure to have an engine on each for fixing the orbits). Raise the apoapsis to geosynch, then adjust the orbital period to 4 hours for 3 satellites or 4.5 hours for 4 satellites (easiest to use KER mod). Then each pass by the apoapsis, detach the next satellite and adjust the orbit. If done properly, you can get all the satellites up and out of phase with minimal effort. If you want to make sure the satellites don't drift, you can go into the persistence file and make sure they all have the exact same SMA (semi-major axis). Some consider it cheating, but I figure once in orbit, another part of the space program would take care of keeping them there. Otherwise even 0.1 and 0.01 difference in SMA can cause significant drift over a few years in game."

KerbalAcademy,35yrup,fuccimama79,1 point,Thu May 14 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"Mostly because I start to stall out if I try to make it beyond 18k. It's a weird balancing act with turbos/RAPIERs. Aiming around 35 or 40 degrees with the initial climb, I start to lose too much thrust to avoid a stall somewhere in the 15K range, both because of the reduced atmosphere and loss of horizontal velocity in the climb.  Edit: And I should point out that the bizarre yaw forces seem to strike in the 18k+ range sometimes too."

KerbalAcademy,35yrup,davidg75,2,Sat May 16 00:21:12 2015 UTC,for me - it seems to be center of mass (COM) vs center of lift (COL) if these two are too far apart you can really lose control of your vessel especially in thick atomospheric conditions...  a few degrees in any direction puts massive torque in my vessel.  the best course of action is stability fins (the best are the ones that have control) - that lets me counter the forces of pivot across the COM vs COL divide.

KerbalAcademy,35wtv1,jofwu,2,Thu May 14 12:23:56 2015 UTC,"Ejection angle you can easily do by eye. Make a guess node on the day side of the planet (for going to inner planets) or the night side (for outer planets). Ensure the burn is enough to roughly meet the target orbit. Now zoom back in and observe the ejection angle. Drag the node around until the trajectory is in line with the start planet's orbit. Adjust the burn to again touch the target orbit. Repeat until good enough. Add a second node at DN/AN for plane change, and tweak (no normal, but a little radial sometimes) the first one until you get an intercept.  My process is to launch to low orbit, set an alarm in KAC for the phase, then eyeball the ejection angle. Works every time, and if you're doing lots of missions in parallel, you need KAC anyway."
KerbalAcademy,35wtv1,WazWaz,1 point,Thu May 14 12:57:05 2015 UTC,"Orbital period is T=2*pi*sqrt(a3/GM). But the key thing is just the proportionality, we can forget about everything else. So  T~sqrt(a3) or T~a3/2.  Let's assume a clean Hohmann transfer where you intercept the other planet 180 degrees away from the point where you leave. It gets slightly more complicated if you have something different but the idea is the same still. And let's say the semi-major axis of your origin planet is a1 and for destination it's a2. And let's assume the orbits are reasonable close to circular, again it gets more complicated if they're not.  The semi-major axis of the transfer orbit will be (a1+a2)/2. So the orbital period for the transfer orbit is proportional to ((a1+a2)/2)3/2. But your transfer is really only half of an ellipse so we divided that by two.  Then we can calculate how many orbits, or what fraction of a whole orbit, the target body does during your transfer orbit. Just divide the transfer orbit time with the orbital period of the target body.  { ((a1+a2)/2)3/2 / 2} / { a23/2 }  After you simplify that a bit you get (a1/a2+1)3/2 / (4*sqrt(2))  That's how many orbits the target body does during your transfer trajectory. Then the target body just needs to be that much behind the intended intercept point when you do your transfer burn.  For example, semi-major axis for Kerbin is 13.6*109 m and for Duna 20.7*109 m. We can just drop the exponents and units and treat these as 13.6 and 20.7 since we're only interested in the proportion anyway. So we have (13.6/20.7+1)3/2/(4*sqrt(2)). If I plug that into google I get 0.377. So Duna should be 0.377 orbits behind the intercept point. To get that in degrees, just multiply by 360 and you get 135.74.  Compare this to what the calculator says, phase angle should be 44.36 degrees. So the angle between the intercept point and where Duna should be is 180-44.36=135.64, which is the same to the accuracy of our initial semi-major axis values."

The easiest, if you have it unlocked, is to add the Reflectron DP-10 to your craft. It's a short range omnidirectional antenna that starts out with an active connection to KSC. It's found in the flight control node of the tech tree. If you don't have that yet, you can also use the launch stability enhancers as a hard line connection to activate them before takeoff, just make sure your antenna isn't going to break off during your ascent. And finally, you can send up a Kerbal with your probe to activate it manually. Just make sure to provide them with a way to get back to land. Or don't, that's up to you, really."

As for not even connecting on the launch pad, what sort of antenna is on the craft?

KerbalAcademy,35x1by,RumAndCookies,1 point,Thu May 14 06:21:46 2015 UTC,"You need have a way of controlling your craft from the get go.   One option is to deliver the satellites with vessel piloted by a kerbal. Reach the intended orbit, deploy antennas/panels, separate, and return.   The other option is to have a DP-10 on the vessel, this will provide a means of communication until you can deploy other antennas. The DP-10 starts active, and is nearly indestructible, but has a range of only 500km meaning you will likely need another antenna for use on orbit. Most (all) other antenna's will break if activated before reaching the upper atmosphere. Getting the first couple of satellites to orbit without having Jeb deliver them can be a little tricky as you need to achieve a stable orbit within line of site of the KSC, or figure out the flight computer and schedule a burn for the appropriate time. (more than one initial comms sat has ended in a ground or ocean-synchronous ""orbit"" when it lost contact after falling below the horizon)   I generally start my constellations with a single sat placed in a synchronous orbit over the KSC with a DP-10,  a Communitron-32 , and a few deployable solar panels. I also tie the deployment of the Comm-32 and panels to action group 1. Once I've hit 70km I hit 1 and setup the next burn to stabilize the parking orbit.

As you approach, burn retrograde (again make sure you are in target mode!) until your relative velocity is near 0m/s.  Now both ships are moving at roughly the same speed, and in roughly the same orbit.  EVA your kerbal and move him over to the other ship.  Carry on as normal.

I can try and help if there's something you don't understand here. You definitely can't just throw parts together and make it fly in FAR.  Did you try turning SAS off? It doesn't work well with FAR sometimes. It tends to overcompensate and make your plane unstable. Using the flight assistance buttons instead, on the FAR window, might help."

KerbalAcademy,35t9ip,nikidash,6,Wed May 13 12:19:03 2015 UTC,"The wiki on github is a good place to start, though it's not as helpful as it should be.  The static checks are pretty straight forward. You can choose a certain speed (mach) and ""sweep Angle of Attack"" (set angle of attack on the x-axis of the chart) or you can choose a certain AoA and ""sweep Mach"" (set mach/speed on the x-axis of the chart). So you might say, ""How does my plane handle high, sub-sonic speeds?"" Choose ""sweep AoA"" and set Mach to something like 0.8. The chart shows how your plane does for a range of AoA values at Mach 0.80 (~275 m/s at sea level).  You want Cm to always be negative have a negative slope, when you look at the AoA sweep! Below the x-axis. It should always trend down as AoA gets larger. Otherwise your craft will be very flip-happy. It has to do with the plane's pitching moment. Positive slope means the ship wants to flip. Negative slope means it wants to be stable.  The Cl line corresponds to how much lift your plane gets (aerodynamic force pushing you up). The taller it is, the better your plane is at getting some air. If it drops off very sharply at a certain AoA/mach value, then take warning! If you approach that threshold, do it carefully.  Cd corresponds to drag (aerodynamic force slowing you down). Higher Cd values just means your plane isn't super efficient. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. L/D is the ratio of Cl to Cd. Just another measure of efficiency.  Do you understand the concept of static and dynamic stability? The wiki page on ""Overview of Stability"" is good with this I think. When your plane is flying through the air it naturally gets pushed around and isn't always moving perfectly prograde with no roll. You want dynamic stability so that if you make a turn or something, you will snap back into a stable, smooth flight afterwards. This chart is a nice visual. It shows angle of attack (or pitch) over time. The first one shows that if you point your nose up a bit and let go, it will move back to equilibrium. The third one shows that if you point your nose up a bit and then let go, it will start to swing up and down more violently each time (until the plane stalls or falls apart). The stability derivatives tab basically tells you how your plane will behave (the good way or the bad way) at certain altitudes and speeds. If the numbers are green, you're looking good. Red means you will have to use SAS (constant control) to hold the thing steady in some respect- that is, if it's even manageable at all. White means that certain criteria isn't critical- don't worry about those. Make sense?   Learning how to turn red numbers green is the real trick! The wiki might offer some help. If you have a hard time understanding what it means, first I would just try to play around with things and see if you can get lucky. :) Then I would post a picture of your craft, a picture of the stability derivatives, and any other info that might be helpful. People will be glad to offer specific advice.  Make sure you check things out at different speeds and altitudes!  If you want a plane that goes supersonic (which is likely) then you also want to look at the transonic tab, and enable the green/yellow curves. (I forget what the button says... maybe something about area rule?) The green line measures the cross-sectional area of your ship at each point along its length. The yellow is the 2nd derivative of the green line, or a measure of how curvy the green line is. Where the green line is smooth, the yellow line will be low. Where the green line curvy, the yellow line will be high. Your plane will be much better with going into supersonic speeds if the yellow line is as close to zero as possible. To make that happen you want to smoothen out the green line as much as possible. No sudden changes in the cross-sectional area of your ship.  Hopefully that will get you started... Let me know if there's something specific. Let me know if I need to slow down and explain something more clearly or simply. Or post your ship and some data if you want specific advice on problems you're having!  Edits in italics per ferram's comment"

Cm needs to decrease with angle of attack (read: slope downward, dCm/dAoA < 0) for stability.  If Cm is negative, but it's sloping up, you're still gonna have a bad time."

KerbalAcademy,35r81p,apache_alfredo,7,Tue May 12 21:07:31 2015 UTC,"The main difference is whether you're going to be orbiting prograde or retrograde when you finally circularize.  You should adjust your orbit so that you'll be coming in on the inclination you'd like to remain in while you're there.  Don't sweat this one too much, though, since you can really easily change that en route. I always shoot out in an equatorial inclination to around where minmus is going to be (although obviously below/above unless I'm really lucky) and then burn normal/antinormal after I'm about 15-30 minutes out from the primary burn.  This normally limits my inclination adjustment to around 30m/s of change.  You end up with some wonky insertion orbits, but it's minmus so those are really cheap to change. You've got the gist of it.  If you download Kerbal Alarm Clock (which I highly recommend) it has utilities for calculating transfer windows.  The reliable standby for calculating such things is this site: https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/ Radial/antiradial works kind of like pivoting your orbit around the point you're currently occupying.  If your orbit is a hula hoop, burning pro/retrograde changes how big it is, burning normal/antinormal changes how it's tilted, and burning radial/antiradial can (to an extent) change how it's positioned around the center of gravity.  It is VERY inefficient, though.  The main use I've found for radial burns is for reducing speed prior to aerobraking before you're close to the planet.  You can burn radially and retrograde at the same time to hold your periapsis at the same altitude while simultaneously decreasing your speed."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,TMarkos,1 point,Tue May 12 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"Burning retrograde and radial to maintain periapsis is, perhaps counterintuitively, the most efficient way to land(given that you're in such a configuration that lowering your periapsis would cause you to crash). It's the definition of a constant altitude landing."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,SenorPuff,3,Tue May 12 22:16:46 2015 UTC,"Are you talking a vacuum landing?  I thought the universal consensus  on those was that suicide burns were always the most efficient (if not the most simple or reliable) method of landing.  I suppose that negating your prograde vector is by default almost always retrograde and radial, but it's a very specific subset of that.  I was talking more about if you've got a transfer stage with extra fuel to burn that you have to jettison before you hit atmo, or you're screaming into moho at 7km/s and all you have are nuke engines.  In both of those cases you need to bleed off speed well before your periapsis but you don't really want to change that periapsis much."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,TMarkos,1 point,Tue May 12 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, in a vacuum. A constant altitude landing is a suicide burn, but performed at periapsis, thereby maximizing the Oberth effect(making it more efficient). It is also safer than a vertical burn, as you can adjust for terrain as it comes at you, rather than being dependent on perfect timing of the burn for optimal efficiency."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,SenorPuff,3,Tue May 12 22:30:34 2015 UTC,"Ooh, right!  I remember seeing a video of that previously:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBa4c-YA3g8  It's a cool technique, but I tend to go for the even safer two-step burn where the first cancels horizontal velocity and the second does your vertical.  I can't shake the idea that I'd just end up slamming into a ridge if I tried this out, and it's really hard to land next to something using this method."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,TMarkos,1 point,Tue May 12 22:36:12 2015 UTC,"Peak of orbit is ideal, both because you use less delta v to transfer but because your intercept with the mun will be a fall to the surface without orbiting first.  There are some disadvantages of course, selecting your landing site is more difficult; if you gave any contracts which require orbit around the mun you will not be able to do them without a correction burn; only saves a few m/s (around 25?) The easiest way is to launch at a launch window where minmus would cross the AN or DN 8 days after launch.  This way you can launch directly east and transfer at the AN or DN and get an encounter.  If you are in career mode and don't want to wait, you can use KER during launch to minimize your relative inclinations, but you'll almost never get under 1%. Launch windows are critical for minimizing delta v budget for interplanetary transfers.  Kerbal Alarm Clock is great for this. Other that mild radial corrections during a larger burn (generally <10 m/s), the only time I really use radial maneuvers after launch is during satellite in a specific orbit contracts to correct the orbit once I have the good apoapsis and periapsis."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,FellKnight,1 point,Tue May 12 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"1) For getting to mun, here's a picture: http://i.imgur.com/3OoG20s.png  This works for near to all bodies, including different planets, but then of course  the green blob is kerbol and not kerbin and the orbit is not the craft orbit but the orbit of Kerbin. If you do this you will hit the Mun straight on. :)  If you plan to land on mun you want to get as low periapsis as possible to utilize the oberth effect when getting into orbit. Also, the smaller the semi major axis, the better you will match your speed to the mun. But then again, if your semi major axis is to small, your periapsis will be very high.  2) Don't change inclination in LKO. Start by extending your orbit to the hight of minmus orbit, then change the inclination at the node which you will pass before reaching minmus.  3) Warp until you get a window. You want to burn in LKO anyway to take advantage of the oberth effect.  4) Radial-/anti radial is great when you want to move the periapsis/apopasis along the orbit itself. It's great for making a circular orbit elliptical and vice versa."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,Dave37,1 point,Tue May 12 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"The trouble with your ""slow = good"" intuition is that you want to be going slow relative to the Mun for the cheapest orbital insertion. I think that means you want your periapsis slightly lower (= faster) than the Mun's altitude at the intercept (if your Ap is at the Mun's altitude, you're going substantially slower than the Mun -- if you were at the same speed you'd be in a circular orbit). I think that also puts you into a prograde orbit, which is generally better for landing and re-ascent. Inclination adjustments are cheaper when you're high and slow, if you have the option. Yep, launch windows for interplanetary are very critical. Look at the Transfer Calculators in the resources sidebar over there -->    ...or get MechJeb if you want to do things the easy way.  The old ∆v charts are still useful as a guideline; things haven't changed too drastically. What do you mean about ∆v changing as you launch?"

KerbalAcademy,35r81p,saelack,3,Tue May 12 23:10:10 2015 UTC,"This actually makes sense, even if it is counterintuitive.  Here's why: as previously stated, KER does its calculations based on the current situation. Just about every engine in the game has a better ISP in vaccuum then it does in atmosphere - the LV -909 will be an easy, extreme example of this. Because of this, if your lander/return stage uses a LV-909, when you launch from the pad it commonly appears to gain dv as it lifts off.  This also factors into what engines to put for your first/second stages, as you are likely to still be in atmosphere when those engines are firing."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,MrBorogove,1 point,Wed May 13 01:08:20 2015 UTC,"Aha, that makes sense -- I'm used to MechJeb, which shows you sea level and vacuum ∆v values separately."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,FellKnight,1 point,Wed May 13 03:54:04 2015 UTC,"KER in flight basically does the delta v calculations based on your current situation.  So while you are flying at 5000m, it may go up because it takes less delta v to get to 6000m than your new delta v calculation at 6000m.  I rely on the numbers in the VAB.  They seem very accurate in my experience."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,Rubicj,0,Tue May 12 23:35:01 2015 UTC,"For some reason, KER calculates the  ∆v of future stages as if the current stages were still attached. ie. if you have a SRB, decoupler, then a SRB, it will calculate the thrust provided by the top SRB as if the bottom SRB is empty, but still attached."
KerbalAcademy,35r81p,MrBorogove,0,Tue May 12 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"I don't use KER, but this isn't the first time I've heard of buggy behavior from it. Mechjeb's ∆v calculations always seem sane to me.  Here's KER's issues tracker."

KerbalAcademy,35q13q,hip-hop-apotomus,33,Tue May 12 15:53:59 2015 UTC,"You say ""burning just outside Kerbin's SOI and then planning the node to Duna"" -- if you picked an arbitrary exit direction and time to leave Kerbin SOI, you could have wasted over 1000 m/s right there."
KerbalAcademy,35q13q,MrBorogove,31,Tue May 12 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"So you just did it very inefficiently.  The map shows the minimum with a correctly timed and aimed transfer, but you need to be right in middle of a good transfer window.  Mechjeb and such can plan them for you, or you can look up transfer window calendars online.    It is also much more efficient to burn from low kerbin orbit rather than just escaping the SOI and then burning to intercept.  By exiting the SOI in the right direction, you should only need minimal correction burns afterwards.    Edit: Here is a good transfer planner online: http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/"
KerbalAcademy,35q13q,Toobusyforthis,11,Tue May 12 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"My mission procedure involved burning just outside kerbin's SOI and then planning the node to Duna from orbit around the sun.   Here you will indeed lose out on the Oberth effect. Avoid burns in solar orbit.  Ideally you should do one burn from low Kerbin orbit that takes you to an encounter with Duna, or close to an encounter. This is only possible while the Kerbin-Sun-Duna angle has a certain value. This angle is always changing because Kerbin orbits the sun faster than Duna.  To find the right time, you can wait in low orbit and regularly test whether a burn out to ""Duna distance"" would get you an encounter. If not, timewarp a few weeks from the tracking station and retest. You'll find that Duna needs to be a certain amount ""ahead"" of Kerbin. It's not unheard of for KSP players to put a protractor to the screen to check this angle :-)  Tuning the encounter in solar orbit with smallish correction burns when you're halfway or closer to Duna is OK. Especially normal and radial burns, because they don't benefit from the Oberth effect anyway.  edit: I forgot to mention that you will have to plan the burn in low Kerbin orbit such that you exit Kerbin's sphere of influence in the same direction that Kerbin is orbiting around the sun. This might not be obvious if you have been doing your burns in solar orbit."
KerbalAcademy,35q13q,wcoenen,9,Tue May 12 17:08:03 2015 UTC,"Correction: Planning a direct transfer burn from LKO to Duna is always possible, however the maximum efficiency (so lowest dV) requires the correct angle. However, even when picking an inefficient launch date, doing a departure burn directly to a Duna encounter will be more efficient than going randomly into Kerbol orbit and planning the encounter from there."
KerbalAcademy,35q13q,Dhaeron,1 point,Tue May 12 20:44:25 2015 UTC,Right you are. Thanks for the correction.
KerbalAcademy,35q13q,wcoenen,3,Tue May 12 22:15:53 2015 UTC,"This.  Because of the Oberth effect, an additional 300 m/s in LKO turns into more than 300 m/s as you leave the SoI, so if you do the 300 m/s in solar orbit, you also have to make up for this difference.  One way to think about it (though the actual math has to do with the fact that kinetic energy isn't linear) is that the faster you leave Kerbin's SoI, the less time gravity has to slow you down."
KerbalAcademy,35q13q,Eric_S,7,Tue May 12 18:45:59 2015 UTC,(1) Did you use a launch window planner of some kind? You left at the right phase angle? That's immensely important.  (2) You should do most of the burn in low Kerbin orbit. The only thing I do in the solar orbit is perhaps a plane change and some fine tuning.
KerbalAcademy,35q13q,jofwu,3,Tue May 12 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"Here's what's happening. There's always about ~950 dV cost for getting from Kerbin low orbit (~100km) to escape velocity out of Kerbin's sphere of influence (where you are orbiting the sun). After you burn in the correct direction, the maps say that it will take an additional ~300 dV to get to Duna. So it will actually always cost ~1200 dV (or more) to get to Duna from low Kerbin SOI. If you already pay the 950 dV to get into a solar orbit, then it will only be several hundred to get to Duna.  (Of course, though, you'll want to eventually learn to do the whole burn in low Kerbin Orbit, but getting into a solar orbit first is a good way to learn the principles)."

That's why.    You want to conduct your entire transfer burn (minus any mid-course plane change, if required) in Low Kerbin Orbit to take advantage of the Oberth effect (where, essentially, the faster you're going, the more acceleration you get from the fuel you're burning...  and you're going much faster near Pe while orbiting Kerbin than drifting around high over the Sun).  You also need to ensure that you're departing while the planets are at the proper phase angle and that you conduct the burn while at the right point of your orbit around Kerbin to attain the desired ejection angle.  Find your phase and ejection angles at http://ksp.olex.biz/.  If you're just burning in random directions at random times, you could spend hundreds or even thousands of km/sec in DeltaV to reach Duna.  The maps assume you're doing everything as efficiently as possible."

As an added bonus they'll ablate away to reduce heat even if it's part-generated, although you can tweak away the ablator if you find this unrealistic.  The tiny girders are good for this purpose too, anything with a low mass (or low thermal mass as with the heat shields) is a good bet.  The important variables are the fluxes and the ext temp.  The ext temp is the skin temperature, so that's the temperature that the ""true"" part temperature is trending towards.  The flux temperatures are basically showing you the change in temp from various sources, so whether it's gaining/losing heat from conduction, convection or radiation.  If you're in atmosphere or water, convection is going to be a big help.  In vacuum, you're looking more at the other two.  Radiation is the only true way to lose heat, but conduction is important for transferring heat to those parts that have additional capacity to radiate it."

You can save multiple quicksaves also by naming quicksaves by doing alt+f5 and choose one to load by alt+f9. It is strange though that the persistent you loaded should be from so long ago. Usually autosaves happen pretty often during flight.
KerbalAcademy,35s07a,deadfrog42,3,Wed May 13 02:54:38 2015 UTC,"I've made this mistake plenty of times myself. The game autosaves to ""persistent"" and when you press F5 you save to ""quicksave."" Pressing F9 unfortunately (I think) only loads ""quicksave."" So if you haven't quicksaved in a while and press F9 hoping to get the last autosave... you're going to be disappointed. And when you do that, ""persistent"" gets overwritten I think. So no going back (to the future?).  Honestly, you're better off ALWAYS using alt+F9. Probably couldn't hurt to always use alt+F5 as well. This will let you choose exactly which file you want to load and create unique saves. Make use of them!

Do a short capture burn that leaves your apoapsis out near the edge of the sphere of influence, then line up the planes when you get out there.  It's not entirely unlike this chain of maneuvers that I used to get from initial Eve arrival to Gilly. Probably cost you a few hundred m/s. Spare change for a lightweight probe."

Once you enter Duna's SoI, you can tweak your orbit to place your Pe anywhere on a low circle perpendicular to your orbit. That circle must by definition intersection the satellite's plane at two opposite points. You need your Pe at one of those points, therefore your Ap will also be in the satellite's plane. You will then do a cheap plane change while near Ap (at the actual intersection, which will depend on the precision of your Pe choice). During that burn you should be able to also raise your Pe to match the satellite. Final burn is at Pe.

It feels like my only option is whole final stage, down and up - and back."
KerbalAcademy,35lmnz,bobbertmiller,4,Mon May 11 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"Several options. The apollo way is to connect lander and the command module with docking ports, separate in Münar orbit, land, ascent, dock and go home. The more simple way (because let's be honest - docking needs practice that you probably don't have right now) is to connect the lander and command module with a simple decoupler. Your command module needs an EMPTY capsule. Then you land your lander, ascent again, rendezvous (again - needs some practice) and EVA from the now defunct lander to the command module -> go home. More simple would be to just have a lander than can get you home. Needs like 1200 m/s from the surface if I recall correctly (you want to aero-breakbrake on Kerbin). But as the comment you replied to said - the Mün isn't the easiest. Go to Minmus first! It's easier to get back from because it needs MUCH less energy to land and get back into orbit while it needs only a tiny bit more to get to from Kerbin when compared to the Mün."

For long missions I sometimes put a satellite, a space station, and a lander all on one interplanetary stage, and separate them when I get there. I then have 3 different vessels in the tracking station that I can move between (and can control as long as there's a kerbal or probe in each one -- if there's an empty pod then you can still move to the ship, you just can't control it until you EVA a kerbal back inside of it).  Your idea to make a lander and then EVA the kerbal to the orbiting stage is a perfect and creative way to get past not having docking points.

I'm not even sure if they have docking ports (but you WOULD be able to use the KLAW to grab the entire vessel, if you want).  Another note, if you do take the EVA root, is that you might want to send a scientist instead of a pilot in the lander, so that you can collect science from the instruments on the lander (which you won't be taking home).

What I typically do is, design a lander with enough fuel to land from low Munar Orbit, and return to Kerbin.  Then I use a big booster base to get the lander to the Mun.  If I have extra fuel from my transfer stage, the booster base, then I use that to bring myself down to the Mun and save some Dv.  Sometimes I run out of fuel as im I descending, but then I just decouple, and now I just have the lander piece, which should already be slowed down for landing.  Basically, I conserve my fuel this way.  While my lander could land for Low Munar orbit and get back to Kerbin.  this just gives me more of a cushion fuel wise.    You can also use docking ports for the lander(not necessary unless you need to return to the transfer vehicle, which you will need to do for more complex missions, and it never hurts to practice).  I havent done it in 1.0, but there was an issue when if you connected docking ports in the VAB, they would remain stuck together when you undocked later.  If thats still happening, an easy fix is to place a docking port then a decoupler that decouples from both sides, and then another docking port.  Like I said, you dont need a transfer vehicle like this for a Mun or Minmus mission, buts its good practice for later.    That said if you havent docked yet, try it first in LKO.  Its complicated at first to do it manually.  But it gets easier.  Or just use mechjeb."

Don't bother staging everything out, you can adjust staging before your actions and you can just right click and execute things manually. Staging is good for launching when time is critical switching from one stage to another, but when your just lazily floating around the Mun you can always right click and do whatever you need to do.  But getting near each other is the part you need to be pretty sure you can do. Try docking things in kerbin orbit first, again, sandbox if you want to try it out. This will be the trickier part if you are new to it than the landing and getting back into orbit part will be. You'll need the conic patches and stuff.  You'll probably really need conic patches / upgraded tracking center. If you can't 'rescue a kerbal from orbit' confidently yet, you can't do a munar rendezvous (apollo) style landing.

Try it on Minmus first -- the gravity is so much smaller that it's easier to land and re-orbit, so the total fuel needed is much less, despite the greater distance. If you have plenty of fuel margin on the Minmus mission, go for the Mun landing next time.  If you do want to do a Munar Orbit Rendezvous (Apollo-type) approach, just make sure you have a command pod on both the orbiter and the lander; you can then switch between them with [ and ] keys (if they're within a couple of km), or in the map view or tracking station (if they're further)."

Flaps work pretty much as you'd expect. They aren't wings(although, you can Use them like flaperons) but they increase lift at the cost of high drag. This is useful in takeoff(what setting 3 is generally used for) and landing(setting 4). Setting 2 is generally used so that you have a step between take off Flaps and no Flaps instead of dumping all that lift right away and risking a stall.   100mps is 220mph. That's really fast.

Adding wing, Flaps, etc to reduce your takeoff speed(you can check this, there's a spot that says something like minimum speed, I can't remember exactly what it's title is but the tool tip explains it) will help immensely.

You're saying that the stability derivatives appear green if you plug in anything for Mach 2 through 7, but when you actually fly the thing it gives you problems around Mach 3.4?

KerbalAcademy,35lmmz,Pyromaniacal13,0,Mon May 11 22:20:28 2015 UTC,Are you testing those Mach numbers at the fractional density (altitude) you're flying? That will account for some discrepancy.

KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,tal2410,4,Mon May 11 11:14:44 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, you want a lot of TWR in stock now. I and others who played FAR in the past were telling people to use less (1.3-1.6 range) than old stock. But a lot of people have been claiming that they see better performance with high TWR.   I saw somebody ask, ""Why do people keep saying to use low TWR? Nobody can give me a good answer."" I myself couldn't remember what the logic was, so I did a few minutes of research. And the only answer I could find had to do with FAR specifically. With a high TWR in FAR (old or new version) you quickly hit high dynamic pressures, which tear your ship to pieces. In stock you don't have to worry about this. With that concern out of the way, I can't think of any reason not to go for the old TWR of 2 from before, to balance/minimize drag from gravity and stock.  Then again, from what I'm seeing, real life rockets are closer to the FAR range at launch. Not sure if I'm missing something..."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,jofwu,10,Mon May 11 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"The advantage to using the lowest TWR you can get away with is that you're making sure you're carrying the most fuel possible. If you launch a rocket with a TWR that's too high, you're essentially missing out on free delta-V that you could get just from adding more fuel tanks."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,Ben347,2,Mon May 11 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's an interesting way to put it!"

KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,MuffinMillitia,-1,Wed May 13 19:00:00 2015 UTC,"The reason to limit is that going faster than terminal velocity in the atmosphere is inefficient.   However, doing so is not really very inefficient, and it's far more realistic to launch with TWR above 1.7. Crap, the shuttle pulled 7G at some points in it's ascent (that requires  TWR of 7 at some point as fuel burns off).  For me, I like 1.7-2.0 lately. My missions aren't planned around launches, I like to automate them and get on with the other parts of the game, personally. If I get a gain in a later stage of a mission by using an engine with too much thrust on the ground, then so be it.   You have a throttle, there's no reason not to use it.  Also, I've been playing a long time, including the period where ships were wobbly as heck. I tend to shy away from going faster than 30m/s inside an atmosphere. The ships are now more stable, but exceeding that by much in the latest aero tends to cause reentry effects on ascent, leading to bad things."

KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,JustALittleGravitas,2,Mon May 11 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"Sure you can, even in 0.90. Put a small fuel tank and engine under a capsule and a couple radial parachutes on the sides, open them up and you'll quickly hit TV with a TWR of just over 1."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,only_to_downvote,1 point,Tue May 12 14:13:14 2015 UTC,Are you sure about that in the latest version?
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,2A_is_the_best_A,0,Mon May 11 19:49:42 2015 UTC,"2.05 might not be right anymore, it must be >2 though. Terminal velocity is by definition the velocity you achieve with 1g of acceleration (g being the local planet, instead of kerbin/earth necessarily). If you want that to be up instead of down you need two gs of thrust, one to cancel gravity and one to provide actual acceleration. Because the atmosphere gets thinner as you go up you need >2 for any significant vertical climb because you're also chasing a moving target (how much greater does vary, that 2.05 was launchpad pre 1.0, at 10k it was 2.1, I think Eve was 2.08, though I referred to that number far less often).  The only thing that might lower it below two is when the curve of the planet becomes a factor and loss of vertical velocity to gravity starts to translate into an increase in horizontal velocity, but by that point you're high enough you can't actually hit TV anyway because it starts to rapidly climb towards infinity (in kerbal, close enough to infinity to not matter for chemical rockets in the real world)."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,JustALittleGravitas,3,Mon May 11 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"Terminal velocity is by definition the velocity you achieve with 1g of acceleration (g being the local planet, instead of kerbin/earth necessarily).   This is just absolutely not correct. You can't define terminal velocity without drag or the density of the fluid (atmosphere).  http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/e/3/6e306f943fc864e7ee41a1b3a7f16172.png  Terminal velocity in rocket ascent terms is when all additional thrust is going to increase drag, rather than cause acceleration.   Defining this number which changes continuously throughout the ascent in terms of TWR (an acceleration) just doesn't make any sense, and I now see that you're trying to simplify this by removing all drag elements, which was sorta how the old physics model worked.   That simplification absolutely doesn't apply to the v1.0 where real drag calculations are being made. Terminal velocity for a draggy craft with the exact same TWR is going to be way lower than a very low drag craft with the exact same TWR at liftoff, and even the same TWR profile through the whole atmospheric section of the ascent.  Edit: I need to point out here that we're not even talking in the same terms for TWR. A TWR at liftoff of 1.7 only increases as fuel burns off. This means that liftoff figure can easily mean a TWR of 3+ during the vertical portion of the ascent, where Vt matters. The only exception would be asparagus with a large number of stages (your TWR reverts back to the liftoff figure after you stage with asparagus)."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,2A_is_the_best_A,0,Mon May 11 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"That's the calculation for terminal velocity, not the definition of it. However its Still true going off that, note the g in the equation, that the force you need.  And right off the launchpad is where low thrust hurt MOST, so waiting to lose fuel instead of using boosters is really inefficient."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,JustALittleGravitas,2,Tue May 12 00:06:59 2015 UTC,"I too liked low TWR in FAR and my experience so far with 1.0.* is that a low TWR works only for very stable crafts. For unstable crafts (eg, most crafts in early career mode) TWR 1.8-1.9 is better to avoid deviating before reaching a proper speed. TWR above 1.9 is a bit too much IMO (and might even be dangerous with solid boosters)."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,vlanore,3,Mon May 11 11:31:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I always felt that going over 300 m/s when you're under maybe 7km often causes the ship flip with unstable crafts. When I have to launch pancakes (300+ tons), going slow and using more dV (wasting more fuel on gravity and being in lower atmo longer) is the only way I can make it to orbit."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,Bananasauru5rex,2,Mon May 11 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"I've been doing okay with very low TWR - not deliberately, I keep finding I have a low TWR when I launch and each time I think it wasn't that low in the VAB...  But I do have to be very careful with my launch profile.  Gently, gently does it.  As to how efficient it is, genuinely have no clue :)"
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,Korvar,1 point,Mon May 11 15:03:58 2015 UTC,"In 1.0.0 all engines are noticeably less powerful at sea level, instead of consuming fuel faster, to account for the difference in ISP with regards to pressure. The latest Kerbal Engineer takes that into account."

KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,JustALittleGravitas,2,Mon May 11 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on the rocket. Low TWR makes sense for a lot of stuff that's got non optimal aerodynamics so I don't flip over when I cross the sound barrier, with nerf rockets I can push supersonic and stay in control really easily (sometimes it takes a few tries to figure out how far to push in the initial gravity turn, but once I nail it down its easy orbit every time), so high TWR works great, I can push to orbit for only a hair over 3000dv."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,WazWaz,2,Mon May 11 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Higher TWR is always better if you don't exceed terminal velocity (you generally won't in FAR or new stock unless your craft is ridiculous) and you can still control your craft - which will also depend on your craft.  I think the only reason ""low twr"" was recommended with FAR was because the thinner atmosphere meant you needed less dV anyway, so low twr was a compromise that still got you into orbit with a familiar cost. Faster was better, but it was harder, just as it is in new stock.  I use my own kOS script to launch and I definitely get better efficiency if my craft can accelerate faster, with all else being equal."
KerbalAcademy,35l2cx,pigsnoutman,1 point,Mon May 11 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"I always aimed for high TWR in FAR, and low TWR in old stock. In old stock I nearly always had to significantly throttle back after reaching 120m/s. In FAR I never had heating problems at launch, and never had the ship break up. Going slower does help if your ship is unstable, but the better plan is to get a more stable ship (bigger tail fins)."

KerbalAcademy,35hzmk,5secondstozerotime,18,Sun May 10 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"If you use Kerbal Engineer it's possible to get your SMA accurate enough that your orbital period is within a hundredth of a second of 6h.  As you probably know, you don't need to worry so much about getting apoapse/periapse precise, the only thing that really matters is getting your orbital period (or SMA) as accurate as your tools will allow.  A very low power motor tweaked via the right click menu to limit it's thrust as low as it'll go will give you the required finesse to adjust your orbital period to be as close as it needs to be.  For instance if you have four geosync sats 90 degrees out of phase at this level of accuracy it'll take hundreds if not thousands of years before they're noticeably out of sync. That's good enough for me."
KerbalAcademy,35hzmk,DEADB33F,3,Sun May 10 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"Another trick to really fine control over your period, if setting the limiter to 5% and barely tapping the engine is still to much, is to sacrifice your inclination.  Point orbit-normal, then very slightly toward prograde or retrograde, and tap the thrust, to get a much much smaller change in your semi-major axis (and thus period).  You can use this to tune your kerbosync orbit, as long as you don't mind your craft moving back and forth across a small patch of sky."

This was a lot simpler before the new aerodynamics but the parts that have lift also have a lot of drag. As such if your center of lift is in front of your center of mass you can get instability. Your center of mass can also change mid flight when you burn fuel so you might not be losing control do to altitude but because if shifting center of mass. Try either flying around at lower altitudes for a long while and see what happens or just launch with half fuel.  to be honest I am impressed that you can get anything up to the upper end of middle atmosphere. since the 1.0 update I cant get anything to fly above 12,000 without rockets."

KerbalAcademy,35g481,Rockleg,2,Sun May 10 17:42:08 2015 UTC,Sure it's not engines cutting out due to lack of air?

This is fine when you have enough air for all engines, but as you run out you find that engine1 will steal all the air, and engine 2 will get nothing.  So, if you place intake 1 then engine 1, then intake 2, then engine 2, they will all have the same amount of air as it starts to thin out."

KerbalAcademy,35f1fk,Wolomago,-6,Sat May 9 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"A general guide to getting into orbit;   Build ship with ~4000dv and twr ~1.5  Activate SAS, increase throttle and liftoff.  Rise to ~10km straight up then begin slow tilt east. Tip: the runway points east. (I often find that, especially with larger craft, waiting until almost 20km helps to prevent flipping)  Push the ""m"" key to pull up the map. Take note of how high your apoapsis is. A stable orbit begins at ~70km. We will return to this in a moment.  Continue to tilt east until you are pointing at the horizon, where the blue and orange halves of the navball meet. Take another look at you apoapsis.  If it is below 70k point towards the sky (blue navball half) ~5-10 degrees until it's over 70k. If it is getting too far above 70k then point towards the ground a few degrees (orange half).   I like to get a orbit 80-100k personally. Once your apoapsis is about at the altitude you want allow yourself to coast (cut throttle) and just point at your prograde marker (should be around the horizon) Burn till your periapsis Is over 70k, if you want to circularize your orbit burn till your apoapsis and periapsis are almost the same.

KerbalAcademy,35f1fk,tzjanii,5,Sun May 10 00:59:58 2015 UTC,"This is... not the greatest advice for a beginner. You can't start by telling them to have a certain amount of dv and twr-- for one thing, they have no idea what those acronyms mean, because you never defined them.

If you search for ""ksp dv"" or ""ksp twr"" in the reddit search bar, in google, in bing, etc you will find thousands of hits that explain in great detail what these terms and acronyms mean. This is a reddit comment, not a full, in-depth walkthrough. I'm not going to include a glossary. I also love answering questions for curious kerbonauts that are, like I said before, willing to ask. That's how the learning process works.  Op said he has attempted to get into orbit a number of times. Chances are he has seen twr, dv and apoapsis. This is the ideal time for him to learn what they are as they are integral parts of this game. None of the concepts I describe are complicated. If he isn't interested in learning what they are then perhaps this isn't the right game for him.  Believe it or not, many of us learned this game with far less. I was a beginner at one point and I learned these concepts without my head exploding. There were no problems I ran into that a quick Google search/reddit question couldn't resolve. Now, either I'm special or op can do it too.  There is no need to baby people, they aren't stupid. If there is anything you don't understand then feel free to ask!

KerbalAcademy,35f1fk,2silverseas,8,Mon May 11 09:41:10 2015 UTC,"Always go east. It is the same as having a heading of 90 degrees.  Why you might wonder? It's because Kerbin is rotating that way. You need some 2300 m/s to be in orbit around Kerbin. And just by standing still on kerbin you're moving 175 m/s to the east, because the planet rotates. So if you go into orbit towards the east you'll only have to accelerate 2125 m/s to get into orbit, while if you go west you will have to accelerate 2475 m/s. This makes going east 16% more efficient."
KerbalAcademy,35f1fk,WazWaz,3,Sat May 9 20:14:18 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Aircraft heading of article  Course %28navigation%29:       An aircraft's heading is the direction that the aircraft's nose is pointing.  It is referenced by using either the magnetic compass or heading indicator, two instruments that most aircraft have as standard. Using standard instrumentation, it is in reference to the local magnetic north direction. True heading is in relation to the lines of meridian (north–south lines). The units are degrees from north in a clockwise direction. North is 0°, east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°.  Note that, due to wind forces, the direction of movement of the aircraft, or track, is not the same as the heading. The nose of the aircraft may be pointing due west, for example, but a strong northerly wind will change its track south of west. The angle between heading and track is known as the drift angle. Crab angle is the amount of correction an aircraft must be turned into the wind in order to maintain the desired course. It is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the drift angle.

KerbalAcademy,35f1fk,mcgtx,5,Sat May 9 20:15:09 2015 UTC,"Another way to tell which way is east is that the ocean is directly east of you. Also, if you didn’t rotate your command module while building your rocket (or rotate your rocket after launch for that matter) east should be the direction you turn when you press the D key.  I am not sure it is what you are asking but if you are having trouble finding the navball it is at the bottom center of your screen. if you cant see it look for a small arrow and click on that.  Although this is not entirely related to the question in your post you might still find it helpful. It might just be me but I have found that instead of thinking of the navball as a ball you are looking at from the outside, imagine it is a bubble around you that you are looking at from the inside of, from the cockpit on your craft. The orange marker is the direction your nose is pointing. As such if you see the center of the blue half a little to the left of the orange marker that means that you have to turn your craft to the left to be pointing that way (straight up).  The other thing you can do is go into the tutorials even if you don't need what they are trying to teach some of them will give you a craft already in orbit that will let you play with the navball for as long as you need.  Finally, don't give up. Even when you get to orbit, orbital mechanics are hard. More that that they are counter intuitive, The wost kind of hard, but once you figure out why the things you do do what they do, it gets a lot easier.  Ok, actually finally, I apologize if my explanations are not clear. I have been playing this for a long time so I might be using confusing terms without even knowing it."

Also hopefully you are building rockets with enough delta-v. Install the Kerbal Engineer mod to help with that.

KerbalAcademy,35djm8,MrTanookiMario,9,Sat May 9 07:28:07 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure those fuel takes at the top aren't doing anything. Those fuel lines are connected to the lander can under the decoupler and fuel can't flow through decouplers. That means the fuel in those tanks can't be used by any engine. Try moving those fuel lines onto the  tanks.
KerbalAcademy,35djm8,C-O-N,7,Sat May 9 08:03:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, good catch, but on the reverse side of the craft there's two more fuel lines that allow the fuel to flow past the decouplers. It's a somewhat convoluted fuel flow, lol. The fuel goes from the bottom of the liquid boosters up to the top two tanks (basically just to make them drain faster so I can ditch them sooner). And the fuel from the top two tanks is connected over the decoupler to the module, which in turn connects over a decoupler to the center engine."
KerbalAcademy,35djm8,C-O-N,5,Sat May 9 08:33:38 2015 UTC,Where did you get the 8560m/s figure from? I can't see how that rocket could produce so much dV.
KerbalAcademy,35djm8,C-O-N,3,Sat May 9 08:40:40 2015 UTC,"Well for the first stage I have  9.81*(2*165 + 2*280 + 270)*ln(51.5/37.7) ~ 3550   This is including a calculation that each of the outer tanks will have burned about 250 units of fuel (using the flow rates 600/22.66 * 6.577 ~ 174, plus a little less than half that again on each tank from the middle engine), and an equal proportion of oxidizer.  The next stage I jettison the boosters and start from missing ~250 fuel so:  9.81*(2*280 + 270)*ln(34.4/23.2) ~ 3200   After that I jettison the liquid boosters and start at full tanks up top (because the fuel feeds from the outside in), and I also start using the specific impulse numbers for a vaccum so:  9.81*(320)*ln(18.2/10.2) ~ 1810   And finally I lose the top two tanks and the bottom engine to reveal a Terrier and for my module I get:  9.81*(345)*ln(7.6/3.6) ~ 2520   The first three stages are the combined 8560 I was talking about.

KerbalAcademy,35cv6j,Darkrisk,27,Sat May 9 02:14:44 2015 UTC,"There are basically 2 kinds of tugs that each fit a different role:   Station Tug Interplanetary Tug   The idea for a tug is to build a craft who's job is to move another craft from point A to B. Station tugs are often little more than a probe core attached to a RCS tank with some RCS thrusters. They are used to move ships around a space station and for space station construction. Interplanetary tugs are often a large tank or two and some nuclear thrusters. An example of where they are useful is for sending a spaceplane to Laythe. It takes a considerable amount of dV to get to and from Laythe, more than is often available to a small space plane. By using a tug the splaceplane can retain its dV for the descent and ascent portions, allowing for a smaller, more efficient spacecraft."

This can make you logistics very easy and your only problem now becomes to launch whatever you build into Kerbin orbit and the tugs can take them where they should go. No need to hustle around with transfer stages etc. And you have to once in a while launch some fuel into orbit so that your tugs can refuel.  Here are some pics of my old tugs I used in Sandbox: http://imgur.com/a/VQfo5  Here's a smaller interplanetary tug that I built in orbit to take landers and what not to and from Duna:  http://i.imgur.com/fYQ22Ud.png  http://i.imgur.com/ZY1MmGK.png  This was all pre 1.0 so I wouldn't recommend these designs from a heat or cost perspective.

KerbalAcademy,35ch6o,heartbreak_hank,5,Fri May 8 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"Is that a Nerv on the upper stage? If so, it's worth noting that the Nerv no longer uses oxidizer, only liquid fuel. You might be carrying a lot of extra oxidizer around and not using it as fuel, or if you've removed the oxidizer, just wasting tank mass and having less fuel in your upper stage. Consider replacing the fuel tank with a liquid fuel fuselage.  Also, it's possible the total dV of your ship would increase if you used a Terrier, or even a Spark, on your upper stage. The Nerv is very efficient, but it's also very heavy, and that makes you get less benefit from the lower stages, as well as increasing the dry mass of your final stage. If you have KER, I would just swap out the engine for a couple others and see what effect it has on the total dV. If you don't have KER, I would get KER, it's a fantastic mod that just gives you more information."
KerbalAcademy,35ch6o,Salanmander,1 point,Sat May 9 00:50:14 2015 UTC,"You can use an aircraft liquid fuel fuselage, or just right-click on the tank and pull the oxidizer out. I assume the aircraft fuselage is lighter per unit fuel, but haven't checked to be sure."
KerbalAcademy,35ch6o,MrBorogove,3,Sat May 9 02:45:25 2015 UTC,"That FL-T400 had 2.2 tons of oxidizer, 1.8 tons was liquid fuel, and 0.5 tons of dry mass. If you want to keep the same mass of fuel, and use rocket fuel tanks, you'd need about 1.1 tons of dry mass to make all your fuel liquid fuel.  If you use liquid fuel fuselages, you'd need about 0.8 tons of dry mass, using mk 1 tanks. With mk 2 you'd need about 0.67 tons of dry mass.  So if you only need liquid fuel, then use the liquid fuel tanks.  (I didn't account for granularity in the calculations, but I checked it enough to know that it won't change the overall outcome.)"

KerbalAcademy,359qzv,lordkrike,3,Fri May 8 11:01:38 2015 UTC,What ascent profile are you using? Do you vary it with different rocket designs?
KerbalAcademy,359qzv,Rockleg,3,Fri May 8 11:30:53 2015 UTC,"I don't use the automatic one.  I find it works a little better if you are just a tad overengined (about 1.7 TWR at the surface) and begin your gravity turn under a kilometer.  A lot of rockets spin out as the gravity turn begins, particularly if it starts at higher altitudes, because MechJeb is a little rough about pitching over quickly.  I also keep the maximum angle of attack under 5 degrees.  If it's a more unstable craft, I keep it under 3."
KerbalAcademy,359qzv,lordkrike,2,Fri May 8 11:52:16 2015 UTC,"I've found that MJ works just fine with a TWR of ~1.4 at launch.  My ascent profile varies with the launch vehicle and it's per-stage TWR, but in general I start a gentle turn as low as possible (750 m for light rockets, 2 km for medium, 5 km for heavy) and make sure to keep the AoA at or under 5°. I tend to prefer a 60% turn shape that aims to hit a 0° flight path angle at ~55 km.  Flying like this lets you start getting horizontal velocity as soon as possible, but keeps the real speed until you're in the thin atmosphere where you've already conquered gravity and drag isn't going to be a big problem.  Like the others have said, making a stable aerodynamic craft is more important than it used to be. Try to be slightly top heavy, use fins more than you did in 0.90, and don't open up too large of an AoA.  EDIT: Oh, and as /u/2A_is_the_best_A said: ""Limit to Terminal Velocity"" is broken. I manage this by setting maximum acceleration to 25 m/s until I'm above 32 km, and then disable the limiter. Seems to work fine."
KerbalAcademy,359qzv,Valthonis,2,Fri May 8 16:38:11 2015 UTC,Maybe I should increase my turn shape.  I often feel like my craft are turning too early.  Something I love about KSP is that there is always more to learn.
KerbalAcademy,359qzv,lordkrike,1 point,Fri May 8 20:55:17 2015 UTC,I've found that MJ works just fine with a TWR of ~1.4 at launch.   I've used it for things ranging from TWR of 1.01 to 6.7 and its managed to work fine in every instance.  Sometimes they are more of a brute force ascent and not very graceful but it still put them all into a nice circular orbit.  Am I misunderstanding the point people are making when they say things like MJ works just fine with a TWR of ~1.4 at launch.
KerbalAcademy,359qzv,Valthonis,1 point,Fri May 8 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"In my experience, 1.0 punished high launch TWRs by exaggerating aerodynamic instability. In 0.90 and prior, I aimed for a launch TWR of ~1.7 just to balance gravity losses with drag losses. Those craft, even though they were pretty aerodynamic and weighted properly, would shake and tip in 1.0 because of how hard they accelerated. Experimenting has led me to aim for a 1.4 TWR for smooth launches, with and without MechJeb.  MJ's acceleration limiter can allay this a lot, though, and if you're using it you can pretty confidently launch craft with absurdly high TWR (6.7? Yowza!) without dynamic pressure giving you issues because MJ will throttle down accordingly."

KerbalAcademy,357vd3,merv243,3,Fri May 8 00:11:53 2015 UTC,you must not be trying anything like docking spaceplanes or really large rockets.  this breaks down when you're trying to dock something more complicated than a symmetrical rocket with a docking port on the front.  edit: spaceplane for scale
KerbalAcademy,357vd3,tippyc,3,Fri May 8 04:57:46 2015 UTC,I don't understand why large rockets would make this not work. The rocket will rotate slower but there shouldn't be a large amount of rotating necessary anyway once orbits are matched like that.

KerbalAcademy,357vd3,facepillownap,3,Fri May 8 04:40:53 2015 UTC,"I've never seen anyone mention the method I use, so I'll throw it out there for people to play with.  This assumes you can perform all pre-docking preparation maneuvers (<2km separation, 0 relative velocity, control from/target docking ports).  Requirements: RCS  Recommended: SAS   Orient both docking ports roughly towards each other and hold position with either SAS or time warp. Close the distance by using your RCS translational controls to place the prograde marker/TVV on the pink target marker. You will be able to close to within 50-20m looking exclusively at your navball and watching distance to target. At 50-20m confirm both docking ports are aligned to the same plane and take this time to make any angular adjustments so the ports meet flush. If your target craft has turned around, kill velocity and reorient it, and continue.   I like this ""Green on Pink"" method because you can start from almost any orientation as long as the ports are facing within 160° of each other. The further angled away from each other they start, the more fuel you will use to keep the correct course as you slow down because the RCS is not aligned with your direction of travel, but as long as you have green on pink, your docking ports will touch every single time.   You don't need a skilled pilot, you don't need the port on your nose, and it can be done with any sized or shaped ship with decent RCS control and reasonable RCS balance. With proper setup, docking in the dark is a breeze."
KerbalAcademy,357vd3,EyebrowZing,2,Fri May 8 17:01:05 2015 UTC,"Main point here is to have docking on the nose.  I tried to dock with two radiall docking ports, just below my command pod. No RCS. Absolute nightmare."
KerbalAcademy,357vd3,notepad20,2,Fri May 8 00:39:09 2015 UTC,"You can right click on a docking port and select 'control from here' to have it point in the right direction using SAS. That doesn't help you with thrust, though."
KerbalAcademy,357vd3,pogden,2,Fri May 8 05:36:45 2015 UTC,"Lol, pre 1.0 I was doing this manually with small ships.  Just kept switching back and forth to keep aligning the ports until I was close enough.  This certainly seems easier... if any pilots survive long enough I'll give it a try."
KerbalAcademy,357vd3,BillOfTheWebPeople,2,Fri May 8 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"You can do this without the SAS following target too without much trouble. You just need to point the two crafts at each other manually. Use fine controls (caps lock) and gently point the craft at each other. Abusing time acceleration to kill all rotation can help too but isn't strictly necessary. You will probably need to switch between the two craft a couple of times to keep them pointing at each other but it's not really very difficult to do.  I do most my dockings this way. As I approach the other craft, I slow myself down gradually keeping the prograde marker on the target marker, or rather the retrograde marker on the anti-target marker as you're usually pointed that way at this stage. When I get within about 1 km, I rotate the other craft to face the incoming craft, then go back to the incoming craft. As I get within tens of metres I slow to about 0.5 m/s and make sure the prograde marker is right in the middle of the target marker and keep the craft pointed that way too. Sometimes at this point I may need to go back to the other craft to make sure it's still pointing the right way. But then they mostly just glide into a dock. No need for RCS or the docking UI mod or even SAS and you just glide into a dock directly from approach. Certainly RCS will make this even easier as you can fine tune your trajectory without turning your craft but it's pretty easy to manage this without RCS.  The only condition for this to work is that the incoming craft has the docking port at the nose. The other craft can even have a radial docking port, you just need to set the control from here for that port in that craft. I suppose if the other craft is really massive and it's a struggle to turn it at all then this won't work."

Set up a node, if you have intersect that's off try dragging the node so they're on top of each other. After that play with the different options. Pull a bit normal see if it gets you closer. No? Try antinormal.   Either way, once you get within about 7-10km, set your nav ball to target if it didn't automatically. When you're that close it shouldn't be too difficult.

What you can then do is target the target craft, create a maneuver node with enough of a prograde/retrograde burn that the apoapsis/periapsis is at the height of the other orbit, then move the maneuver node around until you get a very close intercept.  As you move the node around, you'll see how changing the burn time changes the intercept distance and whether you're ahead or behind.  If you're dealing with noncircular orbits, then I tend to set up and burn a maneuver node that puts the higher orbit's periapsis and the lower orbit's apoapsis at the same place, and then watch where the nearest intercept is on each orbit.  When it looks like on the next orbit I'll be moving from too soon/too late to the opposite, then I execute a maneuver that makes the maneuvering ship's orbit more closely match the target's orbit.  At some point between the starting orbit and target orbit will be a point where both craft hit their respective apoapsis/periapsis at the same time."

For Parallel Orbit rendezvous, you're just automatically getting an “intersection” by virtue of having very close orbits.  (which is why it's so painfully slow)  See here for step-by-step diagrams."
KerbalAcademy,357o7a,darkviper039,1 point,Sat May 9 03:04:02 2015 UTC,"You can always get a transfer between two concentric orbits where one apsis (peri- or apo-) of your craft's intercept orbit just touches the target orbit.  If there's a big angle between your interception orbit and the targets, you're going to be spending a lot of delta-V torquing your orbit around to match.  However, depending on the relative size of your orbits, and where you and your target are in your respective orbits, the time to burn may not be between ""now"" and one orbit from now, which is the default when placing a new maneuver node.  Here's what I do (for starters, let's assume the target has a roughly equatorial orbit around Kerbin):   Get your craft parked in orbit.  Unless it's a rescue mission where the stranded Kerbal is really low, I aim to be ""inside"" the target orbit. Target the other craft Put a node just behind your craft (so set for a time almost a full orbit ahead).  Drag prograde on the node until the new apoapsis is just touching the target's orbit.  The closest approach marker for your craft should pop up right there.  If not, then your relative inclination is too far off to count as a ""close approach"". Make a note of the closest approach indicator for the target.  If they're close, see if dragging[1] the maneuver node back and forth along your craft's orbit gets them closer.  Depending on the eccentricity of the target's orbit, this may require adjusting the manuever node to keep the node's orbit's apoapsis lined up just on the target's orbit. If the target's intercept marker is way off around its orbit, start using the ""next orbit"" buttons on the node[2].  As you click, you should see the target position intercept marker move around it's orbit, showing where it will be at that future time.  Click ""next orbit"" until the target's intercept marker is close to your intercept marker.  You'll hit a point where a click jumps the target's marker ""across"" your craft's position marker.  Or maybe you'll get lucky and they'll line right up.  Stop here. If there's still a gap between the intercept markers, drag the maneuver node around to get the intercept markers even closer.  WARNING: 9 times out of ten (at least in 0.90, maybe it's been fixed in 1.0), doing this will lose the ""future orbit"" state, and you'll have to click ""next orbit"" a number of times again to line things back up.   With some fiddling, you should get a close rendezvous right at your apoapsis.  This way, your burn to zero out your relative velocity will be almost exclusively prograde, so you're not wasting much delta-V.  Just wait until the time of the node, and burn prograde until the delta-V gauge burns down.  Once your transfer burn is done and you're coasting up to your target, you can put a new maneuver node at the point of intercept and add a prograde burn until the two orbits look pretty close.  This gives you an estimate on how much delta-V it'll take to match your target's orbital speed, and how long of a burn it'll take.  Rendezvousing with other craft is probably one of my favorite things in KSP.  Once you get some practice, it just kind of ""clicks"".  Hope this has been helpful.  [1] If you didn't know, you can click and drag the inner circle of a maneuver node to move it around your current orbit, without changing any of the prograde/normal/radial burn values.  [2] Right-Click the center circle of the node, and you should get three mini-circles: top-right ""x"" to cancel the node, and two at the bottom.  The lower-right button shifts the time of the node into the future by one orbit of your craft.  The lower-left goes back an orbit (but only if you've already gone forward).  **edited to fix ""click"" to ""right-click"" to activate the next orbit options."

Well, the orbit isn't ""good"" if you're not anywhere near the target and you're not getting closer to the target.

If your inclination is drifting south, aim just north of 90 degrees.  reverse that if you're drifting north.  The easiest way to get into that inclination on the Mun is to transfer to the Mun as accurately as possible (you want a periapsis that's below the surface of the Mun), then burn straight north or south as soon as you cross the SoI of the Mun.  This will give you a very cheap maneuver to adjust your inclination, though once your periapsis gets much above ground, you might want to focus on normal+ or normal- instead of straight up or down."

KerbalAcademy,3570bx,Toobusyforthis,2,Thu May 7 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.... that's the same TWR and just a tad faster speed to start the pitch maneuver than my profile, so I think you're right about suspecting craft design.  From the description, I'd say it's the fact that those boosters are a bit tall for the craft, but I'd rather wait for the screenshots and actually try flying it before making a final judgement.  How much mass is the payload, BTW? And do you have a capsule, SAS modules, or probe cores in it?"
KerbalAcademy,3570bx,Toobusyforthis,1 point,Thu May 7 19:12:45 2015 UTC,It has the second probe core you unlock (the probodyne?) which has SAS. Turning on the SAS makes the rocket woble as it tries to keep it steady. Not sure on payload mass till I get home.

KerbalAcademy,3570bx,Dave37,1 point,Fri May 8 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"Inclination isn't something you need to worry a lot about early in the burn. Remember that getting in orbit requires being above 70km and going ~2200m/s. If you're only moving a couple hundred m/s and still headed mostly up and/or East... your north/south velocity is peanuts. Do your best to nudge a bit north or south as needed, but I wouldn't really worry about it until you're 10km up or so."
KerbalAcademy,3570bx,Dave37,3,Thu May 7 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"Keep an eye on your navball during ascent and make slight adjustments as necessary to keep you on course.  Hard to get it exactly perfect, but a couple degrees off is good enough.   Easiest way to do that is adjust your encounter so your AP for the flyby is somewhere on the orbit (and going in the right direction).  Once you get an encounter, make a node 1/3-1/2 of the way to the mun and play around with the radial and normal vectors to adjust exactly where your ap will be.  The further you are from the mun the more efficient it is, but more sensitive so it can be a little finicky.  Once its close though, circularizing at your AP should put you pretty close into the orbit you want, then just adjust it as normal."
KerbalAcademy,3570bx,Dave37,1 point,Thu May 7 17:48:44 2015 UTC,I'm ending up way off (29 degree inclination on my last attempt). I think my rockets just don't handle very well in the lower atmosphere.

If its a 1 minute long burn, you should start it 30 seconds before the node (30s before AP), that way the burn its lined up on the middle of the node for more accuracy. Kerbal Engineer Redux adds TWR and more info to the VAB. (plus modules to add to your rockets for info during flight).  A lot of the contracts are designed to be engineering challenges. Part of a successful career mode is picking and choosing which ones you do and how cheaply you can build a rocket/plane to complete them.  Not sure, depends on your next goal probably."

I may starting out too steep (not pointing toward horizon until too late)...so that may contribute...but that should only mean a longer burn, not a more ellipitcal orbit...but perhaps the time is making the projection look weird."
KerbalAcademy,356vnu,fibonatic,1 point,Thu May 7 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, first off welcome!     If your AP balloons out, you are not doing the maneuver quite at your AP, and your AP is going to move regardless because you need to start your burn before you actually get to your AP.  It can be a bit fiddly, and its normal for it to balloon out some. I find if my AP is ballooning out too much the easiest way to deal with it is let it balloon out a bit, then put a new manuver node on the new AP and finish circularizing from there.   TWR cannot be seen in the stock game which is a huge oversight IMO.  TWR and delta-v are the two most important numbers in rocket creation, and the game should show them.  You can download mods such as Kerbal engineer or Mechjeb to get this information. To answer your question, two reasons:  weight and efficiency.  Some engines are better for in atmosphere, and some are better for in vacuum.  You don't need a ton of thrust once you are already in space, and its better to bring a smaller, lighter engine that is more efficient in vacuum (right click on the engines in the builder and look for the ISP numbers, that is a measure of their efficiency) Those contracts are notoriously difficult.  The game gives you access to the part for the contract if you dont have it unlocked, but they usually require purpose built craft and are rarely worth the payout.  Once you get to know what is feasible with more experience, its easier to pick out which ones are worthwhile and which you should avoid.   There are lots of biomes on each body, Kerbin included!  You can get science by doing the different experiments in different places.  Check the internet for biome maps.  Then, after flyby, land on the thing and bring back some surface samples!"
KerbalAcademy,356vnu,llye,1 point,Thu May 7 17:00:38 2015 UTC,If you want to cheat you can also enable the biome map in game in the debug menu.

KerbalAcademy,356vnu,jofwu,1 point,Thu May 7 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I usually use it in career mode, since finding new biomes to get science from can be annoying without it.

KerbalAcademy,356vnu,fibonatic,1 point,Thu May 7 22:02:44 2015 UTC,"For a 2-week old player you sound like you're doing pretty good!  1) Sounds like you are burning too soon. When you place a maneuver node, it assumes that you are making the velocity change instantaneously. Obviously that's not true- it takes time to burn and speed up. So you're best bet is to center things as good as possible. If you need to make a 30 second burn, don't start 30 seconds before the node. Start 15 seconds ahead of the node, so that you do 15 seconds of burning before the node and 15 seconds after. Make sense?  That should help some. I personally prefer to circularize manually, without a node. It's perhaps a bit tricky at first, but maybe worth a shot. The idea is to keep your ship parallel with the ground, right between the orange and blue halves of the ball. When you get close to apoapsis, burn full speed ahead. You'll want to be in map mode. Keep an eye on the Ap marker. If you're gaining on it or about to pass it, point a bit ""up"" towards the blue side of the ball. If it's starting to balloon on you, point a bit ""down"" towards the orange side of the ball. With some practice you can keep it right where you want it. The trick is that you also have to keep an eye on the periapsis marker when it comes. Have to be ready to kill the engine when the two markers start to flip spots. I'd say you should reduce your thrust when you first see it appear, to be safe.  2) TWR isn't super important once you're in space. It's mostly a launch issue. In space, you mostly just want an engine with a high Isp, which is a measure of how fuel efficient the engine is. Right click parts to in the VAB to see what their vacuum (vac) Isp is. Unless I'm mistaken, he used an engine with a better Isp for his final launch stage. Note that once you are 30-40 km up, you are practically in a vacuum.  3) They are indeed. They actually made it better than it was if you can believe it. :) You don't have to do every contract. In fact, you can hit the red X to decline them. They will disappear, and when you check back there will be more in its place. Don't do a contract if you don't like the sound of it. If a contract has parts that you haven't researched yet, it will make those parts available to you (they will be highlighted blue) until you complete the contract.  4) Not completely sure what you're asking. Look up the Science experiment parts on the KSP wiki. If you want to get more science try to move towards those parts on the tree. You can also look up Kerbin's biomes and figure out where you haven't been, if that doesn't feel cheaty to you. Otherwise, look towards reaching out to the Mun and Minmus."
KerbalAcademy,356vnu,fibonatic,1 point,Thu May 7 17:17:44 2015 UTC,Thanks...I played the demo a bit. so 1) It's not my actual the balloons out...it's the projected (orange) one. If it assumes instantaneous...that's even more strange.
KerbalAcademy,356vnu,jofwu,1 point,Thu May 7 17:58:14 2015 UTC,Are you sure that you are pulling on the prograde marker and how close is the maneuver node to the apoapsis.

Spreading a burn out over time is a lot more complicated if you want to know the final trajectory. Plus it would have to assume that you follow it's recommendation perfectly.  For practical purposes, most burns are essentially instantaneous (compared to the period of the full orbit). So the results are generally close enough."
KerbalAcademy,356vnu,number2301,1 point,Thu May 7 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"On thing I want to add on number 1) is that a good rule of thumb is that burning prograde will push your Ap away from you, and burning retrograde will pull it towards you. The further you are from your Ap, the larger this effect is. So the best way to get your orbit fairly circular is to burn when you're pretty close to your Ap. If it starts moving a lot further away from you, just wait for a bit.  Do you know that you can raise and lower your throttle on the map screen, so that you can see the effects of the burn and maintain control at the same time?"
KerbalAcademy,356vnu,number2301,1 point,Thu May 7 17:21:35 2015 UTC,Yes...got all that. I've had more success with manual burns than looking at what the orange projected line is trying to do. I just didn't understand why the projected was so lopsided with the burn right at Ap. Thanks.
KerbalAcademy,354u9y,yuritheruskie,7,Thu May 7 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"Get to periapsis, get into orbit but keep the Apoapsis as high as possible. Get to Apoapsis, circularize the orbit (increase periaspsis). Get to one of the inclination nodes, adjust your inclination. Lower your periapsis so that you get an intersect node. Get to the intersect node and decrease your apoapsis so that you'll meet the craft on the next orbit Get to the next intersection and cancel the relative velocities.   This ought to be the most fuel efficient way to do it."
KerbalAcademy,354u9y,Dave37,3,Thu May 7 09:01:38 2015 UTC,"actually no, when he first enters the Mun's SOI would be the time to change the inclination of his orbit. you can usually go from equitorial to polar for very little dV depending on size of the rescue ship. If he can get the orbit ballpark close to the target prior to circularizing, he will spend mountains less dV matching the destination orbit than if he had circularized first.    after he has the ballpark orbit, go to PE and barely circularize, like you said and continue on with your instructions."

KerbalAcademy,354u9y,tbojustin,2,Wed May 13 14:47:13 2015 UTC,I can match inclination and circularize my orbits with no problem.  I then retro or prograde burn to get a single orbit intersect easily.  The problem now is that it takes a crazy long burn to get a close intercept and results in a wildly elliptical orbit that I can't correct fast enough when we meet.  What is the trick to timing when to do the orbit intersect burn?
KerbalAcademy,354u9y,SixInchesAtATime,1 point,Thu May 7 19:53:32 2015 UTC,"the above comment from /u/tbojustin has the best example. i take it a step further, i aim for a initial intercept under 4km. i kill relative velocity to the target. then i burn towards the target at about 1% of the difference, usually 5-10m/s something smallish. check map view and your next intercept should be about 1/4 the way through your orbit. fast forward and kill relative / accelerate towards the target again. rinse and repeat until you get a intercept roughly 200ms from the target. then it's just a matter of using translation controls to get close to your target VERY SLOWLY."
KerbalAcademy,354u9y,snakejawz,1 point,Thu May 7 22:46:02 2015 UTC,First you have to burn retrograde to close your path and enter a stable orbit. Set the other craft as your target and take note of the ascending and descending nodes. When you are at the ascending node burn anti-normal (the way I remember it is AN=AN) and get your orbit on the same plane. You can also burn normal at the descending node. Then you have to judge whether you are in front of or behind the target vessel. If you are behind you want to make your orbital path smaller than the target to catch up to it. If you are in front then make/keep your orbital path longer. Keep an eye on the intersects and fiddle with the manoeuvre node positioning and prograde/retrograde burns to set up the optimal intercept. Once you are within a few kilometres you can fly relative to the target craft instead of the central body.

KerbalAcademy,354u9y,DangerAndAdrenaline,1 point,Thu May 7 11:58:23 2015 UTC,If for your first burn in that video you do not burn close to the descending or ascending node it is possible that KSP does not show intersection points. Also if you are in a higher orbit you should burn retrograde instead of prograde. But besides these remarks this approach should be a reliable way to rendezvous (assuming you will not enter another sphere of influence or an atmosphere).
KerbalAcademy,354u9y,fibonatic,1 point,Thu May 7 14:17:43 2015 UTC,If for your first burn in that video you do not burn close to the descending or ascending node it is possible that KSP does not show intersection points.   The first burn is a prograde (or retrograde if in larger orbit) burn. At some point the orbits must intersect. It shouldn't matter whether they are inclined differently. We're just looking for a single point of intersection.
KerbalAcademy,354u9y,DangerAndAdrenaline,1 point,Thu May 7 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"You are correct, but it might only occure when you perform a burn which makes your orbit hyperbolic (an escape trajectory), for example when you initiate a burn exactly 90° ahead or behind the descending/ascending node when you have a sufficiently large relative inclination. So I do think it can be useful to say to burn close either the ascending or descending node."

KerbalAcademy,354u9y,MrBorogove,1 point,Thu May 7 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"Your orbital inclination is pretty far off the rescuees', so you're going to need a lot of fuel.   Target looks like they're orbiting at just about 90 degrees inclination, and you're at -20˚ or so.   If the target is orbiting downward on the close side, and upward on the far side, start by burning at 270˚ (West) to get your orbit tilted to match. If they're circling the other way, burn at 0˚ (North).   Circularize by burning retrograde at periapsis.  Your orbit will be badly misaligned with theirs. At either Ascending Node (AN) or Descending node, burn toward whichever purple marker on the navball reduces the relative inclinations until the orbits are in the same plane.  Adjust your apoapsis and periapsis until one side of your orbit just touches the target's orbit. Then at the point where your orbits touch, burn prograde or retrograde to adjust how long your orbit takes relative to the targets -- smaller orbits faster, larger orbits slower -- until you catch up or fall behind enough to meet the target.  Mechjeb makes this kind of thing a lot easier."
KerbalAcademy,354he1,Oilkul,14,Thu May 7 01:01:51 2015 UTC,"I assume you're trying to correct your orbital inclination.  The correct place to correct your inclination would be at the ascending node or descending node, whichever is at higher altitude.  How much orbital inclination are you trying to correct?  If you try to correct too large of an orbital inclination in a single burn, you'll need to throw in some retrograde thrust to correct for the fact that you're adding velocity (Pythagorean style, so only a fraction gets added, but the larger the addition in comparison to the base, the larger the fraction that gets added)."
KerbalAcademy,354he1,Eric_S,6,Thu May 7 01:13:43 2015 UTC,"Another way of looking at it is that for an inclination change you do not want to change the magnitude of your velocity, only its direction. Changing your inclination by an angle i, while the magnitude of your velocity is equal to V, then you would have to apply a change in velocity of Vsin(i) in the (anti-)normal direction and V(1-cos(i)) in the retrograde direction."
KerbalAcademy,354he1,fibonatic,3,Thu May 7 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"Maneuver nodes are really futzy with plane change maneuvers because they assume two things: Firstly that your burn will be instant, and secondly that you will only burn in the prescribes direction.  For most maneuvers, the second isn't really a problem. A prograde burn that becomes slightly radial as you orbit does so slowly, and with minimal effect to your orbit.  In a plane change, you basically have to rotate to keep chasing your orbital plane's normal. Imagine flipping a plate upside down by just lifting your hand straight up- you need to follow its rotation if you want to accomplish anything.  The others have explained how to work around this, but I find it's helpful to understand why it behaves like this."

KerbalAcademy,354he1,WazWaz,4,Thu May 7 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"whatever you are doing, it sounds too complicated.  If your orbit is at roughly 0 inclination, I cant think of a reason why you would need to use anything but prograde and retrograde to adjust for intercept.    To get to Munar orbit is a fairly simple manuever.  Launch from Kerbin and get to a 70km orbit at 0 inclination.  At 0 inclination, you are in fine shape for a fly by.  Then just play with the manuever nodes, only adjusting prograde initially until you find a good intercept point, something that gets you within like 100k-200k periapsis from the mun.    You should not need to do anything else to fly by the Mun.  Learn to play with the manuever nodes.  I sometimes create and delete 10 manuever nodes before doing a burn.  And if you use Mechjeb you can fine tune a manuever node fairly simply, but its not necessary.    And for me, whenever im completely confounded by something in KSP, just have mechjeb do the manuever and see what it does.  Mechjeb typically will use the most efficient method for any manuever.  See what it does, and then go back and do it yourself."
KerbalAcademy,354he1,HODOR00,3,Thu May 7 14:10:01 2015 UTC,"The maneuver node arrows are misleading in that they rotate with the post-maneuver orbit, but their effect is still aligned with the pre-maneuver orbit.

KerbalAcademy,354he1,wcoenen,2,Thu May 7 13:01:08 2015 UTC,"While the node visualization does pointlessly rotate, the burn is still purely Normal (you can test this).

KerbalAcademy,354he1,WazWaz,2,Thu May 7 13:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, the burn will be purely normal in the pre-burn reference frame, and it is correct that such a burn changes orbit size.  The problem is that this ""pointless rotation"" strongly suggests that pulling the normal arrow adjusts the trajectory as a ""continuously adjusted normal"" burn does, meaning that you keep turning the ship during the burn to keep it aimed at the normal indicator. Such a burn would not change the size of the orbit, because a force orthogonal to the displacement does no work."
KerbalAcademy,354he1,wcoenen,2,Thu May 7 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... that would certainly be a useful burn type, but I can't imagine how it could be presented in the current ui.

KerbalAcademy,354he1,WazWaz,2,Thu May 7 14:56:13 2015 UTC,"You can compensate for the raised apoapsis by pulling on the retrograde handle a bit to bring the orbit back toward circular. It'll take some wonking around with it a bit to get it right; for reasons I don't fully understand, pulling back retrograde continues to shift the normal/ antinormal angle.  It does get pretty costly on delta-v though.  The most efficient way is actually to change your inclination while high in orbit, again for physics reasons.

Then you will see where your Ascending (An) or Descending (Dn) nodes will be after your prograde burn. Then, after your prograde burn, you want to set a node to match planes with the Mun's orbit; best done at the An or Dn somewhere between Kerbin and Mun.  This will be much cheaper in fuel (delta-v).  This is called a mid-course correction.  It's normally cheaper to change your inclination further from out from a body because your ship is going slower, thus easier to change the direction of the velocity vector."

Do a few orbits. When they're close, or they're going to pass you, then you get to start fiddling with burns. Switch the navball to ""Target"". Burn retrograde (yellow indicator) to 0 your speed to the target (or close to). Then burn straight at the target (purple circle) until at a decent speed. As you're in an orbit, and will never truly be going straight at the target, so you may need to repeat the above as necessary. Once you're within 1km, you can 0 your relative speed (yellow retrograde marker), switch to the target to be rescued, and use their EVA pack to RCS to the ship."
KerbalAcademy,354sev,Dave37,5,Thu May 7 03:53:11 2015 UTC,So switching to Target on the navball changes your velocity indicator to relative speeds?

KerbalAcademy,354sev,thegingerbeardd,2,Thu May 7 11:07:01 2015 UTC,"The guide I'm writing here is a little bit trickier (actually not) than the ""cancel speed, go towards target, repeat""-strategy, but it's much more efficient.  The tricky thing is to understand the nav ball fully and what to do when you're getting close to a craft. Generally when you approach a vessel you're travelling at a high relative velocity. You want to eventually get to no relative velocity and you want to travel completely towards the vessel. So your focus should be on the anti-grade marker on the nav ball. So everything I'm about to say from here on is relating to what happening on the navball.  Whenever you thrust, your antigrade marker will move away from the direction you're thrusting in. If you thrust anywhere within 90 degrees of the anti marker, it's amplitude (the relative speed between the crafts) will decrease. The closer to 90 away from the antigrade marker you thrust, the faster will it move away from you. The closer to it your thrust, the faster the amplitude will decrease.  Your goal is to keep the antigrade marker on the anti target marker. This means you're travelling directly towards the craft. A good rule of thumb is to have a hundreds the velocity in m/s as you're meters from the target. I.e. if you're 6 km away then a relative velocity of 60 m/s is ok, if you're 200 meter way, then 2 m/s is ok. This means that you're always 100s away from the target which gives you wiggle room. An other very important thing is to not panic. You have a very low chance of actually hitting the craft, so don't worry about it. And even if you overshoot, be calm. You probably just approached the craft at over 100 m/s, if you know glide a way from it at 10m/s it's no biggy. Take a deep breath and focus again on zeroing the relative speed and approach slowly.   Another thing to be aware of is angular velocities. Since you're orbiting and you and the target has slightly different orbits, you will drift relative each other during an orbit. In low Kerbin orbit this is quite noticeable. You will rotate one revolution relative the other craft in 30 minutes, and this phenomenon is why it's recommended to ""haste slowly"" when rendezvousing or docking in low Kerbin orbit. In higher orbits this effect is negligible.  But ok, let's leave the details for now and start at the beginning. The goal is to get two crafts in the same orbit and they have to be at the same place in that orbit at the same time. So this is how you do it:   Get into an orbit that is somewhat similar to the one you have to match. Set the other craft as a target. Adjust your inclination at either the Ascending node or the Descending node to match the other orbit. Change either your Ap och Pe to intersect the other orbit at one point. You will now get closest approach nodes which shows you where you will be and the other craft will be when they are closest to each other. Just merely pass the intersection node to see where the target will be on the next orbit. Now, adjust your orbit so that you the distance during the next closest approach is smaller. If you have an orbit that's bigger than the target orbit, the target will gain on you. If you have an orbit that's smaller, you will gain on the target. It's perhaps the case that you can't catch up in just one orbit, so patience, you might have to wait a few orbits. When you see that the next closest approach will be something like 15 km or smaller, you will start to approach, and when you've completed this orbit and start approaching, you should follow the procedure I started this post with. As you're getting better on this, you will be able to fine tune your closest approach to within 1 km with ease. As you approach, the speed dial on the navball will automatically change from showing orbital velocity to showing relative target velocity. This velocity should eventually be zero. When you've managed to park reasonably besides the other craft, switch over to it and EVA the stranded kerbal over to the other craft. The switch back, change velocity to ""orbit"" by clicking on the speed dial and go home. :D"

KerbalAcademy,351t3a,MacroNova,3,Wed May 6 13:19:13 2015 UTC,100% agreed. You want a perfectly equatorial orbit and landing so you don't have to time anything.
KerbalAcademy,351t3a,bobbertmiller,6,Wed May 6 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"If you aren't going to land along the equator for one reason or another, make sure you note the time in the top left corner. Your landing time.   When you're ready to leave, look up the planet or moon's sidereal rotation period- how long it takes for it to spin 360 degrees. Add multiples of this time to your landing time. You can jump right back into the command module's orbit if you launch at these times. You'll have it matched to the second.  Only trick is that... I'd recommend setting velocity to ""orbital"" from the very beginning and burning straight north/south as necessary. Don't want to let that surface velocity from the planet throw you off."
KerbalAcademy,351t3a,jofwu,1 point,Wed May 6 17:06:52 2015 UTC,Good idea but I have a question. What about the orbital period of the orbiter? Or are we just assuming a planar launch and later transfers?
KerbalAcademy,351t3a,HonzaSchmonza,2,Wed May 6 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"Right, that just gets you in orbit on the same plane. I personally don't have the skill to go straight to a rendezvous. :) Or at least I haven't tried...  It's not easy to calculate when you should launch for that, especially if there's an atmosphere. And it would depend on a number of factors. I've seen Scott Manley EVA Jeb from Minmu's surface directly to a rendezvous. It was impressive. He knew ahead of time about where the orbiter needed to be.   You want to launch when the orbiter is behind you. Waiting until it's directly overhead is too late. If I had to guess, I'd say to target the orbiter and launch when it's 45 degrees from zenith. Then keep an eye on map mode, playing with your pitch such that you get an encounter at apoapsis. Coast to apoapsis, switch velocity to target mode, and burn prograde to match velocity. That's what I would try if you put me on the spot. :)  The thicker atmospheres on Kerbin, Laythe, and Eve would change things since you have to spend more time going mostly up at first."

KerbalAcademy,351t3a,HonzaSchmonza,3,Wed May 6 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"if im understanding you correctly, Your lander is attached to your transfer stage by a docking port.  You reach mun orbit, a orbit altitude would be useful to provide better advice.  But you decouple and land your lander and the goal is to then return to the transfer vehicle, correct?  Well, typically, for a manuever like this,  id probably position my transfer stage at around maybe 60km.  Id then bring my lander to about a 25k-30k orbit, in the same direction and inclination obviously, and then create an intercept node.    I think theres probably a most efficient way to accomplish this from a landed position, but im not entirely sure how complicated that would be.  Really a timing thing, id think.  If you have mechjeb, its always a good idea to let mechjeb do the work, and it should use the most efficient ascent manuever.  So how it launches would probably give you your answer."
KerbalAcademy,351t3a,HODOR00,2,Wed May 6 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"The Mun rotates relatively slowly, when assuming that you do not spend a lot of time on the surface, then the inclination of your initial parking orbit does not matter much. For example the orbital period of a low parking orbit around the Mun takes roughly 40 minutes, which should be enough to do all the science and flag planting you might want to do. The distance you would move out of the plane, when you land on the equator and the inclination of the parking orbit is equal to i, would be roughly 22000*sin(i). For a 20° inclination this would translate to 7.5 km or an inclination of 2°, which should not be too hard to correct.  Now in order to judge when to launch your lander back into orbit you can look at the distance you covered over the surface of the Mun during your landing (so the distance between the point above the surface the moment you throttled up and the point where you land). You can use this as a way of judging at which distance, before the transfer tank/engine passes overhead, you have to launch. For this I do assume that you have a similar thrust to weight ratio as when you landed. It is very possible that your second stage has an higher thrust to weight ratio, in which case it will be better to launch later, also because it is easier to catch up to the transfer tank/engine in the parking orbit by staying in a lower orbit, then to let it catch up to the lander, because then you would have to burn into an orbit which has an bigger semi-major axis than the parking orbit, which requires more ∆v.  Before launching you should target the transfer tank/engine, such that when you launch you know in which direction you have to turn to minimize your relative inclination, namely towards the retrograde vector relative to the target. Once you are in (a lower) orbit you can make a maneuver node in which you burn prograde until the apoapsis touches the parking orbit. By dragging this maneuver node along your orbit ahead of you, you should see the predicted closest approach get lower. If not than you might have launched to early. Once the predicted closest approach gets below a few kilometers it will be good enough and you can perform this maneuver. Once you are near the closest approach cancel your relative velocity and docking should become more intuitive (burning towards to target to get closer ect.).  If your inclination is to big you might not get a predicted closest approach. In this case you might initially have to perform a plane change maneuver at your ascending or descending node to reduce your relative inclination. Lowering your relative inclination also help reducing the predicted closest approach."
KerbalAcademy,351t3a,fibonatic,2,Wed May 6 16:16:53 2015 UTC,"If you're going to land somewhere that's not in the plane of your main ship's orbit, don't undock and have the lander plane-change to line up with the landing site... have the main ship do a plane-change to line up with the landing site, then undock for landing.  Generally, you want the main ship's orbital inclination to equal the latitude of the landing site (so, if you're landing at 35° South, your inclination should be 35° so that you're not getting any further out of a more efficient equatorial orbit than you have to.  For returning the lander to orbit, wait until the planet or moon's rotation brings the landing site back into the plane of the main ship's orbit (if necessary), then launch in the same direction it's moving right as it's passing overhead.  This should put the lander slightly behind the main ship, with planes aligned.  Do not completely circularize your orbit...  keep it somewhat elliptical.  Set your Ap at the target's orbit then, once you reach it, bring your Pe up just high enough so that you rendezvous with the main ship on the next orbit.  A lower orbit is a faster orbit, so you'll overtake the target."

KerbalAcademy,3509of,ScottyBiscotti,2,Wed May 6 03:16:13 2015 UTC,I've heard of it but never checked it out... pretty awesome.  Do you have a pic of a simple one to build (I'm not ready for the Stock Kerbal X)
KerbalAcademy,3509of,marco262,7,Wed May 6 04:09:08 2015 UTC,"Asparagus staging is pretty easy, though you will need fuel lines to make it work properly.  The Build:  First, you want to build a rocket with a single liquid fuel tank in the middle.  Then, using 2x symmetry, add two more liquid fuel tanks with radial decouplers. Be sure to stage it so that all engines fire before the decouplers.  Then, put two more perpendicular to the first so you have a cross shape. Notice how the decouplers for this pair are higher in the staging than the decouplers of the previous pair.  Lastly, attach fuel lines to the tanks so they're leading from the third pair, to the second pair, to the middle tank. This image also provides a good example of proper asparagus staging.  The Launch:  When you launch the rocket, the fuel lines are set up in such a way so that the fuel in the third pair is used up first by all the engines. When that pair runs out of fuel, the engines will die, and you'll want to decouple the empty tanks.  Now, you're down from three engines to five, but they're pushing a lot less mass as well. Once the second pair of tanks are empty, decouple them so you only have the middle tank firing with full fuel. Easy!  I recently changed from a mostly-solid fuel rocket design to an asparagus design. Surprisingly, not only did I get more delta-V out of it, but the rocket is cheaper! I'd recommend giving it a try!  Hope that helps! If you'd like more explanation, Scott Manley does a great tutorial on it.  Edit: Added some more images. Also, I'm very embarrassed to say that is definitely not a Scott Manley tutorial up above. I just grabbed the first video in the Google results for ""scott manley asparagus staging"" and didn't watch it before hitting submit. :-( However, it's still a good tutorial, and I'd recommend giving it a look."

KerbalAcademy,3509of,marco262,2,Wed May 6 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"So what I think is happening is that each green fuel meter you see there is the measure of the total fuel available to that engine, compared to the total fuel capacity. So when you're starting out after launch, every engine has ""access"" to the 3rd stage tanks, and reports some kind of drain of fuel.  Right-click the 2nd stage or 1st stage tanks while you're in flight. If everything is working fine, you shouldn't see those tanks draining until the 3rd stage is ejected. Also, when you eject the third stage, the green fuel meters for the remaining engines should go back to full.  Let me know if you're still having issues."

KerbalAcademy,3509of,HODOR00,1 point,Wed May 6 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"Since all your engines are gimbaled, you're probably keeping your craft upright just by the engines alone, so when you drop that first stage and lose all that thrust, your craft can't keep itself up.  Try making the early part of your gravity turn more gradual, and see if that helps. A good tip I've heard is to keep your direction within the prograde circle, at least until 15k or above. At that point, the atmosphere starts to get thin enough that turning causes less drag, and your craft is less likely to flip.  Another thing you can try: Check out your center of mass versus your center of lift in the VAB, with and without all the stages. If at any point, the CoM drops below the CoL, your craft will be highly likely to flip over."

KerbalAcademy,3509of,fibonatic,3,Thu May 7 14:07:18 2015 UTC,This is how I learned it: http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Asparagus_staging
KerbalAcademy,3509of,HODOR00,3,Wed May 6 05:49:44 2015 UTC,"Asparagus is a very simple idea, but can result in a very complex design.  The idea is, dont carry weight you dont need.  Using fuel lines, you can make liquid fuel tanks basically draw their fuel from specific fuel tanks as opposed to the ones the engines are attached to.   This is useful because you can design a craft with lets say, one central fuel tank, and 4 radial, and you can make it so all the fuel drains from just the 4 radial tanks even thought the central tank with attached engine will be firing as well!  In order to properly set the fuel lines, make sure the line starts on the radial tanks and is connected to the central tank, which will make the fuel filter to the central tank keeping it full.    So why do this?  Because now you can fire all 5 engines, and then drop the 4 radial once their tanks are empty, reducing your weight significantly and you now have a full tank with one booster.  Now take it a step further, and the efficiency is even better.    Same setup, 1 central fuel tanks, with 4 radial, and this time instead of setting up 4 fuel lines from the radial tanks to the central tank, set up 2 fuel lines from two opposite radial tanks, and have them connect to the radial tank either to the right or the left.  Then connect a fuel line from those radial tanks to the center tank.  Each side should mirror the other.    Now you can drop the fuel tanks 2 at a time, meaning you are dropping weight earlier, and gaining even more efficiency!  Make sure you set up your staging correctly, it seems complex at first, but now i rarely do anything but asparagus staging.  And also account for any change in TWR between each stage.  In atmo your TWR should be between 1.2 and 1.7 I believe for best efficiency.    Once you are in a vacuum, your TWR doesnt really matter save it will affect how long your burns will be (lower TWR, longer burns).    Thats basically it.  What im explaining is a fairly simple design, but Asparagus can get very complex, and is an absolute must for returns from certain planets with high gravity.  The key for asparagus is to make sure whenever you are dropping weight, you do it symmetrically.  If you dont do it symmetrically, your rocket will become unstable as the weight will not be evenly displaced, likely causing you to flip end over end."
KerbalAcademy,3509of,TMarkos,0,Wed May 6 16:40:23 2015 UTC,With the new atmospheric model it will less effective as it used to be.
KerbalAcademy,3509of,HeadCornMan,2,Wed May 6 05:42:59 2015 UTC,It's still pretty effective if you add a nose cone. At least I haven't noticed a huge difference in effectiveness.

KerbalAcademy,3509of,Bananasauru5rex,2,Wed May 6 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"A wider rocket experiences more drag than a tall thin rocket in the new aerodynamics model. This makes it less effective than in the old aerodynamics model, but I do not know if there is a point where it is less effective than vertical staging.  The new aerodynamics model is much closer to real life aerodynamics than the old model, but in real life asparagus staging would not work as well as in KSP, because it would require big pumps to transfer all that fuel, which increases to weight of the rocket, and pumping this fuel inwards in a spiral will induce a rotation to the rocket, making it hard to control."
KerbalAcademy,3509of,andrewsad1,1 point,Wed May 6 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Well yeah I suppose thats true, but you cant make pretty streamlined rockets with radial boosters.

KerbalAcademy,3509of,Bananasauru5rex,3,Wed May 6 18:07:59 2015 UTC,"I think your choice of a Hitchhiker there is the reason everything gets crazy.  Without the hitchhiker, you could use 1.25 tanks and engines easily, keeping the cost and weight down.  The primary issue isn't your payload, it's that your final orbital stage is on the 2.5m sizing without it needing to be.  Try using a few of those inline pods if you need more crew capacity, I think you'll find it greatly simplifies things.  Then you can use the Terrier or Swivel engine with 1.25 m long tank and get about 2000-3000 DV for a fraction of what you're currently spending."
KerbalAcademy,3509of,fibonatic,3,Wed May 6 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"To add to this, if you want to go 2.5m, then just use a 2.5m pod that holds more kerbals. If you want to go 1.25m use inline cockpits, but make the top one the little black pod because it's lighter. First stage SRB's will lower costs. After that, I try to use the highest Isp motors available that give me a starting TWR of around 1.4 for atmospheric stages, and 1.0-1.1 for vacuum stages. That helps a lot with efficiency. Also, always use conical adapters when changing diameter; the aerodynamic gains more than make up for the extra mass."

You can put a few fuel tanks on there and drop the command pods on top. That's give you extra dV by having higher wet mass and lower dry mass."
KerbalAcademy,3509of,SenorPuff,4,Wed May 6 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"Solid rocket boosters are really cheap, and optimal for keeping cost down. So that first stage is actually pretty good for what you're aiming for. If cost isn't an issue, then you probably would want some kind of gimballing engine on the bottom.  Liquid boosters have higher ISPs, so are generally more optimal for mass.  I was just reading up on rocket stages, and I believe that I found that 3-4 stages to get to orbit is generally the best, and the mass of each stage should be 4-5+ times greater than everything it is carrying. And the deltaV of each stage should be roughly even, with more deltaV/mass needed for stages with worse ISPs (lower atmosphere stages). Someone chime in if I'm missing something.  Here's what I was looking at: http://amssolarempire.blogspot.ca/2005/12/basic-sizing-of-rocket.html"
KerbalAcademy,3509of,Eric_S,4,Wed May 6 02:01:40 2015 UTC,"Getting into orbit around Earth requires a lot more delta-v than for Kerbin, so this will affect the optimal number of stages. But the notion that each stage should have roughly the same delta-v and thus similar mass ratios is still useful when building rockets to get into orbit around Kerbin."
KerbalAcademy,3509of,Eric_S,2,Wed May 6 05:41:06 2015 UTC,"A good rule of thumb I use to figure out how many stages to use is this: the dV of your stage should be about 10 times the ISP of your engine, maybe a bit less."

KerbalAcademy,3509of,Eric_S,6,Wed May 6 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"Solid boosters are great, but the low ISP means they often don't make a good stage on their own. I use them as my go to when I my TWR is lacking on my launch stage and I'm only a little dV (~1000m/s) short of my needs.  My other main suggestion is to sort out that top stage to make it lighter and get some of your dV earlier. You don't need more than ~0.3 TWR in space, so always use the smallest engine you can even if you have to sacrifice a smidge of ISP.  Another good rule of thumb, is that each stage should weigh under half (and probably more than a quarter due to KSPs rather heavy tanks) of the previous.  Here is something I threw together with parts you should have available (note that those boosters feed into the middle segment). I emphasized form over function a bit so cost is not optimal (those cones could go, and it could probably land without losing parts if you placed some strategic girders), but my net cost for a launch followed by return a ways east of KSC was 15,000 (21k cost to launch, 6600 recovered). I had 1300m/s of dV when I made it to space. I have no idea why you wanted a hitchiker specifically, but I tried to get the same functional parts.  Adding all of the science gubbins, solar panels, a probe core, and antenna might make it go up to 30k or so.  If you wanted to take this to Mun orbit and back you could add some boosters for about 3000.  Design principles to summarize:   At the beginning of each stage, strive for a bit under half of your total weight to be fuel for that stage. (ie. if your rocket weighs 45t total, aim for burning 20t of fuel in the first stage). TWR should be 1.2-2 at launch. I normally aim for 1.3-1.5. Try for TWR of a bit under 2 for most of your  trip through the atmosphere. TWR can be as low as 1 for any upper atmospheric (>20km) or space stage, but if it is low make sure you have a high enough apoapsis from your earlier stages. Smallest engine within reason for stages used after achieving orbit. Fuel crossfeed or asparagus is great. It's like getting a free engine. In career mode, staging is kind of expensive (new engine, possible tail fins, decouplers, nose cones). Not always worth adding cheap boosters if it costs you more than the booster is worth to add it.   Edit: I re-made it in ugly mode here Using the extra weight to add legs and a bit more fuel. This flight I made it to space with 1500m/s dV and got back 8000 of the cost for a net price of 13,000.    Other variations included stretching the middle stage (3x4.5t tanks) and replacing the boosters with the large (23 ton) solid boosters at 66% thrust limit. This was marginally cheaper (19,930, or 12,000 after recovery) and had a smidge more dV. Getting this one to orbit is a bit more annoying though because the TWR is lacking once the boosters run out."

Is there a way to mazimize my recovered items?  Like, if I eject the bottom engines (making sure they are turned off).... right before I hit maybe 60km peripasis.  Won't they eventually fall back and be recovered? (At least some of them).  I may have to use a little of my last stage to fix orbit but if I do it at the tail end it's not much."

KerbalAcademy,34z4kl,TK464,27,Tue May 5 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Orbits being “perfect” is a bit unspecific.  Particuarly since there's more than one way to rendezvous and the perfect setup for one technique isn't necessarily a perfect setup for another technique.    Anyway, if they're both already in the same orbit, I'd suggest using one of the two orbit-phasing rendezvous methods.  Although in the future, not putting them into the same  orbit to start with would be more efficient.  EDIT:   It seems like I would just adjust my orbital speed to increase my speed to catch up, but I'm honestly not sure how or even if that's doable without additional maneuvers.   Counter-intuitively, you need to slow yourself down to drop into a lower orbit, and by virtue of being in a lower orbit, your orbital velocity is faster and that's how you catch up.  See the parallel-orbit rendezvous diagram for an example."

KerbalAcademy,34z4kl,HODOR00,11,Tue May 5 20:04:04 2015 UTC,Love seeing new players work this stuff out.  Matching orbits for an intercept is basically totally wrong.  It would be like matching speed with a car a mile ahead in a race on a circular track and hoping to catch up.  If your target is at a 100k orbit.  Line your orbit at like 75k.    Now use maneuver nodes and create an intercept path.  You will see these icons pop up that will tell you the nearest distance for your intercept path.  Adjust it as best you can until you can get the distance below 1k.
KerbalAcademy,34z4kl,Toobusyforthis,9,Tue May 5 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"You don't want to match orbits until you are very close, you need to have different orbits to line up an intercept, and then match orbits (i.e. match velocity) only when they are close to each other."

My tactic is to keep the AP or PE the same, but change the other.  Watch a few orbits.  When you start getting close match the orbits.

KerbalAcademy,34z4kl,SchroedingersHat,2,Tue May 5 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"I can't find the source, but this is attributed to Buzz Aldrin:  ""Down is forwards, Forwards is up, up is backwards, backwards is down""  Basically for large maneuvers (if your target is more than 50km away on Kerbin), you want to do one of two things.  Burn prograde (that's right, speed up), if you want your target to catch up to you. This will raise your orbit, and the increased height means you are both moving slower (you lose kinetic energy to gravitational potential) and going further (higher orbit has more circumference -- this more than cancels out your speed at periapsis.  Burn retrograde (slow down), if you want to catch up to your target, this will lower your orbit.  Depending on how patient you are, is how much you burn, also only make one burn so there remains a point on your orbit with the same altitude as your target. 10-20km difference is plenty for a low Kerbin orbit if you are not in a hurry, up to a few hundred if you're higher up. You can also look at a maneuver node to see how long it will take.  Make your burn and then create a maneuver node where your orbits match altitude. Click/right click it so that the two buttons come up, then hit the next orbit button and watch how much the target position and your position at next intercept change. Keep clicking it until they swap places, it's on this orbit that you want to make a final adjustment.  Time warp until your node, then delete it. Burn very slowly (or use RCS) so that your orbits are closer together (ie. if you burned prograde first, burn retro now, you should be able to fiddle with it to get your intercept under a kilometer (0.1km is achievable with practise). Once you do, time warp until intercept then switch to treating it as euclidean geometry (ie. boost towards your target to get closer), you may need to stop and readjust a few times."

If you are ahead of it and want it to catch up to you, go into a higher orbit.  Then when it looks like you are going to be very close to it at some point, change your orbit so it intersects.  When you are coming up on the intersection, you do one more maneuver to match the orbit as close as possible, changing speed and (if necessary) inclination.  Now you are close to it and going relatively similar speeds.  From there it's just a matter of using precise maneuvers to close the distance."

Since your orbits are so low, I'd set up a maneuver at the intersect point to raise your apoapsis and let the target come around behind you which will likely take fewer orbits.

If they are around the same point and otherwise identical, the nodes have no meaning. If they are tilted in any direction, the place these two rings meet is the ascending or decending node. Think about what your burns do. Burning in any direction changes your orbit in ALL places EXCEPT the one where you're currently at. So burning a bit prograde increases eccentricity (from circular) but will leave the one intercept point where it is. Making your orbit more elliptical makes it longer thus taking more time. So over several orbits you'll take more time each orbit while your target doesn't - you'll slowly get closer. When you ALMOST meet up on your one intercept point in the next orbit (the game shows you) you burn prograde/retrograde ON THAT INTERCEPT POINT (because, remember, burning changes your orbit everywhere except where you are) until you are as close on the next orbit as you want to be.

KerbalAcademy,34z72i,singularCat,2,Tue May 5 20:19:54 2015 UTC,"Think of orbits like synchronizing gears. You want the orbital periods to synchronize in a way in which both ships start from the same ""start point"" at a given time. That is your intercept, and you want an intercept to match up closely (ideally within 5km).  You accomplish this by changing your orbit size either larger (let's the target craft catch up, since smaller orbits = higher speed), or smaller (you catch up to your target craft since your orbit is now smaller and your velocity is higher). You do not actually need to match up orbits prior, although a circular orbit does help things significantly (you do need the orbits to be intersecting at some point however). The most important thing that is to match up is your inclination nodes. Ideally you want your inclination to be 0.0 degrees, or something very small.  Once you have the above set up, just adjust your orbit size until the intercept tab spins around to overlap. You can decrease fuel costs here by waiting several orbits to catch up / slow down, rather than burning one large change to align. As a general rule, less than 10km  relative distance from your target in Kerbin's SOI means if your relative velocity is matched, you can get there on RCS power alone. However, smaller distances are always better."

KerbalAcademy,34wi8p,joe-h2o,2,Tue May 5 12:05:35 2015 UTC,"I would say, especially with the stabilising fins. It seems SAS fights the new aerodynamics, which stabilises the rocket by its ways."
KerbalAcademy,34wi8p,spacegardener,17,Tue May 5 12:44:42 2015 UTC,"I've seen what I think you're describing on the oscillation, it's usually been because either the top of the rocket isn't aerodynamic enough, though sometimes that's just hard to manage, or the SAS is overcorrecting.  Limiting the gimbal range in the affected stages seems to help the latter.  As for the gravity turn, my usual gravity turns for craft that can stay at least reasonably close to the 1.4-1.8 TWR range for most of their flight is to pitch one or two degrees at 40m/s then follow prograde.  This puts me at about a ten degree pitch at about 3500m and a 35 degree pitch around 10k.  With two stages, you'll probably have a greater variation on the TWR as the craft consumes fuel, which I think would mean you'd have to turn slightly more aggressively.  I've heard of people doing a ten degree pitch maneuver at 1km altitude, and that's too much in my experience, but it might work if their TWR is high enough."

If you're doing stuff that looks like what we've done before (satellites, moon landings, probes, etc) you can get away with rockets that look like rockets we built to do those things.  If you want to do crazier things, like visiting every moon in the Jool system and coming back to Kerbin, or maybe an Eve return, you'll have to branch out significantly.    As far as atmospheric woes, it's just a matter of finding the sweet spot in terms of speed at any given altitude while keeping your rocket relatively aerodynamically stable.  As long as you've got a stable rocket and don't go too fast/slow for your altitude, the air should work for you and you'll be good to go.    If flex in the rocket is your issue, you might try extra struts or perhaps mod in Kerbal Joint Reinforcement (which makes joints properly strong as well as a few other things)."
KerbalAcademy,34wi8p,TMarkos,3,Tue May 5 03:59:31 2015 UTC,"Good advice on this thread.  Also, once you start your gravity turn, and your rocket is balanced, you can turn SAS off.  The rocket's stability should keep it prograde to the surface velocity."

For dynamically stable craft i'll often leave it off. and rely on aero forces to keep me facing (surface-relative) prograde after an initial nudge.  You can also disable gimbal on all but your centre engine (right click on the engine) and turn the gimbal down on your main engine (same right click menu, I just slowly turn mine down until the oscillations stop). I'd also suggest using only one of control surfaces or gimbal rather than both -- one of the winglet varieties has no control surfaces, as does the new 0th tech tail fin, you can also turn pitch/yaw to inactive on your winglets.  Finally, strut yo stuff. Struts will auto relase on decoupling, so feel free to tie those boosters on in one or two places.  In terms of crazier stuff, with FAR in the past (or with the new aero in 1.0), a basic delta-style launcher is my bread and butter. The main exception is really long payloads which sit in a giant fairing in the middle, maybe with a short stage for space operations, and four to six giant boosters around it that actually do the lifting. Sometimes you just have to brute force a super-wide payload too. One of my favourite crew launchers in 1.0 is a 2.5m 2-stage with a single 1.25m booster (think atlas 411).

KerbalAcademy,34w29j,MrBorogove,2,Tue May 5 01:40:55 2015 UTC,"I never actually include science experiments on my stations, it just seems kind of pointless. You're mostlikely orbiting in an area that you have already gained all the science from anyway."
KerbalAcademy,34w29j,silentkill144,1 point,Tue May 5 16:06:04 2015 UTC,I think a science processing lab could make sense. That way you can process samples you collected in a separate mission without including the lab in that launch.
KerbalAcademy,34w29j,PageFault,3,Tue May 5 20:43:21 2015 UTC,"If you right click on the ""crew hatch"" of the module that your kerbals are in, it will bring up a small screen that shows your kerbals and an ""EVA"" and ""transfer"" button. If you click transfer, it will outline the module you are in in orange, and any modules you can transfer to in blue.   Just click the blue module you want your kerbal to move to, and you are in... No hallways or EVAs required... Unless, of course you like living dangerously and want a quick stroll in the void.   I built a huge station by attaching multiple orange tanks, science modules, and metal structure pieces. I use it to store and process science from returning spacecraft, a refuel depot for quick turnaround of deep space missions without the need to reenter atmosphere and launch a new craft, and to trade out crews after long deployments...

KerbalAcademy,34w29j,JustALittleGravitas,2,Tue May 5 05:01:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry to ask this question in your thread, but what is the point of having science on a space station? Doesn't it stay in the same orbit over the same planet, therefore there is only a limited amount of science that could be gathered? It seems like it wouldn't be necessary for a permanent structure like a space station, and science is best recovered from a vessel rather than transmitted. Sorry for the question, but I'm pretty new to the game."
KerbalAcademy,34w29j,BallsJohnson69,6,Tue May 5 02:56:17 2015 UTC,In the new update the science lab can process experiments for long-term science gains.  It's a legitimate reason for an orbital station.
KerbalAcademy,34w29j,TMarkos,2,Tue May 5 04:00:38 2015 UTC,"But at the time you launch the station, you probably already have all the science from that region. I just have my mun and minmus landers dock at the station on their way back to Kerbin."
KerbalAcademy,34w29j,silentkill144,2,Tue May 5 16:07:38 2015 UTC,Science for the lab is separate. You can do all science normally and then fly a lab up to get the experiments again and do the long term research for more data.

In fact I think I had done one flyby of each and that was it.   I did one landing on each moon, and flew the experiments back to the stations. (the Minmus landing sampled 2 biome like a boss)   I ended up getting enough science from the labs to unlock the entire tech tree without leaving Kerbin's SOI."
KerbalAcademy,34w29j,gordie44,1 point,Tue May 5 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. The more I think about it, the more I see it used for more completenesses' sake than an actual need, but there are a couple uses. Mostly in that building a station with a science lab allows you to dock incoming craft in orbit and then store their science there without having to drop it back to Kerbin. This would be especially useful if you were, say, trying to gather samples from every biome on a planet or moon: park a science/fuel station in orbit, and the lander goes down and comes up periodically, docking with the station, refueling and dropping off its gatherings before returning to the surface.  More pragmatically, you need scanners in order to determine the ore and materials available on a planet to extract, for the purposes of, say, building a ship in orbit with raw materials. That comes in handy if you're launching to further planets and don't want to burn up fuel getting into orbit.  I'm sort of new as well, so this is mostly cobbled together."
KerbalAcademy,34w29j,AIM_9X,2,Tue May 5 03:56:16 2015 UTC,"Here is a Munar station I built in .90.  I tried to make it 'useful' with a science lab w/ science lander, a fuel depot, and an engineering wing for utility vehicles (probes and a rover).  The lander/lab could get science and the probes/rover could fulfill survey/temp/seismic contracts for funds.   I like using the structural aircraft fuselage to connect the modules - it isn't necessary for crew transfer (as others have mentioned) but it looks nice."
KerbalAcademy,34w29j,just_a_pyro,1 point,Tue May 5 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"Train design works best for mobile lab, especially bigger ones - you design station parts to dock along a single line, put some efficient engines radially(add some girders to space them out from station body) around the front of the station and pull it to wherever.  Then as long as you have docking ports on top and bottom you can  add any number of landers and probes to the train."

KerbalAcademy,34w29j,gordie44,1 point,Tue May 5 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Most stations have lots of unnecessary parts, mostly because there aren't too many parts to choose from that ""do stuff""....  Really all you need is a fuel tank/engine, RCS, power supply/storage, docking ports, a science lab and a science Jr. Add on your other bits like goo and your station probably won't do anything more if it had more parts.  Any more parts beyond that are just for looks in most cases. (I'm probably missing a part or two)"
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,tarrosion,7,Mon May 4 22:08:02 2015 UTC,"I've noticed my rockets begin to tilt a little when i do not use launch clamps.  I have to fire them off before they tip all the way over.     even a small tilt at launch can grow to a large angle due to gravity over a launch.  this is likely what you're seeing.  also, if that's not a thrust vectoring engine, the moment created by the capsule can do extremely little to right the craft.  valentine with SAS on is nearly powerless to do anything about the tilt."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,OSUaeronerd,2,Tue May 5 00:00:51 2015 UTC,"It is a thrust vectoring engine.  The rocket wobbles a bit when it first reaches the pad, but I wait for it to stabilize before launching.  But you might be on to something here - I tested rotating the rocket 180 degrees in the VAB and launching again, and it tilted the same way as before (west both times). Almost as if the launch pad (or bottom of the rocket) is a fraction of a degree off of flat."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,Eric_S,12,Tue May 5 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"The launch pad is in fact not quite level.  The entire KSP area is built off a perfectly flat platform that does not conform to Kerbin's curvature, resulting in the launching pad having a slight lean to the west."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,OSUaeronerd,2,Tue May 5 04:04:09 2015 UTC,do you have launch clamps available to use?  can you modify the SRB's so it will sit squarely on those?  if you leave it sitting on the pad will it tip over?
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,snakejawz,2,Tue May 5 01:39:31 2015 UTC,"No launch clamps yet either! The rocket as pictured didn't tip over when it was left on the pad. A bit of wobble when it's set down, but it stabilizes since it's symmetrically balanced.  I did try scooting the SRBs down just enough that they support the rocket on the pad, rather than the LV-T45. The rocket still didn't stay straight, though this time it didn't get as badly off center.  It's hard to tell, but it almost seems like when I hit the first stage, some of the boosters ignite a fraction of a second before the others and the rocket gets its initial tilt that way.  Also interesting to note that somehow some roll is imparted to the rocket. (Err, I think roll: the rocket also rotates along the axis which runs through the center of the rocket)"
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,joe-h2o,2,Tue May 5 02:29:35 2015 UTC,"i've run into almost exactly this same issue before due to the symmetry bug. go into the VAB, remove one of the boosters (decoupler included) and sit it down. Change your symmetry to w/e you want and re-attach it. save and re-launch.    occasionally there's a bug where 1 booster will not be part of the symmetry and the game handles it 'slightly' differently. also strut your boosters together helps with the roll."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,thisisalili,2,Tue May 5 20:02:08 2015 UTC,You can test this by putting a plane on the runway with no brakes - it will start to roll due to the KSC not being level.
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,SenorPuff,1 point,Tue May 5 12:39:36 2015 UTC,It is a thrust vectoring engine.   yeah but all those SRBs are probably overwhelming your attitude control capabilities. I suspect this is why you can't control it.

KerbalAcademy,34vh08,TMarkos,6,Mon May 4 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"From your staging diagram your first stage is all solids, so you aren't taking advantage of the gimbal of the LVT-45.  This may be Kerbal heresy, but I'd suggest less boosters <gasp!>.  You might try adding another LFO tank (or two) to the LVT-45 stage and drop down to 2 SRBs and move the fins to the central stage.  Fire the LVT-45 with the SRBs right from the start to take advantage of the gimbal.  You'll likely want to throttle down as the SRBs burn down.  This design would have less drag and likely more overall dV.  Also, in my experience the Thumper has never flown quite straight.  I have had much better experience with the RT-10 and the really big SRB.  (This is purely anecdotal - I have no data to back this up.)"
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,MondayMonkey1,3,Tue May 5 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"Are your fins clipping through your SRBs there?  Maybe try the SRBs between the fins, part clipping can cause odd issues at times.  Also, not able to math out how much those SRBs are giving you but it seems like that would have a pretty good TWR.  Maybe try toning down the thrust limiter on the SRBs to slow your progress through the atmosphere and reduce the aero stresses until you're higher up.  The new aero model correctly changes drag forces at supersonic speeds, so if you go too fast your CoL shifts and it can cause issues."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,NADER_THE_GATOR,1 point,Mon May 4 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, not clipping, just the tiny fins attached right to the SRBs! (And another set on the main stage.)  The thrust limiter is set so that the rocket launches with a TWR of ~1.4. Too high?"
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,number2301,2,Tue May 5 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"No, that should be fine.  I normally use 1.7, actually."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,MacroNova,1 point,Tue May 5 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually if I limit the thrust less the rocket is straighter by the time the SRBs burn out."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,notgoingtotellyou,2,Tue May 5 02:29:55 2015 UTC,"You want to be going as fast as you can without incurring crazy supersonic drag shenanigans.  The faster you're going, the more force the air exerts on those fins and the more stable your stabilizing features can keep you.    Pro move in this case would be to swap out those tiny fins for something like the AV-R8 that can actually steer.  You'll take drag losses, but you'll be able to orient yourself any which way you please."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,notgoingtotellyou,3,Tue May 5 02:42:36 2015 UTC,"If your SRBs overpower gimbaled engines, they can cause a compounding de-stabilization.  Try adding more control surfaces, SAS and/or gimbaled engines to try to restore control."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,Vadhakara,3,Tue May 5 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"Your thrust is to high and center of mass too low, also I'd say add bigger wings for better aerodynamic control.  When you're going from the thick part of the atmosphere to a thinner part, make sure you reduce thrust or you rocket will flip  For now just try less thrust and see how that goes"
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,Vadhakara,3,Tue May 5 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. You've got a high twr at launch and it'll only rise with those huge srbs.   With new aero, you can launch at 1.3 twr easily, the reduced speed will help you keep straight.   Larger fins, especially ones with control surfaces would help a lot as well.   In general terms, the point of srbs is that they give a lot of thrust. With that rocket I would look to have less srbs, and a bigger core / upper stage."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,divad1978,2,Tue May 5 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"Your launchpad is tier 2? That could be the problem. The tier 2 launchpad is bugged right now - it kinda acts sticky for some rockets. Going back to the VAB, moving some things around, and putting them back can fix it. I just upgraded to tier 3.  Otherwise, what other people said: your center of mass is a little low. Use the bigger fins on the boosters and put the smaller ones at the bottom of the main stack so the rocket still has drag when you drop the boosters."
KerbalAcademy,34vh08,Bonesplitter,1 point,Tue May 5 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what a sticky launchpad means, but definitely the way the rocket performs makes me think of slight bugs or even compounded floating point error.  Anyway, what's the preferred way to raise the center of mass? The only obvious thing I can think of is an empty fuel tank on the bottom, which seems excessive."
KerbalAcademy,34ut23,BallsJohnson69,13,Mon May 4 19:10:55 2015 UTC,"Most definitely possible. A few pointers...   Make sure the probe actually has a probe core part. One of the unmanned parts under the ""Command"" tab. If it's just the engine and whatever other pieces without a probe to control it then you certainly can't do anything after detaching it. I assume you realize this, but just in case... :) Probes need a constant supply of power to stay operable. If you leave a probe without a power source, go do something else, and come back, it will have used power. If it runs out, you won't be able to control it. Keep an eye on ""Electric Charge"" under your resources. You should still be able to ""Fly"" it from the Space Center, but it won't respond to any input. Make sure that your probe has a battery and solar panels! The battery is there to store plenty of extra charge in case you find yourself hidden from the sun. The solar panels are there to keep the battery full."
KerbalAcademy,34ut23,jofwu,3,Mon May 4 20:32:21 2015 UTC,"it takes time, but the careful dance of managing power with a probe is really important.  Every probe should be able to generate as much energy as it can expend.  However, dont forget it takes power to open solar panels.  So it typically a good idea to put some regular, always exposed solar panels on your vessel in case.   however, I dont like that because it makes my ship look ugly.  I like the deployable solar panels better, but sometimes I screw up and forget to deploy them before i run out of energy leaving my probe dead in orbit.  However theres a simple trick.  Disable the power in the probe core.  Every probe comes with power.  You can lock that power and make it no usable.  So if your other battery runs out, you can activate this energy and quickly deploy your solar panels.    Honestly, you should do this with every probe, its a smart safety measure."
KerbalAcademy,34ut23,HODOR00,2,Wed May 6 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"+1  You right click the probe (also works with a spare battery), look for the Electric Charge resource bar, and click the red icon on the right side of the bar. Click again to re-enable usage. So you do this and if the probe dies on you (i.e. all other power sources are drained and you don't have solar panels deployed or facing the sun), then turn that power back on and use it to quickly get some sunlight on those solar panels."
KerbalAcademy,34ut23,jofwu,8,Wed May 6 16:55:37 2015 UTC,You should be able to control the probe as long as it has a unmanned probe on it.. Can you post a picture of the craft?
KerbalAcademy,34ut23,Mrpeanutateyou,4,Mon May 4 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"You need the probe core on the part you are going to fly. Once you have your orbit, you can decouple your two craft.  You will control the root part by default, but you can hit [ and ] to switch to the other ship."
KerbalAcademy,34ut23,FellKnight,2,Mon May 4 20:41:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, you probably need a pwoer source like others have said. But also there is no such thing as too small of an engine for coming back from minimus, unless you need a bus."
KerbalAcademy,34ut23,JustALittleGravitas,3,Mon May 4 22:35:19 2015 UTC,"Challenge accepted.   Mk 2 command pod and smallest 2.5m tank by ""Ant"" engine.   I suspect it's not quite enough thrust. ;)"
KerbalAcademy,34ut23,joe-h2o,1 point,Tue May 5 12:42:35 2015 UTC,That's just bad design though. A lighter command pod will do it just fine (though it'll be just as time consuming as going there in the first place was).

KerbalAcademy,34uni8,snakejawz,2,Mon May 4 22:43:11 2015 UTC,"Like what you are doing, just a tip:  You can place your flaps and reverse flaps inside each other with the offset tool. Giving you that ""real aircraft"" look when deployed. In flight they behave as normal but when you then press brake, they split. It looks much more realistic IMO."
KerbalAcademy,34uni8,HonzaSchmonza,3,Tue May 5 12:04:26 2015 UTC,"Not all aircraft do the split for breaking, and occasionally the surfaces are further up the chord of the wing on the top and bottom, not on the trailing edge. But yeah, it does look pretty neat when you do that."

KerbalAcademy,34uni8,BeetlecatOne,3,Mon May 4 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"Unless you're putting your flaps very close to the center of mass, they're not going to work well as flaps."
KerbalAcademy,34uni8,RoboRay,1 point,Mon May 4 23:52:35 2015 UTC,"This is something I've always done (and is done in real aircraft), though I thought it was mostly done so you could put the ailerons at the end of the wings (giving them more leverage so you can reduce the size of the actual surface), and so that the induced drag from the flaps is near the root of the wing where the wing is stronger/the moment has less arm.   Is it that at the end of the wings the vorticies spoil most of the extra lift generated? I imagine flaps at the tips would make vorticies worse."
KerbalAcademy,34uni8,mattthiffault,2,Tue May 5 13:39:05 2015 UTC,"What I should have said was ""close to the center of mass longitudinally"" (the nose-to-tail axis).  Because if you put a surface that functions as a flap aft of the CoM, it will apply a pitch force.  If the flap is located aft of the CoM, it will push the nose down when lowered, and if you put it forward of the CoM, the nose will rise.  As to why flaps are located inboard on the lateral axis (wingtip-to-wingtip), yes, having them there is mainly because the ailerons need to be outboard for greater roll leverage."
KerbalAcademy,34uni8,RoboRay,2,Tue May 5 15:12:19 2015 UTC,"From a glance at the aero vectors from pressing f12, it looks like each part and type is individual.  Control surfaces have thier own yellow vector, and this seems to act only on the part. Having flaps certainly wont be ajusting the cl and chord of the wing as a whole.  They will do a reasonable job of showing the extra lift generated though, increasing the angle of attack on a control surface increase the lift of it, which deployed kerbal flaps will do. May change the moment arms un-intuitivly though, as center of lift may move back to flaps more than expected."
KerbalAcademy,34uni8,notepad20,2,Mon May 4 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's a good observation! I didn't think to look at the visualizations. So flaps and such still just act like sticking little oars in the water? Combining them to maintain control will still be key.  Without changing wing shape, can flying with ""flaps"" deployed still reduce stall speed?  --I love that a game about space exploration has me mostly playing around with aircraft. ;D"
KerbalAcademy,34uni8,BeetlecatOne,1 point,Mon May 4 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"yeah, what i seen was that say during a roll, one aileron would go down, get a bigger force, one would go up get a smaller force. This resulted in a roll, no change in lift of the wing pieces in front (which there should be).  Lift on the wing sections acts normal to the surface, so stability effects will be more or less correct.  It really depends on how stall speed is modeled. Having flaps down should increase lift on all wing sections in front of them, and allow a much higher angle of attack. From what i saw it will only make a little bit of extra lift at the back of the wing, which would be a poor approximation.   But I haven't tested every little bit, this is only a 2 min muck around."
KerbalAcademy,34uni8,notepad20,1 point,Tue May 5 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm really looking forward to the next iteration of FAR. Stock KSP has taken the old FAR way of doing things (which is way better than what it was), calculating part-by-part. /u/ferram4 is working on a new system now that generates a tight voxel representation of your aircraft and then does the aerodynamics on it as one whole body.

I put on one pair, usually the pair closest to the body, and set them up as normal, pitch only. Then, I put another pair on top (offset tool) and assign them pitch only, then I go to the action buttons menu so that when I press my brake button they open in opposite directions (might have to check the reverse button on the part and see what happens when you press deploy), just like on an airliner, and it feels and looks more realistic. Then with the offset tool I put them back in place so they are effectively inside each other and work together, but then when you press brake they deploy and one goes up and the other down.   I have had similar success with putting small surfaces (slats?) on the front of the wing, when viewing in debug, I get huge yellow arrows increasing my lift. These I usually tie in with my landing gear deployment.   edit It should be pointed out that from my experience, these are only necessary when building with the Mk.3 parts, basically when you go up to ""airliner"" or ""cargo"" planes. My bigger ""fighters"" sometimes have slats but usually not necessary. My smaller ""aerobatic"" planes have only the brakes with double ailerons. No slats needed really."
KerbalAcademy,34ul4z,Aniahlator,3,Mon May 4 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"Well... nothing really. Most of the physics in the game haven't changed.   Aerodynamics is the only exception... But I can't think of any equations you might have used there. Drag force and lift are now calculated differently... I don't think they have posted how the game calculates these however, and it's probably more work than you would be able to do by hand. And I don't know what you would do with that information anyways.  Is there anything specific that you were worried might have changed?"

Supposedly they use realistic drag equations, though how they calculate things like drag coefficients and how they apply the forces is anyone's guess.

Although adding fins will increase stability, it also reduces your ability to determine where that stability will take you.   Do a long slow gravity turn and keep your rocket top heavy. You can even turn off fuel feed in your top tanks to cheat this."
KerbalAcademy,34t198,Rekthor,1 point,Mon May 4 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"Since I use quite a bulky rocket for lunar missions, I've learned to work with the fins (since I usually jettison my second stage either in lunar orbit or when I'm leaving Kerbin orbit). The big rockets are slow as hell to turn in space, but if you learn how quickly they turn, you can anticipate when to turn on SAS and then you can make the start of your manuever burn and the point where your rocket meets the manuever point on the navball meet up almost perfectly, and then just throttle to full (since the rocket readjusts itself very quickly, regardless of size, when its engines are firing)."
KerbalAcademy,34t198,enzo32ferrari,3,Tue May 5 00:50:24 2015 UTC,Do I really need to add fins to stabilize the rocket? I'm designing my rockets to be very true to life and most of not all IRL rockets don't have fins
KerbalAcademy,34t198,ClockworkCow,6,Tue May 5 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"I find reducing engine power so you are barely accelerating gives enough stability for me to steer. Also, if you have fins, add them to the tail end of your craft to give it even more stability"
KerbalAcademy,34t198,Rekthor,2,Mon May 4 09:58:09 2015 UTC,"I can second this. Generally this loss of control comes from rockets that have significant upward thrust, but are moving too fast while they're too low, and if you apply a gravity turn to them, the forces pull down far too quick for you to control. Keep in mind, /u/MarkNutt1300, that any speed above ~200 m/s while you are below 10,000 metres is very fuel inefficient, since the drag of the atmosphere will cause you to use up more fuel than you need; you generally want to keep your acceleration relatively low in that first 10,000 metres and then fire your second stage and throttle to full while you're above that and you've begun or completed your gravity turn (for the lunar rocket that I use, I fire to full at 15,000 and enter second stage around 20,000, but YMMV). Keep the bulk of your fuel for both A) getting into low orbit and B) launching out to lunar or interplanetary orbit, since there's less or no atmosphere to slow you down and you get more bang for your buck.  If you find yourself having trouble all the same (this is probably due to a rocket that is too bulky or too long), tailfins are often the best course of action, and midsection fins (on a different angle) if it's still not enough. You can always attach the fins with decouplers as well if you really don't want the excess mass once you're in space."

When you leave Mun / Minmus, you want to escape ""behind"" the moon, so you'll exit the moon's sphere of influence the opposite way it is orbiting. Doing so, you can aerobrake to landing on Kerbin for less than 300Dv from low Mun orbit and less than 200Dv from low Minmus orbit. This image shows a proper Munar ejection that results in a Kerbin periapsis well within Kerbin's atmosphere: http://i.imgur.com/ccgtLxN.jpg"
KerbalAcademy,34tlll,joe-h2o,1 point,Mon May 4 14:39:15 2015 UTC,Is that yellow one where you will end up following the blue orbit? I'm still learning how to interpret this stuff... (do not have patches conics yet)
KerbalAcademy,34tlll,vmerc,3,Mon May 4 17:56:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, the blue line is your current trajectory in the SoI (sphere of influence) you are currently in - in the case of the picture, this is the Mun. When you reach the end of that blue line, you've escaped the Mun's gravity and the game puts you in the SoI of the next body - in this case, the planet Kerbin, and based on the velocity and angle you're at, it places you in the orbit you'd be in - which here is the orange orbit.   It's an approximation of what would happen in real life made with some large simplifications to make the maths easier and quicker for the game to be able to do - you obviously don't ""snap"" out of the Moon's gravity and into the Earth's, for example, but the game only calculates your orbit for the closest body, within a set distance from that body - it's ""sphere of influence"". These SOIs vary in size - Kerbin's is much bigger than the Mun's, and Jool's is enormous. The sun's SOI is infinitely large (you can't escape the solar system no matter how fast you go).   This means that if you leave a planetary SOI you'll be dropped into orbit of the sun and if you leave a moon orbit you'll be dropped into orbit of the parent planet (usually, unless you do some crazy ejection burn).   Edit: typo"

The closer they are the less stable your aircraft is, the father apart the more stable. But remember a lawn dart is very stable so don't be a lawn dart. Then make sure your landing gear touch between those points. When you move the control surfaces you're aircraft pivots on the center of mass, i.e. it's the center of rotation.

KerbalAcademy,34sqrl,Minotard,5,Wed May 6 17:18:29 2015 UTC,Modern fighter jets have their CoM nearly on their CoL; the only thing that keeps them stable is their flight software updating the control surfaces hundreds of times a second.    For more pitch control add a tail.  That gives your pitch surfaces more torque (increasing the moment arm) by pushing that elevator further away from the vehicle's CoM; similar to a longer arm on a wrench gives you more force (torque) to twist a bolt.  An elevator further from the CoM can have more torque on the aircraft for pitch control.
KerbalAcademy,34sqrl,Arimex,5,Mon May 4 12:34:20 2015 UTC,"If you have trouble taking off at low speed it helps to move your rear landing gear closer to your CoM, just make sure that the CoM is still somewhere between your front and rear wheels.

It represents the principle that the difference between the aggregate work of the accelerating forces of a system and that of the retarding forces is equal to one half the vis viva accumulated or lost in the system while the work is being done.

Saves you the trouble of trying to rendezvous after a complicated inclination change, you can just wait for your target to come sailing overhead.  Same thing going from the equatorial orbit to the pole: burn just enough to get you into a suborbital trajectory, land, then take off to the north.  I don't know the math, it may or may not be more efficient (especially if you waste a lot of ∆v landing) but it sure is simpler.  Alternately, why not put the station into a polar orbit?  It's very easy to come in over the top or underneath the Mun for a 90° inclination.  Just burn normal/antinormal a tiny bit while you're transfering from low kerbin orbit."
KerbalAcademy,34r5tv,wooq,1 point,Tue May 5 21:19:57 2015 UTC,"Rule of thumb, bi-elliptic transfer orbits is efficient from 39 degrees of inclination change and upwards. More than 60 degrees and it becomes infinitely efficient, meaning that the higher the ap of the elliptic orbit, the more efficient.  I managed to get hold of an awesome script that calculates the ap of the bi-elliptic transfer orbit for you: http://i.imgur.com/AwuW943.png I can post the script if anyone want to but you'll need Matlab to run it.  So to answer your question, get into a low orbit, as low as possible. Since you're starting of from a pole it doesn't matter which heading you take. When you reach the equator, extend your ap to the edge of the SOI, then go there and make the inclination change, then go to the pe and decrease the the orbit to your preferred size."

KerbalAcademy,34r1ta,passer_domesticus,5,Sun May 3 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"You're doing pretty well so far, but you're going to want to make a few adjustments.  Your closest encounter is the one near your target's apoapsis, so I'd pick a spot on the opposite side of your orbit, drop a maneuver node, and try to get that a little closer.  You'll want to fiddle with it until you have an encounter that gets you within about 2km at most, less is ideal.  Next, when you're getting close you'll want to click the speed display on your navball until the word Target appears (instead of Orbit) which will change your navball to display your heading relative to your target.  Orient your craft to the retrograde marker.  When in target mode, the retrograde marker is the direction you need to thrust to in order to reduce your relative velocity to the target.  Plan your burn so that you come to a stop relative to your target.  You'll be close, but you'll probably be several hundred meters away even if everything went well.  Find the pink target marker (this will be the one that has you pointing at your target) and give yourself about 5m/s thrust in that direction.  Align yourself with the retrograde velocity marker and prepare to cancel your velocity out when you arrive.  You can repeat this process multiple times to refine your position with respect to the target ship."

One is easier (radial burn version), and the other is more efficient (prograde burn version), so take your pick."

KerbalAcademy,34qm2w,Rekthor,3,Sun May 3 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"Well, looking at your rocket it doesn't look too dissimilar from ones that I've used in the past.  However, your top stage is a bit heavy.  Try out a mid-sized 2.5m fuel tank with the Poodle engine rather than those radial ones.  The poodle will be lighter and more economical than the radials.  Trim your landing legs down to 4 rather than 6.  Ditch the monoprop in the capsule, you're not using it.    For the rest of it, maybe rebuild your lifter based on the lighter lander and try to use skippers rather than mainsails.  Aim for a combined pre-lander DV of around 5000-5500, which should be more than enough to get you off Kerbin and headed towards the Mun.    Edit: Oh, and ditch the intermediate stage on your lifter.  Have all engines exposed and firing with the exception of the lander's, as it stands you're lugging along an extra engine into LKO.  Edit 2: somehow I missed your revision.  My previous advice holds, just lose the monoprop off the lander.  If you really need it for landing then use the capsule monoprop or slap a radial tank in the service bay - that's an egregious amount of MP for a lander.  The Twin Boar lifters are probably overkill in terms of thrust, certainly not cost-effective."
KerbalAcademy,34qm2w,TMarkos,2,Sun May 3 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"I took your advice and removed the monoprop tank and thrusters, along with switching to a Poodle engine. You're right; they burn significantly less. I took the new rocket out for a Mun test drive and she made it to the Mun and back (landing included) with a solid 7 seconds of fuel left in the tank.   Oddly enough though, I saw this before your second edit, so I kept the Twin Boars on (I play in science mode, so cost isn't a concern). They fared decently, although I could probably optimize the gravity turn somewhat as I was still getting way too high apoapsis. I'm going to try various combinations of Kickback SRB's instead and see how they fare.  Thanks for the advice. I suppose it's mostly the matter of just figuring out which parts to discard and what's most cost-effective from the rocket. I'm 50 hours in and I still have way too much to learn."
KerbalAcademy,34qm2w,snakejawz,2,Sun May 3 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"i would probably also replace the 3 gray tanks with a single red one (keep the skipper), remove the twins and use a small pancake tank and a mainsail, then fuel pipe the outers to the inner and make sure all 3 engines fire at launch. I would also move your service bay up between the capsule and the heatshield, but that's because i like returning as much equipment as possible. /u/Rekthor is right, ditch the monoprop unless you are using mono engines for the return trip or something..."
KerbalAcademy,34qm2w,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Sun May 3 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"The mainsail is actually more efficient on the ground (albeit barely) than the skipper now, with slightly better TWR as well. Mainsail isn't always the best option, (eg, 3 skippers vs 2 mainsails), but it's pretty damned attractive now.  They don't need anywhere near that much fuel though, or that many."
KerbalAcademy,34qm2w,TMarkos,1 point,Mon May 4 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"I tend not to consider the atmospheric performance as much given that the effects of the atmosphere really only apply to a short bit at the beginning of the flight.  If that engine is providing my first 3k of delta-v, I care much more about the vacuum rating.

KerbalAcademy,34qm2w,joe-h2o,1 point,Mon May 4 23:06:40 2015 UTC,"As the other poster said, you're lifting a lot of mass that you don't need - I see you already swapped to a smaller upper stage with a poodle. Those radial engines are heavy and not very efficient.   You can significantly reduce your main stage and still make it - most of that delta-V is being used to haul it up into the air.   I built this thing to lift this over-engineered upper stage with detachable lander for landing on the Mun or Minmus.   The main stage is more than enough to make orbit if you fly a careful gravity turn (you have to hold it nose-high early on during ascent as it wants to pitch over too quickly).  I had 5x Skippers in this version (didn't have mainsails at the time) with fuel pipes running out from the centre stack. It's not the most efficient design - the centre engine runs dry before the outer four, for example, and I carry it as dead weight for about 25 seconds, but I was pleased with it as a mid-career design.   With the 5 Skippers the upper stage doesn't quite have enough to do a Munar transfer and I had to use some of the fuel in the command module upper stage, but once I unlocked the Mainsail I replaced just the centre engine of the quintet with one of those and it faired much better.   The main problem with massively unwieldy launch stages is they're hard to control so they tend to go straight up so you get those really steep, high-Ap trajectories.   If you make a slimmer rocket you'll find it easier to get it to pitch over so you can fly a more efficient gravity turn."

KerbalAcademy,34petf,SenorPuff,2,Sun May 3 10:38:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, except for the amount to pitch over.  My standard tourist to orbit craft has a TWR that varies between 1.4 and 1.8 (each stage starts at about 1.4 and hits 1.8 about the time it's time to stage), and  I tip about 1 degree at 40m/s or so.  I manually follow the prograde till it tips a few more degrees, and then turn on ""follow prograde"" SAS if my pilot can do it.  I hit 10 degrees pitch at about 3500m altitude, and 35 degrees pitch at about 10km altitude.  As it turns out, this is turning this specific craft just slightly too fast, my orbital stage has to thrust above the prograde for a little bit to get my apo up to 75km or so while it's still a minute ahead of me.  On the other hand, this varies by rocket, especially by TWR.  The higher the TWR, the farther your initial pitch has to be."

KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,stickmanDave,1 point,Sun May 3 14:14:47 2015 UTC,Aerodynamics are different now.  I don't think you can do that anymore.
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,Izinqt,1 point,Sun May 3 15:09:52 2015 UTC,"I have done it in 1.0, I thought I wouldn't be able to but apparently it worked (relative small craft though)."
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,NPShabuShabu,1 point,Sun May 3 16:34:10 2015 UTC,Try with 1.0.2 and let us know how it went.
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,Dope_Witch,2,Tue May 5 17:42:55 2015 UTC,This is happening to me too
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,Izinqt,2,Sun May 3 04:05:16 2015 UTC,Your problem is that they are located on the sides so are not fully protected by the heat shield. Put them on the top of the craft or inside a service bay and they should survive.
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,ksheep,2,Sun May 3 14:16:19 2015 UTC,Deployed or undeployed? Which type of parachute? Where on the craft are you placing it? Pictures of the design and how you're reentering could help us figure out what's going on.
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,JustALittleGravitas,3,Sun May 3 02:18:08 2015 UTC,"Undeployed. Happened around 40km. I've put a parachute on the nose, as well as radially on the side of the command pod. And tried both at the same time. A few seconds into re-entry, they just get destroyed."
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,ksheep,6,Sun May 3 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"Are you pointing you heat shield retrograde? They don't do much if they're not acting as an actual shield. blowing at 40k suggests you're nose down.  If not, could be a 1.02 bug, its fine in 1.0 and 1.01."
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,roman2440,2,Sun May 3 04:21:00 2015 UTC,"What version are you running? It seems that there were some tweaks to reentry physics with the 1.0.1/1.0.2 update (haven't had a chance to play around with it myself, so not sure if this is the cause)."
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,ksheep,1 point,Sun May 3 02:36:00 2015 UTC,"1.0.2  I thought it might be that, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't just completely screwing up my ship builds."

KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,MrGuppies,3,Sun May 3 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"The before pictures show the chutes as deployed (that is why they are blue).  Right click on the chute module and you'll get settings for when it actually fires off (in 1.0.2 they fire off automatically when pressure or altitude matches the settings).    Likely you have the default setting of 0.1 Pressure, which means it'll auto deploy at one of the worst times for re-entry.    There are two ways to fix this.  A) Put the chutes in their own stage and don't hit space until the aero braking is done.  Or B) use the pressure slider to raise the minimum pressure for triggering on the chutes to a much higher amount (forcing you to go deeper into the atmosphere before it activates).  Note, both of these can be done in flight."
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,m4xxp0wer,1 point,Wed May 6 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"Have you tried with the heat shield pointing towards the ground instead of straight towards your prograde? I want to say that this should provide lift, keeping you higher, slowing you down slower, and cause less heating… or so I've heard. Going off of you picture, it looks more like you're pushing yourself deeper, slowing down faster, and experiencing more heating."
KerbalAcademy,34ojqq,m4xxp0wer,1 point,Sun May 3 15:28:19 2015 UTC,"I had a similar problem with one of my ships. I had 4 radially mounted chutes right at the back and my heatshield on prograde at the front. This was returning from mun, I had quite a shallow re entry and I seemed to spend so long coming down that eventually things just overheated and exploded. I also accidentally quicksaved just as I was about to hit the atmosphere. My solution in the end was to go in as normal but when flames occurred, I turned my ship sideways as much as I could, the result was that things heated up more quickly overall but the extra drag slowed me down fast enough for it not to be fatal. Powersliding through re entry...HARDCORE!"

KerbalAcademy,34ohxp,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Sun May 3 04:54:02 2015 UTC,"Also, heat shields will absorb the heat and ablate just like reentry (for now at least). Both a problem and a potential advantage there."
KerbalAcademy,34ohxp,FaceDeer,1 point,Sun May 3 06:13:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you could do that.  The most effective (and unrealistic) use is to just use them to wall off the hot parts from the unhot parts.  It has a very small thermal mass, which means that it would function like an airgap in a thermos - it would ""heat up"" but it'd store so little energy in the process that the other side would remain relatively unaffected.  The less effective but more realistic way is to use them as radiators, mounted radially on the hot part.  This might actually bear some resemblance to an effective real-life evaporative cooling system, but it's bulkier and doesn't insulate the other ship parts.  Also, I don't believe there's an effective way to mount them directly to the hot part (excepting a single one on one side of an ISRU), so you have to deal with decouplers or trusses as an intermediary.  This will add additional points of failure and impact the efficiency of the system as a whole."
KerbalAcademy,34ohxp,FaceDeer,1 point,Sun May 3 14:57:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so unrealistic to be able to design a ship with a thermal barrier in it. It still only solves half the problem, too, since the heat-generating part still gets super hot."
KerbalAcademy,34ohxp,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Sun May 3 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think the insulative part is unrealistic, but a heat shield with stuff on either side of it wouldn't be able to cool itself by shedding the ablative coating."
KerbalAcademy,34ohxp,snakejawz,1 point,Sun May 3 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"True, you wouldn't be able to repurpose a reentry heat shield for that. But in real life you could probably redesign it into a part with the exact same shape and mass that can boil off coolant through vents in the edges or something, so I still wouldn't begrudge someone who used it that way in a design. Sort of like how people are using airfoils or solar panels as impromptu radiators right now.  Ideally there'd be purpose-built parts intended as ""insulated barrier"" and ""radiator vane"", and I wouldn't be surprised if those get added to stock at some point, but in the meantime we cobble together what we can. :)"
KerbalAcademy,34ohxp,snakejawz,1 point,Sun May 3 19:48:24 2015 UTC,"So I did a test based on this, and the same principles can be used to to save a bit of cash recovering parts. Instead of popping the engine off to use the heat shield for protection I left it on, and landed with no loss of parts, engine/landing gear/fuel tank barely got warm. I think the landing gear (three heavy duty legs, the thing is a bus) radiated the heat off."
KerbalAcademy,34obco,Aterius,5,Sun May 3 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are using guides updated for 1.0. Check Scott's most recent video about ascent trajectories to make sure you aren't wasting too much fuel. Keep your apoapsis below 100k. To reenter the atmosphere, you only need to get your periapsis below 50k, and let the air do the rest. Technically you can have it higher, but you will spend many many orbits slowly bleeding off speed.  Fins are just to keep your rocket from flipping over.   Keep practising. Eventually you will get the hang of it, and orbiting will become routine!"
KerbalAcademy,34obco,mooglinux,3,Sun May 3 03:41:06 2015 UTC,i have found SRB to be a bit of a nightmare  better to make an external booster from 2 fuel tanks and a swivel engine imo  remember to coast once your max orbit height is over 70k and only burn when you reach this height
KerbalAcademy,34obco,cputnik,2,Sun May 3 10:58:20 2015 UTC,What I have is a SRB surrounded by a few SRB (the tall ones)  as a lower stage then my swivel liquid engine takes over.   I burn prograde at my apoposis but the orbit takes forever to grow (can't seem to get speed high enough)
KerbalAcademy,34obco,cputnik,2,Sun May 3 11:42:25 2015 UTC,"yeah im not sure mate,  ive been playing it on science so i dont have the same height and weight limitations    i've only just started playing but, apparently the new update has changed the game significantly when within the earths atmosphere, so the old technique of turning right 45 degress at 10k isnt really appropriate any more  i find, in my 3 stage rocket, that its only once i have jettisoned stage 3 and 2 that i can achieve orbit. stage 2 gets me close but the craft is just too heavy at that point, even tho stage 2 has 3 engines"
KerbalAcademy,34obco,krysztov,1 point,Sun May 3 12:55:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  it seems the early science stuff. like the (45 science)  rocket stuff can barely make it.   I think I had my best results with lime 9 SRB as the first stage.  (I believe they had nose cones)"
KerbalAcademy,34obco,krysztov,1 point,Sun May 3 13:31:52 2015 UTC,"You're going to want your top stage to be pretty light, (since F=ma, the smaller the craft the more acceleration you'll get) and then you don't want to wait until you hit apo to burn.  Usually depending on the mass and the engine I'm using, I aim horizontal with 30-45 seconds until apo and put my engines on full burn.  It moves slowly at first but eventually you have to turn down the throttle to keep your apo from shooting off ahead of you and wasting fuel.  As for ascent profile, start tilting once your speed's between 50-150 m/s, and hell, I still usually just finish it to 45 degrees at 10k out of habit.  It usually takes me three stages to reach a full orbit though.  SRB's to get off the ground and around 10k, then a hefty liquid to get a nice wide suborbital trajectory, then I drop that weight and use my last stage to achieve orbit.  Makes for a much lighter craft.  I haven't done any missions outside Kerbin's SOI on this version yet."

KerbalAcademy,34obco,WazWaz,3,Sun May 3 20:11:15 2015 UTC,It looks pretty big.  Your middle stage has to push a lot of fuel up there.  Here's the craft I use for orbital rescues.  It was originally meant to take tourists on Mun flybys but it came up a little short.  http://imgur.com/WlcL5Sb
KerbalAcademy,34obco,WazWaz,1 point,Sun May 3 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this... How many wings do you have on it.? I'm assuming that is an LV45 on the bottom right?   Also,  I can't begin to imagine how you do an orbital rescue... Where is a good place to start?"
KerbalAcademy,34obco,narwahlmedia,1 point,Sun May 3 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"I usually put a fin between each booster, especially if I don't have a thrust vectoring engine, to help stabilize/maneuver in lower atmosphere.  So I think that one has three.  There isn't a hugehuge difference between the 30 and the 45, aside from the gimbal, at least as far as I've noticed.  Orbital rescues aren't too difficult once you get the hang of it.  Try to get into an almost identical orbit as your target, if it's in front of you, drop one of your apses a few thousand meters until you catch up, and if it's behind you burn higher.  Once you'll get closer than 2200m get your orbit back into sync.  Then switch to the stranded Kerbal and rocket-jump the rest of the way (best to be familiar with the eva controls).   It's a bit more difficult if you're trying to dock things since you need to use RCS controls."

KerbalAcademy,34obco,MailBoxD,3,Sun May 3 19:48:32 2015 UTC,Second stage is the problem - TWR of 0.84. Try removing fuel tanks from the top stage. More fuel is not always better.
KerbalAcademy,34obco,PNWHoonigan,2,Sun May 3 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"I know in the Manley video he has the 909 which he uses to make the circularization burn, but you should be able to get enough dV to make orbit. Are you calculating your dV? If not, maybe try Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb which will let you know how much fuel you've got. You need about 3.5k-4k in 1.0 to make orbit. Hope that helps!"
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,IDontLikeUsernamez,4,Sat May 2 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"they don't pay for the rocket. it's part of figuring out how to design a rocket that can fulfill a contract in a way you benefit in the end. some contracts may be just not worth it though.   you do get some money back when successfully landing and recovering a spacecraft after your flight though, the amount recovered depends on obviously how much of it is left and how far you landed from the space center."
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,plspirit,2,Sun May 3 00:48:56 2015 UTC,Ok that's what I figured but wanted to be sure. Thanks a bunch!
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,MrBorogove,3,Sun May 3 01:22:05 2015 UTC,"The higher your reputation, the better payout you'll get for your contracts.   If your mission allows you to recover all or part of your craft, you get some money back on that, based on how far from KSC you end up. So if your reward and advance is only a few hundred, that had better be something you can return directly to the launch pad."
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,Aterius,1 point,Sun May 3 03:48:30 2015 UTC,Does this mean putting radial parachutes on your lower stages)?   What about the stages that you separate out of the atmosphere?
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,plspirit,1 point,Sun May 3 11:47:07 2015 UTC,"no, for that to work you need a mod (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-0-90-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-3-%2812-22-14%29), parts further than 2 or was it 2.5km from your active craft just disappear  those out of the atmosphere will continue to orbit kerbin if they are in a stable orbit, or if not will fall back to the surface and are lost (if you add a probecore or capsule to you lower stages you can fly them back manually to get funds back)"
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,MrBorogove,2,Sun May 3 12:23:07 2015 UTC,"I think 1.0 extended this to 20km, but that still is too short for most liquid fueled first stages. Solids usually burn out pretty fast so it's worth a try for those."
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,Aterius,1 point,Sun May 3 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks... Doing this is usually cost effective right?   Also,  if you are in a stable orbit is fuel for the probes a problem? (I never have used probes so I don't know)"
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,plspirit,2,Sun May 3 13:01:02 2015 UTC,"no probes are the same as capsules only without crew and lighter fuel works for them just as it does for the other rockets   Doing this is usually cost effective right?   depends, for small rockets it's not important, especially solid fuel boosters, the parachutes and control units add costs, so you have to bring them down really close to the space center for it to be cost effective. huge rockets though will get you quite a bit of money back that would otherwise be lost."
KerbalAcademy,34o5mc,Jim3535,2,Sun May 3 13:13:14 2015 UTC,"The contract payouts are highly variable.  Some don't pay much, and some pay a lot.  I try to take contracts that pay 50k and up and complete 1-3 contracts per flight if possible.  I think the better contracts start generating once you do a Mun flyby (or some other point).  Part of the trick is taking contracts that you can do and still turn a profit.  That's a combination of finding well paying contracts and not wasting too much money on the rocket."
KerbalAcademy,34npzp,Dinker31,2,Sat May 2 21:05:55 2015 UTC,I'm having the exact same problem. Keep crashing and burning.

KerbalAcademy,34nijc,StatSlag,4,Sat May 2 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"Surely you can get to a munar/minmus polar orbit without docking ports.  That will unlock several hundred science on each moon with eva reports, crew reports, science Jr and Goo, and thermometers."
KerbalAcademy,34nijc,FellKnight,3,Sat May 2 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"I can get to a polar orbit, but can't seem to build a craft capable of soft landing on mun/minmus with enough fuel to also return in one go, in order to get the science back.

KerbalAcademy,34nijc,thisisalili,3,Sat May 2 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"you don't necessarily have to land, if you do a low mun orbit and get EVA reports above all the biomes, that's 360 science, just from eva reports.  you can do minmus too, which is even more science I think"
KerbalAcademy,34nijc,Eric_S,1 point,Sat May 2 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"You do get different experiment results, but more importantly, you also get EVA reports.  The Mun is 16 EVA reports without even landing, and they're worth more than Kerbin EVA reports.  After you do that, you might want to consider going to Minmus before a Mun landing, if you're not up to that landing.  Minmus is almost as easy to get to as the Mun and is much easier to land on.  It only has nine biomes rather than the Mun's 15, but each Minmus experiment will get you about 40% more science than doing the same experiment in a similar Mun biome, and because it's much smaller, hopping between multiple biomes for more science on a single trip is much more feasible."

I don't tend to bother. One visit to Minmus (where it's easy to rocket around to different places, or just land on the edge of the Flats and you'll get 3), and you'll have easily gotten twice as far."
KerbalAcademy,34nijc,WazWaz,1 point,Sun May 3 12:25:24 2015 UTC,Where do you put all the Eva reports... Right now is can only store one... If am assuming there is a tech you unlock that lets you store more?
KerbalAcademy,34mowr,MakoFilms,19,Sat May 2 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"According to my experience in 1.02, getting into orbit around the Mun and returning to Kerbin required approximately 5500 dV. I recreated your rocket, and here's what I found:   Stage 1 (the booster stage) has a thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) of 3.56 and a dV of 1308 m/s if all boosters and center rocket (I'm assuming you're using a Swivel engine) fire during this stage. If only the boosters are firing during this stage, the TWR is 3.05 and the dV is 1053. If the boosters and center rocket fired during stage 1, stage 2 will have a TWR of 1.44 and a dV of 1851. If only the boosters fire in stage 1, stage 2 will have a TWR of 1.29 and a dV of 2205.  Regardless of whether the boosters and center rocket fired during stage 1, stage 3 will have a TWR of 1.33 and a dV of 1936.    So the total dV is 5095 for boosters and rocket firing in stage 1 and 5193 m/s for only boosters firing in stage 1.  The main problems with your design are as follows:   Way too much TWR in stage 1 in either configuration. Even if you cut it down to 2 thumpers, you'd have a TWR of 2.9. You only need around 1.5 to take off properly. With that much thrust you also risk overspeed conditions. You have too many parachutes for that vehicle. Removing those 4 radial parachutes will give you 400 more dV. It's better to do an EVA and remove the science from the materials bays than fitting heavy parachutes to slow it down sufficiently for landing. Even if you made it to Mun and back, your ship would probably flip over nose first during reentry (due to the center of mass of stage 3 being closer to the capsule than the engine) resulting in the capsule being exposed to reentry heat, which now means death. Although the 4 fins at the bottom provide control, the Swivel Engine and the Mk1 capsule have sufficient torque to keep things under control without the need for fins. You'll gain around 100-200 dV from weight and drag savings by removing them.   I'd really recommend a 5-stage rocket here. Use the same amount of liquid fuel tanks you have in stage 1 but reduce the number of boosters to 2. Then for stage 3, add a Reliant/Swivel and 2 FL-T400 tanks (or 1 FL-T800). For stage 4, add another FL-T400 tank just above the Terrier rocket. Lastly, add a heat shield just below the capsule and then a stack decoupler just below the heat shield.   I hope that helps. Here's an image of the ship I use for Mun orbits/flybys."
KerbalAcademy,34mowr,notgoingtotellyou,3,Sat May 2 19:37:13 2015 UTC,"If he cut the output on the thumpers to a little less than half, he would stay in burn better without running into overspeed problems.  If he moved the fins to the boosters, he could run the first stage with no liquid fuel and find himself much higher before hitting stage 2.  Point 2 and 3 are right on though."

Like OP I've wasted weight on unnecessary junk (which prompted the use of more boosters, which led to a spiral of clutter). I just tested a more minimalist design with great success. Thank you!"
KerbalAcademy,34mowr,IndorilMiara,13,Sat May 2 22:19:05 2015 UTC,"It could have to do with your ascent trajectory, or any inefficiencies in your transfer burn, or... Lots of things.  I think you're also just not bringing quite enough in the first place if you want to get back.   Idk if you're trying to stay vanilla pure, but my first suggestion is to install Kerbal Engineer so you can see exactly how much delta-v you have."
KerbalAcademy,34mowr,chemicalgeekery,3,Sat May 2 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"You should start turning your rocket shortly after launch with the new aero system.  You need to make a proper gravity turn to have a fuel-optimal ascent.  Scott Manley has a great video about how to fly into orbit.  Your top stage should have just enough fuel to get to the mun and back from LKO, but I'd advise leaving one of the materials bays behind to save weight.  Also, the inner part of your first stage is quite large, you could put another stage halfway in so you're hauling less dead weight from the empty fuel tanks."
KerbalAcademy,34mowr,wooq,2,Sat May 2 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"Tangentially related: put one parachute on top of your command pod, and a stack decoupler/separator and heatshield below it.

Once you understand Dv a bit.  Look at a Dv map, availible on the wiki.  This will tell you the minimum Dv needed to complete a mission.  I'm it's an older Dv map, pre 1.0 then it will probably tell you you need 4500 m/s to escape kerbin.  But in a 1.0 it's actually closer to 3750.    Now also work on ascent strategy and also know your TWR of your stages as too high TWR early makes ships unstable and waste fuel.   Start you grav turn at 100 m/s of speed.  The goal of a grav turn for me is to instantly circularize.  Meaning I want to thrust until in I'm a circular orbit at around 70 - 75 km altitude.    Ascent strategy takes practice.  And while the idea is the same for all launches.  Varying crafts will have some variation in when you start the turn.  But pretty minimal."

It is a scalar that has the units of speed. As used in this context, it is not the same as the physical change in velocity of the vehicle.  Delta-v is proportional to the thrust per unit mass, and burn time of a vehicle's rocket engines, and is used to determine the mass of propellant required for the given maneuver through the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.

To fix this, you'll need to put some fairly large fins on the bottom of your rocket, like NASA's dynasoar concept.   EDIT: Here are some screenshots from when I launched my spectre mk1 into orbit on top of a rocket. The rocket without the massive fins on it would spin out of control as soon as I started turning it, but the fins solved this issue completely.

KerbalAcademy,34lhxi,Entropius,3,Sat May 2 10:37:14 2015 UTC,"One thing I find useful when planning all kinds of maneuvers is to track the specific orbital energy - basically a measure of the energy of a given orbit/trajectory. It's useful because   You can use it to find the velocity at any altitude in your orbit, basically re-deriving the Vis-Viva equation. You can pretty easily calculate the change in specific orbital energy from use of a given amount of delta-v at any point in your orbit (extra bonus - you can demonstrate to yourself that the Oberth effect is a thing!), and from that figure out the characteristics after a planned burn. For example - you're planning a deceleration burn at apoapsis to set up an aerobrake - how fast will you hit the atmosphere after that burn? For me personally, it's a good measure of how ""far"" two orbits are from each other than can be easier than calculating the delta-v for the optimal transfer."

KerbalAcademy,34lice,Crixomix,8,Sat May 2 05:30:24 2015 UTC,"Inclination changes are most efficient when they are performed at the lowest orbital velocity. If you had a pair of ascending/descending nodes at the apoapsis and periapsis of an elliptical orbit, it will be much more efficient to burn at the apoapsis."
KerbalAcademy,34lice,LPFR52,5,Sat May 2 05:58:28 2015 UTC,"Whenever you use the ascending/descending node, the maneuver you are doing is a plane change. Plane changes can be super expensive in terms of ∆v.  When you make a plane change, you are effectively nulling out some component of your ship's orbital velocity and then having to add it back in some new direction.    For this reason, it is best to make a plane change when your ship is at it's slowest point in the orbit, at the apoapsis.  That way, the amount of velocity you need to take away and add back is significantly smaller.  For large plane changes, usually anything more than ~25 degrees, it's even worth it to raise your apoapsis almost until you get an escape trajectory, then to perform the plane change at the apoapsis when the ship's orbital velocity is nearly zero.  If you do that, it's called a bi-eliptic transfer, and it's pretty cool.    For example, making a 180 degree plane change from a 70km circular orbit would be easily more than 4600 m/s of ∆v.  But if you boost from LKO to the edge of Kerbin's SOI (~950m/s) perform a plane change (~20m/s), and then aerobrake and perform a small circularization burn (50-100m/s) you can get the same result for about 1/4 the price.    TL;DR Always do your plane changes at the ascending node/descending node that is closer to the apoapsis.  But learn to love the bi-eliptic transfer."
KerbalAcademy,34lice,waytoomainstream,1 point,Sat May 2 06:11:57 2015 UTC,"So bi-eliptic transfer is when you switch your orbit 180 degrees? So you make your elipse huge, then at the top, you basically just turn around and go the other way at the same speed? And then slow down at the bottom again? That's pretty neat."
KerbalAcademy,34lice,odnish,3,Sat May 2 07:20:09 2015 UTC,"Bi-elliptic transfer is when you send your apoapsis out nearly to escape and then do some maneuver and then slow down again. It's mostly used for plane changes, but it's also useful for crashing into the sun."
KerbalAcademy,34lice,waytoomainstream,1 point,Sat May 2 11:10:36 2015 UTC,"a bi-eliptic transfer dosent have to be 180 degrees, that was just an extreme example.  But yeah, that's the basic idea.  If you're on an almost escape trajectory, you should only be going ~20-40 m/s when you reach the apoapsis.  You could then burn normal/antinormal and easily switch the plane of your return orbit to whichever you want."
KerbalAcademy,34lice,fibonatic,1 point,Sat May 2 17:21:51 2015 UTC,I recently did the maths for inclination changes of circular orbits. It turns out that an inclination change of about 40° (arccosine of 7/9) it only pays of the raise your appapsis by the amount and for changes of 60° and bigger you should always try to raise your apoapsis as high as possible.

On top of that, Karbonite is in oceans, land, air, and orbit (sometimes).    But it seems Ore is superior to Karbonite in terms raw efficiency.  Here's a screenshot where I tested this.  All LFO, Ore, and Karbonite tanks here are the same size/volume.   The Ore and Karbonite in the tanks respectively weighed 3000 kg and 5000 kg.  So Karbonite is has a denser mass, making it harder to haul to orbit efficiently.  And to top it off, the Karbonite, despite being denser/heavier, produces less fuel.   The Karbonite tank filled up a LFO fuel tank of equal size exactly. But the Ore tank filled up a LFO tank of equal size, and then still had Ore 1/3rd of the Ore left over.   Disclaimer:  You may want to double-check me or investigate further, as I'm only comparing one size of tank here, and these comparisons may end up looking different with the bigger tanks.  After all, who's to say the resources capacities of all the tanks are proportional to their apparent volume?"

A/B/X/Y are staging, gear, brakes, and RCS toggle, in that order.  click left stick & click right stick switch vessels.  everything else controls the throttle:  lb & rb are incremental, start & back are full throttle & throttle cut-off, and lt & rt are assigned to the throttle axis (although this has only worked since 1.0 and im still playing with it).    In some iterations, i've made start do other functionality instead of full throttle, which just means you have to spend an second or two to use the incremental control when starting burns.  i've also used Y for the sas toggle, but i've found it more useful to use Y as the RCS toggle.  my goals when i set this up were as follows: be able to fly either a plane or a rocket to space and dock it without having to set down the gamepad.  this is why pitch and yaw are the same stick, it means i can launch rockets with one highly-intuitive stick, which eliminates the main complaints i see below."

Sticks are fine for pure plane games, but even KSP planes are more complex than that, and then you have rockets. I think sliders (like on a sound board) would be ideal. You could have them on a separate controller or attached to the key board. That way, you can finely adjust and hold a heading, as well as aero brakes and throttle. For a plane, a joystick would still be useful in KSP. I would guess that a small joystick built into the keyboard or to the side would be ideal; the keyboard buttons and mouse are still very critical. For translational, on-orbit motions, I would love a 3D mouse designed for CAD. They're very expensive though, so if a joystick has z-axiz capabilities or could be modified to have one, that would be perfect. I'll dig out my Xbox 360 controller and see how it works with KSP. If it seems worthwhile, I might build a custom controller with sliders and a stick using an Arduino with USB host capability like the Leonardo. This could be fun."

However, keyboards let you have easier access to the full range of controls.  For rockets in space, time pressure is almost NEVER an issue (if things are happening on timescales shorter than minutes, you're probably doing it wrong). However, joysticks can be useful during launches if you've messed something up or have a particularly borderline rocket to get to space.  For planes, joysticks are a clear win. Making partial control inputs immediately and (relatively) precisely is super useful. You do, however, have to make sure that your joystick/off-hand-pad combo has all the buttons you need for time-sensitive operations (gear, flaps, SAS-toggle, RCS-toggle, and action groups for switching engines from air-breathing to rockets are usually what I care about)."

Drag at the tip of your rocket will kill you a lot. 3: DONT over steer, your attitude vector should not leave you're prograde ball until you are over about 15-20km and then it shouldn't move any further than the spokes on the prograde ball until you are over 30-40km."

For example, if you steer in the blue area you will slow your vertical velocity and you will bleed more speed while you are in the upper thinner atmosphere.  Kind of like if you are surfing in the air.  If you steer in the brown area, you will go down faster.  If you steer left and right you can adjust where your landing will be somewhat.  With that in mind, you can really do multiple passes in the upper atmosphere when comming from far away before landing so you don't burn through.  Also, if you strap something under your capsule (like a science jr and a heat shield)  be sure you fix the bug as was mentionned elsewhere in this thread."

Something a plane should be able to do that a capsule can't though, is stay in the upper atmosphere by utilizing its relatively high lift. And if you can maintain a high angle of attack in your plane, I imagine you'll decelerate rather quickly once you're down to 20-30 km.  You can do a maneuver called an S-turn to bleed off speed. Basically, just roll sideways and pitch up. Then roll the other way and repeat. If you think you're falling too quickly then don't roll all the way over so when you do the pitch up, you'll generate lift as well."

KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,TheCreat,16,Fri May 1 07:29:03 2015 UTC,"Upgrading the launch pad isn't that expensive. You need to do one upgrade there to go further than just Kerbin's orbit. The VAB itself you could upgrade, but if I remember it's relatively expensive, and you can actually do a lot with 30 parts. You also want upgrades on mission control (more active missions) and possibly the astronaut complex (for eva capability).  You can also let a bit of time pass, new contracts will show up if there are only few available. There is a timewarp bar for that on the overview of ksc (where you select buildings).  I don't know whether that's an option for you, but consider installing Kerbal engineer. It allows you to see the delta-V that a craft you are building has, and therefore plan more precisely where you can go with it (escape trajectory, munar flyby, ...). There are plenty of lists/maps that show you how much you need to get to a certain celestial body. Note that this functionality was supposed to be part of the stock game by now (engineers report), but they didn't have time to finish it for 1.0, so it's coming in the next update (probably). Frankly, this information is necessary to properly design spacecraft, and not just ballpark/guess your way through."

Also, if you decline a large amount at once, you'll also not get replacements (I think).   Timewarping when you have very few will (occasionally) spawn new contract offers, that's what I meant. You can refill your list that way."

So, right away, you can do crew reports, and crew reports have one per biome on the ground, one per biome  at low altitudes (under 13K, if I remember right), one at high altitude but not in orbit, one in low orbit, and one in space high above Kerbin.  So that makes 23 sources of science right there.  When you unlock the ability to do EVA reports, that adds quite a few, because in addition to all the places that a Crew report can be done, EVA reports, in low orbit you get EVA reports per biome, so that's another 31 sources of science.  In fact, my first flight in every career playthrough involves a polar orbit as soon as I unlock EVA, because you can pick up all 9 biomes in two orbits if you're familiar with where they are with a very basic craft.  When you unlock the ability to take soil samples, that's another 11 sources of science.  The Mystery Goo canister gets you 11 biomes at the surface level and then one more for each of the four altitudes.  The Science Jr works in the same places as Mystery Goo, if I remember correctly.  There's also the thermometer and barometer early on, and other experiments later on.  Most of the science parts only pay attention to biomes while landed, but the negative gravioli detector uses biomes in both low and high orbit.  By the time you've done all that, you should be able to at least put a kerbal into a polar orbit of the Mun, which has 15 biomes, each of which get you more science than the Kerbin biomes.  Minmus only has 9 biomes, but they give even more science than the Mun.  By the time you get all that science, you should be ready for landing on the Mun and Minmus, and doing surface samples from those places gives bigger science bonuses."
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,ca178858,13,Fri May 1 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"Great guide but OP does highlight an issue that I personally feel has been a problem (albeit a minor one) throughout the development of Science/Career mode; the tech tree being slightly unbalanced.  Some techs feel really out of place, like you don't unlock a basic solar panel and your first ladders until tier 5 if memory serves; well after you're looking at longer trips and landings that need mobility and power for modules. This is the same tier that gives you advanced tech like better engines and RCS thrusters, whereas those two examples are fundamentals for most missions.  It's not a major issue by any means, it doesn't really hinder progress nor is it broken, but I do think there are some balance issues with techs in the tree that are unlocked far later (or earlier) than they should be."
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,OldBoltonian,5,Fri May 1 12:21:43 2015 UTC,Yeah- solar panels are huge. I basically can't go anywhere beyond LKO without them.
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,ca178858,4,Fri May 1 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"I managed to do a Mun orbit and return without them, but only just. I had about 10% of my spare battery left by the time I touched back down on Kerbin, but yeah they should be unlocked far earlier.  I think the tech tree does need a bit of a shuffle, some ""entry"" level tech like panels, ladders, landing legs etc. are unlocked surprisingly far into the tree."
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,wcoenen,2,Fri May 1 15:32:06 2015 UTC,yup- I can plan around no legs or ladders though. Not having a power source is pretty much game over.
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,bobbertmiller,2,Fri May 1 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"I did manage to keep a Stayputnik running on batteries until it reached the surface of the Mun, within the 30 part limit. It needs to encounter the Mun with a low periapsis though, there's no time for dawdling.  For a manned capsule, there shouldn't be an issue. Only the reaction wheels consume energy, so a couple of batteries is plenty to get to the Mun and back if you are frugal. Only enable stabilization with Twhen really needed."
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,WazWaz,8,Fri May 1 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"Uh - why can't you get to the moon? You don't need a ginormous rocket for that. You can't LAND on the moon, but you can easily do a fly-by. Same with minmus. You can also stack capsules to get more people on board. Just bring enough parachutes ^^"
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,bobbertmiller,7,Fri May 1 08:47:11 2015 UTC,Exactly - a Mün flyby takes about 25% more delta v than getting into orbit. A gentle brush will keep you returning easily to Kerbin.
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,FellKnight,3,Fri May 1 13:38:24 2015 UTC,I normally do an actual free return because I'm burned from the old remote tech mods where the rocket NEVER did anything when I wanted it to. But I guess setting up a free return to the mun is not something someone new to the game would think about.
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,Eric_S,1 point,Fri May 1 13:44:55 2015 UTC,"It's also not intuitive.  I've seen Apollo 13 several times and I know the figure 8 pattern well, but the patched conics of the game don't make it look like that diagram.  So despite 400 hours in game, I've never done a free return trajectory, though I finally believe that I know exactly how to."
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,bobbertmiller,2,Fri May 1 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"Right, the reason patched conics look wrong is because all the documentation on a free return trajectory that I've seen show the entire trajectory of the free return from a rotating frame of reference that keep the Earth and the Moon in the same position, whereas the patched conics we've got are drawn from an absolute frame of reference.  Because the craft never actually reverses the direction of it's orbit from Kerbin's point of view, you don't see a figure 8.  However, from the Mun's point of view, it is in a retrograde orbit, so it has changed directions."
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,clayalien,1 point,Sun May 3 00:53:07 2015 UTC,"It's actually quite easy and looks exactly like the figure 8. You want the ellipsis barely touching the Mün SOI, want to hit it exactly (not pro or retro of Mün orbit which is easy because the SOI is ginormous) and then just give it a bit more dv so you curve back. I only get a high Mün approach but get back to 34 km on Kerbin no problem."
KerbalAcademy,34hsbi,clayalien,8,Fri May 1 22:09:12 2015 UTC,"The contracts system is nice, and a step in the right direction, but not without it's flaws. It quite often asks you do do things that are far beyond your capabilities, and a lot of them aren't really fully updated to newer models (surveys above 19 km I'm looking at you). It's not bad I'm hoping they take a long look at it and revamp. I hate getting asked to built complex 11 crew roving bases on Duna before I've even been to Minmus or built a basic station yet. It's improved, but it can still be very ""grindy"" in places.   You can reject contracts with no penalties before you accept, and you will get new ones. You can even cancel after accepting. Most of the time, the penalty isn't much more than the advance, plus a small reputation hit. If your struggling on one, it's more fun to just do that. Make sure to read the fine print before accepting. Escape trajectory contracts can be difficult. You do get the part temporarily unlocked if you accept though. It shows up in blue as ""experimental"" if you haven't. The parameters for others have actually been reduced, often for the early ones, just launch the ship you used to get to that height at the start and slap the part on. 90% of the time, it should hit the height and speed limits at around the right time now.  If you have plane parts unlocked, it makes the survey contracts easier. Go out to the map before accepting and you can see the points. If it's on the same peninsula thing as ksc, it's worth doing, otherwise, just reject until you get turbo jets. Look at the heights required though. If it says ""under x km"", you can do it in a jet easy. Ones with requirements over a certain height require srb after burners to reach them though.  For tourism contracts, you can stick 2 pods together. Either vertically, or flip one upside down, which I think looks a lot better than the ""christmas tree pod"" The inline cockpit unlocks early too, but you need a heat shield for that. Then bring em up one at a time with Jeb or Val as a ""guide""(sas bot).  Are you using the admin building for policies? As far as I know, how difficult the contracts you get depends on your reputation. You don't actually want that to get too high too soon as a beginner. It's far better to set either the fund raising campaign or the unpaid inters one as high as you can, depending on if you need money or science more. If all you are seeing is 2, or even 3 stars, you might even want to intentionally tank it a bit with the rep to funds bailout and you'll start seeing 1 stars again. I use the interns. It's not much, about 1-3 bonus research per contract, but hey, it's free.  At this stage of the game, you should be taking the tourist contracts. Take the suborbital ones first, but rather than doing the bare minimum, push further and further with your designs until you can reach orbit reliably. Then do the orbital ones until you can afford to upgrade the launch pad, the tracking station, and mission control. If it's taking too long, or you get bored, you can swap over to parts testing or surveys. Then you can start on flybys. The contract for a flyby itself, plus the experience should easily net you enough to attempt an orbit. Take the contract for that, and a tourist if you can. You can do this all in one launch, but there's no shame in 2, or even 3 launches. After that, you should get you enough to upgrade the VAB and astronaut complex pretty easily, which will allow you to attempt landing. If not, take another tourist to a moon flyby, or sat contracts will start popping up, which often have good payouts. The mun landing contract pays highly too. Before you leave, hop back to the space center, upgrade the lab, then go back to your landing to grab some surface samples."

KerbalAcademy,34i1ma,enzo32ferrari,10,Fri May 1 09:40:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can do this with all contracts with separate parts. You can see every part has it's own reward, and then a separate one for completing all parts. Usually the final one is the highest earner. But they don't have to be the same launch at all. You could even for example take A suborbital, then realize getting B into orbit is just too tough right now, cancel it to free up a contract slot, and still keep what you earned getting A up. You will get the cancellation penalty, and shouldn't unless you really have to, but it should still turn a profit."
KerbalAcademy,34i1ma,clayalien,4,Fri May 1 12:05:37 2015 UTC,"I've started... whenever I'm headed anywhere (like my space station, or the Mun, or wherever) checking to see if any tourists want to go anywhere.

KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,SolPope,12,Fri May 1 03:41:10 2015 UTC,"I had problems with something like that.  I'm going to assume that those are LV-T30s rather than 45s.  First, you might want to look at this.  That will explain the concepts.  Basically, just before you stage, you have 1) a very high center of mass and 2) a very low center of drag.  When you stage, your center of mass doesn't move much relative to the part of the craft that's left, but you've lost all the drag that was below what's left.  This means that your center of drag is suddenly higher, and with that non-aerodynamic payload on top, probably higher than your center of mass.  There's a few ways to deal with that, only one of which doesn't involve changing the craft.  And that is to do a proper gravity turn, so that when you dropped the first stage you'd be right on the prograde so you wouldn't get any torque.  That's how I dealt with this when I was launching something like what you're doing.  Second, you can go straight up until you're at about 30-40km altitude, and then turn.  That's a pretty inefficient launch profile, though.  Third, you can try lowering your velocity.  The torque is a function of of air resistance, so it's proportional to the square of the velocity.  The other options all involve getting more control authority. Gimbaled engines, SAS modules, etc.  Be aware that if you add fins to the bottom of the top stage, you may need to add more fins to the bottom of the first stage so that the center of drag stays low.  T"
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,Eric_S,3,Fri May 1 04:17:01 2015 UTC,The little guide helps a little. I think my big issue is my velocity. I just want to kaboom launch shit into space and I wasn't being overly subtle about speed.
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,snakejawz,2,Fri May 1 04:26:33 2015 UTC,"i think Eric said what i was trying to say in better words, too much tip drag and too fast make subtle turns into flippity crazy acrobatics."
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,HODOR00,2,Fri May 1 04:35:40 2015 UTC,"Year, TWR is key when planning.  In low atmo, TWR should never be that high.  I usually keep my around 1.25-1.5.  Anything above that is wasteful of Dv and also unstable."
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,neums08,2,Fri May 1 14:10:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for that link. After 1.0, I've been having a heck of a time getting a decent ascent.   I think I've been going way too fast. I've been making super powerful lifting stages, and then putting winglets at the bottom to counteract their tendencies to flip over. This results in a rocket that will absolutely not turn more than 15 degrees until it is nearly completely out of the atmosphere. My apoapsis hits 75k and and I'm still burning almost straight up. This makes me use a lot of fuel circularizing.  I'm going to slow my lifting stage way down and see if I can maneuver a little easier without flipping."
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,HODOR00,1 point,Fri May 1 12:49:11 2015 UTC,TWR should be 1.25-1.5.  Any higher and you are probably wasting Dv and also making your ascent unstable.
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,neums08,2,Fri May 1 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that's the problem. I just installed KerbalEngineer last night, but before that I'm pretty sure I was around 2-2.5."
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,HODOR00,1 point,Fri May 1 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"yeah, I was on FAR before 1.0, so I have a leg up on the new physics.  First thing I learned was TWR is so frigging important.  You cant over power things into space, and if you can, it will be highly inefficient.  anything over 2 is a disaster in low atmo."
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,thefarelkid,3,Fri May 1 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"In addition to the rest of the great advice here, I would suggest making your first stage larger, and your second stage much smaller. You are probably losing your fins half way through the atmosphere. Look at most real life 2 stage rockets, one stage in the atmosphere, one out. I try to drop my first stage just before I circularize."
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,HODOR00,2,Fri May 1 04:42:39 2015 UTC,"I will try that, it seems like it'd give me a lot less hassle haha"
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,FellKnight,3,Fri May 1 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"At a glance, your second stage TWR seems way high.  If you have a 3+ TWR in the low atmosphere, you are going to have trouble keeping it stable.  Based on your Dv totals, Id say you probably are entering stage 2 around 15k perhaps?  maybe lower?  Maybe try adjusting your engine power on the second stage.  Get the TWR down to like 1.5.  If they doesnt help at all, then it could be your ascent strategy.  Which if you give me details, we can find out if theres any issues there."
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,FellKnight,2,Fri May 1 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'd start by putting 4 more fins on the fuel tanks for the top stage, but at a glance I don't see why you'd spin out of control with this basic design.  You could also put a nose cone on top and use radial chutes and try limiting the thrust at the end of your first stage if you are getting too fast too quickly."
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,snakejawz,1 point,Fri May 1 04:11:15 2015 UTC,it might be the velocity I'm going at when I stage. How fast is too fast?
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,snakejawz,3,Fri May 1 04:16:42 2015 UTC,I've found that I tend to lose control around 600-700 m/s if I'm below 20km.  Above 20km you can go faster.
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,snakejawz,2,Fri May 1 04:21:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that's probably the biggest issue. I'm finding it frustratingly difficult to control exactly where my prograde marker ends up going even with this simple design :/
KerbalAcademy,34hbeg,snakejawz,2,Fri May 1 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"spinning how? rotational or flipping end over end? i assume you mean rotational, and in that case i would delete your fins and re-add them. Also it might be helpful to use a vectoring engine or control surfaces, but not both. i seem to have issues using both at once. it would also be a good idea to put a nosecone or something on that, the tip drag will be a bit high without one."

Then from there, once it's complete (I think it's 5 seconds) you then get a new button saying ""overlay"" which toggles the view. I believe you must have sufficient power to do the whole scan uninterrupted. Once it's done, it should also be permanently available from the tracking station.   Also, with the big scanner, I'm not sure if you need to be in polar orbit for it to work. It ""sweeps"" the whole planet it seems, in one go.

Now: your fuel usage is constant, but your thrust will vary.  There's not a lot of effect on total delta-V, but now you have to worry about your TWR more.  The same engine and fuel may give you a TWR of 1.5 in space but 0.9 on the launchpad - meaning you can't take off.  Be sure to calculate both atmospheric and vacuum TWR."

KerbalAcademy,34euj1,hab136,2,Thu Apr 30 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"From reading this, a rocket-powered plane should work really well; you should be able to get a lot of lift from not much thrust in Eve's atmosphere, and then start burning like a rocket once you get into higher atmo.  Admittedly, this would require getting a plane to Eve."
KerbalAcademy,34euj1,Mavericgamer,3,Fri May 1 17:36:03 2015 UTC,"Many people have done exactly that.  It flies, but it's not better than a rocket.  Wings don't lower the delta-V to get to space; in fact pushing against the atmosphere with wings will increase the delta-V you need.  The advantage of a plane is that you can use a high-ISP engine with a less-than-1 TWR like jet engines - which don't work on Eve."
KerbalAcademy,34euj1,hab136,1 point,Fri May 1 20:16:18 2015 UTC,and theoretically you will still need to get past a TWR of 1 before you get into space (or even the thinnest part of atmo) which kind of rules out the LV-N for most practical purposes...

KerbalAcademy,34euj1,marco262,9,Thu Apr 30 18:27:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly what /u/hab136 said: originally Squad achieved the different Isp values by varying the amount of fuel consumed but keeping the thrust constant - e.g. a mainsail would always put out 1500 kN at full throttle. Now they keep the fuel usage constant (like it would be in reality) but vary the thrust - so a mainsail always uses 44.4 LF/sec and 54.275 oxidizer/sec, but at sea level it would produce 1379.032 kN of thrust and in vacuum it would produce the full 1500 kN."

Isp is a measure of efficiency, not power.  Thanks!  Edit: For anyone else curious, the Wikipedia page on specific impulse states that Specific Impulse (Isp) is ""dimensionally equivalent to the thrust generated per unit propellant flow rate.""

KerbalAcademy,34euj1,boom929,19,Fri May 1 12:08:53 2015 UTC,"OK, people have gone over the mechanics of the change, I'll focus on how this would alter your craft designs.  In 1.0, the distinction between a lifter engine (one designed to get you off the launch pad) and an orbital engine (one designed for orbital maneuvers) has become greater and more important.  Lifter engines tend to have a decent atmospheric ISP, but a vacuum ISP that isn't much higher than the atmospheric ISP.  They're designed to deal with atmospheric pressure better, compromising how well the engine works in a vacuum.  This means that you'll get better fuel efficiency from these engines on the launch pad and through the thickest part of the atmosphere, but it won't get much better once you're out of the atmosphere.  The engines that Squad considers to be lifter engines got their vacuum ISP nerfed more than their atmospheric ISP.  Lifting engines also tend to have more thrust, since they tend to need more thrust to do their job.  The Mainsail would be an example of a lifting engine.  As of 1.0, the difference between its atmospheric ISP and its vacuum ISP is only 25 seconds.  Orbital engines aren't designed to cope well with the atmospheric pressure, so while their vacuum ISP is better than a lifter engine would be, they lose a lot of their ISP, and hence thrust, when in an atmosphere.  The engines that Squad considers to be orbital engines got their atmospheric ISP cut by an amount larger than their vacuum ISP.  For example, the LV-909 has a vacuum ISP of 345, making it the second most efficient chemical rocket engine in KSP for orbital maneuvers.  On the other hand, it has an atmospheric ISP of 85, placing it in a three way tie for least efficient chemical rocket for lifting (based solely off of ISP, there are other issues as well).  What this means is that you should be paying attention to what type of engines you're using.  On the twitch streams, there was at least one streamer that ran into problems because in 0.90 he had gotten used to using the KR-2L+ as a lifting engine.  Well, it got the orbital engine treatment, so it lost a lot of atmospheric ISP in 1.0 (also meaning it lost a lot of thrust), so he was having problems getting off the launch pad.    It's also best to not make assumptions and actually read the stats of all of the engines.  For example, while the LV-1R engine is a lifter engine, the stack mounted version of that engine, the LV-1, has a decidedly orbital engine ISP range.  The KR-2L+ may look more like the lifter engines than the orbital engines, but its ISP range is also of an orbital engine nature.  This change also strengthens the primary use case of real world SRBs in KSP.  Since all engines start off weaker at launch, having a cheap, powerful source of a short burst of extra thrust to get the craft up high enough for the main engines to become more effective is very nice.  In a 0.90 career play through, I rarely used SRBs. in 1.0, I use them as my first stages until my craft get so big that I just can't fit enough SRBs on the craft to launch it (this includes winding up with too much mass or too many parts as well as not having enough space to mount them)."

In that light, it makes the most sense for that one to be selected as the large orbital engine."
KerbalAcademy,34euj1,Eric_S,1 point,Fri May 1 03:49:13 2015 UTC,So many acronyms.... Did I miss a faq at the sidebar?
KerbalAcademy,34euj1,Aterius,2,Fri May 1 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"Not really, most of them were part numbers.  Here's the actual acronyms:  ISP: Specific Impulse (think ""Impulse, SPecific""), basically how fuel efficient a rocket is.  A rocket with twice the ISP will use half as much fuel to generate the same amount of thrust as the one being compared to it.  Note that ISP is just the efficiency, not the actual thrust, so at the same ISP, rocket engine thrust can vary widely.  KSP:  Kerbal Space Program (probably obvious, included just for completeness).  TWR:  Thrust to Weight Ratio (not actually used in my post, but I came close to using it a few times and it's pretty commonly used in these types of discussions).  The ratio of how much thrust the rocket engine provides compared to the weight of the engine in a discussion like this, but more likely to be the ratio of the thrust of all the engines on a craft compared to the entire craft.  Since weight is used, you will often see what body the TWR is in reference to, and sometimes even a specific altitude.  If the body isn't specified, assume Kerbin, if the altitude isn't specified, assume sea level.  If the TWR is equal to or less than 1.0, it means the craft has less thrust than it has weight in that situation, so it's not going to be able to counteract gravity to lift off the launchpad.  SRB:  Solid Rocket Booster.  A rocket motor that works by burning solid fuel (like gunpowder, but usually something more specific to the task at hand) in the engine chamber.  Can't be throttled, so once you fire the engine, it runs till it's out of fuel (or possibly oxidizer, but they're usually balanced).  Advantages are usually a high TWR and low cost, disadvantages (other than the previously mentioned lack of control) consist mainly of a low ISP and in KSP, they don't have thrust vectoring (SRBs in reality can, but don't always have it)."

KerbalAcademy,34h94s,FellKnight,2,Fri May 1 03:43:10 2015 UTC,You want to launch when the space station is not quite over the KSC but will be soon. You'll still need to use maneuver nodes to get a rendezvous but it will take minimal effort.

KerbalAcademy,34f3o9,cranp,18,Thu Apr 30 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"There's a couple things that factor in here.  One is a bug:   HeatBalanceFix (27 Apr 15) - (STATUS: Initial Release) - Description: Service bays block all heat flow (acting as infinte heat shields).   The other is the fact that, at least from what I recall, the main purpose of the ablator is to dissipate heat. So, at the moment the last of your ablator gets burned up, the rest of your craft will still be far from overheating and will be able to survive a fair distance before succumbing to the heat.  There might be some other pieces, but that's what I can recall from the top of my head."

I have a giant lander with multiple front-facing heat sheilds, but strangely they are losing ablator at very different rates, and it's the hindmost shields which are losing faster than those furthest into the wind.  So I also wonder how ablator boiloff is determined.  It clearly does not seem to be from exposed area."

KerbalAcademy,34f3o9,nukethor,1 point,Fri May 1 01:52:49 2015 UTC,"When air compresses and heats up, isn't it because of the friction of the molecules rubbing together now that they are in closer proximity?  As I understand it, temperature is just a measure of the molecular kinetic energy in a substance (in this case the air). So the molecules in the air are always moving around, bouncing off one another at random (friction) maintaining a temperature (average kinetic energy). When the air is compressed, the same amount of molecules are now in a smaller space, but the molecules are still bouncing around all dumb and happy. Except now they run into each other more often (generating more friction) bouncing off each other more (raising molecular kinetic energy) causing the temperature to go up.   I know I've seen what you say pop up on the Internet and get repeated because a smart person said it, so it's fun to correct the laypeople. However, I think by saying that friction isn't causing the heat, compression of air is, we're just being specifically redundant.   I've only got a about a year of thermodynamics under my belt and it was about 8 years ago, so I could be wrong, but there's my unsolicited two cents."
KerbalAcademy,34f3o9,gnarwallman,1 point,Fri May 8 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"Copied from wikipedia When fluid flow slows down its kinetic energy is converted to heat; in high speed flows, tremendous energy is represented by the mean motion of the flow. As the flow is slowed to near zero speed, its temperature increases, the gradient in the speed in a direction normal to the surface allows small scale mass transport effects to dissipate the temperature in the outward direction and thus the temperature at the surface is less than the stagnation temperature; the actual"
KerbalAcademy,34f3o9,nukethor,1 point,Fri May 8 11:19:03 2015 UTC,"So as I understand it, the craft is moving fast enough that the air it is contacting slows down effectively to zero. This ""slowing down"" of the air basically creates a laminar type of flow over the capsule. This would be the layer that the Wikipedia article states the aerodynamic viscosity ensures the flow is zero.  So if we now have a layer of fluid (air is a fluid) on the surface of the craft that is moving much slower than all the other fluid layers that are present (due to compression) those layers will be transferring heat to each other. I'm seeing this as friction between fluid layers on the craft. Air molecules on the craft are at relatively 0 velocity and all the other air molecules hit them and transfer heat through the stable layer of air into the craft. The air particles hitting each other is friction. This is what fluid friction is defined as.   Fluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other.[2][3]  So if we have multiple layers of fluid on the spacecraft, which your Wikipedia article states, then assuming the spacecraft is moving (which we all know that it is screaming through that atmosphere) then it is friction that's causing the air compression, and the air compression is causing the temperature change.   My argument I guess is that the first guy wasn't wrong and the guy that corrected him technically wasn't wrong. It's just like an ""I know more than you"" kind of passive aggressive correction which is actually kind of redundant."

So if you have a lot of money, and not a lot of science you can sell your money for science using reputation."
KerbalAcademy,34ef54,chewytheshark,0,Thu Apr 30 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem to be the case, because I'm burning 100% of my rep for science and cash, and I still unlocked three star contracts after I did both minimus and mun landings."
KerbalAcademy,34ef54,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Fri May 1 08:11:48 2015 UTC,"I /think/ that's because you all ready have a high rep. Rep never actually goes down, especially if you're like me and tend to revert or quick load when things go wrong. I guess if you bail on a lot of contracts. Some mods, like the snacks one can reduce it because of things other than failure. 1.0 also added new contracts like the bailout that specifically reduce rep.  Spending 100% is just spending what comes in. So once you are getting 3 star contracts, there's not really any point in getting any more. Gains decrease logarithmicly as you approach the max, so you might even want to tank it to the point where you are getting a mix of 2 and 3 stars and then trade all gains for maximum efficiency?"
KerbalAcademy,34ef54,clayalien,1 point,Fri May 1 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any 3 stars before the minimus landing though. And rep does drop when you activate a strategy.  But I haven't seen any since either, so I was probably really borderline and it was coincidence, except I dropped one of the strategies and still no more 3stars so i dunno wtf is going on. Hopefully somebody with detailed knowledge can update the wiki for 1.01 soon."
KerbalAcademy,34ef54,JustALittleGravitas,1 point,Fri May 1 18:59:29 2015 UTC,More reputation will give you contracts with better rewards (and I think higher difficulty). Plus you can trade it for science/funds in the Admin building.

I had a ton of moon science spam I wanted to process, I linked them up and it wouldn't let me add data to the 2nd lab because the first lab was at 494/500 data. I split them up and could load up the 2nd lab instantly."
KerbalAcademy,34g71s,vjnexus,-3,Sat May 2 11:54:46 2015 UTC,"The lab itself doesn't produce science. It is used to 'scrub' or clean other experiments like the mystery goo so it can be used again. Also if you have scientists in the lab you can increase the science value of other experiments by right clicking on them and choosing (off the top of my head) analyze in science lab or something like that. They are very useful to have in a space station that you want to run experiments back and forth from. They allow you to reuse experiments that would otherwise be a one time use.  Edit: TBH I haven't played 1.0 yet, and it looks like there may be some new features to the lab.

Couple short notes:  Turn on SAS with ""t"" it keeps your ship pointed the way it currently is,  against any turbulence, for the most part.  Turn softly bit by bit in the air, rockets are super aerodynamic when pointing straight, super NOT when turning more than 5-10 degrees.  Parachutes are activated by staging - pressing space will ""activate"" whatever the bottom little orange square on the left side of your screen shows.  If it looks like an engine, it will turn that on.  If it looks like a parachute...    You can click and drag the squares to reorder.  If the stock rocket has an ""abort"" system, you can activate it by mousing over the counter at the top of the screen and clicking on the red [!] button that appears. If it doesn't have a system, the button will do absolutely nothing.  Ask any other questions, this is a super duper steep learning curve game, but Scott Manley will answer the ones you didn't even know you had, all in a sing songy post-colonial accent :D"
KerbalAcademy,34eupn,Head_In_A_Snowbank,6,Thu Apr 30 15:50:49 2015 UTC,"That actually looks like a solid design. Here's a thought, though. Are those all Swivels at the bottom? Five gimballing engines might give you too much control authority and make the controls spastic, particularly if there's any flex, but those struts would take care of that. I find that only gimballing rockets in the core of the stack works better, so try replacing the outer ones with Reliants or just lock the gimbals in the VAB, and just use a gimballing Swivel in the middle, see if that handles better."
KerbalAcademy,34eupn,zthumser,3,Thu Apr 30 16:32:19 2015 UTC,"In 1.0 it has also become possible to change the gimbal range, similar to throttle limiter, so that might also be a possibility to reduce/remove oscillations when using SAS."

I has also been said in a few other posts that you should only uses SAS at launch to start the pitch over, and then let go of the controls (do adjust your throttle but no steering) and let aerodynamics steer your craft. Once you are above 25 to 35 km the atmosphere becomes very thin at which point you can turn on SAS again."
KerbalAcademy,34eupn,Sirlothar,2,Thu Apr 30 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"From looking at the design, this is my guess.  Your launching at full power right?  The TWR on that things is probably about 2.2ish...  You want it to be more like 1.4 on take off.  You can probably stick with the same design, and just launch at a lower throttle... 1/3 throttle might even do it.  Then hit back into full power when you get above about 15k.  You'll have to play around with it to get it just right."

KerbalAcademy,34ei0u,adger,4,Thu Apr 30 15:50:59 2015 UTC,This is likely culprit. I had something similar occur during .90.

KerbalAcademy,34dhuv,therealcreamCHEESUS,9,Thu Apr 30 07:13:38 2015 UTC,Remember to do all the science in every place... e.g. you will get science from doing mystery goo on the launch pad without even firing your engines. Also grab a surface sample from the launchpad.
KerbalAcademy,34dhuv,Ebirah,7,Thu Apr 30 10:22:37 2015 UTC,"The runway and the KSC grounds are also their own biomes. Grassland, shores and water biomes are right next to KSC. And mountain and highland biomes are close enough to be reached by a small rocket.  Do your science both in the ground and in the air (above 20km, and out of the atmosphere should give you even more). EVA reports done clinging to your ship (just above the ground) will give different science to reports done standing on the ground.  Don't forget to do crew reports and EVA reports. Some types of science can be done several times (with diminishing returns) for each location."

As late as today I found out you can set the breaking torque on landing gear :D   EVA-reports are most valuable. They can be done indefinitely although only once per biome for full value. What you do is you set up a polar orbit and as you go around the planet, the planet rotates below you so on every orbit you should be above a new biome (depends on your angle, the planet and your orbital period). Do this for a few orbits and you should have plenty of science. Same goes for surveying with the radars, polar orbit is the way to go."

I find that turning any further than that in the thick atmosphere before ~15 Km can spell certain doom if your rocket isn't aerodynamically stable enough."

KerbalAcademy,34diog,Nematrec,2,Thu Apr 30 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem. I think that the pod's reaction wheel is not strong enough to counteract the drag forces. Try to upgrade the rocket engine to the TL-45.  The gimbal really helps a lot in pointing and keeping the rocket in the right direction.  Fins might help, too. The tier-2 fins don't do much because they are fixed and don't allow you to steer the rocket."
KerbalAcademy,34diog,pacology,2,Thu Apr 30 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yes! It was the gimbal that helped. I tested it further by using the same engine, turned off gimbaling and same issue. Turned it on and I could assume proper direction.  Seems like they nerfed reaction wheels, then?"
KerbalAcademy,34diog,HODOR00,2,Thu Apr 30 16:08:20 2015 UTC,I think maybe just in the command pods.  The regular Reaction wheels seem fine to me.  But the change in aerodynamics is probably the main culprit of the issue.  The reaction wheels have no changed likely but the aerodynamics have changed so much they arent enough to counteract the effect of unstable aerodynamics.
KerbalAcademy,34diog,snakejawz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:23:47 2015 UTC,having the static fins on the rocket makes it virtually impossible for the reaction wheels to steer the rocket.

It's a good way to learn what's going on, and why it's going on.   It's also great for automating things you're getting tired of repeating, but IMO it taught me waaaay more than the in game tutorials.   When 1.0 came out and MJ wasn't up to date right away, I found myself able to do maneuvers I wouldn't have had a clue about before MechJeb."

KerbalAcademy,34blni,gordie44,3,Thu Apr 30 15:15:15 2015 UTC,I always thought of MechJeb as a cheat to KSP.  I have been avoiding the MODS like this (with the exception of Kerbal Engineer for the simple dv calculation).  I may just install MechJeb now and use it as learning tool.  Up to this point I have learned everything I know about seceding in KSP from Youtube and the school of hard-knocks.  I heard MechJeb auto pilot wasn't working with Ver 1.0.... or maybe that had to do with automated landing.
KerbalAcademy,34blni,Stevey854,5,Thu Apr 30 04:49:17 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how you use it.   MechJeb is working fine for me, I play science mode and normally you have to unlock it in stages(it does different things in different modes which are scattered throughout the tree, you actually need a fair amount of science I. E. Manual spaceflight before you unlock autopilot modes). However in 1.0 I have it all unlocked right away, which is nice I can use it to automate launches and LKO burns which get boring after a while. I don't always use it, I often forget to put it on.   I don't use the landing feature though I can't say if it works or not."

Orbital rescue missions are tricky for a beginner.   Why not see if you can take Valentina on a tour of the mum and minmus. By the time you've done that you'll have a better idea of what is what and you can consider setting up an orbital rendezvous mission. But for now just perfect the basics. There's no rush.

KerbalAcademy,34blni,MickGinger,6,Wed Apr 29 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"EVA, then toggle RCS thrusters on your suit with R.   Careful, it's really easy to go shooting away from your ship if you're not gentle with the controls.   It's best to line your ship up like it is going to burn retrograde, so you know you need to push at the back of the engine to go the correct direction.   Technically you don't need to get your pr lower than ~65km, you'll eventually aerobrake down after a 2 or 3 or more orbits.   Don't forget to get back inside before you hit the atmosphere!"
KerbalAcademy,34blni,gordie44,7,Wed Apr 29 22:01:24 2015 UTC,Cheating!  Actually the kerbal suits have insanely efficient monopropellant engines to make flying around in EVA more fun.  Otherwise they'd run out of fuel in a few seconds.  You need the right building upgrade to go EVA in career mode though.
KerbalAcademy,34blni,TheNosferatu,7,Wed Apr 29 22:03:07 2015 UTC,Hardly cheating. It's one of the most Kerbal things the game allows us to do. :)
KerbalAcademy,34blni,Cow_Launcher,3,Thu Apr 30 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"It is when all pods carry an infinite amount of EVA fuel. That's why all the pods have monoprop now - one of the features they were planning was that kerbals going on EVA would fill their suits from the monoprop supply, but they canned it before it left experimentals for whatever reason. They just never bothered to remove the fuel module from the configs."
KerbalAcademy,34blni,Oddzball,2,Thu Apr 30 03:18:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are either looking at an orbital rendezvous rescue, or getting out and having Jeb push.  Pushing is a lot easier if you have whatever tech/upgrades that allow for SAS to remain active while your little guy is out of the capsule, but it is doable either way.  My first trip to the Mun in 1.0 resulted me in running out of fuel while burning for Kerbin return, and I had to push for quite awhile.  So return from your situation is definitely doable.  Here's an old, but still useful Scott Manley video to illustrate how to.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyh4zNJqexI"

Is it just a capsule, a capsule and science modules or a whole rocket?  I guess it´s the second one. If so, decouple everything you don´t need (less weight means less pushing for you) and get out there.  Oh, and... Do a quicksave before (press F5, reload it with holding F9) as EVA and flying around in the EVA suit are things you have to get used to :)"

The more you are willing to ""commit"" to a campaign, the better the rate. The issue is that all the currencies are important. Most obviously is money, to buy crafts and building upgrades. Second is science; to unlock new parts. But the not obvious is the reputation: reputation causes your agency to be able to do more reputable contracts. This helps in the long run as they have an increased pay out.  Overall, I tried using the admin building to turn reputation into science. I found I was losing 50% of my reputation (after paying a sumly price) for tiny amounts of science. I decided to cancel it after a little while. I will admit, I haven't crunched any numbers with this.  Tldr; admin building can convert one currency to another at bad rates."

KerbalAcademy,34dnc5,clayalien,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:19:22 2015 UTC,"The conversion rate isn't that great, and for science, the number is rounded. I think it's nearest whole number. This can be particularly problematic with science in the early stages. 0.4 will round to 0 while still taking your rep. If you are going to use it early on, there's no point unless you go all in and set it to 25%. Even then, you are only going to get 1-3 extra for the first level of contracts. Not much, but then you only need 5-10 to unlock things at that level. Not sure if it gets better later on, but it seems to be they all need to be as high as you can or there's not much point. Like /u/datmotoguy, I haven't crunched the numbers on it.  Ironically, it's probably better for newer players who don't want high rep and end up with contracts too difficult too soon, but more experienced players will want the tougher ones to leap over some early grind. But newer players might not even know to use it. More attention needs to be drawn to it, I think. Maybe start off with fundraising or unpaid interns activated? Or like in xcom where it nags you with ""commander to the research labs..."" on a new game to make sure you check out and set up each screen on a new game."

EVA reports and gravity scans do have biome specific science and there might be more things which can do this. There is in space just above the Mun and space high above the Mun. The first starts when you leave the surface of the Mun and ends somewhere in the ballpark of 15 to 30 km if I remember correctly (it is 250 km for Kerbin) above this altitude you are in high space above the Mun.

KerbalAcademy,34c4j7,devils0508x,2,Wed Apr 29 23:34:36 2015 UTC,"1) Maneuvering can be tricky.  You have to make it so that you and the target body will be at the same place at the same time.  If you set a maneuver node and set the target body (click on it and choose 'set as target') markers will appear if your orbit will come close to the target.  Then you can tweak the node and its position until it gets you on the trajectory you want.  For the Mun, it's generally a good idea to set a node for a prograde burn at about six o'clock when the Mun is around 2-3 o'clock.  Your apoapsis, and consequently your Mun encounter, will then occur around the twelve o'clock point.  Again, you'll probably need some fine-tuning for optimal results.  2)When you set your node, you'll see a blue (not cyan) icon, and if it's not visible on your navball there will be a blue arrow pointing towards it.  Point towards it and start burning a little before you reach the node."

KerbalAcademy,34c4j7,kesnik,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:23:38 2015 UTC,"These are the tips that helped me the most.  I am not a expert and this info may be only partially correct but it works for me, every time.  First, use the tracking station to see what direction Mun is orbiting Kerbin.  Its a good idea to keep your orbit the same direction, also try to keep your orbital plane the same as mun's as well.  If its off a little bit its not a big deal.  Try to get a orbit where the Apoapsis and Periapsis are close to the same distance from Kerbin.  (being circular makes it easier move the Periapsis to the correct location.)  Once you have orbit around Kerbin imagine a line starting at the Periapsis through the center of Kerbin and through the Apoapsis into space.  You are going to use this imaginary line as a guide to aim at your intercept location for Mun.  Adjust your Kerbin orbit so that the location of the Periapsis and Apoapsis ""the imaginary line"" is pointing ahead of Mun's path.  Add a maneuver node at the Periapsis of your adjusted orbit.  If all these thing are in place your maneuver node, once stretched out, will show an interception with Mun.  The maneuver node will add a blue icon on the Nav ball (there will be 2 blue icons, you will just have to learn which is which).  You will be able to figure out which icon to use by looking at the direction you are moving around Kerbin.  You are burning at the Periapsis because that is the place in your orbit where you have the most speed, thus saving fuel."

KerbalAcademy,34c6qe,NumeroChilly,4,Wed Apr 29 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"You were too far off of your prograde marker when you staged.  You never want to be more than 5 degrees off of prograde when you're below 25-30km altitude and above about 100 m/s velocity.  Basically, since the rear fuel tanks were empty before you staged, your center of mass was still fairly well forward and as soon as you turned off of prograde, the resistance from the air going past was balanced all along the craft (with the front of the craft having a bit more resistance), so the CoM was above the center of resistance.  This meant that the air resistance was pushing the front of the craft towards the direction it was moving, or prograde).  As soon as you dumped the lower stage, the CoM returned to the center of the craft, below the center of resistance, so the pressure the resistance applied was pushing you away from prograde.  By keeping the craft pointed prograde, you minimize the amount of air resistance on the side, minimizing the pressure that's pushing you away from prograde."

KerbalAcademy,349e7a,kesnik,7,Wed Apr 29 10:12:04 2015 UTC,"Probably the best first step in Ore-based refueling stations would be to place one in orbit of the Mun. Partner it with a mining lander which can descend to a spot with high concentration, mine the Ore, and meet back up with the ISRU in orbit. Refine the Ore to make fuel, for the mining lander and any ships you send that way. Repeat the process forever.  You can also capture an asteroid and build a mining/refinery station into it. But asteroids have limited Ore, unlike planets/moons. It would be interesting to see the math on whether it's more practical to mine an Asteroid or just send Orange tanks up for orbital refueling. Certainly the latter is less involved and faster, so I hope Squad balanced asteroid mining to be very efficient."
KerbalAcademy,349e7a,MacroNova,13,Wed Apr 29 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"Mun is a good first step, but Minmus may be better. Since you'll have a lander going to and from the surface, the fact that it takes less delta v to orbit and deorbit there may be helpful.

They could be very useful though if they yield a lot of ore, since you can just put it in LKO.  Plus, it is rather time consuming to capture them. Intercepting the moons is rather simple and all you have to do is get there, you don't have to move them."
KerbalAcademy,349e7a,Chronos91,3,Wed Apr 29 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"In terms of speed, sending orange tanks up most likely provide the most amount of fuel in the least amount of time. However mining asteroids/the Mun/Minmus would be the cheapest routes if you're playing Career mode."

KerbalAcademy,349e7a,notepad20,2,Thu Apr 30 00:08:42 2015 UTC,"I don't suspect it would be.  I'd assume it would boil down to the conversion rate.  -How much of the mass of the asteroid can be converted into fuel?  -As you convert the mass of the asteroid, does the over all mass of the asteroid go down while you burn off the fuel you've converted?  In any case I would suspect that the best thing to do would be to simply haul the fuel.  I don't see the devs allowing a perfect 1 to 1 conversion rate with an asteroid so unless they had done that it would be less economical."

If you process it in orbit you have to bring enough fuel for a landing and a take off with the added dead weight of ore.   Which would be more efficient?

That is where you want to burn."
KerbalAcademy,34bpnk,ltjpunk387,3,Thu Apr 30 05:42:48 2015 UTC,"No it wouldn't, because you're in HIGH orbit around the planet you're arriving at, not in low orbit. You're only paying attention to the object that is currently dominating the gravitational interaction i.e. in whose sphere of influence you currently are. Edit: what's effective on the edge of the SOI (or even way earlier on its way) is radial burns to get the trajectory closer to the planet, so you can save energy by circularizing with a low approach."
KerbalAcademy,34bpnk,bobbertmiller,2,Wed Apr 29 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, so as soon as you enter a SOI you should do a radial burn to fine tune Pe for your orbit. Then once you hit Pe you should burn retro until you have a circular orbit?"

KerbalAcademy,34alzr,datmotoguy,6,Wed Apr 29 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"You either have to be in physics range when they land, which has been extended from 2.3 km to 12 km if I remember correctly. Or are actually flying/focusing on it. In order to focus on it (when not in physics range) you have to switch to it, which can only be done when when your current craft is outside the atmosphere. Stages which are outside physics range and flying in the atmosphere do despawn when below about 30 km.  So in order to recover as much as possible you either have to drop a stage at relatively  low altitude, such that it lands before you get out of physics range. Or drop the stage which will reach 30 km when it leaves the physics range and does not get below that before you have navigated your craft outside the atmosphere (and preferably in stable orbit) such that you can switch to it and watch is land.  Solid rocket booster are relatively cheap compared to liquid fuel parts, so recovering those might not be worth that much (especially due to the increased cost of the parachutes)."
KerbalAcademy,34alzr,fibonatic,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:21:39 2015 UTC,Im confused with the physics range thing. How does that work and yet i still get space debris left in orbit that doesnt despawn? Is there something specific about it?
KerbalAcademy,34alzr,EyebrowZing,5,Wed Apr 29 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"The Physics Bubble for vessels is no longer always set to 2.5km. Those values are now defined separately for each possible situation, so we now keep vessels in the atmosphere (or in sub-orbital trajectories) loaded up to 22.5km away. That means falling debris can now easily hit the ground (or KSC facilities) during launch, other vessels can reenter with you and actually hit the surface, quite a few interesting things.   All objects, craft or debris, that is not on the surface (landed) and below 30km (I think this is still valid) will despawn when outside physics range (22km) of your currently controlled craft.   Everything above 30km will persist.   I've found that the most expensive part of multistage launches to be weight, and the extra fuel to get it into orbit. Build as light and small as you can, and it will save more money than the extra engineering and planning to recover parts will.  If a large launcher can't be avoided, the simplest way is to slap a probe core on your last booster stage (and leave a little fuel), and once you circularize, turn it around and fly it home for a little recovery cash."
KerbalAcademy,34alzr,EyebrowZing,2,Wed Apr 29 17:46:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, a probe core would be a good idea so you could take control of it again. I didnt even think of that. Although I wonder how staging would be set so it has its ""own stage"" for chutes once it is decoupled..."
KerbalAcademy,34alzr,h0nest_Bender,5,Wed Apr 29 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"I believe I've always put chutes together in stage 0, and when the launch stage separates and I take control, the chutes are always ready as my next stage.

You only need enough time to burn some dV to get an orbit with your payload. If you did it right, that's not a big burn. Your orbit will be ugly, but the idea isn't to get into perfect orbit first. The idea is to get into an orbit.    That way your lifter doesn't get very far away for very long.    Edit: The other idea I've used in the past (for re-fueling ships and such) is to essentially make an SSTO. Get it up into orbit, detach, and manually bring it down."

KerbalAcademy,34a3ls,Idratherkillganon,17,Wed Apr 29 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"Too much drag at the front and too much weight at the bottom.  The mass is always going to want to be ahead of the drag, thus it flips. A nosecone at the top and/or fins at the bottom help (this pulls your center of drag way back, putting it well behind the center of mass), and don't turn too sharply, try to keep your heading within 5-10 degrees of prograde."
KerbalAcademy,34a3ls,zthumser,3,Wed Apr 29 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"Alright I will definitely add some more fins at the bottom of my rocket. There is a tool within the VAB that shows center of drag, correct?"
KerbalAcademy,34a3ls,NovaDose,2,Wed Apr 29 16:41:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, center of mass, center of thrust, and center of lift.  All though...you could use center of lift to make a good guess about your drag profile..."
KerbalAcademy,34a3ls,zthumser,2,Wed Apr 29 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"Correct, three little buttons in the bottom left near the symmetry controls.  One shows you a yellow ball for your center of mass, one shows you a blue ball for your center of lift/drag (but it only accounts for wings and fins, not body lift, so it's only semi-accurate and won't appear until you add at least some fins), and one shows you a violet thrust vector.  During each stage, you always want your thrust vector pointed directly at (or directly away from, depending on how you look at it) your center of mass but it the spheres don't need to be close to each other, just aligned.  This will always be the case as long as you're building rockets in simple stacks and/or mounting things symmetrically, so you probably don't even need this one.  For any stage that's going to be in the atmosphere you want your center of lift/drag behind your center of mass (with respect to the direction you wish to be travelling through atmosphere).  You can right click on parts in the vehicle assembly building and drain fuel out of them and watch how your CoM will move around as you use fuel (unnecessary once you ""get"" it, but useful for learning).  The CoM/CoL thing isn't strictly necessary as long as you keep your nose pointed prograde and have some control authority like an engine gimbal, but it's the difference between holding the end of a broomstick and letting the broom dangle straight down, vs balancing the broomstick straight up on your finger, one is a whole lot more stable.  There are all kinds of subtleties and exceptions I'm leaving out once you start building planes, but for now let's keep it simple and stay focused on making the rocket go to space."

That said, it is actually possible to get away with that with gimballing engines, though if you turn too far from prograde for your velocity and altitude your engine gimbal wont be able to make up for the torque on your rocket from the center of drag being too high and it will flip. If you don't have fins yet, just take your ascent nice and easy."
KerbalAcademy,34a3ls,Chronos91,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:03:22 2015 UTC,If I can keep my center of drag below my center of mass I shouldn't have issues with my velocity?
KerbalAcademy,34a3ls,OSUaeronerd,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. If you center of drag is too far down it will be difficult to turn when you're moving fast, but that's the only issue I can think of. Basically, the torque you experience when you turn (either stabilizing or destabilizing) is bigger when the center of mass and center of drag are far apart, and smaller when they are close.  All I was trying to say earlier is that if the center of drag is above the center of mass but is still close, you should be able to use engine gimbal to keep yourself straight if you don't go too fast in the lower atmosphere."
KerbalAcademy,34aeps,franklymydeer,4,Wed Apr 29 16:04:23 2015 UTC,"There are biome maps on the wiki to give you an idea of where the biomes are, and the addon ScanSAT can create in-game biome maps.  As for the next step, I'd say a trip to Duna/Ike or  Eve/Gilly.  Don't land on Eve if you want to return, that's quite a bit more of a challenge.  Basically, a Duna orbit and return doesn't take too much more delta-v than a Mun landing and return."
KerbalAcademy,34aeps,Eric_S,3,Wed Apr 29 16:17:49 2015 UTC,The are plenty of biome maps online and a biome overlay in the alt-f12 cheat menu. A good next step might be sending small probes with parachutes to eve and duna with no intention of returning. Sending them and getting surface science out of the way allow your manned missions to be smaller and easier to return.

Like whatever experiments you have available, crew reports, and eva reports ""in flight low"" and on the surface of the launch pad, the runway, the space center, the shores, the ocean, the grasslands, and the highlands that are all a very, very short hop away from the KSC?  A command pod, a parachute, and an SRB can get you all of these, and given the high recovery percentage near the space center will cost you virtually nothing.  Each mission will only hop once, but the same design can be used over and over, so each mission should take like three minutes, tops.  By then you should have enough money and parts to get a couple facility upgrades and to be getting the easy stuff from in space low and high around Kerbin, getting EVA reports above all the biomes around Kerbin, and manage some fly-by's of the Mun, all reasonably profitable if you're still in the first few tiers of the research tree.  If you get really stuck, there are 30+ biomes scattered around the space center itself, flagpole, watertower, crawlway, administration building, etc that are tedious to gather but seem to exist just in case someone gets ""stuck"" like you're describing, and maybe doesn't have any money or science or useful parts.  Alternately you could invest in one of the strategies that convert something you don't need, maybe money or reputation, into science.  I'll admit scrounging for low-level science can be a little tedious, the struggle is (and should be) real, but no way you should be grinding 67 missions for a single upgrade."

Look carefully at what they get you. Push towards the solar panel and probe core.   Don't spend science or money on plane parts, the space plane hanger, or the runway unless you're pretty good at flying and turning your flights into cash. Once you've upgraded everything flights are cheap, but you pay for them up front.  The materials bay gives pretty decent science.  Not right away but after your first few tech nodes, start converting reputation to science. Never give up money or science until later in the game.  Upgrade mission control first so you can have more than 2 contracts, then tracking Centre to get maneuver nodes, then launch pad, then astronaut center, then VAB. Don't let your funds drop below about $50k unless you've got a contract that will right away replenish your funds.  That should get you at least to getting a good chunk of the tech tree under 100 science points, and get you satellite contracts. Then save up to upgrade your R and D Centre."
KerbalAcademy,34a0b4,Bananasauru5rex,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:55:09 2015 UTC,"To me the biggest gate is the low level restrictions on part counter and vehicle mass. 18 tons is basically nothing, so in my opinion the best thing to upgrade is the launch pad first. You can always just do contracts two at a time, and you can even do Mun/Minmus without patched conics.  Mun is easy -> wait to launch until it is right over the eastern horizon, then just point and burn at it until your apo is just over the Mun orbit, and it's a guaranteed encounter.  With 140t restriction you can go anywhere in the early game with enough massive solid rocket boosters, big fuel tanks, etc."

KerbalAcademy,34bbny,Oddzball,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"I could have swore I saw folks storing multiple reports in a single pod. How does that work?   When you're on EVA, click on the pod when you're near it and you should get the option to ""collect data"" if you have a stored crew report. This will store it on your Kerbal rather than in your pod. The Kerbal can then re-enter the pod and this will let you do another crew report. You can also do this to other experiments like the goo, science jr and others, but the goo and science jr won't let you perform another experiment after removing them unless you can scrub the experiments (that might be outdated information, however); this lets you put the experiments on parts of your rocket that won't be making it back to land intact while still getting that tasty, tasty science.  I can't really field the rest of the questions as I haven't been kerballing very hard since the introduction of classes to the game, so I don't know exactly what scientists can do.  Collecting science is basically a question of going to other areas of the game universe (orbiting and landing on different moons and planets) and doing experiments. Different planets have different biomes and each biome will give you a new science yield from the experiment type (you get diminishing returns on, say, 5 crew reports from low kerbal orbit but if you go into munar orbit you get a fresh set of data and lots of science)."

KerbalAcademy,34bbny,Fedalto,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:31:08 2015 UTC,They just have to be different reports. As of .90 you could have an unlimited number of reports both on Kerbals and pods. Should be the same on 1.0.
KerbalAcademy,34bbny,FellKnight,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"You can only do one crew report per pod (unless you do the hack of storing it on your kerbal), but since crew reports generally are the same science whether you store the data or transmit, I much prefer adding an antenna and transmitting each time.  EVA reports and surface samples can be stored multiple times in the same pod, but only if they are from different biomes.  So if you have a rover or a lander with sufficient delta v to hop biomes, you can do trips to minmus for example and get readings from many of the biomes and getting well over 1000 science on a single trip (counting your transmissions).  Not sure if this has changed in 1.0, but in .90, having a scientist on board multiplied your science gains by 1.05 for level 1 scientist, 1.10 for level 2, and 1.15 for level 3-5."

KerbalAcademy,34823a,Kendu72,22,Wed Apr 29 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"A polar orbit is the only way to scan the whole planet/moon at once. The more you're off from vertical, the less of the planet you'll scan. Instantly scanning the whole planet/moon may seem unrealistic, but it was a deliberate design decision. Absent this mechanic, players would just time warp until the scanning was done, and this was deemed unfun.  Anyway, that initial scan gives you a general idea of where the resources are distributed. You got an average of 5% ore concentration, but you can filter by concentration to see where the really good stuff is (e.g., only showing 70%+ will display only the biomes with 70% or more concentration of ore).  Next step is to land a probe/ship/rover and do a surface scan. The surface scan gives you even more detail about the concentration of ore in the biome. (I don't know much more than this about surface scanning).  Final step before drilling is to use the Narrow Band Scan to pinpoint an exact set of coordinates for landing, and it will tell you the concentration of ore on that spot.  Make sure to bring a decent engineer along to operate the drilling equipment so it runs at peak efficiency and doesn't overheat as easily."
KerbalAcademy,34823a,MacroNova,6,Wed Apr 29 04:13:19 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the detailed write-up! I had no idea there were surface scans involved. Is the scanning part for the surface rovers the same as the orbital scanner? What about this narrow-band scanner? Thanks again in advance.

KerbalAcademy,348944,otterfamily,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"FWIW this is very similar to how ""reverse thrust"" works on real-life planes.  They put something directly behind the jet exhaust to redirect it forwards, and so the net effect is that the plane is pushed backwards."

In game though, it's probably just canceling all of your thrust since there is a part behind the engine and you're rolling backward because of the slope or something."

KerbalAcademy,345hm1,the_gum,6,Tue Apr 28 14:20:30 2015 UTC,Doesn't that picture show that the heat shield is not generating drag?  There is no drag force vector emanating from it
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Toobusyforthis,2,Tue Apr 28 16:42:17 2015 UTC,"you are right, it really doesn't look as i described it. but it would be a logical explanation. need to take a closer look."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,the_gum,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"I think it is just that the COM is too far back since the heat shield is not considered in that.  I have been having success just 'flying' the capsules back, keeping the heatshield pointed down a bit so it generates a bit of lift and keeps you out of the denser atmosphere until you slow down enough the slight unbalance doesn't matter."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Toobusyforthis,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:17:32 2015 UTC,I think there isn't a heat shield in that picture.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,MacroNova,2,Tue Apr 28 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"definitely is, look at the tiling."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Toobusyforthis,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:35:46 2015 UTC,I must be blind; I really don't see it.

KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Toobusyforthis,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:48:01 2015 UTC,The drag vectors are coming from the center of the objects so the pod has the top one is the heat shield

KerbalAcademy,345hm1,snakesign,3,Tue Apr 28 16:05:14 2015 UTC,no difference without the parachute:  http://youtu.be/0zzZh58e-k4
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,the_gum,3,Tue Apr 28 18:50:09 2015 UTC,What am I looking at?  Is this a stable orientation for the capsule?  Do you have physics enabled on the heat shield?
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,snakesign,13,Tue Apr 28 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"/u/RoverDude_KSP , the guy who made the configs for the new heatshield parts (prodigious modder/nice dude), said the instability was a bug on DasValdez's stream last night, he knows the fix, and it will be in the next patch.  Thanks for your perspective, though.  It's a cool idea.  However for it to truly work, the CoM of the command pod would have to be off-center, not high (unstable).   The Command Module's center of mass was offset a foot or so from the center of pressure (along the symmetry axis). This provided a rotational moment during reentry, angling the capsule and providing some lift (a lift to drag ratio of about 0.368). The capsule was then steered by rotating the capsule using thrusters; when no steering was required, the capsule was spun slowly, and the lift effects cancelled out.   That said, you may be correct that you can use ""lifting body"" behavior to control your descent."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,wooq,11,Tue Apr 28 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"It would be great if this was indeed the case. But it isn't. I just did several tests with Mk1 capsule and a heat shield and a parachute on it, at moderate difficulty.   The capsule is stable at about a 40-degree angle up. The CoM in the capsule (or the heat shield) must be off centre since this is not symmetric. If you have the capsule door point up (navball has ground at the bottom and sky at the top) then the capsule will naturally glide in at the orientation you'd expect. If you turn the capsule with the Q and E keys, then you can angle it sideways or even down.   However, the capsule provides very little lift. So little in fact that it's basically impossible to survive the re-entry without active control of the capsule. Even if you do an extremely shallow re-entry, where you do more than a full orbit in the upper atmosphere, you're still going to go too fast when you eventually get to lower altitudes and will blow up. The capsule simply doesn't provide the lift to stay long enough at medium altitudes where you could bleed off speed but not overheat. And this is starting from low orbit, returning from the Mun would be even more deadly. On the other hand, you can come in at a very steep angle if you actively keep the nose pointing at retrograde marker.  Basically, it seems like this really wasn't tested much at all. Which is quite sad considering that aerodynamic modelling was one of the key features in this update, you'd think that they'd focus some testing on this. And yet the most basic re-entry capsule obviously isn't working as intended."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Olog,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:45:30 2015 UTC,So how do you survive re-entry after a visit to the Mun?
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Arguss,3,Tue Apr 28 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"Plan your return so your periapsis is about 25-30km and pilot the return craft to keep the shield pointed into the airstream. I haven't tried the fix where you remove the physics-less flag from the heatshield yet, but I'm hoping that makes direct input less necessary."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,MacroNova,2,Tue Apr 28 20:08:17 2015 UTC,I went into the part configs and changed the physics-less flag to 0 (for some reason that makes them have physics) and now they properly orient themselves. As long as you're pointing remotely retrograde it will orient correctly.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Chronos91,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:28:14 2015 UTC,Yup! That was my experience as well after testing yesterday.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,MacroNova,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"I've tried that, but every time everything but my capsule seems to explode at some point, no matter how straight I try to point it. Kind of pointless to go to the Mun if all the science burns up on re-entry."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Arguss,3,Tue Apr 28 20:14:08 2015 UTC,Possible you're still coming in too steep?  I've not lost a pod coming in at transmunar velocity with a shallow profile. It takes a stack of three pods (tourism sardine contracts!) to really eat into the heat shield.   I have lost pods to it flipping out but never if I can keep them straight.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,BcRcCr,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:12:58 2015 UTC,"What's a shallow angle? How many meters for the periapsis, do I have to circle a lot of times, what?"
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Arguss,3,Wed Apr 29 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"Don't need to circle but you do want to spend say oh, about about a third of a kerbin orbit in the upper atmo? Gimme a sec and I'll fire up a flight and snag a screen shot of one that works for me. See if it matches up. Could be something else is the problem after all.  Edit: Threw together a quick album http://imgur.com/a/tC6fL This is very conservative. You could definitely bite in much harder than this and still be OK. Ignore the deployed chute I fat fingered the space bar. I did cut the chute (RIP Jeb) to make sure it all worked without using the super powered chutes. Also didn't time warp in case that cheats through heating effects.  Big thing I noticed doing this was with the heat shield unpatched using SAS on retro is terrible but it holds pretty well if you keep it on but align it manually with retrograde marker.  In short what /u/MacroNova said :) Hopefully my screenshots help explain."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,BcRcCr,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:36:45 2015 UTC,I just made it back from the Mun. Required  six attempts to make it safely through the descent. Lots of concentration on the nav ball and opening parachutes ASAP is what's required. Next mission I'm just going to put a heat shield on both sides.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,rickyharline,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"I have a heat shield on both sides.  As I mentioned in another post, the parachute opening in the high atmosphere is an exploit, no? Is there a way to land without using that exploit?"
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Arguss,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"And the Kerbals die too I guess. A lesser issue than the lost science, of course, but there are those who might have some concern."

KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Arguss,2,Tue Apr 28 19:57:30 2015 UTC,Powered descent should work.  Mind you I still haven't gotten to the mun since the update.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Nematrec,2,Tue Apr 28 20:15:22 2015 UTC,"Powered descent? As in, using fuel to reduce your velocity as you land? That would mean an additional 2k dV per trip."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Arguss,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:28:04 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I haven't accomplished it yet so I'll be of little actual help. Hopefully you can find someone who actually can.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,Nematrec,6,Tue Apr 28 20:36:02 2015 UTC,"I tried putting a heat shield on both ends of my command pod, along with some radial parachutes. Works like a champ."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,joho0,5,Tue Apr 28 16:20:46 2015 UTC,"While you are correct about how reentry is controlled in real life, that is NOT what is happening here. IRL this effect is produced by misaligning the center of mass and center of lift of the capsule. IIRC, the difference in alignment in the Apollo capsules was somewhere between 1 foot and 18 inches of lateral offset. This made the capsule skew off to one side during reentry, causing a net lift on the capsule, and by rotating the capsule, you could change the direction of the skew relative to the air, and thus the direction of the lift, and control the capsule's trajectory. BUT, despite this offset, the capsule was still ballistically stable. If power was lost and the RCS thrusters were rendered out of comission, the capsule would NOT flip around and begin flying with the unprotected portion of the capsule facing into the windstream.  I don't know if an Apollo capsule was capable of withstanding the increased heating generated during a ballistic reentry, (I'd doubt it, given the huge heat loads it was subjected to.) but a Soyuz capsule is, when returning from LEO. In fact, the Soyuz has a procedure for just such a situation. (EDIT: Youtube timestamp doesn't appear to want to work correctly. Skip to 14:16.)  The issue with this update appears to be that the capsule/heatshield combinations are NOT ballistically stable, and want to flip around quite wildly when the center of mass and center of drag should be perfectly in line. (Read, just a capsule and heatshield.) This poses a huge issue with reentry, because sometimes it can be almost impossible to keep your craft oriented with the heatshield forward once it is actually needed. This is not how this should behave and needs to be fixed."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,VFB1210,2,Wed Apr 29 05:05:20 2015 UTC,"The solution is incredibly simple, switch the physicsignificance flag in the cfg file. I did that last night and my first reentry flew perfectly with no effort at all. Sas off and the airstream pulls the pod into the correct orientation."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,number2301,3,Wed Apr 29 15:17:37 2015 UTC,"apples to stock. lol   Also for that old timey video here's a skip button that adds a little bit of cool information, then gets to the ""aerodynamic lift"" about a minute later."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,SWgeek10056,3,Tue Apr 28 14:11:43 2015 UTC,A fix involves modifying the heatshields config files to make them physics-significant again (PhysicsSignificance from 1 to 0).  The thread also provides a modulemanager patch to automate it.

KerbalAcademy,345hm1,croakovision,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"This really should get more upvotes. I did something similar and haven't had any problems since. Your solution is even simpler than mine. Until they fix this bug, I hope more people see this."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,joho0,2,Wed Apr 29 12:47:46 2015 UTC,Except isn't the CoM of the command module in-game centered? They Say in the video it is possible to get aerodynamic control with an offset CoM.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,mooglinux,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:12:57 2015 UTC,You can attach things off axis to move the COM.  Although this seems really really complicated to actually pull off without some sort of mod which will predict your descent trajectory.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,snakesign,2,Tue Apr 28 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"That would add off-center drag too. But yeah, effectively using this the way Apollo did would be difficult without better descent trajectory info."
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,mooglinux,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:26:57 2015 UTC,Completely forgot about the drag offset!  That will probably have way more effect than the com offset.
KerbalAcademy,345hm1,snakesign,2,Tue Apr 28 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"So I only re-entered Atmo once yesterday.  It was a struggle to keep the craft oriented right, but it was possible.  I am not sure how this will change with bigger crafts, but it just seemed like the it was a more difficult process to re-entering.  I needed to be more active.  Kind of thought it was challenging but not glitchy."

KerbalAcademy,345hm1,ifandbut,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:27:31 2015 UTC,That attitude indicator is the nav ball. The position of your craft is its attitude.

Every time the speed starts to shave of fast the craft starts trying to rotate to a top down configuration. I have the heat shield cfg change going as well. The few times I actually made it back to the ground my craft lost its science jr and small cargo bay because it was flying at between 40-70 degrees away from retro with full opposite input to try and correct, any other input aside from full opposite to correct causes the craft to flip in that direction and end up in nose down."

KerbalAcademy,347uvk,ardwin,2,Wed Apr 29 11:58:13 2015 UTC,"So does that mean that you're throwing science away by returning it without first converting it to data?  If I can still return the experiment for just as much, it sounds like the data conversion is use-it-or-lose-it free science.  Or does the ""data"" science come from science that would otherwise be leftover in that experiment, thus obviating the need for further expeditions to get that last little bit of leftover science in the experiment?"
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,zthumser,3,Wed Apr 29 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"So does that mean that you're throwing science away by returning it without first converting it to data?   Nope! Otherwise you'd be penalized for not getting the lab early, and they didn't want to do that to you.  Let's take the example of a Goo experiment in LKO. You run the experiment, recover the part with the data intact, and boom. That's all the science you're ever going to get from recovering data from a Goo canister in LKO.  HOWEVER, you can later on do that same Goo in LKO experiment and feed it to the Mobile Processing Lab. The Lab will churn away at the data and turn it into useful science over time. You can't feed that Lab a second helping of Goo in LKO data, but you CAN feed a different Lab another Goo-in-LKO dataset and recover science from it."
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,MacroNova,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for explaining that.   You can't feed that Lab a second helping of Goo in LKO data, but you CAN feed a different Lab another Goo-in-LKO dataset and recover science from it.   Wait, doesn't that mean that labs on the launchpad taking every science measurement (for zero science because you exhausted the landed-at-launchpad science long ago), then feeding them into the lab (which is a new lab because you just spawned it on the launchpad), generates new lab data science and is then recovered at 100% of cost, thus generating infinite science without leaving the launchpad, at the cost of a few days in-game time?  Or does the lab not work on Kerbin?"
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,zthumser,3,Wed Apr 29 15:24:51 2015 UTC,Someone asked a very similar question on the KSP forums. Roverdude's response was that the multiplier for Kerbin science was extremely low.
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,MacroNova,3,Wed Apr 29 15:51:38 2015 UTC,"So in other words, yes it would work, but it would be so godawful tedious you should just do a real mission."

It seems like the use case for the lab is putting one in orbit around a body, and then returning all the science to it, and let it make more science, before you export the experiments home."
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,ardwin,2,Wed Apr 29 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"That's cool, that gives me a reason to have a space station as early as possible.  So does that mean that the only point to sending a big heavy science lab any farther than LKO is to beam back a higher percentage or to carry multiple copies of the same thing?  I guess that could still be worthwhile, though it would seem harder to justify all that weight when a few small crew capsules could also carry several copies of each experiment."
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,zthumser,2,Wed Apr 29 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"The new lab mechanic is less ""increase beam back"" experiment efficiency, and more using experiments to give the lab ""data"" to do their own research on.  This ""own"" research generates science per day, and after your experiments are ""turned into data"" they can still be returned for full value.  More data seems to translate into more science per day."
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,ardwin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"That's cool, I get that.  It just seems that there's little point in lugging the science lab all the way out to, say Duna, when I know I'm going to want to be bringing that science back to Kerbin anyway so I could just as well leave the lab there.  Or is there still a good reason to bring it along?  And I'm not saying that's a problem, but it definitely suggests a change of strategy."
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,zthumser,2,Wed Apr 29 14:55:45 2015 UTC,"That I can't answer.  My little station is just in LKO, that is all the farther I could push it and it almost didn't make it that far.   I assume there would be different multipliers for orbiting different bodies.  If not, there wouldn't be much point to haul the lab anywhere."
KerbalAcademy,347uvk,ardwin,2,Wed Apr 29 15:03:00 2015 UTC,Mobile Processing Labs work best when they are on or in orbit around the body from which the science came. Better multipliers for being on the surface.

I had made a conscious effort to keep Jeb and Val together (they aren't scientists, thus useless), and couldn't help but feel a little guilty knowing that there was enough space in the hitchhiker for two more...  In anycase, the science lab no longer cleans experiments. Kerbals with scientist specializations do that now. The science lab allows you to take data gathered from scientific instruments and run experiments on the data. You can hold 500 units of data in each science lab. This amount slowly decays as it is consumed and passively converted into science. The science lab consumes large amounts of electrical charge and apparently produces heat (logs show my science lab was destroyed by overheating).

Mobile science labs (IMO) really excel at resetting your science experiments.  For example, you lug one out into Munar orbit.  You then use a lander to keep going and doing experiments.  You bring them back into orbit and you can grab the science and then clean our your science junior or goo things and reuse them.  You also can get a transmission boost for sending stuff back, but normally I just lug the whole thing back when done.

This is pretty consistent through the 8km-20km range of altitude (roughly; I'll test some more tonight to nail down some better numbers for speed and altitude when I start seeing this).  Too far above the 20km mark the intake air starts to get super starved, but I think I still see shock heating at around that altitude (again I'll need to check it out for better numbers after work).  After talking it through, my next step is going to be to see where I can get my throttle so that I can sit at 6-800 m/s at 20km and slowly increase speed to see what happens at roughly what speed."
KerbalAcademy,348vqf,idleactivist,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, well clearly you're going too fast too low and need to gain more altitude before picking up more speed, but you know that already.  As for getting air-starved at 20km, there is more air available if you're going faster, so maybe in response to blowing up low, you're climbing too aggressively and don't have enough speed yet when the air gets thin?  Or maybe you just need more intakes; I expect we're going to have to totally rethink what an ""appropriate"" ratio of intakes to engines is.  I would think that if you could get just a little bit higher the risk of overheating and tearing apart should drop as there just isn't enough air to do damage, but maybe there's already no air to run the engines at that point.  I think your next step sounds like a good one.  As you pick up speed you should get more air, which should allow you to go higher, which should allow you to pick up speed, and you should be able to cautiously ride that equilibrium to it's limit.  At that point, if the atmosphere is still medium-thick (previously below ~30km) I switch to rockets and pitch up to get out of it ASAP, if I have a great design and I'm upwards of 30km+ before running out of air then I tend to kick in the rockets and leave the jets on for a bit, continuing to burn roughly prograde.  A prograde burn is generally more efficient, and the rockets give me enough speed to give me enough air to run the jets a while longer, so the added efficiency more than makes up for the negligible drag losses at very high altitude."

KerbalAcademy,348kfu,gordie44,2,Wed Apr 29 05:10:34 2015 UTC,"The primary causes of spinning out of control on ascent are straying too far from your prograde vector, lack of fins at the bottom of your ship and having a big faring at the top that creates too much drag."
KerbalAcademy,347mww,jabies,7,Tue Apr 28 23:07:45 2015 UTC,Your bigger problem is going to be Max Q: the point if maximum aerodynamic pressure. That point causes rapid unplanned disassembly. More likely than not you're not going to keep pace with terminal velocity above a very low altitude.
KerbalAcademy,347mww,SenorPuff,2,Tue Apr 28 23:22:39 2015 UTC,I'm not using the terminal velocity checkbox in MJ anymore. Full throttle all the way. Works great. See latest Scott Manley video where he's says the same.

KerbalAcademy,347mww,Chronos91,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:21:43 2015 UTC,"Terminal velocity is going to be much, much faster than it was in stock aerodynamics before and you're probably unlikely to reach it on ascent if you're starting with a reasonable TWR (I try for 1.3-1.8ish). Just go full throttle at the start and throttle back a bit as you approach maxQ (probably going to be when you're transonic, around 300 m/s)."

However, to be honest, returning from a 75x75 LKO orbit doesn't require a heatshield if you're just returning the capsule and parachute.  Set your periapsis at 30km, keep the capsule aimed retrograde (without a heatshield, the mk1 capsule will want to do this by itself), and you'll be fine."

KerbalAcademy,347cql,DocQuixotic,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:57:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you'll be able to. Use map mode to look at your orbit while you execute your burn, and don't use full throttle so you can make your burn more precise. You can use the 'X' key to instantly cut throttle the moment you reach the desired periapsis. Any PE between 30 and 40km should do fine though. Consider quicksaving before you make the manuever (F5) if you want to be sure to get it right. Alt-F5 will allow you to name your quicksave, Alt-F9 will allow you to load a specific one. If you want, you can use this to experiment with different trajectories. Good luck!"

KerbalAcademy,346tst,Stonz,7,Tue Apr 28 19:34:44 2015 UTC,"I think your theory is exactly right; the way it works is that your shield got so stupendously hot that even out of the atmosphere it's still so hot that it's still essentially boiling away and cooling down.  I think the KSP ablation depends solely on temperature, not on airflow.  I don't actually know how realistic that is.  You can check the temperature of parts by turning temperature displays on in the debug menu (alt+F12 on PC) and if the part was screaming hot at the time I'd say that's the answer.  If the part wasn't super hot, then you've found a bug."
KerbalAcademy,346tst,zthumser,2,Tue Apr 28 19:46:12 2015 UTC,This is almost surely what's happening. I was mining on the mun with an attached return ship that had a heat shield. The mining made the whole vessel heat up and my ablator resource started disappearing.
KerbalAcademy,346tst,lomendil,2,Tue Apr 28 22:20:19 2015 UTC,I was wondering if it would draw heat from the rest of the vessel. I don't think I like the sound of that.
KerbalAcademy,346tst,TMarkos,3,Tue Apr 28 22:32:29 2015 UTC,Seems to me that its behaving as you described and using the ablation to speed cooling.  You could help confirm this by turning on the extra temp info in the debug menu (alt+f12) and sharing a screenshot.

Just slowly push the prograde marker toward north in the first half of your launch or so and you should be able to go straight from launchpad to polar orbit with no corrections."

KerbalAcademy,345nj8,TheAmazingKoki,5,Tue Apr 28 14:27:43 2015 UTC,"I think all planets in KSP turn around vertical axis so you need to turn the orbit until it's perpendicular to orbital plane, it'll use crapload of fuel if it's a low orbit though and very little in high orbit. So you'd be better off to start moving satellite into polar orbit from the start, as soon as you enter sphere of influence.

KerbalAcademy,3441wb,dyyys1,9,Tue Apr 28 16:00:29 2015 UTC,I have found it dramatically different from craft to craft.  Getting to orbit is not just about delta-V now.  Slim craft can do it with about as few as 3000 m/s.  Othercraft need about 5000 m/s.

I literally begun playing today and I'm trying to learn without having to resort to tutorials or youtube to avoid spoilers (That first space entry maaaaaan!)  At the time of my career I don't have wings unlocked yet, I've got the first two science upgrades and that's it. I just cannot wrap my head around how the controls work, I cannot reliably distinguish right from left, up from down, I tried judging by how the space ship is tilted by looking at an antenna on the ship, but when I use that as point of reference shit just goes cray and I cannot read the NavBlue properly, when I think I know how to steer I don't.  Another question if you don't mind, what's the difference between Science mode and Career mode? Science mode seems easier and more noob friendly, should I use Career mode to learn the game in order to maximise immersion or should I go to Science? I'm not sure if removing those restraints affect the progressive nature of the game (e.g. if I went to sandbox then I could possibly build a spaceship that leaves the solar system on first try missing out on the awesome feeling of breaching the atmosphere for the first time)  Edit: One more question, how do you orbit? I did the orbit tutorial but I don't understand how to enter orbit."
KerbalAcademy,345bio,number2301,3,Tue Apr 28 13:44:07 2015 UTC,"Learn to use the navball, just looking at the rocket is not helpful as it is hard to tell what the orientation is.  WASD will always be oriented the same way on the navball, and you can see where your prograde and retrograde vectors (forward and backward) are pointing to know which direction you need to steer.  I prefer career over science, but science is definitely easier since you don't need to worry about money or contracts, but its really boring IMO.    To orbit, you need to get your apoapsis (highest point on your trajectory) out of the atmosphere, so at least 70k.  Once you reach that highest point, you need to then burn prograde (forward) to circularize your trajectory, gaining speed and raising your periapsis (lowest point) so you don't just fall back down into the atmosphere.  Hitting 'm' will bring you to map view where you can see your apoapsis and periapsis."
KerbalAcademy,345bio,BillOfTheWebPeople,2,Tue Apr 28 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"Science mode is by far the best for new players.   To control the ship you need to watch the Nav ball, the orange marker in the middle is where you are pointing. To launch into a standard orbit you want to head towards the 90 degree marker which is East.   So once you've got your rocket built abs staging set up, hit space to launch, throttle up, let it get to about 100m/s, then start moving very slowly towards 90 degrees on the Nav ball. There's a circular yellow marker on the Nav ball which you need to stay close to."

However, what asking questions here is different is that I get the very basic information, it avoids imo giving too much of the game, just answers this one very specific problem I have, in case of comment steering is something that has to be learned in practice anyway so youtube videos won't help really, meanwhile how to orbit question can be ruined because entering orbit for the first time is an exceptional feeling. I just want to spoil as little of the game as possible while at the same time not make myself suddenly drop the game in favour of one of the other 200+ games in library by feeling I'm not getting anywhere."
