hayleywilliams,36jb4y,ImperfectSanity,2,Wed May 20 04:57:44 2015 UTC,she kind of looks like ashley benson this photo to me o0
hayleywilliams,36jb4y,Sxi139,2,Wed May 20 14:54:04 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure how you see that. I think Ashley Benson has a more rounder face. I could be mistaken but I think she has clearer skin to.
hayleywilliams,36jb4y,ImperfectSanity,3,Thu May 21 00:19:53 2015 UTC,You should call her.
hayleywilliams,36jb4y,squeakyguy,2,Wed May 20 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, we didn't exactly end on good terms but this is exactly something one of my friends says whenever I bring her up."

hayleywilliams,36beg2,canadianwannabe85,17,Mon May 18 00:31:56 2015 UTC,She would have made a very interesting Harley Quinn.
hayleywilliams,36beg2,TheMightyZander,13,Mon May 18 02:15:52 2015 UTC,Sadly that's pretty much all the Hayley in the video.
hayleywilliams,36beg2,Scoobert88,11,Mon May 18 00:43:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and just one quick shot near the end, where she just looks angry. I'm disappointed she only had like 2 secs when they made a poster like she had a big part. But maybe they made a poster of everyone?    It just way too many people to cram into a short music video, giving each only a few seconds. They needed to make a whole movie with all these characters."
hayleywilliams,36beg2,Einyen,7,Mon May 18 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"Taylor's Instagram has pretty much just been hyping this video. It felt like 80% of the video was introducing the video, and then its gone."

hayleywilliams,36beg2,_Shin_,3,Mon May 18 02:56:17 2015 UTC,"Basically just has her doing the front flip in her intro, then the close up on her face, then it shows her walking with the rest of them. I expected too much of Hayley out of this video it seems. All the people besides Taylor and Kendrick didn't get much screen time. Makes sense, I suppose."

So I guess she unfortunately wanted more coverage and support for the show when she is running around and jumping a lot. It would have been an even greater show with just the black one though :)"
hayleywilliams,36beph,Scoobert88,7,Mon May 18 00:34:58 2015 UTC,I would quite happily watch a 2 hour film with all these characters. 3 mins sure ain't long enough

Usually those are on the guitar's strap though.  I've also noticed in a lot of these pictures that she tapes the mic cord up the side of the mic, which I assume is so if she reaches the end of her ""leash"" it doesn't destroy the connector.

hayleywilliams,2z5jt0,fagdrew4l,5,Sun Mar 15 21:29:23 2015 UTC,Shes starting to look less like a girl and more like a woman each day. Not a bad thing.
hayleywilliams,2z5c4l,Mach712,0,Sun Mar 15 18:49:55 2015 UTC,not so flattering
hayleywilliams,2z5c4l,SkyrocketFilms,-1,Sun Mar 15 20:03:38 2015 UTC,agreed.
hayleywilliams,2z5j9z,mariuzzo,2,Sun Mar 15 19:47:02 2015 UTC,can't wait to see her on this show
hayleywilliams,2z5j9z,vavavumm,2,Sun Mar 15 20:33:07 2015 UTC,I always wondered if she has someone edit these before she posts them. She has pretty decent grammar for just having a highschool education that was pretty relaxed. But it's not too hard to have good grammar if you read a lot. She is also a song writer too so that helps. I just see too many people with shit writing.
hayleywilliams,2z0ywb,kingofdiamonds66,4,Sat Mar 14 15:39:46 2015 UTC,:) she seems like such a good person.
hayleywilliams,2z0ywb,squeakyguy,4,Sat Mar 14 17:55:49 2015 UTC,"True, I've always thought she seemed like a really awesome gal but I have to admit, reading the story behind Misery Business and Decoy made her seem a little petty and cruel.

hayleywilliams,2pkrwl,MunkenDk,5,Wed Dec 17 15:31:30 2014 UTC,You can see her wearing different models of DT770s in different sources. This looks like it could be the 80 or 600 ohms version.  In some youtube videos (kings of leon cover comes to mind) she is wearing the 250 ohms version. You can tell because of the coiled cord.

hayleywilliams,2mlg7j,fagdrew4l,2,Tue Nov 18 02:07:34 2014 UTC,Does she still have her septum pierced? I think it looks really nice on her but never see new pictures with her wearing jewelry in it.
hayleywilliams,2mlg7j,bleepbloopPENIS,3,Tue Nov 18 02:30:54 2014 UTC,"No not anymore, she just had it for a little bit. There's even a video of her getting it done. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ6zS3hy_Gg"
