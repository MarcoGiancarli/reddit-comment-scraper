As time went on, he started sabotaging the magazine by injecting falsehoods in his articles and reviews, ending up with articles like ""Louis Armstrong used to be a cannibal"" and ""Muhammad Ali wants to film his on fights"", and publishing completely invented interviews.  Then he started to invent film makers (up to about fifty over the years) and wrote up their movies and life stories -- notably a blind Thai film maker who according to him made some of history's most beautiful movies.

That may sound silly, but let's take a look at this painting of Erasmus to see why it's not. You can clearly see written on the page edge the author or title of the books he's looking at - the new testament, Lucian (Λουκιανὸς / Loukianos), Saint Jerome (Hieronvmus). There's one book with just an initial on.   I suppose it must have been much cheaper and easier to write on the edge, in ink, instead of having the binding engraved with this information.   You can see another illustration in the chained library . In the images here, though, you can't see any writing on the book-edge - maybe it's faded over time? or, maybe they had some other way of working out where a book was. Not sure."

bookshelf,3ax4xf,treerex,2,Thu Jun 25 08:11:51 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in what their objections are/would be to Dostoevsky and Cicero. What books are on your ""nice"" shelf?  More info = better subversive recommendations! :-)"
bookshelf,3ax4xf,goshy900,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:20:01 2015 UTC,"I've only just started The Brothers Karamazov, and I haven't read Notes from Underground yet. But I've heard they cover existentialism a lot, and I'm not sure that's something my parents would like. I also have Crime and Punishment, and I used it as one of my books for school last year (homeschooled). My mom read a synopsis and she didn't have any problem with it. But as far as I've heard, the other two are less direct and more ""here are a bunch of viewpoints to think about"".  The Cicero book is another one I'm not very familiar with, because I just picked it up a couple days ago. The back of the book talks about ""Cicero's vision of the afterlife"" and how he tried to consolidate the inconsistencies of previous philosophers. So I put it here just to be safe.  My nice shelf mainly has a bunch of 60s-70s scifi paperbacks (my guilty pleasure), really old books and curiosities (1905 Harvard Classics Aeneid, Depression-era Monaco travel guide, War Department pamphlet on New Zealand given to WWII American troops stationed there, etc), history books (mostly medieval and WWII), Sherlock Holmes, the Wealth of Nations, some C.S. Lewis, a bunch of Michael Crichton books, and a bunch of Christian fantasy from years ago."

So they don't watch my bookshelf like hawks, but I'm sure if they actually went through it they'd find that I'm a different person than they would like me to be. I keep these books hidden or de-emphasized (i.e. bottom shelf at floor level) so if they randomly look through a book it won't be one of these, because right now it would be really bad if they found out I'm a left-leaning agnostic."
bookshelf,3ax4xf,_PM_ME_YOUR_BOOKCASE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"Travels by Crichton was really good. It's basically about his spiritual journey in life, which just happens to include physical traveling too. He gets really into New Age type stuff, which I don't really agree with, but it's interesting seeing how he approaches such topics with a scientific/skeptical mind. The Hittites by O.R. Gurney - I've only skimmed this so far, but he uses the Bible as a source, so he constantly says things like ""The Bible says this happened, but archaeological evidence suggests that's only half true!"" He does it often enough that it would drive my parents up the wall :P The Count of Monte Cristo - My dad (and possibly my mom) read a heavily abridged version years ago and liked it, so I can safely put this in a prominent place on my shelf and even read it in front of him. Conveniently, the abridged versions leave out the raunchier parts of the story and I have the unabridged :D Essays by George Orwell - Like a lot of conservative Christians my parents seem to think Orwell was some sort of libertarian, or maybe they don't think about his overall stance at all. He was a socialist though, and his essays talk about it quite a bit. My parents believe socialists like Obama (heh) are destroying America, so I doubt it would go over well if they found out about Orwell. As a side note though, it's pretty impressive that Orwell managed to be well-loved across the whole political spectrum. Has any other political writer managed that?   I think the other books are more self-explanatory.  Other books that might belong here but I haven't read them yet and don't know quite enough about them to say: Anna Karenina, two books of Chekhov stories, several books of Greek plays, Le Père Goriot (but that one's in French so I guess it doesn't matter! :P), We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, and Demons by Dostoyevsky"

Aside from the rainbow shelves (which if you wanna do in your personal collection I'm fine with it, but not a fan of it in a bookstore), the $1floor is not well-labeled and organized (which according to a worker there it's because of the number of books they get everyday the books on the shelves are always moving around), which is understandable, but when I was looking around most of the time I had no idea even what section I was in or how to look for books/authors I was interested in."

I know this isn't within everyone's means, but the best option is to attach (with glue) a 1 1/2x3/4"" strip on the front edge of the shelf (so the shelf look 1 1/2"" inches thick.) This will keep shelves up to 3' wide from sagging. It works best when you make your own shelves, obviously, but most shelves can be modified in a way that looks nice if you know what you're doing."

Would you recommand a certain kind of wood for the strips? (For the glue, i guess there exists some special wood glue, the guy in the hardware store can set me up with?)   And is there a structural reason for glueing them to the front, or could they be glued in the middle? Or in the back? (my laymen reasing here ist, they would be less visible in the middle, especially when ""know what your're doing"" might be a prolem :) By glueing them in the back under the board, that would solve the problems with books, that already almost dont fit in the shelves)"

The thicker the piece, the stronger. A hardwood like oak or maple is strongest, but I usually use poplar or pine because they are cheaper. The reason doing it in front of the edge rather than under it is that it takes up less space."

bookshelf,35l4mk,serke,3,Mon May 11 13:54:20 2015 UTC,"If you happen to have some heavier books and not the sturdiest of bookshelf, sagging bookshelves/-boards can become a real problem.  I've thought about some support-systems, and there are many factors to think of:   The solution should be adjustable in height: In my shelves, the space between boards differs up to 1 cm (0.4 inch). So just putting a fixed peace of wood in is not an option. The solution should be cheap: If one bookshelf has 6 boards, you will need 5 supporters, so that the weight will get distributed down to the bottom. So if you have many shelves, times 5 per shelf, times say 5 $, you quickly add up some money.  The solution should be small/slim, so it doesnt mess with the shelving/display of the books.   I've come up with the solution in the photo. Basically, its a threaded steel-rod with shims and nuts to adjust to different heights. Books can be placed beside it with almost no space wasted.  This is obviously not the best solution. So i thought, why not ask r/bookshelves for ideas? So, do you have the same problem? If yes, have you thought about it or already got a solution?

I've gotten to know some estate liquidators in my area and they'll tell me when a big sale is coming up; occasionally, they'll let me take the first crack at it. Book prices vary wildly in the estate liquidation business, but since books seem to be universally regarded as an inconsequential slice of the estate profit pie, and since almost nobody has any relevant expertise in this matter, they're always a bargain (1$ to 3$ per book).   Other collectors have also helped--by trading duplicates, for instance--or simply giving me their books."

I asked my mother what happened to the rest of them and she said we sold them at a yard sale, which I didn't remember.  I went onto eBay and bought a huge lot of them.  I have a couple of duplicates and a few other horror books from that time from different authors, including Pike as well, but I love it.  I am still missing a few of the primary Fear Street books, which I will get around to getting off eBay eventually.  I didn't read the later Fear Street ones, the different series and such, just more so the original set.  When I was in 6th grade, in my Scholastic Book Order form one time there was a Fear Street club you could join.  The initial signup was a bunch of merch and 2 fear street books.  From that point on, for however much it was, each month they would send me 2 new Fear Street books.  I did this for so long that they were running out of R.L. Stine books to send me and started sending classic horror ones like Dracula and The Headless Horseman/Sleepy Hallow.  I had so many of them.  I love looking at them, I love the covers so much."

You've clearly bought your collection for content rather than aesthetic appeal and with that sort of library a slightly haphazard look goes with the territory.  It adds to the appeal for other book-lovers, reflecting all the variations and byways of the things that interest you.    Having said that, your collection is actually pretty consistent in subjects and look, so you don't really need to worry anyway! :)"

I know colour coordination looks pretty, but it would pain me to separate books in series. I think the few forward facing books really add to the look.   The only thing to me that looks KINDA messy is the books that are stacked on the far side because it doesn't really fit in with everything else."
bookshelf,2z7fk6,Zihaela,3,Mon Mar 16 14:01:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The only reason the ones at the end are like that is because I just don't have anywhere else to put them at the moment and most of them are just oversized.

I would say organize them the way that you're most comfortable with. If you want to do that by size, color, or alphabetical...whatever works for you. I keep mine by genre and then alphabetical by author within each genre. (Non fic is arranged by subject). Because my books are all shapes and sizes (even within series) things look kind of messy, even though they are organized. If I put books by size (all hardbacks together, paperbacks together, etc) it would look neater, but it would drive me crazy because stuff would be split up. For some people that's not an issue though (also, some people specifically only collect books by one author or in a series that are the same size for that reason...).  Anyway. Tl;dr:  organize them whichever way you're most comfortable with, don't worry about whether they look messy or not."
bookshelf,2z7fk6,jefferyffe,2,Tue Mar 17 15:18:09 2015 UTC,"Two techniques I like are: 1) arrange by color - obvious downsides are that bibliophiles and library studies majors are going to call you a turd for having no way of locating a book and no sense of order. But I don't care.  2) if possible, adjust the heights of the shelves so that some shelves are taller than others, fitting the heights of shelves to the heights of the books, so there isn't as much space above the books before the next shelf starts. It looks much tidier, but of course most shelves arent adjustable.   Or just make them how they are, books and chaos look good together"

A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again or Consider the Lobster are both good choices.  I see one Bukowski book on your shelf but I can't read its title.  Based on the presence of IJ, some Palahniuk, and HoL, you clearly don't mind reading about fucked up people. Why not try something from a real-life fuck up?

Kids judge books by their covers. There's a world of difference between a Harry Potter book with its jacket and without (the American version anyway; UK editions are not evil... and have better artwork, too!). Kids don't take care of their books, the jackets get torn, then the books are hard to sell, or even give away to new children. But, maybe that's the publisher's intention.  You could remove all of the covers and pack them flat in storage... an under-bed bin, or between two slabs of cardboard you tape together and tuck away where you don't have to think about it. Then retrieve a cover if you ever sell or donate the book(s) later."

bookshelf,2xwex6,AmbrosiaSage,10,Wed Mar 4 23:37:36 2015 UTC,"Not the majority. I really don't get this question, whenever it comes up. Once you get into real bookshelving, into assembling a personal library, it becomes as much if not more about collecting books that you like, that you would read, about topics that you are interested in, about knowledge you want to have at your fingertips if you need it, as it is about reading books. A personal library is a personal collection, a mirror of interests and opinions and thoughts of the collector. No, i have not read most of it. I do not have to read all 11000 pages of Goethes collected works, to appreciate them sitting in my shelf. I do not have to read any of the 6 books of Marx/Engels collected works, to enjoy having the writings of one/two of the most influential people of modern times. This just as some examples."
bookshelf,2xwex6,TosTosT,23,Wed Mar 4 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"The question (when I ask it, anyway) is simply to mentally place you on a graph with reading on one axis and book collecting on the other.  While the two often come together, they are not mutually dependent; somebody like yourself would be quite far along the collecting scale but not the reading scale, for example, whereas somebody on a low income who lives close to a library might be far along the reading scale but not the collecting scale.  People who buy and/or read books like to know about how other people buy and/or read books.  That's why we're here looking at other people's bookshelves, after all."

However, if I walked into someone's home and they had a ton of dvd's, I might ask, 'have you watched all these?'  That might put the person on the defensive, but that wouldn't be my intent.

bookshelf,2xpnoy,ISUanthony,7,Mon Mar 2 21:27:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. I've got bookshelves like that - except mine came via Amazon. They do have wheels but can be locked. And while the bookshelves are pretty sturdy the wheels are not. If I had it to do over I'd go wheel less. I bought sturdy plastic shelf liner to put down under the books. I don't have any real bookends but I do have lots of big beavy books. I just lay a couple/three of them flat on each end of the shelf and it works fine.  Hope that helps.
bookshelf,2xpnoy,AllwaysConfused,4,Mon Mar 2 22:16:24 2015 UTC,What exactly do you mean by the wheels aren't sturdy? Please go into that more because I am debating whether or not the wheels would be very useful.
bookshelf,2xpnoy,AllwaysConfused,5,Mon Mar 2 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"These are the shelves I bought: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A0ZFRW/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1  The wheels are plastic and snap together. If you can find a shelving system with wheels that are really wheels, like hard rubber library car wheels or heavy duty casters that mechanics use to move their toolboxes, then I would think they would be just fine. Also, the wheels aren't screwed in, they just slide into holes in the bottom of each leg. They have a lot of positive reviews at amazon, but I wouldn't buy them again.   These http://www.amazon.com/Weber-70360-Locking-Caster/dp/B00JSVRNOI/ref=sr_1_54?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1425341758&sr=1-54&keywords=casters  are very similar to the casters that came with the shelves.   I would suggest something more like these that I have been considering replacing the old wheels with:  http://www.amazon.com/Wagner-Caster-Swivel-Bearing-Capacity/dp/B003E7ECMI/ref=sr_1_9?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1425341997&sr=1-9&keywords=casters  Or just go to your local home improvement or hardware store and explain what you want and why you want it. Sometimes they can be helpful"
bookshelf,2xpnoy,bookchaser,2,Tue Mar 3 00:23:24 2015 UTC,"Dang, I want those plastic inserts.   I use that style shelf, with wheels and without inserts, for garage storage (plastic crates), my entertainment center, and in a closet. I've used them 14 years with no issues.   With wheels, it makes rearranging a room a snap. And electronic equipment has excellent venting on the bottom (if you don't use an insert).  Buy some bungie cords to run across the back and sides, and you solve the issue of upright books falling off. The only issue is, if you store books upright, you'll be wasting half the depth of the shelf space.   I think they would also work better and last longer when I have to disassemble and move them.   The shelves are a pain to disassemble and reassemble (but it's much easier if you have another person to help, because the platforms need to be lowered level onto plastic rings you snap onto the vertical poles). But, if you're not moving often, then great. If we're talking about changing apartments across town, I'd want to move the shelves intact and save myself the trouble.  Per other comments about the wheels, I bought my shelves at Costco, and they're commercial quality. In fact, these shelves are used extensively in restaurants in my region. I have no idea what brand shelves I have."
bookshelf,2xpnoy,Ian666,2,Tue Mar 3 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"If you find these sort of bookshelfs aesthetic, only you can tell. But, it can be worth having shelfs that can hold more weight than Billys - I have Billys and many of the boards are bending. This may not occur if you only have paperbacks, but if you have some hardcovers or heavy books, bending can be a problem with Billys."
bookshelf,2xpnoy,sun827,3,Wed Mar 4 12:24:09 2015 UTC,"I use that style of shelf. I've bought them from Home Depot and target. Never got the ones with casters. I have about a half dozen of them. Usinsg some simple fasteners screwed through the back of the  shelves I can attach them to the walls to keep them plumb and child safe. I didnt bother with the plastic inserts but instead used 1/4"" birch plywood. I'm a contractor so I have tons of the scrap laying around. I also used it as the bookends. They've been great throughout all my moves; which was originally the reason I bought them. I've taken them down and put them back up so many times Ive lost count. They're great because you can adjust them as your collection grows and changes. I have been thinking about building boxes of about the same dimensions as the shelves (one ""bay"" if you will, so that I have 4 boxes to equal one set of the wire shelves.) out of 1/2 plywood so I can just stack and unstack them as I move instead of breaking everything down and packing up when its time to move again."
bookshelf,2xpnoy,spindrjr,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:05:15 2015 UTC,"Most of my collection is currently housed on these shelves. You can see pictures here. As I have almost exclusively hardcovers, I need very sturdy shelves which I can't get in wood for anywhere near this price, especially with two rows of books per shelf.  I believe all of mine are Seville Classics. The two smaller ones I ordered directly from Seville's website and the larger one I obtained as a hand-down. All of mine have heavy duty casters that hold up no problem, unlike the cheap office chair style casters mentioned by /u/allwaysconfused. Amazon seems to picture cheap casters and your link seems to picture the heavy duty ones mine came with, so not sure. You can see mine in a couple of the pictures and if you get these casters they should be good for any of your uses. I can't imagine you could pack much more book weight on these shelves than I have.  As you noted, you need to have a plan to hold the books up on the sides. I wanted all mine upright so I have bookends on almost all of the rows.  I have also though about using these as double-sided but don't have a suitable place in my current apartment. In my case, I would be concerned about the tipping weight if you have hardcovers all the way up. If you could arrange it so more weight is on the bottom, it might be less of an issue."

They just ended up on the same shelf and I happen to like them both a lot. But honestly I'd recommend checking out Glen Cook anyways!   He writes fantasy. The Black Company is one of the series you see there, about a band of mercenaries. It's different because they're in a morally ambiguous spot, and just fighting for whoever pays them. Glen Cook is a vet so he has the whole dark sense of humor and sense of companionship amongst the soldiers down, and that's what drives the story even though it's fantasy. Plus there's kind of a dark backdrop with some scary monsters and magic even though it's not horror.   Garrett Files is the other series I have several books of on that shelf. It's a little more zaney and humorous. It's also a lot of fun, and I don't even particularly like mysteries.

The top shelf only bendt a bit on the sides when I first put a whole Encyclopedia on it. I could easily have prevented this by using a fourth rail.

""I'd like $40 for them"".  -gulp-  ""I'll be there in half an hour"" hahahaha  I asked only about the 20-volume 1989 set (the second edition after the 1933 first), but the seller threw in the compact OED of the 1933 edition too. It's four pages reduced and printed on one, and typically comes with a magnifying glass (also missing, in my set). ...he also included the first two (of three) additional volumes, added in 1993.

The fun part about a hard copy is that you think you are only looking up one word, but in flipping to it, and landing on another page or two, you encounter others. It's really wonderul browsing.   The only close digital analogy is Amazon's ""you might like"" suggestions. You know, like walking down an aisle in a library and looking for a specific book, you find ten others.

Although it's one of those metal coin banks, where you place the coin somewhere (this: hand), press a button or pull a lever, and it activates a trap to drop it in the slot. I had another one where it was a fishing themed one in the 90s."

Unfortunately I had it from the library so I don't own it. There are quite a few books that I've read but I don't have them because they were borrowed, which sort of bothers me because I want them all and look at them and love them :D   Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie   My friend read that book during a vacation we took and she didn't recommend it, saying it was a bit too abstract and overwritten, and on top of that I didn't really like the one Rushdie book I own, so I'm sort of reluctant to get into Satanic Verses. Could you elaborate a bit please and describe it?   Not a book- but have you seen Dark City? Think that'd be up your alley too.   Yes! Great movie, I often recommend it to others, too."

bookshelf,2rbgtu,MufasaSimba,2,Sat Jan 10 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is mine.  That is actually why I put the ""humble"" part into the title (although people don't seem to like that.  I had posted this on /r/roomporn and compared to the multi-million dollar rooms on there, it's pretty modest.  The wood is actually pretty dark, so if you wanted to go darker it would be a dark stained cherry or something along on those lines that you would need to use.  It's mostly mahogany so definitely not a ""light"" colored.  I can't give you a specific amount of time that it took to make.  I would say we bought the shelves, desk, chairs, furniture over the course of a few months.  The books I have acquired over the years (still collecting).  But we often make changes.  Most recently the matching stained glass desk and overhead light fixture.  As for cost... geez.. who the heck really knows.  I actually don't have a good idea as some of the books are valuable.  The painting is a few hundred years old, so that is worth something.  The light fixtures were custom made, but we have a stained glass hobbyist in the family so I actually didn't pay for them to be made."

I personally love to read from beautiful books, but I recently had an argument with my friend's SO who said that the classics sets aren't meant to be read. Half of his are sitting on their shelf is still wrapped in the plastic he got them in (maybe printed five years ago). What are your thoughts?"
bookshelf,2r2pje,ceci_na_pas_une_ame,3,Fri Jan 2 07:03:03 2015 UTC,"1) the whole display is stunning   I'm glad you think so! I love it, and I loved going through the old books to see what my family had (they've been in this cupboard for ages but I never looked closely at them)   2) do you/your father/ family members read from those books?   I would love to read from them, but for most of them, we don't. There are some from around 1890—1904 (the works of Disraeli and Flaubert and one of the Encyclopædia Britannica sets and a few others) that are really fragile/valuable (one started chipping when I was moving it around tonight). The rest, I'm not around enough to read them as I live in a different province.   No one else reads them, either. My family isn't hugely academic (the books were inheritance from my grandfather) so reading isn't among the things they particularly enjoy. My father actually considers them decorations and had them lying around (a couple of the Disraelis were in the window with visible UV damage) and doesn't seem to see much value in them.  I can understand your friend's sentiment but they are books and they are meant to be read. If they're super old, valuable, or fragile, I can understand not reading them to preserve them, but there is nothing quite like reading beautiful books.   TL;DR: Most of the time I think they're there to be read"

bookshelf,2qz3ra,codenameturtle,1 point,Fri Jan 2 04:11:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I know what you mean...I have the hardest time finding graphic novel recommendations. I love all of Craig Thompson's stuff, so Habibi and Goodbye, Chunky Rice are definitely up there (Habibi is absolutely beautiful, and Chunky Rice, though it looks like a little kid's cartoon, makes me bawl every time). Uh...as far as more graphic memoirs, Stitches by David Small is pretty cool and disturbing, and Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi is such an amazing and powerful story (though I've only read part one so far). Fun Home by Alison Bechdel has a pretty good following, though I'm not crazy about how she uses her father's suicide as a shoehorn for her own coming-out story.   CAN'T forget Art Spiegelman's Maus if you want to feel awful about life for a while--fantastic book, strong feels. If you want to dabble more into the comic book/superhero side, Watchmen and V for Vendetta are absolute classics (Alan Moore, despite being insane, is pretty brilliant. I've heard Swamp Thing, also by him, is pretty good). Also in that vein, Gaiman's Sandman series is kinda neat and fantastical, though that's really starting to move towards comic series rather than graphic novel (I'm only a fan of the first few issues, anyway, but they are amazing).   Hope this helps!"

My only caveat would be that the backing is cheap folded cardboard, not a huge problem if you plan to fill up the shelves but it's flimsy looking and certainly does not hold up terribly well if you're not careful about moving the shelves from place to place.  Speaking of moving, I was able to carry 5 of the big ones down the stairs by myself when moving from my old office to my basement. Not easily, but I did it. =) So they are sturdy but also fairly light, considering. I have also moved many of these from one place to another after getting them from craigslist (why buy new if you don't have to?).  Oh yeah, here's a photo of all mine in one place: http://i.imgur.com/wHeJqEf.jpg  These particular doors are discontinued and it took a long time but I finally found enough on craigslist to fill the rest of the shelves, no picture yet though."

bookshelf,2qwgye,felixofGodsgrace,3,Thu Jan 1 07:29:53 2015 UTC,"Depends on your budget. And how many books you have.   If you have access to an Ikea or another furniture store I would suggest that you check them out first. I love Amazon but buying large furniture sight unseen is not the best option, imo.   Also, always remember that you get what you pay for. If you have a lot of books and you can only afford one shelf you probably need to buy the most well made shelf you can, or the weight of the books will start to buckle the wood. This would probably be an issue with shelves you put together yourself like ones from Ikea or Amazon.   Hope that helps."

bookshelf,2p7sku,TeaChick,2,Tue Dec 16 14:18:16 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and tips! I am also an idiot and failed to realize I wrote down Lost Symbol instead of Inferno. Also a phenomenal read and continuation of the Robert Langdon saga. I have to say so, I think Tom Hanks plays him perfectly in the movies."

bookshelf,2p5zk6,Shappie,1 point,Sat Dec 13 11:23:00 2014 UTC,Don't tell me that's a 1st edition Hobbit. Or Catch-22. Or Dune.  Cause if they are. SHIT.
bookshelf,2p5zk6,felixofGodsgrace,2,Sat Dec 13 13:45:49 2014 UTC,"I wish.  I'm sure you can imagine my reaction when seeing them on the shelves, though.    The Hobbit is a third edition 32nd printing.  Catch-22 and Dune are both unfortunately book club editions but even those are very uncommon.  I do, however, have a first edition of The Return of the King.  It's in the plastic next to The Book of Lost Tales.  It didn't come out very well in the picture."
bookshelf,2p5zk6,CaptainGibb,1 point,Sat Dec 13 14:09:33 2014 UTC,"I was wondering what that was! I have a book club edition of Carrie by Stephen King, which from the shelf looked like a 1st edition, and a 1st edition 7th printing of Catch-22 which, again, from the shelf looked like a 1st printing.   Oh well!  Nice collection!"

bookshelf,2p1238,wrong_again,1 point,Fri Dec 12 02:45:30 2014 UTC,Yea I think so. They were also selling it on Book Outlet for $9.99 but it was Scratch and Dent and I didn't want to take any chances that it would show up with half the pages ripped or something. Still don't know if I actually want Much Ado though. I might just get R&J and call it a day.

I might have to redesign my layout... help blend in those series where I've got most in paperback but couldn't wait when the new ones came out and got them in hard back! haha For serious though we seem to have the exact same taste in books and would love to know if you're on goodreads (or would like to just recommend some new stuff) :)
bookshelf,2p1238,Zihaela,1 point,Fri Dec 12 13:40:51 2014 UTC,I absolutely hate that! I have actually gone back and bought a series in all hardback or paperback just make sure everything matched.

bookshelf,2osyv8,fallstaffinfection,14,Tue Dec 9 23:02:02 2014 UTC,"Well, I got a wild hair (hare?) and decided to rip out my home library. Its been a great room but its time to step up the game a bit. I will be recreating the room as a library again, one with my own stamp on it. I want more shelf space and more style. First order of business was to drop the floor since it is sitting over crawl space. The new floor will be 2 feet lower giving me 10' ceilings (also an excuse to get a library ladder right?). The shelving will be floor to ceiling and wall to wall on all 4 walls. I have not settled on any particular design. Given the space of the room (about 11' x 16' wide and 10' tall) what would you do? I would love some suggestions and examples. If interested, I will continue to post the progress as I go. The only design element that is settled, is that I will building with paint grade materials and eventually painting everything white (floor will be hardwood). The price between stain grade wood and paint grade is massive, and I also really like the white look. I think it showcases the books more and makes the books the focus. I haven't settled on any of the architectural design, shelf/room lighting, secret compartments, ceiling design etc..."

Here are my goodreads list: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22218692-drudoo   I read a lot (at least I think so), this year i've read (so far): 2001: A Space Odyssey, Jaws, Ender's Game, The Possibilities, The Lord of the Rings, Tarzan of the Apes, the Da Vinci Code, 1Q84, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Lolita and a few others.   My bookshelf is just a small part of what I read. A lot is ebooks, audiobooks or from the library."
bookshelf,2o8sq3,staticquantum,0,Fri Dec 5 11:05:36 2014 UTC,"Great! Glad you're not just reading a bunch of junk. I use an e-reader so my shelf doesn't necessarily reflect my tastes either.  With that said, I'm of the opinion that there are too many great books in the world to waste time on crap. Most of what I see on the shelf is crap which is why I responded in the first place.  Based on what I see, I think you'd enjoy Cormac McCarthy if you haven't already read him.  If you liked Lolita, you should try Pnin or Pale Fire.  Based on your interest in science/sci-fi, you may enjoy Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (though I wouldn't be surprised if you've already read it) or the Forever War.  You should also try Richard Powers (maybe start with Plowing the Dark) if you're into science.  As far as classic lit goes, Chekhov and Borges are excellent, and both have a LOT of short stories that you can read in bite-size chunks.  David Foster Wallace has some great fiction and non-fiction work that I think everyone should read.  Based on what I've read recently, I'll recommend Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee, Giovanni's Room by James Baldwin, White Noise by Don Delillo, Love in the Ruins by Walker Percy, Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry, Distant Star by Roberto Bolano, The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera, and Wolf in White Van by John Darnielle.  Anyway, sorry if that was long-winded.  It was somewhat impromptu. Hope it's helpful."
