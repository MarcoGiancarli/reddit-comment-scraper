Stockhausen's music was always a little too goofy for me...but you've gotta appreciate its conceptual ambition."
NotTimAndEricPics,2adt46,catlaw,1 point,Sat Jul 12 02:06:12 2014 UTC,"I think his son (Simon Stockhausen) is a greater talent and an amazing sound designer, he's making far more practical contributions to the advancement of electronic music than his father (who also seemed condescending to Aphex Twin and Plastikman) did."
NotTimAndEricPics,2adt46,catlaw,3,Sat Jul 12 05:58:36 2014 UTC,"Wow..in every arena Stockhausen comes off as kind of a jerk. Aphex Twin's reaction was hilarious: ""I wonder if he can't dance.""  I'm checking out Simon Stockhausen. Very cool. I've never been much into ambient electronic/musique concrete (if that's what this is?), but ""Spectrality"" is pretty immersive."
NotTimAndEricPics,2adt46,plumsaucemillionaire,2,Sat Jul 12 19:28:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I reckon the late Stockhausen distanced himself from the younger innovators instead of creating more bridges as a mentor â€” compare that to, say, Philip Glass (who collaborated with Aphex Twin, who has used Cage-ian prepared piano sounds, bringing us back full circle).  I think the younger Stockhausen has more of a gift for melody, evident in the audio demos for the soundbanks he's created. I'm so terribad with genre names but I like when something is experimental AND catchy."
