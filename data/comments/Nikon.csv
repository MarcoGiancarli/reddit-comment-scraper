Nikon,3e7h6b,twoandonly,2,Wed Jul 22 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"I'd say stick with an 18-105 until you determine what focal length you prefer - if you constantly find yourself at 105, and need more reach, then you can look at a lens with a 200mm focal length as your next purchase.  Or conversely, if you find yourself at 18mm but still not able to fit everything in, start thinking about a Tokina 11-16 (AMAZING lens, had mine for 6 years).  But really its all about what your shooting, and your own style.  I will say this: unless you are shooting portraits, dont get a ""nifty fifty"" because everyone says to.  Its an odd focal length on a crop sensor(I barely used mine when my D90 was my primary camera - I use it all the time now that I have a D600).  If you really want a good prime, get a 35mm instead."

Have the ISO be no higher than 1600,  but really your lighting should be good. A white background and white sheet on the bottom helps. Camera on a small tripod is even better. Use single point focus and focus on one point of the object, have your camera a little further out, you can even try using the telephoto lens.

Nikon,3dyfdi,justkauz,5,Mon Jul 20 15:36:11 2015 UTC,I've owned one for a very long time and never seen it to be honest. I always shoot RAW. I mess with some shots a lot and have never seen any issues in acceptable ranges.   It's a great camera ;-)
Nikon,3dyfdi,HoldenBurn1000,4,Mon Jul 20 16:43:31 2015 UTC,"Well, it's there, but it's never been a problem for me. I can only see it if I'm pushing the exposure +3 or more in post. In my experience, though, I only push things that far if I'm in extreme recovery mode of a wildly incorrect exposure. I've seen it turn up under 5 times in my pictures, and every one of those was a case of ""I really screwed that exposure, but let's see what I can get out of it.""  A lot of the examples you see of banding are shots asking for more from the dynamic range than you can reasonably expect. People shooting with full sun in the background and trying to pull out the darkest shadows. The DR on the 7100 is good, but it can't do miracles. In those cases, you're better off bracketing and merging them in Lightroom, anyway.  I say absolutely get the 7100. It's a gem. If you do come across some banding, Topaz DeNoise clears it all up brilliantly.   TL;DR: Banding = Rarely a problem, and only shows up due to asking more of the dynamic range than is reasonable. D7100 = Great camera."
Nikon,3dyfdi,rpshaub,2,Mon Jul 20 18:13:02 2015 UTC,"I never saw anything out of the ordinary when I owned one. Actually, I never had heard of it being ""an issue"". Keep in mind that pretty much all cameras will show chroma banding when pushing the image in post far enough."
Nikon,3dyfdi,evanrphoto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"I noticed it for first time today when I pushed the exposure up 4 stops in Lightroom on one of my shots.  Using the same lense for multiple other shots shortly before and after that in the same light, I don't see it when I push up the exposure on the other shots.  I've taken a few 1000 shots with this camera now and this was the first and only time I've noticed it (but I also don't usually try to up the exposure by several stops in Lightroom).  I love the camera so far by the way!"
Nikon,3dyfdi,Unowned,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:14 2015 UTC,It happens but I wouldn't worry about it.  I have a D7100 and have noticed banding but that is pretty rare.  I push the shadows on a lot of shots with no banding.  I think I have noticed it on two of my thousands of shots with it.  It was a night sky background where I could see the banding.  I think it was mostly over processing.  I was still able to make those shots work by reprocessing them a different way making the banding disappear in the final image.
Nikon,3dwr9f,PinballHelp,9,Mon Jul 20 04:23:10 2015 UTC,D750. Amazing camera that has some awesome video features. Probably nikons most advance video DSLR right now. Check it out in some reviews
Nikon,3dwr9f,ae716,4,Mon Jul 20 05:08:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The D750 is fantastic, and the tilt screen is great for video!"
Nikon,3dwr9f,tehgeekguy,2,Mon Jul 20 05:21:38 2015 UTC,"So you all think I should go FX and not mess with DX?   Is DX not worth messing with, and more of an entry-level thing?"
Nikon,3dwr9f,Buckeye70,4,Mon Jul 20 05:52:47 2015 UTC,"People always say that when you start outgrowing your gear, then it's time to buy. You seem to have hit a wall with your current gear, so now's the time to jump in.   I'd agree with the D750. All the reviews say it's a home run. And with the tilt-lcd and other video features (plus the low light performance) you can't get a better deal out there.  Ditch the DX...Sell those to help pay for the body or one good piece of FX glass."
Nikon,3dwr9f,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:40:34 2015 UTC,There's nothing really wrong with DX - video off my D7200 looks fantastic and you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between it and my D750 - but the DX and D6X0 bodies are all crippled in one way or another for video.   D600/D610 and all DX bodies - no aperture control in movie mode. This means you have to exit movie mode to change the aperture and means your exposure changes with variable aperture zooms when you zoom. The new E lenses should make this problem go away but it will always exist for legacy lenses - legacy lenses now meaning G or earlier. D7200 - 1080/60p is only available is 1.3x crop mode!? Also doesn't have the extremely useful flip or articulating screen of the D750 or D5X00.   You can work around these limitations but they do slow you down a bit and make it less enjoyable.  Realtime AF sucks for video on all Nikon DSLRs.   The D5500 is the camera to look at if video is a major concern and you want to stick with Nikon and you're on a budget. The articulating screen is just too useful.  The D750 is Nikon's Goldilocks camera for video (and just about everything really) right now if you can justify the price. Much more pleasant to use in video mode due to the power aperture control and the flip screen is way better than no flip screen for video (although not as handy as a full articulating screen like the D5500).   You had a D200 and D700 so the D750's price shouldn't scare you too much. Some people don't like the amateur body after shooting with the semi-pro bodies like the D200/700 though. If that's the case then the D8X0 series may be what you want but you give up the handy flip screen.
Nikon,3dwr9f,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:31:39 2015 UTC,"no aperture control in movie mode   Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't this kill the usefulness of the unit?  The one thing that separates DSLR video from regular video cameras is the quality of graduation of depth of field?  I do have to say, the D700 has not held up nearly as well as my D200.  It seems to me the D700 is built lower quality than my D200.  Thoughts?"
Nikon,3dwr9f,KhaiNguyen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really kill the usefulness of them, just makes them more annoying to use when shooting video. You can still set the aperture anywhere you want, you just have to do it before you enter movie mode. Normally you wouldn't be changing the aperture during a shot anyway but it means that when you do want to change aperture you have to exit movie mode, set the aperture where you want and then go back into movie mode. Just extra steps when you're setting up your shots.   The other thing that happens is if you're zooming with a variable aperture zoom, the aperture changes in proportion when you zoom so if you're zoomed out wide at f/8 with a f4-5.6 zoom then when you zoom in the aperture will go to 11 and drop your exposure by a stop (which can be compensated for with auto ISO but that can cause other problems).   Don't know about D200 vs D700 build."
Nikon,3dwr9f,urbaneyezcom,3,Tue Jul 21 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, the D750 is a fantastic camera and a great upgrade for your photography since you already have a nice collection of FX glass but be aware that though the D750 has some nice features for videos it still lacks some key features too.   No focus-peaking to help with manual focusing. No touch screen which would be very useful for changing focus while in liveview/video mode. The AF in liveview/video mode is painfully slow and it hunts a lot.   I love the D750, I have 2 of them for photography, but when it comes to video I'd rather pick up my Canon 70D because it has  great liveview AF and a touchscreen.  My niece creates videos professionally and started out with my 70D but have since upgraded to a GH4 because it has some essential video features missing from the 70D.  Honestly, for videos, there are better alternatives than anything Nikon has to offer right now but if you must stay with Nikon then the D750 is currently Nikon's best DLSR for videos."
Nikon,3dwr9f,randombullet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:24:29 2015 UTC,This is something I'm seriously considering.   I'm editing video with Canons and I love how changing depth of field adds a lot of style to videos.  If I can't do that with Nikon the way it's done with Canon that could be an issue.
Nikon,3dwr9f,urbaneyezcom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:41 2015 UTC,That's all done in manual focus.  Honestly if you're shooting video professionally you should be using manual focus.  The AF is not a good bet because it can always hunt.  I run a production business and use the d800 and d600 regularly.  The d800 is my favorite and even better than the d4 b/c of the crop factor.  But the d750 looks to be a great value.  I have not used it yet though.
Nikon,3dwr9f,RynoL_11,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"I have a D800 that I use for video. I couple that with a 70-200 f2.8 VRII for some beautiful bokehlicious shots.  Power aperture is awesome as well as being able to see the histogram via the info button.  Manual focus and zoom is a dream on the 70-200.  Remember to set your shutter speed to two times of your frame rate, Also use the lowest contrast, saturation, and vibrancy for color control. This allows you to do more to your video as you're editing."
Nikon,3dwr9f,urbaneyezcom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:26:49 2015 UTC,I use the d800 too.  All good points you mention.  I rarely see anyone else out there shooting video on the d800 but here we are.  I actually chose the d800 over the d4 because of the d4's crop mode when shooting video prohibits you from getting wide angles.
Nikon,3dw8rx,Ruht_Roh,4,Mon Jul 20 01:31:57 2015 UTC,"From what I see, the ""blurred"" images are just out of focus.  In the GTO shot, notice that the windshield and side mirror are sharp.  Try using single point focus?"

Nikon,3dw8rx,MughalPrince22,3,Mon Jul 20 01:42:34 2015 UTC,"Instead of using the auto focus or mode, learn to shoot in aperture or shutter priority. Then learn to pick AF-S, and use the d-pad to pick the exact point you want the camera to focus on."
Nikon,3dw8rx,neuromonkey,2,Mon Jul 20 02:17:19 2015 UTC,"Alright, thank you for the advice. I'll try it out. :)"
Nikon,3dw8rx,r_golan_trevize,4,Mon Jul 20 02:18:55 2015 UTC,"In this case, you want aperture priority. You want to shoot with the aperture as small (LARGE f-stop number,) as possible. The GTO pic has a depth-of-field (how much depth that's in focus) that's shallower that the distance from the side mirror to the front grill.  The 18-55 is a very good, inexpensive lens. That's the one I'd use. It's sharpest (if I recall correctly,) at about f/8, though you'll get a deeper DoF at higher numbers (it stops down to f/22 or f/36, depending on zoom) you'll get more in focus. Shooting at f/3.5--with the aperture all the way open--you'll gather lots of light, but you'll have a shallow depth-of-field.  The smaller your aperture, the longer your exposure needs to be; small f numbers == longer shutter times. You can compensate for that in three ways: increase your ISO setting (gets grainy,) shoot with more light, or use a tripod. A long exposure shot on a tripod will make any moving object motion blurred.  I recommend the book Understanding Exposure for complete coverage of these concepts. You can usually find used copies for under $10."
Nikon,3dw8rx,r_golan_trevize,2,Mon Jul 20 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks a lot for the information, the video really helped, and I will take a look at the book tomorrow. :D"
Nikon,3dw8rx,Sardonnicus,3,Wed Jul 22 06:15:10 2015 UTC,"Be aware that of the D40's three available focus points, the center one is the most reliable and I wouldn't trust the two outer ones at all if you turn the camera in the portrait orientation. You should be OK in daylight in landscape orientation though but if you're shooting late in the day when the contrast starts dropping then they can get a little flaky.  You can point the center AF point at what part you want to be in focus and then lock focus by pressing and holding the AE/AF lock button on the back of the camera and then move the camera to compose the shot the way you want it. That's pretty much the way I use the D40.  If you want to get more of the car in focus, try shooting in A mode and stopping down the aperture to increase the depth of field. Outside in daylight, you shouldn't have any problems doing that. f/8~f/11 is a good place to be and I wouldn't go past f/16 or diffraction may become a problem making the image soft again. Shooting at a wide angle will also increase the depth of field."
Nikon,3dw8rx,neuromonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll give that a try, granted I'm still pretty new into using the Nikon, but I'm exited to learn. Thanks for the tips, I'll post an updated photo post later today possibly."

Nikon,3dttgl,acherion,6,Sun Jul 19 11:56:25 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you need an all-purpose lens and the 18-140 is a perfect choice.   The 18-140 is sharper than most zoom lenses, but where it lacks is in ""pin-cushioning"" or barrel distortion. For example, if you take a picture of a building, it might look slightly curved instead of straight. This is a common issue for all zooms of this breadth.     Build quality of the 18-140 is going to be slightly better thand the 18-55.   In the end, both lenses will perform about the same from 18-55. The 18-140 will give you the extra reach - so go for it."
Nikon,3dttgl,decorama,2,Sun Jul 19 12:53:14 2015 UTC,It's the 18-140mm lens that I went for with my D7100. The lens is good but I have to agree about the barrowing at the lower ranges.  The OP will have to ensure he leaves enough space surrounding his image to correct this in  lightroom (or another software package)
Nikon,3dttgl,Horris_The_Horse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:42:36 2015 UTC,"Can you explain to me about lower ranges? Is this a photography thing where the more zoomed in you are with your lens is considered a lower range? Or does pin cushioning happen when you are zoomed out (eg at 18mm)?

Nikon,3dttgl,KaJashey,2,Sun Jul 19 23:30:18 2015 UTC,"If this will be your first DSLR lens, I say it's a great one to start with: it's versatile, it covers all relevant focal lengths (27-210mm), decent autofocus speed and the quality holds up pretty well.

Nikon,3dtffi,Prequalified,5,Sun Jul 19 14:37:30 2015 UTC,Tokina 11-20 f/2.8. It's the replacement for their excellent 11-16 f/2.8.
Nikon,3dtffi,Prequalified,2,Sun Jul 19 10:31:28 2015 UTC,I have the Nikon 10-24 and one thing you may want to be aware of is for landscapes you'll want to be at f8-f16 anyway so faster speeds won't do too much. The color rendering and sharpness are great although I don't have a 24mp DX.  I find the Tokina 11-16 to be a bit wide on the long end and I don't see a huge difference between f3.5 and 2.8 on the wide end. Having 24 mm available is more important to me. I saw Tokina was came out with a 11-20 and haven't used that but I would check it out.
Nikon,3dtffi,KeelBug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:23:07 2015 UTC,Whats the lense you'd recomend for landscapes? Seems like everyone likes using that 35mm f/1.8
Nikon,3dtffi,totallyshould,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"The 35mm is normal length on DX. You should have one but for landscapes you want something wider, under 15mm. I like the 10-24 because 24 mm is a normal wide, with basically the same angle of view as an iPhone. The Tokina might be nicer in certain conditions but if you have the 11-16 you'll want to bring a second lens. With the crazy high ISO of the D7200 the f stop is not as big a factor.  In either case you should get the 35 1.8. I'd say I use it 90% of the time. Definitely get that before any specialized lens."

It makes a kind of reverse lens hood. It won't cover the element, but it will recess it enough to protect it from getting knocked easily.   Depending on the lens you are using, you may get some vignetting. But that fixable enough via crop or editing in post."

Nikon,3dmbxt,HARDCORE-LOL,3,Fri Jul 17 16:48:21 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean if you reverse the lens for macro work is there a way to protect the rear element that is now exposed?  No, Nikon doesn't make any such thing. There are a small set of lenses that have a rear gel filter holder, but those are typically ultra wide or fisheye lenses (like the 14mm f/2.8 or 16mm fisheye).  Nikon's lenses are not designed to be be reversed (you can do it, but they're not designed with that use in mind) so they don't make a means of protecting that. Nikon's answer would probably be to buy an extension tube instead of a reverse mount and keep the rear element protected or buy a dedicated macro lens."

Nikon,3dnfhw,snapper1971,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:36:07 2015 UTC,"So, I am going to assume this is out of warranty.   general rule of thumb when electronics act up, go ahead and take the battery out and let it discharge fora day. It might clear things up.  Look at your contacts on the camera. See if anything is damaged or if there is dirt. Use rubbing alcohol and a qtip to clean both sets of contacts, on the camera and the lens.   If you electronic savvy, and ONLY electronic savy, you can do a voltage measurement for pin 1 ground (pin 7) to see if you are even getting power to the lens.   Next, does the lens autofocus without taking a picture? Half press the shutter instead of a full press. I am assuming this happens when you try to take a picture, curious if AF works  If it is autofocusing without taking an image, my bet is that your contacts are either dirty or broken.   If it does not autofocus and gives you the lens error, turn off autofocus and see if it works. If nothing works, either it is an internal problem or it is an internal problem :P. Contacts, CPU, board issues, you would have to send it in for repair.  Also, here is a pinout for reference: https://nikonhacker.com/wiki/F-Mount"
Nikon,3dnfhw,HVPhoto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:42:17 2015 UTC,Check the contacts on both camera and lenses.

I leave tomorrow so I can't tell you how well it worked for awhile, but playing around with it so far I've been pretty happy.  The VR makes daytime hand-held shots no problem, the lens is pretty sharp up through 400mm, and even in the 400-500mm range it's not bad at all.  Just based on shooting in the park, I'm definitely expecting that I'll be glad to have the length for the safari, and with VR that works well I'm happy to sacrifice a bit of speed for it."

Nikon,3dbp3k,Dr__Nick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:01:20 2015 UTC,70-200mm will only get you great shots if the animals are really close to you so you will definitely want more reach.  The Nikon 300mm prime might be a good choice.  I've rented the Tamron 150-600mm before for Yellowstone and got some great shots using it.  The I didn't feel like I was inhibited by the F5-6.3 speed since shots with higher ISO are still useable.  (I have a D7100 also)

Nikon,3d9nv4,jgreene128,3,Tue Jul 14 16:14:59 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on the 70-200 VRII, but having owned both the 80-200/2.8 AF-S and the 70-200/2.8 AF-S VRI for many years, I have never seen any perceptible difference in them optically or mechanically.  Shooting a lot of action, I never considered the (current) 80-200/2.8 non-AF-S model, because the AF-S lenses autofocus so much faster.   I have never felt that the VRI vibration reduction is particularly effective.  Also, if you're not craving the f2.8 max aperture, my current favorite lens in this focal length range is the Nikon 70-200/f4 VR model, which weighs half of what the 70-200/2.8 VR1 model does and is excellent optically. My 70-200/2.8 VRI is now my backup piece to this lens."
Nikon,3d9nv4,Moice,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:28:13 2015 UTC,Well I just bought a D750 and I think I would prefer the 2.8 just to give me even more low light ability but if the price is right I could probably do without it. I have a lot of research to do and just wanted everyone's opinions. Thanks a lot for your input!
Nikon,3d9nv4,Moice,2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"Prior to buying a pair of D750 bodies I never even considered an f4 lens in this range, but with those bodies  I have no reservations about bumping up the ISO to use the f4 lens.  I'm not faulting your logic at all, but after a 10 hour day of shooting pretty much non-stop, like yesterday and the day before (large higher education event) , every ounce of weight I don't have to carry is important to me."
Nikon,3d9nv4,totallyshould,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:43:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't been able to use the D750 in low light where I would be able to test out how much I can bump the ISO but I have heard good things! So from your experiences, 2.8 isn't as necessary with the 750 as it would be with others?"
Nikon,3d9nv4,TheFreneticist,2,Tue Jul 14 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on your expectation. I had the d7000 before, and I feel like 12,800 on the D750 is better than 6400 on the d7000, and maybe better than 3200. I had 6400 on the D7000 as ""usable if I nailed everything in camera, and at least I got the shot"", but the color and tonality really wasn't very good. Now when I use the 2.8 in low light I have flexibility to bump up the speed to freeze moving people (where before I lived with blur by timing it and shooting a burst), and can stop down for greater focal depth. Having that freedom in low light with such usable output is really pretty fantastic."
Nikon,3d9nv4,Moice,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:10:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, I felt I couldnt push my d7000 much beyond 3200 and am now very comfortable shooting the 750 at 12,800."
Nikon,3d9nv4,totallyshould,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:04:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're shooting. I shoot lots of very low available light work. For example, in a semi-darkened room with a PowerPoint presentation on screen.  My clients don't want minimal depth of field for most photos, so even when using an f2.8 or faster lens, I try to be at at least f4 for telephoto shots (speakers at a podium, audience reactions, etc.), and at least f5.6 for wide angle stuff.  My clients never, ever care about bokeh. They just want sharp, properly exposed and delivered images.  With my D800 body, I consider ISO 1600 to be the highest ISO I can shoot  for deliverable images unless there's just no other way to get sharp images by bumping it up.  With the D750 bodies, and to a very slightly lesser extent, the D610, I have no reservations about shooting at ISO 6400 when necessary, and on relatively rare occasions, will bump it to ISO 12800.   With the D750/D610 cameras I shoot all raw, and anywhere above ISO 1600 will go with the Luminance Noise slider in ACR or LIightroom to 30. AT iso 1600, I set that at 20. I find Nikon raw files to have virtually no Color Noise, at least the way I shoot them.  Also, I think the latest iteration of Nikon's VR implementation, present in the 70-200/4 and also in the 24-120/4 (which has relegated my 24-70/2.8 to backup status) to be extremely good for non-moving subjects.  Everybody makes their own choices, but the only thing I feel like I loose with the f4 lenses over the f2.8 lenses is a bunch of weight on my shoulders."
Nikon,3d9nv4,kingtigerii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"The 2.8 is pretty fantastic, there's no doubt. One thing I would mention is that I don't reach for it as often as I might, just due to the weight and bulk of it in my bag."
Nikon,3d9nv4,aaron2point0,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:21 2015 UTC,I have one of the older Push-Pull 80-200 AF-D's and love it. f2.8 is fantastic and I have no AF trouble. Just make sure you keep the shutter speed above the focal length when shooing hand held and you'll have a nice sharp image :)
Nikon,3d9nv4,sky1193,2,Tue Jul 14 17:44:59 2015 UTC,I really liked the vr I f2.8 It has AF lock buttons on the lens barrel you can push down. I would have bought it but the store I buy from phased it out and had a sale on the vr II  I own the vr II 2.8 is feels nice and solid. I've shot in up to minus 27 degrees celsius. At that temp the zoom ring on my 17-55 freezes and gets hard to move. No prob from the 70-200  The only reason I would get a 80-200 2.8 is for the aperture ring so I can use it on a older film camera   VR reduction? I guess both I and II are ok. Personally I learned to keep a steady hand and look for supports whenever possible.
Nikon,3d9nv4,sky1193,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:05:02 2015 UTC,I have had the Tamron 70-200 2.8 with VC for about 6 months now. It's an incredible lens with superb IQ and some crazy VC. It has great build quality as well. I shoot a lot of sports my family members are involved in and the nikon was way out of my price range. What you get for the price difference is pretty incredible IMO. For me the savings was well worth the small tradeoffs & differences between the 2. I would easily recommend it as a lower cost alternative to the nikon/canon ones if they are not obtainable.
Nikon,3d9nv4,mrdat,2,Tue Jul 14 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"I have looked a lot into the tamron and have read mostly good things. I'm definitely considering that one but if I'm just not sure how much the VR or VC will benefit me. I usually have it off on my lenses that I currently have. No real reason for it I guess, it just seems like I don't need it often."
Nikon,3d9nv4,lepermessiah222,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I rarely find myself shooting slow enough where I need the VR, but if I do I have gone down to 1/15 @ 200mm with it and still got clean shots! But I do leave it on all the time as it helps keep the viewfinder steady and tracking subjects and framing is a little easier.  Edit: they do have a little bit older 70-200 without VR that is half the price but I haven't looked into it very much to speak to the quality of it."
Nikon,3d9nv4,Chris_PDX,2,Tue Jul 14 17:25:30 2015 UTC,I will have to check out the older 70-200. Thanks!
Nikon,3d9nv4,Blrfl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"I've heard the the VRI version vignettes on FF/35mm. I have the two ring 80-200mm 2.8D and it's sharp. I usually don't hand hold, and use a monopod when shutter speeds get below ~1/2xFL seconds. I've shot in bright sun dogs running at a dog park hand holding and it turned out fantastic."
Nikon,3d9nv4,tripler6,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"I own the VR1. It's kinda soft and vignettes a lot compared to the others. If you can deal with the slower autofocus and no VR, go with the 80-200.  For me, I needed the faster autofocus at a lower price, so I went for the VR1. Another option would have been the Tamron VC, but that was just a little out of my budget at the time and I could not find a used one."

My one battery lasts a long time. (I do have a grip for the D700 too, but don't' use it all the time.)  I'm in the mind set, for power/battery I go OEM."

Nikon,3d920b,mrdat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I haven't ran into that situation. AA batteries last a long time in the grip, so you should be good."
Nikon,3d920b,kelejen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"I went Nikon brand, because when I bought it (earlier this year), the grips were just released and there were no solid reviews on the knock-offs. Not to mention, I've have 3rd party grips on other cameras and they always felt to cheap and plasticky. At least with the Nikon I knew it would be pretty decent quality and nice and rubberized. The dials and buttons feel very solid on mine.  The grip is very necessary when using big lenses like 24-70 and 70-200. If I was only shooting primes, I would probably NOT use the grip, as a single battery seems to last a very long time.  Hope that helps."
Nikon,3d920b,kelejen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:33:13 2015 UTC,That definitely helps! I think I've decided to go with the Nikon grip. I only have one prime lens currently so I'm sure I will use it. Thanks!
Nikon,3d920b,MagFreakingNeto,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:05:08 2015 UTC,Do you recall if a rechargeable battery came with the grip when you purchased it or do you have to get one separately?
Nikon,3d920b,kelejen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:09:53 2015 UTC,"Does not some with one. I actually purchased some 3rd party batteries (SterlingTek brand) and have seen very good results from them, as in they hold a charge almost as well as official Nikon batteries, but at 1/3 the cost. I also had a Watson brand battery that came free with my D750 body and it is awful, and seems that it maxes out at like 80% of the Nikon brand and drains faster even when not in use."
Nikon,3d920b,MagFreakingNeto,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think the grip is at all necessary with the 70-200, that lens balances very well with the body without a grip."

When shooting weddings, I would be holding it for long periods of time and it really takes its toll on your hands/wrists. The grip helps immensely."
Nikon,3d8ene,Hades2k,2,Tue Jul 14 08:51:40 2015 UTC,"Have you checked out the new 80-400? I tried it on a D810 and it kinda blew my socks off with sharpness and rendering. I wouldn't mention the old version in comparison, but the new one is better than I'd have thought. If I shot at and above 200mm more it would definitely be on my list."
Nikon,3d8ene,totallyshould,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"The new one isn't an option, it is close to what a used 200-400 VR1 goes for and slower throughout the range. And, from what I have heard, it is slow to focus in low light - which is a nono for what I intend to use it. I actually had the old one up until last year and got rid of it because I wasn't happy with the results."
Nikon,3d8ene,JMDobson,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"Have you considered the Sigma 120-300 2.8 and a Tele? I was also considering the 200-400, but I've found the Sigma to be sharp and fast, plus when it gets dark you have a great 300 2.8! Sigma updated their teleconverter linup for this lens, and the 1.4 looks excellent - I try to shoot it about 1/3 stop from wide open."
Nikon,3d8ene,W00ster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:11:22 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't look at this particular lens - will read up on it for sure. The option for a 300/2.8 might be really nice but given the price tag (plus the converter) I am still leaning towards the 200-400; since that lens is so new (at least the sport version with better autofocus and iq), so I doubt there are second hand ones floating around...  Edit: Ok after reading a couple of reviews it seems to be slower at acquiring focus and not as good at tracking focus - and that were reviews concerning wildlife with sample images showing significant better lighting that I will be facing. Also sharpness seems to tae quite the hit even when not used with a teleconverter: imatest 120-300+1.4TK at 420mm-ish: 2000; the 200-400 at 400mm: ~2900; around 1/3 better is quite significant in my mind."

While not exactly pointless I don't think it's very useful, seeing as how you'd need to stop down to around f/5.6 to get good, sharp images.

The dust and specs were really stubborn. I used almost every swab but eventually got it clean. Everything works like new. After hours of patient work, I said screw it and bore down hard with really wet swabs, back and forth, then I used two almost dry swabs to get the extra solution and crap off the sensor. I let it dry for quite a while. That was about six months ago. No problems yet and the pictures are clean."

Lightroom definitely has no trouble removing them so I'll admit a professional cleaning isn't 100% necessary but some of my shots are getting more and more time consuming to do all the spot removal.
Nikon,3d4g6g,esaru,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:53:35 2015 UTC,Keep in mind you are cleaning glass - not a sensor. Yes you may leave streaks and it may take a few tries. The only you can really foul it up would be to just pour fluid in there. If you use a moderate amount of fluid and keep wiping. I use side of a fresh tissue for one direction the other side for the other direction and replace. keep going until it's clean. Now it only takes me a few minutes if I have to do it.   Pro tip. When changing lenses always hold the opening on the body straight down. Yes there could be microstatically charged particles banging around but this seems to help.

Nikon,3d2qj2,jacob_dlear,15,Mon Jul 13 01:33:10 2015 UTC,Its a $200 lens. Its terrific for being one of the cheapest lenses available; every single other lens you ever get for your camera will be far more expensive.

Nikon,3d2zd7,devianteng,2,Mon Jul 13 02:50:33 2015 UTC,"You can buy the Nikon 24-70 f4 FX on eBay for about $500. It's a good focal range for wedding photography, and has a decent aperture for the price. It's constant aperture makes it a good zoom for video.  Others have recommended the 35mm. It's a good lens for group shots and low light, but IMO, primes aren't ideal for capturing 'moments.' Primes are much better for staged shots.  You might also look for a Nikon 70-300. It's cheap at $300 or so used, its an FX lens, and its good for portrait and light duty wildlife photography. At 100+mm, it'll make great background blur, dispute being a relatively slow lens."
Nikon,3d2zd7,burning1rr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:15:54 2015 UTC,"Older, AF-D and manual focus lenses will work just fine on a D7100.

Nikon,3d2zd7,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:01:59 2015 UTC,"I'd aim for a good lens that works for what she needs now. Full frame can be more expensive than you think, as decent full frame lenses are not cheap, so it's more money to save up for.  A tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 VC will give a lot more versatility and perform better in low light than the 35-70mm (I'm pretty sure it's sharper at f/2.8). Brand new it comes in under your higher budget, but maybe you can see if someone is upgrading to FX and selling it used."
Nikon,3d2zd7,mrdat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:20:31 2015 UTC,What about the older Tamron 28-75mm 2.8? A little more wider than what she already have and but smaller.
Nikon,3d2zd7,decorama,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend the 35mm 1.4. this would be very useful for what she is shooting.   The Nikon 35mm 1.4 would be out of your budget (about $1500 new), but Sigma has one that is closer at roughly $760.    Optionally, you could go for the 35mm 1.8 - well within your budget at about $170 but - it's a DX.   Further - you could seek out a used lens to get the 1.4 closer to your budget. Good luck!"
Nikon,3d2zd7,eled_,3,Mon Jul 13 03:58:35 2015 UTC,The 35mm 1.8 may be worth picking up considering its price. I may do that if it will do what she wants.

Nikon,3d2zd7,Aetherei,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:40:35 2015 UTC,"Photography is a very personal thing.  Unless she has specifically told you ""I wish I had a new 70-200 f/2.8 VR II lens"" or something, I wouldn't just go and buy one because then it may not be exactly what she wanted or needed but she knows you spent money so she'll have to act like she loves it.   Just get her a $300 gift card to BH, Adorama, or Amazon and let her pick out what she wants.   Having said that, she will probably use a normal f/2.8 zoom like the sigma you listed more than anything so it's not a bad choice at all if she plans on staying with cropped sensored cameras."
Nikon,3d21ml,JCastro96,2,Sun Jul 12 22:02:03 2015 UTC,Hmm seems weird. Might just be a quirk with the beta. I have a MBP and I always just plug the card into the reader and use finder to move the photos to where I need them to be.
Nikon,3d21ml,sky1193,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:29:09 2015 UTC,"Also, probably not a good idea to install a beta OS on the computer on which you're going to be using critically.

Nikon,3cvhe5,tanxh,9,Sat Jul 11 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"It used to take good pictures... and still does. Resolution isn't such a big deal, I think the main weakness is the low light capability. Get a decent tripod, use fast lenses, control the light- those are three ways to make the most of it. It'll still whomp a cell phone camera on its own."
Nikon,3cvhe5,totallyshould,5,Sat Jul 11 04:16:38 2015 UTC,I still rock mine. You can get some great pictures with primes.
Nikon,3cvhe5,redditjackson,6,Sat Jul 11 03:32:47 2015 UTC,Check out the DPReview on it. For $250 bucks I'd say do it. It will be completely adequate for the kinds of photography you've mentioned.  On the other hand you can pick up a refurbished D3200 for ~$300 off on Amazon.  The key here is understand what you need from your camera. The D90 will give you more control and autofocus with Nikon's older AF and AF-D lenses. Whereas with the D3200 you're limited to AF-S lenses and simpler controls. But you're getting a 24 MP sensor with ISO 6400 on the D3200; in comparison the D90 can only offer ~12 MP and ISO 3200. Both are a good choice. The question you need to answer is do you want better controls and support for older lenses or do you want better high ISO performance and double the pixel density?  I should also mention the D3200 is a physically smaller camera than the D90 if that means anything to you.  Best of luck!
Nikon,3cvhe5,NVIDIAMAN,3,Sat Jul 11 03:35:40 2015 UTC,"I've used both extensively, I prefer the D90. I think it's mostly due to the 2 wheels - I know it's a small thing, but it's such a pain using cameras that don't have it once you get used to it. The D90 just has such a good, not dinky toy feel to it."
Nikon,3cvhe5,willtobe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:11:48 2015 UTC,This is truth
Nikon,3cvhe5,OM3N1R,3,Sat Jul 11 22:01:37 2015 UTC,I still have my D90 and I can't find a serious reason to upgrade to any of its successors (D7100/D7200). I highly recommend it.  It's a great great great camera. And considering you wouldn't be using it for semi-pro or pro stuff I think it'd be a good fit for you.   250 is certainly a good deal for it but that being said you might be able to get it for less than 250. Just considering the market for D90s isn't that big.
Nikon,3cvhe5,brightsizedlife,3,Sat Jul 11 05:16:10 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty solid camera. Yet's it's older and there will be signs of age (not as good for hand held work in low light as a camera that was released in the last year or two) but if you shoot either in decent light or use a tripod, it will still take amazing photos (and I'd argue that if you're shooting stationary objects at night, using a D90 with a tripod will give you better results than a D750 without a tripod).  Two of the reasons why I consider it to be very good may not hold as much weight for other users. First is the camera has an internal focus motor, so it can autofocus with older AF-D lenses (newer low end cameras like the D3200 and D5500 can only autofocus with AF-S lenses which have their own AF motor and cost more and are not as common on the used market)... this can save you some money by letting you get nice lenses at a lower cost. The other is controls. The D90 has a more advanced control layout... this makes it easier to change settings quickly, once you know how the camera is laid out, but you have to understand the camera and basics of photography a little better because while the extra controls makes it easier to change things quickly, it also makes it more complex. An entry level camera like a D3200 is a little more centered around the idea of point-and-shoot. The D3200 has full manual controls, but the camera makes it easier to work in manual mode and does a better job of explaining what each setting is by making you change many settings by going through menus (which give you more information about what a setting does, but makes things slower to change).  Basically if you either know a lot about photography or are the kind of person who would learn a lot and be very focused on wanting to change the settings to exactly what you want, the D90 is a great option. If you're not going to geek out as much and just want a ""push the button, we'll do the rest"" something like the D3200 might be a better option."
Nikon,3cvhe5,ApatheticAbsurdist,3,Sat Jul 11 07:07:31 2015 UTC,"Still use mine. It's over 100k now.  Still works great. Low light is good, in my opinion. It's not anywhere near my D600 or D750 (those are for work), but for everyday use, love my D90.   250 is a great deal. I say, go for it."
Nikon,3cvhe5,willtobe,3,Sat Jul 11 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"Buy it. Its a great camera. I believe it will go down in camera history as one of the classics like the Pentax K1000 or Nikon F's of the film world.  I upgraded to a D7100, but the benefits over the D90 are minimal so far.  And 50 shutter actuations? You've basically got a brand new camera there!"
Nikon,3cvhe5,decorama,3,Sat Jul 11 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"I consider the D90 to be the transition point from ""old"" DSLR's and ""modern"" DSLR's. At the time it was such a solid step up from its predecessor; it's like Nikon skipped a whole generation in one go."

However the d90 is a prosumer camera, so it has a lot more control. Also the 50mmf/1.8 AFS is ~200. The AF/AFD is 50/100. You save a ton on lenses.  GOOD GLASS TRUMPS A GOOD BODY. BUY GOOD GLASS."
Nikon,3cvhe5,dingus182,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:59:14 2015 UTC,"I just bought a D3300.  I bought an extra lens Nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6.  I'm still learning.  But, I did own a D90 for its digital ability [edit: and mechanical zoom] to use the older lens.  Lens are worth their weight."
Nikon,3cvhe5,jgilbs,2,Sat Jul 11 17:05:16 2015 UTC,"Still rocking my D90 from 2008 alongside my newer D600.  The D90 never skips a beat, and allows you to utilize AF-D lenses, which lower bodies cannot.  Totally worth it, especially if its in good shape."
Nikon,3cvhe5,blitzangel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"People keep talking about the two wheels as opposed to one.  However, while having more control is indeed a big plus, I think an even bigger advantage of the d90 over something like the d3xxx/d5xxx cameras is its in-body focus motor, which opens a much wider range of [cheaper] lenses to choose from."
Nikon,3cvhe5,siege72a,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"$250 for the body, or $250 with lens? A decent lens will cost several hundred dollars more. (I don't know if you have a budget, but it's a consideration)  I won't reiterate what others have said. I have one, it's a powerful camera to learn photography with. If you don't crop too much, you can make excellent 11x14inch prints.   Just remember to either shoot RAW or JPEG+RAW. You can get a lot more out of d90 image using RAW."
Nikon,3cvhe5,wiseguy13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"If you're just after a camera for architecture, any wide-angle camera will do, you might not need and SLR. If you do/want, D90 is a great body with the option of taking all the old lenses which are cheaper than getting new ones. D90 was still being made until recently, that's how good it is, and if low light isn't an issue the no need to consider better sensors and processors.   Personally I'd get a D90 over say a D3200 simply because it's more compatible with the D/E Lenses, saving money in the long run. If you never plan on changing your lens.... buy a Sony Bridge Camera."
Nikon,3cvhe5,coogie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:50:33 2015 UTC,"I owned a D90, I loved my D90, but I think the D90 is a bit long in the tooth considering you can get a D7000 for just a little more. The shutter actuations are kind of meaningless unless it's more than 40k.  I think the D90 is tested for 100k.  $250 WITH a lens is about what the going rate should be."
Nikon,3cvhe5,geekygeekz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:32:52 2015 UTC,"D90 is fine. Again, the main difference between the older cameras and newer cameras is low light performance. As you're shooting architecture, a sturdy tripod and longer exposure time and you'll be fine with low light. $250 with less than 50 actuations is a great deal, I think you should get it.  For general shots like walk around photography, a small speedlight like the SB-400 would be a great help in low light."
Nikon,3cvhe5,ja647,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"$250? pretty good. Still taking great pictures. If they metered, I'd have one for my older lenses. Crap, might buy one if I can find it for that money and sunny f/16."
Nikon,3cvhe5,Sardonnicus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:48:41 2015 UTC,The D90 is a great entry into Nikon DSLR's.  I had one for several years and took some great shots with it.  It's easy to use like a D3300 but has the interface and button layout of the more expensive nikon cameras.  I have a D810 and the button layout and menu options are fantastic.  My father has a D3300 and I can't figure out where any of the adjustments are on his camera.  So menu accessibility can be a big benefit.
Nikon,3cvhe5,eled_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"Having used both layouts (as well as the D7xxx/D6xx/D750 one), it's a bit of an overstatement.  Yes, the D3k/D5k layout is more cumbersome if you want control, and the few additional buttons of the other layouts can help a great deal in that regard. But menus are designed well-enough that with little practice you can swap between them in a handful of seconds. I honestly can't think of a feature that is present on both types of cameras (let's say, the D810 and D3300) that is not either:   directly accessible directly accessible with a modifier button (ISO, Exposure compensation, Aperture in M/P modes, Flash compensation) accessible in the quick-access menu (the bottom-bar of the ""main"" screen, not the cumbersome deep menus ; includes AF/MF modes, AF area modes, Metering modes, File types/weight, WB) accessible via a menu opened by a dedicated button (like the S/Ch/Cl/Remote/etc switch)   on the D3300."

Nikon,3cvccm,totallyshould,3,Sat Jul 11 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"Nikon F3:       The Nikon F3 was Nikon's third professional single-lens reflex camera body, preceded by the F and F2. Introduced in 1980, it had manual and semi-automatic exposure control whereby the camera would select the correct shutter speed (aperture priority automation). The Nikon F3 series cameras had the most model variations of any Nikon F camera. It was also the first of numerous Nikon F-series cameras to be styled by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro,  and to include a red stripe on the handgrip – a feature that would later become (with variants of stripes and various other shapes) a signature feature of many Nikon cameras.

Nikon,3cqlqi,chiRal123,6,Fri Jul 10 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"I would take a look at the kit with the D750 and the Nikon 24-120mm f/4. It is a fine lens and quite versatile in it's zoom range. At full price ($1,300) it might not be the best choice (and that's where most complaints come in) but at $700 over the price of the body only, it becomes a pretty good deal, coming in even cheaper than the Sigma 24-105mm f/4.  The biggest complaint with the lens is it has a bit more distortion than the 24-70 f/2.8, but that distortion is very easily fixed with a single click in programs like Lightroom with lens corrections.  People talk up 24-70mm f/2.8 lenses but I find it really depends on the user. Wedding and event photographers need the compromise of relatively fast aperture and a small amount of zoom. For that kind of work and other types that need that kind of compromise, it is very useful. But I find for many others, the zoom range is not enough. I'd also point out that you have a 50mm f/1.4 if you need wide aperture, so depending on how you shoot, the f/2.8 might be a compromise you don't need."
Nikon,3cqlqi,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Fri Jul 10 00:40:21 2015 UTC,I'd suggest checking out the Tamron SP 24-70mm F/2.8 Di VC USD as an alternative to the Nikon.

If it's the latter then you might need to modify your camera to do an IR modification on your sensor, with the downside of having all photos taken by that camera in IR. I believe using live view with a modified sensor also lets you see IR through the back screen.  If you only intend to focus with IR and take normal light photos, then I'd think you're out of luck.  I'll let other users chime in on IR, not many people actually use it for normal photography purposes"

Nikon,3cqqxv,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Fri Jul 10 19:18:16 2015 UTC,Have you tried on-axis lighting? The angle of light will effect the reflections. The glossy surface of the water will directly reflect on-axis lighting while while lambertian dry surface will diffuse such reflections

I really don't see near IR helping here... the difference in opacity of water from the visible spectrum to 1000nm (which is around the upper end of the sensitivity of the silicon sensors in Nikon cameras, even after removing the hot mirror) is not that noticeable. You'd need to aim for 5000nm or longer and I don't even think InGaAs based sensors are sensitive there.  Goniometry is probably a better approach than filtering on spectrum."

Nikon,3cqp6g,TheElvenJedi,2,Fri Jul 10 00:28:13 2015 UTC,"There is only one tele lens for Nikon 1 cameras.  Though, you could also get the FT-1 mount adapter and use any Nikkor tele lens with the 2.7 crop of Nikon 1 cameras, meaning a cheap 55-200 VR would give you an effective focal lenght of 150-540mm, which is just ridiculous, for only 500 bucks.  It all depends on how much you wanna use the tele. If you'll use it regularly, it may be worth spending 1000 bucks on it. If you only use it every once in a while, the cheaper option with the adapter and the DX lens may be the better way to go.  The adapter could also be the better option if you plan on switching to Nikon DSLRs. Why spending money on those expensive Nikkor 1 lenses if you'll have to replace them in the future anyway. ;)"
Nikon,3cqp6g,eppic123,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:13:57 2015 UTC,I will have to explore this option for sure. Thank you for the suggestion.

So, if you don't have already, you should definitely consider getting a monopod. It doesn't have to be the most expensive one (especially since your cam is not that heavy) but it also shouldn't be a cheapo one. A cheap(er) Manfrotto will most likely do the trick for you."

One gotcha: The FT1 limits your autofocus options. You'll be stuck with single point autofocus, though a recent update added continuous single point. This can be a bit of an issue if you want to shoot moving subjects, but it's absolutely fine for slow moving objects and bird-on-branch shots."
Nikon,3cno7v,planetb00m,4,Thu Jul 9 09:01:16 2015 UTC,"As a not-at-all-pro-strobist I have a few answers. First with both speedlights you'll need triggers unless you only work in slave mode (ie. your camera flash triggers the slave speedlight). A friend of mine is using Yongnuos speedlight for weddings (photobooth + late party) and is very happy with them. I use a Triopo speedlight (even less expensive) and as far as I'm concerned it's enough. Sooo my finale thought would be: to begin with speedlights go with the very capable and less expensive Yongnuo. Worst case scenario: you're not happy with it in the long run, you go Nikon SB-XXX and keep the Yongnuo as a backup flash and/or second light for a small studio."
Nikon,3cno7v,Rom8Q,2,Thu Jul 9 09:46:40 2015 UTC,I had question on this as well. Is there any reason not to use commander mode with the pop up flash to trigger my yongnuo speedlites? I've been using this method for the past few months as I am new to flash photography and see no issues. How do I benefit from using wireless triggers?
Nikon,3cno7v,SausageLegs,3,Thu Jul 9 10:55:35 2015 UTC,"Not really it works pretty well. Just a few scenarii might have issues:   If there is something in the way between your camera and your speedlight If your speedlight is pretty far from your camera (more than 15m) In bright day light, miscommunication might occur If your subject is pretty close, the direct flash can be seen, which you were trying to avoid with your speedlight off the camera (not sure about this one, but some speedlight might not be TTL compatible in slave mode)   Also a benefit is that some triggers allow you to ajust settings of the speedlight from distance in manual mode (if your camera dosen't allow it, like a lot of Nikon bodies) which is verrrrry appreciable when the flash is stuck in a softbox for example.  EDIT: Formatting"
Nikon,3cno7v,Rom8Q,3,Thu Jul 9 12:10:27 2015 UTC,"another time triggering optically could be an issue is if there is a reflective surface behind your subject, like glass or a mirror"

Nikon,3cno7v,SPOOFE,2,Thu Jul 9 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"yikes, I was more thinking your on camera flash will come right back at you in the reflection but yours is a good point too"
Nikon,3cno7v,scotttech1,3,Thu Jul 9 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"Yongnuo is very cool if you plan on buying multiple flashes and triggers. Because everything is well integrated and works perfectly together. Source : I'm the friend who use Yongnuos for weddings and stuff.  I have some cases of misfire from time to time but I can live with that.  With a SB-9xx you could :   Better construction quality Slightly higher reliability. Maybe ? Good interface. Yongnuos menus navigation is not that easy. More consistent power output. On my YN568 it may vary a bit under intensive use. Probably better recycling time.   And that's about it I think.  EDIT : Since Nikon decided to bury the flash controls deep down in the settings, the radio trigger/controller is more than welcome."
Nikon,3cno7v,kouignamann_kingdom,5,Thu Jul 9 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"the main difference is Nikon flashes are very good with great warranty but pricey, the Yungnuo are Chinese made copies that are very good copies and they are much less expensive.  The good thing about nikon and part of the reason they cost more is nikon is well known and has a large network of repair and warrenty service centers so if there is a problem you are assured it will be fixed.  Yungnuo, if it breaks or stops working you buy a new one, but at least its cheap :)"

Nikon,3cno7v,scotttech1,2,Thu Jul 9 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"1) Not sure the 568EX TTL can act as a commander. So that might be a difference.  2) There is nothing wrong with wireless triggers. This way, you aren't reliant on optical triggering from your popup flash."

Nikon,3cjbef,jahka,2,Wed Jul 8 21:20:30 2015 UTC,I wouldn't try that. You know there is a 20 min limit on filming? It is to protect the sensor from overheating.
Nikon,3cjbef,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Wed Jul 8 11:35:41 2015 UTC,"The reason may not be overheating... the sensor has a pretty good heatsink on it and people have hacked it to do longer.  Other issues at play are for storage, I think the memory cards us the FAT file system which has a 4GB max file size, and longer videos would push that size.  The other that gets mentioned but can be a bit murky is EU tax laws. The EU imposes a 12.5% import tax on camcorders and video recorders. However a still camera is classified as an information device which has a much lower import tax. On possible line to draw between a recorder and a still camera is a 30 minute limit on recording. If limiting recording to 20 minutes helps argue that the camera is a still camera and not really made for video and that helps keep the import taxes down, it keeps the price to the consumer lower and sells more units."
Nikon,3cjbef,jahka,3,Wed Jul 8 16:18:44 2015 UTC,You are probably correct. I just googled the issue. I just got the overheating excuse when I asked a dude about it a couple of years ago.

Nikon,3cjbef,alexthecheese,0,Wed Jul 8 23:52:04 2015 UTC,The issue is to do with tax reasons isn't it? So it's not marked as a video camera and hits a higher tax bracket.
Nikon,3cjbef,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:01:21 2015 UTC,"The D7000 does not have a ""clean HDMI out"" option available. There may be software hacks that get around this, but that is a proceed at your own risk area that I'd rather not go into. Higher end ($2,000+ cameras do have ways of getting clean HDMI out)  For your camera, you can get HDMI out but it's going to have information on the image (aperture settings, etc.). If you can live with that extra stuff on your video you could then record that. To do this your computer also will need a video capture card (or USB HDMI recording device... elgato makes some nice ones) that can record from HDMI.   Basically you're probably better off getting a webcam that is designed to do what you want to do, as trying to get streaming video off of the D7000 can be like trying to jam this square peg in a round hole."

Nikon,3cdp4j,gb0n,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:48:36 2015 UTC,No problem. I didn't realize until today that the piece is a molded part of the door. If 3D printing doesn't help I can use Sugru to make a mold of the piece.
Nikon,3cdp4j,DevilsHandyman,2,Tue Jul 7 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"I noticed that it was an integral part of the door when I was looking at my F100.  Given this, I wonder whether one could just buy a parts camera and scavenge an entire door (or perhaps simply buy an F100 door).  Edit: I did see an F100 door on eBay for less than $10."
Nikon,3cdp4j,gb0n,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:36:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately replacing it involves cutting the broken latch off and fixing the new one somehow. So far my plan is to glue it and possibly add a couple of plastic rivets for strength.  I've never used sugru before, is it useful only for moulding or does it have sufficient strength to actually make a replacement part?"
Nikon,3cdp4j,ja647,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:46:25 2015 UTC,It cures to a stiff rubber like substance. But it would make for a good mold if you wanted to create from a mold rather than 3D print.  I would think if you clean away enough of the old latch down past the door part that you could get a firm attachment of your new part with some epoxy.
Nikon,3cdp4j,ja647,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:16:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed, thats what I'll try out first!"

Nikon,3ccm4q,Elderain,3,Mon Jul 6 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've got one. I haven't used it with lightning yet (hasn't been any) but it's a nice bit of kit.   What do you want to know?"
Nikon,3ccm4q,Styxthedog,2,Mon Jul 6 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"Just wondering how useful it actually is, and how well it works. Assuming it does the things it says it does well, I would use all the functions. Primary is Lightning, but I want to do some real high speed stuff too (things breaking, waterdrops, etc..). Some I would trigger via laser (sounds like a neat function, when the drop passes the laser, take a picture) and sound (things popping, breaking, etc.).  What's your take on it? run into any issues?"
Nikon,3ccm4q,Styxthedog,2,Tue Jul 7 00:03:02 2015 UTC,The sound and laser settings work well. You just put the camera in manual focus mode and it fires without a hitch when triggered. You control the settings via a really well designed iOS / Android app and the product itself is very well made.  There have been a few lighting shots shared on nero trigger (the manufacturers) Facebook page so I expect that feature to work fine also.
Nikon,3ccm4q,snapper1971,2,Tue Jul 7 13:26:58 2015 UTC,Oh great. Another conversation with the wife about why I have purchased more equipment...

Nikon,3ccm4q,RavenPanther,2,Mon Jul 13 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"I would worry it might have problems with lighting. Maybe if your camera has an electronic 1st curtain shutter (not all do). But the lag of a DSLR from the time of when you press the shutter to when the shutter opens is not insignificant in the scale of a lightning strike so it might miss a lot of shots.  If you want to catch lighting with your DSLR the cheaper way to do it is as follows:   Set the camera on a tripod Point the camera towards where the storm seems to be, hopefully frame it up so that the landscape makes a halfway decent composition. Turn off long exposure noise reduction in your menus. If you know how to deal with RAW files, it wouldn't hurt to shoot in RAW. If not shoot in JPG and set your white balance for daylight or tungsten (avoid shade setting unless you want very very yellow clouds) Set your ISO to 100 (or the camera's native ISO) Stop your aperture down a bit (f/8-11) Find a shutter speed that will slightly underexpose your scene. (If the clouds are dark, as most lighting storms are, you might be able to pull off something in the ballpark of 10 second exposure) Keep taking photos. If you have a cable release, plug it in, set the camera to continuous shooting and lock down the button on the cable release. If you see lighting go off while a picture is being taken, review the shot to see how it looks and if you need to tweak your exposure or white balance, do so. Repeat."
Nikon,3ccm4q,RavenPanther,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:34:05 2015 UTC,I do this already. I just figured something more automatic would be nice.
Nikon,3c9jef,SeBJJ,3,Mon Jul 6 03:51:35 2015 UTC,"They're all good. Since it's your first, I would recommend the 3300. It will give you the basics without overwhelming you. Good luck!"
Nikon,3c9jef,decorama,3,Mon Jul 6 04:05:18 2015 UTC,"I got a new d3300 with the two kit lenses, really loved having a wide and a Tele to use right off the bat. And on a crop, the better lens is the 35mm prime and I also picked that one up new for $200 and now I have all the lenses I could need."

Nikon,3c9jef,guiscard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:37:06 2015 UTC,"So if I do end up going this route, what glass would you recommend?"
Nikon,3c9jef,OM3N1R,3,Mon Jul 6 17:37:16 2015 UTC,35mm f1.8 as it is close to 50mm on a dx camera. The 50 will be a 75mm and you will find it limiting
Nikon,3c9jef,guiscard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on what sort of stuff you want to shoot. But the 5200 has a great sensor, and the lenses can last you through multiple cameras."
Nikon,3c9jef,timdesuyo,4,Wed Jul 8 13:04:36 2015 UTC,"Go for a 7000 with the 35mm f/1.8 DX lens. For sure. This post is a little old and out of date, but it's the right idea."
Nikon,3c9jef,fucking_chocolate,-7,Mon Jul 6 04:28:09 2015 UTC,"the D7000 is quite old already. I wouldn't recommend buying it. You can live without the pro features of the D7000 at the beginning. I think you'd benefit more in getting a D5200/5300 which are newer models with better sensors and are probably less expensive.  Edit: the D5000 series are basically the same as the D7000 series with the same sensors etc. The difference is handling: they are lighter, smaller and ""less professional"" (no secondary wheel and display, no buttons for many setting: you have to use the interface instead...).  Edit 2: I agree that there are some features missing on the 5000 series, but nothign you can't live without -  especially as a beginner. My first DSLR was a D5100 over a D7000 and I'd never regret it."
Nikon,3c9jef,geekygeekz,4,Mon Jul 6 08:48:09 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. The sensors and image quality in the newer cameras might be better, but it's indiscernible from the D7000. D7000 is a prosumer camera that will allow you to grow and progress more as a photographer. The two control dials is a huge plus and let's you get shots in quickly that you otherwise might have missed because you were digging through the menu to change a setting. Faster autofocus and weather dealing on the D7k will also let you get shots that you might not have gotten with the D5300 because the action was too fast or the weather was not optimal.   Pentax is also a good choice. Cheap and has good features for the value. If you go through my comment history, you can read objectively why it is. It's the big long paragraphs, you won't miss it."
Nikon,3c9jef,OM3N1R,2,Mon Jul 6 09:30:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. I could never live without 2 control dials now. I can operate the camera in complete darkness, which is very important for my area of shooting"
Nikon,3c9jef,timdesuyo,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:46:40 2015 UTC,The problem with Pentax is that you can't grow with it. Growing as a photographer would involve selling off all your Pentax gear and moving up to the big-boy cameras.
Nikon,3c9jef,geekygeekz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"What makes you say that? Is there a reason that you can't grow with it? If your reasoning is that it doesn't offer a full frame, they're coming out with one here very soon. You wouldn't have to sell everything, it'd still make for a great backup camera if you ever do professional photography."
Nikon,3c9jef,timdesuyo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"The glass doesn't stack up, and neither do the sensors. They made some killer medium format cameras back in the day, but they don't have anything in the way of glass that I would shoot with. Sony did a good job of covering for that failing by partnering closely with Zeiss, and making it super easy to strap on old rangefinder glass onto their a7 bodies. But Pentax is still high and dry."
Nikon,3c9jef,geekygeekz,2,Mon Jul 6 18:22:47 2015 UTC,"Sony makes sensors for Pentax, the same ones they use in Nikons. The new Pentax FF that is going to be coming out is going to use the same 42mp Sony A7rii sensor. I have a K5 and my friend has a D7000. They were both released in 2010 within a month of each other, using near identical Sony sensors. I can get better low light performance with higher ISOs than she can, with usable images all the way up to 25,600 with post processing.   Pentax makes some amazing lenses, their limited primes are stunning. They even have the industry standard zooms like the 70-200 f/2.8 and the 24-70 f/2.8 that are all very good. Their limited primes are especially great like the 31m, 43mm and the 77mm lenses."
Nikon,3c9jef,timdesuyo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:02:44 2015 UTC,Maybe they will come around the corner then with the sensors. I'm still not in love with their glass.

Nikon,3c9jef,timdesuyo,3,Mon Jul 6 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"There are two key features that you can't live without - the second wheel, and the tab that allows you to meter with Ai lenses. I can't in good conscience recommend any camera that doesn't have them. I'd take a D90 before a D5x00."
Nikon,3c9jef,fucking_chocolate,0,Mon Jul 6 09:22:46 2015 UTC,You can very well live without them - especially beginners might prefer the interface.
Nikon,3c9jef,timdesuyo,2,Mon Jul 6 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"As a guy who teaches photography to beginners - I would argue that they are especially necessary for beginners. It's the useless bells and whistles that they pack into the low-end cameras that are unnecessary. That's why you never see those gimmicks in the high-end cameras. The true tragedy is that there isn't something like a digital FM2 for beginners - no auto anything, easy minimalist interface, works with everything since the Ai lenses."
Nikon,3c9jef,bozo2014,2,Mon Jul 6 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"For my very first DSLR I got the D3100, but that was several years ago. Now I have the D7000 and regretted not having that as my first. It's an awesome camera and a great experience to start out with. The only reason I got the D3100 was because I didn't know if I was going to really like photography, but 5 or 6 good lenses and a new camera body later I obviously did. It's definitely a risk you're going to have to take if you're not sure. Though, if you know you like photography, go with the D7000 refurb and a cheap f/1.8. You will fall in love with the combo when you see the first shot."
Nikon,3c9jef,old_snake,2,Mon Jul 6 10:50:33 2015 UTC,"I just got a refurbished 5300, 18-55 and 55-200 for $570 then grabbed a used 35mm 1.8 prime from Craigslist for $120. I understand what these guys are saying about going with a used D7000 instead but I liked how light the 5300 was and since I was also seriously considering the A6000, the 5300 turned out to be a perfect sweet spot. Not too much. Great photos. Compact and light. I am very pleased with my purchase. Take it with me everywhere."
Nikon,3c9jef,carnotredditor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:48:27 2015 UTC,Had you considered the D5500 at all? Right now I'm choosing between that and the D5300. And I'm leaning toward the 5300..   Also can you link me to the deal that you got on the D5300?
Nikon,3c9jef,jgreene128,2,Fri Jul 10 00:43:11 2015 UTC,Anything under the 7000 series will limit your options on lenses a bit because of the lack of internal focus motor in the 3 and 5000s. If you could save alittle more I would say go for a 7100
Nikon,3c9jef,UnmixedGametes,2,Mon Jul 6 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"Beg steal or borrow a D7100.  D7000 focus issues sufficiently serious and common to make me doubt any already on ""used"" sites. (If you do buy one, get a 10 day returns warranty and do every focus and depth of field test you can quickly')"
Nikon,3c9jef,wagwanimal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"I am similar to you, new to DSLR's and after doing some research I picked the d5200 over the 5300 because I personally didn't need the wifi/gps, and overall the 53 isn't thaaat much of an upgrade at all so i saved money (unless you can get the 53 for same price somehow the 5200 does fine for me). I don't regret my 5200, bring it everywhere I go :)"
Nikon,3c9jef,ooburai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:05:35 2015 UTC,"If you can find a good deal, the D7000 is going to be the toughest and most fun to use of all of those cameras.  The manufacturing quality is a head above any of the others you listed.  In the end it's a matter of personal preference, but I have a few Nikon bodies and I can tell you that I would use my old D7000 before my newer D3300 any day.  The 3300 arguably takes better photos in terms of pure image quality, but unless you're going to use it in a highly automatic mode it can be frustrating to set anything other than aperture since you'll need futz with menus whereas the D7000 can be completely controlled from knobs and buttons on the body without entering any of the software configuration menus.  I'll also second that the 35mm f/1.8 is a must-have lens for any Nikon DX kit.  I have several much more expensive lenses but none of them spend as much time on any of my cameras as this one does.  It's practical, sturdy enough, light, and excellent optically."
Nikon,3c9jef,c312eal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:50:11 2015 UTC,Go with the D7000 as the 7000 series and any Nikon full frame can use the older AI and AIS lens. You can get some really good glass for a cheap price and they will function perfectly fine. My friend has a D750 and loves to use his 55mm f2.8 micro AIS as it gives a really contrasty picture. The 5000 and 3000 series will mount the AI and AIS lens but the camera will not meter these lens.
Nikon,3c9jef,This_Is_The_End,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:01:22 2015 UTC,"I would consider what do you want with you DSLR and buying according to your needs.   For example I take mostly pictures of landscapes and Aurora Borealis, which made me choose a Nikon 14mm-24mm/2.8 and a FX camera, because I'm able to raise the exposure for the shadows in Lightroom without getting artefacts or noise.   DX cameras are fine too, but you should at least estimate what are your motives for pictures."
Nikon,3c9jef,evertjm,3,Mon Jul 6 08:08:35 2015 UTC,that lens alone is triple his budget
Nikon,3c9jef,This_Is_The_End,2,Mon Jul 6 08:51:39 2015 UTC,This was an example. The people should ask for lenses suitable for their purpose not the other way around. An alternative would be btw. the Samyang 14mm/2.8
Nikon,3c9jef,timdesuyo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:22:53 2015 UTC,"Right, but it was the example of using a camera and lens that fits his needs. Those would be terrible choices if he were going birding."

Nikon,3c9jef,timdesuyo,2,Mon Jul 6 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"It works on DX, but yeah, it's more of a second lens - start buying the FX primes so that when you eventually make the jump up to FX, you will be ready."

Nikon,3c9jef,fucking_chocolate,2,Mon Jul 6 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"50mm (nifty-fifty) is seen by many as the perfect focal lenght. However this was before DSLR when most cameras had a 35mm film. Today's DX sensors are smaller - resulting in a ""longer"" focal lenght. This is called the crop factor. As FX (full-frame) cameras have a sensor the same size as the 35mm film cameras used to have no crop factor applies.  Basically: The 50mm on the smaller DX sensor will result in an image similar to a ~75mm on an FX sensor. The 35mm lens on a DX however is pretty much the same as a 50mm on FX would be. Of course you can still use the 50mm on DX but it'll be too narrow for many situations.   Let me know if anything's not clear!"

Its is especially a big issue when using fast glass with wide apertures.  I tried tuning each lens with the D7000's focus adjustment and it never solved the issue.

Nikon,3c8mky,Moice,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:55:45 2015 UTC,"I shot a pair of F2 bodies nearly exclusively for about seven years. in my opinion they're the best built film SLR bodies ever made.  A lot of these were used by professionals, and as a (then) member of the working press, by the time I let mine go, they looked about 1000 times more beat than this one does, but they were functionally perfect.  However, you're looking at an old camera body. Lubricants dry up over time. Focal plane shutters go out of calibration over time, especially when the camera has been sitting unused. If the battery remained in the camera all of this time there's a high possibility that there's internal corrosion. On one of mine, at one point there was a tiny dot of corrosion apparent in the battery compartment that was about the size of a pinhead. When the local camera repair man pulled the bottom plate off, the entire bottom of the camera was nearly solid corrosion.  The lens is pretty good considering the vintage, although the aperture  and anything else that moves could potentially be sluggish due to the lubricants having dried up there too.  The lens will have limited resale value regardless of condition since it's non an AI or AI-S lens, although there are still some people performing conversions. Obviously, you wouldn't need to have ti converted for use on that F2.  Honestly, unless I was looking for a conversation piece or interior decor, I wouldn't roll the dice for more than $100 USD for this particular outfit, since there are plenty of these available for not a ton of money from trusted sources, or at least sources with a money back guarantee."

Nikon,3c89ds,electromage,8,Sun Jul 5 21:38:32 2015 UTC,We need more context. If OP is in the US (or I assume most civilized countries) and taking photos of cars on the street he doesn't need to convince anyone of anything... If the owner of the car wants to make a fuss just ignore them. They should keep it in their garage if they don't want it photographed.

I don't understand why an owner of one wouldn't want a photo taken of them.   Although that's kind of beside the point. I would just delete the photo and get over it, to be polite and to not make a scene. I'd love it if someone liked my car enough to photograph it, personally.

Nikon,3c6545,jgreene128,9,Sun Jul 5 04:53:36 2015 UTC,Well you won't be taking advantage of the entire frame if you're going to just use DX lenses. The 50mm 1.8 is a fairly inexpensive lens and can produce very sharp photos on your FX frame.
Nikon,3c6545,CasualFridayNight,3,Sun Jul 5 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"Just to add,  if you get the older d lens,  it will only cost you around 100 dollars new,  or less second hand.  A drop in the ocean compared to the body price."
Nikon,3c6545,doesnotlikecricket,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:12:29 2015 UTC,I am always on the hunt for second hand lens so it won't be long until I start my fx lens collection. I do plan on getting at least one with the new body I'm just trying to find the right one. It seems like the 50mm is the consensus on which I should purchase!
Nikon,3c6545,totallyshould,3,Sun Jul 5 13:16:22 2015 UTC,"Because it's so cheap, the quality is awesome for the price, and it's a fairly versatile focal length. There are other FX recommendations, but the usual question is what you like to shoot, and what your budget is.  Rumor has it that there will be a new and better DX body coming soon, since they just released a 16-85 f/2.8-4 DX lens that seems suspiciously like it could fit in with something like a D400. If you can hang on a bit and aren't sure if you will want to atomic the cost of all new FX glass yet, that could be interesting."
Nikon,3c6545,Aaberg123,4,Sun Jul 5 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"You're not gaining anything of real value by using crop lenses on an FX body.  As others have suggested, get a 50 f/1,8G if you abolutely must have a full frame camera."

Nikon,3c6545,rideThe,2,Sun Jul 5 13:19:09 2015 UTC,A D750 with only DX lenses is about the same as your D5100 in terms of image quality but with less resolution. It's at best a sideways step. You will suffer the loss of ~$2000 for no real improvement in image quality.   The D750 does have many other excellent features but the D7200 has most of them too and does them almost or just as well.  Unless the flip screen and slightly better AF performance are worth an extra ~$1000 to you right now and you are planning to upgrade your lenses in the very near future then don't waste your money on the D750. And I say this as someone who looooooooooves the D750.
Nikon,3c6545,c312eal,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:29:58 2015 UTC,I do plan on upgrading my lenses in the near future. Like I said in another response. I'm a young photographer in college and I have the opportunity to upgrade my body I just don't have the funds to go out and get the holy trinity at this point. My dx lenses will be short lived on the 750
Nikon,3c6545,rideThe,5,Sun Jul 5 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"You already have an excellent camera and your money would probably be better spent upgrading lenses or acquiring lenses that will allow you to do things you can't now or on building out the rest of your system, like support or lighting & modifiers or other accessories. People put a lot of importance in bodies but often for the wrong reasons - yes, the D750, with appropriate lenses, will be ""better"" than a D5100 in image quality but it's not the earth shattering difference people make it out to be or imagine it's going to be. If your photography depends on squeezing the most out of those few last photons then a new camera may be worth it but most of the time it's a lot of money for only marginal improvement.   I get asked all the time for photos from our college for various things and our library includes photos taken with a number of various DSLRs including a huge number from my old D40 mixed in with our current D750 as well as the D700, D800, D3, D2Xs of the photography dept. Things like marketing and recruitment brochures, alumni magazines, websites & social media, videos - not once has anyone ever said, ""gee, this is a nice picture but it doesn't have enough dynamic range and not enough bits of color depth"" when I give them a photo from the ol' D40. Unless they go digging through the metadata you can't tell what photo came from what camera. I've got photos from that camera that ended up as two page spreads that look fabulous. Somewhere in one of our vendors headquarters, there's a wall sized print from that camera of our students using their products. D40 to D750 is about as big a jump as you can make and the D750 is undoubtedly better in IQ, handling and features (except flash sync speed - D40 still rules there and is still useful for outdoor portraits) but in the real world a pro lens and a couple of speed lights made much more difference to my photography than the body did. The D750 allows me to work faster and in slightly more challenging conditions mostly.  Same with my D7200 at home - the superior AF and machine gun firing capability and its ability to shoot video mean much more to me than the IQ improvement, which is pretty nice but never my main reason for upgrading.    I think the D750 is an awesome camera and is Nikon's best all around camera but it's also not cheap and it's even more expensive when you consider you must upgrade all your lenses to get the IQ improvement over the DX cameras. All of Nikon's recent cameras are all very, very good and the DX cameras are not far behind at all in image quality. If you still feel you need one for your photography, that's fine - I just want you to be making an informed decision."
Nikon,3c6545,c312eal,2,Sun Jul 5 14:43:08 2015 UTC,Heres the thing about going from a d5100 to D750. You can use old lens like the AI or AIS. They will meter to that camera where as the d3100 can't. These lens go for cheap as they have no af but some are even opticially superior to Nikon's new lens. A 50 1.2 ais is about 500 bucks. A canon 50 1.2 is like 1k. You can get the 50mm 1.8 series e ais for about 70 bucks. Super sharp pictures.   As for ppl saying a D750 using a dx lens will perform like a d5100 with a dx lens. That's not true. The high ISO performance in low light of the D750 will blow the shit out of a dx camera
Nikon,3c6545,rideThe,2,Wed Jul 8 21:23:27 2015 UTC,"As for ppl saying a D750 using a dx lens will perform like a d5100 with a dx lens. That's not true. [...]   You do realize that the advantage, in high ISO performance, of a full frame sensor, comes from its larger size, because with a larger surface it can gather more light? If you only keep the central part of the sensor, a part the size of a DX sensor ... well, you're throwing away that advantage."
Nikon,3c6545,c312eal,0,Thu Jul 9 06:49:10 2015 UTC,"You do realize why full frame sensors have better high ISO performance in low light right? Like you said it has a bigger surface on the sensor so pixels are more spaced out. Noise is produced by electrical interference and when you increase sensitivity the interference goes up too. Now since FX pixels is more spaced out and not as compacted like the DX, they have less interference with each other and therefore less noise.   This is why Nikon and Canon's flagship full frame camera's are only around the 16mp area where as say the 810 is at 36. But sensor less pixels, more spaced out pixels, less interference on each pixel, less noise and better high ISO performance.   Now when you set a D750 to crop sensor mode. The pixels don't all of a sudden become compact, they are still more spaced out than a DX camera The sensor is just cropping the surface are but still maintains the high ISO performance."
Nikon,3c6545,c312eal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"The pixels don't all of a sudden become compact, they are still more spaced out than a DX camera   Unless that DX camera has ~10MP, in which case the DX camera's photosites would be just as large/spaced out as in the D750's DX mode. The D800, for example, has pixels the same size as those of a D7000.  Or, looking at it differently, you take your current run-of-the-mill DX sensor that shoots 24MP and downsample its images to ~10MP to get basically the same performance as the D750 in crop mode.  Again, the advantage of a full frame sensor is that it captures more light because it has a larger surface. A DX crop on a full frame sensor receives just as much light as a DX sensor."

Nikon,3c6545,c312eal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:26:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input! I will definitely look into those types of lenses!!
Nikon,3c6545,SausageLegs,2,Wed Jul 8 23:15:24 2015 UTC,"The 28mm F2.8 AIS with CRC is also legendary. You can focus super close, its nikon's closest focusing lens. It's a wide angle with almost ZERO distortion. Once again at 200 bucks. So for those ppl telling you that if you go FX your lens will be expensive, that's also not true. The 135mm F2.8 AIS is like the cream of the crop of crop of all Nikon lens throughout time same with the 105 F2.5 AIS. The famous Afgan Girl picture was taken with the 105. They run for 200-300 bucks. Mounted on the D750, the pictures will look blow your socks off. The D750 high iso performance beats even the D810. Some wedding photographers are actually selling their d810 for a d750.  Better low light performance (important for wedding photography) Pictures take up less space as a 24mp vs a 36mp the 36 files are way bigger. Smaller and lighter."
Nikon,3c6545,c312eal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"I appreciate all your input!! I really need to do more research for myself into some of these lenses! Do you have a 750? For wedding photography what ISO is most popular? You are saying how good it is at low light, is it just that it is a lot less grainy and noisey at higher ISO?"

Nikon,3c6545,c312eal,2,Thu Jul 9 15:46:08 2015 UTC,Saw a few comments about using old MF lenses. I found a great website yesterday that talks about cheap old lenses that are full frame and good quality but mostly MF.  Would make for great starter lens if you jump to FX and don't have enough cash to get good fx lenses right away.  http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/cheapskate-lenses.htm
Nikon,3c6545,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Thu Jul 9 14:38:25 2015 UTC,I use a D750. For weddings it really depends on the lighting conditions. Are you indoors or outdoors? But you want to have the ability to raise your ISO so you can have a faster shutter. D750 ISO 6400 pictures are VERY VERY usable. Barely any noticeable noise or grain. It's great for astro photography too. Astro really show you what your lens and sensor can do.
Nikon,3c6545,c312eal,3,Thu Jul 9 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"If you can't afford new glass with the D750, you probably shouldn't be going for the D750. Or another way to look at it, if you can't afford glass RIGHT NOW, than you should wait until you can. Using DX lenses only, is simply not worth it. Either you have to use crop mode or you are going to have some vignetting, maybe some lenses will be ok, but not worth the headache.   FX glass is not cheap, just know that right off the bat. If you really really want to get the D750 now, than just get the 50mm 1.8g FX for around 200 and save until you can get more lenses."
Nikon,3c6545,jareb,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:33:02 2015 UTC,FX glass could be cheap if you know what what kind of glass to look for. A D5xxx wouldn't allow you to use Nikon's old lens while a D750 will. These old lens run way cheaper than the new glass of Nikon and optically if not better they're not that far off from the performance of the new ones.

Nikon,3c6545,timdesuyo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:31:16 2015 UTC,My main trouble is the fact that it doesn't have an internal focus motor in the body. And it's not weather sealed. I am interested in doing more with it and it just won't let me do as much as I would like. I actually just got he order placed more the d750 in which I also ended up biting the bullet and getting the 24-120 f4 with it.
Nikon,3c6545,MagFreakingNeto,0,Mon Jul 6 21:19:51 2015 UTC,"Cool.  That is a nice camera and lens.  I got the D810 instead of the D750.  I wanted more detail and sharpness in my images.

Nikon,3c6545,timdesuyo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:55:25 2015 UTC,"How much am I going to suffer from not getting any new lens with the D750 and only using my DX lens for the time being?   You'll be shooting with a 10MP DX camera. I would stick with what you have until you have a decent amount of money saved up to get the camera and the lenses. If you can't afford a lens now, you're not getting the full-frame advantage, so why spend the money now. If it takes you 6 months to a year to save up to the point where you can afford the lenses, there might be either a new body out that you like better than the D750 or the price of the D750 might drop. It makes no sense to buy an FX body without lenses.  Full frame is very expensive. It's not just the body. My rule of thumb is to get the most out of a camera, you are probably going to spend at least twice as much on lenses as the body (of course you don't have to buy all those lenses at once but over time it adds up).  Start buying nicer lenses for your D5100... I'd look at a 50mm f/1.8G and maybe a 70-200mm f/4 VR Those are very nice lenses and they'll transition very well to the D750 when you're ready to go.  What kind of things do you shoot and what do you want FX to allow you to do that you cannot do with your D5100?"

Fix this shit!"" So they build them pretty tough.

Let's say that the manufacturing tolerance for a lens is from -5 to +5 ""generic micro-units of autofocus"". Anything within that is perfectly within spec. Lenses of a model vary but are within that range. Same goes for your camera body.   If your camera comes from the factory and is a +2, it's fine and within spec. If the example of the lens you buy is a +3, it's also fine and within spec. But that combination adds up to a +5, which is pushing the envelope of what is acceptably sharp.   With focus fine tuning, you can balance things out and make sure that combination is as sharp as it can be. You can tell it to backfocus a touch with this lens to nail things. Or you may get lucky and your lens is a -2, which balances out the +2 in the body and needs no adjusting. But everything varies. And the D90 had no way to account for it, short of focusing in live view. Designing and building to exact tolerances would make all lenses and bodies prohibitively expensive.   If it helps, think of it like a car. When you get in a new one, you adjust the seats and mirrors and steering wheel to be just right for you. Was the car broken because the seats weren't in the ideal spot for you? Nope. Do you HAVE to adjust them just to be able to drive? Nope, probably not. Does everything get better if you take the time to get them right? Yep."
Nikon,3c3fvo,KaJashey,2,Mon Jul 6 12:58:34 2015 UTC,"A tripod could help with almost all the types of photography you do.  The D7100 is awesome. It's more camera and there are more buttons. It takes a little getting used to. Even from the D90. I did this migration path and I am very happy but it took a few weeks to feel comfortable.  The buffer is OK if you shoot jpeg - and for a sport type situation where you would need the buffer jpeg might be reasonable. It's not that bad honest. You don't do sports or action why would you care about the buffer?   The buffer is just big enough to bracket five 12-bit RAWs high-speed continuous shooting. Hold the camera still pop those off in less than a second and that opens up handheld HDR. With 14-bit RAWs the buffer is gonna fill up and the speed will fall apart.  I preach the virtues of AF-Fine tune. Yes the camera has it and needs it and once you have done it for each of your lenses you have a very accurate setup. In some ways the issue is you have this 24mp setup and everything has to work together - you would not want to pixel peep any picture where it is not all working together.  With everything working to gather in mind sell the 18-105VR with the D90 it does not scale up to 24mp. The 18-140 VR is bigger and heavier and weather sealed and sharper - it is going to resolve to 24mp but for some reason I have never gotten an interesting picture out of it. Might just be me and how I'm using it but it's somehow sharp and uninteresting.  The camera's low light is awesome. The color starts to go but I feel comfortable up to ISO 3200 and will sometimes go to ISO 6400 to get the shot (I do the sports, birds, action, and kids that you don't do plus nature and macro)."

Nikon,3c3fvo,lepermessiah222,2,Sat Jul 4 13:48:53 2015 UTC,"The phase detect system (through the eyepiece focusing) is complicated and it's gotten more so recently. They may not tune this at the factory the way they used to instead they give you an in-camera tool called AF-Fine tune. You use a chart and little of your time and AF-Fine tune the camera for each of your lenses and the focus should be sharper for all of them than the old way. The camera stores a value for each lens and adjusts itself when each is attached. I found AF-Fine tune was needed on my D7100. It's mostly a set it and forget it thing and it does wonders.  The D7100 is a 24 megapixel camera it can be very disappointing if the focus is off ""a little"" on such a big canvas. Kinda like watching High-Def television - you develop a higher expectation."

Nikon,3bzvf5,teezythakidd,4,Fri Jul 3 14:29:12 2015 UTC,"Autofocus during video with most DSLRs is a crap-shoot. Most people stick to manual focus. There are several problems with autofocus during video (some newer cameras have newer technology to help reduce the severity of some of these issues but it doesn't fix all the problems all the way).   What to focus on. You have to either choose a point for the camera to focus on or let the camera choose it's own point. If you choose an incorrect point (or you just leave that square in the center and what you want to focus on is not in the center) it will attempt to focus on that point. If you have 2 people and the focus point is in the center between them, it's going to focus on the background. Contrast Detect AutoFocus: Newer cameras have advanced sensors that include PDAF autofocus that can be used while shooting video. The D7000 is not one of these. When you are shooting stills and looking through the optical viewfinder, a set of mirrors come down that split the light, much of it going up to your eye, but some of it goes down to a special set of PDAF sensors that are specifically designed for autofocus and they can tell which direction out of focus something is. So it can then shift the focus directly where it needs to go. When in video mode, the mirror comes up and it does not have those PDAF sensors available. When in video or live-view still mode, it must rely on what is called Contrast Detection AF. That is basically ""I'm going to move the lens in one direction, and I'm going to see if it gets better. If it gets better I'm going to keep moving it. If it gets worse I'll move in the other direction. I'll keep moving it as long as it gets better, and once it starts getting worse, I'll move it back a little bit."" This is not a very pleasing thing to have in your video while recording. As I said, some newer cameras have new PDAF sensors built into the imaging sensor that can be used during video recording, but even then they have to be used carefully: Changing focus during video recording can be distracting. Generally you do not want to have the focus jump quickly during  video. It's jarring to the viewer. If you do have a scene where you have multiple people at different distances and you want to change focus while they're talking, you want the change to be slow and smooth so that the transition eases.   On a movie set, they don't use manual focus. There is a job that is called the focus puller (I think it's the 1st assistant), pretty much their whole job is to focus the camera. The also will tend to measure out the distances to things and set the focus by distance, and choreograph the camera movements and focus changes to keep subjects in focus as they or the camera moves or to transition the focus from one subject to another."

Every millimeter of focal length seems to count more and more at that extreme wide end. The difference between my 16-35 and your 14-24 is probably less than between that and the (theoretical) 12-24.  I love how sharp and small and wide the 8-16mm is, even though the 16-35 f/4 is possibly sharper, and both it and the 14-24 let me shoot in lower light.

You listed a ton of specs but but you didn't really go into how you want to use the camera. FX has advantages, but older FX cameras also have disadvantages. The trick is nailing down which advantages you need, and what disadvantages won't affect you as much.   I'm also a bit confused, you said you'd buy camera in a heart beat if it had 4k but then digress saying you don't really do much video... I'm really confused what you need and want to do with the camera.   Keep in mind none of your lenses are FX, so if you go to a full frame camera, you're basically ditching your entire kit. If that is the case and you really want 4K, then I'd consider jumping ship entirely and look at the Sony A7s or the brand new A7r Mk II."
Nikon,3bxg5p,W00ster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course, so I use it recreationally for some landscapes, just shooting the seasons in my neighborhood (suburbia...where the seasons change) and then there are times i'll go into DC and shoot street photography of just stuff going on. I'll travel with it, I got my D90 when I went to europe, and have taken thousands of photos with it of landmarks, in old churches sans flash (easy way to learn about ISO) I go to sporting events and try to catch good moments in baseball games, specific pitchers deliverys/throwing motions, batters swings, crowd shots, etc.   I also am getting back into photojournalism for EDM concerts, the 35mm was a huge improvement in my arsenal for that, but it's starting to hit its limits. I'm coveting an FX camera with the 85mm lens. So some time lapse photos of glowstick cannons can be kinda cool, fireworks errupting, etc.   Like I say, less video more photography.   And I hear you, I'd be ditching the whole setup I have, or relegating it to second fiddle with a new setup. But this would be a lifelong choice. Like I wouldn't move beyond Nikon FX lenses, I'd be hunting for classic lenses on ebay and stuff. Whole hobby/collector lifestyle.   I say I'd get it if it had 4k because I've been looking at a GoPro for that reason, and if I was gonna drop 400 on a GoPro just for 4k, I could fathom just rolling that into the cost of a 7200. If that makes sense? So the 7200 wouldnt be like 1200$ it'd be like 800 or 900, taking the task of two tools. Weird justification I know. But it's about multitasking rather than unitasking or diversifying responsibilities."
Nikon,3bxg5p,ApatheticAbsurdist,3,Fri Jul 3 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"It's good to keep in mind how you shoot, what you shoot, and where you're frustrated with your current gear when looking at a new camera. Features like 4K can be appealing, but as you point out, in reality it's just a side thing. Focus on the things you need most regularly.  I'd probably lean towards the D7200 in your case, an 8 year old D3 or a 7 year old D700 just don't have as much advantage over a current generation DX camera as a current FX camera would.    High ISO. It is one of the biggest reasons to go to full-frame. However, newer sensors and newer processing have improved high ISO performance. A D7200 is pretty comparable to a D3 or D700 in terms of high ISO, especially when you consider that the D7200 has far more resolution, so the noise will get averaged out more when resizing for web or print use. FPS. This is really where the D3 still shines brightest. It can shoot at far higher fps than the D7200. The D700 can shoot at a little bit higher, if you add the grip and a high end battery, but without that it's actually a tad bit slower fps than the D7200. In either case the D7200 is a noticeable improvement in FPS over the D90. If you wish your camera could shoot a bit of a faster burst, you'll be very happy with the D7200. If the biggest thing you want to change on your D90 is to have it shoot a lot more bursts shots per second, maybe the D3 is in order. DOF. Yes you can get shallower DOF with a full frame camera because you'll be using an 85mm f/1.8 instead of a 50mm f/1.8. But super shallow DOF can be a bit of a gimmick that wears off. A 50mm f/1.4 can give you pretty decent shallow DOF, and an 85mm f/1.8 still looks awesome on a DX body (it's tighter so you shoot a little farther away but you can still get some nice shallow DOF). Dynamic range. The D7200 wins this hands down, at least at lower ISO (it's more a tie at high ISO). If you shoot at 100 ISO you can pull an insane amount of detail out of the shadows. I have a D800 with a sensor performance a little closer to the D7200 than the D3's... If it's a very high contrast scene I'll intentionally underexpose by quite a bit and I can still have a ton of detail that i can pull out of the RAW files. Resolution. 24MP gives you a noticeable about of more detail. It allows you to either print larger or crop in more. There are times where I'll go around with just a 50mm lens and a wide angle, if I wish I had a slightly longer lens, I can just crop it in post. Controls. Some people love having more buttons and dials. The D3 and the D700 do the button layout is a little different and takes a little getting used to but some people love it. If you like the button and control layout of your D90, you'll be right at home with the D7200.   As far as the FX and 85mm combination. The 85mm f/1.8 works GREAT on a DX camera (killer head shot lens).  Speaking of lenses... to replace what you have you'd need to buy a 50mm f/1.8 ($100-200), a 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 ($585), and something like a 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5 ($600). You might be able to cut costs getting used lenses, but in all honesty if you go to FX, you want to probably get higher end lenses like a 70-200mm f/4 and such... my formula is to get the most out of a camera you're probably going to spend at least twice as much on lenses as the body.  Personally I'd look at a D7200, or maybe see if you find a deal on a D7100. Use the money on lenses. Then down the road if/when you feel the need to upgrade maybe you'll have more FX lenses."
Nikon,3bxg5p,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:01:18 2015 UTC,"I don't have any of those but what you need to think about is if you move to an FX system, the lenses you need will also be more expensive.    I am not sure any FX DSLR with 4k video exists at this point.    Also remember that CF cards are faster than SD cards which means when the buffer is full, it will be written to the CF card faster.    If you can afford it, go FX, else stay DX, get a new DX camera you can afford and buy better glass."

I don't know if the new Canon 5DS is using a sony sensor, but I know all their other cameras use sensors that Canon makes in house... that slows down their upgrade cycle drastically. But canon excels at software and UI. The interface on their cameras is noticeably faster.  I'm sticking with Nikon, but the Sony's are raising my eyebrows. They've really started to nail down the camera design (not just the sensors, things like focus peaking, very good Image Stabilization built into the body, etc). The downside is lenses... They've got Zeiss backing them making some nice lenses and a lot of their lenses designs for the Alpha DSLR line were based on very good Minolta designs (which were often designed by Leica). But they don't have millions and millions of lenses available on the used market at this point. You can get adaptors and put Nikon and Canon lenses on them though.  I'm still a Nikon user, but I'm first and foremost a photographer. I can't count the number of camera systems I've used, each has advantages and each has disadvantages. The Nikon still serves me well for what I need to do. But if I was in a place where I had to replace all my gear, I'd be doing a lot of research on the Sony A7 line right now. I can't say for certain if I'd get one, but I'd definitely research it to see if I should."

No complaints about the D750 at all. Very small and shoot well. It's loaded with features. I really really enjoy it, along with my new FX lenses :)  I'd recommend a few lenses to consider as well. The 35mm and 50mm in both f/1.4 and f/1.8. I love the combo !  The price of the D750 just recently dropped about $300.  Use camelcamelcamel.com to check out the pricing changes recently.

Nikon lenses don't need any electronics at all for the electronic focus assist to work, that all happens on the AF sensor - you can test it out with any old AI lens.  The chip passes aperture info to the body so it can use it in A mode without having to be set up as a custom lens and make S & P modes available, as well as passing exif info about the lens."

Nikon,3btrlb,htmwrx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:24:19 2015 UTC,"Hey so I'm looking for a good astrophotography lens, I was considering this lens vs the 14-24. Would you happen to have any opinions between these two?"
Nikon,3btrlb,alandizzle,2,Thu Jul 2 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"The tokina probably fits your needs a bit more, it's got autofocus and a pretty useful zoom range.  The rokinon is manual focus, very wide and is very sharp wide open. The only field I would give it the edge over the tokina is astrophotography though. One thing to note is the 'mustache' style distortion that's very hard to correct. This is a non issue with astro or even landscapes but can be tricky if you need straight lines in your shots."
Nikon,3btrlb,lepermessiah222,2,Thu Jul 2 02:55:09 2015 UTC,"I too have the Rokinon 14/2.8 and it's a fun lens.   It has a bunch of distortion that is not really fixable so if you're shooting straight lines, you might want to look elsewhere.   It also gets smeary in the corners and edges of the frame - partly because it's so wide and some of that is just the unavoidable distortion of a scene from lens with that wide an angle of view but it's really noticeable if you ever try to use it for a serious group photo (don't do that!).   Lack of AF is not much of a hindrance as it's got depth-of-field for days. Even wide open it's not that big a deal - depending on how far you think your main subject is going to be just set it somewhere between 3~10 feet and forget about it. Stop it down a bit and it doesn't much matter where you set it."
Nikon,3btrlb,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Tamron should be compared to the 14-24mm or 17-35mm. The rokinon is a prime while the others are zooms. None the less, a prime would probably much lighter than either of those 3 I mentioned and cheaper.   All those I mentioned have AF built in as well."
Nikon,3btrlb,ahmed_iAm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:27:51 2015 UTC,"What are you shooting on?  I have a 14 f/2.8 (Samyang, Rokinon, Bower... all the same lens with different branding). I love ultra wide. The manual focus takes a little getting used to because don't see the out of focus areas as well because the DOF is not as dramatic (but by the same token you don't have to be as accurate). I found the lens just a little bit soft wide open, but stopping down to f/5.6-8, it gets nice and sharp (and you really didn't have to worry much with focus at that point as the DOF gets pretty big). It's very light and it's price is very nice. It does have quite a bit of distortion, but you can get a lens profile for lightroom to fix that.  Eventually I probably would have upgraded to the 16-35mm f/4 VR, but a friend was selling his 14-24mm for a good price so I jumped on that. The 14-24 is amazing but it's not perfect. The price of it combined with how delicate it is (the protruding front element and how notorious it is for locking up from minor drops/bangs) makes you a bit more nervous to use it which is not exactly a good mindset.  I looked at the Tokina but if I went with a 16mm lens, I'd have liked to get something I could stick an ND filter on (no filter thread). Outside of that complaint, it looked pretty good. The zoom gives you a bit more flexibility, and autofocus is nice to have. 16mm is very wide, it's as much wider than 24 as much as 24 is wider than 35mm. 14mm can be too wide at times.   For you, I think the Tokina might be a good fit.  All this presupposes you're shooting with an FX camera. If you're shooting DX, forget everything and get the Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8"
Nikon,3btrlb,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:22:54 2015 UTC,"I actually own both of these lenses, believe it or not!  Both lenses I would highly recommend depending on usage needs.  The reason I have both is because I started with the tokina 16-28, but ended up wanting to go as wide as possible for some Astro shots this summer.  The rokinon/samyang is super sharp even wide open AND has very very good coma correction making it one of if not the best lenses for astro. And at a very good price.    If your budget can only do one, I'd get the tokina just because it's much more well rounded and very very good performer.  If you only/mostly care about astro, then definitely the rokinon.  Downsides of the rokinon: weird distortion.  Correctable, but not flawless.  Not the best pick for architecture/interior work."
Nikon,3btrlb,cactus22minus1,0,Thu Jul 2 17:24:58 2015 UTC,Perhaps the Tokina 11-16 would fit well since it contains both in its range.
Nikon,3btrlb,manofthewild07,3,Thu Jul 2 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"My guess is the OP owns a FX camera body. Generally, you don't use DX UWA lenses on FX bodies, and visa versa."

Nikon,3bs6ln,eppic123,3,Wed Jul 1 18:43:00 2015 UTC,If you are shooting something that requires a fast shutter speed (i.e. air planes) then it does nothing for you but if you are shooting other things that are not moving then it is sweet.
Nikon,3bs6ln,cmaxwe,2,Wed Jul 1 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"I don't completely agree with this - even when your shutter speeds are high enough to not theoretically need VR, VR is very helpful in keeping your view through the viewfinder steady which makes it much easier to track your target and keep it in the frame, and keep your AF points painted on your target."
Nikon,3bs6ln,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:12:01 2015 UTC,Not to be that guy but airplanes are a bad example. Horizontal and vertical pans will still benefit from vr as it will cancel out the non-panning axis and keep your swing nice and straight.  Shooting planes actually benefits a lot from vr.
Nikon,3bs6ln,sushimpp,3,Fri Jul 3 11:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'll mainly shoot the lens hand held and fairly wide open. How much would I benefit from the VR and is it worth taking it over the 2.8 at 200mm(300mm on DX)?   Does your shutter speed dip below 1/(2x FL)? If so, your VR might help. But if your hands are steady enough, you might be able to get a stop by being still."

Nikon,3bs6ln,SSII,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:55:28 2015 UTC,Those are some pretty solid shots! How sharp would you you say is your 70-300 and how would you discribe the build quality compared to other lenses?
Nikon,3bs6ln,SSII,2,Fri Jul 3 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"Build quality is ok.  The lens has a plastic feel for sure, but the elements are solid; overall it is fine and cutting some weight is nice.  As far as sharpness goes, it does get a bit soft out at zoom, but Those shots were out at 200mm or more, with minimal sharpening (if any - I don't remember, just used NX2).  Pretty much, I am happy to lose a bit of sharpness, have a lens with moving housing and average build quality, but save some money and carry a smaller lighter lens around."
Nikon,3bs6ln,ApatheticAbsurdist,3,Mon Jul 6 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"If you're shooting very fast subject and you need to keep a fast shutter speed anyway, VR looses a lot of it's advantage. There are still some advantages, some feel it helps with framing by stabilizing the image as you're focusing, etc.  However if you often shoot more stationary or slower moving subjects, VR can be more advantageous than an ultra wide aperture. Right now you have a 200mm f/5.6, an f/2.8 will give you a theoretical 2 stop advantage (assuming the lens is as sharp at f/2.8 as your lens is at f/5.6... some wide aperture lenses can be a bit soft and you might want to stop down a bit anyway, negating some of the advantage... but I digress). 2 Stops is a good deal, but many VR lenses give you a 3 or sometimes even a 4 stop advantage. That however only works if your subject is slow enough that that slow of a shutter speed won't cause blur on the subject (as VR only stops shake not blur from the subject moving).  So let's use a few examples... For both let's assume you need 1/500th of a second to keep your image still with you current 200mm f/5.6 non-VR lens:  Lets say you want to shoot a building or other completely stationary subject as the light is fading a bit and your exposure for your current lens would be 1/500th at f/5.6 at 1600 ISO.  With an f/2.8 lens you'd be able to open up 2 more stops (assuming DOF and lens sharpness is not an issue) meaning you could take the same shot at 1/500th at f/2.8 at 400 ISO. With VR you might get a 3 stop advantage in shutter speed so you might be able to shoot at close to 1/60th at f/5.6 at 200 ISO. For the sake of argument, in this case you could also break out a tripod, use your current lens and shoot at 1/15th at f/8 at 100 ISO which might look better than either of the others.  If you're shooting a portrait, you probably don't want to go much slower than 1/125th of a second (at 1/60th if the subject moves a little too much you can get some blur). In that case 1/500th at f/2.8 is the same at 1/125th at f/5.6. You might prefer f/2.8 in this case if you like shallower DOF, though.  Let's say you're shooting some very fast moving sports and need 1/1000th of a second to make sure it's crisp. Here the wider aperture wins, because VR isn't going to let you use a slower shutter speed. The f/2.8 will let you shoot at 2 stops lower ISO if you need it."
Nikon,3bs6ln,MughalPrince22,2,Thu Jul 2 00:28:32 2015 UTC,If it's hand held I think the VR will make a difference in the sharpness of photos unless you're able to keep your shutter speed very high

Nikon,3bs6ln,mrdat,2,Wed Jul 1 23:43:19 2015 UTC,You don't gain an extra 50mm because you're  on DX. Please forget equivalent values!
Nikon,3bs6ln,SSII,2,Thu Jul 2 00:37:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the comments, guys. I'd say I'm now leaning more towards the 70-300VR. It seems to be the better alround lens and gives me the extra 100mm in case I'll ever need it.   And I still have my Sigma 105mm 2.8 for some nice bokeh shots. The compression is not the same as with the 70-200, but you can't have everything if you're tight on money. And I'd guess the Sigma macro is a bit sharper at 2.8 than the Tamron budget 70-200.  Speaking of Tamron: How is the Tamron 70-300 4-5.6 VC? I've watched some videos on it and aparently Tamrons VR is better, it's cheaper and it's supposedly just as good as the Nikon in sharpness and build quality. But one is still a Nikon, the other is ""only"" a Tamron. :/"

Nikon,3brd6u,MrJezzaaah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"To work on your D40x, you need to make sure that any lens is an ""AF-S"" lens if it's nikon. If it's a Sigma, Tamron, or other 3rd party, you must make sure the lens has it's own AF motor or otherwise lists as being compatible with the D40x. Some lenses like Nikon's AF-D lenses (typically have a ""D"" after the aperture e.g.: f/2.8D) will not autofocus on your D40x because they lack an AF motor and the AF needs to be driven by the camera (and the D40x does not have it's own AF motor to drive such lenses).  What do you hope to shoot with a telephoto lens? Do you mostly shoot on a tripod or do you mostly shoot handheld? Do you plan on mostly shooting in bright daylight? What is your budget?"
Nikon,3brd6u,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply. I hope to shoot some wildlife and landscape with the telephoto. I also want to be able to shoot stuff I cant get close to when travelling. I shoot on both a tripod and handheld but predominately handheld. I also do plan on shooting mostly in daylight but lowlight on a tripod would be nice too. $200-$400 CAD is the budget I would like to stay within (I was hoping since this is a little of an older model camera i would be able to get the lens(es) cheaper)
Nikon,3brd6u,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Wed Jul 1 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is that while the camera is older, it was one of the first in a newer line that requires newer lenses to autofocus, so you cannot use the older lenses from the 90's unless you are ok with only manually focusing.  My best recommendation would be a Nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G DX VR lens"
Nikon,3brd6u,benfires,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"As the other comment said, a 55-300 would pair well with your current kit lens. If you intend to have a one lens replacement, then probably an 18-300 is your best option. If you're really strapped for cash I don't see why a 3rd party non-VC 70-300 can't get the job done, though it might be a bit overkill. I got my tamron 70-300 non-VC for under 200USD (in equivalent local currency) brand new.  While the D40x is capable, it's admittedly quite outdated so don't expect the AF to be fast. You might be able to sell your D40x body and get a D90, then maybe see how much remaining cash you have to pick up a lens. The D90 is slightly more flexible with lenses because it has a built in screw motor for AF with older lenses, so perhaps an older but cheaper AF-D 70-300 may also fall within your total budget.  Edit; the 70-300 may be overkill because it's a full frame lens, but I don't recall any 3rd party making a telephoto 300mm for crop sensor nikon. Also, I don't think getting a 2nd hand camera would be a problem as long as you know what to look out for. That should help squeeze your budget further.  Edit 2; really, I get downvoted for making a suggestion within OP'S budget?"
Nikon,3bq9ft,DrMiraculous,5,Wed Jul 1 07:26:58 2015 UTC,"The D5100 + 55-200 DX can get some pretty nice stuff for sports, though I agree there might be some shortcomings that could hurt.  One is AF recognition and speed. Choosing your AF combination is important. Try to see if you can set your camera to use AF-C (continuous), and then assign it to your rear AE/AF-L button (which is called back button focus). Takes a bit of getting used to but BBF works better for me for action shots. Single point AF should be used if you know you can track a subject on a given point, else you should stick it on auto area.  Two is buffer size. Even if you set your camera to take continuous photos you'll notice that it slows down or stops after several shots. This is because the digital memory (or buffer) in the camera fills up before it can transfer the data to the card. Getting a faster card can help but the price/performance gives diminishing returns. Another way to raise your buffer is to shoot in JPEG instead of RAW. If a test shot looks good and the sunlight isn't casting any sort of weird shadow or is directly overhead, you should not need to edit too far from RAW unless you intend to make money off the shots.  Three is your lens. I could just straight off and suggest you replace it with a beastly 300mm f/2.8 but no. You could try looking for one of those lens attachments that give a telephoto effect (as opposed to the common wide angle) but know that any glass you put in front of your lens will degrade the image to some extent. Otherwise just leave the hood on.  Four is your camera mode. What are you shooting with, PSAM? For all intents and purposes I'd say try M mode, set it to a comfortable aperture and shutter speed to catch action, then turn on auto iso. It's sort of a cheat mode where you decide aperture and shutter speed and leave iso to the camera. Downside is if your shutter speed base is too slow, you will need to raise it higher manually or your shots get overexposed.  If you're really interested try getting the 70-300 VR. Yes it's a full frame lens, but it's a pretty budget telephoto zoom and it has VR. All this is what I'd use though, feel free to chime in as well :)  Edit; all said and done, but make sure you leave your release mode to continuous burst. Single can also be used but you might experience flinching because of the repetitive finger action."
Nikon,3bq9ft,benfires,5,Wed Jul 1 10:17:56 2015 UTC,"thanks for the advice! I use the continuous mode, but havent tried assigning it to the back focus button. So far its been all in RAW, but i will try shooting in jpg if it will give a better transfer to the card.     I might try that lens, it sounds like it would help me get better shots in the outfield which i have had trouble with. As for camera mode, I usually rely on the sport setting but often wander thru A and S, just trying to see what works! Thats part of my reason for posting, seeing what mode or settings might improve my luck."
Nikon,3bq9ft,benfires,3,Thu Jul 2 06:44:25 2015 UTC,"If you are strapped for cash, you could have a look at the 3rd party 70-300 lenses which don't have VC. Of course you lose out on build quality and VC but if you shoot on a tripod people advise leaving VC off anyway. If you're still unsure, the best way is to borrow or rent lenses and see what fits your shooting and your budget.  Also for BBF, look through the custom settings like AF-C tracking delay or something like that. Personally I turn it off, you can try the different settings to see what suits you."
Nikon,3bq9ft,DeltaCharlieNiner,3,Thu Jul 2 07:02:40 2015 UTC,"I hadnt thought to rent one, thats a great idea, thanks so much! I dont use a tripod, so VC would be a good thing."
Nikon,3bq9ft,benfires,2,Thu Jul 2 07:32:45 2015 UTC,"Generally I leave the tracking to low or normal but not completely off. This is because if you use a lens with extremely fast autofocus, if you move your AF point slightly off target, it will refocus immediately if you have tracking disabled."
Nikon,3bq9ft,DeltaCharlieNiner,2,Thu Jul 2 07:12:36 2015 UTC,That's why nikon invented 3d AF hahaha :) well to each his own. Hope to see more sports shots from you!
Nikon,3bq9ft,r_golan_trevize,3,Thu Jul 2 07:16:10 2015 UTC,"If you don't have too much money to throw around, the 70-300 4.5-5.6 VR is a fairly good lens for shooting sports, a good balance of range, handling and price. Nikon's 55-300 4-5.6 VR might be a good choice too. You can try the third party 70-300 lenses as well.  If you are not planning on buying anything (which is fine, as the 55-200 works fine, I've used it at several carnivals), be sure to keep your finger right on the shutter along with Continuous Servo AF and back button focusing as mentioned above. This reduces your need to hunt then acquire focus on your target, quickening your reflex shot. This is a must in sport as there are plenty of moments that come and go in an instant. Continuous burst with JPEG is also a good idea.  From what I've seen, your shots are pretty good. Be sure to keep the shutter speed up though (at least 1/250 or 1/320 to freeze the slowest of sports). Don't be afraid to crank the ISO higher if you need to.  Good luck :)"
Nikon,3bq9ft,r_golan_trevize,3,Wed Jul 1 13:01:14 2015 UTC,"thanks so much! The shots turn out good sometimes, but i have trouble getting consistently nice images. I am pretty happy with the lens for most things, but I might study up on the options. I do up the ISO pretty high sometimes, but I seem to have trouble with the subject being less sharp than the background. I will try working with the shutter speed, thanks again for the encouragement!"

Nikon,3bouu4,timdesuyo,2,Wed Jul 1 13:43:56 2015 UTC,Heh. My camera was in the mail for a week. I read the manual while waiting. All 700 pages.  I had swapped from Canon and had to get familiar with all things Nikon in a hurry.
Nikon,3bouu4,Aaberg123,3,Sun Jul 5 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"Those are other focus points that are also in focus(ie, same distance from the camera give or take your depth of field wide open).  For example, if you hit a focus target that fills the frame straight on, then in theory, every point should be in focus."
Nikon,3bouu4,jgilbs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:53:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, /u/jgilbs!   It made sense that more than one point light up to show what is on focus but I was expecting only points on the same plane. I wasn't thinking about the Depth of Field."
Nikon,3boa1c,cyanight7,5,Tue Jun 30 20:30:54 2015 UTC,I freaking love my 70-300 VR and it has given me wonderful fricking stunning pictures every time I have taken it out. The 250-300mm range is soft and not as useful as the rest of the range. So it is more limited than you think but what comes out of it is very very good for the good range of 70-250mm.  It's an FX lens so it is bigger and more built out than what a DX camera needs. Your shooting through the center so you get edge to edge sharp on DX.
Nikon,3boa1c,KaJashey,2,Tue Jun 30 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"This.  I love my 70-300 VR, too.  Not ""love my wife and kids"" kind of love, but you get the idea.

Nikon,3boa1c,jgilbs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"Good point. That was the AF-D.  My point still stands, as I also purchased an AF-S for $379."

Nikon,3boa1c,jgilbs,0,Wed Jul 1 13:06:31 2015 UTC,"Its ""rarer"" and heavy so its not recommended?  How about its a good lens, and its in line with what OP is asking for.  The 70-200 he's considering isnt much lighter."
Nikon,3boa1c,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Wed Jul 1 14:14:39 2015 UTC,It weighs twice as much as the 70-300mm that OP was considering (I didn't see OP considering a 70-200mm) and even then some people are recommending the 55-300mm over that as it's even lighter.

Nikon,3bo55i,Hades2k,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:03:31 2015 UTC,"It is most likely a connection problem between the grip and the body, or a connection problem in the mechanism that checks if the battery is inserted fully. There have been similar problems with Nikon D7100/7200 grips.  Check for any debris or dust on the connections and try do some more Googling about similar problems."
Nikon,3bmcw0,Dymanic75,7,Tue Jun 30 11:28:41 2015 UTC,"Don't know about your background in photography, but if you are a begginner looking to improve, I would say none! Try and spend a few months with that focal lenght only.  If not, I would go for a more limited range like the 18-140. The longer the range the more IQ suffers at the longer end, so, in my opinion, 18-200's and 18-300's are out of the question."
Nikon,3bmcw0,lepermessiah222,2,Tue Jun 30 13:56:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input - I think I will probably wait and stick to using the 35mm mainly for the next few months.   Looking at Nikonites a lot of people reccomend the 16-85mm Nikon too so may consider that one along with the 18-140mm. They are both a lot cheaper than the 18-200/300.
Nikon,3bmcw0,lepermessiah222,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:06:32 2015 UTC,"16-85 makes sense. But not with a 18-140, they overlap quite a bit! I'd suggest you look at a dedicated telephoto zoom if you're looking at complimenting the 16-85's range. Something like a 70-300 maybe?  You still have a few months to think about that ;)"
Nikon,3bmcw0,opticalminefield,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:31:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry I meant I would consider 1 of those 2, but not both ;)"
Nikon,3bmcw0,opticalminefield,3,Tue Jun 30 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"You could go with the 55-250 VR unless you need the wider end.   http://www.cameralabs.com/reviews/Nikkor_DX_55-200mm_VR/verdict.shtml  For me I'd go with that because I'd also pick up the Tokina 11-16 for landscapes.   Then I'd have 11-16, 35, 50, 55-250.   Sure the 55-250 isn't a fast lens but it's a lot cheaper than a 70-200/2.8 ;)  It really depends on where you are being limited. What can't you do with your current lenses?  Edit: also the Sigma 17-70/2.8-4 is a possible all-round zoom with a decent aperture (if you've been spoiled by your 1.8 primes)"
Nikon,3bmcw0,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:18:49 2015 UTC,"Firstly, thanks for your response.  At the moment I cannot zoom if needed, so if the kids are playing I like to sometimes stay at a bit of a distance so they are not aware I am taking photos, they then turn out a bit more natural than if I am in their face ;)  I suppose really I am after a do it all lens that I can just throw on when we go out for the day and I can use zoomed or wide if needed, which is why I was initially looking at the 18-140/300. Also I don't want to carry too much around with me - most of the time I would want to just have the camera with lens attached plus 1 spare in my smallish bag.  I did have the 55-300 when I had my 18-200 but found it didnt got used enough as the 18-200 was on most of the time.  Will have a look at that Sigma 17-70 - I have never tried a Sigma lens before so am a bit unsure about the brand.  Edit: Also should maybe mention that I did order the 18-55 VR II from Amazon but they sent the original older VR by mistake, so I have sent that back but am now unsure if I should re-order that or save up for something with more range."
Nikon,3bmcw0,tavenger5,2,Tue Jun 30 12:58:05 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I've been mulling similar questions over because I'm switching from Canon.   But in the end I think I'll go full frame and all my research on DX options will go to waste :)  From what you describe any of the 18-xxx would be perfect. 18 is plenty wide unless you are doing landscapes and know you want to get wider. I doubt you'll need more than 140 to get distance from the kids. I mostly use a 15-85 with my kids and rarely pull out my 55-250. When I do I stick to around 150 anyway.   Which you choose is probably more about budget, size and weight. From what I've read they all perform pretty much the same in the range that overlaps.  Then you can always carry the 50 and/or 35 prime for when you want a sharper shot, bokeh, or need the extra stops for low light situations."
Nikon,3bmcw0,enhancedakuma,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:07:52 2015 UTC,Thanks again. I think I am decided on the 140 now :)
Nikon,3bmcw0,tavenger5,3,Wed Jul 1 08:58:43 2015 UTC,"The 18-140mm is a fine lens and it doesn't cost a ton. If you're not shooting things from a football field away, it's a great option.   The 16-85mm is a tad bit sharper and gives you a little wider field of view, but it's more expensive and you don't get as much telephoto range. If you're really picky about sharpness, people will pay for it, but it's costs a bit and many people might not find the improvement in sharpness as noticeable as others would.  However I'd look at the lenses you have and see where you're most frustrated. If you find you want to be around the 35mm and 50mm but zoom in and around that focal length than either of the above lenses will be fine. If however you find you mostly want to zoom in more, then I'd look at a 55-250mm VR and if you typically wish you could zoom out wider I'd look at various wide options like the Tokina 11-20mm f/2.8 or Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8"
Nikon,3bmcw0,KaJashey,2,Tue Jun 30 18:53:04 2015 UTC,Take a look at the 55-300mm. It's a great lens for the price. The 18-300mm is great if you can only take one lens with you and you need something versatile.
Nikon,3bmcw0,r_golan_trevize,2,Tue Jun 30 12:54:03 2015 UTC,Thanks. Do you know if the 18-140 is any good - there is quite a bit of price difference between that and the 18-300 so am unsure if the 300 is worth the extra money. Plus will take longer to save for it - few months at least.
Nikon,3bmcw0,figgy_puddin,2,Tue Jun 30 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"I recently purchased a D5500 with the 18-140mm 3.6-5.6f and I love it. You get adequate zoom to cover a good range of situations without some of the weight issues that longer zoom range lenses will have. I do agree that sticking with the prime lenses for a couple months to get a good handle on them is a good idea, but the 18-140 is well worth the price, especially if you get a used/like new or a refurbished one off of Amazon, you can easily save $100-$200 that way."
Nikon,3bmcw0,mrdat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't used the 140 but I would rather spend a little more and get the 200 or 300. It depends on how much reach you want. For kids running around you probably won't need 300. Keep in mind the weight too.   Fyi, Some guys on sites like nikonites would know better then me. There's probably already threads in there discussing this exact situation.  Search ""18-140 vs 18-200"" or whatever."
Nikon,3bmcw0,MughalPrince22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:18:25 2015 UTC,Thanks will have a look on nikonites :)  I kind of elminated the 200 even though it will probably have enough reach as the price and weight is pretty much the same as the newer 18-300.
Nikon,3bmcw0,Socrateswasacowboy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"The 18-140 VR is sharp all over, big, heavy, well built and for some reason I have never taken an interesting photo with it.   It's a safety lens I take when I don't know what to take. I act safe with it and I get nothing I want to show off."
Nikon,3bmcw0,Socrateswasacowboy,2,Tue Jun 30 13:59:26 2015 UTC,"An 18-XX is still worth getting, especially as cheap as an 18-55 can be found for. I don't know how you live without the wide angle. They complement the 35/1.8 or 50mm lenses - the zoom gives you a lot of flexibility in halfway decent light while the primes give you a low light weapon or when you want extreme background separation.  For telephoto zooms, either of the 55-200, 55-300 or 70-300 VR, whichever fits your budget and needs. They all are very good with the exception of being a little soft wide open at their longest focal lengths. The 55-200 is tiny and the cheapest, the 55-300 gives you some more length for a little bit more money, size and weight while the 70-300 is significantly bigger and heavier and more expensive but gives you much faster AF performance."
Nikon,3bkfka,robot-broccoli,5,Mon Jun 29 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The D90 (which I shoot and love and have 100k photos out of) lacks autofocus fine tuning. Every lens will will vary in its sharpness.   Out of a sampling of my lenses, each has a different focus accuracy through the D90 viewfinder:   50mm 1.8: slight front focus 35mm 1.8 (mine): substantial back focus 35mm 1.8 (friend's): dead on and painfully sharp  105mm Micro: dead on and sharp  18-105mm: slight front focus 55-200: close enough to not be a thing 28mm AI: slight front focus   On the D7100, all are focus fine-tuned to be dead on.   When you shoot in live view, it reads directly off the sensor and eliminates any discrepancies between mirror, AF metering and sensor. For critical focus, that's the way to go.   Next best workaround is to shoot more at f/5.6 or f/8 to give it enough depth of field to mask focus issues.  If you're really committed to clearing it up as best you can, send it in to Nikon to have them calibrate the autofocus. That will eliminate a big chunk of the variances, but you'll still have the natural variations in specific instances of the lenses that can only be eliminated with the AF fine-tuning that is available in the D7000 and later DX bodies."

Nikon,3bkfka,ambiguouslysizedhawk,2,Tue Jun 30 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"I can't explain it the pictures being dull, but your camera might be front or back focusing using the viewfinder.  The live view uses the actual image sensor to detect when an image is in focus.  The viewfinder uses a separate phases detect sensor. Depending on the lens you use, there might be a misalignment between the phase sensor and the image sensor in your camera, which will give you auto focus problems.  Unfortunately, the D90 can't be adjusted for this common error by the user.  If you could post images, we might be able to better help you."
Nikon,3bkfka,Aaberg123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:47:45 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the way auto focus works is completely different between live view and viewfinder. Forget the details but it's a completely different technology.  Not much help but it's all I know.  I would just try calling nikon

I always liked the 35-70/2.8 for its compact size, and decent optical quality. Back then, it was pretty much the only reasonably good short zoom available."
Nikon,3bdu4d,savrox,3,Sun Jun 28 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"I have a 50mm f/1.4D it's a nice lens, but it is definitely not sharp wide open. Unless I'm desperate I tend to shoot at f/2.2 or smaller because it's really soft at f/1.4. If sharpness is your goal I'd look at macro lenses like the 60mm f/2.8 or 105mm f/2.8 VR.  If f/2.8 is not wide enough for you and you want something sharper you're going to go up in weight and price. Here are a few options that are specifically made to be sharp at wide apertures:   Nikon 58mm f/1.4G $1696, 1.3lbs Zeiss Otus 55mm f/1.4 $3,990, 2.13lbs, manual focus Sigma 50mm f/1.4 Art $849, 1.79lbs   Note after seeing your other comment: The only one of these lenses that I listed that has VR is the Nikon 105mm f/2.8 Macro VR. For all the other lenses including the one you have, make sure you keep the shutter speed high enough to avoid blur."
Nikon,3bdu4d,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:55:45 2015 UTC,The 58/1.4 isn't really super tack sharp at 1.4 (it is by 2.8 though) - but it's beautiful wide open. Best bokeh I've ever seen. I want one really badly now that I've spent a week with it...
Nikon,3bdu4d,RT60,2,Mon Jun 29 00:34:12 2015 UTC,I sold my 1.4D and 1.8D and got the 1.8G and am very happy with my choice. The 85mm 1.4D is also a winner.
Nikon,3bdu4d,mrdat,2,Sun Jun 28 13:42:59 2015 UTC,The 85mm 1.4D is also a winner.   I disagree. I strongly recommend the 85 1.8G over the 1.4D. The difference in image quality is leaps and bounds better.
Nikon,3bdu4d,evanrphoto,2,Mon Jun 29 02:55:11 2015 UTC,"I think an important part is asking, how small/lightweight do you want?  The Nikon 58mm, or 105 macro, or Sigma art 50 are all sharp, but I wouldn't exactly say they're small, and nothing like the Nikon 50 f/1.4.  As a general rule, usually 35 - 50 prime lenses tend to be smaller and light due to simplicity of their elements, but that's not always the way it goes.    I have the Nikon 50mm f/1.8D and 20mm f/2.8D lenses, and I really like the size for walking around with.  But, as with the new Sigma lenses, their added sharpness seems to come with added size and weight.    A few others that are somewhat compact: the Nikon 35 f/1.8 FX, Nikon 28mm f/1.8G, Sigma 85 f/1.4 EX HSM."
Nikon,3bdu4d,IllegibleLetters,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:33:25 2015 UTC,Feel like my heavier lenses are pretty good. Really enjoy shooting with them all. So really do want something lightweight -  hence why I didn't buy the Art lenses .... Need something that is an easier walking around lens.
Nikon,3bdu4d,pizza_tron,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:58:16 2015 UTC,Show us what you mean by super sharp. I don't have much experience with the 1.4 but own the 50 and the 85. Although I think I need to take my 85 in for repair. The focus has been slow and off at times.
Nikon,3bdu4d,ImS0hungry,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:32:27 2015 UTC,I have the Rokinon 85mm 1.4 for my D810. I use more then my 24-70.
Nikon,3bdu4d,loxodon_smiter,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:57:16 2015 UTC,I'm a little late to this conversation but here's what I've got to say! I've been using voigtlander primes for the last year and the sharpness is unparalleled for the price. The 58 1.4 is amazing!!!!!! They are CPU lenses but do not have a autofocusing motor
Nikon,3bdu4d,evanrphoto,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:51:41 2015 UTC,The Nikon 50mm 1.4G is not a particularly sharp or poppy lens. Check out the 85mm or 35mm 1.8 G. If you want a roughly 50mm lens with the best image quality you need to look at the 58mm 1.4G.
Nikon,3bdu4d,Meekois,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:56:53 2015 UTC,85mm1.8g is one of the sharpest nikkor primes around.

Nikon,3bdu4d,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"The 35mm? Have you done all the manual focus fine tuning checks?  Is the lack of sharpness definitely the glass? We're you using a glass filter, if so, have you checked it is absolutely aligned and neutral? How were the shots supported - what tripod? Was anything moving? If so, what shutter speeds? We're you using the lens VR setting (and have you tried it at each setting against standard patterns?) - I've had more VR or Optical Stabilisation motors die than I have ever had poorly focusing prime lenses :-) Have you done a series of sensor checks? Have you done a series of RAW images for resolution and sharpness image checks using standard patterns and colours? Are the image settings set for resolution and sharpness (if using camera jpg - they are a little ""soft"" unless you tweak sharpness) Is your monitor high enough resolution and fully Adobe RGB calibrated? What application were you viewing the shots in and was it at 100%  Have you created/downloaded effective RAW processing templates for the camera (it can take a LOT of boost to sharpness and the NR settings need care to keep all that fine detail)  That is about a days work that could save you $1000"
Nikon,3bdu4d,UnmixedGametes,3,Sun Jun 28 08:37:20 2015 UTC,"FYI I don't believe the Nikkor 50mm primes have any VR....  I simply did a side by side comparison ay same apertures,  with my F2.8 Tamron zoom at 50mm and found the latter to resolve better ..."
Nikon,3bcv73,MustangSense,5,Sun Jun 28 00:40:05 2015 UTC,Hey buddy as long as you're happy with your purchase and it's helping you get out there to do what you love then it's all good! I'm just disappointed Nikon hasn't released a 24-70 2.8 with VR yet.
Nikon,3bcv73,alandizzle,5,Sun Jun 28 02:14:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm happy with it. It's been a great walk around lens so far. VR is a great touch along with the d750's low light ability.
Nikon,3bcv73,benfires,4,Sun Jun 28 04:57:08 2015 UTC,"Admittedly the nikon 24-70 is pretty outdated. Unless you believe the rumors about the possible new trinity which is going to use Phase Fresnel (PF) glass...  That said, the tamron 24-70 is said to be excellent value for money. I wish that the Tokina 24-70 was already out in the market and maybe a sigma 24-70 ART so we could see a full spread test.  But yes. Bottom line is that if you're satisfied with the purchase at that price then it's perfectly fine. Not everyone uses a set focal length."
Nikon,3bcv73,benfires,2,Sun Jun 28 05:35:11 2015 UTC,I don't see the Tokina as a serious contender in that market. I am waiting for the Sigma however. I think think they will have something cool up their sleeve.
Nikon,3bcv73,benfires,2,Sun Jun 28 05:41:37 2015 UTC,"Looking at the current trend I wouldn't be totally surprised if they release a 24-70 f/2 or something along those lines. The front element size however would be massive.  They've already pretty much shook the lens market with the 120-300 f/2.8 and the crop sensor 18-35 f/1.8, so maybe the other big names will follow suit. Their respective 105mm and 72mm front elements are still huge but it's understandable why they need to be so large."
Nikon,3bcv73,Hades2k,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:55:26 2015 UTC,I read something a while back that the CEO commented on the full frame 24-70 f2 rumor and he basically said it's not going to happen. We can all dream though. I can't imagine how big and heavy that lens would have to be.
Nikon,3bcv73,sky1193,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:56:38 2015 UTC,"We all can hope, hahaha. Though we can all agree that sigma is getting their stuff together and raising the bar well beyond with some of their Art series lenses"
Nikon,3bccw2,stonewall072,3,Sat Jun 27 21:44:29 2015 UTC,"The 24-120mm is a pretty decent lens. But keep in mind that different lenses have different advantages and disadvantages.  If you like having a decent zoom range, the 24-120mm is good in that it gives you a 24mm that's useful for landscapes to a 120mm that's good for portraits. The lens has a bit of distortion to it at some focal lengths but if you use Lightroom or any other RAW processor that does lens corrections, that's fixed with a click of a button.  What lenses do/did you have for your DX? What lenses do you like shooting with? What were your biggest complaints with your DX kit that made you want to move to FX? These questions are going to help you figure out what you need.  Without your input I'm kind of stabbing in the dark. The 24-120mm is a $1,300 lens and with the current price break (which ends today by the way, unless they do a last minute extension) costs $700. That's a pretty good deal that I would probably jump at. If you don't like the lens you could probably sell it used for not a huge loss (don't think you'll sell it used for $1000, because the market will be flooded with people who thought that, but you'll probably be able to sell it for $500-600 and get most of your money back).   That's what I'd do. When I got my D800, that lens cost a ton so I got a $200 used 28-105mm, which was a good starter lens in addition to my 50mm. It's a bit clunkier, softer, and it doesn't have VR.  Down the road you may want an ultra wide like a 16-35mm f/4 VR for landscapes or maybe a Tokina 16-28mm."
Nikon,3bccw2,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Sat Jun 27 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"I have one and I think it is OK. It has a useful range, and image quality is fine. If you don't have a ton of FX stuff it'll get you going.   The consensus across various Nikon forums seems to be that it's an OK value at the kit price but not bought on its own, when it is much more expensive."
Nikon,3bccw2,StargateCommand,2,Sun Jun 28 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this... at $700 it is a pretty good deal. At $1300, not so much unless you really need that specific range (some people do)."
Nikon,3bccw2,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Sun Jun 28 00:36:24 2015 UTC,"I just got this combo as a first Nikon DSLR kit. I come from a canon background and am used to shooting only primes on my Leica. That said, I've been shooting with the 24-120 and it's really not bad. A nice walk around all purpose lens. The next two I get will be a 35 and 85 Prime as I photograph mostly people."
Nikon,3bccw2,Os_agnostic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:39:40 2015 UTC,"It's not a great lens, but it's not terrible. The f4 at all focal lengths is kinda nice.  I'd recommend getting prime lenses instead."
Nikon,3bccw2,thiscouldbeben,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"Its a very useful lens, with constant aperture which is nice in a zoom with such a wide range.  I know everyone here is going to scream 'all zooms suck just buy primes' - and its partially right. Primes will always be better, but this lens is a great compromise.  I've got a d750 and a ton of nice primes, but sometimes you just need a single lens, not to be lugging around a ton of lenses and changing them constantly. The 24-120 is great for those kinds of days.   Definitely worth it at kit price - but not at the full msrp if you buy it alone."
Nikon,3bccw2,jdanna,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"I have both a 24-70 and a 24-120.  I take the 24-120 when I want to travel one camera, one lens.  It's a very versatile focal length, and it's also the only VR lens I own in the 24-70 range."
Nikon,3bccw2,daggah,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:26:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't shot with it too much, but it seems to be a pretty good lens.  F/4 isn't huge, but it's a convenient range, reasonably sharp, and well built.  The downsides are that it does vignette a bit, and it's quite large/heavy for a kit lens.  As with everything, price is a consideration, and Nikon is doing a big discount when bought with the D750, so keep in mind that people comparing it to the 24-70 f/2.8 should factor in that while that lens is better, it's like $1,200 more (about $700 for the kit, versus $1900 for the 2.8).    I'd say, for the money, it's worth it, but if you really just do landscapes then maybe some sort of wide prime would make more sense, like the Nikon 20 or 28 f/1.8G or the new Sigma 24 art lens."
Nikon,3bccw2,IllegibleLetters,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:47:37 2015 UTC,Buy the body at the cheaper price and use those savings for something much better like a 70-200 F/4 VR for landscapes or 24-70 2.8 which even on my hiking ventures i find on my cam 90% of the time.
Nikon,3bccw2,SneakyNoob,-8,Sat Jun 27 22:19:51 2015 UTC,Don't do it. Kit lens like that are universally terrible. It's a total waste of money. Virtually all variable lenses (zooms) that span that big of a range (from wide to tele) are bad. You'd be much better suited by buying a 50mm f1.8.

Nikon,3bavs4,jacob_dlear,3,Sat Jun 27 13:28:11 2015 UTC,"The D3xxx series is essentially the same as the D5xxx series, the only difference being that the D5xxx has always has more bells and whistles, like slightly better video, slightly better ISO performance, slightly better resolution, slightly better everything – and a tilty screen!   But honestly, I would recommend the D3300 as you are saving money on the extra 50mm lens and not compromising quality. If you're just starting to learn, it is also a great tool to get started as it is a pretty nifty camera with strong capabilities. The D3200 (previous model) is one of my backups for work and it's fantastic.   Hope this help.  D3300 vs D5300 Detailed spec list"
Nikon,3bavs4,jdlt93,3,Sat Jun 27 14:28:10 2015 UTC,Isn't the sensor the same so image quality would be the same? They have the same resolution and iso performance. I thought the only thing the d5300 had over the 3300 is a tilt screen and a few software things like bracketing.

Nikon,3bavs4,jdlt93,2,Sat Jun 27 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"Generally the series goes like this IMO;  3xxx series; basic everything. If you're on a tight budget and/or you're just starting out, this is a great platform. You can pretty much do 70% of the higher end 7k series bodies  5xxx series; the 3k series plus some extra buttons and features, and overall better video. Otherwise pretty much the same, so consider if the benefits are worth the cost difference  7xxx series; top of the line crop sensor cameras, and a lot more bang for buck once the price lowers from launch RRP. A seasoned photographer is more likely to pick an older generation 7k body over a new(er) 5k or 3k body. Not to mention they're weather resistant and can drive older AF-D lenses. Not always ideal as a starting platform but many stop at the 7k series instead of jumping to full frame  Special mention for D90; consider this as the precursor to the D7000. It's a really bang for buck camera, but its features won't get you far at this day and age  Not gonna add in FX bodies, since it's not really the point for OP"

Nikon,3b9yz2,BoomTownOne,3,Sat Jun 27 05:02:00 2015 UTC,"Auto; fully camera controlled, all you get to decide is whether it's on auto or auto (No Flash). Either way you have zero control apart from focusing the lens if you are using autofocus.  Program (p mode); somewhat like automatic. You get to select ISO and flash/no flash, and the camera then picks ONE COMBINATION of aperture and shutter speed that gives correct exposure. Rotating the rear command dial near your right hand thumb will cycle through the various combinations that give correct exposure. In P Mode your camera will prioritise keeping the shutter speed to 1/x, where x is your focal length of the lens you've attached. Eg if you attach your kit 18-55mm and you zoom all the way to 55mm, the closest match is 1/60 of a second. The camera will try to keep the shutter at 1/60s or FASTER.  Manual (m Mode); fully manual control. All the camera does is suggest what it thinks is the correct exposure, but won't change any of your settings. Pressing down the shutter release will snap a photo regardless of what the camera metering thinks. If you look through your viewfinder and half-press the shutter button you should see a bar at the bottom with a + and - sign, and you need to try to align the bar at the middle. If it's on +, means it is overexposed, so increase shutter speed/decrease iso/use larger f-stop number. If it's - then it's the other way around. Note that this meter is OFFSET BY YOUR EXPOSURE COMPENSATION. Often your viewfinder will not indicate what the compensation is unless you manually check it. Another thing about M mode is that if you have your flash up, the flash will automatically adjust power settings (to its power limit) if the camera thinks the photo is underexposed. If the flash is up and the camera metering thinks it's spot on or overexposed, it will not fire. Keeping the built in flash down means the camera releases the shutter regardless of whether it is metered correctly or not.  Edit; on a side note, I should mention that M mode is not going to be easy on your d3000 series camera, due to the fact that you only have one control dial. Higher end bodies will have two, so you can rapidly change shutter speed and/or aperture without having to hold down a button and rotate the dial. By default your rear dial will control shutter speed.  I highly suggest you play in Aperture priority (a mode) first and mess with exposure compensation there. On single dial bodies like your camera, A mode makes the rear dial change aperture since the shutter speed is determined by the camera. You can read more about the iso/aperture/shutter speed relation on r/photography. (apologies if that isn't clickable, I'm on mobile and formatting is giving me issues) That said, getting out of P and auto modes will be the key step to improving your photos. P mode is debatable but to me, cycling through combinations is slow and tedious. And the fact that it resets every time your camera goes on standby to save battery....  Also edit for spelling."
Nikon,3b9yz2,benfires,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:13:22 2015 UTC,"Super interesting, thank you. So essentially the difference between AUTO and P is that P allows for manually setting ISO, right?  This really helped me understand aperture (which seems to be the main point of A priority mode): http://www.edverosky.net/blog/wp-content/dslr-guide/images/aperture-sequence-2.jpg"
Nikon,3b9yz2,benfires,2,Sat Jun 27 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"ISO control is the main difference between the two modes. Apart from that i believe you also get to select your autofocus mode, but this depends on the individual camera body.  Otherwise, P mode will work like auto mode, and rotating the command dial will cycle through other valid combinations. Technically it's still sort of auto in a sense, but at least lets you control your aperture and shutter speed to some extent."
Nikon,3b9yz2,KaJashey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:48:36 2015 UTC,Thanks. Looks like A priority mode is the most fun and useful to try out next :)
Nikon,3b9yz2,bradarb,2,Sun Jun 28 00:01:40 2015 UTC,"P mode lets you override quite a few things. In P-mode and above the flash fires if the flash is up and doesn't if it down. Just the position of the flash becomes a switch. In P-mode and above you can do exposure compensation, metering modes lots of other things. P-mode is sort of auto with lots of manual overrides."
Nikon,3b9yz2,Blrfl,2,Sun Jun 28 04:17:43 2015 UTC,I'm a total DSLR beginner and what confuses me is the difference between AUTO and P. Thanks
Nikon,3b9yz2,opticalminefield,7,Sat Jun 27 05:03:06 2015 UTC,"Not the greatest explanation but  here goes. A DSLR has 3 basic settings to produce the final result that is your picture. These are shutter speed, aperture and iso (the sensor's sensitivity to light) Pardon me if you already knew that but the different modes essential has different control over those 3 settings. In auto, the camera will take it's best guess with all 3, trying to create the most balanced picture. Its essentially making your DSLR a point and shoot, so most photographers use the other modes. The most popular being: (P)rogram, (S)hutter speed priority, (A)perature priority and manual. Most pro photographers shoot the majority of their pictures within these modes. A basic rundown of each mode: program mode let's you set standards that will remain the same, but adjust the other settings to get the level, even picture. I don't mess with it too much because for me its not worth the effort of changing the settings in each lighting and condition. Shutter speed priority is all based on how quickly you want your shutter to open and close, and the camera judges the iso and aperture for you. Aperture priority is the opposite, where you set the aperture and iso and the shutter speed is calculated. I use A for 80% of shots, call me crazy if you want. Manual, pretty simple, is just full control of everything. If someone from the film age came back to life today they would use manual mode, manual focus and a 50mm lens. I hope this is helpful to you, if not look up a book on how to use your camera. It sure helped me get right into shooting. Best of luck!"
Nikon,3b9yz2,totallyshould,2,Sat Jun 27 05:29:50 2015 UTC,"I'm from the film age.  Priority and program modes have existed since the 1970s.  Priority isn't really rocket science, it's just the camera mapping one setting (shutter speed or aperture) to center the needle in the light meter based on the other.  That's pretty much what you do in full manual."

For stars the wider aperture can help because even with a tripod, the earth is turning so if you shoot with too long of a shutter speed the stars will start to blur and a wider aperture can help.  The sigma 10-20 will be a little wider, but if that interests you, take a look at the Sigma 8-16mm f/4.5-5.6. the difference from 11mm to 8mm is going from ""ultra wide"" to what I call ""ludicrous wide"" which can give you a very unique perspective."

Nikon,3b3h2t,W00ster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:56:31 2015 UTC,Thanks!  That looks awesome. My next lens is either the 14-24 or the 24-70.
Nikon,3b3h2t,ApatheticAbsurdist,4,Thu Jun 25 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"What camera do you have? You just got a DX lens, assuming that means you have a DX body, I wouldn't recommend getting those particular lenses, particularly the 14-24mm, unless you have an FX camera. A Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 is better (wider angle on a DX camera and will let you use a filter), it's nearly as sharp, and it costs about 1/4 the price of the 14-24."

Nikon,3b3h2t,totallyseparate,5,Thu Jun 25 21:32:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't waste your money on FX lenses. Your next lens should not be the 14-24, and there are probably better options than the 24-70mm as well (17-50-ish lenses come to mind).

Nikon,3b5m11,sumguy720,9,Fri Jun 26 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. Most, if not all, FX bodies will default to shooting in DX mode (auto DX crop) if you put a DX lens on it, but you can disable that and you can manually tell the camera to shoot in FX or DX mode. So you can shoot in DX mode on an FX lens or FX mode on a DX lens.  Keep in mind that the edge of the image circle is typically not a hard line. Basically you'll get really bad vignetting and the corners will probably get very soft as they fade to black. The amount will vary from lens to lens and how much you zoom in if the lens is a zoom. The top and bottom of the frame probably won't be effected as much as the corners and sides that are closer to the edge of the image circle."
Nikon,3b5m11,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Fri Jun 26 04:35:49 2015 UTC,"Oh cool! That's awesome! Thanks for answering my question! I didn't consider the edge being soft instead of a hard line - but I guess that makes a lot of sense since all the light isn't going to be in focus.   I'm glad to know it's possible, though. I just could not find that info  anywhere. Thanks again."
Nikon,3b5m11,SPOOFE,3,Fri Jun 26 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"The ""softness"" of the edge of the image circle will be relative to aperture.  Take the 35mm f/1.8 DX, for instance. This lens is so close to covering full frame that it hurts. Wide open at f/1.8, it only shows very severe vignetting. Stop down to f/4 and you get significant black corners, and all the way down to f/16 it's a pretty distinct line.  The Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 is another that will cover FX at 15-16mm, 14mm if you clean up the resultant black corners."
Nikon,3b5m11,evertjm,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:00:10 2015 UTC,"i've used both those lenses on my d800.   To me, the 11-16 was usable at 16mm only.  cropped top and bottom for a panorama style and it was pretty good.   The 35 however was brilliant, i came so close to keeping it"
Nikon,3b5m11,SPOOFE,3,Fri Jun 26 07:26:10 2015 UTC,"I keep a DX camera as a secondary, so I have that impetus to keep 'em around. If someone were going straight full frame I certainly wouldn't recommend doing it, but if you have such lenses anyway it can be neat."
Nikon,3b5m11,evertjm,2,Fri Jun 26 07:28:26 2015 UTC,"yeah i sold my d7100, i don't shoot often enough to justify a backup body.   would have been handy for macro and wildlife but meh we all have to make sacrifices."
Nikon,3b5m11,therealvulrath,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:31:56 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to add that you can usually get ""full frame"" out of a DX lens at certain focal lengths.  I do that all the time with my Tamron 10-24mm on my D600.  I just wish there was a decent full-frame alternative to that thing that didn't cost an arm and a leg."
Nikon,3b5m11,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"Very true. On some lenses, particularly zooms, at certain focal lengths the lens will actually be very useable, but they don't want to sell it as an ""FX"" lens and have people complain you can't use it at 10mm  The best recommendation I could say would be to look at the Tokina 16-28mm f/2.8 ($630), Sigma 12-24mm f/4.5-5.6 (The newer version is pricier at $950, but there is an older version you might find significantly cheaper used),  Tokina 17-35mm f/4 ($450)"
Nikon,3b5m11,therealvulrath,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:25:47 2015 UTC,"I use the Tamron for interior work for real estate. I estimate that the lens I've got is best at 12-14mm, so I may just have to rent a 12-24mm FX and give it a go."
Nikon,3b5m11,Blrfl,0,Tue Jun 30 04:37:06 2015 UTC,FX bodies have a setting that disables automatic cropping when a DX lens is screwed on.  You're effectively shooting square.
Nikon,3b5m11,Blrfl,2,Fri Jun 26 04:16:03 2015 UTC,"So what's with the downvote?  On my 750, it's Image area -> Choose image area -> FX -> Auto DX Crop -> Off."

Nikon,3b4djm,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:17:06 2015 UTC,Is the loss of light on coarsely-ground focus screens rendered meaningless by using faster lenses?
Nikon,3b4djm,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:49:47 2015 UTC,"If you use only faster lenses. The caveat is if you don't only have f/1.4 lenses. If you have an f/1.4 lens and an f/4-5.6 lens and switch back and forth it becomes problematic.  Also keep in mind that when shooting with an f/1.4 lens, it might only open up to f/2.8 when focusing/framing. So it might not be better than an f/2.8 zoom.   Edit: As /u/r_golan_trevize states below, the view screen basically maxes out at an effective aperture, so an f/1.4 lens might not be any brighter than an f/2.8"
Nikon,3b4djm,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'll check, but there seems to be a noticeable difference in Live View.  I hate to say it, but Nikon needs to build a mirrorless."
Nikon,3b4djm,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"In live view it may open all the way. The reason why it might not open all the way when using the optical view finder is the PDAF sensors uses in DSLRs often are designed to perform best at specific apertures. The way to check is to set the aperture to wide open and hit the DOF preview button looking at the front of the lens and seeing if it opens up more or not.  I just checked on my D800, it doesn't change, so it's at f/1.4 when I have the lens set to f/1.4 but I have noticed that issue in the past on other cameras (I forget what but I'm guessing back when I was shooting with Minolta film cameras.)  see response below"
Nikon,3b4djm,rieramaxime,2,Thu Jun 25 23:23:39 2015 UTC,"When shooting through the viewfinder the aperture is always  opened all the way up until the photo is taken, at which time it stops down to the shooting aperture. You can see this by looking through the front of the lens, especially a fast D or manual lens where you can turn the ring and really see it open up. The viewfinder screen surface has its own effective aperture which can't see any light wider than about f/2.8 or so, I think, which is why the DOF preview doesn't change below that.  The PDAF only sees light from the f/5.6 circle and doesn't really see anything wider than that and goes blind above that (a few points now can still see at f/8)  - it doesn't care what the aperture is as long as the maximum is f/5.6 or wider. Faster lenses don't really focus better because they're faster lenses as is commonly believed, it's because they generally have better and faster AF systems. Cheap fast lenses don't necessarily focus better in poor light, like, my 35/1.8 DX and 50/1.4 D don't focus as surely in dim light as my 24-70/2.8, 70-200/4 or even the 70-300/4.5-5.6 at 300mm.  If you've never seen this, everything you'd ever want to know about PDAF:  http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3713509#forum-post-54211961  (it's a long read with a few sidetracks - not bad compared to the trainwreck most dpr threads turn into once they go past one page - but there is a ton of good and interesting info in there with diagrams and pictures breaking it all down)"

Nikon,3b1hnu,r_golan_trevize,3,Thu Jun 25 15:16:41 2015 UTC,"The 70-300 VR is a pretty decent lens - it focuses pretty fast and while it's not super sharp at 300mm, especially wide open, it's mitigated a little on FX since that softness is shrunk down compared to on a DX camera where it's magnified.  The 70-200 focuses even faster, like, noticeably faster and the 70-300 is no slouch. And it's sharper. I did a little testing between the two and I don't think you lose much cropping the 70-200/4 down compared to shooting the 70-300 at 300mm wide open. The 70-200 also handles better - the ring placements are better and they feel better as you turn them. The VR is better too. It's better all around except that it doesn't go all the way out to 300mm. Of course it costs twice as much too but you would expect it to be better at that price.  You probably won't see a huge difference in image quality unless you need the extra stop (or really two since you need to stop the 70-300 down at the long end) of light and you're shooting still subjects on a tripod with all the best practices or you're shooting moving subjects fast enough where that extra little bit of AF speed lets you track just a bit better."

Nikon,3b1hnu,fishinginbangkok,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"Well sure, you'd gain image quality and more light (f/2.8), but you'd lose 100mm on the long end. Since you didn't mention what you actually use your camera for, only you can decide what is more important."
Nikon,3b1hnu,tripler6,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:12:15 2015 UTC,you probably get better autofocus with the quality lenses too.  I'd get the 70-200 f4 VR.

That's a super easy choice. The extra 100mm doesn't even come into play because past 200 on that lens is way too soft for me.  A not so easy choice is between the Tamron and the Nikon VR1.

Nikon,3aqlfl,aykontakt,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"Good on you. I waited for my first DSLR for years because they weren't any good. My first DSLR was Nikon D100. I got it in late 2002. It was bad by today's standards, especially the dynamic range sucked. You could forget about shooting in direct sunlight. I shot mostly in a studio so I could control the lighting. I hated dipped photography with passion and never looked back at film cameras. Today I use the D800 and it's fantastic. Too many pixels for most uses but I shoot black and white art nudes, the final product is large prints and what the thing can do is amazing. I use top of the line prime lenses, the Nikkor 85mm f1.4 most of the time.   Did you research the kit lenses? I'm sure they are fine for computer screen work. Also on the wide angle side, I find that I never used the lenses as much as I thought I would. Although the D3300 is a DX sensor so 18mm is not that wide. The 200mm is going to be pretty sweet on that sensor for wildlife if that's your thing.   I hope you enjoy. Show some pictures."

Nikon,3aqlfl,blitzangel,4,Tue Jun 23 09:40:22 2015 UTC,A backup battery is worth having especially when travelling.  Great choice; the 35mm lens will definitely be a great compliment to the kit!
Nikon,3aqlfl,MughalPrince22,2,Mon Jun 22 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same thing I got and I love it, especially the 35. You might want to get some sort of decent tripod, whether it be a full sized or a mini like the gorilla pod. I also picked up a set of nd filters as well as lens hoods and clear filters cause I walk around with my lenses a lot and I didn't want them getting banged up. Try adobe light room, and I also borrowed an ebook of nikon d3300 for dummies book from the library and it helped me a lot starting out."

Nikon,3aqlfl,IllegibleLetters,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"Most tripods are, sadly, not up to the task of one-minute exposures. All lenses get sharper and increase their depth of field by reducing the aperture for light to get in, and the ~3.5-5.6 kit lens is going to be something like f/8 before you get the best out of it. Add even more light loss from a circular polarizer and shoot at ISO100 (which makes a huge difference on cheap cameras), and a $200 tripod will make ore of a difference than a $2000 lens."

I understand that not everyone lives near a store that has a selection of cameras and lenses, but if you do then give them a call first.  My store sells only official US products, fully warrantied, and at the same price as the big box stores and official Nikon dealers on amazon.    Okay, that said, I like the D3300 a lot, that package is a good deal, and the 35mm f/1.8 is a popular prime lens.  I personally am partial to the 50mm f/1.8, for basically the same money, but if you can then try them both.  I like that the 50 is tighter, and seems to be a little sharper and better bokeh, but the 35 would work better for walking around and getting group shots.   Enjoy!  People seem to be 50/50 about if the wi-fi is easy to use, or frustrating, but nice that Nikon is including it for free on that camera."

They're nice to have but an older version or standalone version lacking a few updates still has a TON to offer.  LR is EASILY the best 100$ or so you could spend to improve your photos immediatly.

There's a menu item for HDMI on the settings (wrench) menu with several options under it - check in there and make sure somethings not set goofy there.   Are you in liveview for stills or movie mode? Could it be a conflict between the resolution & FPS you're shooting at and what the monitor can handle? The camera may be negotiating a resolution successfully with the monitor in playback but you may be forcing it to use a resolution/FPS it can't handle in movie mode."

Both great lenses with vibration reduction, they're small and light. The camera is solid but light, easy to learn on, and has all the features for you to grow into, not to mention it takes great high res photos, even at night. I also picked up a 200$ 35mm prime lens from amazon, this is cause it offers the highest image quality for price, shoots better indoors or in low light, is light, and it makes you zoom with your feet so teaches you good habits. Lots of people who shoot nikon love this lens and many including me have this normally on their camera, but I still like being able to use the other two when the need arises. With the remaining 200 I picked up a mini tripod, several filters, extra battery, more comfortable strap, cleaning kit, etc and came out having every single thing I could need for under one grand, a price many pay for just one body and lens."
Nikon,3ako60,MughalPrince22,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:18:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great advice. But is the 3300 bundle much much better than a 3200 bundle? And will vr make a really big difference? Thanks again.
Nikon,3ako60,Professor_Beanbones,3,Sun Jun 21 13:16:54 2015 UTC,The differences are only minor. Vr allows you to use a tripod less and helps you get better in-door people photos when the lighting is poorer and you don't want to use a tripod.
Nikon,3ako60,MughalPrince22,2,Sun Jun 21 14:51:25 2015 UTC,"The VR does make a difference, especially on the telephoto lens. Since the kit lenses don't open very wide,  being able to slow down the shutter is real nice in any indoor or lowlight situation. With the body the 3300 isn't all that better than the 3200, and the only difference between the VRII lenses and the VR lens is that the VRII lenses retract into a small shape and the VR lenses don't.

Nikon,3ak8hl,nk213u,4,Sun Jun 21 00:39:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you think you might want to shoot.  Landscapes? Action? Interiors?   Primes are always nice, but if you're not quite sure what your focus will be, and want to be able to play around with various focal lengths get the zoom.   And look around for decent, cheap used lenses if you're looking for a prime. KEH.com is a place that I've used in the past, and have had outstanding results."
Nikon,3ak8hl,Buckeye70,3,Sun Jun 21 01:37:56 2015 UTC,"I bought the D3300 with both kit lenses, the 18-55 and the 55-200 VRII. I also got the prime. Reason being is the kit lenses are a good bargain for the price, and having  a wide and Tele that are light, cheap, compact, and have image stabilization cannot be a bad thing. I normally use the prime, but sometimes when I need a wide or Tele it's nice that I can just go into my jacket pocket and pull one out. Also, the VR is real nice for videos."
Nikon,3ak8hl,MughalPrince22,3,Sun Jun 21 02:24:27 2015 UTC,"The kit lens is actually very nice. The VR works well enough, and so you can get some fairly slow shutter speeds handheld, especially at the wide end. Most photographic situations can be handled with a 35mm on DX, though some scenes are just begging for what you can do with a wide angle. 18mm is starting to get there, which is why I'd tell you to keep the kit lens."
Nikon,3ak8hl,totallyshould,2,Sun Jun 21 05:15:14 2015 UTC,Start with a kit lens but make sure you add a prime at some point as they get the very most out of your camera. A 35mm 1.8 if your going nikon.
Nikon,3ak8hl,alexthecheese,2,Sun Jun 21 06:34:03 2015 UTC,"Where are you finding a D3300 as a body only? Nikon doesn't offer its entry level bodies (D40/60/3x00) as a body only, even refurbed, so the only way to get it that way is if someone is breaking the kit apart and selling pieces separately. That's usually the sign of a less than reputable dealer.   Anyway, given a choice I'd still recommend getting it with the 18-55 kit lens as it's too convenient a lens to not have. It's plenty sharp, covers a very useful focal range, is light and compact, focuses very closely, has VR, and it's very inexpensive. The only things it doesn't do well is focus really fast and have a really big aperture (and maybe double as a 5lbs sledge) - things you will pay a lot for and/or give up other features to get.  Get the 35/1.8 DX too if you can though - you will find its large aperture is very useful for indoor events like parties and holiday get togethers where the kit lens may struggle to maintain fast enough shutter speeds to keep motion blur away."
Nikon,3ak8hl,r_golan_trevize,2,Sun Jun 21 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"I would personally go with the prime, especially if you don't need that zoom. Primes teach you how to compose better, be more creative as you have to zoom with your feet instead of your hands. The 35mm is a great all around camera on an APS-C camera.  My first lens was a 35mm and I opted for the body only camera on my K5. I then got another zoom lens, a Sigma 17-50 f/2.8 which is good for wide end and a short telephoto for portraits. I may also get an 18-135mm WR since it's weather resistant for tough conditions and versatile. I might even get the kit lens 18-55 WR for the sake of WR for when I'm shooting outside even though 35mm, 17-50, 18-55 is extremely redundant. I can get the 18-55 or only $50 used while the 18-135 is about $300. Sigma 17-50 f/2.8 is about $500.   Go with the prime. You'll get more out of your camera and realize it's full limitations. The kit lens will limit your camera's full abilities. Just don't shoot wide open on the prime all the time, stop down a little sometimes."

It does no such thing - it makes the beginner frustrated because they can never get the image the way they want it.    Primes are fine when you have complete control over what you are taking pictures of. The moment it is not stationary, you are screwed. Outdoors, primes are in general a waste of money and will result in crappy photography for most people.    Have you tried to take pictures of squirrels, butterflies etc with a prime? Not to mention a wide prime like a 35mm? How about birds? Moving cars, boats etc?"

Nikon,3ak8hl,Moonkill1023,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"If the kit lens is a ""VR"" version, it's not a terribly bad deal. The kit lenses are jack-of-all-trades lenses. They give you a little bit of everything but they don't do any one thing very well. This can be good when starting out if you're aware of the limitations.   It can let you experiment with zoom to see if you like wider angle or more telephoto angle. It lets you vary the aperture to play with depth of field. It focuses more closely than a prime lens so you can play with not-quite macro work (shooting flowers and other close up objects).  Reality is if you stick with it, and get serious, you'll move on past the kit lens, but having the kit is good because the best way to know what lens you should get is by knowing where you're frustrated with your current lens. Maybe you'll wish you had a wider aperture and you like 35mm, so maybe you should get the 35mm f/1.8. But maybe you find yourself more frustrated wishing the lens would go wider than 18mm, in that case you should look for an ultra wide lens.  Either way you'll be happy so I wouldn't stress over the choice.   If you do get the zoom, the one thing you have to fight is the habit to see something and just zoom in to take the shot from where you're standing. Getting closer or farther from the subject creates a different perspective that just zooming in or out doesn't mimic. So I give my students an assignment with zoom: if you see something you want to photograph, zoom your lens in all the way and move to get a good shot with the lens zoomed in all the way, then zoom the lens out wide and move yourself to get a shot that looks good with the lens zoomed out... but you got to move your feet."
Nikon,3ak8hl,ApatheticAbsurdist,0,Fri Jun 26 04:44:21 2015 UTC,I'd go for the prime but such a fast lens is going to ruin all others for you (in a good way). I've used a selection of fast primes for years and it's done me well - but it's also meant I never really bothered with strobes as they always perform so well in low light. The bokeh when wide open is lovely...  Edit: also when I do put on a zoom I keep forgetting and still move about like a numptie
Nikon,3ak8hl,VioletApple,3,Sun Jun 21 00:55:01 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about primes is that it forces you to really thing about framing and properly composing your shot by moving around, while zoom lenses can really make you lazy about framing.

Nikon,3ajhc2,arpi75,5,Sat Jun 20 20:13:58 2015 UTC,"Indeed it does look used to me as well, I couldn't care less about the M/A text being rubbed of - that happens sooner or later when you use the lens; but the scratch is unacceptable for a new product (wholesale or not). You could try to register the lens with nikon (http://www.nikonusa.com/register/) and see if that pops up a warning that the serial number is already registered to another person, which would give clear evidence that it is a used piece of gear. The wording of your RMA email sounds strange to me, why would it be final if they send you a replacement? What if that lens is even worst, should you just be happy with it and leave them alone? I don't think so, if they insists on those terms I would return it, get a full refund and buy from a reputable source - honestly $50 isn't that much for not to have to deal with stuff like this..."

Nikon,3agqp5,kyleclements,2,Sat Jun 20 05:02:12 2015 UTC,"Keh.com has a reputation for being a very reputible online seller of used camera goods.  From my experience, their rating system is one notch better than anywhere else.  Their ""excellent"" is what any other place would label ""like new"", and their ""bargain"" is what anywhere else would call ""good"" or ""excellent"".  Most of the photographers I know have had good experiences with them.  All the local places sell perfectly decent used gear, too, but they either want too much for it, or aren't being perfectly honest about the lens's condition.  I've never been screwed buying used, and I've bought 6 used lenses (each time from a different seller).  Only two in my entire lens collection were purchased new.    The worst used lens I picked up had been to burning man and back, but the seller warned me that it was full of electrically conductive dust and probably wouldn't work for long  (the price was reduced accordingly).  It still works just fine, but the zoom ring feels a bit grindy."
Nikon,3agqp5,geekygeekz,2,Sat Jun 20 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've bought my share of second and third hand lenses. Most lens sold on eBay are by reputable sellers with thousands of positive feedback, and they also usually have return policies.   In person might be less risky but it really depends. This one guy bought a Pentax lens off Craigslist. He inspected in person, put it on his camera and it worked fine. Over the next few months, a bunch of mold started appearing. It was apparently dropped into a lake a few months back and the mold started growing."

Nikon,3ah4jw,SneakyNoob,2,Sat Jun 20 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"You might not need a new sensor, if you take a look here: http://guide-images.ifixit.net/igi/XRu3PELglKpWsdSc.huge the glas and the filter elements are not bonded to the sensor like claimed in the early days of the D600/D610. On the other hand, if Nikon is still stubborn in their service policy to not replace individual parts of the sensor unit you are, unfortunately, looking at around 700.00$ for a full replacement - time will depend on how much the service has to do, usually the range is anywhere from 2 to 10 workdays. Another option is to send your camera to a third party repair service like: http://www.lifepixel.com/shop/scratched-sensor-repair/scratched-sensor-repair (just found them by a quick google search, no affiliation or experience)"

Nikon,3afk48,TheFreneticist,3,Fri Jun 19 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"I'd say a de-centred lens is the most obvious explanation. I don't own a 70-200 VRII, but to me it looks like there are some atypical aberrations in the left side of the image too (roof of the left tower), and the bokeh away from centre frame is not as pleasing as I've come to expect from that lens. Assuming you were square to the building (certainly looks like it), the only other explanation I can come up with would be some kinda weird artifact from the VR playing up. Time for some Nikon service..?"
Nikon,3afk48,Bergerac82,2,Fri Jun 19 20:39:49 2015 UTC,I also agree. I own a 70-200 VRII and I have never had this issue.  Have you tried turning VR off and doing manual focus to isolate the problem?
Nikon,3afk48,randombullet,2,Fri Jun 19 23:30:14 2015 UTC,"Yup, sadly I also have to agree with the theory of a de-centred element.  When you hand it in to Nikon Support try to explain what you have found yourself and tell them to give you a throughout evaluation of what needs to be done - typically they proclaim every lens they get as having ""fall damage"" without any inspection..."

Nikon,3af05i,dope_zebra,2,Fri Jun 19 16:19:14 2015 UTC,There are many decent wide angle lenses for Nikon APS-C cameras.  Just be sure to get one with a built-in AF system - your D60 doesn't have the motor to drive AF in lenses without one.  Never used the 11-16mm but it is very well regarded and possibly the only f2.8 constant zoom ultra wide available for aps-c.  The Tokina 12-24mm f/4 is also a good lens - I've owned before and was very happy with it.  Also the Nikon 12-24mm and 10-24mm are excellent - you can find decent deals for used copies on KEH or ebay.
Nikon,3af05i,dread_pirate_ryan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:37:05 2015 UTC,Did you have major distortion problems with the Tokina you used? I've also read some reviews that mention lens flare but I'm not sure how much credence to put in them.
Nikon,3af05i,dread_pirate_ryan,2,Fri Jun 19 17:33:39 2015 UTC,"What kind of distortion do you mean? It had the typical rectilinear 'stretching' distortion common to all ultra wides.  Don't recall having any issues with barrel/pincushion distortion that I couldn't easily fix in pp.  Also don't recall having flare issues, but I don't typically get too bothered by it anyway.  FYI, there are 2 versions of the Tokina 12-24mm - the newer one has the built-in AF motor, which would be the one you want.  There's also a newer 12-28mm which would also work for you, but I have no experience with that model."
Nikon,3af05i,blitzangel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:43:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! The rectilinear distortion is I think what I am worried about. Wasn't sure if I was going to end up with a fish-eye type effect on everything.
Nikon,3af05i,Tridawgn,2,Fri Jun 19 17:49:08 2015 UTC,"The Tokina would certainly be a great wide zoom lens for landscapes.  For wildlife, however, typically you would want a telephoto lens, like the relatively inexpensive 70-300mm."

I was interested in the 58 1.4 and 85 1.4, the latter for its stellar performance, but chose this for the wide angle :D"
Nikon,3ad34i,kyleclements,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:46:42 2015 UTC,"If you are really serious about bokeh, both the 58mm and the 85mm 1.4's are magical.  I went with the 85mm 1.8 because it's 1/3rd the price, and only 2/3rd of a stop slower.  Still more than good enough for my needs.  I shoot wide more than I shoot tele, so I'd rather put the money into the wide-angle lenses.    You should post an album in this thread somewhere to show us the results!"
Nikon,3ad34i,albinoyoungn,2,Sat Jun 20 21:00:15 2015 UTC,Spensive Glass!  I'd like to see how that matches up with the sigma art series.
Nikon,3ad34i,kyleclements,-1,Fri Jun 19 04:21:48 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering the same thing, the Sigma 35mm 1.4 has the highest DxO score on a D810 I think..  But then again, there's just something about owning original Nikon glass."
Nikon,3ad34i,albinoyoungn,2,Fri Jun 19 12:20:19 2015 UTC,"I know what your saying about owning Nikon glass.  All of my lenses are Nikon Brand.  BUT!  If the sigma can have equal or better IQ at half the price, what is that saying about Nikon and their markups :/.  $2,000 for a prime that isn't any better than a $1,000 is tough to think about."
Nikon,3ad34i,ShutterLeaf,2,Fri Jun 19 15:28:53 2015 UTC,"It's not just about image quality, it's also about mechanical durability and resale value.  Genuine Nikon lenses (and genuine Canon lenses, and any of the other big name 1st party lenses) generally holds about 80% of it's value on the used market.  3rd party lenses, on the other hand, depreciate quite a bit, often going for less than half?  Would you rather spend $2000 on a Nikkor, then sell it for $1600 years later, or spend $1500 on a 3rd party lens, and maybe sell it for $800?  Build quality is iffy.  I have a lot of Tokina glass, because they are built like tanks.  Tokina still makes lenses as solid as Nikon used to make them in the 90's. But other brands can have a lot more plastic."
Nikon,3ad34i,Mrbigmofoe,2,Sat Jun 20 21:06:16 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, however, the market is changing.  Nikon and canon glass hold their value because they are generally good lenses.  (I'm talking about the pro level glass, not the consumer stuff).  Sigma, Tamron and Tokina have been releasing some really good lenses over the past few years and I think that dynamic is changing steadily.  Before, 3rd party lenses were built terribly and the IQ was rough compared to their name brand counterparts.  Now that the 3rd party manufacturers can meet, and in many cases beat, the IQ and build quality, of name brand lenses, the resale value of the 3rd party glass will continue to rise.  Even in your example, the 3rd party lens is only reselling for $200 less than a full Nikon lens, which only equates to a 15% additional loss on the full value of the lens when compared to the name brand lens.  I keep my lenses for years (usually don't turn them around all that often 5-8 years in average) and losing another $200 on resale, but saving $500 on the initial purchase, isn't that hard of a comparison to make.  Sigma ART and Tamrons latest lenses are built really well.  All companies are using lots of plastic now, unless you are talking Ziess obviously.  The build quality argument doesn't hold all that much water IMO with this new field of lenses."
Nikon,3ad34i,ShutterLeaf,2,Sat Jun 20 21:19:28 2015 UTC,"These are all excellent points.  I am very interested in seeing how the used market reacts to the rapid improvements the 3rd parties have been introducing, and I imagine (and hope) that in several years, my above comment will be completely wrong.  The difference in resale value isn't that big (and is shrinking) but if you change how you think about buying and selling lenses, and imagine it as a long term rental, the scenario changes a bit:  Ask yourself:   ""would I rather rent a Nikon lens for x years for $400"" (plus low risk of no offers to buy it down the road)  or   ""would I rather rent a Tamron for $600 for x years"" (plus a moderate risk of no offers to buy it down the road.)?  Despite the changing tides, a lot of photographers don't chase DxO Mark, don't obsess over specs, and are rather conservative when it comes to trusting other brands.   A common sentiment is, ""On my $10,000 trip to Antarctica, i'm not going to risk losing all my shots on a cheaper lens...I'm buying [name brand]"""
Nikon,3ad34i,captain_poptart,2,Sat Jun 20 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"CRAP!  I can't afford that $10,000 drop to Antarctica because I bought all of this expensive name brand glass :p"

Would you suggest that I return this 24 1.4 and get one of the trinity lenses?  I'm thinking of getting the 14-24.  or, i might just keep this and get both.. Thoughts?"

Nikon,3ad34i,Hades2k,2,Fri Jun 19 12:54:25 2015 UTC,"Lots of overlap since all of them go to 24mm.  In my experience with the 14-24mm, it isn't as useful as the 24-70mm since the wide part of the range is VERY wide.  On a FF body, 24mm is already really good.  14-24mm is HEAVY, and the lack of filter threading is a bit of a letdown.  Focus is slow as well since the glass is ridiculously huge on the front.    It would depend on what you are shooting.  Doing street photography, keeping the 24mm prime is my suggestion since it's far less obtrusive than the others for the subjects.    On another side note.  It has been rumored that a new version of the 24-70mm VR 3 that was teased at Photokina last year.  I'll try to find the article.  That being said, it might be beneficial to wait a bit in the 24-70mm until the new one comes out.    A used 14-24mm can be hand for around $1100, so consider that."
Nikon,3ad34i,kyleclements,0,Fri Jun 19 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"14-24mm is HEAVY   1 Kg - I do not find it heavy at all. I can walk around with it for hours, the 70-200mm f/2.8 is a beast but even that one is not too bad to walk around with unless you are pipsqueak!"
Nikon,3a961y,demideity,21,Thu Jun 18 05:35:43 2015 UTC,"The price point is good for what you get. The low light ability is some of the best ever seen in a camera, period. It is full frame. It received the highest review score ever on dpreview. Wedding and street photographers love it, probably because of the low light and its light with quick auto-focus. It also has some new features like wifi and a screen that can move, that people might be into. Also, it has really good video features on it.   To sum it up, it does everything right. It might not be the best camera in the world at one specific thing, but it does everything right, in a light package, for a good price, and it has been well received.

Absolutely.   Yeah, a decent point-and-shoot will have less noise in low light than a $10,000 Medium Format. Medium format backs (with the exception of the CMOS ones that just came out in the past year and cost $30,000) are noisy as hell at 400ISO.  If you take your time and control things, you can get some amazing shots with an iPhone. Apple uses it as a selling point.

I'd bet I could get some decent shots with an entry level DSLR at an indoors sports game. Yes it has challenges but nothing new. Autofocus sucks? People used to shoot sports without autofocus. Aperture is too small? The ISO performance of an entry level DSLR is several stops better than film ever was (and if you have access strobes in the ceiling the point is moot). Can't zoom in that much? It's basketball, get close.   Would you get laughed at if you showed up to a wedding shooting with a point and shoot? YEAH.   Yes, but a couple will feel comfortable with someone with an entry level DSLR, even if they just got it for christmas and started calling themselves a wedding photographer. And I'd probably be able to take better shots with my LX-5 than they can.  Shooting night architecture/cityscapes. If one person figures it's dark and they need a camera that is good in low light and gets a D4s and starts shooting at 512,000 ISO. Then someone else comes along with a $300 point-and-shoot and a tripod, and shoots at 80 ISO with long exposures, it's quite possible the point-and-shoot will look better.  It's not about having BETTER equipment. It's about having the RIGHT equipment. It's not about having a better chefs knife. It's about having a paring knife when you need one and a cleaver when you need that. You can buy a $10,000 microwave.

Nikon,3a961y,SnackingRaccoon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"The D750 is the right middle-of-the-road for most people. It's not that the camera takes better pictures, but it's the right mix of controls and feature and price.   The reality is there is no ""best"" as different cameras will be better for somethings and worse for others. The D750 is a decent camera that is ""good enough"" to ""very good"" in most categories and it doesn't cost $6000.  Of the cameras you list, each of them have different advantages (and disadvantages).  D810: High resolution, higher max shutter speed for shooting in bright light, a more ""professional"" button layout with more buttons for direct control. Downside: Price, lower fps, heavier.  D610: Price. Downside: AF not as good for tracking fast moving subjects, a few less video options  D4s: Much higher FPS, better in low light (dynamic range and color rendering is much better at high ISO, most specs and measurements only focus on noise) More professional layout with more buttons and vertical grip, longer battery life. Downsides: Bigger, heavier, costs a TON more.  Df: this is an odd one because the control layout is quite different so it draws a very niche audiences. It also does not do any video. However like the D4s, it is better in low light.  D3: You're comparing a several year old camera. It will have faster FPS, but it doesn't have the resolution or low light performance of the D750.  I have a D800. I love it to death. But I do a lot of things (actually, mostly just shooting artwork) where the higher resolution is useful. However for most people that higher resolution isn't needed and just means my files are quite a bit larger than files off of a D750. I've also been shooting for a few decades and I'm a bit picky about the control layout of a camera and I like the way the D800 is laid out... that is good for me, but not for everyone. When people ask for a full frame Nikon, I first make sure they actually want a full frame (the D7200 is VERY VERY good and it and lenses for it are a hell of a lot cheaper, so getting a D7200 and a few nice lenses is often better than getting a D750 and one cheap lens) then I tend to point them towards the D750 as it's a middle-of-the-road camera unless they have specific needs that point them in another direction.  All that said... all of these cameras you don't get because they take good pictures. They have interchangeable lenses so you can choose the lens that gives you the capabilities you need. They have tons of controls that allow you to quickly change settings, but you need to know what settings they are. If you got these cameras with just a cheap lens and put it in auto, you probably won't notice much difference between this and a nice point-and-shoot camera."

Nikon,3a961y,ShutterLeaf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:52:21 2015 UTC,"Stats? Which stats?  I picked the D750 for a number of reasons. The excellent sensor is one (which you might put under the category of 'stats'), though I'm not going to act like it's really any better than the excellent D610 sensor. The jpg processing is a touch better, but if you shoot RAW that's a moot point.  The low-light autofocus, and autofocus in general was a huge selling point for me. For the sorts of available light work that I so often do, the autofocus is a night and day difference compared to the D610 or DF. Compared to the D3 that I tried, I think it surpasses it for my use. I haven't tested its ability to track fast things in a sports environment, but it seems to acquire focus quite quickly. It also does a good job of locking onto an object in 3d tracking mode.  Another intangible that the D750 has for me is the grip. It feels good in my hand, and like a much better camera than the D610. It's not as good as the D3/D4, and I'd need some more time with a D810 before I could decide if I like it as much as the D750.  The flip screen is another cool benefit that all the other cameras lack. It comes in handy for setting up and reviewing tripod shots, or getting unique angles that would have otherwise been a spray-n-pray.  I was surprised at it, but i have used the built-in WiFi a lot, too. I use it when I am out in the field to quickly post a teaser shot to Instagram and Facebook with far higher quality than the folks on the scene with camera phones could hope for.  Overall, it just feels like the right balance. I would have loved a D810 body with a 24mp sensor (or lower resolution if the low light capability was better) because the controls seem that much better, but as it is I was happy to save the money."
Nikon,3a961y,totallyshould,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:10:26 2015 UTC,"It's just such an all round great camera.   Great resolution, but not too much (D810 has more, which makes it a little bit more of a niche product)  The best auto-focus system from nikon. (D610 has an out-dated system borrowed from the D7000, D4s and D810 have similar systems but the D750's is tweaked a bit to perform better in low light)  Great balance of resolution and low light capabilities (superior to the D810 iso-wise, a little worse than a D4s or Df, but has more resolution than those 2)  Compact body for a full frame DSLR, improved grip from the D610. (You might not prefer it's grip, it's my personnal opinion)  Basically, they took successful items from their other cameras, made some positive changes and put it together to make an all-round beast of a camera.  Obviously, you should not necessarily buy this camera, it may not be for you. Maybe a crop sensor is best suited for you, maybe you need the resolution of a D810, maybe you need the speed of a D3/D4... But for me, I needed a great all around camera that performs well in low light but with enough resolution to have room for cropping and a responsive AF system at an affordable price, and that's why I chose the D750. I couldn't be happier that I did."

Nikon,3a6wdb,z00miev00m,10,Wed Jun 17 18:23:02 2015 UTC,"Short venison; no.  Long version; Nikon dslr lenses use the nikon F-mount, which has lenses that are designed for full frame (1x crop factor) or aps-c (1.5x crop factor) sensors. If you look up crop factor, you'll understand that the crop factor DX lens does not require as much glass because it covers a smaller image size.  Now, the nikon 1 lenses use the nikon 1 mount (or more accurately the nikon cx mount), whose crop factor is 2.7x. That is ridiculously tiny compared to dslr sensors, and as a result their lenses are really small and compact.  Because of the difference in the size of usable glass on the lens, you cannot adapt the nikon 1 lenses onto dslr systems unless you're ready for probably some extreme vignetting (black corners). Even then, I've never seen a nikon 1 to nikon f adapter.  However if it were the other way round then yes it's entirely possible. In fact, you could get theoretically ridiculous results because of the 2.7x crop factor. For example, mounting a 70-200 f/2.8 lens yields an effective 196 to 540mm f/2.8 zoom. A cheap nifty fifty 1.8 becomes a 135mm f/1.8 prime. Actual compatibility of lenses with the nikon f to nikon 1 adapter may vary.  Edit: version not venison. Clearly my phone gets hungry."

Sony did it because their lens lineup didn't have any real OIS, so the move for them was pretty straight forward.    Nikon would have to commit to built-In OIS on basically their entire line of FF cameras for that move to make sense..  4k would be a totally separate camera like how Canon did it with their 1D series.  I don't see them trying to complete with the entry level cinematography market honestly.  Canon has that on lock down."

It's still a new market for dslr it's not late for nikon even if they did make a special D5c or something I think it would sell."

Nikon,39wimw,leeunleashed,4,Mon Jun 15 21:40:45 2015 UTC,A 20%+ price hike isn't going to fly with the people who buy the single-digit bodies in bulk (think Associated Press and Sports Illustrated).  That's who dictates the feature set in those bodies.
Nikon,39wimw,Blrfl,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:51:51 2015 UTC,"Yes I understand that, but having this feature could increase the percentage of sharp images and that's worth alot and I believe that  some pentax dslr have that feature."
Nikon,39wimw,leeunleashed,4,Tue Jun 16 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"ALSO, internal stabilization is not going to be a thing on SLR cameras.  The sensor has to move too much for it to be feasible with a mirror, so until Nikon makes a Mirrorless pro body, it ain't happening.  They will do in-camera stabilization on the Nikon 1 series long before they do it to the pro-line of bodies."
Nikon,39wimw,albinoyoungn,3,Tue Jun 16 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"Canon is servicing the low end cinematography market by the 1Dc and the C line of camera (they use the same sensors essentially).  Pretty much anyone looking at cameras in that market are going to have lens kits that work with Canon bodies already.  I agree that there is room in the market for Nikon if they want to be there.  HOWEVER, there was room in the market 3 years ago when 4k was in its infancy.  Nikon hasn't done ANYTHING with this market up to now.  Arguably the best video camera Nikon makes right now is the D810 and it is a full two years behind in feature offerings and marketing compared to canon.  Basically canon would have to fall on their face with their next video offering to give Nikon a chance.  After their release of the 5dsr, that's not happening anytime soon.  I'm as big of fan of Nikon as anyone else in this thread, but they should have seized the opportunity while the market was young.  In all honesty, with how they messed up the d600 and D800 launches, no one is going to trust them for video.  Another note:  their first 4k camera will NOT be the D5.  They will come out with a D810 variant with 4K capabilities (probably internally recording to an XQD card).  If it can only record 4K to an external HDMI recorder, it's DOA."
Nikon,39wimw,albinoyoungn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:44:05 2015 UTC,"I would pay extra for it to NOT have video.  If I wanted a movie camera I would spend $6k plus on one, not a still camera that shoots video."
Nikon,39wimw,kyleclements,3,Wed Jun 17 14:55:18 2015 UTC,"I would pay extra for it to NOT have video.   Do you own a Df?  Why would you pay extra for no video?  Video on a DSLR is essentially just feeding the live view data to the memory card, rather than just having it disappear into nothing.  If a camera can do live view, it can do video.    Taking away video doesn't save the camera makers anything, all it does is take away an advertising feature from the product description, and take away a segment of the audience that would want that feature.  The way Nikon's business is going, I can't see them intentionally designing a product to appeal to fewer customers."
Nikon,39wimw,hashi_lebwohl,3,Wed Jun 17 22:47:02 2015 UTC,Cameras at that price point don't need video because the people buying will most likely never use it.

Nikon,39wimw,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yours may be an unpopular opinion, but I agree completely. Video on a consumer grade camera? Fine. Professional grade? Not so much, if at all. I would think if a pro wanted video, he / she'd buy a seperate camera."

She's taken some really great videos, I mean, really good, and it's a cheap camera.  I have my D750 and have some beautiful stills, but haven't bothered with the video, it doesn't interest me."

But someone who is trying to get into film making might, particularly if they have access to Nikon lenses. It's more expensive than a D5500, but if they make a camera that can do higher quality recording because of the higher processor the camera needs to shoot 11+ fps (better quality video compression, higher bit rate, 4k, etc.) it might draw some people who want a fancy RED camera but can't afford $30,000+."

The reason being was to add one extra option to deliver (a 5-10 second clip) without having to set up another camera. The people I was with can afford a dedicated video camera, but for what they want, it's just a value-add and not a complete new revenue stream justifying a dedicated camera.  Pros want it. Pros uses it. Not all pros, but enough to make it sell more cameras.  Leica also sells a camera that has no video and the only controls are aperture, shutter speed, iso, power, shutter button, and viewfinder... it costs more than twice as much as the version with video because so few people will buy it.  You're calling /u/sushimpp butthurt but you're the only one screaming and feeling because you don't use video that cameras should not have video if that's not butthurt, I don't know what is.

Notice the whole time I have have been speaking for me, yet these two little cunts are somehow speaking for everyone.  I also said that I don't want a fucking Leica yet you keep bringing that up.  Why the fuck can't you little cunts just accept that not everyone wants what you want and not everyone shoots from the comfort of a studio.  I also don't understand why you don't consider the ergonomics of a movie camera vs. a still camera.  Video is a fucking gimmick to sell cameras to idiots that prefer a ton of shit features instead of a solid camera.  Now why don't you two little cunts go off and pleasure yourselves to the technical specs on camera websites."
Nikon,39wimw,ApatheticAbsurdist,0,Fri Jun 19 22:29:16 2015 UTC,"For future reference, using all caps is generally interpreted as screaming in forums. e.g.:   Because I am a professional PHOTOGRAPHER NOT A VIDEOGRAPHER.   Also name calling isn't that great either.   I also don't understand why you don't consider the ergonomics of a movie camera vs. a still camera.   Because most of my professional work is done in the studio. So if i'm working with something like the D800 and the camera is on a foba stand, I can very easily do a pan across an object and get a video using the modeling lights after I got the product shot I want. Having that in the camera makes my life a lot easier, allows me to get a value-add with minimal effort and makes the camera worth more to me than having a separate video camera (If shooting video requires switching cameras doing a different setup, it probably wouldn't be worth it for a 10 second clip. But if I can provide that clip it makes the people I work for happy and makes me look better).  On the flip side (outside of the studio) I took my own D800 to Korea recently and came back with 3800 shots of personal work. Not once did I have any issues with live view or movie modes getting in the way or making me miss any shots. I can accept that some (many people) don't want video.

Nikon,39wimw,W00ster,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:47:11 2015 UTC,"You would have to. Video really doesn't cost anything to add, but having it means they sell more cameras because some video people will buy the cameras, which drives the cost of the camera down.  Nikon does make a full frame DSLR without video that is focused purely on photography. It's called the Df"
Nikon,39wimw,kyleclements,0,Fri Jun 19 04:01:23 2015 UTC,The demographic that the D5 would be aimed at does not care about video.  Why spend $6K on a camera when you could spend $2k or less on a camera that will do the same.  You say they would have to add video yet point out the Df that doesn't.  The Df is the little cousin to the D4 that's why it's so expensive.  They fell short with that camera when they went cheap on the AF and made it all hipster cool.
Nikon,39wimw,Socrateswasacowboy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:10:18 2015 UTC,"Take look at the specs, the Df is the D610's cousin.

Take video out of the D610 and it costs more. Because it becomes more of a niche product."
Nikon,39vva8,old_snake,16,Mon Jun 15 05:40:07 2015 UTC,"For $80, are you sure you're getting the modern 50mm F1.8 AF-S lens? The older 50mm D series lenses won't autofocus on your D5300.  Recommendation: Set your 18-55 to 35mm, and shoot without touching the zoom. Repeat at 50mm (or 55 if that's easier; same basic result.) Which do you prefer?  Alternatively, look through your catalog, and see what focal length most of your images were shot at. The camera records that data into the images themselves.  FWIW: General recommendation is to get the 35mm for APS-C bodies, and the 50mm for full-frame bodies. This is considered a normal focal length for these bodies. It turns out to be a great all-around lens.  50mm is more of a upper-body portraiture length lens on the DX body, but for that use you may find that your 55-200 works fine."

It feels like it can't take a bad picture, pin sharp foreground and lovely bokeh background make even a quickly taken shot look great. I've gone from feeling 1 in 10 pics are good to 6-7 in 10. I have a 50mm prime too but it just  didn't do the same for me.   I set it at f2.8 in aperture priority and nice pictures just throw themselves at my sd card :-)"
Nikon,39vva8,Fishamatician,3,Mon Jun 15 15:06:51 2015 UTC,Another vote for the 35mm. I have both and I use the 35mm is by far my most used lens. The 50mm is nice but I find it too long for my purposes. I'd add that sometimes I wished I had something wider than the 35mm at f1.8 (I'm still dreaming about getting a Sigma 18-35 1.8)
Nikon,39vva8,Marturo,3,Mon Jun 15 15:07:11 2015 UTC,Set your 18-55 lens to 35mm and use it for a day as you would use the prime lens. Then set it to 50mm and do the same. See which focal length is more practical for you. Then you can have a much clear idea on which one to choose.
Nikon,39vva8,CerotingDog,2,Tue Jun 16 05:28:37 2015 UTC,This is the advice I always give people facing this decision.  The only place we differ is that I'd say spend more time than a day with each focal length.

Nikon,39vl64,DavidGuyon,2,Mon Jun 15 03:57:45 2015 UTC,find the two buttons on the 750 with green dots  next to them. Hold them both down until the top LCD screen blinks. This will factory reset the camera. Often fixes camera issues.

Nikon,39vge6,blutiel,5,Mon Jun 15 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"I'm using a D800, after using a D700 for about 5 years.. I also shoot almost exclusively portraiture. Image quality on the D800 is exceptional. The battery life is not that bad. I could get through a whole shoot (400-500 shots) on the same battery (I did have a backup just in case). If you are shooting portraiture, how many FPS do you actually need? It does 4fps stock, and 6fps with the grip.  I personally only rarely have it on High-Speed mode anyway, but your needs may differ.  The D3 Series have professional full grade weather sealing, which may be important if you want to shoot in the pouring rain (with pro lenses of course), whereas the D800 has decent enough weather sealing for a light shower. I personally think you'd be better getting the D800 as it is a generation on from the D3 series (Or even get a D810), as it's more of a studio tuned camera than the D3, which is a pro-all-rounder. A second hand D800 may have had less abuse than a Pro-series as well, but that would depend on the individual I guess. Either way, be sure to get some good glass with it, as at 24 and 36 megapixel, the deficiencies in cheaper glass are much more apparent."
Nikon,39vge6,AstroChuppa,2,Mon Jun 15 03:53:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed response and input.  It sounds like the D800 or D810 might be a better choice for me!
Nikon,39vge6,Matterchief,5,Mon Jun 15 04:18:27 2015 UTC,Why......would you want a D3x over the d800 if you aren't doing any sort of crazy stuff with it...
Nikon,39vge6,wookiepornstar,3,Mon Jun 15 03:51:41 2015 UTC,"Good point! But as I stated above, I was leaning more towards the D3x because of the battery life, shutter, etc....so I wasn't sure if just those are worth considering it over another camera. Also, I read on this reddit a couple times that some considered the D3x more portrait cameras? Again, that's why I thought I'd straight up ask :)"
Nikon,39vge6,sushimpp,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:11:02 2015 UTC,I would opt for the D800. You don't really need the features of the D3x like low light and high fps for portraits. Buy the fastest SD and CF cards you can so the camera can write to the cards as quickly as possible. 5fps would be fine for portraits right? You could always rent both cameras and test them out before buying.
Nikon,39vge6,sushimpp,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:03:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and yes, the faster body with the 3dx isn't something I'd utilize often (other than experimenting with sports), but my main interest at this moment is a body that's best for portraiture. 5FPS would do the job just fine. Thanks again...everyone's final input has swayed me to the D800 :)"
Nikon,39vge6,sushimpp,-2,Mon Jun 15 21:42:05 2015 UTC,"Somebody wants to look like a pro with his big boy body...  The D800 is cheaper and image quality shits all over the D3x files. Wasabi power batteries are 19.99, come on dude.  Not the D800E or D810 I would keep the AA filter for fabrics/hair.  On top of which, D3x cannot even take video, lets say to get the urge at some point, I don't know...."
Nikon,39vge6,Sardonnicus,2,Mon Jun 15 11:03:51 2015 UTC,"Is it really necessary to talk down to me like that? If someone wanted a ""big boy body"" for the sake of ""looking like a pro"", wouldn't they just BUY it, instead of coming on here and asking you guys? Sorry, I was just asking for legitimate advice, since I've gotten mixed advice in the real world about these cameras. That doesn't mean you have be condescending with your response."

Nikon,39vge6,turinturambar81,2,Mon Jun 15 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"Ha...I'm actually unsure if you're being sarcastic or not. Regardless, please leave it as I did read and appreciate the actual input. A quality Nikon replacement for the D3x runs around 100(generic is less im sure), and I just assumed it'd be the same for the later models, faster bodies or not. $20 does make the shorter bat life seem insignificant.  Definitely taking the sharpness of the AA filter into consideration.  Bottom line: Would I love to experiment with the D3x? Sure, and a friend actually told me to go ahead and grab it at that price (even for portraits)....but again, I REALLY want the best deal/body for portraiture at the moment, not for speed shooting. I've done sports portraits in the past, but they are far and few between, and if I had to choose one over the other, it's a body aimed more at portraiture.  My added dilemma was that I'd also been told that the D3x was specifically great for portraits too... one swore by it over the D800(mainly use it for portraiture), so maybe that's the ""big boy"" type you are referring to.   Personally, I'd rather not lug around the bulky 3Dx body if it's not worth it, especially if I also won't often utilize it's full potential as a faster body.  As for video, that has zero impact on my decision. I've spent 100% of my time on film cameras and DSLRs that had no video, and I've just never felt the interest to seek a camera that has it.  ....but as I mentioned in another comment, I'm now pretty much sold on the fact that I want a D800/810 etc."
Nikon,39vge6,OscarZetaAcosta,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"Not being sarcastic, I apologize.  The difference you are going to see IMHO with the D800 compared to the previous gen sensors (and Canon sensors, while we are at it) is that the files are not really all the sharper but rather beefier, thicker, cleaner.  The D8xx (and D750 or so I hear) have amazing dynamic range. But its not that simple. As far as the D800 with which I have the most experience with, what makes its dynamic range so special is two things, besides the incredible latitude:  1) the grain(noise) in the shadows is very, very pleasing. This means pushing shadows actually can become basically a part of your workflow. You learn the limits and you learn to count, or rely on that information that you know it's there in those shadows.  2) no banding. I cant stress how important this is. No other camera I have ever used gets close (I'm sure some Sonys do). When you mistreat those raw files, and stress the dynamic range, they stay clean, just pleasing grain, no image ruining banding.  Add on top of this that the large amount of pixels takes noise reduction really, really well and you start to understand how powerful this combo really is.  Last thing is I am not a fan of no AA filter cameras. (And I'm probably the last of my kind). I think the sharpness advantage is negligible and no client you'll ever have will notice such a small difference in sharpness.  Now, in the (not so remote IMHO) case that moire actually pops up in a shot, now the same client that would have never seen that sharpness advantage, WILL see that moire and bust your balls about it. Not a good trade.  Peace"
Nikon,39vge6,OscarZetaAcosta,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:40:36 2015 UTC,Not to mention that the D3x is a bloated slow shooter who's MP amount has been matched and bested by other nikon FX and DX bodies which have higher FPS than the D3x.  The D3s is more function-able than the D3x at this point.
Nikon,39n9ke,merkucjo,6,Fri Jun 12 23:22:20 2015 UTC,The Sigma 17-50 f/2.8 or 17-70 f/2.7-4 would probably your best bet. The former slightly better for wedding and the latter for walkabout/travel. Not sure if they are lighter than the 18-200 but they will be lighter than the Nikkor 17-55 f/2.8.   I have been planning to switch from a T3i to a D7200 or D610 and those are the two fast zooms I keep coming back to for the D7200 option. My other option is the 18-140VR with the 35 and 50 primes.   If you want lighter I thing you really only have the kit lens or primes as viable options.
Nikon,39n9ke,opticalminefield,3,Fri Jun 12 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"I second this. The 17-55 is far too heavy and isn't great for travel use.

Personally, when travelling, I use my 35mm 1.8 with my D7200, as well as a light 55-200 telephoto.  However, if you're going down the wedding path, you may want to go with the Nikon 17-55 2.8 if you can afford it along with some primes. The 17-55 is quite hefty and expensive though."

Nikon,39n9ke,burning1rr,6,Sun Jun 14 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"Try to use the combo for a bit just to get a feel for what focal length you want. You have a 35mm, 50mm is a little longer but not that much. Use the either the 18-55 or the 18-200mm to see if 50mm will be good enough for you.  You do have the 18-55mm kit lens and that's a lot lighter than the 18-200mm. If you feel longer than 50mm would be better, the 85mm f/1.8G makes for a nice compliment to the 35mm... use your 18-200mm to see if 85mm is a focal length you'd like. The 85mm is  a little bit heavier than the 35 or 50mm lenses but it's about half the weight of the 18-200mm."
Nikon,39n9ke,burning1rr,3,Sat Jun 13 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"How are you carrying your camera? Do you stuff all your lenses in a bag or backpack? Are you still using the neck-strap that came with the body? What you pack, and how you carry your equipment can have  a huge impact on how large a lens you can carry.  FWIW:  The superzoom lenses, such as the 18-200 and 18-300 will tend to be very heavy and complex with poor optical quality. The newer 55-200 is much smaller and lighter. You could probably pack that and stuff a 18-55 in your pocket without increasing your weight much if any at all.  Long lenses with a wide aperture are always going to be heavy. The 18-55 f2.8 is a pro grade DX zoom. It's not a typical walking around lens.  Primes are nice. Manual focus lenses are even smaller and lighter.  If you really want portability, consider buying a mirrorless with a Nikon adapter, and manual lenses. The sony bodies with focus peaking work amazingly well for anything that isn't moving. Frankly, focus peaking with a manual lens provides faster and more reliable subject acquisition than autofocus."

Nikon,39n9ke,OM3N1R,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:54:54 2015 UTC,"I dont like manual focus lenses, I like speed   For some kinds of photography, focus peaking will allow you to acquire the subject faster than autofocus. With focus peaking, the camera highlights what's in focus; you simply rotate the focus ring until the object you want in focus is in focus.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZFtPKgBM0U  This can be useful if you want multiple subjects in focus. The comparable process on a DSLR is to use back-button focus or AF Lock to focus on the center of the viewfinder and recompose your shots.  Focus peaking is good for portraiture and landscape photography. It's excellent for shallow DOF. It's not good for moving subjects.  Be careful, it's not always perfect:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMAlMQev7Kw"

They allow for auto focus (useless really with macro) and camera aperture control and are well built.   I bought mine second hand on ebay for about $60"
Nikon,39j4ti,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:55:40 2015 UTC,"Extension tubes are just tubes, but cheap ones will wobble and/or won't let you control the aperture of the lens unless you're using older lenses with an aperture ring and you'll loose autofocus. Higher end ones will be more solid and made to more exacting tolerances so they'll let you focus more accurately, they'll also likely have the ability to control the aperture and possibly allow AF on some lenses (though AF at macro distances is problematic and it's often best to focus to a given size manually then move the camera in or out to focus on the subject).  Important questions are what lens(es) do you plan on using the tube(s) with?  and how close do you plan on focusing? or how small of an object do you expect to want to fill the photograph?"

Nikon,39f6dj,benfires,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:53:24 2015 UTC,Noticeable hiss on my d600 also.
Nikon,39f6dj,siwhoaks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:16:57 2015 UTC,"There is a setting for recording levels in the camera. It's in movie settings> Microphone.  For the built-in microphone and the random levels of sound it would encounter you would probably want it on Auto-Sensitivity. This uses some built in amplification circuitry that is not of great quality but is a good match for the built-in mic. It amplifies things that are quiet and after a certain attack time quiets things that are too loud.  If your plugging in an external mic you do not want to use Auto-sensitivity. It would jack up the amplification if the mic was quiet until you have noise. It would quiet down any external volume control you ""cranked"" on an external mic. That built-in preampfification is no good for an external mic. Got to Movie Setting> Microphone > put it on Manual Sensitivity. Plug in a value like 8 or 10 or whatever works for your external mic. The onscreen sound meters are a little hot in my experience where they show the sound all red and peaking it is not when you get the file into the computer.  If you still have excess noise check your connections and wires maybe even your mic.  Edit: If this Movie Settings > Microphone > Manual sensitivity is what you can't crank past 1 then I think you are putting a line level output in a mic level jack."
Nikon,39f6dj,KaJashey,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know all about the auto gain and mic level, that's why I did say that anything above 1 makes my audio hiss.  I'll have to check if my wires are soldered properly though, thanks for pointing that out"

Nikon,39f6dj,KaJashey,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:01:34 2015 UTC,If you can't go past 1 check that your microphone puts out mic level sound. You don't want to plug line level stuff into your mic jack. If it has a switch between mic level and line level put it on mic level.

Nikon,39d9mv,the_gizzle,8,Thu Jun 11 00:06:07 2015 UTC,D7100 or D7200 is the better choice. I wouldnt bother going from a 5xxx to another 5xxx
Nikon,39d9mv,Elderain,7,Thu Jun 11 02:09:03 2015 UTC,"I researched the D7100 a bit, since I owned a D7000. My impression was that the AF was significantly improved, but the low-light high ISO performance was only barely any better. The small buffer and large file size led to really disappointing burst/continuous shooting in sports type situations. Overall it was a step up, but not enough for me to pay that much when I already had a D7000. The D7200 seems to have fixed the buffer problem, so if you want DX then I say that this the one to get.  Compared to the D5xxx series, I have to comment on the viewfinder size, inclusion of the AF motor, and the front/rear command dials. These all (in my opinion) make the D7xxx series much nicer to use if you want to really take control and take advantage of older lenses.   Having said that, the D610 is getting to be shockingly cheap, and the D750 (which I have now) has already come down in price so much that I don't like to think of what i paid. I assume you have DX lenses since you are just looking at DX, but I can't help mention where FX is now."
Nikon,39d9mv,totallyshould,3,Thu Jun 11 03:26:02 2015 UTC,So what you want to do is research the upgrades of their current expeed processor over the former.  Nikon respins their camera lines after they come out with a new processor. They make minor enhancements gets and there but expeen is the major reason.  After doing so if the updates don't seem major or useful go with the d7100 and a better lens.
Nikon,39d9mv,HVPhoto,3,Thu Jun 11 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"I would like the more advanced controls of the 7xxx series, but I'm also on the fence since I may feel as though I ""upgraded"" by just getting some better lens"
Nikon,39d9mv,ApatheticAbsurdist,7,Thu Jun 11 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you're frustrated.  Are you frustrated with the controls. Do you find changing the shutter and aperture a bit cumbersome? Do you find changing the white balance a little slow because when you have to pull up a menu to scroll through to change the setting? If these things are frustrating you the most, the D7100 is a good choice.  Are you frustrated in the camera's ability to track a moving subject when you set it to AF-C mode? Do you wish you could more shots when in CH burst mode? If so the D7100 is a good choice.  Do you have ""AF-D"" series lenses that you wish you could autofocus on your camera? That could be worth while to go to the D7100 for, but keep in mind you could sell your ""AF-D"" lenses and replace them with ""AF-S"" (""G"") lenses that will work on your camera. If you only have the 50mm f/1.8D, you could probably sell that for $70-80 and replace it with an f/1.8G for $200 new (or a bit cheaper used). That's a lot cheaper than upgrading to a D7100.  If you aren't frustrated with those things and are more frustrated with image quality or the kind of pictures you can take. A lens probably would be a better choice. The D5500, D7100, and D7200 will all give you roughly the same image quality improvement over the D5100, which is a bit, but not earth-shattering."
Nikon,39d9mv,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Thu Jun 11 02:07:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for all of those suggestions. I suppose it's mainly the image quality I want to upgrade the most as I don't have too much issue with my current controls. Im starting to see that the best bet would to get some new glass instead. At least I'll still be able to use it in the future with a new body anyways.
Nikon,39d9mv,lepermessiah222,4,Thu Jun 11 02:57:58 2015 UTC,"Focus on what you're frustrated about. If you wish your lenses could go wider so you could get closer and get a more dynamic perspective, get an ultra wide lens. If you wish your lenses were better in low light, get a wide aperture lens. If you're frustrated with your 50mm f/1.8D's inability to autofocus, get a G (or consider either a 35mm f/1.8G DX or an 85mm f/1.8G if you want a different focal length than the 50)."

Nikon,39d9mv,lepermessiah222,5,Thu Jun 11 01:42:21 2015 UTC,I would upgrade lenses before your body. A good standard 2.8 zoom (sigma or tamron 17-50) or even the classic 35mm 1.8g from nikon. If you're more of a telephoto guy look into nikon's 70-300. I hear tamron's is not too shabby either.

Nikon,39d9mv,Prequalified,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:17:02 2015 UTC,Are you saying that the 5500 isn't much more of an upgrade in image quality over the 5100?
Nikon,39d9mv,lam3rz,5,Thu Jun 11 01:23:50 2015 UTC,It is quite an upgrade but don't expect to fall off your chair when you see the results. Good glass is more important than getting the latest body. The 5100 still has a great sensor (same as the D7000)
Nikon,39bzef,ShutterLeaf,2,Wed Jun 10 19:06:39 2015 UTC,"I use it on D610.  Its super sharp in the middle at 17mm from wide open,but the borders...are just squishy mush due to extreme distortion.  Even stopping it down does not help at all."

Nikon,39cl7z,UnclePeanut,12,Wed Jun 10 21:21:50 2015 UTC,"You're only going to be happy with an upgrade if you know exactly why you're doing it. To say you're not satisfied with the d7100 capabilities is a very bold statement. It's a phenomenol camera, and in ways more capable or better than the D610. (for reference i own a D7000, D600, and D750.)  What exactly about the D7100 is not up to your standards? How is that camera body getting in the way of the images you want to create. These are the questions you should be thinking about when considering new gear.   What about the D750/610 do you need to make images you cant with the D7100. Do you need more low light performance? Do you need shallower depth of field? Are you trying to shoot wider angle shots? These may be some reasons to upgrade.   Wanting a ""better camera"" is not a reason to upgrade at all. The D7100 is capable of insanely sharp images with that 35mm 1.8 dx. Performs nobly up to ISO3200. Has a faster frame rate than the 610. Has a faster flash sync speed than the 610. Has a faster max shutter speed than the 610. And they are all 24MP.  To answer the question you need to examine what you shoot the most and how the camera is limiting you. If youre mostly shooting street photos, family vacations, portraits and still life, you will find very little difference other than the fact you now have a larger, heavier camera thats capable of essentially the same thing and costs 2-3x more.   The only reason I see in upgrading from the D7100, to a D750 (I dont think the D610 is a huge upgrade over the D7100) would be added low light performance or the better AF system in the 750- and thats really only going to affect night time photos without flash. maybe you're into astrophotography.   I shoot a lot of concerts so the added low light performance was the main reason I had to upgrade. But I worked on my technique for years on my d7000 getting better and better before moving to full frame.   I LOVE the FX sensors, but REALLY urge people against them unless they know exactly why they need that camera. If youre just buying it because its a ""nicer"" camera than the 7100, all you are really doing is increasing the cost of your hobby and the weight of your bag because the lenses are way pricier and way heavier. Which is a serious bitch. Carrying a FX system all day vs a DX system is a big difference. Also, think about the subjects you'll be shooting. Pulling out a massive camera with a massive lens is daunting for a lot of subjects and you'll get a bunch of pictures of people looking shy/scared.   I still regularly shoot on my D7000 with my 18-200 lens because its a reasonable-sized do-everything system.   With that said the upgrade to full frame is glorious. But you should know exactly why you need to do it before doing it. Its about picking the right tool for the job. Define the job first.    So my advice is if you need to ask about it, you probably dont need it. You'll know when you need it, and there wont be any question.  Where can we see some of your images?! =)"

Supreme ease. Highly recommended."
Nikon,39cl7z,TheFreneticist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:45:03 2015 UTC,"I had the D7000 and went as far as getting an SB-800 for AF assist because the camera had such a bad time focusing in low light.  With the SB, AF was very much improved, but then you're lugging around a large strobe in the shoe, which doesn't work well for a vacation camera.  With the D750, AF is much better. And really, side by side, we're talking about millimeters in physical dimensions, and not much in the weight.  Yes, FX zoom lenses probably weigh more, but they're also much faster (f2.4, f4) compared to the typical 3.5-5.6 range on the DX."
Nikon,39cl7z,lepermessiah222,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:23:16 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. That was definitely a weakness of the D7000, and frankly of the D600 too as they have near identical AF systems.   The D750 is a beast in low light. I am seriously blown away by it. On top of it, its the smallest FX body. It feels fantastic in hand and is pretty lightweight. Its just the right amount of everything, similarl to when they introduced the D7000 a few years back.   But the point stands. You were using your D7x00 to its fullest and through that, identified an aspect of the camera that was limiting your creative juju. Thats all I was outlining for OP. You'll appreciate your cameras capabilities more, when you're actively seeking them out."
Nikon,39cl7z,AcEBAthunTeR,6,Fri Jun 12 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"A new camera is not going to make you a better photographer. The D7100 is a fantastic piece of gear. So is the D750... And the D3300 for that matter. They're all great, and if you can't take good enough pictures with either of these, maybe you need to look at yourself and practice your craft a bit more.  Sure a full frame camera is nice and has many advantages over a DX body but it's not the answer to everything (or nothing in your case, you don't even seem to know why you want to upgrade)  On top of that you have some great glass to go with your camera... Go out and shoot with what you have. Try something new maybe? New subjects, new techniques..."

I keep thinking the camera must be damaged in some way, but Ive treated it with a lot of care and never let it fall or get harmed in any way."
Nikon,39cl7z,TheFreneticist,10,Wed Jun 10 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"That's either you or your lenses. I had the D7100 even though now I have the D750, the D7100 is an amazing camera. If your camera is damaged (which I doubt) then you need to replace it, by sending it to nikon. But it sounds like you are shooting at wide apertures which is resulting in soft photos. Show some pics where it was soft and I can give you a better answer. Also your lens can affect this as well.   You in no way shape or form need a new body to get ""sharper"" photos, you need to learn to nail focus better and maybe a new lens will help. The image quality from a D7100 to lets say a D750 won't be as big as you think, unless you have the FX lenses to match."
Nikon,39cl7z,RIO_XL,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:48:57 2015 UTC,"I second that. Even if the lenses are good and the camera is good, the digital workflow and (especially) the lighting can have a huge impact on perceived sharpness."

A lot of your shots are in bright light at F2.8 and 1/4000 of a second shutter and ISO 100.   If you want sharper pictures, stop your lens down, say f/8 and use something like 1/320 or 1/500 and bump your iso to 400. This will put more in focus and get into the sharper range of your lens."

I was obsesses with using my 35 mm at 1.8 all of the time, to get bokeh. I still don't understand how to manipulate depth of field and am learning. But stopping down to f4 or at times to f8 seriously increased the sharpness of my latest pictures. Mostly street and still life.   Hope this helps."

This is a graph of perceptual sharpness on the 20mm 2.8d from wide open to stopped down on the d7100 body.

Nikon,399erh,Etownkirk,4,Wed Jun 10 05:12:27 2015 UTC,"Don't mean to change the subject but just throwing it out there... I was strongly considering the 35 1.8 FX as well for my D750 a few months ago, and decided to get the 28 1.8 instead and I absolutely love it.  I already own the 50 1.8G and I decided that the 35 wouldn't give me that big of a difference.  The 28mm perspective is absolutely perfect in my opinion for indoor shots as well as a general walkaround and I think I would miss shots indoors with at 35 sometimes when I'm against a wall.  So I guess it depends on what you want to use it for.  The 35 is probably better as a general street lens since you don't have to get quite as close."
Nikon,399erh,Shroomoholic,-6,Wed Jun 10 13:16:59 2015 UTC,"as well as a general walkaround    A 28mm is a perfect walkaround lens? Wow, ok... What are you then shooting? Unless I shoot landscape etc, I find a single fixed focal length for walkabouts to be extremely limiting. Heck, even with landscape, I prefer lenses where I can compose the image in the viewfinder and not having to crop away a lot of the image in order to get the subject brought into the viewers focus. And that in general means zooms."
Nikon,399erh,W00ster,4,Wed Jun 10 15:25:36 2015 UTC,"well now you are comparing apples to oranges.  OP asked about a specific prime and i recommend one that is similar but in my opinion, better.    primes vs zooms is an entirely different discussion.  you can prefer zoom lenses all you want but there are huge drawbacks especially if you want to focus on street photography which typically involves either a 28, 35, or 50 fixed lenses.  Having a small, inconspicuous, large aperture lens is considerably more beneficial then being able to zoom in and out when doing street photography.  Now, if you have no idea what you will be shooting, or are on vacation or something and want an ""all in one"" lens to cover all possibilities then obviously a zoom is better, but I doubt very seriously OP is in this category since he is willing to plop down $500 on a set focal length."

Nikon,399erh,W00ster,2,Wed Jun 10 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"I own it and recently made a thread about how I liked this lens vs the sigma 35mm 1.4, which is arguably the most popular prime for the D750. When I put them head to head, in indoor and outdoor, in low light and bright the light, the difference was very minimal. Some shots, the nikon looked a tad better, some shots they looked the same, and wide open the sigma looked a tad better. The differences were so small, that even people I showed couldn't tell a difference. Obviously you gain the extra stop though, which to me isn't a deal breaker, as 1.8 is fine for what I do.  The difference is not worth the weight and the price of the sigma in my opinion. My point in all of this is that the nikon 35mm 1.8g FX lens is amazing with great auto focus, great sharpness, and it's super light. It's a no brainer for the D750. Feel free to ask any questions.

Nikon,399erh,MustangSense,2,Wed Jun 10 06:26:47 2015 UTC,"I own the 35mm F/2 D, and use it on my D750 with no issues at all. My primary focus is weddings.  For my personal style the 35mm (as well as the 50mm) is a utility length.  I use it when I am documenting something that requires that focal length.  If I am getting creative I am either using 85 or 24.  The 35mm is almost always on my 2nd body.  My last wedding breakdown was like this: 24mm 181 shots 35mm 479 shots 50mm 606 shots 70-200mm 899 shots 85mm 543 shots  (Between two shooters)"

Nikon,399erh,mrdat,2,Wed Jun 10 07:46:55 2015 UTC,What other lenses do you have? What role would it be filling for you?
Nikon,399erh,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"I have the 50mm , 60mm micro, and 14mm Rokinon. I have had issues where my 50 just doesn't cut it when trying to take a long exposure of falls."
Nikon,399erh,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:21:18 2015 UTC,"You mean it's not wide enough? I assume your 14mm is too wide.  If you only wish the 50mm was just a tad bit wider, then yeah 35mm might be the ticket. But I'm going to guess you might be happier with a 24 or 28mm.   I'm going to throw something controversial out there and potently recommend a zoom. This gives you more flexibility to get exactly the angle of view you need to get the right perspective. Also if you're going for long exposures, you don't want to shoot at f/1.8 anyway. So if you're going to stop down to f/14, who cares if the lens only opens to f/4.  The 24-120mm f/4 VR is a bit pricey at $1,300 but it is very nice and gives you a lot of flexibility.  The 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G VR still gives you a lot of flexibility at a price closer to your price range ($600)  If you want to go super cheap you can look for a used 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5D that can be had for around $200. When stopped down between f/8 and f/14, it's a very nice lens for the price.  The other advantage of a zoom is it let's you experiment and find which focal lengths you prefer so if you do buy a prime, you know which one to get."
Nikon,39dhly,anthony00001,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:59:04 2015 UTC,"As a person who has used both of these cameras for video, I say go Canon. The adustments are much easier to do in live view (i.e. you can manually set the white balance to a temperature in live view on a Canon, which is nonexistent on the D3200). The overall quality of the final video is good either way, but for manual control, go Canon. If you don't know much about cameras, go for the D3200, because it is easier to use. Plus the 18-55 kit lens has good laser auto focus as well."

Nikon,39duvj,steed_jacob,2,Thu Jun 11 02:22:53 2015 UTC,"you dont happen to have auto ISO on do you, because even if you change the ISO manually, the camera will still select a different one with auto ISO, so if you are making changes like shutter speed, the camera will just adjust the ISO to get the same exposure it wants based on the metering and you won't notice any changes in the LCD.   also, are you using flash?  if so, and if you are shooting outdoors, the relatively low shutter speed due to flash sync may be the reason the shots are massively overexposing.  other than that, I'm out of ideas.  sounds like something you should call Nikon about to see if it's a setting or a defect issue."

Nikon,399hte,ShutterLeaf,2,Wed Jun 10 05:43:04 2015 UTC,I've used both the 80 - 200 AF D one touch (screw motor driven from the body) and the 80 200 two touch (with the silent wave motor or whatever its called) and can say without a shadow of a doubt that I would rather get the Af s version. The focusing is unbelievably faster - I hated using the screw driven one but needed the length at a low cost at the time.
Nikon,399hte,DinoGoesRawr,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:38:19 2015 UTC,"I've always found the AF-D version quick to focus on the higher-end bodies (F5, D2H, D3X, etc), but a little slower on the lower-tier bodies. The focus servos on those professional bodies feel like it's about to rip the lens off. The AF-S versions work better on the prosumer bodies."
Nikon,399hte,veepeedeepee,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"What are you planning on shooting with it? I'm assuming you're referring to focusing ability since the ""D"" designation refers to the lens ability to report focus distance info to the body. Most old ""D"" lenses are auto focus driven by the body. It's slower than the in lens AFS motor. You also need to flip a switch on the body to override autofocus where as on a AFS lens you grab the focus ring and it will override the autofocus. These old externally driven lenses tend to have fewer parts. I've got quite a few older D lenses for a fraction of what new lenses cost and most of the time they are 80-90% of their AFS newer counterparts. From what I'm reading it looks like the latest generation 80-200 2.8D which is still in production offers a quicker autofocus than the first generation ""D"" models."
Nikon,399hte,MustangSense,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:47:56 2015 UTC,"The main reason to prefer the 80-200 AF-S over the older, but still in production, 80-200 AF-D is the faster AF performance for sports/action/wildlife. The main reason people prefer the 80-200 AF-D is that it is/was half the price of it modern AF-S successors. Also, people like solid chunks of metal and glass, maybe even romanticize them (they do feel fantastic though - I love handling and shooting my older lenses but when it comes to crunch time performance, they can't touch the modern AF-S lenses).  I'd take the AF-S version over the D version in a second if someone offered me a great deal on one because the faster AF-S performance is something I would get a great amount of benefit from shooting kids sports. For others, that feature might not be as important.  Either one will take excellent pictures."
Nikon,399hte,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:54:11 2015 UTC,i am more lean toward the afs as well but since the lens is out of production now... its almost impossible to have it repair once the motor stops working.
Nikon,399hte,jgilbs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"I bought both an af-d and af-s version from keh.  Keeping the af-d and sending back af-s for exactly this reason.  Also i got the af-d for only $278, so it was totally worth it"
Nikon,399hte,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"I have the AF-D because it's still being produce and you can get it pretty cheap used. It's good for what I need... I often prefer to shoot on a tripod. I'm a bit slower in what I do. The AF is slower so if you're shooting sports or birds or something it might struggle a bit. I've gotten some bird shots here and there, but I'd say my hit-rate is pretty low (I'm not a bird shooter so it can be partly user error).  I would not recommend buying the AF-D new though. If you want it try to find it used, because you can probably save a decent amount buying used. I learned that lesson the hard way when I went to appraise my equipment for insurance (the lens I paid $1000 is worth about $400 less just for ""driving it off the lot).  That said, there have been a couple times since I got it that I wish I just went ahead and paid a little extra for the 70-200mm f/4 VR. Newer lens, newer AF, newer optics, VR for those times when I am hand-held, and most importantly, it's significantly lighter."
Nikon,399hte,Socrateswasacowboy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:38:07 2015 UTC,I had the two ring af D.  Great for a non pro. Afs is overkill for an amateur I think
Nikon,396ojq,qungg,5,Tue Jun 9 17:20:25 2015 UTC,"I think that is a pretty reasonable combination. You could save a little money by going to the 50mm f/1.8D.  People will recommend a 24-70mm f/2.8. But I find it's a specific lens for specific uses. It's great for weddings and events where light is low and you're going to be relatively close to the subject but need a little bit of zoom to get a little wider or being able to take two shots (a longer shot and a tight shot) in quick succession. But for average walk around use it has issues. The focal length is relatively limited and they can be heavy.  The 24-120mm is a very nice general purpose lens that gives you a bit of versatility but doesn't cost that much and isn't that heavy.  One other option I might throw out there is to go in the complete opposite direction. Go very cheap. Get the 50 f/1.8 (either the D or the G) and get a used 28-105mmm f/3.5-4.5D lens for about $200. This will give you a decent zoom lens that will give you a bit of flexiblity to go wide or zoom in a bit, and it also can focus pretty closely for not-quite-macro shots. Save the extra money, and use the 50 and the 28-105mm for a while. After a while you can figure out how you like to shoot with the D750 and see. Maybe you're mostly sticking to the 28-105mm range but want something a little better with VR, then you can look at the 24-120mm f/4 VR. Maybe you find that you always are down at the 24mm and wish it was wider, then you can look at wide angle lenses. Maybe you find you're always at the long end and want a telephoto.   That's basically what I did when I got my D800, I realized I like to be either wide or tele, and if I want to be in the middle range, I'd rather just use the 50mm and get the wider aperture. So I later bought a wide and a tele. I still have the 28-105mm incase I need it, but if I wanted to I could probably sell it for just about as much as I paid for it.  EDIT: Crap, didn't see your mention of Astrophotography. That's one area where the f/2.8 lens might come in handy, but i find that people often prefer very wide angle lenses for that, in which case something like a Tokina 16-28mm f/2.8 would be a good option. You could still get by with the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 particularly with the D750's really good Hi ISO performance, but eventually you might want a wider aperture option, but using the cheap zoom for a while would let you figure out what focal lengths would be important to you for how you want to shoot."

I find the 24-120 is great in that it gives you quite a bit of range and it will help you figure out what your next lens should be (when it comes time to add another lens to your kit, but you should be pretty happy with that set up for a decent while)"

I use it as my walk around lens when I don't mind the weight (generally I just keep my 50 1.8G on it) some people would say its not a good lens but for the money its great.  I does have a vignetting and distortion problem but both are easily corrected in lightroom.  If you do plan on going third party for a 24-70 2.8 go with Tamron.  I have read that the Sigma is pretty bad, haven't used either though.  My current set up is D750, 24-120, 50 1.8G, and an older Tamron 70-300 Macro lens that is pretty slow but can make some decent pictures if you don't need fast auto focus."

Nikon,3962fx,AnUrgeToDance,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"I have one of those, I really enjoy Its unique bookeh.   How bad is it not being able to focus to infinity.   Pretty bad, but no fear. There are 2 workarounds.   m42 Adapter with a glass element in it which corrects infinity issue, but lowers the image quality at the same time. Therefore I wouldnt recomment it. m42 adapter without glass + modified Helious lens to be able to focus to infinity. And you can do the modification yourself quite easily: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggDbEG2_0dg     And if you want you could also apply a chip to your adapter made by russian guy, which tricks your camera and allows you to use its lightmeter and autofocus system as if your lens were fully automatic-lens.   For example : You would need to rotate your focussing ring manually, but your camera would beep when u get ur subject in focus. + the lightmeter feature is always handy for quick adjustments.    I think chip + adapter + shipping should be around 30$.  Packets Avaible   Just Chip = 1200 Rubl Adapter with glass + Chip = 1800 rubl Adapter without glass + Chip = 1500 Rubl    -> Thats what I would recommend if you manage to modify your lens ...

Nikon,3962fx,lam3rz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"I use another M42 lens on my D7100 and F90x film and have both types of adapters. I have a 28mm f/2.8 Marexar, to be specific. The adapter used definitely affects the focus;  The simple screw-on adapter will act like a very very short extension tube, making you lose infinity focus. IIRC the flange distance between M42 and Nikon F mounts are less than 1mm or something like that, but there's definitely no adapter that can hold the lens correctly at that thickness.  The adapter with a built-in glass element will automatically correct for infinity focus, and your D750 should be able to operate it on A and M modes (My D7100 and F90x do that anyway). As far as I know, manufactured glass element adapters are designed to avoid the mirror. My adapter definitely has some bulge out the back end, but it seems very minor and does not hit the mirror. I'm using the glass element adapter made by Scoptic.  If you intend to purchase multiple M42 or M39 mount lenses then it may be more suitable for you to purchase an adapter instead of cracking your brains at how to modify the glass arrangement in each lens to allow infinity focus.  Edit; forgot to mention that any glass element adapter will degrade image quality, how badly degraded it becomes simply depends on the quality of the corrective glass element in the adapter."

To be honest, I'm not impressed by the Nikon wireless mobile utility, and I had some issues getting the 3rd party apps to work with my body.  Not sure about the WU-1b, but the D5300 works by becoming a hot-spot. The phone tethers to the camera body, and the app is needed to pull photos off of the camera. The phone can use live view, and the touch screen allows touch focusing, and actuation of the shutter.  Have you considered using eyefi or something similar? Or perhaps upgrading the body?

Nikon,395aat,kireol,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:52:03 2015 UTC,"Sometimes perfect focus through the viewfinder does not produce perfect focus on the camera sensor. There's a number of things that can cause this, and the problem is often lens specific.  AF fine tuning allows the camera to compensate for this difference, so that when you autofocus through the viewfinder, you get perfect focus on the camera sensor, even if it means the image in the viewfinder is slightly out of focus."
Nikon,395aat,omegis983,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:16:28 2015 UTC,"BTW... The main reason I recommend an upgrade is for the specs.  A used D5200 is relatively inexpensive.

Nikon,391wvj,dk-n-dd,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:54:23 2015 UTC,I'm hoping the lock ups were fixed.  I thought of this after making the thread because since I bought the camera in mid-late May I've had two lock ups.  Just installed the update so hopefully it fixes it.
Nikon,391wvj,htmwrx,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"Weird....that hasn't happened to me, but I did have something happen where the camera decided that I had no SD card in either slot.  Had to pull the battery and cycle the power.  Funny thing is that I didn't turn the camera off.  It was in between shots"
Nikon,391wvj,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"Ugh, the delay in image review and bringing up the menus is just about the one only really annoying thing about shooting with the D750. Time for the firmware update I suppose.   I hope they can do the same for my D7200 'cause it suffers from the same problem."
Nikon,391wvj,Shroomoholic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:50:40 2015 UTC,I own a D750 and I updated last week.  I shot this weekend... didn't notice any difference.  Don't regret updating though.  I trust that whatever Nikon did it probably fixed something since they took the time to create and announce the update.
Nikon,391wvj,kcdale99,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"I have had a couple of lockups, wonder if that is addressed in the newest firmware."
Nikon,391wvj,shannister,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"stupid question, but how do you update the firmware? I've never done an update on my Nikon cameras before..."
Nikon,391wvj,UnspeakableEvil,2,Tue Jun 9 06:17:00 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head you download it on a computer, copy the file across to a memory card, stick that in your camera, then go and find the firmware update option in your camera's menu system.  Best to charge your camera's battery first too, just in case - that said I think it'll refuse to start the update if it doesn't think the battery's got enough life in it."
Nikon,391wvj,sylv3r,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:44:46 2015 UTC,Updated last week.  Still no AF with older Sigma lenses on Live View.
Nikon,391wvj,ambiguouslysizedhawk,-1,Tue Jun 9 07:08:30 2015 UTC,Most of the time those just add a new lens to the distortion control library or something else equally as trivial.

Nikon,38zkz6,MustangSense,6,Mon Jun 8 04:07:15 2015 UTC,"I have the 24-70 f2.8 (no experience with the 24-120 f4) and it is a fantastic lens. Awesome zoom range for FX. It usually stays on my D750/810 and only comes off if I need a telephoto or a UWA. Fantastic build quality, nice and sharp wide open. On a D750 it can AF in crazy low light. Does weigh a bit at around 900g, but totally worth it. If I only got to choose 1 lens, this would be it. However! It really does depend on what you are using your camera for. If it is just for walk around/travel the 24-120 may be a better choice, for zoom range and weight."
Nikon,38zkz6,ShockyTheGreat,5,Mon Jun 8 04:29:40 2015 UTC,"I second this. The 24-70 produces outstanding pictures, sharp colourful and contrasty images. Great for special events (grads, weddings, family picnics, vacation trips). Perhaps not so much for sports or concerts, where you're far from the action and need the range. The weight is no joke, if you have small hands, get ready for the workout if shooting for hours.  edit: I should add, I have the 18-140mm also, for the D7100. It's great and usually switch to it to cover the ranges that the 24-70 can't accomplish. So if I need a wide angle for a building or landscape, i'll switch to it. I've used it to capture far away birds too, but the colours fall flat and the bokeh is mediocre to good at best."
Nikon,38zkz6,RIO_XL,3,Mon Jun 8 04:44:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with what they've said above. I have the D750 and having rented the 24-70 2.8 and owning the 24-120, it depends what you'll be using it for. For me, 24-70 2.8 great optics, 2.8 is great, but pretty heavy. 24-120, only f/4 but versatile focal length range and much lighter imo."
Nikon,38zkz6,AMGp0wer,2,Mon Jun 8 04:49:14 2015 UTC,I have all of the Holy Trinity lenses and I would recommend the 24-70 over the 24-120 any day of the week.
Nikon,38zkz6,W00ster,2,Mon Jun 8 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"I have the Trinity as well, but If I had to choose 1 trinity lens, it would be the 70-200mm.  I have used that one much more than the 24-70mm."
Nikon,38zkz6,Sardonnicus,5,Mon Jun 8 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"Two different lenses for two different purposes. It depends on how you shoot and what you shoot. If you're a wedding or event photographer who tends to stick to closer subjects that are often moving a bit (aka people) and lighting conditions might not be the best, then the 24-70mm f/2.8 has advantages.  If however you're thinking of doing a wider range of shooting, including situations where you might want to be a little farther from the subject, the 24-120mm has more versatility there. It's not really long enough to shoot sports, but if I had to choose between the 24-70 and the 24-120 for things like  that, I'd probably prefer the extra reach of the 24-120. Also for shooting portraits, particularly tighter head-shots, the longer focal length lets you back up a little farther which will give you a more pleasing perspective. The 24-120mm is also noticeably lighter.  The VR on the 24-120mm helps in low light so long as your subjects are stationary (buildings, interiors, nature) but doesn't help if the subject is moving (people, cars, stars)."
Nikon,38zkz6,ApatheticAbsurdist,9,Mon Jun 8 05:10:59 2015 UTC,"Never used it, but I also hear good things about the tamron 24-70mm 2.8. You might want to throw that in your choices as well."
Nikon,38zkz6,SausageLegs,0,Mon Jun 8 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your suggestion, but in this instance I'm not really going third party."
Nikon,38zkz6,timdesuyo,5,Mon Jun 8 05:45:09 2015 UTC,"I own the Tamron 24-70. It is equal to the Nikon in every way except that the Nikon lens hood goes over the sliding front element, which keeps it slightly more protected from the rain. Even pixel peeping, the Tamron is sharper."
Nikon,38zkz6,kelejen,4,Mon Jun 8 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"You say 'equal in every single way' which is a statement that I believe not to be true. I haven't used the Tammy, but my understanding is the Nikon would definitely win in an AF battle, especially in low-light. My Nikon seems to focus near-instantly in incredibly dark scenarios.  Not to mention -- I've seen the out-of-focus areas the Tammy creates (bokeh, if you will) and it is very distracting and unappealing to me. The Nikon, however, renders absolutely beautifully if you ask me."
Nikon,38zkz6,Sardonnicus,0,Mon Jun 8 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm not interested in a third party mid range zoom. The AF abilities don't seem equal. That and I feel like if the Tamron was equal or better in every way everyone would be purchasing that lens over the Nikon. I'm sure I'll get down voted but I've never been a Tamron guy, much like I've never been a Canon guy."
Nikon,38zkz6,kelejen,-2,Tue Jun 9 07:36:38 2015 UTC,"I am almost 100% sure that low-light AF performance comes from the body, and not the lens."
Nikon,38zkz6,Sardonnicus,3,Mon Jun 8 18:31:35 2015 UTC,You would most definitely be wrong then.
Nikon,38zkz6,kelejen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:56:58 2015 UTC,explain?
Nikon,38zkz6,Sardonnicus,2,Mon Jun 8 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"Ok. low-light AF performance is affected by the lens that is mounted on your camera body. Some lenses are better than others, it's a fact. I'll certainly agree that the camera body is the largest factor in low-light AF, but to ignore the lens is silly. I only recently switched from Canon, but as an example, my 35L focused very quickly in dim wedding conditions, but my 50/1.4 would hunt around forever trying to focus in those same conditions.  Like I mentioned earlier, I'm quite new to Nikon, but I do know that my 24-70 is incredible at focusing in dark conditions. My 70-200 seems to be equally amazing in low light. Have not tried my 35G and 85G much yet."
Nikon,38zkz6,kelejen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you are not simply talking about lens speed in regard to lenses with wider apertures?  I've used all kinds of lenses on Nikons and when they are not autofocusing in low light, it's because of the limitations of the sensor in the body and not the lenses."
Nikon,38zkz6,Moice,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:23:57 2015 UTC,"No. All I can say at this point, is grab a Nikon 24-70 and go shoot it in dark conditions. Take it off and put on some lesser lens and see how well it fares. Sorry I don't have any scientific evidence for you."
Nikon,38zkz6,hallbuzz,3,Tue Jun 9 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"I've had the 24-70/2.8 AF-S for years, and it was always my first choice to put into the bag until I added the 24-120/4 AF-S.  They're both excellent, but I find the 24-120 more versatile. Even though I shoot a lot of high ISO, low light work, I prefer the extra reach and the VR of this lens over the one stop faster 24-70.  Shooting raw and applying lens correction in ACR or Lightroom, I see no practical difference in image quality between the two for my purposes."
Nikon,38zkz6,Socrateswasacowboy,2,Mon Jun 8 10:17:55 2015 UTC,2.8 or bust!

Nikon,38zkz6,rakisone,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:43:58 2015 UTC,"This is going to be a tough choice. Very good answers. Blunt instrument vs. something a little more precision. I'm not too worried about the weight and as others have said the d750 is stunning in low light I rented it when it was released. I'm leaning more to the 24-70. I'm just not sure if I'll miss the extra 50mm of reach. That and having only 1 lens to haul around is nice..   I guess I should ask, does anyone have direct experience with the 24-120f4? No need to call in the credentials of the 24-70."
Nikon,38zkz6,eternalsphere25,3,Mon Jun 8 05:44:22 2015 UTC,"I have the D610 and needed a zoom to compliment my Sigma 35mm f1.4. I choose the 24-120, and absolutely love it. I figured that in the day time, when using a flash, or during long exposures i wouldn't be using it wide open, so the extra range would be of more benefit. I also love the 45cm min focus distance at 120mm. The vr works as advertised, haven't found may situations where i the extra stop has been a limiting factor for me with the iso performance of the 610. Both are fine lenses, so you cant go wrong"
Nikon,38zkz6,sushimpp,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:06:02 2015 UTC,I didn't even think to look at the focus distance. That's good to know. I've got A.D.D. sometimes in the middle of shooting one thing I'll get distracted by something really interesting and I'll have to fixate on that for a bit.
Nikon,38zkz6,RevNeilBForme,2,Mon Jun 8 06:14:01 2015 UTC,"I've got the D750 with a 24-120 Nikon I bought after the fact (cost me more...doh!). If I need a faster lens, I grab either the 50/1.4 or 85/1.8. Most of the time the longer reach will serve you better than the additional 1 Stop. Plus the VR is nice to have.   Now if you're telling me that you are a photo journalist and will be beating the crap out of the camera and lens, then go for the 24-70, it's built like a tank and has weather sealing. For the average Joe get the 24-120 and a fast prime and you'll be happy with that combination and save some dough too."
Nikon,38zkz6,rakisone,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:45:50 2015 UTC,"I own a 24-120 f/4 with a D600. It only comes off the camera in very low light (primes) or when a telephoto is needed. I've never been disappointed with the 24-120, and find the extra reach over the 24-70 to be far more convenient. In most situations, the marginal performance increase of the 24-70 doesn't justify the time you have to spend changing lenses and missing shots.  Now I'm not saying the 24-70 is a bad lens. Yes, it is somewhat better than the 24-120, but how much are you willing to lose for a slight increase in performance? I'd only take a 24-70 if I needed the extra stop worth of DOF. In contrast the 24-120 has longer reach, comes with VR, and is the perfect all-purpose walkaround lens. It also isn't as bulky and heavy - I used to think that weight wasn't an issue. Now I intentionally carry only two lenses on me since carrying FX glass around all day makes my back hurt.  If you're concerned about the performance of the 24-120, I've got plenty of pictures on the internet you can look at that will help you realize that it's not as bad of a lens as some people make it out to be. Just my 2 cents."

Nikon,38zkz6,TheFreneticist,2,Mon Jun 8 13:15:14 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I picked up a x100T for a walking around camera and street lens. Much, much, much smaller and takes great shots."

Save money elsewhere like buying used lenses not a cheap battery.  http://www.howtogeek.com/172680/danger-why-you-shouldnt-buy-cheap-third-party-batteries-for-laptops-or-smartphones/
Nikon,39083d,slimspidey,2,Mon Jun 8 11:48:21 2015 UTC,I have used a third party battery and have many OEM batteries. The third party doesn't last half as long as the OEM.

Nikon,38yfhr,SausageLegs,11,Sun Jun 7 22:21:39 2015 UTC,I love my little Nikon 35mm f/1.8. It's Achilles' heel is shooting into the light or almost into the light. It will get light spoilage and low contrast shots if the sun is anywhere near the edge of your frame. The micro hood it comes with doesn't block much.  See how both lenses do shooting into the light or nearly so.   Edit: I was thinking about the DX 35mm ƒ/1.8 G. Still might want to test them into the light.
Nikon,38yfhr,KaJashey,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:10:32 2015 UTC,Looks like you're speaking of the DX version. OP is asking advice on the FX version of the 35mm 1.8G.

The Sigma seems to edge out in T-stops and Chromatic Aberration. The Sigma is rated sharper but, it isn't by much. If you are using a 24MP camera you are out-resolving them anyways.   Might also note that the Sigma performs best wide open and the Nikon performs best when stopped down just a tad to f/2.  If price isn't a concern, I would do some shallow-DOF tests, and pick the one with the Bokeh I liked better. If you want to save some money, you aren't losing much by picking the Nikon.

As per DxO's tests, the Sigma resolves 30 P-mpix* on a D810 and 19P-Mpix on a D610. Pixel count and strength of a low pass filter will matter for just about any lens.  *P-mpix is DxO' own term."

Nikon,38yfhr,Sardonnicus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:23:36 2015 UTC,Yes.  I am aware.  But the majority of the people who purchase the sigma F/1.4 art lenses do so because the cost of the nikon equivalent lenses are so high.  I've never really seen people compare Sigma's art lenses to Nikons 1.8G lenses because they are very similar and the Nikons are cheaper.  The Sigma art lenses are a direct competitor to Nikon's F/1.4G lenses.  This is all I was trying to point out.
Nikon,38yfhr,W00ster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"Got it, sorry I misunderstood what you wrote. I believe some people actually prefer the 1.8g over the 1.4g, some say it is actually sharper. This is the reason I did this comparison. I will have to do some more tests, especially wide open."

Fact is not many if any of you could tell me which image was taken with which lens if you were presented with two identical images taken with two different lenses nor tell me what the difference is.    And if sharpness is what you need so desperately, none of these lenses are what you should get although I am fairly sure nothing you shoot demands the level of quality you pursue.    In many ways, these primes have become a fetish with many and if you do not tow the party line, you are ostracized.    Much more important than the quality of these lenses, is the quality of your photography, maybe that is an area to focus on rather? It really doesn't matter one iota which one of these two lenses you buy, your pictures will not become better with one chosen over the other."

The used lenses you're looking at are all older models that have no built in autofocus motor, and your D5500 has no focusing motor, so you would need to autofocus manually.  That is no fun.  Don't waste your money on those lenses.  Instead, pick up a prime lens like the Nikon 35/1.8 DX for which will give you the flexibility to shoot in low light and do portraits, things which your 18-55 isn't meant for.

I think I'll stick to both of your advice and look for a prime lens for my next one, and get as much practice as I can in with the kit lens (and you're right, it is decent to get me started - but you're also right about the lens envy thing!

Nikon,38wlzq,leeunleashed,2,Mon Jun 8 04:04:47 2015 UTC,Dont get that bundle the 70-300 isnt that great. I would suggest gaining experience from your kit lens first and maybe get a prime 35mm or 50mm 1.8
Nikon,38wlzq,timdesuyo,2,Sun Jun 7 22:58:27 2015 UTC,"If you have the 5500, then start looking at your primes - 35mm f/1.8 DX, 50mm, 85mm, 105mm, and 20mm."

Not only can I not a afford an 80-400, it'd just be too big to lug around an airshow all day (and I wouldn't want to be burdened by a tripod).  So the 70-300 definitely has a place, and I'm not sure what would be better."
Nikon,38xvbv,gb0n,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I have a 28-300 f/3.5-5.6 which I absolutely love. It's a bit more expensive but it is such a great all round lens it can hardly be beaten."
Nikon,38xvbv,W00ster,2,Mon Jun 8 20:28:34 2015 UTC,"I took one of the best shots of my life at an airshow this spring with the 70-300. I took a lot of disappointing shots too but that's more because airshows are challenging to shoot depending on what the sun, clouds, smoke and atmosphere are doing, than the fault of the lens. I'm very happy with my 70-300, and I have a 70-200/4 too to compare with - it's not perfect and has some limitations you have to be aware of and work around but what do you expect from a budget telephoto zoom lens? If I'm shooting at 300mm I stop down to f/8 and live with a slower SS or higher ISO and a few extra thousand dollars in my pocket.  I think the author used the wrong camera and lens combo - they would have done better with a D7200 and 70-200/4. That gets you to a 300mm equivalent and let's you shoot all day long at f/4 which nets you a stop faster shutter speed at the same ISO, or the same shutter speed at a stop less ISO (which cancels out the fx noise advantage of the D750) or two stops if you're shooting the 70-300 at f/8 at 300mm to increase its sharpness like you should be doing when you're using that lens."

Nikon,38udls,Akhalyndra,2,Sun Jun 7 16:41:50 2015 UTC,I would use a good quality UV-filter on my lens for this. Cleaning an UV-Filter is much easier in my opinion.
Nikon,38udls,geekygeekz,2,Tue Jun 9 12:38:07 2015 UTC,You should never be using a lens pen. All those to is smear gunk around on your lens and is abrasive to the coating.  The small amount of moisture from your breath is also fairly acidic and also degrades the coating on your lens.  I use Carl Ziess cleaning wipes. They are honestly the best thing I've ever used on my lenses--I even use them with my eyeglasses. You can buy 200 wipes for about $15 on amazon.
Nikon,38udls,Akhalyndra,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:58:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips! Ordering some ASAP!
Nikon,38udls,geekygeekz,2,Sun Jun 7 01:26:02 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. Also look into investing in a Giottos Rocket Air Blaster. I use a large one myself, but it might be a little big for traveling. These are to be used before wiping anything down to remove any harmful debris that could be potentially ""dragged"" across your glass--and any time throughout the wiping process. You never want to use those compressed air cans as you can accidentally shoot up liquid and harm your camera, or degrade the coating on the lens as it's an aerosol propellant gas that is spraying a lot more than air at your equipment.  When you use the wipes: I recommend leaving it folded to get most of the gunk off. Then you can grab ahold of one of the corners, wave it around, and it will unfold. The wipe will dry with use and when it's completely dry is when you can take care of any streaking you might have caused... keep in mind anything you might have used on your lens might cause a lot of smearing when you first use these wipes, so feel free to use a couple of wipes on your initial cleaning.  With good lighting and mediocre technique, you can make your lenses look like they're coming off the factory line.  You shouldn't worry much about actually getting the chlorine off your lens--it should come right off. Be gentle when using your wipes. Chlorine is a pain to get off, but most AR coatings are strong enough to handle the small amount that is safe for people to swim in. Concentrated chlorine might be another story...."

It was a big challenge with the D300, but now that I'm over the learning curve, the  D750 has really stepped up to the plate.  If you haven't, give highlight-weighted metering a shot. It prevents blowouts and, if you're shooting in auto ISO, keeps the noise down as well.  There's enough dynamic range available to pull a lot out of the shadows.  There's a D750 group on FB that's worth joining, too."

Nikon,38ov4x,thachowda,5,Fri Jun 5 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"Some general astrophotography tips:   Shoot as wide of an angle as possible (something close to 11 mm would be best for an APS-C sensor, in my opinion), unless you have something specific in mind Always use full manual (including white balance) Shoot in daylight white balance Unless you want star trails, do not use an exposure longer than 400 / focal length = seconds (example: 400 / 18mm = 22 seconds) 400 is a compensated value for an APS-C sensor (or cut that time in half if you're a pixel peeper) Shoot at your widest aperture (f/2.8 or f/3.5, etc.) Find a distant lit object to autofocus on (the moon or a distant light are excellent) before you point at the stars (then make sure you are in manual focus mode) An ISO between 800 - 6400 is perfectly normal (depending on the desired clarity, brightness, and the camera's capabilities) It's usually best to over-expose when you take the shot, then bring the brightness down in post Do a dark frame shot to subtract noise from your photo in post Get some foreground in your shot, it will give scale and focus to the composition Shoot in RAW! It can help you fix any exposure issues after the fact Use the camera's self-timer or intervalometer to allow yourself time to get away from the camera (and tripod) before the shutter opens (if you are touching the camera, it is moving, and it will be noticeable) Don't have any lights around the camera, especially in front or behind (light can pass through the view finder and mess with the exposure)   As an example, a shot I took one a few months ago: http://imgur.com/I13IKVF (very little editing)  So to answer your question, 11 seconds for a 35mm. But your ISO will be close to 6400 if you want it to be bright enough."
Nikon,38ov4x,bobbfwed,3,Fri Jun 5 21:06:04 2015 UTC,"Full frame or crop?  With crop you are looking at around 20 seconds.  With full frame it is around 30 seconds.  Source  Edit (all taken on a D5100):  This is f/2.8, 6400 ISO, 8 sec, 11mm  This is f/2.8, 2000 ISO, 30 sec, 11mm  This is f/2.8, 6400 ISO, 8 sec, 16mm"
Nikon,38ov4x,IDontPlayBaseball,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:36:41 2015 UTC,"Note: I can't open your images on mobile.   I would say 20 seconds will be too long as the  OP could get star trails.  The old rule of thumb was 500/ focal length => 500/35 = 14 secs.   You use the focal length not including crop as the length of the lens is constant.   If they were to use 35* crop then the time is = 500/ 35*1.5 = 10 seconds.   However,  a lot of places have different rules of thumb.  The lowest I have seen is 200 / focal length.    Basically,  the OP knows that they have to try somewhere between 5 and 20 seconds. However,  I'm thinking it will be around 10 seconds.  The OP could use deep sky stacker if they want more light,  however,  in my opinion,  this could be overkill."

Here is a shot taken years ago with a Nikon D700 with a Tokina 11-16mm (DX lens but 16mm works on FX) @ f/2.8 for 25 seconds: http://i.imgur.com/WbHulKE.jpg. If I gave you the full resolution, you would see a tiny bit of trailing. This was one of the first ones I ever took and I found that 20 seconds seems to be the limit with a super wide lense. Though do as I say not as I do because here is another taken at 25s too :P http://i.imgur.com/BePH8NO.jpg. Same gear, just much more recent.  If you want to go longer, you will need a telescope mount that tracks. For example, here is a composite of 27 images, each 120s exposure @ ISO 3200: http://i.imgur.com/Y07ORRL.jpg. These were taken through a 570mm achromatic refractor telescope.   To answer you question, 35mm is pretty narrow for astrophotography without tracking. You will get trailing probably more than 10 seconds of exposure. Open that lens up as fast as it can go, put your ISO as high as youre willing to go for noise, and fire away!"

Nikon,38jcby,Capt_methane,5,Thu Jun 4 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"You're going to have a bit of trouble finding a real FX wide angle lens that is useful as a true DX wide angle lens and vice versa.  The problem is that a crop sensor needs a much shorter lens in order to get the same angle of view, a wide angle lens for FX on a DX body is really going to be more of a mid-range zoom lens especially at the long end.  So unless you want to spend big bucks and buy a lens that is worth 10x what your D3100 is worth you're very limited in what you can do.  If this is the case, I'd just make the leap and buy your FX body now since it will cost about the same amount as any of the Nikon wide angle lenses other than the 16-35mm f/4!  The 18-55mm kit lens isn't that bad optically and can't be beaten for the price.  What is it about the lens that you don't like in particular?  I don't use mine much anymore because I don't tend to use a lens in that range at all, I'd sooner just use my 35mm f/1.8 instead but I'm not planning on throwing it away either, it's light and fine for snapshots, also I don't have to worry about breaking it since it's pretty cheap to replace if I had to.  Proper wide angle lenses are expensive in general and very expensive for FX so be sure you really want the upgrade before you bite.  I have a Tokina 11-16mm which I use with my D7000 and D7200 and I'm very happy with it, I've looked at a lot of the other wide angle lenses for DX sensors and the field is pretty shallow.  You either can find a less expensive lens with flaws, and expensive lens that is DX only, or a ridiculously expensive lens that isn't that wide on DX but can be used on a FX body but there are no real steals.  If you're thinking of this Tamron lens: http://www.dpreview.com/lensreviews/tamron_10-24_3p5-5p6_n15 be aware that it's DX only."

Nikon,38jcby,veepeedeepee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:38:41 2015 UTC,"The old 18-35D's not bad, either.  Distortion is a little weird at the wide end and it's slower, but it's very light and a hair sharper."
Nikon,38jcby,Blrfl,2,Thu Jun 4 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"If you are aiming at an FX body, get the 14-24mm f/2.8.   This is what a 90 degree angled building looks like at 14mm!"
Nikon,38jcby,W00ster,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:37:36 2015 UTC,/u/pasmeh did some brilliant photos on this sub with the Nikon 20mm ƒ/1.8 g on a crop camera.  When you get to FX it would be much wider.  Otherwise look at some of the Tokina FX lenses.
Nikon,38jcby,KaJashey,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"I support the 20mm, but you might look at the f/2.8 as a cost saving measure."
Nikon,38jcby,timdesuyo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:29:23 2015 UTC,"What I'm after is a wide angle lens that I'll be able to transfer over to my next FX body when I upgrade next year.   You're going to have to compromise... The Tamron you listed will not transfer to FX (you can use it on FX bodies but the body will go int o DX mode so a 24MP FX D750 will shoot like a 10MP DX camera when using the lens).  Ultra wide is not very transferable. You could get a 16-35mm-ish FX lens, but 16mm is not nearly as wide on a DX body. It's easier with Telephoto as there are more FX telephoto options and they'll good on a DX body as well, but an FX wide angle put on a DX body is pretty close to a normal focal length.  What is your issue with your 18-55mm? If it is not wide enough for you, you probably want something closer to an Tokina 11-16mm or something like that. My best advice would be to see if you can find a used lens, that way you can sell it for nearly the same price next year, if and when you upgrade."
Nikon,38f2gj,T00dd,9,Wed Jun 3 20:04:47 2015 UTC,This camera should have been rated higher. Who cares about video. If I wanted a DSLR for video I would have bought a Canon. This is the best crop sensor Nikon of all time.
Nikon,38f2gj,CFster,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:20:45 2015 UTC,"-It's not a big upgrade from the D7100.  -The video performance is subpar, compared to other cameras in this price range. Nikon is touting the D7200 as a ""great"" video camera, so Nikon is inviting this criticism. Nikon cares about video because their marketing campaigns focus on it.  -The Canon 7D II is a superior, all-around camera.  -Doesn't have USB 3 support, like other Nikon cameras.  -No touchscreen, like other Nikon cameras."
Nikon,38f2gj,inhplease,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess if you count going from Expeed 3 to Expeed 4, three times higher ISO performance, three times larger buffer and more advanced AF processor not much of an upgrade than so be it.   And, I don't see video performance being much of a headline on their product page --> http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/dslr-cameras/D7200.html  The D7200's IQ is generally considered to be better than the Canon's 7D Mark II in tests. As far as I'm concerned the only edge the Canon has is FPS. I'm talking about taking pictures. As I said before, I could care less about video. My dream D400 wouldn't even have video, or Live View either. Give it 10 FPS, with the 7200 sensors and I'm good.   And who the hell wants a touch screen on a camera like this. I use mine outside for sports, racing and air shows. Most of the time I can't even see the screen anyway, because the sun is so bright."
Nikon,38f2gj,CFster,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"You are obviously a Nikon ""fanatic"". Most reviewers of the D7200 mention that it's not a huge upgrade from the D7100. The improvements might be important to you, but most people will not look at this camera as a radical update from the D7100.  Nikon portrays the D7200 as a great video shooter. On the page you gave, the word ""video"" is mentioned seven times and that page markets the camera to videographers. The D7200 video performance is pedestrian.  The Canon 7D II has many advantages over the D7200 for photographers:  -More cross-type focus points (65 vs 15)  -More focus points (65 vs 51)  -Faster continuous shooting (10fps vs 6fps)  -Has a GPS unit which automatically geotags your photos  Sure, the D7200 gives you slightly more megapixels and better dynamic range, but for photographers there is more to a camera than how many megapixels it has."
Nikon,38f2gj,inhplease,3,Sun Jun 7 22:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yes I am a Nikon fanboi. Get over it. My original post didn't even mention the 7D, you had to bring a $600 more expensive camera into the discussion. Who came to argue Nikon vs. Canon? As you say there's more to life than megapixels, well I'm saying there's more to life than cross type AF points ok?   My argument still stands. This is the best crop sensor camera Nikon has ever produced. The 7100 received a higher rating from DPReview and there's a massive thread going on over there as to why."
Nikon,38f2gj,CFster,-1,Sun Jun 7 23:25:06 2015 UTC,"What are you even talking about. Video is becoming more and more of a thing nowadays. You're essentially saying  that since another camera company already beated someone at something, they themselves shouldn't improve their own technology. Nikon does need to step up their video game, which they're (very) slowly doing. But this new Nikon camera just doesn't cut it."
Nikon,38f2gj,9Hotshot7,5,Thu Jun 4 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"I think he's saying that the D7200 is, or at least should be, recognized first as a crop sensor still camera.  It shouldn't be expected to record amazing video any more than a video camera should be expected to capture amazing stills.  He isn't saying that Nikon should give up on video or refuse to improve it, but that they should continue to primarily focus on producing incredible still cameras.  In fact, I think it's pretty clear that Nikon isn't concerned with creating a DSLR that can record amazing video anyway."
Nikon,38f2gj,nowmakeyourthrowaway,2,Thu Jun 4 07:53:40 2015 UTC,"That mindset makes sense, and I'll let you have the first half of your argument but to say Nikon isn't concerned in making a DSLR that records good video is nonsense. The D750 was a real testimony that Nikon is coming into the space by adding a 'flat' video profile, tilting screen, and introduced a ""filmmakers"" kit with it. They, just as Canon did, want to create a kick-ass camera that does both stills and video because that's where our industry is going towards."
Nikon,38f2gj,9Hotshot7,3,Mon Jun 8 20:36:23 2015 UTC,Love mine like none other!
Nikon,38f2gj,sky1193,3,Wed Jun 3 23:46:26 2015 UTC,I find it amusing that one of the negatives points is it's AF could potentially not be as good because it's not a mirrorless camera.
Nikon,38f2gj,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Thu Jun 4 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"For me it's the D750 for FX and the D7200 for DX. Had the pleasure of handling both with some excellent lenses and they both perform really well. Honestly, unless you absolutely need a FX camera or have the extra cash on hand I would go for the D7200 every time."
Nikon,38f2gj,Panigg,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:54:16 2015 UTC,"Did you had a chance to try and compare D7000 with D7200? Especially size and handling? I'm thinking about upgrading to 7200, FX is tempting but I'd have to throw away quite a lot of good glass. Besides I'm getting old and I started to look for something smaller and lighter. I tried J4 and loved its portability, but J is nowhere close do DSLR when taking pictures."
Nikon,38f2gj,Panigg,2,Thu Jun 4 11:23:53 2015 UTC,D7200 and D7000 are the same body if you only compare the dimensions. The D7200 feels slightly lighter. Handling is pretty much the same with minor improvements.   The D7200's advantage is in it's technical aspects.
Nikon,38f2gj,Prequalified,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"After handling the D5500, D7200 and D750 I was really disappointed that Nikon didn't just put a crop sensor into a D750 body and call it the D7200. The grip on both the D750 and D5500 is so much deeper and feels much better in the hand. I don't mind a small grip on a small body but the D7200 is pretty thick."

I carried all of that gear around the UK for more than two weeks and holy cow my back was tired. Everyone says to take only one or two lenses out for the day--but I can't tell you how many times I shot the same thing with at least two lenses...  Who knows if I ever will get back there again--and I'm not going to get home and say, ""Dang...I wish I would have shot Westminster Abbey with my 14-24, but it was back in my hotel"".

They look awesome on my nice 4k monitor, but when I upload them, something changes and they seem to loose a bit of their color.  I think it happens when I save in JPG.  But yes, this lens is a monster and you will want to spend lots of time with it.  After getting the 14-24, 24-70 and 70-200 f/2.8 lenses, I use the 70-200 the most.  I never thought that would be the case, but it is.  The FOV compression is so nice.  You are going to love it."
Nikon,38aeeh,dk-n-dd,4,Tue Jun 2 22:47:38 2015 UTC,"Use it as it is. Oil, fat, graphite and stuff, are only gonna mess things up.  If you are looking for a manual focus lens, with a longer, smoother pull. Take a look at some old German or Japanese lenses, with suitable adapters."
Nikon,38aeeh,OM3N1R,4,Tue Jun 2 23:06:48 2015 UTC,Get an old manual nikkor 50 1.8. That are cheap on eBay and have super smooth focus pull. I have 2 now somehow and both are buttery.
Nikon,38aeeh,Moice,3,Wed Jun 3 02:58:48 2015 UTC,"You do not want to do this, at least if you want that lens to remain functional.  Regardless of condition, the golden rule of lens ownership and manitainence is to keep foreign matter out - not to introduce foreign matter in."

I think the improvement you'd need to make would be in the gearing... mine feels like the gears don't fit together as snugly was they do on the proper MF lenses, and no amount of grease is gonna plug the cap.

Nikon,389fem,MustangSense,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:56:19 2015 UTC,Good to know.  This was what I was concerned about.
Nikon,3875nd,nowmakeyourthrowaway,3,Tue Jun 2 09:42:15 2015 UTC,"Avoid the ""one lens to rule them all"" mentality. Different lenses have different advantages and disadvantages. You don't buy and SLR to pick on lens and stick to it, you buy an SLR so you can change lenses to fit different needs. I understand you want to use it for traveling and don't want to carry 10lbs of lenses, but hear me out...  First off, unless your front element looks like you took sandpaper to it, I doubt your 18-200mm would be improved by buying a new 18-200mm as lenses really don't degrade much in that fashion (if you have the older 18-200mm VR and you upgrade to the 18-200mm VR II it might be a little better but not drastic).  However the 18-200mm is a GREAT lens to help you determine what your next lens you add to your collections should be. You're also using Lightroom which helps a lot in this process.  Look at your favorite photos and see what focal length you've used for them. Or you can go the other way and look at all your photos and bring up the library filter and change the first column to ""Lens"" and set it to the 18-200mm and then set the second column to ""focal length"" and choose select different focal lengths. Ideally what you're looking for is photos that you like the composition and perspective, but just wish it had a missing ""Something"" (more shallow DOF, less noise, more sharpness/pop). See if you find a focal length that you gravitate to.  If for example you find yourself gravitating to 35mm a lot, you could pick up a 35mm f/1.8 DX for around $200 new and it isn't that big or heavy. It can be added into your bag for those times where you need low light performance or a touch more micro-contrast/punch. If you like being around 85mm, you could look at an 85mm f/1.8.  If you find that you're regularly at the 18mm and wish it could go a little wider, perhaps the 16-85 would be a good option. You can also look to see how much you shoot at 85-200mm to get an idea of what you'd be missing.  In the end being limited can be freeing and let you be more creative.  I just went on a trip to Asia and I brought my full backpack with lenses: 14-24, 50mm, 28-105mm, and 80-200mm (Equivalent to 10-16mm, 35mm, 18-70mm, and 55-135mm on DX), plus a flash and some extra stuff. I knew that backpack was going to be too much to lug around most of the time, so packed a smaller bag where I could fit the camera, and 1 lens plus the 50mm, and maybe the flash. On different days I'd alternate between the 14-24 and the 50mm or the 80-200mm and the 50mm. I'd get the best shots I could on with the lenses I had on a given day. If I had the wide angle and couldn't zoom in as much, I'd take it as a challenge to get it the best way I could (some shots I had to crop in a bit after). Same when I only had the telephoto and wish I had a wider lens, I'd find a different way to shoot it (and if I needed to I'd shoot several shoot several shots with the 50mm so that I could stitch a panorama later). It worked out very well."
Nikon,3875nd,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Tue Jun 2 18:33:54 2015 UTC,This is great advice!  Thank you!  I will definitely dig through my catalog and find out what my preferred focal lengths are.

When I was shooting Dx bodies, this lens was so vital to my day to day photo shoots that I owned two of them, with one of these as a backup.  It's large and heavy, but worth what it costs, especially if you find a clean used one."
Nikon,3875nd,dread_pirate_ryan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:37:17 2015 UTC,I second that picked mine up for $650 used but totally rebuilt by nikon. It's a great lens and pretty much only comes off my D7200 for my 70-200 to go on it. The range is pretty good for most situations unless the subject is pretty far away. It's pro build quality and is a great chunk of glass. It doesn't have VR but the 2.8 aperture and wide angle kind of makes up for that.
Nikon,3875nd,timdesuyo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:14:06 2015 UTC,Great except the 3rd party alternatives to that particular lens are way cheaper and just as good.
Nikon,3875nd,dread_pirate_ryan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:39:17 2015 UTC,Never said it was better or cheaper.  I agree the 3rd party options are excellent.  They are not in the same league as the Nikon in terms of build quality though.  Just another option for OP to consider.
Nikon,3875nd,timdesuyo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on the lens, but I have to disagree with that. The Sigma Art and Zeiss lenses particularly are built as good as anything out there."
Nikon,3875nd,merkucjo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:42:34 2015 UTC,I thought we were comparing 3rd party options to the Nikon 17-55mm?  Show me the Sigma or Zeiss AF option that is comparable in terms of build quality.  I'm not aware of it.
Nikon,3875nd,ooburai,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:08:35 2015 UTC,"Really the only ""build quality"" shortcoming that the Sigma and Tamron have compared to the Nikon is that the Nikon is an internal zoom, so it is going to be better dust/water resistant.   But yeah, I took it to mean in general, not this lens specifically."
Nikon,3875nd,merkucjo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:19:46 2015 UTC,What is iq in lens ?
Nikon,3875nd,sushimpp,3,Sun Jun 14 23:37:22 2015 UTC,"The 18-200mm is a good lens.  I own it, but I admit I don't use it much any more.  I can't honestly say that I've got many complaints about it, it's usable at all focal lengths, and it's pretty sharp, it's got a weather seal, and it's fast enough for vacation type photography.  I've even used it at some sporting events and not been disappointed.  The biggest complaint I have about it is just that it's bulky.  Still, every time I think about selling it I convince myself not to because if I'm travelling having it and a 35mm or 50mm f/1.8 pretty much has me covered for all situations I'm likely to encounter without having to carry too much kit.  Even then though I'll mostly just use the fixed lens.  You're never going to be completely happy with a superzoom lens, you're asking for a lot from the optics.  I'd much sooner look at a good fixed lens (or two) than another zoom lens trying to cover parts of that range."
Nikon,3875nd,timdesuyo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:11:51 2015 UTC,I also don't know why people don't like 18-200
Nikon,3875nd,TakaKe,3,Sun Jun 14 23:38:40 2015 UTC,I have found the 16-85 to be stellar and the range incredibly useful
Nikon,3875nd,timdesuyo,5,Wed Jun 3 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"Tamron 17-50 f/2.8.  The 18-200 is a crap lens. It makes your expensive sensor look like a disposable camera.   Anything 3.5-5.6 is going to be of limited usability in any other conditions besides in daylight outside. Generally, the more the variability in the focal length, the more compromises in image quality you are going to have to make.   The Tamron 17-50 is an excellent lens. I used it for years."
Nikon,3875nd,TakaKe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:39:36 2015 UTC,The Sigma 17-50 is better made than the Tamron.
Nikon,3875nd,timdesuyo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:39:09 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with the Sigma - They turned the corner after I had purchased my 17-50, so I'm willing to believe that theirs is a good buy. I know their 35mm is excellent."
Nikon,3875nd,TakaKe,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:28:58 2015 UTC,"I've had both Tamron and Sigma 17-50's, the Sigma's is much better made."
Nikon,3875nd,merkucjo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that because the Tamron uses a different kind of plastic, and the Sigma is heavier, or did you have some usage issue?"
Nikon,382s4u,nowmakeyourthrowaway,3,Mon Jun 1 13:08:02 2015 UTC,"I just used this feature on my D7100 and Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8. I was missing shots and couldn't figure out why.  I think the wideness of the focal length was throwing me off when it came to diagnosing the issue.  I did a close up shot of a page of text with camera on a tripod and using a single focus point.  I found the that the lens was front focusing and decided to play around with the AF Fine Tune.    It was a painless process, just had to dig out the manual and read up on it.  I used the page of text again as my scale but you can download a proper focusing scale from the interwebs for free.  Now I have a lens profile for the Tokina saved into the D7100 and any shots I miss are operator error.  I'd say go for it!  It's great having my wide lens back in the camera bag..."
Nikon,382s4u,gestatin,3,Mon Jun 1 13:30:08 2015 UTC,I never looked into this setting but now that I read this I feel like my focus has been off and I didnt know. I had kind of been disappointed in this new AF system. I may play around with this a bit now and see if it answers my issues.
Nikon,382s4u,Elderain,3,Mon Jun 1 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"This feature was very handy and all of my lenses had an adjustment of some kind. You have to remember, with zoom lenses the AF fine tune isn't the same from one extreme to the other. Everything changes internally on the lens as you zoom. There are a couple strategies I read about, and found that could be helpful.   Fine tune for the mid-point of the zoom range. This can help, but both the extremes may be slightly off.  FT for the long end, because you generally shoot wide with more DOF, making the exact focus less of an issue."
Nikon,382s4u,Thumper13,2,Mon Jun 1 21:21:10 2015 UTC,My experience is that it is needed with this series of cameras. I don't know if the phase detect system has just gotten complicated enough or if they didn't to finishing touches at the factory because AF-fine tune is included. Whatever it's needed on this series of cameras much much more than the previous similar level D90.  I have a bunch of lenses and have done AF fine tune with all of them. That's fine. Each of them has it's own saved value except third party lenses -- those I just dial in after changing.  Primary lens at the moment is a Tokina 100mm macro. +4 Af-fine tune. Derived this number not with a test chart but doing portraits wide open and looking at front eye sharpness.
Nikon,382s4u,KaJashey,2,Mon Jun 1 13:50:33 2015 UTC,"I did it using my 35mm 1.8G Nikkor on my newly acquired D7k. I was out of focus for a lot of shots, and it was driving my OCD up the wall. I read about the AF-Fine Tune setting, and realized that could solve my problem. Brought it down to about -4, and it was tack sharp.   Try fiddling with the AF-Fine Tune more on your D72k, you might have better luck with getting your focus spot on. There should be no problems between the lens and the body."
Nikon,382s4u,Spearhead90,2,Mon Jun 1 15:31:37 2015 UTC,"I absolutely had to use fine tune for each lens.  I primarily use a Sigma 17-50 f2.8 but also have a couple primes / zooms.  Every camera will have different requirements for fine tune, some smaller and some larger.  If you can't get it in focus using fine tune adjustments then there may be something up with your camera body but I would check out some tuning guides before jumping to that conclusion.  Edit: D7100 here"
Nikon,382s4u,brancky3,2,Mon Jun 1 17:49:13 2015 UTC,Does the camera remember the settings for multiple lenses and auto-load them when it recognizes that the lens is attached?
Nikon,382s4u,immortalreddit,2,Mon Jun 1 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The D7100 saves settings for 20 lenses, I believe."
Nikon,382s4u,lukejc1,2,Mon Jun 1 18:46:55 2015 UTC,Third party lenses it can't seem to tell the difference between the same manufacturer. So if you have 2 Tokinas or something it seems to have trouble telling them apart and changing the value.  You can go in and change the value but it likes to be dumb with more than one third party lens.
Nikon,382s4u,KaJashey,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:33:43 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll have to do this with my D7100.
Nikon,382s4u,immortalreddit,2,Mon Jun 1 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"It should remember the individual lenses, so you adjust it as necessary for each lens."
Nikon,382s4u,timdesuyo,2,Tue Jun 2 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"I definitely needed it with 3rd party lenses and cheaper Nikon glass.  I've just complete fine tuning my lenses for my D7200. I found a great chart that helps in the process. I recommend patience and testing in increments of +/-5 and fine tune as you get closer. I've found no ""quick"" way of achieving the sharpness I was seeking. Primes are the easier of the two. With zoom lenses, I've read to get your setting worked out at the aperture and focal length most used. I'm still fine tuning the fine tuning."
Nikon,382s4u,EWChomp,2,Tue Jun 2 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"thank you for pointing this out - i always have issues focusing my D7100 and never knew about this, many thanks!"
Nikon,382s4u,braelynjane,2,Tue Jun 2 06:47:55 2015 UTC,My pleasure.  It was driving me insane at first.  It reminded me of my first time using a DSLR when I took 5 pictures on manual and was convinced that it sucked and that my point and shoot was better.  I hope you get some good results now.
Nikon,382s4u,lukejc1,2,Tue Jun 2 08:48:18 2015 UTC,LensAlign is a pretty creative and helpful tool for easily making AF adjustments.  It's expensive but it saved me a lot of time. http://michaeltapesdesign.com/lensalign.html

Nikon,3817f6,janesmb,3,Mon Jun 1 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"Well, with a 100mm lens the boat will be twice as big, at 200mm it will be four times as big and at 300mm it will be six times as big.   The usual starter suggestions for longer zoom lenses is:   55-200 f/4-5.6 DX - cheapest, smallest and lightest 55-300 f/4-5.6 DX - a bit more range for a bit more money and size 70-300 f/4.5-5.6 VR - good bit bigger, heavier and more expensive but much better AF performance   All three are slow, variable aperture zooms and are a little soft wide open at their longest focal lengths but are otherwise excellent lenses.  If you have more money in the budget and more specific needs there's a lot of options out there but the price goes up rapidly."
Nikon,3817f6,r_golan_trevize,2,Mon Jun 1 03:30:51 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for those suggestions as well as the math for estimating size increases.
Nikon,3817f6,partickle,2,Mon Jun 1 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"I've recommended it before and I'll recommend it again. Grab yourself a Tamron 70-300 f/4-5.6 VC. The price you pay for the sharpness and insane Image Stabilisation is unbelievable. I say forget the 55-200/55-300 kit zooms. The front element rotates, the autofocus is slow, and the sharpness isn't all there. How much more of a lens could you need? The effective focal range on this bad boy is 105-450mm on full frame. Eat your heart out. $450.  Source: experience. I used the Nikon 55-300 fo the World Junior Curling Championships in Estonia and it delivered some of my best images. The auto focus is slow though, and it just wasn't worth risking trying my luck again at the World MENS Curling Championships the next month. So I upgraded to a Tamron 70-300 (For the same price mind you), and I haven't looked back since."
Nikon,3817f6,timdesuyo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the suggestion, particularly since you've used both lenses."
Nikon,3817f6,partickle,2,Mon Jun 1 03:52:58 2015 UTC,"The 70-300 has it's weaknesses. If you are interested in spending a bit of money, the 80-200 f/2.8 Nikon is a night-and-day improvement. If you want to get out to 300, then you might look at the 300mm f/4 ED."
Nikon,3817f6,timdesuyo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:05:02 2015 UTC,"Well, that can be said about the 80-200 too. You just tossed a bunch of lenses out to name them and then didn't elaborate on why. Like, why is it a night and day improvement? Image quality? Autofocus? Number of elements in the barrel? Sharpness? Definitely not for the cost.   As well, the 300 f/4 is a nice one but why do you recommend it? Is it cheap, is it 300, is it because it's a nikon product, or simply for the focal length?  I sincerely ask these questions, I haven't used these lenses and want to know what they are like."
Nikon,3817f6,SonicShitStorm,2,Mon Jun 1 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"The 80-200 is sharper, has better-looking distortion,better contrast, less chromatic aberration, and less smearing. Also, it's a much larger aperture so you can use it under other conditions beyond outside-during-the-day, and since you are shooting DX, you will be using the center of the glass, which is the highest quality bit. The 300 f/4 is tack-sharp wide open, and takes teleconverters pretty well if you want to get more reach during the daytime. It's really expensive to get a decent lens at 300mm, and the f/4 is a good compromise between budget and reach."

There's probably 0% chance this is a firmware mistake, and probably 100% chance you're hitting the buttons wrong or putting the settings wrong.

Or, if you can afford it and the satisfaction of owning it brings you enough happiness then it might be worth it.

Nikon,37y8h7,r_golan_trevize,2,Sun May 31 15:12:28 2015 UTC,Yeah 300 is too good to pass up. I'll get the sigma later if I'm not happy with the Nikon.
Nikon,37y8h7,SausageLegs,2,Sun May 31 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"Sigma Art all the way. I use it for mostly filming with my D750, but often use it for portraits as well. Whether it's worth the splurge compared to the Nikon is up to you. The way it renders colors, sharpness, and superb build quality was well worth the money to me."

I don't consider $700 (75% more) ""pretty close.""  Nikon does still make the AI 35mm f/1.4 which is pretty close in price to the Sigma but that design is quite old (I don't think it's as sharp wide open but I could be mistaken) and more importantly it does not have autofocus."

Nikon,37x0zp,jgilbs,3,Sun May 31 02:53:33 2015 UTC,"You probably can get by with only prime. 85mm for portraits and 35mm or 50mm for street.  But...... honestly, I myself could not do without my trusty Tamron 24-70... I just like having the zoom when shooting live stuff. It's a bit on the heavy side but you'll always have your 50 if you want something lighter and more discreet for street.  Then you'll need something for portraits, but then again maybe 70mm will suit you just fine for that, I know it does for me most of the time.  All comes down to what you want more!

Nikon,37x0zp,lepermessiah222,3,Sun May 31 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"I own the 85mm 1.8g. There is a noticeable difference in sharpness, the 85 being sharper. But I far prefer the versatility of the Tamron.  Honestly, pretty much any of the newer 1.8G primes are going to be sharper than most zooms, but that doesnt really matter to me.  Cant link photos right now I'm on mobile.  Edit: I should add that both lenses have beautiful contrast and color rendition. The same cannot be said about my 70-200 VR1, for example."
Nikon,37x0zp,HARDCORE-LOL,2,Sun May 31 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"the sigma art is amazing,it is heavy but its far better than the nikon and its cheaper.I have never had focus issue with it (on d750) and if you using it for street photography you'll stop it down so there less of a reason for it to miss focus.The tamron is good more convenient and I really like the colours from it but its nowhere near as sharp as the ART lens (it also slower) and would also be worse for street but with that reach of 70mm I could work for headshots.  I don't think get a 85 would be that good unless you should a lot of headshot"
Nikon,37x0zp,HARDCORE-LOL,2,Sun May 31 03:06:39 2015 UTC,"I should have mentioned I was talking about the nikon 35 1.8, which is actually cheaper than the Sigma. Do you have the tamron and if so, what do you find yourself using it for?"
Nikon,37x0zp,HARDCORE-LOL,2,Sun May 31 03:14:40 2015 UTC,"I have the tamron and I use it mainly for events,I did try using it for street photography and it a good lens but adding that one set of zoom/not know your lens well enough to be able to know your frame made me lose shots.But I still use my sigma 50mm art for a lot evens just because it I know it so well and its so sharp I get better shots out of it.From my use with the sigma 35mm it just as good,if you are getting the nikon 35 1.8 it a lot lighter and little but it comes at the cost of a 1/3 of a stop slower and softer(it also has more distortion)but the nikon is still a good lens"

Nikon,37x0zp,Moonkill1023,2,Sun May 31 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"I'm all about Primes. The sharpness, colour rendition and low apertures just do it for me. Don't get me wrong a zoom is a must and my 16-35mm f4 is beautiful but I can shoot a whole wedding with my 50mm f1.8 and 85mm f1.8 and be very, very happy. Your answer is probably situational but I will always use a zoom for ultra wide, a zoom for ultra long and for the 24-85 range specifically I'll always use the primes. I say spice it up and get a 24mm f1.4."
Nikon,37x0zp,kcdale99,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:59:33 2015 UTC,"Unless you're planning on getting something bundled with the camera, try it with the 50mm for a while and see what you're missing. If you're coming from a DX camera, then you'll find 50mm is an extremely versatile length on FX - might be the only lens you ever need, especially for your street shooting. 50mm on the D750 makes for a very tidy package and is a lot of fun to shoot with.    I love the 24-70/2.8 (Nikon's) on the D750 for my event work (all you have to do is point it in the right direction and it'll get the shot for you) but it's a big, heavy, conspicuous and expensive lens and if I didn't need it for work then I'd be just as happy with the 24-85 or 24-120. I like the convenience of a zoom but you might be happier with a 28 or 35mm prime to give you some wider perspectives.  The 50 will be useful for portraits too, except for tight headshots, for which it's a bit short - that 70-300 will be just fine for that though if you need it."
Nikon,37x0zp,kcdale99,1 point,Sun May 31 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The 50mm is a fantastic lens, often gives me the sharpest images of all my lenses.  I find that with regards to zooms, you have to pay a bit more to get something of any quality.  Upgrading to a D750 showed just how soft my 70-300 zoom was..."
Nikon,37x0zp,W00ster,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:32:17 2015 UTC,Got f1.8 28mm and 85mm. Love these 2 glass. Perfect for street and portrait photography
Nikon,37x0zp,timdesuyo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:35:57 2015 UTC,"This comes down partly to personal style.  Your lens choice effects the look of the image, which really is an aesthetic choice.  I am a wedding photographer, and upgraded to the D750 over the winter... and one thing I have found, for me, is that the D750 screams to be paired with primes.  Its almost a zen like experience shooting the D750 with primes.  The D700 (my previous body) was a heavy, bulky body.  It felt fantastic when attached to the 24-70 or the 70-200 F/2.8s. The whole kit was heavy but solid.  The D750 doesn't feel right attached to them.  The Sigma art lenses are fantastic if you shoot wide open.  Sigma has done something magical with that line of lenses when wide open.  Once they are stopped down a bit they are identical to the Nikon primes.  Pick up a Nikon 85mm F/1.8g, and a Nikon 35mm F/2.  This will leave you enough budget to pick up the Tamron 28-75 F/2.8... You can get the version without the focus motor and save a bit of money if you need to.  The Tamron is great for a walk around lens... but you will find that the 85mm is on your camera 90% of the time.  The D750 + 85mm combo is amazing.  Absolutely amazing."
Nikon,37x0zp,turinturambar81,1 point,Sun May 31 03:26:38 2015 UTC,"I think I am dead set on the 85mm, thats the only one I am for sure about, since i love shooting portraits. I am not so sure about the 35/f2, how does that compare to the 35 1.8 optically?"
Nikon,37x0zp,totallyshould,1 point,Sun May 31 03:33:00 2015 UTC,"Its a price vs functionality analysis.  I never shoot my 35mm wide open due to its nature.  Due to how wide it is, you aren't ever going to get that creamy compressed background bokeh the 85mm gives you, so the 35mm isn't a portrait lens. (This same logic is why you should buy the newer 85mm G version, it kicks the 85mm D's arse wide open). The F/1.8G out performs the F/2 wide open... but by F/4 they are nearly identical optically.  Even wide open you would be hard pressed to tell the difference.  These are both very sharp lenses!  If you want to shoot wide open at 35mm though, I recommend the Sigma Art series. Its a better lens.  So:  Recommend: 35mm F/2 over 35mm F/1.8 as they perform nearly identical in real world use. This is a lens you need occasionally, but won't be a go to for a portrait shooter (on full frame). The 50mm and 85mm are your best portrait lenses. For street photography you will likely be stopped down to F/4 or F/5.6 or smaller where these lenses are nearly identical."
Nikon,37x0zp,turinturambar81,-1,Sun May 31 12:23:31 2015 UTC,is that the D750 screams to be paired with primes. Its almost a zen like experience shooting the D750 with primes.   Sigh... The nonsense I hear some times is just nauseating.

Nikon,37x0zp,Nickibee,1 point,Sun May 31 06:28:19 2015 UTC,"I have decided to get the 24-70 at a later time and hope that when I do make a decision on it, nikon will have released their new rumored 24-70.  Now I know for sure I want the 85mm, because I am just getting into portrait work. I already have a 50mm. I want a 35mm. Question is, 35mm 1.8G, cheaper and lighter vs the 35mm sigma 1.4 heavier and sharper? This would be for street photography, so weight does play a factor."
Nikon,37x0zp,totallyshould,0,Sun May 31 06:34:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I feel a zoom is either your only lens, or a luxury after obtaining a few good primes. My only problem is I wish Nikon would put out a modern prime wider than 24...I will probably get the 17 - 35 f/4 but I'd rather have a 17 f/2.8 or even a 1.8 or 1.4."
Nikon,37x0zp,Nickibee,2,Sun May 31 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"If you want a modern prime that's wider than 24, I have good news- they recently released the 20mm f/1.8: http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-NIKKOR-20mm-f%252F1.8G-ED.html"
Nikon,37w7xx,UsernameUSay,3,Sat May 30 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"Any particular reason for the D700? It's still a fine camera but in all practical respects you'd probably be served just as well by a D7100/7200 or a used/refurbed D600/610.  The D700 is a big, bulky and heavy body with a different control scheme and would not be much fun for travel unless you really need it's heavy duty construction and weather sealing. It may measure a stop better in the lab for ISO performance but in the real world I don't see much advantage over the latest DX sensors which equal or beat it in every other regard and the 24mp FX cameras are clearly superior to it in image quality.   It's a professional workhorse and for people that need its particular toolset, it's still a viable and valuable camera and it's attained a somewhat mythical status, which is why it's still fairly expensive given how old it is - for everyone else, one of Nikon's other cameras would probably suit them better."
Nikon,37w7xx,r_golan_trevize,0,Sun May 31 14:49:58 2015 UTC,The D700 is one of the fastest low light cameras out there that doesn't have a $3000 or higher price tag.  I'll never tell anyone who is thinking of getting one that it is not for them.

Nikon,37w55y,Aaberg123,1 point,Sat May 30 23:46:46 2015 UTC,How would I check if the AF is working accurately?  Sorry I'm new to this
Nikon,37w55y,ooburai,1 point,Sun May 31 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"The short answer is ""does it focus where it should?"" The longer answer depends on how thoroughly you are prepared to test it.  First you need to understand how the camera automatically selects focus points, how the autofocus works, and how you can control it. The manual goes into detail about the AF, and as a neophyte you should read that part closely before testing and critiquing AF performance. Knowing how to guide the camera to focus where you intend will help you know if it's working as it should.  You need to take a variety of images of objects at varying distances, differing contrast levels, and lighting conditions. Using a tripod, or other solid support, will help ensure you are just testing the AF and not your own steadiness, too.  While you may be able to see if the viewfinder image appears in focus, judging the images at full size on a computer screen will be more accurate. However, you can get a feel for how well the AF works by how well it shifts to different points of focus. You can gauge smaller distance changes by simply moving closer and farther from a subject to refocus.  Before you start, you should adjust the viewfinder diopter correction. It's better to do this with the lens cap on, using the digital displays in the finder to assess the adjustment."

The internal program offers all sort of automation like time series. The viewfinder can be closed without a plastic cap, which is very handy in the case you are using a lot tripod. The D810 is a very good camera for landscape and portrait.   I do often taking pictures from polar lights and with just 5s exposure time this camera with the 14mm-24mm lens was the right choice. With the D300s I had at least 25s and with a lot of chromatic noise   The downside:   FX lenses which are good enough for 36MP aren't cheap.   Even when you are able to buy a D810, at least tripple the price to get the complete package of camera, batteries, lenses, filters etc.   i paid for the filter set for my 14-24mm lens 900$, and I got just 4 filters.

(To get an idea of the field of view we're talking about with your D300s, would you be alright if you didn't have anything wider than 24mm?) Landscape thens to want ultra-wide field of view.  Why are you looking at full frame? What do you expect it to give you (you plan on paying quite a bit and giving up some of your lens range, so you better get something for that, right?)  What is frustrating you about the D300s besides low light performance? If it's just low light... what conditions is it most problematic/what kind of shots is the D300's low light capability frustrating you the most with? Could you post a shot you made with the D300s that you wish a new camera would let you do better?"
Nikon,37nvzs,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Fri May 29 11:43:31 2015 UTC,"The ultra-wide's don't really appeal to me too much. As much as I love my 10-20mm Sigma, it's easily replaced with taking a few steps back and possibly sticking images together in post (Lightroom's new features are pretty solid).   Plus the crop mode on the D750 does allow me to use the DX glass, even if I take the MP hit (I think it's 10 or 12 MP in DX mode - not too far off from my D300s really).  I'm looking at going full frame because I'd like the better depth of field when doing portraits, 100% viewfinder (used film for years so the viewfinder on my D300s drives me crazy), and the better performance at higher ISO levels.   What I had trouble with was shooting during a graduation. I didn't want to disrupt the ceremony for others so I used a higher ISO (800) in order to not use a flash. I was able to get some great images, but had some issues with grain at ISO 800. Reduction in PS and LR didn't go too far for me.   Thanks for posing a few questions, made me stop and analyze what I really wanted/really needed. Appreciate that!"
Nikon,37nvzs,_LKB,1 point,Fri May 29 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've got a pretty solid understanding of your needs.  For Nikon FX bodies, my default recommendation is the D750 as it is solid, all-around. If you are super crazy about resolution (I photograph artwork) the D810 is an option but overkill for most. If you are really budget conscious, the D610 is there but if you're that tight with budget I'd take a long hard look as FX is not really for budget conscious people (lenses are more important than the body and lenses aren't exactly cheap).  In regards to the 35-70. It will be an ok ""get-me-by"" zoom. When I started took a similar approach and I got the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 isn't the best lens in the world but it's pretty reasonable and can be picked up for around $200 used. I still keep it around as it focuses pretty close for not-quite-macro work. But I tend to use my 50mm f/1.4D more often (or jump to the 14-24mm or 80-200mm)."
Nikon,37nvzs,_LKB,2,Fri May 29 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"I just switched from a D300s to a D610 about a month ago. I have a 35mm, 50mm and a 70-200 vr2. Definitely a good move for me. I'll be honest I was eyeing that D810 pretty hard, but the price difference was just too much for me to justify right now. The button layout is a little different and there are lots of new features (Hello auto ISO!) But, nothing that's difficult to adjust to. I've also started shooting a lot more video since the D610 does aprox. 20 mins of video, compared to the D300s' 5 mins."
Nikon,37nvzs,jrshaul,1 point,Fri May 29 12:32:03 2015 UTC,I have a video class this semester and the 5min of Video is going to limit me pretty badly. Did not honestly know about that limitation. Thanks!  Also the info about your migration from the D300s to FX gave me some great insight. Thanks!!
Nikon,37nvzs,nygreenguy,1 point,Fri May 29 17:51:35 2015 UTC,Glad to offer my $0.02. When will you make your decision?
Nikon,37nvzs,_LKB,1 point,Sat May 30 03:55:37 2015 UTC,"Another D610 user. Would like to chime in that they're comically cheap - I think I saw $1200 refurbished - and a great camera.  That said, I have seen grey-market D750s for $1500. The question is whether Nikon will provide things like firmware updates, which I heard might be a problem."
Nikon,37nvzs,nygreenguy,1 point,Sat May 30 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"I have a D300 and was looking into getting a 35mm or 50mm. I mostly want one for lower light when we have people over. I wont do any of the 1.4, and cant go over $200. I like the older 50mm 1.8 that is around $120. Any advice?"
Nikon,37nvzs,_LKB,2,Sat Jun 6 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"Um well when I bought my 35mm f2.0 lens I pretty much left my 50mm f1.8 in my bag from that point onwards. The crop factor means that a 35mm is pretty close to a 'traditional' 50mm lens which I loved for simple portraits and street photography. The I don't think there's really much of a difference between an f2 lens and an f1.8, once when you factor in the wider angle...I don't notice it being any slower or darker then my 50mm. All that to say that I like both and depending on your shooting style I think you'll be pleased with the quality of either. Though IMHO if you're 'green' or a newbie to photography I'd urge you to go with a wider angle lens over the longer 50mm to begin with for a couple reasons: It'll force you to get closer, and it allows for 'more' of the scene to be captured (I could probably think of a few more but those are the reasons that come to mind first. Cheers."
Nikon,37nvzs,nygreenguy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"The 35mm I was looking at was the Nikon 35mm f/1.8 DX, as it was in my budget. I can't see a reason to get the f/2, with the cost difference and since I have a DX.   I am somewhat green, but I have had DSLRs for almost 10 years so I do have a bit of experience! The Nikon 50mm I want is right around $100, and the 35mm is $200, both are the same f/1.8 Ugh, I hate having to make these decisions!  Thanks for the advice."
Nikon,37nvzs,_LKB,2,Sat Jun 6 14:36:16 2015 UTC,Well just keep in mind that should you eventually move to FX your DX lenses won't be much use. Let me know what you go with though.
Nikon,37nvzs,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that. If I have the money to upgrade to an FX, then buying another $200 lens shouldn't be a problem."
Nikon,37nvzs,lepermessiah222,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:43:56 2015 UTC,I guess you could see it that way.
Nikon,37nvzs,Blrfl,2,Sun Jun 7 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"I freaking love my D810.  Best DSLR I've ever owned/used.  Better (for me) than the D750, anything from Canon, etc.  I was ready to move to Pentax 645D but this gets me the resolution, DR, gorgeous color and best AF I have ever used with the best lens selection in the world.  I use the Nikkor 200-400mm f4G VR1 with TC-14E II about 80-90% of the time for wildlife action and then a Tamron 24-70mm 2.8 VC SP, Nikkor 50mm 1.8G and a Rokinon 14mm 2.8.  I may get a 70-200 2.8 or 80-400G for lighter weight wildlife shooting.  Anyone who tells you 36MP is overkill is full of shit.  The crop flexibility alone makes this camera an absolute beast with good glass and precision AF fine tune.  I regularly crop over 100% with my 200-400mm and the results still look better than full size stuff from my old Canon 1D4 and 7D2.  I just printed a tiger shot at 20x30"" and a hummingbird at 11x14"" and both easily could have printed to 10x these sizes or larger."
Nikon,37nvzs,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Sat May 30 09:04:56 2015 UTC,"I would skip the D8xx cameras, the 36MP sensor would be, IMO, wasted if you plan on using these older lenses.  I would go with either a D610 or D750. All depends if you need better AF or not. The grip is also much better on the D750. I would suggest you go to your local camera shop and try both.  One thing to keep in mind, these cameras have different button layouts than your D300s. You might even consider a used D700 if you want a camera with a pro layout. Still miles better than your D300s for low light."
Nikon,37nvzs,jassack,1 point,Fri May 29 01:09:57 2015 UTC,"That's a valid point, 36mp might be overkill - but my thought was by going that route, I'm buying myself a few more years of time. Why though would the 36mp be wasted on the older D glass.  I'd prefer better AF, being spoiled with 51 points with my 300s has ruined me!  The D700, while an improvement on my D300s, isn't something I'd consider - mainly because can get more bang for my buck by avoiding it."
Nikon,37nvzs,MagFreakingNeto,5,Fri May 29 01:47:24 2015 UTC,"Don't rule out the 750.  It and the 7200 have the most capable low light AF system Nikon makes.  I have yet to shoot with the 7200, but my 750 turns in some amazing stuff in low light."
Nikon,37nvzs,Blrfl,2,Fri May 29 02:56:34 2015 UTC,"I have a D7200 and D750 - the D7200 low light focus ability is absolutely remarkable and every bit as good as the D750, it's just that its tracking & auto modes aren't quite as rock solid as the D750. Single point though - just fantastic in the dark.  I too would not rule out the D750, especially if you have the budget for a D810 - it's easily Nikon's best all around camera, although the price jump from a D6x0 may not be worth it to many if they don't need the D750's specific features advantages. There's not a lot separating any of them in terms of pure image quality.  Yeah, I wouldn't rule out the D7200 either - significant image quality upgrade from the D300s and almost as good as full frame for a lot less money and you don't have to replace any lenses with more expensive full frame equivalents. It doesn't have the D300's semi-pro body but if you don't need that (I think they're unnecessarily bulky and heavy myself) and the extra FPS then the D7200 is a heck of a camera. The D7200 is my personal camera and I really never miss the D750 from an image quality standpoint, the stuff I really miss about it is the extra features is has, like the enhanced AF, tilt screen and power aperture in liveview/video."
Nikon,37nvzs,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Fri May 29 13:27:23 2015 UTC,"Holy smokes that's some good info!!! I really ruled the 7200 out because it simply has a crop sensor but in retrospect that's pretty ignorant of me.   The price jump from D6X0 to the D750 isn't much in my mind and upon /u/jassack's comment I realized the D750 DID have 51 AF points. Upgrading the lines is a thing I'm working on anyways, the older D glass is a personal favorite of mine so the upgrades aren't as much money as they normally are (compared to AF-S).  The tilt screen is a worry of mine, simply because it is one more part that can break - but as much as you were trying to sell me on the D7200, you've pushed me towards the D750 instead of the D8X0 series.   Seriously thanks for the great info though, might just be between those two cameras now. Got some thinking to do!!  EDIT: After looking at the D7200's performance, it actually out does the D810 (when the latter is in DX mode). It's between the D7200 and the D750 now. Now I have to decide whether to get the D7200 and a Tamron 150-600 or just the D750!!!)"
Nikon,37nvzs,jassack04,2,Fri May 29 17:40:39 2015 UTC,This comment really confused me at first. I thought someone had posted through my account lol
Nikon,37nvzs,lepermessiah222,1 point,Fri May 29 18:11:51 2015 UTC,I was a bit surprised you weren't already considering the D750. It's basically the Nikon 5D Mark III; really well rounded and beloved. (so far)
Nikon,37nvzs,Blrfl,1 point,Fri May 29 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"The connection from the screen to the rest of the body is via the same kind of printed circuit cable used elsewhere in the camera.  Those cables tolerate motion very well.  If you're concerned about it breaking, don't use it and stress-related failure should never be an issue."
Nikon,37nvzs,MagFreakingNeto,1 point,Fri May 29 18:58:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about the tilt screen - it's pretty sturdy and most of the time you don't even notice it has it but if you're shooting video or in liveview you'll really appreciate the ability to flip it out. I haven't heard of anyone actually having a problem with it.   I love the D750. It's my favorite camera to shoot with - the features, ergonomics, image quality and performance are just great. When it came to spend my own money though I went with the D7200 because I just couldn't justify the extra expense vs what you get for it to myself. I know DX is more than good enough for my needs and kids sports is a large part of what I needed a new camera for, otherwise I might have kept shooting my old D40 forever - the extra reach of DX out weighed the extra noise performance and other considerations of FX (which are all negated if you have to crop down your full frame photos to get the same framing as DX) for me. The D7200 is a fantastic camera and I'm very happy with it. The D750 is just about perfect though.   You'll have to weigh your priorities and figure out your own conclusion. It's a tough decision - I went back and forth between a number of different options before finally making up my mind. Either way you'll be able to make great photos."
Nikon,37nvzs,Varjohaltia,1 point,Fri May 29 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys! (/u/Blrfl included)  You all have made this a very hard decision, but one with more focus (two models compared to 5 or so).  It really boils down to DX vs. FX and I think it's time I weigh that out. Then and only then should I make me decision. I will keep my D300s as long as I can, using it as a back up if needed.  The extra reach is really tempting, especially when the Tamron 150-600 ends up becoming a ~225-900mm. That's pretty tempting for wildlife (I live in Northwest Ohio, maybe 10 minutes from Magee Marsh - a birder's wet dream, not to mention the Bald Eagles in my backyard lol).  Seriously /u/r_golan_trevize you've been a huge help."
Nikon,37nvzs,ForeverFun,3,Fri May 29 19:21:25 2015 UTC,Definitely consider the D750. It has excellent 51pt AF. It will rock the socks off of your D300s in low light.
Nikon,37nvzs,jrshaul,-1,Fri May 29 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"Older glass is just not as sharp, thus can't match the resolution of a 36MP sensor. Heck, 24MP might even be overkill with your current glass, but at least it gives you solid room for future upgrades.  You'll feel right at home with the D750. It's pretty much the same AF system, with one extra stop of performance in low light."
Nikon,37nvzs,nygreenguy,3,Fri May 29 02:03:17 2015 UTC,"You're making an awfully big generalization.  There is a bunch of older lenses that keep up just fine, and there are newer ones that aren't anything to write home about."
Nikon,37nvzs,timdesuyo,1 point,Fri May 29 02:52:03 2015 UTC,"I used the 24mm f/2.8D again for a couple of days recently, it just keeps on impressing me despite some Internet people claiming it's soft in the corners. (which is complete BS, or my lens is a special case)  A little noisy for live view focusing so video will definitely require an external mic if you care about the audio. It's actually my first in-camera AF lens and I'm surprised at how fast it focuses on my D750, it's quiet out of live view too."
Nikon,37nvzs,lepermessiah222,1 point,Fri May 29 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"You may also want to try to see whether you can live with the consumer UI of the D610 etc. Losing the ""click to zoom to focus point,"" functionality, dual thumb buttons, the pro dial/button setup for ISO and mode etc. really hurt me when I went from D300 to D600. I still look at the D300's button layout fondly."
Nikon,37nvzs,timdesuyo,1 point,Fri May 29 04:00:54 2015 UTC,"one thing that may or may not be a factor is that the D8xx has a similar button layout to the D300s while the D6xx and D750 do not.   the D700 also has the same ""pro"" layout as the D300s/D8xx."
Nikon,37nvzs,jrshaul,1 point,Fri May 29 13:55:56 2015 UTC,"On the subject of lenses, the old screwdrive Tamron 28-75 2.8 is seriously cheap, and seems to shoot quite well at f/4 and above. From what I can tell, roughly on par with the 35-70 - at half the price."
Nikon,37nvzs,timdesuyo,1 point,Sat May 30 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"I have also thought of upgrading. I had a D70, then a D200, and Ive had my D300 for 2 years. I do like it, but I wonder if upgrading is worth it. It seems like if I increase my skill and get good lenses, I may not even need to upgrade.   I shoot for a lot of things. The main things I like my DSLR for is macro (especially scientific work) and portraits/pics of people. I would like a bump in MP for my macro so I can get more detail.  I have been spoiled in my uncle has given me all of my cameras. He has around 5 or 6 and gives me his old ones. So an upgrade would be a financial shock."
Nikon,37nvzs,jrshaul,-1,Sat Jun 6 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"Work on your glass way before you upgrade your body.  20mm f/2.8, 50mm f/1.4, 85mm f/1.8 105mm f/2.8 micro, 300mm f/4"
Nikon,37nvzs,timdesuyo,5,Fri May 29 01:28:13 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for a body before the glass because my D300s is beginning to struggle at ISO 800 - by struggle I mean I'm getting a lot of hot pixels, something that I'd get only when doing 30+ second exposures or at ISO's above 1600.  Thanks for the recommendations on the glass though, I know glass is the investment and bodies are the things that get cycled through more often - but technical difficulties are making me put the lenses in the back seat."
Nikon,37nvzs,jrshaul,2,Fri May 29 01:55:04 2015 UTC,Yeah there comes a point where a decent body is more sound investment. A dude's gotta be able to shoot at 1600 ISO+ !
Nikon,37nvzs,timdesuyo,1 point,Fri May 29 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"Then go for a D7x00 this time, and grab the FX body after you get the lenses squared."
Nikon,37nvzs,jrshaul,1 point,Fri May 29 02:45:34 2015 UTC,"It's still going to suffer badly, and if all you're really doing is shooting 50mm at f/2.8, the cheapest lens in the lineup works fine..."

Nikon,37eniy,gb0n,5,Thu May 28 12:40:43 2015 UTC,"It might be that using a larger aperture causes the shutter speed to increase which in turn causes the camera to capture light differently depending on the frequency of the light. Do you have mixed lighting, maybe some incandescent and some fluorescent or some other type of lighting?"
Nikon,37eniy,burning1rr,5,Wed May 27 03:52:11 2015 UTC,I agree with this line of thinking.  Can you put your camera into full manual mode at f/1.8 and f/2 and take some pics at several different shutter speeds (even if wrongly exposed) and see if the purple bahavior is evident at all shutter speeds?
Nikon,37eniy,warhorseGR_QC,2,Wed May 27 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"Take a shot in RAW, and load in Aperture, Lightroom, or whatever you use for post-processing. Check the settings, and make sure your color and white balance are neutral. If it's still purple, it's an optics problem. If it's normal, you have a settings problem."
Nikon,37eniy,NVIDIAMAN,2,Wed May 27 05:56:59 2015 UTC,I concur with this seems like the best way to see if it is optics related.

Nikon,37eniy,Sumrandomr,0,Wed May 27 11:01:58 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is the lens you're talking about, or the effect you're getting for that matter, but  'Prone to color fringing and chromatic aberration when wide open at f/1.8' according to: http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/review/nikon-af-s-dx-35mm-f1-8g-lens-review/  Not sure about why you wouldn't see that on both the 3300 and 7100, though...  EDIT: posted this before the samples went up. No longer relevant."
Nikon,37c3rc,Sardonnicus,5,Tue May 26 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"Use a light meter on your subject and see if you're at anything less than the 810's lower limit, which is -2 EV at ISO 100.  The 750 is the current low-light champ at -3 EV."
Nikon,37c3rc,Blrfl,3,Tue May 26 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, so there is a limit.  I am pretty sure I was below -2EV for the shots I was having trouble focusing on."
Nikon,37c3rc,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Tue May 26 16:16:38 2015 UTC,-2EV would be about 1/2 a second at f/2.8 at 6400 ISO if my calculations are correct. (assuming the shot you made was properly exposed and the thing you were focusing on is in the brighter half of the tonal range).
Nikon,37c3rc,sky1193,1 point,Tue May 26 22:12:05 2015 UTC,The 7200 does -3ev as well ;)
Nikon,37c3rc,Blrfl,2,Tue May 26 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Good point.  Been having so much fun with my 750 that I hadn't bothered to look at the 7200's specs.  Probably doesn't do as well noise-wise since the photosites are smaller, but also not a bad deal at about half the price.  If they ever do a DX body with group-area AF and highlight-weighted metering, I'd probably pick one up to get some of the extra ""reach"" back from my longer lenses.  The highlight-weighted metering has completely transformed my shooting."
Nikon,37c3rc,OsamaBeenModdin,1 point,Tue May 26 19:46:41 2015 UTC,"I'm looking to get a D810 to replace my D7000 which has a low limit of -1 EV. I'm already fairly happy with the low-light performance AF of the D7000, it's decent. Will the D810 feel like a fairly big upgrade? I would go for the D750, but I like having the ability to crop images so heavily with the D810 for sports photography."
Nikon,37c3rc,Blrfl,2,Wed May 27 04:59:31 2015 UTC,"If you're okay with what you get out of the 7000, the 810 might be a good choice because its photo sites are about the same size (4.88 µm vs. 4.78 µm on the 7000).  That will give you about the same ability to crop out of the center with marginally better image quality from a lens with the same resolving power.  You'd also be losing the low-pass filter, which will add detail at the expense of moiré patterns in some situations, so that might make it a net positive.  I shoot with available light wherever I can, so I passed on the 810 in favor of the 750, which does better in low-light situations AF-wise (one extra EV at the bottom) and noise-wise (21% larger photo sites at 5.90 µm tend to produce less of it).  My previous body was a 300 (5.49 µm), so I'm in about the same situation as before with cropping.  I also don't want to store the 810's huge files, because most of my shooting doesn't require going that big.  Really, you can't go wrong with either body.  I'm happy with my 750 and what I've seen come out of the 810 is very good.  I expect to have some time with an 810 at a car show in the next few weeks, so we'll see how much I'm drooling for one after that.  :-)"

Nikon,379xiq,abiding_duderino,3,Tue May 26 13:38:37 2015 UTC,"If price is a concern, have you considered the Tamron 24-70 version?"
Nikon,379xiq,Caswe,2,Tue May 26 16:34:40 2015 UTC,This guy knows what's up.  I rock the Tamron and LOVE it.  Also allowed me to put more money into a nice telephoto which is harder to find vs. normal zoom though I would have bought the Tamron anyway because I like it so much.  Had the same model for Canon EOS and it was the first lens I bought when I switched to Nikon.  Image quality and image stabilization are both astoundingly good with the Tamron.  I'm not a brand snob and my primary goal is resolution and sharpness/detail which the Tamron delivers in droves.  My only complaint is that the Tamron 70-200mm 2.8 VC reports the same ID as the 24-70mm so you cannot AF fine tune them independently.
Nikon,379xiq,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Thu May 28 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"I don't have either lens myself, by I have used (borrowed or rented) them, so I have a bit of first-hand knowledge with both.  The 24-70mm is a newer design, but optically, it isn't much better.    With a side by side, you may notice the bokeh or the colour rendering is a bit different, but for sharpness and vignetting, I don't see any differences.  The 28-70mm is built like a tank.  I'm confidant that it could be used to viciously bludgeon someone to death, then be mounted on a camera and work flawlessly for years to come.    The 24-70mm is by no means a flimsy feeling lens, but it doesn't feel quite as solid.  But it is way, way lighter, and after a long day of carrying it around your neck, your back will thank you for going with this one.  If money was no object, or if I travelled a lot with multiple lenses, I'd go for the 24-70 in a second.   But since money is an object, I shoot with a Tokina 28-80mm f/2.8 that I got for $375, and above 5.6, it's every bit as good (and heavy) as the Nikon 28-70.  (but at 2.8 it's smeary as hell...)"
Nikon,379xiq,kyleclements,2,Tue May 26 02:20:04 2015 UTC,"I have an old Sigma. Actually surprisingly not terrible at f/2.8 (I have low standards,) but goddamn if it doesn't vingette."
Nikon,379xiq,jrshaul,1 point,Sat May 30 20:16:34 2015 UTC,"While the 3rd party lens makers are doing wonderful things now, they had a reputation for really sucking as recently as 5 years ago.  But the truth is, all lenses are pretty decent ""in the middle"", it's when lenses are pushed to the extreme that the cheaper lenses show their flaws.  My Tokina 28-80mm 2.8 is just as good as the Nikon 24-70mm 2.8 at 5.6, so long as I don't zoom in past 70mm. But at the extreme wide end, or wide open, it's smeary and soft.  But it's also $375 used.  That's what you pay the big bucks for: quality all the way through a lens's range."
Nikon,379xiq,kyleclements,1 point,Sat May 30 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"I owned the 28-70/2.8 for many years, and have owned and continue to own the 24-70/2.8.  For my purposes, optically they're both excellent. If you need the extra millimeters on the wide end then the 24-70/2.8 is the clear choice.  Also, for what it's worth, I've relegated my 24-70/2.8 to backup status since buying the 24-120/4, which is one of my favorite lenses of all time."
Nikon,379xiq,Moice,1 point,Tue May 26 09:27:51 2015 UTC,"It really depends on you. How you shoot, what your priorities are when you're shooting.   Helping us understand why you want a 28-70/24-70 in the first place would be a good start of understanding your priorities."
Nikon,379xiq,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Tue May 26 11:57:57 2015 UTC,"The 28-70 is an awesome lens but IMHO a thing of the past. Application lens profiles are scarce, 28-70 lenses can be bought used easy enough but its hard to determine how abused they were by the often multiple owners and how close to the inevitable autofocus squeaking and death they are.  The AF-S engine is first gen and just not reliable, from what I have gathered.  Also, if price is a factor, a Tamron 24-70 will outclass this lens any day of the week, especially considering the extra range and awesome VC and great warranty."
Nikon,379xiq,sushimpp,1 point,Wed May 27 11:03:48 2015 UTC,"The Tamron gets a lot sharper - as sharp as anything Nikon makes - at f/4. However, that image stabilization can buy you an extra stop, so you'll have plenty of opportunity to take advantage of it."
Nikon,379xiq,jrshaul,1 point,Sat May 30 20:11:07 2015 UTC,"I have a 28-70..  Recently got it serviced by Nikon. They don't make the parts for them anymore (apart from the stuff like the bayonet mount and rubber grips and whatnot), but they can still clean and calibrate them well. This is something to keep in mind if the AF motor dies. That being said, after calibration I absolutely love it. So amazingly sharp, and super quiet with fast AF, and built like a tank. On a D800 it's a dream, but on my backup D5300, the barrel gets in the way of the AF assist light , making it cover only about half the frame, so that's something to consider if you are putting it on a smaller body."
Nikon,379xiq,AstroChuppa,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:16:53 2015 UTC,"I had a 24-70 for a while, then sold it because I was a hobbyist and it felt like more than I needed. I used inexpensive primes for most of what I shot and I didn't feel like I was missing anything. I started getting the odd job here and there and picked up a 28-70 because I could afford it and it was good enough. I started getting more work, though, so I replaced it with another 24-70 because for some applications it wasn't quite good enough.  The build quality is excellent on both. If anything, the older lens feels a little more solid. Still, the autofocus and optics are just better on the newer lens, and those aren't things I'd give up. I shoot a lot of events, though, and if all I did was studio work I'd likely just use primes. If all I did was travel photography I might use a compact zoom or the 24-120/4. Landscapes? Something wider. Portraits? Again, primes.  Is the 24-70 worth twice as much? That depends entirely on what you need. If you need something in that focal range for studio work where you're always shooting between 5.6 and 11, the 28-70 will be sharp, fast, and easy to work with. You wouldn't notice the difference. If you're shooting weddings where you need to shoot at 2.8 at high ISO, the 24-70 will deliver better and more consistent results."
Nikon,379xiq,betweenheadphones,0,Tue May 26 02:20:03 2015 UTC,"I'm in the Ken Rockwell school of thought here...I have a 50/1.8 (could be 1.4, if you prefer), the 80 - 200 f/2.8 ED, and the 16 - 35 f/4. You miss out on 36 - 49 and 51 - 79 but those really aren't important ranges to me anyway. If you really and truly don't need the longer tele end nor wider than 24, get an 85 and then spend the cash on the astounding 24 f/1.4.   Also consider a used 24 - 85 AF-S f/3.5 - 4.5. Much cheaper than the 2 you're looking at and still a great midrange lens."
Nikon,379xiq,turinturambar81,7,Tue May 26 04:13:52 2015 UTC,"You advice is decent, but be warned, Ken Rockwell is very much not liked by anyone who is serious about photography.  He's the Voldemort of the photography world, and should not be named..."
Nikon,379xiq,kyleclements,2,Tue May 26 05:06:29 2015 UTC,"Well that's too bad. A lot of what he says is in jest and some is wrong, but on points like this (and about ""measurbators"") he is spot on. It is so much better to have a 50 f/1.4 and take a step back, or a 24 f/1.4 and take a step forward, or crop, then to carry a zoom that only goes to f/2.8 or worse because it goes to exactly 37mm. And f/2.8 zooms compared to slower ones (the newer ones anyway, and a few select old ones) are useless because you can crank the ISO with near impunity on a modern DSLR, and if you're worried about the background you should be shooting fixed anyway, which will also look way better at f/2.8 as well.  He's also right about a 28 - 300 replacing everything for most shooters, or that and an f/1.4 of your choice. What you lose in raw potential is gained by the fact that you have to switch lenses less or not at all, and carrying less means you can work longer with less fatigue and/or get to places others can't which means you're getting the shots that others missed."
Nikon,379xiq,turinturambar81,3,Tue May 26 05:21:01 2015 UTC,"People just need to remember that Ken's most important advice is to stop worrying and get out and shoot, and everything after that is just silly wank for the obsessives that pays his bills."

Nikon,379xiq,leeunleashed,6,Tue May 26 08:10:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of his advice is nonsense, or actually sets you down a wrong path, or, more accurately, sets you down his path.  For example, his opinion on Jpeg vs Raw.   He suggests shooting Jpeg only, on the lower resolution settings, at normal, rather than fine quality settings.  This chucks away half the resolution, along with about 2 stops of dynamic range of your camera, and severely limits post production abilities.  If you shoot jpeg, you can be off by half a stop and save the photo, with RAW, you can be off by closer to two stops and still recover it. Also, no, you can't print a 6MP 2X3 feet and have it look good.  at that scale and resolution, not only will pixels be visible, but so will the jpeg jaggies.  And no, the 30-200mm f/ 3.5-5.6 is not an adequate replacement for the standard 2.8 standard and tele zooms.  Maybe if you are only shooting at 6MP you won't see the difference, but when you shoot at 24 (like you should! (unless you have a D4 or D810)) you'll see exactly what the lens is lacking.  Avoiding tripods? no, they are an incredibly valuable tool for obtaining the sharpest detail possible, or getting certain kinds of effects.  His current shift away from Nikon towards Canon is also bizarre.  For example, the D600 vs the 6D.  The D600 bests the 6D in every measurable way, but he still went nuts for the 6D, praising it's inferior image quality and lesser features.    It seems like a move that is motivated purely for ad revenue (canon shooters outnumber nikon shooters by something like 2:1) rather than genuine advice.  His lens reviews are actually really good, but he often relies on single samples that people give him, so some of them are a bit off.    For example his samyang 14mm 2.8 review.  He claims it's terrible.  I have that same lens, and nothing about his review matches my experience with the lens.  Mine is insanely sharp (sharper than any 14-24 I've shot with - which was the king of UWA lenses for a long time).  His general advice to not worry about gear so much and just go out and shoot is very good.  But he doesn't have to throw in a ton of BS along with it.  That's just stuff that serious photographers will have to unlearn later on."
Nikon,379xiq,kyleclements,1 point,Tue May 26 08:47:51 2015 UTC,"The problem people have with Ken Rockwell is twofold. Firstly, they often don't understand that his advice isn't necessarily aimed at you. He's pretty up front about qualifying things and people just gloss right over it, missing whatever points he's trying to make. Secondly, he has a brand of playfulness and sarcasm that not everyone gets. If you look at his D90 review, note the Wi-Fi hoax and all the stuff about cine lenses. I find it hilarious. But not everyone does.   You don't seem to understand his point with RAW vs JPEG. And if I had to guess, you're probably too young to remember the bad old days of film photography where Ken got his start. Back in the day, you fixed color casts with filters. And if you shot slide film, which you did if you cared about color, you had to be spot on with your exposures. With the cost of film and development, you had to make each shot count. As such, you learned to get things right in camera. If you've learned to shoot like that, RAW's ability to set white balance after the fact and fix terribly botched exposures just isn't that compelling. Conversely, modern cameras are rather smart and they get all of this right without any further intervention more often than not. The use-case for RAW is for people who don't shoot in full automatic mode and who sometimes have problems getting things right in camera. Or people who are dealing with high dynamic range and who can't or don't want to use filters to tame the exposure. But for most people (and that's not necessarily you, me, or even most people in this sub... see the first paragraph), Ken is right. RAW isn't worth the file size and complex workflow."
Nikon,379xiq,mrfoof,1 point,Fri May 29 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"And if I had to guess, you're probably too young to remember the bad old days of film photography where Ken got his start   Not true.  It is precisely my experience in the darkroom that lead to this comment of mine:   Also, no, you can't print a 6MP 2X3 feet and have it look good. at that scale and resolution, not only will pixels be visible, but so will the jpeg jaggies.   Darkroom experience hammers in a need for and an appreciation of technical perfection.  Printing 35mm film larger than 8X10 was crazy - the grain became obnoxious!    I was trained that unless grain is the point of the image, you stop enlarging when you start seeing grain, and go to a larger format of film instead.  These days, I can't go into a photo gallery without seeing a photographer with prints blown up so large the individual pixels are visible from 2 feet away.  That would have been unacceptable 20 years ago with film.  For photojournalism or street photography, a little grittiness is great, but for fine art style landscape prints, grain is the last thing you want.  Also, as for film having to be spot on vs. digital giving you a lot of room for error, look at sports photography today, vs. 20 years ago.  The standards have gone way, way up.    take this classic: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C_fEIVwjrew/maxresdefault.jpg  and compare it to this:  http://cdn1-www.ringtv.craveonline.com/assets/uploads/2013/05/file_178887_1_mayweather_vs_guerrero_2_20130505_2058641238.jpg  Yes, the composition and impact of the first image give it an iconic look the second fails to match, but ignore the important elements of photography and just look at the technical aspects.  The grain is distracting in the classic image, especially on the skin tones, where detail matters.  In the modern image, the grain is hardly visible at all in the subject, and only a small amount in the background - where it doesn't matter.  Skin tone - the classic image has skin tones so orange, it looks like it could be a Michael bay movie.  The modern image is dead on.  The classic image has blown out highlights in the shorts and on the reflections, while the background detail is quickly lost into the shadows.  The modern image almost looks like studio lighting.  Skin is perfectly exposed, and the background has far more tonality and detail before receding into black.  Also, the modern image is much sharper.  So while you are absolutely right that compared to film (especially slide film), RAW lets us get away with a lot of stuff we never could in the past, shooting digital has also substantially raised the bar for what an agency is willing to publish."
Nikon,379xiq,kyleclements,3,Fri May 29 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of issues with Ken. I agree with him that I prefer the ultra-wide zoom, 50 prime, and telephoto zoom set up many times. But that is mostly when I'm backpacking or traveling.   If I was shooting a wedding (which I don't do), I'd be crazy to not have a 24-70mm or something in that ball park. Most of the shots are going to be at distances and of framings that fit very well into that range. Yes many people say ""just use a 50 and zoom with your feet"" but that really isn't an option at a wedding. And a 24-70mm zoom can let you get a tight head or torso shot and zoom out to a full length shot and have 2 distinct shots in under a second. Beyond weddings and events there are other types of photographers who need a 24-70mm, but many people would be happy without one.   My issues with Ken center around he tends to write things in a way that makes it hard to distinguish opinion from facts. He has many very valid points, but he also has some points that apply to some and not all and it's hard to distinguish those. Not needing a 24-70 is clearly an opinion that is very much dependent on the type of shooting you do. I would agree that there are a lot of people who spend a lot of money to get a 24-70mm f/2.8 (or 28-70 or something like that) that really don't need it, and the reason they get it is they see a professional using one when shooting a wedding, but just because the professional on the sideline of a professional football game is using a $25,000 800mm lens, doesn't mean I need one. I'd agree that the 24-70 is a bit over-hyped, but there are some shooters where 24-70 fits their needs best.  That said just because I do not need a 24-70, doesn't mean no one needs it. Nikon and Canon make hundreds of different types of lenses for a reason, not because everyone should buy them all, but rather because some people need this and others need that."

Nikon,377tmc,WeirdyCat,2,Tue May 26 21:50:17 2015 UTC,thats a good idea! the replicating a photo to learn thing. Thanks for that!
Nikon,377tmc,hallbuzz,2,Tue May 26 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"Its fun too. You look at a photo and say wow. Now, go make it yourself. Tweak it a bit. Where are the lights coming from? Is it saturated? ALSO. Try to learn your white balance. Not auto or cloudy- but the kelvin scale. Its great use when you want something to look warmer or cooler with more control."
Nikon,377tmc,mrdat,1 point,Tue May 26 22:33:05 2015 UTC,oh i am looking forward to this! thanks again!
Nikon,377tmc,mrdat,6,Tue May 26 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"If that is your first (D)SLR, you need to learn a bit before about some basics about photography, like depth of field, shutter, aperture, ISO, etc. D200 is very capable camera, but it's not point-n-shoot type, you need to know how light works in DSLR, that will give you much more control over photos and possibly great results in time. There is lot's of books and courses, I always liked Thom Hogan books, so you might look into that. Original Nikon manuals are dreadful for most part."
Nikon,377tmc,mrdat,1 point,Mon May 25 16:31:34 2015 UTC,thanks a lot! useful information.
Nikon,377tmc,mrdat,5,Mon May 25 16:55:01 2015 UTC,First thing you have to do is head over to dpreview and start complaining/ speculating about where is the D400.  Next step is to buy Thom Hogan's D200 Guide... http://www.bythom.com/d200guide.htm
Nikon,377tmc,AstroChuppa,2,Mon May 25 20:35:37 2015 UTC,"Haha yes. I am extremely furious. Where is this d400? I want to know, because I have no clue about it what so ever. None, I don't even know why I'm angry.  Thanks for the guide link"
Nikon,377tmc,hallbuzz,3,Mon May 25 21:21:26 2015 UTC,"Study photography and shoot, study photography and shoot.  Great camera, BTW.  I've been shooting one forever and just upgraded to a D750, but I still use my D200.  What kind of lens do you have?"
Nikon,377tmc,AstroChuppa,1 point,Mon May 25 16:39:55 2015 UTC,"I have a kit lense, though I really want a prime 50mm"
Nikon,377tmc,treasurrectionist,4,Mon May 25 16:55:44 2015 UTC,Which kit lens? The 18-70mm was the better lens available. I don't know of any lens that was bundled with the D200 in the same box.
Nikon,377tmc,leeunleashed,2,Mon May 25 17:59:53 2015 UTC,yup 18-70mm
Nikon,377tmc,neuromonkey,1 point,Mon May 25 18:18:46 2015 UTC,That's a good lens.
Nikon,377tmc,timdesuyo,2,Mon May 25 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"its pretty good in general cases, I would just like something with a a larger aperture."
Nikon,377tmc,timdesuyo,2,Mon May 25 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"As awesome as the 18-70mm is, I also wanted a larger aperture zoom lens so I got the Tamron 17-50mm 2.8. I had the first version, nonVC, and heard that that was the better version. Of course if VC/VR is more important than, IIRC, focus speed and sharpness, then go ahead with that one.  Here is someone's pictgure of both."

Nikon,377tmc,mickey72,1 point,Tue May 26 13:43:22 2015 UTC,"VC is Tamron's ""Vibration Compensation""  VR is Nikon's ""Vibration Reduction"".  Pretty much same thing, different names."
Nikon,377tmc,mickey72,1 point,Tue May 26 13:49:08 2015 UTC,Oh cool. I know those would help me a bunch. I am shaky
Nikon,377tmc,mickey72,1 point,Tue May 26 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"The D200 was Semi-Pro has an autofocus screw, and it also meters for old AI Lenses.. Which means you have a HEAP of second hand lenses to choose from. You could get an older 50mm 1.8D for about $90 second hand, which is great and sharp with a wide aperture.  If you don't mind using manual focus (which is good to learn IMO) you can get anything that has AI in the name (not non-AI or Pre-AI) and it will meter and work fine with your Camera."
Nikon,377tmc,d3nzil,2,Thu Jun 11 04:00:18 2015 UTC,"I have about 13 lenses and would take about half of my shots with my 50mm f1.4 D.  The 50mm f1.8 is just as sharp and it is so rare that going wider than 1.8 is actually beneficial.  For under $100 you can have one.  Also, don't underestimate the old manual focus fast prime lenses; they are super sharp, fun to use and way cheaper and more durable than the newer AF versions.  Keep an eye out at garage sales, flee markets and maybe even put a shout out on social media that you are looking for old film era Nikon lenses; someone might just give you one."
Nikon,378eb5,ChefBS,5,Mon May 25 18:44:46 2015 UTC,"Shutter speeds are different, one at 1/250, the other 1/640. Either you have bracketing on, or since you're in spot metering it chose a different part of the scene to meter."
Nikon,378eb5,boilerromeo,2,Mon May 25 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"Actually I looked closer, there was no EV compensation, but you were in aperture priority so it just metered off a different (darker) spot"
Nikon,378eb5,boilerromeo,2,Mon May 25 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"I think its the spot metering or the focus point, maybe the first time you focused on the boys black costume so it compensated for it?  The spot metering can be selected using the dial where it says (AE-L/AF-L) you will see a white dot, a dot with four white corners and a dot like this (●), each had different  ways of exposing  your picture.   The one on the left exposes the scene on the spot of the focus, the middle takes the average  light on the scene and the one on the right exposes for the focus point and a bit more.   To understand it i recommend testing each one in an object in the same settings.   To check if you got bracketed mode on on the front side of the camera there is an fn button click on it and hold then the top lcd should  show 0F which means its off.  Hope that helps!"
Nikon,378eb5,leeunleashed,2,Mon May 25 20:49:28 2015 UTC,"You had metering more set to spot, this means your camera is reading how much light is reflected off a small area in the centre of your image, this would then set the shutter speed accordingly (as F no. Is fixed in aperture priority mode)"
Nikon,378eb5,foxandowl,1 point,Mon May 25 23:18:53 2015 UTC,is the spot it was metering off of the same as the spot it was focusing on?
Nikon,378eb5,r_golan_trevize,3,Mon May 25 20:10:27 2015 UTC,"And, looking more closely at your photos...   If you draw a line through the center of the photo you will notice that in the darker image the center line passes through the bottom of the white circle and in the brighter image the center line is an inch or two below the white circle. So, in the dark image more of the white and green were included in the metering which pushed the exposure down and in the brighter image, there was less of the white and green and more black which pushed the exposure up."
Nikon,378eb5,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Tue May 26 14:33:42 2015 UTC,Not necessarily - spot metering on Nikons is always taken from the center of the image. I believe some Canon can use the selected focus point to meter from.
Nikon,378eb5,boilerromeo,2,Tue May 26 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"I thought spot metering was to a selectable (or focus) spot (around 1.5-2% of the spot selected) to meter the exposure, while center weighted (•) metering used the center 2.5% of the frame weighted for 75% of the exposure."
Nikon,378eb5,r_golan_trevize,2,Tue May 26 15:34:07 2015 UTC,"You're correct, spot metering is tied to the selected AF point (unless auto area AF mode is used or a non-CPU lens is used, in which cases it reverts to the center). It's the center weighted that always uses the center point."
Nikon,378eb5,Aaberg123,1 point,Tue May 26 16:16:25 2015 UTC,Nikon's ability to spot meter from any designated focus point was actually one of the smaller reasons for me to change from Canon. Canon can only do center spot metering (unless I'm completely mistaken).
Nikon,378eb5,postmodest,1 point,Sat May 30 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"Are the images in order? Because I have no idea how the 1/640 one is overexposed. That's a stumper.  (If they're in the wrong order and the 1/250s one is overexposed, then it's a result of spot metering off of the focus point. If you look at it in ViewNX it should have an option to show the focus point... I bet the overexposed one is focused on something darker."

Nikon,378eb5,AtTheLeftThere,1 point,Tue May 26 13:50:43 2015 UTC,"Then I'm stumped. The 1/640 one should be darker, unless someone popped a flash behind you just as your shutter opened."

Honestly for a dust on the sensor picture your's is the least dust I've seen.  You tried ""Clean Image Sensor"" in the tools menu? And you have used the rocket blower with the mirror up? The next step is to buy a wet swab for the sensor, use it carefully and get the dust off."
Nikon,372471,KaJashey,1 point,Sun May 24 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've tried the in-camera cleaning and a rocket blower with the mirror up. It's still under warranty, so I'll probably just send it in if it gets to me too much. I've seen that cleaning it yourself with a wet cleaning kit will void the warranty, so I'll probably hold off on that until the warranty is up.   Thanks for the comment though. I was fairly sure it was dust, and I've gone through all the steps I could to clean it without getting a kit myself or sending it in, but it's nice to have a second set of eyes check it out and confirm it."
Nikon,372471,Sardonnicus,1 point,Sun May 24 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm.... weird.  They look too small and round to be normal dust.  They look more like the oil spots I had on my D600.  But usually, those oil spots should be much darker and more visible at f22.  So at this point it could be either dust or oil spots.  But since they are hardly visible at f22, i'd say leave it.  Do you ever shoot at f22? I bet that you don't.  I also bet you can't even see them at f5.6 or f8.  I'd say if you have the coin to spare buy some swabs, and clean your sensor, or pay to have someone do it.  Or leave it alone until you can see them clearly at f5.6 or f8.  NOTE:  The telltale sign of oil spots are small clear sphere's concentrated in the upper left corner of the image.    Here is a link to an oil image from my old D600"
Nikon,370u9y,plkmnjhb,4,Sat May 23 20:31:10 2015 UTC,"When you say the D7000 is limiting in low light at concerts... is that with a particular lens? If you're frustrated when using the 50 f/1.8 you might need an upgrade in camera. However if you are using the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 or 55-200mm f/4-5.6 and don't feel it's good enough in low light, then you might want to consider upgrading your glass before your camera. If you were to go to from an f/5.6 lens to an f/2.8 lens you should shoot at 2 stops lower ISO, typically FX gives you about 1 to 1.5 stop advantage in terms of noise, the D750 might be a little closer to 2 stops because it's also a bit newer, but it's still not going to be too much better than just getting a wider aperture lens for your D7000. Just playing devils advocate.  The 11-16mm is generally not considered a portrait lens. Unless you either like portraits where the person is small in a large landscape or room (think environmental portrait) or you like very distorted/unconventional portraits, the 11-16mm is too wide for most portraits and will force you to get so close for tighter crops that the perspective will make the nose and chin look huge and distorted. 11-16mm can be good concerts if you're very close to the stage and you want to cover the whole stage or if you want a shot that includes the crowd as well. For senior portraits, the 50mm f/1.8 you have or a 85mm f/1.8 (if you're shooting tighter crops and/or have a little more room to back up with). Another option would be a 70-200mm f/2.8 lens that will give you a reasonably wide aperture and the flexibility of zoom. If you don't have room to back up or you shoot a little wider than a typical head shot, a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens would be good (I've heard good things about Tamron's 24-70 f/2.8 which is quite a bit cheaper than Nikon's version and it has Image Stabilization which the Nikon version doesn't).  If you go full-frame the only lens you have that will work is the 50mm f/1.8 so you'll have to pay for the D750 and any new lenses, otherwise the D750 will go into DX crop mode and you'll be shooting 10MP DX shots and may not be any better off than your D7000.  The D7000 is a pretty solid camera, I'd make sure you're using it to it's full potential before looking at another camera."
Nikon,370u9y,ApatheticAbsurdist,3,Sun May 24 00:29:06 2015 UTC,"I think if you are trying to stick with portrait work-  The 7000 is absolutely fine for that. Coupled with the 50mm and 2 off camera yongnuos and a light box, you can easily do portrait work. There is generally no af speed requirements, and you can keep the ISO pretty low  Concert-  I really think the 750 will shine for you here. The low light af is terrific, a wide fov lens is pretty affordable (17-35) and the high ISO is excellent.   I think if you got the tokina for the 7000, you could get the field of view you want, but the af would still be ""ok"" but you will have noisier shots and fewer keepers.   All the flash accessories would work with both cameras. But for portraits on the 750 I would recommend an 85mm and/or a 70-200 (or even a 70-300 if you keep it stopped down)  As you probable know only the 50mm you have can be used on the 750. As a caveat to that the 35mm may work for you on the 750; with some vignetting; only you can judge if it acceptable for your use."
Nikon,370u9y,Idonutfeeltardy,3,Sat May 23 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"The nikon d750 has amazing dynamic range and is very good for low light work, I had one and recently got a d810 and since then i been missing the low light performance and speed the d750 had plus flipping the screen really helps, I would say go for a graymarket d750, but make sure its a new batch without the flare problem and buy yongnue flashes they are cheap and really reliable. Im not sure about the tokina since i never used it, but that wide an angle isnt really good for portriats unless your going for something different since the people would look deformed."
Nikon,370u9y,leeunleashed,3,Sat May 23 21:25:58 2015 UTC,I'd recommend getting a Sigma 18-35mm f1.8. Great for low light wide shots and 35 @ 1.8 makes nice portraits as well. Sounds like your best upgrade for now IMO.   If you upgrade to full frame you'll be spending ~$2000 on a body alone and then you'll only have the 50mm 1.8g to work with. I mean you could get a 28mm 1.8 to balance it for another ~700 but I'd just go for glass on your D7000
Nikon,370u9y,frankdaazn,2,Mon May 25 08:13:51 2015 UTC,"If you only have $2000 to work with then it's going to be tough to build a useful FX system out of that. The 50/1.8 is the only one that will be really usefull on FX (and it should be really usefull). I can definitely see you having difficulties with the other lenses in bad light - the two zooms are slow lenses (aperture wise) and all three are slow focusing lenses and can be frustrating to use in the dark. Some faster aperture and faster, proper AF-S focusing lenses would help a lot. With a super-wide angle you don't even need to bother with focusing - just set the focus ring to somewhere between 7~10 feet and fire away.   I think some of the claims of how much improvement with FX you'll see over your D7000 are a bit overstated - if you're shooting RAW then a D750 is about a stop and a 1/3 better in noise performance than a D7000 which is about the theoretical difference between DX and FX (the newer DX cameras beat that by a little bit because better sensor tech works its way up from smaller cameras to bigger cameras). The D7000 is still an excellent camera. My D750 is only about 2.5 stops better than my old D40. If you only shoot jpegs you will see more difference but that's due to improvements in Nikon's JPEG rendering engine and not because of underlying improvements in sensor technology.  New lenses and lighting equipment will give you your best bang for your buck I believe."
Nikon,370u9y,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Sun May 24 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"All things being equal, FX will have a just over one stop ISO advantage over DX.  In practice, processing engines and sensors have gotten a lot better.  My D600 has less noise at ISO 1600 than my D70 has at ISO 200.  It has about a 1.5 stop advantage over the D7000, and the D750 is almost a stop better than my D600, so for low light, jumping to full frame, especially the D750, will be a HUGE boost to your shooting abilities.  Saying that, you don't really need FX, considering how DX today is roughly where FX was 3-4 years ago.    If you are already invested in DX glass, ask yourself if you need to be on the cutting edge of low light image quality, or if you can settle for ""good enough""    PS: The Tokina 11-16 2.8 can be used on a full frame when zoomed all the way out to 16mm.  proof: http://kyleclements.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DSC_2113.jpg"

Nikon,371ka1,piorekf,3,Sun May 24 10:59:51 2015 UTC,"It's been asked for a long time. If you're looking for more pro button layout you've got 3.5 choices:   D300s D800E D4s Df (this is a half choice as it's got some oddities in terms of button layout but it's got an AF on button and was designed to keep you out of the menus).   You can basically eliminate the D800e and the DF if the D7200's 6fps was not fast enough for you as the D800e runs at 6fps in (DX crop mode with the battery grip and MB-D12 battery) and the Df runs at 5.5fps. Basically for an upgrade at this point it's D4/D4s or bust. Sadly you're in a niche market. While the D300s was great in it's day, it's more camera than most of the market wants in terms of fps, buffer, and control layout. More and more people are buying cameras who are not professional photographers.  People have been talking about a D400 for half a decade now and I have see no evidence of one coming anytime soon. The focus is more on advanced amateur and the pro market is being relegated to higher end cameras. Canon just put out the 7D Mk II a little while ago, if Nikon sees it selling well, maybe they'll come back.  If the D800e and D4 are out of your range, I'd take a 2nd look at the D7200. See what you can do with custom settings. You can reprogram several buttons, so you may be able to make it a little more useable. It's not going to replace a pro level body, but you can make it adapt more."
Nikon,371ka1,ApatheticAbsurdist,3,Sun May 24 10:28:02 2015 UTC,I want a 24mp 300s!
Nikon,371ka1,piorekf,2,Sun May 24 11:02:11 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for more pro button layout you've got 3.5 choices   What do you mean by that? OK, D300s have AF-ON button which is lacking on D7200, but besides that? D300s have buttons instead of mode dial but D7200 have those exact same shortcuts on the back of camera.  I honestly don't know why people are complaining about this when talking about D7200."
Nikon,371ka1,ApatheticAbsurdist,2,Mon May 25 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"The D7200 is a very capable camera, but some people have issue with the button layout and such. There are some minor differences with the pro bodies that people will pay a lot for.   The ""pro"" bodies have a ring around the AE-L/AF-L button that lets you change to spot metering or evaluative quick an easy. The ""pro"" bodies (excluding the D300s) have the WB, Qual, and ISO buttons placed on top in a layout that is easier to differentiate when pressing them blind (while looking through the viewfinder) The extra AF-On button isn't just an AF-On button, it can be preprogramed to a number of different settings so you can customize the camera for features you prefer (you can customize many of the buttons and I think you can do that on the D7200, but having 1 extra button you can customize is useful). The bracket button works the same (except it's in a different position) but you can do more frames when bracketing (9 shots). I know people who went to a D800 just for this feature alone. (If it's important to you, you'll pay for it). Many of the pro bodies have switch for a black-out eyepiece shutter switch for long exposures. Yes you can cap the D7200's eyepiece but flipping a switch and not worrying if you break or loose the eyepiece cap makes life a little easier. Not buttons but along similar lines, more information in the top LCD. (WB setting, which AF mode, image quality setting, etc.)"
Nikon,371ka1,r_golan_trevize,2,Tue May 26 11:12:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarification.   Yes, on D7200 you can also reprogram most of the buttons that are present on this body. D7200 also allows for up to 9 shots when bracketing."

Yeah I was pretty sure you can customize on the D7200, but the advantage of having an extra customizable button still sticks. I did edit to strike out the Bracketing... I was basing that off of previous models."
Nikon,371ka1,lepermessiah222,1 point,Tue May 26 12:00:32 2015 UTC,"There's hope that a D400 will appear sometime this year for the faithful - the D7200 curiously lacks a few features (91k metering sensor and the group and face priority AF modes that apparently go with it, power aperture in liveview/video mode, not even a modest increase in frame rate) that were taken for granted that some interpret as leaving room for a pro DX body in the lineup.   I'm not really interested in a D400, I just wanted a DX D750 (maybe the d7300 will be that) so I don't have a dog in the fight (unless Nikon is monkeying around with their lineup for arbitrary marketing reasons (which they surely are (grrrrrrr))).   You can wait if you want but if you want the D7200's image quality now then get one now and sell it if/when the mythical D400 finally appears and keep the D300s in the meantime for situations where you need what the pro body offers."

Or you'll just have to do with the slower fps and different button layout of the D7200. It's really not that bad, I have a D750 which is pretty much the same layout and I get by just fine shooting some action. You've got a bit of setting up to do, there's so many customizable buttons on that camera."

Nikon,37046a,quantumlicht,2,Sat May 23 17:34:06 2015 UTC,You might consider installing a focusing screen with a split-image or microprism focusing aid.  (Or both.)
Nikon,37046a,Blrfl,2,Sat May 23 18:03:34 2015 UTC,Is shooting with a speedlight an option for you? The af assist beams in the nikon ones work quite well.
Nikon,37046a,lilium90,2,Sat May 23 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"Single point AF and stick to the center point and turn on the AF assist lamp if necessary (it only works with the center point selected). If you don't want to blast people in the face with the lamp then you need a flash with its own built in IR focus assist lamp (not really infrared but red enough that it isn't that annoying) and the flash would probably help you out in these situations anyway if it's dim enough to be difficult to focus in.   I don't think anyone can see the viewfinder, especially on DX in bad light, well enough to manually focus off that alone and the focus confirmation dot is using the AF sensors so it's going to struggle to show a lock too.  The 35/1.8 is not a really fast focusing lens - a snappier focusing lens will do better in bad light just because it will get to the target focus distance before the camera or subject has moved too much. With slower lenses, by the time they get to where they're going, the focus distance has changed and they just end up constantly hunting trying to catch up. Unfortunately, those lenses tend to be expensive too."
Nikon,37046a,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Sat May 23 19:40:37 2015 UTC,Do you have any advice for a fast-focusing fast lens?
Nikon,37046a,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Mon May 25 02:32:14 2015 UTC,"It's usually the expensive ones! The 24-70/2.8 is shockingly quick to focus, and the 70-200/4 is right behind it. The 17-55/2.8 for DX is probably pretty close to the 24-70.  I'm not sure about in the 35mm range - there's an older 35/2.0 AF-D that is pretty slow and then a full frame 35/1.4 and f/1.8 (not the DX one you have now) that are probably both pretty fast but you'd want to read some reviews and ask around. The f/1.8 may be a bit faster since it's got less glass to throw around - that's the case with the 50mm lenses. The 50/1.8 G is a more affordable lens that is reputed to be a pretty snappy performer, if you don't mind the slightly narrower field of view vs your 35mm."

That way I don't accidentally hit the shutter or change a settings i don't mean to change. The start up time of most DSKRs are measure in milliseconds and at least on my camera the switch is right at the shutter button, so I can flick it on as I'm putting my finger on the shutter, it's not like turning it off or on is that difficult or will cause you to miss a shot. However I can think of a couple things that will ruin a shot by leaving it on:   Shutter button or movie record button or some other button gets accidentally hit and eats up my memory or battery so I cannot take a shot when I need. Accidentally adjust the exposure settings so that the next shot is way brighter or darker than expected (if I see something I want to shoot quick and just assume that the exposure is the same as the previous).   If I'm walking around an area and have the camera around my neck and I'm likely to take a shot in the next couple minutes, yeah I'll leave it on. But if I'm going from point A to B and not as likely to be shooting, it's off."
Nikon,36ysue,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Sat May 23 10:36:53 2015 UTC,I almost never turn mine off. The only time I do is when removing the battery or if I think something might trigger the shutter button accidentally - like when it's in the bag in the trunk with other stuff piled around it (that's never actually happened to me that I can remember though - the only accidental shots I've taken were by my own finger when I tripped the shutter to soon).   The drain on the battery is so infinitesimal while on standby that I don't see the point of turning it off unless it going into storage for a long period of time. That's one of the great things about DSLRs - they're always ready to shoot at a moments notice.

Nikon,36xsph,r_golan_trevize,2,Sat May 23 19:27:53 2015 UTC,Nikon uses the same 24 mp no AA filter sensor across most of the entry level to mid lineup.  Something like a D5300 with >decent glass< is impossibly sharp for a camera at that price point. At base ISO it will literally match or outperform anything  Canon or Nikon offer besides  the 5DS/R and D8xxs. Thats pretty ridiculous. Also takes nice video.
Nikon,36xsph,sushimpp,1 point,Sat May 23 12:41:38 2015 UTC,"D90. Assuming you:  1) have decent lighting  2) have decent glass (it's more about the lenses than the camera you could get by with a cheap 50mm f/1.8 but if it's mostly head shots I'd recommend an 85mm f/1.8).  There are other options like a D3200, D3300, D5200, etc. but they don't work with older ""AF-D"" autofocus lenses, so you'll have to pay for more expensive ""AF-S"" versions or not have manual focus. Also if you focus on manual controls the D90 has a few more buttons and dials that let you change settings more quickly (the other options I listed here will still have manual controls but they are a little slower to change such as having to go through menus, etc.),"
Nikon,36xsph,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Sat May 23 08:42:54 2015 UTC,"Lighting is the most important part of the equation. That can be as simple as a flash on a stand. Get the latest body that fits your budget and a competent lens that suits your style and don't worry too much about it. A pro body offers very little over an entry level body for headshots - nothing's moving, nothing's changing. The one useful feature of a higher body is being able to use the built in flash as a CLS commander but that's still not a deal breaker since you can always use it as an optical trigger.   I took my best headshot with a D40 and a manual everything 80-200/4 AI-S lens. Oh, and two SB-700, one on an umbrella stand. I shoot those with a D750 and 70-200 now and can tell you the lighting is more important than either the camera or lens to making nice quality and repeatable headshots.   Any DSLR since the D40 can make an excellent 8x10 print so really, don't stress too much. You don't even really need exotic lenses either - I like to shoot them at 200mm and even at f/4 the depth of field can be too narrow so I have to stop down to f/5.6  And a little softness is not necessarily a terrible thing - I like the eyes super sharp but no one likes seeing their every dermatological feature up on the screen either.   If $500 is your total budget and you're starting from scratch I'd suggest something like this:   $200 - latest of d40/60/3000-3300 bodies from KEH in bargain condition $140 - nicest lens from KEH in bargain condition (cheap consumer zoom or an old manual focus lens)   (You can move money between the body & lens - like, my 80-200 was only $99 so that'd give you $240 for a body)   $75 - umbrella kit with stand $85 - one of those Yongnou flashes for Nikon   You can make very nice simple headshots with that setup and no one will know you're using bargain basement gear unless you tell them."

The 5300 is nice in that it has a flip out screen, which is nice for video, and built-in GPS if that's your thing. The 7100 gives you more control over your camera and better autofocus, plus a built-in focus motor, so you have more options when you're looking into lenses.   Factory refurbished isn't bad, I've never had any issues personally.   The 18-200 is a nice ""all around"" lens. I can't speak to its quality personally, but I have an 18-140 and I carry it with me whenever I'm just out and about and don't want to lug a bunch around. 50mm is a good length too, especially for what you would probably be taking photos of. Personally I use my 35mm more than my 50mm, but that's just me."
Nikon,36xytl,tehgeekguy,1 point,Sat May 23 03:08:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm thinking about getting the 35 mm also and maybe the 18-140 instead.  What are your thoughts on the d7000?
Nikon,36xytl,postmodest,1 point,Sat May 23 04:34:14 2015 UTC,"If you're coming from a D80, the D7xxx cameras will be more familiar. The D7000 is a significant upgrade, and the D7100 will be shockingly better image quality. (Admittedly, so will the 5300, but its form factor isn't quite the same as the D80)  I'd go with either of two 7x00 series, because the focus motor means more lens choices."

Nikon,36xytl,lilium90,2,Mon May 25 20:14:45 2015 UTC,I would go for the 5300 and drop both lenses for a 16-85VR.   The 18-200 is meh  The nifty fifty on crop equiv of 75 is meh  16-85 will kick in the teeth any of the kits and the range is more useful (16 instead of 18mm).
Nikon,36xytl,Tnlbro1017,1 point,Sat May 23 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"I think given your experience, you would probably want to go for the D7100, the control layout would be closer to your D80. The entry level bodies leave a bit to be desired on that front. The 50mm 1.8g and 35mm 1.8G are both great lenses, can't say I have any experience with the DX zooms though.  You can also go the way I did if you would like to consider FX for better low light performance (among other improvements) and see how much used D700s are in your area."
Nikon,36xytl,Swissfaction,1 point,Sat May 23 05:50:56 2015 UTC,7100 for sure. Better features and a better feel in the hands plus will be similar in layout to your D80. Not to mention the internal focusing motor will be a large advantage.

Nikon,36wqkg,Miguelv93,6,Fri May 22 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you use the lens.  If you are usually shooting moving subjects, then no, it won't do much for you.  But, if you shoot static subjects in low light you'll see real benefit.  I think for optical quality it is pretty much a wash, more dependent on sample variation than lens design."
Nikon,36wqkg,dread_pirate_ryan,4,Fri May 22 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that most recommended shutter speeds are 1/focal length. Lots of reasonable lighting situations are between 1/30-1/100s or so, which would be within the range of your wide to normal lenses. Telephotos want much higher shutter speeds so that's a huge reason for VR on telephotos. It will still help on shorter lenses but it's less of a 'must have'."
Nikon,36wqkg,hedonisticaltruism,3,Fri May 22 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"You're dead-on about it being more important for longer focal lengths, but just to expand on the recommended shutter speeds:  The old rule of thumb (going back to 35mm film days) was 1/focalLength was acceptable if you had a pretty steady hand and braced yourself well when shooting, 1/2xFocalLength was recommended for most applications (1/100s for 50mm). But these rules were based on the field of view of the lens, not really the focal length. That means that on a DX body you'll probably want to go an extra 1.5x so either 1/1.5xFocalLength if you're really bracing or 1/3xFocalLength if you're shooting a little more quickly and not as steady.  VR can give you a few stops slower that you can shoot at but keep in mind if you end up shooting at 1/15th or 1/30th of a second, you might be able to stop the blur from camera shake, but if your subject is moving, they could be blurred. (That can be a desired effect or that can be a problem). If you're shooting still things in low light VR can be very helpful on an 18-55mm. If you're mostly shooting moving subjects, not so much."
Nikon,36wqkg,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Fri May 22 21:24:51 2015 UTC,Great additional exposition.
Nikon,36wqkg,hedonisticaltruism,2,Fri May 22 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"If I was going to spend the money I'd use it on getting a good fast prime like the 35mm or 50mm f/1.8.  It's far more likely that you'll notice the fact that it's a faster lens than that you'll benefit from the VR in a lens with a smaller aperture.  I realize that's not the question you asked, but I just thought I'd throw that out there.  Plus you'd get a different (and very sharp) lens rather than the exact same lens with slightly sharper pictures in low light."
Nikon,36wqkg,ooburai,2,Sat May 23 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"I was actually surprised at how much the VR helped me on the D7000 with the 18-55. In dim light it helps me take handheld shots that otherwise wouldn't have worked due to bumping the ISO too high and getting a ton of motion blur in the frame. If you want to shoot at lower ISO or longer shutter speeds handheld, I think the 18-55 VR is a reasonable upgrade.   There are benefits to getting a faster lens, but the DX system is lacking in fast, cheap, light wide angle lenses."
Nikon,36wqkg,totallyshould,1 point,Sun May 24 04:58:56 2015 UTC,"For most normal things, no, not nearly as much as it does for longer lenses. If you shoot video, yes, it's very useful."

Nikon,36ub2r,mrdat,1 point,Fri May 22 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"50mm on fx would show you the same area as 35mm on dx. A 35mm dx-only lens on a nikon fx body would result in the body automatically cropping down the the same area as you would see on a dx (aps-c) body. A 35mm fx-compatible lens on a fx body would show you the same area as a 24mm or so on a dx body.  The sensor on the fx body is larger, it lets you see more with the same lens so long as the lens is compatible. However, 50mm on either body looks closest to what your eye sees perspective wise, the wider the lens compared to that the wider a person'a face would look. The longer the lens the narrower. Ever notice how cell phone pictures make a person's face look wider or more unnatural?"
Nikon,36qers,csr02,5,Thu May 21 08:16:09 2015 UTC,"Sell the 35mm  The 50/1.8 on FX will take over the role of the 35mm on DX perfectly. You're set there  Swap the 55-300 for a 70-300.  Maybe an 85mm to take the 50mm old place? Or, you could get something like a 24-85 zoom that would cover both your wide angle to moderate telephoto needs and give you a lot of convenience?  On second thought, don't sell the 35mm until you've tried it on the D750 with DX crop turned off. It will almost cover the whole frame (some vignetting and distortion at the edges) but it will give you an idea if 35mm is a focal length on FX that you're interested in. It would be a moderately wide-angle. If it's not wide enough then maybe 28mm or 24mm would be more to your liking."
Nikon,36qers,r_golan_trevize,3,Thu May 21 12:58:16 2015 UTC,"so much of the lens selection depends on what you want to do.  if you're partial to the 35mm on the DX, you're already covered by the 50mm since the angle of view of the 35mm on DX is equivalent 52mm on FX.  since you mentioned wide angle, you should check out the 20mm 1.8, and the 28mm 1.8.

A 35mm DX on and FX body will behave as a 35mm that's harshly vignetted.  If he/she likes the 35mm DX on DX, they need a 35mm FX on FX. If they like a 35mm FX on DX, then they need a 50mm FX on FX.

Nikon,36qers,hedonisticaltruism,2,Thu May 21 16:06:37 2015 UTC,This is incorrect. Whether a lens is marked DX or not has nothing to do with the focal length of the lens. Both the 35/1.8DX and 35/1.8G are multiplied by the 1.5x crop factor and produce the exact same image on a DX body - equivalent to a 52.5mm lens on an FX body.  If OP likes their 35/1.8DX on on the D7000 they'd need to use their 50/1.8D on the D750 to produce the same (almost) field of view.
Nikon,36qers,opticalminefield,1 point,Fri May 22 00:33:23 2015 UTC,I think my decision is to sell the 35mm. Stlll on the fence about the 50mm though. How harsh would the vignette be on my 50mm 1.8D?
Nikon,36qers,hedonisticaltruism,1 point,Thu May 21 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"There shouldn't be any significant vignetting at all on the 50mm if its a 1.8D and not a DX. The 'DX' is specifically for the APSC smaller sensors. Anything not listed as 'DX' was meant for full frame. Once you use the 50mm, you'll notice it's going to be wider since on our older DX camera, it acted as a 75mm.  I wouldn't sell any of your lenses until you test out how you like them on your new camera, unless you need the little extra cash to get the D750. Maybe that 35mm DX will be fine for you? Try it on both DX and FX formats."
Nikon,36qers,hedonisticaltruism,1 point,Thu May 21 18:22:28 2015 UTC,I was planning on buying the d750 first then testing out all my lenses to see how it felt and what the photos would turn out like. This post was just meant for feedback/opinions on what I should do if I ended up wanting completely new lenses. Any recommendations on good wide angle lenses for a full frame?
Nikon,36qers,hedonisticaltruism,1 point,Thu May 21 18:37:13 2015 UTC,"14-24mm f2.8 is regarded as one of the best out there but it's also $2k and doesn't accept regular filters... The 17-35 f2.8 is less lauded but I hear still pretty good, accepts filters but is also $2k...  Maybe just look for a 24 or 35mm prime 1.8. 1.8 seems to be a good sweet spot for low light and the increase in price to 1.4 often leaves you wanting since most lenses loose more sharpness wide open at 1.4, meaning you're almost going to want to use it more at f2.  Note that while I intend to pick up a wide angle lens at some point, I don't do that much wide angle these days and the lowest I have is a 24-70mm. Focusing more on portraiture means my last splurge was a 135mm f2 :P"

Nikon,36qers,Really_Like_Pancakes,1 point,Thu May 21 09:43:45 2015 UTC,"If you want to get great glass for cheap, look to older AIS lenses. They are manual focus, lack the latest anti-reflective coatings, but can still be super sharp and are often built like tanks. I know manual focus on modern viewfinders is tricky but there's a sensor which helps indicate your subject matter is in focus (it's a > O <, where the arrows indicate if you're focal plane is too close or too far from your subject, the O is what your camera would tell your AF system to lock on to). You're limited to your focusing skills a bit but with practice, it's not too hard except for really fast moving objects, and even then, you're relying on your AF motors to match the speed. For example, while you already have a 50, You can get a minty 50mm Nikon E series/Nikkor 'E-series' f1.8 pancake lens for ~$50-100 and its a great, compact option."

Nikon,36ptt8,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Thu May 21 15:59:49 2015 UTC,That's a good point.  It sounds more like a bulb ramp would be needed for that.   You could also change comps throughout the sunset and adjust the exposure each time.  That would look good after you merge all the videos.
Nikon,36ptt8,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Thu May 21 21:46:13 2015 UTC,This requires a technique called bulb ramping and you need to buy specialised kit for it (promote control is one system that can do it).

Nikon,36ptt8,Aaberg123,1 point,Thu May 21 15:58:40 2015 UTC,"Possibly - the sun is right in the middle for a lot of that and with it peeking in and out of the clouds the camera's calculated exposure is probably varying wildly by a good number of stops from frame to frame. Even with exposure smoothing, it may be more than the smoothing algorithms can cope with.  Matrix might work better since it's taking in to consideration the whole frame but your best bet might be to set the exposure in manual with auto-ISO turned off. The problem with a fixed exposure is that it will get darker and darker as the sun gets lower and lower. There may not be one right answer here."

I haven't found any fluorescent bulbs close enough to the green one in the wild to be worth using.   I picked up a couple SJ-4 filter holders for mine for when I want to try and color match something but most of the time I don't bother and just fix it in editing or just ignore it. Looking out my office door I see at least four different color light sources - ugh, what am I supposed to do with that?  Anyway, I love my SB-700s. If you just need something to use off camera, then a 3rd party Nikon CLS compatible flash or one of the older Nikons, like the SB-800 or 600 should fit right in since all you gotta do is turn them on and you can control them from the camera/master. If you want something to use interchangeably then maybe the SB-700 would be worth the extra $$$ since it's closer to the SB-900's UI."

Re: amber, while tungsten is being phased out, many of the replacement LED's are using warmer colour temperatures in their phosphors so that it would still be used. Otherwise, I suppose you could still also use it in areas that still use sodium lamps (orange street lights) but I've never tried how it balances. I assume the green is for older fluorescent with worse colour reproduction (google CRI) so if you travel to '3rd world' countries, you're more likely to need it. It could also be used with older metal-halide types - which are supposed to be white again but tend to have various colour casts including green.  In any case, doing a bit more research, I think I only need the other flashes to function in remote/slave mode so perhaps the SB-800 is still the way to go..."

The bad news is the outer housing is not metal, but I think that was a sacrifice to keep the weight just under 35 lbs. The optics and what they're on are pretty solid though, they're so heavy that it need's it's own battery to run the AF. It also includes a 2x teleconverter that makes it a 400-1000mm f/5.6. Costs $26,000  Sorry I just have a habit of messing with someone who asks for ""the best"" of anything in photography, there is no real ""best"" only best for the job you need to do.  Back to reality, I'd look at the Nikon 70-200mm/80-200mm lenses again. The 80-200mm you had is decent but it's lack of VR and slightly slower AF can be frustrating in some situations (with sports you might not need VR as much, but if you plan on doing some other kinds of work including taking shots of players after the game, VR is useful). The 70-200mm f/2.8 VR is a good option, but you're getting pricy $2,400.  200mm is good for indoor stuff, but if you're mostly outside and need even more reach you might want something closer to 400mm  The Nikon AF-S 80-400mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR is pretty decent and gives you more reach a the sacrifice of of low light performance. It is also pricy at $2,700. Just avoid the older AF-D 80-400mm f/4.5-5.6D ED VR. The ""D"" version is older and it's autofocus is VERY slow compared to the new version. You'll see used ones on eBay at tempting prices, but you'll regret it if you're shooting sports.  If you have a bit more to spend the 200-400mm f/4G ED VR II will give you a little better low light performance (not quite f/2.8 but better than f/5.6) but we're starting to get up there with price coming it at $6,200.  I have not tried them out, but Sigma has come out with some pretty nice, solid lenses as well. the 120-300mm f/2.8, their 70-200mm f/2.8 OS, and the 150-600mm f/5-6.3 ""Sport"" version all look promising for different needs."

Nikon,36modb,timdesuyo,2,Wed May 20 14:44:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say the old 300mm f/4 AF-D would fit the bill for you quite nicely. It's all metal and the price is right. It's not the fastest to focus, but I've made some fantastic sports images with it throughout the years."
Nikon,36modb,veepeedeepee,3,Wed May 20 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"This should be higher, the 300 f/4D is a fantastic lens for the money. You can get them used for around $800 which is pretty amazing considering the reach, image quality and shallow DOF possible. There is also the newer version (300 f/4E PF) with VR and is nearly half the weight and length of the old model. It is also an outstanding tele lens.  Here are a few sample shots I took last week with with the f/4E. Both versions have good AF and are incredibly sharp, but if you don't need the weight savings or VR the old version is less than half the cost if you get it used."
Nikon,36modb,OsamaBeenModdin,1 point,Wed May 20 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"You can also look into the 80-400G but the 2.8 primes are great ( 300, 400, 500 )since you can use teleconverters with them."
Nikon,36modb,iplaywithrocks,1 point,Wed May 20 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"You can get by with 200mm on DX but I've found 200mm kinda short on FX for sports, even just shooting 5&6 year olds on tiny fields."

Nikon,36modb,W00ster,1 point,Wed May 20 15:31:01 2015 UTC,Was this lens delayed? I thought this was supposed to be available months ago.
Nikon,36modb,OsamaBeenModdin,1 point,Wed May 20 23:28:08 2015 UTC,For how heavy it is I'd rather have a 300 2.8 with TCs and the f6.3 is way too dark for sports.  But it is a brilliant wildlife lens with incredible sharpness and image stabilization.  I owned one for about a month and I was very impressed.
Nikon,36modb,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Thu May 21 09:30:03 2015 UTC,Is there a reason you want the sigma over the new tamron?
Nikon,36mlpc,rxpharmd,3,Wed May 20 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"If you want a good price without compromising image quality, then my friend, look no further than the Tamron 70-300 f4-5.6. It's incredibly sharp and has unbelievable image stabilization. The Nikon equivalent pales in comparison in terms of price for quality and it's got about a fraction of a stop of light less at the wide end (f4.5 at 70mm)  It's available here: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/728343-REG/Tamron_AFA005NII700_SP_70_300mm_f_4_5_6_Di.html  And you can watch a thorough review of the much-adored lens here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe1VkIzi6OI"

Nikon,36na9q,vatobob,2,Wed May 20 17:05:43 2015 UTC,"Get the D810 or D750.  Better image quality/resolution than the D4S, same AF, much quieter shutter, lighter, etc.  The D810 can be purchased refurbished from henrys.com for ~$2350 and will have close to 0 shutter count (mine looked brand new) and Nikon Canada refurbs carry full 1 year warranty vs. USA refurbs @90 days (better consumer protection laws up north).  I believe the D750 can be had for ~$1750 refurb but USA only so I'd spend a little extra to get full 1 year warranty.  Lots of people prefer the D810 over D750 for color/image quality (myself included) but some people prefer the D750 for high ISO performance; for what I shoot (high speed wildlife) I didn't see a huge advantage with the D750 and the sharper/higher megapixel D810 won for me especially for detail and ability to crop."
Nikon,36na9q,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Thu May 21 09:13:20 2015 UTC,"Fellow D810 owner here.  It really is an outstanding camera all around.  The sharpness and image quality is fantastic.  But, because it has a high pixel count, it really craves high quality glass.  Lower glass will work fine on it, but it tends to really make you aware that you are using a kit lens on it."
Nikon,36na9q,Sardonnicus,1 point,Thu May 21 14:22:25 2015 UTC,Yep totally agreed there.  Exactly why I went with the Tamron 24-80 2.8 (one of the top 5 sharpest zooms ever tested with the D810) and then the Nikkor 200-400mm f4G VR1.  With the 200-400mm I am able to do 100% crops on a regular basis and the results STILL look better than anything from my old Canon 7D2 or 1D4.  Absolutely astounding!
Nikon,36na9q,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Thu May 21 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I love shooting the D810.  I finally have a camera that feels and performs like a pro-level body.  Well, semi pro.  It's no D4 or D4s."
Nikon,36na9q,Sardonnicus,1 point,Thu May 21 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly I prefer the D810 over the D4 or D4S.  Lighter, quieter, sharper, better sensor, better resolution=better crop flexibility.  If I still shot indoor sports for a living the D4 or D4S would be my first choice but now that I no longer do that, the D810 is my go-to now.  Plus the D810 refurb pricing makes it an incredible value."

Nikon,36na9q,lostat,1 point,Wed May 20 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"Also a D750 owner. There are three points where the 810 has a slight edge:  *Higher megapixel. Only really useful for blowing up images or intense cropping  *1/8000 maximum shutter speed vs 1/4000 on 750  *810 has magnesium alloy body throughout, where 750 is only magnesium on the top and back. Both are weather-sealed though."

Not only does it put pressure unevenly, it will throw off your posture/gait and you'll be suffering all trip once it starts.  I backpacked through Europe using a ~40L backpack + ~5-10L camelback. I wore the camelback in the front, carrying my camera (if not around my neck), a guidebook and daily necessities. Super useful also for water. The 40L was left back at the hostel on walkaround trips but only had clothes and such. I restricted myself to a D40 with 18-200mm superzoom but I think I could've easily fit in another 50mm prime in a pocket somewhere. If you put your camera away and wear it on your back, just get used to tying zippers together or using a quick lock. Oh, I also slept with my camelback right next to me."

Nikon,36ip61,FR1908,2,Tue May 19 17:59:53 2015 UTC,"What sort of body/glass do you have at the moment? I ask because I was in the exact same position a couple of months ago, deciding between the D3 and D3s for sports shooting. I was coming up from a D90 and eventually settled for a D3 because they were much more available where I live. As it was such a hige step up from my previous camera, I don't know that I would have noticed the differences between D3 & D3s all that much. If you are already shooting on a full frame camera or something semi pro like the D300, then the extra quality of the D3s may be worth it.  I also don't really shoot any video at all so the lack of that in the D3 wasn't an issue for me. Either way you'll end up with a great camera. I wish it had a few more megapixels for cropping, but the frame rate and high ISO performance are brilliant for me. As I said, the D3S might be in shorter supply as a lot of pros are still holding on to them,which will further push up their price so it really comes down to what you can afford."
Nikon,36ip61,nunnchucks,2,Tue May 19 18:21:06 2015 UTC,The D3s also has a bigger buffer compared to the D3 (which used to have an optional buffer upgrade).  The higher ISO performance is definitely a plus if you have to shoot when it's darker.
Nikon,36ip61,anomalyconcept,1 point,Tue May 19 19:20:41 2015 UTC,But is it worth the extra 1000 coming from the Nikon D80?
Nikon,36ip61,nunnchucks,2,Tue May 19 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"I am coming from a D80, so pretty much the same step as you made.  The MP count doesn't really concern me as a problem now since it is not a problem at the moment with I am coming from 10 now and it hasn't been a big issue.  The only thing I am concerned about is the buffer size."
Nikon,36ip61,sushimpp,1 point,Tue May 19 20:16:29 2015 UTC,Coming from a D80 you shouldn't have any problems with buffer size. Get as fast/high capacity CF card as you can afford though. Are you mainly shooting RAW or Jpeg?
Nikon,36ip61,Sockratte,1 point,Tue May 19 21:25:30 2015 UTC,Actually the D90 is a nice step-up from the D80 in every way. How are you doing on lenses?
Nikon,36ip61,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Wed May 20 01:08:52 2015 UTC,"I rent the most expensive lenses that I tend to use, like the 400mm 2.8.   Currently I own several, including the Sigma 70-200 (which I will upgrade to the Nikon 70-200) and several primes.  The D90 is not really an option, since I want to shoot sports."
Nikon,36ip61,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Wed May 20 07:11:28 2015 UTC,"I was coming up from the D80 as well and I took the D3s. Though I wish I had waited a couple of months to get a D800e because it would have been much more suitable for the stuff I'm shooting (architecture, interior design and products). Don't get me wrong, I love my D3s because it's an extremely versatile camera and one of the best ever made by nikon imho. But what will you use it for? Do you shoot sports or a lot of natural low light stuff (weddings included)? Or do you want a great all round camera? Then pay the extra 1000$. Is it mostly studio work you do? Save the 1000$ and get an aditonal lens or other gear. In the a body is one of the less important parts of your gear (as long it's decent).  Edit: forgot words"
Nikon,36ip61,RingoC,2,Tue May 19 22:55:02 2015 UTC,I am going to shoot sports almost exclusively so I am kind of focussed on the speed.  Reading all the different reply's I am thinking about the D3. The only big up for the D3s is the expended buffer. But I don't think the occasional motor drive is worth the extra 1000. The max amount of pictures I tend to get in one burst is 5-8 shots. Which is easily in the buffers capabilities.
Nikon,36ip61,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Wed May 20 07:15:49 2015 UTC,"Are there any specs out there for D3 burst rate w/UDMA7 CF cards?  Do you shoot in full RAW or just JPEG?  I am thinking the regular D3 with the fastest CF card may solve your needs and at a 5-8 frame burst I would not consider the D3S at all.  There was a refurb deal here in the USA last week on the D4S, only $2999USD which is INSANE.  We can get them used out of Japan right now for about that thanks to the currency rates at this time but a ""new in box refurb"" w/warranty for under $3k is just crazy."
Nikon,36ip61,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu May 21 09:42:07 2015 UTC,"Ive looked into that. So far I found that Nikon officially states that the D3 supports up to 90mb/s cards. I am not sure if anyone ever tested this with the new UDMA7 cards. Unofficially there is not much to find about it, but I doubt that the internals of the camera can keep up with the 160mb/s transfer rate. The only comment I found is that currently only the D4s can keep up with it. But I am not sure the person who stated that tested it.  Most of the time I am in RAW, whenever I need to get the images done fast its JPEG.  Thats is a sick refurb deal! Unfortunately we do not get these kinds of deals in The Netherlands."
Nikon,36ip61,sushimpp,1 point,Thu May 21 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I haven't been able to find any info that shows anything other than the D4S supporting UDMA7 speeds either...that was one thing I did like about my old Canon 7D2, with a UDMA7 card it could crank out 121 burst at full RAW AND JPEG, insane capability.  But that was probably the only good thing about that camera LOL."
Nikon,36ip61,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Thu May 21 17:24:58 2015 UTC,"I used to shoot indoor sports with the D3. Fantastic camera, great in every way. Seeing what used prices are like, I think of buying one of my own (the one I used was a loaner).   I'm sure the D3s is an amazing camera, but no way is it twice as good. I would get the D3 and put the difference into lenses.   Depending on the sport you're shooting, you might be better off with the added reach of a DX camera, but that's your call."
Nikon,36ip61,sushimpp,1 point,Wed May 20 00:22:03 2015 UTC,"Football, or as it is called in the USA soccer.  I need some focal length (something around 400-500 mm is perfect), but not so much that I want to shoot DX."
Nikon,36ip61,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Wed May 20 07:17:36 2015 UTC,"Could you get a little more specific on exactly what you need in a camera.  The D3 and D3s are very good cameras but like every camera they do have downsides. They both have a very high fps and they are pretty good in low light (but not as good as modern cameras). The biggest downside is for sports it's a 12MP full frame camera. If you're shooting sports, you may need longer lenses to get the same reach. If you're regularly shooting at 200mm on your lens, you're going to need 300mm to get a similar framing. If you're shooting at 300mm now, you're going to need something that goes to around 450mm. If you were going to a camera with larger megapixels you could crop in, but the difference between 10MP and 12MP is nearly negligible, so it's not going to over-come the reduce reach.  Just playing devils advocate. If you're using a 70-200mm lens and never go past 135mm, then you'll be fine.  Back to the question you asked. The D3s was a bit better in low light (particularly if you were shooting JPG), sensor shake that helps reduce the amount of dust that builds up on the sensor (it's not perfect but it does help), has a video recording move (720p), and the biggest difference was the buffer which seems to be the center of your question.  The original, unmodified D3 can shoot at 9fps (full frame, up to 11fps if you're cropping down to 5MP) and it's buffer can do 16 RAW shots that way, that gives you just under 2 seconds of buffer. The D80 shoots 3fps and it's buffer is like 5 or 6 RAW shots, which puts it in the same ball park. If you're fine with how long the D80 can shoot continuously but just wish it would shoot faster so you get more shots between, the D3 would be fine. I never like hold the shutter for more than a full second, so that's fine with me, but this is what you'll need to decide for yourself. It's worth noting that for a while Nikon offered a Buffer upgrade option for the D3 that would expand the Buffer to around 36 shots (giving you about 4 seconds of continuous shooting) so you may luck out.  The D3s I think has a buffer closer to 48 RAW shots, which will give you around 5 seconds to hold the shutter. I personally don't see the need for that, but you might.  Again I'd really consider the focal length issue. It's quite likely you're going to need to crop out a lot of your shots or get longer glass. Another option would be the D300s or the D7200. Either of these will at least double your FPS which is a huge step, the D3's 9fps is not as drastic an improvement from 6fps as 6fps is from 3fps. The D300s is a little faster will give you 7fps (8 if you add the grip and the high end battery), the D7200 will give you extra megapixels (24), better low light performance (at least as good as the D3), and will have a similar buffer (16 shots giving you a touch over 2.5 seconds of continuous shooting.)"

I have the two prime lenses listed here, and love them both, so that's why I'd replace them as good and cheap options, and pick up the zooms for wide and tele, and I don't use flash that often, so the SB-700 is a fine option over the 910.  Likewise, I don't shoot too many sports, so getting a cheaper tele like the 70-300 would suffice for a while.  But having used the D750 quite a bit, I really love that camera, so it's where I would start with that sort of budget.

Nikon,36dl3w,MarcusH26051,3,Tue May 19 13:30:46 2015 UTC,To sum up what's been said... whichever you can afford:   55-200 - cheap and light 55-300 - adds a bit more reach 70-300 VR - cost more and is a lot bigger and heavier but gives you much faster AF performance   Any of those three will get you on your way.  Beyond that you start getting into really expensive specialized lenses where you trade a whole lot of money for bigger aperture and/or more focal length and better sharpness at the long end of the lens.
Nikon,36dl3w,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Tue May 19 14:02:23 2015 UTC,"To echo what /u/piorekf said, you need a telephoto zoom for wildlife shooting.  Since you are on a DX body, the focal range of every lens you equip will be increased by 1.5x.  With that in mind I recommend the 70-300mm lens.  On your D3000 that will have a focus range of 105x450mm.  Another decent lens would be the 28-300mm, but it's a bit more expensive.  You will also want a fast lens.  The 2 lenses I mentioned are not very fast.  If you are really serious about wildlife shots, and have some $$$ you should check out the 70-200mm f/2.8VRII.  Or the Sigma version.  On a DX body it will act like it's a 105x300mm lens.  It's super fast and super sharp."
Nikon,36dl3w,Sardonnicus,1 point,Tue May 19 17:45:08 2015 UTC,I agree with what you wrote but I have a comment to how you phrased it:   the focal range of every lens you equip will be increased   This is not true. What changes is equivalent focal length or rather equivalent field of view. Good articles describing these are here and here.

Nikon,36dl3w,Sardonnicus,1 point,Wed May 20 12:18:40 2015 UTC,I'm a beginner myself so I might be wrong but: I think that this may be very hard as for wildlife you need telezoom lens and those are very pricey. I would suggest that you look at some Sigma or Tamron lenses as those are much cheaper than those produced by Nikon.
Nikon,36bv5w,thepostman333,2,Mon May 18 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, I'm pretty sure that the e-series lenses do not have the ""rabbit ears"" prongs on them by default, but they can be added.

Nikon,36bv5w,salainen_agentti,1 point,Sat May 23 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm using wrong term, but the camera does not know what aperture you have selected on the lens (because of the ""ears"" not turning the aperture linkage and telling the camera the chosen aperture). So it is always measuring the light as you were shooting wide open. You can then calculate the difference in your head or press the depth of field preview while measuring."

Nikon,365wbj,Ezraah,3,Sat May 16 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"You really need 2.8 for night shots, f4 is just not bright enough. Remember for stars that the length of exposure depends on the focal length of the lens. At 12 mm you can expose for about 25 seconds before the stars trail across the photo. A 25 second exposure at f2.8 is about equal to a 40 second exposure at f4 so it's a big difference.   Edit: it's still a great lens, it'll just struggle to get star/milky way stuff. Depending on your camera you can crank the ISO up, but the photos will get noisier the further you push it. I usually shoot at ISO 1600 or 2000 for n ight shots, and take down the noise in Lightroom."

Nikon,365wbj,Ezraah,1 point,Sat May 16 19:55:54 2015 UTC,"If you can, I'd return the 12-24 and get the 11-16 as they are nearly the same price. The 11-20 is the same as the 11-16 just + 4mm,not worth the money."

Nikon,365wbj,dmayan,4,Sun May 17 02:17:16 2015 UTC,Landscapes are typically shot with wide angle lenses to capture more scenery. They have better depth of field at any given aperture. They allow you to capture both foreground and background easily.    The human eye is approximately equivalent to a 50mm. Anything longer than that and you isolate a subject. Anything shorter and you're giving your shot more than what an eye could normally see. It kinda pulls your audience into the shot as it has both what would be normally visible plus additional image from peripheral vision if well composed.
Nikon,365wbj,Tollas,1 point,Sat May 16 16:05:25 2015 UTC,Human eye is 50mm in full frame equivalent? So I need a 35mm on my D7100 to reproduce almost the same as my eyes?
Nikon,365wbj,wookiepornstar,3,Sat May 16 22:40:59 2015 UTC,Yes. It's a great lens as well (35mm f/1.8g). One of the most recommended for dx cameras.
Nikon,365wbj,mrdat,-2,Sat May 16 23:25:55 2015 UTC,I'd say 50mm is too narrow for landscapes. 35mm and wider would be best IMHO.
Nikon,365wbj,wookiepornstar,2,Sat May 16 23:40:58 2015 UTC,Depending on the landscape and how far they'll be.
Nikon,365wbj,Tollas,1 point,Sun May 17 00:15:15 2015 UTC,"True, my mistake! I do a lot of landscape shots and always saw a 50mm as more for portraits and low light work. You could probably use any lens to make a decent landscape depending on how far away you are from it."
Nikon,365wbj,Aaberg123,2,Sun May 17 20:09:10 2015 UTC,Re-read my reply. I was indicating why a wider angle lens (less than 50mm) would be used for landscapes. You want something that would capture more than an average eye could take in from the same vantage point.
Nikon,365wbj,brockopenureyes,1 point,Sun May 17 00:48:32 2015 UTC,Nothing is too narrow or too wide. Some of my favorite landscape shots are done with tele lenses.  https://www.google.dk/search?q=telephoto+lens+landscape&client=ms-android-htc-rev&espv=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sboxchip=Billeder&sa=X&ei=ZbNYVZbZOcTOygPktoCABw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=360&bih=559
Nikon,365wbj,wookiepornstar,2,Sun May 17 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"Shoot in Aperture Priority mode (denoted by the ""A"" on the top dial) and select a smaller aperture (i.e. larger f-stop numbers f/8-f/22). This will ensure you get more of your landscape in focus. You might find that using a tripod or a steady surface may be needed at smaller apertures, because less light is allowed through your camera lens.  Here's an article with landscape photography tips: http://digital-photography-school.com/11-surefire-tips-for-improving-your-landscape-photography/"
Nikon,365wbj,macroblue,1 point,Sat May 16 17:54:32 2015 UTC,"Get a sturdy tripod and a decent 3 way adjustable head. Use mirror lock up and a cable release for super sharp shots. Educate yourself in Hyperfocal distances (where to focus) for maximum sharpness for your chosen lens. Shoot f8 to f16, which will give you the lenses optimum sharpness (check what is the best aperture for what lens you're shooting with). A decent 50mm would be ok for landscapes, but I'd opt for a 28mm, 35mm prime or a wide angle zoom like the Nikkor 18-35mm AF-D. Get a hotshoe level, they're really handy. Maybe some Lee grad filters if you want to get serious about it, they darken the sky and improve the exposure of your foreground and your clouds!   Composition is more important than kit  Good composition is free and makes your photos look more professional. Use the rule of thirds as a good rule of thumb for composition for your horizons and objects of interest. Use leading lines within your shots such as fences, roads, tracks etc. Shoot with a cloudy (but not overcast) sky rather than a cloudless one, It looks better."

D7100 if you want more buttons/dials for a more ""pro"" shooting experience in manual mode. Works with older (D) lenses that use the in-body focus motor. Has 2 memory card slots. Still have some budget left over for lenses/accessories.  D610 if you want the benefits of full frame (1 stop more low-light performance, quite significantly more bokeh for the equivalent framing, more wide-angle lens options).  Also the 50mm will have different a field of view depending on whether you go crop sensor or full frame. It's narrower on a crop body - good for portraits, but most people find it too narrow for everyday use. So if you go crop sensor you might want a wider angle lens to go with the 50mm (could be the kit lens, also plenty of wide angle zooms and wide primes to choose from)."

Alternately, if you shoot at ISO2000 or higher regularly, just get the D610 and don't look back."

The big question comes down to what sort of investment do you want to make as you progress; you can go DX now and maybe save some bucks on the glass (depending on what lenses you want), but if you intend to go FX later you risk winding up with lenses that need to be resold. Conversely, jumping straight to FX now leaves you set in that regard, but limited in shooting options 'til you expand your kit.  Nothing wrong with running around with just a normal lens, of course. I have a dozen or so lenses and still sometimes jump around with my 50. I'm just pointing out that there's pros and cons, and it's a matter of which cons you think you can live with."

Nikon,35xugv,PhilboBaggins11,1 point,Thu May 14 12:39:38 2015 UTC,I bought a little Sony ECM-CS10 clip on mike I intend to use for youtube videos. It's nice and stereo and runs of the mic jack's power.   Life circumstances changed and I haven't gotten to use it much. The cord is not that long. The thing I wanted to use it for was cubing videos that have unique constraints - one person talking and the camera near the person's POV.  If you need two mics for an interview you need some sort of lavalier setup. There is room noise where you least expect it.
Nikon,35xugv,KaJashey,1 point,Thu May 14 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, interesting - good quality recording from it? Would an extension cable for it hinder the quality at all, or would it just be the same, but with a longer cable?  I should have specified, sorry, the kind of video/interview work I do isn't a two person interview. I usually only need the subject's audio, so I wouldn't be mic-ing myself up, as well. Which is another reason I'm leaning more toward a shotgun mic or something like that."
Nikon,35xugv,KaJashey,1 point,Thu May 14 13:10:36 2015 UTC,Very good audio.   I think the cable could be extended but it runs off of slave power from the camera so get too long or too much impedance you might have nothing. You might want a beefy stereo extension cable.  Edit: Make sure the camera is not doing Auto Sensitivity in Movie Settings > Microphone. Auto sensitivity adds gain to silence and makes high levels at the start of words adds bad stuff to everything. Auto sensitivity is not that smart and not needed for most plug in mics. Fine for the built-in mic where it might encounter random sound levels but awful for this. My experience with a D7100 is the onscreen levels when manually adjusting the mic sensitivity are a little high. They will show the sound peaking when it's really not.
Nikon,35xugv,KaJashey,1 point,Thu May 14 13:20:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't understand that. Why would the longer cable impede the audio? Just because it's sapping more of the camera's battery power or some other reason? I'm a total amateur with this stuff!"
Nikon,35xugv,KaJashey,1 point,Thu May 14 14:39:51 2015 UTC,Make sure it's a nice stereo cable. A beefy thicker one with more copper will have less voltage drop per foot. Not audio voodoo just low voltage DC power transmission.
Nikon,35xugv,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Thu May 14 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"I see - another stupid question: if I bought a stereo extension cable, and plugged it into a Rode VideoMic Pro (which, I think, only records in mono) would that have any kind of weird effect or will it all still just record into clean mono, and then I'd have to copy the audio over into the other channel in post?"
Nikon,35xugv,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Thu May 14 15:26:33 2015 UTC,I just tested the Sony thing with a 30-foot stereo extension of not that great quality. Everything was fine.  Stereo to mono usually works fine with 1/8th inch jacks. Every once in a while some connector does not like to make contact but it should be fine to use as you are asking.   The camera records in stereo so with the Rode plugged in you should get two channels with the same audio.
Nikon,35xugv,monkeyassface,1 point,Thu May 14 15:48:16 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, I didn't think the camera would automatically split it for you. Interesting.   I've been watching a lot of videos/reading lots of stuff. It looks like the Rode Video Mic Pro is definitely the answer in regard to quality and cost. I've seen a few people mention that it didn't play well with their specific DSLR, though. So I need to make sure it works well with a D3200 before I part with the cash!"
Nikon,35xugv,new2reddithere,1 point,Thu May 14 15:54:34 2015 UTC,"An inexpensive clip-on lavaliere mic like the one above is the easiest, most affordable, and easiest way to get good audio when you're recording one person speaking on camera. Did I mention easy?  Just make sure to position it where hair and clothing won't rub against it and keep your subject from absentmindedly twiddling with the cord and you should be good. You can run the cord up through clothing to get it out of the shot and out of their grip. Resist the temptation to put it too high up under their chin or way off to one side of a lapel in an effort to get as close to their mouth as possible or the audio level and tone will vary wildly as they move their head around - mid chest is usually good enough.  A decent mic on a stand right in front of them also works but unless they're practiced at speaking into mics and keeping a constant distance and angle from the mic you'll either have the same volume/tone issues or you'll have to move it further back and more background noise will creep in. A clip on mic is still usually easier and is more likely to result in more usable audio.  I haven't had a lot of luck getting good clean audio with a camera mounted mic unless you're only a couple of feet from the subject.  Audio is the hardest part of shooting video. TV shows usually have someone (or several people) holding a mic(s) on a boom pole just off screen right above the talent and movies often rerecord all the dialog in the studio and nothing of what you hear in the movie theater was present when the scenes were shot."

Working distance is the distance from the object to the front end of the lens.  Example. A Nikon 105mm AF-D macro has a minimum focus of 1 foot. The length of the lens and the distance from the lens mount to the sensor are about 6.5 inches. That means the front end of your lens is 5.5 inches from the subject. That's your working distance.

Nikon,35raim,Sardonnicus,2,Wed May 13 07:32:13 2015 UTC,"To get the shortest minimum focus distance you want a shorter focal length. Either a very short lens, under 12mm focal length, or a short macro will allow a very close working distance. (Yes, both terms are correct for what you mean.) Zooms tend to compromise some close focussing length for zoom range.   The 40mm Micro will get down to .163m focus distance at 1:1 reproduction ratio.  One advantage that small sensor point-and-shoots and camera phones have over SLRs is that they can have very small, very short focal length lenses. They can be in the sub 5mm range where focussing on the lens surface is possible. Getting that ability in a lens large enough to cover a DSLR sensor gets pricey."

Nikon,35raim,timdesuyo,1 point,Wed May 13 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"If you are shooting on a DX body or even a FX body a 60mm macro will not get that shot.  You need an ultra wide angle lens like a 14-24mm f/2.8.  The depth of field is so shallow on that example image there was no way it was shot with a f/2.8 lens.  Notice how the eyes are in focus but the nose is not.  I think that image was taken with an ultra wide.  No way that entire cats face could fit if it was taken with a 60mm lens marco or otherwise.  Ultra wides have a very close focusing distance.  This is why you always see people shoving them in the faces of football players after the game.  Because you can literally shove them right up in someones face and at 14mm wide you don't even need to compose the image because when you are that close and that wide, the face of the player will be in the image and you can compose and straighten it later in post.  It's the old ""Ultrawide shove blaze edit"" technique used by paparazzi's and sports shooters."

Nikon,35qyll,AexSBI,2,Tue May 12 19:58:23 2015 UTC,It's regular old run of the mill dust. Learn how to clean your own sensors. Buy a Rocket blower and a Visible Dust wet swab Kit. The best course of action is always in camera cleaning > rocket blower > wet swab. 90% of te time the blower will do the trick.  I clean my sensors once a month with swabs. Its easy. Dont be scared... you are actually cleaning the protective glass shield... not the actual sensor which is protected.
Nikon,35qyll,evanrphoto,2,Tue May 12 23:01:15 2015 UTC,"Funny, how I mentioned this in thread last week and got downvoted and called out for suggesting that people learn to clean their sensors on their own."

Nikon,35qyll,electromage,2,Wed May 13 16:45:27 2015 UTC,"The D610 quickly replaced the D600 mostly because of the oil issues the D600 has. They are very rare in your model. These are certainly just regular dust.  The auto-clean function on cameras is fairly worthless. You should have a rocket blaster and use it (in mirror-up lock) before every shoot. We call this a ""dry clean."" You should do a physical ""wet clean"" with Sensor Swabs or a Sensor Gel Stick every 1-2 months. It's no big deal, and nothing to freak out about like most people do."

Nikon,35qyll,Blrfl,1 point,Wed May 13 09:33:35 2015 UTC,Looks like something on the sensor.  Shoot the sky at f/22 and focused at infinity and anything should show through very clearly.  Is the body set to clean the sensor at power-up?  Have you done a cleaning cycle lately?
Nikon,35qyll,Blrfl,1 point,Tue May 12 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, auto cleaning is on. Some manual cleaning wasn't done earlier, because my camera is new, only ~800 shots were done. I will shoot the sky with f/22 tomorrow (now it's night) and send updated images..."

Nikon,35qlha,tulesto,6,Tue May 12 18:23:50 2015 UTC,"If you can squeeze the budget,  I'd look at a used 7100. You'll get way more functionality. I think the lower models can't use older AF lenses while the 7100 can, which will increase your ability to get older gems. I had a D40 for a while and upgraded to a D610 but were I to be more frugal, I would've gone with the 7100. I decided to upgrade to FX."

Don't be afraid of getting a refurbished product, I've only bought refurbished bodies and never had an issue.   The other thing, is that if you've been shooting for 8 years with a D40 and have 5 lenses, you know how to shoot. The D3XXX/5XXX will be way better optically than your D40 and have a few additional features, but the D7100 is beyond both with features that while not always necessary, can help elevate your photography and creativity."
Nikon,35qlha,hedonisticaltruism,1 point,Wed May 13 17:22:41 2015 UTC,Don't be afraid of getting a refurbished product Or used. Consider that bodies depreciate quickly so you might as well take what you save getting a used/refurbished one and apply it to your next body.   Looks like D3300 is about $300-400 new; D5300 is about $600-700 new. Grey market or used D7100s on ebay are $600-700.  One last alternative is you could get a used D700 for ~$1k.

No GPS capability on the 3300  Those are the differences I remember off the top of my head"

Nikon,35qlha,rubberduck05,3,Tue May 12 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"Curious why the 3300 over the 5300. I'm looking at a 5300, I like the wi-fi capability because I can control the camera from my phone. The 5300 appears (from reviews) to perform better in low light situations as well."
Nikon,35qlha,Elderain,2,Wed May 13 14:08:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like the 5xxx series is gimmicky. if you want wifi, and you need a screen that tilts, go for it, otherwise, at least personally, it was a huge waste. the 3xxx gets you entry level price, but pretty good performance for the $, the 71xx/2xx gets you great low light, huge AF system upgrade, motor in body for using some older lenses."
Nikon,35qlha,rubberduck05,1 point,Wed May 13 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"I've got the D3000 now and I feel like I've reached the boundaries of its capabilities, which is why I'm trying to get away from the 3xxx line. So you have the 5300? You don't use the tilt screen? I feel like that would be a huge help, but I'm very short and frequently shoot holding the camera over my head."
Nikon,35qlha,Elderain,2,Wed May 13 14:31:09 2015 UTC,"Going from a D3000 to a D3300, I don't think would be worth it. I had a D3300 and I swapped to a D7100. I previously ran a D200 before that. I personally have no use for the tilt screen - maybe it's just the type of shooting that I do. The AF system on the D7100 is god damned amazing compared to the D3300. The low light pictures have much less noise also, and I feel like it focuses better in low light also which would make sense. I personally missed all the control dials and things I had on the D200, when I got my D3300 so the D7100 felt perfect in my hands again, everything I need is at my fingertips, and I can use a slew of older lenses again that required a motor in body."

Nikon,35q29r,sunwayman,2,Tue May 12 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"I have a related mystery.  Background: I am a glasses wearer but I have a ~weak~ prescription.  I don't really need my glasses for day-to-day stuff.  I am nearsighted.  I can safely drive without my glasses, and I don't use them when I take pictures.  One of my cameras is an F3HP, an SLR that has no diopter adjustment control (no biggie since, as I already mentioned, I don't need glasses to see clearly enough).  With the stock eyepiece that camera came with, I can manually focus and see the subject clearly enough.  When I screw in the DK-17M, the image is still noticeably blurry when I have focused to the best of my ability.  Now when I put my glasses on, the viewfinder image is clear enough with the DK-17M.  How bizarre!  I.e., the DK-17M only works for me when I wear my weak prescription glasses.  Glasses that I don't need at all when not using the DK-17M.  I got so frustrated by this anomaly that I returned my DK-17M to the store I bought it from."
Nikon,35q29r,gb0n,2,Wed May 13 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"The DK17m widens the diopter adjustment range of whatever prism it's attached to (so on a D810, the +2/-2 range becomes +4/-4, not sure if the actual numbers are accurate though). Now here's the weird thing with Nikon viewfinders - the bare viewfinder is actually -1 (and a '0' eyepiece would be +1, which cancels out the -1 of the prism), so when you put that DK17m on it'll multiply that -1 to a point where your eyes can't see through it correctly without glasses."
Nikon,35q29r,BrunoMarx,1 point,Thu May 14 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind that the fuzziness you see at the bottom could simply be the eyepiece itself blurring the image a bit as you're looking through the extreme edges of glass. The viewfinder itself is sharp because you're looking straight through the middle of the eyepiece, where there'll be less distortion."
Nikon,35oq4f,80sheets,11,Tue May 12 07:15:39 2015 UTC,D7100 is the best value here. Regarding the stuff that really matters:  What you gain over the D7000:    Better Megapixels (24 vs 16) Better processor for faster performance Better autofocus (51 pt vs 39 pt)   What the D7200 gives you over the D7100:   Slightly better battery life (1110 shots over 950 shots) Wi-Fi Connectivity   You can pick up a D7100 on ebay for about $300 less than a D7200 and you're basically buying the same camera.
Nikon,35oq4f,decorama,2,Tue May 12 12:22:36 2015 UTC,"I would also suggest D7100 but:  D7200 gives much more. It fixes vignetting problems that are clearly seen in this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erCZ5SRXwKI  It also uses faster processor and auto-focus chip, and adds larger buffer but this last thing is not a factor here."

The same camera? Come on, there are a lot more important features. I'll add:   Better low light autofocus Expeed 4 processor giving snappier performance 3x larger buffer (18 shot burst compared to 6 on the D7100) 1 stop higher dynamic range (almost as high as the D810!) No banding, or at least drastically reduced 1080p 60fps video   Not saying the D7100 isn't still a great buy, but the improvements in the D7200 shouldn't be ignored."

How this guy put wifi connectivity and battery life as the only upgrades is an ignorant joke.  thumbbing you up for that clarification. I have a d90 and I hit the buffer on it all the time at baseball games. 11 shots versus 6, and the impact of a faster memory card being writable is a huge deal. It's not gonna give you necessarily more FPS, but it'll give you more FP/m e.g you can take 35 versus 17  that's kind of a big deal depending on what you're shooting IMO.

Nikon,35oq4f,mrhaftbar,2,Tue May 12 08:14:42 2015 UTC,Yup.  My first d7000 focusing was spot on.  I took it for granted.  I didnt realize it until i sold it and bought a second d7000 later on.  This second's af is just so badly tuned.  I have af tune set to -6 for all lens.

Nikon,35nsak,doesnotlikecricket,2,Tue May 12 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"In the example you showed it's chosen an aperture of 5.6 for whatever reason, which isn't ideal for indoors.  Also, the shutter speed is higher than necessary (1/100th, when 1/60th is more typical, depending on lens).    Try Aperture priority and change this to allow more light through the lens.  Additionally, check the settings of your auto ISO.  Put a limit on how high it will go so that you are happy, and also change the minimum shutter speed.  I have my minimum shutter speed at 1/60th, but if you have a very steady hand, you could manage 1/30 for many shots (again dependent on lens)."
Nikon,35nsak,doesnotlikecricket,1 point,Tue May 12 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"its a zoom lens, so that's it's min at the zoom focal length."
Nikon,35nsak,totallyshould,1 point,Tue May 12 01:10:43 2015 UTC,"Ah fair enough, that makes sense.  Perhaps in that situation, it just wasn't as bright as it seemed to you?  If you took a photo at 1/100 5.6 and ISO 6400, and it wasn't overexposed, then there is no issue there other than lack of light.  I thought you were saying your camera was choosing strange settings that were needlessly causing high ISO, which isn't the case if you couldn't have opened the aperture further than 5.6.  Although, 1/100 is perhaps a little fast depending on your focal length."
Nikon,35nsak,MagFreakingNeto,0,Tue May 12 01:22:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah but 800-1000 ISO was just as good, if not better. But this happens all the time—I really do think it's choosing a needlessly high ISO. I've set max ISO to 3200, and it hits that quite a bit."
Nikon,35nsak,MagFreakingNeto,1 point,Tue May 12 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"3200 is really not that high at all for indoors with a zoom lens that's limited to f/5.6. I'm pretty happy with my D750 all the way up to 12,800 if the situation calls for it, and won't hesitate about 6400 unless I am going for a really high quality edit. Normally I care more about getting it in focus and not full of motion blur, and the sensor in this camera is a champ.   One of the sweet things about the auto-ISO is that you can set it so that the ISO respects a minimum shutter speed. You can set that shutter speed, or leave it in ""auto"", so as you zoom your lens to a longer focal length it uses a faster shutter speed, and bumps up the ISO to allow that to happen. This is a great piece of automation, and you can tweak it so that the desired shutter speed is more or less than the inverse of the focal length. I keep it at the ""slower"" end if I have a VR lens and want to keep ISO down, and I keep it at the ""faster"" end if I care more about stopping motion indoors."
Nikon,35nsak,MagFreakingNeto,2,Tue May 12 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"6400 ISO is no issue at all on a Nikon (Sony) FF sensor.  I find Nikon tries to make images too bright in a lot of indoor situations (I think it's to preserve extra shadow detail), change to -0.3 or -0.7 exposure comp and your ISO should improve quite a lot. If I take a photo in my room at 0.0 exposure comp it makes the photo much brighter than it is IRL."
Nikon,35nsak,Aaberg123,1 point,Tue May 12 01:53:49 2015 UTC,thanks! Do you have a maximum ISO set?
Nikon,35nsak,MagFreakingNeto,2,Tue May 12 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"I have mine set to 12800, it's never a problem unless I'm in a dark room, then I have to add - exposure comp or it tries to make the image too bright for my tastes and shoots straight to 12800 ISO, even with a f/1.4 lens.  If you set it higher than 12800, the buffer size gets reduced for some reason.   Quite often I roll with -0.3 or -0.7 in general as my fixed exposure comp as I do find the D750 creates an image that is a little too bright, sometimes it's fine but I prefer to risk being underexposed than blow out highlights.  Most important thing to remember about the camera is that it doesn't try to capture what your eyes sees, it's running an algorithm to determine the ""correct"" image but that is often different to what we really see. You will definitely wanna get used to using negative exposure comp, if you set the ""easy exposure comp"" in the settings you can use one of the dials to add exposure compensation that resets to 0 after you turn the camera off. (if you use the dedicated button, that will stay until you change it back)  Alternatively you can just fix it with RAW files but if you blow out highlights it can sometimes ruin a photo. (usually salvageable unless extremely blown out)"
Nikon,35nsak,Aaberg123,1 point,Tue May 12 02:07:15 2015 UTC,thanks! This was super helpful!
Nikon,35nsak,piorekf,2,Tue May 12 02:11:21 2015 UTC,"no problem, just get used to using exposure comp because in low light it's a really useful way to stop your camera jumping the ISO up when it doesn't have to (without fiddling with manual ISO), in good lighting conditions the camera's vision lines up better with ours, though if shooting into the sky/horizon you may wanna change exposure comp around a bit as you would in low light.  my a6000 had the exact same behaviour as my D750 when it came to low light, always jumping the ISO up and making the image too bright, it's kinda annoying but it's super easy to fix"
Nikon,35nsak,Matterchief,1 point,Tue May 12 02:15:54 2015 UTC,You can fine tune the metering in the settings menu. It can move on 1/6ev increments. Thus you can make your -1/3 your new zero.
Nikon,35nsak,Matterchief,2,Tue May 12 12:19:21 2015 UTC,I think that is meant to mess up the exposure comp icon (there is a warning if you change the metering) so it's more convenient to just leave it at -0.3 or so
Nikon,35nsak,sayerry,1 point,Tue May 12 15:57:53 2015 UTC,Whatever works for you. :-)
Nikon,35nsak,hedonisticaltruism,2,Tue May 12 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"What are your settings in ISO menu? Do you have minimum ISO set to 100?  I had the same problem at first with my D7200 because I had minimum ISO set to 800 as I thought that this is just a setting for when I turn auto ISO off and that it doesn't matter in auto mode. After setting ISO to 100, max auto ISO to 3200 (DX sensor)  and turning auto on, everything is great."
Nikon,35nsak,Sardonnicus,6,Wed May 13 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"What's going on is that you bought a camera that you weren't ready for.  Read the manual on the auto ISO function.  You have obviously told the camera to go for high shutter speeds which also means higher ISO.   Also, I get mean when im drunk. sorry."
Nikon,35nsak,TheFreneticist,3,Tue May 12 01:32:21 2015 UTC,"No worries, I am happy to learn however I can. :) My problem is that manually setting a lower ISO with those same settings gives me  a better exposure."
Nikon,35naum,SausageLegs,3,Mon May 11 22:20:23 2015 UTC,"A used 18-200mm DX VR is a workhorse. You can shoot almost anything. You loose out on a bit of sharpness, bigger glass and some more distortion but it's a great 'swiss army knife'. Combined with current fast glass, you'll only really be held back by indoor sports photography and perhaps some specific macro work or effects or whatever.  If you don't have anything specific, I'd get a 18-200mm."
Nikon,35naum,hedonisticaltruism,2,Mon May 11 22:57:30 2015 UTC,What do you think of the 80-200mm f/2.8? I can get it for $250-275 off a friend.
Nikon,35naum,turinturambar81,1 point,Mon May 11 23:07:36 2015 UTC,The AF-D? That's a steal for that lens if it's in good shape. Both in cost and because it's a great lens!  Edit: I meant the ED version.
Nikon,35naum,hedonisticaltruism,1 point,Tue May 12 00:34:03 2015 UTC,What's the version? I see later in this thread there's a lot of speculation on it.
Nikon,35naum,hedonisticaltruism,1 point,Tue May 12 00:34:37 2015 UTC,ED
Nikon,35naum,McRioT,1 point,Tue May 12 01:28:54 2015 UTC,"If it's this: http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/1986/AF-Zoom-Nikkor-80-200mm-f%252F2.8D-ED.html  Then that's a fantastic deal. Again, your new lens should fit what you want to shoot but from what I hear, it's a fantastic telephoto lens. Very sharp, very colour accurate, etc. Only downside is the autofocus is a little slow, so not great for tracking fast movement (sports, some wildlife?). Decent portrait and wedding lens. 9 aperture blades will give you decent bokeh (blur) but not as nice as the best portrait lenses.  Some will say lack of VR hurts this lens but VR isn't super critical, especially since this is pretty big glass. Don't be afraid to shoot at higher ISO's. Better to be sharp with noise than blurry without. It's going to be heavy so be aware of that. Also, note the crop factor of the DX format will make this ~120-300mm."
Nikon,35naum,totallyshould,1 point,Tue May 12 05:28:01 2015 UTC,"That's a really good deal. If you can live without VR and the weight, then go for it. That thing is heavy and built like a tank. If you plan on doing sports, weddings or animals, it would work great."
Nikon,35naum,Sumrandomr,3,Tue May 12 00:36:00 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you could use some telephoto!  The 85mm is a fantastic lens that fits in your budget, but it's too close to the 50mm to be worth it, IMO  The 105mm micro is a bit beyond your budget, but could be a lot of fun. Macro is good, but that lens is a fine focal length for head shots and it's super sharp.  If you want to go WiiiiiiiDe, the sigma 8-16mm is a ton of fun. I have that one, and I am really impressed with the image quality. I have a heck of a time making it show any kind of flare or ghost, and it's surprisingly sharp too. The distortion seems OK, and compared to the truly massive amounts of perspective distortion inherent at 8mm, I don't think you will notice the other distortion too much, and it can be corrected if you are doing architecture.  The 70-300 seems a bit boring to me, but the utility of 300mm on a crop body has its place."
Nikon,35naum,SoverIBasen,2,Mon May 11 22:57:41 2015 UTC,Upvote for the Sigma 8-16 - love that lens!
Nikon,35naum,lilium90,1 point,Fri May 15 08:29:29 2015 UTC,Id go for a 70-200 2.8. You can find them quite cheap used. If you like primes as i do a 85 1.8 D or G are really cheap used and not too much new. Either should be fantastic sharp lenses that should fit you grate for portraits and street. However the 70-200 somewhat better for sports but also comes at a higher pricepoint

Nikon,35naum,SoverIBasen,1 point,Mon May 11 23:15:58 2015 UTC,"The 80-200 is still a VERY competent lens and a steal at that price, given that the one you're getting is in good condition"

The 80-200 laks VR and and slow Autofocus compared with newer lenses but for example: shooting sports, you still need a high shutter speed so no Vr shouldn't be a problem. If it is your friend selling it ask to take it out for a test run"
Nikon,35naum,totallyshould,1 point,Mon May 11 23:31:47 2015 UTC,"It's the push pull version, does that make any difference in your opinion?"
Nikon,35naum,SoverIBasen,1 point,Mon May 11 23:42:34 2015 UTC,oh so the Af-D lens? I have an old Nikon 70-210 with pull too zoom and I quite like that besides the fact that that lens is soft and crap :D. Some modern canon lenses still uses that instead of ring zoom. Might not suffer as bad as the 70-200 from focus breathing but lak sharpness. Test it out and if u like the results buy it. ur not gna find a 70-200 2.8 for that bargain of a price
Nikon,35naum,partickle,1 point,Mon May 11 23:56:29 2015 UTC,"The lens says ED on it, but he says its the push pull version"

Af-D stands for a type of autofocus for Nikon compared with Af-G lenses Af-D lenses still has an aperture ring whilst Gs does not like the 50mm 1.8G.  ED stands for a type of glas used within the lens itself ""ED-glas""   Still say you should ask to try it out and if u like it go for it :)"

Nikon,35mfti,InfernoTurnip,5,Mon May 11 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"Only you can decide if you made a mistake.   In the same sense that there is a percentage of photographers out there who think a fast 35mm lens is some kind of magic bullet, there is an equal sized group who think the same of a 50.  I've made 100& of my living in this business for almost 40 years, and for a guy who owns and has owned a load of both 35 and 50mm lenses, I hardly ever use or have used either of those focal length prime lenses, whether back when I was shooting DX format or Fx format.  The best, most expensive, fast 35 or 50mm prime lens in the world is pretty useless to the photographer who tends to ""see"" in wider or longer focal lengths.  Personally, I'll take an 85 and/or 24 over either, but that's just the way I tend to ""see."""
Nikon,35mfti,Moice,1 point,Mon May 11 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"Great points, I agree with everything here, although my living has been made for only the last 10. ;-)"
Nikon,35mfti,Thanassi44,1 point,Mon May 11 21:11:39 2015 UTC,But the 50mm is really 75mm due to the crop factor. So wouldn't that be the one you would recommend? Or is it more about what the lens does to the image?
Nikon,35mfti,Ezraah,1 point,Tue May 12 09:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not making a recommendation one way or the other.  I'm just saying that when I buy (or have bought) any lens, the decision is nearly always based on focal length range I need above all else.  For a (possibly extreme) example, if I were going to shoot motorsports, I'd obviously want a long telephoto. If I were going to shoot architecture, I'd want a wide angle. Once that primary qualification is met, then I'd examine the options and consider maximum aperture, optical quality, size and weight, cost, etc."
Nikon,35mfti,Moice,1 point,Tue May 12 13:08:26 2015 UTC,The 50mm is an ideal portrait lens. lower f-stops Will get you that nice shallow depth of field.  I know very little about automotive photography. What would the 35mm f1.8 be able to do for your automotive photography that your kit lens can't do?
Nikon,35mfti,Meekois,1 point,Mon May 11 18:52:02 2015 UTC,Most of my best automotive images were shot with my 50mm 1.8 or my 55-200. Honestly.. The 55-200 is better if doing a solo shoot. The 50mm does give you an amazing DOF but if you are at a meet or show it might be a little tight on the framing... But that just forces you to get creative!
Nikon,35mfti,Tnlbro1017,0,Wed May 13 04:08:04 2015 UTC,Yeah man. I have my 18-140mm as well obviously so I have plenty of versatility!
Nikon,35mfti,Tnlbro1017,1 point,Wed May 13 10:58:33 2015 UTC,Just enjoy what you have. I use my 18-105 at times for automotive but it is not as sharp at the 50mm.  55-200 https://flic.kr/p/9fx49H https://flic.kr/p/aWSCmR https://flic.kr/p/8VzgfC  It is a shame I haven't shot cars after becoming a better photographer but you get the idea. I love the compression of a telephoto
Nikon,35mfti,fucking_chocolate,-4,Sat May 16 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Yes, you made a mistake. But don't worry, I made the exact same mistake. I then bought a 35mm (since it's quite a cheap lens), but kept the 50mm. I later sold my DX-camera and bought a used D610. So, keep the 50mm if you ever want to go full frame!"
Nikon,35mfti,juliancolton,3,Mon May 11 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"Why would it be a mistake? Especially for portraits, the added focal length will help to compress features and reduce the minimum DOF... though that would also apply to car photography."
Nikon,35mfti,juliancolton,1 point,Mon May 11 19:16:17 2015 UTC,The majority of fellow automotive photographers use the 50mm although admittedly some of them use Canons. I've heard that the 35mm gives a lot more distortion than the 50mm?
Nikon,35i22f,fetanugs,13,Sun May 10 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"How are you going to get more reach by shooting a D610 in DX mode? The D7000 sensor has a higher pixel density equivalent to 36MP full frame and due to the ""cropped"" field of view of APS-C you get more ""reach"". By shooting the D610 in DX mode, you're just cropping the final image no different than what you'd do in lightroom."
Nikon,35i22f,sunwayman,1 point,Sun May 10 22:52:34 2015 UTC,Interesting.
Nikon,35i22f,Sardonnicus,1 point,Mon May 11 01:56:04 2015 UTC,Why is this not the top comment?
Nikon,35i22f,totallyshould,3,Mon May 11 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I think it's a tossup between the two. The FF has a distinct low-light advantage, but you mostly lose it by cropping to DX. You might get better color and dynamic range with the D610 even if noise is the same. Anyway, it's easy enough to test and see which you like better. I'm personally not a fan of the crop modes on FF since it takes more effort to see what exactly fit inside the box."
Nikon,35i22f,totallyshould,2,Sun May 10 17:19:16 2015 UTC,I tried DX on FF for the first time last night shooting soccer at night.  It wasn't bad and I think it may be better than the D7000 in regards to higher iso.  I will have to test more but to be honest I'm not sure if  the difference it noticeable at lower iso with better light.
Nikon,35i22f,burning1rr,1 point,Mon May 11 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right. The latest FX is better than the latest DX, but not to the point that a DX crop out of an FX sensor is going to look much better. Splitting hairs, it might win by a bit... but we're splitting hairs. It sounds like you will get a lot of mileage out of a new lens."
Nikon,35i22f,totallyshould,1 point,Mon May 11 02:40:43 2015 UTC,Why would running a FX sensor in crop mode introduce any more noise than running it in standard mode?
Nikon,35i22f,burning1rr,1 point,Mon May 11 13:43:42 2015 UTC,"It's the same noise pattern, but blown up 1.5x.   Similarly, if you resize your 24 megapixel image to a little 500 pixel web image noise will disappear to a wonderful extent."
Nikon,35i22f,totallyshould,1 point,Mon May 11 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. But FX sensors still see a stop and a half less ISO noise than a DX sensor. Would the larger pixels be enough to offset that advantage?  IIRC, some of the old black and white film obtained incredible dynamic range not by attempting to avoid noise, but by having such fine noise that it wasn't visible."
Nikon,35i22f,RingoC,1 point,Mon May 11 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"It's really only an apples to apples comparison if it is the same sensor technology and the same sensor generation. Some time after the D3 it seems like Nikons sensors started to get finer noise and less color blotches- it might be the same amount of noise numerically, but the latest generation looks to me like the noise is less objectionable. Less like a gross blotchy ""digital"" look, and more of a graceful degradation like that film you are talking about.   Your end result is important too. Some people wouldn't have shot the D7000 over 800, but I was perfectly happy with it (for my use) at 6400. For the handheld dim light shots I was doing, and the post processing I was applying, it was better to get the shot than to worry that I could no longer see somebody's pores, or count their eyelashes from across the room."
Nikon,35i22f,totallyshould,3,Mon May 11 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Even with the crop, the D610 won't be any worse in terms of iso than the D7000. Auto focus is about the same between both cameras too. If money is no object, I'd take the D610. It's a newer camera, full frame, etc.  On the other hand, the D7000 is a great value and will probably perform about the same in the scenario you are looking at."
Nikon,35h2o4,aequitus,9,Sun May 10 07:49:04 2015 UTC,Have you tried checking your bracket settings?
Nikon,35h2o4,uberbroke,3,Sun May 10 08:11:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, looks like bracketing is turned on."

Nikon,35h2o4,uberbroke,1 point,Sun May 10 18:47:08 2015 UTC,Nice! I went through the same thing when I rented out a D610 for a trip to Antelope Canyon. I had all these pictures with seemingly random exposures and thought I had a bad camera!
Nikon,35h2o4,r_golan_trevize,5,Sun May 10 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"What metering mode are you using? Matrix, spot, center weighted or highlight priority?  I would expect matrix to vary only a little with that scene from shot to shot but depending on how much shadow at the bottom or brighter wood at the top gets included as you move the camera around it could change some from shot to shot. Spot could jump wildly between under and overexposure depending on if the center of the frame is pointed at the white shell of the controller or the black shadow underneath. Center weighted would vary to a lesser degree than spot but more than matrix.   The only way to completely keep the camera from varying exposure is to put it in manual mode and turn off auto-ISO. In any other mode, or if auto-ISO is turned on in manual, the camera is always trying to adjust exposure according to which metering mode you've set it to and which variables (shutter speed, aperture & ISO) are available to it in the exposure mode you've chosen.    Matrix metering, in general, is trying to make the whole scene average out to middle grey - it's actually much more sophisticated than that but that's a good enough way to think about it to get started with - dark scenes tend to get brightened up and bright scenes tend to get toned down. spot metering looks only at what's under the center focus point and adjust exposure to make whatever is in that small area average out to middle grey.  center weighted metering is a combination of the two - it evaluates the whole scene and also an area in the center of the frame and averages the two exposures with the center spot being weighted higher than the overall scene. highlight priority is like spot metering except that it also scans the scene for blown highlights and lowers exposure from where spot metering would normally choose to preserve the highlights in the scene. Your shots may appear underexposed but that's the point - it kept highlights from blowing and then you're supposed to brighten them back up on editing."
Nikon,35h2o4,shawnleecl,1 point,Sun May 10 11:45:34 2015 UTC,"I'm using Matrix metering, but it seems that bracketing was the setting to blame in this mystery. Thanks for all of the information, though, it was super informative!"
Nikon,35h2o4,Blrfl,3,Sun May 10 18:48:06 2015 UTC,Seems like the camera is focusing & metering at a different area?

Nikon,35h2o4,DevilsHandyman,2,Sun May 10 11:34:48 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't feel dumb. Today you discovered bracketing! Seriously. Where would we all be if we never learned something new ?  One of my favorite things about photography is leaning something new."
Nikon,35g260,Aaberg123,1 point,Sun May 10 00:26:01 2015 UTC,I have two Tokinas. They have the same ID chip - something like this but with different focal lengths programmed into it. Same ID though. I wouldn't say Nikon screwed anyone it's a bad move on Tokina's part. Still frustrating. I don't know if Tamron is the same.  With my lenses Af-fine tune can not tell the difference between them. I can. I can just remember their numbers and dial them in without redoing the testing. One is +4 the other -20 (yea it's got problems). Af-fine tune is in my menu for when I need to switch them. Pain in the ass minimized.
Nikon,35g260,KaJashey,1 point,Sun May 10 01:54:01 2015 UTC,"Is the af tune a single value for the lens, or is it like Canon where you can have one for the wide end and one for the long end on a zoom lens?"
Nikon,35g260,KaJashey,1 point,Sun May 10 08:42:07 2015 UTC,It's singular. It's one number for the lens. You can choose - within reason - how far away to put your test chart and tune the lens for. One lens I tuned for portraits looking at eye sharpness instead of at a test chart.  Generally you do not want to test a lens near it minimum focusing distance.  On Canon what's the usual spread for a lens when you have two values?
Nikon,35g260,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Sun May 10 13:44:20 2015 UTC,Depends on the lens. My Sigma 18_35 needed quite different adjustments at either end. I think it was - 5 and +7 or something like that.
Nikon,35g260,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Sun May 10 15:18:51 2015 UTC,"Correct, both of those lenses have the same ID and cannot be independently fine tuned."

Nikon,35g260,MagFreakingNeto,1 point,Mon May 11 05:31:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think you might benefit from buying the Nikon 50mm 1.8G & 24mm F/2.8D instead of the 24-70, then you can AF fine tune but also have a faster prime.  Both these lenses are really light as well and you should be able to get them both for less than the 24-70.  Maybe worth considering? You just gotta ask yourself if you mind changing lenses, at least the 50+24 are compact & light so you can carry them in a jacket pocket if need be. No VC for video either.  I was going to buy the Tamron 24-70 myself, I was really, really tempted. Maybe someday, but I gotta say after owning the 50mm 1.4 Art (815g Sigma) I absolutely love the light weight of the 50mm and 24mm Nikon primes.   If I need zoom I switch to my 70-300 Tamron VC but I usually own bring this if I know I'm going to a wildlife park, zoo or some kind of show. (incredible lens for the price by the way)  You could also buy the Tamron 70-300 instead of the 70-200 to avoid the same lens ID. (potentially, unless the 70-300 also has the same ID) then you're dealing with a lens that has more reach but is slower. (f4 - 5.6)"

Nikon,35ewn8,Childoftheko4n,3,Sat May 9 18:02:45 2015 UTC,"Without actually being able to feel the resistance I hesitate to draw any conclusion from a subjective description. However, a few thoughts... Does it grind? Is the resistance consistent, or does it increase / decrease at a certain point? Have you inspected the mount on the lens for any burrs or surface imperfections?  Consistent resistance would most likely be from the flange being inset a smidge. Varying resistance might indicate a misaligned flange. Both can be corrected with an adjustment. Surface irregularities would be more difficult to remedy, but unless it's a contaminate coating it's unlikely to be the cause."
Nikon,35d4yj,mcapello,2,Sat May 9 04:01:23 2015 UTC,"Given that all cameras use FAT32 as their filesystem, this is always a risk, especially if a camera is turned off, or loses power, or encounters a bug in its FAT32 implementation, whilst it's writing to the card.  Solution: don't keep two months worth of photos on the memory card. Use it only for temporarily storing the photos until you're able to get them onto something safer. Also, use multiple smaller cards and rotate them hourly/daily so that if you do lose a card, you don't lose all your photos."
Nikon,35d4yj,cowbutt6,1 point,Sat May 9 07:41:17 2015 UTC,"Huh. Thanks for the answer. I've been using digital cameras since the late 90s, often without ever replacing the memory cards, and I've never lost anything. Didn't even know it was possible, much less common."
Nikon,35clvo,fviii,3,Sat May 9 00:39:23 2015 UTC,Manually choosing ISO lets you pick your ISO in 1/3 stop steps (or 1/2 if you've changed that menu setting) but the camera can choose finer intermediate steps when auto-ISO is enabled (1/6 of a stop I think).   I wouldn't worry about it too much though - 1/6 of a stop one way or the other isn't going to make much difference and is easily fixable in editing if it's really necessary.
Nikon,35clvo,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Sat May 9 13:53:47 2015 UTC,I'm assuming that's a setting exclusive to more expensive models?  I couldn't find anything in the settings when I was looking.

Nikon,35d6pf,Oprama2016,3,Sat May 9 04:21:50 2015 UTC,From my experience the 70-200 is almost useless for wildlife. Unless your subjects are going to be close to you its not a large enough focal length.  As one user mentioned below have you looking into the 300 f4 or 80-400 VR ?
Nikon,35d6pf,iplaywithrocks,2,Sat May 9 12:20:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, especially on full frame.  IME, 500mm is just getting started with wildlife."
Nikon,35d6pf,gimmebackmyracecar,2,Sat May 9 14:26:16 2015 UTC,"If you do outdoor and wild life then you will benefit alot from the VR And you need fast focus, I would say spend the money on a good lens rather than regretting it later."

Nikon,35btbg,Tollas,1 point,Fri May 8 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"There is an app for SumgMug called Instant SmugMug Upload (though I've never used it and can't vouch for it). I'm guessing you could use the 7200's built-in wifi to connect to your phone/tablet, then (maybe?) point the app at the camera for instant upload.  Keep in mind that if you're shooting high res, and with your phone wifi connected to the camera, you'll be sending a TON of data over your provider's network.    It may be possible to tether your camera through the USB connection to an OTG adapter and use a wifi connection for your data transmission to the hosting site, but then you have to deal with a wire.    The other alternative is to swap mem cards every so often, upload one, shoot on another. No matter which way you go, though, it will take a bit of work."

Nikon,35b9ay,foxandowl,1 point,Sat May 9 01:39:37 2015 UTC,"Right, I have three lenses and the other two have internal motors so they focus on the dots for me, so I know they are focused. This lens doesn't have an internal motor, so it won't autofocus with my camera. I previously used it on my D40 though, and I used to be able to focus quickly enough. Sure it was manual so I was slower than an automatic might be. If I'm taking a minute to compose a shot, it doesn't really matter as I can use live view, but now it's basically impossible to shoot photos of people in a crowded room for example, as I can't focus on them at low f stops to be sharp enough unless they are standing still and I'm using live view.  Hmm so maybe I'm using this viewfinder wrong somehow? Is it different from the D40 (if anyone has compared those two). I will try being closer or farther if that might help but I probably have already. I don't use glasses. I tried adjusting it by using live view to focus it, then switching to the viewfinder and adjusting the diopter all the way, except that it doesn't seem to go far enough.  I was hoping to not need to buy a new lens, considering I never noticed an issue attempting this on my D40, and being a college student with no income yet and lots of other things I could spend $200 of loans on :/"
Nikon,35b9ay,Matterchief,1 point,Fri May 8 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"The diopter has NOTHING to do with adjustment of lenses. The diopter is for adjusting the viewfinder your vision to the camera. If you don't wear glasses, the diopter is useless. Your camera isn't designed to be manually focused. You can either wait for the dot, or buy a new lens."
Nikon,35b9ay,Matterchief,1 point,Fri May 8 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help, hmm maybe I'm using the wrong terminology then? When I look at the screen for a live preview of the shot, I can use the manual focus ring on my camera to adjust the focus of the any of my lenses (with the kit lenses set to manual), and this matches the output of the sensor - the pictures look like what I expect and what I see on the screen. When I look through the viewfinder, I can't seem to find any position that looks correct, even if I adjust the little dial on the viewfinder. When I say ""correct"" I mean that it matches the digital output.  I have been to the optometrist but my vision is something like 20/25 -  not the best but I suspect that's not the issue.  With my kit 18-55 and 55-200, the aperture can't be set nearly as low as it can with my AF NIKKOR 50mm 1:1.8 D, so on the 50 it's much more distinct what is in focus. With either kit lens, the camera autofocuses them depending on the camera settings (to the closest thing, or to a specific focus dot, etc.) but with the 50 it can't focus (because that lens autofocuses with a screw where the lens is mounted that the camera doesn't have). For my kit lenses, I can pick an autofocus dot and it will automatically focus to that point, so I know what is in focus. On the 50, are you saying that the red dot will still appear when it is in focus, even if I'm adjusting it manually? I focus by eye, as I did on my D40 which worked fine, but when I do that on this camera, all the photos come out with a different focus than what I intended. It was easy enough to get what I wanted in focus on the viewfinder with the D40, but I'm not able to do it on the D3300."
Nikon,35b9ay,Matterchief,0,Fri May 8 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"RTFM dude.  There is a green dot that appears in the corner of the viewfinder when MANUAL focus lenses are used.  Edit: And neither your camera or your lens are designed to manually focused unless absolutely necessary. You will just have to either spend money, or deal with it."
Nikon,35b9ay,fviii,1 point,Fri May 8 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"Cool, that green dot is progress! ...I did read the manual, but I was apparently looking for the wrong thing, so legitimate thank you for helping me find it now. So now I can focus on something by some means at least.  Any idea why the viewfinder image isn't sharpest at the same time as the camera sensor image is in focus? This was something I immediately noticed the first and every time I used the lens with the new camera, basically holding the camera the same way and taking shots like I used to makes me end up with all out of focus shots, and I never adjusted it to see that green dot since it doesn't look like it comes up until I depress the shutter release halfway, which I never did (already focused manually by eye) or else used the red dots anyway."
Nikon,35b9ay,ottaky3,0,Fri May 8 19:41:51 2015 UTC,It's probably blurry cause you fucked with your diopter lol
Nikon,35an6d,Azeem259,2,Fri May 8 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"When in auto mode, the flash will pop up when the camera things it's needed. AFAIK, other modes don't do this.  The manual has info on how to change the file type.  Your camera takes 24MP photos, when set. The quality of the lens, and your ability, will determine the quality of the photos."
Nikon,35an6d,mrdat,1 point,Fri May 8 15:01:16 2015 UTC,So is it possible to get the camera to flash all the time?
Nikon,35an6d,mrdat,2,Fri May 8 15:33:39 2015 UTC,"I think if you keep the flash up, it'll flash all the time."
Nikon,35an6d,KaJashey,2,Fri May 8 15:46:43 2015 UTC,Put the camera in P-mode or better on the commander dial. So any of the PSAM modes but P-mode might be good for a newbie as it will shoot mostly automatic with some manual overrides.  In P-Mode if the flash is up it will fire the flash. If the flash is down it will not fire the flash. The flash itself becomes the switch for what you want it to do. At no time does it pop the flash for you in these modes. It might suggest a flash with some icons but it will not pop it for you.  If you go back to Auto or or some of the scene modes the camera is going to make the decision on if it should pop the flash or fire the flash. Notable exception is obviously the No-Flash scene mode.
Nikon,35an6d,benfires,2,Fri May 8 16:19:47 2015 UTC,"(I don't mean to hijack this chain)  In PSAM modes your flash will always fire regardless as long as it is up. Note that when your flash is on you're limited to 1/250s shutter speed max, though the camera usually sets this to 1/60s. In auto mode it may not fire at all even though it's up, this will depend on what the camera determines."
Nikon,35an6d,benfires,2,Fri May 8 16:30:05 2015 UTC,"The pop up flash will ONLY auto trigger in modes out of PSAM and Auto No Flash (duh).  When you half-press a shutter in any modes out of those 5, the pop up flash might open. If it does, it's an indication that the camera thinks using flash is needed. If the lighting conditions change between the time of pop to actual shutter actuation and the camera thinks it's bright enough, then the flash won't trigger.  To activate pop up flash in the PSAM modes, just press the flash button on the side of your camera and it should pop up. The same button works for adjusting flash compensation also.  To confirm if you're shooting RAW, check the info screen. It should say RAW and not JPEG, unless that's what you want to shoot. You will need to dive into your custom settings to see if you can change the type of RAW file recorded (12 bit, 14 bit etc).  For your sensor/lens issue, to make the most of your sensor you'll need to get sharp lenses. Prime lenses are a pretty good way to start cheap, especially the 35mm DX that's very highly regarded. Unless you pixel peep at 100% crop, your kit lens and maybe one prime will be sharp enough for your general usage. Just make sure that whatever prime lens you get has the G Version. The ""older"" mechanical D versions will not autofocus on your camera, but are still excellent lenses nonetheless."
Nikon,35an6d,Demorthus,2,Fri May 8 16:27:45 2015 UTC,"I just purchased my first D3300 as well. Quite honestly you're going to have so much fun with it. I'm a noob to photography as well but ever since my house (apartment building)  burned down I have nothing but time on my hands to just go out and shoot. (it's quite therapeutic for me honestly).  Since it's your first dslr (as it is mine) spend some time and learn aperture, ISO,  & shutter speed. It's a DSLR, I know I don't have to explain to you how much the value of shooting manual is infinitely superior and gives you control with your creativity of how you want things to come out when you shoot :).    You may shoot auto if you want but for the full fun/advantage I recommend you head over and read some articles/guides /tutorials & pretty much just actively experiment with your camera"
Nikon,35an6d,kmmccorm,1 point,Fri May 22 13:38:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's just auto mode that will pop up the flash - it tends to err on the side of using the flash more often then not if not in direct sunlight.  The file format used is in the settings - you can select RAW only, JPEG only or both RAW and JPEG.  The sensor will take 24mp pictures. You can control the size/quality of those files in the settings.  The manual is quite helpful when navigating the settings!"
Nikon,35an6d,jgilbs,1 point,Fri May 8 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"The lens will not determine how many megapixels a picture is.  Learn how to change the picture quality and size, as this is what dictates your picture size, not your lens."

Unless you are going to be pixel peeping or cropping a section that is 100% cropped you won't notice anything that will make you think less. It is still going to be a better camera than what you have currently.  That being said, you can look into the 24-120 f4 or the 28-70 f2.8 if you are on a budget. Also the 60 f2.8D or G are also amazing on this camera. If Money is no object you can get the renowned 24-70 2.8  but not even that pushes this sensor, the new PF lenses are designed for the 24MP+ realm but they are rolling out slowly."

Nikon,35887s,urbaneyezcom,2,Fri May 8 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"Do you really need the megapixel count? If not you'd be better served with a D610 or 750 with a lens or three.  Edit: Oops, I thought you said D810! For some nice lenses on the cheap, the 50mm 1.8D (G is preferable) and the 24mm 2.8D are rather nice, the Tamron 70-300 is also incredible for the price.  Don't worry too much about needing a razor sharp lens because of the 36mp, you'll only notice if you're doing heavy cropping or pixel peeping. I mean, there are some bad lenses out there but for the most part people  obsess too much.  In my experience a lens is bad if they have a combination of some of the following: bad build quality, the focus is slow, it's noisy or has excessive lens defects. (distortion, ca, etc) Sharpness is usually not a big issue but there are those cases of exceptionally soft lenses."

Pay attention to framing the artwork correctly to avoid keystone distortion. The mild barrel distortion and vignette can be corrected easily in lightroom. This lens is a beast. Protect the front element as filters are not readily available in a conventional screw-on method.
Nikon,356b4b,Thanassi44,2,Thu May 7 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"Excellent, this is what I was looking for most. I'll certainly bring my tripod along. It arrived yesterday and I've been messing with it. Having shot the 10-20 seems to have helped me."
Nikon,356b4b,W00ster,1 point,Fri May 8 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"Indeed, ISO 64 - f/8 looks good even at 14."
Nikon,356b4b,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Fri May 8 00:21:35 2015 UTC,"Not yet but I hear it is AMAZING, especially for Milky Way photos because of how little distortion and abberation it has.  Rated better than most primes!"
Nikon,356b4b,coogie,1 point,Fri May 8 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"Tip #1 Do NOT drop it!  Even if it's a couple of inches, this lens has very delicate and precise internal parts.  I made that $700 mistake a few years ago with mine.   Tip #2, watch the front glass!  It's bulbous and sticks out.  Tip #3, watch out for lens flare- You don't really have lens hood other than the built in one but depending on how you're pointing at hte light, you could get it.   Tip #4, like all UWA lenses, try to keep the lens straight because the keystone effect will be noticable if you do extreme angles.    This is my favorite lens so I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  Here are a few pics I've taken with this and the D610: 24mm end: https://www.flickr.com/photos/coogie/17250996125/lightbox/  14mm end: https://www.flickr.com/photos/coogie/16656166384/in/photostream/lightbox/  handheld at f/2.8 (not quite wide enough for the Astrodome) https://www.flickr.com/photos/coogie/17094076151/in/dateposted-public/lightbox/   another one handheld at f/2.8 - notice how even at f/2.8 your depth of field is very wide and hyper focal distance is not that far away.  https://www.flickr.com/photos/coogie/15893881481/in/dateposted-public/lightbox/   https://www.flickr.com/photos/coogie/16116716082/in/dateposted-public/lightbox/"
Nikon,355zc9,Gyuudon,3,Thu May 7 11:49:28 2015 UTC,I was in a similar situation but decided to go with the Sigma 17-50 f/2.8 OS.  I also sold my 35mm in favor of a 50mm since the 35mm really didn't blow me away.
Nikon,355zc9,brancky3,3,Thu May 7 12:30:15 2015 UTC,"You kind of nailed it, it's pretty much weight and price vs versatility. It's a pretty personal preference.   Some people don't want to be trapped and having the ability to go a little wider is important. Keep in mind that 18-35mm is not a huge zoom range, but if you use your 35mm and occasionally to regularly wish you could go just a bit wider, you might consider it.  Other people like a lighter camera. A great camera isn't any good if you leave it at home today because it's too heavy. Also some people work better when they're ""stuck."" Sometimes not having too many choices makes you more creative, as too many choices can lead to a kind of paralysis. But again, that comes down to how you shoot and your thought processes.  I typically recommend the 35mm to those starting out because it's cheap. If you're uncertain see if you can find a used copy. The advantage is you can sell it later for almost as much as you pay for it if you buy it used. Also as you're learning not having a zoom on a lens can force you to focus on the other problems you need to deal with (composition, exposure, etc.).  If you have an 18-55 or 18-something zoom already, you can choose whether you need a low light lens (35mm) something with a wide angle option (18-whatever)."
Nikon,355zc9,ApatheticAbsurdist,3,Thu May 7 16:22:10 2015 UTC,"Sometimes not having too many choices makes you more creative, as too many choices can lead to a kind of paralysis.   This is the reason I almost always shoot with a prime. Not being able to zoom forces you to move your feet and move more around your subject. It makes me think more and be more creative. I don't get stuck zooming in and out.  BTW I have the 35mm f/1.8 and love it."
Nikon,355zc9,brightsizedlife,2,Thu May 7 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"This is the reason I almost always shoot with a prime. Not being able to zoom forces you to move your feet and move more around your subject.   This is a double edged sword. If you are thinking about moving and zooming, you can choose the distance that gets you the right perspective and them zoom accordingly to frame. But zoom can very easily become either a crutch or yet another setting that can overwhelm.  It really is a personal choice and depends on how you like to shoot. There is a lot to love about your lens."
Nikon,355zc9,ApatheticAbsurdist,1 point,Thu May 7 23:30:09 2015 UTC,In general I agree but indoors sometimes you can't move back far enough. I've got the 35 1.8 as well but wouldn't mind having a 22 or 24 1.8 just to get a bit wider. Sigma does the same thing.
Nikon,355zc9,Prequalified,1 point,Fri May 8 05:18:23 2015 UTC,Have you considered the tamron 17-50 f/2.8?
Nikon,355zc9,filyr,1 point,Thu May 7 13:25:08 2015 UTC,"Sigma would be fun because being able to drop to 18 would create a different perspective. However, the 35 is an excellent lens and very sharp and fast for the price. I would probably look at getting something vastly different. Either an ultra wide lens (10-24), mid range zoom (24-70), or another prime around 85mm. But it really comes down to the type of shooting you like to do."
Nikon,355zc9,ndnSilverFox,1 point,Thu May 7 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"I recommend the 35 to a lot of friends, mainly because of budget constraints and how fun it is to shoot with.  In this case though, I'd take the Sigma. I really enjoy shooting with mine on a d7000 (and sometimes I'll throw it in my d3s to use @ 35mm). It feels pretty well balanced on the body, and I don't often feel I'm ""lugging"" it around if that's all I'm carrying.   It's quite versatile, though it doesn't have the biggest zoom range, the 1.8 is tremendously helpful in many situations, especially indoors.   If anything, try both out at a camera shop if there is one within practical distance."
Nikon,355zc9,TFareCool,1 point,Thu May 7 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards the Sigma but one big issue concerns me: how is the af issue? Do I really need to get the dock to calibrate the focus?  I know many are suggesting the f2.8 lenses thanks for the suggestions but again, main reason that I believe I'm getting the 1.8 is for nighttime and indoor lighting areas... some being dim ""romantic"""
Nikon,355zc9,TFareCool,1 point,Fri May 8 04:34:24 2015 UTC,"Mine hadn't a problem with focusing. It was always spot on when it confirmed focus, and I mean pixel-peeping 1.8 shots. Though, you should worry about variation, just make sure you can get a good one.   The closest camera store to me was a 3 hour drive one-way, but I got to make sure it worked well before I bought it. I don't own the dock, since I don't have the need.   The biggest concern for you would be the tradeoff between versatility and weight. I chose something versatile (mainly due to a trip that would benefit from something decently wide and fast). I really do love what the lens can do, and if you'd like I can post some samples."
Nikon,355zc9,thekid9989,1 point,Fri May 8 06:03:39 2015 UTC,I own a D7100 my self and I also shot in primes. I personally do not have the 35mm but I do have the 50mm 1.8. I love my fifty. It give great results and is only $150 Canadian. Plus the D7100 has a motor so you gain back the auto focus you lose on cheaper bodies.  End off between the two I would go with the 35. You should see a difference in quality right away.
Nikon,355zc9,sky1193,1 point,Thu May 7 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"I got the 35 for my D7200 shortly after getting a 70-200 so I could have something wide that's good in low light. But I really found I was wishing it was wider. I eventually saved up and got a 17-55 2.8 for the range. So for me, between those 2 I'd go with the sigma for the zoom versatility."
Nikon,355zc9,Phrexeus,1 point,Thu May 7 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"I've owned both. Basically the Nikon 35mm is small, light and fun to shoot with, but it can't compete with the optical quality or flexibility (zoom) of the Sigma. I think there's merit to owning both considering the price and size/weight of the Nikon. Having said that, after using the Sigma it's hard to enjoy the Nikon as much, because you know you're losing out on image quality.  There is a downside to the Sigma though and that's the focus - in my experience it's inconsistent, and for best results you have to use live view. For landscape work, this isn't such a problem, for portraits it can be frustrating.  I ended up sending the Nikon 35mm back and getting the 50mm f/1.8G as my more portable/fun lens.  Btw, I also bought the Sigma with night photography in mind... not a bad choice as it is sharp wide open, unlike the Nikon."
Nikon,354tfo,sushimpp,2,Thu May 7 02:48:09 2015 UTC,"Ive been using Satechi triggers for all my cameras. What I like about them is that they do have a wireless version which if you dont have the wireless part but the remote and the cable, you could connect right to remote. They also have a bluetooth version that would connect to your phone but I haven't tried that one. Here's the bluetooth version and here's the cable wireless version."
Nikon,354tfo,ieatkids13,1 point,Thu May 7 06:30:25 2015 UTC,I've had the same issue but I don't think there is such a device.  If you find a wireless device that controls aperture and shutter let me know.  I have the same issue when shooting brackets with the tripod.

Because i liked the idea of having a zero shuttercount again :) didnt mind the dust because i shoot mostly with low F number. I asked if they could replace the shutter. Couple of months later i photographed something with high f number. Sooo much dust on the image. I emailed them that i had a terrible dust problem and asked if they could fix it. Send it back to them but this time it took longer than one week. It took a month!! They send my camera to head office in germany to give me a permanant sollution. Took forever! Think germany had to order new D610 from japan. So I got it back was very happy because my ""old"" D600 loooked like it was in a war. All scratched up.

Nikon,351sjl,ahmed_iAm,1 point,Thu May 7 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I had no more oil issues with the new D610.  But dust can always get into the sensor area of your camera, so there will always be a need to know how to wet clean your own camera.  There are youtube clips on how to do it.  It's really easy once you do it the first time.  But the swabs are fairly expensive though."

Nikon,3543m8,SPOOFE,0,Thu May 7 02:34:18 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not a kit lens, but an Adorama bundle deal. The lens is usually $350 but I think it did not sell very well."
Nikon,3502zf,Grateful_Dave,4,Wed May 6 00:01:55 2015 UTC,"In my personal experience, if one thing is broken (especially something like the AF), I would be skeptical that there was more broken that they weren't telling me. If you feel confident in your ability to check, though, and it's an awesome deal? Go for it!"
Nikon,3502zf,Princenomad,2,Wed May 6 03:42:31 2015 UTC,"IMHO life is too short for broken lenses because a mechanical issue usually means the lens suffered severe physical trauma at some point and it is only going to get worse...and it WILL fail when you need it most.  Last I saw, that lens isn't very expensive so I'd be willing to bet you could find a decent condition fully operational one for not much more.    Good luck!  Totally worth it."
Nikon,3502z3,lurend,2,Wed May 6 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"I take it a speedlight would be too distracting in your situation?  Low light is where full frames absolutely shine, you could get a D610 for around $1500 USD depending on your area, and pair up a 50mm 1.8 for another $100-200. The main benefit of the D750 would be the low light autofocus, on the other hand it's a lot more for similar image quality and high iso performance. If you can afford it and you see yourself shooting low light quite often in the future then it might be a worthwhile investment.  P.S. in terms of ISO performance, the D610/750 should give you about a stop or so over the D5300 (previously said 2 stops but the D5300 does pretty well.)"
Nikon,3502z3,lilium90,2,Wed May 6 02:05:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I won't be able to use speedlights. It's distracting, and it usually takes me many shots of a dancing couple before I get one without goofy poses or faces.  I've found some used D610 at around $1250 (in Denmark). The AF performance worries me a bit though."
Nikon,3502z3,lilium90,2,Wed May 6 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"I doubt the AF on the D610 would be worse than the D5300, considering the tier it's at. If there's a camera rental place near where you live it may be worth it to try it out. On the other hand, the D750 is damn good on AF, but you know...it's around $1000 more than the D610."
Nikon,3502z3,MagFreakingNeto,2,Wed May 6 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"The D750 has a better AF system than the D4S, so it's not even just low light autofocus; the tracking is also pro level. It's a bit weird the D750 has such high capabilities but I ain't complaining."
Nikon,3502z3,whats_an_upvote,1 point,Fri May 8 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"You should consider renting a fx camera and lenses for this job. This would allow you to test the waters to see if it's worth taking the plunge.

Nikon,3502z3,unr3alist,1 point,Thu May 7 07:51:22 2015 UTC,"I've given a lot of thought to the D7000 series, and I've always regretted going for the D5300 instead.  But, as far as I can tell, the sensors of the D5300 and D7100/D7200 are equivalent. Although the latter do have a much better AF system.  Where I live the price for a new D7100 and a used D610 is almost the same, so I have a hard time justifying going for the DX sensor."
Nikon,3502z3,RingoC,1 point,Wed May 6 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"Are you heavily invested in DX-lenses? If not, I suggest you find a lightly used D610 and smack a 50mm f1.4 on it.  I have a D7100 with that lens, and while the FOV sometimes can feel a bit narrow on a DX(75mm due to the 1.5 crop factor), I assume it's awesome as a portrait- and action lens on an FX.  I bought my 50mm used for about $280 (in Norway, retails around $500 new here), definitely my favorite lens even with the aforementioned crop factor.  Good luck with your purchase :)"
Nikon,3502z3,RingoC,1 point,Wed May 6 02:36:29 2015 UTC,"Even the best sensors out there are only going to be marginally better than the D5300, and they're going to cost a lot more.   You can't really get much faster than 1.8 either, so fast glass isn't a factor.   I would look at your processing work flow. I used to get very decent images with my D7000 at 3200 iso, but had to work for it. Your D5300 is a better performer than that.   Do you have any samples of the environment you're going to be shooting in or the results you want? Maybe we can help you come up with a better plan than just throwing money at this problem."
Nikon,3502z3,mad_dr,2,Wed May 6 10:11:52 2015 UTC,"Imagine a dimly lit dance hall with most of the light emanating from the stage (where the band will be) and some colored spotlights along the walls. What I've done before is walking around the edges of the dance floor capturing the couples that happen to be in light.  And about sensors - surely the newer FX sensors (i.e. 610, 750, 800/810), perform much better in poor lighting than the D5300?"
Nikon,3502z3,turinturambar81,1 point,Wed May 6 02:13:29 2015 UTC,"re: new sensors, yes, they are better. The D750 especially is very good, but it's also a 2000 dollar camera and realistically, it's not going to be a day and night difference.  What you're shooting now is about 800 dollars worth of kit, camera and lens. A D750 will be about 2000, then add an equivalent lens, probably a 50 or 85 1.8. That's another 150-400 dollars.   So you're looking at more than doubling your current (very capable) rig for an improvement... But how much of an improvement?   Is this a paying job? If you can get paid to upgrade to shoot something you were going to shoot anyway, well there's nothing wrong with that.   Is there any way you could try a higher end camera in this setting first? Is renting a D4 or something an option?"
Nikon,3502z3,turinturambar81,0,Wed May 6 02:58:41 2015 UTC,"Hey! What lenses are you using? Usually glass beats sensor in investment. Are you post processing raw images? I have a d5300 and have shot over 3200 iso which, admitedly, was somewhat noisy but still perfectly usable. Regarding the d5500 as mentioned below, as far as I know they share processor and sensor so you would gain little. D7200 might show some gain but nothing massive. 35 mm 1.8 is great and cheap, you can invest in a wider lens such as the tokina 11-16 2.8 or a 20mm 1.8 prime assuming thats the direction you want (being indoors). Have tou considered a tripod? Depending on the motion you miggt get some very interesting shots. Hope some is helpful, cheers"

I won't be using a tripod for this event as I will be moving around. But yes, some tripod+flash combination could produce some very nice photos."
Nikon,34zh1k,Diddycrid,5,Tue May 5 21:06:13 2015 UTC,I would try a different SD card and be sure to format it in the camera before shooting. This will at least tell you if it is a problem with a bad card or the camera. This is probably the cheapest first step in diagnosing the problem.

Are you shooting RAW only, RAW+JPEG, or JPEG only?   If you're shooting RAW then the camera is displaying the embedded JPEG (RAW files have a JPEG preview embedded in them) which may be fine but the RAW data is still corrupted. If that's the case then it could be either the camera or card.   If you're shooting JPEGs only and the images look OK on the camera then it may be a card reader or card issue.  If it's happening on multiple computers it's probably the card and I would try a different SD card and see if the issue goes away. When you clear off cards, make sure you are formatting them on the camera from the camera menu."
Nikon,34zh1k,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Wed May 6 14:05:52 2015 UTC,I'm shooting in JPEG fine at the moment. What is the best format to use raw+JPEG or just RAW?  The problem only seems to happen when I have been shooting a lot in a day but I'm going to an event at brands hatch in 2 weeks so that will probably be the next time I will be able to test it. Thank you :D
Nikon,34zh1k,thegianttaco,1 point,Thu May 7 08:06:38 2015 UTC,"Don't wait until that event to test out the camera and card - you don't want to shoot a bunch of photos there and then find out you still have a problem.  Jpeg Fine is just fine. Yes, ultimately, RAW is better but don't worry about that right now - it doesn't really have anything to do with your problem and I wouldn't want to disrupt your workflow while you're trying to figure this out and you've got an event coming up.  Have you tried downloading the pics from the camera over the USB cable yet?  When you copy pictures from the card to the PC and Mac are you using the same external card reader for both of them or do they have built in SD slots? If you're using the same card reader for both then it's possible it is malfunctioning. If they have built in readers then it's unlikely that they're both bad and the suspicion goes back to the card or camera.  Do you have another card you can test with?"

Nikon,34vr5l,mrjon2069,2,Mon May 4 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"Had to take mine apart a while back because of an issue with the aperture control unit. It's amazing how much they pack into these things, there's just layers of wires and ribbon cables going everywhere. On the other hand, it's also ridiculous how a small design fault can cause the entire thing to fail (weak plastic rivet on the aperture unit of the D80, VERY common problem that throws an error code)."
Nikon,34vr5l,lilium90,1 point,Tue May 5 00:48:38 2015 UTC,I still shoot with my D80.
Nikon,34vr5l,gonehiking,1 point,Tue May 5 17:18:28 2015 UTC,Totally doable if you are handy with electronics and have the right tools.
Nikon,34vr5l,jgilbs,1 point,Tue May 5 19:51:45 2015 UTC,These cameras are basically a computer with a lens on it.     I know I will never loosen a screw on mine. no way I'll start messing with the internals of a modern DSLR.
Nikon,34ux9u,ergo377,7,Mon May 4 19:42:05 2015 UTC,Besides the 50mm f/1.8D   You realize that lens won't autofocus on your D3200. You need a D7x00 or higher model for the autofocus to work on D series lenses.
Nikon,34ux9u,Comfortably_Numb,1 point,Mon May 4 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"I do, but I need something for low light & I like that it has manual aperture control. I've also heard its very sharp."
Nikon,34ux9u,ApatheticAbsurdist,10,Mon May 4 20:22:01 2015 UTC,"I'd strongly recommend going to the 50mm f/1.8G or the 35mm f/1.8G DX. Both will give you aperture control (though you control it through the camera.) If a camera is made for autofocus, it's not going to have the best screen to focus manually with, and the D3200's viewfinder is pretty bad for manual focus. The autofocus on your camera can be more accurate than your eye.  I have a higher end camera that properly autofocuses with the AF-D lenses and I never use the aperture ring, as using the aperture ring can make metering a bit confusing. Set the aperture on the camera."
Nikon,34ux9u,KaJashey,2,Mon May 4 21:21:53 2015 UTC,"As others have said the 35mm f/1.8 G and 50mm f/1.8 g are both great lenses for the camera you have.  The 50mm D is not that sharp wide open. Stop it down to 3.2 it is great. Manually focusing it all the time your going to miss some wonderful shots. This example was the 50mm f/1.8 D on a D40...  It's a great cheap technical lens with no distortion. It might be a learning experience but it's not going to bring home the pictures you want with the hit rate you want. It's might be great for reproduction work, formalism or panorama stitching but... it doesn't autofocus on your camera.  What are you trying to take pictures of???"
Nikon,34ux9u,z00miev00m,2,Tue May 5 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"its about 90 bucks for 1.8d, for about 166 you can 1.8g and autofocus, i picked up both the 50mm & 35mm 1.8g's off amazon for 288 for both shipped. (refurbished by nikon)  they both have aperture control (thru the camera)"
Nikon,34ux9u,lurkinshirkin,7,Tue May 5 16:03:21 2015 UTC,"I would recommend the 18-200mm vrII, been on my camera for the last 6months, very handy for walkabout"
Nikon,34ux9u,GuavaTree,3,Mon May 4 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"Depends what you would like to shoot, landscapes (then a wide angle such as the tokina 11-16), wildlife or action (zoom lens with wide apertures), macro, portraits etc. All these choices are dependent on your budget, keep that in mind.  As someone now starting out, a nice zoom may be nice as well as an external flash, this can help you do small jobs and make you some dough"
Nikon,34ux9u,RingoC,2,Mon May 4 20:04:16 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Nikon,34ux9u,W00ster,3,Mon May 4 20:22:26 2015 UTC,"I think the 35mm 1.8g is the only really essential dx lens. Once I got mine, it almost never came off my camera. It's light, small, cheap, fast, and sharp. I bought it and a 50 1.4 at the same time and sold the 50 as I was never using it."
Nikon,34ux9u,RingoC,1 point,Mon May 4 21:30:20 2015 UTC,"What do you shoot?    I could never do with a prime only. I would never have the right focal length for the job, I would be too far away from the object etc. Primes are great when you have a set situation where the locations do not change and you can get up and close to what you are taking pictures of.    Primes have their use but not as allround lenses. If I'm only going to have a single lens with me, I always go for one with a decent zoom range, depending on what I'm going to shoot and where I am. My lenses covers the range from 14 to 300mm."
Nikon,34ux9u,throwaway47523,2,Tue May 5 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm looking at it from this perspective. The guy has a decent normal zoom in the 18-55. I think for most people, the next logical step is a fast prime, and on dx the 35 is a more useful focal length than 50.   When I say it's the only essential dx lens, I just mean, if you want to go more telephoto, there's options. If you want a zoom, there's options. The 35 kind of sits alone in terms of value and performance. No excuse not to have one.   The exception here is if you have some special need to go longer (birds, planes, sports) or wider (landscapes). But op doesn't have any that I'm aware of.   I think I'd be pretty happy with 3 lenses - a normal zoom (I like the Sigma 17-70 2.8-4), a telephoto (if I had money, the 70-200 4 but I had a 55-300 for awhile and liked it fine) and the 35 1.8.  There's a zillion different ways to set up your camera bag, but I think almost everyone would find the 35mm useful, so that's why I would consider it essential.   Anyhow, just my opinion. I shoot Fuji now but I'm always looking at getting back into Nikon."
Nikon,34ux9u,RingoC,0,Tue May 5 17:30:58 2015 UTC,"If you're doing 50mm, I've heard that 1.8 is generally better than 1.4."
Nikon,34ux9u,jardosh,1 point,Mon May 4 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I was going to do it again I would definitely get the 1.8. Even if I didn't use it as much, I wouldn't feel like it was wasted money at half the cost of the 1.4."
Nikon,34ux9u,dmcc1964,1 point,Mon May 4 22:21:07 2015 UTC,"If you have budget, go for 70-200 f/4. If you really need a lens for low light, 70-200 f/2.8 is a killer..more expensive though but really awesome."
Nikon,34ux9u,z00miev00m,1 point,Mon May 4 21:59:19 2015 UTC,The idea of a 50 is nuts. Spend the cash and get the 85 1.8. You'll love the focal length. With a 50 you're right on top of your subject...
Nikon,34ux9u,dmcc1964,1 point,Mon May 4 22:22:37 2015 UTC,on a aps-c (the 3200 he has) the 50mm is 75mm so very close to a 85mm on the full frame anyway....  a 85 would be 127 thats pretty z00mie
Nikon,34ux9u,Tnlbro1017,1 point,Tue May 5 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, i know that...just saying a 50, in my opinion, is such a limited piece of glass that it isn't worth the hassle.  Only lens in the 50 range I would suggest is maybe the 60 macro...but for general shooting the 85 is far better."
Nikon,34ruay,W00ster,7,Mon May 4 00:46:15 2015 UTC,Mine does the same thing. I assume this is normal when shooting into the sun given the spherical front lens element.
Nikon,34ruay,Soreye,1 point,Mon May 4 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured it was the case, just found it to be a nice flare in rainbow pattern.    The sun is just up and to right of the tree so not unexpected."
Nikon,34ruay,Hades2k,1 point,Mon May 4 01:42:16 2015 UTC,That is something I am hating for when shooting concerts but that damn thing is so well nano coated that it is hard work to get such nice flares... :D
Nikon,34tf9r,nickrod518,4,Mon May 4 12:28:48 2015 UTC,"I doubt it would be very easy but I understand you wanting to try, 150 is probably more than the value of the camera at this point. As nice a feature as the top lcd is, there's nothing on it that you can't get through the viewfinder. If you can't afford to have the repair go sideways, I'd leave it alone.   Also, I just checked and keh.com is selling used d50 bodies for 90 to 120 bucks, and they're probably in better shape than yours. Don't pay 150 for that repair. Good luck whatever you decide!"
Nikon,34tf9r,RingoC,2,Mon May 4 13:10:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize you could get all the same info through the viewfinder, that's very good to know! The camera body itself is actually in great shape, so I don't think I want to replace anything but the screen."
Nikon,34tf9r,scotttech1,1 point,Mon May 4 13:31:45 2015 UTC,"I replaced the rear LCD on my D40, it took an hour and a bit being extra careful since it was my first time repairing an electronic device, but it seemed easy enough, and the LCD cost me like $15 on Ebay"
Nikon,34tf9r,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Mon May 4 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"Probably. I've seen some teardowns of DSLRs and they seem to be usually put together in similar fashion. Prepare your self for a bunch of flat ribbon cables with fiddly connectors. I've taken a old superzoom camera apart down to the sensor and successfully put it back together again.  As mentioned, you should be able to use the camera just fine without the top LCD display - between the viewfinder and rear LCD screen you should be able to see everything you need to see.  I also agree $150 isn't worth paying unless it has some serious sentimental value - there are a lot of excellent older DSLRs you could buy in full working condition for that money, including another D50."
Nikon,34tf9r,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Mon May 4 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll have to learn how to find all the info between the viewfinder and rear LCD."
Nikon,34s68s,zerocrash,3,Mon May 4 02:35:47 2015 UTC,"Looks like they dropped it, but I'm not a pro."
Nikon,34s68s,cyanight7,2,Mon May 4 03:04:45 2015 UTC,That is definitely not the way it came from the factory.  The 18-55 is notorious for breaking and failing in various ways.  Do you have focus problems with only this lens?  Can you manually focus OK?  What other lens(es) do you have?
Nikon,34s68s,coreynolds,1 point,Mon May 4 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"I have an af-s 55-200mm 1.4-5.6g as well, and after shooting with that one, the difference is remarkable.  I was switching off shooting manually and with autofocus and it looks like the manual photos came out better, but all of them had varying degrees of blurriness. The 55-200 is shooting amazingly well. Thank you for the help.  Could you recommend a lens for product photography?  I have a small light box that I will be using for advertising some paper products, I purchased a tripod and some lights but I will obviously need a new lens.  Any suggestions?"
Nikon,34s68s,lilium90,1 point,Mon May 4 03:41:34 2015 UTC,"35mm or 50mm 1.8 might do the trick depending on what you're shooting. Any chance you could upload a few of the blurry pictures? I'm not quite familiar with that lens, but some of them have a thin plastic/fiber ring along the outside of the element and by the filter threads that is mostly (I think) for minor sealing/aesthetic purposes. I've marked one of mine before with no ill effects, it might not have actually been dropped =S"
Nikon,34s68s,c312eal,2,Mon May 4 07:07:52 2015 UTC,Are you using Auto Focus or Manual Focus. If Manual focus it could be just you not focusing properly. If the lens was dropped and the elements inside were loose you'll get pics where one side is focused and one side not.
Nikon,34s68s,Matterchief,2,Mon May 4 03:14:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, you nailed it right on the head. After looking at the photos taken with the first lens, I noticed minor blurriness on one side and severe blurriness on the other.  Looks like I will need a new lens. Thank you."
Nikon,34s68s,c312eal,1 point,Mon May 4 03:39:16 2015 UTC,"This is a $40 lens. If it works, use it, if it doesn't throw it away."
Nikon,34rvvb,Weenerman,4,Mon May 4 01:00:07 2015 UTC,D3300 is one of the best beginner DSLR's so it is a good choice.You could also think about getting a second D7000 used for around $500 since you know the buttons and so will be able to help out much easily
Nikon,34rvvb,astroman9995,3,Mon May 4 06:23:14 2015 UTC,Another D7000m if you can swing it. that missing second wheel really sucks. And the 3x00 and 5x00 won't be able to AF-D or Ai like your 7000.
Nikon,34rvvb,timdesuyo,1 point,Mon May 4 01:51:41 2015 UTC,"I would buy her a D90 or a D7000 like /u/timedesuyo said. A D90 is close to the D7000 and cheaper. Both will auto-focus with pretty much any lens you get, although the D90 isn't as good in video (pretty bad tbh) as the D7000, but I don't think you'll be using it that much."
Nikon,34rvvb,afmuente,1 point,Tue May 5 03:38:50 2015 UTC,A friend of mine has a d3300 he often uses my lenses its a great camera. I shoot with d600.
